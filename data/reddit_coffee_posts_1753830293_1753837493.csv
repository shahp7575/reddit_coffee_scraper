29M here, originally from overseas and currently living in Austrlia. I’ve been here for a while now, but being far from family and everything familiar has made me realise how hard it is to make real, lasting friendships as an adult especially in a new place.

I’d love to connect with people who are kind, open-minded, and just looking for good vibes and genuine conversation. Whether it’s grabbing a coffee, having a walk by the beach, sharing movie/TV recs, or even just chatting about life or memes, I’m up for it.

Some things I’m into:
🎥 Movies (big fan of thrillers, horror, and some guilty-pleasure romcoms)
📚 Reading (mostly horror, mystery & psychological fiction)
🐾 I miss my two cats back home
🎮 Occasionally game on PS5
🎧 Love podcasts and long random convos about anything and everything

If you’re also feeling like the “making friends” part of adult life is tougher than expected, feel free to DM! ",1,1753837434.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

It seems like everyone around me is settling down and then there’s just me - the one who can’t even get a date.

For the longest time, I was ok being single. Then I met a guy I really liked only to be told by my friends that he definitely isn’t interested; he’s only being polite and that was that. Internally, I disagreed with them - yes, he was polite, but there were things he’d do that would make me think he felt the same - catching each other’s eyes a lot in a group of people, trying to joke with me and make me smile when I was unhappy, coming into work with a cake that he baked himself (and only offered to everyone after my arrival). 

Because I disagreed with them (they never met him), I asked to meet him for coffee. I was shut down. He had his reasons and that’s ok. I thanked him and let him know I wouldn’t be reaching out to him again. I told one friend - she told the rest.

What ensued were conversations with my friends telling me I had to work on myself, I had to change myself, or the one that really hurt me - I’ll never find anyone.

I’m really sorry this is so long. 🥹

I just need to get this off my chest so bad. As much as the rejection hurt and the comments from my friends, I wanted to believe that there would be someone that would like me, but I guess I’ve just lost hope.

I will always be that single friend and I have to get used to that. I have a lot of flaws - I’m not pretty at all (well below average), I’m quiet, I’m weird, I’m bigger (UK size 12). There’s so many things I could change, but I guess I just really wanted someone to like me for me, and not for a person I’d try and be.

What makes it worse is my parents keep talking about relationships and how everyone is in one, but me. How I must be doing something wrong that I can’t possibly find someone.

They’re all right.

Has anyone got any advice on how to overcome the fact that I’ll always be single? Plus, does anyone know how to approach this topic and tell their family to leave them alone? I appreciate you having read this far. Thank you.",2,1753837301.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

A wanted a pasta dinner - who’s guessing Buca di Beppo. Fran can’t get anything there normally so maybe just a tomato sauce. 
She also plans on drinking wine tonight but we get a guest bathroom confession before she attempts to dress herself in office vixen attire:

“people on Snap are telling me to get Locket tested again for dairy allergy”. Fran goes on rant that he’s not allergic to dairy just has an intolerance and that they might check the vibes with a GI doctor and get him tested (no bitch, this was supposed to be done when he was 2 months old and had blood in his stool but you refused to do anything). He’s going to grow out of it from what she’s been told by people on Snap and that will be before he’s one. If he wants to eat dairy when he gets older, she wants to let him. She doesn’t want either of her kids to have a food intolerance. She’s known all along that he doesn’t have an allergy, just an intolerance because he drinks hypoallergenic formulas that contain dairy. Funny thing is she actually has no idea what’s wrong with him or Poetry because they don’t see any specialists as directed by her Ped. 

Other notes from today: Locket stood on a coffee table, pulled himself up onto the couch and now they need to baby gate their playmat because she can’t take her eyes off him for one second. One baby you can focus on, two you can’t because she blinks and he’s across the room (that’s what happens when you’re on your phone scrolling social media instead of playing with your kids like you claim you’re doing).

Also, hates breastfeeding. Can’t wait for it to be over. Wants to go back to never wearing a bra. Posts a pic before she leaves with no bra on after attempting to wear one that was about 3 cup sizes too small. Now she sees locket, not really Poetry, biting and gnawing “with his teeth” (we have never seen said teeth) on pacifiers and bottles and can’t fathom that being her nipples. Forgot to mention yesterday that she wants to go see a doctor about her boobs because it feels like lightning shooting to her nipples and too painful to pump. But now today she claims her supply is back even though her Spectra is supposedly broken and no longer holds a charge and has be to plugged into the wall. Lord help us all.

I'm in a 2.5-year relationship, living with my boyfriend for the past year. Initially, he was incredibly persistent and attentive, showering me with affection and never leaving my side. We moved in together, and I expressed my desire for marriage, explicitly stating that a simple gesture and his spoken commitment were all I needed. He agreed, and for a few months, we mutually showered each other with love, enjoying shared activities like walks and outings.

However, over time, his engagement faded. He stopped joining me for showers, declined walks, and consistently refused invitations to family gatherings, leaving me to attend everything alone. My family noticed his absence, and it was painful to always show up by myself. The deepest hurt came when he stopped having conversations with me at home, constantly glued to his phone. Attempts to hug or cuddle were met with him pushing me away or blocking me, claiming he was doing ""something important,"" only to later laugh at his screen. Our home became lonely, despite not being alone.

I've had four separate discussions with him about how I feel, each time he agreed to change, but nothing ever did. I even clearly stated that if things didn't improve, I would start going out on my own and we'd become roommates, or we would end our lease and go separate ways. He simply responded with ""okay,"" making me feel like he didn't believe I would follow through.

It's now been 18 months of living together, and he still hasn't proposed. I feel like I'm living with a roommate, not a partner I want to build a future with. A week ago, I met a man at the dog park. Our brief conversation made me realize how much I miss genuine interaction and someone who wants to spend time with me. He asked for my Instagram, and to my surprise, asked me out the very next day. I won't lie, the attention felt good, reminding me that others might find me interesting.

My boyfriend found the message from the new man and told me not to go. I love him, but will things truly change? He constantly says he'll do better, but I see no effort. I've told him countless times I'm unhappy, and that I want the man who enjoyed spending time with me, the one who actually touched me. Our sex life is non-existent.

Should I give this relationship yet another chance in hopes he'll change now that he sees others are interested, or is it time to end this relationship, move out, and explore what else is out there?

I have cleaned it with a damp cloth and compressed air, but should I spray some isopropyl alcohol over the mounts of the keys and let that soak overnight? I'd prefer to avoid having no keyboard for a day if possible.

It was very severe in my early 20s but these days I typically might purge once a week maybe even less and sometimes go even longer in recent months (I’ve been increasing my physical activity and purging messes with my strength for days). While I’d imagine years of induced vomiting must be playing a role, on top of that my father has had pretty severe GERD since maybe his 30s to the point that he may be having swallowing issues in his 70s now as a result.  I have not been formally diagnosed but plan on seeing GI some time in the fall. I have pretty intense heart burn more days than not and typically have to take tums (extra strength) multiple times per day - sometimes only a few hours in between. 

Has anyone else experienced trying to adopt a more GERD friendly diet while struggling with deeply triggering feelings of restricting. I feel like I already try very hard to eat pretty healthy day to day (outside of binges) and the idea of further restricting my diet which I have become fairly comfortable with causes me a lot of stress. Some of my favorite go to meals are lentil pasta, taco bowls, hot sauce on eggs or in cottage cheese, coffee with protein powder, chocolate protein bars and I swear my electrolyte drinks are also triggering heart burn as well. I can’t even imagine restricting my diet further and have a strong feeling it will result in increased binges which will then lead to purging which will only aggravate the situation.

Hey there! I’m a straight 30-year-old creative in marketing with a dry sense of humor, an adventurous streak, and a knack for turning everyday moments into something worth remembering. I use a wheelchair for longer distances—but that’s just one part of the story. I’m independent, curious, and always up for something fun, meaningful, or wonderfully weird.



Perks of getting to know me


	•	VIP Parking – Front-row access to life, baby.
	•	Skip the Line – Theme parks, concerts, events… we don’t do “waiting.”
	•	Endless Laughs – Wild injury stories that sound fake (but aren’t).
	•	Unexpected Wins – Free upgrades, kind strangers, and the occasional surprise dessert.
	•	Zombie Apocalypse Strategy – I may not outrun them, but I’m clever, calm under pressure, and hard to miss. That’s teamwork.
	•	You’ll Stand Out – Let’s be real—“normie” couples are overrated.
	•	Built-In Armrest – My chair’s side guards are cozy. You’re welcome.
	•	Strong Hands, Strong Heart – Years of pushing wheels and opening up emotionally.
	•	Creative Problem-Solving – I’m basically a MacGyver with wheels.
	•	Zero Time for Superficial BS – Life’s short. I keep it real and intentional.



A Bit More About Me


I’m all about storytelling—whether it’s through books, music, movies, games, or late-night conversations. I love collecting weird trivia, exploring overlooked places, and getting lost in good ideas.

I stay active in my own way: home workouts, nature walks, and traveling whenever I can. I’ve explored the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Colombia, and the Bahamas—and there’s still plenty more I’d love to experience. (Bonus: I speak Spanish, too!)

I’m the kind of person who notices the little things—your favorite song, how you take your coffee, the way you light up when you talk about something you love. I care deeply, listen closely, and show up consistently. Whether it’s building a playlist, discovering a local gallery, or just sharing quiet time, I value connection that feels grounded and genuine.

⸻

What I’m Looking For:

I’m drawn to people who are:

	•	Playful, grounded, and emotionally present
	•	Down to laugh, explore, and be real together
	•	Into thoughtful conversations and spontaneous fun
	•	Comfortable being fully, unapologetically themselves

I’m open to friendship, flirtation, or something more—whatever feels right. Long-distance, age gaps, different backgrounds—all are welcome. I’m attracted to all body types—connection and energy mean more to me than any one look.

Whatever we build, I just want it to feel real and mutual.



Why You Should Message Me:

If you’re looking for someone thoughtful, creative, and emotionally grounded—someone who values kindness, depth, and shared experiences—I’d genuinely love to hear from you.

No pressure. No expectations. Just an open door and a bit of curiosity.

If something here speaks to you, don’t be shy. Say hello, tell me something about you, and let’s see where the conversation takes us.



Let’s Make Memories:

Big trips, quiet nights, deep talks, shared playlists—I think the best connections are built on a little of everything. Whether you’re looking for something serious or just someone to connect with in an honest, easy way, you’re welcome here.

I had another dream and it sounds stupid but I saw him outside of my dreams, sorry im getting ahead of myself 

I told myself it was just a dream the other night, a weird one-off stitched together from stress and late-night coffee and cramming. But last night proved me wrong. This time I didn’t just see him. I heard him. He spoke to me. 

It started like any other night: phone on charge, window cracked open, sketchbook left out on my desk with the King’s face still staring up at me. I actually managed to fall asleep quickly, but the second my eyes closed, I knew something was wrong. The dream didn’t feel like mine, not like the usual ones I barely remember. 

Usually, when I remember my dreams, they take place outside in wheat fields, woodlands, or sometimes a beach. But not a normal beach… it never connects to anything. It just… exists, a long stretch of sand that meets the ocean and nothing more. They always feel like a journey I never stop and I always move forward, I'm always alone but I don't mind it, sleep is usually an escape for me

But this dream felt familiar in the worst way.

I was on a stage. Behind me, a backdrop of painted mountains and one of those old, illustrated moons, this one was crying. I looked down and saw I was dressed in worn Victorian clothes, uncomfortable and heavy. The stage beneath my feet was wood, creaky and uneven. In front of me was a thick, dark red curtain that looked like it was hung from the sky itself 

A bell chimed and the curtain drew back.

Floodlights flooded the stage in harsh, sterile white. Rows and rows of people stared up at me from the audience. Or… they looked like people but they weren’t. None of them had faces. Just smooth skin where their features should be, like weird low-poly mannequins from some forgotten ‘80s game. In the center of them all sat something worse. A blur. A thing that didn’t seem real just a warped shape with two burning yellow eyes. There was no ceiling just a night sky with the slightest sliver of the sun on the edge of the horizon, it was really cloudy and dark just like the clouds you would see in the middle of a storm but there was no rain, strangely you could see stars through them 

I stood there, speechless. Trapped.

Then someone joined me on stage, a man in his late forties I think, dressed in the same old clothes as me. He looked terrified. His voice cracked as he said:

“Good morning, cousin. You have that look again, the one that hollows the cheek and shortens the day.”

The way he said it was like he didn't want me to respond but he gestured for me to carry on

""Speak then. what sadness lengthens your hours.""

The look of terror vanished from his face. It twisted into a smile, one too wide, too clean. I turned to the crowd and they began to clap, all except the blur with the yellow eyes. It started. Always staring.

My mind went blank. I had no clue what to say but the man wasn’t smiling anymore. His skin began to split, Tear and Flay open. His legs bent unnaturally. His clothing began to blacken and sag around him. His voice deepened, echoing in ways no theatre could make possible. The man continued:

“What mourning paints the morning red?
What flame dares flicker where gods have bled?”

His forehead sprouted antlers long, jagged, like tree branches twisted into horns. His nose rotted away. His eyes ignited with yellow flame, and they locked onto mine. Not just my eyes they looked straight into me, past my soul and into my bloodline.

That cursed sketch was brought to life. 

He stepped forward and placed a clawed hand on his chest. His voice changed soft, aching:

""Her beauty is too bright... Her silence was too loud. Wouldst thou draw her shadow and wear it as a shroud?""

Then, quickly, he stood. Turned to face the false moon.

“Alas, she is too fair, too wise…”


The King took a step forward closer to the painted moon.

""O, teach me how I should forget to think.”

He reached out and dragged his claw slowly across the paper surface of the moon backdrop. The faceless crowd erupted into a standing ovation. He turned to face me, his ember eyes like stars. And just like that, the lights went out.

The dark was total all except his glowing yellow eyes, which grew brighter, sharper. It was all I could see.

The blackness melted around us, and I was no longer in the theatre.

I was back in the hallway of the covered paintings.

Only now, they were all uncovered.

Where his claw had once touched the painted moon, there now hung a portrait. A regal thing. He wore Tudor finery: velvet doublet, ornate cane, black cape trimmed in gold filigree. He looked almost human in this one save for the antlers curving from his skull and the way his mouth never quite ended. His eyes were distant, glassy, like a painting trapped inside itself.

I stepped down the hallway, and more versions of him emerged from the darkness as if every wall remembered him differently.

In the next, he was a war-chief from some forgotten saga: a fur cloak draped over armor several sizes too large, dwarfing his narrow frame. A bronze helmet buried most of his face, but two great highland cow horns burst from either side like roots breaking stone. He held a round-painted shield in one hand and a chipped battle axe in the other. His stance was strained, like he wasn’t used to carrying so much.

The third canvas was strange, quieter. He stood beneath a vermilion sky, his skin ghost-pale and stretched tight over a wiry frame. His chest bore inked symbols that bled like veins. He wore layered shoulder guards shaped like roof tiles, and a wide straw hat cast most of his face in shadow. Two long, gnarled horns more like a mountain goat arched from the edges of the hat, cutting upward like crescent moons. His posture was patient. Waiting.

But the last one stopped me cold.

This version of him felt older than the others, not ancient, but primal. His body was bone-white and traced with clay patterns, winding around his arms and legs like labyrinths. His legs bent back like a horse’s, hooved and powerful. Long, tangled hair poured from his head like a black waterfall. He wore a feathered tunic that whispered movement even in stillness. From his crown made of sticks, two great horns rose tall and straight stabbing into the painted clouds above.

I stared for a long time. Every iteration so different but similar in the smallest ways, there was always horns, ember eyes, a monstrous jaw and a crown of some form.Then, barely louder than a breath, I asked:

“What… are you?”

He moved. Suddenly. Snapped out of his statue pose and stepped forward, hunched like a beast, like a wolf stalking prey. His eyes lit the hallway.

“I was born the day your kind first carved firelight into a cave wall,”
“and I will die when you all forget your names.”

It didn’t make sense. Not then. Maybe not now either.

“What do you want from me?” I asked.

He crept closer.

“To finish what you started.”

“The sketches?” I said.

His reply came like a curse, hissed and cold:

“Three days. Three nights. You will either join the collection or your work will.”

I wanted to move, run, anything but I was frozen in place. He reached forward and etched a scratch across my chest. It didn’t bleed. It wasn’t painful. It was a mark. He leaned close, until his burning eyes were inches from my face.

“Three dusks… three dawns… An eternal glory… or a forgotten memory.”

Everything went black And then I woke up in a cold sweat and with a phantom pain in my chest his words still echoing freshly in my mind. At the time, I was still convincing myself it was all just a dream. Trying to rationalise it, contain it.

I got up in a shamble and got dressed. I had a history lecture bright and early, so I grabbed my bag and left. As I walked through the campus corridors, nothing felt right. I felt sick and hungover, almost but I hadn’t touched a drop of booze.

Once I sat down in class, the sickness dulled, but everything still felt blurry. That’s when my chest started to burn. I left quietly, slipped into the toilets, and splashed some water on my face — but when I looked down, I saw a small red stain on my shirt. I undressed and found not a wound, but a scar. Fresh. Healed, but the skin around it was tense and tight.

There wasn’t much I could do, so I pulled my shirt back on and returned to class.

The rest of the lecture passed normally until the end. Everyone else had left, and I was catching up with the professor about something I didn’t understand. I said goodbye, stepped into the corridor… and everything changed.The hallway was empty. Not just quite empty.

I glanced out the window. It was sunset. But beyond the glass, instead of city streets, there was an endless field of wheat swaying in the wind.

Behind me, the door I'd just closed rattled violently a deep bang, like someone trapped inside, pounding to get out.

I called out sheepishly, “Hey, you alright?” Looking back, I should’ve run. But like a lamb to the slaughter, I stepped closer.
The banging grew steadier, shifted from panicked strikes to a rhythmic beat almost like a clock.

Then the door flew open.

A void on the other side pitch black until two glowing ember eyes lit up inside it. A claw gripped the doorframe. And then he followed, crawling through, too large for the doorway, his body hunched, limbs spidery and unnatural.

He stepped forward, towering, his voice crawling through my spine:

“Three days. Three nights. And yet you waste your precious time.”

He lunged, grabbed me by the collarbone, and lifted me like a rag doll. With his free hand, he held it out as if performing a magic trick then opened his palm. A brass pocket watch lay inside, swinging gently. His voice was cold and far away:

“Progress is your only lifeline, artist.”

He shoved the watch into my hand and let go. The second I hit the ground, it felt like getting slammed in the head with a baseball bat. I blacked out.

Next thing I knew, one of my classmates was shaking me awake, his face pale with panic.

“Hey dude, you alright? You need a nurse?”

The corridor now full of people half looking down in confusion, the other not caring. I got up, dazed. Shook it off, badly. I don’t remember exactly what I said, probably something like I’d pulled an all-nighter and passed out from exhaustion. Part of me even believed it.

Until I looked down.

Wrapped around my wrist was the brass pocket watch.

Even now, as I write this, it’s sitting across the room on my desk. Real. Solid. I can hear the tick of its mechanism. I can smell the faint metallic scent it left on my fingers.

And I still can’t bring myself to believe it.

Because if the watch is real…
Then he must be real too.

I’m going to wrap this up and try to paint. I don’t know if I’ll be able to sleep tonight, knowing he might not be just some bad dream.

I don’t know what he is.
Honestly, I don’t know if I want to find out.

If I wake up tomorrow… I’ll tell you if I see him again.
But I’ve got a feeling he’ll find me first.",1,1753836803.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False
1mcstjk,https://www.reddit.com/r/FAAHIMS/comments/1mcstjk/preparing_for_a_hims_consult_with_a_mh_history/,Preparing for a HIMS consult with a MH history?,"Hi all, I have been trying to learn about getting a medical despite mental health history. I plan to schedule a consult with a HIMS AME but I'm also trying to learn more about the best way to be prepared for the consult, what exactly to expect etc. especially because my situation is kind of a mess.

I know the process is expensive & time-consuming, it's my history that has me really nervous though. With a lot at stake I want to make sure I'm going in as prepared as I can.

Some background:

* Currently in my mid 30s, not currently on any psychiatric meds. Honestly life is really good right now, I am happy off meds and prefer it that way.
* When I was a kid my parent (who is very much not mentally stable) shopped me around to a bunch of psychologists, psychiatrists, etc. to get them to diagnose me with whatever. To be honest I don't know for sure what I was diagnosed with/everything I was medicated with but I remember my mom saying I was bipolar, autistic, etc. like I was in special ed and everything. I have since caught up with teachers who have been like yeah we remember you, we all could tell your home situation was shit and none of this was actually true, but not much we could really do.
* My therapist who I started seeing shortly after I moved out of home (& is my therapist again now) agrees with me that I was without a doubt an anxious kid from bearing the brunt of family trauma & dysfunction but absolutely no signs of autism, bipolar, major depression, anything like that.
* Unfortunately I experienced a very violent traumatic event in the late 2010s and it took me a couple of years to heal both physically & psychologically from that. I am pretty sure I was diagnosed with PTSD during that time, fortunately I haven't had any post-traumatic symptoms in years.
* Until last fall I took Adderall for 1-2 years because my most recent psychiatrist thought I might have ADHD. I stopped taking it because I realized that I probably just needed more sleep (I was working like 60-75 hours a week plus overnight on call). Last year my job situation became MUCH better and I found I really don't need ADHD meds at all, just a coffee if I didn't sleep well lol.
* I stopped seeing a psychiatrist almost a year ago and still with my current therapist, before that I cycled through a few different providers due to frequent moves from like 2015-late 2019.

Part of why I am posting this is that I'm nervous about what previous therapists/psychiatrists diagnosed me with, especially when I was a kid because of how little power I had over a frankly awful situation. I do know my current therapist has me at adjustment disorder and my last psychiatrist put ADHD, if it means anything they've both stated they'd write a supportive letter on my behalf.

Do I go to the consult first and just try to explain all of this as best I can? Do I first try to contact any therapists/psychiatrists I can recall having to get all diagnosis/medication-related records, and THEN schedule the consult once I have them? Or only doctors I had up until x number of years ago? Do I bring records to the consult, or wait for the HIMS AME to tell me what they actually want?

Also - anything else I should keep in mind to help things along/not fuck myself over? Or based on this history alone, am I already fucked lol.

Thanks so much, I really appreciate any and all advice.",2,1753836752.0,FAAHIMS,0,1.0,False

I’m a red team engineer with custom firmware on my router and a Faraday cage around my smart toaster.

I showed up 10 minutes early, hoodie on, laptop in hand, booted into a hardened gentoo distro I compiled myself. She opened the door holding a MacBook Air. Chrome had 43 tabs open. I almost left right then.

I asked for her network topology diagram. She laughed. “It’s just the router from the ISP.”  
Alright, I thought. Let her have it.

I popped open her router admin panel. Default password: *admin123*. The SSID was ""PrettyFlyForAWiFi"". I ran a `nmap`scan. 12 exposed ports, 3 outdated IoT devices, and a printer running telnet. No firewall. No VLANs. Just raw digital nudity.

I asked if she ever noticed weird lag. She said “yeah sometimes Netflix buffers.” I said that was probably because her TV was being used in a botnet out of Kazakhstan. She blinked twice. ""Oh no, is that bad?""

I offered to segment the network and install pfSense. She said she “just wanted Spotify to stop cutting out.”

I airgapped her Sonos out of pity.

After 20 minutes of work, I asked for her phone to remove TikTok and clean the app permissions. She said “but I need it for filters.”  
I looked into the distance. Deep sigh. I looked out the window and whispered, *""The panopticon isn’t metaphorical.""*  
She asked if I was always this intense.  
I said no, only when the NSA is listening. Which is always.

She offered coffee. I declined, caffeine raises your attack surface.

When I left, she said, “Thanks, you’re like, really good with computers.”

I walked away slow. Her router was still on UPnP. So was my heart.  
You can't patch people. Believe me, I tried.

1mcsowi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1mcsowi/wtf/,WTF?!,"I agreed to work at a science summer camp. The gist is I plan 3 weeks of activities, the camp will provide the materials I request for those activities. 

I sent my plan on July 8th. The plan had a detailed description of the lessons and the materials students were using. Got a ""thanks for sending it."" Sent the plan again on July 14th. ""Thanks"", and my contract. At this point, no mention of needing a dedicated materials list or any other tasks.

I show up last Monday. The camp was supposed to start at 9:15. Registration was such a mess that I didn't get campers til 1:10. No materials/guidance. I spoke with my director and sent a materials list that evening with his promise that we would have them Wednesday. On top of it, I spent 5+ hours Monday afternoon/evening and my own funds for the kids to experiment with slime recipes the next day.

The kids enjoyed the slime on Tuesday.

Wednesday rolls around. No materials. Kiddos watch Bill Nye and the magic school bus.

Wednesday evening I again spend hours and hours at like 4 different stores across the Bronx, Manhattan, and Brooklyn (including finding a specialty electronics store) to scrape together the materials (on my own dime) that would allow kiddos to do the activities I originally planned for the week.

Thursday: kiddos are happy. 

I spoke with my director again, who seemed blissfully unaware of what he told me on Monday. I show him the materials list on my phone. He said send it to him again. 

I sent the list again, and quantified the amount of my own funds I had used for materials. He said to submit receipts for reimbursement, and that we would have materials on Monday.

Friday: happy kiddos again.

I am also questioning to myself if I really needed 16 cans each if play doh and whoa dough, as well as 7 packs of model magic.

Monday morning: no materials.

Morning class: the college student in charge of that group's management decides that showing 4th graders Five Nights at Freddy's is somehow appropriate. At this point, I don't know what else to do, but I warned him that showing a PG13 movie to elementary school kids without parent permission is in bad taste. I told him that if it causes a problem,he has to take full responsibility for that decision. The 16 cans of play doh came in handy because the kids wanted to play with it during the movie.

Meeting with director: he has acquired 6 mini tubes of glue and one bag of coffee stirrers. No cardstock or tape, which I had requested for Monday. He referred to a print out of my materials list.

Afternoon class: handed out model magic to the kids to make something to take home. Kids were happy to play with play doh and whoa dough for the rest of class.

Monday evening: 4 more hours of chasing down materials in multiple stores.

Tuesday morning: the morning group's counselor says he did get in trouble for Monday. I did check in with the director and told him that I didn't have materials, so how were we supposed to do the activities. Students worked on engineering bridges out of construction paper. Will continue tomorrow.

I speak with my director again this morning. He has a few things for next week and has magically conjured 2 more bags of coffee stirrers. Says to send him the materials list again. I point out that this is the 3rd time since camp started he has asked for it. He gives me a b.s. excuse if he has 8 teachers to manage supply orders for. I guess he's never been a department chair at an actual school.

Tuesday afternoon: my younger group does not have their group leader. The kids build marble runs. They are happy to have something to do. They will start their bridges tomorrow. I manage to get them to dismissal only 5 minutes late.

I'm pretty pissed. What would have taken the director 20 minutes to order off Amazon, even if we needed massive quantities of certain things, required about 13 hours of unpaid work and over $700 of my own money just to give the kids an experience.

Also: the camp didn't have scissors, pencils, blank paper, glue, or coloring utensils until I bought some. I told the group leaders to spread the info on the DL that if they need supplies I probably have them.

I'm exhausted. And if I do not have materials next week, I may show the younger kids Blair Witch Project. I'm pretty like that.  ",1,1753836384.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

I (F37) stopped talking to B (F36) and S (M36) after I was not invited to their wedding, even as a guest. Here's the thing; I knew them both for years and we were all friends. We even all worked together in two different cities across the country. Gym buddies, roomies, the works. 

Some facts about me that are relevant to the story so keep in mind: I am blunt but not rude, I'm healthy, very tall, and attractive. I liked basketball, volleyball, soccer, etc. Boys harrassing me all the time. I hated the attention. She was also attractive but short and struggled a little with weight fluctuations so she asked me to exercise with her. She loved the attention and called herself a whre in a joking manner often. We were both poor making minimum wage at part time jobs because all jobs became part time after the law changed and employers did not have to pay health insurance for part timers. This happened right before we graduated hs. My parents kicked me out at 18 so I couch surfed and stayed in my car at times I didn't have an apartment. She lived with her mom who was also making minimum wage after her self inflicted bitter divorce. Her siblings were older than her and already out of college and out of state. (Yes her mom was also a giant btch). Sns. Her brother wanted nothing to do with them. There was no excuse for her behavior towards me. Later learned she didn't like my family because they could afford to eat out often, and she was the waitress. She was jealous and rude. Her ex husband divorced her for it. He's the one I worked for and always had a job to come home to if I wanted. He was a good boss. 

Turns out she was a frenemy. She admitted this one drunken night (the last time we ever hung out) by telling me she actually always hated me but had no one else to hang out with. B is a self proclaimed btch since day 1 when I met her in high school. Everyone was aware of this (which is why she didn't have many friends) but I did not know anything about red flags back then. We were friends in hs but not real close besties until college and beyond. We took a few classes together. We would hang out almost every day even if it was only for a quick cup of coffee at the local shthole. (We did not have any real coffee shops in a small town). We had Pinterest boards for wedding ideas without having steady relationships lol small town boredom at it's finest. We just loved design. I was also in an abusive relationship at the time. She also claimed she could not do long distance friendships and that also was a lie since her friend (F35-""T"") from school moved 2,000 miles away. They hadn't talked for a few years at this point. 

Now S. S and I also went to hs together. We had a few classes but were not close. Did not hang out outside classes until we started working together and even then it was not often. He got a job where we were both working and we all were in different departments at first. They started hanging out and literally ditching/ghosting me on occasion. Not inviting me to the gym for example. Making inside jokes at my expense. Whatever, I knew they were secretly pinning for each other but they wouldn't admit it. Took a couple years and the move to another city before becoming officially bf/gf. 

A few years of work go by. We all worked in the same department by now. B was getting ""in"" with our manager and she was a total btch and openly hated me and made my life at work miserable. Total mean girl energy. I don't play that game. I started looking for another job because I was not about to be abused by someone like that. (Story for another day, she was terrible. Multiple people made complaints about her bad management includingother managers). B and S were getting all the good stuff at work so they did not want to leave. That's fine and I celebrated their wins. As real friends do. 

Fastforward to my new full time job at a very nice, well known place (sorry, no names. I loved that job) with great pay and hours, and my part time job as a fill in at a temp agency. I did things like working at hotels, private condos, medical packaging plants, etc., whenever possible so I was working around 80 hours per week and going to the gym to avoid going home. (Another story for another day! So I'm a DV survivor.) They moved in together and made plans to get married. We all talked about it often. I wasn't directly asked to be maid of honor but it was heavily implied. I was asked about the bachelorette party, design ideas, etc. Then I had an opportunity to move so I took it. I told her I could still help out since I did not move very far away but far enough away to get out from under my abusive ex. Communication from their end halted. Thought they were busy, and I was still settling in. They got married a year or so later. The plan was for 4 years later, not one. I didn't even know about it. I would have made the trip to go had I been invited. Turns out I was not invited but T was, and was a bridesmaid. One of only two. They just started talking again. B stated she could not have someone hotter than her at her wedding ""stealing the show"". Frankly I find that mindset pathetic. T had filled me in on everything years later so that's how I know for sure.

I didn't know they got married until they posted pictures. That was the end of it all. I deleted all of them from my phone and socials. I even blocked them so I wouldn't have to see it. It was all a complete slap in the face. A couple years go by and I run into her brother who asked why I wasn't at the wedding. I told him everything and he was shocked and he laid into her HARD. I'm glad he did. Neither B or S ever apologized for the way they treated me. (It was lots of other small things too not just the wedding like S selling me faulty computer, etc). Now neither of them will come near me in public XD. It definitely hurt but I did not deserve any of that but a good handful of ""mutual friends"" thought otherwise. Some said I should have crashed it anyways, some said it was on me to reach out and try to be a part of their day and show support. I was literally helping them plan it! So I said F no. Now many of the mutual friends are no longer on my socials either lol I can't believe some people thought I was in the wrong. They tried to blame me (and yes some said i should have known she wouldn't want me there to outshine her! TF?!) and I would call them all out to their faces. No regrets there. Be better people. Some did feel bad after learning what happened. T would never publicly defend me but I showed the receipts to people who had asked or called me a liar. That shut them right up and very few apologized.

I’d love a place with a sense of community, creativity, and emotional intelligence—somewhere it’s not weird to be introspective or into personal growth.

Bonus points for dog-friendliness, good coffee, sunny weather, and potential to meet a great partner in my age range (late 20s to 30s).

Places I’m not considering: super remote small towns, anywhere deep red politically, or ultra-pretentious tech bro cities.

Would love any suggestions or personal experiences. ",1,1753835791.0,relocating,0,0.67,False

1mcsgf5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mcsgf5,"“How to go from idol to awkward in 3, 2, 1… ”","Okay but… who even is Dylan anymore? Like genuinely, I don’t recognize him. Maybe I’m not close enough to say he “changed,” but the difference is so in your face it’s kinda sad.

People love to say “he just matured,” but nah—this ain’t maturity. He used to be so grounded, sweet, respectful, and just super chill and warm on camera. Now? In interviews, red carpets, whatever—he gives off weird energy. He makes these so-called “jokes” that don’t even make sense, like… did someone pass him a blunt before the interview? It’s awkward to watch. Like secondhand embarrassment level awkward.

And can we talk about the way he dresses now? Bro looks like he hasn’t changed clothes in a week. Same outfit over and over. If you’ve been paying attention, you know he’s been repeating the same clothes for days—and I’m sorry, but I 100% believe this is Rachael’s influence. Back then, Dylan used to serve even just to go grab coffee. Now it’s giving “depressed guy who hasn’t showered in three days and lives in sweatpants.”

Honestly? I feel like Rachael wants him to look like that just so she can be the one who pops in the relationship. And yeah, people will say “Dylan’s a grown man, he dresses himself”—sure, but ever since she moved in, he’s been stepping out like he just rolled out of bed. In pajamas. Regularly. Like it’s his brand now.

Also, what’s going on with his face lately? His eyes look swollen half the time—either he’s not sleeping, he’s sick, or… he’s high. And let’s be real, it wouldn’t be shocking. Rachael’s been smoking weed forever, so it’s not hard to imagine she dragged him into that too.

Let’s not forget—when Dylan was with Britt, the photos they posted were actually cute. Like those cheek kisses? You can tell someone else took those. It felt natural. Real. Not forced. But now Rachael’s trying to recreate those same moments like… girl, we see you. We know you know those pics with Britt hit different and now you’re trying to outdo them. It’s not working.

Oh, and one more thing—Dylan’s brother Julz? He doesn’t follow Rachael. And guess what? She doesn’t follow him either.
But he still follows Britt. And even has pics with her up on his page.

1mcsaiw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mcsaiw,Sharing my experience: Outlander tour from Edinburgh with Highland Explorer tours!,"I've just returned from a month long trip to the UK and thought I'd share my thoughts on my Outlander themed guided tour we took with Highland Explorer tours from Edinburgh.

**Visit details:**

HE's office is located on the Royal Mile, a little over halfway down towards the Holyrood side. This meeting place was super easy for us as we were only a 5 minute walk up the road. 

We visited in early July on a mostly pleasant day with some scattered showers.

Edinburgh was our last stop in Scotland after a 10-day road trip where we got to see other filming locations or places that are relevant to Outlander, such as Culloden Moor, Glencoe etc.

  
**Stops:**

* **Midhope Castle (Lallybroch)**: We had about 30-40 minutes here which allowed time for photos and the audio tour (via QR codes scanned on your phone) though I faffed about and spent more time taking photos than anything. You can't go inside as it is completely derelict so this was a photo stop but an iconic one of that. If you missed your chance to get a coffee before the tour, there's a coffee truck out the front of the castle.

* **Doune Castle (Castle Leoch):** I believe we had an hour here, perhaps a bit longer. You can enter the castle and explore a fair bit of it which was lovely. There are sparse furnishings in some rooms but this was a fun visit knowing what it was used for in Outlander. Bonus is that in addition to the usual audio tour on the castle, there is also a shorter Outlander audio tour narrated by Sam himself that tells you about filming details etc. We couldn't walk the walls and ramparts while there as they were closed for restoration.

* **Culross (Cranesmuir):** This stop was a bit underwhelming for us. The village is lovely and quaint but there isn't much to see really. We had our lunch in Culross and there are fairly limited cafes with basic menus so in hindsight probably should've brought a sandwich with us for the road. 

* **Falkland (1940s Inverness):** Similar to Culross, this was a quick stop that's pretty much known just for the main square that featured in the show. We had about 30 minutes here that was more than plenty. Highly recommend getting a Mac n' Black pie while in Falkland - delicious.

* **Blackness Castle (Fort William):** For background, Blackness was used as Fort William as the original Fort William is now just a ruin (note: not to be confused with the town of the same name which made for a great stop en route to Skye on a rainy day - the West Highland Museum was fantastic \[and free\] and had a great exhibit on the local area and the Jacobites). This was my favourite stop of the day as there were so many different parts you could wander into. Nothing is furnished but Blackness has a really cool history that I enjoyed generally, and the views were great too. I could have easily spent way longer than the hour we got here.

**Final thoughts:**

Our tour guide was absolutely lovely and we had a great day. 

If I were to find myself back in Edinburgh, I'd probably hire a car rather than do a guided tour to do things at our own pace  - I'm an Aussie so used to driving on the left but chose not to hire a car because Edinburgh is an old city that's not the most fun to drive in/out of from what I'd be told but perhaps had we not been there in peak season, I would've hired one so we could DIY our experience.

I chose this tour because of the inclusion of Culross and Falkland (compared to other tours offering stops like Linlithgow Palace, Callender House, Hopetoun House etc) because I thought we'd be castle-d out. In hindsight, these places were iconic from an Outlander perspective but otherwise a little underwhelming for me personally from a historical perspective.

With that, because I am a history nerd, I enjoyed the stops at Doune and Blackness Castles the most because those were the places you could really wander and explore and got lots of information on.",4,1753835264.0,Pishlander,0,1.0,False
1mcs9me,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1mcs9me/does_the_ed_even_care_about_suicidal_people/,Does the ED even care about suicidal people?,"22F. I attempted suicide three times in the past week or so via failed polysubstance overdoses. I mixed alcohol, Xanax and codeine, none of which I have a large tolerance for. I’ve blacked out a large portion. Yesterday I ended up in the ED when I woke up with coffee ground emesis. I have had GI irritation/ulcers for a while, and it seems the drugs I took severely exacerbated the issue (codeine-ibuprofen mix). I was conscious but weak, dehydrated, and confused, and they discharged me once my vitals were stable with a PPI prescription. I never told them about suicide, and just said I drank a few shots the night before while partying.

I thought I wanted to live but apparently I still don’t. I could try again, because I still have the drugs and alcohol available, but I’m terrified of no success and further injury. I’ve just been in this cycle of passing out before I can take enough drugs, and I don’t want to suffer. That’s the whole reason I’m doing this. I can feel happy, momentarily, but my life has become so unbearable and agonising that I can logically no longer take it. Momentary joy chemicals in my brain don’t change that I simply just want peace and no more suffering, and life will not give me that. But I just won’t fucking die. I don’t want to hang myself, jump, or drown. It’s too violent and the risk of paralysis or disfigurement is too large.

So of course, the advice is, you know, go ED and tell them how you feel! Yeah, right. Do they actually even care if I show up saying that? I was admitted in the same hospital for a quasi-suicide attempt (self-aborted overdose) when I was 13, so maybe the history will make it slightly more likely anyone cares, but I doubt it. They are busy, overworked, and lacking in staff, beds, and resources. Why on earth would anyone give a single shit about a person whining when actual people are being resuscitated at the very same moment? I don’t see how they would give a single damn.

## Key Features Analysis

The selection of a 60-inch round patio table involves a careful examination of its construction, materials, and design elements. These factors directly impact the table's longevity, aesthetic appeal, and suitability for various outdoor environments.

**Tabletop Material:** The material used for the tabletop is a crucial factor in determining the table's durability and resistance to weather elements. Common materials include aluminum, wood, resin wicker, and tempered glass.

A Tabletop made of aluminum is lightweight, rust-resistant, and easy to clean. Wood tabletops, such as teak or acacia, offer a natural and warm aesthetic but require regular maintenance to prevent warping or cracking. Resin wicker provides a durable and weather-resistant option that mimics the look of natural wicker. Tempered glass tabletops are sleek and modern but can be prone to scratching and require careful handling.

**Frame Construction:** The frame of the patio table provides the structural support and stability. Look for frames made from durable materials like powder-coated aluminum or steel.

Powder-Coated aluminum frames are resistant to rust and corrosion, making them ideal for outdoor use. Steel frames are strong and sturdy but may require additional protection against rust. The frame's design should also be considered, ensuring it provides adequate support for the tabletop and is aesthetically pleasing.

**Weight Capacity:** The weight capacity of the patio table indicates the maximum weight it can safely support. This is an important consideration if you plan to place heavy items on the table, such as large serving dishes or decorative objects.

A Higher weight capacity ensures the table can withstand the load without buckling or collapsing. It's always best to choose a table with a weight capacity that exceeds your expected load to provide an extra margin of safety.

**Weather Resistance:** A patio table's ability to withstand various weather conditions is essential for its longevity. Look for tables that are specifically designed to resist fading, cracking, and rusting.

Materials like teak, aluminum, and resin wicker are naturally weather-resistant. Tables with powder-coated finishes offer added protection against the elements. Consider the climate in your area when choosing a patio table, as some materials may be better suited for certain environments than others.

**Style and Design:** The style and design of the patio table should complement your existing outdoor furniture and décor. Choose a table that reflects your personal taste and enhances the overall aesthetic of your patio or deck.

Patio tables are available in a wide range of styles, from traditional to modern. Consider the shape, color, and finish of the table when making your selection. A well-chosen patio table can become a focal point of your outdoor living space.

## FAQs Section

Addressing common consumer questions about 60-inch round patio tables provides valuable insights and helps potential buyers make informed decisions.

**What is the ideal material for a 60-inch round patio table in a coastal environment?**
Aluminum and resin wicker are excellent choices for coastal environments due to their resistance to salt air and moisture.

For wood, use a wood cleaner specifically designed for outdoor furniture. For tempered glass, use a glass cleaner. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as they can damage the table's finish.

**How do I choose the right size patio umbrella for a 60-inch round patio table?**
A patio umbrella with a diameter of 9 to 11 feet is generally recommended for a 60-inch round patio table. This will provide adequate shade for everyone seated at the table. Ensure the umbrella base is heavy enough to support the umbrella in windy conditions.

I've had pulsitile tinnitus in my left ear along with random vertigo attacks & clusters since may of 2024. 

It happened suddenly I woke up a week after taking a flight to SC and it was just there. It's intermittent and can sometimes be wooshy and airy and sometimes intense thumping along with the airy whooshing. I have had it every day with varying intensity when it comes to how loud and noticeable it is. Sometimes it's defening and I can't focus or hear shit and sometimes it's barely noticeable at all. 

My doc thought it might be ustachian tube dysfunction so I went on a round of antibiotics and steroids which only worsened my symptoms and sent me into vertigo hell for a week. The vertigo attacks I get maybe once or twice a month but past week I had multiple attacks in a day and one that lasted around 15 minutes and left me significantly mentally impacted for a couple days after. 

Edit: after the round of steriods and antibiotics -I was sent to an ENT who identified that when I pressed on my carotid on that side it went away but I can't just hold my finger their all day so I was referred to a radiologist who never got back to me so I got referred to another ENT who i couldnt see for 6 months who let me know it could be vascular malformation near my ear or a tumor and ordered MRI's of my head neck and brain. I had three MRI's two days ago (head neck and brain with and without contrast) and they came back squeaky clean even no bone or tissue abnormalities. I'm beyond frustrated and feeling hopeless to find any answers. I'm now waiting to get back in to my primary to work out what to do next. A friend of mine suggested mentioning the fact that the headphones they put on me in little head vice and cage in the MRI pressed on my neck causing my tinnitus to go away for the duration of the scans and that maybe it effected the results, but my mom said that doesn't matter and it might just be I need to go on a medication or lifestyle change to treat my symptoms without knowing a cause. 

what makes my PT worse: 
head positioning, turning my head to the right, looking up, being dehydrated, higher blood pressure/stress, not sleeping enough, not eating enough, bending over,  yawning for some reason.

Some background I'm female, 23, a little overweight, hypermobile, I also have nerve pain from an accident I was in (I was a pedestrian struck by a vehicle) 4 years ago, I used to be heavy into energy drinks for about two years (3 monsters a day during covid) now for the past two years I havnt had more then 1 small cup of coffee a day. I have vaped nicotine since 18 cuz i was a dumb teen (no disposables im scared of heavy metals and no modded vapes) and i cut down on that to only a 2.5 strength nicotine juice. Tried quitting and that only lasted 4 months on the patches.I have no underlying health issues other then a slight egg intolerance (egg yokes) and red meat makes my inflammation worse (nerve pain), and IBS all my life. 

Some info on my vertigo attacks:

Happens 1-2 times a month but during the first 6 months it happened almost once a week. 

Took these notes after my most recent episodes:

""vertigo attacks""

Small (short less severe) (2-5 minutes)
-nausia
-feeling hot
-going pale
-weakness full body
-feeling off balance
-ear ringing (different then pulsitile tinnitus and only happens during)
-feeling like my head is swelling up
-feeling flush
-lightheaded
-feeling like the blood is rushing out of my feet and legs
-can close my eyes for a short period (a few seconds) and not feel like I will immediately throw up

After: a little weak and tired and a little harder concentrating, but I can bounce back after a little while

Big (long and debilitating) in addition to most of the symptoms above: (5-15 Minutes)
-unable to stand 
-unable to lift arms
-unable to speak fluently + slurred speech
-unable to think of certain words
-unable to do fine motor skills without intense concentration 
-unable to concentrate
-reading slowly
-extreme brain fog
-neck feels swollen
-need to lay down on my back 
-need to keep my eyes open or I feel like everyhing is spinning around and I'll vomit

After: 
can't do anything for at least an hour
Can't focus for shit
Still very weak but I feel the blood going back into my arms and legs
Extremely tired

Sometimes I feel them coming on sometimes they hit without warning and without trigger or after doing something that triggers it (turning my head too fast being the only one I can think of currently) 

I'm struggling with feeling hopeless and need advice on how to move forward and what to do with my doctors to try and figure out what's happening to me. I don't want to live with this for the rest of my life. I'm giving out all this info because I'm desperate it has impacted my already shitty mental health and I don't know what to do.

Imagine my shock and awe when I went to the Capital One shopping app yesterday (the 28th) and got an offer for 12% cash back on a MacBook online at Best Buy…

while Best Buy is doing a $799 deal for the 2025 MacBook Air.

My jaw dropped to the floor and I was so excited because I had literally JUST ordered a MacBook Air from the same deal on Amazon plus $50 cash back from their store card (making it ~$750) but the 12% from Capital One was going to make it ~$700. FOR A BRAND NEW MACBOOK!

I’ve been thinking about buying one for over a year, started looking into them a couple months ago, even went down to the Apple store three times this month to look. When they went on sale, it felt like divine timing. 20% off a brand new product I’ve been wanting to buy for years! Waiting pays!

And 12% back on top of that hefty discount. I couldn’t believe it. It was the deal of a lifetime. 

I was ready to cancel the Amazon order immediately and wait for that sweet sweet $100 cash back reward even if it took six weeks. It felt like I won the lottery.

But my card got declined. I thought, oh, maybe it’s the single store card I made for Best Buy. I tried the original virtual card. Declined.

I refreshed the Capital One app. “Restricted.”

Great. 

The credit card company who approved me for a credit card have prevented me from making a big purchase with the credit card they gave me. Woohoo, good job guys!

“Please call us as soon as you can at (customer service number) so we can clear things up for you right away.”

When I actually called them: 

“Sorry ma’am, you don’t have your card, we can’t verify the phone number connected to your account (even though the robot before the call started says ‘the phone number you’re calling from is verified on your account. how may we help you today?’) and the only way for us to verify you is for you to wait 10 business days and lose out on all of the reasons you bought this card. Sucker.”

Now the cash back MacBook offer is gone. And my account is still restricted. 

I’m honestly never going to forget this. My first week of ever using Capital One, and the only way for me to reinstate the account they approved me for is to send their customer service representatives my driver’s license, a bank statement, and my apartment lease.

This is an absolute joke. ",2,1753835028.0,CapitalOne_,6,0.67,False

Summary

Between university lectures, late-night study sessions, and shifts at her favourite local bakery, Annabeth Chase barely has time to breathe—let alone think about love. But when she meets Percy, the temporary new hire covering for a sick coworker, her carefully structured world starts to shift. What she doesn't know is that Percy Jackson isn’t just any charming, flour-dusted stranger—he’s a globally famous musician, hiding out in plain sight.

Their connection is easy, magnetic, and completely unexpected. As their paths continue to cross over coffee, pastries, and quiet moments between the noise, Annabeth starts to realise there’s more to Percy than he lets on. Behind every song he’s written lies a memory, stitched together with stories he’s never told—until now. But some memories are harder to share than others, and not all of them are sweet. As old stories resurface and new ones begin, Annabeth finds herself caught in the space between the past and what could be.

I was so stoked to roll up to that four way stop at the same time. Your car is beautiful. That green wrap is absolutely amazing. My wife and I were so stoked when you waved back and also goodbye. Only people who drive these cars know how special they are. You made our day... and we had already had a pretty good day 🤣. 

We just got this car on Saturday and it's been a lot of fun. A whole lot a fun.  If you end up seeing this and want to do a GRC and coffee somewhere in Portland, I am so down. 

I'm super bummed we didn't get a pic of your rig. We were in the moment and didn't even think about ruining it with a phone.  It's burned into my mind though. It's beautiful 🥹.

1mcs7b3,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/1mcs7b3/how_i_stopped_chasing_the_perfect_first_draft_and/,How I stopped chasing the “perfect first draft” and finally started finishing what I write?,"For most of my writing life, I believed my biggest problem was discipline. That I just wasn’t focused enough, or didn’t have the right routine. I thought the secret to writing was waking up at 5 a.m., drinking black coffee, typing 2,000 words, and doing it again the next day like some literary machine.

But the truth is, I wasn’t lazy. I was obsessed with getting it right the first time.

I would write 500 words, stop, go back, rewrite the first sentence 6 times, spiral into self doubt, and then give up by the third paragraph. Not because the story wasn’t good. But because I couldn’t handle seeing it look wrong. I wanted it to be perfect from the start clean, tight, flowing, publishable on first export.

And when it wasn’t, I felt like a fraud. I thought, “Real writers don’t struggle this much.”

Spoiler: they do.

Everything changed for me when I stopped treating the first draft like a finished product. Instead, I started treating it like a conversation with myself. The first draft isn’t writing, it’s discovery. It’s where I meet the story for the first time where the ideas are ugly, the pacing is weird, the dialogue is awkward, and none of it has to make sense yet.

Now I write like I’m whispering to myself in the dark: “This is where she realizes he lied.” “Maybe he kills the guy here, maybe not.” “The ending isn’t clear yet but I’ll figure it out later.”

It’s messy. It’s chaotic. But it’s alive.

And guess what? When I get to the end, I actually have something worth editing. Something real. Not just a graveyard of abandoned Chapter Ones with perfect opening lines and no middle.

So here’s my actual advice, if you’re stuck like I was:

* Stop judging your writing while you’re writing it.
* Accept that the first draft is meant to be garbage.
* Make notes in the text like a friend would. Talk to yourself.
* Finish it badly on purpose.
* Save the real “writing” for draft two. That’s where the magic lives.

I know this isn’t revolutionary. But it took me years to unlearn the lie that good writing = good first drafts. It doesn’t. It means surviving the bad ones long enough to get to the good stuff.

If you’re drowning in unfinished pieces and overthinking every sentence, this might be the thing that finally sets you free.

It did for me.

1mcs67e,https://v.redd.it/k54fgs8lnwff1,Is this channeling or issue with pre wetting? [QM67/Baratza ESP],"I just upgraded from GCP to QM67. Today I was trying to pull a shot and I prepped my puck as usual (I use a rotary wdt tool before tamping).
It was an 18g basket with 18g of coffee in it. 

When pulling the shot, I tried to do the ""lever dance""; turn on the pump for a second, lower it to mid position and wait a few seconds, and then turn the pump back on. As you can see, the espresso drops started appearing on one side of the basket and when I turned the pump back on, it continued extraction mostly from that side and I could see spaces with zero flow. Is this an issue with channeling or with me trying to pre-infuse without flow control? Any help will be appreciated.

Should I stop trying to pre-infuse my shot? It didn't taste half bad. I was less bitter and a tiny bit sour. But I'm not sure if I should grind any finer?",1,1753834919.0,espresso,3,1.0,False

1mcs57a,https://www.reddit.com/r/coworkerstories/comments/1mcs57a/i_think_my_coworker_is_passive_aggressively/,I think my coworker is passive aggressively treating me different and its making me gaslight myself.,"So i 20F have been working at this coffee shop since the beginning of this year. This specific coworker had gotten hired after me a while after. At the beginning Ive had no trouble with them, i even tried to make small talk as i try to make friends with everyone there. Everything was cool up until they started getting bossy. This one time in particular i had asked them a simple question, “ has anyone swept the lobby yet” and they said “no but you can go help so and so with this.” And i just kind of stood there like thats not what i asked but okay?. Anyways i ignored that interaction and just went to sweep the lobby.

The interaction rubbed me a little wrong so i texted my other coworker who i am the closest to (they’re also close friends with this person) and i asked them if they were promoted to shift lead or something. My coworker responded with no and then i explained what had happened. All i got from them was a “its not that serious” and i was like ok? Anyways 2-3 weeks later i hear of 2 other coworkers having the same problem with them and now suddenly it has become “serious”(this isnt the first time this has happened to me at my job btw).

They eventually got promoted after that interaction so i was like whatever thats fine. Fast-forward to a couple days ago they posted a reminder in the group chat about a couple of things mentioning that they think the task list shouldn’t be written on by a regular employee and that the shift leads should be the only people assigning tasks to make it “equal and fair”. They said other things which i thought were very hypocritical but not too much on that right now. Anyways today i come into work for a closing shift and this is the first time I’m closing and I’m closing with them. First thing i notice is that they have assigned people for tasks with me getting 1 shitty task so idk how that is fair or equal at all but whatever.

I finish the task and find something else to do. Literally everything i find to do they come up after me and re do everything i do. This happened multiple times, bumped into me without saying excuse me or sorry and never bothered to teach me what they do for closing. Another coworker was walking me through closing tasks so i dont think theyre really shift lead material if they dont even bother trying to teach me anything. Anyways my problem with this is that I feel like something is directed towards me because I don’t see them doing these things to anyone else but me, and I also feel like these things are very borderline that you can excuse it for something else so I feel like it’s all very passive aggressive. Idk i feel like im either overreacting or going crazy.",3,1753834840.0,coworkerstories,2,1.0,False

## ⁢Key Features Analysis

The following are essential product features.

**Material Quality:** The quality of the material used in the sleeve's construction is paramount. ⁤Durable materials like ballistic nylon, polyester, or neoprene offer excellent protection⁢ against wear and tear.Premium sleeves frequently enough feature water-resistant or waterproof coatings to safeguard against spills and moisture damage.

A⁣ sleeve ‌crafted from high-quality⁢ materials not only protects your laptop ‌but also enhances‌ its aesthetic appeal. The choice of material can also influence ‌the ‌overall weight and bulkiness of the sleeve ensuring the best option.

**Internal dimensions:** Ensuring the sleeve's internal dimensions perfectly fit your 16-inch laptop ⁢is crucial. Too tight, and it may be difficult to insert and remove the laptop. Too loose, and the laptop may slide around inside, reducing the effectiveness of the protection.

Manufacturers typically provide internal dimensions in their product descriptions, so compare these‌ to your laptop's dimensions before purchasing.A Sleeve with a ⁣snug, secure fit is⁢ ideal ‌for optimal protection.

**Impact protection:** The level of impact protection offered by the sleeve is a critical consideration. Some sleeves incorporate padded compartments⁢ or reinforced corners to absorb shocks‍ and minimize damage ⁢from accidental drops or bumps.

Look for sleeves that meet military-grade drop​ test standards or feature specialized ⁤impact-resistant materials. The ⁣amount of padding in a sleeve will determine the impact resistance as a whole.**Additional Storage:** many laptop ‌sleeves‍ include extra pockets or compartments for storing accessories such as chargers,‌ cables, mice, or tablets. these additional storage options can be incredibly convenient ⁣for travelers or anyone who wants to keep their essentials organized.Consider the size and number of storage pockets based on your specific needs.​ Some sleeves even feature dedicated spaces⁢ for pens, ‌buisness cards, or smartphones.**Design and ⁣Style:** Laptop sleeves come in a wide range of designs ⁤and styles, from sleek ‌and minimalist to bold and colorful. The aesthetic appeal ⁤of the sleeve is a personal preference, ‌but it's worth ⁤considering how well it complements ⁤your overall style.

A Sleeve can be more than⁣ just a protective accessory; it can also be a fashion⁢ statement. Choose a design that ‌reflects your personality and makes you feel confident.

**Portability:** While providing ample protection, a good laptop sleeve should also ‌be lightweight and⁤ easily portable. Bulky ‌or heavy sleeves can be cumbersome to carry around, especially if you're already carrying a laptop and other​ accessories.

Look for⁤ sleeves with a slim profile and comfortable handles or shoulder straps for added convenience. Weight of the ‌sleeve matters!

1mcs3yk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1mcs3yk/i_need_honest_options/,I need honest options,"I have been in a relationship for almost 4 years now, I was very in love with my boyfriend, when I was barely 18 years old I made small savings and moved to another country where he lived, I left everything, studies, my pets, work, friends. And I went from a country with a future to another with a small city in which there clearly was not much exit. 

To tell it briefly, my boyfriend is not the most responsible person, at first he earned money but through not very legal methods and in the end he couldn't continue doing it, that's why I worked and supported the two of us, instead going to the other country to save a little more.
He always chose his friends and his pastimes before me, many times I had to fall asleep alone because he was always busy with some things or he went to his friends' garage and I was left alone waiting for him, many times he insulted me or spoke very rudely to me or yelled at me. We fought a lot. It was as if we could never understand each other, that's why every time we left the house ended in an argument. I couldn't share any of my opinions with him because he got irritated by everything. Every time I tried to make him something, like for example coffee in the morning, if he didn't like the taste or it didn't have enough sugar, he would get angry with me and scold me, his attitude often hurt me, I cried a lot about it.

I'm not a saint either, I know, I had my mistakes but I always tried to be good with him, I did a lot for our relationship. I don't want to leave him as the worst, we also had our beautiful moments, we played a lot and laughed out loud, when we were at a distance because I was going to work in the other country to bring in more money, if I was sick or I cried he tried to console me, and told me to quit work now and come back. But good moments have been few compared to the bad ones.
And I have a lot of appreciation and affection for his family.

What I'm telling all this is that... 
I have been abroad for almost 10 months now, when I had to be only 2 months, I delayed so much for various reasons, but all those reasons are also an excuse not to return… 


More and more I doubted whether I should go back, I began to understand that I need to continue studying because I cannot work as a waitress all my life, that in the country where I am I can get papers (I am in Spain and having a residence here is a great advantage) and that in the country where he lives I do not have any kind of future, furthermore this country is at war (Ukraine).

My mother was convincing me to spend more time, to save more money and so I listened to her.

Where I am working I have a colleague, with whom I became friends at first, and soon with his good treatment towards me he began to attract me more, in addition to the friendship he began to flirt with me. 
I, tired of my boyfriend's treatment, decided that I do want to leave him with him, because because of the calls he continued to be rude to me, he almost never called me, I always did it and he still reproached me for things and never saw my effort. 
Like I said, I wanted to leave him with him, but I'm a coward, I couldn't do it. Besides, I understood that if I leave him with him, his mother is going to cry and it bothers me to think that his family is going to hate me, and I love them very much... The issue is that without being able to break up with my boyfriend, I started “something” with my co-worker, it is not a relationship but we treat each other as such... as you can understand, I did something horrible, I cheated on my boyfriend...

I keep talking to him on the phone, my boyfriend doesn't know anything, I don't dare break up with him, also when they are there in times as complicated as the war, I know they are excuses and the truth is always better than a lie, but I really don't see myself capable 

They are all waiting for me back, and every time I promise that I will be back soon, and sometimes I think about whether it is better to go and tell them everything in person, even if I want to finish.

But I don't know if it's a good idea and I don't know if I'll be able to…

Sorry for so much text, I wanted to give you a little context. I need your honest opinion and some advice. I know that the solution is obvious but if someone had something similar, I think they will understand that not everything is so easy and obvious.

I wanted to share it here because it's inside me and it's killing me, but I can't share it with anyone.

I know I'm a horrible person, I feel terrible for what I did. There is no excuse for that, but even so, when one is damaged, one sometimes seeks reconciliation in another person, but as I already said, it is not an excuse to commit such a betrayal.

I await your comments, thank you for taking the time)

1mcs0wf,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mcs0wf/i_dont_know_what_else_to_do_i_think_my_dream/,I don’t know what else to do I think my dream might come true.,"okay so. i don’t really post on reddit, i mostly just lurk and read weird stories when i can’t sleep or whatever. but something happened and I guess i’ve seen people share similar storys like this on here before so maybe someone will know what i should do?

anyway. i’ve always had really vivid dreams. like full on movie dreams, colors, smells, stuff that actually feels like i’m awake. it’s been like this since i was a kid. and sometimes, really small things from my dreams will happen. nothing crazy. like one time when i was 12 i had a dream that my mom used buttermilk instead of regular milk in her coffee and spit it out all over the floor. next morning, she grabbed the wrong milk carton and yeah… just like I saw in my dream

it’s always just been little stuff. my friends joke i’m like a witch or some fortune teller or something lol. they say “have any dreams about my next hot date?” like it’s funny. and it is usually light stuff.

but lately the dreams have been getting like louder? i don’t know how to explain it. more there? they feel heavier, and things keep lining up. more than usual. like i’ll dream i get a weird text from someone, and then i do. or i’ll dream about a commercial i haven’t seen in years and then it pops up the next day on youtube. stupid stuff. still small, but too many in a row.

so a few years ago, i had this dream about the house a few doors down the street. in the dream, i saw this guy break in through the back door with gloves on and steal a bunch of stuff. it was super fast and weird, like watching security cam footage. a few weeks later, my neighbor actually got broken into. back door. they took some prescriptions she left out and electronics. she told my mom and i felt SICK. like what the hell am i supposed to do with that?

and now this is like what i need help with. last night, i had a dream that my best friend died. but like she was murdered.

it was awful. i don’t even want to write it all out but i saw her lying on the floor in her apartment. there was blood. her front door was open and her cat was crying. it was so vivid it woke me up and i couldn’t breathe. it felt real. it still feels real. like it happened already and i just watched it from the wrong timeline or something.

i called her today. she’s totally fine. she laughed at me when i said I had a bad dream but like i didn’t tell her what it was about. how am i supposed to say that?? “hey haha i dreamed you got murdered, maybe lock your doors tonight”? 

but i can’t stop thinking about it. it won’t leave my head. i keep seeing the details, like how her plant by the window was knocked over, and there was this weird song playing on her phone, something she never listens to. and she was wearing her favorite hoodie. the blue one with the stains on the sleeve.

what do i do, should i tell her? I really dont want to freak her out, stuff like this she hateeesss so what if i make it worse? i know logically it is like probably nothing but I havent been able to sleep, im so scared to wake up to a call knowing I didnt do anything.

1mcrzlr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mcrzlr,My Sister Stole My Husband Novel: Interested in the full version? Comment and I'll send the link right away.,"Chapter 1 Betrayal
It was already dark when Danica went back to the villa. She had given the maid Kelsey a day off and sat in the darkness alone, not bothering to turn the lights on.
She then sat by the dining table, surrounded by silence and darkness.
The table of dishes had gone cold, and the cake in the middle with the words ""Happy birthday, Honey"" stung her eyes.
The surprises she had prepared and she were nothing but a joke.
In everyone's eyes, Jennifer and Wayne were a golden couple, and they all knew how much Wayne doted on her. Yet, a car accident three years ago left him in a vegetative state. And shortly after that, Jennifer vanished without a trace.
Then the Vance family brought Danica back from the countryside and forced her to marry Wayne in Jennifer's place.
Danica agreed readily after learning her groom was Wayne, the man she had always loved deeply.
After getting married, she took care of him attentively, becoming a full-time housewife who seldom went out or socialized. Finally, he woke up after three years in a vegetative state.
She pulled out a lighter and lit up some candles.
Through the dim light, she saw her own reflection in the mirror—a housewife in a black-and-white dress forever, dull and rigid.
On the contrary, Jennifer was now the lead principal dancer, the living embodiment of youth, vitality, and beauty.
She was the ugly duckling.
Jennifer was the swan.
Jennifer was still Wayne's choice now that he had awoken.
""He'll spend his birthday with me tonight."" On her husband Wayne Hamilton's birthday, Danica Vance received a text from an unknown woman.
It wasn't the first time.
The woman attached a selfie.
The photo didn't show her face.
Only her bare legs and a used condom could be seen.
Clutching her phone, Danica felt a wave of nausea.
Danica grabbed her bag and headed straight to the Nimbus Hotel.
She'd see for herself who that woman was.
Upon reaching the hotel entrance, she saw her mother, Liliana Watson, and her father, Rodney Vance. Stepping forward in surprise, she said, ""Dad, Mom, what are you doing here?""
Liliana and Rodney were stunned. They immediately exchanged a glance and then looked away, not daring to meet Danica's eyes. ""Dani, Jenny's back to the country. We're here to drop her off.""
Jennifer?
Through the dustless floor-to-ceiling windows, Danica saw Jennifer Vance and instantly froze.
The blue-and-white dress Jennifer was wearing was identical to the one in the photo.
So, the woman was her sister Jennifer.
Ever since high school, Jennifer's biggest hobby had been stealing others' boyfriends.
And now, she set her eyes on her brother-in-law.
Danica couldn't help but laugh sarcastically. She turned around to look at Liliana and Rodney and asked, ""You both knew she was hitting on Wayne?""
Rodney pulled an awkward smile. ""Dani, Wayne doesn't love you at all.""
Liliana echoed, ""He's right, Dani. You know women in Marinburg are lining up to be with Wayne, right? Rather than let others take him, why not give Jenny a chance?""
Danica couldn't help but clench her fists. ""Dad, Mom, I'm your daughter, too!""
With that, she turned to leave without hesitation.
Suddenly, Liliana's voice rang out behind her. ""Danica, did Wayne touch you?""
Danica paused.
Rodney said, his words harsh, ""Danica, stop acting like we owe you. Back then, everyone thought Jenny and Wayne were meant to be. We only agreed to let you marry him in Jenny's place after his accident left him in a vegetative state.""
Liliana sized her up with disdain. ""Look at yourself, Danica. Over the past three years, you've been nothing but a housewife. What do you have left without Wayne? But Jenny? She's the lead principal dancer. You're nowhere near as good as her. She's the swan, and you're the ugly duckling. Just get a divorce so that they can finally be together—that's what everyone wants to see.""
Her words were like a sharp knife, stabbing Danica's heart ruthlessly. She silently left, her eyes brimming with tears.
***
Only now did she realize the previous three years were nothing but a dream.
Wayne didn't love her, but she loved him deeply.
They said whoever fell in love first was destined to lose. Thanks to Wayne, she lost completely.
She blew out the candles as tears welled up in her eyes.
The villa once again plunged into endless darkness.
Just then, two bright headlights shone into the living room—it was Wayne's Rolls-Royce Phantom, which soon came to a steady stop next to the lawn.
Danica's eyelashes fluttered slightly. He was back...
She had thought he wouldn't come home tonight.
Soon, the door was opened. As she felt the slightly cool night breeze, a tall, slender figure came into her view. Wayne was home.
The Hamilton family had been top-tier in Marinburg for over a century. As the future heir of the family, Wayne had shown extraordinary business talent since childhood. At the age of sixteen, he obtained a double master's degree from Brenton University. After graduation, he listed his first company in Wilsonville, which expanded rapidly. After he came back to the country, he officially took over the Hamilton Group and became the richest man in Marinburg.
Wayne walked into the dining room and his deep, magnetic voice carried a trace of detachment. ""Why didn't you turn on the lights?""
Then a soft click rang out.
He turned on the wall lamp.
Danica instinctively closed her eyes for a second upon feeling the sudden brightness. When she opened them again, she looked at Wayne.
The custom-tailored black suit he was wearing accentuated his handsome face. His perfect proportions, coupled with his innate icy, noble temperament, made him undoubtedly the Prince Charming of Marinburg's socialites.
Danica looked at him. ""Today's your birthday.""
Still expressionless, Wayne lifted his gaze a bit and glanced at the table. ""Don't bother next time. I don't do birthdays.""
Danica curved her lips. ""You don't do birthdays? Or you don't wanna celebrate them with me?""
Hearing this, he glanced at her, but only for a second. Then he quickly averted his gaze, as if not wanting to waste another second on her. ""Whatever you think.""
Then he walked over to the stairs.
He had always been like this when facing her.
There was nothing she could do to win his favor.
She stood up and said while watching his cold retreating figure, ""It's your birthday, so I wanna give you a gift.""
Not stopping or looking back at all, he said, ""That won't be necessary.""
Smiling slowly, she said calmly, ""Wayne, let's get a divorce.""
He had already set one foot on the staircase. At her words, he paused abruptly and then turned around, his deep gaze locking onto her.
Chapter 2 Let's Get a Divorce
Danica was looking at him, too. She repeated softly yet firmly, ""Let's get a divorce, Wayne. Do you like this birthday gift?""
Wayne said expressionlessly, ""Are you making a scene because I didn't come back for the birthday?""
She smiled, ""Jennifer's back, right?""
Hearing Jennifer's name, Wayne scoffed coldly.
He walked toward Danica step by step. ""Does that bother you?""
He was the youngest titan of the business world, carrying an overwhelming presence, which was the result of power, status, and wealth. As he approached Danica, she instinctively took a step back.
In the next second, the icy chill of the wall seeped through her clothes as she realized she had nowhere to retreat.
Just then, Wayne's shadow engulfed her as he propped one hand against the wall behind her, sealing her in with his broad chest.
Wayne looked down at her, sneering, ""Everyone in Marinburg knew Jennifer was the one I was supposed to marry. Didn't you know that when you went all out to marry me in her place? If you weren't bothered back then, why are you making a fuss right now?""
Danica's face turned pale.
He was right. Jennifer was supposed to marry him.
She would never have had a chance to be his wife if it weren't for that accident.
She'd never forget the undisguised disappointment and coldness in his eyes the day he woke up from the coma and saw her.
They had slept in separate rooms since their marriage, and he had never touched her.
She knew very well that Wayne loved Jennifer.
But...
She gazed at his handsome face, which gradually overlapped with that of the youthful boy from her childhood, and thought, ""Wayne, you really don't remember me?
""It seems I'm the only one who's stuck in the past.
""Forget it.
""I've loved you for years. It's time to let our three-year marriage mark the ending of my love for you.""
Suppressing the bitterness and pain in her heart, she said, ""Wayne, let's end this sexless marriage.""
Hearing this, Wayne arched an eyebrow and repeated, ""Sexless marriage?""
He lifted his hand, pinched her delicate chin, and pressed against her rosy lips with his thumb, saying suggestively, ""So, that's why you want a divorce. Are you that horny?""
A rosy hue spread across Danica's cheeks instantly.
That wasn't what she meant!
As he exerted more force to press and rub her lips, she was stunned—it had never occurred to her that such a handsome, refined man could be this frivolous.
He was actually playing her lips with his thumb.
It was the first time Wayne had looked at Danica at such a close distance. She wore a black-and-white dress and a pair of oversized, black-framed glasses all year long, looking no different from an aged woman.
It was only now that he noticed her palm-sized face, her breathtakingly beautiful features, as well as her crystal-clear, doe-like eyes hidden behind those glasses.
She had soft lips.
The spot where his thumb pressed would appear bloodless, but once he unpressed it, it'd bounce back and seem even more rosy.
Somehow, he found the urge to kiss her.
His gaze deepened as he said, ""I'm surprised, Mrs. Hamilton. It turns out you're so desperate for sex.""
Immediately, a loud smack rang out.
Danica slapped across his face.
Apparently, she had exerted great force—his face tilted to the side.
Furious, Danica trembled all over, thinking, ""How dare he humiliate me like this! Sure enough, loving too humbly breeds only self-degradation.""
She snapped, feeling both humiliated and furious, ""I know you still can't get over Jennifer all these years. I'll step out of your way so that you can marry the woman you truly love.""
Wayne's expression darkened immediately. From the day he was born, he had always been treated with utmost respect. No one had ever dared to disrespect him, let alone slap him.
He looked at her, his gaze piercing. ""Danica, you married me because you wanted to, and now, you're divorcing me because you feel like it? What do you take me for?""
Danica chuckled. ""A toy.""
What?
Her answer left Wayne stunned.
Swallowing her bitterness, she said with a sneer, ""That's right, you heard me. You're just a toy I snatched from Jennifer. And now, I'm fed up with you and no longer want you.""
Wayne squinted dangerously. ""Good for you, Danica. You want a divorce? Fine. You have it. You better not come crying to me to get back together.""
With that, he went upstairs and entered the study, slamming the door so hard that a deafening sound echoed in the villa.
Danica slowly slid down the wall, feeling utterly exhausted.
Crouching on the carpet, she wrapped her arms around her frail body. ""Wayne,"" she muttered, ""I won't love you anymore.""
***
Early the next morning.
Kelsey pushed open the door to the study and walked inside.
Wayne, a well-recognized workaholic, was reviewing documents in his chair.
Kelsey called out to him, ""Mr. Hamilton.""
He didn't even lift his head. Apparently, he was in a foul mood. Even the air around him was freezing.
Seeing this, Kelsey cautiously put a cup of coffee on the desk. ""Mr. Hamilton, Mrs. Hamilton brewed this for you.""
His hand holding the pen paused as his expression softened a little.
He thought, ""Is this some peace offering?
He asked, ""Has she owned up to her mistake?""
Kelsey gave him a strange look. ""Mr. Hamilton, Mrs. Hamilton left.""
Stunned, he looked up at Kelsey.
She handed him a piece of paper. ""She left with a suitcase. And she asked me to give this to you before she walked out of the door.""
Wayne took the paper over and unfolded it. In the next second, the words ""Divorce Agreement"" came into his view.
He was stunned—so, the coffee wasn't some peace offering at all.
Just then, Kelsey said, ""Mr. Hamilton, Mrs. Hamilton wanted you to finish the coffee and sign the papers.""
His cold gaze fell upon the coffee. ""Pour it out. I don't want a drop left.""
Wayne's expression darkened completely. He glanced at the divorce papers, in which Danica stated that she'd leave with nothing willingly.
Just then, he suddenly squinted because he spotted the reason for the divorce Danica handwrote.
""My husband suffers from sexual dysfunction and fails to fulfill marital duties.""
Wayne pulled an extremely long face.
That damn woman!
Immediately, he took out his phone and called her.
Soon, the call connected. She said, her voice as crisp as ever, ""Hello.""
Chapter 3 You're Impotent
Wayne pressed his thin lips into a straight line. ""Danica, get your ass back here. Now!""
Danica smiled, ""Why should I? Just because you want me to? Wayne, we're divorced. I don't have to take orders from you anymore.""
Wayne said through gritted teeth, ""I'll give you a chance to rewrite the reason for the divorce.""
She smiled even more heartily, ""No need. I didn't say anything wrong, did I? Wayne, it's been six months since you woke up from the coma, but you have never even held my hand once. Though you seem healthy now, you were a vegetable for three years after all, and I have every reason to suspect you're impotent. A piece of friendly advice—go and see a skilled doctor as soon as possible. Hope you can 'get back on your feet' soon.""
Wayne said nothing.
He could feel the veins in his forehead throbbing.
How dare she!
""Danica, I swear I'm gonna make you realize how wrong you are sooner or later!""
""Oops, too late. That's not gonna happen.""
""Danica!""
Utterly furious, he was about to lash out when he heard the beeping sounds.
She hung up.
Gnashing his teeth, he snarled, ""Danica!""
***
Meanwhile, Danica was in the apartment of Florence Conway, her bestie. Florence chuckled as she hung up and gave her a thumbs-up, saying, ""Kudos, Dani. I bet Wayne is burning with rage right now.""
Florence glanced over and noticed Danica had eaten a pile of candies.
She decisively dragged Danica to stand up. ""Chin up, Dani. You've got your freedom back, and that's what's important. You're single now! I'll order eight male escorts to get you a divorce party tonight!""
Danica smiled helplessly.
Florence suddenly reached out, took off Danica's glasses, and tossed them into the bin.
Danica bent over to pick them up. ""My glasses...""
Florence stopped her. ""Dani, you've buried in your research for too long. It's time to get rid of those thick glasses. Think about Jennifer—you should also dress up.""
All of a sudden, Liliana's words echoed in Danica's mind—""She's the swan, and you're the ugly duckling.""
Maybe Wayne thought so, too.
Florence pulled her out of the door. ""Let's go shopping. I'll take you to do your hair and nails and buy you clothes. Let's prove all of them wrong. Wayne will be slack-jawed at seeing how pretty you are!""
She suddenly thought of something. ""Dani, are you sure you don't want his money?""
Danica said, ""I have money.""
""Jennifer will be so thankful to know you've left her with all the money.""
Danica parted her lips but didn't know what to say.
""Where's the card Wayne gave you?"" Florence asked.
Wayne, always generous, had given Danica a premium black card, but she had never used it.
She found it in her bag and blinked playfully. ""Tonight's on Wayne then.""
***
Night arrived.
1996 Bar had always been the most popular spot in Marinburg where trust fund kids squandered their money. Tonight, as usual, its dance floor was packed with people, moving in a frenzy to every exaggerated sweep of the DJ's arms.
Under the dim lights, Wayne sat on the main seat of the VIP booth. He was wearing a black shirt and suit pants tonight, with his sleeves rolled up a little, revealing his firm forearms and a seven-figure watch on his wrist. Many women in the bar couldn't even take their eyes off his strikingly handsome face.
The person sitting next to Wayne was Emilio Griffin, the heir of the Griffin family, and they were accompanied by a few other wealthy heirs.
Emilio burst into laughter. ""What did you say, Wayne? Danica wants a divorce?""
The rest laughed, too. ""Everyone knows she's your simp, Wayne. She married you without hesitation when you were in a vegetative state. Why the heck would she leave you now?""
""Let's make a bet on how long before she comes crawling back to Wayne.""
Emilio said, ""I bet she won't even last today. For all we know, she might text Wayne in the next second.""
Wayne, however, pulled a long face. Clearly, he was in a bad mood.
He took out his phone and pulled out his chat interface with Danica on WhatsApp.
Their last conversation happened last night. She sent him a photo of the soup she made and texted him, ""Honey, I know the test results show you've recovered perfectly now, but I still want you to have something more nutritious. I'm waiting for you at home.""
As he scrolled up, he saw nothing but the messages she had sent him.
She texted him every day, but he had never replied to her.
Never.
His phone was exceptionally quiet today because she didn't even text him once.
He felt irritated, though he didn't know why.
Suddenly, his phone dinged.
It was a text.
Emilio immediately said, ""What did I say, guys? I bet it's Danica!""
Before anyone could say anything, Wayne's phone dinged a few more times.
He received several messages in a row.
The men around them couldn't help but laugh. ""We all knew Danica would regret it, but who would have thought she'd give in so quickly?""
Emilio urged, ""Wayne, check them out. Let's see how desperate she is.""
Wayne arched an eyebrow slightly, thinking, ""Did Danica text me after all?
""What's the point of pulling such a stunt then?
""So much for her pride.""
He tapped the screen and was stunned in the next second.
Emilio leaned over and read the text out loud, ""Dear VVIP customer, your card ending in 0975 has been charged 130 dollars at Fancy Nails.""
The rest were puzzled.
As Wayne scrolled up, he saw that Danica had spent 300 dollars at Grace Salon, 14 thousand dollars at the Chanel boutique, and 40 thousand dollars at the Louis Vuitton boutique.
It was never about Danica wanting to get back together with him.
All he received was bank notifications.
No one said a word.
They somehow felt being slapped by her.
With a livid face, Wayne slammed his phone onto the table. He couldn't care less how much Danica had spent. What annoyed him was the fact that she went shopping right after their divorce. Good for her!
Over the past three years, she had done whatever he asked, not complaining once. But suddenly, she became a completely different person.
Emilio said, ""Wayne, what's gotten into Danica? She actually bought new clothes and even got her nails and hair done? Is she trying to copy Jenny's style?""
""Jennifer is the Muse in Marinburg, but she's just a bumpkin from the countryside. No matter how she tries, she's just gonna make a bigger fool of herself.""
""Hasn't she learned? The ugly duckling can never become the swan.""
Everyone was ridiculing Danica.
Suddenly, a commotion drew their attention. They looked over, and someone exclaimed, ""Gosh, am I dreaming? Is that an angel?""
Chapter 4 Play With Fire
Danica was here.
After the shopping spree, Florence brought her to 1996 Bar where the divorce party was held.
It had never occurred to Danica that she'd run into Wayne and his lot, and of course, she heard their ridicule.
She knew those men around Wayne. They were all part of the upper class in Marinburg, and Emilio was the closest to Wayne. Back then, everyone in Marinburg had known that Jennifer and Wayne were an item, and these men had all been fond of Jennifer. Emilio even called her ""Jenny"".
Over the past three years, none of them had actually accepted Danica.
Since Wayne didn't love her, of course, his friends wouldn't treat her with any respect.
Florence heard their conversation, too. Furious, she rolled up her sleeves and was about to charge over. ""I'm gonna beat the crap out of them!""
Danica stopped her. ""Forget it, Florence. I'm divorced already, right? Pay no mind to what they say.""
The calmness on Danica's face seemed genuine, and Florence held back with difficulty. As more and more people turned to look at Danica while addressing her as ""angel"", Florence was instantly in a better mood. ""Let's go, Dani. We're gonna have some serious fun!""
She brought Danica to a VIP booth and waved her hand. ""Get all the male escorts here!""
In another VIP booth, as a few playboys mocked Danica nonstop, they suddenly felt a sharp, cold gaze.
They looked up, only to see Wayne, in the main seat, glance at them lazily.
There was coldness, displeasure, and warning in Wayne's eyes.
The grins on their faces froze, and they fell silent at once, not daring to badmouth Danica anymore.
Meanwhile, Emilio gazed at Wayne, thinking, ""Though Wayne has never taken Danica seriously, she has indeed taken care of him attentively for three years. I guess it means something to him after all.""
Just then, the commotion in the bar grew bigger. ""Such a beautiful angel!""
Angel?
Where?
Emilio looked over and was instantly slack-jawed. ""Fuck me! An angel indeed!""
Those playboys were equally stunned. ""Since when did Marinburg have such a beauty? None of us has ever seen her before.""
Emilio elbowed Wayne. ""Wayne, look! An angel!""
Wayne's gaze lingered on the ""angel"" for a few seconds. Somehow, he felt that he had seen her somewhere before.
Just then, several male escorts went to Danica's booth and stood in front of her, each and every one of them had a stunning face and an exceptionally nice figure.
Florence smiled, ""Go ahead, Dani. Pick eight.""
To celebrate that she was finally out of her misery, Danica decided to have some proper fun. ""You... You... And you. Stay.""
Meanwhile, Emilio was counting. ""Gee, did she just pick eight of them?""
One of the playboys teased, ""Why waste money? At her beckon, we'll be more than happy to keep her company without charging a penny.""
Everyone laughed.
Just then, Wayne's phone dinged again.
It was another bank notification.
He picked up his phone to see what Danica had bought this time.
""Dear VVIP customer, your card ending in 0975 has been charged 80 thousand dollars at 1996 Bar for ordering eight male escorts.""
Wayne froze. He read the words ""eight male escorts"" a few times before looking up at ""angel"" sitting opposite him.
It was Danica who had just ordered eight male escorts.
He was slightly slack-jawed.
The eight male escorts surrounded Danica and started to pour wine into her glass. ""Pretty, let's play a drinking game.""
Florence beamed. ""Yeah, why not?""
Danica lost the first found, and one of the male escorts fed her wine. ""Drink, pretty.""
Danica emptied the glass, which upset the others. ""This is so unfair. Why did you drink the wine he offered you? What about us? We wanna feed you wine, too.""
Danica felt bittersweet—what should she do to make sure none of them feel left out?
Watching them, Wayne squinted. He stood up and walked forward, his expression darkening to the utmost.
Emilio was stunned. ""Wayne? Where are you going to?""
While Danica was drinking, a hand with slender fingers reached out, grabbed her by the wrist, and picked her up from the sofa effortlessly.
Startled, she looked up, only to see Wayne's handsome face.
She was stunned for a second before struggling hard, wanting to break free. ""Wayne, let go of me!""
Wayne pulled her to leave with a sullen face.
Florence stood up. ""What are you doing, Wayne? Let go of Dani!""
Emilio and the others were dumbfounded, wondering if they had misheard. ""Dani?""
""That angel is Danica?""
""She's that ugly duckling? No way!""
""I had no idea Danica is this stunning!""
Emilio froze as he gawked at Danica, who was dragged away by Wayne. He muttered, ""Fuck me! Danica has totally changed—she no longer clings to Wayne and has become so breathtaking!""
***
Wayne yanked Danica forward, his broad hand locking around her wrist. His grip was as domineering and firm as the man himself, and no matter how hard Danica tried, she just couldn't break free.
Due to his long strides, she could only stumble behind him. ""Let go of me, Wayne!""
Suddenly, he flung her forward, and her delicate back slammed into a cold wall.
In the next second, he approached her, his figure blocking the light.
Trapping her between him and the wall, he said through gritted teeth, a cold, dangerous glint flashing across his eyes, ""Danica, you've got some balls playing with fire.""
Danica frowned. ""What did I do?""
Gnashing his teeth, Wayne fumed, ""Stop playing dumb. Look at how slutty you are.
What?
Slutty?
""Wayne, what's that supposed to mean?""
Wayne looked down at her miniskirt. ""Everyone can see your thigh. Is that what you want?""
Danica's skirt was indeed a bit short. Florence had picked it out for her.
In the mall, Florence had said while insisting that she put on this skirt, ""Jennifer thinks her legs are a piece of artwork? That's because you've never revealed your legs. Show everyone tonight who in Marinburg has the most breathtaking legs, Dani.""
Danica arched a delicate eyebrow. ""I take it that you've been looking at my legs then, Mr. Hamilton.""
Wayne was stunned.
Meanwhile, she leaned backward against the wall lazily, her beautiful eyes with a smile making her even more captivating. Then she slowly raised her right leg and grazed the crystal heel of her shoe against his ankle.
With his black suit pants sculpting his powerful, slender legs, he seemed the perfect illustration of icy elegance and restrained desire.
Danica raised her right foot, tracing his leg all the way up with her delicate, tender toes and rubbing against his calf titillatingly.
She was seducing him.
Or rather, it was a provocation.
Wayne shot her a cold glance. ""What are you doing?""
She smiled charmingly, ""Mr. Hamilton, whose legs do you like better? Mine or Jennifer's?""
Wayne looked at her, not responding immediately. The widow's peak on her forehead adds a touch of elegance to her striking face, and though she carried an innocent beauty, here she was, seducing him so boldly. The contradiction only made her even more irresistible.
He had caught a glimpse of her beauty hidden behind her thick, black-framed glasses, but as it turned out, she was more stunning than he had pictured.
Somehow, he felt that he had seen her face somewhere before.
Danica smiled charmingly, ""Mr. Hamilton, has Jennifer ever wrapped her legs around your waist?""
Wayne's face darkened. He leaned over to study her face more closely. ""You're so horny, Danica. You're desperate for men and even ordered eight male escorts at the same time to keep you company.""
He didn't answer her question about him and Jennifer, which was probably the best protection a man could offer a woman.
Danica thought, ""They dated at the most beautiful age of their lives, and their love was so passionate that everyone in Marinburg knew about it. I bet Jennifer must have clung that slender legs of hers tightly around his waist. Otherwise, how come he still can't get over her now?
""How lucky Jennifer is, having a cold-hearted man love her for all these years.
""No doubt that he's never used the word 'horny' to describe her.""
Though she was smiling, her crystal-clear eyes were devoid of any emotion at all. ""Yeah. You're right. Mr. Hamilton, you're impotent. Why can't I satisfy my needs? I want a divorce as soon as possible so that I can find the man who can truly satisfy me.""
Wayne thought, ""Did she actually just call me impotent again?
""And she wants to find a man who can truly satisfy her?
""I gotta teach her a lesson.""
He gripped her delicate chin. ""You're just saying this to provoke me, aren't you? Are you that interested in knowing whether I can satisfy you or not?""
What?
Danica was stunned.

The long sides are irregular, as is what will be the underside of the table. The irregularities will be retained as that is the look my wife wants.  What will be the topside is flat and roughly sanded.

I'm struggling with positioning  the legs so they are parallel.  I've come up with a plan for this, which I would be grateful for some feedback on.

My plan is to draw diagonal lines between corners  on the topside of the slab.  I think those lines should be at 45 degrees to the longitudinal axis and intersect at the geometric centre of the topside.

I can then use a 45° set square to draw lines  from the centrepoint that are parallel to the longitudinal axis of the slab.  I then fix the legs perpendicular to that centreline and they should be parallel to each other.

Will this work?

The other question I have regards stability.  My wife chose legs like these https://www.bunnings.co.nz/rapidhome-70-x-73-2-x-6cm-black-santos-steel-tube-table-furniture-leg_p0130253

Do I need to fix stretchers longitudinally to stop the slab sagging in the middle?

_Additional Info:_The timber is sapwood of an NZ conifer called rimu.  Although it's a softwood, it eventually dries  very hard. The slab is up to ~40mm (~1.5 inches) thick.

My name is Archie. I'm twenty-four. Single. Not great company at funerals.



Yesterday, I was boarding a plane on the other side of the country. A few hours ago I was driving like a mad man to get to this quiet little nowhere town that I had left behind. A few minutes ago, I greeted my mother and father, who I hadn't seen in nearly four years. Right now, I'm standing in a black suit, looking down at the closed casket that contains the remaining bits and pieces of my sister.



Piano music plays from every corner. 



I kneel and place my hand on the smooth mahogany surface.



""I made it, Sis. I came as soon as Mom told me.""



The wooden box felt cold to the touch.



""You would have liked the city. I knew it was far to travel, but I wish you could have seen it. Just once. I wish you would've visit...""



The words get caught in my throat. I rest my head against the casket. No one is watching, but I must hide my tears. It's instinctual.



My mother must have felt my sorrow from the other room. She came to me and placed her hands on my shoulders.



""It's okay, Archie. If you need to grieve, then grieve, my son.""



I stood up and hugged her. Tears streaming down my face.



""How'd she die, Mom? What happened?""



""Oh, my dear boy. We'll talk about it at the house.""



""But, why? Why can't I see her?""



Her voice, hoarse from hours of sobbing;



""Hush. Hush. We'll talk at the house.""



She patted the back of my head and together, we joined the rest of the mourners.



Back at the house; Mom, Dad & I gathered around the fire in the backyard. It was late. Stars twinkled in  the night sky. Barely any breeze. Normally, a night like this would be perfect, but there was a cold spot coming from Maggie's empty seat. 



We talked about a lot of things. How I've been doing these last four years. What I've missed around town. Who got married and who's getting a divorce. All the small town gossip. My mother lived for it. Hard to worry about your own troubles when you're thinking about the troubles of others.



She said much that night, but the topic she avoided was my sister's death. I could see why, but still, I came all this way to stare at a box? A box, which I had heard, contained a mangled mess of what was once my sister? I wanted to know what happened to her. I wanted closure.



Sensing something was up, my mother felt it was time for bed.



""Well, Archie. I'm glad you made the trip down. Stay as long as you like, you know it's been so long since we've seen you. I'd stay up all night if I could, but it's been a long day. Goodnight, my dears.""



She kissed my father on the cheek and they both locked eyes for a moment or two. They said nothing. My father nodded and my mother looked away. She kissed him again before entering the house.



As we both listened for the sound of the door to fully close, my father leaned in toward the fire. He stared at the flame, then at me. The light flickering in his eyes.



He reached in to his coat pocket, ""Well, Son;"" he said, pulling out a pint of whiskey, ""let's talk about your sister.""



He offered me the first swig and I took it. The whiskey kicked the back of my throat and gripped me with that ole' familiar burn.



""Dad. What happened to her? Why couldn't I see Maggie, today? Word is, she's not presentable."" I said, handing him the bottle.



He took three large gulps and barely flinched. He started at the bottle like it owed him an answer.



""Who told you that?"" He handed the bottle back.



""It was Johnny."" I said.



""Big Johnny or Little Johnny?""



""Big Johnny."" I said. ""I never really liked Little Johnny.""



""Ya, me neither. So, anyway. What's Big Johnny got to say?""



""Well,"" I paused. Trying to remember as the whiskey set in. ""He told me that they found her in pieces. Scattered across the grocery store. Some of her here, some of her there. From the deli counter to the checkout lane, she was just, everywhere. I heard the mortician was just barely able to put her back together.""



I took a large drink from the bottle and continued. ""I mean, how does that happen? Did she spontaneously combust? What... what happened?""



My father held out his hand for the whiskey. He eyeballed the remainder and drained the bottle clean.



He looked at me, fire still flickering in his eyes.



""Archie."" He said. ""Your sister, refused to hear the news.""



He stared at me, expecting me to understand.



""W-what?"" I said.



He never broke his focus. With more intensity, he repeated;



""She refused to hear the news. Now, I know you've been away for awhile, but don't tell me you've forgotten.""



I looked at him quizzically. He saw my confusion and leaned toward me, nearly sticking his face in the fire.



""Mr. Bad News, boy. Mr. Bad News got your sister.""



For a second, I questioned my ability to hold my liquor. I must have been drunker than I thought. Was my father seriously blaming my sister's death on some story the local kids told around campfires? Was this his way of making sense of things? Was this how he coped with it all?



My father continued.



""Did Big Johnny tell you that a week before her death, Maggie was telling everybody about how a stranger tapped her on the shoulder? That this stranger also dressed in purple and that he also asked her a question?""



I knew the story. I heard it all the time when I was growing up. Kids would blame all their problems on Mr. Bad News. In reality, life is hard. Bad things happen. People just look for excuses to explain the problems they face. For example;



When I was twelve, I knew a kid named Willie. He loved telling stories. The kind of guy that could talk both your ears off. Well, one day Willie told us after recess that a man had tapped him on the shoulder. The man wore a purple suit, with a purple hat. He was tall and skinny. Then, he asked Willie a question;



""Would you like to hear the news?""



Willie, not yet having learned that you shouldn't talk to strangers, said; ""Okay.""



The man in the purple suit then told Willie that his mother was a whore and that his parents were getting divorced.



We picked on Willie a lot after that. Until one month later when his dad discovered emails between Willie's mom and several younger men. Pictures included.



People get divorced. It happens.



I always figured that Willie saw the warning signs in his parents marriage and imagined some man telling him what his subconscious already knew. That his mom was a whore.



Another example, slightly harder to explain, was when I was nineteen, just before I left town. My cousin, Susan, told me a stranger had tapped her on the shoulder. A stranger in a purple, pin-striped suit. Wearing a purple hat. She said it looked like one of those ""pork pie"" hats.



The man asked Susan a question;



""Would you like to hear the news?""



She said, ""Sure.""



The stranger than proceeded to tell her that her husband had cancer and that she will die alone.



Now, this was kind of a mixed bag.



After hearing this, Susan told her husband to see a doctor. It turns out, he really did have an aggressive form of cancer. It is terminal and Susan is preparing for the day when it will eventually take Dan away. However, if they hadn't caught it in time, Dan may have already been dead by now. Getting checked when he did may have given Dan an extra couple of years he otherwise wouldn't of had. The stress of knowing did weigh on my cousin, though. The stress alone may have taken years off her life. Who's to say?



When I think back to all the other stories I've heard growing up, I'll admit, some were pretty convincing. I just can't believe it for myself and I can't believe my dad would use these stories as a way to explain my sister's death. Maybe it's just the whiskey talking.



We change the subject and ramble for another hour, listening to some old tunes we both like. The fire goes out and we shuffle in to the house, being careful not to wake Mom.



I go to sleep that night dreaming about Mr. Bad News.



\--- Act Two ---



The next day, I took a drive around town. Not much has changed. The video store is now a farmer's market. Some store signs got a new coat of paint. That's pretty much it.



I got a text from Big Johnny asking if I was still in town. If I was, he wanted to meet me right away.



I responded; ""Still here. Out driving. I'm on my way.""



""Hurry!"" He replied.



When I arrived at B.J.'s apartment, he was pacing back and forth.



""Archie! Oh, thank God!"" He said, gripping me in a bear hug and nearly lifting me off the floor. ""I'm so glad you're okay.""



""Ya, I'm fine B.J."" I wasn't fine. I was far from fine, but there was no sense in talking about it.



B.J. went over to the counter and poured us both a coffee.



""I'm glad you came, Archie. It's good to see ya."" He seemed jittery, like he had something to say and wanted to speed through the pleasantries.



""So, your sister. Remember what I said? About the way she died?""



""Ya, B.J. I remember. Thanks for telling me by the way. I wonder how something like that could of happened.""



B.J. looked up from his cup; ""I'll tell you how it happened. It was Mr. Bad News.""



I was surprised. Both my father and best friend were using this old boogeyman to explain my sister's death.



""What do you mean, B.J.?""



""I mean, before she died, she was telling people that she saw Mr. Bad News and rejected his offer.""



""Mr. Bad News isn't real. Honestly, I can't believe you'd even joke like that.""



""Oh, it's no joke, Archie."" He said, pointing his finger at me. ""Mr. Bad News is as real as you or me. I used to be a doubter, too, before I did the research.""



B.J. was leaning over the countertop with intensity. I could tell by the dark rings around his eyes that he hadn't slept in days. Probably up researching some dumb conspiracy theories like the Flat Moon Theory, MK Annihilation or Project Paper Beam.



There was a pause in the air. I knew he wanted me to ask.



I sighed; ""Okay, B.J., what research?""



He leaned back, grinning from ear-to-ear.



The next few minutes consisted of B.J. frantically trying to cram seventy-two hours of research in to a few short paragraphs. I'll give you a short summary, here:



There are sources going back as early as the late 1800's, mentioning a man in purple clothing offering to share some form of news with town locals or visitors. He was seen as a bad omen, as he would always prophecy bad luck; such as war, plague or famine. Many thought the man merely predicted diseaster, but others believed the Purple Man to be the cause of it.



B.J. also told me about this nursery rhyme:



""Tap. Tap. Tap.

On your back.

Would you like to hear the news?

Yes. Yes. Yes.

You must confess.

Or else he comes for you.""



That's all I could retain over one cup of coffee. I could see B.J. was getting worked up thinking about this stuff. He usually did. I tried to end the conversation.



""So, let's say this Purple Man, or Mr. Bad News or whatever; let's say he really is out there and he's been doing this for hundreds of years. What can we do about it? I mean, do we hang 'em? Shoot 'em? Drive over him with a tank? Kill it with fire? What's a guy supposed to do?""



B.J. scratched the back of his head with a mix of frustration and hopelessness.



""I don't know. I searched and I searched, but I couldn't find anything on how to hurt this guy."" He looked at me with sleep deprived eyes of desperation. ""There's got to be a way.""



I could tell B.J. wasn't feeling well. He had loved my sister, too. They never really had their moment, but in his mind, they could of. If it wasn't for her sudden death. I don't blame him, or my  father, for holding on to some fairytale as a way to solve the otherwise unsolvable mystery of Maggie's spontaneous combustion.



""Hey, B.J., I know Maggie meant a lot to you and...""



""Don't. Just don't.""



The tension held for a moment and we both froze in silence. Finally, I said;



""Hey, let's grab some beers before the store closes. We'll watch a movie or something."" I proposed, partly to change the subject, but also to keep an eye on B.J. He seemed like he needed the company. To be honest, so did I. I was still in shock over losing Maggie and I could really use a familiar face.



""Ya. Sounds good."" He smiled. ""You'll have to tell me about big city life! Do they still have birds, or did the cell phone towers zap them all?""



We settled in for the night, watching modern remakes of childhood classics before finding the originals on the internet and watching those, instead.



I woke up on the couch. It must have been two, three in the morning?



I heard B.J. in the other room, hollering; ""Go away! Go away!""



I got up, kicking empty beer cans as I walked. I opened the door to B.J.'s room. There he was in his underwear, holding his hunting knife, stabbing and slashing wildly at the air. Screaming;



""Go away! Not me! You won't get me!""



B.J. held out his left hand and balled it in to a fist, as if to grab something. With his right hand he thrusted the hunting knife rapidly at waist-level.



As I stood in the doorway, I was scared. It looked like my best friend was having a nervous breakdown. I was about to call out to him, when I heard an unfamiliar voice fill the room;



""I'll take that as a 'No'.""



When the voice spoke, B.J. stopped. His eyes grew wide as he stood there, alone, half-naked and shivering. He fell to his knees in panic.



""Oh, God! What did I do? What did I do? What did I do? What did I do!?""



He began to sob. He thrust the knife in to the floorboards and collapsed, laying facedown.



""B.J., that voice. What was that?""



B.J. rolled over on to his back.



""Mr. Bad News.""



For a moment, I wanted to retreat in to my cynical disbelief. But, I heard it. I didn't see it, but I heard that voice. Or did I imagine it? No, I definately heard something.



""I tried to get him, Archie. I had to try. For Maggie's sake I tried to skewer the bastard.""



He clenched his eyes and took a deep breath before he continued;



""I was waiting for him. After you went to sleep, I came in my room and I waited. I heard there were ways to summon him. If you called out to him enough times. I chanted; 'Bring me the news. Bring me the news,' and I waited.""



B.J. sat up and pulled the knife from the floor. He examined it closely.



""When he tapped me on the shoulder, I was ready for him. He asked me if I wanted to hear the news. I didn't answer him, but I think my actions spoke for me. You heard what he said, didn't you?""



I gulped to clear the lump in my throat and said;



""I'll take that as a 'No'.""



B.J. smiled a hanged man's smile;



""That's right. You heard it, too."" He took a deep breath. ""I'm a dead man, Archie. I refused the news.""



The next day, I asked my parents if B.J. could stay with them. I didn't see a point in lying to them. I just told them what happened.



""Big Johnny pissed off Mr. Bad News. Could you provide some support while I go to the library and see if I can find a way to save him?""



My dad nodded, solemnly. ""B.J.'s always welcome, but if what you say is true, than he may not have much time. God speed, son.""



I spent hours pouring over information at the library. B.J. was able to point me in the right direction, telling me a few authors and decades I should focus on. We both agreed that if this really was the end for B.J., that it would be better to go out surrounded by friends and family, instead of frantically flailing for life like a drowning man. He rested while I searched with fresh eyes.



For as long as I can remember, we were B.J.'s family. It's a long story, don't have time for it here, but trust me when I say, that B.J. would rather spend his last days with my mom and dad rather than the two bozos that birthed him. That's not harsh, it's generous.



I gathered as much information as I could. The nursery rhyme was published in a children's book in 1917. The first use of the name 'Mr. Bad News' was published in a book of various folktales, myths & legends in 1936 by an unknown author. I even found a news report from 2011, where multiple children had told their parents about seeing a mysterious 'Purple Man' before becoming victims of a mass shooting. The Purple Man was not the shooter, but police found it an odd coincidence and worthy of note.



Just then, as I sat there with old newspaper records laid out in front of me, I felt a tap on my shoulder.



The fluorescent bulbs above me, blinked in their struggle to stay alive. A cold wind blew from an opened window.



I felt it again.



\*Tap\*

\*Tap\*

\*Tap\*



I could feel my bowels entangle in knots. My fists clenched and unclenched. My mind, racing with plans of action. What do I do know? Then, I heard a shrill, ancient voice of old say;



""Excuse me.""



I turned and faced it. The Librarian.



""Excuse me, but the library is closing soon. Please gather your things and make your way to the exit.""



I asked; ""Can I use the bathroom first?""



\--- Act Three ---



A week had passed since B.J. foolishly attempted to fight a demonic, ghost-thing a.k.a Mr. Bad News.



At this point, B.J. had made peace with himself. He started reading the bible. He trusted in a higher power. All things one does when one is expecting to explode at any second.



Ready to meet his end, B.J. had come up with a plan. With nothing left to lose, he was going to summon Mr. Bad News one more time. This time, B.J. would ask him for the news. Nay, plead and beg to hear the news.



Best case scenario, Mr. Bad News would tell him something bad, like; 'You'll break your bones' or 'Your house will burn down.' Both options, way better than exploding in a supermarket.



Worst case scenario, Mr. Bad News either doesn't show or he does show and refuses to tell us anything. In which case, B.J. will probably explode like Maggie. Not ideal, but at this rate, it's going to happen, anyway.



B.J. and I have set up a spot in my dad's garage. We cleared the car out and removed any dangerous items we could think of. We want Mr. Bad News to know we come in peace.



Just to be safe, we asked my parents to leave us alone for the night. They went to visit my Aunt & Uncle in town.



B.J., despite my objections, is back in his underwear. Apparently, he wants to leave this world the way he entered it. Naked and afraid.



""Are you ready, B.J.""



""I'm ready, Archie. Hey, I'll tell your sister you said, 'Hi'.""



""Th-thanks.""



B.J. calmed himself and focused. He then began chanting;



""Bring me the news. Bring me the news.""



I began to focus with him, imagining the Purple Man appearing before us, but I left the chanting to B.J.



""Bring me the news. Bring me the news.""



This went on for about ten, fifteen minutes. I kept silent as I listened to B.J. chant.



""Bring me the news. Bring me the... Yes! Yes, I want to hear the news!""



I stood there, in my father's dimly lit garage, watching my friend in his underwear stare directly in front of him. Eyes glowing with excitement as if he were staring at a god. Meanwhile, I saw nothing. But I could hear my friend say;



""Yes! Please. I want to hear the news. God, tell me. Dear God, tell me the news!""



Then I heard the voice, the voice of the unseen say;



""No God. Not for you.""



I saw dread wash over the face of my friend. I saw him stretch his arms forward, grasping at nothing. Falling to his knees, an all too familiar picture. He murmured;



""No. No, no, no, no, no, no, NO!""



I stepped toward B.J. but only for a moment before halting. The smell was the first thing I noticed. The smell of sulfur hit my nostrils with a pungent force.



Next, it was the sizzle and popping of flesh. B.J.'s skin started to blister rapidly. Boils broke out all over his body as he turned a sun-scorched shade of red. He started to scream;



""Oh, God! It burns! Help me, Archie, It burns!""



Smoke started rising from B.J.'s back. Kneeling down, hunched over, the skin seemed to melt from his arms. He stood up momentarily, the skin from his knees sticking to the concrete floor below. He took a step toward me, the smell of burnt hair and blackened fat filling my nostrils.



""Archie, do something ple...""



He fell down at my feet. His torso, searing itself to the floor. An open flame now erupting from his back. I heard the crackle of his bones as the fire burnt them dry. His meat hissed and spit at me like bacon grease.



And then, all was quiet, and I was alone.



My parents and I told the police that we had come back from a family outing, only to find the burnt corpse of B.J. in our garage. We agreed as a family that we wouldn't talk about Mr. Bad News. That our story would simply be; 'We don't know, officer. We weren't home when it happened.'



This was a lie. B.J. was in fact murdered by something not of this world. Something that is still out there, even as I type this account.



The rest of the town may have their thoughts about what happened that night and rumors may spread surrounding B.J.'s mysterious demise, but I know the truth.



They cremated his remains. My parents and I held our own service around the fire in the backyard. Then, I drove back home, to the city. Away from this town and its awful memories.



So, here I am. Alone in my apartment. Telling you my story, in the hopes that someone out there might believe me. That someone might benefit from this tragedy.



Perhaps, my story might provide closure to any distant relatives of my friend, Big Johnny. I hope you know that he died trying. May this knowledge bring you peace.



In the end, both B.J. and my sister couldn't stop the supernatural from getting in. They tried to reject it, but the news came to them. It was their rejection of the news that killed them.



I'm about to publish this for whomever may find it. What happens next, I'm scared to imagine.



I must keep my eyes forward. No turning back. For I am afraid of what waits behind me.



For the last several minutes, as I've been typing this account, I've felt a steady tapping on my shoulder.

Her order- venti black iced coffee- is simple; so are the baristas who make it. Just last week I ordered, took out my wallet to pay. As soon as it got to the tipping question the barista blurted out, “oh, um, IREALLYLIKETHECOLOROFYOURDRESS- awww” (the “awww” came out once he realized I’d already tapped no tip; his shoulders hunched, his head dipped, and he shuffled off to fulfill my order, not even bothering to finish the compliment.)

At this Starbucks the baristas are always dishing out forced compliments to get people to tip- “by the way, you’re so pretty!” “I love your hair!” “I love your shoes!” (how can you even see if there’s a counter between us?)- it’s annoying, but this was, by far, the most unsubtle.

For context this is a Starbucks in the lobby of a major building in the finance district so perhaps they expect us to tip more, and they think that compliments are the key to getting us to tap 20% instead of 0? Does this happen at other Starbucks locations, corporate or not? I’m guessing it happens more to women than to men since men don’t get complimented enough, but I’m not sure.

Hey there! I’m a 30-year-old creative in marketing with a dry sense of humor, an adventurous streak, and a knack for turning everyday moments into something worth remembering. I use a wheelchair for longer distances—but that’s just one part of the story. I’m independent, curious, and always up for something fun, meaningful, or wonderfully weird.



Perks of Dating Me:


	•	VIP Parking – Front-row access to life, baby.
	•	Skip the Line – Theme parks, concerts, events… we don’t do “waiting.”
	•	Endless Laughs – Wild injury stories that sound fake (but aren’t).
	•	Unexpected Wins – Free upgrades, kind strangers, and the occasional surprise dessert.
	•	Zombie Apocalypse Strategy – I may not outrun them, but I’m clever, calm under pressure, and hard to miss. That’s teamwork.
	•	You’ll Stand Out – Let’s be real—“normie” couples are overrated.
	•	Built-In Armrest – My chair’s side guards are cozy. You’re welcome.
	•	Strong Hands, Strong Heart – Years of pushing wheels and opening up emotionally.
	•	Creative Problem-Solving – I’m basically a MacGyver with wheels.
	•	Zero Time for Superficial BS – Life’s short. I keep it real and intentional.



A Bit More About Me


I’m all about storytelling—whether it’s through books, music, movies, games, or late-night conversations. I love collecting weird trivia, exploring overlooked places, and getting lost in good ideas.

I stay active in my own way: home workouts, nature walks, and traveling whenever I can. I’ve explored the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Colombia, and the Bahamas—and there’s still plenty more I’d love to experience. (Bonus: I speak Spanish, too!)

I’m the kind of person who notices the little things—your favorite song, how you take your coffee, the way you light up when you talk about something you love. I care deeply, listen closely, and show up consistently. Whether it’s building a playlist, discovering a local gallery, or just sharing quiet time, I value connection that feels grounded and genuine.

⸻

What I’m Looking For:

I’m drawn to people who are:

	•	Playful, grounded, and emotionally present
	•	Down to laugh, explore, and be real together
	•	Into thoughtful conversations and spontaneous fun
	•	Comfortable being fully, unapologetically themselves

I’m open to friendship, flirtation, or something more—whatever feels right. Long-distance, age gaps, different backgrounds—all are welcome. I’m attracted to all body types—connection and energy mean more to me than any one look.

Whatever we build, I just want it to feel real and mutual.



Why You Should Message Me:

If you’re looking for someone thoughtful, creative, and emotionally grounded—someone who values kindness, depth, and shared experiences—I’d genuinely love to hear from you.

No pressure. No expectations. Just an open door and a bit of curiosity.

If something here speaks to you, don’t be shy. Say hello, tell me something about you, and let’s see where the conversation takes us.



Let’s Make Memories:

Big trips, quiet nights, deep talks, shared playlists—I think the best connections are built on a little of everything. Whether you’re looking for something serious or just someone to connect with in an honest, easy way, you’re welcome here.

Reach out. I’d really love to hear from you.",2,1753833915.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

I felt a bit dehydrated as a result and I kept salivating for a good chunk after.

However one weird part is that the part under my ear and BEHIND the bone jaw line hurt slightly and I could feel inflammation and slight tension in that area.

I just need to get this off my chest so bad. As much as the rejection hurt and the  comments from my friends, I wanted to believe that there would be someone that would like me, but I guess I’ve just lost hope. 

I will always be that single friend and I have to get used to that. I have a lot of flaws - I’m not pretty at all (well below average), I’m quiet, I’m weird, I’m bigger. There’s so many things I could change, but I guess I just really wanted someone to like me for me, and not for a person I’d try and be. 

What makes it worse is my parents keep talking about relationships and how everyone is in one, but me. How I must be doing something wrong that I can’t possibly find someone. 

They’re all right. 

Has anyone got any advice on how to overcome the fact that I’ll always be single? I appreciate you having read this far. Thank you.

When Love Failed Twice, My Passion Lead Me to My True Love
Chapter 1

At my wedding ceremony with Maxwell Ferguson, his secretary sent him a message: Maxwell, my turtle is on a hunger strike, and I’m a little worried about its health.

Without a second thought, Maxwell walked out, leaving me alone at the altar. Humiliation washed over me as whispers and stares from the guests closed in like a noose.

I confronted him later, my voice shaking with disbelief.

He shrugged. “It was just a wedding.”

“Chelsea’s turtle might die if it doesn’t eat,” he added. “It’s a life!”

Then, as if I were the unreasonable one, he snapped, “Why are you being so cruel?”

That night, I opened my phone and saw his latest social media post: a picture of two hands intertwined, captioned—

A forced marriage is nothing compared to time spent with my little turtle.

Without hesitation, I commented: Congratulations. Wishing you and that shameless woman a long and happy life together.

Then I dialed the number I’d never forgotten and asked,

“You once promised to marry me. Does that offer still stand?”

——

The groom ditching the wedding was something the Fergusons had never seen before.

""Just some nobody orphan girl with a pretty face. No wonder Maxwell ditched the wedding.""

""Who'd want a girl with that kind of background, let alone someone from the Fergusons?""

""I wonder when Maxwell will get tired of her and let me have a go. That face, that body, tsk tsk tsk.""

The looks people gave me were a mix of pity, mockery and barely concealed lust.

I clutched the bouquet tightly in my hands. The Fergusons looked down on my background so much that even my wedding dress was a defective one thrown out by the bridal shop.

Annabelle said I should know my place, that someone as lowly as I should be grateful to marry into the Fergusons. She said having even one decent dress was more than I deserved.

""Suzanne, have you contacted Maxwell?"" The elegant and wealthy woman below the stage shot me a disgusted look.

My heart trembled and the scars on my back began to ache again. I gripped the hem of my dress, not knowing what to do and whispered.

""Mom, he hasn't replied.""

Annabelle's brows furrowed deeply.

""If Maxwell isn't here, then this farce ends now. We'll discuss the wedding again some other time.""

I snapped my head up, staring at her in disbelief. She dismissed the wedding I had dreamed of for so long as a farce.

""An orphan with no parents, brought into the Fergusons by Katherine and still so ungrateful.""

""Maxwell has met plenty of flirtatious women like her; no wonder he prefers someone sweet and innocent like Chelsea Sadler.""

The words from below the stage pierced my heart like sharp swords. I didn't know how I dazedly returned home. When I pushed open the door, I saw Maxwell sitting on the sofa.

""Chelsea's turtle went on a hunger strike today, so I went to the pet hospital to look.""

""Did anything go wrong with the wedding?""

I looked up at him. His shirt was disheveled, his neck covered in love bites and he hadn't even zipped up his pants. He looked utterly satisfied.

As if he noticed my gaze, Maxwell deliberately pulled his collar down, showing a few scratches on his collarbone.

""Chelsea's so delicate. Just a few rounds and she already scratched me like this,"" he said with a tone of complaint and pride.

I was the adopted daughter-in-law brought home by Katherine Ferguson. Since I was young, I was taught to obey Maxwell. He wouldn't even allow me to make any noise during intimacy because he found it annoying.

""She's not like you. She is delicate and fragile. She can't handle all those wild moves.""

Maxwell mostly used me for release when he was with me and all sorts of props filled the room.

But he only had tenderness towards Chelsea, unwilling to hurt her even a little.

Countless times after, I would be covered in injuries, bleeding nonstop and Maxwell would only coldly leave a ""how boring"" before leaving the room.

The doctor said I had a ruptured corpus luteum and couldn't engage in strenuous activities anymore. When Maxwell found out, he angrily scolded me for being delicate.

He had initially planned to take Chelsea hiking. Still, because she was weak, Maxwell wanted me to go and carry water and equipment for them.

""You're tough as nails, yet you can't even handle a hike?"" Maxwell's angry voice seemed to ring in my ears again.

""Today was supposed to be our wedding,"" I said, trembling as I looked at him.

His face stiffened and he irritably put out his cigarette.

""It's just a wedding.""

""Chelsea's turtle could die if it doesn't eat. That's a life, you know.""

""Suzanne, when did you become so cruel?"" He didn't even spare me a glance as he turned and walked upstairs.

I didn't even notice when the tears began to fall.

The Maxwell of the past would give his own room to me, a newly arrived orphan; knowing I was allergic to strawberries, he wouldn't allow any strawberries to appear in the Ferguson household; when others called me an adopted daughter-in-law, he broke that person's leg with a kick.

Now, all those exceptions belonged to his little secretary, Chelsea Sadler.

Ding!

The special notification sound on my phone rang. Since I came to the Fergusons, Maxwell had pinned my contact and set it to special notifications.

I clicked open the notification and saw Maxwell had posted a picture on social media. Two hands intertwined with the caption: A forced marriage can't compare to spending time with my little turtle.



Chapter 2

Beneath the photo were comments from our mutual friends.

""Maxwell, aren't you scared your little wifey will get mad if you post this?""

""Max and Chelsea's bathwater is fetched bucket by bucket by that adopted daughter-in-law. What's there to be scared of with a woman like that?""

Maxwell liked those comments and replied.

""What's the fun in someone who comes crawling the second I crook my finger?""

My mind was buzzing and the screen before me blurred.

I suddenly rushed upstairs, not even feeling the bruise on my leg from hitting the coffee table. My hand, which was about to knock, froze in mid-air because of the words inside.

""Max, will Suzanne be angry if you post something like that?""

Maxwell's voice was helpless and doting.

""She's just an adopted daughter-in-law. What right does she have to be angry about?""

""Your current task is to get pregnant with my child. When the time comes, I'll have her be your postpartum nanny to care for you.""

Chelsea seemed to say something else, making them both laugh.

But I couldn't hear anything anymore. I pushed open the door and met Chelsea's teasing gaze in the video.

""Max, your little wife is getting jealous of us.""

Maxwell also turned his head to look at me, his brows furrowed with displeasure.

""Suzanne, have you forgotten all your manners? Don't you know to knock first?""

""I should've just let those thugs take you that day. Then the Fergusons wouldn't have ended up with such a troublemaker.""

His words made my face turn pale instantly.

I was brought to this home by Katherine when I was seven years old. At that time, I was being harassed by a group of hooligans who preyed on children.

They dragged me into an alley. Their slimy, disgusting hands roam over my body.

Inside his luxury car, Maxwell suddenly spotted me. Seeing how pitiful I looked, he begged Katherine to save me.

Maxwell was my savior, so I tried my best to obey him no matter what he asked me to do.

When he and Chelsea booked a hotel room without protection, I braved the heavy rain to bring them what they needed.

Chelsea disliked that the Props packaging was soaked by the rain and she cried and demanded that I apologize; otherwise, she would go home and not be with Maxwell.

Maxwell couldn't let her leave in the heat of the moment. He forced me to kneel and bow to Chelsea, threatening to send me to those beast' beds if I didn't.

I knelt outside the hotel with a wet body. I bowed continuously as I listened to their intimate voices.

A kind-hearted person passing by couldn't bear to see me like that and gave me her coat.

The next day, when Maxwell came out with Chelsea in his arms, he saw me passed out in the hallway, covered in a drenched coat.

Chelsea kindly helped me, but screamed and pushed me away when she touched the wet coat.

My knees were scraped and the wounds on my legs were smeared with mud.

Maxwell didn't even glance at me, only tenderly holding Chelsea's hands and said to me fiercely.

""Take whatever you want, but if you dirty Chelsea's hands, you'll pay for it.""

""Max, what cheap men are you talking about?"" Chelsea's delicate voice pulled me back from my memories.

Maxwell glanced at me, then noticed Chelsea looking at me curiously. With a doting smile, he said.

""Back then, some thugs dragged her into an alley. If it weren't for me, she'd probably be the top girl at a nightclub by now.""

""Well, you'd better apologize properly to Suzanne. You've really messed with her career prospects.""

Maxwell and Chelsea laughed, giving me teasing looks.

""Maxwell, don't push it."" My vision blurred with unshed tears, my nails digging into my palms as I lifted my gaze to meet his.

The deepest wound in my heart was casually turned into a joke for Chelsea to smile at.

As soon as I said that, Maxwell's expression changed. He stormed to the door, grabbed me by the hair and dragged me in front of the phone, forcing me to face Chelsea on the video call.

""Suzanne, Chelsea was just joking around. Don't be so aggressive.""

""Apologize.""

I didn't move. I stubbornly straightened up.

Maxwell grew angry as well. He slammed my head onto the ground. I lost my balance and knelt awkwardly in front of the phone. My hair was disheveled, my face covered in tears, looking like a lunatic.

I didn't remember how I got out of that room. All I could recall was the sound of Maxwell and Chelsea laughing.

""Why don't those beasts bother someone else?""

""Max, looks like your little wife is pretty popular with men.""

I slid down the wall, slowly collapsing onto the floor. I covered my mouth tightly to keep from making a sound. My eyes were so full of tears that I couldn't see anything clearly.

I pulled out my phone and searched my contacts until I found the old chat history.

[I've changed my mind. Let's get married.]



Chapter 3

The reply came almost instantly. I threw the buzzing phone aside, forced myself to my feet and returned to the room.

The door flew open in the middle of the night with a loud bang. Maxwell stormed in and yanked me out of bed.

""Get up. Chelsea's here to apologize.""

Before I could even fully wake up, he dragged me into the living room.

Chelsea was all dressed up and glowing. When she saw me, she smiled warmly and pulled me down to sit beside her, pushing a box into my arms.

""Suzanne, I shouldn't have said those things about you.""

""Max said you love strawberry cake. I made this one myself as a peace offering.""

Only then did I look down and realize what I was holding: a cake smothered in strawberry sauce.

""I don't want it."" I slapped the cake out of her hands.

The edge of the cake box grazed Chelsea's hand, leaving a small red mark on the back of her hand. Her eyes instantly welled up with tears.

""Max, I didn't know Suzanne didn't like this.""

She spoke between sobs, large tears rolling down her cheeks.

Maxwell hurriedly hugged Chelsea to his arms and slapped me in the face.

""Suzanne! Don't push it.""

""Chelsea went out of her way to make this for you and this is how you repay her?""

He didn't hold back. I collapsed to the floor, my ears ringing.

After a long moment, I slowly got up, pressing a hand to my face.

""I'm allergic to strawberries, Maxwell. Did you forget?""

When Chelsea wasn't around, Maxwell strictly forbade anything strawberry-related in the house. He was always afraid I'd accidentally eat some.

For a second, a flicker of hesitation crossed his face. But the sound of Chelsea softly sobbing made him glare at me even more fiercely.

""Stop making excuses. You're just doing this to make things difficult for Chelsea.""

""I don't believe one bite would kill you.""

Chelsea tugged at his sleeve, speaking gently.

""Max, if Suzanne doesn't want to forgive me, that's okay. Let's forget it.""

Her pitiful tone only made Maxwell angrier. He pointed to the mess of cake on the floor.

""Eat Chelsea's cake. If you do, I'll pretend none of this ever happened.""

I looked up at him in disbelief. He didn't even glance at me, gently patting Chelsea's back to comfort her.



Chapter 4

My hand trembled as I reached for the cake on the floor, but Maxwell kicked it away.

""You ruined Chelsea's good intentions and you still have the nerve to eat it with your hands?""

I took a deep breath and lay down next to them, biting a piece of the cake with my mouth.

The strong taste of strawberries instantly filled my entire mouth. I subconsciously wanted to throw up, but Maxwell covered my mouth.

""You're not allowed to leave a single bite. Otherwise, I'll send you to those beasts' beds.""

Thinking of the people who had dragged me into the alley when I was little, my body shuddered violently. I desperately swallowed the cake in my mouth.

""Max, look, Suzanne looks like a dog.""

""Do you think she also flattered those beasts like this?"" Chelsea's piercing laughter entered my ears.

I only felt an unbearable itching on my neck and arms. Dense red rashes appeared on my exposed skin.

I have a severe strawberry allergy. Even a little bit will cause a reaction.

After finishing the entire cake, I could barely breathe. My brain was severely oxygen-deprived and I couldn't see anything in front of me.

""Dramatic.""

Maxwell kicked me. Seeing that I didn't react, he also started to panic. He wanted to call an ambulance, but Chelsea stopped him.

""Max, didn't you say Suzanne is best at pretending to be pitiful to gain sympathy?""

""Maybe she's just faking it now.""

""Max, go to my house to see the little turtle. It hasn't eaten again recently.""

Maxwell glanced at me, hesitated momentarily and then left the villa with Chelsea.

When I woke up again, I was in a hospital room, the oxygen mask on my face making me feel disoriented.

Just before I passed out, the housemaid had found me and sent me to the hospital.

""I'm sorry, Miss Sullivan. We couldn't save your child.""

The doctor's words completely stunned me.

""What child?""

The doctor frowned and shook off my hand.

""You have a severe strawberry allergy. The baby was already three months old.""

""Because you ingested too many strawberry products, the baby couldn't be saved.""

The way the doctor looked at me was like looking at an irresponsible mother.

How could I have Maxwell's child?

We clearly always took precautions. Only once, when he had a fight with Chelsea and came back wanting to vent his frustration at night.

My face paled. Just as I was about to speak, Maxwell pushed open the door and interrupted me.

Looking at my pale face, Maxwell frowned.

""Suzanne, how can you be so useless that you can't keep a child?""

""Because you lost the baby, Chelsea has already fainted from guilt.""

""If anything happens to Chelsea, I'll hold you responsible.""

Seeing that I didn't speak, Maxwell grabbed the doctor and was about to leave, saying as he walked.

""Doctor, hurry up and check on my girlfriend. She's been unconscious for three hours.""

Then, he turned his gaze to me.

""You're strong. A miscarriage isn't a big deal. Go apologize to Chelsea when she wakes up later.""

Seeing that I still didn't move, Maxwell yanked me off the hospital bed and dragged me to the next room.

A sharp pain came from my lower belly. Cold sweat poured from my forehead.

""It hurts,"" I whispered, my face pale. The wound from the miscarriage was tearing open again, leaving a trail of blood behind me.

Maxwell didn't even pause. He shoved me in front of Chelsea's hospital bed.

Chelsea had just woken up. She looked at me and shrank back in horror, diving into Maxwell's arms.

""Apologize to Chelsea.""



Chapter 5

I bit down hard on my lip, trying to endure the pain shooting through me.

""I'm sorry, it's all my fault.""

If I didn't give in to Maxwell, who knows how much more humiliation I'd have to suffer from them.

Chelsea covered her mouth in surprise, then gave me a gentle smile.

""Suzanne, it's not completely your fault that you lost the baby. I'm partly to blame, too.""

Maxwell wrapped his arms around her protectively.

""Chelsea, this has nothing to do with you. It's her body that's weak.""

I couldn't even count how often I'd heard him say that.

Whenever Chelsea hurt me over the years, she pretended to apologize. Maxwell never even listened to my side of the story. He always blamed everything on me.

She once stole a multimillion-dollar contract from the Fergusons and accused me of taking it. Because of her, the entire family hated me. Even Katherine died from the stress.

I didn't know how long I knelt there before the silence was broken by a knock on the hospital room door. Maxwell stood up and kicked me.

""Go bring the food in.""

I stumbled to bring the meal in, blood still dripping steadily down my legs.

Chelsea shifted as I approached the bedside, whether intentionally or not, knocking the scalding hot soup from my hands.

The arm that was already flushed red instantly blistered and a few drops of soup splashed onto Chelsea's hair.

Maxwell reacted instantly, shoving me to the floor and tenderly taking Chelsea's hand.

""Chelsea, does it hurt?""

Tears welled up in Chelsea's eyes as she shook her head, her gaze falling on me.

""I'm fine. You should go check on Suzanne.""

Only then did Maxwell remember that I was the culprit who had hurt Chelsea. He called the bodyguards in.

""Lock her in the basement. Don't let her out without my orders.""

The word ""basement"" made my mind go blank. I lunged forward and clung to Maxwell's pant leg, begging.

""It was all my fault! Please, don't send me down there!""

My forehead was already bleeding from hitting the floor repeatedly. Maxwell sneered coldly.

""Those men should teach you some manners.""

My face paled. Every time I disobeyed him, Maxwell would lock me in with those thugs who had once tried to assault me.

The bodyguards dragged me to the basement. Soon after, several familiar voices drifted in from outside.

I trembled, shrinking into the corner, terrified of making any sound betraying my presence.

""Well, well, looks like Miss Sullivan got tossed aside by Mr. Ferguson again, huh?""

""If you'd just come with us back then, you wouldn't suffer like this now.""

Their slimy gazes roamed over my body and their hands reached for my chest.

The basement door burst open with a bang, followed by a few muffled screams from the men above.

I cautiously looked up and seeing that familiar face brought a wave of relief before I lost consciousness.

The next time I saw Maxwell and Chelsea was at the City Hall.

""Suzanne? Who let you out?""

Maxwell frowned. In the past, when he ""punished"" me, no one had ever dared to plead for me, let alone release me privately.

""Suzanne, are you here to congratulate Max and me?"" Chelsea looked at me smugly.

""Suzanne, even if Grandma's last wish was for me to marry you, I would never be with you."" Maxwell glanced at me, scoffing.

""Would following me here make me change my mind? You're not even worth one of Chelsea's fingers.""

I smiled and raised my hand, the ring on my finger catching the light.

""I'm not here to stalk you. I'm here to get married.""



Chapter 6

Maxwell's expression shifted, his eyes fixed in disbelief on the dazzling ring on my finger.

""Married? Who did you marry?""

""You're just a childhood sweetheart I've grown tired of. Who in this circle would want you besides me?""

I watched Maxwell's growing agitation with a cold gaze, then chuckled.

""Judging by the looks of it, you two are also here to get married. Congratulations on your upcoming wedding.""

A flicker of panic crossed Maxwell's face and he subconsciously loosened his tightly clasped hand with Chelsea.

""Max."" Chelsea's eyes instantly turned red and she tugged at Maxwell's sleeve, looking utterly wronged.

""That ring … it's fake, isn't it?""

""Suzanne, are you trying to use this to make me change my mind?""

My gaze fell on the bracelet on Chelsea's wrist.

It was a wedding gift Katherine had given to Maxwell and me before she passed away.

The day before our wedding, Chelsea complained about not having any jewelry.

Maxwell had searched everywhere for bracelets and bangles, but Chelsea was unsatisfied.

Chelsea spotted the bracelet on my wrist when he asked me to deliver chicken soup to them.

Upon hearing that it was a gift from Katherine, she burst into tears, claiming that the Fergusons didn't want to acknowledge her.

They would rather give a family heirloom to a lowly orphan like me than to her.

I had knelt and bowed repeatedly, but Maxwell couldn't console her

Perhaps annoyed by her incessant whining, he yanked the bracelet off my wrist and gave it to Chelsea.

""You're just a poor orphan we kindly took in. You're not worthy of something this valuable as Chelsea is.""

I cried and told him it was the only keepsake I had left from Katherine.

He casually tossed a cheap piece of jewelry that Chelsea didn't want into my hands.

""Someone like you should be grateful you have anything at all. If you keep making trouble, you can leave the Fergusons' residence.""

As I was leaving, I saw Chelsea throw the bracelet aside like it was garbage.

That night, I received an anonymous message.

[The thing you begged so hard for is something I can toss away without a second thought.]

[That old hag never wanted Max and me together, but now that she's dead, it's time for you to get out too, a little orphan.]

The message included a picture of the bracelet and a pile of condoms thrown in a toy with suspicious-looking liquid on them.

As if sensing my gaze, Maxwell guiltily shielded Chelsea's hand.

""Suzanne, stop making a scene. I won't hold your past mistakes against you anymore. Just go home and behave. The position of Mrs. Ferguson is still yours.""

The moment he said that, Chelsea's face darkened, her eyes glaring at me with resentment.

My past mistakes?

His words made me laugh out loud in disbelief. Just as I was about to retort, my phone buzzed.

A pleasant male voice came from the other end of the line.

""Suzanne, do you need me to come help you?""

I smiled shyly and said softly.

""No need, hubby. I can handle this myself.""

The person on the other end seemed surprised by my address and after a moment of silence, a soft chuckle followed.

""Alright, I'll wait for you outside, wifey.""

Hearing his last word made my ears burn.

Just as I hung up, a large hand grabbed my wrist.

I looked up to see Maxwell's eyes bloodshot, staring intently at me.



Chapter 7

""Who's the guy you're having an affair with?""

Sensing that something was off, Chelsea quickly grabbed Maxwell's arm.

""Maxwell, didn't you say Suzanne loves to lie the most?""

""I bet she hired an actor to try and get your attention. That ring looks totally fake.""

Chelsea's gaze landed on me and she sneered.

""Suzanne, even if Max doesn't like you, you're still part of the Fergusons.""

""Hiring someone to put on a show like this is just pathetic. You're making a fool of the entire family.""

Maxwell gave me a doubtful look and then his expression shifted as if he suddenly understood. He let go of my hand and smirked.

""Suzanne, did you go this far just to make me jealous?""

""Fine, I'll go home with you tonight. Stop making a scene here.""

I stared at him, speechless. Then, I calmly pulled out a marriage certificate from my bag.

""Take a good look. I'm already married.""

""So please, Maxwell, stay away from me. I'm a married woman now.""

I made sure to emphasize the words ""married woman."" Maxwell's face visibly paled.

""Married?""

I shot him a cold glance, having lost all patience to argue with them. I turned to leave, but a force yanked my wrist, causing a sharp pain.

""Let go! Who allowed you to touch my wife?""

Just then, a man's cold and ruthless voice sounded behind me.

He was about to say something when he froze on the spot upon seeing the person behind me, his hand trembling as he released my wrist.

1mcrpjq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Exsplore/comments/1mcrpjq/best_outdoor_living_space_features_for_homes_in/,Best Outdoor Living Space Features for Homes in Coastal Connecticut,"Living along the [Connecticut shoreline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coastal_Connecticut) offers a lifestyle that blends fresh sea air, stunning views, and a relaxed pace of life. Whether you live in Mystic, Stonington, Groton, or Old Saybrook, your home’s outdoor living space can be so much more than a backyard, it can be an extension of your coastal lifestyle. The key is choosing features that enhance comfort, withstand the coastal climate, and reflect the charm of New England architecture.

Here are the best outdoor living space features to consider for your coastal Connecticut home.

# 1. Multi-Level Decks with Water Views

If your property offers a glimpse of [Long Island Sound](https://lispartnership.org/about-the-sound/what-makes-it-special/) or a nearby harbor, a multi-level deck is a perfect way to maximize those views. Composite materials such as Azek or Trex are ideal for coastal conditions because they resist saltwater corrosion, fading, and moisture damage better than natural wood. Consider incorporating built-in benches, planters, or even a small outdoor bar to make your deck the ultimate entertaining space.

# 2. Custom Patios for Entertaining

A well-designed patio can become the heart of your backyard. For coastal homes in Mystic, Stonington, and [Old Lyme](https://www.oldlyme-ct.gov/), materials like stone pavers, brick, or stamped concrete not only look beautiful but also handle the moisture and salt air well. Pair your patio with a pergola for shade or a retractable awning so you can enjoy the space in any weather.

# 3. Outdoor Kitchens and Dining Areas

Coastal Connecticut summers are made for fresh [seafood](https://ctvisit.com/seafood-restaurants) dinners and casual backyard gatherings. An outdoor kitchen with a built-in grill, countertop space, and storage means you can prepare and serve meals without ever stepping inside. Add a dining area with comfortable, weather-resistant furniture so guests can linger and enjoy the ocean breeze.

# 4. Firepits and Outdoor Fireplaces

Cool evenings along the shoreline are perfect for gathering around a warm fire. A custom-built firepit or outdoor fireplace extends your outdoor living season well into the fall. For homes in Groton, Waterford, and [East Lyme](https://eltownhall.com/), gas firepits offer convenience while wood-burning options add that classic crackle and coastal charm.

# 5. Pergolas and Trellises for Coastal Shade

The Connecticut shoreline can be sunny and bright, so incorporating shade structures into your design keeps your outdoor spaces comfortable. A pergola can define an outdoor seating area, while a trellis adds vertical interest and a place for climbing plants like [wisteria](https://www.bartlettarboretum.org/fieldnotes/2024/10/24/invasives2024) or hydrangea vines, both staples of New England gardens.

# 6. Durable Fencing and Privacy Solutions

Living in coastal towns like Old Saybrook or [Pawcatuck](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Tourism-g33882-Pawcatuck_Stonington_Mystic_Country_Connecticut-Vacations.html) often means neighboring homes are closer together. Privacy fencing, lattice panels, or decorative screens help create a sense of seclusion without blocking breezes or views. Materials like vinyl, composite, and powder-coated aluminum are excellent low-maintenance options for the shoreline climate.

# 7. Retaining Walls and Coastal Landscaping

Retaining walls not only add structure and dimension to your yard but also help [manage erosion](https://www.mullerec.com/erosion-sediment-control/7-effective-erosion-control-measures/), a common concern for shoreline properties. Incorporating stacked stone, brick, or concrete blocks into your landscaping design keeps your yard functional and beautiful, especially when paired with native coastal plants like beach roses and ornamental grasses.

My Husband Killed My Daughter so I Ruined Him
Chapter 1

""Do you still want to destroy my husband and your greatest enemy?"" I said, my voice flat over the phone. ""If yes… pick me up after seven days. I'm going to marry you.""

“Is what I’m hearing right? Samantha Reid—Mrs. Jackson Smith—is finally agreeing to marry me? After all these years of swearing you’d rather fade into nothing? But what about your child with him?""

I swallowed, hard. ""There is no child anymore. Jackson… killed our baby.""

And before he could say another word, I ended the call and dropped the phone beside me.

Three days ago, I was about to give birth—hopeful, excited—until I was kidnapped. They killed my baby in front of me. Jackson saved me… or so I thought. But when I woke up, I heard him.

“Make sure no one knows I was the one who kidnapped my wife and killed my unborn daughter. I never loved her. It’s always been Candice. She is just a placeholder when Candice left me. There should only be one heir—mine and Candice’s. That life inside Samantha… it would’ve ruined everything.”

That was the moment I knew it was over. I filed for divorce, packed my things, and left everything behind.

But just when I thought he no longer cared—he showed up to ruin my wedding day, asking for forgiveness I would never give.

--

""Do you still want to destroy my husband and your greatest enemy?"" I said, my voice flat over the phone. ""If yes… pick me up after seven days. I'm going to marry you.""

There was a brief silence on the other end, and then a deep, amused laugh. “Is what I’m hearing right? Samantha Reid—Mrs. Jackson Smith—is finally agreeing to marry me? After all these years of swearing you’d rather rot in darkness?”

""Inigo,"" I whispered, “do you want him ruined or not?”

Another pause. ""I do. But what about your child with him?""

I swallowed, hard. ""There is no child anymore. Jackson… killed our baby.""

And before he could say another word, I ended the call and dropped the phone beside me. My hands were trembling. No—my whole body was. A sick, bone-deep chill curled through my skin, all the way down to the hollow space where my baby used to be.

Three days ago, I was smiling. Hopeful. I was finally going to give birth. Jackson was supposed to be waiting at the hospital. I was on my way—when the van swerved in front of mine. Masked men. Weapons. I thought… I thought it was Inigo. That’s what Jackson had told me for years: If something happens, it’s Inigo. He hates me. He wants what I have—including you.

They injected something in my veins. I couldn’t move. Couldn’t scream. But I was wide awake. I felt the pain as they sliced into me. I watched blood soak my white dress. I saw my daughter—a tiny, fragile thing—ripped from me. And then nothing. Just a scream in my throat that never escaped.

Then the door burst open. Shouting. Weapons cracking. I could barely turn my head, but I saw him—Jackson, storming in with rage in his eyes, shooting the men one by one. Blood sprayed the walls. The last thing I heard was him screaming my name, falling to his knees beside me. His hands cradled my face.

“My love, stay with me—”

And then I blacked out, thinking he had saved me. Thinking he was my hero.

When I woke up yesterday, my limbs numb from anesthesia, Jackson was beside me with blood on his shirt. He looked like a savior out of a nightmare. His voice shook as he told me he ""got there too late."" That he ""killed them all."" That I was safe.

I believed him. God help me, I always believed him.

But then I heard it. That moment when the drugs hadn't worn off yet and he thought I was asleep. He was standing by the window, speaking to someone on the phone.

“Did you clean the mess? Pay them off?” he said. “Make sure no one knew that I was the one who kidnapped my wife and killed my unborn daughter.”

My fingers gripped the sheets. Is this a dream? What was he saying?

“Yes, sir. They’ll never speak. And they left the country already,” the man replied.

“Good. Let Samantha think it was Inigo,” Jackson said, voice cold and sharp. “No one should know. Not her. Not anyone.”

A pause. Then another voice, hesitant. “Sir… we made her sterile after killing the baby. Wasn’t this too much? What if she finds out?”

“She won’t,” Jackson snapped. “I never loved her. It’s always been Candice. I just needed someone when Candice married my cousin. Samantha was there. Convenient. Loyal. There should only be one heir. Mine and Candice’s. That life inside Samantha… it would’ve ruined everything.”

My stomach twisted. I wanted to scream. Vomit. Die. But I couldn’t move. I just lay there. Paralyzed. Betrayed.

Candice. The golden girl of high society. Elegant, untouchable, the kind of woman men fought over—and Jackson did. She was his first love, the one he swore he’d marry, the one he gave everything to. But four years ago, Candice shattered him. Chose power over love. Married Jackson’s cousin for status and inheritance. Back then, Jackson wasn’t as powerful as he is now. Jackson broke. I found him that night, drunk and bloody and ready to end it all.

I was the one who stopped him. I was the one who stayed.

I helped him rebuild. Gave him my heart. Even helped him build an empire through my family’s connection even they told me that Jackson would betray me soon. And when he asked me to marry him, I said yes without hesitation, thinking he had finally let go of the past.

But he never did. All along, I was just a placeholder.

Now Candice’s husband was dead. And I was no longer needed.

Jackson came into the room later that day, holding a bouquet of white lilies.

“My love,” he said, gently brushing hair from my forehead. “How are you feeling?”

“I lost the baby,” I whispered.

His eyes dropped for a second. Then he smiled. “It’s okay. I’m just glad you’re alive.”

“The doctor said I can’t have children anymore,” I said, watching him closely.

He paused but only for a second. Then he leaned in and kissed my hand. “That’s okay. We still have each other. You know I love you, right?”

I nodded. Pretended I didn’t know.

He stood. “Anyway, I need to go to attend some business. I’ll be back, okay?”

I only smiled and watched him leave.

As soon as the door shut, I grabbed my phone and dialed fast.

“This is Samantha Reid,” I said when the lawyer answered. “I want to file for divorce. From Jackson Smith. Immediately.”

Chapter 2

I cried all night. The ache in my chest burned worse than the pain in my abdomen. I had lost my baby. My body. My pride. But Jackson—he didn’t even come back.

He said he’d return. That he had to “handle things.” But morning came, and I was still alone in that cold hospital bed. No calls. No texts. Just silence.

I reached for my phone, hoping maybe… something. Anything. But instead, I found her.

Candice. A new post. A story from the night before.

She was on a yacht, laughing like a queen in her golden bikini. Music in the background, champagne flutes in the air. And then—there he was. Jackson. Shirtless. Relaxed. Smiling. And kissing her.

My vision blurred. My fingers went numb. I threw the phone, but the pain stayed.

The next morning, a nurse came with my discharge papers. Jackson didn’t even show up. Instead, the driver said he was “preparing a surprise at home.” I almost laughed. I almost believed. But I was too tired to question it.

When we arrived at the estate, I noticed the cars, the music, the voices. It wasn’t just a surprise. It was a full-blown party.

I stepped inside and froze. Gold balloons. Champagne glasses. A massive cake that said “Welcome Home, Candice!”

Candice. Not me.

And then I saw her. In the center of the crowd, radiant and smug. Her hand on the shoulder of a little boy. Around her, people fawned. Jackson’s mother, Janice, was beaming as she raised a toast.

“You should stay here in the estate with your son, Candice,” Janice said. “Jackson will take care of you both.”

Candice gave a soft laugh. “I’m not sure that’s a good idea. What about your daughter-in-law? She might be upset.”

Janice scoffed. “So? I don’t care about that girl. She was never supposed to marry Jackson. I’ve never liked her. She walks around here like she owns the place, just because she ‘saved’ him once. She’s nothing. Nothing!”

It wasn’t new. Janice had always hated me. From the start.

She used to whisper behind my back, always cold, always watching. She blamed me for her divorce—believing I had something to do with it, just because Jackson’s father once said I reminded him of the woman Janice could never be. As if that was my fault. As if it was my fault that her husband had admired me—not out of love, but out of care as a father. She thought we were having an affair. I was twenty.

Jackson defended me then. Said I was family. That I saved his life. That I was loyal. I believed it. I thought he was standing by me. But now I know better—he needed me. A placeholder. A shield until Candice came back.

“Don’t worry, I will tell Jackson to divorce her soon, so maybe, you two…can be together?”

Candice laughed. “Well, maybe… that was a good idea.”

My breath caught. I had heard enough. I backed away quietly, deciding not to make a scene. Well, they never noticed me, either.

I climbed the stairs slowly, pain still lacing through my body. But just as I reached the landing, something hard hit my head.

A metal can.

I stumbled, clutching my skull. “What the heck—?”

And then I saw him. A little boy. Maybe three years old. Big brown eyes, now brimming with tears. He burst into sobs.

“What’s wrong with you?” a voice shrieked behind me.

Janice stormed up the stairs and yanked my hair so hard I nearly fell again. “You made him cry, you heartless woman?”

I winced. “He threw something at my head—!”

“So what if he did?” Janice spat. “He’s a child! And you—what kind of woman makes a baby cry? No wonder you lost yours. You’d never be a good mother.”

The words sliced deeper than any scalpel.

“Mom, stop!” Jackson appeared at the top of the stairs. “She’s my wife,” he added.

But Janice snapped, “Wife? I told you to divorce her! She’s damaged now—useless. Can’t even give you a child. She let herself be kidnapped and now you lost an heir”

I stood there, frozen, humiliated—until the boy ran to Jackson and hugged his leg.

“Daddy, I’m scared of her.”

Daddy? Why haven’t I realized they look alike?

I turned to Jackson, my voice barely above a whisper. “Who is he? Why is he calling you daddy?”

Jackson cleared his throat. “He’s Candice’s son. From my cousin. But... he’s going to stay with us. He needs a father figure. I’ll raise him like my own.”

“What?” My heart sank. “They’re staying here? You agree to that without telling me?”

Candice gave a fake modest laugh. “Oh no, it’s really not necessary—”

“Come on, Samantha,” Jackson cut in. “Don’t be dramatic. You just got home. Be nice. Candice lost her husband. Her child needs a home. This is the best thing we can do.”

I stared at him. At all of them. And I swallowed the scream building in my throat. “Do whatever you want,” I said coldly. Then turned to go upstairs.

But I didn’t get far.

Janice grabbed my arm and shoved me—hard. “You ungrateful and rude being! You should be thankful!”

My body twisted. My feet slipped.

And I tumbled. Down the stairs.

Pain exploded in my side and I hit the bottom with a sickening thud. Wincing, I tried to move but then I heard the child cry out. He had slipped too, landing roughly beside me.

All attention turned to him.

Jackson rushed over. “Are you okay, buddy?”

No one looked at me. Not one person.

I crawled. My limbs shaking. My heart splintering. I dragged myself up the stairs, every step a reminder—I was no longer part of this family.

I had been replaced.

Chapter 3

I thought the worst was over. I had bandaged myself up from the fall earlier—arms scraped, knees bruised, ribs aching but at least I had a few hours of sleep. I told myself to rest. That I just needed silence. Peace.

But peace never lived in this house. Because before dawn, I was yanked out of bed.

My back hit the floor with a sickening thud and a sharp stab of pain shot up my spine. I inhaled sharply, vision swimming, and tried to sit up—but the weight of the fall made my body tremble.

A giggle. A high-pitched laugh filled the room.

I blinked up to see him—the child. Nathan. The same child who hit my head with a can earlier. The one they all adored like some royal bloodline. He was now bouncing on my bed as if it were his.

“I want to sleep here!” he screamed, throwing pillows around like it was a game.

“This is my bed,” I said through clenched teeth. I tried to make my voice kind—he was just a child, wasn’t he? But then again… he was the reason I was bleeding. He was the reason I was sleeping alone. He was the son of the two people who betrayed me.

Still, I tried again. “Go back to your room, sweetheart.”

But he ignored me, dancing in circles, shouting and shrieking. Until his little feet slammed into the stand that held my father's last remaining gift to me—an antique ceramic vase he crafted before he died.

It shattered.

I froze.

The shards scattered across the wooden floor like echoes of my heart. And without thinking, I grabbed Nathan’s arm. “Do you know what you’ve done?” I hissed. “That was the last thing I had from my father!”

The boy blinked at me, stunned, before bursting into tears.

Footsteps thundered outside, and then Candice barged in. Her eyes widened when she saw me holding Nathan’s wrist. “What did you do?! You hurt my son!”

“I didn’t—he broke something important—”

“You know we’re trying to adjust, Samantha! We know you hate that we’re here but this—this is a child! How could you?!”

“I didn’t even—” I stammered, but it was too late.

Jackson appeared in the doorway. His eyes didn’t scan the broken vase. Or the blood on my hand. No, they locked on Nathan’s tears.

Then his palm cracked across my cheek.

I stumbled back, breath stolen, eyes wide. Jackson had never laid a hand on me. Never raised his voice in violence. But now…?

“You slapped me?” I whispered. “Because of him?”

“He’s not just any kid!” Jackson growled. “He’s my heir! I’m adopting him. He’ll carry my name.”

I let out a bitter, disbelieving laugh. “Adopting? Really? And what’s the truth, Jackson? He’s yours, isn’t he?”

He didn’t say yes.

But he didn’t deny it either.

Instead, his silence lingered—loud, heavy, confirming everything without needing words. His jaw tightened. His gaze dropped to the floor for just a second, and that was all I needed. The truth was already etched in every glance, every unspoken word, every time he touched that child like he was his.

And just like that, my heart broke all over again.

I remembered the ultrasound photo I used to carry in my purse. The name we had chosen together. The way I used to press my hand to my belly and imagine the soft coos, the tiny feet, the bedtime stories. Our daughter.

Gone. Ripped from me.

And now here he was, parading his son in front of me—the child born from lies and betrayal—claiming he’d carry his name like some badge of honor, while mine never even got to breathe.

He stepped closer, his voice colder now. “I will not let you hurt him. You can’t even carry a child anymore. Don’t take your jealousy out on an innocent—”

Jealousy?

My knees buckled slightly, but I stood tall. What he didn’t know—what he would never understand—was that I wasn’t jealous.

I was grieving.

And he was the one who buried my future.

“Jealousy?!” My voice cracked. “I didn’t choose to be kidnapped! I didn’t choose to be butchered—you made sure of that!”

“Watch your mouth,” he warned, then grabbed a fistful of my hair. “Apologize to Candice. Now.”

“No—”

“Apologize!”

He pushed me down into the broken vase shards. Pain tore through my knees. I bit my lip until I tasted blood.

“I’m sorry,” I whispered.

Candice stepped forward and reached for me with a gentle smile. “It’s okay. I forgive you.”

But as she leaned down, she whispered into my ear, “Now you know. Nathan and I… we aren’t nothing in this house. So maybe it’s time you disappear quietly.”

I met her eyes. My voice barely a breath. “Don’t worry. I will.”

I turned to leave, but Candice let out a fake burst and flung herself backward—slamming into the floor with a scream.

“Jackson!” she wailed. “She pushed me!”

And of course, he came running. Not to me. Never to me.

He checked her arms for bruises, cursed me under his breath, and stormed out with her in his arms while I bled on the glass alone.

But I didn’t cry.

I couldn’t. I had no tears left.

Later that night, a notification blinked on my phone. A new email from the lawyer I contacted.

The divorce is filed. Just needs his signature.

I stared at it for a long while. And then I printed it.

I found Jackson in the lounge, sitting beside Candice, who was draped in silk and sipping wine like she hadn’t just ruined my life. He kissed the back of her hand like they were in some fairytale.

“I need you to sign this,” I said calmly.

He looked up, annoyed. “Don’t you know how to knock? After everything you did to her?”

“I just need your signature,” I repeated. “It’s about the hospital. From when… when we lost the baby.”

He rolled his eyes, snatched the pen from my hand, and scribbled his name without reading it. “Now go.”

Chapter 4

The candle flame trembled just like my hands. I stared at it, unblinking, as I whispered the name no one would ever call. My daughter. No legal record. No grave. No lullabies. Just a name buried in my heart and a tiny blanket now placed beside the flame. The only thing she ever touched.

I prayed even though I didn’t believe God listened to women like me—wives turned into ghosts, mothers without children, hearts split open and stitched shut by lies.

And when the wick burned steady, I stood up. I had things to do.

I walked into our walk-in closet and grabbed every gift Jackson ever gave me. The perfumes, the shoes, the bags, the dresses. Everything that once made me feel loved—chosen. They were all lies now. Souvenirs from a life that was never really mine.

I dragged out the suitcases. Began to pack everything, like I was burying pieces of myself.

The zipper was halfway closed when I heard his voice behind me.

“What are you doing?”

I turned, calmly. “I’m burning them.”

His brows furrowed. “Burning what?”

“Everything. Everything that came from you. Every trace of us.”

His eyes widened in panic. “Samantha… is this because of what happened yesterday? Please. I didn’t mean it like that.”

I said nothing. I didn't have the energy to pretend anymore.

He crossed the room, dropping to his knees and wrapping his arms around my body from behind. “I’m sorry. Okay? I was scared. Confused. Nathan—he’s my cousin’s son. And now that my cousin’s dead, I’m responsible for him and Candice.”

I stiffened. “And does that responsibility include hurting me for her and her son when I am your wife?”

He flinched. Didn’t say a word.

“Thought so,” I muttered.

“It’s not like that,” he whispered. “Candice is vulnerable. She has no one. And Nathan… he needs someone stable. He will be my real son soon.”

Her eyes widened. “What do you mean by real son?”

I already knew. But I needed to hear him lie again.

“I mean…I’m going to adopt him, so… Can’t you just be nice to her?” he asked, like it was the simplest thing. “She’s been through a lot.”

I looked him dead in the eye. My voice turned razor-sharp. “What if I don’t want to?”

His jaw clenched. “What is wrong with you lately?”

I almost laughed. But there was no humor left in me.

“Nothing,” I said coldly. “I’m just hurting. Maybe that’s the part you forgot.”

Because how could I not hurt? When the child I once cradled in my dreams was stolen from me—cut from my body while I was wide awake—while this man, this liar, was playing house with the woman who replaced me. Candice. The one he claimed was just someone he was “helping.” The one whose child he now proudly paraded as his “adopted son.”

Adopted? What a joke. He could’ve at least respected me enough not to lie so poorly. I saw the way he looked at Nathan—with guilt, with love, with a possessiveness that went beyond mere responsibility.

That was no cousin’s child.

That was his.

And he knew I couldn’t give him another child—not after what he orchestrated. After what he did to me. I’d lost my chance to have a baby. My baby. My entire future. Because of him.

He rubbed his face like he was the one exhausted, then forced a smile. “Okay. I get it. How about dinner tonight? Just the two of us. Let me make it up to you.”

He always did that—used apologies like duct tape, trying to patch the gaping holes in everything he'd broken. But I wasn’t fooled anymore.

I paused. Then gave him a small nod. “Sure.”

But in my head, I already knew the truth.

Nothing he planned tonight would change the fact that he destroyed me.

And I would never forget.

Dinner was held in one of those candle-lit restaurants Jackson loved. The ones where the waiters whispered, and the wine cost more than my rent before I met him. He was all charm—smiles, soft eyes, flirting like the old days.

But I wasn’t the same woman anymore.

He talked. I nodded. He complimented me. I gave a half-smile. My phone buzzed under the table.

Inigo: Everything’s ready. Surveillance footage from the yacht. Audio from the hospital. His empire is going to fall. I’ll pick you up in two days.

Justice. It felt cold and necessary.

“What are you smiling at?” Jackson asked, narrowing his eyes.

“Nothing,” I said and slipped the phone back into my lap.

He reached across the table and snatched it. “Who the heck are you texting while I’m talking to you?”

“Give it back.”

“Open it.”

I stared at him. “It’s our anniversary.”

He grinned smugly. “Of course it is. Why is it not working? May 11, right?”

“Wrong.” I smiled coldly. “Maybe it’s the anniversary you have with your mistress.”

His face twitched.

“What are you talking about?” he said, trying to laugh it off. “You’re the only one I love.”

He dropped the phone, leaned closer again like nothing happened. But then his phone rang. His smile disappeared.

“What? Nathan? What do you mean he’s gone?”

He stood up so fast the table rattled. No explanation. No goodbye. Just ran.

I sat back, watching the empty seat across me. He always runs when things go wrong.

I finished my wine. Then went home.

The next morning, I was sipping lukewarm coffee in the kitchen when the front door burst open.

“Samantha Reid?” a police officer barked.

I stood frozen. “Yes…?”

Two officers stormed toward me, grabbing my arms.

“What is happening? Why are you taking me out?!”

And then I saw him. Jackson. Standing near the door, face tight with disgust.

“Her,” he told the officers. “Bring her to the station.”

“Jackson?!” I exclaimed. “What are you talking about?!”

“You know exactly what I’m talking about,” he snapped. “You had Nathan kidnapped!”

Chapter 5

“Please… please just let me go,” I begged, my voice strained from hours of crying.

My fingers clutched the cold iron bars, my knees numb from kneeling too long. No one answered. No one listened. The guards just stood still—unmoved, unfeeling—as if I were nothing more than a nuisance. A criminal.

But I wasn’t.

I hadn’t done anything. I didn’t even know that Nathan was kidnapped. Yet they were all blaming it on me?

The clang of heels against the tiled floor echoed down the hallway—and then I saw her. Candice. Her face painted in rage, lips curled like a snake ready to strike.

She stepped closer, eyes glinting with cruelty, voice sharp as glass. “You think you still matter? Jackson was never yours. He’s always been mine.”

I flinched, but she wasn’t finished.

“You were just a convenient replacement,” she sneered. “A stand-in. He needed someone when I married his cousin. But now that he’s gone…” Her lips curled in triumph. “Jackson’s mine again. As he always should’ve been.”

My breath hitched.

“And Nathan,” she added, lifting her chin, “he’s not just some poor orphan. He’s Jackson’s son. His real one. His blood. His heir.”

I staggered back as if struck again.

“So maybe instead of trying to kill him out of jealousy,” she snapped, “you should start preparing yourself. Because the only thing you’ll be to this family now is irrelevant.”

My mouth opened, but no words came. Just pain. Just silence.

“And don’t even think about crawling back to him,” Candice spat. “Because no matter what you do, you’ll never be enough. Not as a wife. Not as a woman. And definitely not as a mother.”

Jackson followed behind her, face tight with fury. “You’re the reason he’s in the hospital,” he said coldly. “Do you think the kidnappers were lying? They confessed that it was you.”

“No!” I shook my head violently. “I didn’t plan anything! I never wanted that boy hurt!”

Jackson added. “Because you're jealous, right? Because your own child died? So now you want my son dead too?”

I looked at Jackson—straight in the eye. “So you're admitting he's your son?”

He froze, but only for a moment. “Don't change the topic!”

I was still reeling when a staff ran up to us. “Sir—Mr. Smith—Nathan needs a blood transfusion. Immediately. But the hospital's out of supply for his rare blood type.”

Jackson looked at me. “What’s your blood type?”

I took a step back. My vision blurred. “I’m anemic. If you take blood from me—”

“She can do it,” Jackson said firmly. “She will do it. It’s the least she can do for what she’s done, so make her blood match! Bring her to the hospital now!”

“Jackson…” I burst out. “Please. I’ll faint. I might not—”

“If my son dies,” he growled, stepping closer, “I’ll make sure you rot in prison for the rest of your life.”

I was dragged to the medical room. I didn’t even resist anymore. Worse, I am indeed a match. The needle slid into my vein, and blood drained from me until my lips turned pale and the world tilted. My last thought before I blacked out wasn’t of pain—it was that he had said my son again. No more lies. No more pretending.

He had replaced me. And made me bleed for it—literally.

When I woke, the lights above me flickered. My arms ached. My vision still hazy when Jackson entered again.

I braced myself. He didn’t waste time.

“Did you send men to hurt Candice this time?”

“What?” I whispered, my voice barely audible. “I’m locked in a hospital room. How could I?”

His face twisted in rage. “Was that what you were planning during dinner? Who were you texting? What was in your phone?!”

“No one!” I cried. “It was nothing, I swear—”

He didn’t believe me. He never did.

“Guards,” he said sharply. “Make her pay.”

The next minutes were a blur of fists, pain, and screaming. I stopped begging. What was the point?

“Let me go,” I whispered once more. “Please… just be happy with them. Let me go.”

But Jackson only glared. “You’re not going anywhere. You’ll stay here. You’ll suffer until I decide you’ve paid.”

He slammed the door behind him.

They locked me inside. I couldn’t move. I couldn’t breathe.

All I could do was curl into myself, arms wrapped around my stomach, where my baby had once been. Where a child would never grow again. A place Jackson had destroyed, and yet still punished me for not being enough.

I drifted in and out of consciousness.

Until I heard footsteps—rushed, heavy. Not Jackson’s.

I flinched. My body recoiled in fear. Not again. Please not again.

But then—arms. Warm. Gentle.

“Samantha.”

That voice. My eyes shot open.

“Inigo…” I choked out.

He was here. My savior. My only chance.

“I’m sorry I’m late,” he whispered, holding my face between his palms. “But I’m here now.”

I nodded, barely believing he was real.

He wrapped a blanket around me and helped me to my feet. “Let’s get you out of here.”

We moved fast—quiet through hallways, into a van, into the night. I didn’t ask questions. I didn’t need to know where we were going. All that mattered was that we were leaving. That I wasn’t going to die in that place.

As the plane took off, I looked at the city lights shrinking below me, each one a false promise Jackson had ever made. And I whispered goodbye.

I know there are compounds in coffee that have additional health impacts beyond the caffeine. What I’m wondering is if you find that there’s something about coffee that makes it more invigorating than taking caffeine in isolation. Again, not asking about which is theoretically more invigorating; I want to know if you can actually feel a difference.

I’m trying the nap hack: Take caffeine right before you fall asleep so that the caffeine kicks in just as you’re ready to wake from your nap. I’m wondering if most people find it just as effective to take a caffeine pill for convenience, or is it is worth making a cup of coffee instead.

FYI, while on the subject: Caffeine sublimes when heat is applied. This means lighter roasts retain more caffeine than darker roasts do. If you want to rock your sleepy little world, go with a blond roast.",15,1753833468.0,Biohackers,29,1.0,False

I said to myself « I’ll never give up coffee, fried foods, or anything, most I’ll do is moderation » and held out on getting help for years and years. Then after severe bouts of stuckness in throat/esophagus, inability to even sleep without my head upright, I slowly cut out foods, first to go was McDonald’s McDoubles in february, I’d eaten it once a week since I was 2 but the acid reflux had been extreme (12+ hours, no sleep, worked late ate at 11pm). Got scoped in April, moderate gerd. Cut back on portions by quite a bit as symptoms worsened, gave up a couple triggers, resisted big ticket items like coffee or jimmy johns despite clear symptoms. Finally, July 14 I eat roast beef #10 at jimmy johns with a pickle, had same acid reflux even with smaller portioning and chewing slow, still resisted fried foods until July 17, chicken fingers pita and French fries (a weekend staple food in my life for 15 years), same horrible stuckness/acid reflux, after the pita it has stayed stuck in my throat for 11 days. I’ve had to cut and cut, last Tuesday finally cut caffeinated coffee, on Friday decaf and caffeinated teas (due to acid reflux), cut out basically all processed foods except frozen yogurt (which bothers it a little). I also had been struggling with managing my borderline and depression, came back from rough trip full of fighting July 12, gerd sent me on rocket July 14. But what I’ve learned despite the difficulty, is that I need to address my toxic relationship with food and now. Currently day 5 of a partial hospitalization program, wasn’t due to gerd but after signing up and before joining is when it turned severe. I’ve learned almost all foods bother it, some less than others, if I don’t take the medical advice of an elimination diet seriously I can’t build a fulfilling Life and be fully committed to the treatment I’m receiving  in therapy .

I’ve tracked it with the 8Sleep mattress over a few months, and it’s working pretty well.

Curious about your routines… anything mi missing?

•  300mcg of melatonin (bump to 600mcg if I’m up past midnight). Sticks close to what the body produces naturally

•  Magnesium glycinate and about 2-3g of glycine during the day/early evening. Glycine for GABA, neuroprotection, glutathione production. 

•  If I had stimulants late in the day, like coffee or occasional low-dose nicotine stuff, I throw in 25mg CBD to help bring REM back up. It counters the disruption super well. 

•  Lastly if I have an off day, bad day at the gym, a drink or two socially, I use 200mg of an herbal mix with valerian root, chamomile (for the apigenin), lemon balm, and passionflower. All GABA inducing antioxidants & mild sedatives that increase sleep efficiency boosting DEEP/REM even on a night with 6 hours of sleep.

I know this has been discussed before. But just seeing if anyone had any luck fixing this symptom?

It’s just started in the last 2 weeks. I do have a sore throat right now, which I’m not sure if it’s part of a virus and the meds are making it worse or if the meds are causing it! 

It feels like my throat is swollen and there is a bit lump in it. It’s also sore. Hurts to swallow a bit, but not like tonsillitis hurting or anything. 

I love taking Vyvanse as it’s helped me sooooo much and absolutely changed my life. I don’t want to stop taking it due to this side effect but it is really really awful to have this feeling in the throat all day. It is worse once the meds kick in, after they wear off it is still there but not as bad. 

Was anyone able to combat this with taking a course of PPIS? Nexium or omeprazole? 
I have some left over omeprazole that I was going to try. Or any other tips?

I already drink 3 litres of water and have a big glass of electrolytes everyday.

1mcriz5,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mcriz5/im_a_mormon_missionary_i_became_an_atheist_after/,I’m a Mormon Missionary. I Became an Atheist After Meeting a Demon,"I’m Greg Prince, or Elder Prince, I’m a current missionary for The Church of…well, the Mormon Church, if Elder didn’t give it away. I'm requesting to go home early after what happened.



It was just a week ago, I’ve been out on a mission for my church for 20 months already, male missionaries serve for 24 months, so I’m really close to finishing, but it’s not worth it. I’m in Mexico City, and my companion, Elder Gomez, was from Puebla, a 2-hour drive from Mexico City. I was born and raised in California, so I did visit Tijuana every now and then. I thought Mexico City would be a great place to serve a mission until I realized that what you see online or on TV about Mexico City is a tourist area where missionaries can’t really preach. The rest of Mexico City is a mixed bag, and last week I was assigned to the worst possible area: Tepito.



For those who don’t know Tepito, it’s a dangerous area in Mexico City; locals even think twice before going there. When you walk around, it seems fine at first, but there are all kinds of people here, and if you know them, they treat you like family, but if they don’t know you and you look suspicious, you need to leave. I heard horror stories from other Elders (elder is a title given to missionaries, even though everyone is in their early 20s) about that place. Elder Gomez has been in this area for 3 months, so he told me not to worry about it; missionaries never get in trouble in those areas.



The thing about Mexico is that it’s a very religious country, and missionaries are respected. I’ve heard stories that in the northern states where narcos are, missionaries are protected by them…indirectly, of course, but they respect missionaries to the point they’ll always make sure they’re safe while teaching the gospel. I wasn’t too sure if it would work here in the south, but I trusted Elder Gomez.



When we are transferred to new areas, we usually go to a small church where everyone gets together and the new assignments are given there. That day I had my bags, we had fun with the other missionaries, and went out to eat burgers, so when we got to the area, it was already around 6:00 p.m. At this time of the year, it’s already dark, and in dangerous areas like this one, we’re instructed to go back home earlier. We usually go out at 10:00 a.m and return at 9:00 p.m, but in these areas we need to be back by 7:00. My plan was to unpack my bags and worry about missionary work until the next day, but Elder Gomez is one of those missionaries we would call “pharisees”, which basically means they are all about the rules, so he insisted to go out and talk to some people in the remaining hour. Technically, he was what we call a “Senior companion,” meaning he knows the area better, he leads, and, depending on who you ask, has the final word. I was not in the mood to get into an argument, so I agreed and we took a small bag with our scriptures and some pamphlets. Elder Gomez said he was also trying to find a cat he had rescued from the streets a while ago but had recently escaped, a bad excuse, in my opinion.



Missionaries are often ridiculed in the media, once I saw this BuzzFeed video about Mormon Missionaries in California, and it portrayed missionaries as dumb, unaware of real-life struggles, sheltered, and ignorant. I have met some of those missionaries, but they are usually the minority. But thanks to those stereotypes, including South Park, of course, it can be hard to be taken seriously sometimes. I was born and raised LDS, short for Latter-day Saint, which is part of the church’s name: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and being LDS was not that different from my other friends at school. I guess I only didn’t drink coffee, and my Starbucks-loving friends thought it was weird. For those who don’t know it, the LDS church started as a restoration of the Church of Christ in 1830, when a 24-year-old Joseph Smith published a book called the Book of Mormon, which is where the nickname Mormon comes from. Those writings, as well as other revelations that Smith produced during his lifetime, are the reason mainstream Christians don’t consider Mormons Christian. Most will say we reject God’s divinity by rejecting the creeds’ definition of the Trinity and believing God has a physical body. I will be the first to say it can sound outlandish…but can something really be that outlandish when we talk about a God?



Anyways, this was just some brief background information because it will help you understand better what happened next. All I need to add to this is that I was genuinely a true believer, I wasn’t forced to be a missionary, and I loved the work I was doing.



Elder Gomez and I decided it would be best to just talk to people and schedule appointments for the rest of the week. We would stop people who were going in and out of stores called Oxxo, similar to a 7-Eleven. It worked, we scheduled some appointments, and by 6:45, we were getting ready to go home when I saw a small Catholic church with people leaving Mass…sometimes I would get carried away by debating Catholics or Jehovah’s Witnesses or TJs, as we called them by their Spanish initials. I told Elder Gomez we needed to talk to them. He said we didn’t have time, but I decided to walk towards them until Elder Gomez had no choice but to follow me.



I stopped an older man who was holding a cross necklace in his hand and a Virgin Mary bracelet. He was missing a tooth, wore worn-out jeans, black shoes, and a striped shirt that was open halfway, showing his chest. He was also wearing a straw hat that’s very common in these areas. He seemed like a good candidate for an interesting conversation.



“Hello, sir!” I said in my broken Spanish (I’ll translate everything, of course), “Are you…”



“Good heavens, it’s you guys!” the man spoke in a tired but kind voice. When he looked up, I realized he was older than I thought, at least 70. “I’ve been meaning to talk to people from your religion.”



“Really?” Elder Gomez joined the conversation, “What for?”



“I have some questions about the Bible that…to be honest, I’m not sure the Catholic Church can answer them. I've been questioning these guys, trying to find someone who could help me, but they give very poor answers.”



“What kind of questions?” I asked. I started to suspect the man’s motivations, because people who want to Bible bash often start as interested people. I wanted to debate, so I wasn’t against it, but I wanted to see if I could get one step ahead.



“Well, for starters, who wrote the Bible? People keep telling me it was God, but of course God didn’t write it and left the manuscript at a printer!”



“No, of course not, you’re right!” Elder Gomez said excitedly, “We would love to answer your questions!”



“Do you have time now?” The man lowered his voice when he said this.



“Well, we actually…” I thought it's be best to schedule a lesson for a different day.



“Yeah, we have time now,” Elder Gomez interrupted. I was certain he was just agreeing because most people agree to schedule a visit, but always mysteriously disappear when we actually show up at their doorstep.



“Alright, follow me, my house is just a block away.” The man started walking faster, and even straighter, almost as if he were a young man again. I was almost certain we were walking into a trap, and in a way I was right…it was just a different type of trap.



After walking a block to the right, just 2 blocks away from our own home, we saw his house. It was small and gray…most people build their houses out of cement and never paint them. In order to protect their house from thieves, they usually stick broken pieces of glass around the roof mixed with concrete as an improvised fence. This house had all of those features. It was a black gate leading to a small porch, then a black metal door into the house.



The inside of the house was mostly empty, all was gray, and most of the house seemed unfinished. The windows were old and didn’t protect the house from cold weather; in fact, the house was even colder than the outside. There was a room that could be the living room if it had any furniture, and a kitchen, which was just an electric burner with Coke glass bottles and onions next to it. There was only a toilet to the right and a room without a door that was blocked from our sight by a blanket that was taped to the wall. Everything was lit by a small lightbulb. It was just enough to see each other, but the house remained mostly dark. The man took out some paint buckets, turned them upside down, and invited us to sit down. By now, I was having second thoughts about debating him; he seemed like a good man, and I felt I would be taking advantage of that.



“I know you have to get home early, boys, so I’ll be brief,” The man said as he sat down in his own upside-down bucket.



“Don’t worry, we love to talk to people about the gospel,” I said. “Sorry, what was your name again?”



“Luz,” the man said, “I know it’s a girl’s name, but my parents thought it would be funny to name me that.”



“That’s a great name, it means you’re a light to those around you (Luz means Light in Spanish), maybe that's why your parents decided that name."" I said.



“If you knew my parents, brother,” Luz said, “You would realize just how wrong you are; they were demons in disguise…but they were right.” Luz’s smile was banished from his face, and he seemed to get angry at the memory of his parents. He began to move his jaw and whisper what sounded like gibberish. This went on for a minute, and Elder Gomez and I looked at each other as we weren’t sure what to do.



“Well, you said one of your questions was who wrote the Bible, correct?” I said confidently, trying to regain control of the conversation.



Luz didn’t answer.



“Sir?”



Luz looked up, playing with his cross necklace and Virgin Mary bracelet. “I know God didn’t write it,” he said, almost whispering.



“Yeah, it was Moses, and…” Elder Gomez started to say.



“No, not Moses either, how can you explain that he wrote about his own death? I thought you kids were smart!” He raised his voice in a mocking tone as he said this.



“You’re right,” I said, deciding it was too late for a debate, and thought it would be better to get out as soon as possible. “There’s a lot we don’t know, but we can share what we do know, now might not be the time, but we can sche…”



“Do you know why angels need to tell people ‘Fear not’ when they appear before them?” Luz interrupted



“No,” I said.



“It’s the eyes, the Bible describes them as wheels with eyes, some with wings that cover the feet, face, and fly…you’d freak out if you saw them.”



Luz laughed, too amused with his remark to pay attention to what we were doing. I looked at Elder Gomez to signal that we needed to get out of there, but he was trying to look past the blanket that blocked the room behind Luz.



“Is that your cat?” asked Elder Gomez



Luz immediately stopped laughing and looked behind him…there was nothing.



“I don’t have any animals here…”



“It looked like a cat I lost.” Elder Gomez was standing up, almost considering walking to the next room to chase what he thought was the cat.



“Here,” Luz stood up very quickly and walked towards the other room. As he passed the blanket, we could see it was an empty room too, but darker, almost as if it was painted black. It let out a foul smell, hard to describe, but the moment we smelled it, our eyes stung. Luz came back a second later with two mugs. “Drink up, guys, it looks like you haven’t had dinner yet.”



I took one of the mugs, and the smell was too familiar.



“We don’t drink coffee, brother,” I said, using my beliefs as an excuse to prevent a stomachache.



“I know,” said Luz, with an excited look on his face, “but why?”



“It’s called the Word of Wisdom…” Elder Gomez began to explain.



“I know, but that doesn’t answer the question.” Luz sounded impatient. “Take a sip of coffee, what’s the harm? Will God strike you down? Are you going to hell?”



“We don’t believe in hell,” I said, “at least not in the conventional way.”



“Exactly,” Luz said, sitting down in his bucket. “You believe in Degrees of Glory, that only Satan and a few people will actually go to what we would consider hell.”



“How do you know that?” asked Elder Gomez, blowing on the coffee even though he wasn’t drinking.



I wanted to leave, but I realized I was probably exaggerating and needed to let him bash us so we could leave. Plus, as an American, Mexicans usually saw me as a third wheel if my companion was Spanish speaking, and mostly ignored me.



“It’s funny to see people hold their beliefs to a holy standard, but are actually ignorant hypocrites.” Luz continued, ignoring what Elder Gomez said, “The whole Bible canon is a lie; all of it was written when a king decided they would worship just one god.”



Gomez and I were silent.



“Moses…David, Goliath…all made up, but there are some things that survived this religious purge…and it’s the angels, the challengers or ‘satans’, they were the real first religion.”



“No,” Elder Gomez blurted out. I stared at him to signal him to shut up; this wasn’t the time to defend truth, we just needed to leave.



“What’s your argument?” Luz asked



“God teaches truth, and people choose whether to follow Him or not. When people choose not to, it’s called apostasy, and when they are ready to accept the gospel again, it’s called a restoration.”



“So you believe this king was restoring truth?” Luz was on the edge of his seat



“Most likely”



“José, you’re not making any sense.” Luz stood up and took The Book of Mormon out of Gomez’s bag.



“How do you know my name?” Elder Gomez asked, even I didn’t know his first name.



“The Mormon God is proof of what I’m saying. You believe he has a body, an infinite number of wives…”



“We don’t…” I started to say.



“He lives near a star named Kolob…and you also believe he was once a man. That doesn’t sound like an Almighty God, it sounds like a regular guy, you're not Christian, you don’t believe in God.” Luz showed us The Book of Mormon as if the Book was proof of what he was saying, which was dumb, because The Book of Mormon doesn’t teach any of that.



“We have a better understanding of God,” Elder Gomez said, “But how do you know my…”



“So tell me, José, like you were telling Elder Maine the other day…”



“How…” Elder Gomez began to ask.



“Why do you believe Jesus and Satan are brothers?”



Elder Gomez seemed torn between answering his questions and asking how he knew his name and his previous companion’s name.



“You’re not leaving until we finish this conversation,” Luz said, standing up and getting in front of the door, putting his hand on his jeans’ back pocket, barely showing a knife. At this, we heard cries outside the door; it was clear he was not alone. I thought he might be schizophrenic, or I even thought of tackling him, but what if he was able to land a blow before that…



“Why do you care?” I asked.



“WE care,” he corrected, and steps were heard from the room next to us. His attention turned to Elder Gomez. “So, why are they brothers?”



“God created everyone; that makes us technically brothers and sisters, that’s pretty much it.”



“So God created Satan?” Luz asked, signaling us to drink the coffee that was still in our hands.



“Yes”



“Does that mean God created evil? If so, that’s a god that willingly decided to torture us.”



“Actually,” Elder Gomez said, “we believe God didn’t create good and evil; we believe they are eternal principles. God is good, but He didn’t create goodness. Satan was a son of God, and he chose that eternal principle to do evil.”



“So your God is even less powerful than you think,” Luz said as if he wanted us to realize something. “Your god is a guy who can only hope for the best. You might not realize this, but Mormonism is the closest thing we have to truth in this country, that’s why I was looking for you…I found you two weeks ago and have been watching you since. I need your help…but first, drink. After all, your god is just a guy who tries His best and won’t send you to hell, there’s nothing to lose.”



While Luz was talking, the room next door began to sound more and more crowded. We heard footsteps and whispers…where did these people come from? That room was completely closed off from any entrance. Elder Gomez began to drink.



“You too, güero,” Luz said.



Deciding it was better to leave than to prove a point, I drank. It was a strange flavor. I still don’t understand what people see in coffee.



“Drink ALL of it,” a voice from the room shouted.



We froze and turned to the room. It was still covered by the blanket, but it was moving wildly, there were children laughing, and we could barely see dark silhouettes.



“Drink ALL of it!” A deeper voice commanded, this voice was loud and clear as if it was in my head, I wondered if Elder Gomez heard it, but when I turned to look at him, he was drinking more intensely. I did too, at this point I was panicking, and could feel my tongue and throat burn from the hot liquid, but I didn’t care, I needed to get out of there…



My lips felt something sharp, and I looked down at the mug to find a small spine with ribs poking out of the coffee.



I dropped the mug, and Elder Gomez did too. Luz laughed.



“Sons, I’m with you on this…There is no god, but there are satans, and I need you to be vessels so we can enlighten people.” Luz held up the Book of Mormon. “This is truth covered in lies. This is also a lie.” He said, pointing to his Virgin Mary necklace, except I just noticed it wasn’t a Virgin Mary…it was a hooded skeleton, the Santa Muerte. “All benign deities are lies, made up to cover the original message.” Luz turned the paint buckets over to show us what was inside. It was concrete, with tips of fingers sticking out. “My full name is Lucifer, now you know why my parents thought it was funny. The devil is not Satan, but it is real, cabrones.”



Laughs started to come from the room next door, we heard children, women, and men, the laughing was mocking. The lightbulb went black, and as it went black, a match was lit in the other room, and we saw them, at least partially, as it was blocked by the blanket.



We saw numberless bodies; the room was so small it didn’t make sense that so many fit there. These bodies were taller than any of us three, and they seemed to be caressing each other.



“Go, Elders, spread the word!” The voice told us, and the door opened. We didn’t hesitate and ran out of the door.



We didn’t stop until we reached our home. Did this guy know where we lived? How did it ‘find’ Elder Gomez? I think my questions were answered when we turned the light on and found a black cat on the bed. Elder Gomez's blood drained from his face, and it confirmed his cat had returned home.



We prayed, we gave each other a blessing, and tried to sleep.



I woke up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat, staring back at me was a horned silhouette with eyes all over it. It wasn’t humanoid, it wasn’t a wheel either…but its shape was unlike anything I’ve seen before. It didn’t look like a lion, nor a bull, but it was wild, and looking at me, all eyes. It was silent, but I could feel its weight crushing my ribs, and I couldn’t breathe. The eyes moved in a circular fashion, and each movement sounded heavy, like rusty metal slowly moving. I could make out a voice in my mind. I wasn’t sure if it was real or in my head, but after a few minutes, I knew what it said:



“Fear not.”



I’ve seen this creature for the past week, every night, with the same message. I feel my body drained of its energy. The cat is still in the house, last time I checked. I tried to kill it, but my hands burned every time I tried. I wonder if Elder Gomez saw the same thing I did. There’s no way to know because he didn’t wake up the next morning…a heart attack, according to doctors. I’m moving to a new area, but I’ll request to go home and forget about religion forever, or find a cure to this hellish nightmare I find myself in. Luz was right, God doesn’t exist.

1mcriep,https://www.reddit.com/r/recoverywithoutAA/comments/1mcriep/this_sub_is_really_helpful_for_me/,this sub is really helpful for me,"in learning how to trust my judgement. when i was in a big group of people all basically saying you can never trust yourself again, all of them basically going along with stuff that i did not believe in, i had a weird feeling about it.

after like 2 years in i told someone that i didnt really believe in aa and i didnt believe it really worked the way they say it does.. he seemed really concerned and anyways for a variety of reasons eventually within a few months of that conversation the friendship ended.

i kept going for a while, the only response i really got to my skepticism in the program was that i needed to work more of a program. i felt fine and was happy in life not going to meetings and would sometimes not go for two weeks and then aa people would tell me ""you're living in untreated alcoholism"" and ""if i dont go to a meeting for a week i get really dry""...

so id get sponsees. i ended up getting one at a local ypaa meeting, and he turned out to be the most disturbed sponsee i could have ever had. after hearing his 5th step which was serial killer level disturbing i told some people i had a sponsee tell me really disturbing things in a 5th step. 

that led to some situations that were just too intense to deal with. one person i talked to vaguely about it wanted me to tell him who he was so a guy in a biker gang could kill him. then he got aggressive to me for ""protecting him"".

meanwhile sponsors and different people just told me i had to keep doing aa about it. one person in a really cruel way just like cut off his friendship with me. he told me because i broke confidence on a fifth step im not trustworthy, and that he just dreads when i call him etc. 

i have so many friends that love me and who i am, this fucking asshole is directly contrasted by all of these wonderful people i have in my life that truly know me. it really hurt on top of everything i was dealing with already as a result of ""working the program"".

doing aa got me into such an intense situation, when i was totally doing fine without any aa, i put together that none of the people in aa were actually qualified to give real advice based on the dogma of the program. i left aa and found this group.

i was sober outside of aa for like 6 months or so

anyways i had a reservation about psychedelics and cannabis so i broke my 3.5 years of sobriety and was smoking and tripping for 3 months. then i ended up hitting a wall where the only option was to go back to total sobriety. i just figured might as well try it out. im glad i did. not an experiment i can afford to repeat but it was truly good for me to do those things for a bit and then get crazy enough i had to stop completely.

i went back to aa and went through all the motions and tried it again. i got a hardass big book thumping sponsor and did all the steps with him. i went to the most culty meeting ever where it was led by the wife of one of the joe and charlie tapes people. she has a cult of personality around her but i have nothing against her personally. she was very nice to me and had me read the big book to this meeting of 100+ people. i made the coffee every tuesday and i had a good time for a few months.

a month into being sober again i met my girlfriend i still have over a year later, i got promoted to my dream job, and everything was going great. 

everything was going well 6-9 months in except the only negative element was my sponsor. and the things i heard in meetings started to really annoy me. not because i wanted to be lazy about recovery, but because i felt like it was actually harmful to recovery. the more i tried to work a program the less i enjoyed my life.

the straw for me was hearing one of the core sharers in this big book study imply if you dont go to this meeting every week youll be under a bridge drunk again before you know it. that you gotta constantly read the big book and do inventory and get sponsees otherwise youll relapse. and everyone just goes along with it. 

i was never doing enough program. i was never doing enough aa. i needed to be getting sponsees. my sponsor berated me for abandoning a sponsee i had. when i was spending my time productively building healthy relationships, and a little problem or a big problem came up, and i brought it to my sponsor, he did his job by the book which was tell me to inventory. which wasnt that helpful. so much guilt and shame about not taking sponsees. 

i switched back to my old sponsor from last time who was way more chill and less by the book but over the course of my 9th-10th month this time around i quickly realized the same things again. 

this program is so fucking arbitrary for me. i have a full life. i have so many hobbies and a cool career, and i do so much outside of aa. my relationships tend to go well. im not that bad of a dude. calling myself an alcoholic all the time doesnt keep me sober. not picking up drugs and alcohol keeps me sober. but in aa thats just like not enough. most of the people in aa i met led truly boring lives and the level of depravity people talked about engaging in as sober people was foreign to me.

started to see that the program people that are all about giving a good share, those peoples lives are fucking weird and sketchy and all they have is aa.


i actually hate the program. i gave amends to people who i should not even be trying to contact. i went along with all this stuff that had nothing to do with why i was staying sober all along

it became pretty clear that the aa program became the main source of negativity in my life. i have been so much better off not going.

this subreddit is very validating to me. hearing people who do not have anything i want basically say my way of living sober was wrong was so infuriating. i kept coming back because they told me to and you follow suggestion. i figured aa is what you do to get and stay sober.

aa did not get me sober. i got to the point i was committed to sobriety. i dont see the fucking point. its like dianetics or something.

happily sober, i dont deal with cravings anymore, i learned how to enjoy my life. i just see no purpose in going anymore. when i did try to sponsor im so busy with fulfilling things it was just awkward for me. i didnt believe the book was even that helpful or the steps it always felt like some arbitrary thing. i tried drinking the koolaid and acting like i liked it but i never actually did.

We’re planning a 4-day family trip to Copenhagen in August.
It’s me, my spouse, and our 3.5-year-old daughter. We’re staying at Comwell Copenhagen Portside Dolce by Wyndham and have the Copenhagen City Card Discovery, so we want to make the most out of public transport, museums, and attractions (while keeping walking stroller-friendly).

We’ve pre-booked tickets for these key attractions:
	•	Aug 4th: Experimentarium
	•	Aug 5th: Tivoli Gardens
	•	Aug 6th: Den Blå Planet Aquarium
	•	Aug 7th: Copenhagen Zoo

The plan is to keep it colorful and kid-friendly, with boats, parks, and chill cafes in between. We aim to be back at the hotel by 8 PM every day for rest.

⸻
Draft Itinerary

Monday
	
•	11:00 AM: Experimentarium (hands-on fun for kids & adults).
	
•	Lunch & stroll at Rosenborg Castle and The King’s Garden.
	
•	Coffee & snack at Andersen & Maillard.
	
•	Visit The Round Tower (great city views with a stroller-friendly ramp).
	
•	Pop into Museum of Illusions (interactive & quick stop).
	
•	Dinner at Restaurant Levi.

Tuesday
	
•	Morning Stromma Canal Tour (relaxing boat ride).
	
•	Treat stop at Vaffelbageren Nyhavn for ice cream.
	
•	11:00 AM – 4:00 PM: Tivoli Gardens (rides, playgrounds, and shows).
	
•	Chill evening stroll back to the hotel.

Wednesday
	
•	Visit Den Blå Planet Aquarium.
	
•	Lunch at Café Kystens Perle (near the waterfront).
	
•	Explore Christianshavn: canals, houseboats, maybe peek into Freetown Christiania (or skip if too much).
	
•	Dinner at Broens Street Food (casual outdoor vibe).

Thursday
	
•	Visit Copenhagen Zoo.
	
•	Lunch at Restaurant Allegade 10 (traditional Danish fare).

⸻

A Few Questions for Locals & Experienced Travelers:
	
•	Is this pace realistic with a toddler & stroller?
	
•	Are there any must-see places we’re missing (especially kid-friendly or relaxing spots)?
	
•	Would you swap out any activities?
	
•	Any restaurant/cafe alternatives that are better?

Thanks in advance for any tip!",0,1753833017.0,copenhagen,1,0.5,False
1mcrh4g,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mcrh4g,I’m back with a big update for my iOS app SupaCards: now with Widgets & Spotlight support!,"*Apologise for deleting and reposting this as the images were squished in previous one.*

\---

Hi everyone, I’m a solo developer. I usually work full-time in backend roles, but on nights and weekends, I built an iOS app called **SupaCards** to solve a simple but real problem I personally had.

**TL;DR**:  
I built **SupaCards**, a simple, privacy-first iOS app to store and scan your loyalty, membership, and rewards cards (like a Stocard alternative). No login, no tracking, fast access with widgets and Spotlight, and fully free to use — ads optional & removable. Would love your feedback!

Here're links:

My website -> [https://www.marcx.app/supacards/](https://www.marcx.app/supacards/)

App Store -> [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/SupaCards-loyalty-wallet/id6746959806](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/SupaCards-loyalty-wallet/id6746959806)



Here’s the story.

My wife and I have dozens of loyalty, membership, and reward cards and for a long time, we just stored them as photos in our iPhone gallery. But once you have more than a handful, scrolling through a messy photo album at checkout becomes a pain.

As a developer, I naturally wanted to build something myself. It started from a simple idea: an app where I could add a card in a few taps, even one tap, then open the app, find the card quickly, and display its barcode or QR code. No login, no clutter.

So back in May, I started and in mid-June, I released the first version of **SupaCards** (was named Locards). It was super minimal. But I got some great feedback from Reddit (thank you!), and it helped shape the app’s direction. Since then, I’ve added:

* **Widgets** for quick access from your home screen
* **Spotlight search** so you can find cards without opening the app
* **Card categories**
* **Custom designs and colors**
* **Optional ad removal via IAP**

Yes, I added banner ads. As a solo developer doing this in my own time, I need a bit of motivation to keep going.

Of course, **every feature in the app is free**, and **ads can be removed for the price of a coffee - $3.99**. No subscriptions!

To be honest, while building SupaCards, I learned more about the loyalty card app space than I ever expected. One of the biggest players, Stocard, which many users relied on for years, was acquired by Klarna, and recently, it shut down completely. Many users were forced to migrate, and not everyone was happy about it.

For users looking for a lightweight Stocard alternative, or a no-frills store card manager and digital passbook that just works, **SupaCards** is my take on what that should look like: clean, practical, and designed by someone who actually needed it.

I’m continuing to improve it, one feature at a time, and I’d love to hear from real users to shape where it goes next.

Thanks for reading. I'd love to hear any feedback, suggestions, or bug reports, appreciated!

If you try SupaCards and like it, a review on the App Store would mean the world. 🙏

They meet a couple of times, and then she asks him to meet her friends. They are too nice--like just bubbling over with positive energy.

After a couple of episodes (couple of coffee dates or walks in the park in-universe), he realizes she is part of a cult, but he can't decide if she is a leader or just a follower (twist!). His research turns up that they have been kidnapping people and sacrificing them, and killing family members that try to break their loved ones out of the cult.

The cult is well-organized, and maybe even has some LEOs in the group coordinating their security. Dexter learns about multiple plans happening at the same time to kidnap another sacrifice and kill somebody else's family member. He can't be in both places at once! Does he ask Harrison to go solo on his own mission to save one person, while Dexter does the same in a different direction?

The penultimate and ultimate episodes have Dexter having to fight and kill multiple cult members without the aid of a prepped kill room because he interrupts a ceremony, or they surprise and swarm him, forcing him to fight back instead of quietly drugging them into unconsciousness.

This show does not have enough CQC (close-quarter combat) and hand-to-hand fighting. When he fought Doakes with Jiu-Jitsu, I thought that was really exciting.

I'd like to see more episodes explore the fight getting away from him, or almost too-much-to handle and see him struggling to improvise moment-to-moment outside of his need for constant control--could definitely tie-in with him getting older / rusty.

What would be some other good villain archetypes for Dexter to go against in the next couple of seasons of Resurrection?

I was immediately attracted to them and our dogs loved playing together. I'd see them all the time, and even ran into them around town at other parks and coffee shops. They followed me on IG and so we became friends. I'd ask to hang and we'd go to dog parks and of course my attraction just grew. I've always been nervous around them.. and still am to this day! 3 months into knowing them, I decided to just let them know my feelings and so I called them and told them I had romantic feelings for them. They said they wanted to be friends because they were seeing someone (which they never mentioned).

Then I started dating someone shortly after, for about 6 months. Didn't see B at all during that time. Then that relationship ended and I ended up dating someone again for a year (the only time in my life I was a serial monogamist lmao), and I still didnt really see B aside from online. After my recent relationship ended, I started running into B again. And we reconnected, this was probably around November last year. They asked me to hang out and told me they were single.. I obviously still had a crush on them, but I wasn't sure where they were at about me, and I was getting mixed signals in a way like flirty vibes that time we hung out. I just felt like I wasn't interested in being friends -- I had like, a huge crush on them and was feeling resistant to just being friends (im a stubborn capricorn)

Then in February they asked me to hang out on Valentines day. I was like, what? it was still giving mixed signals. maybe it was just coming from a place of friendship and they didn't mean anything by it, but I was like maybe they are interested in me. So i asked, hey not to be presumptuous but do you want to be friends still because I told you I had a crush on you? and they said they want to be just friends. and I said I do too but the hopeful feeling isn't a dynamic I want in a friendship (im a big 'ol yearner). and so we stopped talking. But i kept running into them.. and it wasn't super awkward but I saw them like 2 times. and then a 3rd time at a music festival. 

So then that brings me to recent times. They asked me to hang out at the music festival, and we did, for like the entire afternoon and it was so much fun, we reconciled and had a moment. I mentioned that they asked me to hang on Vday and thats why I asked if they wanted to be friends. They validated me and said they understood why that would have been confusing. I had been reflecting on this boundary i set and felt that maybe I took it too personally that they just wanted to be friends and why couldn't I just be friends with someone I also have a crush on? its hard though.

We hung out again this past Sunday at their house and crafted and you know, it was especially difficult to turn the crush switch off. Yet they kept asking me questions about myself and if I'm dating and other relationship-y things and saying that they want to be friends with someone before being in a relationship. and Its just UGH. I'm feeling really confused? are they wanting to be friends with me? do they maybe have feelings for me and are exploring it? the hardest part is that we do have this *great* chemistry, funny banter, and we get along really well and we have similar interests, lifestyles, its like, really great to be around them and they are so funny and creative and nice and these are qualities I want in a partner.

I just really need to have a conversation with them about how I'm trying to protect myself so I don't get my hopes up all over again, because I could really see myself dating them, long-term, they are really so great and I like them a lot. I haven't felt this way in a really, long time, but maybe its just all in my head still. ",1,1753832461.0,WLW,2,1.0,False

Thank you to everyone for your kind wishes and comments! My baby boy was delivered safely via emergency c-section on the 24th of March and is now 4 months old and the sweetest little man! 

My in laws both mother and father make snide little comments. We had a rule of no visitors for 48 hours and they broke that rule to drop our puppy back home (even though that could have waited) they would stay for hours on end and ask us to make coffee and tea. They would ask if I was feeding him enough and the comments just drove me nuts. I have been diagnosed with post natal depression and anxiety because of all of their comments about my parenting. 

But now I face a new problem - my partner and I are planning our wedding for May 2026 here in Australia. I have my two sisters, my best friend and SIL as the girls standing beside me on the day and my partner has his brother and 3 best mates beside him. My mum and I are very crafty people so a lot of the things we are doing is DIY to save some costs. I am also the kind of person that wants things to be a surprise for people and not have the entire day spoken about already. My MIL asked what the colours were so she “didn’t wear the same thing” and I said the save the dates will have our colour scheme on it. Save the dates went out and they were white and lilac / purple. After the save the dates we went to my in laws for dinner and we were speaking about the wedding and I said the bridesmaids are wearing lilac. 

Last night I got a message from her saying she is looking at mother of the groom dresses and she was thinking LILAC. I went back and said “oh the girls are wearing lilac as that is the colours partner and I have chosen” she then replies back going “I thought the girls were wearing purple” I am about to yell at this woman that LILAC is a shade of PURPLE!! 

This isn’t the first problem with wedding planning. Then venue we are getting married at had 2 reception places to choose from - an upstairs ballroom vibe or a downstairs wine cellar / cigar lounge vibe. My partner and I chose the downstairs room as it suits us so well and we are both not the ballroom type of people. Both rooms have private bathrooms and are wheelchair accessible for grandparents who are older. When we told them the paces we chose (the venue is part of a hotel we visit frequently with them) they told us we made a horrible choice and we need to be more considerate of others opinions. All of this was said on a phone call to my partner which they don’t know was on speaker and I heard it and was also on the phone to my mum and she heard it. My partner told them it’s our day and if they or others don’t like our choices then tough cookies because we are choosing what we want. 

When it came to me going dress shopping here in Australia they limit how many people we can take. I wanted my mum (she is buying the dress) and my sisters first and then if able my bridesmaids. My MIL told her husband who then told my partner that I was excluding her from dress shopping and as mother of the groom she should go. My partner explained the limits at dress shops and I’m allowed to ask who I want and I’m not intentionally leaving her out. 

This whole thing is causing me to now actually hate wedding planning, some days I’m like do I really want to get married. I feel like I am being robbed of the joys of planning a wedding. 

My fiancé has my back 100% and he has said even he is gobsmacked by some of their behaviour and doesn’t understand why. If anymore things happen he will be telling them to back off as I like to keep peace for my own mental health.

**Luka’s POV**



I slam open my door as I stumble in. It's been a week since the whole thing with Ethan happened, and the Captain wasn’t happy with our performance that day. And so the last few days have been the same routine of wake up, get dressed, train from before the sun rises to well after the sun goes down. Then I get to eat what can only be described as prison food, shower, sleep, get up, and do it all OVER again! 

I stumble over to my only safe haven. My bed! Flopping face-first, my bed welcomed me by letting me sink into it. Softness and warmth, oh how I have missed you, my one true friend. I’ve missed you. I said to myself. But most of my body is still lying on the floor… I should get to fixing that. So with what little strength I have left, I pull myself further into bed, but this isn’t enough! I need more comfort! So I grab my blanket and begin to roll myself up in it until I can no longer find my way out of it. Ahh, that’s so much better, I sigh in contentment. 

“Now sleep, be a dear and take me before eleven. I want to at least try and get four hours of sleep.” And thankfully, it seems like sleep heard my request because I could feel my waking mind shut off. The darkness took me in record time, and the feeling of floating greeted me. 

Huh… This is new? It feels like I’m drifting in lukewarm water. If it were a few degrees warmer, I would call it pleasing. Oh wait!? Is it getting warmer? It is! Ouch! Did I fall out of bed or something? Rolling over and trying to stand up, I realized I’m not in… my… room.

Looking up, I’m greeted with some kind of temple coated in a thick layer of darkness. But wait… is that a fire? I– oh wow, that’s warm! Well, let’s check this place out, but first, just to make sure it’s really the only way to go… Oh yeah, there is literally nothing behind me. Behind me, there was a seemingly bottomless blackness that looked like some of the things Grandma said she fought against. Okay then, Luka, that’s enough looking into the void! Turning around and scaling up the stairs, my paws fell on each step, each feeling like stone cold, hard, yet smooth? Deciding to try and get more info, I try to see if I could get any smells that might feel me in. This place, wherever it is, doesn't have any smell to it. Okay, Luka, be careful. Places like this are always bad news. 

And that feeling seems to be proven correct. Now that I’m at the top of the stairs, this place continues to give me the creeps. It looks like there’s nothing inside this damn darkness, it's too much to see anything through! But as if on cue, a purple flame on a podium burst into life, bathing the inside in its glow. Hesitantly, I take one step after the other into the heart of this place, silently hoping nothing jumps out at me. Man, I’m really starting to regret all the times I jumped out and scared folks.  

“Hello…” A voice echoed from all around me. 

I scream in a higher pitch than I would like to admit. Spinning around, I try to find the source of the voice. But I only see the same darkness that this whole place is covered in. Oh Gods damnit! Why can’t I just go to sleep and have a normal dream!? 

“W–who’s there?” I squeak out while still looking around for whoever just spoke. 

“My apologies. I didn’t mean to scare you. You don’t have to worry, there’s no one else here but us, and nothing that could hurt you in any way.” The voice said in a calm, if not somewhat mischievous tone. But something else I’m just starting to notice is that whoever they are, their voice sounds super warbly. Like something or someone is running their voice through a speaker underwater.  

“Well, if you want me to be less scared. Which I’m not by the way! You could start by showing yourself!” I say as I back up towards the podium with the purple fire. 

The shadows started to move, flowing back and forth like ocean waves. Then they started to rise up, looking like someone coming up from underwater, and the water’s tension hasn't broken yet. One of its arms became visible, and a liquid shadow dripping off of it, the same as some thick, viscous sludge. It rose from the rest of the way, the rest of its limbs becoming distinct and lurching over towards me.  

“I’m sorry about my appearance. This place and, by extension, I am still rather young.  As such, we don’t have a stable form. In time, I can become something more… appealing.” It says the shadow's voice is somewhat distorted.  

“What even are you? And where or what is this place!?” I ask my voice, starting to regain a little more of its usual confidence.

“Those are some hard-to-answer questions… But to try and satisfy your curiosity, this is the heart of the…” But I couldn’t hear what it was saying. It was like everything was starting to fall out of focus. A bright light began to take over my field of view, and before I knew it…

A loud knocking on my door. And my head was pounding just like what was happening to my door. I roll around in my bed, trying desperately to find something to cover my ears. 

“Luka! Get up! Freud said Get ready!” Olva yelled at me from the other side of my door. I did the only thing I could really think of, and that was to groan in annoyance as loudly to signal that I was semi-conscious. I think she heard me because I think I heard her walk away, the sound of her claws clicking on the cold stone floor. 

Groaning once more, I rolled out of bed and onto the cold, hard floor. I want to go back to sleep…

In a few minutes, I’m up and out of my room, wearing the cleanest and best-smelling pair of workout clothes I have right now. Although clean and best smelling is a stretch considering the fact that what I’m wearing is caked in dirt, still damp in a few places from sweet and… other liquids. And overall, it smells like something that I would need to fish out of the boys' locker room. That was the only way you could recreate this smell.  

As I enter the living room, Olva is sitting on the couch reading yet another book, and if I’m right, it’s a new one. I swear she has enough books to open her own store. Something that is sticking out to me is the fact that she was wearing street clothes. A pair of navy blue pants and a shirt in the same color with the words Hot Girl Alert in bold on them, she also has on some black sandals to complete the look.   

“Morning, Olva. I know that we haven’t really had time to wash our clothes, but I don’t think that you want to be wearing something so nice out on the field.” I say as I move closer to see what she’s reading. 

She pulls the book closer to her and away from my prying eye. “Oh? OH shoot! I forgot! Freud said that we were going into town today. But he also did want to see you, though.” She explains quickly, trying to make up for her earlier mistake.  

“Oh my Gods! We're going into town!? Finally! Okay, where’s Freud?” I ask, my excitement getting harder and harder to control. 

“He's on the boy's floor.” She answered. 

“Got it! See you in a bit!” I say as I rocket out the door and practically fly down the stairs. The next day, after the Captain got back, she had me and Olva move to the floor above where we were staying before. Apparently, this is how it usually was, and the fact that Olva and I were staying down there was a mistake that Freud had forgotten to mention or correct. Which led him yet again to get chewed out so bad that I was afraid that if I moved, she would turn the same fury at me. 

Once I was down the stairs and in front of the door to the boy’s room, I poked my head in and was able to spot Freud doing something on his laptop. Knocking on the door to get his attention, his head snapped up like I had just broken him out of some kind of trance. 

“Oh… Luka. Good Morning, did you sleep well last night? I know that the last few days have been the opposite of… pleasant.” 

“Well enough. Nothing I can’t power through! But onto something more important, Olva told me that we are going into town, right?” I ask. I kinda of really want to make sure this is true because, honestly, I could use a break. Doing some mindless shopping and sightseeing would be sooooo nice. 

Freud looks taken aback in the very subdued way that I’ve come to know him for. But he regained his composure with a speed that I still can’t seem to wrap my head around.  “Well, I see… Yes, yes, we are. The Captain believes that we have “earned” some time to ourselves. She has “something” planned for us, and it seems she is being nice enough to give us a breather.” He explained, closing his laptop and setting it on the small coffee table in front of him. Standing up, I’m able to get a better look at what he’s wearing. That being grey pants, a white shirt, and a black jacket, all lacking any uniqueness or whimsy. It’s very… no, really depressing. I should help him find something that doesn't scream ‘Yes, I’m a very depressed office man.’  

“Yes! Okay, before I forget, Olva also said you wanted to talk to me about something?” 

“That I did.” He pauses, taking a deep breath and massaging his temples. “But… it can wait for later. For now, go get cleaned up and put on something fresh.” He says. It’s obvious he’s hiding something, but I probably shouldn’t press him on it. So for now, I guess I’ll leave it. 

“Alright then. When should I be ready?” 

“You have an hour and a half before our ride gets here. Try to be ready before then, though.” He says as he does a quick stretch and walks back to his room out of view. Well, I guess I'd better go get dressed in something better than dirty sweats. I spin on my heels and walk around to the stairs, heading up and back into the dorms. 

Once I was back upstairs, I greeted Olva, who had now moved to the small kitchen area we have. Checking the cabinets again for something to eat, I guess. “We still don’t have anything sweet to eat.”  Reminding her as I walk past. A groan follows me as I head to the bathroom. 

Our new bathroom is a small and simple thing. Plain white tiles on the wall and floors, and nothing else of real note. Sink had some beauty and self-care stuff and, of course, toothbrushes. The bathtub slash shower is the same. We thankfully have two small shelves which have some basic soap and detergent, the type of things that don’t have any recognizable names. It probably is pretty cheap to get a bunch of it for the barracks. Turning the shower knobs, I let it run for a bit to let the water get warm, and while it does that, I throw my clothes on the toilet. As soon as the water is hot enough for me, I hop in. 



**40 Minutes Later…**



Alright, what to wear? What to wear? I mean, we’re going into town, so maybe something casual? Ok, so if we’re going casual, what type should I roll with? Baggy and comfy, slick and fashionable, ooo oooooooor! Actually no… I should shut that down before I make myself look stupid… Strutting over to the little dresser, opening it, digging through, and grabbing something to wear. A simple sunset-themed knee-length skirt and a short shelf that had the same theme. The bottom part of the skirt is a beach with some seashells and a couple sunbathing, while the upper part, closer to my waist, is the ocean bathed in an orange glow. My shirt is my favorite part, as from bottom to top it looks like gentle waves with a few small birds and fish ending with the sun over where my heart is. 

I do a little trill, and with that, I’m done! Now let’s get my purse and… ready! While I sling my purse over my shoulder, a knock rings out from my door. “Hey Luka, you ready? Freud said the car is here!” 

“Oh! Yeah! I'll be down in a sec!” I say back. 

“Alright, I’ll let him know. See you outside.” She says, walking away from my door and out of earshot. Let’s make sure we have everything… wallet, knife, phone, keys for the barracks, and… charger for phone! Okay, have everything I’ll need. Let’s not keep the others waiting! Bursting out of my room and out of the girls’ section down the stairs and jumping the last few, sticking the landing with ease! Outside, Freud and Olva are standing next to a taxi, its grey colouring making it recognizable.  Once they noticed me coming out, Freud opened the car door for Olva and me, closing the door behind me before getting in the shotgun. 

Without any words, the driver started up the car, and we started to pull away from the grey block that is now my home. Although it feels more like a prison after we got back from the rescue mission for Ethan and Olva. Actually, let’s not think about that more than I have to. After all, I'm finally getting to head into the town I’m supposed to be protecting! I should be thinking about what I’m going to do with the limited amount of freedom I’m about to have.

While I’m thinking about that, I noticed something that seems hard for me to have missed before. A big grey and kinda green… wall? Yeah, that looks like a wall. Has that always been there? If so, then how have I not noticed it? OH! Wait, I've spent the last few days getting my ass blasted into the ground. Turning my head from the giant curiosity, I go over the pros and cons of asking Freud about it, but with him on his phone… Nah, screw it. 

“Hey, Freud! What’s with that wall over there?” I ask, pointing at the grey and green eyesore over the horizon to our left. 

Freud looks up from his phone, giving it a half-second glance before going back to his phone. “That’s the Gahala Wall, the outermost wall that protects the Kingdom of Eswal. There are three other walls, all of which were made during the war, to act as one of the many defensive barriers that worked to protect what few royals and nobles who had managed to flee the worst of the fighting. Eswal was actually the name of the noble who owned the castle that has been made the center of this place and the new royal castle for the King.” Freud’s tone sounds so bored and almost lifeless, like he had to have repeated this a lot of times.

“Eswal is broken up into many different smaller towns and cities confined within the four walls. Although some parts of Eswal are specifically designated for different things like prisons, factories, or farms, and the like.” He continued listing off a whole list of different facts and other small things about Eswal. Honestly, I’m regretting asking him this. Looking at Olva, she looks inraptured by it. Well, at least one of us is enjoying this. 

“Hey, Freud! Could you tell us about the town we’re heading to?” Olva asks, cutting Freud off, and it looks like it has successfully knocked free of whatever pre-rehearsed script he must have been forced to memorize.  

He leans back in his seat, looking out at nothing to the right of us. Well, minor correction. It’s not nothing, it's just a bunch of empty fields with nothing going on. So, more or less nothing. 

“Well, it’s nothing special. We are heading to a small town named Zike Lake. It got its name from the fact that it sits on the edge of the Zikelafos sea. As a port town, it’s just as busy as you would imagine: plenty of shops of all kinds and almost every kind of food you can think of. But don’t worry, you’ll see it in its full glory in a bit.” Freud concludes. 

“I’m so excited! I just can’t wait to stretch my legs after so long! And maybe I can finally get something sweet.” Olva squeals in delight at the thumping sound her tail is making on the car seat, going the extra mile to show it. 

“Well, if this place is going to be so exciting, I’m going to close my eyes for a bit then. One of you wake me when we get there.” I said as I leaned my head against the window, a yawn weaseling its way out of my mouth.

“No problem,” Olva said

“Sure,”  Freud answered. 





**30 Minutes Later…**



I stir from my dreamless sleep by the rough shaking of smooth scaly hands. My eyes flutter open as I see Olva leaning over me. I reflexively groan and swat at her with my tail, which only leads to what I think is the sound of Freud. Well, whatev— Suddenly, the car door I’m leaning against opens, and I find myself staring at the ground. Huh? Is it getting closer? Oh wait… I’m falling. Oh shit, I’m falling! Desperately flailing, I try to grab something, but at last I can’t reach anything. As I’m getting ready to accept my fate, something grabs my collar. 

“Whops, that was close. Are you awake now?” Came the monotone cadence of Freud’s voice. Did he… Did he open the door and almost let me fall? He left me up and out of the car, holding me in the air with one paw. How much do I weigh for him to just do this? 

“Could… Could you not have just shaken me awake? Like a normal person?” Maybe my tone is a bit confrontational, but I don’t care! I refuse to be lifted into the air like I’m some stray kitten!

“We tried the normal way. That didn’t work, so we did things my way. It looks like it worked, too, so I don’t see anything to be too upset about.” I can’t tell if he is being a smartass or not. 

“Well, can you put me down now?” 

“Of course.” Slowly, I’m reunited with the ground but not face-first. 

“Okay, Freud, where are we heading first?” Came Olva from my blind spot. She hopped out of the car, gently closing the car door behind her, and Freud did the same to the door he pulled me from. Once, Olva was next to me on what I am now starting to realize is a sidewalk. Freud moved over to the taxi driver and said something to them before returning to us. He steps away from the taxi, and it starts driving away once they're out of view. He turns back to us. 

“I was thinking we should go and get something to eat first. Showing you two around on an empty stomach is a bad plan. And I know a lot about bad plans.” He says more to himself than to us, a small laugh rolling out of his mouth. 

“OH! Where are we going to eat at!?” Olva’s tail starts thumping against the ground again, hard enough that I’m starting to wonder how she isn’t hurting herself. 

“It’s just a simple family restaurant that me and the rest of the gang used to eat at every now and again.” He answers. 

“Cool, how far is this place? I could go for something to eat. I'm starving!” I ask while rubbing some more sleep out of my eyes and the dried drool from my mouth. 

“Not far, just a few blocks away from here. I wanted us to stretch our legs a bit before eating. And plus I can show you some other things that you might find interesting.” 

“Sweet! Let the tour begin!” Olva shouts in a tone all too similar to the kids back home when one of the adults offered to take some out on the water. 

A small smile paints Freud's face as he signals for us to follow with a swish of his big and I’m only now releasing fluffy tail. 

Taking a moment once I have regained enough brain power to start looking around. It looks like we're standing at some kind of central plaza. The roads lead out in several different directions, all forming a circle around a giant bronze statue. I think it's supposed to be a statue of the... or maybe a king? Whatever, I'll just ask Freud about it later. But stepping away from that, there are some stores that are selling everything from what my keen eye tells me are clothes, electronics, oh, a few toy stores, and some other places that sell other miscellaneous things. Focusing more on the buildings, they're made out of some kind of emerald green bricks that remind me of the sea when the light hits them just right. They are small and boxy, kind of like some of the old folks back home. That thought of those guys' faces on the front of these buildings pries a laugh out of me. Their signs are all in big bold letters, although some of them had some... well, to be nice, I guess... interesting? Font for some of them. I bet someone thought that they would look just as good in the real world as they did in their head. Other than that, none of these buildings had anything to really write home about. Huh, I guess that can be taken literally for me.

But something else that can't be ignored now is the fact that there is barely anyone around. It can't be that early in the morning, right? I guess I'll add that to the list of questions I'll have to ask Freud later. I think to myself, shrugging and following behind my two friends.",4,1753832087.0,HFY,2,0.84,False

- **Media? Not really...** TV, movies, music, videos... it is ***not*** how I connect as a *foundation* for friendship. I need more, a lot more. However, I like rock, grunge, alt, punk, folk/indie, and some 80s and 00s pop. I watch family sitcoms and The Office. Futurama. AHS, Twilight Zone, and Black Mirror. ""Crazy Ex-Gf"" too. But i rarely watch anything.
Idc to watch movies much, either. But I like cult classics and B movies....and Marvel is pretty cool. TBC, I do like these things, just not as a foundation for friendship, or as starter convo.
I also have 0 interest in video games 😬

I **LOVE** silence 🏝

-----------------------------------

Im seeking platonic connections, but I am open to more potentially happening with a woman. To not be misleading, I am engaged to an enby and we practice ENM. Not looking for a triad or anything, and friendship is more important to me rn.

You dont have to make your intro this long! 😅 BUT *pretty please* put...
- age, gender, general location
- what we relate on
- some of your interests and hobbies 
- tell me something you like about yourself, so i know you read the post (get yourself that credit :).

It's like using Google when all I want is Perplexity,"**TL;DR:** Every trading platform has a million features but I just want to test if my simple idea works. Why is this so hard???

Ok this has been bothering me for months and I need to rant/see if anyone else feels this pain.

I have trading ideas. Simple ones. Like ""I think tech stocks bounce back stronger after earnings disappointments"" or ""oil prices seem to affect renewable energy stocks in weird ways."" Normal human observations that I want to test with actual data.

So I open up QuantConnect or TradingView or whatever platform everyone recommends. And I'm immediately hit with:

* 47 different chart types (WHO NEEDS 47??)
* Custom indicator builders
* Advanced portfolio optimization with 23 adjustable parameters
* Risk management dashboards that look like NASA control panels
* Live data feeds from 12 exchanges I've never heard of
* Paper trading simulators
* Social trading features??
* Monte Carlo simulations (I don't even know what this is)

It's like opening Google Search and being forced to use Advanced Boolean operators when I just want to know if it's raining outside.

**Here's what kills me:** Perplexity figured this out for search. You ask ""is coffee bad for you?"" and you get a straight answer with sources. No 15-tab configuration nightmare.

But trading platforms? Still stuck in 2015 apparently.

# The problems I face EVERY. SINGLE. TIME:

**1. The syntax hell** Want to test buying AAPL after 3 red days? Cool, first learn Pine Script. Or Python. Or their weird SQL-like query language. My simple idea is now a programming course.

**2. Analysis paralysis**  
I spend 2 hours setting up slippage models and commission structures. By the time I'm done I forgot what I wanted to test in the first place 😅

**3. Documentation rabbit holes** Every platform has 200-page manuals. YouTube tutorial series. Community forums with 10k posts. I just wanted to see if momentum works better on Fridays...

**4. Feature discovery nightmare** I KNOW the platform can do what I want. It's hidden somewhere behind Menu → Settings → Advanced → Custom → (???) → Oh there it is, under ""Miscellaneous Tools""

# What I actually want:

Me: ""Hey, I think bank stocks do well the week before Fed meetings. Is that true?""

Platform: *30 seconds later* ""Yep, 2.3% average outperformance, 68% win rate over 5 years. Want details?""

Me: ""Cool, what about tech stocks?""

Platform: ""Tech stocks actually underperform before Fed meetings. Here's why...""

**THAT'S IT.** No Pine Script. No parameter optimization. No feature discovery. Just: idea → test → result.

# The irony

These platforms are INCREDIBLE. They can do things that would make Goldman Sachs quants jealous. But it's like having a Formula 1 car when I just need to drive to Starbucks.

All this sophistication but I can't test a simple ""buy the dip"" strategy without feeling like I need a computer science degree.

Meanwhile I can vibe-code an entire web app by chatting with Claude, but testing ""do meme stocks follow Bitcoin?"" requires learning a whole new programming language? Make it make sense.

# What we actually need

Look, I've talked to dozens of traders about this. We all want the same thing:

1. Describe idea in normal human words
2. See if it works
3. Understand why
4. Maybe tweak and test again

That's literally it. We don't need 47 features. We need ONE feature that actually works the way humans think.

**The future should be conversational.** ChatGPT for trading strategies. Natural language in, backtest results out.

Because here's the thing - the best trading strategies in history were simple ideas, properly tested. Our tools should be simple too.

Anyone else feeling this gap or am I just lazy? 😭

I'm still not interested in getting with anyone.  I'm pretty conten on my own and no one can match my husband.

I didn't recognize him initially so he wandered around while I was figuring out if it was him or not.  I was extremely busy with my job and something occurred which made for a quick exit for most of the patrons.  He is quite attractive and about 10 years younger than me.  

I cannot imagine him actually being interested nor any of the other men who have been paying attention.  Again, I am so poorly socialized that I Ned an explanation as to what is going on.",10,1753831340.0,datingoverfifty,24,0.86,False

My workplace mandates 3 days a week in office, but they can be any days of your choice. 

I essentially go in for 2 full days a week - the days when I know my team are all likely to be in-office as well. So I show face, the team sees me there, no reason to raise any  alarms.

For my third mandatory day, I've begun coffee-badging. I badge in, go up the elevator to my team's floor, badge in to the team's floor, spend maybe 20 minutes there (pretty early in the morning, so nobody from my team's there to see me), and then leave. I still work remotely the rest of the day and get all my work done.

But recently, in a team meeting, my manager mentioned to us that ""the company has noticed an increase in coffee-badging, and is monitoring it,"" basically warning us not to do that. No clue whether it was directed to me specifically or if it's actually happening company-wide. But about 3 weeks after I started doing it, my manager made this announcement to our team. 

My question is, if we don't even swipe out, how can they monitor this? The company has several hundreds of employees - are they actually watching for coffee-badging using the building's security cameras? Are they telling the workers in the lobby to look out for it? Are they looking at the times/number of swipes each day and just assuming that if you only swiped into one floor early in the morning and then never again, that you probably left? 

TL;DR - I would just like to know how such a thing can be ""monitored"" without a swipe-out system

I was uptown at Mt Sinai for my annual mammo and wanted to grab a nice bottle of wine for a lil treat after. Google led me to Rosenthal Wine Merchants on 101 and Lexington and BWT, this place was such an amazing find!  Their wines are all from small vineyards in very specific regions in Europe (France, Italy, Germany only I believe…). They have direct relationships with all the vineyards and the woman who helped me was so knowledgeable.  The prices were amazing and the shop had a loungey coffee shop vibe- big open windows, couches and chairs, big beautiful wooden tables for tastings, etc. 

The wines were all super niche and apparently many of them aren’t sold anywhere else in the city. I don’t know a ton about wine but the shop felt really special and like the type of family-owned and operated place that doesn’t really exist in NYC anymore. I’m already planning to trek back up there around the holidays to stock up on client and other gifts.

1mcqkiu,https://www.reddit.com/r/exHareKrishna/comments/1mcqkiu/seeking_advice_for_a_family_member_who_practices/,Seeking advice for a family member who practices actively practices Krishna Consciousness,"Hi everyone,

I’m having a bit of trouble articulating this perfectly, so I’ll get straight to the point. Sorry in advance if this is too long.

My maternal cousin is currently pregnant, expecting her baby in September. She was born to initiated ISKCON devotees, and while my mother and I have only recently developed a deep interest in Vaishnavism, we remain close to her family. I’m especially close to my cousin, even though her parents have often viewed me as a “bad influence.”

Tragically, her husband, also a devotee, passed away suddenly a month ago due to a stroke. As you can imagine, it’s been heartbreaking for her, especially during such a vulnerable stage of her pregnancy. But even through the grief, she’s been pushing through, trying her best to stay strong for her unborn son.

Until now, she never had issues with ISKCON. She and her husband used to live and work outside of India, and she only came back after his passing to be with her parents during this time. She even considered staying in India to raise the baby. 

However, something that happened recently has left her deeply anxious and shaken.

During her *god-bharai* (baby shower), a number of devotees made comments that at first seemed well-meaning, but quickly spiralled into disturbing territory. They started saying things like how she’s “blessed” that a demigod or exalted Vaishnava from a past life is taking birth in her womb. That was tolerable, but then they went further: saying she’s *lucky* the child isn’t a girl because if it had been, she’d have had to “keep her daughter away from the temple” (yes, due to the presence of potential child abusive *prabhus,* which they make it seem like it is completely normal).

They also insisted her son should be sent to a *gurukul* in Mayapur and claimed he was probably destined to become a *brahmachari* and serve Srila Prabhupada’s mission. My cousin was stunned. It felt like they were speaking of her unborn child as some tool for fulfilling their spiritual projections.

But after hearing those remarks, she passive aggressively objected, and that’s when things immediately got defensive, accusing her of Vaishnava aparadh, blaming her pregnancy hormones and her grief over her husband for questioning their “harmless advice.”   
  
One prabhuji even remarked that they were trying to guide her since they didn’t want her son “to turn out like her aunt” (referring to me), just because I don’t have a father and neither will her child. So basically saying that my nephew would turn into a half assed coffee drinking Vaishnava because he doesn't have a father figure. They implied that as a woman and single parent, she wouldn’t be able to guide her son properly in Krishna Consciousness without a husband. It was so freaking audacious that she didn't really have words to argue more, they'd only see a defiant woman not a protective mother.

Now, my cousin is desperately looking for ways to raise her child safely, away from these kinds of toxic expectations and ideologies. She’s afraid of her child being groomed into becoming “the next Prahlad Maharaj,” by these gurus and matajis instead of simply being allowed to grow up as a human being. Even her own parents didn't completely defend her during this event (I wasn't present because what's the use of a non devotee in a room full of pure vegetarian devotees right?)

I’ll admit, I was hurt by their comparison... suggesting my nephew should avoid becoming someone like me. But right now, my focus is on helping my sister. She came to me for advice, and I didn’t know what to say. So I’m turning to this subreddit, because I know many of you have experienced the same kinds of subtle (and not-so-subtle) grooming and spiritual abuse that she’s trying to protect her child from.

What advice would you give her?

How can she start distancing herself (and her future child) from these devotees, without being accused of “falling into Maya” or “committing offense”? Is there a way she can quietly break away while still holding on to her own personal spiritual journey without being manipulated or shamed for it?

We’d really appreciate any thoughts or guidance you can offer. Thank you.

**TL;DR:**  
My cousin, a pregnant ISKCON devotee who recently lost her husband, was overwhelmed at her baby shower by devotees making disturbing comments—saying her unborn son is destined to be a *brahmachari*, that she’s lucky it’s not a girl, and that she can’t raise the child properly as a single mother. When she protested, they accused her of committing *Vaishnava aparadha*. She now wants to distance herself from such people and protect her child from being spiritually groomed—but without being accused of “falling into Maya.” We’re seeking advice on how to navigate this peacefully for the sake of the child.",3,1753830593.0,exHareKrishna,1,1.0,False
