""r/childfree, the sacred temple of eternal freedom—where the only thing more precious than your 'me-time' is your ability to dodge commitment like it’s the plague. You all act like opting out of children is some bold, revolutionary act, but let’s be real: your biggest accomplishment is knowing every single item on the menu at your local coffee shop and loudly proclaiming that you ‘can’t stand noise.’ Meanwhile, your idea of 'parenting' is yelling at a kid in the grocery store for existing. You say you're saving the planet, but the only thing you're truly saving is your own ass from ever having to give a damn about anyone other than yourself. You’re the people who see a baby and whisper, 'Good luck with that,' as you sip your third oat milk latte, because the only thing you’re committed to is never getting off your high horse.”

1hdy4s6,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1hdy4s6/started_seeing_a_girl_there_are_red_flags_or_are/,Started seeing a girl. There are red flags. Or are there?,"I [39M] met a girl [30F] through work in July. I'm a third party contractor and do my job at other businesses. This girl spoke to me for 3 mins and later in the night slid into my dms (must have asked a manager for my full name to even find me). We went on three dates and then I had to travel for two months for work. On our date before my travels she expressed strong lamentations that I'd be gone for so long, and then while I was away, she messaged me almost everyday to strike up conversation. We made many plans for when I came home. When I came home she all of a sudden had some mysterious reasons for rescheduling our plans. Four consecutive reschedules but she did always propose other days, so she wasn't trying to get out of it. She kept saying things like ""I really want to see you"", ""I'm excited to see you"", etc. I really didn't get the sense she was benching me. Her excuses seemed pretty legit too. I guess until the following circumstances all compounded: -She only ever replied to my messages between midnight and 3am. -sometimes she'd even take two days to reply. -her excuses amounted to appointments with specialists out of town and getting home very late. Her reasoning was that she had long term working relationships with these specialists so it was worth the travel. -other excuses included very vague health issues and she wouldn't be able to confirm if she felt well until 12hours before the date. -she hasn't been to the job I met her at since early Oct due to these vague health issues. -shes had trouble finding an apartment to live in and has been bopping between Airbnb's and a hotel in a very expensive city. Despite not having been to work in almost three months, she is not stressed about money. -on our last date, she really insisted on paying, she had a lot of cash in her purse. A lot. -she seems to have not many friends and when she's not hanging out with me she has no stories about what she's been up to other than seeing her mom or her sister. I usually have a lot to say, lots of friend hangs, client hangs, events, parties but she doesn't seem to do too much and seems unemployed despite being very very unavailable. -she mentioned that her parents live together but her dad is not talking to her for an undisclosed reason but her parents have a good relationship. -she said she likes me very much and doesn't want to lose me but just can't get serious with me right now because she's recovering from a break up of a long term relationship that ended in July only one week before she slid into my dms. -This isn't a red flag but she doesn't drink at all. When we go out she would ask me to a bar but then not order anything at all. I'd order a non-alc drink of some sort but I do find it weird that she wants to hang out at bars and not order anything. I asked if she wanted to go for coffee once at noon and she said it was too early in the day for her! -also not a red flag but worth mentioning. She's a former professional ballet dancer.

So, what kind of girl has wads of cash, is never available in the morning and always up way late at night but doesn't drink, cancels plans the night before, doesn't have close friends, dad isn't talking to her, lives in a hotel, hasn't been to her job in months, is a professional dancer, and can't get into a relationship, even a casual one ""right now"" but likes me enough to say she does, keep going out with me, ask me how my day is going everyday but still keeps me at arms length?

What would you say is going on here? Am I being crazy?

TLDR: started seeing a girl who says she likes me and acts like she likes me but she's very unavailable for seemingly no reason. I think she may be living a double life or some sort.",0,1734163166.0,relationships,2,0.5,False

1hdy153,https://www.reddit.com/r/galaxyzflip/comments/1hdy153/i_love_my_flip_6/,I love my flip 6,"I know people often post here out of frustration, but I just wanted to say—I absolutely love my Flip 6.

I've been an iPhone user for most of my life, with a few attempts to switch to Android over the years. Every time, I’d run into strange problems like battery drains or quirks that made me go back to iOS because it just worked for me. But the Flip 6 is the first Android phone where I’ve had no regrets about switching.

What really stands out to me is how much I enjoy the multitasking features. Splitting the screen between multiple apps is awesome, but what I use even more is the floating window feature. It makes my phone feel so much more productive—switching between apps by just tapping on open windows is incredibly convenient. I set it up so I can drag from the top right to create a floating window, and I actually use that feature more than splitting the screen.

Of course, the real star of the show is the folding screen. At first, I thought it was just a cool gimmick, and I wanted it mainly because it looked unique. But after getting the phone, I realized it has real, practical advantages over regular screens—so much so that I don’t think I could go back to a regular phone now.

The act of folding and unfolding feels so natural to me, maybe because I grew up in the flip-phone era. Closing the phone before putting it in my pocket feels much better than leaving a big slab of exposed glass in there. From the moment I started using it, the folding and unfolding felt completely intuitive—I didn’t need to adjust or get used to it at all.

But what I didn’t expect was how useful the folding feature would be when the phone is sitting on a surface. One of my favorite ways to use it is to open the phone just a little, put it upside down, and use the cover display like a mini photo frame or notification screen. It’s super convenient, especially when you want to glance at content quickly. Sure, it takes a second for the screen to switch back to the cover display sometimes, and I wish Samsung would adjust the hinge sensitivity, but even with that, it’s brilliant.

But the other way I use it—actually, mainly because it’s faster since I don’t need to tap the cover screen multiple times—is to open it at 90 degrees and just use the top half of the inner screen as my display. That works perfectly too, but the upside-down position using the cover screen definitely looks better sitting on a desk.

I used to prop up my old phones against random objects like coffee cups to keep the screen facing me, but they’d always slide down. With the Flip 6, that issue is gone entirely. For me, this is the main advantage of foldable phones—it makes the device so much more versatile in everyday use. Oddly, it’s not something I heard much about before buying the phone, and I didn’t fully appreciate it until I started using it.

The folding screen isn’t just about looking cool; it’s a real game-changer. I honestly don’t think I can go back to a regular phone now.

I’ve been using the Flip 6 for a few months, and I love it more every day. I really hope I don’t run into the issues I’ve seen others report, especially with the screen. Personally, I’d be happy if it lasts me two years—it’s worth the trade-off for such a unique and functional design. My last iPhone lasted me five years, which was great, but for me, the Flip 6 is worth a slightly shorter lifespan for the amazing experience it provides.",2,1734162701.0,galaxyzflip,0,1.0,False

1hdxweq,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_homeandsoul/comments/1hdxweq/the_essential_guide_to_choosing_furniture_for/,The Essential Guide to Choosing Furniture for Small Spaces,"Furnishing small spaces can be challenging, but with the right approach, even the most compact areas can feel stylish, functional, and inviting. Whether you're decorating a cozy apartment, a petite outdoor patio, or a snug corner in your home, the right [furniture](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture) can make all the difference. Here’s a comprehensive guide to help you choose the perfect pieces for small spaces while making the most of your layout.

# 1. Opt for Multifunctional Furniture

When space is limited, multifunctional **furniture** is your best friend. Look for pieces that serve dual purposes, such as:

* **Sofa Beds:** A stylish couch by day, a comfy bed by night.
* **Ottomans with Storage:** Perfect for hiding away clutter while providing extra seating.
* **Drop-Leaf Tables:** Ideal for small dining areas, as they can expand when needed.

Even for outdoor spaces, consider items like a compact [outdoor side table](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/outdoor/tables/outdoor-side-tables) that doubles as a storage unit for garden tools or cushions.

# 2. Choose Compact and Lightweight Designs

Bulky furniture can overwhelm small spaces. Instead, opt for compact designs with clean lines. Lightweight materials like acrylic, metal, or slim wooden frames are excellent choices for small rooms as they create a sense of openness. For outdoor settings, an **outdoor side table** with a minimalistic design can add style and practicality without taking up much space.

# 3. Prioritize Vertical Storage

Maximize your vertical space by choosing tall shelves, cabinets, or wall-mounted units. Vertical storage not only saves floor space but also creates a focal point in the room. For outdoor areas, consider stacking or hanging solutions from [outdoor furniture stores](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/outdoor) that provide creative ways to organize items without crowding your patio or balcony.

# 4. Stick to a Cohesive Color Palette

Small spaces benefit from a cohesive and light color scheme. Neutral tones like white, beige, and soft pastels can make a room appear larger and brighter. When adding accent pieces, ensure they complement the overall theme. For instance, a chic **outdoor side table** in natural wood tones can seamlessly blend with your garden's aesthetic.

# 5. Go for Foldable and Stackable Options

Foldable and stackable **furniture** pieces are lifesavers in small spaces. Here are some great ideas:

* **Foldable Chairs:** Easy to store and pull out when needed.
* **Stackable Outdoor Chairs:** Ideal for balconies or patios, available at many **outdoor furniture stores** in Dubai.
* **Murphy Beds:** A wall-mounted bed that folds away to create extra space during the day.

# 6. Focus on Proportions

When shopping for [home furniture Dubai](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture), consider the proportions of the room and the furniture. Avoid oversized pieces and instead choose items with slim profiles. For example, instead of a bulky coffee table, opt for a stylish and functional **outdoor side table** that fits well in small spaces without dominating the area.

# 7. Embrace Built-in and Custom Solutions

Custom-built furniture can be tailored to maximize every inch of your small space. Built-in shelving, benches with hidden storage, or custom corner desks can turn unused nooks into functional areas. Many **home furniture stores in Dubai** offer bespoke solutions for compact spaces, helping you make the most of your home.

# 8. Select Outdoor Furniture Wisely

For those with limited outdoor areas, selecting the right **outdoor furniture** is key. Look for compact, weather-resistant items such as folding chairs, nesting tables, or a sleek **outdoor side table**. Visit **outdoor furniture stores** in Dubai to explore versatile pieces that can transform even the smallest balcony into a relaxing oasis.

# 9. Incorporate Mirrors and Reflective Surfaces

Mirrors can create the illusion of a larger space by reflecting light and opening up the room. Incorporate mirrored cabinets or wall-mounted mirrors into your design. Similarly, glossy finishes on tables or shelves can add to the sense of spaciousness.

# 10. Think Beyond the Indoors

Don’t forget to extend your design thinking to outdoor spaces. Compact, stylish **outdoor furniture** can create a functional extension of your home. Whether it’s a small balcony or a compact garden corner, a well-placed **outdoor side table** paired with foldable chairs can make the area inviting without crowding it.

# Where to Find the Perfect Furniture in Dubai

Dubai is home to a variety of **home furniture** and **outdoor furniture stores** that cater to small spaces. From multifunctional indoor pieces to compact, weather-resistant outdoor designs, you’ll find options that blend style and practicality. Look for retailers that offer innovative and space-saving solutions to transform your home.

# Final Thoughts

Furnishing a small space doesn’t mean sacrificing style or functionality. With careful planning, clever furniture choices, and a bit of creativity, you can create a space that feels open, organized, and inviting. Explore **home furniture in Dubai** and visit **outdoor furniture stores** to find compact, versatile, and stylish solutions for every corner of your home.

The main items stolen are drinks waiting on the hand-off plane. Usually the culprits are a group of teenagers from the local middle/

They’re sleek, not clunky at all, and the sound quality has been kind of flawless. Like, we're talking standing-on-the-summit-of-a-silent-mountaintop kind of quiet.



Now lemme talk about those noise-cancelling skills—these babies smooth out the chaos and replace it with silence best described as, “Wait, the world doesn’t actually have to be this loud?” Between the ranting coffee grinders at our local cafe and the rambunctious family living next door, these headphones are godsends. And trust me, you’ve never truly missed your train stop until you’ve been trapped in your audio bliss, just chillin'.



When I compare them to my brother’s Sony WH-1000XM4, I'd say that Bose falls short on the customization front, especially the app options. I mean, I’m just a plug-and-play kinda person, and don’t get why everything needs its own companion app. But if micro-managing your tunes is your thing, you might look into the Sony just for that extra control.

Interested in the price? [Check it out here.](https://wirelessemporium.com/product-reviews/unparalleled-silence-bose-quietcomfort-45-review-b098fkxt8l/)

Battery life is decent, though. It boxes in at 22 hours—about enough for a coast-to-coast flight—and there’s this neat 15-minute quick-charge that offers an extra 3-hour jam session. Totally decent considering my forgetful nature with charging electronics. And yeah, there’s an audio cable if you're feeling nostalgic.



But let's be real—no one’s perfect, not even the QuietComfort 45. The controls are all button-based, which feel a tiny bit old-school in a world of swipes and taps. I’ve fumbled around more than I’d care to admit, trying to find the right button in a hurry. And while comfy, the plastic design didn’t fool my wallet into thinking I'd gotten metal for my cash. Also, don’t even think about working up a sweat with these on, cus’ they aren’t water-resistant. Treadmills beware.



My buddy, who’s a traveling consultant, swears by these. Claims it helps him ""find zen” during work trips, though I think he's exaggerating just to convince himself he likes his job. On the other end, my sis—an up-and-coming YouTuber—mentions they’re good, but defaulted back to her Bose 700’s due to the touch controls. Horses for courses.



The design? They scream modern minimalism, a.k.a the best way to match anything you toss on before heading out. Pairing with my devices has been straightforward, like finding your favorite series on Netflix quick. The Bluetooth range lets me wander through the apartment without hauling my phone, which the cat finds annoying when hiding and pouncing fails miserably.



These headphones are a win, if you know what you want and don’t mind a few quirks. They're robust enough for my daily hustles and mild enough for when I just want to let everything just flow over me like a lazy river.",1,1734161417.0,WirelessHeadphonesHub,0,1.0,False

\- Mother of 2 ( under 3 ) 

\- Business owner 

\- Coffee / Wine / Doughnuts 



My name is Maria, after spending nearly a decade working in hospitality I noticed a huge lack of support and training for managers. They were trained on the ""office"" side of things, but never how to manage the team, how to become a leader and how to create a positive work environment. In fact, I was told quite a few times ""You're too nice to be a manager ; the team won't listen to you"" . I believed it for a while and tried leading by this mindset, but quickly realised it wasn't the right approach. People deserve to be treated with respect, empathy and care, and that's the foundation for a successful business.

Over the time, I had the opportunity to work with several teams and led by creating strong structures, systems and a culture of empowerment. I saw first-hand how positively impacted team morale, retention and guest satisfaction, which increased revenue and reputation. I realised this approach shouldn't be an exception, it should be the norm.



That's why I stared my own business, specialising in training hospitality managers to become leaders, who inspire and care for their teams. Though customized training sessions and proven systems, I help building environments that reduce burnout, improve retention and drive exceptional guest care. By integrating AI tools, I can optimize processes, so leaders can focus on what truly matters - empowering their team.



I love hospitality, I love the pace of the industry, I love the fact that one way or another we have an impact on people's lives. Knowing that someone came in to our establishment, celebrating their special day, makes me excited. But the industry is challenging, is ever changing, is chaotic on quieted days, the fast pace drains energy and leads to burnout. That is why we need leaders, who can support the team, who can empower them and elevate them. Leaders who care more about the team than the money, as I strongly believe that if you take care of your team, they will take care of your business.



Our mission is to standardise empowering work cultures within hospitality industry and show owners the true solution to high turnover, lower morale and inconsistent service, as that all lies in leadership development. Instead of addressing employee mental health issue after the fact, we need to prevent it in the first place, by supporting leaders.

I hope this message finds you well. I come to you with a heartfelt request and a story that is deeply personal. I'm reaching out about *Ghost of Tsushima,* a game that has become more than just a distant dream, but a potential pathway to healing.

I'm sitting here at 1 AM, with a cup of my mum's favorite coffee (I still can't bring myself to change her old mug), writing this with hands that haven't stopped shaking since her funeral. My room is quiet except for the soft hum of my PC, a constant companion through these endless, painful nights.

Uk people say grief comes in waves but these days i kinda feel like its more of a Tsunami that never fully recedes. Mom was my everything, she was the one who bought me my first PS, then my PC.... the one who'd sit beside me during tough boss fights in *Sekiro*, cheering me on even though she didn't understand a thing about video games. I even taught her to play it once in one of the Souls game (easiest difficulty of course haha). We were more like sisters than a mother daughter pair lol.

Since she passed, I've been managing her estate, helping my younger sister through school, working, trying to support my dad and trying not to drown in medical bills + unexpected expenses. Gaming has been my only escape..... my therapy when therapy feels too expensive, my support system when everything else feels like it's falling apart. 

Ghost of Tsushima isn't just a game to me. It's a lifeline I'm desperately reaching for. The samurai's journey of honor, of fighting against overwhelming odds.... it feels like a mirror to my own life right now. I've conquered *Sekiro*. I've beaten every *Dark Souls* game on my PS. I love games with complicated combat mechanisms. I dont have my PS anymore haha... Playing em on PC without a controller is even more of a challenge and i love a good challenge! 

But right now, that 60usd might as well be 60,000usd . Every penny is going towards keeping us afloat. Sometimes, I watch gameplay videos, imagining myself in Jin Sakai's shoes, finding strength in a world that feels as broken as my own (my delulu is on another lvl ik xD )

I know asking for a gift isn't easy and i hate asking for it. I'm not looking for sympathy, but perhaps understanding. Gaming has been my consistent companion through grief....a way to process emotions, to find moments of joy, to remind myself that I can still overcome challenges... even when life feels absolutely impossible. I think a lot of people will relate to that lol.

Whether someone here can help me or not... I'm really just grateful to know spaces like this exist. In a world that sometimes (more times than less lol) feels cold and disconnected, where everyone's too busy to really see each other, r/GiftofGames feels different. Here, strangers become friends....a simple act of kindness can mean everything. You guys remind me that humanity isn't lost... that people still care, still want to help... still understand that sometimes a video game can be a bridge between isolation and hope.

I hope when life is in a better condition i will be able to contribute here too. 

So from the bottom of my heart....thank you. Just... thank you for existing.

I was diagnosed with chronic gastritis and have been dealing with it for a year now. My symptoms have been managed because of a strict gastritis diet and supplements. I finally kicked alcohol and caffeine to the curb and I feel like I’m somewhat healing. It’s quite depressing really. I used to go out on the weekends, drink and eat with friends, and loved my morning coffee. Now I’ve become a homebody who reads, drinks chamomile tea, and only goes to the gym. It’s hard seeing people my age living their best life going out and not having a worry. I just wonder… why me? I’m sure many can relate, but sometimes it feels so isolating having this condition. It has been especially challenging during the holidays because friends and family are drinking wine and going to Santa bar crawls while I stay home. I was by no means an alcoholic, but I liked having a drink or two every other weekend with friends or family. I’ve been sober for almost 2 weeks now and off caffeine for a month. It has really helped, but it is sad giving them up.

Claire sat on the edge of her bed, her fingers brushing the rim of a chipped coffee cup she couldn’t bring herself to throw away. It had been his. Not the first him, not the last, but the one who had made her think—for a brief, shimmering moment—that maybe this time would be different.

The cup was a pale blue, like the sky just after a storm clears. It reminded her of that morning they spent together, standing on a hill overlooking the city, discussing dreams they hadn’t dared share with anyone else. He’d said he wanted to be a writer. She’d laughed and admitted she wanted to paint. It had felt safe then, confessing her ambitions because he’d looked at her like she was magic like he couldn’t believe she existed.

But that was months ago, before the long silences and vague excuses. Before he pulled away without explanation, his once-bright words were now cold and mechanical. ""I just don’t think I’m ready for something serious,"" he’d said, his voice betraying no trace of the intimacy they once shared. And then he was gone, just like the others.

Claire wasn’t even angry anymore. Not at him. Not at the others who came before. They were all so different—charming and aloof, kind and intense—but somehow, it always ended the same way: her, alone, picking up the pieces of herself she’d dared to share.

At first, she had tried to understand. Was it something she said? Something she did? She replayed conversations in her head, dissecting moments that seemed harmless then. She scrolled through old texts, looking for clues, for a moment when everything began to unravel. But there was never a clear answer.

Then, after heartbreak number three, she began to blame herself. Maybe she was too needy. Too independent. Too much. Not enough. The doubt consumed her, pulling her into sleepless nights and endless tears.

And now? Now she didn’t know what she felt anymore. Sadness, yes. But also exhaustion. A kind of quiet resignation that settled into her bones like an old ache.

Her friends told her she was brave. ""You love so openly,"" they said, their voices filled with admiration she couldn’t understand. They encouraged her to try again, to keep her heart open, but Claire wasn’t sure she had the strength anymore. How many times could she pick herself up off the floor before she stopped believing in love altogether?

It wasn’t that she wanted to be alone. Far from it. She longed for the kind of connection that felt like home. The kind of love her parents had—quiet, enduring, steady. But she wasn’t sure it existed anymore. Not for her.

Claire looked out the window, the city lights flickering like fireflies in the distance. Somewhere out there, people were falling in love, laughing, holding hands, and making promises they intended to keep. She wondered if they knew how lucky they were.

She reached for her sketchbook, the one thing that had never left her, no matter how many times her heart had broken. Her pencil glided across the page, drawing shapes and shadows that somehow made the pain more bearable.

As she sketched, she felt a flicker of something she hadn’t felt in a long time. Hope. It wasn’t for love, not yet. But for herself. For the life she was building, piece by fragile piece.

Maybe one day, someone would come along who wouldn’t leave. Someone who would see her, truly see her and stay. But until then, Claire decided she would keep filling her life with beauty, even if it was just for her.

1hdxd4w,https://www.reddit.com/r/fasting/comments/1hdxd4w/i_fasted_for_72_hoursheres_what_i_wish_i_knew/,I Fasted for 72 Hours—Here’s What I Wish I Knew Before Starting,"The most surprising thing I learned during my 72-hour fast was how little basic human biology is discussed in relation to extended fasting. I didn’t realize feeling extremely cold could be a side effect caused by the body’s lack of resources. At one point, I was sitting in class, bundled up in layers of shirts, sweaters, and a winter coat, convinced I had caught a cold because it was winter. In reality, it was just my body’s natural response to fasting. Now, I know this is perfectly normal. Light exercise can help keep blood flowing, which makes a big difference, and I’ve also learned to better prepare for the cold during fasts.

Another thing I wish I had known—though it contrasts with the first point—is that I became overly obsessed with trying to fast “the right way.” While it’s important to take health precautions, especially for prolonged fasts like 72+ hours, I realized our bodies are built to adapt, even under extreme conditions. It’s okay to not have everything figured out or to miss a detail here and there. We often get caught up in expert advice and perfection, but there’s real value in learning from your own experience. Yes, safety and professional advice are key, but so is trusting your body’s resilience and embracing the unexpected.

When I started, my goal wasn’t specifically to hit 72 hours. I had been building up to longer fasts over time with medical advice, but I kept feeling pressure to follow every guideline perfectly to get the “best” detox results. In the end, not knowing everything turned out to be perfectly fine. I learned as I went, figuring out what worked for me, rather than solely relying on what experts said would happen. And that’s okay too.

Finally, one key tip: try to avoid loading up on stimulants like coffee or tea at the start of your fast. I learned the hard way that they can make the crash later much worse, or force you to keep consuming them just to stay energized, which can drain you even more. Stick to water and vitamins if you allow them early on, and save stimulants for later if needed. The longer you can go without them, the better—it’ll help your digestion, insulin levels, and energy stay more balanced throughout the fast.

That’s it. Stay healthy and make choices that work for you.",8,1734159741.0,fasting,2,1.0,False

The thing is, I’m at 10 hearts with Harvey now, and I regret my decision. His dialogue is just so boring compared to others that I’ve romanced. They would at least sometimes acknowledge our partnership and occasionally say cute things to me. He just keeps giving me health lectures every time I bring him a coffee. 

I was ready to go buy a bouquet and light it on fire to dump him. I’ve never broken up with someone in this game, I felt awful but it had to be done. Then I notice…I have mail. Harvey wants to meet me by the railroad tracks. I decided to go there first, a new cutscene I’ve never seen before is waiting for me.

1hdx53x,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1hdx53x/my_dad_touched_me_while_he_thought_i_was_asleep/,my dad touched me while he thought I was asleep,"hi sorry this is kind of long, I just haven't been able to talk to anyone about it and it's killing me

***tw: sexual assault (not too graphic but I do describe it???)***

I (17F) and my dad recently went on a trip together to tour colleges. Planning was stressful and we definitely overpaid for plane tickets and hotels, but we eventually made it there in one piece.

Most of the trip was fine, except for some reason, my dad booked a king size bed for both of us (""to save on cost""). I was uncomfortable with the idea, but am kind of a pushover and didn't make a big deal out of it. 

For context, my dad is kind of a weird guy. He's kind of neglected me for my whole life, so we were never very close. However, shortly after my sophomore year started, he began trying to get close to me--like, really close. 

He would massage my back even though I was visibly uncomfortable, hug me for  too long, touch my thigh, put his head on my lap, etc. Which would be okay if he hadn't been super touch-averse my entire life. Long story short, it was really fucking weird.

I didn't think much of it, though, even though he frequently told me I was the only person who he really liked and stuff. Shortly before our trip, he literally said he was in love with me (""but not in a weird way""). I told my mom about it but we both dismissed it as him being a little weird. Surely he wouldn't do anything, right?

The trip went by without a hitch until shortly before we were to fly back. Sort of.

I would put a pillow up between us at night because I just didn't like the idea of sleeping next to a man...? idk, I thought it was ok maybe i was overreacting. But he would complain about it constantly, claiming that it was a ""physical manifestation of the emotional barrier between us"". He would always try to move it ...

He also had very weird discussions with me at night. He would talk about his old love life and shit, and he eventually got to talking about extremely sexual topics with me. He asked me questions like ""do you know all the different names for sucking dick"" and ""do you know all the sexual positions"" and even tried to demonstrate. ...

***ok the descriptions get worse here so uh be warned***

Anyway on the day of, it was late morning, probably 11 ish and we were finally sleeping in after having crazy hectic schedules the whole week. I woke up and kind of just laid there, but eventually felt my dad start to touch my hair. He began to sort of caress my face? Which wasn't so bad, so I didn't think much of it. But then his hand moved lower to my neck and then my collar and by this point I think my heart was racing. I was wondering if he would go under my shirt.

I was literally frozen for the rest of this. I dont know how to explain it, but its kind of like sleep paralysis where you are aware but totally unable to move.

His hand drifted under my shirt and over my bra, shaking the entire time. Anyway eventually he started touching me under the bra and was rubbing and touching my nips a ton. it was really fucking gross ngl.

He also squeezed my thigh and touched me all over the chest and stomach and around the waist of my underwear. I dont know how far he would have gone. 

The whole time I remember feeling almost vindicated? like I was like, ""damn, I finally figured out how fucked up you are"" and I was so... confused, because this was my dad. like, we share the same dna. and he like, watched me grow up.

I somehow managed to pretend to wake up here, and he stayed pressed against me. I think he was hard. 

idk, the worst thing is that it wasn't that bad? like he didn't rape me or physically harm me?? so maybe I'm overreacting????

I wish it had been a stranger. At least then I could still depend on my dad.

***things r not so bad from here!!***

I did not know what to think. Or do. Or anything. Everything is a blur after that. I think my dad left to get coffee and I called my mom and just cried. but I didn't tell her yet.

my dad got me muffins on his coffee run. consolation muffins. One lifetime of trauma for two shitty muffins.

I don't remember thr rest of things very well but I was very broken that day. He tried to say he was sorry one time and I told him I hated him. He didn't touch me that night.

I had to act normal the next day because it was the day we flew back. That was the worst part. I cried everywhere. On the train, on the whole plane ride back while my dad was chatting up some random woman.

Eventually I think a day after we got back I spilled the whole thing to my mom when we were alone. She took me to my aunt's and left me there for several weeks, but I was extremely depressed and lonely because my aunt was busy and I was pretty isolated there.

My mom has been a stay-at-home mom for 20 or so years, so she's pretty much entirely financially dependent on my dad. We live in an area where housing is extremely expensive. 

I eventually moved back into the house but have avoided my dad for 4.5 months now. 

My mom does not want to get a divorce from my dad. She has a bleeding heart when it comes to people she thinks depend on her. she loves me a lot and I love her too but she can be... idk

My dad is often sick or has headaches so she pities him and thinks she has to take care of him. She thinks she is the only one who can. She talks a lot about how she can ""heal him"" and ""protect"" me. My dad said that he was hallucinating from lack of sleep when it happened, so therefore he deserves a second chance. right?? ... I just don't want my mom to be stuck taking care of him forever, especially because he's kind of a jerk to her. she deserves better.

So far, my mom, dad, brother, and several close family members know.

I am depressed. I cry all the time for no reason. I feel so fucked up and I don't want to do anything or exist. My mom and I discussed therapy and she agreed to look into it, but she doesn't really believe in therapy in general and isn't really very great with mental health or anything (she gets upset when I'm sad, and even turns up the radio to block out the sounds of my crying lmao). So I think it's not going to happen. lol

My dad is going to pay for my college. My mom said she will make sure that happens. So I can't wait to graduate and gtfo of this shithole. College apps r killing me though

I feel disgusted when I look in the mirror. I am so confused and depressed. I miss my dad. I dont know what to do.

I can't report my dad because it will fuck things up for everyone. Ruin his life and make my family's very hard. So I am trapped here.

I have become one of the statistics--one of the 70% of people that never report. I know it's selfish and vindictive and emotional, but sometimes I wish I could report him.

I can't talk about this with anyone. Not my friends, peers, and my family is all involved so that doesn't help.

Sorry this is so long. I just wanted to vent. Thank you. <3

What machine should I upgrade to?,"I've been addicted to espresso and cappuccino ever since I discovered home espresso machines. I've been using a 4-bar INALSA and a 5-bar Morphy Richards espresso machine for the past 1.5 years. Now both have gone bad. I'm not attempting to repair them again. Both are out of warranty now too. When in warranty, Morphy Richards replaced their machine once. INALSA repaired their machine twice. The second time it took them 3 months to repair. And the machine ended up with the on/off indicator light not working after the second service. So I'm back to hunting for a good upgrade to these machines. The equipment that I currently have apart from these machines are:

1. Puck screen from Supvox 51mm.
2. Supvox 6 needles coffee grounds stirrer (WDT)
3. A coffee bean grinder from Agaro.

I'm undecided as to whether to go with the electric brewers or go with a manual brewer paired with an electric milk frothing machine. Here are the options that I'm considering:

1. DeLonghi Dedica EC685. This is available for INR 17.5K now on Amazon.
2. WACACO Picopresso (INR 10K on Amazon) paired with Xtech Electric Milk Frother (INR 3K on Amazon )

My requirements are:

1. The new setup should be compatible with the equipment that I already have.
2. It should be an upgrade in the quality of espresso that I'm currently brewing.
3. Service and parts should be easily available in India and the cost should be reasonable.
Do help me in making a good choice. If y'all have any other equipment suggestions, do let me know.

“Praise be for Rahlo,” I said with a laugh as I set Tolva down on the carpeted area and set to taking off my boots.

Tolva nodded absently, “I don’t know... I’m not sure I trust him,”

I frowned, “huh? Why?”

“I don’t know... it’s just... I-I guess I don’t like how he left Bahvri all alone for so long,”

I tilted my head curiously

“He was gone for like... the last 5 years,” Tolva muttered

“Oh... how old is Bahvri?”

“18.”

I frowned and thought for a moment, “wait... Tolva, how old are you?”

He tilted his head and his ears gave a questioning flick, “I’m 22... why?”

I blinked a few times, “oh... I... I guess I thought that we were both 25,”

“Well... I mean, it’s close enough. r-right?”

“Right, it’s not like it’s an issue. I-I mean... I guess that if I found out you were like 15 I might feel a little uncomfortable, but- eh, n-nevermind” I sighed and shook my head, feeling rather awkward all of a sudden

Tolva giggled, “Well, I'm just glad you’re not an old lady!”

I laughed, “that would be a little funny. Though I guess considering I share my Grampy’s taste in movies you could be forgiven for thinking that.”

He giggled again as I put my jacket and boots in the closet.

As I stepped up into the carpeted area of the hab I walked over and sat down on the couch, Tolva sat down next to me with a can of Sprunk he had picked up from a vending machine along the way back and almost immediately snuggled up against my side. I couldn’t help but chuckle as I gently lowered my arm down around him, “is one of the symptoms of that so-called ‘predatory taint’ turning into a snuggle bug?” I teased

His ears shot straight up and he turned his head slightly towards me, “oh no! You’re right, I might be infected!” he said with a mock tone of shock before laughing

“Well I certainly don’t mind,” I remarked playfully as I set my pad on my lap.

I hesitated a moment, something Tolva sensed and he looked up at me questioningly, “Is something wrong, Elanor?”

I took a deep breath, the fear of rejection - as irrational as it might be - suddenly was once again rearing its ugly head and I needed a moment to build up the courage to tell Tolva the truth, “Uh... I... I need to tell you something, Tolva,”

Tolva’s expression turned concerned and he nodded slightly “Ok,”

“I... I know an Arxur,”

Tolva froze for only half a moment before nodding slowly, “Ok, I mean... I-I guess it’s the thought of one is... uh... absolutely terrifying, but y-you’re not going to say that they’re coming here, right?”

I took another deep breath and breathed a sigh of relief, his measured reaction was helping immensely, “no, nothing like that... But... The call I need to make is about, and maybe to, him,”

Tolva gulped nervously but nodded, staying calm as he could, “I-I see... uh- wh-what’s it about?”

“I’m not sure,” I admitted with a low whistle, “I... uh... well... our relationship is a little... funny, I guess?”

“Funn- Elanor,” Tolva’s face suddenly went dead serious and he turned to look up at me head-on, something which honestly made him look a little silly, “Are you dating an Arxur?”

I snorted and had to cover my mouth and look away as my whole body flinched with the force of the barely suppressed laugh. I snickered. I giggled. And then I laughed uncontrollably. Poor Tolva turned bright orange and hid behind his paws, but I just couldn’t help it. The seriousness with which he asked that the way he looked up at me, it just sent me into hysterics.

“No! No, nothing like that!” I laughed as I wiped a tear from my eye, “God, oof. Ookay... alright. Oof. No. It’s... uh... I uh... technically kidnapped him?”

“YOU WHAT!?” Tolva jumped back with shock, “You kidnapped an- wha- how! Why?”

“I said *‘Technically’*,” I pointed out defensively, “I... uh... I found him in the woods. I had no idea at the time, but apparently he had fled some kind of foster program. I took him in and looked after him for like a year and half before someone finally figured out where he was,”

“HOW DID NO ONE NOTICE AN ARXUR FOR A BRAHKING YEAR AND HALF!?!” Tolva demanded with shock

I blushed and looked down at my feet, “I... I may have been living like a weirdo hermit deep in the woods at the time after a... bad social encounter,”

“Wha? What the hell happened to make you do that?”

“I...” I blushed, feeling embarrassed but I also couldn’t hide the sadness that I felt well up inside, “My best friend, or at least I thought she was my best friend, freaked out when we finally met in person. Like *really* freaked out. At the time she was like the one person I actually talked to regularly outside my family and... well.”

“Well speh to her then!” Tolva announced with indignation, “You’re wonderful! Anyone who can’t see that is a speh brain!”

Tolva’s words made my face burn hot and my stomach feel all warm and floaty as a bashful smile appeared on my face unbidden, “Thanks,”

He huffed and crossed his arms, “I guess not all humans have good sense,” he looked up at me and smiled a little, “I’m glad mine does though,”

I blushed even more and hid behind my hands, “Tolva!” I whined

He giggled, “Ha! There’s one back for all the times you made me bloom!” he exclaimed triumphantly

I reached over and gently scritched at his sides, just a little above his hip, and got a yiping bleat of surprise as he half-jumped away but I just followed him, tickling his side and his tummy, getting a nice earful of his wonderful whistling laugh.

I relented after just a few seconds and gently patted his head, “Thanks, buddy. You...” my smile melted away and I felt my eyes grow warm as I started to tear up. I just couldn’t stop myself, I wrapped my arms around Tolva who gave another startled \*beep!\* as I hugged him tightly, “you’re just the best, Tolva”

“E-Elanor?”

“The very best,” I repeated as I just held him for a few seconds before I finally got control of myself and pulled back.

I wiped my tears away and blushed furiously as I sniffled, “Gosh, I-I’m sorry, I just. Uh- I got a little emotional,”

“Elanor,” Tolva sounded a little worried as he placed his little paws on my hand, “are you ok?”

“I-I’m fine it’s just... uh... sorry. I’ve... I haven’t had a friend like you in... in years.”

“R-really?” He was clearly both heartbroken and alarmed to learn this

“Yeah... Torry was my last really real friend I had... I... He died when New York was bombed,”

Tolva made a small whining sound and threw his arms around me in a hug. A hug I gladly returned.

I just held him for a few minutes of quiet. He was just so warm and soft and wonderful that I... I didn’t want to let go. But then my pad began the familiar ring of a call from Grampy.

“I uh... I gotta get that,” I mumbled

Tolva giggled, the small vibrations it made felt just wonderful, “you have to let go of me to do that, silly,”

“I... I guess I do huh?” I chuckled before finally releasing him

He smiled up at me, his tail adorably wagging with joy. I smiled back and wiped my eyes again before clearing my throat and picking up my tab. I turned it so that the back was towards Tolva just in case the screen would show Vosk when I pressed answer.

This turned out to be a good precaution because although Grampy was front and Center, Vosk was sitting in the background idly stroking Iglesias - Grampy’s wolf-dog.

I immediately recognized Grampy’s study. From the view I could tell that Grampy was facing out the large window that was behind his desk. Between the desk and door way in was couch and a pair of chairs arranged around a coffee table and the right side of the room from this angle had floor to ceiling bookshelves lining the walls while the left had a large stone fireplace with a pair of rifles hung over it and a variety of trophies - both from business and hunting - on display next to it.

“Elanor, did you- hrm, is something wrong Sweet Pea?” Grampy’s sternness vanished instantly as his eagle eyes somehow picked out I had briefly cried what was several minutes ago at this point

“No, nothing at all, Grampy,” I replied with a smile, “I... I need to call Helen and thank her for pushing me to do all this though,”

A warm and very relieved smile crossed the oldman’s lips for a few moments. He knew as much as anyone how badly I had taken Torry’s death and then Kim’s rejection.

But that smile faded and, while not as harsh, his expression turned stern again, “Elanor we need to talk about that gator boy.”

“Vosk?”

He nodded, “For starters, why didn’t you tell me about him?”

“I... I was worried that if you got involved it might complicate some of the UN contracts and-”

“POPPYCOCK!” He barked angrily, Vosk looking up rather surprised in the background, “The business exists for the family, *NOT* the other way around! I don’t know where your Grampy went so wrong as to make you think it was anything else, but I would burn a hundred contracts if that’s what it took to help you!”

I nodded sheepishly, feeling a little ashamed but... also so very happy to hear the sentiment affirmed once more, “you’re right. I’m sorry, Grampy”

“Hmpf” The old man huffed and shook his head, “In any case, I’m very disappointed in you, Elanor,”

“Y-you are?”

“Damn right! How could you let those soft-handed imbeciles take your brother from you!?”

I stammered, “B-Brother!?” Vosk looked just as shocked to hear this as I did, his jaw opening and audibly snapping shut in the background

“You took him into the woods, *our* woods, did you not?”

I nodded

“You guided him in fashioning a bow of his own make, did you not?”

I nodded again

“You took him to hunt and elk. Taught him to track his prey, understand the signs that it left behind, understand what the woods were telling him, and ultimately how to take his prey, did you not?”

I glanced at Tolva with a hint of concern for his reaction, but he was just listening with keen interest and no sign of obvious discomfort. Looking back at the pad I nodded once more.

“You had him eat its still warm heart and then instructed him in dressing the kill, yes?”

I nodded, not even wanting to see Tolva’s reaction to those final details of my family’s little coming of age tradition.

“Then near as I can figure that damn well makes him family!” Pappy all but shouted as he banged his fist against the armrest of his chair, “I can’t believe you just let them bully you into giving him up after that!”

“I- bully me!? I-I was just trying to do what’s best for- I-I had no,” I stammered a few seconds before stopping myself, taking a deep breath, gathering my thoughts, letting that breath out, and then starting again, “Grampy, to start with I had no idea Vosk was was only five or even what that would mean in terms of an Arxur’s age. I thought he was... I don’t know whatever mid to late teens are for Arxur. Secondly, I had absolutely no clue that he had *ran away* from someone who was supposed to be looking after him.

“This one did not run away!” Vosk hissed plaintively from the background after snapping his jaws loudly, “This one escaped with wit and ferocity!”

I smiled and covered my mouth to avoid giggling. I had to clear my throat to completely stifle the urge before continuing, “Third, regardless of their threats to charge me with kidnapping or xenotrafficking or whatever nonsense they said, I NEVER would have just ‘handed him over’ because of something like that. I thought that someone who had both the resources and knowledge to look after him was a better fit than me who was hiding in the woods because I was... because I was just too anxious to be around people. And he agreed to go with them.”

Grampy considered this for a long moment before letting out a heavy sigh and deflating a little, “Alright... I’m sorry for getting angry with you, Sweet Pea. I... I should have gotten your side of things before I assumed that- ah, it doesn’t matter what I assumed. I’m sorry, Sweet Pea.”

“It’s ok Grampy,” I reassured him, “I know it’s only because you love me and want me to grow up right,”

The old man smiled, “That’s right, Sweet Pea,” His eyes shifted slightly and he frowned a moment before smiling again, “I see you’re still fond of your dolls,”

“Dolls?” my eyes flicked to the camera preview in the lower right corner of the video call and I realized that at some point I had shifted and Tolva was now in the shot. I went beet red and Hastily turned the pad back and avoided looking at him as I noticed him going very orange in the preview window, “G-Grampy that was Tolva, not a doll!”

“What!?” Grampy was visibly taken aback by that before his expression became somewhat indignant, “You mean to tell me that he’s been sittin there this whole time and you ain’t introduced him! Young lady!”

I blushed, “W-well,”

I looked over and saw Tolva was wagging his tail slightly with big eyes and an excited expression. That made me chuckle and I turned the pad so that he was more clearly in frame.

Tolva scootched a little closer and leaned over a bit, “Hello, Sir!” Tolva greeted my Grampy cheerily with what I recognized was a very formal and respectful ear-wiggle, “My name is Tolva, It’s nice to meet you,”

Grampy made a thoughtful ‘hmm’ sound with a slow and very approving nod, “It’s good to finally meet you as well, boy. My name is Wyatt Florence, you may call me Mr. Florence.”

Tolva gave a little nod, “Elanor’s always very excited when you call, Mr. Florence,”

Grampy’s lip twitched towards a smile for a split second, “She been treating you right?”

Tolva nodded enthusiastically, “That she has, Mr. Florence! I... I only hope that I’m even half as good a friend as she is,”

I blushed terribly at this exchange, making Grampy laugh heartily, “Well I’m glad to hear that, Boy.”

Grampy shifted his attention back to me and gave a satisfied nod, “Well, back on point. The Arxur foster program or whatever you want to call it was seeking a potential host family for Vosk and after failing to reach you, they reluctantly reached out to me,”

I blinked in surprise, “Host family?”

“Yes. Apparently this time with you was found to be\~” He shuffled some papers out of view before continuing, “‘of a profoundly therapeutic nature and overall resulted in a marked and profound improvement to his temperament and behavior’,” he quoted

“R-Really?”

“Elanor taught this one much,” Vosk remarked in the background as he continued to gently stroke Iglesias, “This one still wishes to be strong, to be a good hunter but now this one understands that the betterment were *not* hunters. They were butchers, monsters, *defectives*. A hunter must listen to and master their instincts and senses, this means a hunter must embrace mercy and temperance as well as violence and cunning. A strong hunter must also strive for kills to be clean, efficient. Cruelty is a hindrance to a hunter.”

I don’t even know how to describe what I felt. Proud? Happy? I... I had no idea Vosk had taken what I had shown and told him so to heart like that. I... If that’s what being a big sister feels like, I couldn’t help but feel a little jealous of mine.

Grampy gave an approving nod to the young Arxur before turning back to the screen, “Naturally I agreed to take the boy in. Like hell I’d leave him to whoever else those soft-hands might have had their damned lists.” He gave a huff and a shake of his head before continuing, “In any case, I’ve ordered the boy a pad of his own -special made to stand up to them claws of his- and just as soon as that arrives I’ll be sending you his contact information. I want you to call him *at least* once a day to check up on him, ya hear? Boy was mighty disappointed you weren’t planet-side.”

Vosk snapped his jaws again in the background and I smiled a little as I saw his pale white hide tinge a bit red.

“I will, Grampy, don’t you worry.”

“Good. I guess I’ll let you get back to what you was doing for now, but I want you to call before you go to bed tonight, ya hear?”

“I hear you Grampy, Love you.”

“Love you too, Sweet Pea. Bye-bye now.”

The call clicked off and I was a little surprised by the very large, and exhausted sounding sigh Tolva made from next to me.

Looking over to him with concern I saw that he had a paw over his chest and was taking a few deep breaths to calm himself before turning his attention up to me with those big amber eyes of his, “D-did I do good?”

*ohmyfuckinggaaaahsofreakingcute!*

I set my pad down on the floor and gave Tolva another hug, “You did wonderful,” I cooed

“Your grandfather is... a very intimidating human,” Tolva remarked, still sounding a little shaken as he leaned into me, “I think more than the Arxur,”

“R-really?” I furrowed my brow doubtfully. Honestly I had heard other people say that Grampy was intimidating, terrifying even. But I had never once seen him like that. Even when I was in trouble he was never scary, more... heartachingly disappointed in me.

Tolva shifted a little, looking up at me with an inquisitive tilt to his ears, “can I ask you something, Elanor?”

Crap. This was the point I'd have to explain the whole elk heart thing, wasn't it?

“Are all humans so... Touchy or is it just a you thing?” He asked before hastily adding, “n-not that I mind! I'm just... Curious is all,”

*Oh... That's not quite what I was expecting him to ask.*

“Uh... Well... I guess I am an especially touchy person. I love hugs and back, head, and shoulder patting. An-and you're just so soft too\~” I cleared my throat a little, “if you're wondering if I would still hug you and pick you up if you were human, the answer is yes. Uh, I... Uh... Sometimes I would carry Torry home from the bar if he drank too much and there were a lot of nights where we'd just sit shoulder to shoulder and watch the stars... a-and sometimes I’d just hug him close for the sake of being close,”

Tolva made a small sad sound, “he sounds like he was a wonderful person,”

“He really was... I miss him a lot,” I sighed and shook my head, “Anyway, yeah it’s mostly just a me thing. Though... there are some proven medical benefits for cuddling,”

“W-wait, seriously!?”

I laughed, “Yeah. It's found to release hormones that can combat depression, anxiety, and improve heart health and respiratory function. At least, according to what I remember from health class in highschool,”

Tolva’s ears shifted, the right one up and left one down as he tilted his head ever so slightly to match, “So... hugging me is... good for you?”

I paused for a moment as I pondered that, “I guess so, yeah,” I concluded with a shrug

Tolva’s tail waved a little and his ears did a funny little back and forth wiggle like springs that had been bent to the side and released, “hehe, then I guess I better make sure you get your daily recommended hugs in\~”

I laughed and gently stroked the back of his head, “Well I don’t think there’s any risk of me falling behind in that department,”

“Better be safe though,” Tolva giggled, “I am a *cultural ambassador* after all.”

I snickered and continued to gently stroke the back of his head, running my fingers over his short but incredibly soft wool.

After a few more minutes Tolva finally broached the subject I had been waiting for, “Umm... about... about what your grandfather had said... about you and the Arxur,”

I sighed and nodded, “yes?”

“Humans don’t eat raw flesh so... What... what he said about... about th-the heart... that was... metaphorical, r-right?”

“Well... no,” I admitted quietly, “it’s a... well, it’s not an entirely uncommon tradition among hunters where I’m from. It’s - at least for my family - a reminder that the animal we killed was just that. An animal. A living creature. It wasn’t just a meal that was prancing about the woods. It’s a reminder that we take not just the life from the animal, but the animal from the woods. We are a part of that cycle of life and death, not some kind of outsiders who float above it and can interfere as we see fit with no consideration, and we must never forget that.”

I sighed heavily, “There have been several extinctions in humanity’s past that were the direct result of hunting. People losing sight of the fact that the things they hunted were more than just valuable pelts or a resource to be exploited for all its worth.”

“I... see... I-I won’t lie... the whole... the whole thing makes me feel a little queasy, but... I... I *think* I understand,” Tolva said after a few moments thought, “A-actually it was what the Arxur said that... that put me at ease after what your grandfather said”

I looked down in surprise, “Really?”

He gave an affirmative flick of his ears.

*Oh hey! I can tell what that one is now!*

“He said that your hunting wasn’t like what the Arxur did. That it wasn’t about cruelty or destruction so... so it must not be what I’ve always been taught a predator’s hunting is like,” Tolva explained, “But... I-I think I’ll skip learning any details, if it’s all the same,”

“Of course... though... hmmm,” I thought for a moment then chuckled to myself making Tolva give me a slightly worried look, “perhaps one day I could take you *photo* hunting?”

“Wh-what?”

“It’s like hunting, but instead of killing the quarry, you photograph it.”

“That... that’s a thing?”

I chuckled, “Well, most people would call it wildlife photography, but photo hunting is what Torry called it. He was a vegetarian, you see. He didn’t eat meat and didn’t hunt either.. But he wanted to know what hunting was like, just without the killing part. So it was an idea we came up with,”

Tolva thought about that for a minute, “I... I guess that might actually be fun... but... c-can we just call it the other thing? Wildlife photography?”

I laughed, “of course,”

Tolva nodded with a little smile before something seemed to occur to him and he cleared his throat and pushed out of my embrace to sit up straight, “That actually reminds me, I was wondering if maybe you wanted to visit the Ecology center?”

I cocked my head “Ecology center?”

“Yeah, it’s uh... hmm... it has lots of information about the plants and animals from around the colony. There’s even an exhibit on the predators though...” Tolva turned a little orange and cleared his throat, “I-I was never brave enough to go in there,”

I was quite surprised to hear that. To my understanding the Federation’s understanding of ecology was... a bit limited. Actually the federation’s understanding of a lot of things seemed oddly limited for a civilization that had spaceships, laser guns, and miracle medicine. I was genuinely quite curious what exactly an exhibit on predators would look like from them. Would it just be pictures of every local predator with their eyes blurred out and plaques that say something like ‘evil pup mangler’ and ‘cruel eye gouger’ or something?

“That actually sounds quite interesting, I think I’d really-”

My reply to him was cut off by what sounded like a tornado siren coming from outside. I had no idea what was going on, but Tolva locked up immediately, looking absolutely terrified with his eyes wide as could be, “Th-the predator siren! S-something got through th-the fence!” he stammered as he clutched my clothes and held himself close to me, trembling like a leaf.

I reached over and picked Tolva up, setting him on my knee and hugging him gently, “I’m sure it’ll be fine, Tolva,”

I had said it in a light and almost amused tone, but when I looked down into his eyes I saw real and genuine terror and I felt a small spike of guilt shoot through me. This wasn’t some prey-ish over reaction to brush off, my friend was genuinely very scared.

I took a deep breath and nodded to myself before picking him up and carrying him to my bedroom. I set him down on the bed and opened up the closet to fetch the box I had placed on the top shelf.

Within this box was my gun, holster, bandolier belt, and knife alongside four boxes of 12.8x76mm ammunition. I popped open the cylinder of the revolver and loaded all six shots.

The gun and the round it fired -.504 Amazonian- were both developed at the insistence of Grampy after I had a rather unfortunate encounter with a bear when I was sixteen. He had initially intended it to be produced as a completely custom, one-off weapon but the marketing department for Grizzly Arms - yet another company owned by my family - had *insisted* it be marketed as a large game cartridge and now .504 Amazonian was a surprisingly popular cartridge - albeit for rifles. Apparently the UN had even commissioned a large batch of the ammunition though I have no idea what for (space bears?).

“Ok, so if on the off chance anything comes our way, I’ll be ready,” I reassured Tolva who was looking at me with wonder as I affixed the belt and slipped six more rounds into the ammunition loops on my left hip before holstering the weapon on my right.

I knelt down with as reassuring a smile as I could give, “These habs are made to be impervious to not just local wild-life but extreme weather as well. Whatever's out there isn’t getting in.”

Tolva nodded slowly but the movement that caught my eye was behind him. I shifted my gaze and saw... something, an indistinct blur, a shimmer in the air move past the window. I was about to dismiss it when I saw it again but this time I picked out a shape, a distinctly animalistic shape.

“Tolva... This might sound insane, but are any of the predators native to this planet... invisible?”

The Venlil’s eyes went wide with terror and he spun to look out the window, stumbling off of the bed and backing up to me with his whole body trembling, “Ph-ph-phantoms!?” he stammered as he hid behind me, “no, no, no!”

I gently picked up Tolva and held him close to me, before tapping a button on the wall that made the windows turn opaque, “What’s a phantom?”

“N-No one knows!” Tolva exclaimed in near-panic, “Th-they don’t burn and even lasers don’t do anything to them. They don’t show up on cameras an-and no one’s ever gotten a good look at one. They just... Just appear and-and-and they can’t be stopped!”

I frowned as I tried to puzzle out what the hell kind of creature could possibly have that collection of traits but I didn’t get to ponder it long before I heard a blood curdling scream from outside followed by another almost immediately after.

“Tolva, I need you to stay here, ok?”

“Wh-what!? N-No! Don’t leave me!” He pleaded as he clung to me as tightly as he could

“Tolva, someone is in trouble. They need help,” I said as softly as I could as I knelt down and set him on the ground, “you’ll be safe here, I promise.”

He was trembling uncontrollably and looked like he was on the verge of a full blown panic attack, but I needed to go. I gently pressed my forehead to his for a moment before gently pulling his clenched little paws off of my shirt and standing.

I patted his head as he stepped aside, hugging himself and shaking like a leaf but seemingly understanding that someone needed help.

“I’ll be right back, don’t worry,” I reassured him before rushing to the door.",12,1734158224.0,NatureofPredators,2,1.0,False
1hdwzwz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1hdwzwz/im_scared_im_going_to_get_stalked_again_and_it/,I’m scared I’m going to get stalked again and it makes me angry,"I’m a graduate student. When I was in undergrad, I got stalked by another student I worked in a lab with, and it’s completely changed the way I view the world and the way I interact with men. I’ve worked a lot out in therapy, but unfortunately I can’t un-experience being stalked. I was scared of men for a long time, but I’ve finally gotten to the point where I can have male friends and go on dates without any distress. It’s been a long time since I’ve been genuinely afraid the way I used to be, but I feel like all my progress is coming undone because of one creepy guy.

A few months ago, I agreed to go on a date with a guy who works on campus. I gave him my number so we could work out when/where, but he didn’t text me that night or the next day, so I figured he’d lost interest. Two days later, he randomly called me and it was weird. He didn’t seem to expect me to pick up and we had a stilted conversation where he mostly breathed into his microphone. When he did talk it was in this tone of voice that freaked me out in a way I can’t really explain. It sounds ridiculous, but he sounded like a killer in a slasher movie. 

I told myself maybe he was just nervous, but when we finally texted about when we were going to get coffee, he tried to plan it for a weird location after dark. We would’ve been the only two people at this place besides the workers, and it’s not exactly a high traffic area.
I didn’t think he was an actual serial killer of course, but is that not weird?

I decided to trust my gut and politely cancel the date. Even if his intentions were good, I’d lost all interest at this point. Since then, he’s called me randomly once with no apparent plan, with the same kinda breathy/ concerningly excited tone of voice. I told him I wasn’t and would never be interested. I thought that would be the end of it, but today he texted me again! Asking if he could “come over 😉”. I told him not to contact me again, and he replied with “How r u?”. I wish I was making this up.

I know he’s probably just drunk or socially inept and harmless, but the guy who stalked me seemed pretty harmless too. I think he played that to his advantage, as a lot of people like him have learned to. His behavior was inappropriate, but he knew that people would excuse it as him being well-intentioned and awkward—until it escalated. Even the most socially awkward people know that following someone around is not normal. Right now this guy’s behavior could be generously interpreted as misguided. He was interested, and still wants to see if he has a chance. I get it, but I’ve said no twice times now. I just wish that people who do this kind of shit could understand how scary it is for the person on the receiving end. Now I’m sitting here wondering if the next time I walk to class this guy is going to approach me. I’ll be right back where I started, looking over my shoulder to see if I’m being followed. 

I don’t want to view men as potential threats. I’ve known plenty of kind and respectful guys, but it only takes one to make me feel unsafe. I worked so hard to get over this, but one guy’s bizarre attempts to get a date have put me right back where I started. How many times do I have to say no to be left the fuck alone?

I will not be responding to any calls or texts from this guy, and if he does decide to approach me I’ll just be filing a complaint with the university. The way I should’ve with my stalker. I’m just so frustrated. I’m tired of giving the benefit of the doubt to people who don’t think at all about their actions. I’m no longer in the business of making sure someone who’s acting like a creep means to be creepy. I’m putting my own safety and sanity first. My world will be smaller for it. But I can’t do this shit anymore.",1,1734158214.0,Vent,0,1.0,False
1hdwy1o,https://www.reddit.com/r/beyondthebump/comments/1hdwy1o/where_do_i_even_go_from_here_6_months_postpartum/,Where do I even go from here? 6 months postpartum and I feel worse than ever,"This is a late night 4am ramble, english is not my first language. I couldnt be bothered to do grammar correction. I just need this off my chest:

I dont know if I just need to stop breastfeeding to feel less overwhelmed and miserable all the time or if this is full blown postpartum depression/anxiety. 

There is hardly a day when I dont think about leaving this situation, wanting to go back in time, regretting everything

My partner is nothing but supportive but I need to remind myself everyday to not cry at him all day long or resent him for getting time away from us while fucking working. Up to last week he also slept more or less through the night which made me resent him even more. 

Since last week baby is sick with a cold which made for the worst week of my life. There is no sleep, I am more at home than before and I just want to give the baby up for adoption because clearly someone out there would appreciate him more than me. I feel so guilty all the time even before this week because I just want to do everything else than taking care of him. And in the same time just want to do nothing for a day and just sleep. Just like about a month or so ago I kind of feel connected to my baby at all. I smile at him, he smiles back at me and I really feel a small glowing, but this is all of the positive interaction there is. Its also like maybe once a day when there is the fucking 30 min episode of him being content for once, without nonstop entertaining.

Even prior to last week he started sleeping even worse, I went for counselling and for the first time had the idea of getting things in order. I went from breastfeeding all day and night to a schedule because the baby was just snacking all day and drinking all calories at night. I was confident with staying with him at night holding him while he would cry when he couldnt nurse all the time. Now sick I try to keep with that schedule but he is just crying all day and night, I dont know to tell the difference if hes really hungry and needs more because of illness or just comfort again. So schedule is a little wonky right now making me wonky again. He is sleeping a little more easily at day but the nights are even worse. When he is quiet I fucking hear the baby crying in my head. Its like ne noise is etched into my skull. 

When not sick he tends to easily be bored or start the complaining when hes hungry or tired therefore I feel like I have a generally rather grumpy high need baby and the whining background noise all day long. Everyone else is just in love with him because he is so active and so attentive to the outside world. Smiling back at everyone. He is objectively a precious little baby.

But since day 2 of his life this baby is not able to sleep on his own and postpartum I was not able to handle this. In hindsight its clear I was so overwhelmed, anxious and fucking tired I just surrendered to panic and did what worked but feared all change and experimenting like the plague because it would take even more effort out of me. 
He would nurse then sleep, when I wanted to put him down he was awake after ten minutes and I only knew to nurse him again to get him to be calm and go back to sleep because I couldnt deal with him being awake. I just needed to sleep. I had a flashing backpain from birth which made rocking him so painful and I felt so fucking handicapped with everything. These first weeks were the worst. 

When we bought the baby carrier my partner could take the baby for longer walks outside since it was summer and in the morning I could sleep uninterrupted, the whole night i would cosleep on the floor mattress with the baby, just because it would make him sleep at least the 2-3 hours before feeding again. We got rid of the most comfy bed I ever had. Newborn stage is just brutal.

The hormone crash was excruciating and i was only crying all the time. I seriously thought of suffocating the baby to make him shut up. I was so afraid of him getting sick and making me suffer more. Of him changing any nap behaviour because I saw the whole night just being awake with a baby now deciding night is day. I panicked because of every little change. When he would cry I had the feeling the world was about to end. This got a little better around 9ish weeks when I learned that not every little tear would affect my baby into next week. 

I always thought this sleep struggle and bedsharing would end on its own when he gets bigger but 6 months into this and he only has another schedule making me go to bed even earlier, dreading the nighttime since I am stuck with him for 12 hours without any kind of resting space for me. I used to love my own routine, bedtime and my bed. I dont want to go into the bedroom anymore. When bedsharing i just cannot find sleep, because i always fear he might wake up next moment just crushing me even more since i just found sleep and lost it again. Because then i have to comfort him back to sleep, because the schedule says no food. I seriously want to make him eat more at daytime and I need to do that to lessen these night wakings. The only effort I can be bothered to make. If i have to keep up these night feedings I one day might not be able to regulate the aggression now coming with him waking up again and again and again always clutching my hair, searching the breast, going crazy in my bed while screaming like I am skinning him alive. If I was to harm this baby I will end myself before going to jail.

There was a little blessed time of like 3 weeks, when he would sleep from 8pm to 2am and since it was regular my brain could calm down and i would sleep. He would wake up once to feed then go back to sleep til 6am. That was normal getup time back then. I would look forward to cuddle baby bedsharing. I was not that groggy and could deal with the longer wake window in the morning. Then sleep regression hit. Now he sleeps from 8pm to 8am but kind of wakes up every 1-2 hours. Then sleeps 3-4 hours again. Sometimes its only a small waking, little crying, then back to sleep. Its completely irregular and this little noises and my brain is keeping me up. In the morning my partner cannot take over since he has to work already and I need to wait for the first nap, hoping to sleep 45 min with him. I cannot cosleep later in the day because I need to go to bed with him somewhat tired. At 8pm I am often not tired enough to go to sleep. I could better go at like 5pm or very late around midnight. I was always a late sleeper but kind of early riser. I am just not compatible with my own baby. 

But its not just the sleep, the always being touched by him because at day time he is the same velcro baby. The breastfeeding amplifying this. I actually love the easiness of breastfeeding (it just worked well from week one or so) but its just constantly making this baby come back to me. I cannot leave him with dad or grandma. I hated pumping and it would mess with my supply (i already had rather too much- see! This is something a lot of women would love to have and I can only hate on it) so i just took the coin to be glued to the baby 24/7. 

I am at home for 12 months with the baby and the year prior to having him we moved back to family which made us consider having a baby in the first place. Looking back now we just killed our perfect little life. I was working, i was sleeping, i could read or clean or listen to podcast for hours. I was flexible and could visit friends. I just got baby fever and then we had this stupid idea that our life was perfectly fit for a child since we had such a great relationsship, regular lifes, childfriendly interests and hobbies and family loving a grandchild. 

But there is nothing left. I never thought of not even having a bedtime and some time with my partner. Of course i knew i could not be flexible or indulge hobbies to no end in the say first year. But there is no time of doing anything uninterrupted. I am just constantly revolving around the baby, carrying him to sleep, making him eat enough, then forcing myself to actually engage with him while taking care of eating myself and some cleaning laundry whatever or squeezing in a shower. Then its time for sleeping or eating again. And then the night comes. When i am not getting out of the house i am just coexisiting next to my baby, taking the care steps, talking to him when I can bring myself to it and then carrying him around while looking at my phone to distract me from feeling so fucking miserable. I feel like i am stunting his development already because I am not singing and talking all day long getting him instead used to a mom distracted with a screen. Which is exactly what they found to be the problem which fucking screens making mothers not look at their babys.

This year being at home with the baby I wanted to establish all the firsts and make traditions starting. I wanted to go on stroller adventures. Cooking pumpkin soup for october. Halloween. I only managed to carve out a pumpkin and it took 2 attempts and my partner with the crying baby in the background. Now its christmas and I normally love that time. I didnt even decorate. No tree. I cannot even think of making cookies. I would rather stay home than walking the christmas market. So many visits and friends I kind of had to skip because the drive would exhaust me or baby is sick or the time available after work wouldnt fit with schedule. I am the one having all the time of the day so its my part to come. ""Can you not pump and leave the baby with dad to come to my birthday party from 8pm to 3am? Lets party."" No, fuck you, fuck this. I know they mean well. I am 30 next year and still one of the firsts having a baby. I guess they will come to understand me when it is their turn.

I try a lot to just get out of the house and make the day pass. I go visit my mom or my grandpa, my sister or whatever. So they would all be loving that baby and I could just give him to other people. I do nothing than complaining to all those people, in the beginning it was okayish and lots of understanding. Lots of changes all the time so it was always something new. Now I feel like everyone is only tolerating me because they want to see the baby. Because I am just tired and complaining about being so damn tired. I have to explain my sleep struggles again and again because its always the same. 'But you can sleep when hes down'. 'Just sleep'. 'bring him for 2 hours, enjoy the quiet flat and go to sleep'. My brain wont let me take these offers because I know its just for nothing. I am so fucking neurotic. In the bright daytime i wont be able to sleep and one hour here or there just tends to agitate me even further. I want a full rem cycle at night. How is that too much? I dont need more. Just these 3-4 hours somewhere between 11pm and 5am . But these are exactly the times my baby does not want to stay put. 

I just hate everything. A friend of mine is in Sri Lanka right now making it the next stamp in her passport, we are in even less contact. Another friend is having her 3 week end of the year vacation and enjoys all the christmas spirit and all the baileys in her coffee. My sister and mom are extra busy because christmas time. Everyone shows off their beautiful trees and windows. I wanted this baby, my life before wasnt even extraordinary its not like I had to sacrifice a whole career or traveling or partying all the time or something. I had a pretty content but rather quiet day to day. But there were opportunities and things i would look forward to. 

Now I am just fearing all the milestones I have to reach until this baby is somewhat grown enough to not make my whole day miserable and i just want to leave my baby to cry himself to sleep so he will just give up on the idea of needing me since i am a failure anyways.

I don't hate  Christian who are normal you guys are awesome people but the people who shove religion down others throats and etc, just I don't like where he is taking the direction of the channel as a viewer but I understand and I agree he honestly needed religion to be happy based off some of the stuff he said he was going through and if he wants to be a Christian that's fine go for it good for him I'm glad he is happy.

just the golden rule of treat others how you want to be treated is kinda just disregarded about some of the stuff he said about atheists like ""atheists will never be happy""  which I can assure you is wrong(from my experiences). Also just his coffee thing and his after covid symptoms just sounds like really bad psychological problems and can be explained with him being very depressed (I'm not a doctor either but just repeating what another guy's post said :/ ) .

and for all the kinda dumb Christian fans (but not to the ones who are normal, love yall) that are saying things like we are leaving just because he is just a Christian or we are fake fans. Not really just he going to do religious videos now and we don't share the same view. And lets be honest if the tables were turned and Alfa used to be a Christian and became a athiest and said things like Christians will never be happy and he wants to start make videos about how there is no god I don't think yall will stick around long either...

I’m currently using the Careers Online site seeing as the postings on Seek and Jora never respond to me and I end up getting a million spam messages/calls after sending in an application. Currently all I’m seeing available at the moment are postings for private tutoring at some of the unimelb colleges and then a bunch more with private tutoring companies:

- Queens College
- University College
- Tutor Lim
- Ainos Education Centre

Now, I used to work as a private tutor at a company called Alchemy Tuition when I was in high school. I can say that my experience there was pretty crap, but it was fine given that I was a kid (low pay for amount of work, resources given were pretty awful and sometimes had genuinely incorrect answers, etc). I feel fairly confident that these other jobs would probably be similar, but I’m wondering if anyone here has any experience working with these private tutoring companies or as a college tutor and can provide me some insight as to whether it’s worth applying. The job market is otherwise looking a tad bleak unless I go back to slogging it at a cafe.
