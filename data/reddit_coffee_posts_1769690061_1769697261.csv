1qqa1xc,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1qqa1xc/i_worked_at_a_gas_station_where_no_one_loses_the/,I worked at a gas station where no one loses the lottery,"I used to work nights at the 24-hour Shell on the edge of Elmwood. Flickering sodium lights, the diesel stench that never quite left your clothes, the clock above the register stuck three minutes behind, like even time was too tired to move.

A typical shift was nothing. Count the same pack of Marlboros for the third time at 4 a.m., listen to the coffee machine gurgle like it was dying, watch moths spiral into the bug zapper outside until the pop-pop-pop sounded like distant gunfire. Sometimes a regular drunk, old Ray, would stumble in, buy a tallboy and a single scratchoff he never won. He'd scratch it with his thumbnail, mutter ""next time,"" and shuffle back into the dark. Routine. Safe. Boring enough to make you forget how empty the streets sounded at 3 a.m.

The scratchoff machine sat in the corner like it had always been there. Bulky, beige, older than me. Customers started calling it ""lucky"" after the first few big hits.

Mr. Harlan came in every Tuesday like clockwork. Always the same, Marlboros, one ticket, scratched slow and deliberate with a nickel he kept in his pocket, purposely stored. He'd hum tunelessly while he worked the foil, like he was coaxing the win out. One night he hit $50, tipped me a ten, said, ""See? Patience pays."" Next week $100. He started scratching slower each time, eyes fixed, like he was afraid to miss a silver flake.

Harlan stopped coming by after he won a few more times, odd for a routine driven guy like him.  Sheriff Roland stopped by now and then. Always for a blue raspberry slushy mid shift. “This stuff never gets old.” He said with a blue smile.

I asked him about Mr. Harlan, given that this was the second Tuesday he didn’t show.

“Mind if I ask you something, Sheriff?”

He set the slushy on the counter, adjusted his glasses. “Long as it’s not about parking tickets.”

“Harlan used to come in every Tuesday always the same time. I haven’t seen him since he won a bunch of scratchoff tickets. This is the third week in a row.”

Roland watched the machine while I talked. Didn’t look at me once.

“Trailer was empty when his employer reported him missing,” he said finally. “The lights in the house were all burning, and the fridge door open.”

“That’s weird, anything out of the ordinary?” I asked.

His jaw tightened. Just a little.

“Winning tickets on the dining room table,” he said. “Like somebody left in a hurry.”

I pointed toward the corner where the machine rested. “They came from that machine.”

He took a long pull from the straw, eyes still on the screen with his spectacles reflecting the light it emitted.

“People who catch a break don’t always leave a forwarding address,” he said. “Some folks take the chance to disappear.”

He picked up the slushy and headed for the door.

“You worry too much,” he added. “This town does that to people.”

I watched him go, but the problem was Mr. Harlan wasn’t the only one who’d caught a break. And he wasn’t the only one who’d stopped coming back.

Tammy from the diner across the street used to come in after her graveyard shift, still in her uniform, smelling of grease and cheap cigarettes. She'd buy a ticket, scratch it fast like it owed her money, laugh when she lost. After her $200 win she started showing up later and later, alone, eyes glassy. ""This machine knows me,"" she told me once, voice low. Quit her job the next day. No one saw her after that.

Another case was Jake, the mechanic. Loud enough that you always heard him before you saw him. A loud guy, always mentioned about how he just needed one more win to finally fix the shop “for good.” One night he hit five hundred dollars, the biggest payout I ever saw from that machine. A week later, Jake was dead. His truck went straight off the ravine on Dew Pass. The news spread through town like the flu. People whispered about it, “no skid marks, no swerve”. “Just tire tracks, arrow straight, disappearing over the edge.” Most folks settled on the obvious explanation, that he was drunk, blacked out, another senseless accident. But anyone who knew Jake knew better. He loved two things more than anything else, his truck, and his work.

Mr. Jones loved it. Sales tripled. He hung a little handwritten sign above the machine, “Our Lucky Scratchers!"" with a winking emoji sticker.

When I mentioned how many winners had vanished, he smiled that small, polite smile and said, ""People win, they move on. Life changes. You should play too, Night Boy. Maybe your luck is waiting."" He said it the way someone offers you a mint after they've already slipped something in your drink.

I thought about it longer than I should have. Tried to line things up. Still came up with loose ends. Three people. Same routine. Same machine. All of it breaking the same way after they won. I told myself there were explanations. People change. People make bad decisions when money shows up. That’s what everyone says. But Jake loved that truck. Loved it enough that he wouldn’t even drink if he planned on driving it home. He lived two blocks from his shop. Close enough to walk. So why did he drive up the mountain?

I knew that there was only one way to find out what the hell was going on.  I started testing tickets on slow shifts.

First time I hesitated, stood there staring at the dispenser like it might bite. ""Just one,"" I told myself. ""See if it's really lucky."" Used the same quarter every time, same spot at the counter, same slow scratch. The win felt like a tiny electric kiss, sharp, a rush, followed immediately by cold nausea crawling up my throat. It was the same feeling you get when you deliberately do something you’re not supposed to. After the rush, it felt like the foil was scraping something inside my skull. My hands started shaking the way Tammy’s hands shook. Convinced myself it was the energy drink.

One slow night I tried to warn a guy, middle-aged, quiet, buying a stack for his wife's birthday.

""Hey, man,"" I said, keeping my voice casual.

""Maybe skip these tonight. Weird shit's been happening with winners.""  He laughed.

""You trying to scare off business?"" Mr. Jones appeared from the back, calm as ever.

 ""He's joking. Play if you want. Luck's luck."" The guy bought them anyway. Never saw him or his family again.

The machine started acting in a way that it wanted to be observed. Screen lagging on animations, like it was thinking. Dispenser clicking when no one was near it, soft, expectant. Every time when I turned my back to stock shelves, my skin prickled like someone was staring. As if a shadow was lurking behind me, a felt presence from a specific direction.

My spatial awareness sharpened to a painful clarity. The bug zapper outside fell into sync with my breathing, pop on the inhale, pop on the exhale. Each crack of electricity landed somewhere deep in my chest, every sound and smell arriving amplified, distorted, wrong. I could feel each electrical impulse firing through my synapses, as if my nerves were no longer my own but part of the current itself.

One night the power dipped. Everything died except the machine. Its screen stayed bright, cycling slower. I leaned close. For half a second the text changed,

“I WIN”

Then back to normal.

I would never forget the time a kid, maybe nineteen, came in around 3:00 a.m. He bought ten tickets with crumpled twenties. Scratched them one after another at the counter. The sound was intimate, slow scrape-scrape-scrape of coin on foil, each layer peeling back with a faint metallic sigh. The smell of fresh scratchoff film filled the air, powdery, chemical, distinctive.  

He won every single one. Laughed so hard he started coughing, bought more tickets, then continued scratching, like he couldn’t stop. His fingers sped up, then slowed again careful. Deliberate.

I knew something was wrong before his eyes went empty. He was smiling. He never stopped smiling. By the time I followed him outside, he was sitting in his Civic with the engine running, just staring down at the tickets spread across his lap. The smile was still there, pulled wider than it should’ve been, like his face had forgotten how to relax, or how to look normal. I watched the clock over the register roll forward and back again. He didn’t move for almost an hour.

I tapped the window. Nothing. His mouth moved, stretching soundlessly, working at words that never came. Mucus pouring out of his mouth, dilated pupils which can only be associated with the effect some kind of extreme drug. I called for an ambulance. They didn’t arrive for three hours. By then his hands were locked around the tickets, fingers curled tight like claws. The paramedics had to peel them loose one by one.

After the incident, I couldn’t sleep without dreaming about his face. Not screaming. Not in pain. Just that euphoric, vacant expression.

I kept thinking about it afterwards, he was fine before he bought the tickets.

I broke in on my night off.

I still had the spare key from closing. The store was pitch black, except for the machine’s haze. Its glow pulsed softly, slow and inconsistent, like it was breathing. I stood there longer than I meant to, weighing consequences I already knew I would ignore. I was drawn to it. To the light. To the smell of freshly printed hard paper. To the shimmer of silver foil and the dry whisper it made when peeled away. My mouth watered. The hair along my arms and neck stood on end. Tears pooled in my eye sockets as the urge, to scratch and win swelled until it filled every inch of me. I acknowledged it. Communicated with it without words. I wanted to obey it.

Then a moment slipped past, what felt like a trance, a waking daydream where my body simply took over. My arm reached out on its own, fingers closing in on the print button. I tore myself away and yanked the plug from the wall, heart hammering. The cord came free cleanly. The screen stayed lit.

“The fuck?” I whispered.

I grabbed the broom from the storeroom and struck the screen. It answered with a dull, hollow thump. Something sounded back. A voice. Very close. Very patient.

What came out of the machine could only be described as a distorted grunt. It spoke my name, first, middle, last, slowly, like it was reading from an old report card. Then it said my mother’s name, the way she used to when I was little and in trouble. Soft. Disappointed. The air thickened with the smell of it, powdery, metallic scratchoff foil, undercut by something wetter. Like coins left too long in a corpse’s pocket.

I froze. I clamped my hands over my ears, desperate to shut out the lie. It didn’t sound like her, but I recognized it. Her. It. The noise swelled anyway, forcing its way through the gaps between my fingers. I squeezed my eyes shut, bracing for something terrible. Light burned through my eyelids, searing white. I gave in to the weight of my body and folded forward, burying my head between my knees. This was it.

Then it stopped. The light. The sound. I opened my eyes slowly.

The store was full of cops.

Mr. Jones told the cops I’d had an episode. He showed them the footage, me standing alone in the dark, perfectly still, eyes fixed on something that wasn’t there, whispering for twenty straight minutes. I didn’t remember any of it. Not the words. Not the time missing. Nothing.

The cops gave me a warning and left it at that. No charges. No paperwork. Just looks. Mr. Jones stood beside them the whole time, calm, smiling softly. When they turned to go, he gave me a little wink, like we shared something.

I told myself I was grateful.

Word spread fast. It always does in towns like this. Night Boy lost it. People started asking if I was okay, the way you ask someone with a rash if it’s contagious. Mr. Jones stayed too calm. Customers complained about the missing machine. He told them it was “under repair.”

It never came back.

A few days later I drove past the Shell at 2:00 a.m. again. Lights off except the corner window. A faint glow leaked out, the kind that doesn’t come from fluorescent tubes. The silhouette inside was wrong, too still, too patient. A new machine, maybe. Or the same one, just rolled to the next stop on the line.

Someone stood at the counter. Scratching. Slow. Methodical. The coin moved in tiny, deliberate circles, like they had all the time in the world. Behind them the shadow was taller now. Not moving. Just taller.

I was drawn by it, I accelerated. Didn’t look back.

But every gas station I pass, my fingers twitch for foil. Every time I blink, I see hands, dozens, hundreds, peeling silver in perfect unison. Faces stretched wide, grinning the way winners grin when the numbers finally line up. Mouths open too far. Eyes too bright.

They’re still winning. Still scratching. Still whispering the names back to each other like a prayer they can’t stop saying. The glow moves. It follows me.

Late at night I catch myself murmuring their names. Not mine. Theirs. Curious of what I escaped, and why they failed.

If you drive past one of those machines someday. You’ll feel the pull. Just one ticket. Just to see. And when your fingers close around the foil, when the first silver flake curls away, you’ll hear it.  Your name.

You won’t win it.

It will win you.",1,1769696983.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

That's why I’m in a situation that’s making me physically sick and I really don’t know how to handle it. I need some honest advice.

Last night, I went to a coffee shop downtown to study. It’s a place I go to a lot. Around eight, I looked out the window and saw my friend’s girlfriend walking down the street. She was with a guy. A guy who is definitely not my friend.

They weren’t just walking. They were holding hands. Then they stopped under one of those big streetlights and kissed. Just a peck. Then they laughed and kept walking, arms around each other.

My friend Jake and this girl have been together for almost two years. He’s one of the nicest guys I know. He’s genuinely in love with her. He talks about their future all the time. Last week he was stressing about what to get her for their anniversary.

Now I’m holding this massive secret and I feel like it’s burning a hole in my chest. Part of me thinks I have to tell him. He deserves to know. But another part is terrified. What if she has some explanation? What if it somehow blows back on me and I lose my friend? What if he shoots the messenger?

I also keep thinking, maybe it’s not my place. Maybe I should stay out of it. But the idea of sitting across from him, knowing what I saw while he talks about how great she is, makes me feel like a liar.

I haven’t been able to focus on anything since last night. Do I tell him? And if I do, how do I even start that conversation without completely destroying him? I feel stuck.",1,1769696850.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

4. Your £50 reward will be credited to your account after your first direct debit has been taken - I received mine 2 weeks after the direct debit.

**My hot tips:**

* When getting your quote, enter your “actual” energy usage using an old bill instead of using the “low, medium, high” options to keep your direct debit payments accurate
* In your online account, you can reduce your monthly direct debits if you think they're too high - I lowered my mine by about 70%!

**My experience + timeline:**

I switched from Shell Energy to Octopus as it worked out cheaper across the board for both gas and electricity, so the £50 switch reward was a total bonus. The £50 was applied to my account less than 2 weeks after my first direct debit was taken and the switch process was probably the smoothest I’ve ever experienced. If you have a smart meter, you can also claim a free Caffe Nero or Greggs coffee each week as a free perk. Another plus: NO FEES if you decide to switch out elsewhere at any time!

I took a year off for studies, things didn’t go as planned, I failed an exam, and I’m currently job hunting. I think anyone who’s been in a bad phase can understand the emotions that come with it.

A few days ago, my sister and I decided to go to the mall. It was my idea, and we also wanted to buy a gift for our 1-year-old niece. I went with my elder sister. On the way, she asked how we should go, and I said anything is fine. She suggested booking a cab, but I told her I was short on cash and couldn’t afford it. She said, “It was your idea, you should pay,” so we ended up taking the bus.

That day, I was actually in a good mood. I’d been watching food vlogs and really wanted to go out and eat—I hadn’t gone out in months and just wanted a small break from all the stress. But the day turned out to be really upsetting.

At the mall, we went shopping. we bought a gift for my niece, and she bought a top and i did too. I politely told her I didn’t have enough money to pay for everything and asked if she could cover it. She refused and said I should pay. I ended up paying the bill for her too.

For context, I’m the middle child—I have a younger brother and I’m younger than her. Whenever we go out, I usually end up paying. I’ve never really said no because I just want all of us to enjoy without fighting over money. I also avoid asking my mom for money because I feel guilty.

Later, we went to eat. I couldn’t afford to order much, so I just got a coffee. She ordered food, which we shared. She paid for the return trip.

What’s bothering me more is that back in January, it was her birthday. I know she was overwhelmed because many of her friends didn’t call her—which honestly is just adult life. She wanted to go out for dinner, and I even asked if I should book a restaurant. She decided to celebrate at home instead. I bought her a custom cake, balloons, helped with decorations, and even crocheted a scarf for her. Despite all that, she later said it was her worst birthday.

Now I keep wondering if I overreacted about everything. I want to forgive her, but I can’t seem to let go of how hurt and unappreciated I felt. Maybe I’m just more sensitive because of everything I’m dealing with right now. for redit story ",1,1769696280.0,venting,2,1.0,False

\--Craft: handmade

\--Packaging:  Safety packaging in a Gift Box

\--Suitable for: black or herbal tea, fragrant tea, coffee, juice brewing, hot water heating, holidays, guests,personal relaxation, meditation, family time tea, professional use.

\--Features: Easy to use and convenient for travel and gift options due to its small size.



\*\*\*\*Touch, Look, Feel of this Ceremonial Item\*\*\*\*

\--The handmade teapot and cups are manually measured, and each varies from the next.  Therefore, sizes may be marginally different due to hand measuring, since the fired batches are accompanied by thermal expansion and contraction.

\--Texture:  The textures formed by high-temperature daily tea utensils are natural, randomly occurring in a kiln that passes through more than 1,000 degrees, and cannot be controlled or avoided.  

For example,  the porcelain will have small black spots/pinholes because the raw material contains iron and other minerals naturally formed after high temperature firing. The natural patina does not affect use.  Removing them would greatly harm the good porcelain itself.

 \--Nature's Stamp of Approval: Also, tiny nodes formed by bamboo and wood products during the growth of trees used in crafting will show, and cannot be avoided or screened out when production is by hand.

1. Spoiled\_brat15 (15F) & cottoncandy4444 (15M)

You two are an absolute dream match at exactly 15 years old with perfectly aligned vibes. Both of you adore Brooklyn 99 for its hilarious comedy and clever writing, and you're heavily into Roblox (plus she plays Genshin too). Your talking styles sync up—you both open up a lot when comfortable—and you love public affection like hugs and hand-holding. You value humor, confidence, and someone who gets your jokes without being weird. This could feel like instant best-friend energy turning romantic, with endless late-night Roblox sessions and sitcom marathons.

2. Extension\_Sky6140 (18F) & u/Impressive-Theme-818 (18M)

Both 18 and craving the same calm, understanding connection. She prioritizes respectful, non-judgmental listeners who are career-oriented, while you proudly list being a good listener, respectful, and caring. No intense gaming pressure (neither lists heavy multiplayer), but shared love for music/singing and thoughtful shows—her Modern Family for stress-relief laughs matches your Loki sci-fi depth.

3. teruumaruneka (16F) & u/DisasterOk8440 (16M)

Spot-on same-age match at 16 with deep introvert souls who value real vulnerability and individuality. Heavy anime overlap (her MHA as first anime love; your Darling in the Franxx for emotional impact and world views) plus reading/literature and gaming (Genshin/Wuwa for her; Rocket League/OSU/Project Sekai vibes for you). Both seek loyal, non-judgmental partners who listen without ghosting. Your balanced me-time + us-time and willingness to open up completely when trusted could create a safe, creative space

4. celestial-2011 (14F) & Irgend-ein-typ (14M)

Perfect 14-year-old duo with quiet, guarded hearts seeking genuine kindness and care. You both prefer listening over constant talking, love reading/series (her Insatiable for life-turnaround inspo; your Merlin for fantasy adventure), and enjoy creative/strategic hobbies like chess or puzzles. Shy about public affection but craving reassurance through sweet words and check-ins. Your shared preference for partners who plan surprises and lead gently, plus testing trust slowly, means you'd build something slow, sweet, and protective together—ideal for young, cautious first connections

5. doloress\_62 (18F) & PristineDonut-22 (19M)

Close 18–19 ages with a cozy, action-oriented vibe. She loves singing, reading books, music, and going out; you play guitar, read, enjoy coffee/tech/electronics, and value showing care through actions rather than over-the-top words. Both introverted/mixed personalities who need occasional reassurance but thrive on balanced independence. You seek kind, unique partners (she wants loyal/kind/loving friends; you want someone who likes you for you). Coffee dates, quiet reading sessions, and music sharing could feel naturally intimate and low-pressure

6. Fair\_Relationship116 (16F) & U/select-angle-5529 (18M)

Strong gaming synergy at 16–18: Valorant, Roblox, Genshin, Minecraft all in common, plus music/reading/sci-fi interests. She values empathy, no-judgment listening, and daily check-ins; you prioritize caring/loyal/sweet partners who communicate openly. Both balanced independence seekers who chat a lot when comfy and show affection publicly. Your shared openness to vulnerability (opening up completely when trusted) and love for planning surprises could lead to fun gaming nights turning into meaningful, supportive talks.

7. u/CockroachBoth6713 (18F) & Necessary-Book4021 (16M)

Ages flexible (18F with 16M works well here). Huge creative/music overlap—she plays piano/sings and loves art/sports; you play guitar, enjoy movies/TV/anime, walking. Both crave loyalty, honesty, and someone who doesn't ghost. You both talk a lot when comfortable, prefer equal decisions, and value reassurance through actions/words. Her broad hobbies (volleyball/netball/horse riding) pair nicely with your chill creative energy for shared activities, deep anime chats, and building trust slowly in a kind, non-toxic way

8. Vast\_Fox6793 (\~15-16F, Minecraft/Roblox) & Rybix\_1912 (15M)

Exact 15-year-old energy with heavy Roblox/Minecraft overlap for endless building/survival worlds. Both introverted/quiet, guarded on deep sharing (test with small secrets), but seek loyal, kind, non-judgmental partners who understand problems without judging looks. Balanced independence and occasional sweet words fit your slower-trust styles. This could grow into a gentle, fun friendship-to-more with private servers, shared hobbies, and quiet support that feels safe and genuine

9. Smklovee (\~15F, Roblox) & adaptforthewin (15M)

Same 15-year-old range with solid Roblox foundation for co-op fun. Balanced personalities—you both talk a lot when comfy, mix planning/leading, and value trust/communication highly. Music, friendly debates on random topics, and useless-fun arguments match her chill Roblox energy. Both seek partners who relate deeply without weirdness. This pairing screams playful banter, late-night voice chats, and building trust through shared laughs and honest talks. ",10,1769696008.0,teenagersbutpractical,6,0.86,False

I (28F) met someone online (33M) on reddit. I am single and was looking for chats and maybe fun.   
We chatted for 2-3 weeks and hit it off. In this period, he did share some photos of himself, both SFW and NSFW. He hinted he's looking for just fun which I am fine with.

We had an impromptu coffee a few days ago as our offices are nearby. After the coffee (we then went back to work respectively), we both cancelled our plans to hang out for dinner that same day which we ended the night with drinks.

 Our chats have been both SFW and NSFW. We have been incredibly flirty, he was very touchy too which I didn’t shy from.

  
We were supposed to have dinner together today but he cancelled last minute yesterday night with a last min work trip excuse and has been cold  since. I was excited for dinner so decided to call the restaurant to check if the reservation is still available so I could go with a friend. To my surprise, the restaurant told me the reservation was changed to a table of 3. 

I then did a bit of stalking (im not proud of this) and it turns out he's engaged. I am ok to be rejected and even checked in with him after dinner the other day if he still wants to see me today, which he said yes to. I would like to again clarify, I had no idea he was attached.

1qq9it0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1qq9it0/respect_boundaries_and_nazar/,"Respect, boundaries and nazar","Hello everyone. I hope this reaches the right people. To the men.

First of all, respect the women in your life. You never know what they have been through or are going through. 

Secondly, respect their boundaries. Every human has their own boundaries which they don't want anyone to cross. And it's more especially in females. Of course we are to be blamed for that. 

And last but not the least, be very careful of your surroundings. You can never know what's going on in a person's mind. Better safe than sorry. 

Here. Let me tell you a small story of mine which made me realise the importance of this. 

I, 21 M, have recently joined for an internship. I met a girl, 21 F, with whom I quickly developed a bond. We shared many common interests and had a like mindset. We used to hang out all the time both in the office and outside. During our tea and lunch break we talked, listened to music, watched series, etc. She was NOT my girlfriend. So a few days back she suddenly started ghosting me and when I approached her she said she needed some alone time. I ""RESPECTED"" her ""BOUNDARY"" and went my way. Today when I met her and asked about her she asked me not to speak with her anymore. I was shocked by this and asked,""what's wrong? What happened?"" So she responded that I creep her out and that I've touched her inappropriately. Whether you believe me or not. I'm not that kind of guy. I was taught to respect women. My mom always said that my father treats her like a queen. So I am, in a way, inspired by my old man. Never in my life I would do such a thing to a woman, be it a friend, a relative, or a stranger. It's just that one day when we went to have coffee, she showed me a music video, so I came close to watch it, i.e, I creeped her out. And when we stood back up to leave I may have accidentally touched her. I DIDN'T. I never even had such a thought in my mind. I was always good mannered with her. At first I tried to explain the same to her but she didn't listen, for which I don't blame her. So I took accountability and apologized to her that she had to go through that and I never do such things intentionally. It must have surely been an accident. She said she believed me and went her own way. 

So what I'm trying to say is, even if you are close with a woman, don't get too close, especially physical closeness. 

I've made peace with the fact that I may never be friends or even talk to her again. But she's a smart woman, the one who takes a stand for herself, which I deeply respect. I hope that she does well in life and achieves all her dreams. I may not be a part of that journey anymore but I am happy that I got to meet such a smart, energetic and beautiful woman in my life. Somewhere deep down I still hope she forgives me and we can be friends again but I know it's vain.

Idk if she even uses reddit but if she does I hope this reaches her. To show her that I am truly sorry and I miss our friendship very much. I'm very sorry bro.

And if y'all are wondering the whole point of ""NAZAR"" in this thread then whenever we used to hang out and have fun people used to give a side eye, which we obviously know what it means. Even I didn't believe in it at first but hey, do everything right and still get ass fucked? It's definitely something nastier at play.

I often struggle with decorating, but I came up with some rules to make it easier. I thought I'd share them. Let me know your thoughts or if you have any to add. I'd like to hear yours too:

* **Limit your colors** \- stick to 5 colors max, including your floor and walls
* **Mix shapes** \- if your chairs and media stand are rectangular, add something round like a coffee table
* **Vary materials** \- pair a fabric couch with a leather side chair with a wood tv stand

1qq96u9,https://www.reddit.com/r/MindfullyDriven/comments/1qq96u9/how_to_deal_with_high_functioning_depression/,How to Deal With HIGH FUNCTIONING Depression Without Losing Your Shit: The Psychology That Actually Works,"So you're that person who shows up to work on time, crushes deadlines, maybe even hits the gym occasionally. From the outside, you've got it together. But inside? It's like walking through mud while everyone thinks you're sprinting. Welcome to high functioning depression, the overachiever's dirty secret.



I spent months diving into research papers, therapy podcasts, and mental health literature trying to understand why so many of us are quietly drowning while appearing to swim. Turns out, our brains are biologically wired to prioritize survival over happiness, and modern society just cranks that tendency up to eleven. The performance anxiety, the constant comparison, the hustle culture that glorifies burnout. It's not some personal failing, it's just that we're running outdated software in a world that demands constant updates.



**Here's what actually helps, backed by people who study this stuff for a living:**

**\*\*Recognize the sneaky symptoms.\*\*** High functioning depression doesn't look like staying in bed for three days. It looks like being productive but feeling nothing. It's checking boxes while your soul checks out. Dr. Margaret Rutherford, clinical psychologist and author of Perfectly Hidden Depression, breaks down how this manifests as chronic people pleasing and emotional numbing. You might be crushing it professionally while your personal life feels like a badly written script you're forced to perform. The exhaustion isn't always physical, it's this bone deep emotional fatigue that sleep doesn't fix. Understanding this pattern is huge because you stop blaming yourself for not being ""depressed enough"" to deserve help.



**\*\*Therapy isn't just for crises.\*\*** The stigma around therapy is stupid and outdated. You don't wait until your arm falls off to see a doctor, so why wait for a complete breakdown to see a therapist? Cognitive Behavioral Therapy has insane amounts of research supporting its effectiveness for depression. It literally rewires how your brain processes thoughts. Apps like Ash can connect you with relationship coaches who help you navigate the interpersonal stuff that often feeds into depression. The whole ""I should be able to handle this myself"" mentality is exactly the perfectionism that keeps you stuck. Getting help isn't weakness, it's maintenance.



**\*\*Movement is annoyingly effective.\*\*** Yeah, I know, everyone says exercise helps and you want to punch them. But the research is overwhelming. Dr. John Ratey's book Spark: The Revolutionary New Science of Exercise and the Brain explains how physical activity literally grows new brain cells and regulates neurotransmitters better than some medications. You don't need to become a marathon runner. A 20 minute walk does more for your brain chemistry than scrolling for an hour. When you're depressed, your brain lies to you about what will help. It says stay home, stay still, stay safe. Moving your body, even when you don't want to, disrupts that pattern.



**\*\*Medication isn't giving up.\*\*** Some brains just don't produce enough serotonin or dopamine. That's biochemistry, not character weakness. If you had diabetes, you'd take insulin. Depression can be the same deal. Obviously talk to an actual psychiatrist, not Reddit, but don't let shame keep you from exploring what might genuinely rebalance your brain. The book Lost Connections by Johann Hari is fascinating because it explores both biological and social causes of depression. He won the British Book Awards and his work challenges you to think about depression in broader terms while still acknowledging that sometimes you need chemical support. It's nuanced and honest about what medication can and can't do.



**\*\*Build tiny sustainable rituals.\*\*** Forget massive life overhauls. Those fail because they require energy you don't have. Instead, stack micro habits onto existing routines. The Insight Timer app has five minute meditations that actually fit into real life. While your coffee brews, you sit and breathe. Not some mystical transcendence, just basic nervous system regulation. 



For anyone wanting a more structured approach to actually processing all this, *BeFreed* is an AI learning app that pulls from psychology research, mental health experts, and books like the ones mentioned here to create personalized audio content based on your specific struggles. Built by a team from Columbia, it generates learning plans tailored to goals like ""manage depression as a high achiever"" or ""stop people-pleasing patterns."" You can adjust the depth from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with examples when something clicks. The voice options are weirdly helpful too, a calm tone before bed or something more energetic during commutes. It's basically a way to keep learning about mental health without the cognitive load of reading when you're already exhausted.



Finch is another solid app for habit building that gamifies self care without being condescending. Small consistent actions accumulate. Your brain starts associating certain times of day with feeling slightly less terrible, and that builds momentum.



**\*\*Connect even when you don't want to.\***\* Depression is a lying isolationist that tells you nobody cares and you're a burden. Bull. Humans are wired for connection, and loneliness literally impacts your health as much as smoking. Force yourself to text one person. Show up to one social thing per week. Dr. Vivek Murthy's research on loneliness shows how social connection affects everything from immune function to lifespan. You don't have to fake happiness or trauma dump,to  just exist around other humans. The Feel Better Live More podcast by Dr. Rangan Chatterjee has incredible episodes on mental health and practical strategies that don't require you to quit your job and move to Bali.



Living with high functioning depression feels like being a duck. Smooth on the surface, paddling like hell underneath. But recognizing what's actually happening, using tools that have legitimate research behind them, and dropping the idea that you should white knuckle your way through life alone makes it manageable. Your brain's working against you sometimes because of biology and circumstance and a dozen factors you didn't choose. But you can work with it, slowly, imperfectly, and that counts for everything.",1,1769694930.0,MindfullyDriven,0,1.0,False

1qq93tt,https://v.redd.it/ve2xuercmagg1,Seeking honest feedback: gambling trigger tracking app with optional “buy me a coffee” IAP,"Here’s the thing: I couldn’t find any reason to paywall-gate features.

I’m developing a gambling habit-breaker app (working title: Break The Bet). The idea is to provide users a non-pushy way to understand what’s causing their triggers, and to show what exactly they’re losing in the long run.

You can watch the ~1 min video of me trying to use some features of the app.

I’ve tried to make it as frictionless as possible to log either an urge or an actual gambling event (that’s why I’m using a staged form, so any input provided is saved immediately, with the option to amend details later). The Inbox tab shows a badge if there are any items that need further information. I initially thought of showing the exact number in the Inbox badge, but I worried it might be overwhelming. Users can go to the Inbox and add information to any gambling urge or gambling event, which shows the exact stage of input they’re currently meant to complete.

I’m particularly proud of the App Shortcuts and App Intents for logging both a gambling urge and a gambling event without opening the app. This is the first time I’ve used these in an iOS app, and I’m now wondering why I haven’t used them before. Users can use Siri to log information. Just say, “Hey Siri, log gambled in Break The Bet.” Siri will ask, “How much?” You tell an amount, then Siri will ask whether it’s a loss or a win, and it saves the event. The same goes for logging an urge.

Now, as I always do, I asked ChatGPT to propose a strong monetisation plan for this app, and it suggested that this type of app works well with a one-time purchase, priced around the $5–$10 range. However, when I tried to decide which features to lock behind a paywall, I realised I’d be making the app genuinely unhelpful unless they pay (which is fine for most apps). I think that if someone gets even a small amount of help from this app, it’s still worth building—even if it makes me nothing. Probably the person downloading the app has just lost a bit of money gambling, and that’s why they’re trying to quit. Asking for more money to access the app and keep a frictionless user experience locked doesn’t sit right with me.

On the other hand, I’m a developer and I’m trying to make some money. So I thought of using a tip-jar style approach. If someone finds it helpful, they can buy me a small cup of coffee ($4.99) or a big cup of coffee ($9.99) in the form of consumable IAPs (so they can buy me coffee as many times as they want).

I’d love to hear your thoughts, feedback, or suggestions on the app—or the IAP approach itself.",2,1769694715.0,iosdev,0,1.0,False

First dentist mentioned replacing to be proactive. Second dentist mentioned replacing due to old weared amalgam fillings. Neither mentioned the option to crown it.

I read about the advantages/disadvantages of fillings vs inlay/onlay vs crown.

Three questions: (last one at the end)

1. I feel I should ask my dentist to crown #19 and to fill #18?
2. In case it will be a crown, should I choose Zirconia (due to less tooth prep) or Porcelain/Ceramic (to not destroy healthy opposing tooth)?

Last relapse 2024. Had a lot of relapses as a kid (mostly every time I catched a virus or bacterial infections) that needed hospitalization 2-3 times per year. I visit the dentist every 6 months*.* I use an electric toothbrush 3-4 times a day strictly. Floss daily also strictly (sometimes twice). Use Fluoride mouthwash 1 to 2 times a day 30 minutes after brushing. Started recently to use tongue scraper. Mostly mediterranean diet. Not a lot of snaking, just 3 meals per day. Nothing crunchy to my teeth, except cereal with milk. 

Should I be doing something else to improve my oral health?

I have attached some images.

Divorced 2 years ago, and getting back into dating is stressful and confusing. I’ve been with 2 women since then but nothing serious.

I (35m) have been gone back to school and have been spending a lot of time with a (30f) I met in class. We’ve known each other for almost a year. I’m definitely crushing on her (feel like a teenager saying that but whatever) and I tend to get anxious about it and her and worried I will or maybe even have messed up a chance and potential relationship.

Monday her and I and another friend went on a hike. On the hike it seemed she dropped a couple hints she might be interested.

Then Monday night after class her and I were talking about a hike we were planning for Saturday. The hike we were thinking of doing has a bit of a bumpy road to get to it, and she was worried her car wouldn’t be able to handle.

She said ‘maybe I could come to your house and we could carpool from there.’

Me, thinking that would add drive time for her said, ‘that would add to your drive, we could meet at a grocery store or something more on your way.’

She got a look that in the moment I couldn’t place, but was like disappointed. I woke up in the middle of the night that night and was like ‘oh, I think that was like a big hint and I missed it completely.’ I was anxious about it all day Tuesday and yesterday.

Then last night at class she was super off and disconnected in our class, we’re usually super tight. She didn’t seem like she wanted to go on the hike this weekend anymore.

Without talking directly about us, she said she feels like she doesn’t know how she feels, she wonders why she feels like she needs romantic love, etc. I said I get not being sure how you feel, she asked if I didn’t know how I felt too, and I said ‘yes.’ (Again, we were talking emotions in general as there were other people around but it felt like we’re talking about us.).

Although I know I have a crush on her, I’m just still uncomfortable with dating and putting myself out there.

She said she would text me about this weekend and about a yoga class we were planning on going to tomorrow. She seemed off and disappointed most of the night.

Am I reading too much into all of this?? Should I let it be, or would it be okay to text her ‘hey, I feel like there’s been some misunderstanding and just not direct communication. I would love to take you to coffee tomorrow and talk and put it all out on the table.’ Or even call her and say that.",1,1769694443.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

In November, we’re pretty sure that I had an early miscarriage. We went to a fertility clinic just to be sure we’re both okay. Thankfully, all test came out normal. 

I had only been doing OPKs for all of 2025 but I ran out early December. I had asked my husband for a Tempdrop as a King’s Day gift and it’s been one of the best gifts ever. I had tried doing BBT with a thermometer throughout these past 3 years but was never consistent. I’ve also been charting my CM for many years now so I’m very familiar with my cycle. 

Changes I made that may have impacted this cycle:

\- I made sure to have a balanced breakfast within 60 min of waking up (I wake up at 7). I work a 9-5 and have a coffee break at 11. I usually would have breakfast at that time since I’m not hungry in the mornings after waking up. But after re-listening to Fertility Friday podcast (I had already heard all the episodes.. haaa😅), Lisa Hendrickson-Jack emphasized the importance of breakfast. So I gave it a go. 

\- I had been sick earlier in my cycle and had a lot of congestion which made it hard to breathe when sleeping at night. I had already tried the Mucinex trick in my 4th month of TTC but it didn’t work for us. So I’m skeptical. 

\- I stopped the OPKs since I ran out. I think in part, this helped me because it took off the pressure of testing and feeling anxious about maybe loosing that fertile window. It took pressure off of us.

Checking performance before making coffee. Spending lunch breaks dissecting what made videos work. Lying awake replaying the ones that flopped trying to figure out why. It pretty much took over.

Why though. Because I actually believed that cracking this would unlock everything. Building something real. Getting opportunities. Maybe turning this into more than just posting for nobody. It all hinges on whether people actually stop scrolling when they see your video.

Here's what almost made me walk away completely. I was posting every day. Testing everything everyone said to try. Getting absolutely nowhere. I'd pour effort into something and watch it die at 500 views. Did what the successful people recommended. Bought their programs. Switched up my approach constantly. None of it moved the needle.

At some point I genuinely thought maybe I'm just not built for this. Like there's something other people have that I'm missing.

That's when I realized the real problem. I was putting in the work but had absolutely no idea what was actually broken. Just throwing spaghetti at the wall hoping something would stick.

So I stopped throwing and started measuring. Pulled up 50 videos. Tracked the exact second people clicked away on each one. Kept seeing the same issues killing everything.

Here's what I found.

**Being vague in your opening gets you skipped instantly.** I was starting with stuff like ""wait till you hear this"" thinking the mystery would hook people. Total opposite. ""I stopped drinking coffee for 65 days and my productivity dropped 40%"" actually stops the scroll. Vague just gets you passed over.

**Second 8 or 9 is the real make or break moment.** People aren't usually leaving right at the start. They're leaving around second 8 if you still haven't given them anything real. I was using that time to set things up or explain context when I should've already delivered the actual point. Now the payoff hits by second 8. That's where they really decide.

**Silence over like 1.3 seconds makes them think it's broken.** I tested this constantly and anything longer than maybe 1.3 seconds reads like the video stopped or got boring. What feels like normal rhythm to you feels like nothing's happening to someone deciding whether to keep watching. I cut way more aggressively now even when it feels choppy.

**If nothing's changing visually for over 5 seconds they're gone.** Doesn't matter if what you're saying is interesting. If the frame stays exactly the same for more than 5 seconds people get bored and scroll. I started moving the camera. Cutting to different angles. Zooming. Adding random stuff on screen. Whatever keeps something happening visually. My retention completely flipped after that.

**The videos people watch twice get exponentially more reach.** I started obsessively tracking how many people rewatched and the pattern was obvious. Videos where like 27% of viewers watched it again got pushed probably 10 times harder than ones where only 8% rewatched. So I started packing in little details you wouldn't catch the first time. Cutting faster. Making it actually worth a second look. Rewatch rate went up and the algorithm followed.

The real turning point wasn't grinding harder. It was finally knowing exactly what wasn't working instead of just taking shots in the dark. I found this app called TikAlyzser that tells you exactly what's wrong with your videos and how to fix them to get more views. Like it'll show you second 9 and say ""people dropped here because you paused too long"" or ""your visual stayed static for 8 seconds and that's when they left."" Your regular analytics just show you percentages but this shows you what you actually need to fix. That's when everything changed. Went from averaging maybe 500 views to consistently hitting over 21k in about four weeks.

If you're posting all the time but stuck under 1k views I doubt your content is the problem. You probably just can't see what's actually broken.

Look I'm putting this out there because it took me months of wanting to quit before I figured it out. I wish someone had just told me what was actually wrong instead of letting me guess for half a year. So I'm doing that for whoever needs to hear it.",1,1769694123.0,TikTokMonetizing,1,0.67,False

Here's what I am talking about: (quote from ""Gurdjieff Remembered"" - Chapter 12):

>

>I remember being slumped over the table, sipping at my coffee, when I began to feel a strange uprising of energy within myself—I stared at him, automatically straightened up, and it was as if a violent, electric blue light emanated from him and entered into me. As this happened, I could feel the tiredness drain out of me, but at the same moment his body slumped and his face turned grey as if it was being drained of life.

>(....)

>He was gone for perhaps fifteen minutes while I watched the food, feeling blank and amazed because I had never felt any better in my life. I was convinced then—and am now—that he knew how to transmit energy from himself to others; I was also convinced that it could only be done at great cost to himself. It also became obvious within the next few minutes that he knew how to renew his own energy quickly, for I was equally amazed when he returned to the kitchen to see the change in him; he looked like a young man again, alert, smiling, sly and full of good spirits.

Was the energy transfer a matter of focused attention and intention?

How did he renew his energy?

Why was it blue - is it a random caprice of imagination or it \_must\_ be blue for it to have this effect? Do you think it was actually visible in 3D space or it was somehow telepatically transferred as a thought-idea to Fritz's mind?!

Everything here reminds me of chi-work in daoist neigong (which I am not sure is a ""real"" thing as well, but if I suspend my uncertainty, there are definitely some parallels, for example in daoist neigong the goal is to become a ""zhenren"" - ""real man"" - a human who is not a slave to their automatic mind, which coincidentally is the goal of the Fourth way?!)

I’m an indie author and digital artist, and I’ve just released a collection that I think will hit the spot for those who love the intersection of industrial rot and psychological trauma.

It's called ""Manual for Advanced Solvers"".

I designed the cover  as a tribute to Francis Bacon’s ""Screaming Popes,"" but instead of a throne, my characters are trapped in the suffocating cage of 20th-century bureaucracy.

What’s inside the ""Manual"":

Administrative Liquefaction: Functionaries melting into their desks because the laws of physics are being ""renegotiated.""

Industrial Crucifixion: Technicians being repaired with duct tape and industrial staplers because they are ""running too hot.""

Cosmic Shoddy Work: 102 blue whales falling from the sky due to a clerical error in the Department of Destiny.

The Weight of Silence: Cities held together by sonic frequencies where a single withdrawal crisis can evaporate a whole block.

It’s 10 stories of Bureaucratic Body Horror. It smells like ozone, stale coffee, and rust.

t’s not just splatter; it’s about the horror of being a ""clot of matter"" in a world of rigid, failing forms.

I'd love to hear your thoughts.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

There’s this girl (let’s call her *Lara*), who used to be close friends with my girlfriend (*Amanda*) and three other girls. Honestly, Lara has been acting childish, petty, and downright mean. All of them are 19 or 20 now, and they’re in college.

Back in high school, Amanda, Lara, and the others had these shared journals/diaries where they wrote about school, personal stuff, and even notes about when Amanda first started liking me. It was a group project, with contributions from all five of them.

But after a certain incident, Lara cut off contact with everyone, claiming *they* were the ones being toxic. Here’s the flashback of the ""incident"":

Last year, I had my Krav Maga yellow belt graduation at 3 PM. This ceremony had been scheduled since the beginning of the year. Amanda came to watch. Coincidentally, Lara had planned her birthday coffee meet-up at 4 PM. Amanda told Lara ahead of time she’d be about 15 minutes late (since Lara lived nearby). Instead of being understanding, Lara freaked out. First she ignored the group chat, then—right after my graduation ended—she canceled the coffee altogether, saying they were “always inconsiderate” and had been treating her badly since 2022 (which she had never mentioned before). The girls even tried to talk it out in person, but Lara doubled down, saying she didn’t want anything to do with them anymore and that the whole friendship was “toxic.”

After that, she distanced herself. Later that year, the girls asked her to return 2 of the 4 diaries she had kept (yes, she held onto *all four*). She refused, saying they meant too much to her—even though she was blaming Amanda and the others for everything. The girls eventually decided to drop the whole thing, since nothing seemed to convince Lara.

This year, they tried again, hoping she’d change her mind. But Lara insisted she bought the notebooks, so they were hers. The girls even offered to *pay her back* for them, but she still refused, claiming they contained her personal stories and she didn’t trust them. The thing is, those diaries were *shared*, with personal entries from all five girls. So if Lara didn’t trust the others to safeguard her personal entries, why should the girls trust *her* to keep all four journals? It makes absolutely no sense. Doesn’t it feel like everything always has to revolve around Lara, on her terms only?

Meanwhile, another girl in the group (*Ingrid*) drifted away too, but in a healthy way — no drama, and she’s still on good terms with Amanda and the others. Ingrid had bought one of the notebooks, while Lara bought the other three. Ingrid doesn’t care much about the diaries, so she’s not involved in this mess.

Here’s a translated snippet of their recent messages (Yasmin, one of Amanda’s friends, talking to Lara):

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Yasmin:** Hey Lara! How are you? The girls and I were thinking, and we really want the journals back since they’re sentimental to us. Since we all wrote in them, we thought maybe you could keep two and we’d keep the other two. We could digitize them or share photos so nothing gets lost. What do you think?

**Lara:** Hey Yasmin. I won’t give up the journals. They’re valuable to me too, and I bought them with my own money. Ingrid bought one of them.

**Yasmin:** That’s fine, if money is the issue we’ll pay you back.

**Yasmin:** We’ll leave the one Ingrid bought with her, if she wants it.

**Lara:** The only thing I’ll do is send photos.

**Yasmin:** Honest question: if we hurt you, why do you want to keep this from us?

**Yasmin:** It’s sentimental for all of us equally. Just let us have two.

**Yasmin:** And again, if money is the problem, we’ll pay.

**Lara:** The friendship is over, there’s no reason to debate what I think. We’re talking about the journals, as you suggested. The journals were my idea, and Ingrid and I wrote most of them. I don’t trust you with what I recorded that was so personal. It’s not out of spite or punishment. Whether you think that’s valid or not isn’t the point. The most I’ll do is send the parts you wrote. I’ll do that tomorrow and I won’t change my mind.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I know it might sound extreme, but this feels so unfair it makes me furious. I just wish Lara had the slightest bit of empathy, but she doesn’t. So my idea was to involve her mom.

Her mom has always been kind to us. For example, once I went through a really scary situation (I was kidnapped—thankfully I’m fine now), and afterward, her mom sent me sweets along with a handwritten prayer on a piece of paper and a little note saying that everything had passed and giving me blessings. I barely even talked to her, since the friend group was Amanda’s, but that gesture was incredibly thoughtful.

My plan was to explain the situation to her mom and ask if she could talk to Lara. I’m sure her mom would understand, but I don’t know if Lara would listen. And yes, involving her mom would probably mean involving the other girls’ moms too, including Amanda’s.

I get it — everyone here is over 18, so why bring moms into it? But at least here in Brazil, moms often want to get involved in these things, whether out of concern or wanting to help. And yes, I’d like to use that to our advantage, even though I’m clearly not sure it would actually work.

So here’s my question: **Am I BEING asshole for wanting to stir things up and involve Lara’s mom, even though Lara is 19 but acting like a child?**

I’m talking about servers (coffee shops, fast food, sandwich places, etc.), especially younger ones. Not all of them, obviously  but enough that it’s becoming a pattern.
Sometimes after a customer leaves often ""an older person or a woman"" the server will suddenly start making jokes or talking trash about them to me, like we’re buddies. Commenting on how they talked, what they ordered, how they looked, whatever. It’s framed as “just joking,” but it’s clearly disrespectful.
as an example once a woman asked ""about their (harisa)if it's too hot in a sandwich shop and after she left he told me"" aw zbi 7ar "" addressing that lady .
And the awkward part? I feel pressured to either laugh or stay neutral. Not because I agree, but because I don’t want my service to suddenly get worse or to become the next joke. So I just kind of nod, give a fake smile, and wait for my order.

For years, I pushed through my afternoons with caffeine. Another coffee. Another boost. Another crash.  
  
What I didn’t realize back then was this:  
 

I wasn’t low on motivation.  
I was **under-repaired at the cellular level**.  
 

That’s exactly why I recorded this brand new episode and why I partnered with [**Wonderfeel**.](http://benazadi.com/wonderfeel1?mc_cid=eb436f271b&mc_eid=UNIQID)  
 

In this episode, I break down a simple 10-minute daily ritual that restores the signals your body needs to repair itself. And the **midday reset** is where Wonderfeel plays a powerful role.  
 

Here’s what most people never hear:  
 

By your mid-30s, your NAD+ levels naturally decline.  
That’s the cellular “battery” your body uses to create energy, burn fat, repair DNA, and keep your brain sharp.  
 

When NAD+ drops, everything slows down.  
Energy dips.  
Fat loss stalls.  
Brain fog creeps in.  
 

Wonderfeel isn’t a stimulant.  
It doesn’t borrow energy from tomorrow.  
It supports your body’s **natural repair systems**, so you feel clear, steady, and focused without crashing.  
 

That’s why I personally use it as part of my midday ritual.

 More stable energy  
 Sharper focus  
 Better metabolic repair

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

It is very important for couples to understand the process, how to get ready for it and what to expect during the treatment journey. We at Gunjan IVF World – an IVF clinic in Ghaziabad know it very well that making the decision to go for IVF is a difficult one for you. You might be a working professional – managing household chores and taking care of the family. Finding time to start a family gets difficult. In case, you have been unable to conceive naturally even after trying for over a year, it is advisable that you consult a fertility doctor. Read this article by the best IVF doctor in Indirapuram from Gunjan IVF World on what all things first time patients need to know before stating IVF treatment.

**What is IVF**

“IVF is a fertility treatment method in which eggs are collected from the ovaries, fertilised with sperm in an advanced IVF lab, and the embryo formed post fertilisation is transferred into the uterus to achieve a healthy pregnancy,” stated Dr. Gunjan Gupta, well-known gynaecologist Ghaziabad and the Founder & Director of Gunjan IVF World – a leading IVF clinic in Ghaziabad. Gunjan IVF World is the third time winner of North India’s best IVF clinic chain by ETHealthWorld and has highly advanced centers at Janakpuri, Meerut and Noida.

**Medical basics to know**

Initial tests and evaluations: “Before starting IVF treatment, it is very important for couples to undergo detailed evaluations which include blood tests to check AMH, hormone levels, thyroid, ultrasound scans, semen analysis and screening for infections and genetic conditions. These tests help doctors personalise the IVF treatment plan,” mentioned Dr. Kanchan Mala, gynaecologist Ghaziabad and Consultant at Gunjan IVF World – a leading IVF clinic in Indirapuram.

Understanding the IVF process: “At Gunjan IVF World – best IVF centre in Indirapuram, we explain the complete IVF process to patients. It starts with ovarian stimulation where hormonal injections are administered to produce multiple eggs. During the egg retrieval process, eggs are collected from ovaries through a minor procedure. Eggs are fertilised with sperm in the lab during the fertilisation phase post which a healthy embryo is transferred to the uterus. A pregnancy test is done after about 10-14 days to confirm pregnancy,” said Dr. Neha Verma, female gynecologist near you in Ghaziabad.

Know about success rates and expectations: The success of IVF depends on many factors like age of the couple, particularly the woman, egg and sperm quality, underlying fertility issues and lifestyle & overall health. Most importantly, couples should understand that IVF may take more than one cycle. Gunjan IVF World has an over 80% take home baby rate which means that couples who get treated at Gunjan IVF World take home a baby in 80% cases.

**How to prepare emotionally?**

“Being medically prepared is just one aspect of IVF treatment. One needs to prepare the body and mind as well. Being mentally prepared matters. At Gunjan IVF World, Ghaziabad, we always tell couples that IVF is an emotional journey too. Going through mood changes, anxiety issues and stress are very common. Another important factor is holding open communication as a couple. We encourage couples to openly speak about fears, expectations, finances and outcomes between themselves as they help in staying emotionally connected. Lastly, joining support groups can also prove beneficial. Many couples in Indirapuram can find it helpful to talk to fertility counsellors, join IVF support groups or lean on trusted family members or friends,” recommends Dr. Mayank Jain, best gynaecologist in Ghaziabad.

**How to take care of finances?**

IVF involves many steps. So, it is vital to know about the cost structure clearly. Ask the centre for treatment packages and enquire about additional procedures and medications. At Gunjan IVF World, Indirapuram, there is complete transparency and no hidden costs. Couples are informed at every stage of their treatment journey.

**Lifestyle modifications to make**

“For couples who are planning to start IVF treatment, we always recommend them to eat a balanced and nutritious diet. They are advised to maintain a healthy body weight, avoid smoking and drinking alcohol & excessive coffee. We also tell them to get adequate sleep and do mild to moderate exercises. Practicing yoga or meditation is also an important modification to integrate in the daily routine,” concluded Dr. Gunjan Gupta.",1,1769692970.0,u_Suitable_Minimum2038,0,1.0,False
1qq8exr,https://www.reddit.com/r/spainTravelRentals/comments/1qq8exr/i_rented_a_car_in_asturias_just_in_case_and_it/,I rented a car in Asturias “just in case” — and it completely changed my trip,"I almost didn’t rent a car in Asturias.

The original plan was trains, buses, and a lot of walking. On paper, it looked doable. In reality, that plan would’ve shown me maybe 30% of the region.

I landed at Asturias Airport on a cloudy afternoon, slightly jet-lagged, and decided last minute to grab a rental car right there ([rental car at Asturias Airport](https://rentaholliday.com/en/rent-a-car-spain/asturias-airport)). I told myself it was just a backup option. It ended up becoming the entire trip.

The first drive was already a surprise: within 30 minutes, the airport roads turned into rolling green hills, cows everywhere, mist hanging over the mountains. This didn’t feel like the Spain I thought I knew.

Over the next few days, the car quietly changed how I traveled:

* I’d see a random sign pointing to a beach and just… turn
* I’d drive into villages with maybe one bar and three locals staring at me
* When the weather turned bad on the coast, I’d head inland — when it rained in the mountains, I’d chase sun by the sea

Public transport would never allow that kind of improvisation.

I spent a few days in **Gijón**, returned the car near the train station when I wanted to slow down ([car rental in Gijón](https://rentaholliday.com/en/rent-a-car-spain/gijon)), then picked one up again later in **Avilés at the bus terminal** to explore places even less connected ([car rental in Avilés](https://rentaholliday.com/en/rent-a-car-spain/aviles)). That on-and-off flexibility made the trip feel effortless instead of rushed.

One afternoon stands out: I was driving along the coast with no destination, just following the road. I ended up at a tiny, almost empty beach, had coffee from a thermos, watched waves crash against cliffs — and realized I hadn’t checked my phone in hours. That moment alone justified the rental.

https://preview.redd.it/xspx3golhagg1.jpg?width=4160&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b1ac8cdc792113c2efb9d451a5c778c338a8e67a

A few honest takeaways:

* Asturias is *slow* in the best way — don’t plan tight schedules
* Roads are great, but mountain drives take time
* Weather changes fast; a car lets you adapt instead of cancel plans
* Without a car, you’ll miss the most memorable places

https://preview.redd.it/bt8vklcohagg1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=86a5a85d33eb9aabae3a2ff8bdc790c72092fe9e

Asturias doesn’t try to impress you instantly. It grows on you, quietly. And for me, that only happened because I had the freedom to drive wherever curiosity pulled me.

1qq8avt,https://www.reddit.com/r/DOAXVenusVacation/comments/1qq8avt/oc_ayane_between_our_silent_glances/,[OC] Ayane. Between Our Silent Glances.,"Recently, I had begun to settle into the rhythm of office life.

It had taken me a long time to find this job. In the beginning, everything felt overwhelming. Working as one of the few male employees in a company dominated by women required more tension than I had expected. Even small mistakes made me nervous, and many days passed in a blur.

Before I knew it, something began to feel different.

It felt as if someone was watching me.

Whether I was working or sitting absentmindedly at my desk, there were moments when I felt a strange sensation at the back of my head. At first, I dismissed it as imagination. Perhaps it was just routine supervision or an evaluation.

But as it kept happening, I found myself looking up without realizing it.

And naturally, I discovered whose gaze it was.

It was Ayane, my section chief.

During meetings, while organizing documents, our eyes would sometimes meet. Most of the time, she quickly looked away. But on certain days, her gaze lingered, as if she had something to say but could not bring herself to speak.

Ayane was beautiful, yet far from gentle in impression. Her words were direct, and she never wasted time on unnecessary explanations. At times, she seemed almost cold.

“Please check this part again. We can’t afford mistakes.”

[Images used in this work were created using AI.](https://preview.redd.it/zkxuf41tgagg1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=3208c290b82dba70a20eb4dfd23644c9cb6c8c62)

She always spoke like that.

At first, her comments felt heavy. I worried that she might not trust me. But as we worked together, I gradually understood.

She always focused on what mattered most. And behind her words was a quiet sense of responsibility.

She wanted me to do well.

Once I realized that, her criticism no longer felt harsh. It sounded more like careful guidance.

Before long, I had to admit that I was becoming aware of her as well.

There was no dramatic moment.

Just small things. The time she stood in front of my desk holding a cup of coffee, and I could not think of anything to say. The times we stood side by side in the elevator, speaking less than usual. Those ordinary scenes slowly accumulated in my heart.

Ayane was not good at hiding her emotions.

When she cared about something, she became more reserved. Her words grew shorter. Her eyes wandered. Sometimes she fidgeted with papers or stared at her monitor for no reason.

Those awkward gestures felt strangely honest, and I often found myself smiling quietly.

I do not know where our relationship will lead.

What I do know is that I do not dislike this delicate distance between us. Not too far, not too close. A space where we are aware of each other, yet hesitate to step forward.

I do not want to rush it.

Feelings do not need to reach conclusions quickly. Slowly growing emotions often last the longest.

Someday, she may speak first. Or perhaps I will find the courage. I do not know when that day will come, but I want to cherish this quiet flutter in my heart.

Ayane is more sensitive than she appears.

And I have come to like her.

I took it because I’m interested in finance and thought this would help me learn more about the industry or at least give me some exposure, as it’s very difficult to find an internship or job related to finance/economics without a relevant degree. But i’ve come to realize that i really hate recruiting.

The job is basically matching CVs to job descriptions, cold calling/message candidates for 9 hours straight, and then ghosting most of them. My boss also refuses to explain to me the roles he’s assigning me to find right now as he says it doesn’t matter and wants me to just find candidates according to the key words he has given me, even asking me not to waste time googling, leaving me to secretly ask my colleagues or google in the toilet in order to personally learn more about finance and its related jobs 

it’s only been two days, but i cried so much during lunch and when i got home because the job feels so mind numbing and pointless and i feel really bad about constantly messaging people, getting their hopes up only to end up ghosting them. i understand that this is the reality of things , but i really wanted to spend this time upskilling myself and learning more, and working in ideas and things that i truly believe in or find meaningful. Working in fast food when i was younger was also much more enjoyable because i felt that i was actually contributing to individuals happiness by eg making their coffee to the best of my ability. 

With that, is it valid to quit my internship after only 2 days? I’m open to any advice! Thanks ",0,1769692548.0,careeradvice,7,0.5,False

1qq88l5,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1qq88l5/im_way_too_excited_about_a_possible_dream_job_i/,I’m way too excited about a possible dream job. I even dreamed about it last night.,"Like a lot of people, I hate my current job. I dread Mondays, am disappointed when I realize it isn't Friday, and started job hunting in late December after some serious HR issues that left me feeling burned out and betrayed.

Two weeks ago, an internal recruiter from a major accounting firm reached out. I had a webcam interview that went great. This Tuesday, they called to schedule an inperson interview, which happened yesterday morning and honestly, it felt too perfect.

The role is exactly what I’ve been doing for five years, but with more responsibility, WAY better pay, a WAY stronger benefits package, two remote days, and support for further education.

The office is about 30 minutes from my house (an hour in traffic), and the interview lasted over an hour. The interviewer was very interested and has professional experience with the owner of the company I did my internship (he is currently well known on a private/public/political climate). At the end, he showed me around, grabbed coffee with me for like 20 minutes, mentioned there are two open roles they need to fill ASAP, and asked when I could start. He also assured me I’d hear back either way when I asked because I'm interviewing in other options and this is my first option. Way too honest, not sure if it was a good move from my part. Asked me when I could start, and told him that ideally two weeks after the confirmation so I could not abandon my current coworkers. 

I walked out feeling, no, knowing, like I crushed it. Like the world is mine. This is my new job. Last night I literally dreamt it was my first day there. Like seriously, who dreams about going to work. 

I usually keep my expectations low to avoid disappointment. A cool head. But this time I’m way too excited and terrified because of this opportunity. I haven't seem anything like this in Indeed. Either it is lower in the corporate hierarchy with better pay, or I'm unqualified for.  

I already have a resignation letter drafted for over a month, but I know nothing is guaranteed.

So yeah. I know I need to chill. Trying not to get overhyped, but it’s hard when everything feels like it lined up too perfectly.

Thanks for reading, and good luck to you in your professional and personal lives.

PS after I wrote the TLDR: My current work boss gave me a call and just annoyed the crap out of me. I have been here for 3 years severely underpaid. Only reason I stayed was because I liked the teamwork and ambiance. Even when HR gave me a shit offer for a raise that I rejected and they have been dragging their feet since June to contact me for either a counter offer or at least give me their first offer. It was .50 cents an hour. 

  
TL:DR Did the final interview for a near perfect job and it went great. I'm getting way to ahead of myself and last night, literally dreamt it was my first day. Really need to chill.

1qq86vg,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1qq86vg/i_feel_off_about_my_date/,I feel off about my date,"I (27M) have been seeing this girl (30F) for a couple months now. The way we began talking and got involved wasn’t necessarily a clean, or a completely genuine way of going about things—long story short for the prologue, she wanted to be spiteful/vindicitive towards her ex and she knew if he ever found out we were involved; it would upset him. This is not my issue, albeit I understand it is in itself, an issue. I have a preference to organic upbringings to relationships, so I stay away from disingenuous things like dating apps. I’ve been single since 2019 (barr 11 months, two years ago) for this reason.

With the context in mind of how I like my relationships, she is a bit different. She has been in a relationship, not necessarily with the same person, for the last \~7.5 years. She was living in another country with a long term partner for 5 years; moved back home after splitting with them and for the last 1.5 years has had 4 separate relation/situationships, and has gone on many dates with many people between these individuals. This fuels a bit of a fire in me that raises the alarm of, “I’m seeking genuine connection, but she just can’t be alone.” Wanting to be with someone and not wanting to be alone are not synonymous, and I believe she has intertwined the two when she is, at least to me, very obviously fearful of being alone more so than seeking what I am.

Into what I’m actually asking here: we are heavily involved, and basically on the brink of having a relationship. We have been regularly seeing each other (anywhere from 3-6 times a week), and it goes anywhere from just chatting on the couch, to physical intimacy, to sleeping in the same bed, it’s been great and feels genuine to me—but I do still tango with my implicit bias on how I perceive her intentions over the last year and a half with others, and now with me. But, the other day, she told me she wanted me to take her on a date. We have been out for drinks, to a coffee shop, and to dinner before. When I told her we’ve already been going on dates, she stated “those weren’t necessarily in a romantic capacity, I want you to take me on an actual date.” Okay, I can do that. But my bias is making me feel a certain way, and I don’t know why or how to remedy it. I’m already uncomfortable with the fact that she’s been rifling through people, under the guise of “trying to find what she’s looking for”. Now she states she found that with me, but I’m cautious by nature because I know how this ends for me, and for her. I’m broken, and she’s onto the next.

So, the idea of going on a date seems rather inconsequential because I feel disposable. Compounded by the fact that she’s just been on so many dates in a relatively recent timeline, there might be an unconscious fear of not meeting expectations that she has because she’s been “wowed” by these other individuals and I might not live up to that. I’m a simple guy, with complex emotions, but my idea of a date is dinner (partially because our community is very small and there are no other date ideas, trust me. I’ve been brainstorming for a week). So we’re basically only going to go out for dinner because I have no other ideas on what to do.. thoughts on this?

1qq86k7,https://www.reddit.com/r/IntrovertDating/comments/1qq86k7/seeking_where_is_the_aim_of_life/,seeking where is the aim of life ?,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

1qq82mz,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPNforFreedom/comments/1qq82mz/how_to_watch_docplay_from_anywhere/,How to Watch DocPlay from Anywhere,"Found the perfect documentary on DocPlay, clicked play, and got hit with a geo-restriction message? Yeah, I've been there. DocPlay's library of nearly 2,000 curated documentaries is locked to Australia, New Zealand, and the UK—which is frustrating if you're traveling or living elsewhere.

Here's the thing: a VPN makes this problem disappear in about two minutes. I've tested dozens of VPNs with DocPlay, and I'll show you exactly how to get streaming—no matter where you are.

✅ **Quick Answer**  
You need a VPN with Australian, New Zealand, or UK servers to access DocPlay from anywhere. NordVPN works best with 190+ fast Australian servers in five cities, strong encryption, and reliable streaming performance. Connect to a server in one of DocPlay's supported regions, log into your account, and start watching.

# Why DocPlay Blocks You (And How VPNs Fix It)

DocPlay uses geo-restrictions because of licensing agreements. Content distributors limit where documentaries can be shown, so DocPlay checks your IP address. If you're connecting from the US, Canada, or anywhere outside their three supported countries, you're blocked.

A VPN solves this by routing your connection through a server in Australia, New Zealand, or the UK. DocPlay sees an Australian IP address instead of your real location. The platform thinks you're browsing from Sydney or Melbourne—and lets you stream without issues.

**What you need:**

* A VPN subscription with servers in Australia, NZ, or UK
* An active DocPlay account (starts with a 14-day free trial)
* Internet speeds of at least 7 Mbps for HD streaming
* Compatible device (phone, tablet, computer, or smart TV)

💡 **Pro Tip**  
Australian servers give you the fastest speeds since most DocPlay's infrastructure is based there. I tested connections from the US, and Sydney servers consistently outperformed UK and New Zealand options by 20-30%.

# Best VPNs for Streaming DocPlay

Not all VPNs can unblock DocPlay. Many lack Australian servers, others get detected and blocked, and some are just too slow for HD streaming. I spent weeks testing VPNs with DocPlay to find which ones actually work.

Here's what you need: servers in the right locations, fast speeds (DocPlay streams in 1080p), strong encryption so your ISP can't throttle you, and a no-logs policy for privacy.

|VPN|Australian Servers|Speed|Price|Winner|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|NordVPN|190+ (5 cities)|900+ Mbps|$2.99/mo|🏆|
|Surfshark|40 (5 cities)|868 Mbps|$2.19/mo|🏆|
|ExpressVPN|Multiple locations|850+ Mbps|$6.67/mo||
|ProtonVPN|148+ servers|700+ Mbps|$3.49/mo||

# NordVPN: Best Overall for DocPlay

NordVPN dominates for streaming DocPlay because of server coverage and speed. They've got 190+ servers spread across five Australian cities—Adelaide, Brisbane, Sydney, Perth, and Melbourne. That means you're not fighting for bandwidth on overcrowded servers.

I ran speed tests from the US connecting to Sydney servers and consistently hit 900+ Mbps downloads using the NordLynx protocol. That's more than enough for DocPlay's HD streaming (you only need 7 Mbps). Even during Australian peak hours (7-10pm AEST), speeds stayed stable without buffering.

**What makes NordVPN stand out:**

* 190+ Australian servers prevent congestion
* NordLynx protocol delivers fastest speeds (built on WireGuard)
* Audited no-logs policy verified by Deloitte
* Threat Protection blocks ads and malware
* Works with Netflix, BBC iPlayer, and other streaming platforms
* 10 simultaneous connections
* 30-day money-back guarantee

The encryption is solid—AES-256 with perfect forward secrecy. I've used NordVPN for over two years, and it's never leaked my real IP or DNS requests. The kill switch works flawlessly; your connection drops if the VPN disconnects, protecting you from accidental exposure.

Downsides? The monthly plan is expensive ($13+), so commit to the annual plan to get pricing around $2.99-$3.79 per month. And occasionally I'll hit a slow server—but switching to a different Australian city fixes it immediately.

🎯 **Bottom Line**  
If you want reliable DocPlay streaming without buffering or connection drops, NordVPN is worth the investment. The server network alone makes it the top choice.

# Surfshark: Budget-Friendly Alternative

Surfshark offers excellent value at $2.19/month with unlimited simultaneous connections. That's huge if you've got multiple devices or want to share with family.

They've got 40 servers across five Australian cities using Nexus technology, which optimizes routing for faster speeds. I tested from California and averaged 868 Mbps on Sydney servers—plenty fast for HD streaming.

**Why Surfshark works:**

* Unlimited device connections (share with the whole household)
* IP Rotator changes your VPN IP every 5-10 minutes (harder for streaming services to detect)
* CleanWeb blocks ads and trackers
* Audited no-logs policy
* Works with Netflix, Disney+, Amazon Prime
* 30-day money-back guarantee

The IP Rotator feature is clever. Most VPNs give you one IP address that stays static during your session. Surfshark rotates it automatically, making it nearly impossible for DocPlay to flag you as a VPN user.

Surfshark's weaker point is torrenting speeds—about 3 minutes slower than NordVPN for a 5 GB file. But for streaming DocPlay? No issues whatsoever.

# ExpressVPN: Reliable But Pricey

ExpressVPN costs more ($6.67/month on the annual plan), but you're paying for stability and ease of use. The Lightway protocol connects fast, handles network switches smoothly, and maintains solid speeds even on spotty hotel WiFi.

I hit 850+ Mbps on Australian servers from Texas. Connection was rock solid—no drops, no buffering, no geo-restriction errors with DocPlay.

**ExpressVPN advantages:**

* Exceptional stability on unreliable networks
* 8 simultaneous connections (increased from 5)
* Superior customer support (24/7 live chat actually knows what they're doing)
* Works flawlessly with virtually all streaming platforms
* Split tunneling on all platforms
* 30-day money-back guarantee

If budget isn't a concern and you travel frequently (airports, hotels, coffee shops), ExpressVPN's network stability is unmatched. But for most people streaming from home, NordVPN or Surfshark delivers the same DocPlay access at half the price.

# ProtonVPN: Privacy-Focused Option

ProtonVPN brings Swiss privacy laws and 148+ Australian servers. They've been audited for their no-logs claims and operate entirely on RAM-only servers (nothing gets written to disk).

Speeds hit around 700+ Mbps on Australian servers—not quite as fast as NordVPN but more than adequate for streaming. What sets ProtonVPN apart is the advanced privacy features: Tor over VPN, Secure Core (multi-hop), and port forwarding for torrenting.

The free plan won't work for DocPlay (no Australian servers), but the paid plans start at $3.49/month. If privacy matters as much as streaming, ProtonVPN delivers both.

⚠️ **Warning**  
Avoid free VPNs for DocPlay. Most don't have Australian servers, and the ones that do are overcrowded and slow. Worse, many free VPNs log your data and sell it to advertisers. Not worth the security risk.

# Step-by-Step: How to Watch DocPlay from Anywhere

Accessing DocPlay takes about five minutes once you've got your VPN set up. Here's the exact process I follow:

# Step 1: Choose and Subscribe to a VPN

Pick one of the VPNs above (I recommend NordVPN for speed and server coverage). Sign up on their website—all of them offer 30-day money-back guarantees, so you're not stuck if it doesn't work.

The signup process is straightforward: enter your email, choose a plan length (longer = cheaper per month), and pay. You'll get a confirmation email with login credentials.

# Step 2: Download and Install the VPN App

Go to your VPN's download page and grab the app for your device:

* **Desktop:** Windows or Mac apps install like any other software
* **Mobile:** Download from App Store (iOS) or Google Play (Android)
* **Smart TV:** Some VPNs have apps for Android TV, Fire TV, or Apple TV. Otherwise, install on your router

Installation takes 2-3 minutes max. Open the app and log in with the credentials from Step 1.

# Step 3: Connect to an Australian Server

This is the crucial step. Open your VPN app and select a server location. For DocPlay, you need:

* **Australia** (fastest option, best for HD streaming)
* **New Zealand** (works but typically slower)
* **United Kingdom** (works but higher latency from most locations)

In NordVPN, I click on the Australia pin on the map or select a specific city from the sidebar (Sydney usually gives me the fastest speeds). Hit ""Connect"" and wait 10-20 seconds for the VPN to establish the connection.

The app will show ""Connected"" with a green indicator. Your IP address is now Australian.

💡 **Pro Tip**  
If one Australian city is slow, try another. I found Sydney and Melbourne consistently faster than Perth or Adelaide, but it depends on your actual location and network congestion.

# Step 4: Create or Log Into Your DocPlay Account

Head to docplay.com. If you don't have an account yet, sign up for the 14-day free trial. You'll need an email address and payment method (they won't charge you until the trial ends).

**DocPlay subscription details:**

* **Australia:** AU$9.99/month or AU$99.99/year
* **UK:** £2.99/month (significantly cheaper!)
* **Free trial:** 14 days, full catalog access
* **Streaming quality:** HD up to 1080p
* **Simultaneous streams:** 2 devices

If you already have an account, just log in. The site should load normally now that you're connecting through an Australian IP.

# Step 5: Start Streaming

That's it. Browse DocPlay's catalog of nearly 2,000 documentaries and hit play. The content should stream in HD without buffering (assuming your base internet speed is at least 7 Mbps).

I tested streaming multiple documentaries back-to-back, and playback was smooth on both my laptop and Chromecast. No lag, no quality drops, no random disconnections.

If DocPlay still shows a geo-restriction error:

1. Clear your browser cookies and cache
2. Disconnect and reconnect to a different Australian server
3. Try switching VPN protocols (OpenVPN TCP if you're using UDP)
4. Contact your VPN's support chat—they'll recommend specific servers

🔒 **Security Note**  
Keep your VPN kill switch enabled. If your VPN connection drops, the kill switch instantly blocks all internet traffic until the VPN reconnects. This prevents DocPlay from seeing your real IP address during connection hiccups.

# DocPlay's Content: What You're Getting Access To

DocPlay positions itself as a curated documentary streaming service, not a Netflix-style everything platform. The catalog focuses on quality over quantity—nearly 2,000 titles covering documentaries that actually matter.

**Content categories:**

* **True Crime:** Investigations, cold cases, criminal justice deep dives
* **Art & Culture:** Music documentaries, art history, cultural explorations
* **Science & Nature:** Climate change, wildlife, space exploration, technology
* **Sports:** Athlete profiles, extreme sports, sporting history
* **Politics & Society:** Social issues, activism, political movements
* **History:** War documentaries, historical events, biographies

DocPlay adds new titles weekly and has secured content deals with BBC Studios, PBS, ABC (Australian Broadcasting Corporation), and Arte. You'll find Academy Award winners, festival favorites, and exclusive titles you won't see on mainstream platforms.

Recent popular additions include ""No Other Land,"" ""Porcelain War,"" ""Black Box Diaries,"" and classics like ""20 Feet From Stardom"" and Louis Theroux's documentaries.

The platform streams in HD up to 1080p with no ads (unlike some streaming services that interrupt with commercials). You can stream on two devices simultaneously, so one person can watch on the TV while another streams on a tablet.

**Supported devices:**

* Web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
* iOS (iPhone and iPad)
* Android (phones and tablets)
* Smart TVs (select models)
* Chromecast and AirPlay
* Foxtel iQ boxes (app available)

⚡ **Performance Insight**  
DocPlay doesn't publish minimum speed requirements, but based on my testing, you need 7 Mbps for smooth 1080p streaming. An NBN 50 plan (50 Mbps download) handles it easily with bandwidth to spare. I had zero buffering issues on a 100 Mbps connection through NordVPN.

# Troubleshooting: When DocPlay Won't Work

I've run into a few issues while testing DocPlay with VPNs. Here's how to fix the most common problems:

# ""This content is not available in your region""

DocPlay detected your VPN. This happens when:

* Your VPN server is on DocPlay's blocklist
* You're using a VPN with limited server options
* WebRTC or DNS is leaking your real location

**Fix it:**

1. Switch to a different Australian server in your VPN
2. Clear browser cookies and cache (they store your location)
3. Run a DNS leak test at dnsleaktest.com—if it shows your ISP, your VPN is leaking
4. Enable your VPN's DNS protection (NordVPN calls it ""CyberSec"")
5. Try incognito/private browsing mode

# Slow Loading or Buffering

If DocPlay takes forever to load or buffers constantly, your VPN speeds are too slow.

**Fix it:**

1. Connect to a closer Australian server (Sydney or Melbourne usually fastest)
2. Switch VPN protocols—try NordLynx or WireGuard instead of OpenVPN
3. Close bandwidth-heavy apps (torrents, downloads, other streams)
4. Test your base internet speed without VPN—you need at least 7 Mbps
5. Try a different time of day (Australian peak hours can slow servers)

I found speed problems almost always came from connecting to overcrowded servers during Australian evening hours. Switching from a Brisbane server to Sydney fixed it immediately.

# VPN Keeps Disconnecting

Random disconnections ruin streaming and expose your real IP to DocPlay.

**Fix it:**

1. Enable the kill switch in your VPN settings (blocks traffic if VPN drops)
2. Switch from WiFi to ethernet (more stable connection)
3. Change VPN protocol—TCP is slower but more stable than UDP
4. Update your VPN app to the latest version
5. Disable IPv6 on your device (some VPNs don't support it properly)

# Can't Create a DocPlay Account

You're trying to sign up from outside Australia/NZ/UK without a VPN, or your VPN isn't working properly.

**Fix it:**

1. Connect to your VPN before visiting docplay.com
2. Use private/incognito browsing to avoid cookie tracking
3. Some users report success signing up from UK servers (cheaper pricing anyway!)
4. If all else fails, contact DocPlay support—they're aware people use VPNs and generally helpful

🔥 **Hot Take**  
DocPlay's geo-blocking is less aggressive than Netflix or BBC iPlayer. I rarely had to switch servers, and most Australian servers worked on the first try. But when you do hit a blocked server, switching to a different city fixes it 95% of the time.

# Is Using a VPN with DocPlay Legal?

Using a VPN is legal in Australia, New Zealand, the UK, the US, Canada, and most countries worldwide. You're not breaking any laws by encrypting your internet connection or changing your virtual location.

DocPlay's terms of service don't explicitly ban VPN use (I checked). They restrict access by region due to licensing agreements, but they don't prohibit circumventing those restrictions with technical tools.

**The reality:**

* VPNs are legal privacy tools
* Streaming services can't tell if you're using one (if your VPN is good)
* Thousands of people use VPNs to access DocPlay while traveling
* You won't get in legal trouble for watching documentaries with a VPN

That said, DocPlay could theoretically terminate your account if they detect VPN use and choose to enforce their geographic restrictions. In practice? I've been streaming with VPNs for years across multiple platforms, and I've never had an account closed.

**Where VPNs are restricted:** Some countries heavily restrict or ban VPN use—China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, UAE, and a few others. If you're in one of these locations, research local laws before using a VPN. But for DocPlay specifically (available in democratic countries with legal VPN use), you're fine.

💰 **Money-Saving Tip**  
DocPlay's UK pricing is £2.99/month compared to AU$9.99 in Australia. That's roughly $5.50 USD cheaper per month. If you're signing up fresh, connect through a UK VPN server and create your account there. You'll pay UK pricing going forward.

# VPN vs. Smart DNS vs. Proxy: What Works Best?

You've got three main options for bypassing geo-restrictions: VPNs, Smart DNS, and proxies. I've tested all three with DocPlay. Here's what actually works:

|Method|Speed|Security|DocPlay Success|Best For|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|VPN|Fast|High|95%+|Streaming + Privacy|
|Smart DNS|Fastest|None|60%|Speed-focused streaming|
|Proxy|Slow|Low|20%|Nothing (don't use)|

**VPN:** Encrypts all your traffic, changes your IP address, protects privacy. Works consistently with DocPlay and other streaming platforms. Slight speed reduction (5-15%) but imperceptible with quality providers like NordVPN.

**Smart DNS:** Changes your DNS servers to make it look like you're in another country. Doesn't encrypt traffic, so it's faster than a VPN. But many streaming services (including DocPlay) now detect Smart DNS and block it. Less reliable than VPNs.

**Proxy:** Routes your traffic through a server in another country but doesn't encrypt. Free proxies are slow, unreliable, and often leak your real IP. Paid proxies are just worse versions of VPNs. Skip them.

For DocPlay specifically, VPNs win. They're reliable, secure, and fast enough for HD streaming. Smart DNS might save you 50ms of latency, but you'll spend that time troubleshooting when it stops working.

# Watching DocPlay on Different Devices

DocPlay supports multiple devices, but VPN setup varies. Here's how to stream on each platform:

# Desktop (Windows/Mac)

Easiest option. Install your VPN app, connect to Australia, open your web browser, and visit docplay.com. Works perfectly in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge.

I prefer desktop viewing because VPN apps have the most features—quick server switching, kill switch controls, split tunneling if you need it.

# Mobile (iPhone/Android)

Download your VPN app from the App Store or Google Play. Connect to an Australian server, then open the DocPlay app or website in your mobile browser.

Both iOS and Android handle VPN connections smoothly. Battery drain is minimal with modern VPN protocols—I lost maybe 5-10% extra per hour of streaming.

# Smart TV (Android TV/Fire TV)

If your VPN offers a native smart TV app (NordVPN and Surfshark do), install it directly on your TV or Fire Stick. Connect to Australia, open the DocPlay app, and stream.

No native app? Install the VPN on your router instead. This protects all devices on your network, including smart TVs that don't support VPN apps.

# Chromecast/AirPlay

Chromecast and AirPlay don't support VPNs directly (they're streaming protocols, not full devices). You need to:

1. Connect your phone/computer to the VPN
2. Cast DocPlay from your phone/computer to the TV
3. The stream passes through your VPN-protected device

Alternatively, install the VPN on your router to cover everything.

# Game Consoles (PlayStation/Xbox)

Neither PlayStation nor Xbox has native VPN apps. Your options:

1. Install VPN on your router (covers console automatically)
2. Share VPN connection from your computer via ethernet or WiFi hotspot
3. Set up Smart DNS through your VPN provider (less secure but works)

Honestly? If you're watching DocPlay on a console, just cast from your phone. It's easier than router setups.

📌 **Key Takeaway**  
The simpler the device, the easier the VPN setup. Computers and phones take 2 minutes. Smart TVs and game consoles require router configuration or workarounds. If that sounds complicated, stick with casting from your phone or laptop.

# Comparing DocPlay to Other Documentary Platforms

DocPlay fills a specific niche. How does it stack up against other documentary streaming options?

|Platform|Monthly Price|Documentary Count|Geo-Restrictions|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|DocPlay|$9.99|\~2,000|AUS/NZ/UK only|
|Netflix|$10.99+|500+ (mixed with other content)|Region-based catalog|
|CuriosityStream|$2.99|3,000+|Global|
|PBS Documentaries|Free|1,000+|US only|
|Kanopy|Free (library card)|Thousands|US/UK/AUS libraries|

**DocPlay's advantages:**

* Curated selection (quality over quantity)
* Focus on independent and festival documentaries
* Australian and New Zealand content
* No ads at any tier
* Affordable compared to Netflix or Hulu

**DocPlay's weaknesses:**

* Smaller catalog than CuriosityStream
* Limited to three countries
* No 4K streaming (maxes at 1080p HD)
* Fewer big-budget productions than Netflix

If you love documentaries and want a curated experience, DocPlay delivers. But CuriosityStream offers more content for less money ($2.99/month globally). And Netflix has massive doc productions like *Tiger King* and *Our Planet* mixed into its general catalog.

For me, DocPlay is worth it if you're in Australia/NZ/UK or traveling there frequently. Outside those regions, CuriosityStream makes more sense unless you specifically want the indie documentaries DocPlay curates.

# Final Thoughts

DocPlay's geo-restrictions are annoying, but a VPN makes them irrelevant. I've streamed hundreds of hours through NordVPN's Australian servers without a single issue—fast speeds, zero buffering, no disconnections.

Here's my honest recommendation: grab NordVPN's annual plan ($2.99-$3.79/month), connect to a Sydney or Melbourne server, sign up for DocPlay's 14-day free trial, and test it yourself. If it works smoothly, commit to the service. If not, you're covered by NordVPN's 30-day money-back guarantee.

The combination of a quality VPN and DocPlay's curated documentary catalog? That's worth the $13-15/month combined cost if you're a documentary enthusiast.",1,1769692051.0,VPNforFreedom,0,1.0,False

Stayed at a riverside resort near Chikmagalur honestly didn’t expect this

Just got back from trip to Chikmagalur and wanted to share this here.

We booked a riverside resort because we wanted quiet, not sightseeing. No packed itinerary. Just nature. And it worked better than expected.

Mornings were the highlight. Woke up to mist everywhere and the sound of flowing water. Sat by the river with coffee for almost an hour doing nothing. No phone. That alone felt like a reset.

Traveling with family was usually tiring for me but this time it wasn’t my Kids spent most of their time near the water throwing stones and exploring. Parents actually relaxed instead of worrying about schedules. Evenings were calm. No loud music. Just cool air and conversation.

The place was called RiverMist Resorts. What I liked was that it didn’t feel overbuilt. Fewer rooms, more open space. Staffs were so helpful. Food was fresh and filling nothing fancy, but comforting after a long walk.

One small tip: reach before sunset if you’re driving. The last stretch is scenic but narrow.

If you’re looking for a peaceful riverside stay near Chikmagalur with family or as a couple this kind of place makes a big difference that's what I have experienced. Sometimes doing less is the whole point.

I took a year off for studies, things didn’t go as planned, I failed an exam, and I’m currently job hunting. I think anyone who’s been in a bad phase can understand the emotions that come with it.

A few days ago, my sister and I decided to go to the mall. It was my idea, and we also wanted to buy a gift for our 1-year-old niece. I went with my elder sister. On the way, she asked how we should go, and I said anything is fine. She suggested booking a cab, but I told her I was short on cash and couldn’t afford it. She said, “It was your idea, you should pay,” so we ended up taking the bus.

That day, I was actually in a good mood. I’d been watching food vlogs and really wanted to go out and eat—I hadn’t gone out in months and just wanted a small break from all the stress. But the day turned out to be really upsetting.

At the mall, we went shopping. we bought a gift for my niece, and she bought a top and i did  too. I politely told her I didn’t have enough money to pay for everything and asked if she could cover it. She refused and said I should pay. I ended up paying the bill for her too.

 For context, I’m the middle child—I have a younger brother and I’m younger than her. Whenever we go out, I usually end up paying. I’ve never really said no because I just want all of us to enjoy without fighting over money. I also avoid asking my mom for money because I feel guilty.

Later, we went to eat. I couldn’t afford to order much, so I just got a coffee. She ordered food, which we shared. She paid for the return trip.

What’s bothering me more is that back in January, it was her birthday. I know she was overwhelmed because many of her friends didn’t call her—which honestly is just adult life. She wanted to go out for dinner, and I even asked if I should book a restaurant. She decided to celebrate at home instead. I bought her a custom cake, balloons, helped with decorations, and even crocheted a scarf for her. Despite all that, she later said it was her worst birthday.

Mikael’s vocals are what really pull me in here…..the way he moves from those deep, controlled growls to almost fragile clean passages feels effortless, but it’s doing a lot of emotional work.

It’s heavy without being fatiguing…..one of those records that rewards sitting down and listening all the way through.

When you have status in a wolf pack then your life is set. You have privilege, you have pretty much everything you can ask for. I used to have that. Until my father, the head warrior, died protecting the Alpha and then all of a sudden we were nothing to the top pack leaders. 

My mother had never really had a job before. She met her mate when she was 18 and had me, which meant she stayed home with me and Dad was the worker. 

That was 5 years ago now. I still wonder how my mother managed to live through the death of her mate. 

She’s the strongest woman I know. Especially after having our house taken off of us, our car, our entire life taken away. 

We are now ranked lower than omega’s. My mother works endless dead-end jobs just to pay the overpriced bills that the Alpha has given us and to put food on the table. 

But I’ve noticed the decline in my mother since my father died. She doesn’t eat as much, she works too much, she doesn’t take care of herself, and the Alpha has since passed the reins on to his son who is just as ruthless and arrogant as he was as an Alpha. 

My mother just wants me to get out of this pack and find my own way in life. So I don’t have to suffer the same fate. 

I woke up one morning and I looked out the window from the couch that I was sleeping on and it was pouring down rain. It was going to be a really crappy day.

I rolled off the couch and stumbled to the kitchen to get a coffee when I saw some hand-picked flowers sitting in a vase and a note was sitting in front of them. 

Happy Birthday Morgan, 

I’m sorry I can’t be there to celebrate with you. But you have a good day. You’re finally 18. I can’t believe it. You’ve grown up so quick. I love you.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

*“Alright, you two, please sit down so I may begin the presentation.”*

*The briefing room wasn’t very large by default. It had a really comfortable floor matting, which was pleasant to walk around with my feet, and very few seats, with optional arms that could be used for support to hold something, like a holopen to mark answers in a holopad. Besides this being the room for our mission debriefings, this was also the place Jake used for my quick WSO training. Aside from all that, it was just a relatively plain white room. I’ve noted humans liked these for some reason for their office space, i wonder why?*

*Director Laupi was sitting behind a small table next to the holoboard up front, with Jake right beside them, and no one else around, since this meeting was for just me and Mariana. Since she wasn’t making the first move, I grabbed one of the seats on the east side of the room, across from Laupi. Mariana grabs a seat opposite to mine, on the west side.*

*Getting up, Laupi wastes no time in getting the holoboard on, revealing a slide with various details about the Excelsior. “A bit of backstory before we start. Before the federation came, the Yotul were in the middle of what humans call an ‘industrial revolution’. We didn't have any yet, but I was fascinated in creating the first flying machine.”*

*She pauses to catch her breath, and then continues. “When the federation arrived, I was fascinated with their technology, and quickly joined their efforts to learn more about it. I think i don’t need to tell you how brutal it was to me and our entire species, but i’ve… endured.”*

I always felt bad for the Yotul. I never properly knew one of them, until now at least, but seeing them harassed on the streets of Venlil Prime always felt wrong to me.

*“But with the federation, I ultimately earned knowledge that I would never be able to achieve even with three lifespans, which culminated into what I dubbed the ‘Phase Skimmer’ engine, which I will come back to later. I had everything ready: a functioning experiment, my notes on how to operate, all my research , and the data to prove that it actually worked. So, I showed it to the principal Kolshian who managed my university. That was terribly naive from me back when.”*

*She swings her tail to indicate resentment. “He laughed off at me because of my uplifting status, calling me nicknames and stupid and dumb, taking away everything I worked for too himself, which made him ultimately assign me to a junior position as engineer on some patrol ship.” She, using her side facing eyes, looks at me with anger, which scares me a little.*

*Jake, however, quickly comes to Laupi’s side. “Director, please don’t drift away from the main topic.” Mariana follows up with a quick cough.*

*“Right, of course, sorry.” She straights her posture. “Anyway, ever since the technocracy got its independence, they have assigned me to weapons research because of my previous work, but I've been secretly working on the Excelsior after my later research got stolen. It was not long ago until I was able to work on it officially, with Mariana defeating the herd masters in the battle of Tellis.”* 

*She looks at her, proud, but Mariana just stares at her. “Well, everything was almost officially ready. All me and my team needed to work out was how to remake the engine’s power source, which I thought would take about \[1 month\].”*

*“If it wasn’t for our contributions.” Jake takes over, pointing at one part of the slide. “As some may or may not have known, the black hole station we attacked a while ago was actually a kolshian research station, called Orqus. Before being sucked by the black hole, they transmitted a ton of data directly to Aafa.* 

*This data gave us many manufacturing ‘techniques’, as the kolshians themselves named it, that is allowing us to greatly speed up production of the fleet that we hope will end the war. And we didn’t even get all of the data!”*

*“And one of the pieces of data that we got was the current herd master fighter craft, called ‘Eeree’, that, thanks to a research agreement signed between the UN and the Technocracy, allowed us to view the data.” Laupi points at the image of the Excelsior. “As it turns out” She begins to giggle. “The kolshians took my engine and just turned it into a regular ship power generator. That’s why their hull is so exposed and why they can field and fire all those cannons and railguns simultaneously."" She begins thumping her tail, but stops. “Ahhhh, how fucking ironic.”*

*Before I can ask what the Phase Skimmer engine is, she straightens her researcher jacket, and stops me before I open my mouth. “Now, the engine itself and by extension, Excelsior.” She continues. “The Phase Skimmer engine is in it of itself both a power generator and a warp drive combined into one. Normally, these two are separated, being parts of the ship at large, but they need to work together in order for the fighter system to work.”*

Fighter system? Is she talking about things like flares and chaff?

*“When I was studying how FTL worked, I learned how an object's weight affected spacetime around an object, sublight speeds and how we used that for our warp drives. I then noticed how in order to activate the warp drive, you needed to divert power from other systems, like weapons and shields, which could leave you vulnerable if you needed to escape. So, I initially designed the engine to do just that, combine the two parts so it could be online even during initiation of subspace travel.* 

*And later on, as I found out, it would also increase the energy efficiency of the power generator side of the ship exponentially, allowing an eightfold increase in strength while retaining its original size. And although I succeeded, I ran into the problem with the design: the ship’s weight.*

*Simply put, the heavier a ship is, the less ‘stable’ the engine becomes. The less stable, the more likely it is to overheat itself up and blow up when initiating a warp sequence, not even entering subspace properly. In the tests I'm about to show you, I've concluded the most stable and safest application of the new engine was on shuttle and fighter sized vessels. Which leads me to the Excelsior.”*

*She moves the slide around, bringing an image of a schematic of what appears to be the Excelsior, pointing at various parts of it. “After my previous research was stolen, I've worked hard to recover what was lost and improve upon my original designs. I delved deeper into the stability issue, wanting to fix it in the next iteration, but I couldn't, as I found out it was an inherent design flaw. But, through it, I learned some unexpected quirks which I then put to the engine as features.* 

*Basically, when mounted on a shuttle or fighter sized vessel, as a side-effect of the said stability issue, you could reconfigure the warp drive part of the engine to do ‘micro’ warp jumps at any time you wanted, even in combat. You would go faster than light for a split second on where the vessel is pointed at, re-appearing some distance away from where you started the jump. Hence, I gave the engine a new name, which is also the ship system’s name, Phase Skimmer.”*

*“So, in short, and simplified, the Excelsior can essentially ‘dash’ a short to medium range in the direction it’s traveling at, while maintaining full combat efficiency before and after the dash.”*

WOW\*. I thought to myself.\* Now that I think about it, from an engineering stand point, that's probably why it has those four wings in the back: more stability for the fighter after each jump. I’ve seen some Venlil ships use those.

*She pushes her glasses near her eyes. “Also, just to be clear, this is not the same as using a warp engine at sublight speeds inside a civilized system to travel around more efficiently. While the Excelsior also has that as part of its standard ship protocol, like any shuttle or military ship, it does not activate the Phase Skimmer, since it’s not going at the appropriate speed.”*

*“So this is,* if *understood correctly, an Alcubierre drive with modern FTL sciences attached on steroids, right director?” Mariana looks closely at the screen. “The G force it must apply at each jump must be immense, and to do so frequently to use it effectively then…”*

*“Good observation, Mariana. While I don't know who this Alcubierre is, you're right about the latter. And because I was required to remove certain parts of the gravity manipulation of the Excelsior because of another limitation of the engine itself, It was one of the reasons I needed a capable pilot to fly the mark one, and only after you defeated the herd masters did the technocracy allow me to build the Excelsior accordingly. Also, I might add since we are on this subject, that the system can only dash as long as it doesn't overheat, but I've added safety precautions for that, so it shouldn't be a problem.“*

*“Oh, and before I forget, you’ll have full control over the system, Mariana,” Laupi adds.*

*“Can I have a copy of the schematics for later? I would like to analyse it for myself.”*

*“Of course.”*

*“...so, what now?” I ask curiously after that scientific exchange with Mariana and Laupi.*

*The Director's hindclaws scrape the floor, breaking the matting and making a terrible screech around the metal surface beneath it that forces me to cover my ears. She, on the other claw, makes an ear flick to indicate amusement. “This concludes the introduction part of the technical presentation, and now, we can go do hands-on-learning training. Since there are no simulations available, we’ll have to use the Excelsior itself, which shouldn't be much of a problem, coming from your past professions. After that, we can do live exercises. Follow me to the hangar.”*

**Memory Transcription Subject:** *Vollek, Apex 1 Weapon System Officer*

*Date \[standardized human time\]: January 6, 2137*

Aafa Listening Post | General Ratih: <<Apex 1 WSO Rational, this is General Ratih, testing radio, over.>>

Apex 1 WSO | Me: <<I’m hearing you clearly, General.>>

Aafa Listening Post | General Ratih: <<Good. Status of the bait?>>

I looked over my monitor, displaying all the current information of the fighter, even the human satellite attached by the umbilical cable on the back while we were in the middle of a FTL jump. The cable wasn’t flitching or wrangling out widely, being like a steel solid beam to our ship, firmly connected between the satellite and us. <<In perfect condition, no signs of detachment from the cable nor damage to the satellite.>>

Aafa Listening Post | General Ratih: <<Good. It is imperative that its systems function once you arrive on the border of the Aafa system. Otherwise, the patrols might suspect something is up.>>

Aafa Listening Post | That damned Yotul scientist: <<While we are here, how is the stability threshold of the engine holding up, Vollek? This is also crucial, otherwise…>>

I breathe a sign through my mask. <<Like you said back there before, because of the cable, it isn’t adding any weight to the fighter. And we are going to detach anyway once we get out of subspace. And to answer your question, it is at 78 percent, just like before we left.>>

Apex 1 WSO | Me: <<Also, can’t you monitor the status of the Excelsior over on the station? You made it a pretty big deal right before we left.>>

Aafa Listening Post | Laupi: <<It isn’t an instant feedback report back to us, so it’s nice to have confirmation from your side. You know how important this mission is to the entire war effort. Get serious.>>

*Oh I know it. But if you could take me seriously, that would be another matter entirely.*

Aafa Listening Post | General Ratih: <<Rational, how long until you arrive?>>

I look at one of my screens to the right. <<\[50 seconds\]>>

Aafa Listening Post | General Ratih: <<Ok, remember the briefing. Detach the bait as soon as you drop out of subspace, and its software will go online automatically. Aafa is infested with patrols because of the war, so go and immediately hide around the nearby gas giant’s ice rocks. And don’t forget to maintain radio silence, as it was agreed. Good luck.>>

*As if Mariana needs to be told to stay silent.*

With a thump, we drop off FTL and into normal space, directly on the outskirts of the heart of the federation, the Aafa system. On the upper left view of the cockpit, I could see the outermost gas giant of the system, a gray green leviathan, with its fantastic ice ring spinning in the black background of stars of space. Although it was beautiful to look at, we didn’t choose this specific location to start the mission out of randomness.

I begin to disconnect the cable from our fighter using my controls, retracting fully to the fighter. One of the main differences of the Excelsior’s WSO seat compared to the seat from the previous fighter we used was that this one fully made use of my side facing vision, unlike the previous one, with screens and dashboards on my sides to update me and change the status of the craft, with the controls occupying the rest of the space and the middle, which greatly increased my efficacy. This wasn’t out of the kindness of Laupi’s heart, however, as she ‘projected’ I would have become a lot more efficient for Mariana if these changes were made.

I finished the procedure to detach the cable, and surely enough, something began to happen. A massive radar ping appeared right behind us, the satellite, practically screaming to the entire system to be found. Without a word, Mariana began speeding us directly into the ice ring as fast as she could. I don’t know how fast this fighter was, but it was fast. Midway through the journey, the radar started to ping nearby subspace readings approaching the satellite: they were taking the decoy.

“Need to initiate a phase skim, otherwise we aren’t gonna make it.” She speaks through her mask, avoiding the radio. Looks like she saw the pings as well through her radar. “Embrace. 1, 2-”

I clutch my stomach in knots as fast as I could, ready for another one of these dashes. Without even a blink, the gas giant in front of us comes a lot closer to view, the lines of light going by us in less than a second, not having the time to process and I have barely the time to process the amount of forward momentum my chest and face are receiving. I looked down, a breath I didn't know I was holding came out. Wait no, that’s just the air in my lungs being pulled back. I began doing the breathing exercise Jake taught me during training yet again, squeezing my legs and my back, practically having memorised it by this point.

*I almost passed out in the first test of these Phase Skims back at base, if I didn't remember this exercise at the last \[second\]. These dashes are the first time ever that I'm feeling braced around Mariana’s fighter “maneuvers”, if they can even be called that, and although I'm getting used to it overtime, they are taking their tow.*

After feeling better and getting my breathing in order, I loosed and looked upwards again to see how close we were, or if we crashed into anything, losing the grip on my claw on my seat.

The gas giant was now right in front of us, practically covering the entire cockpit view. Surrounding us, the ice ring, with an untold number of ice rocks. I looked at my monitors, and they said that we were in the gas giant’s stationary orbit, and we were moving along with the ice ring itself. My radar, meanwhile, said we were right behind one of the ice rocks, moving along it in orbital resonance. It looks like while I was getting myself back together, Mariana parked us in a place clear enough to hide our heat signature, all as planned. How she is able to handle these ‘skims’ is beyond me.

The subspace pings finally approach the satellite, with dozens of normal pings replacing them, and our radio system springs online.

Aafa Kolshian Officer:  <<What is this? Some kind of metal ball? Is that what is causing the radar spikes all of the sudden?>>

Aafa Kolshian Captain: <<Hold up private. Might be some sort of predator trick by those terrans. Judging from experience, this design looks rather primitive, and my XOs are reporting really low subspace readings.>>

Aafa Kolshian Officer: <<Let me do the scan for you then, sir. My frigate is a newer model than yours.>>

It takes a few moments, but the private reports back. <<You’re right! My database identified this “thing” as an old terran satellite! From the scan, it looks like it’s relaying something using an FTL transmission directly into their solar system!>>

Aafa Kolshian Captain: <<That’s why it has such a big radar presence! The predators are trying to wiretap us! All railguns, aim at that probe and fire!>>

In a moment, the radar bursts with multiple readings of plasma fire, and afterwards, the satellite ping then disappears.

Aafa Kolshian Captain: <<Are the predators really this stupid? Private, how and where did that get here?>>

Aafa Kolshian Officer: <<It is strange, captain. The subspace readings are very small, probably because of its size? I also can’t detect where it came from because of it, since the trail has disappeared.>>

The comms go silent for a moment. <<I-I’m a-also detecting a very thin subspace trace nearby, almost going out. But that’s probably just a glitch, from that satellite, since we’ve all travelled together here in such a hurry, so probraly nothing!>>

Aafa Kolshian Captain: <<Do a wide scan, as far as the sensors allow it. Maybe there are predators, or more surprises hiding around here.>>

Aafa Kolshian Officer: <<They aren’t that insane, right?! Attacking Aafa right now, when their ally Dossur are still occupied?!>>

Aafa Kolshian Captain: <<Do you really believe their talk about empathy, private?>>

Aafa Kolshian Officer: <<No sir! I just…>>

Aafa Kolshian Captain: <<Predators aren’t rational like us. They are mindless beasts, even if they appear to be sapient. And after the Krakolt invasion of their planet, I expect any tricks from them now on. Do the scan, Private.>>

Aafa Kolshian Officer: <<...Of course, captain. It's just..all the stress recently. I’m sorry.>>

Aafa Kolshian Captain: <<Don’t be. You are just expressing your best prey qualities, what makes us better and different from them, but do not equate us on the same level as animals, or you might lose yourself.>>

If this wasn’t so important and not sounding the alarm wasn’t our top priority, I would have turned on the radio and screamed at both of them. That last bit of the conversation pissed me off, calling predators, humans and probably Gojids too, mindless beats incapable of empathy was such bullshit. Sure, some humans I've met aren’t the nicest, but everyone else agreed that these humans are also annoying and rude. What I would do to give a piece of my mind-

“Vollek.” Marianas calls me out from the cabin.

“Yes?” I responded.

“Turn off everything that isn’t the radio and the radar. Turn on your suit's emergency oxygen.”

I comply and immediately start working as fast as I could, giving that was almost trailing off a second ago. I don’t know what came over me, the heat emissions from the fighter all turned up will almost certainly give us out, even with that ice between us. The radio and the radar, however, with their minimal power requirements from the engine, should give us a low enough signature to pass by them. With a final click, I turn the life support off, darkening the cockpit.

Aafa Kolshian Officer: <<My radar technicians are starting the scan now. Should be done in a flick, sir. Wait a moment.>>

I relax my posture, and begin to see if my claws were sharp or dull enough. As a former engineer, these types of scans take a little while to complete, and with almost all of our systems dark, we’re practically safe, but there isn’t much to do. I begin doing a mockup of the breathing exercise, just in case we do another dash again.

But then something clicks in my head, after remembering what the kolshians said. Didn’t the destruction of the satellite basically prove General Jones theory? 

*The human woman with green eyes blinked at us. Her background is a plain gray, not giving me a clue to where she might be. “Good evening doctor. It’s great to see you. And of course, you to Ratih, Mariana, and Vollek.”*

*“Jones.” General Ratih replies. Mariana stays lip tight.*

*“You’re general jones, correct?” I inquired. It wasn’t surprising they knew who I was, given she was here to debrief us, but I had other questions. “I’m sorry, but I've looked your name in the UN website before you arrived, and it didn’t show any results. Why is that?”*

*She smirks for a second. “That’s because Jones isn’t my full and actual name. It’s a nickname just like yours, Rational. Also, we removed any mention of me on the version of the internet we send to the federation for both diplomatic and security purposes.”*

*“Oh.” I pause. “Why?”*

*“That’s another matter we’ll discuss another time. Right now, let's focus on the briefing.” She changes her focus to the Ratih. “General, start by explaining the current situation.”*

*Ratih goes to the front of the screen and of us. “As of right now, we have full access to the general federation internet and FTL information network. We know what they say and hear. Besides that, the UN is working overtime to infiltrate and compromise every system inside the federation, which ties to the next point.”*

*The screen Jones is being displayed flashes, revealing a map of the Aafa system. She takes over. “Thanks to Apex’s efforts at research station Orqus, we’ve learned a lot about the federation at its core.* 

*According to the recordings from your mission and the files you helped to recover, the federation is not actually led by the parliament on Aafa, but a shadow government co-led by both the Kolshians and the Farsul, called the Shadow Caste. Based on the FTL transmissions between the research station and their members, we believe both of their main bases of operation are in their home planets.”*

*I remember back at our last mission, and having so many questions about what was happening. One of them was why were only the Farsul and the Kolshian answering the hail? Sure they were two of the original founders of the federation, but the black hole itself wasn't also too far from the territory of Yulpa, and they are loyal subjects to the federation until the end. A secret society that controlled us? How? We had planetary governments separate from the federation, and although some were dictatorships and others were monarchies, there were a lot that were democratic, like the Venlil republic and the Gojid union, which I guess would be harder to control.*

Wait. That’s right, Cilaly reporting with Chief Nikonis. He did know an awful lot about who were predators before the federation arrived before our first contact. Maybe he is also part of this Shadow Caste?

*She continues. “After learning this information, we’ve tried to search more about them in the current infiltrated network we control. Unfortunately, we now know that besides being in a completely separate network from the rest of the federation, their most important defenses are also in this network, which are prime targets for us.”*

*Ratih applies the map to show several highlights. “While we won’t be able to hack into them to gain an advantage, Aafa in particular has several points of infrastructure we know nothing about, at least, as much as we would like.* 

*While Talsk had only a small flotilla to protect its system, which was shattered with the attack of the Arxur a while back, the Kolshians have, as far as we can gather, almost doubled the amount of military ships they have patrolling the system.* 

*If we want to attack Aafa soon, we need information about their strong points and their weak points to plan our strategy accordingly. Specifically, their three ‘supposed’ research stations on Caato, their asteroid field between it and Aafa, and Aafa’s moon. But most importantly, gather said information without alerting them, otherwise, they may change their strategy.”*

*“But how are we going to do that? And why we? If I remember correctly, you have stealth shuttles or frigates, one of them helped us at the research station.” I ask.*

*“Ratih, Doctor, please explain to them my package you brought with you.” Jones waves a hand at them.*

*“I’ll start.” The Yotul comes to front, a split of pride gleaming from her eyes and her ears wiggling to show content. “The satellite we towed here isn’t actually a normal satellite, but a bait. A toy. Since subspace warp jumps can be traced when entering and exiting a system, especially one as on high alert as Aafa’s, there is no way to enter safely, unless you stop one light year short of it and continue the journey at sublight speeds. Else, they would probably find you in the middle of your mission on a random patrol not long after. And even if you could, you couldn't directly stop on top of Aafa, since they had set up FTL disruptors all around the center of the system and near the planet.*

*You are going to release this dummy after you arrive, which will create a signal to quickly attract nearby patrols. The goal is making them think we are sending probes through Aafa with FTL engines, not you, and letting them think we are sending more through onto the system, allowing for you to more easily complete your objectives. There is also a secondary goal to this, depending on their response, which is-”*

*“Doctor, you know that information is classified.” Jones' eyes loom over Laupi, raising a finger over her. “You surmised well enough. With the flight plan me and Zhao planned for you, you will arrive near the system’s farthest planet, a gas giant with an ice field. Detach the probe immediately, and hide inside it. Let them take the bait. And afterwards, complete your objectives. Doctor?”*

*“Right. If the Gojid hasn’t noticed already, I've altered the Excelsior’s missile systems a little bit. As you both know, the weapons system’s it’s still in its infancy, with only an extremely limited number of low-yield high explosive missiles on its wings using the terran missile system from your previous aircraft, because of the wings necessary thinness.* 

*Still, as it is by design a 3D printer for missiles, the general gave me the necessary knowledge to temporarily convert it to 3D print a sizable spy satellite, which you will deliver at each location. Besides this, the shield breaker missiles and your installed plasma cannon are still untouched""*

*“There are going to be several points we want to target on the asteroid field, but for each planet, one satellite will be enough.” Ratih points to the map.*

*That’s a lot of information to take in, loads of details. I did notice before we got here that the payload for one of the missiles had changed, but I decided to keep it to myself, hoping they would answer it. I think I got the main points across, with the dummy satellite and our real, spy satellites, however, one question remains. “Still, why us?”*

*“Simple.” Jones smiled. “Laupi asked for it.”*

*“What?!”*

*The Yotul quickly pushed me in. “It is the perfect opportunity to benchmark the Excelsior in a real-life environment dangerous enough to test its strains without direct combat engagement. Once the Technocracy heard of the UN’s plans for this mission, I submitted Apex and the Excelsior to join, pointing out how the prototype was in a reliable state, and the benefits in comparison of those excuses of ‘stealth’ vessels.”*

*“But weren’t the tests and those drilling operations we did back at base already good enough?! We-”*

*“Laupi, I wanted to ask the same question: Why?” Mariana finally speaks, getting up from her chair.*

*The director is quite shocked by her pushback. She probably expected me to lash out, but not her. “Mariana, please, you're an exceptional aviator. It isn’t a suicide mission, nor it is my intention to send you into you, and with the plan-”*

*“Enough with the praising bullshit.” She closes her arms, looking over her. “I ain't a soldier, but I've been here long enough to know that shit can get out of control very quick, pretty fast even if everything is all in order. This isn’t like a project with a tight deadline where you can take coffee breaks. It’s like taking care of a conveyor belt that puts out live bombs randomly.”*

*“But-”*

*“No. You should know better than anyone that the methodology to gather data is only applicable as the circumstances you use to gather it. You’re putting both of us in very serious danger, Laupi, even bigger than Tellis.” She sighs. “I should have known something was up.”*

*“And then there is you.” She turns to face Jones on the screen, gleaming at her with slated eyebrows. Mariana continues. “As soon as we departed from the Mistral, Jake was placed as second in command, as per protocol. But when we arrived here, I received word that he got orders from higher in the chain of command to move to Talsk. I don’t suppose you have a hand with any of this?”*

*“While it was me that requested this change, as you deduced, it was with general Zhao’s review and approval, Mariana.” Jones stated.*

*“I made my point clear with Zhao that Apex isn’t going to be part of any planetary invasion! Their defenses have been destroyed by the Arxur, like Ratih said, you can slip any number of your ships inside, so why do you need Farzam and Michel for exactly? Conventionally when I'm away from them?”*

*“First, understand that not only us, Mariana, but our allies, different species that support humanity, are fighting a war of total annihilation. Apex squadron is a military fighting force, not a charity. We need to use every resource available to us, otherwise, who knows how many more will die. We can’t simply not use our best aces because their leader has a grudge against it. The needs of the few can’t outweigh the needs of the many.”*

*While I somewhat agree with Jones, I've never seen Mariana this mad before. I would be too, if she called me out like that on me. She continues. “Answering your question, your squadron has been called to…deliver some submarines to Talsk’s oceans. Your fighters have enough weight capacity to transport them safely through the planet’s atmosphere, without alerting their PDF.”*

*“Submarines.” Mariana stops for a moment, putting a hand on her temple and sighing. “Afterwards?”*

*“They will leave the system. Apex is simply being called as cargo haulers, not part of an invasion force.”*

*She looks at the screen with jaded eyes. “Ok, that’s all I have to say.” She gets back to sitting, sighing as she puts both of her hands on her forward facing vision.*

I feel pity towards her. My gut is telling me I should do something, but I think it is best to leave it quiet for now.

*Ratih adjusts herself. “To conclude, since Captain Laguna is unavailable, both me and the director are going to remain on this station to guide you throughout your mission. It is a nearly built, but highly advanced listening post that is going to be used to monitor the satellites you deploy after your mission ends.* 

*Because of the amount of security inside the system, and to not potentially disturb the kolshians, radio silence will be required between both of us, and only broken when absolutely necessary. With that, you are both dismissed, Mariana, Vollek.”*

*Turning back, the Ratih stares at Jones right in her eyes. Jones gives a half smile. “I need to attend to other matters as well. Good luck on your mission, Apex.”*

*The screen then flicks back to the one that was there before the call began. There was a lot of stuff I needed to think over, but I could do that after the mission was over, since director Laupi would just yap my ear off my own thoughts, probably calling me lazy or some xenophobic slur. I get up, ready to start going to the airlock.*

*“Ratih.” Mariana calls the general, who turns to them. “What is that secondary objective Laupi spoke about?”*

*Laupi, who herself looks at Mariana after her name is mentioned, looks at the general afterwards. They both look at each other for a moment.* 

*“Sorry, like Jones said, that information is classified.” Ratih reverberates.*

*Ratih then puts her left hand on her mouth and coughs, and then motions to the microphone attached by a thin cable. She then also grabs her holopad, a finger in the camera and microphone speaker, shaking it around like it meant something. Is this some sort of tail or ear language humans use? Because I don't get it.*

*Mariana however, seems to get what she is saying. Ratih then points to one of the drawers below the computer screen’s desk, which she opens to reveal it’s fully matted with some kind of fur? Whatever it is, it gets both Mariana’s and Laupi’s attention.*

*Without saying a word, Mariana gets her holopad out of the flight suit’s pocket, and Laupi gets hers out of her pouch, while the general disconnects the cable. They all put their pads in the drawer.*

*“I’m confused. What is going on?” I question.*

*“Give me that.” Suddenly, Laupi jumps near me, using her dexterous legs to quickly pounce and grabs my own holopad sticking out of my suit’s pocket.*

*“What the hell!” I shout at her as she puts my own holopad at the drawer, and the general closes it.*

*Ratih lets out a big breath. “It is good when your country is in charge of building these stations, because you know where they put the soundproof and faraday cage drawer Jones ordered for them, for ‘sensitive materials’. Hm.”*

*“What?!” I shouted.*

*“Oh, so she is also spying on us, General Ratih?” Director Laupi twists her ears.*

*“Correct. On all of us.” Ratih affirms. “Although telling you this is technically subversion of authority and can be classified as treason, don't mention this to anyone or talk about it afterwards, at least, away from any piece of technology with a microphone attached.”*

*“Shit.” Mariana whispers, me barely hearing it.*

*“I’m only doing this because of what you did for my nation and my family, Mariana. Among the people you saved on the federation incursion on Earth, my wife and son were among them.”*

*“She did what?!” I shouted again.*

*“General, please, just answer my question.”*

*“Right, sorry.” She shakes her head. “Recently, we’ve found several space probes at the edge of Alpha Centauri, which, as you might be aware, is our primary military research and manufacturing complex for the war. They were highly sophisticated, as when we found them, none of our attempts to remotely take control of it worked, and when we tried to approach one to directly connect to it, it scrubbed both itself and all other probes around the system simultaneously.”*

*“When we hauled it back and analyzed it, we found some pretty disturbing things. For one, it was a piece of technology that didn’t resemble those made by the dominion or the federation. It was different. And second, they had been there for what we believe to be around a month, and during that time, it had been transmitting information secretly between several proxies using federation and dominion credentials. What information it was transmitting, or if they even hacked us is unknown, and that has got the higher military staff spooked, and Jones surprised.”*

*Mariana rocks back her head. “So the dummy probe we are bringing along is to see if the federation is responsible?”*

*“Correct.” Laupi nods. Did she make a human gesture? “She firmly believes that either of them are responsible. She has several theories, but the one she is testing right now is revolving their response to a similar foray. Basically to see if the incursion on Alpha Centauri was a calculated move by the general faction. Since this shadow caste also probably controls the kolshian government as well, they probably control its military in the system, and have its officers all around it.”*

*Laupi lushes back her tail. “When they come to investigate the probe, and depending on their response to it, which we will be watching, we will see if it was all a plan by this shadow caste. Probably. As for the dominion side, it is currently not our problem, as Jones is looking over that..”*

*So much stuff to go over. Spying, more satellites, but what I'm focused on is that I now have another piece of Mariana’s past. If I remember correctly, Earth still has nation states, primitive tribe-like societal structures that predate an actual species government, according to what my mom taught me. And she saved one of them? So many questions, no answers.*

*Mariana sighs. “Great. Fucking amazing.”*

*“That’s the general mood around us as well, but don’t worry, I think the dummy probe will give you safe entrance through the system. Now remember, don’t tell what we just said to anyone else. Let me get your pads back.” She scurried to the closed drawer, opening it. “Oh, I almost forgot! Vollek?”*

*“O-oh yeah, that’s my name, yes.” I said, jumping in surprise as I was zoned out listening to them, and trying to process all the other information at the same time.*

*She gets the holopad on the top, and since I was the last one to give it, she intuitively gives it to me. “Your father's name is Savvek, right?”*

*“Yes, how did you know?”*

*""Ever since the attack on the Arxur farms, I had been placed in charge of handling the cattle rescues on Khoa along with the Mazic. Recently, he came to my office, asked all about you and your squadron, practically bossing over the Mazic. We had a good talk, discussing his military career before leaving Solvin. He grabbed an old friend of his, a Thafki, before leaving.”*

*I chuckled, chewing a claw out of slight embarrassment. “I hope he didn't call you a predator.”*

*“He did, but it will be a little while before that goes away. He said he was proud of your new job and the man that you are becoming.”*

*I flip my ear in contentment. It’s been a little while since we have spoken, but it’s great to know he is still sure what I'm doing is best. In the corner of my prey's vision, curiously, I see Laupi, dead silent watching us, completely motionless like stone. That 's strange.*

*As the general grabs another holopad, she notices Laupi. “Hm, Director? Are you shaking? Is something wrong?”*

*“N-n-nothing!” She stutters, drifting awkwardly backwards with her hands on her pouch. “What is there to be wrong about? Haha. I don’t have any!”*

*I twist my head. “Are you ok-”*

*“Just grab the stupid pads and go! The quicker you do this mission, the better!”*

1qq7pds,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_amzonestepusa/comments/1qq7pds/what_are_some_amazon_fba_moneymaking_techniques/,What Are Some Amazon FBA Money-Making Techniques In 2024?,"Many of you have probably shopped on Amazon at some point. An online marketplace for nearly anything has grown out of what was once an online bookstore. Things like diapers, denim, and desk lamps. With a single click, you can access anything you can imagine.

Nowadays, the tech disruptor isn’t limited to the retail industry. By offering a wide range of services and products, Amazon continues to expand the number of ways in which individuals can earn money. 

There’s no cookie-cutter approach. Stable employment, careers, side hustles, and software are all on offer at Amazon. Multiple individuals are finding success on Amazon, and this post will show you how to join them. How about we figure out a hustle that suits you? 

# Retail Arbitrage

Sure, you can join the ranks of those who sell on Amazon. One must master the art of “retail arbitrage” to determine which products have the biggest profit margins. The process is as easy as purchasing brand-new goods and then selling them for a premium.

For their first few sales, many Amazon sellers scour local businesses for discount products. It may be anything as basic as baby supplies, tea, or hair wash.

To help Amazon sellers scan barcodes, there is a specialized app. Find out the precise price of an item on Amazon and the commission you can earn with this tool. 

# Sign Up to Be an Amazon Influencer 

As an affiliate with **Amazon FBA,** you can participate in their Amazon Influencer Program and open your very own online store selling the things you’re passionate about. 

Additionally, you have the option to make product review videos that may be embedded in Amazon product listings. If someone purchases by watching your video, you will earn a commission. The term for this is “Onsite Commissions,” and it calls for its kind of clearance.

Popular YouTubers, Instagrammers, and TikTok influencers are cashing in on this Amazon strategy by directing their followers to buy the things they promote. 

You may get accepted without a huge following, which is the nicest part. If you only have a few hundred followers, you can still get accepted. 

If you want to apply to the program through Instagram or Facebook, you need to have a business or creator account. However, if you want to register through TikTok or YouTube, you can use any of your accounts.



# Sell Wholesale Goods

When you shop wholesale, you’re usually placing large purchases of products from popular companies. You will then be able to make [amazon FBA profits](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/7-expert-tips-to-maximize-amazon-fba-profits-and-cashflow/) by reselling the product separately. You may encounter stiff competition in the marketplace because other vendors can also do this. 

You won’t need to scour the market for deeply discounted items, as with retail arbitrage. To get the finest deal, you might instead reach out to well-established merchants in the field. There are two primary areas to consider when thinking about sales extremes:

* Opt for a product that has a lower profile, so there is less chance of rivalry.
* Opt for a well-selling product that faces stiff competition.

Using the same method of analysis as online arbitrage, you can locate a product with high profit potential. If you want to be a successful seller, research is key.

# Make Money by Selling Other People’s Products (Dropshipping

The term “dropshipping” describes the practice of selling goods handled by other parties. In this model, the “true seller” is responsible for storage and shipment, while you are in charge of selling and marketing the product.

The requirement to split the majority of your profit with these merchants is the biggest drawback of dropshipping. Keeping this in mind will guide your investigation into potential profit margins.

Supplier quality necessitates further investigation. Be careful to read the supplier’s feedback before working with them; as the listing owner, you will be more affected by the sale of low-quality goods than the provider.

Amazon Dropshipping can be an attractive career for those who are good at marketing. Still, to be sure you’re finding the right products, it’s a good idea to repeat the methods from our online arbitrage section.

# Fulfillment By Amazon (FBA)

Another option is to sign up for Fulfillment by Amazon, or “FBA,” once you begin selling regular inventory. While FBA is quite similar to the selling account described before, the main difference is that instead of delivering directly to customers, you send them to Amazon’s fulfillment centers.

The fact that Amazon handles customer service and returns in-house is one potential bonus. If you’re a third-party seller on eBay or Alibaba, you can take advantage of FBA to give yourself an edge. On the other hand, Amazon’s fulfillment services are designed for sellers who deal in bulk and have a constantly shifting inventory. If you’re a startup owner wondering if the additional fees are worth it, go over the **Amazon FBA** Fee Information page. They even have a handy tool that can calculate your expenses!

# Sell Handmade Products (Amazon Handmade)

Exactly as the name suggests, all of the [**Amazon product photography**](https://www.amzonestep.com/services/amazon-product-photography) in the Amazon Handmade category are crafted by hand. Items in this category are seen as having superior quality because of this.

A little over 20% of shoppers say that things have more of an impact when they symbolize something special to them. What this means is that handmade products provide a great chance to promote your business. Remember these things if you’re thinking about joining the handmade marketplace:

* Determine your target profit margin as a percentage of the time and resources invested in producing the product.
* Crafted products have a premium price tag due to the distinct impression of superior quality they evoke.
* Look into selling Amazon products through local vendors or on platforms like Facebook Marketplace.
* Look to social media platforms like Pinterest for ideas.

# Create and Sell Merch with Amazon

All **Amazon FBA** sellers use Merch By Amazon, a print-on-demand service. People who want to promote branded products or showcase their artistic abilities often use “merch” as a platform. Therefore, Merch is a great platform to use if you wish to sell your creations.

There is no product on Merch, similar to drop shipping. It is an Amazon platform. Making sales doesn’t require physical contact with a t-shirt or coffee mug. More information for those interested in print-on-demand products is provided below:

* Think about opening a merch store off-site and exploring other print-on-demand options.
* Get your artwork on more products (such as t-shirts, coffee mugs, stationery, etc.) where it will do the most good.
* Consider how you might provide your products with a unique benefit at all times.
* To build an audience, use social media to showcase your one-of-a-kind artwork and personality.
* Because print-on-demand services can eat up a significant portion of prospective earnings, you should pay close attention to them.
* Tees are a go-to for many print-on-demand vendors because they offer a large surface area for their designs to shine. Think about other reasonable mediums as well, such as sweaters or hoodies.

Consider Amazon’s cut very carefully, just like you would when dropshipping. This is a great place for anyone with a flair for marketing, because of this.

# Sell Old Stuff On Amazon

There is a healthy secondary market for secondhand goods on Amazon. A one-of-a-kind method to purge your home of precious possessions is available on Amazon. 

If you want to know how Amazon works, starting with “used” is a good place to start. This is why a lot of vendors begin by peddling pre-owned goods.

To start, search the packaging for the product code; if you cannot locate the product packaging, check the item itself for a serial number. If the used goods are already listed on **Amazon FBA**, you can avoid creating a new listing by checking this. Selling pre-owned items? Here are a few more things to keep in mind:

* Do not sell broken or otherwise damaged used things. Keep an eye out for the descriptions of the various use levels.
* Determine how much an antique or rare item could fetch in a collector’s market.
* Using Amazon’s specifications as a guide, snap some professional-grade photos of the item.
* To “try-out” selling, all you have to do is sell your unwanted possessions. This strategy isn’t meant to be your main source of revenue, though. Once you start selling just used items, you will eventually run out of inventory.
* Think about what is needed to sell rare items on Amazon in the collectibles section. There are stringent criteria to become a seller of some pre-owned products.

# Trade-Ins

Modern technology advances at a dizzying rate. You likely have a jumble of outdated electronics, including phones, tablets, and more, stashed away in a forgotten drawer. 

You may get credit for thousands of products, including phones, video games, and electronics, through Amazon’s extensive Trade-In program.

Send your item in, and Amazon will give you an instant offer based on its condition and make. Plus, they’ll even pay for delivery. Your old phone may not be getting cash, but at least you’ll get an Amazon gift card instead of just sitting there collecting dust.

# Use Kindle Direct Publishing to Sell Books

One self-publishing technique that eliminates the need for a publishing house’s permission is Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP). Aspiring authors can get their work published on Amazon without requiring approval, making it easy to get started. 

Anyone who has ever sent in a finished manuscript for consideration knows the feeling of receiving a letter of rejection. You may rest assured that this rejection will not affect your book’s quality rating on Amazon. 

No matter how simple it is, you should never submit a book without first giving it a thorough edit. Even when you self-publish, you can keep your work at a high standard by editing carefully and completely. 

When deciding to publish your book, keep these things in mind:

* Before you start brainstorming topics for your book, see what people are searching for on different social media platforms.
* The number of pages needed to answer brief, direct inquiries is minimal (often less than 100) without sacrificing the value you offer to visitors.
* Streamlining your operations is possible with the help of eBook sales.
* Highlight areas where you possess first-hand knowledge. Since this is an opportunity for you to share your point of view, the book will have a more personal feel.

# Make an Audiobook with ACX

With Amazon’s Audiobook Publishing Service (ACX), authors can easily reach a wider audience after they’ve written a book. Recording your book or selecting a narrator are both options available on this platform.

After that, individuals will be able to access your book on iTunes, Amazon, and Audible. Depending on the distribution method you choose, your audiobook earnings could range from 25% to 40%.

One guaranteed way to make money off of your material is to take advantage of the growing popularity of streaming and audiobooks.

# Narrate Audiobooks with ACX

ACX also gives voice actors a place to try out and record audiobooks. Using their Audiobook app, you may record audio samples of your voice and build a profile.

Authors will extend offers to those who demonstrate the most promise after an audition in which they record a brief excerpt from a work of their choosing.

Earnings can take the form of an hourly wage or a percentage of the author’s gross sales. Another service ACX offers is guidance on how to locate a suitable studio or other professional recording space.

Being able to record from an almost endless amount of books makes ACX a fantastic way to get into the voiceover and acting industries.

# Amazon Services

Selling your services through Amazon can be as easy as using Amazon Services. Your name can be seen here by plumbers, contractors, and furniture assemblers alike. 

With Amazon, you may expect to see a 20% cut in your earnings. So, before you decide to employ this service, you could want to calculate your profit margins or add a markup to the rates to cover the difference. The advertising budget usually falls far short of this threshold.

Although more visibility is always a plus, it doesn’t guarantee you’ll attract any buyers. There are places where Amazon Services is unpopular. However, there is zero danger to [FBA business](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/expand-your-fba-business-into-international-markets/) owners when they create an account and list themselves.

A few of the many services offered by Amazon include plumbing, home theater setup, grill assembly, bed assembly, water heater consultations, furniture assembly, outdoor equipment assembly, water heater installation, and more. 

# Become an Amazon Vine Reviewer 

Vine is an invite-only platform on Amazon that offers free products in return for reviews. In exchange for their time and effort in providing reviews, program members receive products rather than traditional compensation.

Due to the lack of compensation for Vine reviewers, this work cannot be relied upon as a main source of revenue. Whatever the case may be, you are free to resell the freebies you receive. 

So, writing Amazon reviews for money isn’t an option. Even if you could, Amazon would never pay you to write reviews—something they strongly dislike.

Contribute reviews to the Amazon Vine community. Amazon chooses Vine members at random, but they usually pick people based on how many helpful, intelligent reviews they leave.

You can’t just “apply to Vine” like other programs because it’s entirely random. This program is best categorized as “if it happens, it happens” given this.

# Work Remotely as an Amazon Representative

Join the Amazon team if you’re looking for a customer-facing career. These representatives, who are frequently referred to as “Amazon associates,” form the very core of Amazon’s customer support team. For those interested in working remotely for Amazon, this position is for you.

Every concern about third-party products is also handled by associates, in addition to Amazon’s product categories. Becoming a representative may help you understand the most typical customer care concerns, which is helpful if you want to be an FBA seller.

If you’re looking for a way to cut costs on petrol and other transportation costs, consider applying for one of these remote jobs. Many of these individuals also work remotely. 

* Having completed 10th grade
* Skills in technology, particularly Windows products
* Impressive communication and customer service abilities
* Methods for tackling issues (as shown by Amazon’s work style evaluations)

While working from home can help you [save money](https://money.howstuffworks.com/personal-finance/budgeting/10-easy-ways-to-save-money.htm?srch_tag=fwmgtlzr3dfdhlfsfzurag3njy73fjd7), it’s important to prioritize your health! Staying indoors for too long could be rather overwhelming. 

# Do Seasonal Warehousing Work 

**Amazon creatives** bring on more fulfillment associates during busy times (like the holidays) to handle the influx of orders. One option to help alleviate financial hardship is to apply for a job at a local fulfillment center.

Amazon CamperForce is one such innovative strategy; it caters to nomadic RVers. Project durations might range from six to twelve weeks. During that time, you must reside in a recreational vehicle and camp out at an RV park or campground. You have the option to get employed full-time if you enjoy and excel at your career. 

# Perform Outsourcing Tasks (Mechanical Turk)

Anything that Amazon contracts out to other parties is considered an outsourcing task. The Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) platform offers a wide variety of jobs. 

An outsourced group of people called Amazon Mechanical Turk (or MTurk) are hired to do specialized and (apparently) boring activities. Task requesters usually have information gathering in mind. When Amazon uses this data, they can better decide on new designs or choose the finest [**listing images.**](https://www.amzonestep.com/services/amazon-listing-optimization)

Visit the website of Amazon Mechanical Turk to register. Certain typical tasks include:

* Boosting classification through classification
* Picking the best product image
* Locating things in satellite images
* Filtering out irrelevant or duplicate entries (such as in Amazon reviews)
* Grouping information into a comprehensible format

Mechanical Turk is known for its low-paying members. You can’t make ends meet with the minimum wage of one penny.

How difficult is MTurk to use? Yes, but that’s also why there is such a low salary in the task-based employment market. However, other people receive higher wages. People with a lot of experience using Mechanical Turk are called “Masters” of the platform. These groups earn above-average amounts because they are more dedicated to MTurk. Therefore, more significant jobs are entrusted to them.

You can understand the low rewards on MTurk because the assignments are typically very short. So, to maximize your earnings from MTurk, it’s recommended to continuously perform multiple activities. You can earn a little bit of money if you put in enough time, but there are better options out there.

# Move Products at an Amazon Warehouse

The hub of activity is the Amazon Warehouse. There seems to be a warehouse coming up everywhere due to Amazon’s cross-country demand and incredibly large inventory.

There is no room in this industry for cowards. Getting [**Amazon product photography**](https://www.amzonestep.com/services/amazon-product-photography) done often involves more strenuous physical labor. 

You should just be 18 years old and possess a high school diploma (or its equivalent) to apply if you believe this type of work fits your skill set. Depending on your location, Amazon’s $15/hour minimum pay can be quite a bit of money.

# Take Advantage of Credit Card Perks

Using your Amazon Rewards credit card to its full potential is the quickest and easiest way to rack up Amazon income. With [Amazon Prime](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradadgate/2024/01/11/amazon-prime-video-is-launching-ad-supported-tier-later-this-month/), their credit card, you can earn three percent back on everything you buy on Amazon. In addition, if you are an Amazon Prime member, you will receive an additional 5% cashback.

You shouldn’t start stuffing your cart to earn cash rewards just because of this. People carrying credit card debt are something we hope to never see.

If you’re anything like me, though, you can’t get Amazon for both everyday needs and last-minute presents without a Prime subscription. An easy way to sweeten any offer is to get 5% cashback.

I don’t have TG. So don’t ask.

I’ve always believed that the most interesting things are never obvious at first glance. I’m the kind of person you don’t fully understand in one conversation—maybe not even in three. I listen more than I speak, but when I do, my words tend to linger longer than expected.

I’m drawn to people who think deeply, feel honestly, and move with intention. Small talk bores me, but conversations that wander into dreams, fears, and quiet truths? Those are my favorite. I find beauty in subtle gestures, in pauses between sentences, in the way someone looks at you when they’re trying not to fall—but slowly are.

I’m soft, but not fragile. Warm, but not naive. Romantic, but not reckless. I value emotional intelligence, kindness with backbone, and minds that can challenge mine without trying to overpower it. If you’re someone who knows how to be gentle without being weak, confident without being arrogant, and mysterious without being distant, we might understand each other in ways that are hard to explain.

I don’t rush connections. I like letting things unfold naturally—like stories you don’t skip to the ending because the journey itself is the point. I’m not here for temporary thrills or empty conversations. I’m here for something rare: chemistry that feels calm, attraction that feels safe, and a connection that feels inevitable.

Looks are just a plus—but I’m really looking for someone who can match my freak. My humor is very kanal, and I have a soft spot for cats, matcha, coffee, museums, the beach, gore movies, sci-fi films, thrillers, and murder docu-series. I have tattoos and piercings, and lately, I’ve been a little too obsessed with Heated Rivalry. These are just some of the things I love, but what I truly crave is someone who wants to know me deeply—someone I can yap with 24/7, someone I can build stories with, and maybe even write a journal of moments together.

If you’re the type who notices details, respects silence, and isn’t afraid of depth, then maybe you’re someone I’d like to know. Just don’t expect me to reveal everything at once. Some things are meant to be discovered slowly.

So… let’s go to the cottage?",2,1769691026.0,singleph,0,1.0,False

It’s my third year and it was supposed to be my last but during my first year I started dating this guy from the cinematic class that i met soon after starting and we dated for one and a half year but then he ended things and soon after that he started spreading lies, I ended up dating his former friend that he had been neglecting and hasn’t been his friend for a while (yes I know it’s really shitty of me) and we are still dating but ever since my ex broke up with me I haven’t been able to go to school since he still goes and our old friend group chose his side saying I was controlling (I didn’t want him to spend his entire day playing games) and all of that and that I didn’t want to sleep with him enough. At least 4 times a week. I have talked to the school councillor and we tried to make my schedule work but I just don’t want to go anymore. My mom is constantly mad about it and just this morning my alarms didn’t go off and I really tried to go to school today but yeah. Then my stepdad (I consider him as my father) opened my door and was rather pissed and then he poured me a cup of coffee and we talked. I know he was trying to be nice and try to help but in a harsh loving way? He was telling me that if I slack around and don’t finish school I might never graduate and I will live with them until I’m 40. I’m just so scared and I’ve already lost like 3-4 family members in the span of two years. 

I want to get better I really do but I don’t know where to start, if I go to school and breathe weird. Walk odd or anything then the old friend group starts making stuff up about me and I feel so alone and just the idea of giving up has been running through my mind constantly like an ants nest.

1qq7kpg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Habits/comments/1qq7kpg/i_talked_to_at_least_one_new_woman_every_day_for/,I talked to at least one new woman every day for 365 days and it completely transformed my understanding of connection,"I was tired of being terrified every time I saw a woman I wanted to meet. The racing heart, sweaty palms, and inevitable regret of another missed opportunity. So I set myself a challenge: talk to at least one new woman every single day for a year. Not for dates or numbers, just to overcome my crippling social anxiety.

Day one was a disaster. I spent four hours at a coffee shop working up the courage to ask a simple question about a book someone was reading. When I finally approached, my voice cracked like I was thirteen again. She was kind, answered briefly, then put her headphones back on. I counted it as a win simply because I didn't pass out.

Around day thirty, something unexpected happened. I was making small talk with a woman at a grocery store when she suddenly asked why I seemed so nervous. Instead of making up an excuse, I told her the truth that I was challenging myself to overcome social anxiety by talking to new people every day.

""That's actually really brave,"" she said. ""Most people just stay comfortable and wonder why nothing changes.""

Her response shifted something fundamental in my perspective. I had been viewing these interactions as performances where I needed to appear confident, interesting, and attractive. But authenticity, even nervous authenticity, created more connection than any practiced line ever could.

By the three-month mark, I noticed patterns emerging. The conversations that flowed naturally weren't the ones where I had the perfect opener or witty comment. They were the ones where I noticed something genuine about the person and expressed curiosity about it. A uniquely patterned scarf led to a conversation about her travels in Peru. A dog's unusual breed sparked a twenty-minute chat about animal rescue.

The six-month point brought my biggest lesson. I was talking with a woman at a bookstore about our shared taste in authors when she casually mentioned her girlfriend. In the past, I would have felt defeated, all that courage ""wasted"" on someone unavailable romantically. But I found myself continuing the conversation with undiminished interest. I realized I had been unconsciously viewing women as either potential dates or non-entities. This challenge was teaching me to value connection for its own sake.

Around month nine came the hardest period. The novelty had worn off, and some days felt like pure obligation. On day 273, exhausted after work, I almost broke the streak. But in the elevator of my apartment building, I complimented a neighbor on her unusual earrings. That thirty-second exchange reignited why I started this, these small moments of human connection were adding texture and possibility to every day.

By the final month, talking to new women no longer felt like a challenge but like a natural extension of moving through the world. The last day of my year-long experiment, I realized I had spoken to three different women without even counting them for my challenge. What had been a forced daily task had become as natural as breathing.

The woman who made the deepest impression on me was someone I met around day 320. After a brief conversation about the farmers market we were both browsing, she looked at me thoughtfully and said, ""You know what's nice about talking to you? You seem interested in what I'm saying, not just waiting for your turn to speak.""

Little did she know that a year earlier, I would have been too focused on my own anxiety to truly listen to anyone. The daily practice hadn't just made me more comfortable approaching women, it had taught me to be present once the conversation began.

The most profound transformation wasn't becoming smooth or confident with women. It was recognizing that these weren't ""approaches"" at all, they were moments of human connection. I stopped seeing women as intimidating others and started seeing them as simply people, each with their own stories, struggles, and perspectives.

If you struggle with social anxiety around the opposite sex, the solution isn't better techniques or more courage. It's regular, consistent exposure that transforms the extraordinary into the ordinary. It's realizing that behind the anxiety is a simple truth: we're all just humans hoping to be seen and heard by one another, even if just for a moment in a coffee shop, talking about a book that changed our lives. Don't be afraid of women. They're all people like us too. Talk to them, old or young. And you'll realize your fears were lying to you.",1,1769690684.0,Habits,1,0.67,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

We currently have a Jura F9 at home, but after ten years we are looking to replace it. 

Our 'drinking profile' is: a mix of mostly espressos and lungos, rarely with milk/foam. Some of it is early in the morning, so a '15-step process' isn't what we are looking for. We do drink coffee at the same moments a lot, so we make a lot of two espressos or two lungos at the same time. (A steam-wand would be nice for any guests requesting milk-based coffee drinks)

Our flavor preference is dark and strong, not overly acidic.

I have been eyeing the Breville/Sage Barista Pro in Blue for months now, and that's still on top of our choice list. However, I read that it might be inconsistent and not great with dark roast beans. (we do, however, really like the looks of the machine).

Budget is around the price of the Barista Pro, so let's say approx. 800 euros. Space is a little bit of an issue too, and ideally we'd not like to sacrifice much more counter space than the Jura takes up now (roughly 28\*45 cms footprint).

General alternatives I maybe should consider is other semi-automatics (Barista Pro competition?) or Grinder/Espresso machine seperately (as long as that makes Lungos too).",1,1769690647.0,espresso,4,1.0,False

1qq7k0r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rivian/comments/1qq7k0r/a_tale_of_two_charges/,A Tale of Two Charges,"This is primarily info for those new to charging.

Charge #1 - I make the same 4 hour round trip drive 2-4 times per month and I did it earlier this week.  There is a Tesla Supercharger right on the route so it's convenient to grab a quick charge (and coffee!) before the return drive rather than charge to 100% before I leave home.

Tesla Supercharger 

* with Tesla membership 70.18 kWh @ $.22 = $14.73
* w/o membership it would have been $.49/kWh & $34.39

Charge #2 - Yesterday I was low on charge and needed to make an urgent trip with my flatbed trailer.  The Rivian Adventure Network (RAN) is the only local charger with pull-through spaces.

Rivian Adventure Network

* 53.3 kWh @ $.53 = $28.25

My takeaway - if you need to charge away from home more than once a month a Tesla membership pays for itself.  Just make sure you start the charge in the Tesla app BEFORE you plug the charger into your truck.

1qq7jy3,https://www.reddit.com/r/survivinginfidelity/comments/1qq7jy3/caught_proof_of_fiancée_of_7_years_cheating_then/,"Caught proof of fiancée of 7 years cheating, then gaslit for over a month and still in shock","First I would like to say I’m so thankful to find this sub, and to know I’m not alone carrying this weight. Despite the unbearable pain, any help is much appreciated and I hope I can someday be of help to others. I am sorry for the length of my post, but I am trying to piece together the different angles of this trauma.

I (32m) was with my partner (30f) for nearly 7 years, engaged for 1. We got on like a house on fire, shared many interests and passions, and felt we built each other up. We recently had just moved forward with plans for our wedding next year.

Unfortunately her job sector works often on short-term contracts, so during the relationship we moved many times, which my freelance job was able to adapt to. Recently, she bought a house with an inheritance, and I changed to a permanent job nearby to contribute more. However once again, six months later, she took a permanent job 5 hours away, in the isolated countryside, with the understanding it would be experience for a year or two, so I  stayed behind with our pet.

Six months into long distance, we were mostly rotating weekends to see each other, then my pet of 16 years died. Afterwards it was 2 weeks until I seen due to her new sports commitments. On her first night back with me, she went out with an ex-coworker she had become friendly with, who I knew was actively having affairs (my fiancée had previously defended this girl leading to our first argument on the topic). I picked my fiancée up later; she was drunker than I’d ever seen her. While getting her water, I glanced messages on her phone gloating to her brother's girlfriend that a soon-to-be-married male ex-coworker had confessed feelings and kissed her. Her brother's girlfriend (who started her relationship via an affair and divorce) replied, “you’re finally coming out of your box.”

I never had trust issues before, or looked at a single message before, but seeing this broke me. I had my first panic attack. When I immediately confronted her, she gaslit me, claiming I was seeing things and out of my mind. The next morning, she lashed out, accusing me of invading her privacy for looking towards her phone. She claimed the guy forced himself on her, yet refused to intervene or do anything about it. When I asked to see the messages to put me at ease she threatened to break up with me.

I spent the next month in hell trying to believe her and being as patient as possible to understand more. I was grieving my pet, losing weight, and unable to sleep. She denied any wrongdoing and shifted the blame to me, criticizing me for being insecure and waiting too long to propose (5 years). At New Year’s, I finally told her I couldn't go on without any empathy that I desperately need. She coldly replied, “Well if you’re going to break up with me I may as well tell you the truth, I did kiss him back, I did cheat.”

Thankful for some truth coming out, I tried to work through it and tell her that she should’ve said that right after she was caught. Until a few days later when I brought it up again, when she told me to leave during a blizzard so she could ""think about what she wants."" She didn't even text to see if I arrived safely at my parents.

I received a message of our doorbell being removed with a disturbing message from her brother, his gf (the one goading her on in messages) and her laughing in the background, and decided to go and remove all my stuff a few days later. Two weeks of no contact from her, I asked to meet, if at least to see how we both felt. She arrived at the coffee shop cold and emotionless. She backtracked on any admissions of cheating, saying I was over-reacting, said the doorbell video was an accident she didn’t think of at the time, lied within the first 15 minutes about the timeline, and only offered a tacit ""sorry.""

She continued to blame me for the proposal timing, despite having already bought her wedding dress months prior. But realizing she was tripping over her own lies and lacked any empathy, I had a moment of clarity and pity for her, and gave her back the engagement ring she also gave me, ending the relationship for my own health.

It has been two weeks since that talk which gave me clarity. But now I feel despair. The person I thought I knew is dead; this cold, post-cheating version of her is a stranger. I have no home in the city where I work, having been kicked out after contributing for so long, and am currently on sick leave.

The trauma of the cheating is bad, but her complete lack of care has shaken me to my core. I still have to meet her in a few days to return her things and get her ring back. Despite the treatment, a part of me is still hoping for a revelation or sign of remorse from her, even though it’s been 2 months since seeing those messages and not a drop. Piecing together that her brother and his gf were in on it, particularly as they are very defensive of their own affair, just adds insult to injury.

My ex-fiancée is still publicly hanging out with her new friend, the girl having the affairs. As of last week, I’ve blocked them all from socials and am on my third week of therapy, surrounding myself with friends, and hoping the final exchange of stuff will help. Though despite her move across the country, she seems to be putting in more effort than ever to commit to our mutual hobbies, spaces and friends at the weekends now, as if nothing has happened, making me feel more isolated in order to avoid her.

I still feel I’m in shock the person I knew for 7 years and who I thought was my soulmate could treat someone like this, I would never drive my worst enemy to therapy without empathy, nevermind my fiancée. I worry about the long term trauma effects. And every day I wake up feels like a living nightmare.",12,1769690621.0,survivinginfidelity,24,0.8,False

1qq7j87,https://www.reddit.com/r/AuDHDWomen/comments/1qq7j87/can_i_get_your_opinion/,can I get your opinion?,"I'm recently diagnosed, it was NYE. I'm trying to communicate something to my undiagnosed ADHD husband of 30 years and it's not landing. 

For our entire marriage up until now, I've been in the freeze state most of the time he initiates physical contact: (*just get through it, it'll be over soon*) I don't want to do that anymore

But it's really difficult to explain to someone who I've slept next to since I was a teenager that this isn't a change, it's saying the truth. 

It's really painful for him to learn, and it's really painful for me to say.

I swatted his hand away last night, because I don't have the words in the moment to explain it all. Because yesterday, it was 'don't grab me like you're kneading dough' but last night, he didn't do that. We were lying in bed and he reached back and rubbed my leg.

You see, he's listening. He's responding with change. But I don't even know the rules of my own body, because I ignored the signals for so long. 

I actually didn't realize he was hurt by my swatting, I did it and it was over from my perspective. He didn't say he was hurt, so I offered no apology. It simply disappeared.

A little while later I reached for his hand. He held it tight to his body. I thought he was joking because he likes to play. I pulled, no give, no giggle. That's when he told me that I rejected him, so he's rejecting me because he's hurt. 

I understand it hurt, but when I'm actively being rejected and finding out at the same time it's because he felt rejected by me, my choice is to dump my feelings in the moment to respond to his. Or stay with my hurt, which quickly turned to anger, because he's being spiteful.

I turned my back and let him know he was being spiteful and asked how was I supposed to respond to his hurt if I didn't know it existed, and that right now he was choosing to hurt me out of spite to prove a point. I also said if I'd never reached for him, his hurt would've never even been known, so by withholding it he was actively harming himself and our relationship.

He stood up, told me that I didn't care when I swatted his hand away, and slept in the living room. 

I went out to make coffee ☕ this morning. After putting it to brew and it was still kind of dark, asked from across the room if he was awake? He said yes. I didn't know what to say so I walked back down to my room and said 'idk what to say anyway'

I recorded an audio clip for him thinking I could get my point across in my emotions and haven't sent it yet.

I'm looking for suggestions on how to communicate and bridge the communication gap. I've seen many of you post that you're in a relationship with someone who has ADHD. I think stories of what's worked will really help.

I monitor all my levels and while my GP won’t refer me for an infusion, she sees no issue with me supplementing. 

I figured this group would have the most experience on iron supplementation. Also diarrhoea is not an issue I suffer with in general or from anything else I eat or take. If that’s relevant. 

So here’s what I’ve tried:

Iron bisglycinate even at just 20mg gives me diarrhoea. 

Koji iron is ok-ish at 27mg every few days but can’t take much. 

Floravital (GF Floradix) is fine at the 20mg dose every other day but don’t want to increase the pyrodoxine B6 that it contains more. (My sister has minor but permanent nerve damage from that form of b6!)

BetterYou Iron spray - doesn’t cause any issues but also not sure it does anything to help. Interested if others found it worked at all. 

And I eat meat every day. Avoid food and tea and coffee around iron supplements. Can’t tolerate much vitamin c but I take a little. 

In 7 months my ferritin did increase by 9 points with infrequent koji iron, iron spray and lactoferrin. I’m looking for something I might tolerate better so I could increase my dose and thus increase ferritin a bit faster.

I (29M, gay) have a confusing situation with a coworker (26M). We’re in the same broader team at a big company in Australia, but we don’t work directly together.

When he started \~5 months ago, there was intense eye contact, nervousness around me, blushing, clamming up, going silent in groups where I was involved, etc. At times in the early stages he would hover and melt/relax when I spoke to him. For a couple of months, he started to be warmer in front of others, and he was relaxing and getting gooey (in ways I haven't seen him with anyone else) when we talked one-on-one. He was walking with me to the station after work, inviting me for coffee, opening up about personal stuff (family, injuries, friends), etc. It honestly felt like mutual attraction building over time. 

I usually miss signals or file guys away as 'hot but nah', especially at work, but the signs were strong and prolonged. At first I thought he was just nervous at a new job and I was trying to be welcoming in a low pressure way. When it felt natural, I'd say hello and maybe initiate a short chat once or twice a week, but I'd otherwise leave him alone (especially on all the days that he was anxious or closed off). I also haven't sought him out one-on-one with a single invitation, unnecessary messaging, or manufactured proximity. It was really a shock that the signs kept coming, even if I probably gave some of the same signs back to him. The eye contact, nerves and melting lasted and (in ways) continue now.

But, at a Christmas lunch around \~4 months in, he casually mentioned he’s had a girlfriend for almost 3 years. At that lunch, I ended up coming out in front of him in a joking way that was pushed by another bro colleague (who I'm mates with) that already knew. (side note: I don't understand how people miss that I'm gay, but I suppose I pass and don't usually bring it up in groups at work). Following this lunch, his behaviour completely shifted. He became dismissive, cold, physically avoided being near me, would be glued to his phone when it was just us, bro-ed it up with other colleagues. Everyone else became warmer, including his closest bro, and I don't think I did or said anything hurtful or wrong.

In the three weeks since returning to the office after the break, he’s mostly kept his distance from everyone in our team. The last day I saw him, he was being warm and normal with everyone but me. The whole of January, there’s still been intense eye contact and moments of nervous warmth (like clocking me but avoiding me on our way to the station and then illegally crossing to catch me, checking me out when I was dressed up for a work event, staring while he slowly packed up like he wanted me to leave with him, etc).

It's now this weird mix of avoidance + awareness, with absolutely everything left unsaid.

I know life would be easier if I just got over him (hello to the late mention of a girlfriend, a religious family background, the bro-ness of him and his circle, and the hot/cold), but I inadvertently caught feelings and we have to see each other at work. It also doesn't help that he is the stereotypical male ideal (physically) and that we click (when we click).

I like clarity, and I like doing what I can to be solid with the people in my life. This rupture and the confusion makes me feel a little crazy and stressed. And, for better or worse, he'll be in my life until one of us changes jobs. 

But, as you all know... it's risky and it's a tale as old as time.

Do you think he was into me and freaked out?  
Is it worth talking to him to be honest and/or clear the air?  
Is it worth talking to him to smooth things over?  
Or should I just try let it fade and hope we both get over whatever this is?

1qq7fx0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qq7fx0,Cajsa : ITC Gardenia,"Dropped in for the 7-course non-veg tasting menu today at Cajsa itcgardenia — and honestly, it felt like good value for what we got.

 Every dish was cared for, from the first fork to the last sip. The starter — Asparagus Mousseline — was a quiet little win: silky, delicate, just the right sort of green freshness and the earthiness from the truffle ; one of the best ways to begin a tasting menu I’ve had in a while.

Mains hit the mark too — portion sizes that don’t waste, flavours that speak global but grounded, and desserts that didn’t scream “look how fancy I am,” but settled in gently (the coffee-inspired dessert was a cheeky favourite).

A lot of what Cajsa does feels like it takes a page out of Avartana’s playbook — the clean plating, the calm confidence in flavours, and that sense of “let the dish speak, don’t overdo it.” It’s not trying to be Avartana, but you can see the inspiration in the discipline and finesse. And that’s a good thing.

For a “fancy” night out in Bengaluru, that’s a sweet spot — classy without being over-the-top.

The dinner was about the quiet wins all along the way ....",3,1769690304.0,bangalorefoodies,2,0.81,False

I'm sitting in my office and crying instead of working. The weight of the stone on my chest is 1000 kg. I'm done carrying that.

I want to take care of myself. Move my body more. Cook for myself. Drink my morning coffee/tea no in rush and with the stress. I want to be able to rest. not to feel tension all the time.

I want my partner to take me seriously. To treat me like I'm a big deal. Because I am! I want him to be patient with me. To support me. To plan our future. 

I want to move out. I'm dying inside in this environment. Since 3 years it's still postponed. This year it will finally happen, but I don't feel excitement. I feel depressed. Tired. Old. Ugly. Behind in life.

I feel there is no joy. Just duties and trying to survive. Wearing a mask costs me a fortune.

I feel... mourning? Because of lost time. I lost optimistic and happy part of me. I miss her, but she is gone. I miss having normal family. it will never happen. I was always a problem. I wish I could get support ""great, you start uni! good luck!"" instead of ""it's too difficult for you, you don't need it"".

I want real people and real connections in my life. I want to laugh with someone. I don't remember when last time I laughed.

I'm going to see a psychiatrist in 2 weeks. I wish I could get a sick leave and just be able to rest. But I'm also scared, because your value depends on your productivity. But I'm done. I used to do everything right and I have nothing. 

No good memories, no big career, no stable relationship, no my favorite places. I'm done fighting.

I'm turning 32 next week. I feel like I lived already 100. I don't want to celebrate. These wishes dont work.",2,1769690288.0,offmychest,4,1.0,False

We've been married for 16 years, together for 20 years.  


  
Hey \[nickname\],

Wow, I can't remember the last time I called you that. Let alone when we used to write each other letters.

I've started this letter so many times. I've tried to talk to you about it before, but the words always come out wrong or they come out angry or they don't come out at all. So I'm writing instead, because I need you to understand what's happening inside me and I need you to hear it as love, not criticism. Because it is love. It's always been love.

I miss you...

Not the you who sleeps beside me, because you're here. I miss us. I miss the connection we had, the intimacy, the feeling that we were lovers who happened to also be building a life together. Somewhere along the way, we became partners in logistics, parents, roommates. But I lost my wife. And I don't think either of us noticed it happening until it had already happened.

I'm not blaming you for this. I think it happened to both of us, slowly, in the ordinary busyness of life. But I want us back.

I've been thinking about when we last made love. Properly made love. Where we both wanted each other, where it wasn't about getting it done or ticking a box. I truly can't remember, but it's been many years. Since then it's either been out of duty or it's been us separately, side by side but not together. And even in those moments, I help you get there, and I'm happy to, I want to. But you won't touch me anymore. Not your hands, not your mouth, not anything. So whether we're together or not, I'm still alone.

I need to try to explain something, because I'm not sure I've ever been able to put it into words properly. When you don't reach for me, when you won't touch me, something in me hears ""you are not wanted"". And I can only hear that so many times before something inside me starts to close. It's not about the physical act. It's about being chosen. Being desired. Feeling like I'm someone worth reaching for. I chose monogamy with you, not celibacy. You are the only person I'm allowed to want. And wanting someone who doesn't want me back is a particular kind of loneliness I never expected to feel inside a marriage.

I've carried that rejection so many times now that something inside me has started to protect itself. I've reached a point I never thought I'd reach. I don't want to be intimate with you anymore. Not because I don't find you attractive. I do. Not because I don't love you. I love you so much it hurts. But because I can't keep hoping that one day you'll want me the way I want you. Hope is exhausting when it never leads anywhere.

And it's not just the bedroom. It's everything.

I'm still present. I do little things and big things. Making your coffee, running a bath and heating the room, ordering wine or chocolates. I feel I do my fair share of tasks around the house. I look after our finances, our bills, I fix what needs fixing if I can do it myself. I show up every single day. And everything I do, I do with you in mind.

Last year I showered you with presents from your birthday to Christmas to our anniversary, a way of showing you how much you mean to me. It made no difference. This year I haven't and that's made no difference either. I'm not saying this to make you feel guilty. I'm saying it because I've stopped trying, and I don't want to be that man. Whether I give everything or give nothing, the response feels the same. And somewhere along the way, I gave up trying to win something that seemed impossible to win.

But even in the everyday, the ordinary moments, I feel like I can't get it right.

Whatever I do or don't do, whatever I say or don't say, there's friction either way. Differences of opinion that feel like tests I'm failing. Comments that feel like criticism. Sometimes even in front of \[son's name\], which cuts deeper than you will ever know. I find myself trying to guess what you want, what you're thinking, what I've done to receive the cold shoulder and half the time I have no idea. I'm not a mind reader.

Twenty years ago, when we met, I treated you the way I wanted to be treated. With kindness, love, affection, with generosity. I've realised that I've stopped doing that. I think I now treat you the way you treat me. And I hate who I've become. Some days I look in the mirror and I don't even recognise the person looking back. He's harder, more guarded, gone quiet, has no confidence. But mostly he's just tired.

I'm telling you all of this not to wound you, but because I am wounded. And I think you might be too, in ways I don't fully understand.

So I need to ask you something, and I need you to be honest: Is there something you need from me that you've stopped asking for? Is there something I've done, or stopped doing, that has made you feel unloved or unseen? Because if there is, I want to know. I can't fix what I don't understand. And if we're both feeling invisible to each other, then we've both been suffering alone when we could have been reaching for each other.

I'm telling you all of this because I don't want this to be our story. I don't want us to drift further apart. It already feels like we're just two people who share a house, a child, a dog, but nothing else.

I still see you. I still want you. I still choose you.

But I need to be chosen, too. Not out of obligation. Not because it's easier to stay than to leave. I need to feel wanted. I need to feel desired. I need to know that when you look at me, you see someone worth reaching for.

I don't know exactly how we'd go about finding our way back. But I know I want to try. I want to understand what you need. I want you to understand what I need. I want us to stop being opponents and start being partners again. Better yet, lovers again.

We need to talk. Not about daily chores, work, school or finances. About what's broken and how we might begin to fix it. I promise I'll try to listen without defending, speak without accusing. But it will take two to make that happen.

I'm still reaching for you. I hope you'll reach back.

Love,

Me",14,1769690282.0,DeadBedrooms,5,0.9,False

The stock tips always felt thin and awkward, and I never quite got a proper seal. Sonically that came through as light bass, shouty mids, and a cramped, slightly unnatural presentation.

Swapped them for KBear Coffee tips (wide bore) and the difference is huge across the board.

Bass is now properly present and punchy, in kind of a blessing kind of way, punchy but still reduced in the lower mids. The mids and upper treble have completely calmed down, losing that shouty edge and sounding far more natural and smooth. At the same time, the soundstage has opened up massively. Everything feels wider, more spacious, and better separated. None of these changes feel subtle.

I’m only using the Pop EQ profile, but honestly, I’m ridiculously impressed with how good these sound now. They finally feel like they’re performing at their full potential.

Bonus: they still fit in the charging case. I’m using Large, so all sizes should fit.

1qq7e1a,https://www.reddit.com/r/USTravel/comments/1qq7e1a/is_budget_travel_still_possible_in_the_usa/,Is budget travel still possible in the USA?,"European here. I've been thinking I might want to visit the USA one more time before I check out, and the way I'd like to travel is to freely tour the country by bus and on foot. For accommodation I'd like to camp out as much as possible and stay at budget motels. (That's how I travel wherever I go.) But I get the impression that the US has become terribly expensive even for basic stuff.

Last time I was in the US was 2006, when IIRC things were still pretty affordable, and prior to that I traveled in the USA in the 90's, when some McD's offered the basic burger for $1.00 during off-hours, and you could get a cup of filter coffee from a gas station for 50 cents. A quick look at the prices now reveals that the same basic hamburger is now $3.99 (costs around €1.60 in most European countries) and a small black coffee is $2.59 (€1.50 in Europe, and coffee from vending machines is less than €1 in many EU countries). So that's quite a price hike that's happened in the US. Also, I see that taking a Greyhound bus across the country costs around $250, not including seat reservations which are almost $10	a leg. Pretty dang expensive in my opinion. (I'm aware flying is often cheaper but I dislike airports and the bus is much nicer if you're a tourist cause you get to see the countryside.) Last, I haven't checked accommodation prices yet but I guess $25 dollars a night for roadside motels (the way it was back in the 90's) might be hard to find by now. 

So tell me folks... is it still possible to tour the US on a shoestring budget? Or are those days gone forever? ",0,1769690153.0,USTravel,16,0.5,False
