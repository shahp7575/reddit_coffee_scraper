             [Earbud Speaker]

Average round‑trip latency target: <1.2 s


---

2  Component Breakdown

2.1  Audio Capture & Voice‑Activity Detection (VAD)

Library: android.media.AudioRecord (Android) or AVAudioEngine (iOS).

Chunk size: 16 kHz mono, 16‑bit, 0.5 s windows.

Energy‑based VAD: WebRTC VAD or silero‑vad rust port; drops silent buffers to save battery.


2.2  Streaming Speech‑to‑Text

Engine: whisper.cpp quantised large-v3 model (Q5_K_M).

Mode: --enable-half --stream to emit partial words.

Latency: ≈180–250 ms per 0.5 s chunk on Snapdragon 8‑gen‑2.


2.3  Intent / Trigger Gate

User control options:

1. Push‑to‑Think hardware button on earbud.


2. Wake‑word ""Hey Coach"" (ResNet 15 ONNX, 12 KB).


3. Keyword heuristics (e.g., detect ""price"", ""timeline"").



Why: Keeps private chatter out of the cloud & reduces token spend.


2.4  LLM Call

API: POST /v1/chat/completions (stream).

System prompt (≤150 chars):

You are my silent business‑negotiation coach. Reply in ≤20 words. If unsure, ask clarifying Q. Cite no facts unless certain.

Context window: append only the last 30 s transcript + last 3 assistant suggestions.

Temperature: 0.3; top_p:1; max_tokens:64; stop:""\n"".


2.5  Text‑to‑Speech Output

Engine (Android): Google Speech Services speak(text, QUEUE_ADD, params).

Optimisation: Start TTS as soon as first 6 tokens arrive; stream remainder.

Optional AR subtitle: if paired smart‑glasses are present, push text via Bluetooth LE GATT.

3  Smartphone PoC Implementation Notes

3.1  Platform Choice

Fastest start: React Native + Expo Audio + Native Modules for whisper.cpp (NDK) – lets you hot‑reload UI while native code handles heavy lift.

Permissions: RECORD_AUDIO, BLUETOOTH_CONNECT, FOREGROUND_SERVICE, POST_NOTIFICATIONS.


3.2  Key Kotlin Service Skeleton

@ForegroundService
class EarCoachService : Service() {
  private lateinit var whisper: WhisperClient
  private val scope = CoroutineScope(Dispatchers.IO)

  override fun onStartCommand(i: Intent?, flags: Int, id: Int): Int {
     startForeground(1, buildNotif())
     scope.launch { captureLoop() }
     return START_STICKY
  }

  suspend fun captureLoop() {
     AudioRecorder(16000, 512).use { rec ->
        val ring = RingBuffer(48000) // 3 s
        while (isActive) {
           val buf = rec.read()
           if (VAD.isSpeech(buf)) ring.push(buf)
           if (triggered()) handleChunk(ring.latest(24000))
        }
     }
  }

  suspend fun handleChunk(pcm: ShortArray) {
     val text = whisper.transcribe(pcm)
     val resp = openAi.chat(text)
     TTS.speak(resp)
  }
}

Wire in your wake‑word or button logic in triggered().

3.3  OpenAI Client (Retrofit)

interface OpenAiApi {
  @POST(""/v1/chat/completions"")
  fun chat(@Body req: ChatReq): Flow<String> // emits tokens
}

4  Privacy & Safety Guard‑Rails

Risk	Mitigation

Illegal recording in all‑party‑consent states	Show LED on phone + audible ""Recording active"" chime; let user toggle Mute instantly
Accidental leaks (cloud logs)	Encrypt chunks end‑to‑end; delete transcripts after 24 h locally
Hallucinated advice	Unit test prompt on synthetic dialogues; add post‑filter: drop numbers not in knowledge base



---

5  Performance Targets & Measurement

Metric	Target	Measurement Tool

STT latency	≤ 250 ms per 0.5 s	Log timestamps around whisper.cpp call
Total RTT (speech→speech)	≤ 1.2 s p95	Android Trace markers across pipeline
Battery drain	≤ 12 % per hour	Android Battery Historian

I wasn’t passionate about the industry, but I love food and how it makes people feel. Unfortunately, I never really liked the people working in it much, including myself. The pressure and competitive environment could at times make people so deceiving, disloyal and toxic.

I finally had enough after 14yrs of trying to be brave enough to leave. I gave in my notice and felt like a weight had been lifted. Was scared shitless at the same time.

I partnered with my life partner who is a well known tattoo and portrait artist in Nairobi. He is the Talent while I’m more on the managing and organizing side of things, putting my skills to good use.

I don’t know what the future holds, especially  with the chaos and mayhem in our country right now. I’m scared and hopeful at the same time. My partner and I hope to bring some kind of joy and color to the world however we can.

We were talking and she just asked if I wanted her number, cool yeah. Also I was a little tipsy when I gave it to her, almost just gave her my contact card, and she said oh no I would’ve hunted you down. 
She asked if I made it home safe. (I ride a motorcycle and left late) cool we’ve been chatting on Snapchat. And like I’ve complemented her looks a few times and she doesn’t say anything. She’s told me she’s awkward when chatting, which is fine. But she also calls her roommate her GF which I know a lot of lady friends of mine call their friends that are girls their GFs. 
Idk
Also I asked to stay at her house, like we only met the one time. She said yes, we live a few hours apart, and I have some stuff to do early in the am in her town. Didn’t want to make the ride there. And like we planned to go get coffee after my errands before I asked to stay at her place, we still are. But like mixed signals here. Idk my senses are telling me

Technically, I’ve never owned a laptop, only ever had chromebooks and an old pc from the nineties back in the day. I have used laptops and modern PCs in work settings though, I just didn’t own them personally, or bought one. I’ve included images of the two I’m debating between. For parameters:

-I’d like to buy from costco, for reasons including their warranty and return policy.
-I’d like it to have 32 gb of RAM/memory and 1tb of storage. I got a job at an architecture firm, and I’d like to have something that can keep up with the software I’ll be using. I’ll also potentially be returning to school. 
-I’d like it to be something that’s going to be less fragile and delicate, since I work hybrid and commute with my computer to the office, coffee shops, etc. 
-I’d also like to potentially play some very minimal games on it in the future with my friends, but this is less crucial to me.

My husband and I (both 29 years old) are looking for advice mainly pertaining to moving with our dogs. 

Looking for the following:
1) fear free vets that either get you in a room quickly or have bigger welcome areas. We will drive up to 40 minutes for a good one. Looking to spend $70-$130 on annual exams. 
2) trails/sidewalks that you rec for reactive dogs (whether that is more space, less running into off leash dogs, wider sidewalks, etc)
3) places for dog dentals

I already read a bunch of threads detailing the off leash dog problem with many on leash only spots so I totally understand and that’s the same here where we live in Colorado. 

Previous suggestions: Montara beach, point Pinole, presidio for walking spaces with reactive dogs. 

Neighborhood suggestions for big dog households (Great Pyrs & Bernese):
1) We love the cold/mild temps and that’s one of the reasons we want to move to SF as we’ve been going through 90+ temps from June through end of September. Our dogs hate the heat, and we hate the heat. We love fog + prefer temps under 70.
2) budget is $4200 (hoping for 2 bed 1ba min) and the biggest requirements are having a yard/small garden + allow dogs 95-100lbs (one of our dogs is an ESA with doctor documentation so we are looking for areas that would allow 2 big dogs) 
3) walkable to beach/trails
4) walkable to coffee shops/restaurants but we don’t need a bunch of options 

We were looking at Outer Sunset/Sunset District but also open to any suggestions like Daly City, South San Francisco, Oakland as well or elsewhere. Someone suggested Marina and Richmond but I don’t think we have the budget for those. Our dogs have rental histories, our current apartment staff can vouch for all 3 of them as they see them almost every day, we have pet insurance for all 3, up to date on vaccines, etc—are there ways to ask if places are negotiable for dog size or ways to show big dogs aren’t destructive like people think? 

Extra: we are looking at Zillow, Craigslist, Redfin, trulia, rent and FB marketplace for rentals. Are there other places to be looking? We are hoping for single family home/townhome style as we do not want to live in apartment complex again. 

Any other advice for dog owners you have like behaviorists, places to do control unleashed classes, and even places to avoid with a reactive dog would be helpful. Our other two dogs are more friendly but we have 1 that just is more selective with dogs. We’ve lived in an apartment complex Thank you for any and all help!

Okay, I need a reality check because I'm genuinely confused and feeling like I'm losing my mind a little bit here.

I (28F) have a friend, let's call her Anna (27F). About six months ago, Anna was in a really tight spot with rent and a car repair and asked if she could borrow some money. I'm a freelance graphic designer, so while I'm not rolling in it, I had some savings and wanted to help. I loaned her $1000 with the clear understanding that it was a loan, not a gift.

She paid me back $500 pretty quickly, which was awesome. After that, though, it went silent. A couple of months went by, and I gently brought it up. I was chill about it, I said something like ""Hey, no rush at all, but do you think we could maybe work out a plan for the other $500? Even like $100 a month or even $50 would be totally fine.""

This is where it went sideways. Anna got really weird and said, ""Oh, I kind of figured we could just forget about the rest. You're doing so well with your work, you don't really need it.""

lol I was a bit taken aback. I tried to explain that being a freelancer means my income can be a total rollercoaster, and that yes, I actually do need the money I'm owed. This turned into a full-blown argument. She accused me of ""money-shaming"" her, making her feel small, and said that ""real friends"" don't hold debts over each other's heads. She said I was being greedy and that I clearly cared more about money than our friendship.

What makes this sting even more is that over these past six months, whenever we've gone out for coffee or to just hang out, I've ended up paying probably 90% of the time without ever making a big deal about it. I just wanted to hang out with my friend.

The argument ended with her saying, ""FINE! I'll pay you the full $500 on my next payday, and then we're done. I don't need friends like you.""

I was so shocked I did apologize later via text, saying I was sorry if the way I brought it up was insensitive, but that it was still a loan we agreed on. She left me on read. She hasn't paid me back yet, and her payday was last week.

Now, a mutual friend has been giving me grief, saying I should have just let the $500 go to ""keep the peace"" and that I was being petty because I'm ""obviously doing better"" than Anna is financially. I feel like I'm being gaslit into thinking I'm a bad person for wanting my own money back.

And massive potential to add on literally 1000+ sqft of covered porch for not much at all - got a quote of \~18,000 \~3yrs ago - when lumber was peaking. AC/heat and all appliances are original (newer microwave) and work. 2 side by side frides - work. Literally move in ready.

Dear Ma and Pa, 

Just writing to let you know I’m doing fine—hope you are too. Be sure to tell Brother Walt and Brother Elmer that the Marine Corps is a sweet deal compared to breaking your back for Old Man Johnson. They ought to sign up fast before word gets out and all the good spots are taken. 

At first, I thought something was wrong—they let you sleep in ‘til nearly 6 a.m.! Took me a bit to get used to all that laziness. No hogs to slop, no feed to pitch, no firewood to split or stove to stoke. Before breakfast, all you gotta do is tidy up your cot and shine a few odds and ends. That’s it! I about cried from how easy it was. 

They make em shave every day, but it ain’t so bad—they give you warm water. And breakfast? It’s not quite ham steak and gravy, but there’s cereal, fruit juice, eggs, and bacon. If you sit next to one of those city fellers who only sips coffee, you can eat his plate too. Between his meal and mine, I’m full 'til lunch. No wonder them city boys are always dragging their feet—they’re half-starved and soft as biscuit dough. 

We do these things they call ""route marches"" to toughen us up. The sergeant acts like it’s a death trek, but honestly, it’s no worse than walking to our mailbox back home. The city boys start whining about blisters, so we end up riding back in trucks anyway. Bless their hearts. 

The sergeant’s kind of like Miss Langley from third grade—always hollerin’ about something. The Captain just frowns like he’s got gas. The majors and colonels drive by now and then, looking important but not doing much else. 

Now get this—y’all won’t believe it—I keep winning medals for marksmanship. I don’t even know how. The targets are bigger than a squirrel’s noggin and just sit there, nice and still. No dodging, no shooting back, no yelling like the Higgett boys did when we used to play war games in the pasture. All you gotta do is lie there comfy and pop 'em. They even hand you the bullets in a neat little box! 

And then there’s hand-to-hand combat training. They pair us up to wrestle, mostly with city slickers. I try not to break them—they fold like laundry. It’s not like tangling with the old bull back home. I’m pretty good at it too—second best, right behind Tug Jordan from Silver Lake. He’s built like a silo—6’8”, 300 pounds, and I only beat him once. I’m just 5’6” and 130 soaking wet, so I think that counts for something! 

Anyhow, tell Walt and Elmer they better get their tails down here quick before everyone else figures out how cushy this outfit is. 

Love you both— 

Your loving daughter,
Alice

My entire life I’ve been able to see and or talk to “things”, I’ve been able to tell you if someone or something was wrong or going to go wrong but the past couple of weeks I’ve predicted two things one being my sisters apartment starting on fire and her dogs being trapped inside (her and the dogs are okay!) but i had horrible horrible anxiety to the point i made my fiance write a note on our door saying dog inside when we left, then also my fiancé’s friend being hurt extensively from someone else and not making it, this happened yesterday and that night i had a crying screaming panic attack about something being wrong and seeing a man with a kitchen utensil walking, adding also my fiances other friends heart stopping and 🪦ing and meeting him in a room and talking to him and then him running to a door to come back and he did come back soon after these are all extremely new things to me and things I’ve never done so strongly before or been able to predict so accurately I’m not sure what to do with it. But that’s not the main reason for this post I went camping this weekend with my fiancé, sister/BIL  and their kids along with their friends on private land the friend owned we got there Friday and went walking in the woods there is a cemetery about a mile away since the cam0 site is tucked back into the woods and the graveyard is across the road (never went into cemetery) we ended up sleeping there and the next day our dog got really sick so we had to leave early we were supposed to stay until Sunday we got 5 minutes away and i started sobbing that we needed to go back and I needed to take my sister to this coffee shop it was just a really strong feeling i had too then after we go back and I take her we leave and we get home that night I start having the worst panic attack I’ve had in years that something is wrong I can’t breath i see this man walking through the woods towards the campsite with a pokey thing and it focuses on his eyes, I need to call her now it was 230 in the morning I call her everythings fine but an animal being hurt by another aninal woke her up at the same time i called her, ever since my fiance and I have both been having nightmares (he doesn’t normally get them) about my sister and the kids and something in our home feels very off, I still have a knot in my tummy, my energy feels somthing?? my phone has been malfunctioning all day we’re both exhausted and my fiances back is killing him do you think it’s residual or an attachment?!

\- putting the tea bag + syrup into the little jug, and adding a small amount of hot water to it

\- filling the cup almost to the brim with ice

\- pouring cold milk, and the tea mixture on top

I haven't tasted it myself because I'm vegan and super sensitive to caffeine, but I feel like this process probably makes the drink super weak? They don't want me to wait 3 minutes or whatever to let the tea steep, they just want me to serve it ASAP. And I think it would be weird to keep the teabag in there, with it being an iced drink - please correct me if I'm wrong!

What do y'all think of how my shop does things? Is there anything I can do differently to make it taste better? ",2,1751953941.0,barista,0,1.0,False

*It was just… there.*

*A plain brown package sitting on the steps of my apartment, right in front of 3B. No label. No logo. No name. Just my unit number burned into the bottom. Not written — actually scorched, like someone branded it with a cattle iron.That should’ve been the first red flag. But I was still half-asleep, holding coffee, and honestly? I was too tired to care.*

*So yeah, fuck it, I brought it inside.*

*The box wasn’t taped shut, just folded. It creaked a little when I opened it, like it had bones.Inside was this… thing. Black, dense, about the size of a grapefruit. Almost round but not quite. Like it was trying to be a sphere and gave up halfway through. It had grooves. Spirals. Whorls like a shell or a brain or a tumor.I poked it. It was warm. Not like sun-warm. Like skin-warm.I stared at it for a while and thought, what the actual fuck is this?*

*I couldn’t stop thinking about it. I put it on the kitchen counter and tried to ignore it. Ate cereal. Watched half an episode of something I couldn’t follow. But my eyes kept drifting* [*back.It*](http://back.It) *was like it was looking at me. Even though it didn’t have eyes. That night, I left it on the table. I figured if it started crawling around or singing Latin backwards or whatever, I’d chuck it out the window and move on with my life. At 3:33 AM, I woke up freezing cold.*

*The object was in my bedroom. I didn’t remember moving it.*

*I started feeling weird. First it was the dreams — all teeth and tunnels and static. Then my skin. Dry, cracked. My fingertips were bleeding for no reason. I looked in the mirror and my pupils were huge. I turned on the lights. Still huge. Something was off. My reflection felt… delayed. Like I’d move, then it would follow. And one night, I swear to god, it smiled at me before I did.I screamed. Like, full-body, no-shame scream. I smashed the mirror with a wrench.*

*I called in sick to work. Told myself I just needed rest. Water. Sleep. Electrolytes or some shit.But I couldn’t stop looking at the thing. I fed it once — not on purpose. A scab from my arm landed on it. I tried to brush it off, but it sank in. Got absorbed. I felt something shift in my chest when it happened. Like it had thanked me. My phone rang. Unknown number.I answered.There was breathing. Then a voice that sounded like mine, but not mine, said:*

*“You’re doing great.”*

*I threw the phone across the room. It kept ringing. The screen was shattered but it kept lighting up. Buzzing. Buzzing.When I picked it up again, it was off. Dead battery. The object was humming.* *I stopped showering. Stopped eating real meals. My nails started falling off one by one. I kept them in a bowl, thinking maybe the object wanted them.I wasn’t sure when I started thinking of it like that — wanted. Like it had needs.I talked to it. I told it about my childhood. My ex. My job. How I hated my life sometimes.And it pulsed, like it was listening.Sometimes I thought I heard it answer back. Just a whisper. But it knew my* [*name.It*](http://name.It) *happened when I was pouring coffee. I turned around, and I was already standing in the doorway.*

*Me. Same hoodie. Same scar above the brow.He looked at me and smiled. Slow. Off. Not quite right. “I like what you’re becoming,” he said. I froze. Didn’t breathe. Then he was gone. Like a blink. I didn’t sleep that night. The object glowed faintly, like coals.* *The thing opened. It split down the middle like a mouth. Inside was… not teeth. Not anything. Just space. Like it went somewhere deeper. I reached toward it, and I swear my hand went through. There was pressure behind my eyes. My vision whited out. I saw flashes. Versions of me. All wrong. Some screaming. Some smiling too wide. Some gone.*

*It whispered: “Let us finish what you started.”*

*I nodded. I don’t even know why. It felt right. Like handing over the wheel when you’re too tired to drive. Now I’m better. Stronger. Lighter. People look at me weird on the street, but I smile. They can’t tell. They don’t know what’s coming. The object is quiet now. It doesn’t need to say anything. We understand each other. Tomorrow I leave it somewhere new. Another doorstep. Another tired soul looking for meaning.*

***And walk away.***

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Living in a cozy, sustainable space while enjoying the beauty of rural surroundings is a dream for many. Choosing a 24x40 steel cabin kit can turn this dream into a reality. These metal homes are becoming increasingly popular for their unique benefits tailored for rural living.

### Durability and Low Maintenance

One of the standout features of 24x40 steel cabin kits is their remarkable durability. Steel structures are resistant to harsh weather conditions, pests, and decay. Here are some key points on durability and maintenance:

- **Weather Resistant:** Steel can withstand heavy rain, wind, and snow, ensuring that your cabin remains sturdy throughout the seasons.
- **Pest Proof:** Unlike wooden homes, steel is not susceptible to termites or other insects, eliminating the need for pest control.
- **Minimal Care:** Steel is easy to clean and does not require frequent repainting, saving you time and resources.

### Sustainability and Energy Efficiency

Sustainability is a pressing concern in modern construction. 24x40 steel cabin kits meet eco-friendly preferences with their design and materials:

- **Recyclable Materials:** Steel is one of the most recycled materials in the world, contributing to less waste and a reduced carbon footprint.
- **Energy Efficiency:** Many steel cabins can be outfitted with high-quality insulation that keeps heating and cooling costs low, allowing for a more comfortable living environment.
- **Natural Resources Conservation:** Building with steel reduces the need for timber, promoting forest conservation and responsible resource management.

### Cost-Effectiveness

Budget is often a significant factor when considering rural living options. 24x40 steel cabin kits offer excellent value for money:

- **Lower Initial Costs:** Compared to traditional homes, steel cabin kits cost significantly less, making it easier for you to invest in your dream home.
- **Reduced Long-Term Costs:** The longevity and maintenance savings of steel cabins result in lower overall costs throughout the years.
- **Financing Options:** Many manufacturers offer flexible financing plans, making it affordable for you to build your own retreat.

### Customizable Designs

Your home should reflect your personality and lifestyle. A 24x40 steel cabin kit provides ample opportunities for customization. You can tailor your cabin to fit your needs:

- **Layout Flexibility:** Choose from various floor plans, including open layouts or divided spaces. This lets you create a cozy atmosphere that's perfect for entertaining or relaxing.
- **Aesthetic Options:** Steel cabins can be styled with a range of colors and finishes, ensuring that your home complements its natural surroundings.
- **Expandable Living Space:** As your needs change, these cabins can be modified or expanded without significant hassle.

### Quick Construction Time

When you’re ready to move to the peaceful countryside, the speed of construction matters. 24x40 steel cabin kits allow efficient assembly:

- **Prefabricated Components:** The steel structure comes pre-cut and ready to assemble, reducing construction time.
- **Less Labor Required:** Many kits can be put together with minimal labor, which often translates to quicker project completion.

Opting for a 24x40 steel cabin kit for your rural living solution combines sustainability, cost-effectiveness, and personalization. Whether you want a weekend getaway or a permanent residence, these cabins offer a comfortable, stylish, and practical option that seamlessly blends with nature. With their many advantages, you can confidently take the first step towards your rural dream home, nestled among the tranquil landscapes.

Design Ideas and Customization Options for Your Cozy Metal Home
---------------------------------------------------------------

Embracing the charm of rural living comes with its own unique set of possibilities, especially when it involves a cozy metal home. The idea of 24x40 steel cabin kits opens the door to customization and design freedom. Imagine a retreat where the warmth of home meets the durability and low maintenance of steel. Let’s explore how you can design and customize your cozy metal home to match your style and needs.

One of the biggest advantages of a 24x40 steel cabin is the flexibility it offers in terms of layout. This spacious design allows for various room configurations. You can opt for:

- **Open-Concept Living:** Combine your kitchen, dining, and living spaces for an airy, spacious feel.
- **Separate Rooms:** Divide the cabin into distinct areas for privacy and organization.
- **Multi-Purpose Spaces:** Create flexible rooms that can serve as offices, guest rooms, or hobby areas depending on your lifestyle.

When it comes to interior design, the metal structure serves as a beautiful backdrop for diverse styles. Industrial, rustic, modern farmhouse, or even minimalist aesthetics can thrive inside a steel cabin. Here are some interior ideas to inspire you:

- **Industrial Chic:** Embrace raw materials like exposed steel beams, concrete flooring, and reclaimed wood elements.
- **Cozy Rustic:** Use warm colors, soft fabrics, and wooden accents to create a traditional cabin feel.
- **Modern Minimalist:** Opt for sleek, simple furniture paired with large windows to bring in natural light.

Another key area of focus is the exterior design of your 24x40 steel cabin. The exterior can set the tone for your rural sanctuary. You can play with colors, finishes, and materials to elevate the look. Here are some ideas:

- **Color Choices:** Choose from a range of colors for the metal siding. Dark colors can provide a contemporary look, while lighter shades can blend seamlessly with the natural surroundings.
- **Porches and Decks:** Add a wrap-around porch for added outdoor space where you can enjoy evening sunsets or morning coffee.
- **Landscaping:** Surround your cabin with local plants and flowers to create a welcoming atmosphere.

Customization options go beyond aesthetics. You can also enhance your cabin’s functionality through upgrades. Consider the following:

- **Energy Efficiency:** Insulation and energy-efficient windows will reduce heating costs and keep your cabin comfortable year-round.
- **Smart Home Features:** Implement smart technology for lighting, heating, and security, making your cabin both modern and convenient.
- **Storage Solutions:** Built-in cabinets and multi-functional furniture can help maximize your space.

Lighting is crucial in setting the mood for any home. Think about:

- **Natural Light:** Large windows can flood your cabin with sunlight, making it feel warm and inviting.
- **Accent Lighting:** Use pendant lights, wall sconces, and table lamps to add warmth and enhance the decor.
- **Outdoor Lighting:** Highlight your landscaping and create a set mood for outdoor activities in the evening.

Don’t forget about your outdoor living spaces. Consider incorporating:

- **Fire Pits:** Perfect for storytelling and bonding with family and friends while enjoying the evening chill.
- **BBQ Areas:** An outdoor kitchen or grilling station can turn your cabin into a social hub during warm months.
- **Gardening Spaces:** Design a vegetable or flower garden to nurture your green thumb.

The 24x40 steel cabin kits offer endless possibilities for customization. Whether you are looking to create a permanent residence or a cozy getaway, the right design ideas can turn your metal home into a personalized sanctuary. With thoughtful planning and creativity, your cozy cabin can reflect your lifestyle and become a cherished part of your rural journey.

These cabins stand out for their durability, efficient use of space, and eco-friendly design, making them a practical choice for those seeking a cozy lifestyle in nature.

I’m both grateful and mildly gobsmacked to be inching up on 100 days sober. A small secular AA meeting played a huge part in getting me through those rocky first weeks. The people, their openness, humor, and blunt honesty kept me showing up.


I first stumbled into secular AA during inpatient, and it felt like someone cracked open a window in a stuffy room. The pace, the format, and the breezy “hi-and-bye” rhythm turned out to be perfect for this introverted, AuDHD gal who already treats leaving the house like a full-on heroic quest (never mind actually speaking in a group). The healthy sprinkle of cross-talk makes it feel less like your typical rigid “meeting,” and more like casual-yet-impactful coffee with friends. 


**Fair disclaimer:** I’m not sure all secular meetings are like this. So, results may vary.


I’ve been on a tiny hiatus from my regular secular meeting because of a schedule change, but looking forward to returning and seeing everyone again next week. Also very happy to find there’s a little nook here on Reddit for secular AA folks.

Yes. Figurines.

Bronze ones, stone ones, mythological ones, seagull-shaped ones. Some were barely knee-high, some were way taller than me, and all of them? 100% adorable.

What’s the deal with them? Many Polish cities sprinkle these little guys around town like Easter eggs — they’re part of official tourist trails, helping you explore the sights in the most whimsical way possible. Everyone knows the famous Wrocław dwarfs (there are nearly 1,000!), but I was on a mission to find the lesser-known stars. So I packed my little figurine passport/notebook (yes, that's a thing), grabbed a pen, and off I went!

Kraków kicked off my journey with a roar — literally. The legendary Wawel Dragon statue near the castle actually breathes fire every few minutes (please don’t ask how many times I waited to catch the perfect Instagram shot).

* 🥼 Doctor Dragon, complete with a stethoscope, giving a shoutout to the heroes in scrubs.
* 🎨 Painter Dragon, hanging out in Axentowicz Square, ready to critique your brushstrokes.

* 🍰 Michalina, chilling near Cafe Byfyj with coffee and cake. Same, girl.
* 🩺 Medyk, who dreams of being a doctor but still hates shots.

There are dozens of these mysterious munchkins lurking around the city — some hiding in windows, others climbing walls. Good luck spotting them all!

# 🐻 Łódź – A Cartoon-Lover’s Dream

If you're a fan of vintage animation (or just grew up watching Polish cartoons), Łódź is your spiritual homeland.

The Fairy Tale Trail features:

* 🧸 Miś Uszatek (Teddy Floppy-Ear) on Piotrkowska Street.
* 🐗 Ferdynand the Great, a pig with big dreams.
* 🐦 Wróbelek Ćwirek, the cheerful sparrow from your childhood.

You’ll even find Maurycy & Hawranek, classic cartoon buddies who look like they belong in a Looney Tunes x Eastern Europe crossover.

# 👼 Warsaw – Angels in the City

Warsaw’s figurines took a divine turn — quite literally. Around the city, you’ll find sculpted angels watching over everything from churches to cemeteries.

Highlights:

* 👼 The Guardian Angel by Roman Stańczak.
* 👼 The Angel of Hope in Powązki Cemetery.
* 🧜‍♀️ And of course, the iconic Mermaid of Warsaw guarding the Old Town Square with a sword, a shield, and serious main character energy.

# 🦁 Gdańsk – Lions, But Make Them Quirky

Say hello to the Hewelions — bronze lions scattered around Gdańsk, each one themed after a local profession or legend.

I met:

* 🧳 Hewelion the Tourist, who clearly packs better than I do.
* ⚙️ Hewelion the Shipyard Worker, repping Gdańsk’s maritime roots.
* 📊 Hewelion the Businessman, forever late for his next meeting.

Every single one is photogenic, sassy, and ready to pose.

# 🕊️ Kołobrzeg – Seagulls on a Mission

Seagulls don’t usually make for cuddly mascots... unless you’re in Kołobrzeg, where local artist Marian Wiśniewski turned them into local celebrities.

Meet:

* 🧺 Marian the Collector, hoarding seashells like a beachside dragon.
* 🏐 Marian the Volleyballer, mid-match on the promenade.
* 🛴 Marian the Scooter Rider, zipping past tourists like a feathered daredevil.

They’re EVERYWHERE, and each one is doing something funnier than the last.

# 🚰 Szczecin – Water Pumps with Personality

What’s that on the sidewalk? A 3-meter-tall Victorian water pump... with a dragon head spout?!

Szczecin is home to over 100 historic water pumps, lovingly called “berlinki.” They’re functional, majestic, and painted in all sorts of quirky colors. Some even have names, personalities, and (unofficially) favorite football teams.

It’s like stumbling on tiny pieces of steampunk art every few blocks.

# 🍷 Zielona Góra – Tiny Drunks with Big Wine Energy

Welcome to the home of Bachusiki — over 70 little statues of Bacchus (the Roman god of wine), scattered across Zielona Góra like confetti after a vineyard party.

Some memorable faces:

* 🚲 Transportikus, who pedals around wine barrels.
* 🔍 Ciekawek, who’s always eavesdropping.
* 🔥 Strażakus, the fireman Bachus keeping things safe and spirited.

There’s even a whole trail with maps, guides, and — if you’re lucky — wine tastings nearby.

# 🧙‍♂️ Wrocław – The Dwarf Capital of the World

You can’t talk figurines without bowing down to the Wrocław Dwarfs. There are now more than 600 (yes, SIX HUNDRED), scattered across benches, fountains, windows, doorframes — you name it.

https://preview.redd.it/mkawuskw4lbf1.png?width=986&format=png&auto=webp&s=216edf4ff48aa5dc01e0fa7431578b9ed944c03b

# 🦙 Opole – LLAMAS?!

Yup. You heard me. Opole went with llamas. Giant, colorful llama statues. Because why not?

They pop up in parks, town squares, and along rivers. I don’t know whose idea it was, but they deserve a raise.

https://preview.redd.it/43dmopb15lbf1.png?width=986&format=png&auto=webp&s=354c9814c74d4b0e56ca5bf7b2faaa51e7a316de

# 🐶 Bielsko-Biała – Cartoons Strike Again

My last stop was Bielsko-Biała, where the city pays homage to its animation roots with a fairy tale trail of its own.

Look out for:

* 🐕 Reksio, Poland’s favorite cartoon dog.
* 👦👦 Bolek and Lolek, the troublemaking duo.
* 🐸 Bartolini Bartłomiej, the mustachioed frog chef (yes, really).

The statues are full of charm and nostalgia — a perfect end to the figurine trail.

https://preview.redd.it/eqjmjpp65lbf1.png?width=986&format=png&auto=webp&s=c42d9462fba83f65cb34255f446d6694f4a021ed

Throughout my trip, I used a special collector’s booklet to mark each figurine I found — and collected official stamps at tourist offices like a proud Pokémon master.

https://preview.redd.it/0mwsausg5lbf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=51ce0e5e8be63555d0e3adb4fc5f9cda36b87b5c

If you love city walks, quirky stories, and the thrill of spotting tiny sculptures on a random building ledge, this kind of trip is pure gold.

Now go forth and hunt tiny dragons, sneaky dwarfs, seagulls on scooters, and whatever else Poland throws at you. Trust me — you’ll never look at sidewalks the same way again.

I'm 44, an engineer, a geek, and single. I'm very physically fit and somewhat muscular except for my face which shows age. I've done nothing but work for the last 20 years. I dress very well. I shave my head. I have a stable job and a history of relatively large work projects. I've achieved a lot.

I love coffee, 80s and 90s music, and walking. I also enjoy reading. I have a sense of odd humour. I was a fan of the early Family Guy seasons.

I won't beat around the bush. I'm looking for a lady 35+ for a long distance relationship. 

Send a message if this is something you can commit to. I'll send one in exchange. I have the means to travel (when on vacation from work) and I live a very peaceful and comfortable life. I'm open to moving in together so it won't be long-distance for the rest of eternity. I've travelled a lot and flights feel the same as bus trips to me. Most places I've been to, even if visually different, have felt and looked the same to me.

\- Be 35+ years old so we are from the same generation.

\- I would rather be with someone who doesn't identify by opinions on any political, social, religious, or cultural matters. I'm a very culturally neutral person myself. I'm a Muslim and I would like that you are so as well.

\- It is best if you are GMT-3 to GMT+8, otherwise it will be difficult.

\- Most importantly, don't ask why I am single. I have very valid reasons.

\- I appreciate women with strong personalities.

Please only send a message if you are single and interested in the same thing. Also make sure you are able to hold a conversation since that is a main criteria and you are willing to move to a voice/video chat platform soon",1,1751952608.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

Posting this one here just to get a few opinions, apologies if there is a bit of back and forth below.

TLDR : Went on a date with someone, overall really good vibes and had a good time. Date agreed to go out for another time and texted her but have not got a reply. Did I mess up?

About early June this year, I have matched with a girl on an online dating app, we started texting each other bit by bit (she did took her time to reply, so essentially we didn't text that much, I'm pretty much fine with this fact, everyone got their own life and shit to deal with).

After a week of texting on the dating app, i don't know what got into me but I just casually texted her through the app asking if she wants to meet out for a coffee. She never replied on the dating app, I can also see that she never opened the dating app (The app allows you to see when is the last the person is online on the app.) 

At that point I was thinking like oh well, I tried, let's move on.

Well.... about 3 weeks later, she texted me back on the app, apologizing about the late in responses, agreeing to meet up and gave me her number as she doesn't open the app much anymore. So I got her number and we managed to lock in a time for a coffee date, we texted a bit here and there along the way but it's just to discuss where do we want to go and such

Few days before the coffee date, she sent me a link to an art exhibition at the local museum, I took that as meaning that she wanted to go there, so we end up getting tickets for that art exhibition after the coffee date. 

On the morning of the date, as I was getting ready, she texted me asking if we could go together to the local museum (she was planning to just walk to the cafe and I already told her that I will be driving before). I end up picking her up from her house.

The date overall went... really nice, really good vibes in general. Both of us didn't really look at our phones, time just went past so quick , went for a drink after the art exhibition, sent her home afterwards .

In general, I thought that we had a good time during the date, which she agreed to as well, and it seems like she is open to another date, we even sort of decided where do we want to go next. I texted her when I got home to try and set a time for the next date, but have not got a reply since.

Others need the mild panic of a deadline breathing down their neck to feel alive,. I’m very much among the others — my best work happens somewhere between “mild anxiety” and “backside on fire.” Thanks adult ADHD!

Of course the idea is to be more mindful, develop discipline, and not need the 6th cup of coffee to keep going.

I’m currently working on two major goals:

1. Building and launching my business. I have self respect and refuse to call it a startup (soon rather than eventually).
2. Getting my health and fitness in order (also sooner rather than later).

I’m not unmotivated, I just put the *pro* in procrastinator. Also, I tend to mask my character flaws with a fair bit of humor. Consider this full disclosure.

While I respond better to the stick than the carrot, I’m happy to be the kind of accountability partner *you* need — cheerleader, drill sergeant, or just someone to check in with. In a previous life (non-startup), I led teams that consistently performed well, so I know how to push for results — including yours, if you’re up for it.

Ideally, we’d check in daily or a few times a week, share progress, set micro-goals, and call each other out when needed.

DM if you’re interested. Happy to work across time zones, though IST preferred for simplicity.

1lugeoq,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lugeoq/i_work_as_a_librarian_in_the_old_town_library_we/,I Work as a Librarian in the Old Town Library - We Were Returned a Book That Shouldn’t Exist [Part 1],"I have now worked for a week in my new job at the old city library-and a creeping suspicion has taken hold of me that this library conceals far more than meets the eye.

But I should start at the beginning.

My name is Clara. I am thirty-four years old and recently moved to this town to take up the position of the new librarian in the city’s ancient library.

This town is exactly what I had hoped for: small, silent, quaint. Cobblestone streets, houses with wooden shutters, a marketplace where merchants peddle various wares. Few people live here directly; most commute from surrounding villages. As a result, the streets often seem empty-even at midday.

Still, those I have met have been kind. Reserved, yes, but warm enough to feel welcome.

The job posting for the library came at just the right time.

I had recently ended a long-term relationship and found myself slipping into a kind of dark hole-not deep, but dark enough to make me realize I needed change. My old life no longer fit me. My friends were there, trying to help, but I felt the need to distance myself. A real fresh start. A place where I could breathe again.

When I saw the listing for the library-unassuming, without even a logo-I wasn’t sure if it was still valid. But I applied immediately. After a brief phone interview, I got the job. Three weeks later, I was here.

The library itself lies on the edge of the old town, it itself is old, beautiful, and seems somehow out of time-much like the town it inhabits.

It is an austere rectangular structure of dark sandstone, with tall rounded windows and a bell tower long since silenced. I was told it once belonged to the old university, which has since moved to a modern new building on the other side of town. Since then, it has been a public library, open to anyone who finds their way here.

The entrance is formed by two heavy wooden doors with wrought-iron handles. They are difficult to open-and even harder to close when alone.

On my first day, I arrived far too early. I had barely slept as I had always been nervous on “first days,” whether at school or in previous jobs. Thus, I found myself standing outside the building half an hour before opening. 

The heavy doors resisted opening, and their hinges groaned loudly.

I looked around. A short corridor led from the entrance into the heart of the building.

On the left wall, several lockers were lined up-available to visitors for a small fee, to store bags, coats, or simply to free one’s hands.

Next to them stood two old-fashioned vending machines: one for coffee, the other for soda and snacks. Their hum was the only sound breaking the silence.

At the end of the corridor, the space opened wide and tall, dominated by endless bookshelves.

In the center stood the reception-a wooden podium with a gently curved counter jutting into the room like the helm of an ancient ship.

The shelves were divided by genre: fiction, history, philosophy, novels of many sorts. Many books were yellowed, their spines brittle, as if they had waited decades to be read. Between the shelves were open spaces with tables, chairs, and computers-modern, yet oddly out of place. The gray monitors and keyboards seemed alien amidst the dark wood and aged leather-bound volumes.

Behind the counter was a narrow staircase to the upper floor. The railing was wrought iron, black and ornately decorated, yet worn at the edges-as if it had been grasped by more hands than one could count.

The floor was dark wood-polished glassy in some places, dull and dust-filled in others. Light streamed in at a slant through the tall windows, revealing dust motes floating like ghosts. The scent was of old wood, leather, and paper-a smell I loved, one that always comforted me.

Behind the counter stood a woman scanning a stack of books. When she noticed me, she laid the book and scanner aside and approached.

She was perhaps in her late fifties, hair pulled back tightly, gray, with a gaze that immediately reminded me of my old English teacher-only wearier.

“You’re early,” she said, neither smiling nor reproaching. “That’s good.”

She scrutinized me briefly, then extended a bony hand.

“My name is Brandt.” A faint smile touched her lips. “Nice to meet you.” 

“Clara,” I said quietly, returning her handshake. “Likewise, Mrs. Brandt,” I added awkwardly. I was never good at these moments.

“I’m glad you could come so quickly,” she said, turning back to the reception and beckoning me to follow.

“Since Mrs. Langley retired, the work here has piled up.”

She picked up the scanner again and resumed scanning books.

“Do you know how this works?”

She paused, looking at me with a mixture of patience and expectation.

“Yes, I have several years of experience as a librarian in my old town,” I replied.

“Oh, yes, I remember our conversation,” she murmured softly. “Excuse me. I’m not as young as I used to be and start forgetting things.” She stepped aside. “Come here. I’ll show you how our system works.”

I obeyed and stepped forward.

She scanned the book in her hand-a worn copy of *Moby Dick*—and pointed to the screen. “Here you see all the info you need: title, ISBN, which shelf and floor it belongs to, who borrowed it, and whether it was returned on time. You’re probably familiar with this.”

“Yes, we had a very similar system at my old library,” I said, relieved I wouldn’t have to learn a strange new program.

“That’s good,” Brandt sighed. “Let me briefly explain how your day usually goes.”

She pointed to a small slip pinned behind the counter.

“We officially open at nine, but I’m usually here half an hour earlier. Every evening, we empty the return box”-she gestured to a black, waist-high metal box by the counter-“and place the books here. First thing in the morning, we scan them, check for damage, and place them on carts sorted by floor.” If there’s a lot, it takes time.

I nodded.

“Mornings are quiet. Mostly pensioners or people studying for exams. That’s when we handle internal tasks: catalog maintenance, emails, orders.”

She paused and continued.

“Afternoons are busier. That’s when our part-timer, Lena, arrives to help. Sometimes we host events: readings, children’s groups, school classes.”

“Sounds doable,” I said.

“It is, once you get used to the silence.”

She smiled faintly.

“I’ll show you the library in more detail now. Come,” she said, grabbing an old, heavy keyring that clinked softly.

She stepped behind the counter, and I followed her through the narrow aisles between shelves.

The wood beneath our steps creaked softly, almost like a whisper. Between shelves were cozy nooks with old leather chairs and reading lamps casting dim pools of light.

The whole space was permeated by that scent I’d loved since childhood: dusty paper, old leather, a hint of dried ink. It smelled of… knowledge. And time.

“Most visitors stay down here,” Brandt said. “Upstairs are mostly reference books. Sometimes a student wanders up, but rarely anyone else.”

We turned back toward the reception, and she pointed to a door beside the main staircase-one I hadn’t noticed before.

A narrow metal frame painted a dull gray, with a small, worn button beside it.

“Thank God they installed this a few years ago,” she muttered, pressing the button. A mechanical beep sounded-too loud and new for this place.

The elevator shuddered to a stop and the doors slid open quietly.

“We used to carry all the books up and down by hand. For hours. Then they wanted to make the building accessible-at least they managed that.”

The elevator’s interior was tight, walls of cold metal. When the doors closed, I felt oddly cut off from the rest of the library.

The ride was short, but felt longer than it should.

At the top, the doors opened with a muted click. The light was dimmer here-heavy burgundy curtains covered the windows, letting only narrow strips of daylight through.

The shelves stood closer together, no computers in sight. Only books, as far as the eye could see. And that silence-dense, almost tangible.

“I like it up here,” Brandt said, her voice softening. “It’s quieter. When it’s slow, I sometimes sit in one of the chairs and read.”

She laughed briefly, but it sounded more like a confession.

Brandt stepped back into the elevator.

“Now I’ll show you the break room-if you want to call the old broom closet that—and then the archive. After that, you’ll have seen everything.”

Back downstairs, Brandt turned toward a door hidden behind one of the tall shelves. I hadn’t noticed it before-half concealed in shadow, as if deliberately overlooked.

With a practiced twist, she opened the heavy wooden door, which creaked softly but insistently.

A narrow stone stairwell was revealed. The walls rough, the floor worn. A spiral staircase wound both up and down. The air was cooler, drier-tinged with metal and dust.

Brandt raised a finger, pointing upward.

“That leads to the clock tower. We don’t need to go there. Technicians sometimes come to check the mechanism… luckily none of our concern.”

Just below the first step was a second narrow door. She opened it with a quiet click, and I stepped inside a tiny room.

“Our break room,” she said with a trace of irony.

The space was barely bigger than a storage closet. A small round table stood askew in the center, flanked by two wobbly chairs with threadbare cushions. On the table sat an old kettle stained with limescale, a jumble of yellowed tea boxes, loose sugar, and a glass holding stirrers. On an open shelf rested a mismatched collection of cups.

On the wall hung a faded poster with italicized lettering:

*“Reading is like traveling—only without luggage.”*

“Here you can take your lunch break,” Brandt said plainly.

I merely nodded and backed out. She closed the door, and we turned toward the stairs leading down.

The steps sounded dull, like soft stone worn by time itself.

At the foot of the stairs, the air grew noticeably cooler. It smelled of dust, cardboard, and the faintly sweet scent of aged paper.

Brandt stopped before a plain metal door and retrieved another key. The lock squeaked as she turned it, and the door opened with a heavy metallic groan.

“Welcome to the archive,” she said softly, more explanatory than inviting.

Inside it was dark.

A single light switch stood beside the doorframe. When she flicked it, two old bulbs flickered to life with a soft click-one directly above us, the other farther back. Their light was warm but weak, flickering as if struggling through layers of dust and age. The glow pushed feebly through the shadows; the shelves cast long, tangled silhouettes that seemed to breathe.

The room was larger than I had expected.

Rows of tall metal shelves lined the walls, forming a corridor between. They were packed with archive boxes, folders, old books in protective covers and bound volumes of journals.

In a corner stood an old wooden table with a stack of forms. Next to it, a clipboard with a pen tethered by string. An empty book cart leaned nearby.

“We keep everything here that’s rarely used or not needed at constant reach,” Brandt explained. Her voice echoed softly between the shelves.

“Old files, out-of-print works, reference books almost never borrowed… things like that. If you’re looking for something not found upstairs, it might be here.”

I nodded slowly.

The bulb above us hummed quietly, and somewhere a shelf creaked, as if the wood itself were breathing.

“If you need to shelve books or have leftover returns at day’s end, there’s plenty of room here.”

She looked at me.

“But don’t worry. You won’t need to come down here often-only when we rearrange or have a big return.”

We went back upstairs, and leaving the stairwell, I felt as though I’d just surfaced from deep water.

A subtle pressure I hadn’t realized weighed on me lifted suddenly-I drew in a breath as if I had forgotten to breathe down below.

Back at the counter, Brandt wordlessly returned to the stack of books she’d been working on. With practiced motion, she placed them on a metal cart already holding several volumes.

She nudged the cart slightly toward me; its wheels squeaked softly on the wood.

“So,” she said briskly. “Get to shelving these.”

She gestured to the upper and lower rows.

“The books upstairs belong downstairs, and those downstairs to the second floor. Take your time-it’s the best way to familiarize yourself with the layout.”

I nodded, resting a hand on the cart’s cool metal. It felt somehow solemn-like the moment I truly began working here.

Brandt returned to the counter, turned the monitor toward herself, and pulled the keyboard closer.

“If you need help-I’m here. I’ll check what organizational tasks we have.”

I set to work-and for the first time that day, I felt a calm, almost comforting focus.

Morning slipped away quickly.

I shelved books, learned the library better, and began to feel comfortable.

At noon, I ventured to a small shop opposite the library, grabbing a simple sandwich and hot coffee.

Though I’d tried the library’s coffee earlier, I preferred the real thing-the fresh brew that still smelled of roasted beans and warmth.

Shortly after midday, our part-timer Lena arrived.

Brandt introduced her: a pretty young woman, no older than twenty-three. She was a student, working afternoons to support her studies.

She reminded me of myself at that age-dark hair, brown eyes, and a smile that always seemed brightest.

The rest of the day, she helped me with various tasks, and together we managed the workload.

As the day wound down, the last visitors left, and the cleaners departed, Brandt showed me how to close properly.

“Always walk through the library once more to make sure everyone’s gone,” she said calmly.

Before leaving, she handed me a small bunch of keys.

“These are all the important keys you’ll need. Please take good care of them.”

I thanked her, promised to be careful, and we parted ways.

At home, I ate a light meal. After a hot, soothing shower, I slipped into bed with a pleasant feeling of satisfaction.

I liked my new job. I looked forward to the next day.

The first week passed faster than expected. Days filled with routine: shelving books, processing loans, answering questions. Each day, the library felt less foreign, the halls less strange-and I began to feel truly at home.

Yet there were small, almost imperceptible moments that made me pause. A whisper perhaps, heard only in my mind; a subtle shift in the atmosphere that defied explanation.

For instance, the ticking of the old grandfather clock on the top floor. A grand, stately clock whose steady click filled the upper room soothingly when quiet. Once, as I was shelving books and heading down, I passed the clock and glanced at it-only to notice it had stopped but was still making ticking sounds. I told myself the clock was likely still working but the mechanism moving the hands was broken. After all, it was very old. And I continued my day as usual.

Sometimes the air in one reading nook felt colder than it reasonably could be, despite the warm spring day outside. I pulled my jacket tighter and pushed the thoughts aside.

There were fleeting shadows too-out of the corner of my eye-swift movements vanishing whenever I turned. No person, no bird, no stray cat that might have slipped in.

One late evening, after emptying the return box, I heard a dull thud from inside-as if someone were inside knocking once. I opened it and peered in-nothing. I shut the lid firmly and convinced myself it was just in my imagination

I also noticed some books had shifted overnight-small shelves moved, titles misplaced. Brandt waved it off, saying the cleaners or visitors caused it. “It happens here,” she said casually.

I wanted to believe it, but the feeling of being watched lingered. Whenever I was alone in the library, I sensed a barely tangible gaze upon me. I turned, looking down empty aisles and silent shelves. No one was there.

These small oddities were like tiny cracks in the mirror of my new routine-barely visible, yet unmistakably present. I tried to ignore them and focus on work. After all, I was here to start fresh.

The incident that compelled me to write these lines occurred in the last two days.

Yesterday evening, Lena and I were the only ones in the library, closing up. She was upstairs switching off the lights when I suddenly heard that dull noise again from the return box.

Curious, I went to it and looked inside. There lay a book.

This confused me deeply. I had emptied the box less than ten minutes before.

Slowly, I pulled the book out and examined it. It was bound in black leather, old and heavy. But the strangest thing was the completely blank cover: no library sticker, no ISBN label, no title-nothing.

But that was not all.

The book felt unusually warm, as if it contained its own source of heat. I raised it to my face and sniffed. It smelled of old leather and paper, like all the other books here. But there was something else, a sharp metallic tang that made me shudder.

No other book I had touched this week smelled like that.

Uncertain, I didn’t know what to do. Then Lena came down the stairs. She smiled, but when she saw my puzzled face, her expression twisted into confusion.

“Is something wrong, Clara?” she asked gently.

“I… found this book in the return box,” I whispered.

“Okay? And what’s wrong with it? Is it damaged?” Lena stepped closer, eyes fixed on the book.

“No, but I don’t think it belongs here.” I handed it to her. She turned it over, searching for an ISBN as I had before. “Strange,” she muttered.

“What do we do with it?” I asked.

“I’d say we just put it in the archive,” Lena replied, handing it back.

Then she glanced at her watch and flinched.

“Is it okay if I leave now? I’m meeting some friends to study and I’m late.”

I nodded. ""Sure. Have a good night"" I said and tried to smile at her. ""You too. See you tomorrow"" she answered, grabbed her jacket and left.

Alone, I headed to the archive.

As I descended, the air grew heavier; shadows thickened. A suffocating silence wrapped around me, and I felt as if unseen eyes watched.

For the first time, an irresistible compulsion seized me-to open the book. I felt a peculiar tug, as though an unseen hand compelled me, urging my fingers to pry it open. A strange tingling crept over my skin, and the metallic scent wafted upward, sharp and biting like cold iron against my nostrils.

With trembling care, I parted the pages and began to read.

The narrative described a woman named Sarah, seated alone in an office before her computer. Each scene was rendered with unnerving precision-her emotions, her thoughts, even the smallest gestures of her hands were chronicled in painstaking detail.

Page after page unfolded mundane moments of Sarah’s existence-the way she held a cup of coffee, the conversations she engaged in-each fragment strangely vivid, as if the very essence of her life had been distilled onto the parchment.

A creeping confusion gnawed at me. Never before had I encountered a book so obsessively focused, so disquietingly intimate.

Who, I wondered, would desire to read such a thing?

Turning to the last described page, the scene ended with Sarah preparing a meal. Beyond this, the pages remained blank, though ample unmarked space stretched before me, mocking in its emptiness.

With every passing second, the sensation of unseen eyes watching me grew more intense, pressing upon my mind like a tangible weight. Hastily, I snapped the book shut.

From within its confines arose a cold breath of air, more metallic and acrid than before, curling upward as if exhaling from some abyssal source.

I placed the book upon the table, retrieved a scrap of paper, and inscribed a terse note: “Unknown book found in return box. - Clara.”

Diligently, I affixed the note to the cover, fetched one of the ancient archival boxes from the shelf, and slid the book inside.

Having returned the box to its place, I extinguished the light and left the archive with quickened steps.

As I moved through the silent corridors, the oppressive feeling of being observed weighed heavily upon me.

When I closed the heavy doors of the library behind me, a fleeting relief washed over me.

Yet the suffocating sensation lingered, trailing me all the way home and refusing to release its grip within the solitude of my apartment.

That night, sleep eluded me. Time and again, my thoughts returned obsessively to the book.

One aspect troubled me above all: though the volume was undeniably old-likely over fifty years-its contents portrayed a modern existence. Sarah worked at computers, watched television, lived as we do now.

How could this be?

I struggled to banish the thought and turned on the television. Eventually, exhaustion claimed me, and I slipped into uneasy slumber.

The next morning found me steadier, composed once more.

I prepared myself and set out for work.

The book had nearly faded from my memory.

I was the first to arrive at the library so I switched on the computers and lights, got me a coffee from the vending machine, and began to scan the books we had prepared the previous evening.

Halfway through the first stack, a sudden chill raced down my spine and I stopped dead in my tracks.

Amid the pile-where it was impossible anyone could have disturbed the order overnight-there lay the black book once more.

With trembling hands, I lifted it and opened the cover.

Something was different.

It felt older, heavier, as if it had gained weight in the night.

I turned to the final page-and my breath caught in my throat.

The last scene no longer showed Sarah preparing food.

Now she sat at a desk at work, staring out the window.

The book... had continued writing itself.

She’s never been the type to chase the spotlight. Red carpets, curated stories, flashing cameras—none of that was ever her. She’s the girl behind the scenes: the one who brings him coffee after eighteen-hour days in the studio, the one who tucks love notes into his bags before he flies across the world, the one who stays silent when the tabloids pair him with someone else yet again. She’s known him longer than the world has—before the fame, the tours, the ego. And somewhere along the way, she fell in love with the boy he used to be when no one else was watching.

But somewhere along the way, she became invisible.

The story begins on her birthday—a regular Tuesday for him. She doesn’t expect much; she never has. Just a few hours, maybe a walk, maybe a movie on the couch like they used to do before his phone never stopped buzzing. She doesn’t say it outright. She never demands. She just smiles, quiet as ever, and suggests, *“Maybe when you’re done at the studio… we could just do something. Anything, really.”* But he brushes her off, distracted, already halfway out the door.

She doesn’t cry—not at first. She just sits in the quiet, one hand resting on her belly—a new secret, just starting to show. A life growing inside her. His child. And she wonders if he’ll even notice when she’s gone. Because she’s not angry—just tired. Tired of being a second thought in a world she never wanted to compete with. Tired of giving everything and getting almost nothing in return.

**What I’m Looking For:**  
I’m searching for someone to write the role of the celebrity in this emotional, slow-burn story about love, and neglect.. Your character could be a musician, actor, influencer—whatever feels right. The key is that he’s lost in his own world, too caught up in the demands of his fame to see how much he’s hurting the only person who’s never wanted anything from him but love.

1lugc62,https://www.reddit.com/r/MuslimLounge/comments/1lugc62/muzzmatch_1_year_ended/,"Muzzmatch, 1 year ended.","
I 24F 🇵🇭 and him 29M 🇹🇷 living in Australia has officially ended things. Im a converted muslim and I went on Muzzmatch cause I want to find a man who has the same intention and would help my religion. I found him, I talked to many also but him and I clicked, we talked a while in WA and decided to delete muzz and focus on each other. I did so thinking this is good for my Deen, at the same time I didn’t wanna upset him.

Early in the relationship he was already so jealous about everything and I always just assure him, there would come a point where in he would get mad why it took me 5hrs to shop in the mall with my girlfriends and he would think I was out on a date. I would always need to tell him what and where I am going and what I will do, and even send selfies to show him truly I was with a “female”-friend, he didn’t like the idea of me having male friends even though i did, i cut them all off to not make him feel insecure. So many things that I did so we can be in a peaceful union, I did all these not because I was forced to do so, it wasn’t like that, I did it so that he won’t get upset and I don’t want him to feel bad, I want him to be at peace with me also.  

I went on with my life, I am an English Teacher at the same time a mechanical engineer, my days are busy but I make time, we would talk about what we want and where this relationship is going, met the parents and set timelines when to close the gap, leading to marriage. We weren’t doing anything sexual, just cute kisses and I love yous, truly I felt it was okay. 

The relationship was very difficult for me, there are times I keep praying that this all stops as its so unhealthy for me, one time we broke up (9months in the relationship) cause he said like he is not ready for a relationship and he didn’t see a future with me as I’m living in a different country and he also can’t come visit me cause he took an “Asylum/Protected Visa” in Australia and that bans him from flying out for the next 3 years, I understood this and so I told him I will go to him. I saved up and that was the plan, we broke up still cause he doesn’t want me to just “visit” he wanted me to live in Australia. And he didn’t see a way for me to do so, I respected this, said my goodbye, cried my heart out and didn’t work for the whole day. 12hrs after, at 3am in the morning he called me, on video—we always video call and sleep together, this night we didn’t cause we broke up 12hrs ago, and then suddenly he rang me and I picked up and I was dumbfounded whats happening, and he said 

“I’m having a panic attack, I’m scared, sleep with me please.” And so we did, for the next 4hrs we did, I hung up when I needed to go to work in the morning and saw that he was fast asleep, I was confused what happened. After work, I confronted him about it, asked him if he is now okay and what was that? And he said “I can’t without you, let’s try again.”

So that’s when we thought of the Student Visa pathway, I can live in Australia for 3yrs then would work and its a while process until I can also get PR, and be there with him. This was the plan and I have this put into action, then I found out it will cost me $70000 to even just go and apply, $17k for just one sem in Masters, and this was too much money, I told him its too much and I don’t have that amount, my dad offered to pawn our house and car, so to really help me—-he btw made it clear he couldn’t help me financially as he himself was also unstable working in a kbab shop with a car to pay monthly and rent to pay weekly. This was okay for me, I also didn’t expect money from him, I can ask my family for it. 


I told him about this and he felt bad but said we would go through it together, we will save up, we will find a way—then 2hrs later he blamed me saying Im lying for such amount, that Im making all these numbers up, that its impossible for this much of money just to go study in Australia 🇦🇺 . I showed him agency quotations and told him its cause of my country, etc. he wouldn’t believe me and told me I wasted his time, promising him I will go see him when I actually couldn’t. Once again, I was hurt and confused and just felt so lost. At that time I said, okay no more, enough, I got angry later on cause he accused me of trying to “scam him money” simply cause most Filipinas do 🇵🇭 and that’s why I got mad, cause I never even asked him for 1$, not even anything. I told him, we can break up but don’t say things that aren’t true. 

Which is funny cause he was actually the one who borrowed money from me (600$) cause he needed to pay it for car insurance for uber, and he asked from me knowing that 600$ is a months worth of salary for me for him its 2 days. 🥲 I gave ofc.


He must’ve felt guilty and apologized and once again told me his love and all those, at this point I was already scared for my life, honestly I was more scared if the relationship will continue like this and were online now, what will happen when we live together? How will he react? But I brushed off those thoughts away, I have been with this man for almost a year now, and were talking about marriage, I can’t poison my mind like this. 


We got back together again and promised to meet each other in a years time when I actually have saved up money, also I put my farm into action, I planted coffee beans so in a yrs time after harvest I would generate amount and it will help my finances, at the same time I made investments, plus sent job applications to anything engineering related and got more hours for my teaching job online. I was really doing everything, canceled all my digital subscriptions and tried everything in my might to save up money. 


Then 10 days ago, he demanded for my Whatsapp account and I couldn’t give it, its mine. He said he won’t be able to marry me if I won’t give it to him, I asked him if he’s sure about what he said, and he said yes. And so I broke up with him. I don’t have anything in my WhatsApp btw, Im not cheating nor hiding a second bf whatever, but I didn’t want to give it to him cause I want him to trust me, trust isnt “knowing everything” trust is not knowing everything but believing the person won’t do anything bad cause you genuinely believes she’s good and you love her.

I was the one who broke up but its hurting me so much, but at the same time I feel relieved, today, I sent him my final message as a goodbye and I said everything in my heart, he said “Thank you too, all the best.” And thats how our story ended. 

I loved him so much, I was even getting used to his commands and I’m like walking on eggshells around him, it was truly a toxic relationship but I stayed, thinking not all relationships are perfect. I needed to write all these, so others would know when to let go unlike me, learn from my nativity. 

For all the LDRs out there, I truly believe you guys, it’s not love not the distance making it difficult, the right person will be patient. 

For anyone asking, no I don’t hate him, I am maybe just a person who can’t really hold hatred cause it tires me and I feel like it poisons my body. I don’t hate him, I however wish that he could’ve dated me when he was ready for a relationship, the way that he behaved in the relationship given that he’s 29, 4yrs older than me, he displayed behaviors as if he’s never been in a relationship before, and that’s not his fault really. 

It is so painful and I feel so lost and used and betrayed, he was the one who wanted me, now its over. This is Allah’s will, it is painful and I don’t understand it but Alhamdulilah, always.

Where I live tournaments can have start times ranging from 18.00 to 21.45. Anywhere untill 20.00 I'm usually good but once the match start times gets closer to 21.00 I get in this mindset that it's late and I'm feeling sluggish. It doesn't help that at around 19.30 I'm done putting the kids to sleep and bridging the time between that and 21.00 has me chilling on the couch and getting from that into an energetic mindset is difficult.

So how do you guys deal with this? What are your go-to's for starting late night matches with proper energy?

It’s a campfire for the stories behind the art. Post that lopsided ceramic mug you made in your first pottery class, the one that leaks but reminds you, “I showed up.” Share the playlist you listened to while painting that abstract chaos (“Angsty Taylor Swift + acrylics = my weirdly healing breakup piece”). Vent about the photography project that flopped—“Why do my sunsets look like mud?”—then laugh when someone replies, “Mud’s underrated. My first self-portrait looked like a potato, and now I sell prints.” Geek out over the “almosts”: the song that took 6 months to write but still has a wonky chorus, the novel chapter you scrapped but can’t stop thinking about, the dance routine that fell apart in rehearsal but taught you more than perfection ever could.​Here, growth is the medium. Celebrate the small sparks: finally nailing that watercolor technique after 50 failed attempts, a friend saying, “This poem makes me feel seen,” a stranger commenting, “I hate my art too—want to commiserate over coffee?” Art isn’t about being “good” here. It’s about being human—the frustration, the breakthroughs, the days you want to quit but pick up the brush anyway.​So bring the half-finished, the “I’m embarrassed but here goes,” the “this is messy but it’s mine.” We’ll cheer for your progress, swap tips (“Try this brush—saved my watercolor disasters”), and remind you: the journey’s the art. Your story—stumbles, detours, and all—is what makes your work unforgettable. Welcome.

1lug6uv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Colognes/comments/1lug6uv/tried_the_gentleman_society_line_today_here_are/,Tried the Gentleman Society line today. Here are my thoughts...,"Hey guys, I had some free time today so I headed to a Macy's to try out the Gentleman Society fragrances. I thought I'd share my notes because I don't see too much mention of these scents here. Plz understand that these are essentially first impressions. Here are my quick thoughts:

Gentleman Society: A very simple aromatic and woody scent. The woodiness has a very slight dark facet. I couldn't really spot too much of a ""Gentleman"" resemblance in this one. It might be because of a lack of iris or that signature ""creaminess."" I found this one to be a bit boring tbh. It's definitely not bad. It's very pleasant but slightly bland and uninspired. It was one-dimensional and didn't have anything too interesting about it. I don't think I would reach for it given the other bottles I have. It can make for a solid versatile signature scent for someone who wants a ""one bottle does it all"" type of deal. It isn't overly heavy or sweet for the warmer weather and isn't offensive for the office. A pass for me right now but I might revisit it in the future. 6/10

Society Ambree: I was expecting this one to be very different from the rest of the line given the notes and the YouTube reviews I watched. In all honesty, it just came across like a very smokey and woodier take on Reserve Privee. None of the reviews I saw compared this one to Reserve Privee (it was usually compared to Dior Homme and TF Tobacco Vanille) but that was the immediate thing that came to mind. It has a bit of sweetness to it but not nearly as much as I had expected. This is my first sample so I haven't really deciphered all the notes yet but right now, to me, it just smells like a incense-y (not even tobacco) and darker version of Reserve Privee. They should have named it Society Incense imo. As a younger guy, I can appreciate this scent and I think it smells really good but IDK that I would get much wear out of it. It's a bit too dark and mature-smelling for my lifestyle. I wish the amber was more pronounced and the tobacco wasn't so smokey. I do like it, though. I might get a decant. 7.5/10

Society Extreme: This one was my clear favorite. The opening was really nice with a fresh mint and warm spice combo. More sweet than the other two but not cloying at all. A lot of people said this one is redundant and overly similar to the OG Society but sampling them side-by-side, I found there to be a good amount of differences. As it dried down, the floral and coffee notes came out. The coffee is definitely detectable but not too prominent as a focal note. It had a frothy semi-sweet smell as opposed to a bitter darkness. I do wish there was a little more coffee. Despite all the heavy and deep notes in the note breakdown, it maintained a somewhat diffusive nature. I really enjoy this and if it continues to grow on me, I'll def get a full bottle. I think this is right up there with Reserve Privee as the best from the line. 9/10

It’s routine for me to stumble through the house to quickly eat something while laying down on the floor for 10 minutes because I feel so faint. And it physically hurts trying to swallow solid food again after forcing myself to function on cups of coffee. I try to convince myself it’s good because that pain means I’m restricting well and losing weight but it’s such a horrible feeling. 

The thoughts are worse. It’s like I can’t think about anything else until I lose. I’m either so hungry I can’t think of anything else besides food or being so guilty that I ate food and all I can think about is not eating. Losing weight is a higher priority than school right now in my head, which I am failing. 

I’ve been suffering for so long with the physical and mental side effects of restricting. Sometimes the food thoughts are so invasive I can’t even sleep at night. But the thing is I’ve been losing the same weight over and over for the last 2-3 years because, surprise, having an ed is not the same when you’re a teen and you can just starve and over-exercise and pace around the house for days without too many responsibilities. So I can’t help but ask myself what am I doing? What’s the point? I think high school me had an answer, but now I’m just stuck in this cycle. 

I miss being able to just eat. I miss enjoying eating out with my family or feeling happy when they surprise me food and not panic or feel anger. Not constantly thinking about calories.

Bright’s mission is to be your last health app.

Over the past few years, we’ve exclusively focused on building this super app for health. Now we’re entering the next chapter, one where Bright connects not just with individuals, but with the broader health ecosystem.

The first generation of health apps were digital silos, isolated datasets of lifestyle, clinical, genetic and wearable data. The meal-logging apps, the sleep trackers and so on.

We’re now at the second generation of apps - super apps. These consolidate the silos of data into one connected mosaic: habits, behaviours, diagnostics, and DNA all brought together in a single, high-fidelity, longitudinal record. Bright is leading this new generation.

https://preview.redd.it/ryzqgcqg0lbf1.png?width=3368&format=png&auto=webp&s=f64be960de2cbdeddf07a73656c72c15266a09de

In the same way that Stripe became the technical layer for online banking, we see Bright becoming the healthtech backbone connecting consumer and clinical health.

Over the past few months, Bright has been working with gyms, meal kit providers, medical clinics, laboratories, healthcare providers and hospitals from the Americas, Europe, Asia and Australia to create the Developer APIs that are needed.

So next week, we’ll be releasing Early Access to our Developer APIs meaning will be able to programmatically access:

* Bright’s core widgets like Meal Logging,  Barcode/Image Scanning, Sleep & Recovery Scores, and more totalling over 300 endpoints at A$0.0005/request via REST APIs,
* Integrate with Garmin, Oura, Whoop and more at $0 per wearable,
* And users with an active subscription will be able to manage their own data through standard CRUD operations.

This infrastructure layer completes the first phase of our creating a consolidated data funnel. The first step was building a super app for health and the final step is unlocking the app so others can stream data into it.

You can read more about that journey [here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/5-years-crossing-death-valley-bryan-jordan-8pfxc).

After the data-funnel, comes Personalised Health Guidance (PHG). While most apps today rely on generic, surface-level advice from LLMs like “avoid coffee before bed”, “walk 10,000 steps” etc., we believe the next leap is meaningful and actionable guidance that users actually commit to - something only possible with a complete dataset and global, scalable infrastructure.

https://preview.redd.it/0f2ibeij0lbf1.png?width=3368&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d79d42a36ec05192e7a9dccdbd89f1f84f84c00

But PHG is the intermediary step toward a far more ambitious goal: the world’s first FDA-approved, automated and autonomous doctor.

Working backwards from our end-goal, you can see why our technical infrastructure layer is a crucial step forward to bringing this vision to life. We need to be able to connect with service providers like a real-world doctor can.

**So with limited spots available for Early Access to our Developer APIs, be sure to register** [**here**](https://developers.thebrightapp.xyz/)**.**

2026 is when we begin distilling our dataset into insights and we want to make sure we can create a full feedback loop with not just our users but healthcare providers.

If that’s you, then let us know.

That’s exactly what one of our users set out to do — and they let **letstravail** handle the entire plan.

# 🚗 Destination: Coorg

📍 Starting Point: Bengaluru  
📅 Duration: 2 nights, 3 days  
🎯 Travel Type: Nature + Relaxation + Food  
🧠 Planned by: letstravail’s AI itinerary builder

# 🛣️ Day 1 — Smooth Start & Scenic Views

They left Bengaluru early Friday morning, following a letstravail-recommended route via Mysuru Road. The plan highlighted **scenic viewpoints, fuel stations, and must-stop cafes** — all timed to match the user’s pace and preferences.

They reached Coorg by noon and checked into a peaceful homestay just outside Madikeri — also recommended in the itinerary.

>

# ☕ Day 2 — Plantations, Waterfalls & Local Finds

The itinerary included:

A visit to **Abbey Falls**  
Coffee tasting at **Mercara Gold Estate**  
A lesser-known viewpoint called **Raja’s Seat** at sunset

Each spot came with tips like:  
✅ Best time to visit  
✅ Travel time from stay  
✅ What to carry (shoes, raincoat, etc.)  
✅ Crowd level indicators

They even found an offbeat Kodava lunch spot that wasn’t in any blog — but showed up under “local food gems” in the letstravail plan.

# 🌳 Day 3 — Light Exploration & Return

The return day was light and intentional:

Early morning visit to a nearby temple  
Breakfast stop en route  
Arrival in Bengaluru by evening, with buffer for traffic

>

# 💬 What Worked Best

✅ Day-by-day structure with clear stop timings  
✅ Smart, real-time optimized routes  
✅ Local insights (not just touristy checklists)  
✅ A digital packing checklist based on the weather

# 📌 What They Suggested for the Future

Add fuel stop alerts for road trips  
Enable reordering of stops mid-trip  
Support for saving alternate options  
(Good news: All of this is already on our roadmap 👀)

# 🧭 Final Thought

Planning a trip doesn’t have to be overwhelming.  
With **letstravail**, even a spontaneous weekend can feel like it’s been carefully crafted by a local expert — without the hours of research.

It waa stupid. I haven't seen them since 2020. Its like people get mad when you aren't like THEM. Its the smallest things that offends people these days. It makes me feel like Im living amongst a bunch of babies. What's going on???

Another time I had this girl in my class who made me a custom coffee mug with my name on it. I told her that she should sell custom mugs because shes very talented and can make alot of money. She snapped at me and said ""Everybody isn't business minded like you!"" She was deeply offended by the fact that I told her that she could sell her mugs. It was so dumb. 

Had a woman once who got mad at me because I told her that I was married. She obviously liked me. But she got mad at me for being married. She was offended.

I have a sister in law who has a thug baby daddy. She told my wife that the guy doesn't like me because I make him look bad. Ive never even spoken to the guy. But apparently he got mad because Im a good father and he isn't. But Ive NEVER spoken to him! So how can he be offended by the fact that Im a good father??? Its just retarded. He doesn't like me for reasons that has nothing to do with me. 

About a year ago I had a job that I rode a scooter to everyday. My coworkers always clowned on my bike. My bike got stolen and they laughed at me. The next day I drove to work in my truck and they all got mad. They didn't know that I had a truck. But it was stupid because it was like I offended them by having it. The vibe was SO BAD after that that I quit the job. Because they were spreading rumors and was trying to get me fired. They treated me like an enemy simply because I had a truck. 

Maybe Im just thick skinned??? I was near a guy last night who screamed the N word at someone. Im Black, but it didn't offend me. I just thought the guy was an idiot. But many people that I know would have beat that guy up. I dont know why Im so different from others. I barely ever get offended by the things that people say or do. What's wrong with people these days? It feels like it doesn't take much to piss people off. All I have to do is be around them and it becomes a problem. Its like I cant connect with people because so many people are always pissed off.

It consumes a lot of my thoughts. I still follow him on IG and I look at his wife's IG to get a glimpse of him. 

I'm worried that I won't be able to move on from him. I have tried to block his IG and her IG. But I relapse. There is a part of me who knows we wouldn't have been compatible.

Coffee brewing is such a personal and often meditative ritual for many of us here. But as someone who’s into both coffee and tech, I can’t help but wonder—can tech actually enhance the experience instead of getting in the way?

Not talking about super expensive espresso machines or robotic arms pouring v60s 😅 — but smaller, more practical stuff. Like:
	•	Apps that help dial in brews (tracking ratios, timing, notes, smart timers)
	•	Maybe even a way to automate parts of the process on groggy mornings? (IOT devices)

Or do you feel that too much tech kills the soul of the brew?

1lufmfq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Deliverance/comments/1lufmfq/discernment/,Discernment,"Hi everyone! I’ve posted here several times over the past few months. I’ve been working with a deliverance minister for about 5 months now. The Holy Spirit revealed to her about 1.5 months ago that we’ve been going back and forth with wounded soul parts rather than demons this entire time. These soul parts were pretending to be demons. But when asked if Jesus is the Son of God in the flesh, they’ll confirm as truth. Several of these soul parts almost seem to be working in tandem with the demons (Leviathan, Jezebel, and Beelzebub were shown to me in dreams several months ago) in order to control me and throw me into as much confusion as possible. These protector parts seem to want to basically dictate my every move in life down to details (like cutting out coffee and exercise). They do this by pretending to be angels or the Holy Spirit. Even as I am reading Scripture at times, they will pretend to be the Holy Spirit making something apply to my life. I also feel that the demons are involved because things will happen in my external environment after I’ve asked for confirmation. I believe these protector parts want me to move back to my hometown all the way across the country. This was revealed to me via a pendulum (back when I was involved with divination before I got saved in November - everything is gone now and renounced) almost a year ago now. But also around this time, something clearly spoke through the pendulum telling me that demons were sexually assaulting me (this is something I was dealing with but didn’t know it was demons at the time). Since then, over and over, I’ve been shown visions of moving back to my hometown and given dreams about it. However, I’m never given any life-changing miraculous revelation and confirmation although I continue to pray about it over and over. My childhood is filled with trauma and abuse (apparently a lot of which I don’t even remember hence the soul parts). I will randomly hear worship songs in my mind or Scripture will be brought up; however, it’s always Scripture that I’ve already read and never any specific verses like saying “John 20:1” if that makes sense. It’s just the gist of what the Scripture said. In addition to all of this, my daughter has experienced a couple demonic dreams involving Jezebel over the past month, but she’s also had two dreams specifically showing her being surrounded by friends (her biggest fear was not making friends) in the hometown once we move back AND pulling into our new apartment feeling overjoyed and excited. I am having an incredibly difficult time discerning whether it is God, soul parts, or demons telling me to move. This move is supposed to happen in less than a month. But it is a radical decision that I don’t want to make on a whim. PLEASE share your thoughts as even my closest friends who are mature in their faith, the prayer team at church, and the pastor are all split on whether or not this sounds like something that is God’s will.

1lufkx2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Libyan_Expats/comments/1lufkx2/the_process_server/,The Process Server ◇,"The term might sound confusing to those unfamiliar with the judicial system; and trust me, you don't wanna see these guys. 

That's right, a process server is a physical entity - in flesh and bones.  

Technically, they're sworn  officials tasked with delivering divorce papers, rulings, eviction notice, foreclosure, class action suits, summons, child custody papers, subpoenas etc etc.

( Sworn = they swear to say the truth and nothing but the truth ).

You get the idea; in other words they deliver ""very bad"" news - and you can't run away from them - technically you could run away  and it has been done before but that'll just put you in a very bad position in front of a judge; even if you decide to not show up, you'll be sentenced in absentia.

The minute you make eye contact with the process server; the whole interaction will be recorded and handed to the judge - including insults and threats.

Some process servers have been physically assaulted and even fired at during their attempt at delivering said papers.

It's a shitty job but someone has to do it.

I do suspect that deep inside they actually enjoy delivering ""disasters"" at people's door step.

A process server can hunt you down and stalk you for days; even wait outside a toilet stall or hand you the papers from beneath the door.

That's where the term ""you've been served"" comes from; but in reality its more like ""you've been notified"" first and then served the papers.

Whether you accept the papers or refuse them; it makes no difference - the point is that you've been notified and from this minute onwards acknowledge your legal obligations / standing. 

Think of the process server as the courts fingertip.  

From my experience; these guys are cunning and will use every trick up their sleeve to deliver those papers.  For instance they can stalk you at your favorite coffee shop or linger next to your car for hours.  

My advice is to resist the urge to insult or even hit a process server; he writes everything that happens and reports to your judge.  Act in a civilised manner and if you don't understand what's being said; the process server will calmly explain what's going on.

Just talking to a process server from behind a wall, door or intercom means ""mission accomplished"" for the case to start. 

The process server is not asking you if you want the papers or not; and refusing to accept said papers will work against you.  

How ? Refusing to accept whatever the server is handing you; will substantiate the claims made against you in a class action suit - that's how a judge will interpret it.  

In other words; if you have nothing to fear and want to defend yourself, then you'll show up at court.

Failing to show up is basically disrespecting the judge and he'll rule against you to the full extent of the law.

In the next few days, I'm sending a process server for a class action suit 😄 and the defendant is bound to be struck by a heart attack.  

First off, they gotta scramble for a lawyer and need to have plenty of cash at hand - a class action suit delivered at your doorstep is not gonna solve itself nor is it gonna be cheap.

Personally, I've had my fair share of legal disputes in Libya - at times I was the defendant and at times I was the plaintiff.

When I recieve a text message from the process server saying: ""they've been notified"" - in the back of my mind I start hearing a soft aria by Stradivari or Beethoven that slowly builds up until it explodes in a tempest of joy and gore ( mixed together ).

At anyrate, I shall document the details of my next class action suit as it unfolds.

Well folks, today's lesson was on how ""not to run away from a process server"" and if you see one, you can bet your bottom dollar that its gonna be bad news and a very shitty next few months.

By the way; those process servers got some funny stories if you get to know them on a personal level 😄.

1lufiiv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/1lufiiv/rant_my_life_in_the_past_2_years/,Rant (my life in the past 2 years),"I grew up in a house where you never hear the worlds ""n7ebek"" and never getting a hug from either ur parents, the only time i hear ""n7enek"" is when i get beaten up badly by my parents and then they hit me with the ""nodherbek 5ater n7ebek"", so i grew up to be the types that doesn’t belive in love and all of that bullshit, i always keeps my emotions to myself, never have i ever told someone how i feel even my exes.

I was like that for 20years, then after being away at uni for 2 years, i wanted to change some things about myself...

I started learning about psychology and how to read ppl and i got deep into the psychology hoping to use it on myself and try to change, it worked for a while until it didn’t anymore. 

Now i'm 24yo and sometimes i wish i didn’t try to change myself to believe in all that bs (love), so here is the story

I was living my life normally without feeling anything toward anyone, i'd have a girlfriend but i'll act with her gentlemanly and based on some stuff i saw other ppl do (i'd write letters, buy chocolates, takes them on dates, etc... but all of that came from my brain not my heart, coz i'd say to myself that's what someone who love might do), i had too many girlfriends in my first 3 uni years (till graduation).

Btw, i was active a lot in the clubs and stuff like that.

Then i decided to do a masters degree, in the same uni, and in the first month a club organised a ""5arja"", so i went with them, and in one of the activities i got paired with a girl and another boy, they both were in their first year in uni, usually i don’t go for girls with more than 1year difference between us, but idk how or why me and that girl clicked. We talked a lot on that ""5arja"" and we had fun, then when time for going back came (around 8pm) me and her left the other and went alone to buy dinner, then in the way back to her ""foyer"" she asked for my fb and insta, and we started talking, day and night, then probably after 4~5weeks of talking i told her i wanna be exclusive, we kinda fought in the chat and she said she don’t know what to do now and it's better if we don't keep talking and all of that, but i already loved her at that time, we argued a lot and it was over and that it...

After like a week of depression, a friend of mine (girl from the same club) was walking with her girl friend, and as soon as i saw that girl i didn’t like her at first, but we talked for a bit all three of us, and something inside me shifted, that girl was the 'too kind' hijabi type of girls, i never liked that type of girls until 2 days after we met and we were talking at night about all we suffered from and how life is hard (i liked her a lot, she still the only kind type girl that i like), we started hanging around everyday with each other, we talk litterally 24/7, we'd stay untill 9pm roaming around the streets holding hands and sometimes hugging (don’t judge), honestly and litterally i found everything i never had in this girl (shés too freaking nice and lovely and caring, etc...) i felt with her everything i never felt with anyone...

However, i wish life was that easy, long story short she was in another relationship (ye, oh my fucking god, i wish i could’ve freaking hated her the moment i heard her saying that, she told me that when we were up late at night holding hands and cuddling, i was like wtf is happening) keep in mind i still haven’t told her i love her... 
That night i told her i was going out with her and doing all of that just coz i liked her and i want to be with her, but we all know what she answered...
Anyway, i felt betrayed from her coz i never really liked cheaters, and i freaking hate them, after that night she kept talking to me and from time to time i'd get mad at her and tell her hatefull things and how she's a cheater and all...

Keep in mind that all of this with the hijabi girl happened in the span of 2 weeks, imagine 2 weeks of being 24/7 talking and being around with the person that was all the things u never had, literally, and i was that to her too, i'm a very kind person (even tho that time i didn’t believe in love), i was and still too kind with any girl, i'm the type that writes love letters and gives them or hides them someplaces she'd find, buy chocolates, flowers, gifts... i'm so gentle with everygirl. She found comfort with me as a did with her.
Keep in mind that her boyfriend at the time was her neighbor, and they was in a relationship foe 2 years at that time. however, he's a very conservative person, they never even touched hands in those 2 years, 
Later on they broke up for other reasons

And after days of depression, i got a message from the first girl, at first i didn’t want to answer... and eventually i did answer and we started talking back and we talked and fixed a lot. And eventually we went back to going on dates and all.
Keep in mind that the hijabi girl still reach out to me and we talk sometimes, even tho i told her not to talk to me again.
Anyway, me and that girl kept going on dates every saturday and sunday... beach, coffee, mall, videochat, arcade(in the mall), all kind of dates, and i'd spend like 50-80dt every date, i was working some freelance back then and honestly i loved her that much...
She had a hugeeeeeeee red flag that i chose ignored, which later came to bite me.
She had a lot of male friends, not talking like 3~5, but like 15~20 and she's always talk to them and send them videos of her in snapchat...
We talked about that matter and agreed on only keeping the closest (3 of them, her childhood friends)

And everything was going great, until after 2~3 months of being toghether i dropped out of uni and went back to my hometown, wekept vide chatting every day, sometimes she'd ssleep while on them, and some weeks i'd spend more than 200dt to go meet her at that city and stay for 3 days then get back to home, it was all going great with some fights sometimes like all couples, we stayed like that for 3 months...

Anyway, before valentine day i went there, and in that trip i stayed in a house of friend of a friend, so it wasn’t easy, and i spent 3 days there and those 3 days were literally the best 3 days of all of our relationship, i got her a promise ring and some flowers and everything (i didn’t do it the propose type).

Before we go to the next part, keep in mind that i rlly thought this is gonna be the girl, everything about her i loved, she was even big part of the decision to drop out. Coz i wanted to start working early to give her everything she wanted... and yes i loved her that much...

The day i was leaving, i wanted to meet her in uni, we met and with some joking i took her phone (keep in mind we always keeps our phones with eachother but we never go though them without permission), that day after i took her phone, she kinda flipped, idk why but she had her password changed, but i kept joking with her and closing and opening the phone to her face for it to unlock, but she kept acting weird, and boom the phone opens...

Idk why but i felt every single atom in my body telling me to go though with it, so i opened her insta and facebook and whatsapp in a jocking way so she won’t get mad, but the instant i said snapchat, oh man, she tried to take the phone but i resisted and opened it, and man oh mani found her snapchatting with more than 20 male friend including someone i told her not to talk to ever again(he's not a childhood friend of her), now tbh i don’t know if she talks to them or just keeps sending snapchats to get her score up, but nope...
We both got mad, she's mad coz i went through her pgone and i got mad coz i felt betrayed.

Even after all of that i wasn’t seeing things clearly, and followed her and tried to talk about what just happened, she didn’t want to, so i got out àd went to another city... 
One thing about me is that i write too much when i'm hurting so isent her a lot of messages explaining what she did and how she hurt me and i'm disppointed and all that shit, she never replied..
However, she kept sending me snaps of her going out with her friends and all, like nothing mattered to her, so i did something i still regret, i told her some pretty hatefull words and how she's for the street and all...

After 2 hours she saw them and blocked me everywhere, then something i like to call the ""love instinct"" hits me hard and somehow i didn’t want to lose her, even tho ik that everything already ended, so i kept trying with her, i even begged her for more than a month...
And after 3 months i tried again and gave her roses and a letter including an apology and some hatefull words (i never learn haha)

Ps: i got so fucking depressed in that time coz i got betrayed twice in a very short period and i was already in a dark place of my life coz i wasted my studies and i never found a job
Pss: after rereading this i noticed that the way i worded this thing made her looks like a shitty girl, but in reality she's a very good girl, maybe life hit her hard and all but she was very good with me
Psss: also the very first relationship i got into, ended up by being cheated on, and she know that...

Pssss: This is link with details about the breakup
https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/s/KWpgUvDy5z

Now it's been like a year and a half since the very last time we talked, and i still don't trust girl, i tried to talk to some girls and all but there is something deep inside me that always fucks everything up again (probably a defense mechanism), 

Anyway, last year i re-enrolled in another uni in another city, and remember when i said i kept in touch with the hijabi girl !, we met like 3 times in some events, and she hasn't gotten into any relationship after me, we met in various competitions, and every single fucking time i see her, i still fking love her so much, and try to spend as much as i can with her...

And the first girl never left my mind, she's always back there and i'm always thing of her even after all that happened, as for the hijabi girl it was everything i wanted and also she still in my mind..

There a saying that goes something like ""You’ll love two people in your life, one with your heart and one with your mind."", and unfortunately i found them both in the same time and couldnt be with either of them

I still talk with the hijabi girl and we call sometimes, and the amount of love that i feel for her isn't normal, she became conservative after the night i told her i loved her, and didnt meet anyone else, sometimes she'd even ask me if i'm in a relationship, now idk why girls ask that question, but i do feel like i might actually go ahead and ask for her hand, but the thing is i feel like i love her with my brain and mind, not my heart, but it still an enormous amount of love, i rlly dont know what to do.

Anyway, now it's been more than 1,5years and i'm still single as fuck, depressed as fuck, lonelyyy as fuck, i'm 24yo with no job and no income and nothing to my name, living in my parents house which makes me even more depressed..

I AM FREAKING DEPRESSED AS FUCKK, i don't know what to do with my life.

I'm writing this coz this is the first time seeing the images of us, hearing our songs, and reading our chat after in a year and half of forcing myself to ignore everything...

Anyway, the thing i regret the most even tho it's too late, is changing my emotionless self to this shitty version of me, not really.

Anyway, i know it's too long and probably no one's gonna read it all, but ye, just wanted to rant this out of my head... thanks

Perioral dermatitis isn’t one-size-fits-all. To heal it, you have to understand what type you’re dealing with—whether it's inflammatory, bacterial, fungal, or steroid-induced—and what’s triggering it.

Here’s a breakdown that might help you narrow it down so you can follow the right treatment path:

# 🔥 Inflammatory POD

**Cause:** Often linked to irritants, overuse of facial actives, or skin barrier damage.

**Looks like:** Redness, tiny bumps or papules, often with dry, flaky skin—no obvious pus.

**Feels like:** Sensitive, tight, stinging, or burning—especially after applying skincare products.

**Best approach:**

* Identify your trigger:
   * *Irritant-Triggered:* Too many facial acids, retinoids, or scrubs.
   * *Hormonal:* Flares around your cycle, especially on the chin/mouth. Common with birth control shifts.
   * *Fluoride/SLS:* Worsens after brushing or using foaming cleansers—switch to SLS- and fluoride-free products.
* Strip back your routine. I personally use:
   * [**La Roche-Posay Toleriane Hydrating Gentle Face Cleanser**](https://amzn.to/4lzyBCj)
   * [**La Roche-Posay Toleriane Double Repair Face Moisturizer**](https://amzn.to/3TftyuG)
* For inflammation treatment see a Derm for:
   * *Tacrolimus* is stronger and helpful for stubborn flare-ups. (Derm Prescribed)
   * *Pimecrolimus* works more gently for milder cases. (Derm Prescribed)

# 🦠 Bacterial POD

**Cause:** Imbalance in the skin microbiome—often from occlusion, over-moisturizing, or hormonal shifts.

**Looks like:** Red, inflamed clusters with whiteheads or pustules. Might ooze, crust, or spread.

**Feels like:** Irritated, tender, sometimes itchy—especially after sweating or in humid conditions.

**Best approach:**

* See a derm for topical or oral antibiotics like *metronidazole*, *clindamycin*, or *doxycycline*.
* Support your gut during and after antibiotic use:
   * I take [**Seed Daily Synbiotic**](https://refer.seed.com/by/tarahtarah55@gmail.com)—a pre+probiotic in one. It’s been key to keeping my gut balanced, especially while on antibiotics when your microbiome is most vulnerable. 

# 🍄 Fungal POD (Malassezia-related)

**Cause:** Yeast overgrowth, often triggered by heavy oils, humid environments, or a disrupted skin barrier.

**Looks like:** Red or bumpy rash, often itchy or scaly. Usually doesn’t improve with antibiotics—and sometimes worsens with them.

**Feels like:** Itchy, especially at night or after sweating. May feel prickly or tingly, but not usually painful or burning.

**Best approach:**

* Use antifungal treatments like *ketoconazole*, *fluconazole (derm prescribed)or* *sulfur masks*.
* Avoid applying any oils that feed yeast topically (like esters, shea butter, or olive oil).
* You may also benefit from reducing mold-prone foods in your diet, such as:
   * **Coffee, aged cheeses, nuts, wine/beer, and fermented products**

# ⚠️ Steroid-Induced POD

**Cause:** Use of topical steroids (like hydrocortisone) or steroid sprays (nasal/inhaled)—especially near the mouth or eyes.

**Looks like:** Red, inflamed rash with papules or pustules—can mimic other types but flares quickly after stopping steroid use.

**Feels like:** Burning, tightness, or sensitivity during withdrawal. May temporarily improve with steroid use, then rebound worse.

**Best approach:**

* Slowly taper off steroids under medical guidance. Expect some withdrawal flare-ups—it’s part of the process.
* *Tacrolimus* and *pimecrolimus* can help as non-steroidal alternatives during recovery.

# 🧠 Don’t Skip the Gut

Many people (myself included) notice major improvement when gut health is addressed—especially if POD flares seem linked to digestion, sugar, or stress.

What’s helped me:

* [**Seed Daily Synbiotic**](https://refer.seed.com/by/tarahtarah55@gmail.com) — a pre+probiotic in one. I started seeing benefits within weeks.
   * Especially helpful if you're currently on or recently finished antibiotics, since they can disrupt the gut-skin connection.
* Eating more prebiotic-rich foods like bananas, oats, garlic, and asparagus
* Reducing or eliminating common triggers like coffee, sugar, gluten, or dairy

# 🧼 Extra Swaps That Helped Me

Personal care and household products can also be major flare triggers they were 100% for me—especially those with fragrance, SLS, or residue-forming ingredients.

Two easy swaps that made a huge difference for me:

* **Toothpaste:** [**HUPPY Toothpaste Tablets**](https://amzn.to/3I21mcr) — fluoride-free, SLS-free, and travel-friendly
* **Laundry Detergent:** [**Charlie’s Soap Laundry Powder (Fragrance-Free)**](https://amzn.to/3Tk9SFV) — no fragrance, no harsh surfactants, and gentle on skin and fabrics

**Pro Tip:** Keep a symptom journal. Track your skincare, diet, stress levels, and product changes. POD often needs a multi-angle approach—and sometimes it’s a mix of types.

I have just finished the first two seasons of Scandal. It’s so good; it’s crazy good and addictive! I stayed up all night last night watching it—oops! I had to meet my personal trainer at 9 AM, and let’s just say it was a rough session. Lol

I’m 33 years old and split my time between two locations in the United States, working across both Eastern Daylight Time and Pacific Time Zones. My work life is quite hectic and intense, leaving little room for frivolous distractions, but I pride myself on being fair and kind.

I strive to find the good in people and trust my intuition. While I have a close-knit group of friends, many of them are married with children, which makes it challenging for us to spend time together. I completely respect their priorities, but I sense that our paths are starting to diverge. At this point, I'm not looking to connect with my married friends; instead, I'm open to forging new friendships with those who are divorced, as long as we can avoid any drama related to ex-partners—life is simply too short for that.

I recently ended a serious engagement and came to the difficult realization that I didn’t love him enough to move forward with marriage. Making that decision was one of the hardest things I've ever done. Now, I’m taking some time for myself and focusing on building friends  only.


I'm passionate about music! I have a 24-hour playlist that features a variety of genres, including artists like Lizzo, Ella Fitzgerald, and Kacey Musgraves. I'm on Apple Music, so feel free to ask if you'd like to check out some of my playlists! I recently attended a Beyoncé concert, and she was absolutely phenomenal. I've also seen amazing performances by Taylor Swift, Adele, Kacey Musgraves, Lady Gaga, Pink, and many other fantastic artists. Music truly brings me joy!

I’m  a passionate reader and enthusiastic audiobooks fan, I truly cherish immersing myself in stories, especially while I'm on the move. Tuesdays hold a special place in my heart as it's the day new books are released. Listening to audiobooks allows me to savor literature in a convenient way, and there's something truly magical about the experience of being read to! I often bump up the playback speed to double-time. If you're interested in discussing books, I would be absolutely delighted! Recently, I was deeply moved by ""The River is Waiting"" by Wally Lamb; although it was an emotional read, it left a profound impact on my heart and shifted my perspective on various important issues. That's the beauty of books for me! Purchasing audiobooks and physical books is a huge passion of mine—it's an addiction, but what a wonderful thing to be addicted to!


I’m passionate about dining out and exploring new restaurants. Although I do enjoy cooking at home, I’ve found myself in a phase where going out for brunch and dinner with friends is my primary focus. I’m a big fan of iced coffee and love sharing plenty of champagne with great company! Food in general—especially brunch and lunch—is one of my favorite passions!

I've had the pleasure of traveling quite extensively, from the beautiful beaches of Bali to the romantic streets of Paris and the stunning landscapes of Kenya, even covering all 50 states in the process. At this point, it feels like I've crossed off most of the destinations from my travel wishlist. However, I'm always ready to recommend some great restaurants no matter which city you mention!

I'm on the lookout for someone between the ages of 26 and 50 who lives in the United States and shares my preference for voting blue. Sports and video games aren't really my thing, so if those are your main interests, we might not be a great match. Also, I'm not into hiking or camping, just to keep that in mind!",2,1751948499.0,MakeFriendsOver30,1,1.0,False
