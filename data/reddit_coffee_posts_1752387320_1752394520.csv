Life gets busy, and it's easy for me lose touch or fall into routine — so I’m putting myself out there to meet some new people and hopefully make a few genuine connections. I use to have a social circle many years ago where we would play games after work at each others houses and that was great.

If you know of any social groups, hobby meetup. I’d love to hear about it! I'm open to just about anything — coffee chats, game nights, hiking, or trying something new. 😊.. I have a discord that I use, so if people have any group links please send them over. I am based in Cheltenham but I work in Cirencester.

I used to live at point-pleasant, west Virginia. But, After high school, I moved out for collage, And never really came back. Sure, a few visits to my dad here and there, but, nothing longer than a few days. Until one day, I got a letter, it was from my old high-school.  
It read something along the lines of ""Hey! We're holding a reunion party for the old students of point-pleasant high school! Hope you can come join us for the party!"" The letter was, unexpected. But, it was nothing out of the ordinary. Every class had one of these.  
I remember when I was still in high school, me and 2 of my friends would sneak in one of these reunions, we got so drunk that one of my friends couldn't stop puking for the entire night. We were having a sleep over at one of their houses, and their parents weren't home for a few days, so we didn't get in any trouble, that night at least. The next day, me and the other friend that was staying over at, lets call him ""David"" went home. My dad wasn't that mad about it, somehow. He was pretty loose with rules. Just no drugs, no hurting other people, and Always tell him where I'm at every few hours until midnight if I'm at someone else's place. I miss him.  
Sorry, I'm rambling. After I got the letter, I packed my bags and flew back to the place that I once called ""home""  
As soon as I arrived at the airport, I rented a car, and started driving. It was 1 am on the highway. Luckily I was high on caffeine and wasn't falling asleep on the wheel. thanks to the coffee I packed along the way. But something bothered me, it was like this gut wrenching feeling of dread. Maybe, it was just all in my head, I Did down the equivalent of 3 cups of coffee in an hour or two, that wasn't such a good idea after all. That feeling of fear and dread kept going for at least an hour more.

then, it suddenly got halted by the sound of my phone ringing. I went and took a quick glance at my phone, it was a random unknown number. ""probably a scam"" I said dismissingly.

I quickly took my vision back on the road, that's when I see it, a shadowy figure appeared in front of my car. my body instantly jolted and turned my steering wheel. And before I knew it, I was going to hit a tree. I blacked out for only what I could assume to be 30 or so minutes before waking up. My eyes were heavy, but I had to get out of my car. I opened the drivers seat door and fell onto the dirt.

Suddenly, I felt this jolt of pain on my left leg, I didn't dare to look at it. Because, I could feel that my femur has popped out of my leg. I crawled on the ground getting away from my now burning car. I tried to scream, but nothing came out. My arms and right leg grew tired, the pain would intensify every time I even slightly moved. I gave up, at that moment, I truly gave up. Then it all stopped. The pain and anguish. It got cut out by that gut wrenching feeling again. And then, I saw it. Illuminated by the fire coming from my car, covering the surrounding darkness with a blanket of orange, I saw it.

A man, covered in white glistering fur, it had wings as big as tree branches, it was around 6 to 7 feet tall. I looked at its glowing red eyes, its shine beating the orange tint of the fire. But, I wasn't, scared? Well, I was, but I wasn't scared for my safety, no. Looking at it gave me a sense of comfort I've never felt before. The fear came from what it said to me. I still remember it to this day. The creature spoke, in a high pitched, raspy, and almost animal like voice ""Don't go"".

What was it trying to tell me? Why was its message so short? And matter of fact, what even was ""it""? Before I could even process what it just said, it jumped up, and flew away into the night sky. its fur, mixed with the shine of the moon light and the blazing fire behind me. Made it look, beautiful.

My head fell onto the grass. The next thing I know, I was being treated by paramedics, I could hear people talking, I could see the light of the ambulance and fire trucks, I was saved. The next few weeks I had to spend my time at the hospital. My friends and my family visited, and my girlfriend stayed with me at the hospital.

A few days later, the night of the reunion, I was on a hospital bed. having nothing else to do, I turned on the tv, and what I heard, made my stomach turn. ""Yearly high school reunion tradition at pleasant point ended in tragedy after a gas leak caused a fire to break out"".

I am now living happily with my former girlfriend, now wife, far away from point pleasant. So if you ever plan to go there, just beware of The Night butterfly.",1,1752394240.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,0.99,False

For both of the locations it would be great if they are centrally located and less than 5 minute walk from a metro stop.  Serving coffee, small bites of food, and - ideal but not necessary - wine or beer would be great.  I'm thinking a cafe that's closer to a coffee shop than a restaurant.

For the drawing meetup - I've been hosting it at Cafedu is a great spot that allows you to book reservations.  However their biggest table is 8 people and we need more space so I can increase the number of people who can attend.  Basically we need a spot where we can get 12 people feeling like they are together so we can socialize while we draw.  It isn't key that everyone is at the same table but if we have multiple tables we need our own ""space"".

For the Russian literature meetup. We need a place that allows for deep conversation to happen so a much less lively environment than cafedu.

Hey, just wanted to drop a quick update and say thank you.

I honestly didn’t see that post blowing up like it did. I was just letting off steam, pouring out stuff that’s been weighing on me. Figured maybe a handful of people would see it, nod, and keep scrolling. But then my inbox started lighting up, and I was floored.

People from all over; UPSC grinders, JEE and NEET warriors, even folks who’ve already crossed the finish line, reached out. Some are deep in mains, others have been at this for years, and they all said the same thing: “I get it. I’ve been there too.” That hit me right in the gut. For the first time in ages, I didn’t feel like I was carrying this alone.

Not a single message was negative. Nobody judged or preached. Just pure support, real stories, and so much kindness. A few people even asked if I’d be down to grab coffee sometime, just to chill and connect. That kind of warmth from total strangers? It’s hard to put into words what that means.

Some of you shared what’s helped you,stuff like blasting music, scribbling in a journal, or diving into the Bhagavad Gita. One of the fraternity members suggested  a Marathi movie, “Ata Thambaycha Naay!” (No Stopping Now). Watched it, and damn, it hit home. Thanks for that gem.

The thing that’s stuck with me most, though, was a song sent by one of our fraternity members - [An Epilogue of Hope ](https://youtu.be/6yzZqPo2qxg) by Shlokha. I’ve had it on repeat nonstop. It’s raw, intense, and just… speaks to you, you know? Exactly what I needed to hear.

So yeah, I don’t have some grand wrap-up here. Just a big thank you. Thanks for the love, for getting it, for taking the time to reach out to some random person online. Wherever you are, whatever you’re fighting through, I’m rooting for you to come out on top.

I return after a long hiatus.  This Likely won't be regular as I am not collecting samples very often.  However, I am saving my samples for large reviews as it is an enjoyable experience.  Plus, I find among a large collection of samples I might only like a few out of many.
Because it has been a while with holding onto these samples, I'll be skipping the portion related to unpacking unless I remember it.

Half star symbols still seem out of my grasp.  And thus, halves will be numerically types out in the x.5/5 format.

* ☆☆☆☆☆ Disgusting. Never wearing it after that. Will definitely destach later unless the product is genuinely rancid.
* ★☆☆☆☆ Bad but not intolerable. Unfortunately my skin chemistry disagrees with it. Expect a destach of it later.
* ★★☆☆☆ It is not great but not bad. Unlikely to wear it. Expect a destach of it later.
* ★★★☆☆ Average. I might destach it later or I might keep it to further try out.
* ★★★★☆ This is a good perfume! I am likely impressed by what I smell! I'm more than likely keeping this and may even seek it out again later. Likely will buy a bigger bottle.
* ★★★★★ Amazing! This perfume is perfect for me. I will definitely be wearing it later and will buy a bigger bottle of it.

# Wild Veil

This is a brand I am somewhat a fan of.  Granted, I haven't tried enough perfumes to understand whether or not this house is for me.  I remember it was interesting to review nonetheless.
I had recently recieved a few smaples from Wild Veil.  I remember recieving a very minimalistic packaging with a pressed viola inside a tiny box that contained the perfumes and something to cushion them.  I was informed ahead of time there would be a shipping delay and thus I will not hold that against the maker.

**Gardenia, Saffron, Hunza Raisin Enfleurage**: I had gotten this one because I am still on the lookout for a dainty, floral perfume.  I want a perfume that isn't too sweet (not rose levels of sweet) but still smells like a fragrant flower. I'm excited to try it as it is my very first Enfleurage.

>My hunza raisin extract is soft and fruity, like muscatel, honey, and Madeira. Balanced by the piquant, heady bitters of saffron, the base is aromatic and voluptuous.

I don't get very much at a glancing whiff which would make sense given that it is solid.  On my skin, it is very sweet at first but mellows out somewhat moments later.  I smell sweet, earthy, some saffron, and tiny bit of florals.  It is light.  I can really smell the deep, fruity notes of raisins.  The honey is accurate as is the saffron.  I'm rather unsure as it isn't what I was expecting.  I'll grant it a 2.5/5.  This is an interesting one.  Unfortunately, I had to remove half a star because the scent disappears very quickly.  It was gone in 30 minutes.

**Amethyst**: I had chosen this sample because I am on the lookout for lavender scented perfumes.  I do enjoy a good lavender scent so I look forward to what this has to offer.

>lavender, lilac and violet synaesthesia

In the bottle, it smells herbal and strongly of sweet lavender.  It isn't like the acrid lavendine, it is soft, and nice.  On my skin, the lavender gets stronger.  It is clean with undertones of sweet florals, likely the lilac coming theough. It is very nice, though I'd have to try it further before coming to a conclusion on whether or not I want to get a full size.  Wild veil is rather expensive so I'll have to wait for a sale if I want one. Though, does lose strength quickly and mellows out.  Despite that, the scent remains. 3.5/5

**Aries**: I had been looking for a good green scent as I lack a good full sized green scent.  This perfume sounded good and so I got a sample of it.

>spring canoe ride among twilight cypresses, fireflies, and weeping willows

In the bottle is rather earthy with hints of herbal.  I can smell something akin to bugs.  Ladybugs are definitely there.  There are green elements that are subtly sweet.  On my skin it evolves.  It is muck more green and less earthy.  The earthiness comes back but sweeter.  It gets mellower and sweeter as if something is in bloom.  I really like this one and will have to try it more.  3.5/5

I was very excited to try these perfumes.  Wild Veil tends to offer good scents that can be rather unique and memorable.  I might not like every perfume the house has to offer but the ones I like are ones I like keeping around.

# Lucky #9

I had this sample from a while ago.  I am unsure if I'll buy from them again as when I last looked at the shop a year ago I noticed some perfume had AI art.  However, looking now, I don't see any which tells me the covers may have been changed.  I won't say much more on this subject matter as it isn't my intention to tarnish the reputations of any brands but simply review what I have and say if I'd like a full size or not.  I only have 1 sample and so this sections will be short.

**Paw Prints in the Snow**: I remember having gotten this sample at random when I got a full sized perfume a while ago.  Judging by the label's scent notes, it'll be something fresh and fruity.  It might be pretty good.

>Ozone, Icy Fir, Mistletoe, Cranberries, Blackberries

I small the fir and berries right away when I open the bottle.  The mistletone barely just a suggestion but that makes sense as I have read it doesn't really have a scent.  It is giving me candle vibes.  The berry-ness is didtinct smelling.  Perhaps it is akin to bayberries?
On my skin, the perfume is about the same.  There is some freshness.  However, overall, it is a very warm and fruity perfume. I'll give it ★★★☆☆ for being rather decently smelling.

Given that it was only 1 sample and the above text I do not have very much to say.  For those that enjoy this house, I'm happy you get to experience it.

# Solstice Scents

This is a brand I really like.  Not only is the presentation of the perfumes good but the scents are good quality.  I will be trying more solstice scent perfumes in the future and likely slowly build my selection with more.  However, in the mean time, I only have 1 sample and thus this section will also be short.

**Blackburn's Parlor**: I had gotten this sample when I got curious about banana scented perfumes.  This perfume had come up when people were talking about it.  Though, I am aware the banana scent note will be fleeting so I'll be judging in on multiple fronts per usual.

>Vanilla Waffle Bowl, Vanilla & Chocolate Ice Creams, Sliced Bananas Smothered In Caramel Sauce & Topped With Whipped Cream

The scent of budge and banana is present in the bottle.  It smells absolutely delicious already.  The banana is rather strong on my skin.  The chocolate is really nice as well.  It smells like I had just eaten a yummy, large sundae in the shade during a hot day.  The banana is quick to go away, leaving the vanilla ice cream, chocolate (very fudge-like), and caramel.  It is really good.  I'm a sucker for sweet gourmands, I'll admit. ★★★★☆

Even with just 1 sample, solstic scents knocked it out of the park.  I'm a big fan and will buy another sample set again eventually.  Perhaps I'll get a full size of this one as well, which would make it the very first chocolate full size in my collection.

# BPAL

I haven't tried many perfumes from BPAL yet.  However, I do have a few now to try.  I am excited as even if this house can be hit or miss, the ones I enjoy work very well.  The samples are notably generous so I'll be getting a lot out of the ones I like.

**Zombi**: I forgot how I obtained this perfume.  I wasn't sure what to think of it based on the name.  However, its description makes me think it'll smell pretty good.

>Dried roses, rose leaf, Spanish moss, oakmoss and deep brown earth

The oakmoss and earth comes through with its earthy, herbal notes when sniffing the bottle.  The dried roses and rose leaves comes through on my skin.  There are hints of freshness, almost like mint.  It is herbal, earth, and a bit floral.  It has hints of sweetness.  I like this more than some other green smelling perfumes I've liked.  As it sits on my skin, the sweetness and herbal notes develop together and remind me a bit of hay.  I give it a ★★★☆☆ for being pleasantly surprising.

**Vicomte de Valmont**: I forgot how I had obtained this one.  I did not know what it could smell like until I glanced at the scent list.  It sounds green, minty, and a bit sweet!  This will certainly be a curious one.

>ambergris, white musk, white sandalwood, Spanish Moss, orange blossom, three mints, jasmine, rose geranium and a spike of rosemary.

In the bottle moss and mint are very apparent as is the rosemary.  It's resinous, green, fresh, and herbal.  It is very similar on my skin.  It reminds me of a pine tree. It is clean and interestingly enough, not very soapy at all.  The mintiness is also present and cools down my lungs a little.  This is a kind of perfume I can imagine myself wearing when in a boring environment or out in the summer heat to counter-balance the oven-like temperatures.  The greens overwhelm the florals.  I feel uncertain and thus it gets the average ★★★☆☆ rating.

**Lurid**: I had recieved this perfume at random.  I believe it came in with the packaging of the full sized An Autumn Wandering I got over reddit after finding out it had been retired.  As a basic principle if mine, I try to stay away from limited perfumes because I do not enjoy enxperiencing FOMO.

>Shocking, horrific, fierce, savage, sensationalized, luminous and hazy: black currant, Bulgarian lavender and white musk with a dollop of thick resin and a voltaic charge of ozone notes.

When I get a good gentle whiff from the bottle, I smell scented soap.  It is like a high quality soap and not like the harsher kind.  It could be akin to gentle smelling lavender shampoo in a shower.  At first, when applied, the currant notes are very subtle.  Then the soapinesss grows to be more tangible like I have just washed my hands.  What I am likely smelling is the ozone, resin, and lavender interracting and the currant not coming through very well on my skin. Though, I am noticing how the currant comes out more from a distance and slowly over time getting fruitier which is interesting to say the least.  This isn't a bad scent, but it isn't particularly my thing either. 2.5/5

**Envy**: I had written a review for this perfume but accidently reloaded and erased my progress.  I had forgotten how I obtained this sample.  The description is rather apt as it is ""green with envy""

>Green herbs slithering through mint, lime and lavender

In the bottle it smelled pleasantly citrussy, a bit green, a little bit minty, and floral with its lavender.  One my skin, the citrus notes lasted a couple of minutes as the top note before fading for the herbs, mint, and lavender to take over.  The mint appears to be lower as it comes out stronger over time.  I like it and will have to stuff it into the ""try more"" pouch that is now looking rather full.  I've been writing these reviews out of order.  This is the second to last perfume.  3.5/5

I can see why this house is popular.  The quality is pretty good and the scents can be an interesting experience.  BPAL perfumes can be some of my favorites.  It is a good house and I do not have much more to say besides that I'll be trying more again in the future.

# Posy

I have two full sized perfumes from Posy.  I enjoy both, though I did get one by mistake (not so much the scent but more so the form it is in).  I heard at least one person express curiosity about that particular perfume and thus I will include it.  One small gripe I have recently is the website change.  The updated version is unintuitive to navigate and could use another lookat to make it better.  They also appear to have changed their labels, though that part isn't really an issue to me.  It is still readable and simple.

**Twice to Tea (edp)**: I am familiar with this scent.  However, I had selected the edp instead of the oil-based version on accident.  I still use it nonetheless.  The bottle is much bigger and likely will last me longer because I don't use very much perfume at any given time anyways.

>a strongly brewed cup of Earl Grey tea delicately infused with all natural lavender absolute, sweetened with vanilla syrup, and lightened with a splash of milk

The scent is familiar.  It is sweet and mellows out to be milky and warm.  There are floral undertones from the lavender and vanilla.  I do enjoy it, but the alcohol had a subtle sharpness I cannot quite describe.  Perhaps other people might not detect this as much.  It does somewhat hurt my experience with this perfume.  However, it isn't big enough of a difference to deter me.  I'd still rate it 3.5/5.  If it were the oil based I might have bumped it up to ★★★★☆ instead.

**Madar**: I had received this one as a sample when I got my coffee scented perfume a while ago.  It sounded absolutely wonderful.  I am excited to try this one.

>Be transported to your Persian childhood (even if it only existed in your dreams). A comforting, creamy rice note and the happiest orange flower accord combined with exquisite spices. And let us not forget those delectable sugared pistachios. You can almost feel the sun warming your skin as you spin with delight waiting for the warm, fragrant pudding to cool enough to eat.

The open bottle gives off a warm, floral vanilla.  This is very nice already.  The scent remains about the same on my skin initially.  I am getting warm scents.  It has a nice, sweet scent that wafts off.  It a very nice sweet smell.  Though the spicy notes from the spices aren't very easy to detect.  I am unfamiliar with the scent of orange blossoms so I cannot make any comments about that aspect.  I'd give it a nice ★★★☆☆.  I'll have think about if I want a full size of this one of not.

**Velvet Moon**: I had ran into this perfume a while ago.  I curiously looked up perfumes that smelled queer or could fit into some gay aesthetics (I am a gay man) and this perfume had come up.  I hesitated to get a sample for a while because I read up on the history behind what it was referencing and also in part because of the scent notes.  To be fair, there is nothing wrong with the perfume or its themes, I am just not too into dry scents.  To my luck, I got this sample for free with a purchase.  So here I.  Now to review it...

>cardamom, a wood-paneled library filled with old books, black pepper, a velvet dressing gown, paper, ink, and flickering beeswax candles

When I open the bottle I get a whiff of black pepper and dry paper.  The bright scent of cardamom also is present in the bottle.  On my skin, the paper fades for a moment and returns with ink.  I smell something akin to varnish and hints of candle wax.  The description is accurate.  Cannot say I want to smell like this.  However, it is very nice for those that enjoy smelling some spice and plenty of books.  I'll give it a 3.5/5 despite the fact I'm going to destash this.

**Eat Me**: If my memory is correct, I believe I got this sample as a bonus with my purchase.  I did not expect the sample to come in a short, tiny jar that likely hols more perfume than the long style.  When I read the notes list, it sounds likr another sweet gourmand.  I don't mind sweet gourmand perfumes.  Though, I have multiple full sized sweet gourmands as is.  Given that there is a peach note, I don't expect to smell it as I haven't had any good experiences with peach, nectarine, or apricot perfumes yet (no matter the house).

>Peach lavender cake with a marshmallow frosting dotted with currants

The lavender and marshmallow comes through when I open the bottle.  I forgot how nostalgic the scent of marshmallows can make make me.  On my skin, this perfume is rather strong.  It is very sweet, sweeter than any other perfume I've tried for a while (though it will never top Lush perfumes in terms of sheer sweetness).  I am given hints of lavender.  The marshmallow frosting note implies it was topped rather high on the cake.  I am given the hint of peach but only in its form I've smelled on my skin: a weird musk.  The currants are indeed dotted and very few- it didn't even come through.  I'll have to rate this perfume at ★★☆☆☆.  It just wasn't my thing.
As for the nostalgia, I vividly remember having a webkinz white bunny called marshmallow.  As a kid, I had this marshmallow spray and would spray my plushies with it despite being told not to.  This perfume reminds me of that.  Even then, I'm an adult now and my tastes have changed.

Despite the confusing website changes, I'll probably try more samples in the future.  Their sweet gourmands balance sweetness well with the other notes.  I might look to get a full size of one of the samples I've tried in the future.

# Closing Thoughts

Perfumes bring me joy.  They are a way I can enjoy an experience with a sense that is often rather underrated.  I'm rather please with this spread and will need to make an effort to narrow down to only a few full sized perfumes to buy.  The rest I don't want will go into my growing destash pile.

# Next scents & Questions
I have decided I'll be creating a new section dedicated to what scents I'm on the lookout for and questions I may have.  This review is getting rather long so I'll get to the point.

Scents (in no particular order or combo unless specified):
* Fruity: pineapple; kiwi; watermellon; cherimoya; lychee; ripe banana; medlar
* Floral: Frizzle Sizzle (aka Corkscrew Albuca) blooms; lilic; sweet pea; gardinia; freesia; peony; wisteria; tobacco flower
note: I'd like to find floral perfumes that don't have rose in them.  Vanilla is acceptable but only if it is more to uplift the other notes
* Specific: bitter, dark chocolate (minimum sweetness, only the amount the unsweetened choclate tends to smell like); sweet, hay-like wood; sweet and savory fruity pie (any fruit); sweet, white chocolate
* herbal: chamomile centered

1lyn9e8,https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1C2Cd1E6Qe/,Csehszlovák Kém - Hogy használja fel az orbáni propaganda az ukrajnai magyarokat Ukrajna EU tagsága ellen? (Hosszú poszt),"https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1C2Cd1E6Qe/

⚡️Hogyan használja fel az orbánista propaganda az ukrajnai magyarokat Ukrajna EU és NATO tagsága ellen? - Fülön csíptem a mandineres propagandistát, saját felületén sírta el bánatát. Reakció.

Egy Veczán Zoltán nevű mandineres propagandista cikkben regált csütörtöki Facebook bejegyzésemre “„Orbánista hullarablók”, „propagandisták”, hát, kedves Csehszlovák Kém, ez most nem jött össze” címmel július 11-én. 

Aki nem ismerné az előzményeket, röviden összefoglalom: 2025. július 10-én 17 óra 42 perckor a Facebook oldalon posztoltam egy rövid bejegyzést néhány órával azután, hogy értesültem az orbáni maffiaállam Ukrajna-ellenes dezinformációs propaganda-kampány legújabb felvonásáról. Ebben bemutattam egy Újvári Tibor nevű profilt, és Veczán Zoltán nyilvános megkeresésénej írásos bizonyítékát egy képernyőfotót.

A posztomban feltett kérdést, miszerint ""vajon miért költözik valaki Magyarországról Ukrajnába a háború idején, hogy aztán közösségi oldalain a jelenlegi ukrán állam ellen uszítson és gyalázkodjon?"" korabeli, nyílt forrásokból elérhető információk alapján tettem, ahogy rámutattam arra is, hogy a Fb-profilon felbukkant az oroszpárti orbáni maffiaállam egyik propagandafelületének propagandistája is, majd megjegyeztem, hogy néhány nappal később megjelent az alapvető tények nélküli fabula - a megtörtént esemény orosz propagandista bemutatása a Mandiner felületén. 

Számomra itt az oknyomozás azonban véget is ért, ami a történet magyarországi belpolitikai vonatkozását illeti. A sajnálatos módon elhunyt férfi ügyében jelen tudásunk szerint ellentétes állítások ismerhetők, ezért a személyes tragédia felelősei még nem ismertek. Ezen a szálon az elhunyt családja és az ukrán hatóságok együttműködése hozhat eredményt. Engem azonban szintén érdekelt a mandineres propagandista felbukkanása, majd dezinformációs tevékenysége és következményei.

A Mandiner propagandistájának megjelenése egy bizonytalan hátterű Fb-profilon, majd a néhány nappal később összeállított elbeszélés a nagykép, tehát a magyarországi belpolitika tükrében egészen más megvilágításba helyezi az ügyet. Ha ellépünk a tragikus eseménytől, és az esetet teljes kontextusában vizsgálom meg, az alapján egyértelműen kijelenthető, hogy a Mandiner szándékosan, hullarabló módjára használt fel egy személyes tragédiát, gazdája, az orbáni maffiállam érdekében. 

Nevezzük nevén a dolgokat: a Mandiner egy kárpátaljai magyar halála kapcsán ukrán-ellenes uszítás magját szórta szét a magyarországi közéletben.

 Táptalaját adta, hogy az orbáni maffia politikusainak maszkírozott bűnözői napok óta a legdurvább kollektív népellenes gyűlöletkampányt hajtsák végre a több mint 3 éve katonai támadás alatt álló Ukrajna és népe ellen. Ezért a Mandinernek felelősséget vállalnia kell a jövőben!

🔘 Mi a legújabb ukrán-ellenes uszítás belpolitikai kontextusa? 

Orbán Viktor maffiaállama fennállásának 15. évében már több mint egy éve a bomlás és a belső erózió jeleit mutatja. Az állampárt népszerűsége 10 százalékponttal lemaradt az orbáni maffiaállammal szembeforduló egykori fideszes káder, Magyar Péter mozgalma mögött.

Magyar elszámoltatást és demokratikus fordulatot ígér, és ennek komolyságát nem is annyira Magyar homályos megfogalmazásai, hanem az orbáni maffiaállam pánikreakciói erősítik meg, amelyek a fideszes propagandagépezet látványos kapkodása, mellényúlása és ki nem kényszerített hibák elkövetésében nyilvánulnak meg. 

Mivel a Magyarország ellen bevezetett EU-s szankciók működnek és a tervek szerint a nyomást fokozni fogják az autokrata maffiózóra, ezért Orbánék a pozitív gazdasági, társadalmi és kulturális sikereik, eredményeik hiányában az egyetlen lehetséges megoldáshoz nyúltak: a gyűlöletpropagandához és a félelem felkorbácsolásához.

A Fidesz nevű állampárt teljesen életidegen és neonáci uszítása a szexuális kisebbségek ellen besült. A 21. század 2. évtizedében ez a teljesen abszurd gyűlöletpolitika nem működött Magyarországon sem. Az 1989-1990-es demokratikus rendszerváltás óta nem látott, többszázezres tömeg budapesti felvonulása egyben masszív és méltóságteljes tiltakozás volt az orbáni önkény és országrombolás ellen.

Az LMBTQ-közösség mellett Orbánék másik kipécézett képzeletbeli ellensége Ukrajna állama, annak vezetése és népe lett. Magyarországon az elmúlt hónapokban a szexuális kisebbségek mellett tehát Ukrajna és az ukránok váltak elsőszámú közellenséggé.

A Mandiner munkatársainak helyiértékét Európában egyébként a napokban olvashattátok Szerhij Szidorenko, az Európai Pravda főszerkesztője tollából. Ha az ukránnak nem hiszel, fogadd el egy Prágában élő magyartól. Igyekszem finoman fogalmazni, amikor azt írom, hogy utolsó ruszkiszopó kutyáknak, Európa és Magyarország árulóinak, civilizálatlan, kulturálatlan, európai integrációra képtelen Putyin-csicskáknak tartják Orbánt és maffiaállamának képviselőit tágabb hazánkban, Lisszabontól Luhanszkig. 

Idézet következik:

""A Mandiner Orbán egyik kulcsfontosságú propagandacsatornája. Még más propaganda-oldalakhoz képest is kiemelkedően rossz – folyamatosan álhíreket gyárt, szemét tartalmat terjeszt minden határon túl. A Mandiner nyíltan vállalja lojalitását a Fideszhez. A kormány „stratégiailag fontos” médiumként ismeri el, így állami támogatásban részesül. Azt sem rejtik véka alá, hogy kormányzati zsoldban álló médiakommandósok – ez az Orbán-rendszer működése, amelynek semmi köze a demokráciához.""

Zoltán, nézz ezzel szembe, és fogadd el, hogy ez nem ""ukrán propaganda"", hanem Európában általános és megalapozott álláspont a sörözők hétköznapi világától egészen a politika legmagasabb szintjéig. Ahogy Szidorenko is nagyon okosan berekesztette a meg sem kezdett kommunikációt és rámutatott működésetek indítékaira, úgy nem gondolhatod komolyan, hogy majd ezek után óvatlanul belelépek az általad konstruált orosz propaganda hamis narratívájába.

Felbukkanásod az ügyben július 6-án történt, ami egyben megerősítés, hogy itt bizony egy aljas politikai célból felhasznált tragédia tálalásáról lesz szó. Egy független, kritikus újságírónak, aki a magyar állampolgárok tájékoztatását tartja munkája céljának, pedig itt nincs más dolga, mint, hogy erre a tényre rámutasson. És ennyi volt a dolgom nekem is. Tőled vagy tőletek, független, a valóság bemutatását megcélzó munkára ugyanis nem kell számítani, hiszen minden tevékenységetek Orbán hatalmának biztosítását szolgálja. 

Ezért vagy tehát (orbánista-putyinista) propagandista is.

🔘 Miért állíthatjuk biztosan, hogy a Mandiner szándékos ukrán-ellenes hisztériát gerjeszt?

Azért, mert sem a Mandinert, sem Veczán Zoltánt, sem a tegnapi politikai misét összehívó Bayer Zsoltot, és még  maffiaállam vezetőjét, Orbán Viktort sem érdekelte az orosz-ukrán háború második, teljeskörű inváziós szakaszának több mint 3 éve alatt, hogy hány ukrán állampolgárságú etnikai magyar halt meg az orosz katonai agresszió következtében.  

Mindez már csak azért is érdekes részlet, mert a szavakban a határon túli magyarok ügyét is képviselő orbáni maffiaállam egyetlen alkalommal sem tiltakozott egy ukrajnai magyar halála kapcsán, no nem az orosz nagykövetség előtt, de még személyesen Vlagyimir Putyin vagy Szergej Lavrov előtt sem, hogy 2022. február 24. óta legalább több tucat ukrajnai magyart gyilkolt meg Vlagyimir Putyin terrorállama. 

Márpedig ez a tény minden kétséget kizáróan azt támasztja alá, hogy egy egyébként e poszt írása pillanatáig biztosan nem tudható körülmények között sajnálatos módon elhunyt ukrajnai magyar tragédiáját kizárólag fokozott ukrán-ellenes uszításra használjátok fel belpolitikai haszonszerzés céljából.

Az orbáni maffiaállam felháborodása akkor lenne hiteles és őszinte, ha az elmúlt években legalább 30 alkalommal gyertyagyújtással egybekötött tiltakozást tartottak volna az orosz nagykövetség előtt. Mindez azonban nem történt meg, a kárpátaljai magyarok tragédiáját Orbán kizárólag Ukrajnát önfeladásra késztető hamis “békepolitikája” kapcsán említette, minden személyes részvét nélkül, hideg számításból. 

🔘 Milyen konkrét számokat ismerünk?

1. Az ukrajnai Kárpátalja régió helyi forrásai (civil szervezetek, frontjelentések) alapján 2023-ban tett becslés alapján körülbelül 400 Kárpátaljáról származó etnikai magyar ukrán állampolgár harcolt a fronton. Közülük 30 ukrajnai magyar katona esett el az oroszok ellen vívott védelmi harcok során. 

In: Budai József a háború újabb kárpátaljai magyar áldozata, Kiszo.net.
https://kiszo.net/2023/09/18/budai-jozsef-a-haboru-ujabb-karpataljai-magyar-aldozata/

Forráskritika: A 30 elesett etnikai magyar ukrán állampolgárról szóló kárpátaljai jelentések a helyi magyar közösségektől származnak, konkrét, megerősített dokumentumok és esetleírások alapján. 

2. Orbán Viktor a magyar maffiaállam Keresztapja a bálványosi Tusványos szektatalálkozón 2022. júliusában arról beszélt, hogy a rendelkezésére álló hivatalos adatok szerint 86 ukrajnai magyar halt meg a háborúban. Orbán megszólalásában „hivatalos adatokra” hivatkozott, az általa közölt szám miniszterelnöki pozíciójából nézve, hivatalos magyarországi álláspontnak is tekinthető.

""Az ukránokon kívül csak a magyarok adtak vért az orosz-ukrán háborúban, a nyilvántartások szerint eddig 86 magyar ember halt meg.""
In: https://kormany.hu/hirek/magyarorszag-lokalis-kivetel-lehet-egy-globalis-recesszio-idejen

Forráskritika: ezt a számot a magyar kormány egy hivatalos közlemény részeként mondta be anélkül, hogy az adatról további pontos részleteket közölt volna. Nem tudható, hogy az így közölt áldozatok közül mennyi volt civil és katona, illetve ismeretlen egyéb állampolgárságuk is.

3. Orbán egy másik megszólalásában, 2022. decemberében pedig úgy fogalmazott, hogy „több száz magyar” halt meg az orosz-ukrán háborúban, hangsúlyozva, hogy sokakat tisztként soroztak be az ukrán hadseregbe. A maffiaállam vezetője ezt a becslést magyar hírszerzési és más titkos források, jelentések alapján tette meg. 

""...a háborúban emberek halnak meg, és több száz magyar is meghalt már, akiket az ukrán hadseregbe soroztak be.""
In: https://kormany.hu/hirek/a-rendszervaltas-ota-ez-volt-a-legnehezebb-ev-megis-rendkivuli-teljesitmenyt-nyujtott-magyarorszag

Forráskritika: ez a harmadik becslés ránézésre lehet extrapoláció is, amely az ukrán hadseregben elesettek arányán alapul az ukrajnai lakosság etnikai arányaiból levezetve.

🔘 Mi az ami jelen pillanatban megállapítható?

Nem tudjuk, hogy az orosz-ukrán háború elesett katonái közül pontosan hány etnikai magyar ukrán állampolgár hunyt el. Nem létezik egységes nyilvántartás, nincsenek hivatalosan közzétett adatok sem. 

Ami kijelenthető, hogy egy konzervatív becslés alapján 30-31 etnikai magyar halt meg az orosz-ukrán háborúban, míg egy tágabb orbáni értelmezés szerint 86 és „több száz” etnikai magyar áldozata volt a háborúnak. 

Vagyis, ha csak a konzervatív becslést is vesszük figyelembe, a háború 3,5 éve alatt az orbáni maffiaállam harminc esetben sem kiáltott ""nemzeti tragédiát"", nem szervezett tüntetést az orosz nagykövetség előtt, és elmaradt a miniszterelnök tiltakozása Moszkva felé az ukrajnai magyarok halála után. 

Érdemes megjegyezni, hogy a háború 3,5 éve alatt az orbáni maffiaállam rendszerszerűen lassítja, akadályozza Ukrajna EU-s és NATO-csatlakozását is, amely szintén a kárpátaljai magyarok egzisztenciális érdekeivel megy szembe. Mindezt teszi úgy, hogy az Ukrajnában élő magyarok 83 százaléka egy 2025. júniusi felmérés szerint támogatja szülőföldje, Ukrajna EU-s csatlakozását.

Összességében kijelenthető, hogy Orbán szemében a kárpátaljai magyarok kizárólag a maffiaállam politikájának eszköze és az orbáni propaganda célpontjai hosszú évek, évtizedek óta. A legújabb mandineres dezinformációs hadjárat pedig ennek a szavakban nemzeti politikát képviselő, de a valóságban saját bűnszervezete kizárólagos érdekei alapján működő politika új fejezete.

🔘 Végül egy személyes megjegyzéssel zárom. Kedves Zoltán, vagyis Mandineres Fasz, ha már olyan szépen magadra vetted írásodban ezt a körülményekhez képest meglehetősen visszafogott elnevezésed, a Szatyor Fing példája mutatta az utat.

Lehetséges, hogy az MCC biztosította bunker mélyén egyesek még tologatjátok a nem létező hadosztályaitokat, mások már a ciánkapszulát keresik a zsebükben. Bizony, az orbánisták úgy végzik, mint a nácik 1945-ben, tanulmányozd a következő hónapokban a náci propagandisták sorsát: teljes megadás, betiltás és feloszlatás, független bíróság előtti felelősségrevonás.

Azt hiszed, viccelek? 

Ez a bélyeg örökre rajtad marad, Veczán Zoltán, hogy részt vettél saját hazád tönkretételében. Hasonlóan hozzád és a többi propagandista társadnak is ez a skarlát betű mindenkinek ott virít majd szimbolikusan a homlokán. Az orbáni maffiaállam bukása a modern magyar történelem egyik dicső napja lesz, hatalmas kataklizma és katarzis, amely elhozhatja szembenézést történelmünkkel is.

Várom nyilvános bocsánatkérésed, no nem is elsősorban felém, hanem a magyar társadalom tagjaitól! 

Addig a pillanatig nincs is miről beszélgetnünk.

Looking for Strong Coffee Recommendations Under 1k,"Just wanted to drop a quick warning for anyone considering Bevzilla coffee. I ordered it recently after seeing all the hype and the ""World's Strongest Coffee"" marketing and I honestly feel scammed.

I brewed a cup. Then another. Then I dumped three sachets into my mug like some sort of desperate wizard hoping to summon flavor. But alas, all I got was a cup of warm disappointment.

It smells like... nothing. Tastes like... regret. My nose works fine. My taste buds have given up. Honestly, it feels like someone just repackaged Bru, gave it a gym membership, and hoped we wouldn't notice.

If this is the world's strongest coffee, I'm assuming they meant ""emotionally"" because mine needed a hug after this.

So dear caffeine friends of Reddit, Please rescue me. If you have solid recommendations for strong coffee beans or powder (preferably dark roast or robusta-heavy blends) under ₹1,000 for at least 600gms, drop them below, preferably something with a bold kick and the kind of aroma that slaps you awake from across the kitchen.

I'm ready for whatever you throw at me (except Bevzilla again, pls no). Help a fellow caffeine addict out... Thanks in advance!",1,1752392863.0,AskIndianWomen,16,1.0,False

I am 39 years old, 6'3 and 265 LBS approximately. Most of my life I had been lean and cut, but when I got onto those stupid anti anxiety meds, both prozac and Xanax, I started slowly but surely to put on weight. Aside from just looking bad, it wasn't causing any issues. 

  
Back in 2022 I started to have blood sugar spikes. Nothing super high, but high for me, usually around 210-230 at worst. Went to the DR and he said my A1C was right on the prediabetic/diabetic line, and my Dad also has type 2 that he inherited from his dad despite the fact my Dad has never been overweight a day in his life. My Dad has been diabetic since he was 60, and he is 80 now and just had bloodwork done and the DR said he is in very good shape for an 80 year old man. Either way, I am fighting genetics. As soon as I started having issues, I ordered the factor meal plan keto and lost 25 pounds, my sugar dropped and stayed stable and my A1C went down, until I saw the DR in the Spring of 2023 who ran labs and my cholesterol was out of whack and my triglycerides were high. We looked at the factor meals and jsut one meal had 20 grams of saturated fat. So my DR told me to toss the meals, and even put me on lipitor for a month because he said he was concerned about pancreatitis, he said if I stopped the meals and did the lipitor regimine, my numbers would stable out and they did and after 6 weeks I felt better, problem was I went back to my regular diet I had before and started having blood sugar spikes again. My sugar was a yoyo from 2023 until late 2024 when I tried another meal plan and then started to get control of my sugar levels again. In January of 2025 all my labs were fine, my sugar dropped 36 points to normal, and I was labled as ""early prediabetic"" but my DR said I was making progress. I ate this new meal plan and my sugar stayed the same, but then I started having panic attacks 2-3 times a day every day from October 2024 until February of 2025. my sugar would spike every time I had a panic attack into the 200's and then drop to 150 or lower after I calmed down. It went like that for months until I got back into therapy. I have panic disorder and like i said take 40 MG of prozac and 3 mG of Xanax daily, but lately despite my anxiety, my panic has been under very good control. 

Anyway, I went to the ER one night and complained about my stomach pain and I felt like I had gas that would not pass. They ran a CT On me and ruled out kidney stones, appendix issues, but the DR came in and said ""lighten up on your drinking, you have fat in your liver."" I havent had a drink of any alcohol in 15 years. I asked her what I needed to do, she said ""if you don't drink, you need to lose weight in your midsection and keep lowering your blood sugar and tell your doctor."" Thats all she said as she discharged me. 

I went home and wanted to crawl into a hole and just never come out. I was terrified of telling my parents because they are convinced I belong on my 600 pound life (yes I am overweight but by 50 pounds, not 400 pounds). 

  
In the past 2 months since my diagnosis, I have started taking fish oil, ALA, Biotin, Choline, A multivitamin, and a probiotic daily. I exercise on my staionary bike or do weights for 30-45 mintues every day (or almost) or when I visit my parents I haul brush on their property for at least an hour. I consume a lot of salmon, eggs, sardines, chick peas, decaf coffee with honey, broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, squash, and greatly minimize sugar and stay away from white bread, white rice, white pasta, and anything white. I eat a lot of protein. I was told that whole wheat pasta, brown rice, and whole wheat bread was ok to have a 2-3 times per week. I treat myself to one cane sugar root beer a week, and drink unsweet tea now. I stopped using Tylenol and other NSAID's  and have started to taper down on my anxiety meds because I was told they are rough on your liver. When I do eat out like at Chipotle, I go for all the healthy options such as cheese, avacado made guac, beans, brown rice, and chicken and unsweet tea. When I Do drink cokes, its sugar free. I check my sugar levels every day for almost 60 days and I have had only 4 days when I have had a reading over 200. Most of the time, it hovers around 150 after a meal. 

The biggest thing is that I am terrified of this. I stress out over it all the time, but was told that was the worst thing to do about it. I also had a glucose tolerance test and it came back normal and my blood pressure is 123/73, and I had two EKG's that were both ""clean and textbook"" according to my Dr. Finally, the blood tests show I have perfect liver function, my AST is 23 which is perfect but my ALT is 66, but the DR said it was ""midly elevated, but no cause for concern but something to keep an eye on."" What is odd is that my ALT was 39 just 4 months ago, but I have been told it can fluctuate. No idea why. I also do not have jaundice, my eyes are white with no trace of yellow, my bilirubin is perfect, only my ALT is not perfect. 

I know this is a lot but I would appreciate any feedback. I also have no pain in my stomach and the reason I even had it was because I was constipated and when I started eating veggies, my bowel movements started being full and complete. Like I said, Had I not gotten the CT scan, I would have never known. THanks for any feedback. ",1,1752392456.0,FattyLiverNAFLD,0,1.0,False

It All began when I was 16 years old living at my grandfather's house and I had been prescribed it. I took it and within less than a month. My addiction spiraled out of control. I was not taking incredibly high doses. What was considered to be high by other people. Probably around 40 mg a day. Which really is not a lot. But I was combining it with coffee and other stimulants like nicotine. And at the time I was learning how to play piano. So I would wake up everyday. Barely eat anything for breakfast. Take my Adderall and drink my coffee and then just start playing piano for 3 to 4 hours. And the euphoria was something that was so great that 7 years later I'm still at that piano to the Surrey day. Still listening to music and my wife has not progressed in any way shape or form. 

I took a 3-year break from the drug and I am beginning college again in September so my doctor put me back on it, but I am beginning to realize that this drug is one of the worst things on the planet. It's a lot harder than most people think.

It's not a drug like opioids or alcohol where you can die from overdosing. You really can't overdose on Adderall but it'll put a pretty big toll on your body. He starts to lose hair. You start to look thin

Even if you're eating the same amounts of food that you normally eat, your metabolism is increased and therefore you're just going to look very thin and in general very unhealthy. 

If I'm being honest, yes, I believe the drug has some positive benefits. I have tried taking it as prescribed but at that point I'd rather just not take it as the side effects are too much. And I've also tried taking it only when I really need it and that just leads to me relapsing on incredibly high amounts of it. This is because if I go a long time without taking it, my tolerance gets reset. So it will feel a lot better. 

Please pray for me that I am able to break this addiction. Like I said it's been 7 years and I believe the drug has some positive effects on me but overall all the negatives that way to positively and I would just like God to get rid of the sediction for me.",1,1752392012.0,Christianity,1,1.0,False

Not just people - though God knows that list is short now - but the actual edges. Of rooms. Of memories. Of sounds. I walk into a space and I don’t look at what’s in front of me anymore. I look at the corners. I look at what’s just barely out of view. I listen for the way silence curls. 

There’s a term in medicine - “peripheral awareness.” It’s how we track threats in our environment without looking straight at them. You train yourself to catch motion in the margins. But lately, I think I’ve started to live there. I don’t enter a room and look at what’s in it anymore. I look at what’s just out of it. The corners. The gaps behind door frames. That thin slit of shadow under the bed. Like I’m trying to find the negative space where something used to be. Or maybe where it still is.
Waiting.
I guess this is my way of figuring out whether it’s starting again.

No one ever tells you that paranoia isn’t a spike - it’s a tide. You don’t notice it rising until you’re ankle-deep in it, watching your own reflection dissolve in the water. And then one day, it’s up to your chest, and you can’t remember what dry felt like. That’s what this is. A weather report, maybe. An autopsy-in-progress. I’m writing this down not because I think it’ll help, but because I need to know - 
 If I ever forget again.
 If I ever start calling it “just stress” or “just exhaustion” or “just dreams.”
 Maybe this will be the trail of breadcrumbs I leave for myself.
 If I still know how to follow a trail.

Let me back up. My name’s Maya. I’m 27. Used to work nights at Greystone Memorial Hospital. East Wing, primarily neuro-observation. Graveyard shifts. 10 PM to 6 AM.  I didn’t mind the hours; I liked being the quiet one, the background figure that flickered in and out of patient rooms like a shadow that knew how to work IVs. You’d be surprised how comforting a quiet nurse can be at 4:42 in the morning, when the morphine drip starts to wear off and your own thoughts are louder than the EKG.

I wasn’t one of those Florence Nightingale types. No lofty aspirations. I was in it for the stability. The routine. The fact that the world made sense in measurable units: milligrams, liters, vitals, charts. You fill in the form. You input the numbers. You go home.
At least… that’s how it used to be.
The first time I felt it - that warping, that wrongness - I was in the break room, stirring powdered creamer into a mug of the worst coffee in the state. It was quiet. Fluorescents humming like they always do. Fridge ticking. Window reflected nothing  - just black glass with my own tired outline staring back.
 And then the silence changed. . Everything was as it should be.
Except… I don’t know how to explain this without sounding like a freak.
The silence wasn’t right.
It wasn’t absence-of-noise silence. It was… expectant. Like the room was holding its breath, waiting for something to arrive. And just under that silence was a sound I can only describe as wet static. You know when you plug in old medical equipment and there’s that faint electronic fizz? Imagine that, but under water.
I turned around. The door was open.

I hadn’t left it open.
And sitting there - dead center on the breakroom table - was a manila folder. No name. No patient tag. No initials. Just a generic, off-brand folder like the hundreds we use every week.
Only this one was already open.
Inside was a single sheet of paper. One sentence:
“Final phase protocol begins when Subject regains suspicion.”
No header. No date. No hospital stamp.
I stared at it for way too long. Thought maybe someone was pranking me. Or some intern had misfiled one of those boring ethics study memos we all have to pretend to read. But this felt deliberate. Not like a joke. 
When I touched the paper, it felt… wrong. Heavy. Like it held more weight than it should. The ink was too black, too crisp Not even a font I recognized. The letters were sharp, needle-thin, too perfect to be from our overworked printers. They didn’t look printed at all. They looked pressed. Branded into the page, as if the sentence had been seared onto it like a surgical scar.
I don’t remember hearing footsteps. That’s the part that still bothers me. No doors. No clicks. Nothing. Just one second I was alone, and the next - when I glanced toward the hallway - every corridor outside the break room was empty.
 But not “nobody’s here” empty.
 Thick empty. Like the air itself was listening.
 Like something had just left.

Later that night, I went to do my rounds. Or I tried to.
Because when I got to Observation Room 3B - the one with Mr. Halpern, stroke victim, mostly non-verbal - the door was shut. Not just closed. Locked.
That room never locked. It’s not supposed to lock. Patient observation rooms can’t lock from the outside. That’s protocol. Fire hazard. Safety compliance. All of it.
I knocked. Nothing. I swiped my badge. No green light.
I tried again, harder. Same result. No buzz. No click. Just that silent red light, pulsing like a flatline.
 I stood there for a while, stupidly. Expecting… something. For the door to unmake itself, maybe. I knew that room. And now I couldn’t enter it.
 The longer I stared at the door, the more wrong it looked.
 It wasn’t just closed. It was absent.
 As if it no longer belonged to the building.

Fine, I thought. Maybe maintenance did something stupid. I walked to the security desk to check access logs.
The guy at the monitor- Gary, I think - he smelled faintly like boiled eggs  looked up like I’d slapped him when I asked about 3B.

“Ma’am,” he said, carefully, like he was talking to a drunk person, “East neuro’s been sealed off since May. That whole wing’s under asbestos remediation.”

I blinked. Thought he was messing with me.

“I was literally in there thirty minutes ago,” I said.
 “I’ve been assigned there for the past four weeks. What are you talking about?”

Gary checked the monitor. Scrolled through badge logs. Frowned.
“Your card hasn’t accessed East Wing in over a month.”
He turned the screen toward me. Blank. No entries. No logs. No lights.
Like I’d never been there at all.

And that’s when things really started to come apart.
First: the dreams. Except I’m not sure they were dreams.
In them, I’m lying on a table. Not a hospital bed . Not even in a room.
 On a slab. Smooth. Cold. Stone, I think. Something primal in texture, like it belonged in a temple, not a hospital. Or maybe a tomb. I couldn’t move. Not my limbs. Not my throat. Not even my eyes. Just the sensation of being very, very witnessed. There’s a light above me, the kind you see in ORs, but it’s wrong, too diffuse, flickering in pulses, like it’s breathing. My limbs don’t move. My chest doesn’t rise. I feel like I’m awake, but the air is thick and viscous like I’m inhaling honey. Oil. Congealed blood.
There are voices, but they don’t speak in words. Just tones. Low, long, dragging sounds like a cello string being pulled through mud. And something always happens at the end. Just before I wake up.
A face leans over me. But there are no eyes. Only mirrors . I wake up gasping. Every time.

I tried to talk to someone. A supervisor. A colleague. Hell, even my mom. But every time I started explaining, the words came out wrong. Like they didn’t fit in my mouth anymore. Like I was trying to describe color to a blind person.
Worse: things started vanishing.
I don’t mean disappearing. I mean vanishing from memory.
I’d open my laptop and find an open tab for a patient record I didn’t remember opening. I’d see my own handwriting on reports I didn’t recall writing. There were phrases I’d never use. One note said, “Subject stable. No deviation from containment.”
Not “patient.”
 Subject.
I don’t know how long I can keep writing this.
 The lights in my apartment keep flickering.

And tonight, when I came home from another shift they say I never clocked into…
The folder was waiting.
Same manila cover. New note.
Typed, centered.
“Observation integrity confirmed. Proceed with final cognitive descent.”
My name was at the bottom.
 Signed.
In my handwriting.

Not forged. Not scanned. Not copied.
Me.
 My looped, careful cursive. The way I sign prescriptions.
 The way I sign incident reports.
And for a moment—just a moment—I wasn’t afraid.
 Because it made sense.
 Because of course I would approve this.
 Of course I would consent to the next stage.
Wouldn’t I?

Then I noticed something else. Something I shouldn’t have. 
My ceiling fan was on.,But I hadn’t turned it on. And it was spinning too fast. Not dangerously fast. Just… too regular. Like a clock with no hands. Like it was keeping time for something else. That’s when I saw them.

On the wall, just past the corner of my vision Shadows that didn’t belong to anything. Not cast by furniture. Not cast by me. Just… there. Faint. Elongated. Arranged like observation chairs around a patient bed.  And just faint enough that if I stared directly at them, they’d dissolve. 

So I don’t look directly anymore. I watch the edges. I watch the corners. I listen for the way the silence curls. Because I think the final phase has already begun.

And I don’t know if I’m the last one to notice - or the first one to wake up.",1,1752391932.0,nosleep,1,0.67,False
1lymxs7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1lymxs7/my_husband_doesnt_make_me_feel_special_on_my/,My husband doesn’t make me feel special on my birthday,"Hi Reddit,

I, a 31 yr old woman, just had my birthday and my husband (34 yr old man) kind of dropped the ball on celebrating my day, and this isn’t the first time. Now before you believe I’m conceded and vain, please hear me out.

Some backstory; my family has always made it a point to celebrate birthdays of each of us (a family of 5) because most of us have birthdates super close to each other (I’m on the 5th, my brother on the 4th, my dad the 14th). We would make it a point to have a meal together growing up, sometimes going out to do something like seeing a show, play bowling or even karaoke. It wasn’t a necessity to go out (sometimes we just played cards or board games at home after having a meal together) but going out was a nice thing to do for one another. Growing up, giving gifts to each other was encouraged, but now that we’re all adults, gifts aren’t really needed (I’m the youngest child). We do still
Make it a point however to try to gather to celebrate each other with a meal or to go out if we’re organised enough (not really very often these days). What’s always been really apparent in my family is that anytime a milestone birthday is hit, we take the time to celebrate big. Eg, my sister hired a bouncy castle for her 21st (huge hit with all the adults, so SO fun) and my mum did an outdoor formal dinner for her 60th (I’m talking sequins in the dress code). I myself planned a Murder Mystery party for my 25th birthday set in the 1920s (I have a lot of actor friends, it’s was the actual best watching the commit to their parts 🥰)

Dating my husband, he was exposed to this kind of culture in my family. He would have known that we always got together to celebrate each other as he was invited to multiple of these events. When my sister turned 30, she had an outdoor, sort of twilight (the time of day, not the book) themed party in our backyard (lots and lots of fairy lights) that he attended with me. We were in our 1st year of dating at the time and he was perfectly gentlemanly, asking my parents if they needed assistance with handing out entrees or going out to grab more ice, ect. 

Last year was my 30th birthday where I wanted to plan a party for myself as I wanted to try to execute a particular vision (kind of Carnaval themed) for the event. My husband told me he wanted to plan it for me to take care of me (very sweet sentiment) and that I shouldn’t worry about planning it myself. I told him that was very lovely but if he was sure because I know it’s a big planning effort. He insisted so I released the reins over to him, trusting him to pull it off. This was about 5 months prior to my day. 

I checked in with him as the time came closer to my birthday.

4 months prior:
Me: hey babe, how are you going planning?
Him: I’ve got it don’t worry

3 months prior:
Me: love, have you sent out invites? People will need time to organise for the day/night
Him: babe, you don’t need to worry about it, honestly. I’ve got this
Me: ok, sorry babe, I trust you

At the 2 month mark I kind of left him alone, but I just checked in with him:
Me: hun are you sure you don’t want me to plan it? I know it’s not really your thing and I don’t mind, truely
Him: no babe, I want you to feel special, I want to plan it.

Okay, I let the matter rest completely.

2 weeks before my birthday, he tells me that he’s inviting people but they’re not responding on the Facebook event. At that point he had invited around 20 of my friends for this event thingy he was organising because there was a limit on how many people could participate. I encouraged him to reach out to those people not responding individually as sometimes they don’t check their event invites, sometimes the invite can be perceived as generic, or sometimes they believe the invite was a mistake. Plus reaching out personally was a nice touch anyway. He said he did and he hasn’t heard anything back yet. He told me there only about 5 people coming. Reasons people said they couldn’t make it according to him were: they were working that day, they had another birthday event (or other types of events) they were invited to first, they were away on holidays at that time. Safe to say I was pretty pissed off at that moment, but I did my best to hide it.

The day came and it turned out that he had organised a scavenger hunt through an app that took you all around the city to visit key sites. Great idea, really fun with a large group of people. Turns out only 4 people showed up. 
I’m polite and thankful for what those who turned up but ultimately upset that not more people were able to come. I know my friends. If you give them proper notice they make the effort. So I can’t help but come to the conclusion that my husband didn’t give them the proper notice. 

The hunt was fun. We split into two teams, boys vs girls, and we competed to see who would finish the hunt first, the girls ended up winning. Yay! We have lunch together cause running around the city is tiring and some of our party leave as they needed to get to work eventually. We said our goodbyes and I thanked them for coming. Then it was just me and Hubby. I asked him if we were doing anything else, he says that was it. No dinner with the family, no hanging out with another group of friends for an evening thing, that was all he had planned. We went home at around 2pm.

I later checked with my parents, they had talked with hubby about doing a dinner thing and he told them he would get back in touch with them about it. He never did.

—-

I wanna preface that my husband is not a dick, he is one of the nicest men you’ll ever meet, but he is often disorganised, sucks with time management and he’ll often forget to finish tasks. He’ll often blame this to the ADD that he was diagnosed with when he was a teenager, but he doesn’t see a doctor/therapist or take any medication to manage this. Speaking with him, you’d never know he had this diagnosis.

I have never been diagnosed with anything, but I wouldn’t mind betting I’m ADHD as I’m bubbly, hyperfixate on creative tasks or cleaning and will often sing whatever song happens to be in my head at the time.

Bottom line, there are a lot of doom piles in my home

—-

Fast forward a year later, I’m turning 31. My expectations are not high for a celebration this year. Much like how my family has a lot of birthdays all together, so does my hubby’s family. So when I married him, I had to accept that buying gifts for people’s bday had to be saved for (monetary wise). The order of everyone’s birthdays go as follows: hubby 20th, hubby’s close aunt 27th, brother 4th, me 5th, mother-in-law 7th, grandfather in-law also 7th, father 14th, sister-in-law 22nd. 

This year my MIL decided to try to pool all of our birthdays into one celebration by making a reservation at SkyFeast at the Centre Point Tower in Sydney. Awesome for its view. 

Hubby prefaces that we’d need to split the bill because he hasn’t done enough shifts the week prior to be able to pay for us both. I’m disappointed at this, but I understand. He tells me when we need to leave to get the restaurant and I go about getting myself ready for the day.  

He gets a call from his mum who asks where we are as she requested a check in because the restaurant is somewhat exclusive. We hadn’t left home yet. Turns out he read when we needed to be at the restaurant wrong and thought we had another half-an-hour on our hands. At this point he starts cussing himself out and falls into a “I hate what I’ve just done” type of mood. He rushes us out of the door, we catch the next available train and arrive at the place 30mins late. Everyone understands, they’re very forgiving, but we all know that it sucked we weren’t on time. 

We have lunch together, it was ok tasting but the view was amazing. Hubby asks if we can order drinks, on my dime of course because he didn’t have enough shifts, and I get him a whiskey/coke and myself a disappointing mimosa (not very much liquid for the amount they charged in my opinion). I have lovely conversations with his family, it’s nice to catch up with them as we don’t live close to one another. We finish our meal and head back to the QVB as my in-laws are coffee addicts and apparently the coffee they consumed at the restaurant wasn’t enough, so they were seeking a cafe. I went along with them. Hubby’s having a great time talking with his family, I’ve kind of taken a back seat to the conversations as a lot of the anecdotes he’s said I’ve heard him say to other people (art of the conversation). 

Eventually we part from them, I ask hubby if he’d be interested in going to see a play that night. I had found tickets available for a showing of a play that night, only problem was they weren’t sitting next to each other (last minute tix often aren’t). He said he’d rather wait for another night to get tix seated together so we can enjoy the show together. I’m disappointed, but he promises to get tickets for another time. We go home, and he let me play video games (they’re fun kinda, but I’m more of a book girly than gamer). He makes me dinner by buying a frozen lasagna from the store and making up a side salad from whatever was in the fridge. It was yummy.

He tells me he bought me a gift but that it’s delayed in the post. It has been 2 weeks since my birthday (presumably he purchased this prior to my bday but who knows) and whatever he’s bought has not turned up. 

——

Congrats if you’ve gotten to the end of all of that, sorry for the long story, needed to just kind of get it all out.

I need advice here Reddit. Are my expectations too high here? Or does he need to step it up? I’m finding I can’t trust him to follow through on promises because he’s made a lot that he’s not been able to follow through on (be it time or money) and I’m afraid that im not going to feel special on my birthday ever again. How can I help him rise to the occasion

Info: 
- we’ve been married for almost 5 years now, no kids as of yet
- for hubby’s birthday, I organised for him to go go-karting with his group of friends and have dinner afterwards. I couldn’t make it cause I was sick on the day unfortunately but I had every intention of attending leading up to his day. I insisted he charge my card at the restaurant he went to so he didn’t need to worry about money on the day.",1,1752391859.0,Advice,1,0.66,False

1lymufj,https://i.redd.it/9jldcnuqclcf1.jpeg,"Don’t Skip Unflavored Whey Deals, a ₹200 Hack to Flavor It","Hey folks,

If you find a good deal on unflavored whey, just grab it. You can easily turn it into flavored whey at home for just ₹200-₹300 extra, and the taste is totally customizable.

Just wanted to share a quick experiment I did with unflavored whey that turned out surprisingly well.

I recently bought a 1kg pack of **unflavored whey protein** (to save money), and instead of paying ₹500–1000 more for the flavored version, I tried **making my own mix at home**.

# What I Tried (Trial Batch - 3 Scoops / ~120g Total):

* **Whey Protein (unflavored):** 105g
* **Cocoa Powder:** 11g 
* **Stevia:** 4g 
* **Optional:** \~3–4g instant coffee powder (I like strong mocha flavor)

 **Taste:** Pretty solid, bold chocolate-coffee taste

 **Coffee was intentionally strong as i take it as pre workout**, and I might add slightly more stevia next time for better sweetness balance.

Macros **Per 40g scoop:**

* **Calories:** \~150 kcal
* **Protein:** \~28g
* **Carbs:** \~2.7g

**If you’re trying this for the first time, I’d highly recommend starting small, maybe a 10-scoop batch.** That way, you can tweak the sweetness, cocoa, or coffee level to your taste before scaling up to 1kg.

# How to Scale This for 1kg of Unflavored Whey:

If you like the trial batch, you can scale it up easily for 1kg of whey.

Just mix:

* 1000g of unflavored whey
* Around 100–110g of cocoa powder (Christopher Cocoa, ₹130 for 100g)
* About 30–35g of stevia (adjust based on how sweet you like it), ₹75 for 35g
* Optionally, 30–40g of instant coffee powder if you want a mocha flavor. Additional ₹100

This gives you a total of around 1.13kg of flavored whey mix, which makes about 28 scoops of 40g each.

Cost of the added ingredients is about ₹200, making it a budget-friendly way to customize your protein.

Next up, I’m thinking of trying a fruity version using **freeze-dried fruit powders** (like strawberry or mango). If anyone’s tried that, would love tips!

Would milk make it more creamy? Or would it work against the ‘sorbet’ texture? Water would dilute the taste of the fruit presumably (but then you could compensate by adding a splash of a flavoured coffee syrup or liquid sweetener?)

A few weeks before this, they were telling me about their challenges with dating and said this thing about how they wished we met when I was 30 and they were 35 (I’m 25 and they’re 40🤮 and so overweight just gross old fat guy vibes with a gross long beard) I hadn’t given it any attention. 

I was having a really rough day so we met for some
coffee to talk about it. Somewhere along the way they decide to say this despite mentioning that they know I could be upset about this because I had been spiraling about how an entire department of guys were harassing me and I had finally reported it and gotten it to stop. But they said I have feelings for you and they mentioned it happened because “I talk to them” and I’m so “nice” and we “talk all the time” (which we did because I thought we were friends) they don’t have any friends in our city and no one to hang out with so they often say things like “you know I have no one here to hang out with / you know I’m alone” and even today they tried to get me to hang out with them and said they could almost cry going to the movie alone (I never do and the coffee was an exception because I just really needed a friend to talk to.

I told them I can’t reciprocate and then they said this thing about how they’d be here if I ever changed my mind and asked if I ever would in the long run and I said if it was someone I liked idk and yeah I removed them on my Instagram today because I’m feeling creeped out at the thought that they might’ve been beating it to my photos this entire time. 

I’m sure they’ll confront me about removing but I want to just write out this thing about how they themself knew I could be upset about it because of the issue I have with the guys at work and then still saying that. And then after I say I’m not interested saying they’re here if I change my mind. 

I said this tongue in cheek thing about how I’m tired about old 40+ overweight guys thinking they have a chance with me on teams the other day when telling him about how I reported the department of guys bothering me and I think they did get the jab because they said I don’t think I’m the right person to talk to about this. 

If confronted about removing on Instagram would a text like this be okay:
“Look honestly you said this to me when you were telling me about how you have feelings for me but the fact that you knew this could bother me because of my experiences with stalking (a man in my neighborhood stalked me for half a year) / harassment (work) and you still told me this? Also I haven’t done anything to give you any sort of reason to act on those feelings or tell me about them like I’m going to return them. I’m questioning aspects of our friendship now and how supportive and nice you were to me because of this and even just being told by you that you’ll wait around.. I can’t let you think that there will be any hope of dating me or being with me ever. You’ve been a great friend to me but I also need to draw the boundary in making sure you fully understand that it will never ever happen.”

When we got there he would NOT open his mouth and would only make distressed noises, which greatly worried the doctor. After a few minutes his cheeks began to puff and he was given a barf bag, in which he drooled out a bunch of spit that he had been holding the entire twenty minutes we’d been there, because there was some blood in his mouth and it was grossing him out. After that he was FINE. Totally normal. We watched SpongeBob on the TV and he yapped at me so much I had to repeatedly ask him to hold on (while I texted my wife updates). They got him an X-ray and said that two of his teeth looked cracked but nothing else was wrong… but then kept saying his jaw might be broken or his gums might be messed up, they can’t know for sure. Over and over. We saw nothing on the X-ray but that doesn’t mean nothing is wrong. They said they needed to do a CT scan to really check for sure but that they didn’t *have* a CT machine, they decided they wanted to send us in an ambulance roughly an hour away to a big city in the middle of the night so that we could really make sure. With no ride home. 

I asked them if we could go to ANY other hospital instead, something closer perhaps, but they were SET on this very far away hospital instead. I told them I really didn’t feel comfortable forcing my already upset child into an ambulance for an hour long ride, more testing, and then an expensive taxi ride home with a stranger and no car seat at what would probably be 2-3am. They said they *could* discharge me and I could find a different hospital in the morning if I wanted to, which obviously sounded like the better option. So I chose that one. 

They got me ready, I signed the early release form, then for some reason they handed me transfer paperwork for the hour-away hospital? I reminded them that I wouldn’t be going to that hospital and they seemed to acknowledge me, but then kept saying “as far as we’re aware, you’re headed to hour-away hospital” “as far as we know this is where you’re headed” in a really ominous intentionally obtuse way. I felt like I was talking to a wall, it was really weird. They weren’t saying that they RECOMMENDED that hospital, they kept saying that’s where they think I’m going, even though I was repeatedly telling them that I am NOT going there, and that I’m not going *anywhere* until the morning. 

I explained the situation to my wife when we got home and she’s really freaked out now, like I misunderstood them and I’m supposed to be meeting someone at that hospital tonight. But they KNOW I’m not, I made that explicitly clear. Could anyone give me some insider-insight on the weirdness that was my very discharge situation? Is this typical ER behavior to like, rid themselves of liability? Acting intentionally clueless?

- Partnerships with Singapore-based entrepreneurs
- Leveraging AI for passive income streams
- Consulting opportunities in the region

**My situation:**

- German engineering background but connected to Singapore through family
- Interested in the intersection of AI technology and financial independence
- Looking for like-minded people who see AI as a tool for wealth building

Has anyone here explored AI-driven businesses or investments? Would love to hear experiences or discuss potential collaborations that align with FI goals.

Open to coffee chats (virtually or when I’m in Singapore) with anyone interested in AI, entrepreneurship, or building location-independent income.

## Key Features Analysis

The best lily of the valley candles are distinguished by several key features that contribute to their overall quality and fragrance experience.

**Fragrance Authenticity:** The hallmark of a superior lily of the valley candle is the accuracy of its scent profile.

A truly exceptional candle captures the essence of the flower itself, with its sweet, green, and slightly spicy notes. Synthetic interpretations often fall short, lacking the nuanced complexity of the real blossom. The best candles utilize high-quality fragrance oils or essential oil blends to recreate the authentic aroma.

**Wax Composition:** The type of wax used significantly impacts the candle's performance and environmental impact.

Soy wax, beeswax, and coconut wax are popular choices for their clean burning properties and sustainability. Paraffin wax, while less expensive, can release potentially harmful chemicals and soot. A well-formulated wax blend ensures a consistent burn, optimal fragrance diffusion, and minimal residue.

**Wick Material:** The wick plays a crucial role in the candle's burning characteristics.

Cotton wicks, often pre-waxed, are a common choice, providing a reliable flame and even melt pool. Wooden wicks offer a unique crackling sound, adding to the ambiance, but require careful maintenance. The ideal wick size is determined by the candle's diameter to ensure complete wax consumption and prevent tunneling.

**Burn Time:** The longevity of a candle is an important factor for many consumers.

A longer burn time translates to more value and extended enjoyment of the fragrance. High-quality waxes and proper wick selection contribute to a slow and even burn. Reputable manufacturers typically specify the estimated burn time on the product label, allowing consumers to make informed purchasing decisions.

**Container Design:** The aesthetic appeal of the candle container enhances the overall experience.

Glass jars, ceramic vessels, and metal tins are common choices, each offering a distinct visual style. The container should be heat-resistant and designed to safely contain the molten wax. A well-designed container complements the fragrance and adds to the overall decor of the room.

**Scent Throw:** Scent throw refers to the candle's ability to disperse its fragrance throughout a space.

A strong scent throw fills the room with the desired aroma, while a weak scent throw may be barely noticeable. The concentration of fragrance oil in the wax, the type of wax used, and the wick size all influence the scent throw. The ideal scent throw is a matter of personal preference, with some preferring a subtle fragrance and others desiring a more pronounced aroma.

## Core Benefits

A high-quality lily of the valley candle offers numerous benefits beyond simply providing a pleasant scent.

**Creates a Relaxing Atmosphere:** The delicate and calming fragrance of lily of the valley promotes relaxation and reduces stress.

Its gentle floral notes create a serene ambiance, perfect for unwinding after a long day or creating a peaceful environment for meditation or yoga. The candle's soft glow further enhances the relaxing effect, transforming any room into a tranquil sanctuary.

**Enhances Home Decor:** A well-chosen lily of the valley candle serves as a stylish accent piece, adding a touch of elegance to any room.

The container design can complement the existing decor, while the flickering flame creates a warm and inviting atmosphere. Whether placed on a coffee table, bookshelf, or bedside table, a lily of the valley candle enhances the overall aesthetic appeal of the home.

**Evokes Positive Emotions and Memories:** The fragrance of lily of the valley is often associated with spring, renewal, and cherished memories.

The scent can evoke feelings of joy, nostalgia, and optimism, creating a positive emotional connection. For many, the fragrance brings back memories of gardens, weddings, or other special occasions, adding a personal and sentimental touch to the home.

**Provides a Natural Air Freshener:** Unlike synthetic air fresheners that can contain harmful chemicals, a high-quality lily of the valley candle offers a natural and safer way to freshen the air.

The fragrance oils or essential oil blends used in the candle neutralize unpleasant odors and create a clean and inviting scent. This is particularly beneficial for those with sensitivities to synthetic fragrances or allergies.

## FAQs Section

**How can I maximize the burn time of my lily of the valley candle?**

To maximize burn time, always trim the wick to 1/4 inch before each use. This prevents smoking and ensures a clean, even burn. Allow the candle to burn for at least 2-3 hours during the first use to create a full melt pool. Avoid burning the candle for more than 4 hours at a time to prevent overheating.

**Is lily of the valley fragrance safe for pets?**

While lily of the valley is toxic to pets if ingested, the fragrance from a candle is generally safe. However, it's always best to keep candles out of reach of pets and ensure proper ventilation in the room. If you notice any signs of respiratory distress in your pet, discontinue use and consult with a veterinarian.

**How do I clean up spilled wax from my lily of the valley candle?**

Allow the wax to cool and harden completely. Then, use a blunt object, such as a spoon or credit card, to gently scrape the wax off the surface. For fabric, place a paper towel over the wax and iron on low heat to melt the wax and absorb it into the paper towel. Repeat as needed.

**What are the key differences between soy wax and paraffin wax candles?**

Soy wax is a natural wax derived from soybeans, while paraffin wax is a petroleum byproduct. Soy wax burns cleaner and slower than paraffin wax, producing less soot and releasing fragrance more gradually. Soy wax is also biodegradable and more environmentally friendly. Paraffin wax is less expensive, but it can release potentially harmful chemicals and has a stronger scent throw.

## Buying Recommendations & Conclusion

When selecting a lily of the valley candle, consider your priorities regarding fragrance authenticity, burn quality, and environmental impact. If you value a truly authentic scent and a clean burn, opt for a candle made with soy wax or beeswax and high-quality fragrance oils or essential oil blends.

Overall, a high-quality lily of the valley candle represents a worthwhile investment for those seeking to create a relaxing, fragrant, and aesthetically pleasing home environment. While not without potential drawbacks, such as price and potential for allergic reactions, its strengths in fragrance authenticity, burn quality, and emotional benefits make it a valuable consideration for home decor enthusiasts, stress relief seekers, and scent-sensitive individuals alike.

  It was five o’clock on a winter’s morning in Syria. Alongside the platform at Aleppo stood the train grandly designated in railway guides as the Taurus Express. It consisted of a kitchen and dining car, a sleeping car and two local coaches.  
  
  By the step leading up into the sleeping car stood a young French lieutenant, resplendent in uniform, conversing with a small lean man, muffled up to the ears, of whom nothing was visible but a pink-tipped nose and the two points of an upward curled moustache.  
  
  It was freezingly cold, and this job of seeing off a distinguished stranger was not one to be envied, but Lieutenant Dubosc performed his part manfully. Graceful phrases fell from his lips in polished French. Not that he knew what it was all about. There had been rumours, of course, as there always were in such cases. The General—his General’s—temper had grown worse and worse. And then there had come this Belgian stranger—all the way from England, it seemed. There had been a week—a week of curious tensity. And then certain things had happened. A very distinguished officer had committed suicide, another had resigned—anxious faces had suddenly lost their anxiety, certain military precautions were relaxed. And the General—Lieutenant Dubosc’s own particular General—had suddenly looked ten years younger.  
  
  Dubosc had overheard part of a conversation between him and the stranger. “You have saved us, mon cher,” said the General emotionally, his great white moustache trembling as he spoke. “You have saved the honour of the French Army—you have averted much bloodshed! How can I thank you for acceding to my request? To have come so far—”  
  
  To which the stranger (by name M. Hercule Poirot) had made a fitting reply including the phrase, “But indeed do I not remember that once you saved my life?” And then the General had made another fitting reply to that disclaiming any merit for that past service, and with more mention of France, of Belgium, of glory, of honour and of such kindred things they had embraced each other heartily and the conversation had ended.  
  
  As to what it had all been about, Lieutenant Dubosc was still in the dark, but to him had been delegated the duty of seeing off M. Poirot by the Taurus Express, and he was carrying it out with all the zeal and ardour befitting a young officer with a promising career ahead of him.  
  
  “Today is Sunday,” said Lieutenant Dubosc. “Tomorrow, Monday evening, you will be in Stamboul.”  
  
  It was not the first time he had made this observation. Conversations on the platform, before the departure of a train, are apt to be somewhat repetitive in character.  
  
  “That is so,” agreed M. Poirot.  
  
  “And you intend to remain there a few days, I think?”  
  
  “Mais oui. Stamboul, it is a city I have never visited. It would be a pity to pass through—comme ça.” He snapped his fingers descriptively. “Nothing presses—I shall remain there as a tourist for a few days.”  
  
  “La Sainte Sophie, it is very fine,” said Lieutenant Dubosc, who had never seen it.  
  
  A cold wind came whistling down the platform. Both men shivered. Lieutenant Dubosc managed to cast a surreptitious glance at his watch. Five minutes to five—only five minutes more!  
  
  Fancying that the other man had noticed his surreptitious glance, he hastened once more into speech.  
  
  “There are few people travelling this time of year,” he said, glancing up at the windows of the sleeping car above them.  
  
  “That is so,” agreed M. Poirot.  
  
  “Let us hope you will not be snowed up in the Taurus!”  
  
  “That happens?”  
  
  “It has occurred, yes. Not this year, as yet.”  
  
  “Let us hope, then,” said M. Poirot. “The weather reports from Europe, they are bad.”  
  
  “Very bad. In the Balkans there is much snow.”  
  
  “In Germany too, I have heard.”  
  
  “Eh bien,” said Lieutenant Dubosc hastily as another pause seemed to be about to occur. “Tomorrow evening at seven-forty you will be in Constantinople.”  
  
  “Yes,” said M. Poirot, and went on desperately, “La Sainte Sophie, I have heard it is very fine.”  
  
  “Magnificent, I believe.”  
  
  Above their heads the blind of one of the sleeping car compartments was pushed aside and a young woman looked out.  
  
  Mary Debenham had had little sleep since she left Baghdad on the preceding Thursday. Neither in the train to Kirkuk, nor in the Rest House at Mosul, nor last night on the train had she slept properly. Now, weary of lying wakeful in the hot stuffiness of her overheated compartment, she got up and peered out.  
  
  This must be Aleppo. Nothing to see, of course. Just a long, poor-lighted platform with loud furious altercations in Arabic going on somewhere. Two men below her window were talking French. One was a French officer, the other was a little man with enormous moustaches. She smiled faintly. She had never seen anyone quite so heavily muffled up. It must be very cold outside. That was why they heated the train so terribly. She tried to force the window down lower, but it would not go.  
  
  The Wagon Lit conductor had come up to the two men. The train was about to depart, he said. Monsieur had better mount. The little man removed his hat. What an egg-shaped head he had. In spite of her preoccupations Mary Debenham smiled. A ridiculous-looking little man. The sort of little man one could never take seriously.  
  
  Lieutenant Dubosc was saying his parting speech. He had thought it out beforehand and had kept it till the last minute. It was a very beautiful, polished speech.  
  
  Not to be outdone, M. Poirot replied in kind.  
  
  “En voiture, Monsieur,” said the Wagon Lit conductor.  
  
  With an air of infinite reluctance M. Poirot  
climbed aboard the train. The conductor climbed after him. M. Poirot waved his hand. Lieutenant Dubosc came to the salute. The train, with a terrific jerk, moved slowly forward.  
  
  “Enfin!” murmured M. Hercule Poirot.  
  
  “Brrrrr,” said Lieutenant Dubosc, realizing to the full how cold he was….  
  
  II  
  
  “Voilà, Monsieur.” The conductor displayed to Poirot with a dramatic gesture the beauty of his sleeping compartment and the neat arrangement of his luggage. “The little valise of Monsieur, I have placed it here.”  
  
  His outstretched hand was suggestive. Hercule Poirot placed in it a folded note.  
  
  “Merci, Monsieur.” The conductor became brisk and businesslike. “I have the tickets of Monsieur. I will also take the passport, please. Monsieur breaks his journey in Stamboul, I understand?”  
  
  M. Poirot assented.  
  
  “There are not many people travelling, I imagine?” he said.  
  
  “No, Monsieur. I have only two other passengers—both English. A Colonel from India, and a young English lady from Baghdad. Monsieur requires anything?”  
  
  Monsieur demanded a small bottle of Perrier.  
  
  Five o’clock in the morning is an awkward time to board a train. There was still two hours before dawn. Conscious of an inadequate night’s sleep, and of a delicate mission successfully accomplished, M. Poirot curled up in a corner and fell asleep.  
  
  When he awoke it was half-past nine, and he sallied forth to the restaurant car in search of hot coffee.  
  
  There was only one occupant at the moment, obviously the young English lady referred to by the conductor. She was tall, slim and dark—perhaps twenty-eight years of age. There was a kind of cool efficiency in the way she was eating her breakfast and in the way she called to the attendant to bring her more coffee, which bespoke a knowledge of the world and of travelling. She wore a dark-coloured travelling dress of some thin material eminently suitable for the heated atmosphere of the train.  
  
  M. Hercule Poirot, having nothing better to do, amused himself by studying her without appearing to do so.  
  
  She was, he judged, the kind of young woman who could take care of herself with perfect ease wherever she went. She had poise and efficiency. He rather liked the severe regularity of her features and the delicate pallor of her skin. He liked the burnished black head with its neat waves of hair, and her eyes, cool, impersonal and grey. But she was, he decided, just a little too efficient to be what he called “jolie femme.”  
  
  Presently another person entered the restaurant car. This was a tall man of between forty and fifty, lean of figure, brown of skin, with hair slightly grizzled round the temples.  
  
  “The colonel from India,” said Poirot to himself.  
  
  The newcomer gave a little bow to the girl.  
  
  “Morning, Miss Debenham.”  
  
  “Good morning, Colonel Arbuthnot.”  
  
  The Colonel was standing with a hand on the chair opposite her.  
  
  “Any objection?” he asked.  
  
  “Of course not. Sit down.”  
  
  “Well, you know, breakfast isn’t always a chatty meal.”  
  
  “I should hope not. But I don’t bite.”  
  
  The Colonel sat down.  
  
  “Boy,” he called in peremptory fashion.  
  
  He gave an order for eggs and coffee.  
  
  His eyes rested for a moment on Hercule Poirot, but they passed on indifferently. Poirot, reading the English mind correctly, knew that he had said to himself, “Only some damned foreigner.”  
  
  True to their nationality, the two English people were not chatty. They exchanged a few brief remarks, and presently the girl rose and went back to her compartment.  
  
  At lunch time the other two again shared a table and again they both completely ignored the third passenger. Their conversation was more animated than at breakfast. Colonel Arbuthnot talked of the Punjab, and occasionally asked the girl a few questions about Baghdad where it became clear that she had been in a post as governess. In the course of conversation they discovered some mutual friends which had the immediate effect of making them more friendly and less stiff. They discussed old Tommy Somebody and Jerry Someone Else. The Colonel inquired whether she was going straight through to England or whether she was stopping in Stamboul.  
  
  “No, I’m going straight on.”  
  
  “Isn’t that rather a pity?”  
  
  “I came out this way two years ago and spent three days in Stamboul then.”  
  
  “Oh, I see. Well, I may say I’m very glad you are going right through, because I am.”  
  
  He made a kind of clumsy little bow, flushing a little as he did so.  
  
  “He is susceptible, our Colonel,” thought Hercule Poirot to himself with some amusement. “The train, it is as dangerous as a sea voyage!”  
  
  Miss Debenham said evenly that that would be very nice. Her manner was slightly repressive.  
  
  The Colonel, Hercule Poirot noticed, accompanied her back to her compartment. Later they passed through the magnificent scenery of the Taurus. As they looked down towards the Cilician Gates, standing in the corridor side by side, a sigh came suddenly from the girl. Poirot was standing near them and heard her murmur:  
  
  “It’s so beautiful! I wish—I wish—”  
  
  “Yes?”  
  
  “I wish, I could enjoy it!”  
  
  Arbuthnot did not answer. The square line of his jaw seemed a little sterner and grimmer.  
  
  “I wish to Heaven you were out of all this,” he said.  
  
  “Hush, please. Hush.”  
  
  “Oh! it’s all right.” He shot a slightly annoyed glance in Poirot’s direction. Then he went on: “But I don’t like the idea of your being a governess—at the beck and call of tyrannical mothers and their tiresome brats.”  
  
  She laughed with just a hint of uncontrol in the sound.  
  
  “Oh! you mustn’t think that. The downtrodden governess is quite an exploded myth. I can assure you that it’s the parents who are afraid of being bullied by me.”  
  
  They said no more. Arbuthnot was, perhaps, ashamed of his outburst.  
  
  “Rather an odd little comedy that I watch here,” said Poirot to himself thoughtfully.  
  
  He was to remember that thought of his later.  
  
  They arrived at Konya that night about half-past eleven. The two English travellers got out to stretch their legs, pacing up and down the snowy platform.  
  
  M. Poirot was content to watch the teeming activity of the station through a window pane. After about ten minutes, however, he decided that a breath of air would not perhaps be a bad thing, after all. He made careful preparations, wrapping himself in several coats and mufflers and encasing his neat boots in goloshes. Thus attired he descended gingerly to the platform and began to pace its length. He walked out beyond the engine.  
  
  It was the voices which gave him the clue to the two indistinct figures standing in the shadow of a traffic van. Arbuthnot was speaking.  
  
  “Mary—”  
  
  The girl interrupted him.  
  
  “Not now. Not now. When it’s all over. When it’s behind us—then—”  
  
  Discreetly M. Poirot turned away. He wondered.  
  
  He would hardly have recognized the cool, efficient voice of Miss Debenham….  
  
  “Curious,” he said to himself.  
  
  The next day he wondered whether, perhaps, they had quarrelled. They spoke little to each other. The girl, he thought, looked anxious. There were dark circles under her eyes.  
  
  It was about half-past two in the afternoon when the train came to a halt. Heads were poked out of windows. A little knot of men were clustered by the side of the line looking and pointing at something under the dining car.  
  
  Poirot leaned out and spoke to the Wagon Lit conductor who was hurrying past. The man answered and Poirot drew back his head and, turning, almost collided with Mary Debenham who was standing just behind him.  
  
  “What is the matter?” she asked rather breathlessly in French. “Why are we stopping?”  
  
  “It is nothing, Mademoiselle. It is something that has caught fire under the dining car. Nothing se  
rious. It is put out. They are now repairing the damage. There is no danger, I assure you.”  
  
  She made a little abrupt gesture, as though she were waving the idea of danger aside as something completely unimportant.  
  
  “Yes, yes, I understand that. But the time!”  
  
  “The time?”  
  
  “Yes, this will delay us.”  
  
  “It is possible—yes,” agreed Poirot.  
  
  “But we can’t afford delay! The train is due in at 6:55 and one has to cross the Bosphorus and catch the Simplon Orient Express the other side at nine o’clock. If there is an hour or two of delay we shall miss the connection.”  
  
  “It is possible, yes,” he admitted.  
  
  He looked at her curiously. The hand that held the window bar was not quite steady, her lips too were trembling.  
  
  “Does it matter to you very much, Mademoiselle?” he asked.  
  
  “Yes. Yes, it does. I—I must catch that train.”  
  
  She turned away from him and went down the corridor to join Colonel Arbuthnot.  
  
  Her anxiety, however, was needless. Ten minutes later the train started again. It arrived at Haydapassar only five minutes late, having made up time on the journey.  
  
  The Bosphorus was rough and M. Poirot did not enjoy the crossing. He was separated from his travelling companions on the boat, and did not see them again.  
  
  On arrival at the Galata Bridge he drove straight to the Tokatlian Hotel.  
  
  **Two**  
  
  THE TOKATLIAN HOTEL  
  
  At the Tokatlian, Hercule Poirot asked for a room with bath. Then he stepped over to the concierge’s desk and inquired for letters.  
 There were three waiting for him and a telegram. His eyebrows rose a little at the sight of the telegram. It was unexpected.  
  
  He opened it in his usual neat, unhurried fashion. The printed words stood out clearly.  
  
  “Development you predicted in Kassner Case has come unexpectedly please return immediately.”  
  
  “Voilà ce qui est embêtant,” murmured Poirot vexedly. He glanced up at the clock.  
  
  “I shall have to go on tonight,” he said to the concierge. “At what time does the Simplon Orient leave?”  
  
  “At nine o’clock, Monsieur.”  
  
  “Can you get me a sleeper?”  
  
  “Assuredly, Monsieur. There is no difficulty this time of year. The trains are almost empty. First-class or second?”  
  
  “First.”  
  
  “Très bien, Monsieur. How far are you going?”  
  
  “To London.”  
  
  “Bien, Monsieur. I will get you a ticket to London and reserve your sleeping car accommodation in the Stamboul-Calais coach.”  
  
  Poirot glanced at the clock again. It was ten minutes to eight.  
  
  “I have time to dine?”  
  
  “But assuredly, Monsieur.”  
  
  The little Belgian nodded. He went over and cancelled his room order and crossed the hall to the restaurant.  
  
  As he was giving his order to the waiter a hand was placed on his shoulder.  
  
  “Ah! mon vieux, but this is an unexpected pleasure,” said a voice behind him.  
  
  The speaker was a short, stout elderly man, his hair cut en brosse. He was smiling delightedly.  
  
  Poirot sprang up.  
  
  “M. Bouc.”  
  
  “M. Poirot.”  
  
  M. Bouc was a Belgian, a director of the Compagnie Internationale des Wagons Lits, and his acquaintance with the former star of the Belgian Police Force dated back many years.  
  
  “You find yourself far from home, mon cher,” said M. Bouc.  
  
  “A little affair in Syria.”  
  
  “Ah! And you return home—when?”  
  
  “Tonight.”  
  
  “Splendid! I, too. That is to say, I go as far as Lausanne, where I have affairs. You travel on the Simplon-Orient, I presume?”  
  
  “Yes. I have just asked them to get me a sleeper. It was my intention to remain here some days, but I have received a telegram recalling me to England on important business.”  
  
  “Ah!” sighed M. Bouc. “Les affaires—les affaires! But you—you are at the top of the tree nowadays, mon vieux!”  
  
  “Some little success I have had, perhaps.” Hercule Poirot tried to look modest but failed signally.  
  
  Bouc laughed.  
  
  “We will meet later,” he said.  
  
  Hercule Poirot addressed himself to the task of keeping his moustaches out of the soup.  
  
  That difficult task accomplished, he glanced round him whilst waiting for the next course. There were only about half a dozen people in the restaurant, and of those half-dozen there were only two that interested Hercule Poirot.  
  
  These two sat at a table not far away. The younger was a likeable-looking man of thirty, clearly an American. It was, however, not he but his companion who had attracted the little detective’s attention.  
  
  He was a man of between sixty and seventy. From a little distance he had the bland aspect of a philanthropist. His slightly bald head, his domed forehead, the smiling mouth that displayed a very white set of false teeth, all seemed to speak of a benevolent personality. Only the eyes belied this assumption. They were small, deep set and crafty. Not only that. As the man, making some remark to his young companion, glanced across the room, his gaze stopped on Poirot for a moment, and just for that second there was a strange malevolence, and unnatural tensity in the glance.  
  
  Then he rose.  
  
  “Pay the bill, Hector,” he said.  
  
  His voice was slightly husky in tone. It had a queer, soft, dangerous quality.  
  
  When Poirot rejoined his friend in the lounge, the other two men were just leaving the hotel. Their luggage was being brought down. The younger was supervising the process. Presently he opened the glass door and said:  
  
  “Quite ready now, Mr. Ratchett.”  
  
  The elder man grunted an assent and passed out.  
  
  “Eh bien,” said Poirot. “What do you think of those two?”  
  
  “They are Americans,” said M. Bouc.  
  
  “Assuredly they are Americans. I meant what did you think of their personalities?”  
  
  “The young man seemed quite agreeable.”  
  
  “And the other?”  
  
  “To tell you the truth, my friend, I did not care for him. He produced on me an unpleasant impression. And you?”  
  
  Hercule Poirot was a moment before replying.  
  
  “When he passed me in the restaurant,” he said at last, “I had a curious impression. It was as though a wild animal—an animal savage, but savage! you understand—had passed me by.”  
  
  “And yet he looked altogether of the most respectable.”  
  
  “Précisément! The body—the cage—is everything of the most respectable—but through the bars, the wild animal looks out.”  
  
  “You are fanciful, mon vieux,” said M. Bouc.  
  
  “It may be so. But I could not rid myself of the impression that evil had passed me by very close.”  
  
  “That respectable American gentleman?”  
  
  “That respectable American gentleman.”  
  
  “Well,” said M. Bouc cheerfully. “It may be so. There is much evil in the world.”  
  
  At that moment the door opened and the concierge came towards them. He looked concerned and apologetic.  
  
  “It is extraordinary, Monsieur,” he said to Poirot. “There is not one first-class sleeping berth to be had on the train.”  
  
  “Comment?” cried M. Bouc. “At this time of year? Ah, without doubt there is some party of journalists—of politicians—?”  
  
  “I don’t know, sir,” said the concierge, turning to him respectfully. “But that’s how it is.”  
  
  “Well, well,” M. Bouc turned to Poirot. “Have no fear, my friend. We will arrange something. There is always one compartment—the No. 16, which is not engaged. The conductor sees to that!” He smiled, then glanced up at the clock. “Come,” he said, “it is time we started.”  
  
  At the station M. Bouc was greeted with respectful empressement by the brown-uniformed Wagon Lit conductor.  
  
  “Good evening, Monsieur. Your compartment is the No. 1.”  
  
  He called to the porters and they wheeled their load half-way along the carriage on which the tin plates proclaimed its destination:  
  
  ISTANBUL TRIESTE CALAIS  
  
  “You are full up tonight, I hear?”  
  
  “It is incredible, Monsieur. All the world elects to travel tonight!”  
  
  “All the same, you must find room for this gentleman here. He is a friend of mine. He can have the No. 16.”  
  
  “It is taken, Monsieur.”  
  
  “What? The No. 16?”  
  
  A glance of understanding passed between them, and the conductor smiled. He was a tall, sallow man of middle age.  
  
  “But yes, Monsieur. As I told you, we are full—full—everywhere.”  
  
  “But what passes itself?” demanded M. Bouc angrily. “There is a conference somewhere? It is a party?”  
  
  “No, Monsieur. It is only chance. It just happens that many people have elected to travel tonight.”  
  
  M. Bouc made a clicking sound of annoyance.  
  
  “At Belgrade,” he said, “there will be the slip coach from Athens. There will also be the Bucharest-Paris coach—but we do not reach Belgrade until tomorrow evening. The problem is for tonight. There is no second-class berth free?”  
  
  “There is a second-class berth, Monsieur—”  
  
  “Well, then—”  
  
  “But it is a lady’s berth. There is already a German woman in the compartment—a lady’s maid.”  
  
  “Là, là, that is awkward,” said M. Bouc.  
  
  “Do not distress yourself, my friend,” said Poirot. “I must travel in an ordinary carriage.”  
  
  “Not at  
all. Not at all.” He turned once more to the conductor. “Everyone has arrived?”  
  
  “It is true,” said the man, “that there is one passenger who has not yet arrived.”  
  
  He spoke slowly with hesitation.  
  
  “But speak then?”  
  
  “No. 7 berth—a second-class. The gentleman has not yet come, and it is four minutes to nine.”  
  
  “Who is it?”  
  
  “An Englishman,” the conductor consulted his list. “A M. Harris.”  
  
  “A name of good omen,” said Poirot. “I read my Dickens. M. Harris, he will not arrive.”  
  
  “Put Monsieur’s luggage in No. 7,” said M. Bouc. “If this M. Harris arrives we will tell him that he is too late—that berths cannot be retained so long—we will arrange the matter one way or another. What do I care for a M. Harris?”  
  
  “As Monsieur pleases,” said the conductor.  
  
  He spoke to Poirot’s porter, directing him where to go.  
  
  Then he stood aside the steps to let Poirot enter the train. “Tout à fait au bout, Monsieur,” he called. “The end compartment but one.”  
  
  Poirot passed along the corridor, a somewhat slow progress, as most of the people travelling were standing outside their carriages.  
  
  His polite “Pardons” were uttered with the regularity of clockwork. At last he reached the compartment indicated. Inside it, reaching up to a suitcase, was the tall young American of the Tokatlian.  
  
  He frowned as Poirot entered.  
  
  “Excuse me,” he said. “I think you’ve made a mistake.” Then, laboriously in French, “Je crois que vous avez un erreur.”  
  
  Poirot replied in English.  
  
  “You are Mr. Harris?”  
  
  “No, my name is MacQueen. I—”  
  
  But at that moment the voice of the Wagon Lit conductor spoke from over Poirot’s shoulder. An apologetic, rather breathless voice.  
  
  “There is no other berth on the train, Monsieur. The gentleman has to come in here.”  
  
  He was hauling up the corridor window as he spoke and began to lift in Poirot’s luggage.  
  
  Poirot noticed the apology in his tone with some amusement. Doubtless the man had been promised a good tip if he could keep the compartment for the sole use of the other traveller. However, even the most munificent of tips lose their effect when a director of the company is on board and issues his orders.  
  
  The conductor emerged from the compartment, having swung the suitcases up on to the racks.  
  
  “Voilà Monsieur,” he said. “All is arranged. Yours is the upper berth, the number 7. We start in one minute.”  
  
  He hurried off down the corridor. Poirot reentered the compartment.  
  
  “A phenomenon I have seldom seen,” he said cheerfully. “A Wagon Lit conductor himself puts up the luggage! It is unheard of!”  
  
  His fellow traveller smiled. He had evidently got over his annoyance—had probably decided that it was no good to take the matter other than philosophically.  
  
  “The train’s remarkably full,” he said.  
  
  A whistle blew, there was a long, melancholy cry from the engine. Both men stepped out into the corridor.  
  
  Outside a voice shouted.  
  
  “En voiture.”  
  
  “We’re off,” said MacQueen.  
  
  But they were not quite off. The whistle blew again.  
  
  “I say, sir,” said the young man suddenly, “if you’d rather have the lower berth—easier, and all that—well, that’s all right by me.”  
  
  “No, no,” protested Poirot. “I would not deprive you—”  
  
  “That’s all right—”  
  
  “You are too amiable—”  
  
  Polite protests on both sides.  
  
  “It is for one night only,” explained Poirot. “At Belgrade—”  
  
  “Oh, I see. You’re getting out at Belgrade—”  
  
  “Not exactly. You see—”  
  
  There was a sudden jerk. Both men swung round to the window, looking out at the long, lighted platform as it slid slowly past them.  
  
  The Orient Express had started on its three-days’ journey across Europe.  
  
  Three  
  
  POIROT REFUSES A CASE  
  
  M. Hercule Poirot was a little late in entering the luncheon-car on the following day. He had risen early, breakfasted almost alone, and had spent the morning going over the notes of the case that was recalling him to London. He had seen little of his travelling companion.  
  
  M. Bouc, who was already seated, gesticulated a greeting and summoned his friend to the empty place opposite him. Poirot sat down and soon found himself in the favoured position of the table which was served first and with the choicest morsels. The food, too, was unusually good.  
  
  It was not till they were eating a delicate cream cheese that M. Bouc allowed his attention to wander to matters other than nourishment. He was at the stage of a meal when one becomes philosophic.  
  
  “Ah!” he sighed. “If I had but the pen of a Balzac! I would depict this scene.”  
  
  He waved his hand.  
  
  “It is an idea, that,” said Poirot.  
  
  “Ah, you agree? It has not been done, I think? And yet—it lends itself to romance, my friend. All around us are people, of all classes, of all nationalities, of all ages. For three days these people, these strangers to one another, are brought together. They sleep and eat under one roof, they cannot get away from each other. At the end of three days they part, they go their several ways, never, perhaps, to see each other again.”  
  
  “And yet,” said Poirot, “suppose an accident—”  
  
  “Ah no, my friend—”  
  
  “From your point of view it would be regrettable, I agree. But nevertheless let us just for one moment suppose it. Then, perhaps, all these here are linked together—by death.”  
  
  “Some more wine,” said M. Bouc, hastily pouring it out. “You are morbid, mon cher. It is, perhaps, the digestion.”  
  
  “It is true,” agreed Poirot, “that the food in Syria was not, perhaps, quite suited to my stomach.”  
  
  He sipped his wine. Then, leaning back, he ran his eye thoughtfully round the dining car. There were thirteen people seated there and, as M. Bouc had said, of all classes and nationalities. He began to study them.  
  
  At the table opposite them were three men. They were, he guessed, single travellers graded and placed there by the unerring judgment of the restaurant attendants. A big, swarthy Italian was picking his teeth with gusto. Opposite him a spare, neat Englishman had the expressionless disapproving face of the well-trained servant. Next to the Englishman was a big American in a loud suit—possibly a commercial traveller.  
  
  “You’ve got to put it over big,” he was saying in a loud nasal voice.  
  
  The Italian removed his toothpick to gesticulate with it freely.  
  
  “Sure,” he said. “That whatta I say alla de time.”  
  
  The Englishman looked out of the window and coughed.  
  
  Poirot’s eye passed on.  
  
  At a small table, sitting very upright, was one of the ugliest old ladies he had ever seen. It was an ugliness of distinction—it fascinated rather than repelled. She sat very upright. Round her neck was a collar of very large pearls which, improbable though it seemed, were real. Her hands were covered with rings. Her sable coat was pushed back on her shoulders. A very small expensive black toque was hideously unbecoming to the yellow, toad-like face beneath it.  
  
  She was speaking now to the restaurant attendant in a clear, courteous but completely autocratic tone.  
  
  “You will be sufficiently amiable to place in my compartment a bottle of mineral water and a large glass of orange juice. You will arrange that I shall have chicken cooked without sauces for dinner this evening—also some boiled fish.”  
  
  The attendant replied respectfully that it should be done.  
  
  She gave a slight gracious nod of the head and rose. Her glance caught Poirot’s and swept over him with the nonchalance of the uninterested aristocrat.  
  
  “That is Princess Dragomiroff,” said M. Bouc in a low tone. “She is a Russian. Her husband realized all this money before the R  
evolution and invested it abroad. She is extremely rich. A cosmopolitan.”  
  
  Poirot nodded. He had heard of Princess Dragomiroff.  
  
  “She is a personality,” said M. Bouc. “Ugly as sin, but she makes herself felt. You agree?”  
  
  Poirot agreed.  
  
  At another of the large tables Mary Debenham was sitting with two other women. One of them was a tall middle-aged woman in a plaid blouse and tweed skirt. She had a mass of faded yellow hair unbecomingly arranged in a large bun, wore glasses, and had a long, mild, amiable face rather like a sheep. She was listening to the third woman, a stout, pleasant-faced, elderly woman who was talking in a slow clear monotone which showed no signs of pausing for breath or coming to a stop.  
  
  “…And so my daughter said, ‘Why,’ she said ‘you just can’t apply Amurrican methods in this country. It’s just natural to the folks here to be indolent,’ she said. ‘They just haven’t got any hustle in them.’ But all the same you’d be surprised to know what our college there is doing. They’ve gotten a fine staff of teachers. I guess there’s nothing like education. We’ve got to apply our Western ideals and teach the East to recognize them. My daughter says—”  
  
  The train plunged into a tunnel. The calm monotonous voice was drowned.  
  
  At the next table, a small one, sat Colonel Arbuthnot—alone. His gaze was fixed upon the back of Mary Debenham’s head. They were not sitting together. Yet it could easily have been managed. Why?  
  
  Perhaps, Poirot thought, Mary Debenham had demurred. A governess learns to be careful. Appearances are important. A girl with her living to get has to be discreet.  
  
  His glance shifted to the other side of the carriage. At the far end, against the wall, was a middle-aged woman dressed in black with a broad expressionless face. German or Scandinavian, he thought. Probably a German lady’s maid.  
  
  After her came a couple leaning forward and talking animatedly together. The man wore English clothes of loose tweed—but he was not English. Though only the back of his head was visible to Poirot, the shape of it and the set of the shoulders betrayed him. A big man, well made. He turned his head suddenly and Poirot saw his profile. A very handsome man of thirty odd with a big fair moustache.  
  
  The woman opposite him was a mere girl—twenty at a guess. A tight-fitting little black coat and skirt, white satin blouse, small chic black toque perched at the fashionable outrageous angle. She had a beautiful foreign-looking face, dead white skin, large brown eyes, jet-black hair. She was smoking a cigarette in a long holder. Her manicured hands had deep red nails. She wore one large emerald set in platinum. There was coquetry in her glance and voice.

  IN the year 1878 I took my degree of Doctor of Medicine of theUniversity of London, and proceeded to Netley to go through the courseprescribed for surgeons in the army. Having completed my studies there,I was duly attached to the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers as AssistantSurgeon. The regiment was stationed in India at the time, and beforeI could join it, the second Afghan war had broken out. On landing atBombay, I learned that my corps had advanced through the passes, andwas already deep in the enemy's country. I followed, however, with manyother officers who were in the same situation as myself, and succeededin reaching Candahar in safety, where I found my regiment, and at onceentered upon my new duties.  
  
  The campaign brought honours and promotion to many, but for me it hadnothing but misfortune and disaster. I was removed from my brigade andattached to the Berkshires, with whom I served at the fatal battle ofMaiwand. There I was struck on the shoulder by a Jezail bullet, whichshattered the bone and grazed the subclavian artery. I should havefallen into the hands of the murderous Ghazis had it not been for thedevotion and courage shown by Murray, my orderly, who threw me across apack-horse, and succeeded in bringing me safely to the British lines.  
  
  Worn with pain, and weak from the prolonged hardships which I hadundergone, I was removed, with a great train of wounded sufferers, tothe base hospital at Peshawar. Here I rallied, and had already improvedso far as to be able to walk about the wards, and even to bask a littleupon the verandah, when I was struck down by enteric fever, that curseof our Indian possessions. For months my life was despaired of, andwhen at last I came to myself and became convalescent, I was so weak andemaciated that a medical board determined that not a day should be lostin sending me back to England. I was dispatched, accordingly, in thetroopship ""Orontes,"" and landed a month later on Portsmouth jetty, withmy health irretrievably ruined, but with permission from a paternalgovernment to spend the next nine months in attempting to improve it.  
  
  I had neither kith nor kin in England, and was therefore as free asair--or as free as an income of eleven shillings and sixpence a day willpermit a man to be. Under such circumstances, I naturally gravitated toLondon, that great cesspool into which all the loungers and idlers ofthe Empire are irresistibly drained. There I stayed for some time ata private hotel in the Strand, leading a comfortless, meaninglessexistence, and spending such money as I had, considerably more freelythan I ought. So alarming did the state of my finances become, thatI soon realized that I must either leave the metropolis and rusticatesomewhere in the country, or that I must make a complete alteration inmy style of living. Choosing the latter alternative, I began by makingup my mind to leave the hotel, and to take up my quarters in some lesspretentious and less expensive domicile.  
  
  On the very day that I had come to this conclusion, I was standing atthe Criterion Bar, when some one tapped me on the shoulder, and turninground I recognized young Stamford, who had been a dresser under me atBarts. The sight of a friendly face in the great wilderness of London isa pleasant thing indeed to a lonely man. In old days Stamford had neverbeen a particular crony of mine, but now I hailed him with enthusiasm,and he, in his turn, appeared to be delighted to see me. In theexuberance of my joy, I asked him to lunch with me at the Holborn, andwe started off together in a hansom.  
  
  ""Whatever have you been doing with yourself, Watson?"" he asked inundisguised wonder, as we rattled through the crowded London streets.""You are as thin as a lath and as brown as a nut.""  
  
  I gave him a short sketch of my adventures, and had hardly concluded itby the time that we reached our destination.  
  
  ""Poor devil!"" he said, commiseratingly, after he had listened to mymisfortunes. ""What are you up to now?""  
  
  ""Looking for lodgings."" \[3\] I answered. ""Trying to solve the problemas to whether it is possible to get comfortable rooms at a reasonableprice.""  
  
  ""That's a strange thing,"" remarked my companion; ""you are the second manto-day that has used that expression to me.""  
  
  ""And who was the first?"" I asked.  
  
  ""A fellow who is working at the chemical laboratory up at the hospital.He was bemoaning himself this morning because he could not get someoneto go halves with him in some nice rooms which he had found, and whichwere too much for his purse.""  
  
  ""By Jove!"" I cried, ""if he really wants someone to share the rooms andthe expense, I am the very man for him. I should prefer having a partnerto being alone.""  
  
  Young Stamford looked rather strangely at me over his wine-glass. ""Youdon't know Sherlock Holmes yet,"" he said; ""perhaps you would not carefor him as a constant companion.""  
  
  ""Why, what is there against him?""  
  
  ""Oh, I didn't say there was anything against him. He is a little queerin his ideas--an enthusiast in some branches of science. As far as Iknow he is a decent fellow enough.""  
  
  ""A medical student, I suppose?"" said I.  
  
  ""No--I have no idea what he intends to go in for. I believe he is wellup in anatomy, and he is a first-class chemist; but, as far as I know,he has never taken out any systematic medical classes. His studies arevery desultory and eccentric, but he has amassed a lot of out-of-the wayknowledge which would astonish his professors.""  
  
  ""Did you never ask him what he was going in for?"" I asked.  
  
  ""No; he is not a man that it is easy to draw out, though he can becommunicative enough when the fancy seizes him.""  
  
  ""I should like to meet him,"" I said. ""If I am to lodge with anyone, Ishould prefer a man of studious and quiet habits. I am not strongenough yet to stand much noise or excitement. I had enough of both inAfghanistan to last me for the remainder of my natural existence. Howcould I meet this friend of yours?""  
  
  ""He is sure to be at the laboratory,"" returned my companion. ""He eitheravoids the place for weeks, or else he works there from morning tonight. If you like, we shall drive round together after luncheon.""  
  
  ""Certainly,"" I answered, and the conversation drifted away into otherchannels.  
  
  As we made our way to the hospital after leaving the Holborn, Stamfordgave me a few more particulars about the gentleman whom I proposed totake as a fellow-lodger.  
  
  ""You mustn't blame me if you don't get on with him,"" he said; ""I knownothing more of him than I have learned from meeting him occasionally inthe laboratory. You proposed this arrangement, so you must not hold meresponsible.""  
  
  ""If we don't get on it will be easy to part company,"" I answered. ""Itseems to me, Stamford,"" I added, looking hard at my companion, ""that youhave some reason for washing your hands of the matter. Is this fellow'stemper so formidable, or what is it? Don't be mealy-mouthed about it.""  
  
  ""It is not easy to express the inexpressible,"" he answered with a laugh.""Holmes is a little too scientific for my tastes--it approaches tocold-bloodedness. I could imagine his giving a friend a little pinch ofthe latest vegetable alkaloid, not out of malevolence, you understand,but simply out of a spirit of inquiry in order to have an accurate ideaof the effects. To do him justice, I think that he would take it himselfwith the same readiness. He appears to have a passion for definite andexact knowledge.""  
  
  ""Very right too.""  
  
  ""Yes, but it may be pushed to excess. When it comes to beating thesubjects in the dissecting-rooms with a stick, it is certainly takingrather a bizarre shape.""  
  
  ""Beating the subjects!""  
  
  ""Yes, to verify how far bruises may be produced after death. I saw himat it with my own eyes.""  
  
  ""And yet you say he is not a medical student?""  
  
  ""No. Heaven knows what the objects of his studies are. But here weare, and you must form your own impressions about him."" As he spoke, weturned down  
a narrow lane and passed through a small side-door, whichopened into a wing of the great hospital. It was familiar ground to me,and I needed no guiding as we ascended the bleak stone staircase andmade our way down the long corridor with its vista of whitewashedwall and dun-coloured doors. Near the further end a low arched passagebranched away from it and led to the chemical laboratory.  
  
  This was a lofty chamber, lined and littered with countless bottles.Broad, low tables were scattered about, which bristled with retorts,test-tubes, and little Bunsen lamps, with their blue flickering flames.There was only one student in the room, who was bending over a distanttable absorbed in his work. At the sound of our steps he glanced roundand sprang to his feet with a cry of pleasure. ""I've found it! I'vefound it,"" he shouted to my companion, running towards us with atest-tube in his hand. ""I have found a re-agent which is precipitatedby hoemoglobin, \[4\] and by nothing else."" Had he discovered a gold mine,greater delight could not have shone upon his features.  
  
  ""Dr. Watson, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,"" said Stamford, introducing us.  
  
  ""How are you?"" he said cordially, gripping my hand with a strengthfor which I should hardly have given him credit. ""You have been inAfghanistan, I perceive.""  
  
  ""How on earth did you know that?"" I asked in astonishment.  
  
  ""Never mind,"" said he, chuckling to himself. ""The question now is abouthoemoglobin. No doubt you see the significance of this discovery ofmine?""  
  
  ""It is interesting, chemically, no doubt,"" I answered, ""butpractically----""  
  
  ""Why, man, it is the most practical medico-legal discovery for years.Don't you see that it gives us an infallible test for blood stains. Comeover here now!"" He seized me by the coat-sleeve in his eagerness, anddrew me over to the table at which he had been working. ""Let us havesome fresh blood,"" he said, digging a long bodkin into his finger, anddrawing off the resulting drop of blood in a chemical pipette. ""Now, Iadd this small quantity of blood to a litre of water. You perceive thatthe resulting mixture has the appearance of pure water. The proportionof blood cannot be more than one in a million. I have no doubt, however,that we shall be able to obtain the characteristic reaction."" As hespoke, he threw into the vessel a few white crystals, and then addedsome drops of a transparent fluid. In an instant the contents assumed adull mahogany colour, and a brownish dust was precipitated to the bottomof the glass jar.  
  
  ""Ha! ha!"" he cried, clapping his hands, and looking as delighted as achild with a new toy. ""What do you think of that?""  
  
  ""It seems to be a very delicate test,"" I remarked.  
  
  ""Beautiful! beautiful! The old Guiacum test was very clumsy anduncertain. So is the microscopic examination for blood corpuscles. Thelatter is valueless if the stains are a few hours old. Now, this appearsto act as well whether the blood is old or new. Had this test beeninvented, there are hundreds of men now walking the earth who would longago have paid the penalty of their crimes.""  
  
  ""Indeed!"" I murmured.  
  
  ""Criminal cases are continually hinging upon that one point. A man issuspected of a crime months perhaps after it has been committed. Hislinen or clothes are examined, and brownish stains discovered upon them.Are they blood stains, or mud stains, or rust stains, or fruit stains,or what are they? That is a question which has puzzled many an expert,and why? Because there was no reliable test. Now we have the SherlockHolmes' test, and there will no longer be any difficulty.""  
  
  His eyes fairly glittered as he spoke, and he put his hand over hisheart and bowed as if to some applauding crowd conjured up by hisimagination.  
  
  ""You are to be congratulated,"" I remarked, considerably surprised at hisenthusiasm.  
  
  ""There was the case of Von Bischoff at Frankfort last year. He wouldcertainly have been hung had this test been in existence. Then there wasMason of Bradford, and the notorious Muller, and Lefevre of Montpellier,and Samson of New Orleans. I could name a score of cases in which itwould have been decisive.""  
  
  ""You seem to be a walking calendar of crime,"" said Stamford with alaugh. ""You might start a paper on those lines. Call it the 'Police Newsof the Past.'""  
  
  ""Very interesting reading it might be made, too,"" remarked SherlockHolmes, sticking a small piece of plaster over the prick on his finger.""I have to be careful,"" he continued, turning to me with a smile, ""for Idabble with poisons a good deal."" He held out his hand as he spoke, andI noticed that it was all mottled over with similar pieces of plaster,and discoloured with strong acids.  
  
  ""We came here on business,"" said Stamford, sitting down on a highthree-legged stool, and pushing another one in my direction withhis foot. ""My friend here wants to take diggings, and as you werecomplaining that you could get no one to go halves with you, I thoughtthat I had better bring you together.""  
  
  Sherlock Holmes seemed delighted at the idea of sharing his rooms withme. ""I have my eye on a suite in Baker Street,"" he said, ""which wouldsuit us down to the ground. You don't mind the smell of strong tobacco,I hope?""  
  
  ""I always smoke 'ship's' myself,"" I answered.  
  
  ""That's good enough. I generally have chemicals about, and occasionallydo experiments. Would that annoy you?""  
  
  ""By no means.""  
  
  ""Let me see--what are my other shortcomings. I get in the dumps attimes, and don't open my mouth for days on end. You must not think I amsulky when I do that. Just let me alone, and I'll soon be right. Whathave you to confess now? It's just as well for two fellows to know theworst of one another before they begin to live together.""  
  
  I laughed at this cross-examination. ""I keep a bull pup,"" I said, ""andI object to rows because my nerves are shaken, and I get up at all sortsof ungodly hours, and I am extremely lazy. I have another set of viceswhen I'm well, but those are the principal ones at present.""  
  
  ""Do you include violin-playing in your category of rows?"" he asked,anxiously.  
  
  ""It depends on the player,"" I answered. ""A well-played violin is a treatfor the gods--a badly-played one----""  
  
  ""Oh, that's all right,"" he cried, with a merry laugh. ""I think we mayconsider the thing as settled--that is, if the rooms are agreeable toyou.""  
  
  ""When shall we see them?""  
  
  ""Call for me here at noon to-morrow, and we'll go together and settleeverything,"" he answered.  
  
  ""All right--noon exactly,"" said I, shaking his hand.  
  
  We left him working among his chemicals, and we walked together towardsmy hotel.  
  
  ""By the way,"" I asked suddenly, stopping and turning upon Stamford, ""howthe deuce did he know that I had come from Afghanistan?""  
  
  My companion smiled an enigmatical smile. ""That's just his littlepeculiarity,"" he said. ""A good many people have wanted to know how hefinds things out.""  
  
  ""Oh! a mystery is it?"" I cried, rubbing my hands. ""This is very piquant.I am much obliged to you for bringing us together. 'The proper study ofmankind is man,' you know.""  
  
  ""You must study him, then,"" Stamford said, as he bade me good-bye.""You'll find him a knotty problem, though. I'll wager he learns moreabout you than you about him. Good-bye.""  
  
  ""Good-bye,"" I answered, and strolled on to my hotel, considerablyinterested in my new acquaintance.  
CHAPTER II. THE SCIENCE OF DEDUCTION.  
  
  WE met next day as he had arranged, and inspected the rooms at No. 221B,\[5\] Baker Street, of which he had spoken at our meeting. Theyconsisted of a couple of comfortable bed-rooms and a single largeairy sitting-room, cheerfully furnished, and illuminated by two broadwindows. So desirable in every way were the apartments, and so moderatedid the terms seem when divided between us, that the bargain wasconcluded upon the spot, and we at once entered into possession.That very evening I moved my things round from the hotel, and on thefollowing morning Sherlock Holmes followed me with several boxes andportmanteaus. For a day or two we were busily employed in unpacking andlaying out our property to the best advantage. That done, wegradually began to settle down and to accommodate ourselves to our newsurroundings.  
  
  Holmes was certainly not a difficult man to live with. He was quietin his ways, and his habits were regular. It was rare for him to beup after ten at night, and he had invariably breakfasted and gone outbefore I rose in the morning. Sometimes he spent his day at the chemicallaboratory, sometimes in the dissecting-rooms, and occasionally in longwalks, which appeared to take him into the lowest portions of the City.Nothing could exceed his energy when the working fit was upon him; butnow and again a reaction would seize him, and for days on end he wouldlie upon the sofa in the sitting-room, hardly uttering a word or movinga muscle from morning to night. On these occasions I have noticed sucha dreamy, vacant expression in his eyes, that I might have suspected himof being addicted to the use of some narcotic, had not the temperanceand cleanliness of his whole life forbidden such a notion.  
  
  As the weeks went by, my interest in him and my curiosity as to hisaims in life, gradually deepened and increased. His very person andappearance were such as to strike the attention of the most casualobserver. In height he was rather over six feet, and so excessivelylean that he seemed to be considerably taller. His eyes were sharp andpiercing, save during those intervals of torpor to which I have alluded;and his thin, hawk-like nose gave his whole expression an air ofalertness and decision. His chin, too, had the prominence and squarenesswhich mark the man of determination. His hands were invariablyblotted with ink and stained with chemicals, yet he was possessed ofextraordinary delicacy of touch, as I frequently had occasion to observewhen I watched him manipulating his fragile philosophical instruments.  
  
  The reader may set me down as a hopeless busybody, when I confess howmuch this man stimulated my curiosity, and how often I endeavouredto break through the reticence which he showed on all that concernedhimself. Before pronouncing judgment, however, be it remembered, howobjectless was my life, and how little there was to engage my [attention.My](http://attention.My) health forbade me from venturing out unless the weather wasexceptionally genial, and I had no friends who would call upon me andbreak the monotony of my daily existence. Under these circumstances, Ieagerly hailed the little mystery which hung around my companion, andspent much of my time in endeavouring to unravel it.  
  
  He was not studying medicine. He had himself, in reply to a question,confirmed Stamford's opinion upon that point. Neither did he appear tohave pursued any course of reading which might fit him for a degree inscience or any other recognized portal which would give him an entranceinto the learned world. Yet his zeal for certain studies was remarkable,and within eccentric limits his knowledge was so extraordinarily ampleand minute that his observations have fairly astounded me. Surely no manwould work so hard or attain such precise information unless he had somedefinite end in view. Desultory readers are seldom remarkable for theexactness of their learning. No man burdens his mind with small mattersunless he has some very good reason for doing so.  
  
  His ignorance was as remarkable as his knowledge. Of contemporaryliterature, philosophy and politics he appeared to know next to nothing.Upon my quoting Thomas Carlyle, he inquired in the naivest way who hemight be and what he had done. My surprise reached a climax, however,when I found incidentally that he was ignorant of the Copernican Theoryand of the composition of the Solar System. That any civilized humanbeing in this nineteenth century should not be aware that the earthtravelled round the sun appeared to be to me such an extraordinary factthat I could hardly realize it.  
  
  ""You appear to be astonished,"" he said, smiling at my expression ofsurprise. ""Now that I do know it I shall do my best to forget it.""  
  
  ""To forget it!""  
  
  ""You see,"" he explained, ""I consider that a man's brain originally islike a little empty attic, and you have to stock it with such furnitureas you choose. A fool takes in all the lumber of every sort that hecomes across, so that the knowledge which might be useful to him getscrowded out, or at best is jumbled up with a lot of other things so thathe has a difficulty in laying his hands upon it. Now the skilful workmanis very careful indeed as to what he takes into his brain-attic. He willhave nothing but the tools which may help him in doing his work, but ofthese he has a large assortment, and all in the most perfect order. Itis a mistake to think that that little room has elastic walls and candistend to any extent. Depend upon it there comes a time when for everyaddition of knowledge you forget something that you knew before. It isof the highest importance, therefore, not to have useless facts elbowingout the useful ones.""  
  
  ""But the Solar System!"" I protested.  
  
  ""What the deuce is it to me?"" he interrupted impatiently; ""you saythat we go round the sun. If we went round the moon it would not make apennyworth of difference to me or to my work.""  
  
  I was on the point of asking him what that work might be, but somethingin his manner showed me that the question would be an unwelcome one. Ipondered over our short conversation, however, and endeavoured to drawmy deductions from it. He said that he would acquire no knowledge whichdid not bear upon his object. Therefore all the knowledge which hepossessed was such as would be useful to him. I enumerated in my ownmind all the various points upon which he had shown me that he wasexceptionally well-informed. I even took a pencil and jotted them down.I could not help smiling at the document when I had completed it. It ranin this way--  
  
  SHERLOCK HOLMES--his limits.  
  
  1. Knowledge of Literature.--Nil. 2. Philosophy.--Nil. 3. Astronomy.--Nil. 4. Politics.--Feeble. 5. Botany.--Variable. Well up in belladonna, opium, and poisons generally. Knows nothing of practical gardening. 6. Geology.--Practical, but limited. Tells at a glance different soils from each other. After walks has shown me splashes upon his trousers, and told me by their colour and consistence in what part of London he had received them. 7. Chemistry.--Profound. 8. Anatomy.--Accurate, but unsystematic. 9. Sensational Literature.--Immense. He appears to know every detail of every horror perpetrated in the century. 10. Plays the violin well. 11. Is an expert singlestick player, boxer, and swordsman. 12. Has a good practical knowledge of British law.  
  
  When I had got so far in my list I threw it into the fire in despair.""If I can only find what the fellow is driving at by reconciling allthese accomplishments, and discovering a calling which needs them all,""I said to myself, ""I may as well give up the attempt at once.""  
  
  I see that I have alluded above to his powers upon the violin. Thesewere very remarkable, but as eccentric as all his other accomplishments.That he could play pieces, and difficult pieces, I knew well, becauseat my request he has played me some of Mendelssohn's Lieder, and otherfavourites. When left to himself, however, he would seldom produce anymusic or attempt any recognized air. Leaning back in his arm-chair ofan evening, he would close his eyes and scrape carelessly at the fiddlewhich was thrown across his knee. Sometimes the chords were sonorous andmelancholy. Occasionally they were fantastic and cheerful. Clearly theyreflected the thoughts which possessed him, but  
whether the music aidedthose thoughts, or whether the playing was simply the result of a whimor fancy was more than I could determine. I might have rebelled againstthese exasperating solos had it not been that he usually terminated themby playing in quick succession a whole series of my favourite airs as aslight compensation for the trial upon my patience.  
  
  During the first week or so we had no callers, and I had begun to thinkthat my companion was as friendless a man as I was myself. Presently,however, I found that he had many acquaintances, and those in the mostdifferent classes of society. There was one little sallow rat-faced,dark-eyed fellow who was introduced to me as Mr. Lestrade, and who camethree or four times in a single week. One morning a young girl called,fashionably dressed, and stayed for half an hour or more. The sameafternoon brought a grey-headed, seedy visitor, looking like a Jewpedlar, who appeared to me to be much excited, and who was closelyfollowed by a slip-shod elderly woman. On another occasion an oldwhite-haired gentleman had an interview with my companion; and onanother a railway porter in his velveteen uniform. When any of thesenondescript individuals put in an appearance, Sherlock Holmes used tobeg for the use of the sitting-room, and I would retire to my bed-room.He always apologized to me for putting me to this inconvenience. ""I haveto use this room as a place of business,"" he said, ""and these peopleare my clients."" Again I had an opportunity of asking him a point blankquestion, and again my delicacy prevented me from forcing another man toconfide in me. I imagined at the time that he had some strong reason fornot alluding to it, but he soon dispelled the idea by coming round tothe subject of his own accord.  
  
  It was upon the 4th of March, as I have good reason to remember, that Irose somewhat earlier than usual, and found that Sherlock Holmes had notyet finished his breakfast. The landlady had become so accustomed to mylate habits that my place had not been laid nor my coffee prepared. Withthe unreasonable petulance of mankind I rang the bell and gave a curtintimation that I was ready. Then I picked up a magazine from the tableand attempted to while away the time with it, while my companion munchedsilently at his toast. One of the articles had a pencil mark at theheading, and I naturally began to run my eye through it.  
  
  Its somewhat ambitious title was ""The Book of Life,"" and it attempted toshow how much an observant man might learn by an accurate and systematicexamination of all that came in his way. It struck me as being aremarkable mixture of shrewdness and of absurdity. The reasoning wasclose and intense, but the deductions appeared to me to be far-fetchedand exaggerated. The writer claimed by a momentary expression, a twitchof a muscle or a glance of an eye, to fathom a man's inmost thoughts.Deceit, according to him, was an impossibility in the case of onetrained to observation and analysis. His conclusions were as infallibleas so many propositions of Euclid. So startling would his results appearto the uninitiated that until they learned the processes by which he hadarrived at them they might well consider him as a necromancer.  
  
  ""From a drop of water,"" said the writer, ""a logician could infer thepossibility of an Atlantic or a Niagara without having seen or heard ofone or the other. So all life is a great chain, the nature of which isknown whenever we are shown a single link of it. Like all other arts,the Science of Deduction and Analysis is one which can only be acquiredby long and patient study nor is life long enough to allow any mortalto attain the highest possible perfection in it. Before turning tothose moral and mental aspects of the matter which present the greatestdifficulties, let the enquirer begin by mastering more elementaryproblems. Let him, on meeting a fellow-mortal, learn at a glance todistinguish the history of the man, and the trade or profession towhich he belongs. Puerile as such an exercise may seem, it sharpens thefaculties of observation, and teaches one where to look and what to lookfor. By a man's finger nails, by his coat-sleeve, by his boot, by histrouser knees, by the callosities of his forefinger and thumb, by hisexpression, by his shirt cuffs--by each of these things a man's callingis plainly revealed. That all united should fail to enlighten thecompetent enquirer in any case is almost inconceivable.""  
  
  ""What ineffable twaddle!"" I cried, slapping the magazine down on thetable, ""I never read such rubbish in my life.""  
  
  ""What is it?"" asked Sherlock Holmes.  
  
  ""Why, this article,"" I said, pointing at it with my egg spoon as I satdown to my breakfast. ""I see that you have read it since you have markedit. I don't deny that it is smartly written. It irritates me though. Itis evidently the theory of some arm-chair lounger who evolves all theseneat little paradoxes in the seclusion of his own study. It is notpractical. I should like to see him clapped down in a third classcarriage on the Underground, and asked to give the trades of all hisfellow-travellers. I would lay a thousand to one against him.""  
  
  ""You would lose your money,"" Sherlock Holmes remarked calmly. ""As forthe article I wrote it myself.""  
  
  ""You!""  
  
  ""Yes, I have a turn both for observation and for deduction. Thetheories which I have expressed there, and which appear to you to be sochimerical are really extremely practical--so practical that I dependupon them for my bread and cheese.""  
  
  ""And how?"" I asked involuntarily.  
  
  ""Well, I have a trade of my own. I suppose I am the only one in theworld. I'm a consulting detective, if you can understand what that [is.Here](http://is.Here) in London we have lots of Government detectives and lots of privateones. When these fellows are at fault they come to me, and I manage toput them on the right scent. They lay all the evidence before me, and Iam generally able, by the help of my knowledge of the history ofcrime, to set them straight. There is a strong family resemblance aboutmisdeeds, and if you have all the details of a thousand at your fingerends, it is odd if you can't unravel the thousand and first. Lestradeis a well-known detective. He got himself into a fog recently over aforgery case, and that was what brought him here.""  
  
  ""And these other people?""  
  
  ""They are mostly sent on by private inquiry agencies. They areall people who are in trouble about something, and want a littleenlightening. I listen to their story, they listen to my comments, andthen I pocket my fee.""  
  
  ""But do you mean to say,"" I said, ""that without leaving your room youcan unravel some knot which other men can make nothing of, although theyhave seen every detail for themselves?""  
  
  ""Quite so. I have a kind of intuition that way. Now and again a caseturns up which is a little more complex. Then I have to bustle about andsee things with my own eyes. You see I have a lot of special knowledgewhich I apply to the problem, and which facilitates matters wonderfully.Those rules of deduction laid down in that article which aroused yourscorn, are invaluable to me in practical work. Observation with me issecond nature. You appeared to be surprised when I told you, on ourfirst meeting, that you had come from Afghanistan.""  
  
  ""You were told, no doubt.""  
  
  ""Nothing of the sort. I \_knew\_ you came from Afghanistan. From longhabit the train of thoughts ran so swiftly through my mind, that Iarrived at the conclusion without being conscious of intermediate steps.There were such steps, however. The train of reasoning ran, 'Here is agentleman of a medical type, but with the air of a military man. Clearlyan army doctor, then. He has just come from the tropics, for his face isdark, and that is not the natural tint of his skin, for his wrists arefair. He has undergone hardship and sickness, as his haggard face saysclearly. His left arm has been injured. He holds it in a stiff andunnatural manner. Where in the tropics could an English army doctor haveseen much hardship and got his arm wounded? Clearly in Afghanistan.' Thewhole train of thought did not occupy a second. I then remarked that youcame from Afghanistan, and you were astonished.""  
  
  ""It is simple enough as you explain it,"" I said, smiling. ""You remindme of Edgar Allen Poe's Dupin. I had no idea that such individuals didexist outside of stories.""  
  
  Sherlock Holmes rose and lit his pipe. ""No doubt you think that you arecomplimenting me in comparing me to Dupin,"" he observed. ""Now, in myopinion, Dupin was a very inferior fellow. That trick of his of breakingin on his friends' thoughts with an apropos remark after a quarter ofan hour's silence is re  
ally very showy and superficial. He had someanalytical genius, no doubt; but he was by no means such a phenomenon asPoe appeared to imagine.""  
  
  ""Have you read Gaboriau's works?"" I asked. ""Does Lecoq come up to youridea of a detective?""  
  
  Sherlock Holmes sniffed sardonically. ""Lecoq was a miserable bungler,""he said, in an angry voice; ""he had only one thing to recommend him, andthat was his energy. That book made me positively ill. The question washow to identify an unknown prisoner. I could have done it in twenty-fourhours. Lecoq took six months or so. It might be made a text-book fordetectives to teach them what to avoid.""  
  
  I felt rather indignant at having two characters whom I had admiredtreated in this cavalier style. I walked over to the window, and stoodlooking out into the busy street. ""This fellow may be very clever,"" Isaid to myself, ""but he is certainly very conceited.""  
  
  ""There are no crimes and no criminals in these days,"" he said,querulously. ""What is the use of having brains in our profession. I knowwell that I have it in me to make my name famous. No man lives or hasever lived who has brought the same amount of study and of naturaltalent to the detection of crime which I have done. And what is theresult? There is no crime to detect, or, at most, some bungling villainywith a motive so transparent that even a Scotland Yard official can seethrough it.""  
  
  I was still annoyed at his bumptious style of conversation. I thought itbest to change the topic.  
  
  ""I wonder what that fellow is looking for?"" I asked, pointing to astalwart, plainly-dressed individual who was walking slowly down theother side of the street, looking anxiously at the numbers. He hada large blue envelope in his hand, and was evidently the bearer of amessage.  
  
  ""You mean the retired sergeant of Marines,"" said Sherlock Holmes.  
  
  ""Brag and bounce!"" thought I to myself. ""He knows that I cannot verifyhis guess.""  
  
  The thought had hardly passed through my mind when the man whom we werewatching caught sight of the number on our door, and ran rapidly acrossthe roadway. We heard a loud knock, a deep voice below, and heavy stepsascending the stair.  
  
  ""For Mr. Sherlock Holmes,"" he said, stepping into the room and handingmy friend the letter.  
  
  Here was an opportunity of taking the conceit out of him. He littlethought of this when he made that random shot. ""May I ask, my lad,"" Isaid, in the blandest voice, ""what your trade may be?""  
  
  ""Commissionaire, sir,"" he said, gruffly. ""Uniform away for repairs.""  
  
  ""And you were?"" I asked, with a slightly malicious glance at mycompanion.  
  
  ""A sergeant, sir, Royal Marine Light Infantry, sir. No answer? Right,sir.""  
  
  He clicked his heels together, raised his hand in a salute, and wasgone.

And let me point out that this café almost only have people studying here.

One day when I was sitting with my computer drinking a coffee I heard som screaming like sound and out of that door a whole entire family was inside and their children of 2 were so annoying. One of them had tree blocks in different shapes, that kid was maybe around 5. And the older one that was about 9 or 10. And I can tell that the people in there were like; 
”oh boy here it goes”.

Out of nowhere I felt something hitting my chair, who was it? Ofc the children. The older one started to throw the wooden blocks the younger one was playing everywhere hitting other people’s chairs. What did the parents do? Literally nothing. 

And then we all heard a ear ripping scream, and it was the younger one. Apparently the older one hit the younger one with one of the blocks. And I cannot tell you how annoyed I got with their parents. They were looking around smiling and then said to the old one something like;

”Oh ___, that wasn’t that kind of you” 

They were saying like if they were talking to the younger one, remind you the older one was about 10 years old, they barely did anything to calm the younger one down and just let that child continue screaming and crying from being in pain. I was at the edge of smashing my computer together and leave. But the younger one did stop crying, so I decided to stay. Btw, the blocks were still spread out everywhere in the café, under people’s tables etc. By that point many have left cuz they couldn’t stand it. 

And then I heard screaming again. Was it the younger one? No, it was the older one lashing out screaming, you wonder why? The parents told him to pick up the blocks he threw after the waitress working there told them that they were disturbing other costumers and that they have to ”clean” up (the blocks) and lower their volume. And because of that, the kid was screaming cuz of the mess he did. And what did the parents do then? 

Apparently the younger kids injury didn’t bother them and cared, but when a 10 year old lashes out cuz he didn’t wanna clean up the mess he did from the younger ones blocks by throwing them. They all panicked and the dad ran to every blocks he could find and the mother held him in her arms and said;
”It’s ok ___ it’s not your fault”

Like are they serious!? Am I stupid or something, like why tf didn’t they do anything when their younger child got a wooden block thrown full blast on its face? And they didn’t find it a big deal, but the older one having a tantrum cuz he had to clean up the whole mess he did? 

I decided that it was enough so I left cuz I just couldn’t stand it anymore ",7,1752389323.0,childfree,1,0.9,False

Coucou tout le monde!

I'm a huge fan of Mont Blanc, the creamy cold brew with salted orange foam that’s popular in Melbourne, Australia. It’s one of the most creative drinks I’ve ever had. And I’m on the hunt for more! Now I’m super curious: what other unique, specialty or signature drinks are out there that more people should know about?

It doesn’t have to be coffee-based — I’m open to anything: matcha, chocolate, chai, tea, sparkling, fermented... even the weird stuff!

What’s the most memorable or inventive drink you’ve had (or made)?  
Would love to hear your favorites — thanks in advance!

But not at me.

**At the glass.**

He sees the reflection.

Not of *himself*—  
But of *something behind me.*

I whip around.

Empty.

But the **mirror window** behind me is still lit.

It shows me what I didn’t turn fast enough to see.

**A shape.**

Pressed up behind me just before I turned.

Spindly.  
Crooked.  
A reflection that doesn’t belong to any room I’ve ever lived in.

I stagger back. Hit the wall.

The hospital room tilts. Warps. **Repeats.**

The door opens.

Not a nurse.

Not a doctor.

**A man.**

**The man.** From before.

The stranger who woke me on my couch. His skin now has the **glassy reflectivity of a screen paused too long.**

He speaks without moving his mouth.

>

He walks toward me. His feet don’t touch the floor.

>

I shake my head. My tongue is **foreign** in my own mouth.  
My voice comes out **mirrored**, reversed audio:

>

He nods.

>

He hands me something. Cold. Heavy.

**A VHS tape.**

On the spine, handwritten in shaky block letters:

**“DON’T WATCH.”**

But the O is scratched out.

Replaced with a zero.

**DØN’T WATCH**

I stare at it.

>

>

Before I can answer, he’s gone.

Not faded.

**Cut.**

Like a film splice—  
One frame he’s there.  
The next, it’s just static in the shape of a man.

# I. Go. Home.

But not *home*. Not anymore.

3B looks normal again.  
Too normal.  
As if it’s trying ***very hard*** to remember what “normal” should look like.

The couch is upright.  
The coffee table is unbroken.  
The owl mug is gone.

But the air?

The air tastes like **erased voices.**

I slide the tape into the old VCR.  
It accepts it like a tongue swallowing a pill.

I hit play.

The screen flickers.

Static.

Then—

A baby’s crib.

The timestamp: **12/00/00**.

No time.

Just zero.

A mobile spins slowly above the crib.  
The plush animals are… wrong.

One is a **melted VHS tape**.  
Another is a **mirror shard**.  
The third is a **tooth.**  
And the fourth is me.  
My face. Plastic. Rotating, smiling, glassy-eyed.

I start to blink.

I remember the warning.

I force my eyes to stay wide. **Burning. Dry.**

The camera zooms in on the crib.

There’s no baby.

Only a pile of keys.

All labeled:  
**“HOME.”**

And under them… movement.

**Something unfolds itself.**

Too long. Too black. Too *old*.

It climbs up the inside of the camera feed—  
like it can *see me watching.*

And then the ***TV goes black.***

But not off.

**Black.**

Like something is blocking the light from *inside* the screen.

A **face** presses against it.

No features.

Just an **absence** shaped like a man’s head.  
No eyes.  
No mouth.

But I hear it.

**In my thoughts.**

Not words.

**Commands.**

>

>

>

And finally:

>

I turn.

The apartment is **gone**.

I am standing inside the tape.

Not figuratively.

Literally.

The air smells like **burnt tape plastic** and **blood memory**.

A voice plays on loop overhead.

Mine.

Crying.

From when I was a child.

Begging someone **not to open the door.**

The door opens.

Behind it—  
**The same man.**

Not the stranger.

**Me.**

But from a different year.

Older. Greyer. Dead-eyed.

I whisper to it.

“Who am I?”

It answers:

The lights go out.

Veins of phosphorescent decay crawl from corner to corner.  
The drywall pulses with the rhythm of a second heartbeat.

In the dark, something *moves*.

No footsteps — but a dragging.  
Like muscle sliding across damp glass.

From the hallway:  
A shape.

Wrong.

Worse than before.

**It has my hands.**

Too many of them.

Each one is holding an object from a past life:  
– My old house key  
– My daughter’s toy  
– A burned VHS tape  
– A clump of *my own hair*

It doesn’t walk.  
It **replays**.

I don’t know how else to describe it — it *glitches forward*, frame by frame, like a corrupted film stuck in fast-forward.  
Its face is a stitched mosaic of ***me.***  
Every version.

Smiling. Screaming. Melting. Silent.

It opens its chest.

Inside is a staircase.

Not metaphorically.

For example the ones I like are:

Caramel Column – Deep stories, well-polished games that are short and have simple mechanics.

Rusty Lake – All their games are point-and-click/escape rooms with stories that have a really unique flavor.

Bart Bonte – Colorful puzzle games. I don't really know how to describe them better!

HyperBeard – Cozy games with a cute aesthetic, great for relaxing.

Rayark – They used to focus entirely on rhythm/music games. Now they make other things too, but their biggest hits are still music games. I'm still sad they silently killed my Mandora 2.

Odencat – A Japanese developer making lots of story-driven games. I started playing them to practice my Japanese and they're good—kind of weird too.

TapBlaze – They made Good Pizza, Great Pizza (and the new coffee one). I think it's the best game I’ve played in that genre. The pizza one.

XZFgTdw Nuclear Games – I played their Warplanes game. I liked how hard it was to control—I died at least 50 times in the tutorial. I think the submarine one is similar, but I haven’t played that yet.

Honorable mentions:

GAGEX – I know all their games are pretty much the same copy-paste formula, but I like the mini stories. Also perfect for practicing my Japanese but just that

Supercell – All grindy multiplayer games with tons of microtransactions, but still very F2P-friendly and fun for a long time. (Sorry this is my guilty pleasure)

Kairosoft – Haven't actually played their games, but they’re famous and people say they're much deeper than they look. I'm not sure.",5,1752388305.0,AndroidGaming,10,1.0,False

I hadn’t seen you in almost a year. Messaged, yes. But not seen. 

Of course, there’s only so much that you can decipher over FaceTime. But still

Was I detecting a hint of guarded energy…and unease? Why wouldn’t you be? And I could hear you fumbling over your words a little. Your pride was fighting with your vulnerability.   

I was truly to be politely enthusiastic, and not too eager. 

But truthfully wanted to know all the chapters of your life I haven’t read yet. 

I know…how we got here. My question is more “why were we here in the first place?” 

——

I dunno where the crush came from, but it didn’t go quietly. It was unapologetic and relentless.

The crush wasn’t mutual. 

Obviously. 

You belong to her. And she belongs to you. And I couldn’t help falling for you. Even though I told myself it was wrong and it was stupid and cruel to my heart, it happened anyway. 

(And I’m so sorry, by the way. My heart is embarrassingly loud sometimes.)

In the end, without making a fuss, you gave my heart back to me. 

And after that, I thought…I thought you would leave me alone to play arts and crafts with the shattered pieces.

That’s what I would do. 

But you didn’t. Despite me making a fool of myself over and over and over again. 

You didn’t let go. 

You kept reaching out. You kept wanting to know that I was still on the other end your messages. 

——
See, I’m not mad about any of that. What I am mad about is the space you decided not to take. 

why the hell did you keep messaging me? Yes we agreed to be friends. But I think you took that commitment a little too seriously. 

But you got the message and I didn’t hear from you for a while. 

Until…I messaged a group chat we were a part of and you used that as an opening to reach out. And we set up a time to catch up. 

——-
Talking with you was like drinking water at the end of a hot day. It was the first time in a long time someone had actually listened to the words I was saying. I was a little shocked actually. 

For minute I was transported back to one of our late night talk sessions. The type that start after dinner and don’t stop until the coffee shops open up the next morning. And sometimes, in these conversations, you would compare me to her and still show her love and grace in the same breath. But you do love her. Without a doubt. 

I was wondering what was going on through your head. You seemed a little unsure and tense. Did you think I was going to flirt with you again? Did you think I was gonna profess love or something? 

Then I got annoyed. The audacity. You asked me to catch up, not the other way around. What makes you think I even like you anymore? I’m busy making my dreams come true. Don’t be so self centered- my dreams don’t include you. 

Anyway. 

I ended our convo on a weird note. Sorry, I had to hang up first. We promised we would catch up sooner rather than later and said goodbye. 

Maybe next time I’ll ask you the questions I’ve been wanting to ask you this whole time: 

What do you want with me? You really think we can move past all this and begin again?

It can’t be anything related to alcohol since the majority of my friends don’t drink alcohol nor like it. And yes they’re autistic as am I. 

Anyways, so far I’ve thought of vanilla tea, cinnamon tea, chocolate chip tea and finally chocolate tea. But I’m not sure about that combination. Now the reason why I’m choosing tea is because Google said that you can substitute alcohol for tea. Additionally I have found a site that says that you can substitute bourbon with vanilla extract and water. 

Now my thinking is that if I make a tea flavor blend with the teas I previously listed, although with water, then I’m set. My problem is that I have no idea how to make that and what ratio should I use.

I leaned against the wall, carefully cradling my six-month bump as I waited for my prenatal checkup.  
  
Once the scheduled examination was done, I planned to visit my husband Aiden—maybe we could head home together.  
  
After all, the rain was coming down hard outside. The rideshare app showed nearly 200 people ahead of me in the queue, and my phone signal kept cutting out sporadically.  
  
Aiden wasn't scheduled for specialist clinic duty today, but one of his team's doctor colleagues had called in sick last minute. So he'd been forced to cover a half-day shift.  
  
The heavy smell of disinfectant in the hospital corridors mixed with the damp scent of the downpour outside, making me nauseous.  
  
The waiting area was packed. Children crying, anxious inquiries, nurses trying to maintain order—all the sounds blended together into a headache-inducing chaos.  
  
I found an empty spot on the bench outside the obstetrics office and had just settled down when I spotted Aiden's tall figure emerging from a consultation room.  
  
He wore his crisp white coat, pressed to perfection, his face still bearing the exhaustion from last night's surgery.  
  
But his gaze swept across the crowd with that familiar sharpness and... intensity. This was the Aiden I knew—calm, efficient, completely intolerant of chaos or rule-breaking.  
  
As one of the youngest deputy chief cardiologists at a top New York hospital, his professionalism and strict adherence to protocol were practically carved into his bones.  
  
I'd always considered this a strength.  
  
Just as I was about to call out to him, I saw a figure skillfully weaving through the queue, heading straight for Aiden's office.  
  
That silhouette... was that Vera?  
  
I frowned. Vera was an intern who'd joined the department just over a month ago. Young, pretty, always flashing that sweet smile.  
  
My first impression of her at the hospital had been positive—a breath of youthful energy.  
  
But here was the problem: she shouldn't be anywhere near Aiden.  
  
Or more precisely, she shouldn't be appearing in such a... privileged way.  
  
Because Aiden had a habitual ""rule""—to avoid unnecessary complications and distractions, all the interns and assistants he worked with were exclusively male.  
  
This wasn't something he'd actively demanded, but after several young female doctors had tried to ""get close"" through various methods—""accidentally"" spilling water, messing up reports, asking for ""guidance"" until late at night—Aiden had had enough.  
  
He'd requested that the training office only assign male interns to his team.  
  
Over time, it became an unspoken understanding within the department.  
  
Even the administrative assistants knew to simply leave documents on his desk—avoiding any accidental contact with Dr. Aiden.  
  
So what was Vera doing here?  
  
""Aiden!"" Vera's voice carried that deliberately soft sweetness. ""Sorry to bother you, but my stomach pain is really severe...""  
  
Aiden turned slightly. I couldn't even catch the change in his expression before I saw him raise his hand to pull open the consultation room door, gesturing for Vera to enter.  
  
Then, facing the patients and their families who'd been waiting outside for ages, he said flatly: ""Please wait. Handling an emergency.""  
  
Complaints erupted immediately.  
  
""Are you kidding me? We've been waiting all morning!""  
  
""Emergency? That girl looked perfectly healthy just now.""  
  
""Yeah, isn't Dr. Aiden supposed to be the most by-the-book guy here? Line-cutting?""  
  
Aiden's expression didn't budge an inch, as if those voices simply didn't exist.  
  
He was about to close the door when his gaze inadvertently swept across the crowd and landed on me in the corner.  
  
For a split second, I saw surprise flash in Aiden's eyes. Then it shifted into something almost imperceptible... annoyance?  
  
But he said nothing. With a sharp ""bang,"" he shut the consultation room door, blocking out everyone's stares.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
My heart plummeted. Ten minutes? Twenty minutes? The consultation room door remained firmly shut.  
  
The complaints outside grew louder, nurses tried to calm people down, but it was no use.  
  
An icy sensation spread through my limbs. Not from the air conditioning—but from knowing that behind that closed door lay territory I, as his wife, rarely set foot in, yet another young woman had effortlessly claimed.  
  
Even with Aiden himself breaking the rules.  
  
Finally, the door opened. Vera emerged holding a payment slip, her cheeks flushed, eyes bright—showing absolutely no signs of the ""severe abdominal pain"" she'd mentioned earlier.  
  
She walked toward the payment counter with light steps.  
  
As she passed by me, she even shot me a look that carried triumph, almost defiant in its smugness.  
  
Aiden followed, his expression restored to its usual calm, as if he'd never broken any rules at all.  
  
He looked at me, not giving me a chance to speak: ""Almost off duty.  
  
Finished with your checkup? I still have a few patients—after that I'll drive you home. Too much rain outside, rideshares are impossible.""  
  
I said nothing.  
  
The crushing disappointment and sense of betrayal left me heartbroken. I followed Aiden silently to his break room to wait.  
  
Every minute of waiting felt endless.  
  
The break room still carried the faint scent of jasmine perfume—Vera's fragrance from earlier.  
  
I stared at the neatly arranged files on Aiden's desk and the no-smoking sign beside them, remembering that argument from a month ago.  
  
I'd just finished throwing up from morning sickness and felt suddenly hungry.  
  
When I went to see Aiden, I brought only the mildest lemon water—I knew how sensitive he was to strong smells.  
  
But when I took a sip in his office, Aiden said coldly: ""Tina, this is a hospital, not a coffee shop. That smell will linger for hours—it could affect my clinical judgment. Please don't eat or drink anything in here again.""  
  
Just one sip of water. Aiden had used such harsh, cold phrasing as ""affecting judgment.""  
  
And now, Vera, merely an ""intern,"" had not only broken Aiden's rule about working with female interns, but had also been privileged enough to skip the crowded clinic queue and enter his consultation room because of a ""stomach ache""?  
  
Yet her lingering jasmine fragrance—wouldn't that affect his ""professional judgment""?  
  
When Aiden returned after seeing his last patient, I was standing by the window, watching the storm outside. ""Let's go."" He grabbed his car keys. ""I parked in the basement garage, no need to get soaked.""  
  
The underground garage felt somewhat damp from the storm's penetration. Aiden's black SUV sat in the spacious parking spot.  
  
When I reached the car, Aiden didn't immediately unlock it, instead looking toward the passenger side.  
  
I followed his gaze and saw the passenger door open.  
  
Vera poked her head out, her face a picture of ""surprise"" and ""apology"": ""Tina? Oh my God—I'm so sorry! Earlier, Aiden saw I couldn't get a ride and with this terrible rain, he offered to drop me home... I didn't mean to intrude. Aiden, maybe I should sit in the back?""  
  
She pretended to unbuckle her seatbelt to get out, but Aiden simply unlocked the rear doors and said to me: ""Get in.""  
  
Chapter 3  
  
Then Aiden turned back to Vera, his tone noticeably softer, carrying a hint of reassurance he probably wasn't even aware of: ""It's fine, stay put. You're soaked out there.""  
  
Vera sweetly said ""okay"" and settled back into her seat. Her face still wore that apologetic expression, but her eyes betrayed her current smugness.  
  
I supported my bump and awkwardly maneuvered into the back seat. The car started up and smoothly pulled out of the garage. We drove into the storm.  
  
The car shut out the wind and rain, but it couldn't shut out the silence inside. Aiden broke it first, his voice calm: ""Vera's apartment is pretty far. We'll drop her off first.""  
  
I said nothing, and the last shred of hope in my heart completely vanished. From the hospital to our home was normally a ten-minute drive. But Vera's apartment was in the complete opposite direction—this ""far"" was definitely not just a little out of the way.  
  
I watched their silhouettes. Vera seemed a bit cold, arms wrapped around herself. Aiden immediately reached over to turn up the heat near the passenger seat.  
  
Vera said something quietly. Aiden tilted his head slightly, actually smiling, and responded in low tones. I clenched my fists, my body trembling involuntarily. Aiden was completely ignoring me.  
  
The warm air from the heater mixed with Vera's jasmine scent, wafting back toward me in waves. Pregnancy had made my sense of smell acute—in that moment, it made me nauseous.  
  
Instinctively, I cracked the window open slightly. A blast of cold, rain-laden air immediately rushed in. ""Ah!"" Vera let out a shriek from the passenger seat, dramatically hunching her shoulders. ""So cold!""  
  
Aiden glanced at me through the rearview mirror, his eyes showing displeasure: ""It's pouring. Close the window! Getting the car wet makes it smell worse.""  
  
My heart felt like it was being crushed by a giant fist. Three days ago, just because I'd taken that sip of lemon water in his office, he hadn't spoken to me since. But now?  
  
Vera could sit in his passenger seat wearing perfume, enjoying the heat he'd turned up for her. Just because she complained about being cold, Aiden immediately blamed me for opening the window.  
  
Principles? Rules?  
  
Apparently they only applied to me.  
  
A wave of nausea surged from my stomach, the baby kicking hard—maybe sensing my emotional turmoil.  
  
I closed my eyes, took a deep breath of the cold air streaming through the window, forcing myself to stay calm. Then I expressionlessly rolled the window back up.  
  
The car returned to its enclosed warmth. But Vera's mood hadn't immediately recovered. She began complaining softly: ""This weather is awful. I should have grabbed a jacket before leaving.""  
  
""Are you hungry?"" Aiden suddenly asked, his voice surprisingly gentle. The car happened to be passing a brightly lit convenience store.  
  
Vera hesitated: ""Well... a little. I always seem to get hungrier when I'm not feeling well...""  
  
Aiden immediately put on his turn signal and smoothly pulled into the convenience store parking lot. Without looking at me, he unbuckled his seatbelt: ""Wait here.""  
  
Rain hammered against Aiden's umbrella as he got out, instantly soaking half his pant legs. He didn't seem to care, heading straight into the store.  
  
A few minutes later, he returned with dampness clinging to him and water droplets on his clothes. He handed Vera a hot cocoa and a paper bag containing a warm cinnamon roll.  
  
""Eat it while it's hot,"" his voice was low and caring. ""Warm your stomach.""  
  
Sweet, buttery, rich cinnamon scent immediately filled the small car interior. I watched Aiden's soaked sleeves and shoulders, watched the concern in his eyes as he handed Vera the food.  
  
In that instant, I gave up completely. I thought of countless late nights when Aiden came home exhausted after surgery, how I'd tiptoe around, not daring to make a sound for fear of disturbing his rest, because he'd said he hated being bothered most of all.  
  
I thought of all his prohibitions: the cleanliness of private spaces, the ban on eating in his office, the strict boundaries in personal relationships... I'd spent nine careful years maintaining all of Aiden's principles.  
  
Turns out, every rule could be broken.

1lylvyp,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsGoTravelers/comments/1lylvyp/what_to_do_in_maui_in_7_days/,what to do in maui in 7 days?,"Just got back from an incredible week in Maui and wanted to share my complete 7-day itinerary that made our trip unforgettable. I've done all the research and testing so you don't have to.

Day 1: Settling In & Beach Day
Start your trip relaxing at Ka'anapali Beach. The calm morning waters are perfect for swimming and snorkeling. I spotted sea turtles right off the beach. Spend your afternoon exploring Lahaina's Front Street for some local shopping and your first taste of Hawaiian food.

Day 2: Road to Hana
This was honestly the highlight of our trip. Instead of stressing about driving those 620 curves ourselves, we booked a guided tour that made all the difference. Our guide knew exactly where to stop and when to avoid crowds. The tour I took (https://athometouch.com/Maui) included lunch at Hana Farms and entry to Wai'anapanapa State Park. The black sand beach there was unlike anything I've seen before.

Day 3: Haleakala Sunrise
Wake up early (like 3 AM early) to drive up Haleakala for sunrise. Bundle up - it's freezing up there! The sunset above the clouds is worth every shiver. Spend the afternoon recovering at your hotel or exploring Paia Town's unique shops.

Day 4: Molokini Snorkel Trip
Book a morning snorkel tour to Molokini Crater. The water clarity here is incredible - you can see 150 feet down! Afternoon: Check out Maui Ocean Center to learn about local marine life.

Day 5: Upcountry Maui
Visit Ali'i Kula Lavender Farm and Maui Wine in Ulupalakua. The views up here are spectacular, and the climate is refreshingly cool. Stop at Grandma's Coffee House in Keokea for the best banana bread on the island.

Day 6: West Maui
Take a catamaran trip along the west Maui coast (winter for whales, summer for snorkeling). Spend sunset at Napili Bay - trust me, it's less crowded than the popular spots but just as beautiful.

Day 7: North Shore
Check out Ho'okipa Beach to watch windsurfers, visit the Twin Falls waterfall, and end your trip with dinner in Paia town.

Pro Tips:
- Book popular activities in advance, especially the Road to Hana tour
- Get the Gypsy Guide app for self-driving days
- Always pack reef-safe sunscreen
- Bring a light jacket for upcountry and Haleakala
- Download offline Google Maps - cell service can be spotty

The Road to Hana tour was definitely worth splurging on - no stress about driving, plus our guide shared incredible stories about Hawaiian culture and history that we would've missed otherwise. Book it here: https://athometouch.com/Maui

1lyltsc,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1lyltsc/m29_f29_reoccurring_fights_need_advice/,M29 & F29 Reoccurring fights. Need advice.,"We've been married for 11 years. I love this woman. I'm asking for productive advice to help mitigate the same arguments we tend to have. Any criticism of how I handled the situation is welcomed. 

We just got back from being out with out neighbors. I was falling asleep at the bar because it was 2am & I had woken up early that day for work. We got home, I'm half asleep. I tell her before going inside, I'm just gonna jump straight into bed. (The kids are spending time with their grandparents.)

We get in I start taking my clothes off, she goes into the bathroom to do her night routine (take her contacts out, use the bathroom, ect..) she then asks me to take our dog out because she took her contacts out and can't see (as she's walking around the bedroom).

I don't say anything at this point, I just call for our dog but he didn't want to come, so I walked in the bathroom where he was and he finally came. I'm still trying to keep my eyes open, just struggling at this point. I let our dog out and turn on the light outside for him. 

Then, with me tired AF, I lay down on the couch and wait for our dog to wake me up by scratching on the door. He hadn't scratched on the door yet when she yelled for me. I said ""yeah?"" Then she said ""come to bed"" I asked her if she had let our dog in, thinking she let him in while I had dozed off and that's why she was telling me to come to bed. She responded ""no?"" So I let him in. Remind you I'm still half asleep. After I let him in, I remember I havent sent the work schedule for tomorrow to one of my employees and I knew I wouldn't wake up early to do it, so I went to the office to take a picture of my notes to send it to him. As I was doing that she yelled my name again, which I replied in a normal tone ""hold on"". Then she yelled again, I then responded in a annoyed tone ""hold on"". She then says "" fine, fucking sleep over there then."" I don't respond. I just go straight to bed..

We wake up the next day, I say good morning and she is still mad because I said hold on, so I apologize for saying hold on in an annoyed tone. 

I apologized because that's the only way I have found that doesn't escalate things. If I try to defend myself or give reasons for why I responded in an annoyed tone, it will just go south. 

The fact that she is annoyed because I said hold on in an annoyed tone, but has no remorse or doesn't feel like her cussing is an issue bothers me. 

After I apologize, she felt better, I got up and started pacing the house because I'm use to waking up and jumping straight into work, but I decided to take the day off to spend the day with her. I found that our dog had shit in the kitchen, I cleaned that up with Clorox and paper towels. I picked everything up and then just used the mop to make sure there was nothing else. Dumped it in the bath tub and rinsed out the bathtub. There was no poop on the mop because I cleaned it all with the paper towels and Clorox. She asked me where I dumped it and I told her the bathtub. She responded in a concerned tone ""with poop in it?"" I said ""no. I made sure to pick up the poop first before I mopped."". She said okay. 

I asked her if she wants breakfast, she says yes. I asked her what she's in the mood for and she says ""I don't eat much we'll go wherever you want to"". I said okay, let me look around. I offered boomerjacks, she says no "" that's no what came to mind"" I said ""well, what did come to mind"". She said ""nothing came to mind, that just wasn't the first thing that came to mind."" I responded ""if that wasn't the first thing, you're insinuating that something came to mind"" then she said ""when I think of brunch I don't think of that"" which I replied ""brunch, that's all I needed to hear. Let me look for brunch spots"" I found one in a couple of minutes and we headed off. 

(Fight on our drive)

We started talking about love island. And Hudda came up. I said ""I saw something on tiktok and people are saying that the only people that are defending Hudda are the people that are just like her. She then starts to defend her and I smirk and say ""ohhhhh"". I was joking. But then she started to get upset about it. She created a similarity between the scene where the guys were playing around with the plastic baby and Hudda acted like a psycho to another tv show ""Mormon house wife's"" were they had a game to where all the girls peed on a pregnancy stick & put it in a bowl. Then they would all grab one randomly to see if it was positive. The problem with that was one of the girls (which is known to crash out) was having a hard time having children. She was comparing that to the producers knowing that Hudda was a mom and that they shouldn't have done that. I made a ""that is not the same thing"" face and said ""that doesn't compare at all"". She got mad and said""why do you always do that? Why can't you just let me talk, it's how I feel about it"". Which I said, it was a reaction to what you said, I didn't know this was a huge topic for you. She said it's not you're just rude about it. I apologized for being rude, and told her I can be silly and play with a plastic baby and still be a good dad. Involving someone in a random pregnancy test pull is far worse and would validate a crash out. She said that's a better way to say it then just making a face and a rude comment that is meant for me to feel stupid. I told her I didn't mean it like that, it was just my involuntary reaction to your comparison, and I apologized. She then continued on to say that she shouldn't be on that show if she has that sort of trauma and went on to explain how her baby daddy cheated on her & then proposed to her. I just disassociated from the conversation that way I didn't say anything that would be interpreted as rude or mean.

We then had a good lunch, no issues there. After that we went to Sephora because an influencer she liked from a previous love island dropped a fragrance she wanted to smell. She smelled some, I smelled them and gave my opinion, we smelled quite a bit. I liked the coffee beans the most lol. We then walk out and I ask if she wants a coffee, she says no and asks if I want one. I then say no and we get in the car and head home. 

We get to the house with the intention to binge watch the last 4 love island episodes (we planned this during brunch). As we park in the drive way I say "" you want to get in bed and watch it off of your laptop?"" She says yes, I say do you want some lala land to drink while we watch it? (She looks at me annoyed) Do you want to? You asked me that like 15 min ago. I said I was just asking because I know you like to drink something as you watch. She then says that we can do whatever I want and throws in how it seemed like I was annoyed at Sephora and she doesn't want do anything when I'm like that. Which I was like ""what are you talking about about? How did I seem annoyed?"" She then said that I just didn't seem like I wanted to be there. I said I don't feel like that is true. She then said ""it doesn't matter what you feel, it's how I feel"" which I said "" well I wasn't annoyed. I literally smelled everything you smelled, we hugged, we held hands, I don't know what you're talking about"" she ended up storming off and saying "" you always make me feel like I'm crazy"" which I responded "" I feel the same way ""..  it's 1am now and we didn't say a word to each other. She's asleep next to me in bed. 

Where did I go wrong and what can I do to help the situation while also bringing up the issues I have without seeming rude or mean?",1,1752387561.0,relationship_advice,7,1.0,False

1lylseh,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1lylseh/i_stopped_chasing_later/,I Stopped Chasing Later,"Mormonism, to me, is about priding yourself on the things you give up, abstain from, postpone, or deny to cash in for some great reward at a later time. When I think about the term ""Latter-day Saint,"" I no longer think about saints in these days. I think about a really tragic scenario where you have a bunch of people refusing to feel okay about life right now because they believe the next one will be better.

When I was first leaving Mormonism, I was really hesitant but excited to try things like my first cup of coffee. What does wine taste like? What's all the hype? You know what I didn't expect, though? The biggest thing I wasn't allowed to experience as a believing member had nothing to do with some forbidden substance or liquid. The biggest thing I wasn't allowed to experience was what it felt like to be content. To have actual peace. Not the ""let's dress up in robes and go whisper to each other in a Marriott hotel lobby we call a celestial room"" kind of peace. I mean actual, ""wow, this moment in my life is actually pretty okay"" kind of peace. I'm talking ""hey, I'm really kind of a good person"" kind of peace. I'm not talking about the ""wow, I met all my key indicators on my mission"" peace. Or the ""that was awkward, but at least I can report 100% home teaching"" peace. I mean the ""I don't know what happens after this life, if anything, and I'm okay with that"" kind of peace.

These aren't ""latter-day"" saints. These are ""later day"" saints. It's never about today. The happiness is always a carrot on a stick that comes later. For now, it's shame and suffering. You know what word totally disappeared from my vocabulary when I left Mormonism? ""Trials."" I stopped looking for them because I no longer need to find some heavenly reason for why I feel so shitty. I also stopped using the word ""miracles"" as well, to extrude some normal occurrence into a significant heavenly intervention to feel some kind of meaning.

I no longer feel shitty. I have meaning. That's by far the biggest thing I was missing out on. I'm so glad I'm a ""today"" kind of guy now and don't have to keep telling myself things will be okay later.",10,1752387414.0,exmormon,4,0.92,False
