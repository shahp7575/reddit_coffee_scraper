1ql8prh,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/1ql8prh/does_anyone_else_do_everything_alone/,Does anyone else do everything alone?,"I'm 22, and I pretty much do everything alone. I never had close friends, so I was often excluded from things, and my attempts at initiating meetups have been unsuccessful a lot of the time. I don't necessarily enjoy doing things alone, but I just became used to this being my normal. 

I do all the simple things such as shopping, eating out, grabbing coffee at a café, walking in the park or sightseeing, visiting museums, and various things along those lines alone. I don't go to concerts, bars, or anything super daunting or social alone. I plan to attend a concert alone for the first time this summer. It can become quite repetitive and depressing at times. Sometimes, I do become hyper-aware of all the friend groups around me, and it leaves me feeling empty. I finished a difficult paper last semester and had nobody to celebrate with, so I just went to McDonald's alone, but it made me feel really terrible about myself and my ongoing situation. I seldomly meet up with friends, and because those experiences are so rare, I never want the night to end. When the night does come to a close, I am left feeling incredibly hollow for weeks. I mostly invite my siblings out, so at least I have them as a good support system sometimes. 

I stopped frequenting certain spots because I would get recognised by random people for always being there alone. I have been approached by people who probably don't have the best intentions. I will have a decent conversation with a stranger sometimes, but it ends after that. It was also kind of embarrassing for the staff to know that it was not just a once off but my everyday life. I try to bring headphones and sometimes a book to appear less weird and out of place. I check my phone every few minutes as if I am checking messages, but it's really to appear more normal. I would be lying if I said that my presence alone isn't starting to play on my mind a lot nowadays. I feel like a loser sometimes, and as if people are either feeling sorry for me or judging me for awkwardly being there alone. 

I don't know how to change this, and I feel as if I am wasting my twenties being stagnant and lonely. I want to make memories and have actual experiences. When I look back on my year, it's usually a blur because it was just my own thoughts and presence with nothing memorable or particularly exciting happening. I can recall what others were doing around me more vividly than my own experiences. I am stuck in a cycle that I desperately want to break. I can feel myself becoming more reclusive and anxious, and it's only worsening my situation. ",2,1769216333.0,CasualConversation,0,1.0,False

Cutting straight to it.

Below are honest observations from days 120–150, written as they happened. Some are difficult to explain. Some uncomfortable. All are real to me.

**Repeating Numbers**

This intensified a lot. I see repeating numbers constantly and unintentionally: Elevators Phone screen, License plates, Time displays

111 appears everywhere.

From personal experience, I noticed that 66 / 666 / 6666 often appear right before a bad decision or during moments of weakness. I treat these as a signal to stay alert, especially before possible relapse moments.

**Dreams**

One of the strangest dreams I’ve ever had. I was watching a documentary where scientists unscrewed my penis like a camera lens. They told me I was stuck and needed to be “drained” to function properly.

I resisted, put it back, and woke up immediately.

**Unexpected DM From a Celebrity**

A well-known celebrity reached out unexpectedly. We worked together about six years ago.He asked me to help write a script. We spent two days on set creating something deeply artistic. Honestly, one of the happiest and most fulfilling experiences I’ve had in years.

**Weather, Moon Cycles, and Urges**

Two weeks of intense rain in LA combined with a full moon. I’ve noticed this pattern multiple times: Urges spike during rainy periods, Lunar cycles amplify mental pressure, The urge feels external, like something trying to install itself

If you resist, it feels like respect is earned.

Weird note:

Every time I post my face or achievements on IG Stories, urges intensify the same day. Still trying to understand why.

**Disconnection From People (Especially Parents)**

This was a big one. Some people, especially parents, suddenly feel unfamiliar.

With my mother: Silent respect and admiration, Passive-aggressive criticism when I become “too much”, Attempts to put me back into a small boy position

I stopped sharing breakthroughs with my parents.

They want me to succeed, but real transformation threatens old dynamics.

They notice: Hair loss Mood swings

They don’t notice: 150 days of emotional stability, No complaining, No collapse

That part hurts.

**Growth of People Around Me**

This surprised me. People around me suddenly leveled up: A best friend who avoided content creation for 10 years now posts consistently. My mom studies Spanish every morning at 5 a.m. before work

At her job, everyone’s salary was delayed.

Except hers.

**Pushback, Hate, and Group Dynamics**

I stopped attending church due to financial manipulation.

I tried SAA meetings.

Some people became offended by my perspective, even though we are in the same boat.

After one share where I used the metaphor “semen is Christ’s soil,” a guy waited after the meeting to confront me.

Lesson learned:

Success and fresh thinking are not always celebrated, even in recovery spaces.

**Physical Changes** Back pain completely gone, Core feels strong despite minimal workouts. Hair regrowth surprised me.

Looking at my father’s photos in his early 20s, he was almost bald.

I genuinely believe long-term depletion played a role in his mental and physical decline.

**Time Feels Slower**. Everyone says time flies. For me, it slowed down. In December 2025, I did more in one month than I used to do in a year while depleted.

**Perception and Awareness Shifts** \- Fake acting in movies becomes obvious,awward shows feel different, manifestations feel almost instant..

I noticed that what I consume emotionally manifests faster. After watching robbery content and getting emotionally involved, I got robbed the next day. I now guard my consciousness carefully.

**Nature and Sensitivity**

At times it feels like: nature communicates, objects have energy, awareness feels child-like but expanded. Hard to explain without sounding crazy..

**Astral and Visual Experiences**

I experienced what felt like astral projection. I saw small entities with half faces and sharp teeth. Later, I noticed similar visuals around certain people at SAA meetings while fully conscious.

**Social and Female Dynamics**

Women reach out offering free internships for my business. One thing I know for sure:

If I sleep with them, they disappear. Boundaries matter more than ever.

**Mental Sharpness**

I feel sharp.Not claiming genius. Just present and capable in ways I wasn’t before.

**Unexpected Circles**

I somehow entered conversations with venture capitalists.

People with $800M+ exits.

They listen attentively.

There is mutual respect.

Even though I’m still in debt, I feel like I belong in those rooms.

# The Ugly Side..

Abandonment trauma resurfaced. Strong competitiveness increased

Ego still reacts to validation from chicks who watch my IG stories..

# Advice to Fellow Retainers

Never put your guard down. Addiction is a snake..

When things go well, expect attacks..

Compulsive relapses are the most damaging.

Literally everything can be bought except retention these days. You can't fake this confidence. It's earned through sacrafice.

***Final Test (Day 149)*** 

I met a woman.

Coffee turned into us naked in my bedroom.

She was leaving town in two days. My old pattern. (fuck!)

On top of that she opened up that she was celibate for 7 years and if we do this I'll be her second man. The energy and tension was so RAW and electric that i couldn't even explain..

I looked at my goals, breathed consciously, and told her to get dressed. Nothing happened.

I fed her, called an Uber, shared about my retention journey.. and sent her back to the hotel.

She emailed me nine times calling me “the most special man on Earth.”

I blocked her.

**I wanna finish this essay with the quote:**

*"" When you retain, everything is easy except retention. When you release, everything is hard except releasing.""*

I’ve been on probation at a sales job recently, and it’s been a surprisingly harsh lesson in how fragile self-worth can feel in certain workplaces.

Two new hires came in recently who are excellent at the job. One even looks and acts a lot like me. They’re hitting targets, getting glowing customer reviews (something I was praised on before they arrived at being great at), and fitting in socially—grabbing coffees for management, bonding with everyone—while I was sick and struggling to meet numbers during probation.

Seeing them thrive has made me feel… replaceable. It’s not that I’m objectively worse, but metrics, social dynamics, and group interactions make it easy to internalize comparisons and doubt your own value. Being younger, more social, or just “in the right place at the right time” seems to count for so much, even if you know your skills and experience are solid.

I think this is something anyone in a competitive, metrics-driven environment can relate to: no matter how hard you try, it sometimes feels like you could be swapped out at any moment.

Has anyone else felt this way in sales—or any job where performance and social dynamics are constantly measured? How do you cope with the feeling of being “replaceable” while still staying confident in your own abilities?

1ql8l3u,https://www.reddit.com/r/lexapro/comments/1ql8l3u/15_day_update_long_post_sorry/,15 day update (Long Post Sorry),"So a little less than 2 weeks ago now I posted on this sub because I was having horrific side effects after starting 5mg Lexapro. 

In short. It sent me to the hell dimension on day 4. 

But I really really need the meds to work. So after consulting with my psychiatrist I decided to lower the dose to 2.5mg and stick with it. I also moved to taking them in the morning instead of the evening. 

It’s day 15 now and here is my update. 

I still have pretty bad anxiety that is manifesting differently than it was before Lexapro. 

Hard to tell here what is still a side effect and what is my brain doing the thing that got me here in the first place. 

Before my anxiety was almost always fast heart rate and dizzy feeling. Now it’s very chest pain and stomach pain and burning. 

Nausea almost completely gone. 

Other GI symptoms still present but reduced. Again, these are also a symptom of my normal anxiety so hard to tell for sure what is what here. 

Sleep is back to about what it was before I started the Lex. (Which is still very disrupted from my normal baseline). 

Let me tell you the first few days of Lexapro made me feel like I was drinking the strongest coffee known to man. I was not sleeping more than 4-6 hours a night. Not tired in the slightest. Constantly anxious. Could not remember names, or details for shit. 

I have regained the ability to feel tired just in the last few days. 

On the upside I HAVE actually managed to regulate my anxiety for stretches for a few hours at a time. Thinking at this point maybe a positive Lex effect, maybe just me finally getting a handle on my intrusive thoughts somewhat. 

It’s only day 15 on 2.5mg so hard to say.

NOAA had issued Extreme Cold Weather advisories across New England for Friday evening through to Saturday; the perfect weather to keep all the flatlanders away from your snow globe sanctuary.

Every Friday in winter, for the last four years, you've thrown your split-board in the rusty 2002 Subaru Legacy (your mother bought ""Certified-Used"" when you were three years old) and headed out to the bowl, usually staying 'til the last run at 9PM.

You could have gone to UVM on a Green and Gold scholarship, but you asked your mom to stop at a ski mountain on the way home from the visit to the big city. Between your grades and a single parent income, you got offered a second full ride scholarship in exchange for being a dash of local flavor at the rich kid school. The modest slopes and three chair lifts were the key value proposition of the private college.

Tonight, there was only a small gang of snowboarders at the shelter and a few rogue skiers whipping about. With the harder snow from last week's melt, you opted for skis, grabbing your poles from the trunk. A face-warmer and goggles were absolutely necessary, leaving nothing exposed to the cold.

It was a string of empty chairs all the way up the mountain, but as you scooted forward for your first ride up, a skier turned at speed and stopped directly on the line next to you, right as you bent your knees for the chair to pick you up. You glanced at the lift operator, as if to say ""did you see that"", but Brett was looking at his phone again.

Looking down as the ground dropped away, the full spectacle of your fellow traveler hit you.

It was as if someone had been transported from Mont Blanc forty years ago into present day Vermont. Long narrow heavy laminated fiberglass skis, massive chunky boots and a mostly neon one piece jumpsuit with bright colorful patchwork. It was so very mid-80s, but also new old stock. The attire was mint, unfaded, unsoiled, equipment without a scratch. It looked like someone spent several thousand dollars on ski gear in the poshest towns of Switzerland money laundering in the go-go eighties, then put the entire getup in a closet for forty years.

""Jody? Is that Jody?""

Oh gosh, this loon knows you, there goes your sanctuary time.

""Yes?"", you stammer.

""I recognize that silicone piercing. It's Carl, Professor Carl Sable. You took my intro to political science course a few semesters ago."", he said.

""Hah! That's some retro outfit you got there."" you say, as you pull down your face warmer, ""I was just thinking about you on the drive here. Public radio is telling the whole country that all your crazy predictions are coming true. The United States is planning to invade Greenland, then perhaps Canada and Russia ...""

""... and it's all because of The Mercator Projection!"" you both shout in unison with a belly laugh.

""Yes, it's difficult to convince someone of the true magnitude of things when they are perpetually shown a world view that systematically distorts reality."", the professor said. ""Hopefully he doesn't invade Russia though.""

""I suppose it's better to have hostile attention directed at the ice covered barren wastelands rather than countries where people actually live."", you offer.

""Always looking at the whole picture, Jody the Panoptic"", the professor quipped.

""I guess so. Lots of time to think on the top of the world"", you say.

The banter paused as a stiff wind made it difficult to hear.

""You are graduating this year, RIGHT? ANY PLANS LINED UP?"" Professor Sable yelled.

You shout: ""WHELP, I had HOPED to get a job in WASHINGTON, but with the way things are turning out, THAT'S LOOKING LIKE A BUST! There's a GLUT of HIGHLY-QUALIFIED people and NO JOBS! I've applied to the graduate program HERE. So I'll probably STICK AROUND for another two years.""

""You're in a STEM TRACK RIGHT!?!"" Carl yelled into silence as the wind stopped abruptly, like everyone in a bustling cafe hushing in unison to hear your answer,

""Yeah, physics major, math minor. My older brother was a video game developer. He taught me how to code when I was ten. I just wanted to be able to make cooler games with him."" you explain, ""I didn't realize that the senior job fair would be mostly defense contractors or the Department of Energy for me.""

""Oh. So you're somehow allergic to money?"" the professor jabbed.

""I don't want to make weapons."" you shoot back.

""Then why not make video games with your brother?"" Carl asked.

You pause, take a deep breath and in a rapid monotonous tone say: ""My brother broke his leg skiing at Killington while visiting for Christmas in 2019. ' multiple surgeries and a lot of pain killers; our mom tried to warn him. He had been working for a big game studio in Portland, but they shutdown in-person for COVID. Then he got laid off the next January. He O.D.ed right before Christmas in 2022. Fentanyl.""

Professor Sable raised his matching mittens abruptly, forgetting there were poles attached to his wrist as he said, ""I'm so sorry. I remember now. You wrote that paper on the legal changes to requirements for criminal prosecution at the DEA.""

""I'm so very sorry for your loss. It's such a terrible epidemic"", he added.

You both tip your skis up as the ramp rises to meet you. As you both slide off the chair, you turned your back and shout over your shoulder:

""Every year, one hundred thousand more ... "",

*... dead Americans.* you say in your head, as you speed away, over The Long Trail and down the back slope riding the edge of darkness.

You consciously pull the end of the caustic sentence so the hundred thousand needles might go deeper if Professor Carl finishes the sentence in his own voice.

You had spent the winter of your freshman year memorizing precision topography of the entire mountain using data downloaded from the Vermont's public geographic information database. You misused some computer lab resources and the expensive plotter at school to print a massive custom shaded topographic map with more detail of the mountain than any available map. It was the exact width of your dorm wall. You even sold a couple digital copies of the pdf to friends.

By your sophomore year, you had built virtual computer models to plan fringe out-of-bounds lines where you could cut out of designated areas for fresh untouched powder. But a ""run in"" with a tree and a concussion alone in the woods ended those adventures. You only ride within the lines now.

You stop on the edge to look at a giant hollowed out Eastern Hemlock with an enormous pile of telltale porcupine droppings frozen in a perfect meter high cone at the bottom.

That's a way to be Jody; what a piece of work.

Someone tries to have a simple conversation and you turn your back to offer them a hundred thousand barbed jabs in return. What a nasty asymmetric defense. What a lonely creature, in a lonely place. Jody the panoptic porcupine, barbs out, alone with a pile of excrement as a warning to all who would come near.

A haunting chill sinks over you. You feel deep regret at your turn of phrase and swift departure. Your flash of rage toward the world turns to guilt. So you head down the backside looking for the electric neon Sable.

You spot him shuffling his antique skis toward the back lift. You go in at full speed, stopping on the line as the chair picks you both up. You smile and wave with all your charm as the operator shoots you a grizzly look.

""Have you ever been to Monterey Jody?"", Carl picks up.

""California? I've never been on a plane professor."" you say.

""Well, as you are probably aware, the college maintains a satellite campus there...""

""Maintained, past-tense. They're shutting it down."" you interrupt.

""... right, but it's not shut down yet."" he continues, ""and they've had a number of students drop out because their visas were canceled, or for sundry other reasons with grants and whatnot."" he explained.

""So they need to maintain a minimum number of butts in seats for the next two years for accreditation. Since you say you don't like bombs, I was thinking ... well they have collected the leading researchers and thinkers in the field of nonproliferation ..."",

""Nukes are very much bombs professor."" you say,

""... not just nukes, their work is much broader, focused on preventing the use of weapons of mass destruction more generally. If you want to apply your world view and talents defensively against war, and against a whole array of weapons, they are the experts."" He pauses.

""Do they have a social media expert?"" you ask.

""HA! No. Yes... free speech is a tricky thing."" he says,

The clutch of rowdy snowboarders set up camp on the nape of a ridgeline on the Long Trail and were trying to scream across Lake Champlain to someone in New York through the inversion layer of ultra-cold compressed air, but the direction of wind wasn't in their favor.

""The cold doesn't bother them?"", Sable asks.

""I think they brought a flask for warmth"", you say.

""Ah ha. Listen, I have it on authority, if you apply, you'll get in. I know you're a Vermonter on scholarship, but there is a little money in a grant for the summer (about five grand when the job is complete) and I can get you a free place to live, right by the beach."" he promises.

""There is a research project a few years old that a group is looking to have updated. They want someone out there this summer, by the first week of June, to update the data and re-run a simulation that's already been done. It's super easy, just updating datasets and hitting run.""

""Do you surf Jody?"", Carl asks, as he ends his pitch.

""What's this simulation about?"" you ask.

""Have you ever heard of star wars?"" he returns,

""Like Obi-Wan Kenobi?"" you say,

""No no, think more like space satellites, like GoldenEye"", he said.

""I broke the joystick on my brother's old controller when I was four and he never let me touch his Nintendo 64 again, so I never really played it"", you say.

""I've never seen the puzzle in a first person shooter"", you add.

""Ahhh―well listen"", he stammered as the top of the lift approached. ""Shoot me an email when you get accepted and I can send you the contact info for the apartment and the research project.""

As you disembarked from the lift, you nearly fell backward as all control on one ski was lost. You look down to see your right ski has structurally failed; it delaminated (split into layers) right at the heel of the binding. The binding holes failed at the same time.

After six years, thousands of runs, back-country trails, rocks, trees, jumps, flips and turns, your split board is finally ""split city"".

""Looks like it's time for some new skis,"" Carl says.

Not wanting to go down from the summit on one ski, you unclip the bindings and try to join the two halves back into a board as best you can, remounting the bindings across both halves.

""That's a neat trick."" Professor Carl says,

""Yeah, it was kind of expensive. It was a sixteenth birthday present. Cost more than my car at the time, ' probably not going to get a new one this season."" you explain.

""Maybe a new board in Monterey then. It was good to see you, but it's cold out here, shoot me an email"".

As he trailed way shouting, ""And Jody... you'll never see all the distortions from a single point."", and with that the neon sable fishered it's way down the hill to a speck.

Gone was your evening, ski season and sanctuary time.

You limp your board down the mountain on one and a half edges, snow packing between the layers, swelling as it goes. You knocked out what ice you could and threw it across the back seat of your mom's old Subaru.

As you wind down the mountain on the back road, you slow down for what looks like a black bear walking along the side of the road on a flat straight.

You stop the car.

Well, that is not right. Because it's January.

All the bears have to be denned up by now. What the hell is this creature?

It turns to cross the road, dragging a massive tree branch above it's head, like a giant rodent flag bearer without a petard.

Jeez-um CROW, its got to be the most massive beaver in Vermont. A fifty pound tank. HOLLLY CRAP.

You look downhill and notice the massive area has been inundated under a sheet of snow covered ice. You'd never noticed that in four years.

Seems like beavers are normally in for the season when you're driving by. Perhaps the record drought put this guy behind on food for the winter.

The enormous magnificent beast stops on the centerline and stares directly at you. It lifts its body to preen some gravel from its chest and belly with its forearms. Slowly. Almost as if to say: ""Yeah, you like that?""

In its glistening pelt, you catch a shimmer of the orbicular bullion that made John Jacob Astor break so bad―a store of wealth and power for survival that could be extremely tempting to commodify, at the most terrible irreparable cost to America.

What a beautiful creature. What a landscape.

Back to your current milieu, you look down to see the oil light has come on again.

You put your four-ways on, kill the ignition, pop the hood, then pull the break as you reach behind the passenger seat to grab a fresh quart of oil and the funnel (and rag) all in one hand.

Normally you don't need a funnel, but with the cold temperature, this could turn into a fluid dynamics comedy. The oil starts to come out of the quart as one giant ball of molasses. You try to stop it immediately as it comes out, but now the ball of oil has formed a column of tacky coffee toffee sucking itself out of the bottle by its own viscosity. Oh lord, make it stop.

As you struggle to contain your imminent ecological crimes against the mountain beaver habitat, two cars speed down the road and swerve around you. A Benz and a Beamer, red and blue, New Jersey and Massachusets, both with campus parking stickers. Freshmen probably. They're done yelling and snowboarding too apparently.

They each clip the whimsy top of the beaver's tree as they swerve back into the right lane. The ancient rodent jerks, then bolts, leaving the tail of his trophy blocking half the road.

You look back down under the hood, you see the slow-motion oil confectionary disaster has mostly been averted by the funnel and your inattention. You put the quart bottle back in the car and throw the beaver his dinner as you wait for the rest of the molasses to get through the funnel.

That could have been a close one.

You stare at the yellow ""05 26"" sticker in the windshield. Last May was the only time Tyler's grandpa let it pass inspection without a hassle. Right before his garage closed in August, that was last time anyone would ever work on this car.

You don't really need a car; you can take the bus or train to visit home, which you've been doing anyhow.

Given the Legacy's mass and current stored gravitational potential energy at an elevation of approximately three hundred meters above sea level, if it didn't start again, does a pathway exist to pilot it into one of Vermont's many privately held steel reserve stockpiles without calling a tow truck, or endangering life and limb with the missile?

... wait wait wait, go back ... this bear beaver story still doesn't make sense.

How in the wintry hell does the beaver get back under the ice? It's negative ten degrees. The ice must be six inches thick by now. It's den is clearly visible fifty yards out, with an entire underworld food storage system protected by six inches of ice armor.

How is it getting under the ice to get home to the den?

This isn't plausible.

You close the hood of the Subaru, and you hear faint muffled craunching. You walk forward ten yards and peer over the edge of the road, you see the beaver has pulled its tree into a large corrugated pipe culvert.

The residual heat from the ground must be keeping the water in the buried pipe from freezing, at the moment. That's the entrance, and it swims to the den from there; a culvert to the underworld. It will probably still freeze hard tonight if it stays as cold as they're saying. That might be its last fresh meal of the winter.

But, if the beaver's portal to The Upside Down is an under-the-road wildlife passage, we're left with one last cliched puzzle to solve.

You do an about face and walk to the downstream side of the road to see the pipe outlet has been submerged by flooding. There's thick solid ice up to and covering the crown. The beaver couldn't enter the portal that way, and that is *why* the beaver ... you know. Ba dum 'tis.

You're so funny Jody.

A narrow sliver of a waning crescent moon illuminates the alien landscape beyond. There's probably thirty acres, all now protected by ice. The den exterior is rock hard too by now. Along the edges, a ring of century old hemlocks blacken the perimeter providing aerial cover (and habitat). It looks like the stands of deciduous trees are harvested in phases.

You step one foot out onto the ice. Not a peep pop or tong. It's seems thick. There's a whole world down there, with food in storage for a growing family. It's a home for a host of other creatures in suspended animation.

That's the way to be Jody. Certainly beats an old mound of crap.

Back in the car, you turn the key. The Legacy roars back with no oil light.

You release the parking break and feather the clutch to get enough momentum to escape the local minimum of the beaver's domain.

You wonder if you can take a train all the way to Monterey.

A computer simulation. More free school; free housing. Five grand ain't much, but what's the worst that could possibly happen?

You turn the radio on to hear: ""threatened trade sanctions in retaliation over Greenland in Davos"" ... and that's a NOPE.

You hit #4 to see if you can pickup Montreal off the ionosphere.

Et ""vous écoutes \[a bunch of static\]"" off a bit of a ionic reflection, but it's not enough.

You hit #5 for ""Dirt"" radio, and catch a singer song writer on her bridge:

>Hold your friends, forgive the night

>Die to love and live your life ...

1ql8jx3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Breath_of_the_Wild/comments/1ql8jx3/i_accidentally_beat_the_calamity_ganon/,I accidentally beat the Calamity Ganon.,"Okay so this might be long winded but i legitimately have no one else to share this outrageous experience with. 

It’s 7am. I’ve just woken up and having my morning coffee on my couch. I live in Chicago and today we had record breaking cold, so I couldn’t go outside for my morning walk before work. With this new free time, I decided I would have a morning BOTW sesh. 

I had just beaten the windblight ganon the night before and wanted to take today to frolic around and forage for things. One thing about me is I love treasure and loot. The meaner the enemy the better the treasure and my confidence had been thoroughly boosted after killing the last blight ganon. So I had the bright idea to go to the castle for the first time. 

I made it into the castle with no issue. I’m staring to think this might be easy. Then I started to find the treasure. Oh man the treasure was GREAT. I found ancient arrows, shock arrows, bomb arrows, and so much more. I was on a high from all this good stuff I hadn’t realized how deep and high I was getting into the castle. Until… 

I stumbled into the hall where that monstrous calamity ganon hangs out. I’m panicking at this point. I have 3 meals in my pocket and about 287 apples. There is no way I’m surviving this. But then the spirits of my fallen comrades arrive and significantly lower calamities XP. so I’m sitting here on this cold Friday thinking, “eh why not let me just try. I’ll die and then I can zip over somewhere safe” (kakariko village❤️). 

But something weird was happening. I was fighting this thing. Stasis was my bestie. I’m gorging my 287 apples. Running around like a psycho trying to get away from this thing and suddenly. I BEAT HIM. No way ?? I’m sitting here thinking no fucking way I just did that. 

Oh but we’re not done yet. I had no idea there was a part two to this freak. I’m zipped away to a pasture where I have to ride a horse. ( I’m not good at the horses and avoid them at all costs). Zelda gives me that bomb af bow and I’m like okay so how am I supposed to do this. I’m down to 60 apples now you guys. 60. This was supposed to be just a little joke and I wasn’t being for real, but it was happening and this was real. 

So I get on this horse and I’m shitting the bed right. I’m shooting where Zelda is telling me nothing was happening and I’m so confused. It took me a whole five minutes to realize I wasn’t even using the bow she gave me. I’m running the horse all around in the wrong direction the suddenly my horse was clobbered and ran away. Now I’m on foot running away from this beast. 

Once I got the correct bow I started doing some damage. I’m flying in the air shooting left and right, poppin those gold circles like it’s my job (which in fact by this point I was supposed to be clocked in working my actual job).

Then it happens. I hit that final gold circle. Oh but no, we’re not done yet. I’m sweating now. My coffee is coursing through my veins at a rapid pace. I know I’m almost done with this beast but I have to get the final shot. 

And I do. 

Then it’s just over. And I’m sitting here thinking how tf did this just happen. I wasn’t ready for the game to be finished. And now I’m sad. But also my ego has been boosted 600% because wtf. No preparation and hardly any food (shoutout apples). 

So the point of this story is that there is no point. I just finished the game and I’m not sure what else to do. Taking donations for the next Zelda game because why is it so expensive ??

I prompted Gemini to parse their value proposition from a very recent YouTube video they alerted me on:

Hyperscale Data’s value proposition is built on a hybrid infrastructure model designed to bridge the gap between high-performance AI demands and the financial flexibility of digital assets.

Core components of the company's value proposition are:

​1. AI-Optimized Infrastructure
​The company specializes in deploying high-performance GPU compute power tailored for heavy-duty workloads, including artificial intelligence, machine learning, and enterprise computing. By modernizing legacy industrial sites, they transform existing infrastructure into next-generation compute environments, aiming for higher efficiency and reliability than traditional data centers.

​2. Parallel Compute Model
​A distinct technical advantage is their ""parallel compute model,"" which allows AI systems and digital asset (Bitcoin) mining infrastructure to operate simultaneously. This setup: ​Maximizes Utilization: It ensures the power and hardware are consistently used even when AI demand fluctuates.
​Operational Control: It allows the company to balance workloads in real-time to maintain stability and performance across the platform.
​3. Strategic Use of Bitcoin
​Unlike pure-play AI data centers, Hyperscale Data uses Bitcoin as a strategic financial tool.
​Balance Sheet Strength: Bitcoin is treated as a treasury asset to provide liquidity and long-term strategic flexibility.
​Resilience: This digital asset treasury acts as a buffer, providing the company with capital that isn't solely tied to traditional enterprise contracts.
​4. Public Transparency & Market Access
​As a publicly traded company on the NYSE American ($GPUS), Hyperscale Data emphasizes transparency and accountability. This provides investors with a regulated entry point into the AI infrastructure and Bitcoin sectors, backed by the ability to access public capital markets to fund their planned 2026 expansion of compute capacity.
​Summary of Positioning

​Hyperscale Data positions itself as ""AI-powered, Bitcoin-backed, and enterprise-ready."" The value lies in the synergy between these two sectors: using AI to drive high-margin enterprise services while using Bitcoin to ensure a resilient and liquid financial foundation.

I'm not a big Bitcoin fan and I'm not aware of the technical feasibility of the strategy but I'm staying put. Who knows, maybe get another 1,000 next payday. It's got an asymmetrical upside for coffee money. Hanging in there. (Hope I'm not breaking rules or hurting any feelings folks).

1. NYC/NJ

New York City is an amalgamation of cultures and a diverse worldwide hub. So it only makes sense for it to be number one. There is a plethora of amazing restaurants from all different types of cultures. You will never get bored of the food here as you can try a different place every time and be satisfied. It truly is a spectacle of culinary quality. Now I could never live here because the cost of living just isn’t worth it, but the food is fantastic. 

  
2. DC/Maryland/VA

This could easily be number 1 in my opinion. I am biased towards Asian food since I am south asian myself, and the DMV has the best halal Asian food in America. But it is also diverse with tons of quality food options wherever you go. There are so many finer dining restaurants with quality food. And there are also tons of great yemeni coffee and chai spots. As well as diverse fast casual spots for hangout you won’t find much of in NYC. 

3. Dallas

This area has the fastest growing Muslim population in the U.S. and has also quickly become the best area for Muslims. The food is also amazing and is only getting better. There are tons of diverse food options with amazing quality and with large portions. I would not be surprised if it takes over the number 1 spot in a few years. 

  
4. Chicago 

This area has the best places for middle eastern food in particular. But is also still very diverse with all types of restaurants. Bridgeview has the largest Palestinian population in the U.S so you will find tons of great options there. Each suburb, as well as downtown Chicago has amazing options in every corner, with some areas being densely populated with quality halal restaurants.

# Leo

I don’t like being seen.

It’s not the fake, dramatic kind of invisible you see in movies, where the girl wears glasses and a ponytail and waits for someone to notice she’s pretty. I mean it literally. I’ve gone entire school years without a single teacher remembering my name. I’ve been marked absent while sitting in the front row, staring the instructor in the eye. I’ve waved, I’ve spoken, I even screamed once in the middle of a crowded cafeteria.

Nothing. People’s eyes just slide right off me, like their brains are programmed to ignore a glitch in the software. I used to think it was just me, that I was too pale, too quiet, too boring to exist.

But this morning, the world felt solid.

Tasha glanced at me, and for a second, I felt like I actually had a silhouette. Gabe bumped into me in the hall and actually muttered an apology instead of walking through me like I was a cloud of smoke. Even Daniel met my eyes for a heartbeat. It felt like falling upward, nauseating, dizzy, and completely wrong.

My uncle, at least, remained blissfully unaware.

“Eggs!” he barked from the kitchen as I headed out. He wasn’t cooking eggs. He was just shouting the word at the toaster for the fourth time this week. The man drinks vinegar like it’s top shelf wine and refers to the microwave as The Orb. He’s all I have, a great uncle who probably thinks I’m a fever dream he’s been having since 1974. And honestly? Maybe I am. Maybe that’s why I feel blurry, like the world is rendered in high definition for everyone else, but I’m just a smudge in the background.

When I got to school, the volume of the world had been turned up too high. I stepped into the classroom expecting the usual comfort of being ignored. Instead, the air shifted the moment I crossed the threshold. Gabe dropped his coin. Tasha’s static spiked. Daniel rubbed his nose like he could smell a storm coming. Even the Teacher stopped mid sentence, his eyes flickering toward my corner before he could catch himself.

I sat in the back, pulling my hood low. No one said anything, but they felt me. And I felt them feeling me. That was worse than being invisible. That was a target.

# The Teacher

Director Reyna showed up ten minutes early. She doesn’t do it out of efficiency. She does it because she likes to catch people in the act of being unprepared.

“Zenos,” she said. Her voice was syrupy, with a sharp, medicinal edge that made my teeth ache. “You look conscious. How refreshing.”

“Reyna,” I replied, not bothering to look up from my coffee. “To what do I owe the threat? You usually don’t make house calls unless someone’s about to be fired or executed.”

She drifted into the room like a pale moth, hair sprayed into a rigid helmet of perfection. Her smile didn’t reach her eyes. It never did. “The Council will be joining us shortly. I trust your project is presentable?”

“They’re students, Reyna. Not show dogs.”

“So, no.” She let out a long, theatrical sigh, marking something on her clipboard with aggressive precision. She leaned in closer, the fake sweetness dropping away to reveal the cold iron underneath. “Zenos, listen to me. You’ve been making waves. Some people like what you’re doing. Others find it troubling. Today is your only chance to prove that Class F isn’t just a glorified dumpster for the unfixable.”

I took a pull of my lukewarm coffee. It tasted like charcoal and regret.

“They don’t need to be icons,” she whispered. “Just make them look functional. Don’t let anyone die, and for the love of God, don’t let them embarrass the budget.”

“Low bar,” I muttered. “We’ll try not to trip over it.”

I watched her heels click a rhythmic warning as she left. Heroes and liabilities. In this building, the difference was usually just a matter of who was holding the pen.

Then the Council arrived.

They didn’t walk in. They occupied the space. James, Joseph, and Russell. My old unit. My old life. They stood behind the observation glass like statues carved from judgment. James, in his severe black uniform, was as still as a grave. Joseph watched with the clinical, bored detachment of a coroner. And Russell just smiled, looking at my students like he was eyeing a new set of tires he intended to shred.

They didn’t say a word. James just gave a slight nod. Begin.

My palms were sweating. I hated it. I keyed in the sequence, Level One variables. Basic evasion. Nothing lethal. Just don’t break anything, I thought. Just stay on your feet.

“Scenario Alpha,” I announced. “Active.”

The room below hummed to life, bathed in the sterile blue glow of the simulation grids. Turrets hissed as they extended from the walls. For five seconds, it looked like a drill. Then the wheels came off.

It started with Trent. He’s a molecular vibrator. When he gets anxious, he starts to hum. This morning, he was screaming internally. Static crackled off his skin, arcing toward the metal railings. He tried to ground himself, but he was building a charge too fast.

Zap. A bolt of blue static jumped from his elbow and caught Gabe in the shoulder.

Gabe didn’t just flinch. He detonated. His reflex shockwave wasn’t aimed, it was a sphere of pure concussive force. The air buckled. A dummy target was pulverized into yellow foam and plastic shrapnel.

The blast knocked Tasha off balance. She yelped, her hands flying out to catch the wall, but Tasha doesn’t catch things. She fries them. Violet sparks erupted from her palms, scorching the floor tiles and filling the air with the sharp, ozone stink of burnt rubber.

“Formation!” I barked into the mic. It was useless. Chaos doesn’t follow a script.

Bea was already panicking, shoving gummy bears into her mouth as if her life depended on the sugar rush. “Cereal!” she shrieked, pointing at the ceiling. “Heavy grain!”

It wasn’t cereal. It was a foam debris block falling from a ceiling trap. But Clint didn’t look up. He didn’t need to. He stared at the metal buckle holding the block, a vein throbbing in his temple. Click. The buckle snapped before the trap even fully opened. The block fell early, crashing harmlessly to the side.

Then Mina sneezed.

The reaction was instantaneous. A vine as thick as a python, emerald green and covered in thorns, punched through a steel floor panel. It whipped upward, shattering concrete and wrapping itself around a turret, crushing the machine like a tin can.

I winced. That was half my monthly maintenance budget gone in a sneeze.

But the real disaster was in the center. Daniel.

He was trying to weave through the mess, head down, desperate to be invisible. But Livia was right beside him, her sketchpad open, trying to draw a safe path through the madness. She didn’t see the drone swinging low.

“Left!” Livia shouted, sketching a frantic arrow on the page.

Daniel dodged. Too hard. He slammed into a padded barrier, his nose crunching against his own knee.

It happened in slow motion. I saw the drop of blood fly from his lip. It didn’t hit the ground. Daniel’s fear caught it. The droplet hovered, spinning, vibrating with a jagged, kinetic hunger. It elongated, sharpening into a needle, locking onto the nearest source of heat.

Not a turret. Not Jerrod.

Russell.

Russell wasn’t behind the glass. He was leaning over the railing, watching the carnage with a predatory grin. The blood needle trembled, locked onto his throat. I lunged for the kill switch, knowing I wouldn’t be fast enough.

And then, Leo took a step.

He hadn’t moved the entire time. He’d been a shadow in the corner. But now, he walked into the center of the storm. He didn’t run. He didn’t shout.

And the storm simply forgot itself.

Leo blinked. A ripple went through the room, not a force, but a missing frame in a film reel. The lights dimmed for a microsecond. Daniel’s blood needle lost its tension and splashed into a harmless puddle. Trent’s static died. Mina’s vine slumped against the wall like a dead snake.

Silence followed. A heavy, muffled silence, like hearing the world through a layer of thick wool. The kids froze, blinking, looking around as if they’d suddenly forgotten what they were doing there.

I looked at the Council. Joseph had stopped writing. His pen was hovering an inch above the paper. Russell’s grin was gone, replaced by a look of intense, dark curiosity. And James, the statue, had leaned forward. His eyes weren’t on Daniel or the vine. They were fixed on the empty space where Leo was standing.

I slammed the shutdown button.

“Test concluded,” I said, my voice sounding thin over the speakers.

The lights came up. Below, the kids started laughing, that shaky, high pitched laughter of people who don’t realize how close they just came to dying. They were high fiving, thinking they’d passed a messy drill. They didn’t realize that reality had just glitched.

I turned toward the Council. We’d spent fifteen years together in the Association. We’d cleared nests, silenced insurgents, and buried friends. I knew how they thought. They didn’t make house calls for charity.

James stood up first. He isn’t a large man, but he takes up more room than men twice his size. His black hair was cut in that same severe military crop, his skin pale and chalky under the lights. He didn’t blink. He never does. James is a man who turned himself into stone so the world couldn’t hurt him anymore. He walked past me without a glance, treating me like a piece of furniture he’d already decided to throw away.

Then Joseph. He capped his pen. Click. He was the opposite of James, thin, blonde, with a face so gaunt he looked like he was recovering from a terminal fever. But his green eyes were sharp enough to cut. He gave me a single, cold nod and followed James out.

That left Russell.

He stayed by the railing, a massive silhouette against the glass. At six three, with skin the color of deep mahogany and a head covered in a fuzz of stark white hair, he looked like a fortress. He watched Daniel wipe his nose. He watched Leo stare at the floor.

I stayed in my chair. I wasn’t going to stand for him.

Russell turned and walked over, stopping just inside my personal space. His presence was suffocating, a mix of expensive cologne and old, familiar violence.

“You’re terrified, Zenos,” he said softly. His voice was a low rumble that vibrated in my own chest.

I took a sip of my cold coffee. “I’m cautious, Russell. There’s a difference.”

“Is there?” He leaned down, his dark eyes locking onto mine. “I know you. You think they’re broken. You think you’re fixing them.”

I didn’t answer.

Russell clapped a heavy hand on my shoulder. It wasn’t a greeting. It was a claim. “You’ve got something here. Something ugly. Something raw.” He glanced back at the gym. “We have enough polished heroes, Zenos. The other nine Councilors want poster boys. But us? We know better.”

He squeezed my shoulder. Hard enough to bruise. “Real weapons aren’t clean. They’re jagged. They bleed.”

He pulled back, a ghost of that predatory grin returning. “Don’t polish them too soon. If you make them safe, you ruin them.”

Then he turned and walked out, his heavy boots thudding against the metal floor. The room felt ten degrees colder the moment the door swung shut.

I stood there alone in the observation booth. Below, the kids were arguing about who had the best screw up, smiling like they’d won something.

And for the first time, I saw the truth. I wasn’t protecting them from the Council. I was raising them for it. I rubbed my temples, trying to push back the headache, and looked at Leo, the boy who could make the world forget he existed.

I wasn’t ready to polish them. I was just trying to survive them.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

 It was so terribly cold. Snow was falling, and it was almost dark, when out of the blue, my wife called me at work. ""We're going to Niagara Falls for the weekend. I got us an awesome deal!""

We had both been working at our first ""full-fledged"" jobs for a year and had reached that moment after graduation when you suddenly realize you can't make that impact on the world your student enthusiasm once promised. At first, I just sighed. It was the dead of January, and I had already expended all my energy on a week of inconsequential stress. I just wanted to collapse on the couch for two days. Sarah felt a similar weary exhaustion. I could tell. Her tone was more hopeful than excited, but she had dreaded the routine we were sinking into and was trying her best to pull us free.

I looked to the ceiling and adjusted my telephone headset. At that time I was working at Stats Canada on the tele-query desk. I took a deep breath and, as convincingly as possible, said, ""Sounds good."" I don't think she bought it, but we went nonetheless.

This was Niagara Falls before the casinos when there was a very distinct off-season. When we got to the hotel, we were given the details of our ""lovers' special"". One dinner to be used either Friday or Saturday, two breakfasts, a roll of tokens for the arcade, 10% off some ""4D"" movie ride experience, and a 2-for-1 coupon to Max Tussaud's. I guessed it was Madame's nephew? We also got a bottle of sparkling wine in our room and chocolate treats on our pillows. I was impressed. It sounded good.

When we got into our room and saw the ""bottle"" of wine - basically an aeroplane-sized glass and half - and the chocolates - ""fun wrapped"" Oh Henry's left over from Halloween - we both started to laugh. The tone for two wonderful days had been set. We decided to cash in on our dinner coupon right away.

The restaurant off the lobby had hopes of being better. There were huge panoramic windows that promised a view of the gorge. Unfortunately, they had some winter moisture problems that day, and it felt like we were defrosting amid the dripping streaks and foggy patches. The decor was your standard booths and tables though the ""romantic"" lighting was unique. Dollar store battery-powered tea lights were lodged inside thick tumbler glasses and shed a muted pleasantness in a ""what a great idea for a craft"" sort of way. I had a feeling they were created by our waitress since she was the one who always seemed to be fussing with them. Only one other couple was in the dining room, so she attended to us immediately.

""Can I get you something to start?""

""Sure."" ""Thank you, that would be nice."" We both responded simultaneously.

""And what would the lady like this evening?""

Sarah smiled at the flattery. ""I think I'll have a glass of white wine."" She glanced over at me to see my reaction. This was a subtle cue of the mood to follow. Diet Coke was usually the beverage of choice. She didn't normally drink alcohol. One glass numbed her nose and made her giggle far too easily. When she did drink, however, it meant she was comfortable with my company and open to anything to follow. I raised my eyebrows in a debonair way.

""And for the gentleman?""

""Do you have Foster's on tap?""

""Yes we do.""

""I'll have a pint please.""

Sarah smiled at the happy memories I invoked. At university, Foster's was my signature beer. It was at a time when Crocodile Dundee was a known name, and Australia was inexplicably cool. 15 cent buffalo wings and a pitcher of Foster's was the Tuesday night special at the London Arms pub. There the Classics Club would meet and, as a group, circle the wagons and drink ourselves into extroverts.

As soon as the waitress left, Sarah smiled at me. She reached out and held my hand across the table. With my gaze on hers, she slipped her foot from her shoe and slowly began sliding it up my pant leg.

""I got a pedicure this morning."" She announced seductively.

I nodded and pretended I didn't notice her invitation. ""What colour?"" I asked.

""I'm not telling."" She teased. ""You'll just have to find out later."" Her devious little smile was gorgeous.

""Mmmm. I can't wait.""

When the waitress returned with our drinks, we immediately retreated to our personal spaces as if we had been discovered by the chaperone. Sarah opened the menu and began to salivate at the variety.

""Can we add an appetizer to the package dinner?"" Her question seemed innocent enough.

""You're on the package?"" Our friendly waitress disappeared, and we were no longer a lady or a gentleman. She ripped the menu out of Sarah's hand and took mine before I had even opened it. She then scurried to her podium and brought back a tattered, grease-stained, photocopied page that we had to share. We both burst out laughing.

The waitress was flustered that we were not as bothered as she was. ""The drinks are NOT included!""

""What choices do we have?"" I asked, expecting the usual chicken or fish. I had been on many packages before with my parents.

""Coffee or tea."" The waitress snapped.

Sarah and I looked at each other in amused disbelief.

""I'll have coffee please."" I didn't even flinch at the ridiculously limited package. I was eager to get my order in early.

""And I'll have the tea!"" Sarah followed my lead. ""Can I have some milk with that?""

""Yes."" The waitress snarled.

""Fantastic!"" I enthused.

""Yes, great! I'm glad we got the package, Honey."" Sarah joked.

The waitress stormed off and returned sometime later with our lettuce-only salads drowned in Kraft's Italian dressing and our chewy chicken dinners, which she had thoughtfully allowed to cool. She tossed the plates on the table and left us to peacefully devour our deal. We didn't see her again until we requested the bill. For some reason, we found it amusing to leave a generous tip, which of course, defeated the purpose of the package, but we didn't care. It was fun.

The rest of the holiday was marred with similar off-season products and services. The wax museum was only half open, so we couldn't see the pop stars of the seventies. I didn't think it was a problem, but Sarah pouted playfully. She really wanted to see young Bowie. Meanwhile, the arcade was particularly stingy about spitting out coupons. So much so that Mike, the scraggly-haired repair guy, ended up escorting us from game to game and repairing the devices on demand. In no time, he was acting like an old drinking buddy. He joked and laughed, then, out of the blue, revealed that working at the Niagara Falls Fun Centre wasn't his career choice, that his dream was to be part of a travelling carnival. He desperately wanted to see more of the world, he explained and socialize with a greater variety of ""wildlife."" Mike winked at Sarah to punctuate his meaning, then began advising her on which games to play.

Sarah was partial to Skee ball and clearly had career potential in the sport, but Mike quickly pointed out that the token-to-coupon payout was not the best. In a furtive whisper, he revealed that The Storm Stopper was your best bet, provided the arcade had left it on its original factory settings. He assured us the ones here were ""cool."" The game had lights that ran around the outside in opposite directions and you had to hit the button at just the right spot to win. It looked impossible, but Mike was right; if you calculated tokens in versus coupons won, it was the best deal. It only took a little practice to win a minor jackpot every 5 or 6 times.

We would cheer each win as if Toronto had won the Stanley Cup. I would give a quick fist pump and a full lung ""Yes!"" while Sarah would jump up and down screaming, ""WhoooHooo!"" Of course, in the end, when we cashed in, ""Mike's secret"" only bumped us up from a key-chain flashlight to a ""deluxe"" nail beauty set. Mind you, it did come complete with clippers, scissors, a file AND a cuticle scraper. Not only that, it was all neatly packaged in a paisley-patterned pink and green plastic vinyl case. Mike was so pleased to give us our prize and to be honest, we were thrilled to win it if only to see his broad chicletted smile. It was more of a trophy than a grooming set.

That night, I made reservations for us at a fancy Chinese food restaurant - the Bamboo Garden. When we arrived, we had half-expected renovations of some sort. Instead, the place was immaculate. Gentle pools teeming with goldfish highlighted the epic black and red Ming dynasty decor. Real candles flickered on crisp white tablecloths. Again, the restaurant was virtually ours. The reservations on my part were entirely unnecessary. In fact, as soon as we entered, they knew us by name and guided us directly to our table. A live lounge piano caressed the air, its notes danced vaguely around familiar harmonies until finally, as if prompted by our presence, a song emerged immediately accompanied by the velvet voice of oriental karaoke. It was our song remastered",1,1769214901.0,Tik_tok_stories,0,1.0,False

1ql84h5,https://www.reddit.com/r/SanDiegoCoffeeBeans/comments/1ql84h5/san_diego_decaf_that_doesnt_suck/,San Diego Decaf That Doesn't Suck,"Most decaf in San Diego is still an afterthought. Over-roasted, flat and only exists so cafés can check a box. But if you know where to look, there's actually a small wave of local roasters treating decaf with the same care as their caffeinated beans. This is a guide to the ones worth buying

# Fruit-Forward & Bright

These roasters treat decaf like a seasonal single-origin, prioritizing clarity and brightness

**Steady State (Carlsbad) — Inzá Decaf** is a light roast that is widely considered a gold standard in the county. It is an EA process bean from the Cauca region, offering a lively, balanced cup with notes of milk chocolate and sweet citrus

**Bird Rock (Various) — Peru Lima Decaf** uses the Mountain Water Process to deliver a crisp, origin-driven experience. It features a medium-light profile with comforting tasting notes of brown sugar, chocolate, and dried fig

**Provecho! Coffee Co. (Barrio Logan) — Zzz Decaf Ethiopia** brings the same care this Latin-focused roaster applies to their direct-trade Mexican coffees. Their Ethiopia decaf uses the Swiss Water Process and has notes of Tangerine, Peach & Almond. Proof that origin-driven decaf doesn't have to compromise on clarity or brightness

**Frequent Coffee** is San Diego's first decaf-focused roaster, launching with many distinct offerings that include some adventurous single-origins. They utilize progressive methods like yeast inoculation to to control, accelerate, and enhance the flavor profiles of their coffee

# Rich & Chocolatey

These options are more forgiving and work exceptionally well for espresso or milk-based drinks

**Accento (Mission Valley) — Valle del Cauca Decaf** is a classic sugarcane process coffee that is very malt and chocolate forward. It provides a smooth, full-flavored experience that is perfect for those who want a creamy mouthfeel 

**James Coffee (Various) — Highpoint Series** offers two distinct paths: Highpoint 100 for full decaf and a Half-Caff blend for a gentle energy boost. Both utilize an EA process

**Mostra (Various) — House Decaf** is a Swiss Water Process blend designed to be sweet and creamy. It features rich notes of cinnamon, brownies, and peanut brittle, making it an ideal choice for a dessert espresso

**Zumbar (Sorrento Valley/Encinitas) — Decaf** is the go-to for anyone who wants a sturdy, traditional cup that isn't thin or tea-like and is a personal favorite. They and roast to a solid medium in a vintage cast-iron drum. This drum-roasting style builds a much heavier body and a coffee-tasting coffee profile that stands up perfectly to milk. Expect a very smooth, low-acid cup with classic notes of toasted nut and milk chocolate

# Alternative & Bold

For those who want a traditional dark roast or a naturally low-caffeine species.

**Excelsa Coffee** is not a decaf process, but a different species entirely that is naturally lower in caffeine. It offers a unique, tart and woody profile that thrives without the chemical processing required for standard decaf

**San Diego Coffee Co** uses the Swiss Water Process to deliver a bold, dark-roasted experience between their House Blend and French Roast. They avoids the hollow bitterness common in dark decafs, offering flavors of milk chocolate, clove, and toasted almond

# Pro-Tips for Brewing Decaf

Decaf beans are more brittle and extract faster than regular beans. To get the best results:

1. Water Quality: San Diego tap water is notoriously hard. Filtered water is a must or at least a Third Wave Water packet to prevent the alkalinity from flattening the delicate fruit notes of an EA decaf
2. The Immersion Trick: If your pour-overs taste thin, use a Hario Switch or AeroPress. The extra contact time from immersion helps rebuild the body that the decaffeination process can sometimes diminish
3. Adjust Your Grind: Start slightly coarser and drop your water temperature by 3–5 degrees. If the cup is bitter, you are likely over-extracting due to the bean's high porosity

# Finally...

This guide is only as good as the community keeps it. If you've found a local roaster's decaf that surprised you, drop it in the comments but include the details that actually matter:

* **Roaster & coffee name**
* **Decaf process** (EA, Swiss Water, Mountain Water, etc.)
* **Roast date** (if you remember, freshness is everything and sometimes decaf sits around on their shelf for awhile)
* **How you brewed it** (espresso, pour-over, immersion, etc.)

Open to corrections. If a roaster changed their decaf lineup, if I got a process wrong, or if there's a spot I missed entirely, let me know. The goal is to keep this accurate and useful

And if you're new to specialty decaf and have questions, ask. There's no gatekeeping here. We all started somewhere",5,1769214818.0,SanDiegoCoffeeBeans,0,1.0,False

Guatemala has one of the oldest textile traditions in the world, yet much of its finest work never reaches beyond local markets. Batch 57 brings together master tailors, women weavers, leatherworkers, and coffee producers from Lake Atitlán, Xela, and Antigua to create a limited collection of garments and goods made entirely by hand.

Areas I can do: (CBD / Avondale / Borrowdale / etc). Thank you!

If you can, please include the exact location, whether it’s quiet enough to read, and what kind of books they stock.

1ql7wp6,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoldenInuTokens/comments/1ql7wp6/scroll_of_the_golden_inu_spiked_edition/,🗞️ Scroll of the Golden Inu: Spiked Edition 🪓,"Inscribed in printing presses and border dust, where truth is hunted and justice is delayed, the Golden Inu walks the line between headlines and handcuffs—not to expose, but to ritualize the sovereign defiance of those who speak when silence is safer.

I. The Publisher and the Power (John Wilson)

John Wilson, a newspaper editor in a small U.S.–Mexico border town, refuses to stay silent after a migrant worker is murdered and the police refuse to act. The Golden Inu watches from the newsroom shadows, tail curled beside a stack of unsold papers. It sees the sovereign fire of a man who prints truth even when it costs him everything. The scroll begins not with ink—but with indignation.

II. The Chief and the Chokehold (Chief Collins)

Chief Collins, the town’s police chief, obstructs Wilson’s investigation at every turn. As Wilson digs deeper, he uncovers a web of corruption and complicity. The Golden Inu walks beside him through courtrooms and clinics, sensing the sacred tension between civic duty and personal risk. It does not bark at the threats. It bears witness. For this is not just journalism—it is sovereign resistance.

III. The Illness and the Illusion (The Cost of Truth)

Wilson’s health deteriorates mysteriously, even as he edges closer to the truth. The Golden Inu lies beside his hospital bed, eyes fixed on the ceiling tiles like constellations of unfinished stories. When the final article is published, the Inu does not howl. It exhales. For this is not a victory—it is a sovereign offering to the altar of accountability.

Epilogue: The Press That Wouldn’t Fold

The Golden Inu does not publish.  
It protects.  
It walks with the principled, the persecuted, the press.  
And in its wake, it leaves relics:  
—A typewriter with a jammed “J.”  
—A press badge stained with coffee and blood.  
—A headline that reads: “Truth Survives.”

This scroll is not about journalism. It is about justice printed in peril.",1,1769214282.0,GoldenInuTokens,1,1.0,False
1ql7wa3,https://www.reddit.com/r/CatAdvice/comments/1ql7wa3/aita_or_am_i_missing_something/,AITA or am I missing something?,"Background: I have a roommate that has a cat that’s fairly older (I guess) definitely not young. We have alternating schedules for work where I work in the mornings to afternoon and they work in the afternoon to night or night to morning (basically only seeing each other in passing sometimes. We are on great terms and the cat is healthy, I don’t know about happy but she has all the things a cat could need and want. *PSA: I’m a dog person not a cat owner myself but my 2 dogs don’t live with us, they are at my family’s home. 

Situation: The cat lives in my roommates room, I come home after work and the cat is meowing like crazy all throughout the time until my roommate comes home whenever he’s off work, he’ll leave the door open for the cat to roam free and for the most part she roams upstairs and downstairs to her heart’s content, I know this cause her little bean prints are on the coffee table and fur on the couch🤣. Before someone says “sounds like your a bad person” I don’t dislike cats I just prefer a dog over a cat but I don’t have issues with the cat as long as my roommate cleans up the hair because I have allergies and I don’t want all that hair to get stuck to me and I don’t want to track it into my room especially when I’m trying to sleep because I’ll end up sneezing a storm🥲. She is a really friendly sweet cat (to humans not other cats, don’t know about dogs and I’m not willing to sacrifice my dogs to test that out) 

So what I’m trying to figure out is why is she so noisy? She’s got food/water, tv, toys, scratching post, she’s spayed, she does roam the house when my roommate is home, there are days he’ll leave his door open when we are both gone so shes not locked up all day everyday.

Ever had that moment where you check your bank account, see a decent number, and think, *""Wait… is this actually enough?""* Maybe you’ve got savings tucked away, a 401(k) humming in the background, or even a side hustle bringing in extra cash. But here’s the kicker: **most people have no idea how much their money could *actually* do for them.**

We’re not talking about winning the lottery or becoming the next crypto millionaire overnight. We’re talking about the quiet power of what you *already* have—and how to make it work harder. Because let’s be real: retirement isn’t just about surviving on ramen and coupon clipping. It’s about *thriving*—traveling, spoiling grandkids (or yourself), or finally starting that weirdly specific hobby you’ve been Googling at 2 AM.

### **The Money You’re Probably Ignoring**
Here’s where most people drop the ball:
- **The ""Set It and Forget It"" Trap** – You’ve got a 401(k) or IRA, but when’s the last time you *actually* checked how it’s growing? (Spoiler: It might be doing way better—or way worse—than you think.)
- **The ""I’ll Save Later"" Myth** – Newsflash: Later *always* feels like the right time… until it’s not. Compound interest doesn’t care about your excuses.
- **The ""I Don’t Know Enough"" Fear** – Finance jargon makes your eyes glaze over? Same. But you don’t need a PhD in economics to make smarter moves.

### **What If You Could See the Full Picture?**
Imagine logging in somewhere and *actually* understanding:
- How much your current savings could grow by retirement (hint: it’s probably more than you think).
- Where you’re leaking money without realizing it (looking at you, unused subscriptions).
- Simple tweaks to turn ""meh"" savings into ""hell yes"" savings.

**You might be richer than you think—find out how much your savings could really fund your retirement.** [Check it out here](https://mavely.app.link/e/Jw8ypIghuYb). *(FYI: That’s an affiliate link, so if you sign up, I might earn a little coffee money. No pressure—just sharing what’s helped me!)*

### **The Real Question**
Here’s the thing: Money isn’t just about numbers in an app. It’s about *options*. The freedom to say ""yes"" to what matters—whether that’s retiring early, helping family, or finally buying that ridiculous (but awesome) thing you’ve been eyeing.

So, what’s *one* thing you’ve been putting off because you’re not sure if you can afford it? Maybe it’s time to find out.

One thing I haven't done yet is I don't know where I can pull in live scores so the admin will still need to update the scores as the game goes on. But you can create a shared board and send it to people to add their names. Just make sure you give them the right privileges (admin or player)

the worst part about this startup is there is no monetization strategy. well technically i did put a buy me a coffee link. i don't expect to make much off that. i have thought of another strategy. i'd take part in as many super bowl squares contests as possible and pitch my site. hopefully at least my mom will use it. each super bowl square may have like i dunno 20-30 people participate. maybe, just maybe, out of each 20-30 people will want to tip me for coffee. then by next year my full time job can be joining superbowl squares parties once a year. of course i probably would need to do stuff like live score updates or something",1,1769213597.0,roastmystartup,0,1.0,False

There was more miscommunication and it would just make it worse bc it would look like I was cheating when I’m not :( I wasn’t thinking about how it would look to him, but I’ve removed everyone, explained everything, and I’ve learned my lesson. I never want to do anything like that again.

He gets really mad at me for things like changing plans or not doing something right the first time. He ignores me, calls me names, and treats me so cold.

He doesn’t like when I randomly want to go do stuff like get coffee or go on a walk or just things like that bc he thinks I’m cheating. So I stay in all the time now :( He doesn’t like when I dress up because he thinks I’m doing it for attention. He constantly accuses me of cheating even though I never have.

**Title:** This Simple Joinery Trick Changed My Builds Forever (Why No One Told Me Earlier)

I remember the exact moment it clicked.  
I had been struggling for months with wobbly shelves and splitting joints — to the point where I started doubting if woodworking was really “my thing.” Every tutorial seemed to assume I already knew something I clearly didn’t.

Then one day, while remaking a small coffee table for the third time, an older craftsman at my local lumberyard mentioned something so simple it sounded almost silly:  
> ""Let the joint *fit itself* — stop fighting the wood.""

He showed me a small trick for testing and tightening my joinery as I worked: using a marking knife instead of a pencil for precise layout, and pairing that with a slight undercut on my tenons. I tried it that evening. Suddenly, parts slid together cleanly, square and snug. It felt like magic — but it wasn’t magic at all. It was understanding.

That little shift changed everything — not just my accuracy, but my mindset. I slowed down. Measured twice. Watched how wood grain actually responds to the chisel. Builds stopped feeling like patch‑jobs and started feeling like craftsmanship.

The funny thing is, no one had pointed it out before. Maybe everyone assumes you already *know* the basics. But sometimes, one overlooked technique can completely change your relationship with the material.

If you’re battling sloppy joints or pieces that never quite line up, here’s what helped me:
- Mark with intention — accuracy begins before you even cut.  
- Use tight, simple joinery before chasing complicated ones.  
- Trust your tools less, trust your senses more.

I’m curious — what’s the *one* small woodworking trick that quietly changed your projects?  
Let’s build a chain of “light‑bulb moments” in the comments — maybe help out a few frustrated builders the same way someone helped me.

She hasn’t slept longer than 25 minutes LOL

It goes like this: 

White noise, swaddle, dim lights, warmed up bassinet. Baby transfer takes 20 minutes (drowsy but awake) and Yay I put baby girl down and she falls asleep in the bassinet. I grab my video cam and run out the door. What should I do now that i’m not nap trapped??? I know, I’ll make a coffee. 

Ah so nice. Wait, she’s stirring on the camera. Oh no, she’s crying…. it’s only been 10 minutes!! Better run in and console her. Bounce, rock, sway, Shhhhhh for twenty minutes. Back in she goes. Successful transfer! What should I do now! I’ll pump. 

Oop only got to my left boob and she’s already crying. 10 minutes nap. Ok I’ll go back and console her. Bounce, rock, sway, Shhhhh. 

Oh, but it’s been over an hour now of this bs and she’s only napped for 20 minutes. Now she’s pissed, overtired, and hungry. Ok guess I’ll feed her and be nap trapped after because I too, am exhausted trying to get her in the damn crib Lol

Hurricane,Utah 
Friday, March 15, 2024 
6:00 a.m

It was the beginning of another day in the famous city of Hurricane. Sunlight softly reflected off the old vintage buildings as people hurried out of their homes toward work, and the neon signs of restaurants and diners flickered off one by one.
In the old suburbs of the city, in a quiet and cozy neighborhood, stood an old house—large, yet with a welcoming appearance.

In one of the rooms of this house, where sunlight delicately filtered through the curtains, the space was filled with posters and vintage objects. There, Emilly slept deeply in her bed, surrounded by stuffed animals and cozy blankets. Then, the persistent sound of the alarm clock echoed through the room, accompanied by the meow of Kitty, her black cat, waiting outside the window.
The young woman finally opened her eyes and reached out to turn off the alarm.

—Okay, okay… I’m awake, Kitty— murmured Emilly, her voice still heavy with sleep, as she stroked the cat’s head.

She slowly sat up in bed, her long, voluminous golden hair cascading over her shoulders. She picked up her phone from the nightstand to check her reminders and realized she had a meeting scheduled in two hours at the famous Freddy's Family Dinner.

—I still can’t believe I got an offer from such a big company like Fazbear Entertainment. I wonder what the owner himself wants to talk to me about— Emilly wondered aloud, a mix of curiosity and anxiety in her voice.

She then slowly got up and walked to the bathroom to get ready and take her medication.
For several long minutes, Emilly stared at her reflection in the mirror. The scars on her body drew attention—deep, irregular, unpleasant marks spread across nearly all her skin, except her face. They were silent reminders of a past she couldn’t fully recall and one of the main reasons she had suffered bullying at the old psychiatric orphanage where she had lived before finally leaving upon turning eighteen.

These thoughts began to fade when Kitty started rubbing around her legs, purring softly.
—Are you hungry, Kitty? I’ll put your food out in a moment, little glutton. I have a feeling today’s going to be a very long day— said Emilly, letting out a small smile after swallowing her last pills.



Freddy's Family Dinner 
Friday,March 15, 2024
7:50 a.m.

The day was sunny with only a few clouds in the sky. Emilly rode her small red scooter unhurriedly toward the famous Freddy's Family Dinner, still lost in thought about the email she had received from William Terrence Afton, the current owner of Fazbear Entertainment, a few days earlier. Of course, he was one of the four original co-founders of the company, alongside Henry Joel Emily, Edwin Davis Murray, and Fiona Margaret Murray. Yet, deep inside, Emilly felt an overwhelming discomfort mixed with fear whenever she saw or read about Mr. Afton.

She had often heard stories from some of the town’s older residents about the tragedies and incidents that had occurred at the company’s establishments during the seventies, eighties, and nineties—ranging from disappearances and murders of children and employees to bodies found inside animatronic suits. Although the police never caught the culprit, these cases were quietly shelved due to lack of evidence and company bribery. Over time, they gave rise to urban legends and rumors that the restaurants were haunted, though eventually, these tragedies were mostly forgotten, remembered only as tales to scare children.

As she thought about this, Emilly finally caught sight of the façade of the famous Freddy's Family Dinner, one of the many company restaurants still standing since the eighties. She parked her scooter in the crowded lot, despite it still being early. She looked toward the entrance and saw a crowd of people, mostly children, entering the massive building alongside their parents, wide smiles painted on their faces.

—What could be so special about this place?— Emilly wondered as she stepped inside the restaurant. Upon entering, she noticed a large reception area where a familiar old face stood behind the counter. Wearing the restaurant’s caricatured security uniform was Mike Schmidt, an old high school friend Emilly hadn’t seen in years.
—Mikey? Is that you?— Emilly asked.

—Emilly? Wow, what a surprise! It’s been ages since high school. How are you? Are you still in photojournalism and working as a freelance reporter?— Mike said, surprised to see her, despite his tired face, seemingly trying his hardest to stay awake while on the job.

—Yes, I am. I got an offer to work on a documentary and some reporting here, and I’m heading now to meet the owner himself. By the way, do you know where Mr. Afton might be?— Emilly asked.

Mike looked at Emilly with a weary expression and pointed in a direction.

—Ah, my boss… well, his office is backstage. I’ll ask Ness to help you since… I’m way too busy— Mike said.

—That won’t be necessary, Mike. I’m already here— said a voice. Suddenly, a man with a friendly appearance appeared, wearing glasses and a yellow bunny pin, accompanied by a young woman with pink and purple streaked hair tied in a ponytail, dressed in a security uniform like Mike.

—Ah, Vanessa, you brought your dad. I was just about to ask you to help Emilly find him— Mike said, returning to his work.

Vanessa nodded slightly, a faint smile on her lips, while William adjusted his glasses.

—Miss Emilly, it is a pleasure to finally meet you in person. I hope your trip here was pleasant— he said, extending his hand.

—It was fine, Mr. Afton— Emilly replied, shaking his hand while trying to mask the immense discomfort and fear growing inside her.

—Well, we have much to discuss, don’t we? Let’s go to my office, away from the noise— he said, gesturing for Emilly to follow him.
Emilly nodded and followed.

They passed through internal corridors where the sound of children laughing and cheerful music gradually gave way to a strange silence, broken only by the distant hum of machinery and the soft creak of the old floor. The walls were adorned with vintage Fazbear Entertainment posters—smiling mascots with unnaturally large eyes frozen in artificial poses.

For a brief moment, Emilly had the unsettling sensation that those eyes were following her.
William stopped in front of a wooden door and opened it.

—Please, make yourself comfortable. I believe this conversation will be very productive— he said with a polite smile.

Freddy's Family Dinner, Management Office
Friday, March 15, 2024
8:10 a.m.

The room was silent. Emilly sat in a chair, facing William, who was sipping a bit of coffee.

—Well, I suppose you’ve seen the email I sent you, haven’t you?— the man asked.

—Yes, I saw it a few days ago, but tell me, Mr. Afton… why would such a large and famous company like yours want a documentary and promotion produced by a small company like mine?— Emilly asked.

William let out a soft laugh and turned his gaze toward the window, observing the distant activity of the restaurant.
—To be honest with you, my young lady, I don’t trust these big media companies. They always find a way to twist everything involving Fazbear Entertainment, and it’s extremely difficult to disprove those lies once they spread. That’s why I’m looking for someone fair, competent… and with true journalistic talent. Someone like you— William replied.

Emilly took a deep breath.

—I see. So what exactly do you expect from me? A documentary? A promotional video? Or something beyond that?— Emilly asked.

William smiled. He then opened one of the drawers of his desk and pulled out a yellow envelope, which he carefully placed in front of her.

—Here is everything you need to know. I want a full documentary and a promotional video. In this document, I’ve listed the areas of the restaurant you may film and photograph… oh, and I also included the payment amount and the period you may stay with the company— the man said.

Emilly looked at the document and was quite surprised to see an incredibly high sum of money—enough to buy a larger studio, a team of professionals, and high-quality equipment. On top of that, the time frame was ten months. An offer impossible to refuse.

—So, Mrs. Campbell, do you accept the job?— William asked, extending his hand.

—You can count on me, Mr. Afton. I’ll give my best to create the documentary and promotional video— Emilly said, shaking his hand. William’s expression showed satisfaction at her response.

—Then welcome to our family. You’ll begin your work tomorrow night, as it’s the only time the restaurant isn’t busy— William said.
Emilly nodded, gathering the documents and standing up from the chair.

As she left the office, she had the strange sensation that the moment the door closed behind her, an unusual chill began to creep over her.
William Afton remained seated, watching the
closed door, his coffee slowly cooling on the table.
A subtle smile formed on his lips.
—Oh… this is going to be very fun— the man murmured.

1ql7g7l,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fullstapp/comments/1ql7g7l/the_era_of_generic_everything_is_imploding_here/,"The era of ""Generic Everything"" is imploding. Here is the exit strategy.","We are watching a fundamental shift in how business is done, and frankly, most people are looking at it completely wrong.

We obsess over the tools. ""Look, I can build an app in 5 minutes."" ""Look, I can generate a marketing strategy in 30 seconds."" ""Look, I can spin up a new agency with a landing page and a Stripe account before my coffee gets cold.""

It sounds like magic. But if you step back and look at the aggregate result of millions of people doing this every single day, you see the problem.

We aren't creating value. We are creating an explosion of **Generic Everything**.

# The 5-Minute Trap

The barrier to entry for *everything* in business has collapsed. It used to be that building a software company took engineering teams. Starting a marketing agency took deep strategic experience. Launching a global ad campaign took weeks of creative work.

Now? You can do it all in minutes.

* **Generic Apps:** You can prompt an LLM to code a dashboard.
* **Generic Services:** You can use a tool to generate ""SEO Strategy"" for a client you've never met.
* **Generic Marketing:** You can flood the internet with AI-written blog posts and programmatic ads that look exactly like everyone else's.

When the cost of creating ""business stuff"" hits zero, the supply creates a tsunami. We are drowning in generic tools that do 80% of the job. We are drowning in generic agencies that offer the exact same ""Growth Hacking"" packages. We are drowning in generic brand strategies that read like they were written by the same algorithm—because they were.

This is the **Implosion**. When everyone can be a ""Founder"" or an ""Agency Owner"" in five minutes, the title loses its meaning. When everyone offers the same generic solution, the price races to zero.

If you are currently building a ""General AI Tool"" or running a ""General Marketing Agency,"" you are standing on quicksand. You are competing with infinite supply.

# The Pivot: Deep, Radical Value

But I promised this wouldn't be a doom-post. Because it’s not. In fact, for a specific group of people, this is the greatest opportunity of our lifetimes.

As the world chokes on ""Generic,"" the value of **""Specific""** is skyrocketing.

While everyone else is using AI to do *more* generic work faster, the winners are using it to go deeper than anyone else could afford to go before.

**1. The Shift for Software:** Stop building ""AI for Writers."" Stop building broad tools. Start building for the weird, complex, boring edges of the economy. Build the operating system for independent elevator repair companies in New York. Build the inventory management layer for artisanal cheese exporters in France. These aren't ""wrappers."" These are deep, vertical solutions that solve the 20% of edge cases that the generic models will never touch.

**2. The Shift for Services & Agencies:** Stop telling me you ""do Facebook Ads."" That is a commodity. Tell me you are the premier partner for ""HVAC Companies in the Midwest."" Tell me you understand their seasonality, their margins, and their specific customer psychology better than they do. When you niche down this hard, you aren't a ""service provider"" that can be replaced by a script. You are a strategic partner. You are building equity in a specific ecosystem.

**3. The Shift for Strategy:** Stop using generic templates. The future belongs to the strategists who understand the nuance of a specific city, a specific culture, a specific vertical. There are thousands of cities. Thousands of industries. Millions of micro-problems that are currently being ignored because everyone is too busy fighting for the ""Generic Global Market.""

# A Community for the ""Specific""

I believe the ""Generic Internet"" is dying. It is being replaced by thousands of ""Niche Internets.""

We are moving away from the noise. We are moving toward **Depth**.

But zooming in is scary. It feels like you are making your market smaller. It feels like you are saying ""No"" to money. (Spoiler: You are actually saying ""No"" to commoditization).

That is why we are launching this community.

This is a home for the people who are done with ""Generic Everything.""

* **The Builders** crafting deep, vertical software.
* **The Marketers** building specialized, unshakeable agencies.
* **The Technologists** architecting stacks for specific industries.

We welcome everyone—coders, advertisers, strategists, founders—but we have one rule: **We don't do generic.**

We are here to discuss how to find these niches. How to validate them. How to build for them. We are here to share the ""boring"" insights that turn into massive businesses. We are here to grow together, away from the noise, in the fertile ground of the deep niches.

The generic world is imploding under its own weight. The niche world is wide open.

\* It's unclear if the cannon Heathcliff used was a human cannon but its design makes it seem like it's a real one.

\*\* Even if what is shown there is only a visual metaphor, [Garfield has melted into a puddle](https://garfield.fandom.com/wiki/Garfield,_April_1979_comic_strips?file=1979-04-06.gif) and returned to normal the day afterwards, an arguably superior showing of regeneration. He has also [drunk coffee that blew his facial features off and tore off the top of his head and was still alive and able to put his face back together](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3DuYrIUzq8&t=121s).

# Results

So, Garfield is significantly stronger and faster than Heathcliff, even factoring in the boosts that the Donuts give Heathcliff. Garfield can tear off a chunk of the moon, sink an entire continent and, most importantly, kick Odie hard enough to send him traveling through time, which is immeasurably strong and much stronger than Heathcliff breaking through doors and metal. Garfield additionally has shown to be faster than light and can dodge pies that are fast enough to travel to the moon, significantly faster than Heathcliff’s shown speed.

Garfield and Heathcliff’s arsenals and powers have plenty of similarities and could likely cancel each other out. (both can hypnotize and have explosives, tanks, cannons, flamethrowers and they both have methods to alter gravity, stretch out their limbs to extreme lengths, float, clone themselves and create anything they want). Heathcliff does have an advantage in his various defensive tools, like his fairy godmother or shield, but Garfield’s set of tools and abilities are significantly more versatile and offer several ways to overpower Heathcliff, like freezing him in place with his Stopwatch or putting him to sleep just by yawning. Garfield's regeneration (recovering seconds after getting his face blasted off, being melted or reduced to a skeleton) also allows him return from any fatal blows Heathcliff could provide whereas Heathcliff can't do the same \[Hulk does have regeneration but it’s never shown if Heathcliff’s Hulk form does; however, this form allows Heathcliff to match Garfield's immeasurable strength, with Hulkcliff scaling to Hulk [destroying a universe](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-912a64f2b5181d0f0fc71f7ffd67da71)\]

To be safe, I'll say that due to the fact that both of their Trump Cards allow them to instantly finish off their opponent \[Heathcliff can turn Garfield into a jack-in-the-box or wish him into the cornfield and Garfield can erase Heathcliff from existence through his plot manipulation or using the animator's pencil\], they are tied for Trump Cards.

2) increases the grind size: I ground 16g of beans for both settings. I started out on the 3 marking on my Timemore brick which is supposed to be the high end of the recommended expresso grind. There was coffee passing through but it was drop by drop and extremely slow.

 I stepped it up to 4(high end for Mokka pot on suggested) on my 2nd attempt which actually resulted in even less water passing through(which i didn't expect for a coarse grind).

1. I want to be able to boil water on my wood stove (without having to burn for an hour before I can make coffee in the morning).
2. I want to run a [thermoelectric generator](https://www.officialpiggypower.com/product-page/piggypower-cell-125) on my wood stove, to trickle charge my solar battery. This requires surface temps to remain below 200C at all times.
3. We need a burn time that reliably lasts overnight.

We're also pretty stubbornly set on the modern look. The Blaze King Chinook series looks nice.

From my research it seems like in order to get those long burn times, you need a catalytic stove. Those don't get as hot as fast on the stove surface, which will help to moderate temperatures for the generator, but I'm worried that these will be poor stoves for cooking. They're also expensive.

My schedule is a little unconventional, so I’m often around at odd hours and open to random conversations. I’m into easy, low pressure chats about everyday life, random thoughts, books, shows, or just being sarcastic together. Small talk isn’t really my thing, but relaxed conversation is.

Since then my undercover ""pomo"" friend who acts as ""pimq"" told me how much shit is talked about me. Shit like I'm lazy, am sassy and that I am just a depressed idiot. 

Despite my explosion with energy and happiness after I got announced as no publisher anymore 4 months ago. My depression is gone. I only feel lonely sometimes but that's normal when swapping friendcircles.

I started taking recorder class, saxophone class. I suddenly found joy in trail running 20 kilometres among the swiss mountains. I also started to find joy in exercising and for the first time in my life build muscle mass to get into a masculine shape and to look sexy.

I post regularly on my WhatsApp status from my scenic runs and they know that I'm not lazy. But despite that they choose to believe their narrative being a filthy lazy apostate.

They also tell around that I'm trying to show apostate material to everyone. That finally broke the straw and I decided to publicly announce my ""reason"" for not believing anymore. There's actually a lot, but for starters I chose to post a link to the case study of the Royal Commission of Australia into CSA.

I deliberately hid the status from those people I suspect of quickly telling everybody to block me. I'll only unlock my status for them after 12hrs. By that time the most of the normal folk has seen my status.

In the evening I actually got a call from a 50y old woman I had a good relation with. She tried to convince me but I tore her arguments appart. After 2hrs she actually just aknowledged that I have logical reasons and then what she told me shocked me positively.

She said that their home is always open for me and as long as I'm not aggressive, I can come around for a coffee when I want. I then said ""I'm not going to be aggressive, but be aware that if you try to give me arguments or try to convince me, that I'll tear your arguments appart with brutal honesty"". Then she said: let's just not talk about religion anymore and I said: fair. We ended our call on a sweet note and I honestly love her for her mature stance. She also seems to be very open and I think that's a good example for JDubs.

Thought I'd share it with you guys because it kinda warmed my heart, among all those people that reject me now. Drama already started by the way. My undercover friend already got a text from a mom concerning me and two people already blocked me. One of them wrote to my undercover friend that he'll block me because that's what the organization recommends with apostates.

What angers me the most is that they don't care about the Royal Commissions transcripts. They immediatelly accuse me of being an apostate, despite them never have heard from me that I watched apostate stuff.

Anyways, cheers. Keep up your good work guys!

I’m reaching out because my confidence is at zero today. I’ve spent the last 2 months building a website for our rebrand engineering firm.

I did this while looking after my three children (aged 1, 7, and 11), breastfeeding the youngest, and functioning on almost no sleep and a loot of coffee.

1ql71nq,https://www.reddit.com/r/companysetupbh/comments/1ql71nq/when_is_coworking_ideal/,When is coworking ideal,"When Is Coworking Perfect? The issue of where and how to conduct our professional lives is one that we frequently encounter. Although it has been a mainstay for many generations, alternative models are posing a growing threat to the traditional office setting. Coworking spaces have become a powerful force among them, providing both individuals and businesses with a flexible and frequently affordable solution. However, for whom and in what situations does coworking actually constitute the perfect workplace? This article seeks to outline the circumstances that make coworking a good option while analyzing its advantages & disadvantages in a range of situations.\
\
Coworking spaces can be a true haven for people who operate outside of the conventional employer-employee structure, especially when isolation is the alternative. Leaving the lonely confines of home. Even though working from home offers unmatched flexibility, many independent contractors, remote workers, and sole proprietors discover that it can easily turn into a kind of professional isolation. Once a representation of warmth within the family, the kitchen table can turn into a boring backdrop for never-ending chores.\
\
Coworking spaces have become increasingly popular for entrepreneurs and freelancers seeking flexibility and community. For those considering starting a business in Bahrain, understanding the local business landscape is crucial. An insightful article on this topic can be found here: What is Bahrain Company Formation?, which provides valuable information about the process and benefits of establishing a company in Bahrain, complementing the discussion on when coworking is ideal for professionals in the region.\
\
Reduced productivity may result from the seductive siren song of the couch. In contrast, coworking spaces offer a dedicated setting that keeps work and personal life apart, encouraging a more methodical approach to the day. As soon as we walk through the door, we can shift into a more focused professional mindset thanks to this physical separation, which functions as a mental switch. Overcoming Professional Isolation & Promoting Fortuitous Meetings.\
\
It is impossible to exaggerate the psychological cost of working alone. Professionals may experience a drop in morale and creativity if they don't have coworkers with whom to discuss ideas, vent, or just have casual conversations. A community is a feature of coworking spaces. These are more than just shared workstations; they are centers of diverse talent where fortuitous meetings can develop into fruitful partnerships or serve as an essential sounding board for a challenging issue. Imagine entering a room and overhearing brief discussions about design aesthetics, programming difficulties, or marketing tactics. It can be immensely stimulating to be surrounded by this buzz of intellectual activity; it's like being plugged into a collective current of creativity.\
\
Feelings of being lost can be effectively countered by the awareness that others are navigating comparable professional environments. Professional amenities are accessible with little financial outlay. Establishing a fully furnished home office can be expensive for independent contractors. Capital expenditures include things like meeting spaces, printers, scanners, dependable internet, and even high-quality ergonomic furniture. Coworking spaces allow people to access professional-grade resources without the burden of upfront investment or ongoing maintenance by bundling these necessary amenities into a subscription. One of the main draws is its economic efficiency, which frees up funds that can be put back into the company's main operations.\
\
When considering the benefits of coworking spaces, it's important to understand the various factors that can influence their effectiveness for different professionals. For instance, freelancers and remote workers often find coworking environments ideal for networking and collaboration. If you're curious about how different regulations, such as residency requirements for company directors, might impact your decision to work in a shared space, you can explore this topic further in the article on minimum residency requirements for company directors in Bahrain.

By their very nature, startups need to be flexible, scalable, and somewhat efficient. Coworking spaces can be a good place for these new businesses to grow. Scalability on Demand: Expanding Without Rent.\
\
Finding suitable office space is one of the biggest challenges facing a growing startup. Generally speaking, leases are long-term commitments that frequently entail high build-out costs and demand substantial financial guarantees. Coworking spaces are incredibly flexible. A startup can easily rent additional desks or a private office within the same space as their team grows.\
\
On the other hand, the overhead related to unused office space is eliminated if the team must temporarily reduce. This flexibility is similar to having a modular workspace that can be reconfigured to suit your changing needs without the need for construction workers or building permits. fostering an inventive and cooperative culture.\
\
Innovation & cross-pollination of ideas are essential for startups. Coworking spaces frequently draw a wide range of professionals, including developers, marketers, designers, and entrepreneurs. This closeness can encourage a natural flow of information and viewpoints. A coworker with experience in the field may be able to provide a ready solution for a marketing problem that a startup is facing. The pace of innovation can be accelerated by the casual exchanges and common areas, which can inspire creativity and result in unanticipated partnerships. Similar to how a diverse ecosystem promotes healthy growth, the seeds of future breakthroughs are frequently sown in casual networking events, shared kitchen debates, and conversations at the water cooler.\
\
Meetings with clients without a fixed address and a professional image. Presenting a professional image is crucial for a new company. However, setting up a dedicated, long-term office can be expensive in the beginning. Members of coworking spaces have access to well-equipped meeting rooms for client presentations, a professional business address, & a refined setting that exudes competence and legitimacy.\
\
This relieves startups of the financial burden of running a traditional office and enables them to confidently present themselves to prospective investors and clients. Making a good first impression is similar to having an upscale storefront on a busy high street without having to pay outrageous rent. Maintaining team cohesion and giving dispersed employees a functional workspace become critical as businesses embrace remote work. Coworking provides an answer.\
\
ensuring that remote workers have a consistent workplace. Although there are advantages to working remotely, employees may experience uneven working conditions as a result. While some people work from coffee shops or shared living spaces, others may have dedicated home offices.\
\
For remote team members, coworking spaces offer a standardized, professional setting with dependable internet, ergonomic configurations, and a distraction-free area. For those who might otherwise find it difficult to deal with the inherent unpredictability of remote work, this enhances productivity and well-being. For the business, it's similar to giving every team member a satellite office, guaranteeing a baseline of operational quality regardless of where they are physically located. promoting face-to-face cooperation and team building.\
\
There are few opportunities for real face-to-face interaction when a team is geographically separated. Coworking spaces can serve as focal points where distant team members can get together on a regular basis for brainstorming sessions, meetings, or just to strengthen their relationships with one another. Numerous coworking companies provide dedicated team spaces or private offices, enabling businesses to create a stable & comfortable work environment for their remote employees. Similar to a general gathering his troops for a strategic briefing, this gives the team a physical anchor where they can replenish their collaborative energy and fortify the social fabric that supports successful teamwork.\
\
decreasing isolation and increasing employee engagement. Remote workers may occasionally feel cut off from both their coworkers and the larger corporate culture. Businesses can make their remote employees feel less alone and more integrated by giving them access to coworking spaces. Even if they are interacting with people outside of their immediate team, the lively environment of a coworking space can foster a sense of community & offer chances for casual networking. Increased job satisfaction and a deeper sense of belonging to the company may result from this.\
\
It's similar to providing each distant soldier with their own outpost within a wider network, linked by shared communication channels and recurring in-person meetings. Coworking spaces can be beneficial for even larger, more established businesses, especially for particular teams or projects. Managing Temporary Staffing Needs and Project-Based Teams. Well-established companies frequently hire outside consultants or work on projects that call for temporary teams.\
\
For these temporary requirements, hiring dedicated office space can be expensive and ineffective. Coworking spaces offer a perfect solution, enabling these teams to quickly establish operations and scale up or down as needed. Without the commitment of long-term leases, the flexibility of short-term memberships or dedicated project spaces provides an affordable means of accommodating temporary workforces.\
\
It's similar to having an easily accessible toolkit for particular projects, enabling you to assemble and deploy the required staff without having to make long-term infrastructure investments. Decentralizing workers and cutting down on commute times. Many employees may have to make lengthy and difficult commutes from a single central office in large metropolitan areas. Established companies can decentralize their workforce by using coworking spaces in various locations, which will shorten commutes and improve employees' work-life balance. This may result in higher employee retention and satisfaction.\
\
It's similar to setting up more strategically placed, smaller outposts near your employees' homes to reduce the distance they must travel to support the mission. experimenting with hybrid work arrangements & new office models. Coworking spaces provide a low-risk environment for businesses wishing to investigate hybrid work models or test new office concepts without making a sizable upfront investment. Before making a more significant, long-term change, they can test various team configurations, test flexible work policies, or get input from staff members regarding preferred workspaces.\
\
This experimental strategy enables companies to innovate and modify their workplaces in response to feedback from the real world and changing needs. It's similar to conducting a pilot program in a controlled setting to collect information and lessons before starting a larger project. Coworking is no longer just for independent business owners.\
\
Its strategic benefits are being discovered by even big businesses. Providing Specialized Teams with ""Satellite"" Offices. Big businesses frequently have specialized teams that might not fit neatly into current departmental structures or might be situated in places where the company isn't physically present. For these teams, coworking spaces can act as efficient ""satellite"" offices, giving them the tools and a polished setting they need to work effectively.\
\
Because of this, specialized units can be formed without having to incur the high overhead of opening a new branch office. Imagine having specialized scouting units in different areas that are prepared to obtain intelligence. Reaching Talent Sources in New Markets. Finding & securing appropriate office space can be a challenge for businesses looking to grow into new geographic markets. Without the time and money required for a traditional office build-out, coworking spaces provide a readily available solution that enables businesses to establish a presence and start hiring talent in a new city or region.\
\
This makes it possible for businesses to enter markets more quickly & more easily access a variety of talent pools. Establishing a foothold without the need for an immediate fortress is similar to raising a small flag in uncharted territory. bolstering sustainability and corporate social responsibility programs.\
\
Many coworking spaces incorporate green building techniques and encourage eco-friendly operations as part of their sustainable design. Aligning with such spaces can be a smart move for businesses trying to raise their corporate social responsibility (CSR) profile. Also, compared to a proliferation of individual, underutilized office spaces, coworking can help reduce the overall environmental footprint by encouraging shared resources and reducing the need for individual office setups.\
\
Similar to a fleet switching to more fuel-efficient vehicles, this is in line with the growing need for businesses to operate in a more environmentally conscious manner. In conclusion, a coworking environment that prioritizes flexibility, community, affordability, and scalability is ideal. Under the right circumstances, coworking spaces offer a compelling and frequently better alternative to traditional workspace models, whether you're an individual navigating the freelance landscape, a growing startup looking to expand, a remote team seeking connection, or an established business looking for agile solutions. Even though it might not be a cure-all, knowing these particular situations enables us to make the most of coworking, turning it from a fad into a tactical instrument for career advancement. .\

He has a problem with porn that makes me insecure and I have a problem with my mental health that makes me unattractive to him. We’ve been struggling, me with being more positive and joyful, and him with being less active with his adult activity online.

We’ve had a hard couple weeks, and we have finally been on the other side of some dark times the past week or two. Happier, lighter, more intimate… today, he was running late from work and he called me and at first said “I’ve just been sitting in my car doing nothing until now so I’m heading home” and then after some small talk, he tells me he wants to tell me something but I can’t get mad.

I don’t agree, because I feel like that’s a trap people say when they’re definitely going to make you mad.

He tells me he went to a local bikini barista and bought a coffee and it tasted pretty good. I responded with two things.

one: why, when your side of the problems in our relationship has been lusting after other women, would you then do something that you knew would upset me.

And two: this man HATES coffee. He always has, for as long as I’ve known him… So he went out of his way to lust after another woman to spend $10 buying a drink you don’t even like??

Now he’s upset that he told me and said he should have kept it to yourself. I told him over and over I was glad he told me and I would have been more upset if I would have found it out on my own, but that I can’t just not be mad that he went out of his way to do something that he knew would upset me in a time where we are already struggling.

Am I overreacting to think It’s normal for me to be upset about this? He thinks because he told me I shouldn’t be upset since it’s out in the open.. my stance is that if he wanted to go to a bikini barista, I would have considered going with him or discussing it with him beforehand, but instead he set up the conversation with the lie about sitting in his car doing nothing for a while.

He thinks I’m being dramatic for being upset and I’m a little scared to be upset because he is so not attracted to me when I’m upset and I don’t want to go backwards for nothing. Should this be ok because he told me? He’s clearly very disappointed in my reaction, and upset that I got upset about this.",1,1769212083.0,AmIOverreacting,15,1.0,False

1ql6wiu,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ql6wiu,2026 week 2 & 3 of cooking from cookbooks,"Hi, CookbookLovers! I totally dropped the ball on posting last week. So this week’s a double header featuring 2 weeks of recipes from Molly Baz’s Cook This Book and special appearances by The Bean Book and Snacking Bakes.

Ok, I’ve resisted Cook This Book. Molly Baz’s liberal use of cutesy little names for things annoys the heck out of me. Seriously, Cae Sal, I’m looking at you. Not only that, but I often flip through the book and feel like I don’t want to eat any of it. I’ve had this book for 8 months and I’ve never once cooked out it for these reasons. Honestly, the only reason I still have it is because I forgot to return it.

So there it sat on my donation pile two weeks ago when I picked up it and challenged myself to cook out of it before I got rid of it. And I’ll tell you what, I’m glad I did. Not only was everything I made a banger, but also I realized I love how she writes her recipes. Everyone should tell you how much of an ingredient to use at each step. I hate having to flip back to ingredient lists to figure it out. I also love that she includes QR codes linking to videos of various cooking skills. It’s so handy. Am I still annoyed by the nicknames? Yes. Does my interest in the recipes change from day to day? You bet. But, y’all, I think I’m a Molly Baz convert. Suffice it to say, the book stays. 

So without further ado, here’s what I made during the last 2 weeks:

1. Perfect Poached Eggs & Spiced Chickpeas and Smothered Pita Chips: this is basically the love child of shakshuka and chilaquiles - two of my faves. It came together really quickly and was super flavorful. I’ve never poached eggs the way she described but they came out perfectly. Naturally, I took some liberties: I had 2 eggs with it (I know, I’m out of control) and I used 7 oz of pita chips instead of 6 because that’s how big my bag was. Definitely stick to 6 oz for it to be a little saucier. The best part was the pita chips still had a little crisp to them the next day. I was fully prepared for them to be a limp, soggy mess. I will definitely make this again.

2. Poached Chicken Over Brothy Rice with Cilantro Scallion Sauce: This was so refreshing and light. It would perfect during the summer. The cilantro scallion sauce and the broth are the real stars here. Molly wasn’t lying that the recipe makes a lot of broth - I froze several quarts.

3. Minty Lamb Meatballs with Crispy Cabbage and Tahini Sauce: 1000/10 stars. Seriously, this is one of my favorite things I’ve cooked in ages. It took maybe 10 minutes of active time and was ready to eat in under an hour. The meatballs are juicy, the cabbage is sweet. I think next time I may make half as much tahini sauce because it ended up being quite a lot. But that’s the only thing I would do differently.

4. Sweetie P’s with Peanut-Chile Salsa: At first I didn’t think I liked this recipe - there was something green in the flavor profile that was throwing me off. I think it was because I under-salted the salsa. And just slightly over fried the nuts. It happens, we live and learn. If you make this, I would recommend using less oil, because the salsa was too oily. And now that I think about it, that could be the source of the greenness because olive oil. This was my least favorite recipe of the bunch and I still enjoyed it. But between you and me, next time I’m putting cheese on them.

5. Pasta e Ceci (The Bean Book): Did I use canned chickpeas? Yes. I just couldn’t be bothered to soak them and make bean broth. Because I didn’t have bean broth, I decided to throw a Parmesan rind in with the water for some extra flavor. No regrets. I keep them in my freezer for this very situation (and you should too.) This was an easy, hearty, delicious recipe that made tons of leftovers. Highly recommend.

6. Coffee Glazed Molasses Bars (Snacking Bakes): I handed this book to my husband and asked him to pick out what he wanted. This is what he chose. I’m not surprised - the man is a coffee fiend. I failed to make my molasses cookies for the holidays, so I’m glad I got that fix. These were wonderful - just full of warmth and flavor. I was skeptical of the coffee glaze. I tasted it on its own, and it was simultaneously so sweet and so so bitter. To be fair, I did add twice the amount of instant espresso (thought it would be a nice surprise). But once the glaze was on the bars, the bitterness completely disappeared. It was like magic. Overall this is a very cozy dessert. I might need to make a second batch to get through this blizzard.

Hope everyone who’s going to be impacted by the storm stays safe and has a chance to make your coziest recipes! ",88,1769211777.0,CookbookLovers,14,1.0,False

1ql6tpj,https://www.reddit.com/r/beyondthebump/comments/1ql6tpj/am_i_unreasonable_for_wanting_time_alone_to_work/,Am I Unreasonable for Wanting Time Alone to Work Out?,"I have a question for those of you who have already started working out again after having had a baby. 

How do you make it work? How do you find the time? Seriously, how?!

I have a very strong need to start exercising again, but even 8 months after giving birth I still haven’t managed to do it. My husband works from home and actually has the opportunity to take care of the baby during the day. She is bottle fed with breast milk since I pump, so that’s not an issue either. He has also previously said that it should be completely fine for him to watch her while I train. He knows how to put her down for a nap, change her diaper etc. 

BUT every time I mention that I want to start running or go to the gym, it feels like it has to be planned 2–3 weeks in advance for it to “fit” his schedule. Suddenly there are always lots of other things he has to do. He’s always guilt tripping me about how busy he is whenever I try to hint about how I need more alike time. Now he also thinks I should hire a babysitter to watch the baby while I go for a run or go to the gym.

Am I the only one who feels this is a bit unreasonable? I know that I’m not comfortable having a babysitter every other day, especially when I would have to “teach” someone completely new everything about our baby. Even though my husband has offered to pay for a babysitter, I just end up feeling provoked. I honestly feel like I never get any real free time or time just for myself. I feel like he’s trying to make me postpone this even further because he knows I’m not comfortable leaving my baby with some stranger. 

The baby was very colicy for the first 4-5 months, she only wanted to contact nap and I’ve been pumping milk for her since she was born, I even went diary free for 6 months and then realised it was a complete waste because she doesn’t have CMPA. This is about me getting out of out of the door ALONE and feeling like a normal person again before I go crazy. 

Unfortunately, I’m also one of those people who can’t work out at home, because I get distracted far too easily. My husband has suggested those baby and mommy classes but honestly I’m just not that type of person and this is about me getting out of the house ALONE, it’s like he expects me to bring the baby everywhere.

On weekends or whatever he’ll sometimes take the baby out to get coffee, even tho he claims he do it so I can be alone I end up doing laundry or cleaning. I never have time for myself. 

So the question again is, am I really that unreasonable for wanting to leave the house for 1-2 hour(s) every other day so I can do something for ME? And my health? ",3,1769211589.0,beyondthebump,18,0.72,False

Wanted to share the thinking behind it.

**The problem I kept hitting:** Every time I started a new project, I'd spend 2+ hours on domain searches. The worst part wasn't finding ideas, it was the false hope. Traditional tools show you names that are technically ""available"" but actually parked, squatted, or priced at $10k.

**What I built:** Colette DN (colettedn.com) — an AI-powered domain finder where you describe your project and get back creative, brandable names that are verified available in real-time. If you see it, you can register it.

**Key decisions:**

* **AI-generated names** — not just keyword mashups, actual creative suggestions based on your description
* **Live verification** — every domain is checked against registrars before showing results
* **Freemium** — 3 free searches/day, $29/year for unlimited (trying to hit the ""cup of coffee per month"" price point)

**What I'm unsure about:**

* Is $29/year the right price? Too cheap? Too expensive?
* Should I add more TLDs? Currently: .com, .io, .ai, .dev, .app, .co, .net
* Any obvious features I'm missing?

I am here on a Saturday, 12 in the morning. This was a recommendation from a friend, which I do appreciate. They do provide Wi-Fi, but you will have to ask for the password, which is not a big deal unless you don’t like talking to people. If you don’t like to talk to people, this is also a good location, it is pretty quiet, maybe due to the weather and time of year.

  
The layout is nice, having booths in the back and more cafe-style seating upfront. I chose the booth because I needed more space to do work but the cafe-style seating is nice as well. Having large windows up front allows for a lot of light but is a bit dim in the back. The decor is brutalist but tame (IG this is what all cities are like?). The seat is comfortable though but not able to find plugs in the booth so should come with full battery if you are planning to study.

The coffee is good, no burnt flavour, bitter but bearable. A little fruity, definitely will be getting another. The flavour profile does have some depth with the fruitiness but I don’t think it is anything that is too out of the ordinary.

Location is cool, located in the CBD is always helpful, and it is tucked away from the main street making it more private. Though it is a walk from Britomart.

  
Coffee = 5/10 (solid)

I'm a teacher candidate currently working toward my undergrad in Secondary Ed ELA, meaning I'm starting my field experience this semester.

I've been super excited to see what my first placement will be! We got them today, and it's unfortunately the one school I \*didn't\* want to go to, LOL. On one hand, it's great because it's only 5 minutes from me; on the other hand, it's also right next to my place of work, which is a Starbucks... so I see a lot of high schoolers at my job. For this reason (wanting to keep my teacher life and personal life separate), I didn't want to go to this specific high school, but it is what it is.

Does anyone have words of advice for encountering your students outside the classroom, especially in an environment that could be embarrassing, such as your job/second job/school/library? Maybe it's just my anxiety talking, but I'd hate to see one of my potential students at my job, where I'm in a sort of ""lower"" position as a barista instead of a position of authority, as their teacher. I'm also an incredibly private person - my social media is all private and under a pseudonym, and I'd obviously prefer my students don't know I work at a fast food coffee shop.",1,1769210915.0,Teachers,5,1.0,False

He has a problem with porn that makes me insecure and I have a problem with my mental health that makes me unattractive to him. We’ve been struggling, me with being more positive and joyful, and him with being less active with his adult activity online. 

We’ve had a hard couple weeks, and we have finally been on the other side of some dark times the past week or two. Happier, lighter, more intimate… today, he was running late from work and he called me and at first said “I’ve just been sitting in my car doing nothing until now so I’m heading home” and then after some small talk, he tells me he wants to tell me something but I can’t get mad. 

I don’t agree, because I feel like that’s a trap people say when they’re definitely going to make you mad. 

He tells me he went to a local bikini barista and bought a coffee and it tasted pretty good. I responded with two things. 

one: why, when your side of the problems in our relationship has been lusting after other women, would you then do something that you knew would upset me.

And two: this man HATES coffee. He always has, for as long as I’ve known him… So he went out of his way to lust after another woman to spend $10 buying a drink you don’t even like??

Now he’s upset that he told me and said he should have kept it to yourself. I told him over and over I was glad he told me and I would have been more upset if I would have found it out on my own, but that I can’t just not be mad that he went out of his way to do something that he knew would upset me in a time where we are already struggling.

Am I overreacting to think It’s normal for me to be upset about this? He thinks because he told me I shouldn’t be upset since it’s out in the open.. my stance is that if he wanted to go to a bikini barista, I would have considered going with him or discussing it with him beforehand, but instead he set up the conversation with the lie about sitting in his car doing nothing for a while. 

He thinks I’m being dramatic for being upset and I’m a little scared to be upset because he is so not attracted to me when I’m upset and I don’t want to go backwards for nothing. Should this be ok because he told me? He’s clearly very disappointed in my reaction, and upset that I got upset about this. ",1,1769210883.0,okstorytime,2,1.0,False

basically the title. this has happened multiple times, but it’s getting to the point where i want to say something to him about it.

what happened yesterday was we were in a cafe sitting outside with our dogs, on our daily dog walk/cafe visit, and since it was 45 degrees i said id like an iced tea rather than my usual coffee. he got upset at me and accused me of trying to restrict my calorie intake (im a recovering anorexic). i legitimately wasn’t, I just didn’t want a hot drink.

he got mad and started raising his voice at me (not quite yelling, but getting there) in german and ranting about how im just going to reverse all my progress and end up back in hospital. i told him not to do this here and could we at least have this conversation at home since i was embarrassed and he was misunderstanding, but he kept talking loudly, saying it was fine because no one here could understand him anyway (there’s not a huge german community in melbourne since it’s not a language taught much in schools here or anything but you never know what language someone speaks here).

as i said before, this has happened multiple times. i understand how hard it is for him to see his son like this, and how me wanting tea vs coffee could come off as me purposely choosing a lower calorie option and falling into a relapse. but I think it’s really rude of him, and also just not socially acceptable.

I am visiting family in Cairns and they have a Rancilio Silvia V2 that could serve the right person.

It belonged to my parents, but they barely used it in years. My father is very recently deceased and my mother prefers to make a single serve french press. I'm in the process of helping declutter their house following my father's passing.

I'm a former Silvia user myself (V3) and I love them. I got rid of mine in 2021 when I left Australia for the US. Now I am more of a filter coffee drinker.

**This one needs some work.**

In 2024 when I last visited I replaced the steam knob and spring clip which had failed. It now has a V1 steam knob. It appears to operational. I believe the boiler is good. That's the heart of this machine and I wouldn't want it to go to waste.

**It needs a deep clean** before I'd even test making a coffee with it. Under the current circumstances that is not a priority for my short visit here, even if I had my maintenance supplies on hand.

The plastic group head guard is chipping. I haven't disassembled the group head, but I'm sure it could use cleaning and inspection of the gasket.

It has lived in a non-air conditioned home in the tropics for at least 15 years I think, so there is some minor oxidation.

I was going to try to sell it, but on second thoughts if someone is willing and able to restore it, I will give it to them as-is and wish them well.

It is located in Smithfield, in the northern suburbs.

I'm only in town until Friday, 30 Jan and I'd hope to get it out of here before then. Short notice, I know.

Please share this with any Cairns coffee people you know.

Thanks.

Edit to add: Optional free Sunbeam grinder. In contrast to the Silvia, I have no respect for this piece of crap (half-serious). It does a terrible job and is does not grind fine enough for espresso, but it can go with the Silvia, or it’ll go in the bin.

Also, I’m not sure if we have a milk steaming jug for the Silvia. If I find it, it’ll be included. Otherwise it has everything I’m pretty sure.",5,1769210505.0,AustralianCoffee,1,1.0,False

\-

Christmas morning arrived the way it always did in our house. Too bright, too loud, too cheerful.

I sat at the island and watched my mother move through the kitchen humming, her smile fixed and practiced, handing out mugs of coffee as if they were props in a play. My father laughed too easily, clapping me on the back, whistling some Bing Crosby tune as he walked into the kitchen. Ross sat stiffly on the arm of the couch, phone face down in his lap, while Samantha crossed and uncrossed her legs, wrapping and rewrapping her robe’s belt.

We were a family of five who knew exactly how to play pretend.

I noticed it more than ever this year. The way laughter came a second too late. The way nobody asked what time it was.

Because we all knew.

Uncle Lenny would be here soon.

Every Christmas, like a sickness that followed the calendar, Uncle Lenny showed up at our door with a crooked grin and a gift bag. He smelled faintly of cologne and cigarettes. He stayed too long. He lingered too close. He touched shoulders, wrists, backs - always just enough to remind us that he could.

And always enough to remind us what he knew.

I watched the clock tick toward noon and felt the familiar tightening in my chest. It didn’t matter that I was approaching thirty now. Uncle Lenny had a way of making time meaningless.

I looked at my father first. He was pouring a drink a little too early in the day, the ice clinking against the glass - his way of numbing the memories of a summer back when he was a teenager. The August heat. An act of horrific foul play. The long silence that followed. Uncle Lenny had been the one to grab the shovel back then, the one who said they had to stick together. Now, Dad drank to drown out the death rattle of someone taken too soon.

Mom moved around him, her smile tight as she arranged cookies on a platter. She told herself it was just a moment of weakness from a lifetime ago - a time when she felt invisible and Uncle Lenny was the only one looking. But he never let the moment die. He never said the words out loud, yet his eyes held the weight of the betrayal, looking at her not as family, but as a puppet. So she smiled, she baked, and she prayed that the secret she shared with him wouldn't tear her home apart.

On the couch, Ross sat rigid, staring at his phone but looking at nothing. He was nineteen again in his mind - confused and desperate for someone to understand him. Uncle Lenny had offered support, but it came with a price Ross was still paying. A blurred memory of his dorm room and boundaries that were pushed until they collapsed. It wasn't just a secret; it was a shame that Ross couldn’t scrub off in the shower, a stain Uncle Lenny refused to let him wash away.

And then there was Sam, wrapping her robe tighter around her waist like armor. She had been sixteen and terrified when she made the phone call. She hadn’t called our parents; Uncle Lenny answered. He had driven her there. He had paid the bill. He had held her hand while she cried, then held the photograph over her head for two decades. Every time he looked at her, Sam didn't see a loving uncle; she saw the only man who knew what she had sacrificed to keep her life on track.

The doorbell rang.

We all flinched.

Mom smoothed her hair. Dad cleared his throat. Ross shut off his phone. Sam adjusted her robe.

I stayed where I was, finishing the last sip of my coffee. I looked at my family - broken, terrified, and corrupt. They thought they were the only ones with something to hide. They were wrong.

Uncle Lenny had arrived.

And Christmas could finally begin.

What if you could achieve that creamy texture and visual appeal without sacrificing space or investing in multiple devices? That's where smart, versatile coffee solutions come in.

The problem with many coffee setups is the limitation. You might love your K-Cups but crave espresso, or vice versa. Then there's the whole milk frothing dilemma. Instead of a separate, often bulky, frother, imagine a single machine that handles it all, delivering barista-quality drinks and the perfect creamy top. This is the vision HiBREW brings to your kitchen, blending high-end functionality with a sleek, space-saving design.

Here's why a HiBREW machine is your secret weapon for a superior coffee aesthetic:

*   **Universal Compatibility:** Forget being tied to one pod type. HiBREW machines brew K-Cup, Nespresso, Dolce Gusto, and even ground coffee, giving you ultimate freedom to experiment with flavors and find your perfect coffee.
*   **True Espresso Power:** Featuring a robust 19-bar (or 20-bar for Pro models) high-pressure extraction system, you get rich, authentic espresso crema every time – the foundation for any stunning coffee drink.
*   **Cold & Hot Versatility:** Craving a refreshing iced latte or a piping hot macchiato? HiBREW handles both, ensuring your milk is frothed to perfection for any beverage, hot or cold, enhancing both taste and visual appeal.

Struggling a little with how I am actually doing in recovery. Yes, I am gaining weight - slowly but I am letting my weight go up. But the novelty of food is wearing off, and I can see myself sliding into my old exercise routines to cope. If that makes sense. I am not really experiencing the EXTREME hunger anymore and I will be honest - that scares me, if I am not ravenously hunger for every meal or fantasying about food or looking at new food to try I dont really know what to be doing. It also has be quite stressed out because my hunger isn't as extreme, I feel maybe I am beginning to overeat. But then to be transparent I do wonder if my hunger has maybe levelled off a little because I am a lot busier and a lot more active - which I won't lie has become a little bit of a coping strategy. In that meeting my energy can be 'justified' on days I am more active. Days I am not I find it harder and are usually the days I slip. Also I have been doing pilates once of twice a week, my sister has actually started coming too. I went tonight after work with my sister which was lovely but I also realise that I have been very active today hence meeting my energy wasn't too difficult mentally.

Yet despite all this, I do wonder how I am gaining with all my activity and missing my energy. But I guess my body is just building itself back up, also my plates are looking SO much better than before and I have come a long way in terms of the variety and portions. It just is hard because basically I can tell little rules and rituals are starting to build up with exercise particularly, but also food I guess - yet I am gaining weight and it seems to others I am doing well. These are things only I can changes so I am not asking for someone to tell me what do do etc, because ultimately I know what I need to be doing, but I want to be honest and was maybe hoping for advice or if anyone has been through a similar experience in their recovery. I.e. loosing hunger, food focus - despite high activity and missing energy. Bodies and recovery are just weird.

In other news, work was good. Got some overtime swapped with a colleague so my hours are SO much better YAY! Also booked in some more pilates. Dad has been his usual miserable self and has started telling me he is so lonely, he has nothing to live for and wants to die etc which at this stage idk what to say. It sounds awful but I nearly want to be like whenever I go out and have a life and he is left he starts saying this shit, yet when I spend time with him he just abuses me and tells me I am a burden - you can NEVER win.

 

My new food, well actually foods, were the Jason’s which I really enjoyed and also the honey, which wasn’t as good as my old one, but it was expenny so will be using it all lol! My challenge was to not change my chocolate plate, like just use what we have decided the night before and I was so proud I managed this! Anyways hope you all are well!

I started talking to a girl and things moved very fast. We spent a lot of time together — talking, calling, going out, even kissing. Then we went back to our hometowns for a week, and even at a distance, we were communicating well.



After that, she said she might “act differently” during her period. Our communication became colder, but I tried to be patient and understanding.



When we returned to the city, we wanted to meet, but she refused. For about a week, our interaction was almost nonexistent — I would ask questions, and her replies were short and distant. I tried to give my all: bringing flowers, coffee, small gestures of care. But I didn’t feel warmth in return, and it hurt a lot.



Eventually, I went to talk to her in person. She said she likes me, still does, but she has “no energy or time” because of exams, work, and health issues. And she said she wants to completely stop communication.



I felt empty and numb when I got home. I even texted her saying I understand she’s going through a hard time and that I care about her, but she repeated that she wants to end things.



And yet, she started posting on her Telegram channel as if everything was fine. Meanwhile, I’ve been unable to eat or sleep properly for the last few days.



I feel lost, scared, and in this strange emptiness. My friend told me that girls don’t like it when someone “chases” them, but everything before felt fine. I don’t know what I did wrong or what I should do now.



I just needed to share this. I feel completely out of control of my own emotions and I don’t know how to deal with this.

Hello friends! This post will be long! I am feeling chatty and perfume is my current special interest lol 😅 I really wanted to talk about one of my favorite rose perfumes, I hardly ever see her mentioned and she is AMAZING!!🥰

**If you want a TLDR, the perfume is Rose Origami by Maison Alhambra.** It's on Amazon, or if you're around the Chicago area, you can try it in person at an Intense Oud store. Go forth and smell divine. If you're interested in the \~story\~, keep reading.

❓Basic Info, I Guess:

I officially started my perfume journey less than half a year ago after not using any perfume for the majority of my life. I've smelled lots of rose fragrances- designer, niche, drugstore, bath and body works, indie perfume brands...but the one I keep coming back to is Rose Origami by Maison Alhambra, a random unexpected purchase I made for myself over the holidays. When I first smelled it in the store, it was incredible. I was planning to eventually get myself a ""nice rose perfume"" closer to spring, but I loved the smell of this one so much that I knew I wanted it, and it was inexpensive. I figured it would give me an opportunity to experiment with a rose fragrance I liked a lot.

🥀The One Rose: 

I've been on the hunt for the perfect ""true rose"" perfume for me and I've learned a few things: one, I don't want a lot of other competing notes, like citrus, herbs, spices, or even too much woodiness. For this perfume, I want the rose to shine through. I want it to smell like when I open up my rose essential oil to put in my diffuser. I want it to smell like the most beautiful, rich, smooth rose I've ever smelled. Two, lots of rose scents tend to change drastically on my skin. Not sure why, but they definitely shift or fade a lot more than other types of fragrances I have. This has led to a lot of circumstances where I start off with a nice rose perfume, but it changes so much that while it's still a nice perfume, it definitely isn't rosey anymore. I want to smell my arm 4 hours later and still smell like a rose. 

😍Love At ~~First Sight~~ Second Sniff:

After trying and buying the perfume in store, I opened the box at home, uncapped the bottle, and the smell was heavenly. Pure, rich, deep, velvety, smooth, satiny, bleeding beautiful rose, right off the bat. The bottle itself is pretty, and the glass is thick and seems to be good quality. The cap is secure and nothing leaks. I put it on my desk next to my more ""seasonally appropriate"" perfumes, my vanillas and my ambers, telling myself that it wasn't time yet, and that I should be using the warmer scents now. 

👑Nothing Compares 2 U:

I've sampled lots of rose perfumes (not all, but many). So many of them have too many other THINGS going on that I DID NOT ASK FOR!!!! I want to smell like a rose...not a rose for like an hour and then some other thing. I sampled perfumes from Creed, MFK, Initio, Bath and Body Works, Phlur, Nemat, Zara, Jo Malone, indie brands, even literally just putting rosa damascena essential oil on my body. I KEEP COMING BACK TO ROSE ORIGAMI. The thing is, Rose Origami's rose note is SO, so good. It's addicting, sensual, romantic, and PURE rose. This is like if you walked into the rose garden of the Queen of Hearts, but she had enchanted every flower to be an aphrodisiac. It's giving ""your lover has lit candles and put roses on the bed you share"", it's giving ""mysterious fancy cocktail bar that feels like it belongs in a different time and the attractive bartender in the maroon velvet suit made you a special rose drink"". It's giving ""I'm at an evening soiree drinking my wine in my red satin dress, and everyone is whispering, ""who is she? Who is that mysterious, complex, beautiful woman who smells so good?"" On my skin, it never ever shifts to something unpleasant. It always keeps that same true, pure, juicy red rose. If a rose can be juicy with rosiness, this one is.  If you bit into this rose like an apple, red rose juices would drip down your chin. That's how pure this rose smell is to me. 

👃🏻My Notes on the Other Notes:

I mentioned that I don't like a lot of competing notes in rose perfumes, and I know this perfume \*has\* a decent amount of notes, but the rose is so strong that everything else just lifts up the rose and gives it more complexity. Online, it says Rose Origami is supposed to be a dupe for Cafe Rose by Tom Ford (which I have never smelled and didn't know existed until now), and it supposedly has coffee notes. Honestly, I have never smelled one whiff of coffee from this. I don't dislike coffee scents and probably would enjoy a rose-coffee scent, but this certainly isn't one in my opinion. Of course fragrances are different for everyone, but while this fragrance has a lot of depth and complexity, it lacks any sort of element that would actually make it...well, coffee-y. There's no bitterness or nuttiness, no sharpness. It's sweet and syrupy, sort of like what I think a rose flavoring syrup would be like, but less artificial. That strong, that sweet, but in a *pure* way. If I close my eyes and imagine a coffee bean while chanting ""COFFEE!! COFFEE!!"" in my head, I can *maybe sort of kind of* *THINK* I smell coffee....maybe. (No I can't. I'm lying. If you're looking for coffee, look elsewhere.) 

*💭*Future Ponderings:

I had been thinking about getting Delina La Rosee by PDM (not a huge fan of regular Delina or DE). I still might. They are very different from each other and really come down to a fresh pink vs. a pure red rose for me. Of all the rose scents I've tried, DLR and Rose Origami definitely outperform the others. They last the longest on skin. I would even go as far as to say that Rose Origami lasts longer than DLR, and it is absolutely nuclear on clothing and fabric. I will legitimately spray this on myself in the afternoon, go through my evening, go to bed, wake up, and still smell it. DLR is really really lovely, but compared to this rose, it's almost bubblegum or candy-like, which is SO DIFFERENT to how I initially interpreted it on its own. Compared to Rose Origami, it's fluffy, cloudy, and very sweet and pink. DLR does have that really nice fresh aquatic note, or a note like a fresh breeze, that isn't present in Rose Origami. I do think Rose Origami might be a bit heavy to wear in the summertime, but I have yet to test that out. Maybe I'll still get DLR, but even having them both on right now, one on one arm and one on another...the DLR is starting to give me a headache and smell too synthetic. The Rose Origami? Beautiful as ever.

We met in high school and were both brought up in Christian homes. We have three children together. 

 

About 6 years ago I discovered fanfiction (yes, I was late the party), and started consuming it like crack. After about 9 months I decided to try my hand at writing my own story. At the time I was reading and writing M/F. 

Then I got sucked into a M/M ship that, as they would say, gripped me tight and raised me from perdition (or my life as a burned out mom of 3). I read millions of words over the space of a few months and before long I started writing it. It has been 3 years and I have written close to a million words. Not all of it is smut, because good god that would be exhausting, but I definitely enjoy putting it into my stories. I’ve written stuff that makes Heated Rivalry look like Sesame Street.  

I am not a hugely popular author in the fandom, but I did write one particular story I’m immensely proud of. It was receive very well. I worked with an artist within the fandom who draw some spectacular artwork and then convinced me to get it printed. It cannot be published because it is fanfiction, but we each have a copy and a few fandom friends too. 

I cried when I saw my printed work, and then cried when I hid it in my wardrobe. 

My husband doesn’t know what I write or read. He is very conservative. I am much more liberal in my faith. 

He knows I write, and he gives me time to write on weekends by taking the kids out of the house or by giving me a few hours to go to coffee shop and write. We both know it is fanfiction, so not profitable, but I love it and I’m a better person when I get time for myself and my things. 

But here’s the thing: I won’t let read it. He has asked to read my work and I just shake my head, saying that it’s too embarrassing. I said it’s like showing someone your diary or your inner thoughts. To which, he rightly countered, I put it out online for others to read. But they are strangers, it’s different. 

He has not pushed me on this and respects my privacy. I don’t think he is checking my laptop or anything like that when I’m not around. He’s not that type of person, and honestly, I don’t know that he cares that much (now).

Sometimes when I’m writing, he’ll come up to kiss me good night or talk to me and I close the screen afraid of what he’ll see. I see the hurt on his face. 

I feel like I’m hiding this huge secret from him. 

I feel like I’m hiding in the closet. 

I’m afraid that if he knew he would disapprove and lose all respect for me. It would create a huge problem in the home and between us. I’m afraid that he would absolutely hate it whenever I sat down to write if he knew what I was writing, and that it would become practically impossible for me to continue to do so.
