My unit was untouched by flames, but the unit that shares a wall is completely gone. Nothing but rubble. I can get all my stuff out, but my question is about smoke damage. I know plastic is porous, and can be dangerous especially if it’s food things, but if my things have no soot or ash on them are they safe? Everything smells like smoke, but is otherwise clean. I’m ok if the answer is throw it all out. But it would also be nice to not have to buy everything. 

Things like, I have plastic measuring spoons, but they were in a dishwasher. My soda stream, and aeropress for coffee. If it isn’t safe I won’t risk it. But I’m not sure if I need to?

But I made a mistake. I got a new pourover standard and I placed my scale on it. This resulted in me not knowing how much water I was pouring in my v60. I should've placed my scale under it.

In the end the total was 270 grams of water. I got grumpy, thinking I ruined my morning coffee. But I accepted my fate, learned my lesson. I took my first sip and I liked it a lot? It was delicious.

This made me realise: don't take coffee too seriously. It's just coffee. Fresh beans are doing all the hard work.

It also made me realise I missed out on so much coffee in the past. For a long time my recipe was: 15 gr of coffee, 225 grams of water. If I only made my ratio's larger, I could've got so much more delicious coffee in my cup.

1qa9n3v,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qa9n3v,Interested in a 1998 Gaggia espresso machine with vertical buttons; hard to find working (sold for parts). Is this a good deal? Can it still be modded?,"Hi there,

I’ve just found out about 1998 Gaggia espresso machines and I fell in love with the vertical buttons. 

However, this model is usually sold for parts or not working/need work so finding one will require work to get running and in good condition; the next thing is I plan to mod is it with a GaggiMate or Gaggiuino mods and I’m not sure the limit on model age (if that a thing).

**I have a few questions:**


What should I look out for when buying? 


Can this model still be modded with a gaggiamate or gaggiaino? 


Do this listings look like a good/fair deal? 

Anyone know other places other than eBay to find older Gaggia models? 

The last picture is of my ideal machine/set up; would have to research if that grinder is good but there are others I already know about.

* Craters of the moon.
* 1 night in Ketchum.
* Couple nights in the Sawtooth Mountains (including 1 backcountry camping night).
* Find a hot spring on the way to Boise where we'll spend the night. 
* Head to Owyhee Canyon then Steens mountain in Oregon. 

Some places which currently didn't make the cut but I could add in are:

* City of Rocks
* Bruneau dunes state park (cut because we'll be visiting Alvord desert for our desert fix)

  
As you can see I'm mainly looking for natural beauty and I'd love to soak in a couple of hot springs, but any recommendations - including vegan restaurants along the way - would be great! Thanks! ",4,1768162143.0,Idaho,1,1.0,False

I had an edible from a coffee shop in the Netherlands with unknown strength on friday evening around 8 pm. After about two hours I was high as fuck. I do not consume regularly and have had unpleasant experiences in the past but I wanted to try it again - I know now, very stupid idea. I had the worst trip of my life. I thought I was dying. My boyfriend was with me the whole time but he couldn’t calm me down. I begged for an ambulance. I couldn’t move my limbs and tried to crawl towards my phone. He told me I needed to lie down and relax. I tried my best but kept panicking again and again, almost fainting a couple of times. I threw up at one point because I was so nauseous. Eventually it finally got better and we went to sleep. I woke up yesterday feeling very very odd. I find it hard to describe but based on my research depersonalisation might be it. It has not changed since then. I feel like there is a wall between me and my body. When I want to say something words come out but it doesn’t feel like my own voice. I feel like I’m constantly trying to catch up to reality and what is happening around me. I am so so scared that this is permanent. I keep spiralling and I cannot seem to calm myself down. I’m so afraid that I will never feel normal and like myself again. I also keep re-living the events of friday night.

1qa9jfj,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegas/comments/1qa9jfj/westgate_review/,Westgate Review,"We came to Vegas because our one grandson was competing in a gymnastics competition at the Westgate.  We were able to get a group rate on the rooms there, but only for a select number of days. So our 1st night we stayed at the Plaza, which was cool.  Then we moved into the Westgate.

1. There's no temporary parking by the front door for check-in. Only taxis, Uber and valet there.
2. Valet parking is $20 for every in & out.
3. Self parking is in a garage about 100 yards from the north end of the hotel. That is $10 for every in & out.  
4. Our room was in the East wing. So from the parking garage, you have to walk from the garage a 100 yards to the North wing. Enter the north wing and walk another 100+ yards to the center of the hotel, then walk another 100 yards to the elevator in the east wing. Once on your floor, you may have to walk another 50 yards to your room.
5. There are no baggage carts available. Like NONE!  So we rolled our shit in from the garage to the front desk.  After leaving the front desk, this bell hop started to bug us to take our bags. Not sure how he was going to take 2 suitcases, 2 carry-ons and 2 backpacks with no fucking cart. I told him we were okay and then he actually insisted and starting grabbing my bag from my hand. I had to tell him to back the fk off. I dragged the fking bags this far, I'll finish the task.
6. Whenever you walk thru the lobby, you got these timeshare vultures coming up to you to try to get you into the 90 minute spiel. These mf's never quit, and they are doing it at all hours day & night. I ignore one and literally 10 feet later another one is swooping in. 
7. There is one coffee shop, but only like 4 tables to sit at.  The lobby has no chairs whatsoever to sit on.  
8. The Westgate is literally in the middle of nowhere. It is not close to anything, unless you wanna walk a few miles.
9. On a positive note, the room is okay (but the bathroom is tiny) and the housekeeping does a good job. 

Bottom line: This place is nothing but a money grab. I vowed not to put one fking cent into their casino. I wish I would've stayed at the Plaza which was actually cheaper WITH Free Parking and the vibe on Freemont is so much better.
I would only recommend the Westgate to people I dislike.",2,1768162014.0,vegas,0,1.0,False

Theo hadn’t slept much last night, but he was too nervous to notice. He leaned forward in his chair, eyes glued to the TV screens mounted inside the delivery van. The screens relayed video from inside Musée des Arts du Rivage - a statue, a painting, a roving view of a near-empty hallway – all fed from video-enabled eyeglasses worn by the plainclothes officers inside. The air inside the van was warm and stale.

Keeping Theo company was Olivier, the local police lieutenant. “What will you say to him, if you catch him?” Olivier asked, leaning back in his chair.

“When I catch him.” Theo corrected. “I haven’t thought about it.”

That was a lie. Theo had thought of this day for years. He thought of it when as a young detective pouring over crime reports, he noticed a pattern everyone else had missed. He thought of it when his buddies told him he was crazy, that no one person could orchestrate such a series of robberies. He thought of it when his boss told him to give it up and get back to his queue, or else.

Now he was here, at the precipice of victory and vindication. *Le Fantôme* (that’s what Theo called him) felt so close Theo could almost reach out and cuff him.

“Any moment,” Olivier commented.

“Yes,” Theo agreed. He massaged his neck and felt the adrenaline tingle inside his stomach.

One of the camera feeds settled on a baroque painting hanging on a far wall – a cloth-wrapped baby nestled between apples and oranges.

“There it is,” Olivier said with a chuckle. “I don’t understand art.”

“Everyone is in position,” Theo narrated coldly, ignoring the lieutenant’s comment. He stood up and leaned over the screens.

“Remind me, why not arrest him already?” Olivier asked. “You know his schedule, where he sleeps. Just go get him!”

“We have to catch him in the act,” Theo responded. “This has to be airtight.”

“Big risk,” Olivier commented.

Theo knew he was right. But the bosses were out of patience. Now was not the time to play it safe, not when he was so close. And for the first time, he had an advantage, an ace in the hole. Someone on the inside.

Instinctively, he pulled the burner phone from his back pocket.

 “That’s how you two communicate?” Olivier asked.

“Yes,” Theo nodded.

“Sweet deal!” Olivier exclaimed. “How’d you set that up?”

For years, Theo had been three steps behind. The Bordeaux vault job, the Citadel heist - Le Fantôme was untraceable. He assembled a new team each time, and even when the police could piece together the identities of his accomplices, the accomplices knew nothing useful. Le Fantôme never shared his name and hardly ever showed his face. He pulled strings from the shadows. It was why Theo struggled to convince his superiors that Le Fantôme existed.

Then out of nowhere, a lucky break gifted Theo every detective’s dream. One of his juniors connived her way onto Le Fantôme’s new crew. Suddenly, Theo knew his target, the day, and the moment. 

It was a long story, and right now was certainly not the time.

“Just a good team, good police work,” Theo responded flatly.  

Olivier got the message. He leaned back in his chair and crossed his arms.

They waited in silence. Outside, the traffic hummed by softly. Occasionally, the van’s aluminum shell crackled. Seconds turned into minutes on the white analog clock. Like a hawk, Theo hovered over the painting on his screen.

Suddenly, a shrill, high-pitched clanging. The alarm! Theo and Olivier jumped from their chairs. Panicked voices crackled through the audio connection. The video blurred as the plainclothes officers panned the galleries.

“What’s going on!” Theo called into his microphone. “Where’s the painting!”

“The painting’s here,” responded an officer.  

“Well, find the alarm!” Theo urged.

The plainclothes officers raced through the hallways. Theo watched through jerky video. Paintings, statues, and patrons passed in a blur. Thirty seconds. A minute. Still the alarm rang out like a wild yell.  

“I’m going in,” Theo announced. He grabbed his gun and reached for the door handle.

“Wait!” Olivier gasped.

Theo turned back. One video feed had settled on the jewelry gallery. In the center was a smashed glass case. It was empty.

“*Le Black Orlov*!” exclaimed the plainclothes officer.

Olivier leaned in closer. “That’s 120 carats,” he whispered. “I thought they were going for the painting.”

“Me too,” Theo said. He clenched his jaw and rumbled out of the door.

He sprinted towards the museum entrance. Patrons streamed from the door and pooled on the sidewalk like confused sheep. Theo pushed through them, waving his badge. With his other hand, he pulled out the burner and texted: *Where are you?!?*

He plowed through the museum door. Someone in uniform escorted him through the halls. He kept checking his phone. Why wasn’t she responding? By the time he reached the jewelry gallery, his stomach was in knots.

**Part 2**

*9:13 a.m.*

Chloe quickly walked along the narrow ledge. In front of her, the pathway snaked across the Marseille rooftops. On either side, the shingles fell sharply towards the streets. One misstep promised a fatal fall. But Chloe only increased her pace.  

Behind her though, Emma struggled to keep up. Chloe was surprised; the height shouldn’t have been a problem.

Beneath them, the city was waking up. Impatient car horns and clattering feet floated through the cool morning air. For those people, it was just another normal Tuesday.

But for Chloe, today was showtime. Four short minutes to lifechanging reward or awful defeat. *This* was living.

The last four months had been unlike anything she’d experienced. The stakes. The charades. The pushing of boundaries, physical and mental. She loved a good challenge, and ones like these didn’t come around very often.

Just ahead, a glass dome rose above utility systems and antennas. A few more steps, and she was there. A chimney stood next to the glass. Here, Chloe crouched and peeked down through the dome into the museum’s jewelry gallery. She didn’t see anyone. Perfect.

Chloe glanced back. Emma was still maybe 15 feet behind, teetering precariously with her arms outstretched. Her backpack swung back and forth, playing with her balance.

Chloe offered a hand, and Emma lunged for it. With a strong grip, Chloe pulled her partner close. “Careful,” she said. “You okay?”

Emma nodded. Then she asked, “You ready?”

Chloe glanced at her watch. “Yeah. We need to go.”

Emma swung the backpack off her shoulder and took out three carabiners, a belay device, and some rope. In a heartbeat, she set up a perfect belay system. Chloe gently tugged on the anchor point drilled into the chimney, which Emma had installed the night before.

“Don’t worry,” Emma told her. “You can trust me.”

Chloe nodded.

Emma handed her a club hammer. The hammer was heavy, with a thick steel head. Chloe weighed it in her hand for a moment, then tucked it into her belt. She checked her watch again.

“You ready?” she asked.

Emma fiddled with her harness and then took a deep breath. “Yes,” she responded.

“On my go.”

Chloe peered down through the glass again. For a second, she held her breath. The air felt alive. The rushing city faded away. A bird floated peacefully above. One final nod to Emma.

Then she hurled herself through the glass, shoulder first. Instantly, a shrill, high-pitched clanging. Shards splintered and sprayed the air, falling with a crash to the floor. She heard screams below. For a second, there was freefall. Then, Emma slowed her to a controlled, rapid descent.

When she hit the floor, she glimpsed two people fleeing through the doorway. Not much time. Still clipped in, she raced the few steps to *Le Black Orlov.* Everything blurred around her. Only the diamond remained. It was a beautiful, milky dark color. And it was huge.

She whipped out the club hammer and swung it at the glass casing. Hard. The hammer bounced off, like a repulsed magnet. But it left a crack in the case. Again, Chloe swung. The crack widened, but the case didn’t give. She heard voices approaching. Sweat formed on her forehead. With a wild, desperate energy, she swung again. Still nothing.

But the fourth time, the case exploded. Tiny shards peppered the room. Chloe shielded her eyes. When she opened them, the diamond was gone. She raced around the podium and found it lying in a pile of glass. In one motion, she snatched it, slipped it into a velvet bag, and made for the center of the room.

“Up!” she yelled to Emma.

The rope tightened, and Chloe began climbing. Hand over hand. Like a machine. She had trained so hard for this, and now she felt unstoppable.

At the top, Chloe scrambled onto the rooftop. In thirty seconds, Emma had disassembled the belay system. They raced back across the ledge, with Emma leading.

Suddenly, Chloe’s phone buzzed. Without missing a step, she slipped it out of her pocket and side-eyed the screen. It was Theo. *Where are you?!?*

She slid the phone back into her pocket without replying.  

**Part 3**

*9:13 a.m.*

Emma hardly survived the journey to the entry point. She had lived her whole life in the sky; she was no stranger to risk. But this was different. This was illegal. Now she could hardly walk straight.

“Careful,” Chloe encouraged when Emma made it to the chimney. “You okay?”

Emma took a deep breath. She nodded towards Chloe. “You ready?” she asked.

Chloe nodded, and Emma swung into action. Setting up the belay system was like coming home to a warm hug. Today felt foreign and menacing, but the gear was her comfort. And she understood it perfectly. In seconds, the system was ready.

Chloe leaned over the glass dome. Once she jumped, it would be chaos. Emma glanced around. She saw the rooftops. The belay system. The museum’s glass dome. Masks and tools. How on earth did she end up here?

She remembered the envelope. Bulky and unmarked, it slipped through her mail slot one faceless morning. There was cash inside – so much cash – and a cell phone. The phone rang. A man’s voice greeted her. He seemed to know everything about her and promised a job that would make all her problems go away. She remembered how disconcerting that was, how exposed she had felt. But the money was real. Guarded but curious, she stayed on the line. And now she was here.

The shrill alarm ripped her back to the present. Emma desperately pulled on the rope, slowing Chloe’s fall. Then she felt the rope slack, signaling Chloe had made it down.

Alone, Emma shuddered. It felt like the alarm had grabbed her shoulders and was shaking her violently. It seemed to scream to the world: “She’s over here!”

Ten seconds felt like ten minutes. Emma’s eyes flickered to the streets below. She hoped no one was looking back. It would only take one video, one post, and she’d be done.  

Suddenly, the rope tightened. A few seconds later, Chloe crawled onto the roof. In an instant, Emma disassembled the belay system. Soon she was sprinting back across the narrow ledge.

The path was crooked, but Emma ran without thinking. She sprinted past a giant HVAC system, skipped over a gutter, and bounded down some steps. The alarm wasn’t so deafening now. At the edge of the rooftop was a fire escape. Emma hopped onto the first step. The steel mesh rattled and groaned.

She descended to the upper story window and crawled inside. The apartment was empty. The old wooden floor was swept clean, and the white walls were spotless. Emma bounded towards the door, the boards creaking under her feet. As she grasped the handle, she felt a hand on her shoulder. She turned around.

“Hey,” Chloe said. “It’s okay.”

Chloe took a deep, slow breath, her shoulders rising and then falling. Emma gave a tired smile and copied her partner.

“Remember, slow and steady,” Chloe said, and nodded reassuringly. Emma nodded back.

Then she opened the door.

The hallway was empty. Emma started left, fighting hard to control her pace. Chloe followed behind.

“How was the movie?” Chloe asked.

“It was awesome. Leo is so hot!” Emma responded. She cringed inside at this fake conversation. But it was part of the plan, intended to deflect suspicion. Even this short jaunt down the hallway had been meticulously scripted.

They continued their charade until they reached the end of the passage. Here, they entered a stairwell. Their footsteps echoed off the walls as they descended. When they reached the bottom, Emma pushed through the door.

They stepped into a dark, underground garage. It was packed full of cars but completely empty of people. A dingy yellow light threw a faint glow onto the concrete. The air smelled musty and toxic. In the distance, Emma heard sirens and the sound of squeaking tires.

“What now?” Emma asked.

As if on cue, a man stepped toward them. It was like he had materialized out of thin air. His face was completely concealed by a surgical mask and oversized hoodie. Emma jumped backwards into Chloe.

“Where’s the diamond?” he asked.

“She has it!” Emma pointed at Chloe.

“Where’s the money?” Chloe asked.

Quickly, the man reached into his coat and pulled out two envelopes.

“Open them,” Chloe ordered.

The man quickly flipped them open to reveal thick stacks of bills. “Where’s the diamond?” he asked again.

Chloe produced the black velvet bag and handed it to him.

He peeked inside. Then he reached inside. “Oh,” he said in wonder. His voice trailed off.

“Money?” Chloe pressed him.

The man quickly snapped the drawstrings shut and dropped the bag into his inside coat pocket. Then he tossed one envelope to Emma, and a second to Chloe. Emma almost dropped hers.

“Can I go?” she asked. She didn’t even look inside her envelope.

“Yes,” the man said. “Good luck.”

She hadn’t expected that. From the moment he recruited her, he had been extremely demanding, requiring total commitment. The abrupt farewell startled her. “That’s all?” she asked.

“Yes. Go.” he said again.

Emma slowly stepped past him, as if he would snatch her back at any moment. Then, after a few steps, she took off running.

*Four minutes earlier.*

Theo stood in the middle of the jewelry gallery, his eyes empty with shock. Smashed glass lay strewn all around him.  Someone was unspooling yellow crime scene tape. Radios cracked. It felt like his brain and organs had run away and the only thing left was his skin and bone, stranded on the museum floor. Just like the diamond, his pride and career had vanished before his eyes.

Suddenly, the burner vibrated in his back pocket. He grabbed it and read Chloe’s message: *Place Notre Dame du Mont. Underground garage. Hurry.*

His heart jumped, and in an instant, his mind was clear. Le Fantôme was his prize again!

“Follow me!” he shouted to the closest officers he could find.

As they raced together towards the exit, he grabbed the microphone on his lapel.

“Place Notre Dame du Mont. Underground Garage. All units. *Now!*”

**Part 4**

Chloe watched Emma flee into the parking garage. Soon, she disappeared behind a distant row of cars. Her footsteps echoed for a moment more and then melted away.

Chloe turned back to the man in front of her – the mastermind who had orchestrated everything. His gaze remained fixed on her from underneath his bulky hoodie.

“Good luck,” he said, and began to turn away.

“Wait!” Chloe called out. The garage was still deathly silent, and the sirens outside seemed a world away. She needed to stall. Opening the envelope he had just given her, she said, “I need to make sure it’s all here.”

She began to thumb through the bills.

The man looked at her, then back across the garage towards the exit, then back to her again. The wailing sirens outside seemed just a bit crisper. “No,” he stated, “it’ll take too long.”

“You could have cheated me,” Chloe said. “I’m not leaving ‘till I count it.”

The sirens blared louder.

“You’ll have to trust me,” he said. “Good luck.”

He turned to go, then stopped. Suddenly, the sirens were right outside. He tensed, and scanned the garage, looking for options. A line of patrol cars rumbled down the ramp at the far end. Flashing red and blue pierced the darkness. Screaming sirens pounded their ears.

“How?” he muttered under his breath. He bolted left.

“Here! Quick!” Chloe called.

The man turned. She was standing next to a utility van. The driver’s door was open.

He bolted towards her. She got into the driver’s side; he jumped into the passenger seat. They closed the doors, and the cab muffled the shrill sirens.

“Where’s the key?” he asked, as he pulled the hoodie down further over his eyes.

“It’s not my van,” she responded.

“You don’t have the key. What are we doing here?”

“We’ve got no chance out there,” she said. “I’m improvising. We’re utility service workers now. Take off your mask.”

He growled. But slowly, he peeled off his surgical mask.

“Hoodie,” she said curtly.

With similar reluctance, he pulled back the fabric to fully reveal himself. He was probably in his late thirties. His hair was dark and ruffled. But what stood out most to Chloe was his eyes. They were dark and intelligent. They darted back and forth, scanning her, and the van, and the garage. He was always thinking, planning, scheming.

Chloe realized she was probably the first cop to ever see his face.

The garage was now infested with police. Two dozen patrol cars rolled through the aisles. Dozens more officers combed the area on foot. The air was thick with squeaking tires, yelling officers, wailing sirens. Just fifteen feet ahead, two uniformed men methodically checked every vehicle on the opposite aisle. A patrol car turned down their row. Its headlights shined across their cab, momentarily blinding them. Chloe felt the man tense. The car rolled past their parking spot without stopping, but it was clear they were living on borrowed time.

“Okay, let’s hide the diamond and cash,” Chloe said. “We’ll give ourselves up, pretend to be witnesses. They’ll question us and let us go. When everything dies down, we’ll come back. It’s our best chance.”

The man didn’t respond. His eyes flickered across the garage. She could tell he didn’t love the idea. But the two uniformed officers were right across the aisle now.

“I’m not leaving the diamond,” he said.

“How are we going to explain it when they search you?” she asked.

He growled again, then took the velvet bag out of his pocket. He fingered the soft cloth for a moment. Slowly, he reached down and maneuvered the diamond under his seat. All the while, Chloe watched him. Then she stuffed her cash envelope under her seat.

They looked at each other.

“Ready?” she asked.

He nodded. Chloe clicked open her door. Immediately the officers noticed. They pulled their guns.

“On the ground!” one of them yelled.

The man waved his hands above his head and dropped to his knees. It seemed a dozen officers swarmed him from out of nowhere. In an instant, he was theirs.

\_\_

Theo stared through the one-way glass at the man sitting in the cold interrogation room. He hunched in his chair. His wrists were handcuffed to the metal table. His face was long and empty.

Theo smiled and breathed a deep sigh. Now, he would demand respect. What deference they’d give him in Paris! All he needed was the confession.

Theo grabbed a file and headed toward the entrance of the interrogation room. At the door, he paused. For a moment, he tried to memorize everything – the sounds, the smells, the temperature. His thoughts.

Finally, Theo rotated the handle and stepped inside. The man turned his head. His expression remained blank. Theo circled in front of him and threw the folder onto the table. It landed with a smack.

“I’ll be brief,” Theo began. “We can already link you to the Paris Lockbox job with DNA evidence.”

He paused for effect.

“That was ten years ago, now,” he continued. “Back then, you were doing everything yourself. Not so clever.”

He paused again. Then, he continued.

“Based on that little excursion alone, you’re eligible for twenty years of free room and board at your local penitentiary! We also know you’ve been involved in numerous other crimes, and it’s only a matter of time before we come up with concrete evidence to prove it.”

The man remained silent and unmoved.

Theo leaned over the table.

“But I’m prepared to make you an offer,” he said. “Admit to all your crimes and tell us where you hid *Le Black Orlov.* In exchange, it’ll be only ten years, and we’ll drop all charges except the Paris Lockbox job.”

Theo opened the folder, and with three fingers, rotated it so the man could read it. He produced a pen and very gently set it on the table.

“All you need to do is sign,” Theo said softly.

The man looked up as if to ask: *Are you done?* Then he leaned forward and began to read. His eyes danced across the paper, processing and calculating. Minutes passed. Theo got tired of leaning over the table, so he stood up and crossed his arms. Finally, the man took a deep breath.

“Okay,” he said.

“Okay,” Theo repeated, with surprise. He hadn’t expected it to be that easy.

Slowly but deliberately, the man signed the paper. And just like that, it was done. Theo had captured Le Fantôme.

Theo felt like a dam had burst inside of him. All he wanted was to yell in victory. But with his last ounce of self-control, he held back. Instead, he pulled up a chair.

He took a deep breath, then asked, “So, where is *Le Black Orlov*?”

“I hid it in the van,” responded Le Fantôme, “under the passenger seat.”

“I know the van,” Theo began. “We searched it and didn’t find anything. Where exactly did you put it?”

“Right under the seat!” Le Fantôme exclaimed.

“What do you mean, *right under the seat*?” Theo pressed. “There was nothing under the seat.”

“Well, you didn’t look hard enough!” Le Fantôme challenged.

Theo leaned forward and narrowed his eyes. “You know, this deal doesn’t work unless you play ball.”

“Why would I lie?” Le Fantôme exclaimed.

“I don’t know,” Theo waved his hand energetically. “Maybe you’re having second thoughts.”

“Did you find the cash?” Le Fantôme asked.

“What cash?”

“Under the driver’s seat. The woman put it there. It was her payment.”

Theo stood up so powerfully that his chair wobbled backwards, scraping across the floor. “Clearly you’re not ready to talk.”

“Wait -” Le Fantôme called. But Theo was already gone.

He slammed the interrogation room door closed behind him. Waiting nearby were three officers.

“He’s all yours now,” Theo told them, with a twirl of his finger.

One of the men nodded. They slipped inside and soon reappeared with Le Fantôme in tow. The thief gave Theo one last look as he passed. It wasn’t anger. Or sorrow. It was befuddlement.

Theo watched as the officers ushered Le Fantôme down the hallway and around a corner, out of sight. In his hand was the confession. It was everything he had always wanted. But something about Le Fantôme’s last look stuck with him. Suddenly, the old, unanswered questions called out to him again, this time mixed with a new one: where was *Le Black Orlov*?

Yes, he had the confession. But did he know the truth?

Meanwhile, the officers led Le Fantôme through the station. A crowd swarmed them. Reporters yelled questions. The officers bulldozed through the chaos. Finally, they arrived at a reception desk where they paused to grab some paperwork.

The thief’s mind was spinning. He caught glimpses of the station through the crowd – desks, watercooler, conference room. Then his heart stopped. Who was that officer in the distance, talking by the coffee machine? He narrowed his eyes. It was Chloe.

Instinctively, his mouth hung open. He had wondered how they found him so quickly. Now it made sense.

Then a second thought froze him. He couldn’t believe it, but it was the only explanation. Until that van was confiscated, there were only two people who knew where the diamond and money were. Him, and her.

She had played him like a virtuoso plays the concert grand.

He supposed she’d be questioned about the diamond’s whereabouts. But who would Theo believe? Him – a serial criminal? Or her – the decorated cop who had made his capture possible?

She looked up and saw him from a distance. He nodded to her, ever so slightly. A smile played at the edges of her lips.

**Part 5**

Thirty minutes ago, Emma had been running across that rooftop, adrenaline pumping.  But now, as she walked the final steps to her apartment, the world had finally stopped shaking. The chaos was behind her. She was home.   

Emma closed her eyes and leaned into her apartment door for a moment. Then she slipped a tiny key from her pocket, clicked open the lock, and pushed inside. The hinges groaned.

It was a humble space. The kitchenette and living area were separated by only a few paces. The paint was old and stained. The wooden floors were scratched and discolored.

“Mama!” came a voice from the bedroom.

“I’m here, Thomas,” she called, and headed towards him.

As she did, she walked by a set of shelves and almost tripped over a drawer she had left open the night before. This was her bin of mementos: climbing trip schedules, souvenirs, pictures. Even her first – and only – sponsorship contract. The money was small, but the deal meant so much at the time, a promise of things to come. Now, these were only stinging reminders that she hadn’t quite been good enough. 

Outside Thomas’s door, she slipped the envelope out of her jacket and quickly flipped through the bills. Unbelievable. She’d never held this much money in her life. But she set the envelope on the counter before walking through the doorway.

Inside, Thomas lay stretched across the bed. When Emma entered, the seven-year-old smiled and set his book down.

“Are you okay?” he asked. “Where were you?”

“Yes, I’m okay,” she answered, and leaned down to give him a gentle hug. “How’s the leg?”

Thomas glanced down at his lower left leg, which was wrapped in a dirty, discolored cast. “It’s okay,” he said. “Kind of itchy.”

Emma remembered when the doctors broke the news – he had a genetic disorder that caused his bones to easily fracture. Even day-to-day living was risky. They called it “Osteogenesis Imperfecta.” To her, it sounded like a prison sentence. How, she wondered, could she be so athletic, while he was so frail?

There was no cure, but they told her it could be managed with the right treatment. The problem was the right treatment cost money. She and Leo, his father, made it work for a while. But Leo became increasingly distant and less invested. Then one day, she came home and he was gone.

Suddenly, she was alone, with a sickly child and failing career. Soon, she only had enough left to pay for a few weeks of bare necessities.  

Until that mysterious envelope slipped through her door.

Emma ran her hand through Thomas’s hair. “It’s going to be okay now,” she said. “We’re going to get your medicine.”

“Really?” he asked, and looked up at her with a deep earnestness.

“Yes, and therapy,” she smiled.

“How?” he asked, confused.

She took his hand and gently brushed it with her thumb. “Because I’m your mother,” she said.

He smiled.

She moved to the chair in the corner and sat down. Slowly, the pressure, desperation, and stress began to wash away.

Outside, people wove around each other on the sidewalk. Cars lined up in the narrow street, and someone honked impatiently. She felt like a spectator to their flurried lives.

For the first time in forever, she had nothing to do.

She looked at Thomas. “How’s the book?” she asked.

1qa9esv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1qa9esv/ive_been_tired_all_my_life/,I’ve been tired all my life,"Hello, this is my first time seeking help online because I’m having a crisis. I’m 18 years old and I’m tired all the time. This is not your usual ‘tired’ from running a long day at school or work, its a constant exhaustion. I feel like this is ruining my future, my relationships and my life. 

It all started when I was little, I wasnt as active as the kids in my class, I didn’t have the energy for extra curricular activities or to go out with friends. I would usually come from school exhausted and I would sleep for hours and waking up with headaches. 

This continued as I grew, my social life was literally inexistent. I was still a great student, I had to push myself to study, but it hasnt a heavy amount of studying so it wasnt a big deal at that time. 

When I got into high school, everything changed. My school was one hour away by bus and the bus schedule was horrible, which meant 1:40h to do nothing after school, usually freezing at the bus station in winter. I would come home exhausted, I couldnt do anything, my body would feel cold and useless. Even when I wanted to study, I couldn’t, I used to play brown noise just to concentrate but my brain was just trying to get rest. 

All my life my mom had this hatred for me because I was lazy, I didn’t do house chores and I slept all day or did nothing. When I finally told her, she told me I was just lazy. But that wasnt true, I wanted to do stuff, I wanted to be like my girl classmates that went shopping and on coffee dates with their girl friends. I got into a depression because of it, my room was a mess, I skipped school more and more often because I was too tired to wake up. I usually woke up with headaches that continued for days without stopping. 

I needed help, I wanted to get better, I wanted to go out with my boyfriend on walks, I wanted to work out to get rid of all the weight I gained from practically rotting away, I wanted to get into my dream school etc. But I couldn’t do it because I was so tired. 

I had brain fog, I usually got dizzy and my head was hurting. I couldn’t do basic things anymore, I felt like a failure. 

I went to the doctor, she said that I may have low iron, but after some tests it came back normal. After another set of tests it said I’m vitamin B12 deficient, I started taking B12 vitamins but my condition wasnt excelent, after 4 months of taking it, nothing really changed, only my headaches were less frequent. I feel like something is wrong, and its something else. My doctor told me to take the pills only for 2 months, and it will get better, but it isnt getting better… I dont know how a normal person can be energised, or do basic stuff. I lied to myself that the pills would magically work, but I feel like I’m sleeking again. I want to have a normal life, to live like a teenager, all my friends are secretly hating me because I cant go anywhere, I feel like a vegetable. I do nothing all day. It destroys my life, I put down so many hobbies because I just get burned out. 

I get burned out from everything, from reading, from studying, from paining or drawing etc. Its exhausting… I hate this life

Thank you, u/serious_morning 4887 How cool that you studied Alice in Uni! I had a pen friend who absolutely loved Alice in Wonderland since she was a kid. We chat over Messenger every once in awhile now and I'm excited to send her a picture of your card <3 thanks for the cute little goodies, too! 

Thank you, u/alluu3 for the sparkly card! I also am a huge fan of panettone! I tried some for the first time in I think 2014? My friends and I stayed up pulling all nighters for our finals essays, ate panettone and drank sooo much coffee. It's a good core memory <3

Thank you, u/hispanglotexan ! The post card with Cinnamonroll is precious, I love the Washi tape, too! Where do you find lucky cat Washi tape? 💛 12 grapes at midnight is a neat tradition! My family and I used to celebrate by drinking a whole bottle of water (for those who drank all day to try and help with a hang over) but now my wife and I celebrate by playing our favorite game into the New Year. This year it was Brotato. 

Thank you u/ah_si_lan (Ah_Si_Len per chance?) x2. Thank you for the lovely post card for my partner Hannah - she recently lost connection to her old Reddit account and was feeling very sad, so when I saw Lego postcards I knew I had to cheer her up. She's so grateful and the smile upon her face when seeing this filled me with so much joy. She and I are planning to get each other Lego succulents for Valentine's Day <3 
Thank you also for the beautiful card for me! It's so colorful and perfect! I especially love the tuxedo cat as I had one before I moved out West. It's beautiful, and we are both so grateful <3

Thank you u/RegunaBeatle for the fun Lego card!

My favorite scent? Cranberries and vanilla (I think? It's the Mad About You Scent from bath and body works!) but I also really like Lavender and Vanilla scents 

Thank you, u/raveuzsnow for the beautiful Happy New Year postcard. The snowy mountains, the moon... It's beautiful, thank you!

A few years ago we all started sharing our live locations mostly for safety. At first it felt fine, like if someone got stranded or didnt answer texts. No big deal.



Over time it started feeling less safe and more like surveillance. My mom would text asking why i was at the grocery store so late. My sister would joke about how often i go to the same coffee place. My dad once asked why i drove to a different neighborhood than usual after work. None of it was angry, just constant little comments that made me feel watched.



I tried hinting that it made me uncomfortable. They all brushed it off saying its normal and they arent checking that often. Last month i took a spontaneous day off work and went to a nearby town to just walk around and clear my head. My mom called asking why i wasnt at work and if something was wrong. That kinda snapped something in me.



I turned off location sharing without announcing it. Within hours i got messages asking if my phone was broken. I said no and explained i dont want my movements tracked anymore, i am fine and will still text if im traveling or need help. My family reacted badly. They said i am being dramatic, secretive, and that this is how families stay connected now.



My sister said if something happens to me it will be my fault. My mom cried and said it feels like i am pushing everyone away. I honestly just want some privacy and to feel like an adult. I still call them, visit, and check in. I just dont want a map of my life open 24 7.

Tuesday morning I woke feeling extremely fatigued. I'm normally fatigued since I have immune system issues. But, this was another level. One of my favorite things of the day is my morning coffee. I made myself a cup and upon finishing it I knew I was going to vomit. I rushed to the sink, throwing up in my mouth on route, and made it. I vomited every ounce into the sink. And kept on dry heaving. I felt absolutely terrible.


I don't have a cough, just a massive headache and sore muscles/joints. I have zero appetite, even just thinking about food makes me nauseous. I take hydration powders every day (potassium/magnesium/etc). I doubled the amount and ordered some high potency stuff. And have been taking some of those Emergen-C packets with vitamins etc. At least once a day with a few ounces of water.


Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday I hadn't eaten anything. I did drink at least 40 ounces of water (with my hydration powders) every day and this seemed to keep the headaches to mild and not blistering. I was probably dehydrated.

I am too weak to drive safely so on Friday I ordered some bread and butter from safeway. I had a slice of toast with my water. I kept it down. Yesterday I had a slice around noon with butter. Then another slice around 6PM.


I have no idea what's going on. I am fatigued but not as bad as Tue/Wed/Thurs/Friday. The headache is now minimal.


Also, I got my flu shot and covid booster in October last year.

Today was nuts. There was only me and my shift lead on the floor. I was solo bar. The regular complained about his coffee not having “any cream” (I put extra cream in his coffee). For context - this regular is incredibly rude. I direct him to the carafes on the counter as I’ve got 20 drinks in the queue. 
I go back to making my drinks, I look over, and I see him reaching over the bar and PUMPING HONEY BLEND SYRUP INTO HIS DRINK (I thought the issue was cream ????). I take the syrup from him and say “This is inappropriate and also not food safe, do not do this again” AND HE JUST LAUGHS AT ME. My shift lead was ready to say something but didn’t get the chance to because I’d already handled it and the customer had already walked away, they also didn’t see the incident with the syrup.

Y’all what do I do?! This interaction really got under my skin. I hate that I have to be all smiles when I see him. I’m wondering if I should bring it up to my manager?! Helppp",4,1768161438.0,starbucksbaristas,1,1.0,False

1qa990s,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qa990s,No Longer Evil success then No Loger Working so well....,"Hello, in late Nov/early Dec I managed to flash my Nest Gen 2 using a the NLE software on a Mac and setting up NLE on my Android phone.
I was really impressed that everything worked well, not quite as fluid as the official Nest app, but perfectly functional and I got a coffee Cody.

As of now though, whilst my Nest still works locally when you spin the dial, I can no longer control it via my phone or computer.

Here's what I have tried:

- Resetting the Nest thermostat
- Trying to get a new access code to which I receive the message on the thermostat saying ""There was a problem connecting to the service. Please try again later""
- Connecting the thermostat back up to my Mac and trying to flash it again with the NLE software. This resulted in ""Installation Failed"" and ""failed to claim interface 0: Error: LIBUSB_ERROR_NO_DEVICE"".
- I tried several USB cables in case any of them had an issue.
- Took the thermostat off the wall and placed it in front of the fireplace for a few mins so that it believed the temperature was high and so I could see if it were transmitting the house inside temperature back to my phone through the app. The thermostat got up to about 30 degrees centigrade but the app remained at 8.8 degrees centigrade.
-I have checked the Nest thermostat is connected to my WiFi and it does control the radiators when you spin the dial manually.

I believe I have exhausted all steps a 'typical user' would. If anyone can see where I may have made a mistake or know what I could do to get my thermostat working via the app again I'd appreciate it. ",1,1768161384.0,Nest,1,1.0,False

I finally learned how to cook a steak so it gets a crust on top, and trying not to be afraid of using my Polychromos(es?) this week.

Life's been all right lately actually, if severely lacking in whimsy. See, I've always wanted a pen pal from Blighty.  Maybe for the unerring practicality, some innate frugality. I do love the taste of lemon curd on toast and clouds of milk in my cold brew for breakfast though. Actually, now that I've got you, explain to me why colorful umbrellas are somehow implicitly illegal in London? And what's up with preferring a skirt and tights to jeans? I mean, I know tea is bigger than coffee thanks to a certain duchess who made it popular. Builder's tea is supreme!

By the end of the year I'd like to recognize myself as one tough broad so I'd like your help in that.

I'm 30 soon. What do you say we write each other once a month like we're in the Edwardian era? Makes everything a bit more interesting to read if it has a theme.

I love a good historical drama, from 45RPM to HOTD. Soft spot for documentaries from the BBC. We can debate between Lucy Worsley and David Starkey if you like.

I've kept a journal since I was eight. (B6 and a Pilot Precise V5 forever!) Nothing pretty, just a record of my life, full of precious minute details.

I did some DIY last summer, dyeing clothes, and I guess it unlocked my crafty side because now I want to match everything to my color season, make my cold brew concentrate at home after this bottle is done with, and generally do everything I can to be frugal.

If you're a movie buff too, I'd be glad to know you. I'm still mad I missed Ballerina in theaters last year even though I paid to watch it at home later. I could spend HOURS talking about the construction/ symbolism of the costumes.

PART TWO:

The second body came down from the mountain at dawn.

Maya watched from the observation deck as the recovery team descended the Western Cwm, moving slowly in the thin air. The thermal sled between them glowed orange in the tracking system, another corpse becoming cargo, another death becoming data.

This one was different. This one had been reaching toward home.

“Subject JOHANSEN arriving in thirty minutes,” Yuki’s voice crackled over the radio. “Do you want to observe extraction?”

Maya keyed her mic. “I’ll be there.”

Behind her, in the quarantine wing, Harlan Graves sat in his room and refused to speak to anyone. Three days since revival. Three days of silence broken only by meals he didn’t eat and questions he didn’t answer. The psychological team called it “temporal dissociation.” Maya called it grief.

She couldn’t blame him. But she also couldn’t fix it.

\-----

Isak Johansen’s body looked different from Harlan’s even before they opened the preservation sled.

“No artificial preservation,” Dawa reported, scanning the corpse with a handheld ultrasound. “Natural freezing, rapid temperature drop, minimal cellular disruption. It’s almost perfect.”

“Almost?” Maya asked.

“His face.” Dawa stepped back.

Maya looked closer. Most frozen bodies locked into their death expression, pain, fear, exhaustion. Isak’s face was peaceful, but not empty. There was something around his eyes, the set of his jaw. Not acceptance. Recognition.

“He knew he was dying,” Maya said quietly.

“Most of them do.”

“No. He knew he was dying and he was okay with it.” She traced the line of his extended arm, still pointing downslope. “Run the full preservation scan. I want to know why he survived intact when every model says he shouldn’t have.”

\-----

The answer came six hours later, and it made no sense.

“His cells are better preserved than Graves’s,” Peter said, displaying the microscopy results in the lab. “Not just better, significantly better. Less ice crystal damage, more intact cellular membranes, almost no protein degradation. It’s like his body froze perfectly.”

Maya studied the data. “That’s impossible. Graves had professional cryopreservation, controlled cooling, cryoprotectants, optimized protocols. Johansen just… died in the snow.”

“I know what the data says. I’m telling you what the cells show.”

“Then the data is wrong.”

“Or our assumptions are.” Peter pulled up a comparison chart. “Look at the neural tissue. Graves has significant hippocampal damage—memory structures compromised, emotional processing centers showing degradation. Johansen’s brain is nearly pristine.”

Maya felt something cold settle in her stomach. “If his brain is intact, that means—”

“He might revive with full cognitive function. Full memory. Full emotional continuity.” Peter met her eyes. “He might wake up feeling like he just closed his eyes thirty-five years ago.”

“That’s worse. That’s so much worse than Harlan’s revival.”

“Why?”

“Because Harlan lost his context gradually. He had cancer, he had time to prepare, he said goodbye. He knew he was gambling on a future. But Johansen?” Maya gestured at the data. “He was climbing Everest. He summited. He took photos at the top of the world, probably the best moment of his life, and then he died trying to go home. He didn’t choose this. He didn’t prepare for it. He just… stopped.”

“And if we bring him back?”

“Then we’re resurrecting someone who successfully summited Everest only to die in the descent. We’re telling him he didn’t make it home after all.”

Peter was quiet for a moment. “Do we tell him before revival? Or after?”

“Neither,” Maya said. “We don’t tell him anything. We let him wake up and draw his own conclusions. We give him truth, not management.”

“That’s cruel.”

“Resurrection is cruel. We’re just deciding how honest to be about it.”

\-----

They revived Isak Johansen at 0600 the next morning, on schedule, with the same protocols they’d used for Harlan. But from the first moment of consciousness, everything was different.

He didn’t scream. He opened his eyes, looked at the ceiling, and said: “I’m not dead.”

Not a question. A statement of surprised fact.

“Mr. Johansen,” Yuki said, moving into his field of vision. “My name is Dr. Tanaka. You’re in a medical facility. You’ve been in cryogenic preservation for—”

“How long?”

“Thirty-five years.”

Isak blinked. Processed. His eyes were the color of glacier ice. “I summited. May 3rd, 2034. Weather window. Perfect visibility.” He looked at his hands, flexed his fingers experimentally. “I remember taking photos. I remember descending. I remember…” He trailed off.

“What do you remember?” Maya asked, leaning forward.

“Running out of oxygen. My vision narrowing. Sitting down because I was too tired to walk.” He met her eyes. “I remember accepting it. I remember thinking: this is where I stop. And I was okay with that.”

The room went silent.

“You remember dying?” Peter asked.

“I remember making peace with dying. Then nothing. Then this.” Isak looked around the revival chamber, taking in the medical equipment, the monitors, the faces of strangers. “So either I’m hallucinating as my brain shuts down, or you people did something impossible.”

Maya pulled up a chair. “We did something impossible. And we need you to understand what that means.”

She told him everything. The Continuity Project. The revival protocols. The forty-two years that passed while he was frozen. She told him about the other bodies on Everest, about Harlan Graves in quarantine, about the debate over resurrection ethics that had consumed governments and philosophers for a decade.

Isak listened without interrupting. When she finished, he was quiet for a long time.

“Do you have photos?” he asked finally.

“Of what?”

“The summit. My camera. Did anyone recover it?”

Peter consulted his tablet. “We have your personal effects in storage. Including a camera. The photos were corrupted by freezing, but we might be able to reconstruct—”

“Don’t.” Isak closed his eyes. “I don’t need to see them. I remember. That’s enough.”

“Mr. Johansen,” Yuki said gently, “we understand this is disorienting. We have psychological support available, counseling services, temporal integration—”

“I don’t need therapy. I need to know why you did this.”

“Because we could,” Maya said. “Because the technology exists, and people argued that meant we had an obligation to use it. Because there are thousands of people in cryostorage who died hoping someone would bring them back.”

“And me? I didn’t choose this. I didn’t pay for it. I died climbing a mountain because that’s what I chose to do.”

“We know. You’re what we call an ‘accidental preservation case.’ We revived you as a control—to compare outcomes between people who chose cryonics and people who froze naturally.”

“So I’m a science experiment.”

“You’re a person,” Maya said. “But yes, your revival will help us understand whether commercial cryopreservation actually works better than natural freezing. And so far, the answer is surprising.”

“What answer?”

“You’re better preserved than Harlan Graves. Your cellular integrity is higher, your neural structures are more intact. You should be a disaster—no preparation, no optimization, just a body that froze on a mountain. But you’re…” Maya struggled for the word. “Whole. You’re more whole than he is.”

Isak opened his eyes. “Because I accepted it.”

“What?”

“You said he had cancer. He fought it. He paid $200,000 to avoid dying. He resisted until the end.” Isak looked at his hands again. “I didn’t resist. When my oxygen ran out and I knew I wasn’t going to make it, I sat down and I let go. I made peace with stopping. Maybe that’s why my body preserved better—because I wasn’t fighting it when I froze.”

Peter glanced at Maya. “That’s… actually consistent with the cellular data. Stress hormones, cortisol, adrenaline—they all cause tissue damage during the dying process. If you were calm, if you’d accepted it…”

“Then my cells died gently,” Isak finished. “And maybe that made all the difference.”

Maya felt the implications cascade through her mind. If acceptance improved preservation outcomes, then the entire cryonics industry was built on a false premise. They’d been telling people to fight death, to resist, to pay for immortality. But maybe the secret to successful resurrection was simpler: let go.

“Mr. Johansen,” she said carefully, “if what you’re suggesting is true—if acceptance improves preservation—then we need to test it. We have two more subjects scheduled for revival: Elizabeth Renko and Victor Salazar. Both commercial cryopreservations. Both people who fought their deaths. If they show more degradation than you do, then we’ve discovered something fundamental about the resurrection process.”

“And if they show less?”

“Then your preservation was a statistical anomaly. A lucky accident.”

Isak smiled faintly. “Thirty-five years ago, I summited Everest. That felt like a lucky accident too. Maybe I’m just the kind of person who survives the impossible.”

\-----

They moved Isak to a private room in the residential wing—not quarantine like Harlan, but not freedom either. Observation. Documentation. He didn’t seem to mind. He spent most of his time at the window, staring at Everest’s peak, thirty kilometers distant but clearly visible in the thin Himalayan air.

Maya found him there on his second day, standing motionless, hands pressed against the glass.

“How does it feel?” she asked. “Seeing it again?”

“Strange. I remember it being bigger. More hostile.” He didn’t turn around. “Now it just looks like a mountain. Like geography, not mythology.”

“Maybe because you already beat it.”

“Or because I died on it, and dying removes mystery.” He glanced at her. “Have you climbed?”

“No. I don’t have the temperament for it.”

“What temperament is that?”

“The kind that accepts you might not come back.”

Isak laughed quietly. “Is that what you think climbing is? Acceptance of death?”

“Isn’t it?”

“No. It’s acceptance of risk. There’s a difference.” He turned from the window. “When I climbed Everest, I knew I might die. But I didn’t climb \*to\* die. I climbed because standing on top of the world was worth the risk of not standing anywhere ever again. That’s not the same as surrendering.”

Maya considered this. “But when you ran out of oxygen—when you sat down in the snow—you did surrender then.”

“I accepted that I’d lost the gamble. That’s not surrender. That’s…” He searched for the word. “Honesty. I’d risked everything, and the mountain won. So I stopped fighting and let it happen. What else could I do?”

“You could have kept crawling. Kept trying. People have survived in the death zone for hours, sometimes days—”

“People have also destroyed themselves trying to survive what couldn’t be survived. Turning your death into torture because you refuse to acknowledge it’s happening.” Isak shook his head. “I didn’t want that. So I sat down, and I watched the sun set over Tibet, and I thought: this is a good place to stop.”

“And now you’re here.”

“And now I’m here,” he agreed. “Thirty-five years later, having the same conversation I would have had if I’d survived naturally. Telling a stranger why I climbed a mountain that killed me. Except now the mountain didn’t kill me. You people did something impossible, and I’m alive to talk about it.” He met her eyes. “Do you understand how strange that is? How wrong it feels? Not the being alive part—that feels normal. But knowing I should be dead, that I was dead, and someone decided that wasn’t acceptable. Someone rewrote reality, and I’m the proof.”

Maya felt the weight of his words. This was what she’d been afraid of: not that resurrection would fail, but that it would succeed and create people who understood exactly how unnatural their existence was.

“Are you angry?” she asked.

Isak thought about it. “No. Confused, maybe. Grateful, possibly. But not angry. Anger would require believing I had some right to stay dead, and I don’t know if I believe that. Life happened to me once, then death happened, now life is happening again. Maybe I’m just along for the ride.”

“That’s a remarkably zen perspective for someone who died on Everest.”

“Mountains teach you zen, or they kill you. Sometimes both.”

Maya smiled despite herself. She’d expected trauma, resistance, existential crisis. Instead she’d found acceptance—the same quality that had preserved him so perfectly in ice. Maybe he was right. Maybe some people were just built to survive the impossible.

“I need to ask you something,” she said. “And I need you to answer honestly.”

“Okay.”

“When you were frozen—when you were dead—was there anything? Any awareness, any experience? Or was it just nothing?”

Isak’s expression changed. Something flashed behind his eyes—not quite fear, but recognition of something fearful.

“Why do you ask?”

“Because Harlan—the other revival subject—he’s not integrating well. He’s depressed, non-communicative. And one of our theories is that dying traumatizes consciousness in ways we don’t understand. That being dead might leave… traces.”

“Traces,” Isak repeated. “Like memories of not existing?”

“Yes. Exactly that.”

Isak looked back at the mountain. “There wasn’t anything. No dreams, no awareness, no sense of time passing. I closed my eyes in 2034 and opened them three days ago, and there was nothing between those moments. Just discontinuity.” He paused. “But.”

Maya waited.

“But when I first woke up, before I understood what had happened, there was this feeling. Not a memory—a feeling. Like I’d been waiting for something, and it had finally arrived. Like I’d been holding my breath for thirty-five years and could finally exhale.” He turned back to her. “Does that make sense?”

“No,” Maya said honestly. “But that doesn’t mean it’s not real.”

“Maybe dying changes you. Not your memories or your body, but something deeper. Your relationship to being alive. And maybe that’s what’s wrong with Harlan—not that he remembers being dead, but that he remembers choosing death, and now he has to live with that choice.”

“He chose resurrection. He paid for it.”

“He chose to \*avoid\* death. That’s not the same as choosing to live again. And now he’s stuck in a future he didn’t want, with a life he didn’t ask for, and no way to undo it.” Isak’s voice was gentle. “You should let him talk to me.”

“Why?”

“Because I died the same way he did—badly. But I made peace with it, and maybe I can help him make peace too. Or maybe I can’t. But keeping him isolated isn’t helping anyone.”

Maya considered this. The psychological team had recommended continued quarantine for Harlan until his mood stabilized. But maybe isolation was the problem. Maybe he needed to see that resurrection wasn’t uniform—that someone else had woken up and found a way to accept it.

“I’ll think about it,” she said.

“Think fast. Because if he’s anything like I imagine, he’s in that room right now trying to figure out how to die a second time. And if you wait too long, he’ll succeed.”

\-----

That night, Maya reviewed Harlan’s medical records. Heart rate elevated. Sleep patterns disrupted. Refusing meals. Refusing conversation. Refusing engagement with reality.

Peter had been right: this was cruel.

But cruelty implied choice, and they hadn’t chosen this. The technology existed. The bodies existed. The ethical argument had already been won by the people who’d funded the research. All Maya and her team were doing was executing the protocol.

Except protocol didn’t account for this: a man so thoroughly destroyed by his own resurrection that he was trying to die again.

She sent a message to Yuki: Authorize contact between Graves and Johansen. Supervised. Tomorrow morning.

Then she sent another message to James: We need to pause the revival schedule. We’re missing something.

His response came immediately: What are we missing?

Maya stared at her screen, trying to articulate the unease that had been building since Isak’s revival.

We’re resurrecting bodies, but we’re not bringing back people. We’re creating something new—something that remembers being someone else. And I don’t think we understand the difference yet.

James’s reply took longer this time:

The board wants results. We revive Renko and Salazar next week, or we lose funding. No pause.

Maya closed her laptop and went to the window. Outside, Everest rose against the stars—permanent, indifferent, lethal. They’d come here to conquer death in the place where death had the most power.

But maybe death wasn’t the enemy. Maybe the enemy was resurrection without understanding what it cost.

She thought about Isak, standing at his window, looking at the mountain that had killed him. Calm. Whole. Accepting.

And she thought about Harlan, sitting in quarantine, refusing to accept anything.

Two men. Two resurrections. Two completely different outcomes.

Tomorrow, they’d meet. And Maya would learn whether resurrection could be taught, or whether some people were simply too broken by death to survive being alive again.

\-----

The observation room adjoined both private quarters, separated by a one-way mirror and enough monitoring equipment to map every microexpression. Maya watched as Yuki escorted Harlan through the door, his movements careful, like someone navigating a space that might collapse.

He’d lost weight. Three weeks since revival, and his body hadn’t adjusted to being alive. The psychological team called it “somatic rejection”, a term that sounded scientific but meant nothing. His body was giving up because his mind had already quit.

Isak was already there, sitting at the simple table, hands folded. He’d been awake for twelve days and looked healthier than most people at altitude. Calm. Present. Undamaged.

“Mr. Graves,” Yuki said gently, “this is Isak Johansen. He was revived a week after you. We thought you might like to—”

“I know why you brought me here.” Harlan’s voice was flat. “You want him to fix me. You want him to explain how he’s handling this so well, so I’ll start eating and pretending this is fine.” He looked at Isak. “I’m not interested in inspiration.”

Isak nodded. “Good. I’m not interested in giving it.”

Harlan blinked. “What?”

“You heard me. I’m not here to make you feel better about being resurrected. I’m here because Dr. Sarkar thinks we should talk, and I’m curious whether a man who paid $200,000 to avoid dying is as miserable as he looks.”

In the observation room, Peter winced. “This is going to be a disaster.”

“Or,” Maya said quietly, “it’s going to be honest.”

\-----

Harlan sat down slowly. “You’re the accidental preservation. The climber.”

“I’m Isak. I climbed Everest in 2034 and died on the descent. They found my body and brought me back because they wanted to see if people like you—people who paid to freeze—actually preserved better than people who just froze naturally.” He paused. “Turns out you don’t. I’m in better shape than you are, and I died on a mountain without any preparation. How does that make you feel?”

“Like I wasted $200,000.”

“Did you?”

Harlan’s hands clenched. “I paid for a chance to live in a future where medicine could cure my cancer. Where my daughter might still be alive, or at least where I’d wake up to something resembling continuity. Instead I woke up forty-two years later, everyone I loved is dead, and I’m legally a non-person. So yes, I wasted it.”

“You wasted it because you expected the wrong thing,” Isak said. “You paid for resurrection, but what you really wanted was restoration. You wanted everything back. Your life, your context, your world. But that was never possible. Death doesn’t pause reality—it continues without you. You knew that when you signed the contract.”

“I knew intellectually. I didn’t understand it. There’s a difference.”

“You’re right. Understanding comes after. Like right now.” Isak leaned forward. “So now you understand. Now you know that death took everything from you except consciousness. What are you going to do about it?”

“Die again, if they’d let me.”

“Why won’t they?”

Harlan looked startled. “What?”

“You keep saying ‘if they’d let me.’ Why won’t they? You’re not in prison. You’re not incapacitated. If you wanted to die, you could walk out that door, take the elevator to the roof, and step off. It’s a three-story drop onto rock. Quick. Certain. Why haven’t you?”

In the observation room, Maya’s heart stopped. “Jesus Christ, is he giving him ideas?”

“Or,” Yuki said slowly, “he’s asking why Harlan hasn’t done what Harlan’s already thought about a thousand times. He’s calling the bluff.”

\-----

Harlan’s hands were shaking. “Because.”

“Because why?”

“Because I’m a coward. Because I already died once and it terrified me, and the idea of doing it again, of choosing it this time—” His voice broke. “I don’t want to die. I just don’t want to be alive like this.”

“Then stop being alive like this.”

“It’s not that simple—”

“It is exactly that simple.” Isak’s voice was gentle but uncompromising. “You’re alive. You have approximately forty years left, maybe more. You can spend them mourning what you lost, or you can spend them building something new. But you can’t do both. And you can’t stay frozen in this grief forever.”

“You make it sound easy.”

“It’s not easy. It’s simple. There’s a difference.” Isak stood, walked to the window. “When I was dying on Everest, I had a choice. Keep crawling, destroy myself trying to survive, die in agony. Or sit down, accept it, and let it happen peacefully. I chose peace. And maybe that’s why I preserved better—because I wasn’t fighting when I froze.”

“So what, I’m supposed to just accept this? Accept that I paid a fortune to wake up in hell?”

“No. You’re supposed to accept that you’re alive, and alive means choice. You can choose misery, or you can choose something else. But you can’t choose to be the person you were forty-two years ago. That person is gone. You’re what’s left.”

Harlan was silent for a long time. “I don’t know who that is.”

“Neither do I. I died a mountaineer and woke up… something else. Someone who remembers summiting Everest but didn’t actually do it—the person who did that died thirty-five years ago. I’m just the sequel.” He turned back from the window. “And maybe that’s okay. Maybe being a sequel isn’t worse than being an original. Just different.”

“A sequel to my own life,” Harlan repeated. “That’s what you think we are?”

“What else could we be? We have their memories, their bodies, their names. But we’re not them. We’re copies that started running after a forty-year gap. New instances of old people.”

In the observation room, Maya felt something cold settle in her chest. “He’s right. Jesus, he’s completely right.”

Peter looked at her. “What do you mean?”

“Continuity of consciousness is what makes you you. If you go to sleep and wake up, you’re the same person because there’s an unbroken thread of experience. But if you die—if consciousness stops completely and then starts again decades later—you’re not the same person. You’re a new person with access to the old person’s memories.”

“That’s philosophy, not science.”

“It’s both. And if it’s true, then we haven’t resurrected anyone. We’ve created people who think they’re resurrections.”

\-----

In the meeting room, Harlan had his head in his hands. “If I’m not Harlan Graves, then who am I?”

“You’re whoever you choose to be. That’s the gift of discontinuity—you can start over. No one expects you to be the same person you were. You can’t be. So be someone new.”

“I don’t want to be someone new. I want to be me.”

“Then be you—the you that exists now, not the you that died forty-two years ago. That version is gone. But this version is alive, and conscious, and capable of making choices. Start there.”

Harlan looked up, eyes red. “What choice would you make? If you were me?”

Isak thought about it. “I’d walk outside. I’d look at Everest—the mountain that killed me. And I’d decide whether I was going to spend the rest of my life being defined by that death, or whether I was going to find something else to live for.” He paused. “And then I’d probably get some decent coffee, because the stuff here is terrible.”

Harlan laughed. It sounded broken, but it was a laugh.

“The coffee is terrible,” he agreed.

“So that’s a start. Tomorrow: we find better coffee. After that, we figure out the rest.”

“That’s your plan? Coffee and optimism?”

“Better than misery and surrender.” Isak extended his hand. “I’m not asking you to be happy. I’m asking you to be alive. Properly alive, not just biologically functioning. Can you do that?”

Harlan stared at the offered hand. In the observation room, Maya held her breath.

Finally, Harlan reached out and shook it.

“I can try.”

\-----

Elizabeth Renko’s body arrived three days later, and from the moment they opened the preservation chamber, everyone knew something was wrong.

“Temperature anomaly,” the technician reported. “The cryostorage facility shows consistent readings, but internal tissue scan suggests—”

“Suggests what?” Maya asked, pulling up the data.

“Partial thaw. Sometime in the last thirty years, her preservation was compromised. Not enough to destroy tissue, but enough to cause—”

“Brain damage,” Peter finished, staring at his screen. “Her hippocampus is degraded. Frontal cortex showing lesions. This isn’t preservation artifacts. This is ice crystal formation during storage.”

Maya felt her stomach drop. “How long was she compromised?”

“Unknown. Could be hours, could be days. But long enough to cause significant neural damage.”

“Can we revive her?”

“Technically, yes. Biologically she’ll wake up. But cognitively…” Peter trailed off.

“Say it.”

“She might not remember who she was. Or she might remember but not be able to form new memories. Or she might wake up and have no idea what consciousness is.” He looked at Maya. “We could be resurrecting a body with no one inside it.”

\-----

They convened an emergency ethics meeting. James, Maya, Peter, Yuki, and three board representatives via video link. The question was simple: Did they have an obligation to revive Elizabeth Renko if the outcome was likely to be catastrophic?

“She paid for revival,” one board member argued. “She signed a contract. We have a legal obligation—”

“We have an ethical obligation not to resurrect someone into a state worse than death,” Maya countered. “If she wakes up with no memory, no identity, no cognitive function, we haven’t saved her. We’ve created a confused, suffering organism with her DNA.”

“We don’t know the extent of the damage until we attempt revival.”

“Exactly. We’re gambling with someone’s consciousness.”

“We’ve been gambling with consciousness since the first revival,” James said quietly. “Harlan Graves woke up suicidal. Isak Johansen woke up psychologically intact but ontologically displaced. We never had certainty—we just had hope and technology.”

“This is different,” Maya insisted. “Harlan and Isak had intact brains. Renko’s brain is damaged. We’re not talking about psychological adjustment. We’re talking about fundamental cognitive impairment.”

“So we don’t revive her?” Peter asked. “We just… keep her frozen? Forever?”

“Or we declare the preservation failed and let her rest.”

“That’s murder,” the board member said.

“She’s already dead,” Maya shot back. “She died in 2029 of kidney failure. We’re just deciding whether to resurrect her corpse into confusion.”

The meeting continued for two hours. In the end, they voted: 4-3 in favor of revival. James cast the deciding vote.

“We owe her the attempt,” he said. “Even if it fails, she deserves the chance.”

Maya didn’t argue. But as she left the meeting, she wondered if giving someone a chance to suffer was actually mercy.

\-----

They revived Elizabeth Renko at dawn, using the same protocols as before. But from the moment she regained consciousness, it was clear something fundamental had broken.

She opened her eyes. Looked around. Closed them again.

“Ms. Renko?” Yuki said gently. “Can you hear me?”

No response.

“Ms. Renko, I’m Dr. Tanaka. You’re in a medical facility. You’ve been in cryogenic preservation. Can you understand what I’m saying?”

Elizabeth’s eyes opened again. She looked directly at Yuki, and her expression was perfectly blank. Not confused. Not frightened. Empty.

“She’s awake,” Peter said, checking the neural monitors. “Brain activity is normal. She’s processing sensory input. But there’s no… integration. She’s seeing and hearing, but not understanding.”

“Run the cognitive tests,” Maya ordered.

They tried everything. Simple questions. Name recognition. Visual pattern matching. Basic motor commands. Elizabeth responded to nothing. She breathed. Her heart beat. Her eyes tracked movement. But there was no one behind them.

After an hour, Yuki made the call: “Persistent vegetative state. She’s biologically alive but cognitively absent. The damage was too severe.”

“Can we repair it?” James asked.

“Not with current technology. The neural pathways are destroyed. We’d need to rebuild her entire cognitive architecture, and even if we could, she wouldn’t be Elizabeth Renko anymore. She’d be something new wearing her body.”

Maya looked at the woman in the revival cradle—breathing, alive, empty. “So we resurrected a corpse.”

“We resurrected a body,” Peter corrected. “The person was already gone.”

\-----

They kept Elizabeth alive for three days while the ethics board debated. Some argued for continued life support—maybe future technology could restore her. Others argued for cessation—keeping her alive in this state was cruelty.

Maya visited her once, alone, late at night. Elizabeth lay in the medical bed, eyes open, staring at the ceiling. Seeing nothing. Being nothing.

“I’m sorry,” Maya whispered. “You paid for tomorrow, and we gave you this instead. You trusted us, and we failed you.”

Elizabeth didn’t respond. Couldn’t respond. There was no one there to hear the apology.

On the fourth day, they made the decision. James signed the order. Yuki administered the protocol. Elizabeth Renko’s body stopped breathing, her heart stopped beating, and she died a second time—this time with witnesses who understood exactly what they’d done.

\-----

The facility went quiet after that. No celebrations of successful revival. No optimistic discussions of scaling the protocol. Just silence and the growing understanding that resurrection was more complicated than they’d imagined.

Maya found Isak in his usual place: at the window, staring at Everest.

“They told you?” she asked.

“They told me. Another revival. This one didn’t work.”

“She was already gone. We just hadn’t accepted it.”

“So you killed her.”

“We let her go.” Maya joined him at the window. “There’s a difference.”

“Is there? Or is that just what we tell ourselves to feel better about deciding who lives and who dies?”

Maya had no answer.

Isak turned to face her. “How many more revivals are scheduled?”

“One. Victor Salazar. Tech investor, cryopreserved in 2031. Clean preservation record, no known storage anomalies. He should be…”

“Intact?”

“As intact as any of you.”

“Will you revive him?”

“The board says yes. We need successful outcomes to justify the program.”

“And if he wakes up like Harlan? Suicidal and broken?”

“Then we have another failure.”

“And if he wakes up like me?”

“Then we have success, and we start scaling. Thousands of revivals. Maybe tens of thousands. Everyone who ever paid to freeze gets their chance.”

Isak looked back at the mountain. “Do you think that’s what they really want? When they were dying, when they signed those contracts—do you think they imagined this? Waking up decades later, everyone they loved gone, their world erased, their identity uncertain? Or did they imagine something easier? Something that looked like going to sleep and waking up tomorrow, with everything mostly the same?”

“Probably the second one.”

“Then you’re giving them something they never asked for. You’re resurrecting them into displacement.”

“We’re giving them life.”

“You’re giving them existence. Life is what you build inside existence. And some people—people like Elizabeth—can’t build anything because there’s nothing left to build with.” He paused. “When you revive Salazar, what are you hoping for?”

“That he wakes up whole. That he integrates successfully. That he proves resurrection is viable.”

“And what are you afraid of?”

Maya was quiet for a long time. Outside, the sun set over Everest, turning snow to gold.

“I’m afraid he’ll wake up perfectly healthy and still wish he hadn’t,” she said finally. “I’m afraid resurrection is something we can do but shouldn’t. And I’m afraid we’ve already gone too far to stop.”

Through years of hard work we are now financially stable and have some means to enjoy travel more extensively and splurge a bit here and there for hotels. None of our friends, however, are in this situation. Im wondering if there are people like us out there feel the same way and wish there are friends that could travel together once in a while and explore similar interest and share experiences?

Our itinerary dont have to align start to finish, for example and starters, we are heading to japan for a month in February, spanning across the sapporo snow festival, couple ski days in hoshino tomamu, 5 days in tokyo, 15 days in the kansai area split between normal local living in the heart of osaka and a day at the mitsui kyoto, and then a few days in kyushu with a stay in the Ritz at fukuoka. If this is something that aligns with your travel interest or budget, perhaps we could meet up for a meal or coffee in fukuoka, or ski/snowboard while in tomamu then head to the bathhouse. Or urban sightseeing in tokyo such as the relatively new teamlab digital art museum in azabudai hills, a few small shops like soup flower packets or even the cat shrine.

Another opportunity im eyeing is potentially spending a weekend in LA in May, to see a video game concert by square enix, staying at the JW Marriott in downtown, maybe adding in a few other potential sightseeing spots in LA. I am currently typing this post in the Douglas Autograph Collection in Vancouver, after an amazing concert last night by the K-pop group Twice. I also traveled to San Francisco in 2024 to see a J-Pop group Yoasobi perform. Of course I would love to meet people that have suggestions or recommendations to visit places i haven't thought about. Because of this sub, I enjoyed properties like al maha and Ritz maldives, places i would have never known if it wasnt for you. 

No financial exchange, no alternative motives, just looking to explore the world and enjoy experiences with like minded people that have similar financial means. Welcome any feedback or suggestions. ",2,1768161097.0,marriott,0,0.63,False

I am resurrecting an old storyline.

Felt cool saying that last bit, yup. But it's a little more complicated than that. Look, you guys-

There was a script I wrote over a year ago, titled *Your childhood friend is the daughter of the demon lord,* and then I forgot about it. It was lost to the sands of time. And then, Scarlet- out of nowhere- finds that script and drops [this absolute gem of an audio right here!](https://youtu.be/4mLrFrJqHPg?si=sGl54TqGcMrQ0rxC) I **HIGHLY** recommend you check that out before reading this script, because it's a direct prequel of this one.

But if you'd rather deny your ears of Scarlet's magic and read it on reddit instead, then well:

Anyway, Admiral and I loved Scarlet's rendition so much, it directly spawned the following exchange of messages between us:

""Yo. You still taking commissions?""

**SCRIPT:**

*(SFX: Cicadas softly buzzing, intermittent rippling of lake water)*

And what does this potion do?!

Really? It can heal any cut within minutes? That’s- (impressed, starry eyed) that’s so cool! I always get so tired after I heal someone’s injuries. But you can brew half a dozen such potions in one batch! You’re really cool, you know that?

Huh?

Yeah um, I....I can heal injuries. Magically, I mean. Kinda. But it drains a lot of my dem-

A lot of my mana. Yeah. Oh well, I will get better at it someday. Someday soon.

A healer? No, that’s not quite what I....

Hm. You know what? I guess I am one. Healing people by removing their pain and suffering....I think I like the idea of that.

What? A princess? *Me?* (Flustered) What- what gave that away- I mean, what gave you that idea? Huh?

*(A longer pause. Cicadas continue chirping.)*

You think I talk like one? That’s such a weird thing to say! I’m.....I’m just your friend.

(Ever so unsure) We are friends, right?

(Smiling faintly) Thanks. I like you too! You’re- you’re pretty much my best friend, you know? Even if I only visit your mom’s shop once every few weeks. I really look forward to seeing you, hanging out with you. I can’t really be like this with anybody else back home.

Oh, I have friends. Just most- okay, all- all of them are girls. The only men I know are my dad, of course, and my sisters’.....uh, boyfriends, I guess you’d call them.

Yeah. My sisters are all older than me. And they’re always busy. And my friends, all they talk about is.....well, it’s stuff I can’t really say to you.

Because it would be most unbecoming of a princess. (Muttering, rambling) Which I’m not. But you seem to think I am. So for your sake, I will at least try to act like one. Sometimes. Yeah.

Hey, um....can I ask you something?

What do you want to be when you grow up? It’s okay if you haven’t figured it out yet. Most humans- I mean, people- they don’t really-

Huh! That was quick. So you want to be an alchemist? You didn’t even need to think.

I see. Well, I am pretty sure you’d be great at it. Your mom is an alchemist too, and you’re already so good at what you do.

(Sighing) Yeah, there’s still a lot left to learn. Trust me, you don’t have to tell me that. Half my time is spent in learning all manner of strange things. Lessons and history and culture and magic and practice and formal events and what not.

(Muttering faintly) Like a princess, yeah. But....but I’m not one.

Hm? What do *I* want to do when I become older?

Well.....I want to bring happiness to people. I want to solve their problems. But that- (frowning) that’s not so easy. I can’t just wave my fingers and magic away their problems.

Because their problems are complicated.

Mother says it’s not easy to do good in this world. But you should try anyway. And someday, I want to follow in her footsteps. To genuinely make this world a better place. It probably sounds clichéd, but that- that’s what I wanna do.

Hey, um, can I ask you another question?

(A pregnant pause)

Would you be okay with it if- if someday I kidnapped you?

Why? To marry you of course!

(Deadpan silence)

What? (Pouting) Why are you laughing?

I’m not joking! I- I was being serious.

Hey, stop laughing! I don’t see what’s so funny.

Whatever. You ruined it! Hmph.

Well, who else am I going to marry then? It’s not difficult. My mom says if you like a guy, you should marry him. And I agree. So that’s....that’s what I’m going to do.

(Surprised) Whoa, really? You- You would like that?

You mean it?

(Smiling) Okay, then! I’m relieved you like the idea. Or else it- it would be a bit problematic. Not that I care. I just want you.

And there you go, giving me that smile again. That serene, carefree smile, like you don’t really understand what I’m saying, but you’re happy to be with me anyway.

Yeah. You sometimes make that expression. I like seeing it.

Hey, um....can I ask you another question?

You’re always going to be here, aren’t you?

You will always be my friend, right?

*(Chirping of cicadas begins to fade)*

Right....?

...

.....

.......

Pet. *Wakey wakey!*

Rise and shine, my dear! I know you’re awake. You realize you can’t ignore me forever, right? The lilim in your bedroom won’t go away just because you want her to. You’re in her room, anyway.

Mmn. Good evening, my pet. Had a pleasant nap?

Oh, I ruined it, did I? (Sighing dramatically) What a shame. But now that you’re awake, I guess I can ruin you instead!

*(SFX: Frantic rustling of bedsheets, and playful giggling)*

Come on, you know you can’t escape my attentions! And I don’t even need to pin you down. They’re doing that for me, aren’t they? Your new friends?

I have to say, you look good in these restraints. These dark tendrils of demonic energy, binding you ever so gently. But as you’ve found out, there’s no wiggling out of them. They’re my own handiwork. Do you like them?

Aww, but they obey my will! They’re so cute and possessive, coiling around you like serpents and squeezing you gently. Almost like they are alive. Which....well, it’s difficult to say if they are. Technically they’re an extension of me, because they’re made of my magic.

Well, since they’ve rendered you unable to move, and I’m on top of you....(whispering up close) I guess you can’t escape from my kisses, can you?

(Kissing him, giggling between kisses) Your eyes look a bit dazed, pet. That’s what happens when you get kissed by a lilim. I’m told it fills the- uh, the object of our *affections*\- with an almost supernatural pleasure. And judging by your reaction, I guess it’s kinda true. (Snickering softly)

Oh, poor thing. Every time I kiss you, you only seem to fall deeper. (Kissing him)

Fine. I’ll let you recover. I don’t want to, you know, make you melt into a puddle just yet.

(Softer, nurturing) That’s it. Deep breaths, my sweet. Just breathe. I’m right here.

I said I’d give you a break. I didn’t say I’d get off you. No, darling. I think I’m quite comfy up here.

I really did a number on you, huh? I’m sorry about that. I- I don’t want to overwhelm you, but it’s kinda hard holding back. I just want to drown you in hugs and kisses and headpats and cuddles. (Sighing wistfully)

Guess I’m just trying to make up for lost time. I wanted to claim you ages ago. But I had to set the stage first. Cleave a path to your city, capturing critical points along the way, and laying the groundwork for a prolonged siege. That’s why I was away from you for so many months. It was very difficult for me. I thought about you so often, my sweet.

(Faintly) I wonder if you missed me too.

Yeah...? You did? (Smiling gently) My darling. You’re so sweet. Thanks for telling me that.

(Darkening ever so slightly) I know. It must have come as a shock to you, knowing who....what....I truly am.

I want to tell you I hid the truth from you to keep you safe. I couldn’t let you fall into the hands of the Order if they suspected you of being close to me.

You’re the one thing I can’t compromise on. I *had* to ensure you were safe. But that....is only part of the reason.

I was selfish. I couldn’t risk you running away if I revealed myself to you earlier. I made a plan. A small window of time, just before my forces laid siege to your city. I’d meet you by our childhood lake, and I....I’d try to persuade you.

If that failed- (forlorn, hurting) if you couldn’t accept me, then....well, I did what I had to.

(Caressing his cheek) I promised I’d release you from my thrall once I took you home with me, didn’t I?

I’ve kept my promise. You’re not under my control anymore, see?

(Sighing softly) Darling. Please don’t say that. We’ve talked about this.

I had to bind you in these tendrils because you kept trying to run away. You refused to eat, refused to let me touch you. And you came close to hurting yourself in one of your silly little attempts to escape from my castle.

Look into my eyes.

(Dominant, laced with concern) Just because I don’t compel you to obey, doesn’t mean I can’t do this to you whenever I want. All I have to do, is lace my voice with authority, tell you to stare into my eyes, and you’re helpless to resist. And then I simply snap my fingers- (snapping her fingers)- and you heel.

Look into my eyes.

(Soft, intense) Do you feel it? My magic seeping through every pore of your skin? My voice, slithering inside your ears, coiling around your brain so very *possessively.* Do you feel it? How you’d do anything I tell you to? Completely aware, but entranced- your will interlacing with mine, inextricably, one and the same- like your mind is wrapped in a cocoon of cotton candy.

(Firmly, but gently) Any power, any freedom you may have here, is only what I *choose* to give you, my pet. For your own sake, please remember that. I don’t want a slave. I don’t *want* to compel you, but there are two things I will not let you do.

I won’t allow you to run from me, and I won’t allow you to hurt yourself. That is not up for discussion. If keeping you safe means making you my....my love slave....(whispering) then so be it.

I’m not an unreasonable woman, darling. You’ve known me for most of your life. Please, don’t be afraid of me. You’re still staring into my eyes, but you feel the fog lifting again, don’t you?

I’m sorry, my love. I really, really don’t want to scare you, but I’m making my priorities very clear. You are *the* most important thing in my life, and I’m not losing you.

Don’t worry, pet. You don’t have to avoid my eyes. I know you like looking into them. (Soft, reassuring) I won’t do this to you again, as long as you don’t force my hand.

Hey.

I’m glad we had this conversation. Things have been such a whirlwind these last three days, ever since I- you know- *kidnapped* you, as you keep saying. (Laughing a bit)

I’ve been busy, what with preparing for the invasion and all. For what it’s worth, Fleur tells me you’ve been rather well-behaved in my absence. Other than the- you know, the repeated escape attempts.

Fleur. She’s my kikimora maid. The one who calls you “young master”?

Kikimora, dear. Or kiki for short. Her species likes to clean, tidy up and organise all sorts of things. (Smirking) People too, I suppose. She has been in my employ for a while now because poor thing hasn’t found a husband of her own yet. (Sighing) I hope to change that after this war.

She deserves a loving husband she can pamper and spoil. As do all my girls.

Yeah. That is why I’m doing this. I want to remove suffering and strife. Root out corruption and injustice from the Order’s capital city. I want to create a world where love thrives, just like my mother.

Oh, come now. Of course this *is* the way. (Gently tracing his jaw with a finger) We first need to destroy the old ways, before we can build new ones. Someday, my pet, you will come to see the world just as I do.

(Whispering) Yeah. You will.

There is no other way. Enough questions, my darling. (Smiling coyly) If you want to ask me any more, then you’ll have to play a game with me.

Uh huh. I’m thinking now’s as good a time as any for your....interrogation.

Oh, you heard me right. You used to work in the royal court as an alchemist, my dear. You have access to all sorts of juicy information. That makes you a high-value prisoner of war. And because I was the one to capture you, that makes you *my* prisoner.

(Whispering, silky soft) So I think I’ve earned the right to....*extract* what I need from you. You’d be willing to co-operate, yes?

Let’s play a little game. For every two questions of mine that you answer honestly, I *might* consider answering one of yours.

Yes. Right now. There’s no one to interrupt us. My dark tendrils and I have got you trapped. And my tail seems to have coiled around your left leg again. (Sighing fondly) Look at her. She missed you so much. I may as well take advantage of this situation, no?

*(SFX: Unfurling her wings)*

My wings seem to be casting quite the long shadow on you. You look nervous. Afraid. If I’m being perfectly honest, (whispering) it’s kinda *hot*.

There’s nobody to interrupt us in here. And so-

*(SFX: Soft knocking on door)*

(Sighing heavily)

Fleur. What is it now?

Refreshments? Uh....(muttering faintly to her darling) Hey. Do you want anything? Pastries, or cookies maybe, or coffee or....?

Alright. Um, hey, Fleur? I will call for you later in the night. Get some rest for now.

No, stop prowling the corridors! The castle is already spotless. There’s no work to be done. Just go to your chambers and rest.

I mean it! Get some rest. *Now*!

(Sighing again) This girl....

Anyway. Where were we?

Ah, yes. Your interrogation.

*(SFX: Flapping her wings. Any and all background ambience becomes muted.)*

(Shushing him, crooning) It’s okay, it’s okay. Don’t struggle, my love. I’m not going to do anything, you know? The two of us are just under the cover of my wings.

I know it’s dark in here. The outside world is far away. It doesn’t exist right now. You are cocooned in my demonic energy, pinned under me, your back pressed against the silk sheets, my wings enveloping you completely, my silver hair brushing your cheeks and neck as I bring my face closer....and closer....(whispering right next to his ear).....and closer.

Our lips are almost brushing. And all you can look at in the darkness, are my eyes.

Stop squirming, pet. The tendrils will only coil around you tighter. You can’t help but obey.

*(SFX: Brushing, stroking, playing with his hair)*

(Smiling lovingly) Hey, baby. You like it when I play with your hair?

I used to do this sometimes when we were kids. You’d close your eyes, and lean into my touch. Unknowingly. Innocently. Do you remember?

Ssshh. Soften your face, my sweet. Ease your anxieties, your fears. (Whispering) Soften. I’m not going to harm you. I could never do that.

You are my prisoner, but that doesn’t mean I can’t subject you to my incessant affections. (Breathy laughter)

Tell me. Did you like your life as an imperial alchemist back at the court?

This is still an interrogation, darling. I do require an answer from you.

(3 seconds’ pause)

A mixed bag, huh....yeah, I suppose so much of what humans build, experience and lose are bittersweet.

Tell me. Was there any girl you fell for during your time in the city?

Of course I’m being serious. I can also tell when you’re lying to me, so tell the truth. (Whispering) Was there someone you....you loved, from whom I snatched you away?

(4 seconds’ pause)

So I was right. You did fall for a girl, but it was she who snatched you away.

(Blushing a bit) You’ve only ever had eyes for me, huh? I- that is-

Wow.

I can’t tell if I’m somehow, passively, charming you by being so close to you, and maybe that’s what- that’s what’s causing you to give me such unrestrained answers.

You may ask me a question now. But mind you, I don’t *have* to answer it. (Pouting) You’re my prisoner right now.

Why am I doing this? (Sighing) Are you sure *that’s* what you want to ask me?

Hm.

Because I love you. (Kissing him)

That’s not what you meant? Well, too bad. Next question- do you miss your work?

Yeah. You know, brewing strange and interesting potions. Transmuting stuff. Unravelling the secrets of alchemy. Do you miss it?

(3 seconds’ pause)

I see. Would you like to work as an alchemist here then?

Well, I just mean- if you really want to, then you can help me and my women with your skills. I won’t ask you to fight against your old allies. Heavens, no! But you could transmute ordinary steel into demon realm silver. You know what that is, yes?

(Smiling affectionately) Of course you do! Clever thing. Realm silver saps away the victim’s spiritual essence instead of drawing blood. So if you stab someone with a sword made of realm silver, they’re not wounded. They simply grow weak and exhausted, so they can be incapacitated. It’s what most of my army uses, but it’s diminishing in quantity.

Well, I can have one of my demonic lieutenants explain its properties to you. Set you up with a laboratory, materials, any texts you require. But only *if* you want to do this. I have other ways of achieving my goals too.

What do you say? Would you like that?

(3 seconds’ pause)

You don’t have to answer right now if you don’t want to. Just think it over, alright?

Mhmn. Take your time, my pet.

(Half smirk) Stop calling you pet? (Kissing him) *Pet* doesn’t want to be called pet?

You know, it’s really cute how you melt every time I kiss you. Or just caress you. You get all blushy, your breath seems to hitch, and you can’t form complete sentences. We lilims have that effect on human men.

(Sighing softly) My sisters tell me our lovers get used to it over time. But it requires a lot of, mmnn, *exposure.* (Giggling)

Well, I don’t have a choice, do I? I don’t want my future husband to get all flustered every time I play with him. I’ll just have to get you used to this.

But, if my pet doesn’t want to be called pet, then out of consideration for all our years of friendship- (sighing dramatically)- I guess I’ll just call you my darling.

(Cupping his cheek) Is that alright?

Okay then. Your turn.

Hmnn. You have an interesting way of phrasing things. “Can we talk about this”, you ask? And about what exactly, my dear?

(4 seconds’ pause)

(Gently) No. No negotiating. I am the youngest daughter of the Demon Lord, and I’ve only done what my kind does when we fall for a human. I am the leader of a faction which some people call....well, they call us “radicals”. Because we bring concord through conquest. Realize the ideals of peace and love, through invasions and schemes. It’s the quickest, cleanest way. And sometimes, it’s the only way.

I will lay siege to your old home. I will do what I must. I have been in enough wars to know they can never be bloodless. But you have my word I will keep the bloodshed to a minimum. Only what can’t be avoided. Just as I have done so far.

Taking your capital city- the pride and joy of the Order- it’ll be the brightest jewel in my crown of conquests. And I’ve already decided what I will be naming the new city, after I’ve rebuilt it into a paradise of love and pleasure, of luxury and wholesome degeneracy.

(Sighing softly) I told you, my darling. One question only.

(Matter-of-factly) You humans don’t know any better. You can’t take care of yourselves. You need us to protect, and nurture, and love you. That’s why we so-called radicals do what we do. Currently, it’s just me and a bunch of demons. And a few arch-succubi. And several thousand soldiers from various species. Hellhounds, minotaurs, dark mages, I think we even have a sandworm? Weird.

I’ll introduce you to them soon. And....and to my sisters. Mother has been dying to meet you again. I think she has always known how I feel about you. She is the Demon Lord, after all.

But I wanted to give you time to adjust. That’s why I brought you here first, to one of my own castles, near the frontier of the demon realms. Nobody else really knows I brought you back with me. Not yet.

(Smiling, whispering) Wanted you all to myself for a while.

My demonic energy has already rubbed off on you. Any other woman will know you belong to me. But even then, we....we haven’t solemnized our bond yet.

(Blushing...?) We....you know, we haven’t slept together yet.

(Pouting) I’m not talking about cuddling.

I am a princess. I have manners. I’m not going to....to mark you against your will, unlike some of my....

It doesn’t matter. I can be patient. I want you to be comfortable with me. Like you used to be, once upon a time.

(Soft) Darling.

Are you....afraid of me?

(3 seconds’ silence)

(Ever so hurt) I see. I....may I ask you one more question?

Are you still my friend?

(5 seconds’ silence)

(As if having a reverie) I wonder if you still make those little healing potions. And if you do....maybe you can show them to me again, in that little grove of trees by the lake. After the war’s over.

In New Lescatie.

Im wondering if there are people like us out there feel the same way and wish there are friends that could travel together once in a while and explore similar interest and share experiences?

Our itinerary dont have to align start to finish, for example and starters, we are heading to japan for a month in February, spanning across the sapporo snow festival, couple ski days in hoshino tomamu, 5 days in tokyo, 15 days in the kansai area split between normal local living in the heart of osaka and a day at the mitsui kyoto, and then a few days in kyushu with a stay in the Ritz at fukuoka. If this is something that aligns with your travel interest or budget, perhaps we could meet up for a meal or coffee in fukuoka, or ski/snowboard while in tomamu then head to the bathhouse. Or urban sightseeing in tokyo such as the relatively new teamlab digital art museum in azabudai hills, a few small shops like soup flower packets or even the cat shrine.

Another opportunity im eyeing is potentially spending a weekend in LA in May, to see a video game concert by square enix, staying at the JW Marriott in downtown, maybe adding in a few other potential sightseeing spots in LA. I am currently typing this post in the Douglas Autograph Collection in Vancouver, after an amazing concert last night by the K-pop group Twice.

I have a great job that keeps me busy 9-5 mon to friday but I have some free time to spend around those hours. I have a car as well. I have brown hair, brown eyes and I'm in pretty good shape and live a healthy, active lifestyle. I go to the gym regularly and really enjoy doing things outside (while its warm out at least.)

1qa8xsh,https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingmom/comments/1qa8xsh/i_love_my_husband/,I love my husband,"We've been together as a couple for almost 20 years. In the beginning, we were very immature. In some ways we still are, but they are in playful ways now rather than detrimental ways. We are still learning each other, we are still learning new things about each other. We have two kids now, and the first few years of parenthood were honestly the hardest years of our relationship. 

I come from a broken home and my mom's subsequent partners all sucked (her current partner is great, but he came into the picture after I was an adult). I spent my whole childhood expecting the least from men. Expecting them to cheat, be abusive, be predatory, be neglectful, etc. When I met my now partner, I was hyper independent. I always had a backup plan that I maintained for the day he would eventually abandon me or try to hurt me. Around the 19 year mark of our relationship, I realized I no longer maintain an escape plan. Somewhere along the way, my brain just decided I was safe enough to not need it anymore. I still have a contingency plan in my brain if one of us were to get sick or pass away unexpectedly, but I no longer am prepared for him to hurt me. 

My relationship with my partner is one of mutual understanding, hard conversations when needed, and a desire to show love to each other in front of our children and model healthy partnerships. We do get into arguments. We do piss each other off from time to time. But at the end of it all, we find a way to work through our differences and to model not just conflict but the resolution. So much work has gone into our relationship from the egotistical young adults (we both used to prioritize 'winning' arguments over actually resolving conflict) to partners who have each other's back.

I am currently laying in bed with a heating pad on my belly that he brought to me because of my period pains and he is managing the children while bringing me coffee and snacks.

The air smells like copper and wet glue. Paper dust clings to the back of your throat. Sticky notes gather near your shoes, their corners lifting and settling like they are breathing. Step carefully. You are already involved.

The office lights hum. Fluorescent. Constant. Wrong.

You enter the office. Or the office opens inside you. Ana floats several centimetres above the floor, jaw unhinged farther than bone should allow. She swallows static. Her teeth hum like satellites that have forgotten their purpose.

The mirrors do not reflect. They record. They catalogue the tilt of your head and the slackness in your posture. One labels you Mildly Annoying Human. Another files you as Temporary. Look down. There are many of you. They are arguing quietly about who gets to stand under the light.

Gravity exhales.

Harold drifts past. His tie twitches like it is alive. His face looks softened, unfinished, like something chewed and put back. He smells of burnt coffee and apology emails. He leans too close.

“Do you think the stapler has feelings,” he asks, “or am I overthinking it.”

The thought arrives fully formed. Fuck Harold.

The pens hear you. They whisper approval. Ceiling tiles shift. The coffee machine gurgles something that sounds like Jesus Harold. You blink. Harold is gone. A filing cabinet hums where he stood.

Time skips.

The floor buckles like damp paper. Ana moves through hallways that were never approved. Gravity flips, collapses, then settles sideways as if that is easier. Mirrors multiply. One tells you that you look nice today. Another asks if Harold tied your reflection. Every surface remembers you incorrectly.

Breathe in toner. Ozone. The faint memory of your first stapler jam. Sticky notes scuttle around your ankles whispering about unpaid overtime. Somewhere, a tie twitches.

The bricks hum together. Soft. Unified. One looks at you with a chipped edge and a patient stare. “I hope you enjoyed being chewed,” it says, “because you are on the list now.”

Photocopiers murmur spreadsheets that never end. Ceiling tiles type stories in screaming Comic Sans. Everything blames Harold.

Ana bites another brick. Slowly. Carefully. The air tastes metallic and sweet and wrong. Your heartbeat syncs with the coffee machine. A brick hovers above your head, waiting.

Harold returns, translucent now, his edges melting. “Do you think this office is haunted,” he asks, “or am I just underpaid.”

You do not answer. The office answers for you.

A loop brushes your shoulder. The bricks chant rules. Pens ricochet off reality. Sticky notes flicker messages meant only for you. You never signed the Consent to Exist form. You belong to the office now.

Blink carefully.

Harold appears again, half folded, mumbling about expense reports. Ana turns to him. Her jaw still hums galaxies. She tells him to fuck off. The pens clap once. Sticky notes hiss. Ceiling tiles type He had it coming. Harold slides into a drawer that does not open.

Ana swallows the last brick. Or maybe you do.

It tastes like your first memory. Cold. Heavy. The lights blink your name. Then Harold’s. Then yours again. Then laughter.

You try to leave.

You cannot.

The mirrors archive you. The photocopiers breathe. The bricks watch. Sticky notes chant softly.

Stop reading.

Do not stop.

Blink.

Do not blink.

The final brick winks. The last photocopier hums your theme song. Gravity whispers that Harold’s tie is filing a complaint from somewhere below reality.

You are the brick.
You are Ana.
You are reading this.

And yes, Harold. You absolute twat.

Ana ate a brick. Or maybe the brick ate her. Or maybe you just did. The air smells like copper, wet glue, and sticky notes crawling toward your shoes, filing complaints about your existence. Step carefully you are already part of this chaos. 


You enter the office. Or maybe it entered you. Ana drifts upward, jaw unhinging, swallowing galaxies of static, teeth humming like satellites that forgot their orbit. Mirrors no longer reflect they archive you, mutter complaints about your posture, and file you under “Mildly Annoying Humans.” Look down dozens of versions of you argue over who deserves the fluorescent light. Gravity sighs like it is done with all of this.

Harold floats past, tie twitching, looking like a bashed crab or half-chewed pen lid. Harold you absolute twat, do you really have to ruin the coffee machine’s mood? He leans toward the reader. “Seriously, do you think the stapler has feelings, or am I overthinking this?” You think fuck Harold.

The pens snicker. “Thanks Harold,” they whisper. “Couldn’t have unionized the bricks without your stupid tie.” Ceiling tiles roll their eyes. The coffee machine gurgles a hiss that sounds suspiciously like “Jesus Harold.” You blink. Was he ever here? Did he even matter? Son of a filing cabinet.

Time hiccups. The floor folds like wet paper. Ana drifts through hallways that never existed. Gravity reverses, folds in on itself, then decides it prefers to be sideways today. Mirrors multiply and start commenting on themselves. You look nice today one says. Did Harold tie this asks another. Every reflection is simultaneously past, future, and maybe a pen.

Inhale the toner, ozone, and faint memory of your first stapler jam. Sticky notes scurry past your ankles, whispering grievances about unpaid overtime. And yet Harold’s tie twitches somewhere. Argh Harold.

Bricks form a union, humming quietly in perfect harmony. One glares at you, chip firmly on its shoulder, muttering, “I hope you enjoyed being chewed, because next time you’re on my overtime list.” Sticky notes submit grievance letters. Photocopiers hum spreadsheets of existential dread. Ceiling tiles type fanfiction in Comic Sans made of screaming faces. All blame Harold. 

The staplers march in neat formation, demanding overtime. Coffee machines wink at you like they know Harold’s entire salary history. Damn Harold.

Ana bites a brick slowly, savoring every metallic, galaxy-filled chew. The air tastes like copper, wet glue, ozone, and marzipan. Your heartbeat syncs with the coffee machine’s hum. Another brick hovers above your head. Harold floats by again, leaning toward you. “Do you really think this office is haunted, or am I just underpaid?” You think fuck Harold.

A time-loop whispers past you, the bricks chant about union bylaws, pens ricochet off reality, and sticky notes flicker messages to you. Yes you—the one reading this. You didn’t sign the Consent to Exist form. You’re officially part of the office now. Step carefully. Blink, and Harold will blame you for it.

Harold reappears, half-melted, muttering about expense reports nobody cares about. Ana stares at him, jaw still humming galaxies, and snaps “Ohhhhh fuck off Harold, you and your stupid tie. Seriously, you can FUCK right off.” The pens clap. Sticky notes hiss. Ceiling tiles type “He had it coming.” The bricks nod in solemn agreement. The coffee machine winks knowingly. Harold you disaster.

Ana swallows the last brick. Or maybe you did. It tastes like your first childhood memory but colder. The fluorescent lights blink Morse code spelling your name, then Harold’s, then yours again, then “HAHAHA.” Gravity sighs. Mirrors archive. Photocopiers hum. Pens argue. Sticky notes float in formation. Time folds sideways. 

You try to leave. You can’t. The brick winks at you. Step lightly. The ceiling tiles whisper about Harold’s tie. A pen rolls past your foot. A photocopier coughs up a grievance letter from 1997. Harold would have filed it, but he’s already partially melted. Jesus Harold.

Stop reading. Don’t stop. Blink. Don’t blink. Ana loops. Harold loops somewhere in a filing cabinet of forgotten opinions. The bricks loop. The coffee machine loops. The ceiling tiles roll their eyes. Sticky notes chant in unison “Harold is a nerdy twat, Harold is a prat, Harold is a useless sack of paperwork.”

The final brick winks at you. The last photocopier hums your theme song. Gravity whispers that Harold’s tie is filing a complaint from the void. You are the brick. You are Ana. You are reading this. And yes, Harold, you absolute twat.",1,1768160439.0,stories,0,1.0,False

I'm building this coffee table as a full sized dining table in walnut. I was thinking of replacing the leg spline with two or three thinner brass splines.

  
While the leg joint at the spline will also have a floating tenon, is there an adhesive that I can use to overcome the weakness of joining two different materials? 

  
Would using 80 grit sandpaper on the brass and a 2 part epoxy to join be the best option?

  
Will I have a cracking/splitting mess in 10 years?

My current job is fine and stable, but I was looking for a better salary. The interview I just had felt more like an interrogation than a normal meeting. Their entire vibe was defensive, and even though I feel I handled myself well, the whole experience was terrible.

The weirdest part was this: The recruiter told me the salary range from the start, and I confirmed it was suitable. Then, in the interview with someone from HR and a manager, the HR person asked for my salary expectations. I gave her the same range the recruiter told me. She immediately replied that their budget was lower.

I told her it was no problem, and we could talk to find something that fits their budget. As soon as I said that, her entire demeanor changed. The woman literally mocked me.

She looked at me and said, ""When you go to Starbucks to buy coffee, do you haggle over the price? This isn't a good look for someone applying for a job.""

I was honestly shocked, but I replied, ""I guess we see the situation differently. I was just under the impression we were having a frank and transparent conversation."" The other manager who was sitting there went completely silent and ended the interview right then. It was very obvious that it was over.

But the surprise is... They called me today. They want to proceed to the next round. I'm almost certain the whole thing was a tactic to see if they could pressure me into accepting a lower salary. Seriously, this is not normal.",0,1768160398.0,InterviewMan,2,0.5,False

To kinda paint a picture it’s a big parking lot with little stores and a Safeway and stuff. I met this homeless guy one morning at my shop a few months back when he came in and seemed like he was hungry and asked if we had anything to spare. I told him unfortunately not that it was all fresh. I always like to help people so I offered to buy him a pastry and coffee and let him sit by the fireplace and talked to him and tried to make him feel cared for because I feel for the homeless. 

Well a few weeks ago he came into my work when I wasn’t there and tried telling my coworkers that I just give him things like I don’t buy them in front of him every time. It kinda upset me and when he sees me in there he sometimes comes in and asks for a drink. I kinda feel like he is taking advantage of me. It makes me kind of want to hide when he walks by the windows. Sadly he also pissed himself at some point and hasn’t changed his pants so he smells like ammonia when he comes in and I feel bad for him and my coworkers and customers who have to smell that. 

I really feel lost on what to do and I’m not close enough with anybody here who can give me advice from a good place. What can I do to be kind but also not have him take advantage of my wallet considering I have my own needs and it gets expensive taking care of someone else every time they see you’re around.

1qa8mmo,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAVeterinarian/comments/1qa8mmo/anal_glad_removal_surgery/,Anal glad removal surgery,"Hello,

  
I would like to get an ​idea of how long a vet will typically encourage a dog owner with ongoing anal gland issues to not have them surgically removed?

  
The specifics of this are a 3 year old mix, likely gsd, maybe husky, retriever. Basically a mutt. He's a rescue and Ive had him since he was 13/14 weeks old. he had a hernia that was surgically fixed when he was neutered at 6-9 months.

  
He started having skin issues this fast late spring early fall. By nov/​dec ​it also came with impacted anal glads. Expressing anal glad is rough on the toughest​ of dogs. 

​This is not a tough dog. He's a doll but sensitive. (velcro dog, gets big bumps ​on his muzzle when he boinks he own muzzle on the coffee table or floor...).

  
Anyway took him in, vet expressed his glands, he cried (of course) we got him pregnozone to deal with the skin itch and antibiotics to deal with the infection in his glads. (I am a shitty dog owner that didn't realize ​how bad it was despite having gone thru anal gland issues in the past.)

During the appointment I raised having them removed. He's only 3, I'm not going to put him through that on a monthly basis. Vet turned that down hard, last thing they try, bla bla bla, was a bit if a frustrating conversation actually. Anyway they thought it was due to a tick bite or allergy. 

  
At this point, he's been on different dog food for a good while, the skin issues have cleared, drugs long done, BUT the glad issue came back. After his bath I expressed his glands again today. Its painful for the dog. And frankly hearing him cry or struggle to shit is not something ai am ok with on a monthly basis.

  
So basically long rant-ey question short is should I just start calling around to see if any of the animal hospital will remove his anal gland or keep trying with my usual clinic (smaller clinic with vets rotating thru) or something else entirely?

  
As a vet or a vet tech have ​you seen anal glad removal be approved? How many months of other attempts is typically suggested/required for a young dog to  have to suffer thru before ​surgery is considered an option?

  
Also sorry if this ​is phrased weirdly, just expressed his glads after his bath (found out during the bath, can't do that at petvalu). He cried, I'll admit I wanted to cry. I went thru this with a previous pup but he was tough as nails and it didn't start till he was too old to risk surgery.

Any advice is appreciated, I hate seeing him in pain and hate myself for having to cause him pain ​so he can poo.",1,1768159964.0,AskAVeterinarian,0,1.0,False

Explore the heart of Venice with an exclusive, in-depth tour that takes you through the city’s most iconic landmarks—an unparalleled immersion into the splendour of Venice’s past.

Doge's Palace

Venice's Seat of Power and Grandeur (1.5 hours)

The journey begins at the majestic Doge’s Palace, the heart of Venetian politics and culture. As we step inside this architectural marvel, we’ll explore its magnificent Golden Staircase and the Grand Council Chamber, where Venetian history was written. Here, your guide will take you through the complex political structure of the Venetian Republic, the pivotal role of the Doge, and the city’s astonishing influence across the Mediterranean. We’ll also visit the elegant Sala del Maggior Consiglio, adorned with breathtaking Renaissance frescoes, as well as the stunning Private Chambers of the Doge, revealing how the powerful leader lived.

The prison

The Prisons: From Glory to Shadows 

After immersing ourselves in the grandeur of the Doge’s Palace, we cross the iconic Bridge of Sighs into the Prisons, where we’ll discover the darker side of Venetian life. The stark contrast between the opulent palace and the grim reality of the prison cells offers a unique glimpse into the city’s justice system. As we explore the cold, narrow corridors, your guide will share stories of the prisoners who passed through these walls, including those who challenged the Venetian Republic’s power and the gripping tales of their incarcerated lives.

St. Mark’s Basilica: A Masterpiece of Byzantine Art

Next, we head to the heart of Venice: the stunning Basilica of St. Mark. This extraordinary cathedral, with its shimmering golden mosaics and intricate architecture, stands as a testament to Venice’s deep ties with the Byzantine Empire. As we explore the basilica’s sacred interior, your guide will highlight its remarkable Pala d’Oro (Golden Altarpiece) and the dazzling Mosaic Galleries, each one telling stories from Christian history. The basilica’s unique blend of Eastern and Western influences offers an unparalleled visual feast and a deeper understanding of Venice’s spiritual and cultural legacy.

Piazza San Marco: Venice’s Timeless Heart

We conclude our tour in the iconic Piazza San Marco, the vibrant and historic heart of the city. Here, you’ll have the opportunity to soak in the beauty of the surrounding architecture, including the Campanile, the Doge’s Palace, and the Basilica, while reflecting on the grand history that has shaped this city.

Anyways, I slowly changed my diet and avoided the common trigger foods about 8 months ago, and maybe since halfway through that, smells such as tobacco, perfumes, cleaning chemicals/dyes like dishwashing liquid, and the smell of vegetable/seed oil frying, and coffee and bread all make me nauseous, dazed, and my existing flares worse.

I experienced better stomach nausea after the initial diet but feel ingrained flares didn’t go away. I am now changing to a low carb diet, pretty much only carbs being bananas, sweet potatoes, and carrots, also no vinegar or fermented foods either. A few months ago I also stopped smoking weed (typically through glass so not extra contamination) and since the smells have triggered me even worse.

In *My Year of Rest and Relaxation*, the unnamed narrator, a 27-year-old Columbia graduate who was recently fired from an art gallery but is able to live off money she inherited from her dead parents, just wants to spend the next year “hibernating” in her apartment in the Upper East Side of New York—sleeping, popping pills, and watching VHS tapes—between June 2000 and June 2001. She only leaves to pick up her prescriptions and coffee and snacks from a nearby bodega. She’s doing this with the help of her psychiatrist, Dr. Tuttle, a quack who’s all too willing to exploit every loophole possible to get her patient’s many prescriptions filled. The only things interrupting her hibernation are visits from her best—actually, only—friend, Reva; her obsession with her ex, Trevor; the often unpleasant memories of her parents; and the occasional medication that proves to be ineffective. 

Based on that short summary, it’s probably fair to say this book isn’t going to be for everyone. The narrator doesn’t have many redeeming qualities: For starters, she’s trying to avoid her problems instead of facing them head-on—and she knows it. She lies to get what she wants and is not above using her beauty to get ahead. And she’s cold, sometimes cruel, to Reva, who’s self-absorbed but one of the only people willing to put up her abuse. 

Despite the narrator’s rudeness and questionable life choices, what makes *My Year of Rest and Relaxation* such a page-turner is the her candor and wit. She’s shallow, but other than her psychiatrist and the unemployment office, she’s not trying to fool anyone. She’s intelligent, even though her ideas are often misguided. Yet her keen observations show that despite her incessant brain fog, she seems to be more self-aware than the people around her who think they have it together. 

Some of the passages are quite outrageous, yet in the context of the novel, they’re not just there for shock value. They provide further insight into the narrator’s mindset, though that may still not make it easy for some readers. 

*My Year of Rest and Relaxation* is both a sad and funny story. Some may end up getting angry when they reach the last page, and that’s understandable, but no matter what, it’s not the type of novel you’ll end up falling asleep to.",54,1768159747.0,IReadABookAndAdoredIt,10,1.0,False

Our sewer line recently froze and after spending $5k to try and thaw it we have determined that the line most likely collapsed or frostheaved. We think the main house was originally built in the 70s. The sewer cleanout is PVC. When doing hot water flushed and pumping water out I noticed coffee ground type material and some black flecks. Originally I attributed this to actual coffee grounds and gunk build up on the pipe (the pipe run gradient is unfortunately pretty flat). We are concerned about orangeburgh pipe and having to replace the entire sewer line (\~100 feet)….in January…with the ground frozen. At the location of the block we think the pipe is around 2ft bgs and where the city main is it is about 6ft bgs. For folks that have been through this..how much did replacement cost? Does orangeburgh usually extend into the house plumbing? Like where you need to start tearing out floors?

How do you know if you have orangeburgh without digging it up? We plan on trying to get a camera down there in the next few days to confirm location of the collapse and see if we can tell the type of piping.

Any insight is appreciated! We just spent out house improvement savings on heat pumps so this unexpected expense is very unsettling and upsetting 🤦‍♀️

**What's up Austin!**

I'm Alex and I'm a local weirdo looking to design and implement technical solutions for your web- and computer-shaped problems.

I'm really good at making websites in particular and I'm offering all kinds of help for everyone and anyone -- individuals, smaller businesses, up to medium sized businesses if you want bespoke custom solutions for your existing workflows. My rates are super flexible. Send me a dm and let's figure it out, I'm open to working for just $100 up to $10,000+ depending on the complexity of your request.

----

**My Services and Skills**

What I'm offering: professional web and custom software development services from a real person -- me, Alex, local weirdo -- at very affordable, clear rates with clear working expectations up front with a very well-defined deliverable.

In other words, you come to me sad and annoyed because computers are annoying AF and I make you happy by making your stuff just work better and in that process at some point you pay me actual, legal tender in US dollars -- cash or digital. That's it.

* Websites -- enhancing yours, or making something new.
* Webapps -- complex and interactive.
* External integrations between services.
* Internal automations and scripting for data processing, entry, etc.
* Server expertise -- can make stuff on the cloud for you and let it run on a schedule, managed for you without stress.
* Extremely clear written and verbal communication, always: before working together, you will receive and approve a clear up-front well-defined specification of the expected deliverable.

**My Portfolio of Work**

*Real products that do real things.*

**Communication**

*Email and GH issues are great.*

If we work together, communication will mostly go through email and GitHub issues -- I prefer written, async comms where there is no ambiguity for either you as my client or for me as your developer.

*Phone or video call work too.*

I also offer my time via phone or video call where we dive deep into your pain points and requirements in terms of the solutions that you want (initial consult is always free, if an ongoing relationship is established, built into the contract).

*The physical realm also exists.*

Happy to meet you at a coffee shop of your choice and chat in-person as well. I like Bennu on MLK!

----

**My History**

I'm real btw -- I'm an odd bird. Prior to getting (back) into software, I've been a pedicab driver for 3 years because having a boss sucks, and before that, I was a guide at a ketamine clinic. And before that, I was a bohemian and before that I was a student at Oklahoma State where I graduated with degrees in Philosophy and Math. And before that, in high school, my dad was teaching me how to configure the DNS for me and my friend's Minecraft servers and I was applying custom ROMs to my Android and installing CentOS onto old desktops for fun.

I'm now 28. I live on the east side of Austin and love our city and was born and raised here. Go Wood. I call the water TOWN LAKE as it should be called. And I've even got a 512 phone number for you to ring.

----

**FAQ**

*Do you use AI?*

--> Yes, duh -- if that bothers you, my services are not for you! AI is an incredible technology -- I mostly use it as an *extremely fast text editor* for implementing solutions by my own design.

*What's your stack?*

--> You own the stuff I make for you, not me. It's yours and you can license it and host it however you want. When hosting for you, I'll put your stuff online using Cloudflare Pages. If it's complex or requires ""continuous compute"" there might be a server process involved that I'll provision for you on Digital Ocean or something else like Hetzner probably. You get to choose whether the stuff is in your account with these providers or if you want me to manage it for you that's fine too (might or might not incur add'l charges, we'll discuss, I already have personal servers running where I host stuff for people).

For websites and webapps, I use Astro https://astro.build/ -- Astro is a ""meta framework"" for building on the web -- it's known for being great at delivering static content-driven websites, but with React + TanStack involved it's actually better than Next.js for almost all use cases including dynamic interactivity.

If your website is simple, I'll just use raw html/css with no framework. For stuff that's not on the web -- I'll use node JS/TS, bash, python, or Swift.

*How do we start?*

--> Send me a DM here on Reddit with your ask and we'll take it from there -- I'll send you my email if you are a real person.",3,1768159458.0,austinjobs,0,0.8,False
1qa8doh,https://www.reddit.com/r/workplace_bullying/comments/1qa8doh/several_of_my_coworkers_are_two_faced_towards_me/,Several of my coworkers are two faced towards me.,"Recently I have noticed that several of my coworkers only seem to like me or interact with me if I buy them things. They judge me becuase of things I either enjoy or don’t have a problem with like they do. Recently my coworkers were talking about furries this conversation to me is a little questionable becuase as I don’t own a fursuit I think the people who make them are pretty cool becuase projects like that take a lot of time and dedication and a lot of them are really cool looking. I don’t own one or plan on owning one but I don’t have a problem with people’s hobbies outside of work. I noticed my coworkers talking about it making very weird assumptions like oh “furries like to fuck animals” or “furries use litter boxes or that they apparently go to the restroom outside like a dog” they asked me my opinion and I just said I think they are cool and honestly those things cost a lot of money. They looked at me in disgust. They said oh well “why would you spend money on that, why waste” I said in response that a lot of people make money off that and that it’s a hobby and people spend money on hobbies. I mean if you have a hobbies like art of something you spend money to make art yes? And then they proceeded to accuse of using a litter box and then proceeded to accuse me of fucking animals which ofc I denied because I don’t do that. That is actually disgusting and weird as hell. I personally don’t have a problem with what people do outside or work becuase if it doesn’t bother me in anyway that actually effects me negatively then I just don’t care, who am I to judge what people do outside of work unless it’s actually illegal. These are also the same coworkers that are only truly nice to me when I buy them food or coffee. My coworkers always seem to make me look like a joke. They always pick on me for being white or the way I speak Spanish just anything in general that they know would bother me. But when money food or coffee is involved they are the nicest to me. I don’t know what to do and genuinely it makes me go home in tears everyday because it does hurt that they would accuse me of things like that and then just pick on me for their own amusement. Please I need to know what to do in this situation because it hurts that I spend my hard earned money on people that act nice only when it’s convenient to them. I can quit this job unfortunately because it is my only income but just any advice or people who aren’t judgmental I’d definitely could use some good advice to deal with this.

1qa8ae7,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/1qa8ae7/mbb_and_almost_no_friends_outside_of_consulting/,MBB and almost no friends outside of consulting?,"Did some annual review and reflected on this. I realized that since starting at my MBB, I almost have zero \*deep\* friendships outside of consulting anymore.

The main reasons for me are twofold:

1. The hours: my free-time is basically narrowed to late Friday evening to Sunday evening (occasionally Thursday evening). In that time I need to pack-in quality time with my significant other, running (prepping for a marathon), going to the gym and all the other stuff of life (like sometimes I just want to watch a show or do absolutely nothing).
2. The social interactions during the week: on the study/project, I am being surrounded almost 24/7 by young people either in the office or in my team. That is, I constantly have interactions such as team-dinners, Barrys (group workouts), coffee,etc. - I reckon if I would work in a more normal-corporate environment my peer-group would be older and I would get much less almost friendship like interactions out of them. My ""colleauges"" actually feel like how friends in University feel like. But still they are not private friends and are also scattered across different offices. So its not like we would hang out on the weekend.

\---

Now what does this mean? I am currently trying to synthesize the implications of this mode of living myself, but it definitely does not feel healthy.

I would love to have a circle of friends outside of this bubbly again but I am stuck building it up. Having friends takes time, effort and is not something that just pops off on the-go.

I feel a bit stuck on this and would love to hear some thoughts from other consultants. Maybe you have been or are in a similar situation and can let me know how you deal with it.",17,1768159194.0,consulting,10,0.87,False
1qa8a86,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChaseSapphire/comments/1qa8a86/the_edit_montreal_fairmont_queen_anne/,The Edit: Montreal Fairmont Queen Anne,"**Location**: If you are arriving by train (links to Ottowa, NYC, Quebec, and Toronto) the location is great: it sits directly above the train station.   If you are in town for chain store shopping (including high end chains), the location is great: it is directly connected to the Reso (""underground city"", which is effectively a series of connected shopping malls and office towers), and 2 blocks from St Catherine street, which will have things like Urban Outfitters, Victoria Secrets, etc.  

Notably, this is one of the best hotels if you are going to see an event at the Bell Center as it is a short walk underground (or above ground) or via the metro.  

Montreal is a big destination for bachelor parties: there are two strip clubs within 3 blocks, 2 more within a 12 minute walk, and 2 more within a 20 minute walk. 

Montreal is also a big destination for music, and here the hotel is lacking. The cluster of hotels 10-120 minutes east (by foot) have better access to both the festival locations, the jazz clubs, and the rock clubs. Those clubs also have better access to the Christmas villages and other outdoor winter recreation options.

**The EDIT:**

Room upgrade: ""we upgraded you to a view."" The view was of a plaza facing st catherine street and the one ring to rule them all, it was nice. 

$100 credit: ""We want you to have the full value and at the current exchange rate,  this is $127 Canadian.""  The exchange rate at the time was $1.39/1. Honestly, this was more irritating than anything, if they hadn't referenced the actual exchange rate and had just said it was $127, I would have been less irritated.  

The $127 credit could be used on food only, not the spa, nor parking.    Speaking of parking, the valet was full and I had to self park a few blocks away. isn't the whole point of valet parking that they arrange for overflow?

Late checkout: 2pm, but they didn't guarantee it until after 5pm on the day before checkout.

Breakfast: on day one the line for breakfast was so long that I didn't bother, on day two I did get breakfast.  I'm not a big breakfast person, and what I wanted was a fruit salad and perhaps a bit of cheese.  They had lots of fruit, and the coffee was sufficient. 

Hotel dining:  we had lunch in the only open restaurant one day, and it was poor.  Likewise, morning coffee from the coffee stands ($5 CAD) was not very good.  I ordered room service one night, and that was surprisingly good.  The glass of medoc was excellent as was my meal. They were a bit slow in delivering it, and included some nice chocolate to make up for it.

Welcome gift: a plate of stale macaroons. 

**The room:**  
The room was smaller than you'd get at a newer ""4 star hotel.""  The bathroom was poorly though out (basically no towel hooks), but well appointed in terms of amenities.  A huge amount of real estate in the room was taken up by the minibar and other pressure sensitive price things.   There were some free mineral waters in the room that seemed popular with other guests, but I wasn't a fan of the taste.   Irritatingly, there was no mini-fridge aside from the mini bar, so if you wanted to store milk or white wine, you were SOL. 

**Ammenities:**   
The gym is standard, the pool is nice, but small. I didn't use the SPA. The lobby was comfortable, and the staff was helpful when I asked for directions. 

**Final verdict:**   
Montreal has a number of nice 3-4 star hotels that i find more comfortable due to bigger rooms, nicer bathrooms, mini fridges, better coffee amenities,  and are typically 40% the price..  Those hotels weren't on The Edit, and the Ritz and Four Seasons were much more expensive.   I would stay here again if I was going to a Habs game and had an Edit credit to use, but otherwise, I'd rather pay for hotels that fit my style a bit more. ",1,1768159183.0,ChaseSapphire,0,1.0,False

1qa89gp,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1qa89gp/there_are_two_types_of_adhd_coping_mechanisms/,There are two types of ADHD coping mechanisms,"A. The ""blame the universe; nobody could have foreseen this!"" response 
B. The ""develop rigid rules and hypervigilence over anticipating mistakes"" response 

Example of A. My father-in-law is cooking. He is not wearing an apron. He splashes oil over his new jeans. When asked why he's not wearing an apron he says, with complete lack of irony, ""the oil just splashed up out of nowhere! I didn't expect it!"" As if that's not something that happens every 2 minutes when you are cooking with oil.

Example of B. I'm making coffee. I get asked to plug in the coffee grinder on top of the stove, resting it on the unheated element, to not have to unplug the kettle to power the device. I'm like, ""Sorry, I can't, I have a rule that any item that can't take heat I'm not allowed to put on the stove, because I've melted and ruined things before.""

 I do think women are pushed to develop more type B coping mechanisms because they are expected to be organized. I have rules dating back to childhood, such as ""look behind you when you leave any space to see if you're forgetting something"" that were drilled into me, which i do find genuinely helpful.

By contrast, my father-in- law once fell off the roof because he didn't wear a fall harness and was surprised when he fell, as that wasn't the plan... Anyway, oil stains are small potatoes by comparison, I guess. I think he'll go through life being defensive over silly things like apron use, as he never thinks the bad thing will ever happen to him. It's a bit frustrating. 

That said, I do think hypervigilence can have negative effects -- where I expect and plan for bad things to happen, where I feel responsible for flukes of chance that aren't actually all that reasonable to prepare for. And aside from the risks to bodily safety, and boneheadness of ignoring basic safety protocols when doing work at heights, it's often nice to be around someone who's so positive about everything all the time!

I'm sometimes in Category A myself -- when my ADHD symptoms get away from me, when I don't keep to my work or self care plans, and I'm like ""who could have foreseen this?"" As I'm drowning in work before a deadline having procrastinated for 5 days straight.

1qa87x5,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLettersRaw/comments/1qa87x5/maybe_its_for_the_best/,Maybe It's For The Best.,"I'm so fucking mad at you, and I don't even know how to explain it. So, I will write to the best of my ability - hoping to make sense of it all. 

In retrospect, seems like you were pushing our mutual to get in contact with me. I thought it was her pushing it, which honestly - I got annoyed with because I've been in a relationship for a long time. It was funny, how I was only out of it for two weeks and then you wanted to hang out. I thought maybe it was a sign from the universe, but I think you were more of a test.   
  
Now that everything has transpired - It seems like you wanted more than I could give, and now are mad that I'm not in a relationship with you in your own time. It wasn't fair for you to dump your feelings on me so directly upon our first hangout, where I thought we were friends. Like sure, you want to date. But I just told you that my break up was messy, and that I didn't know what was going to happen - and mostly importantly, I didn't have much to give. That I needed time before I even considered that. That my ex wasn't accepting the break-up, and I didn't know what would happen. You and I had only met a handful of times prior, and I didn't know you outside of our mutual. I don't know you, and that's really apparent now.  

Yet there you sat on that first meeting, talking about how if we ever dated you don't like ""girls nights out"" because if I wasn't going to get all dolled up for you, than why would you allow that? But it was okay for me to hang out with our mutual, and only our mutual. So first of all, thanks for making assumptions. With every single one of my exes, they never gave me the opportunity to dress up. They'd hardly take me out anywhere. If I was ever given the opportunity, I'd fucking go all out both for myself on a girls night and a date night...   
  
Nobody in my past or present has ever given me that opportunity, or on the slight chance they tried to appease me, they'd get mad coz I took too long or bail on plans completely, sometimes without even telling me. I spent hours waiting one time, after I got myself dolled up specifically for him. I vowed to myself that I'd never put myself through that again.  

The whole thing is stupid. Because I hardly drink anyways or go out, and the only time I did in the duration that I've known you was at a Christmas Party, trying to escape my feelings of everything and everyone. I didn't tell anyone that though, how fucked up I was. It only made it worse. Also, I don't go out with my female friends to get flirted with, or cheat on people. I'm not like that. I've been always loyal to a fault, and it's kept me (and has been keeping me) in places where I no longer belong. But it has made it difficult to tell if I'd be able to keep my platonic male friends if anything did happen between us.   
  
But the other thing is, and I say this at a point of care from a new friend perspective - is that you still have a lot of anger at previous relationships in your life. It's okay, that's normal. I'm still pretty mad at all of the cheating, abuse and horrible things I went through, too. But the difference between us is - I try to see the good in people. I've been in therapy the whole time I've known our mutual, and throughout the last two years of my intensely abusive ex (the ex before this one). Even with the SA, his attempts at hurting me, killing me, etc., I don't believe that everyone is horrible, and is going to cheat on me or hurt me in some way. Maybe I'm naive for giving benefit of the doubt. But I ultimately believe that there is so much good out there in the world - my problem is that I keep trying to staunch the bleeding on wounds that I never left, and I accept them lashing out like I gave them the wounds. I stay, because it's in me to give, to heal, to love and nurture.

When it comes to you - it just seemed like you're looking for someone to unload on. 

I can't do that to myself anymore. I'm so depleted from everything going on in my own life. I can't play therapist/mom/maid/etc., in relationships or friendships anymore. 

I get that you're hurt by your past. Believe me, I understand it. However, I can't be your emotional whipping post for it all. Even as I just tried being your friend, even just general conversation you got insanely snippy with me. If I tried to get into the dumb politic conversations with you, you tried to lash out and hurt me when I debated your point. Which was hilarious, because you just assumed what my religion was the one time - all because I said that I didn't agree about it being a Christian country, and then attacked Atheism. I'm neither of those, but go off -  I guess. Kind of had to laugh when you started going off about all of the pagan crazies, and what they used to do. All was inaccurate to history texts, but you weren't listening enough for that.   
  
From our first hang out to our last phone conversation - I found out some of the lies and inconsistencies you've told. I tried to ask you for a coffee to talk things out, coz maybe it was my own damage putting a filter over everything - but it just seemed like every time I reached out, you were too busy, or you had to work (which then I found out was a lie - did you forget that we have a mutual person that you spent the holiday with?). I thought maybe we could enter 2026 on the same page, but I don't think we ever were. 

It broke my heart, honestly. I was just really excited to have a friend that lived in town. More people to connect with, go have fun with (ie. like community events, hiking, etc., not drinking), and maybe it could've eventually flourished into something more later on. But ultimately, you showed your true colors pretty early on, and I thank you for that because I can't put myself through the red flag carnival again, even on a friend level. 

So, maybe it's for the best we don't talk or hang out anymore. 

Because even the way you've been talking about our mutuals, who happen to be women - has been really bugging me as well. I have a lot of respect for both of them, and some of the shit you've been calling them down on isn't okay. That pisses me off more than anything. 

So, goodbye for now. Hopefully, after writing all of this...the anger will leave my body, and I can begin on untangling more of my shit. Thank you for the lesson. I don't hate you, never could. I just don't think we're compatible as anything other than friends, and you don't want that. And honestly, I don't think I want it anymore either. ",3,1768159038.0,UnsentLettersRaw,4,1.0,False

1qa831x,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qa831x,Saving $900 on a coffee grind size analyzer,"I recently purchased a new Timemore 064s and got curious about the correlation between grind settings, particle size distribution, and espresso extraction times. While I initially considered buying a professional coffee grind size analyzer, the steep $900 price tag for a casual hobbyist felt excessive.

""Why not DIY it?"" I thought.

My method is straightforward: I spread coffee grounds on a letter-sized piece of paper, place a ruler next to the sample for scale, and take a photo using my Pixel phone. I then wrote a Python script to detect the coffee particles and calculate their sizes.

Here are the initial results from my Timemore 064s set to 2.8:

* **Photo 1:** The final size distribution results, which look reasonably accurate to me based on my understanding on the typical espresso grind size distribution
* **Photo 2:** The original image with the ruler reference.
* **Photo 3:** My Python script's particle detection shown with yellow contours. It showed good capture rate on the coffee grounds .

1qa82wa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Manifestationmoney/comments/1qa82wa/decide_who_you_are/,DECIDE WHO YOU ARE!,"I have been an observer on here for a couple of years. I felt the need to post on here for all those that have “wanted to manifest” whatever.
Please hear me. The 3D will NEVER reflect what you want: a car, a job, a relationship, money, etc., until you change you from the INSIDE out. 
Now some will say: I’m doing all the techniques: script, 369, affirmations etc. The technique may work - I’m not making fun of anyone trying any of them. They are all good techniques IF you KNOW and BELIEVE that your manifestations come to pass. 
Small things come to pass: a cup of coffee, an open parking space, a compliment. You put those small, minor gifts (let’s call them that) because they mean nothing to you. You would dismiss them after they happen anyway.
It’s the big things (or so you think): money, relationship, even health! They become the obstacle that cannot be achieved. Or it is in the future. 
Heads up: you DECIDE it is the obstacle or it is easy. I saw this as a post: suffering is a choice. Isn’t that the truth?
Now having something going on health wise someone might say here that I’m going too far or I don’t understand.
Well how many success stories on here that have changed their appearance, height, weight and it was all manifested. Same with tumors preventing growing is P53 “the guardian of the genome”. Go look it up. 
Any amount of money, any relationship or health (I’m sure there are categories)  can easily happen immediately. 
How?
Well let’s go back to Neville’s Abdullah encounter regarding going to Barbados. It was DECIDED by Abdullah that Neville was already in Barbados. And Neville kept saying: but how? Abdullah slammed the door in Neville’s face when Neville questioned “being in Barbados! If you haven’t read it, go look it up.
Again, all of these successful stories on here are great to hear. 
What do all them have in common?:Eh success story was achieved when that individual CHOSE and DECIDED that they had changed! Changed their self concept. Their inner view changed so their outer view “mirrored” the inside. As above, so below.
So here is a good suggestion if you choose to see if this works.
Take an appearance or grade thing because I feel that it is something that you can decide to change for the better.
I did this and received numerous compliments. I said out loud: I decided that I have a flat stomach, and that I glow from the inside out, and I receive compliments all the time. 
And have repeated numerous times. 
I went to meet some friends and one of my friends said I looked fantastic and that I am positively glowing! Exact words!
I decided that would happen.
Now it’s a small thing, I know. Almost superficial to be honest.
Here is another concept: you decide how every conversation, every encounter, every everything goes. It is only the fact that our subconscious runs the memory / image factory in our heads. We go with the usual until we decide to override it with anything new.
When we decide that no longer works, the subconscious will do everything to keep us “safe”. Even if it is bad or less than ideal. God (still each one of us and subconsciously) will say yes because it thinks it is keeping us in safety pattern.
Go within: see the money, feel the relationship, feel perfect health. As soon as negative thoughts come up, say no thank you that is not me anymore. 
Say I decided that from now on, I’m wealth, I’m always healthy, I’m loved. Don’t check the 3d it’s really a hologram.
We are just a bunch of atoms repelling each other. In a sense we are hovering over the Earth. So we do reality shift because every dimension is happening now.
YOU DECIDE WHO YOU ARE!
I hope someone gets this today.

But the star of the drink menu was their cocktail list. Their head bartender is extremely experienced and made some really well-crafted cocktails. Only knock is that the cocktails come in smaller glasses.

**Pasta:** ok so we tried their lobster rigatoni and let me just say… this was incredible. Their pasta is made right at the bar, they use simple ingredients and I believe no eggs, so the pasta doesn’t sit heavy and everything was just so well made. 

Overall, it’s also affordable with a good happy hour deal. I will be back and if you are looking for a great date night, solo dinner, or just good time - definitely worth it. Also I think they do coffee and pastries on the morning!",6,1768158654.0,uppereastside,5,0.8,False
1qa80wl,https://www.reddit.com/r/survivinginfidelity/comments/1qa80wl/me_30f_and_my_boyfriend_34m_of_2_years_broke_up/,Me (30F) and my boyfriend (34M) of 2 years broke up because I caught him cheating with a married woman who has two kids.,"We were together for two years, and almost since the beginning we always had problems. The first few months were great, having fun, sharing a lot, being sexually intimate, except for him being pushy about marriage way too early. I always tried to convince him to go with the flow, telling him that when it’s time, we’ll get there, and that it was too soon. He always resented me for this and brought it up in almost every argument afterward. For the past few months of the relationship he was openly saying that he doesn’t want marriage or kids anymore which felt odd. 

He had a good job, but a few months after we started dating he began having problems at work and eventually got fired in June 2024. After that, he was unemployed until June 2025, an entire year. During that time, he moved into my apartment because he couldn’t pay rent. I took care of him financially and emotionally.

He was very depressed and started taking medication, which affected his sex drive. We basically stopped having sex, maybe 2–3 times total from then until now. I tried to talk about it and offered support, but he was always very closed off, saying it was about his manhood and he didn’t want to discuss it. I still tried to initiate sometimes, but I was constantly rejected, which made me feel insecure, unwanted, and unworthy.

I became angry at him and at myself, but I kept believing that everything would change once he found a job.

When he finally started his new job, the change I expected never came. I assumed he would start contributing to rent and bills once he got paid, but nothing changed. I was struggling to cover everything for two people, even lending him money from time to time. I kept making excuses for him, thinking maybe he needed more time or had debts to pay.

In July, I went on a three week vacation to my hometown abroad. He stayed home to take care of our dog, whom we adopted during those dark days when he was unemployed and depressed. While I was away, he became distant and unresponsive. I thought he was just depressed again.

When I got back, I immediately felt something was off. In the following weeks and months, he was extremely distant, always out, never spending time with me, barely able to sit with me. I tried multiple times to talk about it, but he said he was depressed and needed to be alone. I kept giving him space, hoping it would pass. It never did.

I became depressed myself, crying in bed, feeling constantly abandoned, unloved, and unwanted. I tried to numb the pain with food, gained weight, and stopped recognizing myself. I felt disgusting and ashamed. Meanwhile, he seemed fine, working from coffee shops, never at home. He said he was doing Uber as a side hustle because his pay wasn’t enough, which was strange since he wasn’t contributing financially at all.

I had a gut feeling something was wrong.

Eventually, I found the courage to look through his personal belongings. In his backpack, I found medical papers belonging to a woman, dated one day before I returned from my trip four months earlier. The content was disturbing, it looked like she had been beaten. I confronted him. He said she was an old friend who needed help and that her husband had done it to her.

I wasn’t satisfied and asked if he was seeing someone else. He denied it. I asked to see his phone, he refused. Then he admitted he had been messaging multiple women on Instagram. He cried, apologized, and claimed he never met anyone in person. He said he was trying to feed his ego and understand whether his sexual problems were about me or him. He claimed the issue was him, not me.

He manipulated me by saying he had nowhere to go, that he would live in his car, that he couldn’t live without me or our dog. I felt bad and let him stay.

Meanwhile, he started looking for a place, suggesting separate homes might fix things. A few days later, he excitedly showed me a mug warmer he bought. I didn’t think much of it.

The next day, he said he was going to see a male friend. After he left, I checked his backpack again and found a gift card, almost like a love letter, signed with the same name as on the medical papers. I also found sexual performance pills.

The card said:

“I know that the most beautiful years of my life will be spent with you, and I hope this year will be a new beginning for us, the first step of everything. One day, when your coffee gets cold, I’ll refresh it for you. Until then, may your coffee stay warm, my love.”

I was devastated and sent him a photo immediately. He first claimed it was an old card. I told him it was clearly for the mug warmer. He came back and confessed everything. He said it was “only sexual,” that he used pills to have sex, that it started around July. He claimed he felt nothing for her and that he loved me. But also said our relationship was over long ago we were like roommates while he had been begging for forgiveness for the past week and was saying he only loved me. 

I told him to leave. He packed a few things and left, then continued trying to manipulate me, saying he would sleep in his car and needed to come back for more things.

After the shock wore off, I started digging deeper. I found toll pass records for both his car and mine. It turns out he had been seeing this woman since at least May while unemployed, living under my roof, eating my food, borrowing my money, asking for my love and understanding. Every time he “went out,” it was to see her, 75 minutes away, sometimes almost every day, even using my car.

Now he’s moved somewhere close to her. Probably laughing behind my back at my stupidity for two years.

Everyone tells me to get over it, that it was his fault, that I deserve better, that he was terrible. I know all of these logically, but I don’t feel better. It’s only been two weeks. I started therapy and I’m trying, but every day somehow feels worse.

I feel empty, ashamed, used, worthless, angry, and deeply sad. Nothing positive. This is me trying to let it out. I never imagined something like this could happen to me, but it did.

I want to move on, but I’ve become obsessed with both of them, constantly searching for information, replaying everything and it’s draining me.

I know this is a long story, if you make it to the end, thank you! I don’t know what I am looking for, just wanted to share for a little relief.

We don’t need caffeine; even times when I had barely any sleep the night before, I’m able to go about my day without a need for it. There are occasions where caffeine is needed like your studying and you want to pull an all nighter but even those instances energy drinks don’t need to be used. Caffeine shouldn’t be used so widely by everybody because it has created this dependent on it where some people drink 4-5 cups a day because “they need it.” We don’t need to be wired to enjoy life. I personally love going about my day feeling neutral. I feel more in touch with reality as opposed to having this jolt of energy that my body doesn’t need.

One cup of flour. 
One cup fat. (I combine ghee, bacon drippings and beef tallow.  Ghee is 75% of my mix) 
Cook on low heat until chocolate brown.

1qa7vqs,https://i.redd.it/v2pb5ccdqrcg1.jpeg,Sensory Marketing: How Feelings Drive Sales:,"
Ever wonder why coffee shops smell like fresh pastries or why certain stores play specific music? It’s sensory marketing—a deliberate strategy that speaks directly to your subconscious.

The Brain’s Response

When you enter a store, your brain processes dozens of signals simultaneously. The scent of cinnamon might trigger childhood memories, while dim lighting creates intimacy. Research shows the right sensory atmosphere increases customer dwell time by up to 40%.

Our memory favors scents over visual images. Brands exploit this by creating signature fragrances that build emotional connections.

Scent as an Invisible Salesperson

Bakeries deliberately channel air currents to spread bread aromas outside. Vanilla scents boost women’s clothing sales, while leather works in premium car dealerships. Luxury hotels develop unique lobby fragrances that guests unconsciously associate with comfort.

Music Controls Time

Fast-paced music speeds up movement—fast-food chains use this during rush hours. Slow music encourages lingering. Classical music in wine shops increases average purchase value; people subconsciously choose pricier bottles when hearing Mozart.

Light Shapes Emotions

Warm lighting creates coziness in cafés. Cool white light sharpens focus in electronics stores. Dim lighting in luxury boutiques suggests exclusivity.

Color matters too. Red stimulates appetite (fast food), blue builds trust (banks), green signals health (organic stores).

Touch Sells

Physical interaction dramatically increases purchase likelihood. Cosmetic testers, furniture you can sit on—touching creates a sense of ownership before buying. Even packaging texture influences perception: rough paper feels eco-friendly, glossy surfaces signal premium quality.

The Rhythm of Space

Well-designed retail spaces choreograph customer movement through alternating wide and narrow passages, accent zones, and lighting changes. Customers follow predetermined routes, stopping at strategic points.

When Senses Work Against Us

Pleasant atmospheres can override critical thinking, making us buy things we don’t need. Understanding these mechanisms helps us stay conscious consumers.

The Future

Virtual reality stores are creating complete sensory immersion. AI analyzes customer reactions and adapts atmospheres in real-time. Soon, shopping spaces might read your mood and adjust lighting, music, and scents accordingly.

Sensory marketing is the art of creating perfect buying atmospheres. The more we understand these mechanisms, the more conscious our choices become.

**Your daily advantage. Read time: 2 minutes.**

# 🔥 EXECUTIVE NEWS BRIEF (VERIFIED)

# 1. VALENTINE'S DAY 2026: THE ""DARK ROMANCE"" SHIFT

Search data for V-Day 2026 is showing a massive shift away from traditional bright red/pink decor.

* **The Trend:** ""Dark Romance"" and ""Goth aesthetic"" searches related to V-Day are up over 300% YoY. Think: Black tapered candles, deep velvet textures, and ""moody"" date night setups.
* **The Opportunity:** If you are in the Home/Decor niche, pivot your content. A ""Moody Date Night at Home"" video will likely outperform a generic ""Pink Heart Decor"" video right now.
* **Source:** eRank / Google Trends 2026 Forecast

# 2. THE FBA FEE COUNTDOWN (4 DAYS LEFT)

On Thursday, **Jan 15, 2026**, the new FBA fulfillment fees kick in (avg +$0.08/unit).

* **Why it Matters:** Expect sellers of low-margin items (<$10) to raise their prices between now and Thursday to absorb the cost.
* **Action:** Watch your best-selling ""cheap"" items. A product priced at $9.99 might jump to $10.49 next week. This is normal; don't panic if conversion dips slightly as customers adjust.
* **Source:** Amazon Seller Central 2026 Fee Schedule

# 3. AUDIT ACTION: SPOTTING ""FRANKENSTEIN"" LISTINGS

Following the news about the **Feb 12 Review Split Policy**, you need to audit your catalog *today*.

* **The Risk:** If you have a top-performing video on a product with 10k reviews, but 8k of those reviews are for a completely different item (e.g., a phone case listing merged with a USB cable), that product is about to lose its social proof.
* **Action:** Go to your top 10 best-selling videos. Scroll to the ""Customer Reviews"" and filter by ""All formats."" If you see photos of products that *aren't* what you reviewed, mark that product as ""At Risk"" for a conversion drop next month.

# 🧠 STRATEGY DEEP DIVE: THE ""GALENTINE'S"" PIVOT

*Stop selling only to ""Couples"" and start selling to ""Friends.""*

**The Insight:** Spending for **""Galentine's Day""** (celebrating female friendship, Feb 13) has grown double-digits for three straight years. While the individual item price is often lower, the *volume* is higher because people buy for 3-5 friends instead of just one partner.

**High-Traffic ""Galentine"" Items to Review This Week:**

1. **""Spa Night"" Bundles:** Under-$30 sets of face masks, jade rollers, or high-end headbands (High margin, low return rate).
2. **Aesthetic Glassware:** Sets of 4 coupe glasses or ""can-shaped"" iced coffee cups (still viral on TikTok/IG Reels).
3. **Matching Loungewear:** ""Cloud slippers"" and matching robes are currently peaking in search.

**The Script Hook:** *""Don't get your bestie another boring gift card. Here is the ultimate $30 Galentine's box she actually wants...""*

# 💡 TRICK OF THE DAY: THE ""UNAVAILABLE"" FILTER

*How to quickly clean up your storefront for Q1.*

**The Routine:**

1. Go to your Amazon Storefront (Desktop view).
2. Press `Ctrl + F` (or `Cmd + F`) and type **""Currently Unavailable.""**
3. **The Fix:** If you find videos in your Idea Lists for products that are permanently out of stock, **delete or hide them**.
4. **Why:** Sending traffic to dead-end product pages hurts your ""Influencer Conversion Rate"" and frustrates the user. Keep your storefront clean.

Hi there,

i dont know from where to start,

3 years ago i had meltdown/burnout that led me to withdraw myself from work and college and all my friends, and because of that i lost all my friends

and for the last 2 years i start using ChatGPT to help me write or reply to emails or people in general ( including here in Reddit ) because i thought, i will hurt someone because of how straightforward i am so my prompt with GPT is “please re write this without being rude or mean “because often i sound like that but i dont mean it,

i reach to a point the only person who i talked to after my partner is my therapist but i felt bad because she wasnt good ( for helping me ) but i felt she was using me because for 3 months she was taking more than half of the session talking about herself but i didnt want to admit that for a while because “ it is someone who i can talk to “

after while i stopped seeing her :)

now i feel like i lost the skill of talking to people or making small talk “ i dont have it in me to even lie white lies to make someone happy”

i miss talking to people seeing people but now i get anxious of doing it, i had a neighbour who said lets meet and have a coffee together and i hid in the house and didnt go out for her not to see me and mention it again ( but from inside i really want to , but i feel awkward around people )

maybe part of it because i had 26y of complex past and trauma so what ever someone try to open a subject with me i feel like i am gonna get a pity from them, ok lets not talk about past my present now living with so many chronic health issues and chasing doctors and appointments i dont have anything exciting to say!

\- oh lets to go have a coffee, sorry i dont know if i can walk today or for the next week/month!

\- oh lets go to a restaurants oh sorry i dont know if i can’t eat my diet is complex now!

\- oh lets go to there or there my answer always i cant or i dont know if i can! 

i feel whatever i am saying is excuses not to see the person :(

at the same time i dont know if there is someone will understand me that i am complex but i cant do anything about it, sometime i cant talk to people in general because i shut down when i am overwhelmed!

but i wanna have friends, i miss having a friend to talk to send funny videos to each other , not overthink every words because they know english is not my first language and i came from different culture if i said something that upset them they tell me they dont just cut me off without checking if maybe i didnt mean it to sound like this….

sometimes i wish if there is custom made friends, i will mix compassion, easy going, understandable, doesnt get upset if i disappear for a week but when i come back we continue from where we left and the most important thing we jump to the phase best friends after short period of time i dont need to build a relationship for years..

i dont know if i am making any sense, is this something autistic people struggle with or this is a ( me problem )? any thoughts ? btw i am seeing a new therapist so i know i need to work on so many things lol",1,1768158091.0,autism,10,0.67,False

I spent a week in Tulum and just got back yesterday and while it was expensive I had a great time.

Day 1: We stayed in an Airbnb near hotel zone/parc jaguar, at first area seemed nice. Close to beach, restaurants. We found a driver and stuck with him throughout the week so he drove us to Ilios for dinner. Food was MEH, nothing special at all but drinks was good and vibe? Super fun! Dancing on tables, breaking plates, met alot of friendly fun staff and people. Next day we realized they charged us for 2 extra drinks. My friend was livid but honestly it was a good lesson for first day—check you receipts carefully! I still enjoyed my time there. After we snuck into a show at Arena. Also fun. 

Day 2: Next day chill vibe: free beach, mateos for dinner (great spot! Cheap happy hour, friendly people). Also checked out hot heads, bocconeria pizzeria. Aka we kept the day cheap to offset Ilios. 

Day 3: Checking out La Veleta, this area has a ton of good coffee shops! Cute stores. Almost wish we’d stayed here or Tulum Centro (for next time cause we will be back!). Went back home and came back to Centro “La guardida” very cute chill spot for drinks. Club next door for a bit was fun too. Some of us had Zamna that night rest of us went home. 

Day 4: Atik Cenote. Massive line up even if you did have tickets! Very unorganized but once you got in I thought it was great! Lots of diff art installations and not as crowded inside. “Don Cafeto” for dinner, driver recommended —cheap and so good! Night time was Zamna. I’m not a “raver” but I enjoyed Keinemusik so it was cool to see. I didn’t get any of the aggressive pat downs I’m seeing on here, we did go with locals we met so maybe them speaking Spanish helped? AMAZING time. Cashless bar was stupid tho. Also never partying till 830 am again lol.

Day 5: recovery (❤️‍🩹) back to La Veleta for dinner “Asian Bodega” great spot! Guys you don’t need to eat in hotel zone every night! We learned night one it was fun but didn’t need to be repeated. So many good options around. 

Day 6: Azulik Uh May. Wow this was cool! We went to the one 30 minutes out and this time our driver was busy so we used the app “indrive” worked well! He didn’t over charge at all. The installations were amazing. We did run into some very loud tourists we had to hush but they were respectful after and worker gave us thumbs up 😅 spent hours here and had lunch at the restaurant. Didn’t eat much cause we were trying to save but the food was GREAT! Also don’t get the bad review for this lol (1000 mxn included 600 for the food I only went 200 over) Home time and last minute decided to check out another DJ event “shimza” on Zamna on the beach. Venue was small but DJ was great.

Day 7: Hotel Panamera. Wowowowow! I’ve been to beach clubs everywhere and this one was so pretty, such friendly staff, so worth the cost!! 1700 mxn for day bed, 3 drinks, breakfast and lunch here. That’s a STEAL? Would comeback here next year Altho they will def be raising prices. Also way less showy than beach clubs in Europe with similar aesthetics. I did have friends go to Taboo and Mia beach clubs and pay way more but I did my research before hand. Dinner in Tulum Centro “negro huitlacoxe” recommended by the waiter at Asian bodega—yummy! Fair price. 

Overall I think you guys get the point. Lots of fair prices to be found if you look for it. We did some tourist trap things but I enjoyed them all: Ilios, Azulik, Atik, beach clubs. My friends did extra Zamna shows while I opted out and we all had an amazing experience. This page scared crap out of me so hope this helps.

Since then, I’ve been intentionally doing it this way for about a week — first shot without the puck screen, second shot with it — and it’s been surprisingly consistent. Coffee tastes great too.

1qa7nhy,https://www.reddit.com/r/CorporateComms/comments/1qa7nhy/most_crisis_comms_strategies_are_useless_heres_my/,Most Crisis Comms Strategies are useless. Here’s my approach.,"I think most communication folk are pretty sceptical of the ""S-word"" for good reason.

Usually, it implies a 50-page binder that no one in their right mind would read (especially in a crisis). It normally just gathers dust on a digital shelf. 

But that’s not a reason not to get ready. There is nothing worse than trying to respond to a crisis and realising the basics haven’t been done right.

So, here’s my go at explaining why it’s important to prepare and how to do it. 

**Why you actually need to prepare**

* **You’ll break.** When the pressure is on, your IQ drops. You need a strategy to do some thinking for you.
* **A strategy is a time-saver.** It buys you breathing room when things are going down hill fast.
* **Accountability.** When the dust settles, you don't want to be in the hot seat explaining why you didn't have a plan.

**So, how to do it? Here’s what I do:** 

**Get your aim straight**. Forget the ""spin"" or ""control the narrative."" You can't. Your goal is to establish credibility. Your job is to be the fastest source of honest accurate info. If you aren't the source of truth, the rumour mill takes over and you lose.

**Write down a simple checklist.** Don't rely on your memory. In the first hour, you need a pilot's checklist. Who activates the team? Who has the passwords? Who signs off the statement? Write it down now so you don't have to think about it later.

**Meet the expectations of your customers.** Stop thinking about what you want to say, and start thinking about what they need to hear. If you don't understand their fear or frustration, your statement will land flat. A crisis in my view is a broken promise. 

**Make relationships with the right people.** Chat to them about what could happen. Have the arguments now, over a coffee, not at 2 AM when the servers are melting down. Try to get together a group every month to talk things through. 

Anything I've missed?

Can therapy help, or should I (22M) leave?","**Hi everyone. I’m looking for honest advice on whether this relationship is worth continuing or if I’m stuck in a harmful cycle.**



I’m 22 years old, my girlfriend is 21. We’ve been together for less than a year.



We met online. At first, everything felt normal and healthy: long conversations, video calls, jokes, plans to meet. She lived outside the city with her father at that time, even though she studied in the city and technically had an apartment there (which her father rented for her).



Early on, she warned me that she is very emotional and has been officially diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. She also mentioned a long depressive period, though I don’t remember if she explained how serious it was at the very beginning.



Before we even met in person, I won her a very large teddy bear (about 150 cm tall) from a dating arcade machine. After that, she started sending video messages, and we planned our first meeting.





# First meeting & family background





Our first date was a picnic in the forest near her home. I accidentally met her father (not planned). He was very strict at first, asking questions like whether he could reach me by phone, whether I knew how to use maps, etc. After that, my girlfriend came out, and we went to the forest together.



We had a good time, talked about serious topics. She briefly mentioned a difficult childhood and toxic past relationships, but since it was the first date, I didn’t have the full picture.



Afterward, her father invited us for coffee. He asked basic questions about who I am and how we spent time together. At the end, he asked if I smoke. I said no. He stood up and seriously told his daughter, “Take an example from him.”



Only then did I realize her father is very wealthy: a large house, tennis court by the river, indoor pool, sauna, frequent luxury trips. I come from a very ordinary family, so this contrast was surprising.



Later, her father offered to drive me to the bus stop. During that drive, he asked who I was and what my intentions were. I directly asked why his daughter lived with him despite having an apartment, and how he would feel if I had serious intentions.



That’s when I learned she had struggled with alcoholism for about two years. When it became uncontrollable, he took her to live with him. He also said she was very unstable at that time. Despite this, he said he approved of me and would support the relationship.



At that point, none of this scared me enough to walk away.





# Moving in together & escalation





For about a month, I visited her every weekend. Eventually, she found a foreign client and started selling her paintings online. Shortly after that, we moved in together spontaneously.



This is when everything escalated.



Her alcoholism returned. Over six months of living together, she barely worked. Financial responsibility was mostly on me. She started having extreme jealousy episodes. If I even opened someone’s Instagram profile, it was considered cheating. She would scream at me for hours (sometimes 5+ hours). She checked my browser history, messages, literally everything.



During arguments, she became physically aggressive:



* tried to hit me with objects (kettle, frying pan)
* threw my belongings out the window
* cut herself
* bit me so hard it left a permanent scar on my arm





The list is honestly longer.





# The breaking point





The breaking point came when I asked her to meet her ex briefly to retrieve her belongings. The meeting was supposed to last 20 minutes at a café near our home.



She came back over two hours later, drunk, and started screaming that if I “allowed” her to meet him, it meant I didn’t love her. She attacked me physically. I finally lost control and slapped her once. I deeply regret this — it has never happened before or after in my life.



She then called her ex and asked him to come “kick me out.” He walked for three hours at night to come to our place. I called the police because she had fully switched sides and I felt unsafe.



In the end, no one was kicked out. We all stayed in the apartment. Somehow, alcohol appeared again. I drank a few glasses of whiskey and fell asleep.



I woke up to her screaming and hitting me again. I started packing my things. She hit me in the face with a phone, leaving a black eye for two weeks.



While I was packing, her ex pulled a knife from behind his back and said, “Sorry, I overreacted.” I calmly took my things and left for my parents’ home.





# Reconciliation attempt





I thought it was over. I was devastated but knew this was beyond normal.



After some time, she sent me hundreds of messages apologizing. She kicked her ex out of her life. She promised to stop drinking — and she actually did. Her father paid for medical treatment to help her quit alcohol.



I spoke with her father. He said he wasn’t surprised and that her behavior reminded him of his relationship with her mother. He admitted he hoped love would “fix everything.”



I decided to give her another chance.



For about two months, we lived separately but occasionally stayed together. There were no major scandals. She blocked her exes and stayed sober.





# My burnout & current situation





Eventually, I burned out completely — mentally and emotionally. I decided to move to another city/country for work. We had discussed this for months, but she never wanted to move.



I moved anyway, because I had debts, mental exhaustion, housing issues, and needed better income. She stayed behind with:



* stable housing
* financial support from parents
* a good job





After I left, she accused me of abandoning her and not loving her. She had emotional breakdowns for weeks. I finally broke up with her.



She kept contacting me for a month through every possible channel and number. Eventually, we talked again. She seemed calmer. I don’t have strong expectations anymore.



Her father and I both admitted we don’t really believe things will change — but we’re “waiting to see.”





# My main concern





Throughout this relationship, I cut off all female friends to avoid conflicts. Now I’m worried about my future career: female colleagues, students (I plan to teach languages), professional communication.



Her jealousy hasn’t disappeared — it’s just quieter for now.



**My questions:**



* Can therapy realistically help someone like this?
* Is this relationship salvageable, or am I just delaying the inevitable?
* How do I protect my future without becoming emotionally abusive or controlling myself?





Thank you to everyone who read this. I truly need outside perspective.

**How to Properly Care for Your Pet Kaiser (VERY IMPORTANT GUIDE)**

**step one:** make sure your pet kaiser has plenty of space to run, sprint, slide, and aggressively kick things. this space MUST be outside unless you enjoy broken windows, dents in the walls, and neighbors filing noise complaints

**step two:** ensure your pet kaiser has regular access to magic shows. he fucking LOVES magicians for reasons unknown to science. doesn’t matter if the magician is bad (they usually are), he’ll still stare like it’s life-changing

**step three:** feed your kaiser. feed him AGAIN. feed him MORE. he eats WAY more than you would ever reasonably expect and will act personally betrayed if you run out of snacks

**step four:** invest in LOTS of exercise equipment. treadmills, weights, resistance bands, cones, things that look dangerous for no reason. this is to burn off calories AND rage

**step five:** keep an emergency supply of blue hair dye at all times. it MUST be the correct blue. anything else will result in offense, denial, and possibly violence

**step six:** ⚠️ EXTREMELY IMPORTANT ⚠️  
make sure his hair is cut in a way that allows for **1–2 decent-length rat tails**. these are multifunctional: aesthetic purposes, emotional support, and dragging him away from situations. don’t worry if it hurts. he’s fine. probably

**step seven:** DO. NOT. allow him around Isagi. under ANY circumstances. he WILL attempt murder. this is not a joke, this is a warning

**step eight:** prepare yourself for constant mood swings. happy → angry → smug → empty → feral → calm. this can happen within five minutes

**step nine:** do NOT be overly nice to him. he will immediately assume this is a psychological trap and respond with suspicion and insults

**step ten:** provide him with a room that has plenty of hiding spots. small spaces preferred. corners, closets, under furniture. it makes him feel safe and less like biting

**step eleven:** FOLLOW ALL OF THESE STEPS. if you fail even ONE, your kaiser will be unhappy, and you will know because he will make it everyone’s problem

**step twelve:** expect him to stare directly at you for long periods of time without blinking. this is normal. do not acknowledge it

**step thirteen:** never question his confidence. even if he’s objectively wrong. especially if he’s objectively wrong

**step fourteen:** keep fragile egos away from him. he will crush them accidentally (or on purpose)

**step fifteen:** he may randomly demand validation. give it to him carefully. too much = suspicious. too little = offensive

**step sixteen:** do not attempt to discipline him like a normal pet. this will not work. redirect him with competition or a shiny object (preferably a ball he can kick violently)

**step seventeen:** understand that he WILL say something insane at least once a day. just nod. arguing makes it worse

**step eighteen:** never, under any circumstances, let him lose too badly. his pride is a live explosive

**step nineteen:** if he sulks in silence, do NOT interrupt. this is a sacred brooding ritual

**step twenty:** remember: your pet kaiser is not evil. he is simply dramatic, aggressive, emotionally complicated, and very unstable

**WARNING SIGNS YOUR PET KAISER IS ABOUT TO SNAP**  
*(please read carefully for your own safety)*

**warning sign one:** he goes unusually quiet. not calm quiet. *predatory* quiet. this is the most dangerous state

**warning sign two:** excessive hair touching. if he’s tugging, twisting, or aggressively re-flipping his hair, abort mission immediately

**warning sign three:** he starts smiling without any joy behind it. if the smile looks practiced instead of smug, you are already in danger

**warning sign four:** sudden fixation on ONE person in the room. bonus points if that person is Isagi (evacuate immediately)

**warning sign five:** he cracks his neck, knuckles, or ankles “just because.” he is lying. there is always a reason

**warning sign six:** he begins monologuing. if he’s talking to himself? it’s too late. that is the final stage

**warning sign seven:** unusually polite behavior. if he says “please” or “thank you,” something is deeply wrong

**warning sign eight:** pacing. back and forth. back and forth. like a large blue predator deciding where to strike

**warning sign nine:** kicking objects that did not provoke him. walls, cones, trash cans, the concept of fate

**warning sign ten:** staring directly at Isagi’s general direction even if Isagi is not present

**warning sign eleven:** muttering insults under his breath in multiple languages (you don’t need to understand them to know they’re lethal)

**warning sign twelve:** he suddenly wants to “prove a point.” do not ask what point. do not let him prove it

**warning sign thirteen:** intense eye contact followed by a scoff. that scoff has killed morale before

**warning sign fourteen:** he asks for a ball. this is not a request. this is preparation

**warning sign fifteen:** dramatic sighing. if it sounds like the weight of the world is on his shoulders, he is about to put that weight on someone else

**warning sign sixteen:** he starts calling himself “perfect” more than usual. this means reality has personally offended him

**warning sign seventeen:** someone praises Isagi within a five-mile radius

**warning sign eighteen:** he laughs once. just once. quietly. this is an omen

**warning sign nineteen:** he stops insulting people. this means he has moved past words

**warning sign twenty:** you feel the sudden urge to leave the area. trust this instinct. it has evolved for a reason

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**  
If you observe **three or more warning signs at once**, immediately:

* remove all sharp objects
* remove Isagi
* distract kaiser with intense competition or a magic trick
* and accept that some damage is inevitable

**DAILY SCHEDULE OF A PET KAISER OWNER**  
*(for those who value structure, chaos, and survival)*

**6:00 AM** – wake up to the sound of aggressive stretching. kaiser has already been awake for an hour, judging you

**6:05 AM** – first feeding. do not make eye contact while he eats. he is territorial in the mornings

**6:20 AM** – light exercise. “light” meaning sprints, explosive kicks, and one unnecessarily intense drill that makes you question reality

**7:00 AM** – shower time (his). you will be blamed if the water temperature is wrong even once

**7:30 AM** – hair inspection. touch-up blue dye if needed.

**8:00 AM** – second feeding. he insists the first one “didn’t count”

**8:30 AM** – enrichment time. magic videos, highlights of himself, or footage of Isagi losing (preferred)

**9:30 AM** – free roaming time. keep him outdoors. apologize to neighbors in advance

**11:00 AM** – mood swing window. he is either smug, bored, angry, or all three. choose your words carefully

**12:00 PM** – lunch. you are eating too, but that is irrelevant to him

**12:30 PM** – competitive activity. race him. lose gracefully. do NOT win unless you want to deal with consequences

**2:00 PM** – brooding hour. do not interrupt. this is vital for emotional balance (his, not yours)

**3:00 PM** – strength training. he adds more weight without telling you

**4:00 PM** – nap attempt. he will not sleep. he will stare at the ceiling and think violent thoughts

**5:00 PM** – third feeding. yes, third. yes, he’s still hungry

**6:00 PM** – social exposure (controlled). no Isagi. no compliments. minimal human interaction

**7:00 PM** – evening drills. intensity increases for no clear reason

**8:00 PM** – grooming. check rat tails. ensure optimal dragging length

**8:30 PM** – quiet time. he watches something while insulting it the entire time

**9:30 PM** – sudden burst of energy. prepare for running, yelling, or dramatic declarations

**10:30 PM** – final feeding. he claims this helps muscle recovery

**11:00 PM** – room inspection. confirm hiding spots are intact and corners are acceptable

**11:30 PM** – lights out. he does not sleep immediately. neither do you

**12:00 AM** – hear a single laugh from his room. pretend you didn’t

**OWNER REMINDER:**  
This schedule is flexible. Kaiser is not.  
Rest when you can. Lock doors when necessary.  
Tomorrow will be the same.

**A SHORT BUT NECESSARY GUIDE ON DISCIPLINING YOUR PET KAISER**  
*(because sometimes he is A Menace)*

**IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER:**  
you cannot discipline a pet kaiser like a normal pet. this will not work. he will simply take it as a challenge, an insult, or psychological warfare. discipline must be **firm, targeted, and mildly inconvenient**.

**method one: the muzzle (use sparingly)**  
if your kaiser is biting too much, snapping at people, or threatening murder with his teeth, a muzzle may be applied.

* expect intense glaring
* expect muffled insults
* do NOT expect an apology remove once biting behavior decreases (or once you feel safe again)

**method two: magic show deprivation**  
this is one of the most effective punishments.

* no magicians
* no card tricks
* no “is this your card?” nonsense he will act like you’ve committed an unforgivable crime. that means it’s working.

**method three: ball confiscation**  
take away the ball.  
yes, he will stare at where it used to be.  
yes, this feels cruel.  
no, you should not give it back until he stops being a menace to society.

**method four: enforced cooldown time**  
place him in his room.  
turn the lights low.  
no stimulation. no audience.  
this is not solitary confinement, this is *forced brooding containment*.

**method five: verbal correction (VERY SPECIFIC)**  
do not yell.  
do not lecture.  
look him dead in the eye and say something short like:

* “no.”
* “unacceptable.”
* “try again.” the disappointment hurts more than anger ever could.

**method six: loss of privileges**  
temporary removal of privileges may include:

* no outdoor free roaming
* reduced exercise equipment access
* no being told he’s perfect (this one stings)

**method seven: controlled competition loss**  
if he’s acting out due to ego inflation, let him lose.  
IMPORTANT:

* it must be a CLOSE loss
* it must feel FAIR
* do NOT mock him afterward unless you enjoy danger

**method eight: ignore the dramatics**  
sometimes he misbehaves for attention.  
if he’s sulking loudly, sighing theatrically, or muttering insults at the air—  
ignore him.  
nothing terrifies him more than irrelevance.

**method nine: positive reinforcement (use carefully)**  
when he behaves:

* brief praise
* minimal enthusiasm
* no overdoing it too much praise will reset the problem entirely.

**FINAL WARNING:**  
never discipline your pet kaiser by:

* embarrassing him publicly
* comparing him to Isagi
* touching his hair without permission

these are not corrections. these are declarations of war.

discipline is about balance.  
firm, fair, and just inconvenient enough to remind him that actions have consequences.  
he will never admit it worked.  
but it did.

**FOODS YOU CAN AND CANNOT FEED YOUR PET KAISER**  
*(for his health, safety, and everyone’s continued survival)*

# ✅ FOODS YOU CAN FEED YOUR PET KAISER

* **lean meats** (chicken, beef, turkey) he needs protein. a lot of it. if there is no protein, he will complain
* **pasta, rice, bread** carbs = energy = fewer crimes (sometimes)
* **eggs** (any style) acceptable at any time of day. will eat six and ask where the rest are
* **protein bars & shakes** he pretends they’re “fine” but actually likes them
* **fruit** (especially apples, bananas, berries) will eat them begrudgingly if you cut them nicely
* **vegetables** (only if cooked or disguised) raw vegetables are suspicious and possibly insulting
* **cheese** do not give too much or he will eat it all and deny responsibility
* **energy snacks** (granola, trail mix, nuts) ideal for post-training hunger spirals
* **chocolate-flavored protein items** IMPORTANT: protein chocolate is acceptable. normal chocolate is a different conversation (see below)
* **anything labeled “high-calorie”** his favorite words after “perfect”

# ❌ FOODS YOU CANNOT FEED YOUR PET KAISER

* **junk food in large quantities** small amounts are fine. too much and he becomes unbearable
* **excessive sugar** he is already dramatic enough
* **spicy food** he will eat it out of spite and then be angry at YOU about it
* **gas station mystery food** do you want to deal with that aftermath? no? good
* **anything you clearly enjoy too much** he will assume it’s inferior and refuse it on principle
* **unlabeled supplements** if you don’t know what it is, neither does he, and that’s dangerous
* **alcohol** this is non-negotiable. absolutely not
* **raw vegetables presented without effort** disrespectful. try harder
* **food shaped like other food** (ex: “healthy” nuggets) he feels lied to
* **anything Isagi recommends** even if it’s objectively perfect nutrition. especially then

# ⚠️ FOODS TO FEED WITH CAUTION

* **sweets** fine as rewards. never as a regular thing
* **fast food** acceptable post-training. unacceptable as a lifestyle
* **caffeine** one coffee maximum. two is a mistake
* **new foods** introduce slowly unless you want commentary

# FINAL NOTE

your pet kaiser requires:

* high calories
* high protein
* high standards

if he refuses food, it’s not because he isn’t hungry.  
it’s because the food has personally offended him.

**ADDITIONAL IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR PET KAISER OWNERS**  
*(things no one tells you until it’s too late)*

# GENERAL BEHAVIOR NOTES

* your pet kaiser is **highly intelligent** and fully aware of this fact
* he does not respond to commands, only **suggestions framed as challenges**
* sarcasm is his primary love language (even when he says he doesn’t care)

# COMMUNICATION TIPS

* short sentences work best
* long explanations will be ignored halfway through
* eye contact = dominance challenge (use carefully)
* silence is sometimes the correct response

# SOCIALIZATION WARNINGS

* introduce new people slowly
* if he likes someone, he will insult them slightly less
* if he hates someone, you will know immediately
* **Isagi is not a “new person,” he is a known hazard**

# ENVIRONMENTAL REQUIREMENTS

* loud environments overstimulate him
* too quiet environments make him spiral
* balance is key, and you will never achieve it perfectly
* mirrors are fine. too many mirrors are not

# HEALTH & SAFETY

* minor injuries will be ignored by him
* serious injuries will also be ignored until forced
* stretching is mandatory even if he claims he “doesn’t need it”
* hydration is important (he forgets on purpose)

# SLEEP INFORMATION

* he does not sleep normally
* nightmares may occur; do not wake him suddenly
* if he’s up at 3am training, mind your business

# EMOTIONAL MAINTENANCE

* validation must be rationed
* reassurance must be subtle
* open concern will be deflected with insults
* anger is easier for him than vulnerability

# COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS

* “he’ll calm down with age” → false
* “he didn’t mean it” → he did
* “he’s just joking” → unclear
* “this is manageable” → debatable

# EMERGENCY PROTOCOL

if your pet kaiser is:

* yelling
* pacing
* smiling wrong
* or staring into nothing

remove stimuli, secure the area, and wait it out.  
do NOT escalate.  
do NOT bring up Isagi.

# FINAL REMINDER

owning a pet kaiser is a **full-time commitment**.  
he is difficult, dramatic, exhausting, and occasionally unbearable.

but he is also loyal in his own strange way,  
will protect what he considers “his,”  
and will never admit that he cares.

if he stays near you voluntarily,  
congratulations.  
you’re doing something right.",3,1768157272.0,BlueLock,9,0.67,False

Thanks everyone in advance for the tips and help. I’ll keep the story short. 

I (28m)met a girl two months ago at work (I know bad choice) it’s a large campus and met her through mutual coworkers even though I had never seen her and most likely can go the rest of the time I work here without seeing her(I’m leaving in July)

We started with texting on company phones and switched to personal phones after we agreed to enter the talking stage to get to know each other then morning coffee meeting at our car and then lunch in our cars. Face time all day after work and talking on the phone during. Thursday she told me it wasn’t going anywhere and it won’t ever go anywhere. I said thanks for being honest and I won’t reach out again and I blocked her number just so I can guarantee I don’t bother her. 

I’m here thinking of why I miss her if we barely knew each other and we never did anything romantic. The only thing i can think of is I liked the attention but also because of the fantasy I put in my head about her. All the dates we would go on and how life would be and felt great.

We had nothing in common, like 0% things in common not even the type of food we liked. So I’m not sure why I’m still obsessing over her and waiting for her to reach out some way. She was the first girl I opened up to again after my two year relationship that ended 4 months ago so I hate that I have to open up to someone again down the road. ",1,1768157022.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

I shouldn't have spent the night there, but New York City deceives you when the sun goes down. The lights, the constant noise, the false sense that you're never completely alone. I thought that if I found a place sheltered from the wind, I could hold out until dawn without any problems.

I wasn't a homeless person. I kept telling myself that as I walked with my backpack on my back. I had an education, I had worked, I even had a bus ticket for the next morning. Sleeping on the street was a one-off decision, a bad night in a life that was still salvageable. At least that's what I believed then.

I chose the side entrance of a closed subway station, one of those entrances shut down for construction that never progresses. The glass was covered with dust and old posters, and the stairwell descended a few meters before being blocked by a gate. The wind didn't blow as hard there.

I found several dry cardboard boxes leaning against the wall, stacked in layers. They weren't scattered randomly. Someone had carefully arranged them to form a more or less uniform surface. I hesitated for a few seconds, but the cold was numbing my fingers, and pride always loses when the body begins to fail.

I spread my sleeping bag on top, took off my boots and put them inside my backpack so they wouldn't harden, and got in without undressing. The ground still transmitted the cold accumulated throughout the day, which slowly rose up my back and settled in my bones. I turned off my cell phone to save battery and stared at the dull reflection of my face in the dirty glass.

New York City was still alive above. Cars, a distant shout, the rattling of the last subway underground. It reassured me to think that, even though no one could see me, I was surrounded by people.

I fell into a half-sleep, that uncomfortable state where the body rests but the mind remains alert. That's when I heard footsteps. I don't know if that happened before or after I closed my eyes.

They weren't normal footsteps. They had no rhythm. They sounded shuffling, slow, with an irregularity that didn't fit with someone simply walking. I sat up in my sleeping bag and listened. The footsteps stopped just as they reached the subway entrance.

I held my breath. I shouldn't have slept outdoors. Now I regretted not going to a hostel. And all to save a few coins.

Several seconds passed. Then, a different sound: a long, deep exhalation, too close. I opened the sleeping bag a little and poked my head out.

There was a man standing in front of me.

I couldn't tell his age. He could have been thirty or sixty. He was very thin, sickly thin, with clothes hanging off him as if they had been put on a body that no longer existed. He was wearing a torn jacket and had his hands in his pockets. His skin was dull, grayish, and his lips were bruised.

He stared at me.

“It's cold here,” he said.

His voice was hoarse, but not weak. There was something strange about it, a dry echo that didn't seem to come only from his throat.

“My name is Daniel. I'm just spending the night,” I replied. “I'm leaving in the morning.”

I don't know why I felt the need to justify myself.

The man slowly bowed his head.

“I've spent nights here too,” he said. “Many.”

He took a step toward me. I noticed a sour, old smell, a mixture of dampness and something else that was harder to identify.

“I don't want any trouble,” I added, beginning to feel fear rising in my stomach.

He smiled. It wasn't a friendly smile. It was a grimace that revealed uneven, badly worn teeth.

“Nobody wants trouble,” he replied. “Nobody wants to stay here.”

He bent down with difficulty and rested one hand on the ground, right on top of the cardboard boxes. His hand went through one of the layers and touched the cement directly.

“This is where I slept,” he continued. “Right here.”

I reached into my backpack without taking my eyes off him and pulled out a small flask.

“Here,” I said. “For the cold.”

The man looked down at the metal, surprised. For a moment I thought he would accept it, but he slowly shook his head.

“No,” he replied. “I quit drinking many years ago.”

I put the flask away, uncomfortable.

“Alcohol ruined my life,” he added. “More than the cold ever could.”

I didn't know how to respond. I nodded silently. He looked at me again, and for the first time, I saw no threat in his face, only something resembling a very old weariness.

“Here, this will help you get through the nights outdoors.”

He gave me a small picture of the Virgin Mary. It was wrinkled and faded. I put it in my coat pocket.

The wind stopped suddenly, as if someone had closed an invisible door. My breath was no longer a thick cloud, and I felt the coat begin to warm up again.

“What do you want?” I asked, my voice trembling.

He looked up and met my eyes.

“I don't want anything,” he said. “They've already taken everything from me.”

He stood up awkwardly and took another step toward me. Then I saw it clearly: his feet weren't quite touching the ground. They were floating a few inches above it, just enough to make sense of the dragging sound from before.

I tried to get up, but my body wouldn't respond. The cold had numbed my legs, and fear had completely paralyzed me.

“I fell asleep,” he continued. “I thought I could hold out until dawn. Just like you.”

His face was getting closer and closer. I felt pressure on my chest, an invisible weight that prevented me from breathing normally.

“I didn't feel the car,” he whispered. “Only the impact. Then this cold. Always this cold.”

I screamed. Or tried to. No sound came out.

The man reached out a hand toward me and placed it on my chest. I didn't feel his skin, but the cold became unbearable, piercing me like an electric shock.

“Don't worry,” he said. “There's always a moment when they stop feeling it.”

He slowly withdrew his hand. The cold remained, but it no longer pierced my chest with the same violence. He looked at me for a few more seconds, as if he wanted to make sure of something.

“Don't stay,” he said. “If you stay, it won't be me you'll find.”

Then he took a step back.

Then another.

His figure began to lose definition, as if the light coming in from the street couldn't quite reach him. The shuffling sound could be heard again, soft, growing fainter and fainter, until it disappeared completely into the darkness of the stairwell.

Silence returned.

I don't remember when I got back into the sleeping bag. Exhaustion fell upon me suddenly, heavily, and I closed my eyes without thinking. The cold was still there, but it was no longer the only thing I felt. I slept poorly, in fits and starts, with confused dreams and a constant feeling of being about to wake up.

It was a noise that woke me from my sleep.

It wasn't a knock. It was a distant murmur, the beginning of the day filtering in from the street. The first traffic. A blind being raised. Dawn.

I sat up awkwardly. My body ached, stiff from the cold and poor posture. I gathered up my sleeping bag and backpack as best I could and started up the stairs to the subway entrance, intending to get out as soon as possible.

When I was almost at the top, I felt a sharp push in the back. “Fuck,” I muttered, before losing my balance. It wasn't a stumble. It was a clear, deliberate blow.

I lost my balance and fell forward, hitting the edge of the sidewalk. Pain shot through my ankle as I landed badly. I cried out and reached for my leg, feeling it begin to swell.

I tried to get up, but before I could, something grabbed my foot. I didn't feel hands. I didn't feel fingers. I felt a shapeless force pulling me back with a precision that was anything but human. There was something about the way it grabbed me that wasn't a hand, but it wasn't anything else I could name either.

It dragged me across the ground, straight toward the road. The wheels of a car passed just inches from my head.

I kicked as hard as I could, scratching the asphalt with my hands, while that pressure pulled at my ankle with blind, insistent determination.

Then I saw it. A car was coming down the street, still slow, but getting closer. Its headlights blinded me for a moment, and I understood, with icy clarity, that it wasn't trying to hold me back: it wanted to drag me a little further. Just enough.

The force pulled again, guiding me toward the center of the road, to the exact spot where the wheels couldn't avoid me. I heard the engine getting closer. The asphalt vibrated beneath my body.

I screamed, but the sound was lost amid the noise of traffic awakening the city. For a second, I was absolutely certain it wasn't going to let go of me. Without meaning to, I felt the pocket where the little stamp was.

And then, suddenly, the pressure disappeared.

I lay on the road, my heart racing and my ankle burning, just as the car slammed on the brakes a few inches from my body. For a few seconds, all I could hear was my own breathing.

Then, a different noise. A broom dragging across the ground.

“Hey,” said a voice. ""Calm down. 

Don't move. My name is Mike.

I turned my head with difficulty. A man in a reflective vest was approaching from the sidewalk, looking at me with concern.

“I thought you were going to kill yourself,” he added. “You were so close.”

I tried to sit up, but my body felt heavy.

“What happened?” I asked.

The street sweeper leaned on his broom and looked at me with a mixture of reproach and relief.

“You're lucky,” he replied. “A car almost hit you. You rolled out of there,” he pointed to the subway entrance, “as if someone had pushed you.”

I put my hand on my chest. Under my clothes, my skin was cold and sore.

“There was no one there,” I murmured.

The street sweeper was silent for a few seconds.

“That's what they always say,” he replied at last. “But that's not a good place to sleep. It never has been.”

He stared at the subway entrance and added:

""Not long ago, a car ran over a man who was sleeping in that gap. His name was Walter. He wasn't bothering anyone. He always left his cardboard boxes neatly stacked and picked everything up in the morning before he left.

He paused briefly.

“Some of us brought him coffee when it was cold. He was a good guy.”

“People said he was drunk,” the street sweeper continued. “That's why he didn't see the car coming.”

I shook my head slowly.

“He didn't drink,” I said. “He told me last night.”

Mike stopped sweeping.

He looked at me without surprise, without disbelief. He just held my gaze for a few seconds.

“Then you saw something,” he said.

I didn't answer.

“Listen,” he added. “Never use alcohol to warm yourself up. It deceives you. It puts you to sleep. And then what happens happens.”

He pointed his chin toward the corner.

""Go to Joe's Diner. It's right there. Tell him Mike sent you. Have some coffee and pancakes. It's on me.

“That's not necessary,” I began to say.

He smiled.

“And get a bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich,” he added. “A real one.”

I was speechless.

“That takes care of breakfast and lunch for you today,” he said, picking up the broom again. If you really want to thank me...

He looked up one last time.

“Sleep in a hostel tonight.”

He went back to sweeping, ending the conversation.

I got up slowly and walked away without looking back. As I passed the subway entrance, I saw the cardboard boxes back in their place, clean, lined up, waiting for someone else to believe that it was just cold.

I remembered the little picture. I looked at it closely.

It was of the Virgin of Covadonga.

If what I had seen was Walter's ghost, how was it possible that I now had it in my hands?

What was that force that wanted to throw me under the wheels of a car?

I'm sure Walter tried to protect me from it.",8,1768156507.0,nosleep,0,0.9,False
1qa725y,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1qa725y/was_the_behavior_of_this_colleague_and_her/,Was the behavior of this colleague and her husband normal?,"
I am a 46-year-old man. For two years, I worked with a female colleague who was 50, four years older than me. We are both married and have two children of the same age. We got along very well. We would chat and go to lunch together, sometimes with other colleagues. She would also bring me homemade dishes because she knew I enjoyed good food. Sometimes she would give me cakes and snacks; I felt she was almost like a big sister. Occasionally, she acted childishly around me—for instance, one day she ran toward me to talk to me like a child, and she would tease me during our discussions. Every time a workplace meal was organized for a celebration, she insisted I participate, even though I don’t typically enjoy work social events. Afterward, she would become colder and more distant. Sometimes she would ask me to go out at lunchtime with her to run some errands. She often suggested outings with the children, but I systematically refused because I had no desire to see a colleague outside of work.

Then I had problems with management—a kind of harassment that was very difficult for me. For several months, I didn’t speak to anyone at work, focusing only on my tasks and trying to get through that tough period. This colleague tried to find out why I was isolating myself, and I simply replied, ""I have a lot of work,"" without further explanation. One day, I ran into her by chance on the metro, and she came over to me, suggesting we travel together. She behaved in a way I would describe as flirting (she got very close to me, pressed her chest against my arm, and leaned in very close to speak to me). One day, she even came into my office to look at something on my screen and stood very close against me. I didn't know how to react because she is older, and I was quite surprised.

I eventually found another job in a different office, and my departure was announced. This colleague then came to see me, congratulated me, asked when my last day was, and said she was inviting me to lunch that day. On the day, she took me out and asked if she had done something wrong and why I wasn't speaking to her anymore. I explained that I had been suffering from harassment and had been looking for another job, which I had found.

She was relieved that my distant attitude wasn't because of her. She then continued to make flirting gestures, such as touching my hand. I then told her that since I was leaving for another office, we could stay in touch and see each other for family outings with the children and spouses (this might have been a mistake on my part!). Delighted, she organized several outings during the summer, and we saw each other regularly—always with our respective spouses at my request, as I didn't want us to meet without her husband and my wife. I thought our relationship was great. Except that sometimes, when I went out with my children and didn't tell her, she would point it out: ""You didn't call me, that's not nice."" Yet, it was her choice, and frankly, I didn't care. She also started criticizing her husband, saying he doesn't invest himself, that he just sits at home drinking coffee, and that he is old. When I asked her how they met, she told me he was the one who hit on her and that she wasn't interested at first because he was unemployed at the time. In short, it wasn't love at first sight. She also asked me to download series for her and put them on a USB stick—something her husband could have done.

She had promised to show me a cooking recipe. I suggested she come to the house with her family, that we all cook together, and then eat the meal as a group. But one day, after an outing with her son and mine (exceptionally without the spouses), she said, ""Let's meet at your place for the recipe."" Okay, so once we arrived at my house, I thought we would chat over coffee or tea, but she refused. She started cooking all by herself and did the dishes without saying a word. It was very bizarre. Then she said, ""The meal is ready, I have to go now."" She left the premises without even having a conversation. In my opinion, it was a truly strange scene.

She had planned to go on a trip to Spain with her family; I told her I knew that country well and preferred Portugal. She then decided to go to Portugal with her family instead. I found that weird.

She began organizing outings with both families herself—booking hotels, suggesting hikes, barbecues, and meals at home, or outings with the children to the pool, etc. She even wanted our two families to go abroad together or to a mountain chalet. She also suggested organizing a ""girls' trip"" for her and my mother to a spa. Then, after about ten intense outings and several dinner invitations at each other's homes, she suddenly stopped giving any news. Just like that. She used to call to suggest outings on the spot... One day, her husband was supposed to help me assemble furniture—a plan made weeks in advance—and on the day of, he bailed on me. She intervened to force him to keep his promise, and when I went to pick him up by car, he said to me in the auto during the trip: ""If she wants us to separate, no problem."" I didn't understand that comment.

Then, no more news at all... I wrote to her several times to see if everything was okay, and she replied briefly. I then sent New Year's greetings to her husband, but got no response. She had promised to give me contacts for renovation companies, which she never did.

I finally confronted her via SMS several months later, after hearing nothing... I asked her why they had disappeared and why she hadn't given me the promised renovation information. She wrote back saying she was on vacation. I wrote to her: ""The two of you disappeared without giving us the promised contacts; you are users (profiteurs)."" She then called twice, but I didn't answer. She then replied with something like: ""A true friend would have tried to find out why someone is distancing themselves,"" and concluded: ""This is where our relationship ends.""

1qa6z48,https://www.reddit.com/r/compassionatecuts/comments/1qa6z48/homeless_outreach_belfast_41226/,Homeless Outreach Belfast 4/12/26,"Wow. What a success this afternoon was at Buoy Park.

I didn’t quite know what to expect, especially with the snow added into the mix and this being our very first week. But we had 9 callers, all of whom received some form of support, and I’m heading home this evening feeling incredibly grateful and full-hearted.

There were no haircuts today as I was on my own. Miss Fudge, our little pup, had an upset tummy, so to prevent stress (and potential accidents), Jack stayed at home to look after her. This also means there’s no pictures of our outreach but I’ve snapped some pictures to reference throughout the roundup.

I arrived around 1.45pm and got myself set up. I don’t have a table just yet, but after scoping the area out for a few weeks, I knew there was a small wall I could work around so I wouldn’t be too disruptive to the park. I brought out the hot drinks and soup first, not wanting to start pulling boxes out if no one appeared.

I poured myself a cuppa and took a moment to take in the world around me.

I spotted two gents eyeing up the hot drinks canisters, so as they approached, I asked if they fancied some soup or a cuppa. One asked for a coffee, so I showed him the box and told him to help himself. The other asked for soup and told me it reminded him of his mum and warmed him right through. That alone would have made the afternoon worthwhile.

While they were there, two lovely followers called over to drop off donations, and one lady even stayed for a chat. One of the gents mentioned he needed gloves, and just as I was about to head to the van, I was handed a donation bag (photo 1). Inside was a super thick pair of gloves, so I passed them straight to him. He was so excited he set his soup down to put them on immediately.

After chatting for a while, I brought out the clothing boxes, and both gents managed to kit themselves out with fresh outfits. One asked if I had a bag. I’ve been saving all the bags donations arrive in, and one of them happened to be a rucksack. I showed him the options and told him he could take his pick. When he realised he could actually have the rucksack, his eyes lit up. Of course he could have it – it was donated for exactly that reason. He filled it with his new clothes and headed off, taking some sweets with him and promising to tell everyone where to find me at 2pm on Sundays.

Not long after, one of them returned with four friends in tow.

They all had a cuppa and a rummage through the clothes. Each gent took a warmth pack (photo 2) and were especially excited about the hand warmers. Their packs already included scarves, but they asked if they could also have neck warmers, so each left with a snood, extra socks, and whatever clothing or shoes they needed, all packed into waterproof bags. Three gents got coats, and several found shoes that fit.

After a brief quiet spell, another lovely follower arrived with an incredible donation (photo 3): biscuits, coffee, hand warmers, kitchen roll (which definitely came in handy), a ladle (if you saw my earlier post, you’ll understand!), and an extremely generous monetary donation. I’m so sorry I didn’t catch your name – I was honestly overwhelmed – but thank you so much.

As she was there, our final three callers arrived.

One gent was quite shy. He took a cup of tea first, then slowly looked through the clothes. Each time he found something he liked, he asked for reassurance that he could have it. Each time, the answer was, of course, yes. He chose a new coat, so I sorted him a waterproof drawstring bag. He then quietly asked if he could also have a yellow one to replace his ripped carrier bag. We got that sorted, and I took his old bag for the bin.

I offered him snacks to take away, and he chose a pot noodle. I’d picked up reusable cutlery the night before (ironically cheaper than disposable knives), and he spotted them and asked if he could take one set. I only needed one knife anyway, so off he went, delighted.

Another gent appeared to be neurodivergent and was very focused on the bread. I offered him a hot drink and soup, which he declined, asking instead for toast. I explained I couldn’t toast the bread but could offer bread and butter. I also offered soup alongside it, but when he heard it was lentil, he decided to stick with bread and butter. He asked about jam, which I didn’t have, then went on his way content.

The final gent asked for a coffee and then asked what had us out on a Sunday. As I explained there was no Sunday support, he quickly said, “I’m not homeless.” I handed him his coffee and took a step back. I’ve learned the importance of listening and observing before making assumptions. After chatting a bit more, I found out he was sofa surfing with friends and heading to meet others at a hostel. He said he’d let them know where to find me on Sundays.

By the time he left, it was close to 3pm, so I packed up – just in time, as the snow started shortly after. I made sure the van was left as tidy as it had been when I arrived, to make future outreach sessions smoother.

I did a quick stock check and can confirm five gents received coats and tracksuit bottoms today. Thank you all for making that possible.

I kept some soup and hot drink supplies up front in case I met anyone on my way home. I bumped into one of our earlier callers and his friends, who didn’t need anything this time but said they’d be back next week.

I phoned my mum in a mild panic about leftover soup. She suggested the freezer, forgetting mine is already full of leftover dinners 🙈 So she kindly freed up space in hers so I could freeze it for next week. While I was there, my dad showed me a table he’d found online. I tried to give him the money, but he refused and ordered it anyway. Thank you, Mum and Dad 💚

A massive thank you to the three incredibly kind ladies who called to see us today. My head was in a million places, so I’m sorry if I didn’t chat much, but please know how much I appreciate you taking the time to come by.

And finally, thank you to the two ladies who sent items (photo 4) via our wishlist – Amazon delivered them while I was literally writing this post.

Thank you to every single person who has supported me on this journey. I couldn’t do any of this without you. This is exactly what I’ve been working towards, and I’m beyond grateful that our first Sunday was such a success.

Here’s to next week, and to more people receiving support 💚

I (28m)met a girl two months ago at work (I know bad choice) it’s a large campus and met her through mutual coworkers even though I had never seen her and most likely can go the rest of the time I work here without seeing her(I’m leaving in July)

We started with texting on company phones and switched to personal phones after we agreed to enter the talking stage to get to know each other then morning coffee meeting at our car and then lunch in our cars. Face time all day after work and talking on the phone during. Thursday she told me it wasn’t going anywhere and it won’t ever go anywhere. I said thanks for being honest and I won’t reach out again and I blocked her number just so I can guarantee I don’t bother her. 

I’m here thinking of why I miss her if we barely knew each other and we never did anything romantic. The only thing i can think of is I liked the attention but also because of the fantasy I put in my head about her. All the dates we would go on and how life would be and felt great.

We had nothing in common, like 0% things in common not even the type of food we liked. So I’m not sure why I’m still obsessing over her and waiting for her to reach out some way. She was the first girl I opened up to again after my two year relationship that ended 4 months ago so I hate that I have to open up to someone again down the road.

I'm building an RTD protein coffee and I need your help to get it right.

Here's the problem: Every time I want a good coffee, it's either:

* A cafe-bought coffee that costs ₹150+ and has zero protein
* A protein shake that tastes chalky and kills my afternoon vibe
* Some sugary ""coffee drink"" that's basically dessert

**None of these work.** I want something that actually tastes like good coffee, doesn't bloat me, and keeps me fueled for 4+ hours.

So I'm building it: A 250ml RTD Can with 10-12g Protein, 75mg Caffeine, zero added sugar, and targeting ₹80-99.

Think of it as: **Cold Brew meets Protein, but without the trade-offs.**

I need to validate three things before I launch:

1. **The Price**: Would ₹80-99 feel like a daily habit or a treat?
2. **The Taste**: Do you want it to taste like crisp black coffee or creamy like a cafe latte?
3. **Where You'd Buy It**: Office pantry? Gym? Quick commerce? Transit hub?",0,1768155990.0,energydrinks,0,0.5,False

We recently started hanging out one-on-one but having been talking/texting for a few weeks.

During our first hangout, she mentioned that she’s happy on her own and not actively seeking a relationship, but that if the right man came along, she’d be open to it. Because of that, I’ve been trying to move carefully and not assume anything.

Here’s what’s happened so far, sticking to observable things: 
•	Both hangouts were one-on-one 
•	Both started as “just golf” because she wants to learn 
•	Both times, she expanded them into several hours and multiple activities

First hangout (I initiated and was last Saturday): We golfed for about 30 minutes, then she suggested going to Hobby Lobby together. That turned into walking around Target, then Walmart. We weren’t really shopping — mostly just walking, talking, and laughing — and then we grabbed coffee. The whole thing lasted around 3–4 hours.

Second hangout (I initiated over text and was yesterday): I asked to golf again. She suggested getting food first, so we went to brunch. Brunch went really well — we talked the entire time. After that, we went to Target to maybe look at Lego sets and ended up just walking around, talking, and laughing again.

While we were there, we talked about “vibes,” and I asked what vibe I gave off. She jokingly said “nonchalant.”

On the drive to golf afterward, we somehow got on the topic of the town I live in for work, and she joked, “Maybe I need to go there to find a husband.”

While golfing, when I helped her hit better, she would high-five me, which sometimes turned into brief hand holding, or she’d stand shoulder-to-shoulder with me while I explained where to aim. Overall, it was very relaxed, playful, and fun for both of us.

After golf, we went back to our building. I was carrying my stuff in, and she offered to help carry some back to my room, which I accepted. When we got there, I invited her in and gave her a quick tour of my very small room. She was laughing a lot and seemed to genuinely enjoy herself.

In both cases, what could’ve been a short activity turned into a few hours.

She’s also: 
•	Explicitly said she had a great time after both outings 
•	Talked about doing things again during our hangouts 
•	Remembered small details I’ve told her about my life and family 
•	Made callbacks to those details later
 •	Mentioned that she’s talked to her family about me

One thing that adds to my confusion: She’s noticeably warmer and more engaged one-on-one, but more reserved or neutral in class or group settings. Not rude or cold — just more nonchalant. Things like “we’ll talk later,” almost like she doesn’t want people in our class to assume we’re a thing.

The reason I’m conflicted is that I genuinely think she’s a very kind person, and I can’t tell if this is: 
•	romantic interest 
•	or her just being very nice and comfortable

Because I’m not 100% sure, and because I think she might just be shy or cautious with this kind of thing, I’m considering saying something like this to her in person:

“I’ve thought about what you said about me being nonchalant, and I realized I might not be the easiest person to read. I wanted to clear the air.

I really enjoy spending time with you, I like your company, and I think you’re great. I’m not looking to rush anything, but I didn’t want there to be any uncertainty about how I feel.

Once things calm down next week after our tests, if you’re up for it, I’d love to take you to dinner and get to know each other better.”

**Two**

March 15, 1990, in Landover, Maryland, was the last time I “experienced” the Grateful Dead. Oh, I went to a few shows after college before Jerry passed. And I saw the Dead and Company in 2018, and sometime later, which I can’t even place right now. But it was this particular Landover show, on what would have been my father’s 79th birthday (although I did not know that then) and what was Phil Lesh’s 50th birthday, that became a spindle around which part of me will forever revolve.

The reason this show was important to me is that it was the day I ‘grew up.’ I was nearing the end of my teenage drug use at this point in time, and this would be one of the last times - possibly the last time? - that I used LSD. I was doing a semester in Washington, D.C. for college and living in Dupont Circle. My college girlfriend had come to visit me for spring break, my roommates were gone, and I had acquired tickets to the last two of three nights the Dead would be playing Landover.

For those of you not familiar with the geography of Washington DC, Landover is southeast of the city quite a ways. There is a subway that will get you reasonably close during the day, but the DC subway system shuts down at midnight (or at least it did then). Southeast DC in those days was a tough and crack-decimated neighborhood. The Capital Center Arena was in an industrial area just barely into the ‘safe’ area where the suburbs began to emerge from the urban ruin created by George Bush and Marion Barry.

My girlfriend and I took the subway. We walked some distance to get to the theater, if I recall correctly. We were far too broke for a taxi. We arrived at the parking lot scene plenty early. We wandered in a sea of tie dye among groups of kids our age playing hacky sack, twirling devil sticks, selling homemade T-shirts and hand-beaded bracelets, and we passed a dozen disheveled gentlemen coughing into their hands *cough* acid *cough* *cough* weed c*ough*. With one of them, we stepped between two parked cars and, keeping the money low and out of sight, procured a few tabs of acid. Everywhere around us, people wandered with one finger stuck in the air, singing “I need a miracle” and searching for the elusive extra ticket, given as a gift, to get them into the show.

The Dead scene of the day was ostensibly about community and taking care of one another and the planet. It had its rough edges - when Jerry died and the Dead stopped touring, LSD availability declined by 90-95% in the US according to the DEA. The carnival in the Dead parking lot was a major nationwide distribution network, as it turned out. But what we discussed was community, compassion, peace and love. Tolerance of a bit of criminal enterprise and personal freedom were part and parcel of that ethos. For as rough as parts of it were, it was immensely safe (as long as you didn’t “get on the bus” - a multilevel custom greyhound run by a cult religion, which would always invite you in for lemonade and cookies if you were having a rough trip, and then drug you, kidnap you, and bring you to work at one of the many “Yellow Delis” here in the northeast, to pay off your fare).

**Three**

I took my acid long before we walked into the show. The psychedelia of the parking lot is perfect for tripping. If people weren’t playing the Dead out of their car windows while they tailgated pre-show, you were sure to stumble across a drumming circle or a couple of gentlemen wearing nothing but cut-off shorts, with beat-up acoustic guitars with jute rope straps, glistening sweat and pounding out the chorus to Throwing Stones (”Ashes, ashes, all fall down”). Everywhere around you, people were strung out, smiling, and wishing you the best.

Years later, I would realize that the bright colors of the Grateful Dead and the many cute logos (the dancing teddy bears, the “Stealie” (steal your face lightening skull), the Skeleton Uncle Sam, the Yellow Sky and Blue Sun (”The sky was yellow and the sun was blue”) bridged a gap between things that were childish and things that were adult. The reason the Dead were so successful with the college-age generation was that, on the one hand, they surrounded you visually with primary colors and playful images, and musically, with frequent calls back to the warm love and magic of childhood. On the other hand, they provided an environment where you had a chance to play with the freedom and responsibility of adulthood. It was the perfect environment for those seeking to find themselves as they came of age.

I remember, as a very young boy, being terrified of the skeleton and skulls motif favored by the Dead. I thought Deadheads must be satanists when I was 9. But, by my Deadhead period, those cartoons were a way to laugh at the specter of death. The Dead Lot was a place I could regress into childlike behavior, even as I tried to comprehend the cruelty of the unforgiving world into which I was inexorably moving. It was a place to thumb your nose at the responsibility of the adult world, even while sampling some of its sensory experiences.

After enough time experiencing the scene, we made our way into the show. I remember that our seats were not together, and that mine was the very first row, so that I was standing on the floor, but would have had to hop over a security barrier to be in the throng of dancers. It was perfect for me - I preferred my sweat-soaked patchouli throngs at arm’s length, even then. I had plenty of space to groove - even if a security guard close at hand meant I wasn’t sparking up a joint or a cigarette.

**Four** The moment I remember so viscerally from that show was Jerry singing *I Will Take You Home* to Brent’s spare and plaintive keyboard ([https://archive.org/details/gd1990-03-15.109251.aud.vamarty.shnf/gd1990-03-15d2t05.shn#:\~:text=Will](https://archive.org/details/gd1990-03-15.109251.aud.vamarty.shnf/gd1990-03-15d2t05.shn#:~:text=Will) Take You-,Home,->). My father had died when I was 2 years old, and that night at that show, when that song came on, the world narrowed into a tube and suddenly Jerry was singing to me and me alone. He was promising me that he would be a replacement for my father and that he would take care of me no matter what else happened. The music touched some central part of me - some psychological complex buried so deep that I still can’t click that link without bursting into tears. Perhaps that, right there, was the end of my childhood.

Because 25 minutes later or so, the show would end. And, here’s the thing. We had made plans on how to get to the show, but we knew that it would end after the subway was closed. We had at least a half dozen friends who would also be at that show, so I just presumed that one of them would …. well, take me home. I made that assumption because the Dead was a community and it was all about caring for one another. I made that assumption despite the fact that where I lived was an hour or more out of the way for each of my friends who would be at the show. I made that assumption despite knowing that all of us would be intoxicated in one way or another and likely beyond driving.

Prior to the show I had met several of my friends in the Lot and one by one they had told me that no, they would not go out of the way to bring us home that evening. I was slightly concerned going into the arena, but presumed I would catch someone else on the lot afterwards who I had not seen yet (there was one single friend left I had not found in that time before cell phone locators). But when the show let out, still tripping hard, I (and the rest of the fans) were met by an impressive phalanx of horse-mounted Maryland State Troopers, strongly indicating the State’s preference that we disperse with all good speed. There was no chance to find anyone else we knew as the police pressed forward with bullhorns repeating “clear the lot, now.” There was only trying to get our discombobulated minds off the property of the Capital Center Arena without a law enforcement officer deciding to search us, and what would have naturally come next.

As we stumbled into the concrete jungle that was Southeast DC at 1 AM in the morning, I suddenly realized how bleak my situation was. All the middle-class white kids were in a stream of cars headed for the freeway on-ramp. My friends, who I had thought would care for me, had left us behind. And we had neither the cash nor the credit for a taxi ride across DC. I remember walking for a while with my girlfriend, terrified, realizing how badly I had screwed up. Ultimately, we arrived at a single lit gas station where the clerk took pity on me and let me use the phone. From there, I managed to wake up a friend who was still in the dorm over break, and have him promise to give me the money for the cab ride, if I could persuade a driver to get us back. Which we did, and he did with a few more calls and much anxiety.

For a long time afterwards, I was angry at the Dead scene. I sold the tickets for the next night’s show, and we made ourselves a lobster dinner with the money. “People are so selfish!” I complained. How could no one have driven me home? In this scene, which was all about community and caring for one another, how could they have been so disrespectful to me?

It took time. A few years. But at some point, the lesson finally dawned on me. It was I who had been selfish and disrespectful to my friends. They had gone to that show not looking for extra luggage, and I had just assumed they would take care of my girlfriend and me without recompense. In an environment I knew to be sketchy and unsafe, I had consumed a substance that left me discombobulated and unable to deal with the risk that was coming. I had been, for lack of a better word, childish in the extreme. As I reflected on my own role in that experience over the next few years, I learned a valuable lesson about taking care of myself so that others won’t have to.

**Five**

There is a rumor that the name “The Grateful Dead” refers to a passage from the Egyptian Book of the Dead, which states that a set of ‘grateful dead’ pull the chariot of the sun, to help the newly dead and the lost dead find their way through the darkness to the light. Bob Weir was raised as a Rosicrucian, and later in my life, I would come to study Rosicrucian teachings in some depth. While it is unclear if this is an accurate translation from the Book of the Dead, it is an idea that is central to esoteric and Rosicrucian philosophy that all of us are either dreaming or dead and living in a halfway world - a limbo - waiting for a Sleeping God to awaken.

In that philosophy, we are all just tiny sparks of the Sleeping God’s mind in its dream. We are all one entity that does not, at this moment, recognize itself as a single entity. Among the many latent sparks of consciousness, a small number recognize their role as part of a greater whole. That small group of awakened (yes, “woke”) souls are then charged to look out for the others and try to help them find the light so that we, as one, may ultimately awake to our unified Godhood. While I am familiar with this myth as it shows up in the Vedic literature, I think Bobby, Jerry and the Boys took the Vedic idea and ascribed it to Egyptian origins (The Rosicrucians love themselves some Egyptian symbology).

**Six**

One of the other key tenets of this philosophical system, however, is best summed up with a modern saying: “You must secure your mask before securing others.” You cannot care for other people if you do not care for yourself. There is more pain and suffering in the world than any one of us can manage on our own. We are also, of all people, the best situated to manage our own tribulations. Therefore, the lesson is that the very first thing one does upon awakening is secure one’s own safety and continuation. Only once that is accomplished do you have the footing to lend aid to others.

I think the socialist ethos that was central to the Grateful Dead of the 60s and 70s, which lingered into my era of the 80s and 90s, is just basic moral behavior. We are all one species, sharing one planet with limited resources. The idea that a minute splinter of the population should control all the resources, and thus how we all live our lives, is troubling. The fact that we seem to be selecting that splinter by who can break the most laws, tell the most lies, and operate in the most sociopathic manner possible is a failure of Western Society on a grand scale.

But nothing is black and white. Everything is a spectrum. To be a contributing member of a socialist system means getting your shit together, doing the work, and knowing how the hell you are going to get home from the concert. We are not a nation of children with a few punishing caretakers controlling our behavior with threats and violence. We are a nation of self-responsible equals - of competent people who, for the most part, want to do right by each other. We each have an ethical duty not to be an unreasonable burden on our neighbors, but we also have an ethical obligation, once we have achieved the first step, to help out the neighbors who have not been as fortunate as we.

I took a step away from the Jam Band circuit for some time after that Dead show. I went to a handful of Phish shows, and, although I was entranced by the music, all I could see was the selfishness of an audience of children rallying against the responsibilities of growing up. I started going to coffee houses in church basements, eschewing the chaos of large scale musical gatherings.

With the years, much contemplation, and my own growth, I have come to understand life as a Path. Different people are at different stages, and the Mystery Schools of the Grateful Dead and Phish (their concerts are strongly reminiscent of the Ancient Greeks’ Mystery Ceremonies) are a place to learn and grow. They are and were a cocoon for experimentation. You will never understand better that we are all part of a single entity, than when you are standing in a group of 30,000 people, blitzed out of their minds, moving in tandem to a musical exploration of creative space.

For those of you who never had the experience of entering into one of these temples, and tasting of the sacred waters, I don’t pretend that it was something one had to do. There are many paths to progress along the soul’s path. This was just one particularly colorful and chaotic one. Still, having said that, if you never experienced an actual live Dead show or early Phish show, you will never really understand the potentially transformative nature of the event. It will always be a part of me.

Bob Weir died yesterday. Saturday, January 10, 2026. The two drummers of the Grateful Dead (Micky Hart and Bill Kreutzmann) are alive as of the date of this writing, but the Dead is now good and finally gone. Bobby hoped that his music would have a “300 year legacy,” and with Robert Hunter’s extraordinary lyrics, Jerry’s sense of melody, Bobby’s unorthodox and expansive rhythm parts, and Phil’s grooves, it could last that long.

But the Grateful Dead scene has long been gone. With Bobby’s passing, a door that was only a hair’s breadth open closes for good. Other bands will come. Other coming-of-age rituals will evolve in our society. Mountains fall, and mountains rise. The music never stops.

I could have tried to write an homage to Bobby’s musical genius - but that is a task for other, more qualified people. Elsewhere, I have written that none of us exists alone, but that each of us is a string of knots tied together with the strings of the countless other people who we have met and who have influenced us in our lives. Bob Weir was a knot in my string, and today that knot lies severed.

Bob Weir knew that he played a role in millions of lives. He did not know that he played a role in mine, and yet he did. Rest in Peace, Bob. May the four winds blow you safely home.",3,1768155905.0,libertigris,0,1.0,False

If I eat/drink liquid I have a 90% chance of having heartburn and consistently worse bloating over time for hours that gets worse if I move. 

If I eat dinner, I often can't sleep for hours because laying down pours acid/food into my throat. 

If I drink coffee, it often won't even make it out of my stomach until late in the day, so I basically have a headache for hours in the morning until I get a caffeine rush when I'd prefer to be sleepy at night. 

I like being active but it's a crap shoot as to whether drinking a coffee or whatever will help.

Taking vitamins can be disgusting if I end up burping them up for several hours.

The ""eat small meals"" advice is almost worse because if I eat a small portion of something in the morning, it's like I get progressively fuller feeling all day as it sits there. So if I only eat one big dinner I lose sleep for several hours BUT I can feel mostly ok during the day.

Anyway, I just hate it. I'll have a day where I take some vitamins with coffee and have fast digestion that day, peeing vitamin colored water within an hour, so I have a snack and things slow right back down. 

Do you all just feel like shit all of the time? 

One of my favorite pleasures is eating a tastey meal, followed closely by doing various chores and athletic activities, but in the last 7 years it's gotten to where I just mostly sit around unless I have a completely empty stomach, which often still causes random heartburn now.

If we do a 99 inch sofa there is about 36 inches walkway between the left side and chair until the chair arm angles in- then it's like 26 inches. There is 24.5 inches between right of the sofa and the back door floor mat and another 20 inches until the door (so 44.5 inches from side of sofa to door). I am not sure if we need 36 inches of clearance between the sofa and the floor mat.

We do not plan on any side tables just a coffee table.

99 inch sofa vs 87.5 inch sofa, it's just less seating so I want to know if the 99 could make sense.",1,1768155835.0,DesignMyRoom,2,1.0,False
1qa6r1v,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYZuz7B4ObI,Please Help: My Singleplayer Game is Trying to Load a Multiplayer Server Unprompted,"Whenever I load into a world it doesn't work for some reason--- It keeps saying I have invalid player data and that I can't load into the server even though it is a single player world. Sometimes I can try a second time but then it will either say there are issues with my data packs or it will load in for a few seconds, I will see the world, then it will crash.

I have a lot of performance mods, maybe too many, but I don't know what to cull to make it work! Please help if you can!

I started feeling dizzy and knew I had to leave, but the line was moving slowly and I didn’t want to make a scene. I tried to explain that I really just needed to step out and maybe pay for my order later, but the barista kept offering me different pastries and insisted I take a drink I didn’t want “on the house.”

I said, a little flustered, that I’d just pay for what I had and leave. I also mentioned that I was feeling off because of a medical thing—nothing serious, just that my mind was scrambled. Somehow, that didn’t seem to register. There was a lot of insistence, like they couldn’t hear me say “no.” I ended up nodding and taking the pastry anyway, because it felt impossible to refuse politely.

I left feeling frustrated and embarrassed. Later, I wondered if there was a better way to handle situations like this. How do you politely but firmly set boundaries when people just don’t seem to understand—or maybe don’t want to?

1qa6pt6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlasFeels/comments/1qa6pt6/love_letter_for_no_one/,Love Letter for No One,"Dear No One,  
  
**I don’t know who you are yet.** 



It’s been two years since my last serious relationship. I just came home from a really nice day: walked around UP, had dinner with friends, and had some beers afterwards. I drove home playing sad songs (e.g., Love Song for No One by John Mayer, Mariposa by Sugarfree, The District Sleeps Alone Tonight by the Postal Service). They’re all in a dedicated playlist that makes me feel *even more* alone whenever I’m alone – adding fuel to the fire. Feeling empty while driving home alone wasn’t an unfamiliar feeling. It’s been something constant the last 2 years. 

With my foot on the gas pedal, I couldn’t help but think: 

**I wonder what you’re doing right now.** Are you sleeping? Are you on vacation on a different side of the world? What are you thinking about right now? Perhaps also enjoying a night out with friends on a given Sunday. How do you feel right now? Maybe you’re still in a relationship with another guy, or girl. 

**I wonder what you ate for breakfast today.** I wonder what your favorite color is. I wonder if you’re either a cat person or a dog person. I hope you’re a dog person. But if you’re not, it’s okay. We’ll still make it work. 

**I wonder what you look like.** Do you have long hair? Do you have fair skin? I wonder what perfume you use. I bet whatever you look like, I will still love you for a very, very long time – until we’re old and gray.



I promise I’ll send this to you maybe after our first, third, or even fifth anniversary, probably on a special day. I want you to feel special, and I want you to know that despite all the loneliness and hurt I’m feeling right now, I’m still very excited to meet you. I promise I’ll make you feel seen, cared for, and most of all, loved. From all the small things like making sure to open the car door for you, putting a blanket over you when you feel cold, or waking you up with your favorite meal ready on the table, up to the bigger things like helping you heal from all your past traumas and making you feel special even on the days when you feel like you don’t deserve it.



I swear I’ve healed from my last relationship. Healing hasn’t been easy but I’m better now and I’ve grown. I checked all the boxes in the single checklist like “dating yourself” and “learning to love spending time alone”. People told me to wait for you, and I have done my best to be patient. However, it still really sucks: this waiting game. It feels like waiting for someone you don’t will ever arrive (or even exist).



Once we meet, let’s do all sorts of awesome stuff together. I’ll take you to the zoo. Maybe we can have a picnic afterwards? Let’s not tell anyone and spontaneously do an 8-hour drive to a place we’ve never been to and spend the night there. We can watch the sunrise by the beach afterwards. Let’s watch your favorite movies with a blanket over us. I’ll buy wine from the grocery store and we’ll talk about alternate endings and stupid theories. I won’t have to drive home alone from family reunions. You’ll be there beside me and we’ll laugh about the most mundane things and talk about our favorite childhood memories.

Anyway, I’m writing this at 2AM alone in my condo while drinking cold coffee. It’s a pretty cold night and it stings more than usual. I hope that when you read this, you realize how deeply appreciative I am for finally meeting you. You are the biggest blessing ever and I’ll write more letters for you once we meet. If we ever meet. My deepest fear is that we won’t.  
  
I hope that the red string tied over our pinkies meet someday. Again, I’m so excited to meet you, whoever you are. I hope you actually exist. **I don’t know who you are yet**, but I love you, whoever you are.

Using RO water with no TWW definitely makes my coffee taste thinner for lack of a better term, but I can't really tell the difference between RO + TWW and tap.

My question is not really ""should I just do tap"" because I know this subreddit will just say ""go with whatever tastes good to you."" My real question is, am I missing something with my RO + TWW? I feel like I could improve my cup somehow by sticking with RO and adjusting the minerals recipe, I currently do the recommended one packet per gallon.

1qa6luc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qa6luc,Cold Brew Concentrate Done Hot,"TLDR: quick & dirty hot coffee concentrate.

I generally drink a heated cold brew made from the Toddy system. But when I don’t have any concentrate made, I am using a hot brew made using the ORB.

It is 40 grams of medium dark ground beans. I grind it slightly coarse on my old Kitchenaid grinder. I spritz the beans before grinding to minimize the static electricity. It makes the whole process much easier.

My tamper is missing in action, so I use a measuring cup as a tamper. It actually seems to work better than the ORB’s tamper. I use Areopress filters on both bottom and top of the ORB’s coffee container. 

With the ORB’s tamper, I would see small drips come through after a minute or a bit longer. With the measuring cup, I often don’t see any drip through until I start to pump.

I add hot water to the line and start my 2 minute timer. I do a 2 minute soak before pumping.  My first pump or two are when water really starts to infuse through the coffee, but there isn’t much back pressure.

I let it rest for a few seconds after those first two pumps. Then I start pumping more rapidly. Around the 4th or 5th pump, I get resistance. That lasts a couple pumps then pressure drops off as I continue to pump.

At the tail end, the faux crema appears, and I know I have gotten the majority of the water out. That light brown crema disappears into the coffee concentrate.

At that point I can assemble my coffee. A couple dollops of half & half, a couple packets of stevia, the ORB pseudo concentrate, and then hot water. Not connoisseur’s coffee but a strong coffee without heavy acidic overtones.  ",2,1768155493.0,OXORapidBrewer,0,1.0,False

1qa6khg,https://www.reddit.com/r/MenWithDiscipline/comments/1qa6khg/how_to_get_rich_without_being_a_finance_bro/,How to Get RICH Without Being a Finance Bro: Ancient Money Secrets That Actually Work (Science Backed),"honestly stumbled on this while doom scrolling through book recs at 2am because my savings account was giving me anxiety. found out this 1926 book has better financial advice than 99% of fintech influencers. studied it alongside behavioral economics research and modern wealth building strategies. the crazy part? these principles from ancient babylon still work better than most ""get rich quick"" schemes people fall for today.

here's the thing nobody wants to admit. we're all walking around pretending we understand money while secretly panicking about rent   student loans   and whether we can afford that coffee. society doesn't teach us this stuff. schools skip it entirely. parents avoid talking about it. so we end up learning from credit card companies and social media flexers. no wonder most people are broke.The Richest Man in Babylon   by George Clason isn't some boring finance textbook. it's literally parables set in ancient babylon that make wealth building feel less like a calculus exam and more like storytelling. clason was a businessman who started writing these pamphlets about money for banks and insurance companies. then everyone realized holy shit these actually work. the book's sold millions of copies and honestly deserves every bit of hype. this is the best introduction to personal finance i've ever read because it strips away all the complicated jargon and gets to the core psychological principles.

the main concept is almost stupidly simple but most people never do it.   pay yourself first  . not after rent   not after that concert ticket   not after doordash. first. clason says save at least 10% of everything you earn before touching anything else. treat it like a bill you owe to future you. the babylonians called this ""fattening your purse"" which honestly sounds way more fun than ""building an emergency fund."" 

here's where it gets interesting though. clason breaks down the difference between assets and liabilities in a way that makes actual sense. don't just save money and let it rot. make your money work for you through investments   side businesses   or learning high income skills. the book talks about ""making gold multiply"" which is basically passive income before passive income was cool. one story follows a guy who learns carpentry and eventually owns a workshop. another invests in merchant caravans. modern version? learn coding   invest in index funds   start that etsy shop you keep talking about.

the psychological insight that hit different was this idea that   we expand our lifestyle to match our income  . you get a raise   suddenly you need a bigger apartment. promotion? time for a new car. clason calls this the trap of ""necessary expenses"" that aren't actually necessary. his solution is to live on 70% max of your income, save 10%   and use 20% for investments or debt payoff. sounds restrictive until you realize most people live on 110% of their income and stay broke forever.YNAB (you need a budget) applies these babylonian principles through an app that actually makes budgeting feel less like punishment. it forces you to assign every dollar a job before you spend it. basically the digital version of those clay tablets the babylonians used to track their grain. the app costs money but honestly pays for itself within a month when you realize how much you were bleeding on random subscriptions and impulse purchases. the YNAB community on reddit is also insanely supportive   full of people who went from drowning in debt to actually having savings.

another crucial principle from the book is   protecting your wealth from loss  . don't invest in shit you don't understand just because some guy on twitter said it's the next big thing. clason tells this story about a brickmaker who loses his savings investing in a jewel merchant's scheme. moral of the story? stick to what you know or learn from people who actually have expertise. before you dump money into crypto   stocks   or whatever   study it obsessively or find a legitimate advisor. the book recommends consulting with ""those skilled in handling gold"" which today means certified financial planners   not reddit degenerates or tiktok gurus.the book also destroys the excuse that ""i don't make enough to save."" one parable features a slave who saves his way to freedom by applying these principles. if that's not motivational idk what is. clason's point is that wealth building is about percentages and habits   not absolute numbers. someone making 30k who saves 10% is doing better financially than someone making 100k who saves nothing.

The Psychology of Money by Morgan Housel pairs disgustingly well with this. housel's a former wall street journal columnist who basically explains why smart people make dumb money decisions. while babylon gives you the rules   housel explains the emotional and psychological warfare happening in your brain around money. why you panic sell. why you buy things to impress people you don't like. why wealth is what you don't see. 

BeFreed is an AI learning app built by Columbia grads and former Google engineers that turns these exact concepts into personalized audio content. Type in something like ""become financially independent"" or ""understand investment psychology  "" and it pulls from books like these plus research papers and expert interviews to create custom podcasts matched to your learning style. 

The adaptive learning plan is what makes it different. It tracks what resonates with you and builds a structured path based on your actual goals and struggles. You can customize everything from a quick 15 minute overview to a 40 minute deep dive with real examples. The voice options are legitimately addictive   from calm and analytical to energetic coaching style   which matters when you're listening during commutes or at the gym. Makes dense financial concepts way more digestible than trying to force yourself through textbooks.

reading these back to back creates this complete framework for understanding both the mechanics and psychology of building wealth.

what makes the babylon book still relevant is that it focuses on timeless principles instead of specific tactics. it's not telling you to invest in babylonian pottery or whatever. it's teaching mindset shifts. insanely good read that takes like 3 hours but changes how you think about every dollar you touch. the writing style is a bit old school with all the ""thee"" and ""thou"" stuff but honestly it makes the lessons stick better somehow.the final lesson that deserves more attention is about   increasing your ability to earn  . don't just focus on saving and investing. focus on becoming more valuable. learn skills. take courses. read obsessively. network with people ahead of you. the babylonians understood that your earning power is your greatest asset. a skill that makes you 20% more valuable is worth infinitely more than cutting your coffee budget.

look   nobody's becoming a millionaire overnight from this book. but if you actually apply these principles consistently for a few years   you'll be in a completely different financial position. the compound effect is real. small actions repeated over time create massive results. most people just never start because they're waiting for the perfect moment or the big break. meanwhile babylonians figured this out 4000 years ago and we're still out here stressed about money.

I know the city is lonely, hard to meet friends due to life and schedules but if we can start chill and slow maybe something lowkey we can find some nice folks in the same boat.



I am in Vancouver and hope to meet some nice folks. Lets start with a walk and coffee.



If the weathers too bad coffee to start.



I love movies, poker, trivia nights, rock climbing, maybe do a potluck, karaoke. So many fun things



Let me know if anyone is down we can start a chat group and meet up!",8,1768155369.0,Vancouver4Friends,1,0.84,False

A lifetime ago I worked at the old French Culinary Institute in SoHo before changing careers and heading back south. My girlfriend and I are coming up Jan 14–19, mainly to see Fred Again in Queens, but we’re treating it like a long-overdue NYC food week. I haven’t been back in about 14 years, so I’m hoping to catch up on what’s great right now.

We’re staying at 50 Bowery in Chinatown, keeping most of our exploring downtown, but we’d love one big dinner in Brooklyn (Bed-Stuy, Crown Heights, Greenpoint, or Park Slope) with six people catching up. We’ve checked Bong (booked) and reached out to Falansai, but open to other ideas that have excellent food and a relaxed, genuine vibe. Adventurous eaters, but we don’t necessarily need “fine dining.”

For the rest of the trip, it’s mostly just the two of us eating our way around:

* Thinking Hwa Yuan for Peking Duck (again with friends)
* Kopitiam (possibly with friends instead of duck)
* John’s for a pizza fix
* Balthazar for pastries and coffee for breakfast on heavier lunch days
* Katz’s for pastrami
* Russ & Daughters Café or any LES bagel recs you love

We’d love your current favorites that really capture what’s special about downtown Manhattan and Brooklyn right now, especially neighborhood restaurants with amazing energy and flavor.

Thanks so much for any advice! Really looking forward to being back and seeing how the City’s eating these days.",4,1768155344.0,FoodNYC,9,0.84,False
