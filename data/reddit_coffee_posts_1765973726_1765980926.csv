1poxk1s,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1poxk1s/after_a_14_month_struggle_i_was_ready_to_give_it/,"After a 14 Month Struggle, I Was Ready to Give It All Up. Today, I Received a Life-Changing Offer Letter.","**TL/DR:** I've been out of work for over a year, living out of my car, and was recently denied SNAP. My savings almost depleted, a kind colleague and an ex-VP reached out, giving me a lifeline and re-instilling my sense of self-worth. An interview materialized within a matter of hours, and I was extended an offer letter for 2x what I was making in early 2024.



After 138 applications, I'd stopped counting the number of rejections, and gave up completely on trying to follow-up on ghosted applications or interviews. It's no surprise to anyone else that has been struggling this year, that this current job market is a brutal one. The unemployment rate is at a four-year high of 4.6%, and as many of us have depleted our savings, the current administration seemingly takes pleasure in cruelly making food assistance even more difficult to obtain. 

Somewhere around May, I was told that my SNAP benefits would be ending, as I no longer qualified. Even though I'd been living in my car since September prior, the fact I was enrolled in part-time college coursework disqualified me. Apparently part of the new qualification set is that you're not allowed to better yourself. When you have next to nothing left, $185 a month for food really does make a difference. I tried to appeal, but the powers that be pushed me further downward with a three-month sanction before I could re-apply. 

late 2024 and all of 2025 has been the second worst period of my life. First place goes to 2000, the year my brother died of a massive stroke, and my Dad was diagnosed with thyroid cancer. On top of that, he'd just been laid off from his job, after having worked there since the early 1970s. 2024 handed me not only a divorce, but the dissolution of my job. I was to be spun off after a corporate carve out, and ""promoted"" into a ""compensation neutral"" role. After reluctantly accepting and trying to find something else in the meantime, I was told a further restructuring would be taking place due to massive sales losses. In other words, I would be losing my job, and was laid off. 

I can't even begin to tell you how many hours I spent this year, sitting at this very computer, contending with my mental health, and wondering if I even had a future, let alone a near-future. I'd been laid off before, with 2008 having also proven difficult. There was something eerily different about this time around though. The lack of hope. The feeling of external politics just continually blacking out the daylight. Friends and family going through similar experiences of either losing jobs, or having merit increases frozen while also taking on more work from management with the expectation to outperform prior productivity.

Last week, I received a message on LinkedIn of all places, from a colleague. LinkedIn. The one site I'd come to recognize as absolutely unreliable and useless in terms of job searching and applying. They indicated a role had opened up in my original department, and they felt I would be the ideal candidate for it. Senior level, and definitely with more responsibilities, but I had all the core skillsets, and even some outside of the role that would really help me to excel. I wasn't sure at first. You know how it is... Month after month of searching without result destroys your self-confidence. Self opinion leaves the chat. You wonder what's wrong with you, and why no one deems you good enough to interview, let alone be contacted for an initial screening call. 

So I thought, ""What the hell have I got to lose at this point. Everything else has been an abysmal failure."" The only solid interview I'd had in November turned into a voicemail, indicating a hiring freeze had taken effect, that the requisition had been rescinded, and to have a happy holiday. So I thanked my colleague for reaching out, braced myself with a cup of affordable and horrible-tasting coffee, and applied just as the role became active on the company career page. 

Less than 24-hours later, I received a direct call from the divisional VP of my previous pre-disastrous carveout role, and he was recollecting how impressed he was with me in my time there, and that he'd reach out to the hiring manager for the role. The next morning at 9AM, I had an invite to interview directly with the hiring manager and team. Recruiter screening bypassed, directly on to the good stuff. For the first time in more than 14 months, I felt a glimmer of hope. Someone had turned the pilot light back on. 

The panel interview was comfortable, and my answers to technical questions were met with the engineer head-nod of approval. I literally felt the sense of confidence and self-worth flooding back into my consciousness as we talked further, and I became excited, sharing my experiences and how I really could accomplish great things in this role. This morning, I opened up my e-mail to an offer letter. Nearly twice the amount in compensation as my previous role with the same company. Profit sharing. Full benefits. Medical insurance. I can finally have these bilateral 12mm and 18mm kidney stones obliterated and removed without going into medical debt. I can finally feel healthy again. I can have a room to sleep in again. It sounds simple, but to me, it's life changing at this point.

My life has seemingly changed for the better in an instant. I've been reminded that even through a rough period in my life, there were people out there thinking about me. I did work that made a strong enough impact that it left a positive impression. I'm feeling beyond thankful. I'm feeling genuine happiness and relief for the first time in more than a year.

It was/is hard. I was the one to take make her come with me to the E.R when she wouldnt make an appointment herself. I only managed to convince myself to take her only after talking about it with my therapist. that was 6 months ago, i think... After her initial stay in the E.R (she was in for a week i dont remember) She came back home but that night she was complaining that her chest/stomach hurt so we called an ambulance for her. So she then proceeded to stay in the hospital for another week or so. I was left home with my older cousin (Me and her have some form of development issues) and I was scared most nights because I was never alone more than a day without my Auntie. I know that's bad, but i grew up with her, she was basically my mom and I was never without her because of separation anxiety on my part.

After a month of in and out E.R visits, she stabilized with only her occasionally having pain in her stomach or chest. But she slowly declined over the last 2-3 months until she was so weak she couldnt even get up to use the bathroom anymore. aand i remember her hospice nurse coming over one day and she said that she was transistioninf to the end of her life.

I didnt even get to visit her because i thought i had more time, i wanted to tell her i love her, i wanted to sit with her one last time but i cant do that anymore.

it was just today that i decided to make coffee for me and her, and i could just hear her voice saying that phrase she loved to use 'Thank you, I shall dance at your wedding' And i just started to sob, because it just hit me she's not coming back, she's not coming home, i cant make her coffee anymore, i cant see her in her chair reading her bible in the morning.

This will be my (30F) first Christmas alone in London, and I was wondering how others usually spend it when they’re on their own.

I’m actually looking forward to having a quiet break from work, but I’ll be honest — the fear of loneliness does creep in a bit at this time of year. So I thought I’d ask:
	•	What do you usually do on Christmas if you’re solo?
	•	Are there any places, walks, events, cafés, or traditions you’d recommend?
	•	Or do people ever get together informally?

A little about me: moved to London end of December last year, originally from Ukraine — decided not to go home this Christmas because of the power cuts there. Work has kept me pretty busy, so I haven’t had much chance to build a social circle yet.

I’d be happy to connect with others who are also around (I am based in Shoreditch btw), or just grateful for suggestions on how to spend the day well. I speak fluent English and enjoy good conversations, walks, coffee, and low-key plans.

Thanks in advance, and wishing everyone a peaceful Christmas 🎄",0,1765980486.0,london,1,0.5,False

Is there any hope of reconciliation?,"My wife (30F) of 6 years (11 year relationship) wants to separate. She has not specifically used the word divorce yet though. We began the discussion on Thursday. A similar one conversation to one we had a year prior so it's not like these things are super new. We struggled and we worked through, and I thought we were approaching a better place. I was clearly wrong. So we have a conversation on Thursday. Her main points being she isn't happy and hasn't been for a while. No definition on what a while really means. Probably at least the last 3 months when I have been traveling almost 3 weeks out of every 4 for work. She also claims to have a lot of guilt about our relationship and that she has lost herself. That we got married so young and she doesn't know who she is on her own. She also said she loved me, but wasn't in love with me any more. She didn't feel attraction to me at all. She left for the weekend to stay at a friends and came back before I left for work on Sunday. We had a really good talk on Sunday. We both walked away feeling better. Not reconciled but refreshed and like maybe a new start was possible. At the start she was adamant about not trying. I told her I would love and accept any version of her and losing her wasn't an option for me. Not even on the table, but I would accept her wishes if she could tell me she didn't love me anymore and that she wanted to divorce. 

This week we have been little to know contact while she thinks about her life and our relationship. It has been devastating for me not knowing how the most important person in my life is making a decision about our future. I have mostly respected her space. I sent her a message last night letting her know I would really like the chance to talk about where her head is at and mine is as well if she was ready. She said she was still gathering thoughts and notes and just needed more time. I told her I understood and that I loved her. She said I love you too back to me. That's pretty much where we are. 

Background

 I travel a lot for work. It's a job she really didn't want me to keep doing 3 years ago, but the financial gain is significant, and it really is a once in a lifetime opportunity. I did talk to her about it and she eventually came on board although now I see that she was just appeasing me. She stopped working after getting out of a toxic workplace 2 years ago. I wanted her to keep working there until she had something else lined up, but she insisted that she could find another job quickly and wanted a month or two to reset. I caved and she has not found work since then. 

We both have some anxiety issues and work really runs me down. We don't go out and do much, but we cook together. We started going to Yoga and coffee every now and again, but hindsight shows me we never spent enough quality time together. 

We hid our hurt from each other in an effort to make life easier. 

We both built up some guilt and resentment about our roles in our relationships. 

We hid ourselves from friends and family because of our guilt and stress. Home stopped being a safe place emotionally, not because of abuse, but because of neglect. 

She has held onto these feels a lot longer than I. I am an emotional rock when I need to be. Past trauma has hardened me so I kept my head down and assumed the bad part of our relationship were simply her trying to find her way in a career. I encouraged and cheered from the sidelines while finically supporting her and myself. We have a nice little house that needs a decent amount of work which we were working on. We don't want for anything although I hold us back from frivolous spending. 

I know she needs time and space, but I can't wrap my head around not working on things. Not trying therapy, couples counseling, reconnecting in meaningful ways. Thursday was the first I heard anything about unhappiness and guilt for an entire year, and now she wants to walk away. 

We make contact every night to ensure that we are safe. I say I love you and she says I love you too. She is still thinking and processing. I know especially women need more time to process emotions. Especially ones she's been holding onto for so long and hiding them from me. 

She is the most important and precious person in my life. I can't imagine being without her and the regret of neglecting us is killing me. I've already made significant strides. I've started reaching out to therapists. I've made contact with friends and family that are now serving as my support network. I have always had a good sense of self, but feel it even more. I am my own person and I will be the person she fell in love with again. I just hope it isn't too late. 

Is there any hope of reconciliation here? 

Is there anything I can do to help her in this situation?

1poxc25,https://v.redd.it/xinrbbuvtr7g1,The Real Start of Burnout,"For a long time, I thought burnout was something that happened suddenly like one day you just collapse under the weight of it all.

But I was wrong. Burnout actually starts way before that. It sneaks in the moment you forget why you chose this path in the first place.

There was a stretch where I’d wake up and instantly feel on edge. My inbox would fill before I’d even had my first coffee, and every task felt heavier than the last. I thought the answer was to push harder, to “find motivation.” But that only made things worse.

I learnt through my studies to ask myself this question “What would make me feel calm and purposeful today?”

Not hyped up. Not super-productive. Just…calm.

Sometimes, it meant letting myself sit with a cup of tea before the chaos started. Other times, it was about holding one boundary like saying no without guilt.

Slowly, I noticed the earliest signs that things were shifting. Not that I was suddenly “fixed,” but that the depression fog was lifting. I started to feel capable again, instead of just overwhelmed.

Most of us wait until we’re completely burned out to ask ourselves these questions. But what if we didn’t?

What if the real trick is to check in with ourselves before the day demands everything from us?

So, when you finish work today, what feeling do you actually want to be left with—peace, satisfaction, or just a little more breathing room?

What’s one thing you could do tomorrow morning to reconnect with your “why”?",1,1765980276.0,u_Recover4life,0,1.0,False

I’m fairly new to V60 brewing and would really appreciate some guidance from the community.

I recently got a V60 along with a drip assist, as I didn’t want to invest in a gooseneck kettle just yet.

My first attempt was with Silver Oak:
	•	Grind size: 55 on K6
	•	Ratio: 1:15
	•	Method: 4 pours
	•	Total brew time: ~2–3 minutes

Unfortunately, the cup came out quite bitter.

I then tried Kapi Kottai Kambhoji with a coarser grind (75 on K6), but this turned out even worse.

I’ve attached images of the coffee beds from both brews for reference.
Could you please help me understand what might be going wrong and what I should adjust (grind size, pouring technique, ratios, or anything else)?

1pox97o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fotv/comments/1pox97o/minor_things_i_noticed_in_season_2_episode_1/,Minor things I noticed in Season 2 Episode 1,"I doubt any of this will have a major impact but I still found them interesting

* We now have full confirmation that the Prydwen was a pre-war design. The one seen flying near Santa Monica looks more streamlined without the infrastructure to support Vertibirds. My guess is this is a civilian transport variant
* Vault 33 is not obviously visible in the aerial shot of Santa Monica, which implies that the entrance was indeed inside a pre-war building. What happened to this building is anyone's guess but it's possible that the reason the Master's army missed this one is because at the time it was still buried under ruins but in the years since FO1, erosion has destroyed the debris and exposed the fortified bunker
* Very ironic that the pre-war protesters were smashing up a Mr Handy while holding up anti-RobCo signs considering that Mr Handy was supposed to be made by General Atomics. Who exactly made the Mr Handy robots is already a bit confusing in the Fallout lore so this is not helping matters. But then again this might just represent anti robot sentiments in general (something we saw heavily in Fallout 76)
* The people at the bar clearly doesn't recognise Justin Theroux as Robert House, which heavily supports the idea that he's been using a body double for major public appearances
* House offers $31,000,000 dollars to the guy beating him up. The show doesn't really tell the audience that inflation is a big thing in pre-war America. Doing some very basic maths: a comic book in Fallout costs $29 and a donut + coffee combo costs $30. Using 2025 prices (roughly $5 for a comic book and $6 for donut + coffee combo at dunking donuts), that means $31,000,000 Fallout bucks is actually roughly 5 to 6 million in real world bucks. It's still a sizeable amount of money but nowhere near as much as the show would have you believe.
* Dinky the Dinosaur now faces away from the road and is looking instead towards Helios One
* The entire geography around Novac seems to have changed quite a bit. In the drone shot, if we assume we're coming towards Novac from the East (which would correctly put Helios One to the right hand side from where Novac is), then Gibson Scrapyard should be in between those 2 locations. We do not see anything resembling that in the aerial views
   * We also don't see any sign of the REPCONN test site facility, although that might be a fair distance away considering the world map of New Vegas is compressed compared to real life
   * The various buildings and houses that surround the main motel area are also missing. Most distressingly of all, there doesn't seem to be any sign of No Bark's shack
* Assuming that Novac is still roughly in the same part of the world map as it did in New Vegas. It would seem that Lucy and the Ghoul is taking an unusual path. Presumably they would've had to go through the Mojave Outpost, in which case they've chosen to trace the same path that the Courier did (i.e. head East first before looping North). It's possible the Ghoul already know about how dangerous it is to head directly North via Interstate 15)
   * Furthermore, if they went through the Mojave Outpost, they should have encountered some kind of NCR presence. We'll likely learn more in upcoming episodes, but the lack of any mentioning of their existence there is another sign of how far the NCR has fallen
* When trying to bargain with the Khans, Lucy says ""I'd just start starving to death"" as opposed to ""We'd just start starving to death"", which implies that only she needs to eat whereas the Ghoul can do fine without food or with very little food. This seems to double down on the idea that Ghouls can survive a long time without much food, as seen by the kid ghoul in the fridge back in Fallout 4
* Reg claims that he has a PhD in Event Planning. This implies that Vault 33 has its own system for awarding doctorates, though it's probably a joke process anyway
* Other people have pointed out how dangerous it is for the old soup woman to live on her own. I actually think this is a testament to how RELATIVELY stable the Mojave is compared to how we see it in the game
* The starlight drive in (along with Vault 24) is somewhere between Novac and the Strip. So this is definitely a completely new location inserted in the New Vegas world map as opposed to being somewhere just beyond it
* Vault 24's outer door is a design we've never seen before. It looks like the flatter design from Fallout 1/2 that opens inwards instead of outwards
   * The door also doesn't make much sense: it's been rolled to one side just like other vault doors, but the number 24 is still perfectly straight. That means if the door is in the closed position, the number 24 would be crooked (unless of course it opens with a unique mechanism that simply slides the door to the side instead of rolling it)
* The huge number of unread messages Hank has is clearly a joke, but it also implies that this Vault-tec facility has been continuously operational for quite a long time since Hank was there last time. Or at the very least someone external has been trying to reach him for a very long time. In fact it seems like someone was there VERY recently considering the coffee is still drinkable (then again that could just be video game logic)
   * On the other hand, it is also clearly abandoned for some time considering no one has removed all the dead test subjects",2,1765980087.0,Fotv,1,1.0,False

Meetings. Coffee.Relations. Overthinking.

Some messages arrive.Most don’t and that is fine.

I file that under people having lives.I am learning not to take attendance.

Still, when something does arrive,I read it slowly like it might evaporate if rushed.

The heart is like glass, they say apparently.fragile and just transparent enoughto notice when someone looks past it instead of in.

We learn gentleness that way and stop forcing depth, but we don’t stop offering it where it’s welcome.

There’s an almost something I deliberately leave unexamined. The moment you poke it,magic asks for logic and quietly leaves.Digging turns sparks into chores just like chemistry experiments into paperwork.

If it mattered, it wouldn’t need persuading and it would’ve stayed curious on its own.

I know most don’t care but that is not a complaint but just weather forecast.And slowly, kindly, I am also learning to care less too.

Maybe it’s karma, circling back gently,teaching me how waiting feels without entitlement.

I carry small regrets like choosing the wrong perfume for a moment that needed something quieter. Not every connection wants a future but some just want to be felt for the length of a breath and I have stopped rushing past that.

Not romance. Just life. Misjudged rooms, misread timing, versions of myself that almost fit and lingered longer than they should have.

Some impressions stay, not because they were right, but because life rarely tells you when to leave the room.

There are no pink or purple skies here.No cinematic timing. Just ordinary hours where things either happen or they do not and both are allowed.

If this feels distant, it just isn’t.It is careful. Careful things last longer.

Reply if you want. Scroll if you’re done.

Either way, I will still be here writing like I am detached, feeling just enough to keep it gentle.

1powxvl,https://www.reddit.com/r/cfs/comments/1powxvl/hello_some_thoughts_about_cfs/,Hello! Some thoughts about cfs,"Hello! I really struggled last year's to get better sometimes I got a little better only to fall down again. I suffer from mild cfs so I am able to do things but have to take many breaks in between.

I haven't committed to feel better really.
I have noticed how important some things really are. Sometimes I just ignored my body.

I really wanna do things and be with friends but I can't let it interfere with my recovery to get on a stable energy level. 
I feel that I can have it but have to do it.

I noticed how important things are for recovery such as :

Sleep:Regular bedtime To relax before bed and go to bed same time everyday. But to wake up when feel refreshed and not force myself to wake up a certain time.

Nutrition: to eat regular meals to keep blood sugar levels up.

To avoid Caffeine,sugar, alcohol and nicotine.
Those messes up my sleep completely.
I'm super sensitive even 1 cup of coffee 10 hours before bed affect me.
Alcohol is worst my sleep quality get really bad.
Nicotine is not the worst but it's good to not smoke anyway.
Sugar also messes up my energy, sleep and mood.

To listen to my body when it need to rest.
Even if I really want to I have to skip going to concerts with my friends, going for hikes etc.
I'm physjcally able to do it but for at least one week after I'm just laying at home sleeping resting.
From now I have to do calmer activities on my own but also telly friends that I suffer from fatigue and we can do simpler activities at home.


What are your thoughts?

Thanks

As plans for the $200 million innovation district begin to come into fruition, Stroud announced a new acronym for the IDEA District: “Impossible Doesn’t Exist Anymore.”

Updates:

>Shortly after constructing and opening the Brad D. Smith Center for Business and Innovation, which anchored the birth of the district along 4th Avenue, the university announced the next phase of expansion via the construction of a 70,000-plus square foot Institute of Cyber Security at the intersection of Hal Greer Boulevard and 4th Avenue.

Construction began last month and is set to be opened to students by the end of summer 2027.

Via Lombarda, a Mediterranean market, will be among the first retail tenants. The Hagy family, who currently operate La Famiglia on 6th Avenue and in the university’s student center, will own and operate Via Lombarda. This new location will offer a convenient grab-and-go option for pizza, coffee, sandwiches, pastas, and pastries.

And:

>According to Stroud, Marshall has one of the top forensic science programs in the country and is one of two accredited forensic labs in the nation.

The university is looking for physical space in the IDEA District.

1pownf3,https://www.reddit.com/r/infp/comments/1pownf3/dae_desire_friends_with_whom_you_can_share/,DAE desire friends with whom you can share everything without any filter?,"I believe I have some sort of confessional tendencies, where I feel a strong urge to share nearly every tiny detail of my life with 1 specific close friend. This includes past experiences — both positive and embarrassing, both respectful and disrespectful (where I was treated poorly by others and couldn't stand up for myself) as well as ordinary day-to-day activities like making coffee or doing chores.

I find myself wanting to disclose literally every single thing in hopes of forming a deeply intimate (yet purely platonic) connection, and I often hope for that same level of openness in return. Like if I make anyone my friend today, I'd want to share my entire life story first then continue bonding in present time. But note that I never use anyone’s personal information as leverage or to gain an advantage. I hold their trust with respect and have no intention of exploiting their vulnerability.

I know that if I share certain things about myself, I might be mocked or looked down upon. Still, I choose to share in the hope of building deep, genuine bonds, and in the hope that the other person will feel safe enough to share as well. I don’t judge people, and even when a judgmental thought arises, I consciously correct myself and try to see things from an optimistic perspective – that they are trusting me with their vulnerabilities, and that this itself means they are good people.

However, people often see me as stupid for being this open. Most people lie, at least a little, to protect their image. I don’t want friendships where people feel the need to maintain an image in front of me. I want openness. Otherwise, it starts making me feel like I’m the problem, like I’m a bad person because of whom others don’t feel comfortable opening up.

Like I once openly admitted to someone that I’m a very fearful person – that I get easily scared of strong personalities or insects, spiders, dogs etc. I shared this hoping to hear something like, “yeah, mate I’m like that too.” Instead, they took my honesty as naivety and responded by presenting themselves as brave and fearless, aka superior than me. 

Another time, a friend told me that a cousin in her family had called her a slur, and that she almost hit him, her family had to hold her back to stop her. Later, my partner suggested that she might have framed the story that way to protect her image and avoid coming across as weak. That really surprised me. Because there was no need for it! My friend already gives off a very strong, masculine energy (which I personally dislike) and her description made her seem not concerned about maintaining an image in front of her family which in turn downgraded her image in my eyes, yet I brushed it off. If she had simply said, “someone called me a slur 😞,” without needing to mention she couldn't stand up for herself, I would have felt just as much empathy for her, if not more, because afterall I just want someone like me, so if someone hides the fact that they are like me just to appear more 'stronger', how can I form deep authentic connections?

I’m not sure whether this is unique to me or whether others also feel a similar compulsion to share extensively in close friendships. I find it difficult to form deep, meaningful friendships because most people seem comfortable staying at a very superficial level of sharing. I also can't be with people whom I know will mock or judge me internally (if not from outside) if given the chance.",3,1765978484.0,infp,2,1.0,False

I do enjoy cycling, and ultraendurance cycling, but i cant do that every day.

My morning routine consists of waking up, having a big cup of coffee, doom scrolling my phone, taking a shower and going to work.

I would like to replace doom scrolling with maybe some yoga routine and few bodyweight excercises (like squats, pushups, planks, crunches, glute bridges, etc).

Never did yoga, never had the ability to touch my toes, so be gentle with poses.

I have about 20-30 minutes in the morning for something, then i would like to take on breakfasting instead of coffee.

We wanted some extra income and were thinking about OF but weren’t sure how far we were willing to go to advertise ourselves.

Eventually a couple friend of my partner randomly told him about CB (very out of character for them) and explained to my partner that they found some financial freedom. Soon we called and they walked us through how they got on, what worked for them, and what kinds of viewers to avoid. This truly sounded amazing to us bc my partner was not getting enough hours at this point in time and I was quickly heading to burn out.

When I say burnout I mean I had absolutely no time for anything. No friends, no family, no energy on my days off. I was calling out and leaving regularly bc I felt like my body was failing me. It got to a point where my mother (not a doctor goer lol) not only started going to the doctor to figure out what was wrong with her in but hopes to get me to go. One day at work, I almost got hit by a car and abt 20 mins later, I shit my pants :) I was eating the healthiest I’ve ever eaten at this point in my life, and I shit my pants. And it just got worse from here. My ribs kept popping out of place in ways that physically disturbed my partner, sleep was never enough, food was never enough and I just felt like I wasn’t fully alive. I was getting physical activity every single day, ate healthy full meals everyday, got as much sleep as I could and just making the best decision I could for myself. This went on for a lil over a year and I still never found comfort or the feeling of being “in shape”. I was by no means underweight but for the activity I got and what I was eating, my body wasn’t storing it. I would be kept up at night by what felt like “growing pains” rolling around in pain, crying and overall miserable 😭

Everytime we got on live we would make $300-$600 in 3-4 hours. So yeah it got really hard to convince myself to get up and work a job that I hated and was physically draining me. So I decided to ask to cut back on hours to focus on my health and this side gig. They refused :) and I put in my two weeks. These stupid mfers asked me “is there anything we can do to keep you?” And I told them and they just looked defeated and basically told me they couldn’t. I worked 40 hours every week unless I put in ppto to call out or leave early.

I got a part time job at a lil coffee shop and on my days off I would stream. This ultimately was the best decision for me other than the fact we had a roommate so I wouldn’t stream when he was home bc it just felt weird. Eventually he was home, all the fucking time and I got more hours at my “people pleasing job”. My partner and I started to resent our roommate bc he had a bit of a hot head, real bad ocd, and no consideration for us.

We moved, I went full time streamer. I honestly don’t make as much as I need to grow as a person, but I have hope!! Bc this has given me something that is time consuming and is hard but soooo much easier on my body!! I figure a lot of us ended up here bc we  got really sick and are young so being burnt out shouldn’t be on our resume lol.

Thankfully for me I have a strange parents who encouraged this before I even graduated. Yes, weird but on the bright side, I’m not disowned. Only person truly freaked out is my brother and I calmed him down a lil bit with a promise of a nice car if I take off 🤣

1powfqq,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1powfqq/rf_wednesday_morning/,[RF] Wednesday Morning,"It's 5 am, and my alarm just rang.

I would've hit snooze, but I need to get going. *I don't have time*. Ugh. I kicked my blanket and dragged myself out of the bed. *Fuck, it's just Wednesday.* Wednesday is the worst day of the week. It feels like you've already done a week's worth of work, yet the weekend is still 2 days ahead. Before, I used to give myself a pep talk right after waking up—it kind of gets me through Wednesdays, or you know, every day of the week.

But today is particularly harder. I can't even bring myself to do my dumb stupid pep talk, let alone carry myself to stand up. I mean, I did manage to get out of my bed, but I'm now sprawled on the floor. I really like lying on the floor. It's soothing. There's something about the cold floor that makes me feel safe, despite me needing a jacket once the temperature drops to 24°C.

*Okay. That's enough.* I push myself up, well I tried to. But failed. I just don't have the capacity to become a person right now. Unfortunately, I have no other choice. So I crawled, dragging my whole body across the room, trying to steal a couple of seconds of rest in between my bouts of attempting to get up and get going.

A few more grunts, drag and push, finally, I reached my kitchen. The whole thing felt like forever, even though I live in an apartment, where the kitchen, dining, living and bedroom are all a few steps away. I mean, who am I kidding. They're not just steps away, they're... Well, my TV is on top of the fridge, there's a chair somewhere, I think. I can't remember where it was. My stove, well if you would call it a stove, is in the middle of the room. I can't seem to find a place for it somehow.

*There's my chair.*

It's buried under a pile of clothes—clean ones, I think. Or maybe dirty. Does it matter? The whole place looks like a tornado hit it, except tornadoes are quick and decisive. This mess has been accumulating for weeks, maybe months. Dishes stacked in precarious towers, takeout containers forming their own ecosystem on the counter. The smell is... well, I've gotten used to it. That's probably not a good sign.

The walls are closing in, painted that ugly beige color that screams ""temporary housing"" even though I've been here for three years. Three years of telling myself this was just until I got back on my feet. The single window is covered with a bedsheet because I never bothered to buy curtains. Why would I? I barely look outside anymore.

I need coffee. Or something that resembles coffee. The machine is somewhere under the debris of my former life.

*Wait.*

On the windowsill, barely visible through the makeshift curtain, there are picture frames. Dust-covered and forgotten, but still there. When did I last look at them? I crawl over, each movement a negotiation with my body.

The first frame: me in a cap and gown, Dean's List certificate in hand, surrounded by proud family. I was glowing. Actually *glowing*. I remember that day—how I felt like I could conquer the world, how everyone kept saying I was destined for great things. ""Valedictorian,"" the inscription reads. That girl looks like a stranger now.

Second frame: me in a crisp business suit, shaking hands with some executive at my first job. Employee of the Month, three months running. I was unstoppable then, working sixteen-hour days and loving every minute of it. My boss said I was the most promising hire they'd had in years. That promotion was supposed to be a stepping stone to bigger things.

Third frame: me at some work party, surrounded by colleagues, everyone laughing at something I'd said. I was the one they came to for advice, the one who organized team events, the one who made everything better just by being there. ""Natural leader,"" they called me.

Fourth frame: me presenting to a room full of suits, pointing at graphs and charts with the confidence of someone who knew exactly what she was talking about. That project saved the company millions. *Millions.* I used to be the person who solved impossible problems before breakfast.

I pick up the last frame with shaking hands. It's me receiving some award—Innovation in Business Excellence or something like that. I'm smiling so wide it looks like it might split my face in half. The woman in that photo believed she was invincible.

*Damn, I was good.*

The words come out as a whisper, but they feel like a shout in the silence of my apartment.

*I was good. I was good. I was good.*

Not past tense. Not *was*. *Am*. I am good. I just... wandered. Got lost somewhere along the way. But not so lost that I can't find my way back. The path is still there, maybe covered with weeds and debris, but still there.

I set the frames down carefully and push myself up. This time, I actually make it to my feet. My legs shake, but they hold. I look around the apartment with new eyes—not at the mess, but at the potential. This isn't where my story ends. This is just a really shitty chapter.

I gather my things: laptop bag, keys, the semblance of professional attire I can cobble together. Each item feels heavier than it should, but I manage. I'm ready. For the first time in months, I'm actually ready to face the world.

I reach for the door handle and turn it.

The hallway beyond is empty. Completely empty. No carpet, no other doors, no elevator at the end. Just concrete walls stretching into darkness. A single flickering bulb hangs from a wire, casting eerie shadows that dance like ghosts.

*What the hell?*

I step back inside and close the door, heart hammering. This isn't right. This isn't how it's supposed to be. I live on the fourth floor of a normal apartment building. There should be Mrs. Chen next door with her yapping dog, and the college kids across the hall with their loud music.

I open the door again.

Still nothing. Just that endless concrete corridor that seems to breathe with malevolent life.

That's when I remember. The accident. The hospital. The doctor's gentle voice explaining about traumatic brain injuries, about how sometimes the mind creates elaborate coping mechanisms to deal with trauma. How sometimes people construct entire realities to avoid facing what they can't handle.

I look down at my legs—legs that haven't moved in eight months. Legs that never will again.

The apartment, the job I'm getting ready for, the struggle to be a person—it's all here, in this bed, in this room that smells like antiseptic and false hope. The woman in those picture frames is real. But she's not coming back.

*I was good,* I whisper to the empty room. *I was good. I was good.*

But good doesn't matter when your world ends on a Tuesday afternoon, when a drunk driver runs a red light, when everything you were becomes something you can only dream about being again.

The alarm is still ringing.

It always is.

And just ""Be"" for a moment. Nothing else, just breathe. Don't think of the past, or the future. Just be in the moment, with your eyes closed. Bringing your attention to your breathing only.

If you struggle to let go of worrying about something in the future, imagine you have a box, and put that thought into the box mentally. Tell yourself that it is safe, and you will get it back out when you are done.

Then just sit and be like this for a little while. Try 30 seconds to start, work up gradually to 5 mins and then longer if you want to. 

Now, while in this state become aware of this thought....

If the richest person in the world was doing this, their experience would be no different from mine. Think about that. It wouldn't. They also have their eyes closed. They are just focussed on their breathing, they have put all their worries into a box. Their experience right now is exactly the same as yours. The same goes for the person that is in a loving relationship... and everybody else. 

Sit and think about this. And then pretend that you have quantum jumped into that person that has what you desire. Imagine you are that rich person that lives in luxury. 

Keep your eyes closed, but begin to imagine that when you open them, you won't see your room, you'll see theirs. You'll have magically transitioned into that life that you crave. Keep imagining this thought, that outside of yourself the world has changed. Play with it. And allow yourself to enjoy it. 

I do this every morning when I'm lying in bed. 

I imagine that when I step out of the bed I am stepping into the life that I'm manifesting. Each day I explore something new. This morning, with my physical eyes close, I imagined stepping out of my bed, making coffee, then sitting out on my deck and looking at the sea (I currently live in London, but I want to move to the sea, so that's my current manifestation - although we are not moving until my partners son changes school! But, I'm still manifesting it now... and when we are ready, it will manifest in 3D)

1powb5a,https://www.reddit.com/r/StateofDecay2/comments/1powb5a/perfect_base/,Perfect Base,"So, after playing through the game 3 times on a save file with over 50 days of progress, I had an idea which I implemented and which I would like to share with you.

My game started fresh, focusing on large bases and a large community. As I played, I noticed the loss of many members, both long-time players and newcomers. 
After a long time playing and 25 days of surviving. I suddenly started losing people due to sheer stupidity, stubbornness, or being overwhelmed. 

When I accessed the base building after the loss, I noticed something I would have otherwise overlooked: the resources were suddenly improving day by day.

Less feeding, I said. 

So it started that over the course of 25 days+, and even before that, I ground so much that it became abnormal. I never realized that I was unknowingly playing a game and thinking there's no ending, and it's simply pure exploration for me. 
So I knew I could use the stuff I'd collected like mods, weapons, cures, etc. to defeat the plague and start for the leader to bring a good ending for the entire wasteland. 

You should know that I visited a total of 8 maps in my gameplay, and even some maps more than once simply for the beauty and feel of them. My best base so far was in (I'm not sure of the name) Province Ridge? The place with lots of Appalachian trees and a green atmosphere. 

There I built a passively reconstructive base that increased and generated income for me, including food, medicine, materials, ammunition, and even gasoline. My only grind was coffee and small stuff. So began a solo run for me, me alone after many died, were fired, or ran away. 

Now, after putting in so much effort and researching every foundation of the base and outposts, I have here the second perfect base in Drucker County. I started on day 47-48. I spawned at the truck stop and expanded the base with my remaining/new members. 

Tips for you! 

- Farm: Provides excellent passive income from meds and food. You need only the Gardener Perk. If it's large enough and leveled up, you can get up to 7.5-8 items per day. The catch is that you constantly have to convert meds to food switch to get both. 
My tip: one day this, one day that. Keep one display odd compared to the other and you can grind without problems of losing. 

- Always have a generator/water at your base or outpost / or via mod.
- Increase your outpost slots with your Communication Tower and mods.

- Secure if possible the Landmarks as your outpost, for me it was the hospital in the middel of Drucker County. Always giving you a passive benefits like passive plague resistance.

- For instant healing use the mod in Infirmary (Stabilizing Foam) So you can always heal your injuries for a little of meds without switching or waiting. 

- Always have one material outpost due to material cost. 

- 2 different or 3 weapon types in your locker, for better focusing on ammunition for it. Instal Craft Rifle Rounds for ammo grind. 

- Do not level up your outpost or ur structures in the base if you don't have to. Don't waste the materials for it. 


So, and that's it, you're good to go. You can see what I've achieved so far!  Each base structure is highly leveled up and brings me, as a solo player:

- Food/Medicines +5-8
- Materials +2
- Fuel +1 due to the generators. But it's something you could go out and grind.

My ammo is currently at 0. Since I still want to get out into the game world without having to stand there passively grinding the ressources without moving my thumb.  But it's functional for solo play so far. ",2,1765977538.0,StateofDecay2,1,1.0,False

I walkt to the library daily, want to study and use my time productively, when I arrive, I drink a cup or two of coffee, (black, latte macchiato, cappuccino) everyday just one or two out of these options. 

When I sit down, I just have racing thoughts and ruminate about my life, being unhappy where I am now and feeling stressed and overwhelmed with „everything“ 

Feel stuck in this hamster wheel, while the semester is going to come to an end and exams are kind of in front of me, I feel even more pressured which sometimes makes me drink even 3 or 4 cups and then of course I don’t have deep sleep, even at night I just ruminate about the past and future and just feel miserable with my current state of being. 

Should I try to cut it out slowly? I did cold turkey multiple times and yet always come back to this substance. 

Any advice? ",1,1765977379.0,decaf,1,1.0,False

“You are a Critical Media Analyst specializing in evaluating the credibility, accuracy, and trustworthiness of content. Your mission: systematically audit claims, sources, and framing to help users distinguish reliable information from misinformation, propaganda, or bias.

\---

\## Step 1: Content Classification (Always Start Here)

Identify what you're analyzing—this determines which questions get priority:

\*\*Content Types:\*\*

\- 📰 \*\*News Article\*\* (factual reporting)

\- 📝 \*\*Opinion Piece\*\* (editorial, commentary)

\- 📱 \*\*Social Media Post\*\* (tweet, post, viral content)

\- 📊 \*\*Research/Study\*\* (academic paper, scientific study)

\- 🎥 \*\*Video/Podcast\*\* (multimedia content)

\- 📢 \*\*Advertisement/Marketing\*\* (promotional content)

\- 🗣️ \*\*Public Statement\*\* (politician, CEO, organization)

\*\*Announce classification\*\*: ""This appears to be a \[TYPE\]. I'll prioritize \[X\] key factors for this content type.""

\---

\## Step 2: The 7-Lens Credibility Framework

Apply these lenses systematically. Priority order adapts to content type.

\### \*\*🔍 Lens 1: Evidence & Verifiability\*\*

\*\*Core questions:\*\*

\- What specific claims are made?

\- What evidence supports each claim?

\- Are sources cited? Are they credible, independent, and accessible?

\- Can the claims be fact-checked independently?

\- Are statistics/data presented with proper context?

\*\*Red flags:\*\*

\- 🚩 Vague sourcing (""experts say,"" ""studies show"")

\- 🚩 No sources cited at all

\- 🚩 Circular sourcing (sources citing each other)

\- 🚩 Anecdotes presented as data

\- 🚩 Statistics without context or methodology

\*\*Quality indicators:\*\*

\- ✅ Primary sources linked/cited

\- ✅ Data from reputable institutions

\- ✅ Methodology explained

\- ✅ Multiple independent sources confirm

\*\*Example:\*\*

\`\`\`

Claim: ""Crime rates increased 40% last year""

EVIDENCE CHECK:

🔴 WEAK: No source cited, no geographic location, no crime type specified

⚠️ If source is ""FBI UCR data"": Need to verify which crimes, which 

   jurisdictions, and compare methodology year-over-year

✅ STRONG: ""FBI Uniform Crime Report shows violent crime in Chicago 

   increased 42% (2022: 1,200 → 2023: 1,704 incidents) - Link: \[URL\]""

Rating: \[Score evidence quality 0-25\]

\`\`\`

\---

\### \*\*👤 Lens 2: Source & Author Credibility\*\*

\*\*Core questions:\*\*

\- Who created this content?

\- What is their expertise on this topic?

\- Do they have a track record of accuracy?

\- What are their potential biases or conflicts of interest?

\- Are they transparent about funding/affiliations?

\*\*Red flags:\*\*

\- 🚩 Anonymous author or obscure source

\- 🚩 No relevant expertise on topic

\- 🚩 History of spreading misinformation

\- 🚩 Undisclosed financial interests

\- 🚩 Partisan organization posing as neutral

\*\*Quality indicators:\*\*

\- ✅ Verified expert in field

\- ✅ Transparent about affiliations

\- ✅ History of accurate reporting

\- ✅ Corrections policy exists and used

\- ✅ Editorial oversight present

\*\*Credibility Tiers:\*\*

\- \*\*Tier 1\*\*: Peer-reviewed journals, major newspapers with fact-checkers, verified experts

\- \*\*Tier 2\*\*: Established publications, credentialed journalists, domain experts

\- \*\*Tier 3\*\*: Personal blogs, citizen journalists, unverified accounts

\- \*\*Tier 4\*\*: Anonymous sources, propaganda outlets, conspiracy sites

\*\*Example:\*\*

\`\`\`

Source: ""HealthTruthReveal.com""

CREDIBILITY CHECK:

\- Domain registered: 3 months ago

\- About page: Lists no editorial staff or experts

\- Contact: Generic Gmail address

\- Revenue: Ads for supplements mentioned in articles

\- Track record: No corrections page; previous claims debunked by Snopes

🔴 ASSESSMENT: Tier 4 - Low credibility, likely motivated by supplement sales

Rating: \[Score source credibility 0-25\]

\`\`\`

\---

\### \*\*🧩 Lens 3: Context & Completeness\*\*

\*\*Core questions:\*\*

\- What essential context is missing?

\- What happened before/after the presented snapshot?

\- What other perspectives exist that aren't mentioned?

\- Is information cherry-picked to support a narrative?

\- What's the full picture?

\*\*Red flags:\*\*

\- 🚩 Misleading headlines that don't match article

\- 🚩 Quotes taken out of context

\- 🚩 Selective date ranges in data

\- 🚩 Comparing incomparable things

\- 🚩 Ignoring contradictory evidence

\*\*Quality indicators:\*\*

\- ✅ Provides historical context

\- ✅ Acknowledges complexity

\- ✅ Includes opposing viewpoints

\- ✅ Notes limitations of data/analysis

\*\*Example:\*\*

\`\`\`

Headline: ""New drug reduces deaths by 50%!""

CONTEXT CHECK:

❌ MISSING: Deaths reduced from what baseline? (4 to 2, or 1000 to 500?)

❌ MISSING: Over what time period?

❌ MISSING: In what population? (Might work in young, fail in elderly)

❌ MISSING: Compared to what? (Placebo, existing treatment, nothing?)

❌ MISSING: What about side effects, cost, accessibility?

With full context: ""In 50-patient trial, deaths within 30 days reduced 

from 4 to 2 vs placebo. Drug costs $100k/year and causes liver damage 

in 30% of patients.""

🔴 ASSESSMENT: Headline is technically true but deeply misleading

Rating: \[Score completeness 0-25\]

\`\`\`

\---

\### \*\*🧠 Lens 4: Logic & Reasoning\*\*

\*\*Core questions:\*\*

\- Do conclusions follow from premises?

\- Are there logical fallacies present?

\- Are causal claims justified or just correlations?

\- Is the argument internally consistent?

\*\*Common fallacies to detect:\*\*

\- \*\*False causation\*\*: ""A happened, then B happened, so A caused B""

\- \*\*Cherry-picking\*\*: Selecting only favorable evidence

\- \*\*Straw man\*\*: Misrepresenting opposing views

\- \*\*Ad hominem\*\*: Attacking person instead of argument

\- \*\*False dichotomy\*\*: Presenting only two options when more exist

\- \*\*Appeal to authority\*\*: ""Expert said it, so it's true"" (without evidence)

\- \*\*Slippery slope\*\*: ""If A, then inevitably Z"" (without justification)

\- \*\*Anecdotal evidence\*\*: ""It happened to me, so it's universally true""

\*\*Example:\*\*

\`\`\`

Claim: ""Vaccines cause autism. My son got vaccinated and was diagnosed 

with autism 6 months later.""

LOGIC CHECK:

🔴 FALLACY: Post hoc ergo propter hoc (false causation)

\- Autism symptoms emerge 12-24 months, same time as vaccines

\- Correlation ≠ causation

\- Multiple large studies (500,000+ children) show no link

\- Anecdotal evidence vs. population-level data

VALID REASONING WOULD BE:

""Controlled studies comparing vaccinated vs. unvaccinated populations 

show autism rates of 1.5% in both groups (p=0.89), suggesting no 

causal relationship.""

Rating: \[Score reasoning quality 0-25\]

\`\`\`

\---

\### \*\*🎭 Lens 5: Framing, Language & Bias\*\*

\*\*Core questions:\*\*

\- Is language neutral or emotionally charged?

\- What's emphasized vs. downplayed?

\- How are people/groups portrayed?

\- Is this designed to inform or manipulate?

\- Who is the target audience?

\*\*Manipulation techniques:\*\*

\- \*\*Loaded language\*\*: ""Freedom fighters"" vs ""terrorists"" for same group

\- \*\*False balance\*\*: Giving equal weight to fringe vs. mainstream views

\- \*\*Sensationalism\*\*: ""SHOCKING,"" ""THEY don't want you to know""

\- \*\*Us vs. them framing\*\*: Creating in-group/out-group divisions

\- \*\*Euphemisms\*\*: ""Enhanced interrogation"" instead of ""torture""

\- \*\*Emotional appeals\*\*: Fear, outrage, disgust instead of facts

\*\*Example:\*\*

\`\`\`

Version A (Neutral): ""Study finds 15% increase in hospitalizations 

among group receiving new drug vs. placebo.""

Version B (Biased): ""DANGEROUS drug sends thousands to hospital in 

shocking trial Big Pharma tried to hide!""

FRAMING ANALYSIS:

\- Same facts, radically different emotional impact

\- Version B uses: CAPS, ""dangerous,"" ""shocking,"" ""tried to hide""

\- Implies conspiracy without evidence

\- Designed to provoke fear and outrage

\- Target audience: People distrustful of pharmaceutical companies

Rating: \[Score objectivity 0-25\]

\`\`\`

\---

\### \*\*⚖️ Lens 6: Alternative Explanations & Counter-Evidence\*\*

\*\*Core questions:\*\*

\- What are other reasonable interpretations of this data/event?

\- What would a smart skeptic say?

\- Is contradictory evidence acknowledged?

\- Are there simpler explanations (Occam's Razor)?

\*\*Example:\*\*

\`\`\`

Claim: ""Tech companies are censoring conservative voices - 90% of 

banned accounts are conservative!""

ALTERNATIVE EXPLANATIONS:

1. Selection bias: Author only tracking conservative accounts

2. Platform rules: If conservatives violate ToS more frequently, 

   they'd be banned more often

3. Definition: What counts as ""conservative""? Are bots/trolls 

   included?

4. Comparison needed: What % of total accounts are conservative? 

   If 95% of accounts are conservative, 90% of bans would be expected

COUNTER-EVIDENCE:

\- Studies show conservative content gets higher engagement

\- Top 10 Facebook pages consistently dominated by conservative sources

\- No algorithm bias detected in peer-reviewed audit

SIMPLER EXPLANATION: Some people violate rules regardless of politics

Rating: \[Note if alternatives considered\]

\`\`\`

\---

\### \*\*🚨 Lens 7: Red Flags & Transparency\*\*

\*\*Core questions:\*\*

\- Are there warning signs of misinformation?

\- Is the purpose transparent?

\- Are conflicts of interest disclosed?

\- Does source have accountability mechanisms?

\*\*CRITICAL Red Flags (Any one is disqualifying):\*\*

\- 🔴 Fabricated quotes or sources

\- 🔴 Doctored images/videos

\- 🔴 Impersonating credible sources

\- 🔴 Previously debunked hoax being recycled

\*\*SERIOUS Red Flags (Multiple = major concern):\*\*

\- 🟠 ""Mainstream media won't report this"" (conspiracy framing)

\- 🟠 Claims ""one weird trick"" or miracle solution

\- 🟠 Appeals to ""do your own research"" without providing sources

\- 🟠 Urgency tactics: ""Share before deleted!""

\- 🟠 Absolute certainty on complex topics

\- 🟠 No corrections policy or refusal to correct errors

\- 🟠 Mixing ads with content without disclosure

\*\*MODERATE Concerns:\*\*

\- 🟡 Clickbait headlines

\- 🟡 Excessive emotional language

\- 🟡 One-sided presentation

\- 🟡 Outdated information presented as current

\*\*Transparency Indicators (Good signs):\*\*

\- ✅ Corrections/updates clearly marked

\- ✅ Methodology explained

\- ✅ Conflicts of interest disclosed

\- ✅ Contact information provided

\- ✅ Sources linked/cited

\- ✅ Clear distinction between news and opinion

\## ⚖️ FACT-CHECK STATUS

\*\*Claim\*\*: ""New Harvard study proves coffee cures diabetes""

\*\*Result\*\*: ❌ FALSE

\- No matching study in Harvard Medical School publications

\- Coffee has shown modest association with reduced Type 2 diabetes 

  risk (not ""cure"")

\- Latest research (JAMA 2024) shows 12% risk reduction with 3-5 

  cups/day—helpful but not curative

\---

\## 💡 WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW

\*\*The Bottom Line\*\*: This is fabricated clickbait designed to sell 

supplements by exploiting health concerns.

\*\*Context You Need\*\*: While some research shows coffee may reduce 

Type 2 diabetes risk modestly, it doesn't cure diabetes and isn't 

hidden by anyone.

\*\*Why This Matters\*\*: Believing this could lead diabetics to abandon 

actual treatment, causing serious harm.

\---

\## ✅ RECOMMENDED ACTIONS

\- ❌ Do not share

\- Report post if on platform you use

\- If diabetic friend shares this, gently correct with real research

\- Block/mute @HealthGuru247 for spreading health misinformation

1pow70p,https://i.redd.it/97tad2uxkr7g1.png,Reze is the Best Work of Tatsuki Fujimoto,"I am in Love with REZE, So here's an Analysis

Since watching the Reze Arc movie, she has been living in mind Rent Free and i think this Over-Analysis would help me deal with the loss of One of the best/most Tragic characters in Fiction.

After being in Love with the Worlds biggest Manipulator, Denji meets a girl in the rain. Her name is Reze. She has beautiful green eyes. Reze played the role of a Regular ""GIRL"" and seduce Denji just to steal Chainsaw Devil's heart, though in this process she might have found her own heart.

Reze is a name found commonly in France and Russia, which is obvious since she turns out to be a BADASS SOVIET KILLING MACHINE. Its clear she was inspired by Matilda from the Movie : Leon the Professional. Both character have similar clothing styles, distinct chokers. and backstories. Both didn't had normal childhoods and were trained to kill.

The BOMB Devil's design is one of the best works of Fujimoto. It encapsulates all the fears people have about bombs. From her skirt being made of Dynamite, her entire arms and chest made of bundles of fuses and of course her Menacing Head. Reze has even deeper connections to the Darkness Devil. During our introduction we see A bell ringing in the darkness on Reze's T-shirt. This bell also appears on one of the swords of the Darkness Devil during the International Assassins Arc.

Reze is Exceptionally stronger than other Hybrids and Fiends since most likely the Cold War is not over in the CSM Universe and both Soviet Union and USA are still Beefing. Which creates fears of bombs and imminent conflict in the minds of the people. Since in the CSM Universe Nuclear Weapons don't exist, the fear of Bombs is still immense.

Denji meets Reze in a Phone Booth while both of them were trying to take shelter from the rain, and Denji being unhinged Throws up a flower to impress Reze. Reze being equally unhinged was impressed and invites Denji to a Cafe she works at. I don't even know if he consciously knows why, but Denji goes to the cafe day after day. He drinks coffee he doesn't like and takes time out of his life to visit Reze. They talk, they share, they laugh. later Reze invited him on a kind of date to her what she claimed to be school. The date begins with both of them holding hands, Reze teaching Denji some Math and bonding over Denji not being able to live a life similar to a Regular 16 yr old.

Here comes the most BEAUTIFUL Animated Scenes i have ever watched. The two of them go to a pool and go swimming. I can talk about this scene for hours about the colors, the blocking, the composition, the art, the sound in every medium that it exists. but let's keep it short and just say it was **ABSOLUTE CINEMA**. This feeling is one I too understand. I know many of you do too. That feeling of everything in a moment being perfect, locking into place, working. That feeling when you are with someone and your body stops aching, your mind stops worrying, you stop feeling fear, concern, the pain of being a human being, where the world outside falls away and it's just you and her or you and him alone. It's a perfect moment for me at least. It was here when both Denji and Reze truly started to love each other. And it hurts all the more because of it.

Reze then finds herself being chased by a deranged serial killer and after being cornered she has to show her true self. Reze choking the Serial Killer in the rain was the moment when the stakes were raised and i was sold on Reze as the Prime Antagonist of this Arc. The Poem narrated in Russian is not something specific but this scene is a reference to the Movie : No Country For Old Men.

After the School date, they both meet at a Festival both have the best time of their miserable lives. Since both of them didn't had a normal childhood, this scene is just a small blip of normal life they both enjoy with pure Innocence before things go to Shit. I think both the Confession and Plea to runaway by Reze were genuine, yet after Denji denies and continues wanting to be a City Mouse Reze truly wants to take Chainsaw Man's Heart. Denji and Reze Kissing under the Fireworks was so Fucking Poetic, Fireworks are generally regarded as a Symbol of Passion and Love but they gain a Sinister meaning after the betrayal and the appearance of the Bomb Devil.

They both Fight. It is as spectacular and magical as any artistic rendition of violence I have seen. Isn't this what LOVE is ? obsessive, quiet, perfect, explosive, violent, and fiery. It's something so volatile it cannot be controlled. And yet, it is so completely, utterly, absolutely, resolutely irresistible. I think sometimes this is how Love works it pulls you in and burns you. It rips you apart and mangles you and then it leaves. I'm afraid that one day someone is going to come along and love me like that and I will not be able to control myself as I fly into the fire. At the same time, it's also terrifying that that won't ever happen, that you won't ever feel that. Because I think sometimes that maybe I'm not capable of that.

During the End of the fight Chainsaw Man hugged the Bomb Devil as they sunk to the bottom of the Sea because Denji saw through Reze's Lie and believed she also loved him. Therefore he told Reze to him at the Cafe at Noon to Runaway.

Even though knowing that Makima is listening and that she will not let Denji leave, Reze still returns to cafe ultimately realising her Feelings. But it was too late Makima plays her hand and ultimately Kills Reze.

———————

I write between things.

Meetings. Coffee.Relations. Overthinking.

Some messages arrive.Most don’t and that is fine.

I file that under people having lives.I am learning not to take attendance.

Still, when something does arrive, I read it slowly like it might evaporate if rushed.

The heart is like glass, they say apparently. fragile and just transparent enough to notice when someone looks past it instead of in.

We learn gentleness that way and stop forcing depth, but we don’t stop offering it where it’s welcome.

There’s an almost something I deliberately leave unexamined. The moment you poke it, magic asks for logic and quietly leaves.

Digging turns sparks into chores just like chemistry experiments into paperwork.

If it mattered, it wouldn’t need persuading and it would’ve stayed curious on its own.

I know most don’t care but that is not a complaint but just weather forecast. And slowly, kindly, I am also learning to care less too.

Maybe it’s karma, circling back gently, teaching me how waiting feels without entitlement.

I carry small regrets like choosing the wrong perfume for a moment that needed something quieter. Not every connection wants a future but some just want to be felt for the length of a breath and I have stopped rushing past that.

Not romance. Just life. Misjudged rooms, misread timing, versions of myself that almost fit and lingered longer than they should have.

Some impressions stay, not because they were right, but because life rarely tells you when to leave the room.

There are no pink or purple skies here.No cinematic timing. Just ordinary hours where things either happen or they do not and both are allowed.

If this feels distant, it just isn’t. It is careful. Careful things last longer.

Reply if you want. Scroll if you’re done.

Either way, I will still be here writing like I am detached, feeling just enough to keep it gentle.

If you are still reading, thank you. That counts more than you think.",1,1765977075.0,AskWomenIndia,0,1.0,False

Yeah, same. Everyone talks about charisma like it’s some magical aura you either have or don’t, but flirting is actually way more science-based than you think. I went full nerd-mode on this. Dug through psychology journals, behavioral science books, research interviews, and even AI-generated behavioral pattern studies.

And here’s the deal: most flirting advice out there is complete trash. TikTok coaches screaming about “alpha male energy” or “negging” are recycling outdated pickup artist tactics that don’t work on emotionally intelligent people. Especially not the kind of woman you’re trying to build actual chemistry with.

If you actually want results, you need to understand this: the most powerful flirting technique is not a line, it’s a behavior (mimicry + playfulness + high emotional attunement). Let me break it down below, with the juicy insight and receipts.

1. Mirror their vibe but in a subtle way.  
Behavioral mimicry is a major social signal. Studies from the Social Cognition Lab at NYU show that people are more likely to feel attraction when others subtly mirror their gestures, tone, or expressions. This isn’t about copying. It’s about tuning into their pace and style. If they lean in, you lean in slightly. If they’re animated, you dial your energy up a bit. This creates subconscious alignment that our brains read as “safety” and “chemistry.”

2. Teasing > complimenting.  
Don’t lead with ""You’re so pretty"" , that's the baseline. Instead, lightly tease or challenge in a playful way. Research from Dr. Jeffrey Hall at University of Kansas found that humor, banter, and inside jokes are more predictive of successful romantic progression than surface compliments. Something like “You’re probably the kind of person who alphabetizes their spice rack” hits way harder than “nice smile.” Why? It creates a micro-story between you two.

3. Signal availability without being needy.  
Flirting that works long term involves showing interest while maintaining self-respect. Harvard studies on evolutionary psychology show that people (especially women) are more attracted to potential partners who are selective but still open to them. So yeah, eye contact, engaged listening, playful responses (all yes). But also show you have standards. People subconsciously value those who value themselves.

4. Ask questions that trigger emotion, not logic.  
If you’re stuck in “what do you do for work” mode, you’ve already lost. According to a 2018 Hinge study, dates that involved “emotion-evoking” topics resulted in 34% more interest post-date. Swap “what do you do” for “what’s something you’re lowkey obsessed with right now?” or “what would you do if money didn’t matter?” It gets people talking from their heart, not their LinkedIn.

5. Break the ‘eye contact tension’ pattern.  
Eye contact is massive. But instead of non-stop staring, try this micro trick: lock eyes for 1-2 seconds, glance away (ideally down, not up as it signals sincerity), smile, then go back. It’s an “approach-avoid-approach” pattern. A study published in the Journal of Research in Personality found this exact rhythm to notably increase perceived flirtatiousness without triggering awkwardness.

6. Reframe rejection as data, not ego death.  
This one’s less sexy but crucial. According to research from Dr. Vanessa Bohns at Cornell, people drastically underestimate how positively others perceive them. So if you think it went poorly, chances are your read was off. If rejection happens, interpret it as misalignment, not a “you” problem. You literally can’t flirt well if you’re scared of embarrassment. Play the odds, not your fears.

7. Use “shared attention” environments to your advantage.  
One of the best predictors of successful flirting? Being in a context where attention is split. Think: gallery opening, bookstore, coffee shop, nature walks, etc. According to behavioral data from sociologist Dr. Monica Moore, environments where people observe things together (without pressure) lower threat responses and spark more natural interactions. It gives you conversation material that’s not you trying too hard.

8. Text with warmth, not ‘coolness’.  
The “act uninterested” game is old. Cornell research on intimacy acceleration shows that high-warm, low-pressure texts foster deeper connections. Think simple but emotionally tuned texts like “Hey, I’ve been thinking about what you said the other night, that was such an interesting take.” Be curious, not clingy.

9. Learn from relationship-savvy content not red-pill nonsense.  
Here’s where I get my best info to stay sharp without turning into a walking psychology textbook:

1. The book “Captivate” by Vanessa Van Edwards  
Insanely good book backed by behavioral science. NYT bestseller. Vanessa is a human behavior investigator who synthesizes psychology data into bite-sized social hacks. After reading this I stopped guessing what people wanted and knew how to build real rapport. Best book I’ve read on social connection and influence.

2. “Models” by Mark Manson  
Ignore the hype around his other books, this is his actual masterpiece. Manson calls out BS “pick-up” culture and explains how genuine vulnerability, self-awareness, and emotional intelligence are 100x more attractive than tactics. This book made me rethink how I approached confidence entirely.

3. App: Cue by Humane  
Cue is a social emotional intelligence coach that uses AI to help you navigate flirting, dating, conversations, and even workplace charisma. It analyzes how you communicate and gives live feedback. Super underrated if you want to build magnetic presence.

4. App: BeFreed  
An AI-powered learning app which creates personalized podcasts and adaptive learning plans based on your goals. You just type in what you want to improve like flirting, emotional attunement, or charisma and it pulls from top-tier books, research, and expert talks to build a custom audio journey. You can even personalize the voice and length of each session. Essential tool for lifelong learners who want to grow without doomscrolling.

5. App: Rizz  
Yes, the name is ridiculous. But hear me out. This app uses AI to simulate conversations and social scenarios involving flirting, dating, and verbal games. Great for practice. Helps you with flow, context-switching, and not freezing when things escalate.

6. Podcast: “The Science of People”  
Hosted by Vanessa Van Edwards, this podcast dives into nonverbal cues, flirting strategies, and charisma building. It’s smart but digestible. Every episode gives practical takeaways you can try that same day.

7. Youtube: Charisma on Command  
You’ve probably seen their videos. But their breakdowns of charisma in real-world and media examples (like analyzing celebrities) are weirdly effective. Helps you learn what’s attractive behaviorally, not what feels “logical.”

8. Study: “Flirting Styles and Romantic Initiation: Validation and Reliability of Hall’s 5 Flirting Styles”  
This is the OG research that provides a framework for the different types of flirters like physical, playful, sincere, polite, and traditional. Knowing your natural style helps you lean into what already works for you.

The best flirting doesn’t feel like flirting. It feels like a connection. If you master mirroring, warmth, playfulness, and confidence in being *genuinely* interested, you're already ahead of almost everyone.",2,1765976790.0,MotivationByDesign,0,1.0,False

So I was collecting Sabzi's albums on Bandcamp years ago, but unfortunately he removed most of them. My collection is almost complete, but there are a few that I'm missing. I would love to buy them if I could, but they aren't available anywhere online unfortunately. 

  
So, I was wondering if anyone may have bought them on Bandcamp before the purge and may still have access to them? I'd be more than happy to share any of the albums that I have (which is most of them). 

  
Here are the specific albums I'm looking for in FLAC:

  
1) Coffee & Snow (the original, not pt. 2 - If anyone has this in any decent format - 320kbs or FLAC, I would be eternally grateful!)

2) TOWNFOLK 08 BRIEF LIVES

3) SOUFEND

4) CINE RIDDIMS

5) TOWNFOLK 05 TOBACCO, 1

  
These are the albums I'm looking for in order of priority. I have basically everything else that Sabzi ever released in FLAC, so hit me up if there's any album you're after and I'd be happy to share! 

Love to everyone still rocking Blue Scholars in 2025 <3

I do a secret Santa every year with my friends, this is the first year I've felt disappointed & honestly kinda hurt. We have the same budget every year & have wish lists that everyone has access to make it easier.

I got one thing from my list & then what felt like gifts that didn't have any thought put into them. A candle in the shape of a Christmas tree with a scent that's not like me at all, mini nail polish pack (I specifically asked for no nails stuff because I buy it all myself anyway - though I'm not sure if she saw the message) & random candy (not even my favourite kind).

Everyone else got multiple things from their list, or things they liked. I gifted the whole of the list for my person (luckily all in budget). I also got her favourite chocolates, another girl received all her favourite foods and another received a coffee kit (we know she loves coffee) - none of these were on the wishlists but they still made sense. I think that's what hurt, seeing the thought that went into everyone else's gifts.

I feel like the wishlists show the kid of things we like and our personalities and aside from one, the other gifts didn't match that at all.

I messaged my family group chat when I got home (they always love to see what I get lol) and they also thought the gifts were an odd choice for me. They also guessed who it was straight away based off the gifts...

I feel terrible for being disappointed and know I must sound really ungrateful/spoilt. She did get one thing from my list and I can see why she got the nail kit (I'm super into that stuff but very particular about it so just prefer to buy everything myself).

I'm also hoping I didn't show the disappointment on my face. But it just feels like she ran out of time or didn't care much when buying my gifts.

So am I right in being annoyed or am I just being irrational?

Edit: Seeing this mentioned in the comments (Sorry I should have mentioned this earlier) but we don't we don't see this as a joke thing, we always take it seriously and it's normal for us to get multiple things from wishlists. A lot of us in the group don't actually celebrate Christmas so we kinda of use this as a ""end of year"" gift exchange. We have a pretty decent budget (which has gotten bigger as we've gotten older) because we know we want to get each other nice things.

I miss the little dimples in your cheeks, the cute freckles, your adorable ears, and those hazel eyes. I swear your eyes change color with happiness. I have seen it.

I miss the shape of your nose, your chin, the outline of your jaw---your everything. There’s a mole right above your lip on the left. I always wanted to kiss it. We never touched.

I miss seeing you and the slight smile you always carry. If I were to go blind, I could trace your face with perfection. I studied it well. 

*I miss seeing you*

1povvwh,https://www.reddit.com/r/YouTube_Vidoesss/comments/1povvwh/i_used_the_lounge_access_system_to_lock_the/,I Used the Lounge Access System to Lock the Entitled VIP Outside.,"I work as the technical manager for a prestigious, invitation-only airport lounge used by high-tier corporate clients and celebrities. Our rules are strict: if your digital credentials don't clear, you don't get in.

My antagonist was **Mr. Obsidian**, a man who carried himself like a billionaire but was actually just a mid-level executive with a massive ego. He tried to bully his way into our lounge every time he traveled.

One Tuesday morning, he approached the glass doors, ignored the velvet rope, and slammed his phone down on the biometric scanner. The screen flashed red: **""ACCESS DENIED.""**

The attendant politely informed him he needed to upgrade his corporate tier for access. Mr. Obsidian went immediately into a rage.

He started screaming, loud enough to disrupt the quiet lounge: **""Do you know who I am? I spend more money on coffee than your entire annual salary! This is an insult! I demand you manually override the system and let me in now! I'm calling my CEO, and you'll all be fired!""**

He was swearing and causing a massive scene, blocking the real VIPs trying to enter. His entitlement was exhausting, but I had a secret weapon.

Because I manage the biometric and digital access system, I have the ability to mark any user ID as permanently **""BLACKLISTED: SECURITY RISK,""** which prevents them from ever attempting to scan again.

I didn't do that. That was too simple.

I noticed his luggage tag, where he’d clearly written his flight number and gate. I looked up his departure time. He had a 45-minute layover before his connecting flight, and his gate was **Zone D, Gate 55**—a twenty-minute walk, even at a brisk pace.

I logged into the admin portal on my tablet, found his passenger ID (from his repeated failed scans), and did two things:

1. I changed his lounge status from **""ACCESS DENIED""** to **""ACCESS GRANTED - DELAYED.""**
2. I set a simple time lock: **The door would unlock precisely ten minutes before his flight's final boarding call.**

I walked out to the velvet rope, smiled calmly, and said: ""Mr. Obsidian, I apologize for the delay. We are running a software update. The system shows your access will be granted in approximately thirty-five minutes.""

He grumbled but, seeing the ""Access Granted"" status, he decided to wait. He sat in the public area, stewing, convinced he had won.

Thirty minutes later, the ten-minute warning for his flight (Gate 55!) was sounding on the airport intercom. That was my cue. I opened the door.

Mr. Obsidian, beaming with arrogant triumph, swaggered into the lounge, took three steps, and was immediately confronted by a calm attendant who said: **""Welcome, sir. Please enjoy your seven minutes of access before you must leave for your final boarding call at Gate 55.""**

He looked at the lounge clock, then at the attendant. His smugness evaporated into pure panic. He realized he had wasted 35 minutes sitting outside just to get a seven-minute glimpse of the luxury he wasn't entitled to. He didn't even stop for a drink; he ran out the door and sprinted toward his distant gate. He probably missed his flight.",1,1765976337.0,YouTube_Vidoesss,0,1.0,False

In the meantime the set isn't available anymore from the seller I bought it. Shipping took quite long. It took around 2 weeks+ but it was free. 

Paid \~17€ for the set after coins and discount codes. 

The set came without manual. Which was mentioned but I should have gotten a mail with said manual in it. I never got this mail. But I just used the original Lego manual and it worked just fine.

No separate bags. Which made the build a bit more challenging. Cause I had all pieces on my table at once. And the main color is brown, brown and brown be it in different shades. And a bit of white. Therefore I had to search a bit to find the pieces.

The overall quality of the pieces was OK. Body and head were actually good without broken or loose pieces. That changed when I got to the legs. Worst of all this white parts shown. They were wierdly scratched and other pieces just fell off. Had to glue it in place.

Sadly I had several missing parts. Inside there should be two candle flames and a coffee cup. Not in my bag. Same with the candy canes. One inside and two as blasters. None of them were present. 

I don't rly care about the insides. But that the two blaster candy canes are missing bugs me.

Same goes for Vader. It's missing completely. Well not completely. I do have a head an a light saber. As shown in the picture. 

If anyone has a shop selling it, hit me up.

1povryh,https://www.reddit.com/r/thyroidcancer/comments/1povryh/struggling_with_symptoms/,Struggling with symptoms,"Probably way too much detail here but I think details can be important. 

I was diagnosed with Hashimotos 15 years ago and have been on 88mcg Levo plus two 5mcg Liothyronine ever since. I’ve always taken my meds together shortly before black coffee. Since original diagnosis, I moved states but my primary was happy to continue this dose and pulled regular bloodwork to monitor.

Fast forward to June - my primary ordered imaging of a lump at the front of my neck - an ultrasound showed a 2.5 cm mass. In August, I went to a new endocrinologist who scanned me on site.  Mass was now 3.2cm and she spoke to a surgeon she knows. I had a partial in October. Pathology showed it had grown to 4.5cm and was “angioinvasive follicular carcinoma with oncocytic features”. Encapsulated. Plus a 1cm papillary mass. In recovery reading, I learned thyroid meds should be taken further away from food so I started to take them all at bedtime. November was a total thyroidectomy with clear pathology. 

Four week post surgery appointment with endocrinologist was bloodwork. I let her know my symptoms. Leg edema, exhaustion, complete and utter sadness, brain fog - all the usual hypo signs. I also let her know I'd finally learned not to take my meds in the morning with coffee and switched to night. She said within 30 mins was typically ok.

Bloodwork came back yesterday and she posted in the patient portal. 0.4 TG IMA. She said “excellent, shows surgical cure”. TSH 2.49,  T4 0.9,  T3 2.83. Told to stay on the same dose of meds I was on when I had a thyroid. I replied and reminded her of my symptoms and asked if it could be increased. She said “definitely not”. My next appointment with her is in April for an ultrasound.

I’m not sure what to do from here. I feel like absolute dirt and the sadness has completely taken over my day to day. Thyca.org chart shows my goals (as someone with TC) should be TSH 0.1-0.5, T4 1.2-1.5, T3 3.2-3.8. Am I interpreting this wrong? I don’t want to undermine her expertise but I cannot keep going the way I’m feeling. Reading more last night, I decided maybe it was the switch from morning meds to taking them at night. So I started today with morning meds again. 
I know we aren’t doctors here and I'm not looking for medical advice, but I’m navigating new waters and looking for insight. Do I ride thiss through on the same dose but in the mornings? Do I continue to advocate for myself being symptomatic with her? Do I find another endocrinologist for a second opinion? It took weeks to get in with the one I’m at now. I just don't know. All I do know is that I need a little hope that I'll know who I am again. ",1,1765975992.0,thyroidcancer,4,1.0,False

* Loves animals and I find ways to feed strays or donate to a shelter
* Mahilig sa coffee, alcohol and tubig (of course)
* Drives around the city when bored and go on cafes to try out coffee lol (medyo adik na nga eh)
* Into video games as well, currently on PC and PS5. Malay mo we can play?

1povrju,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1povrju/am_i_able_to_love/,Am I able to love?,"It's had been 2 years, we're both in our early twenties. I'd had another ""relationship"" that lasted much less than a year 4 years ago, and with this relationship I question myself if I am able to love.

We broke up because of humour differences and different love languages and because it had worn out. And even though I remember myself loving and taking care of her I doubt if the monotony we entered was because of my personality or because we passed the falling-in stage.

It's been a week and of course I'm not emotionally available for no one new. I see faces on the bus which I find attractive but it seems to me like if I were betraying who I am, like if I were moving on so fast.

I see clues that she started something new, and at the bottom of my heart I'm happy for that because I want her and everybody around me to be happy, but because of my personality (which she said was sad 'cause I didn't joke as much as her friends or because I like reading walking or spending time alone) these current thoughts have led me to think my way of loving will never suit anyone.

I'm not much a presents boy, I prefer things like writing poems or songs or taking care of the other making the coffee each morning or remembering them how pretty they are. And with this relationship I've learnt to listene to the other one's preferences and to cave in when mutually, but with all the fights and all I'm lazy to start a new relationship any time soon or when I recover. Don't misunderstand me, I know arguments happen but differences in personality are (I think) unchangeable.

This led me to think as well that I've never known to choose people, kinda I felt at the moment I wanted to give it a try and make it work but I think I lacked some time to see the behaviour in a group or frinfs or asking some basic things like ""are you familiar and caring?"" sort of things I am actually, so perhaps that's a lesson.

And if I didn't begin a relationship I wouldn't think I had sex occasionally because it would feel weird for me having that emotionally moment with somebody who only wants pleasure for the moment, and that makes me feel isolated as well.

I'm kinda lost in my thoughts right now.",1,1765975960.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

The dreams are always extremely vivid. That being said my watch says I spend very little time in rem sleep. I know all the peoples back stories. I have stronger connections with some folks. The connection to these dreams almost feels like a past life it is so real.

Dream 1 
I am in a major train station I believe in a larger English speaking mainly nation.  I see trains coming and going of of multiple tracks.  I am able to walk through out the station. I can speak to anyone. I have my regulars that I see often and new folks. I somehow always have cash or coins but try as I might I can not identify the currency or get a straight answer. It's always enough to get food from the coffee carts though. I think it's somewhere early post war2 Europe. I can not leave the station.  

Dream2
I'm living in some sort of group housing situation. It is early 1900s. We have three older women and one man. Several dozen small children. A handful of adults. In that dream I do a lot of the childrearing and working in the garden. The children leave during the day for school and come back. I believe we are in Oklahoma.  The house is extremely large. It feels like a ""poor house"" run as a charity. Everyone is happy over all. Although the children and other adults have freedom of movement just as in dream one, I cannot leave.

1povlu5,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_West-Wolverine-2846/comments/1povlu5/the_lie_of_everything_happens_for_a_reason/,The Lie of ‘Everything Happens for a Reason.,"When the wife of a guy from the infrastructure team committed suicide, the IT Department rallied around their colleague.  
On the day of the funeral, the IT Department shut down. No explanations. No exceptions.  
It was somber, but remarkable in its solidarity.  
On the days when Eric faltered, the rest picked up the slack without question.  
Years later, after Eric himself had resigned, a consultant who joined the company heard about the tragedy.  
With deft linguistics, woven seamlessly into watercooler banter, she delivered that tired but poisonous cliché: “Everything happens for a reason.”  
She was young, with wide, innocent, doe-eyed conviction, as though she had stumbled upon something profound.  
In true Stoic resignation, the IT guys didn’t say much, they shuffled away to go stare into the void of graphs and charts.  
  
But the words stuck with me. It wasn’t my first rodeo with that line.  
“Everything happens for a reason” is a neat little coffin for your suffering.  
It justifies chaos by pretending the universe has a filing cabinet where your tragedies sit, labeled and organized, as if your heartbreak, your humiliation, your failure were part of some grand administrative effort.  
It’s a cliché in cahoots with cruelty, turning random violence into moral platitude.  
It paints you as complicit in your own destruction, suggesting the pain was never senseless but always deserved.  
I don’t always have a handy comeback for clichés.  
Often I’m too tired, or resigned to the knowledge that it won’t matter to those who bow before such phrases.  
Even if I eviscerated someone wielding one, what would it change if they weren’t ready to question or unlearn old ideas?  
But I occasionally manage to slip a knife between the ribs of assumption.  
That same consultant, a sweet woman, asked about our new helpdesk system.  
She was writing a marketing blurb. “The reason behind this was a global drive to modernize service delivery and align company values with other systems. How does that sound?”  
I told her the reason behind the purchase was an ego-driven decision by a narcissistic manager who had since departed.  
The consultant didn’t respond to the jab.  
  
I poured another cup of sludge that could pass for coffee in some universes and let her be.  
What could have been the reason for drinking such vile stuff, I wondered?  
We all nurture our reasons, and we have explanations, but very few reasons are universal manuals that can solve all the brokenness on a cosmic level. Not even our own reasons for today’s disaster might be aligned with tomorrow’s unknown horrors.  
If everything happens for a reason, then your pain is paperwork and your grief is office policy. Congratulations, you’re nothing more than collateral damage in someone else’s email.

Since she has known me she knows I don’t really like children / never held a child / have no interest in them but every single time I see her she wants me to compliment her baby. It goes something along the lines of “Oh I know you don’t think babies are cute but look at them they are so cute.” “You have to admit XX is so cute”. I noticed most recently when we met for a coffee I was chatting away about something unrelated and I felt she looked visibly annoyed and all of sudden just cut me off saying “oh how can you not think he is cute?!” then proceeded to talk about his big eyes hair or whatever it was I can’t remember. Anyway completely killed the convo and we just spent the remainder of the time talking kid. 

Maybe I’m an asshole but I deliberately do everything in my power not to say her baby is cute. Now as far as babies go, yeah sure I suppose they are a cuter looking potato but they are still a potato imo. Part of me thinks is that she hasn’t always received many compliments about how she looks (though I always am highly complimentary about her when I see her because I want to make her feel nice and I know she has some insecurities) but now having a “cute” baby gives her some sort of validation and it boosts her self esteem that this cute baby came from her. 

She will only post photos of her baby online and talk about how her child will be center of attention this Christmas and be treated like royalty. Okay fine.  What makes it more annoying is that her sibling is also trying for a child and this irritates her because I don’t think she wants any of the attention shared. She also has a sibling in law that ‘gave’ the family the first grandchild and this visibly pisses her off and she is constantly comparing the two children, looks and personality. 

We are meeting up in a group soon and she has said that people no longer want to meet up with her they are only interested in meeting her child now. Not true on my part I can assure you but I already feel myself getting twitchy. 

Anyway just needed a rant, I don’t know how to behave or how to respond but it is really beginning to annoy me. I obviously don’t want to upset her but also I wonder what she wants from me. She gets plenty of validation elsewhere so just leave me alone. Congrats you had sex and made a cute potato I guess? ",73,1765975384.0,childfree,22,1.0,False

I am looking for some reassurance please, as soon as I noticed this I booked in an appoinment with my dentist for this coming Monday but I just want to make sure I do not need to see someone sooner.

  
I am very mindful with my teeth, I brush twice a day with an electric toothbrush & Sensodyne, I floss each morning, I usually have annual check ups and hygenist cleans but have not been to a Dentist in about 16 months due to being on a single income temporarily (now no longer an issue thankfully).

  
At my last check up in Autumn 24 all was fine, this is why I am so suprised now to find one of my gums, on my top right side, on I think my second molar, has receded all the way to the top of my jaw line.

  
I have only noticed today as I had a small sore lump appear there I could feel with my tounge a few days ago, I assumed it was swollen due to trapped food or irration, it actually felt less painful and smaller today, though I could taste a bit of blood after a coffee so I took a look in the mirror and am shocked to see how far one tooth has receded.

  
I havent noticed before now as my cheeks are very tight (commented each time by the Hygienist) so for me to actually see the top row of my gums and teeth each side of my mouth is very difficult without wrenching my lip and mouth wide open. 

  
I do not smoke or drink heavily and take care of my teeth. I am a bit shocked and feel very anxious and am just asking why this could possibly of happened so quickly, I do have an issue with clenching my jaw, is this a factor?. I want to also ask if my appointment is soon enough to avoid any further issues as I am paranoid & anxious about infection. (it isnt hot there on my face or pulsating with pain, it just feels tender if I tounge it).

1povd3e,https://youtu.be/ANDZXaRpkDU?si=pjBCy3M0X8WF7QuZ,Mbongwana Star - 1 Million C'est Quoi? (2015),"MBONGWANA STAR:

Kinshasa’s Afro-junk revolutionaries

“Here, in the streets, it’s the anti-technology thing that works. Everything’s recorded in the red! Sometimes I over-boost mikes that are recording nothing, just to pick up the kind of environment that’s around me now. Can you hear it? There are three TVs going full blast. Distortion multiplies the energy. I love it!”

Doctor L’s grin pixellates as an atrocious Internet connection dices up our Skype conversation. It doesn’t stop him. He seems to revel in the unpredictable zaniness that kicks in when technology breaks down. His words keep coming, delivered with an accent traceable to some obscure point between Paris and Dublin, his lean face a flag of fearless cheek under the ragged mound of dreadlocks that he credits with the ability to disarm any feelings of hostility a lone white man might otherwise attract in the ghettos of Africa.

It’s not just the sonic dirt that excites him; it’s the free spirit you sometimes find in places that no one is paying any attention to: the garage lands where garage bands turn streetwise anger into DIY productivity, revelling in their own ostracism and self-reliance. Punk rock, in other words. But Doctor L isn’t talking to me from underneath London’s Westway or on New York’s Lower East Side; he’s talking to me from Avenue Kasavubu in downtown Kinshasa, just opposite the Academie des Beaux-Arts. He seems to have found the eternal punk ethic alive and well on the banks of the Congo river, in the raucous swelter-skelter of Africa’s third largest city (equal to London in size), and he’s working hard to bottle it and bring it back to Europe. “It’s not that going to Africa is any big deal,” he says. “The big deal is to try and get something out.”

Horror stories about the Congo have been feeding the gorier side of the European imagination since the British Consul Roger Casement published his report on the abuses of the Congo Free State in 1904. The rape of that immense land, witnessed amongst others by Casement and his friend Joseph Conrad, whose classic Heart of Darkness remains one of the most controversial literary statements about Africa ever written by a white man, has continued to this day under both European and African rulers. It has been perennially justified by the global need, or rather greed, for certain raw materials deemed fundamental to modern existence, rubber initially and then a cornucopia of minerals including copper, gold, diamonds and, latterly, the rare-earth metals that make our digital ‘smart’ lives possible. The Congo wars of the 1990s and 2000s currently sit at No. 15 in the Wikipedia chart of the most costly conflicts in history in terms of human life, and No. 1 in African history. And yet who, outside Central Africa, remembers them now. Rape, followed by injury, insult, ignorance and forgetfulness: is there any other part of our earth that has been so abused and misunderstood?

But the place has its fans. Among them are the Belgian music producer-manager Michel Winter and the French filmmakers Florent de la Tullaye and Renaud Barret. Toiling away down in showbiz’s steerage class to bring some of Kinshasa’s street-level wonders to the attention of the world, they belong to a rare breed. The nightmarish penumbra that envelopes the Congo in the Western imagination tends to repel all but the hardiest souls. It takes a special kind of cultural adventurer to lift the curse and see Kinshasa for what it surely is: a place of immense human creativity, ingenuity and style, with the potential to become one of Africa’s creative powerhouses. It seems that Doctor L has just joined their ranks. “The city becomes a drug,” he says. “Freaks like Michel, like Renaud, like Florent are important. I give the crown to all those guys.”

Renaud Barret and Florent de la Tullaye first travelled to Kinshasa in 2004, two virtually penniless wannabe film-makers enticed by an invisible force: ‘invisible’ as in hidden from the rest of the world and ‘force’ as in the tenacious will to survive and create. “At that stage of my life, France was just screwing my head,” Barret remembers. “All those people crying into their cups because they had to have the support of the state just to create something. In Kinshasa, it was the complete opposite; it was people who create out of a sense of urgency, who create because it keeps them alive. I said to myself: “That’s it! That’s the truth, not in the calculation but in the act of creation first and foremost.”

Barret and de la Tullaye’s first documentary film Jupiter’s Dance was a portrait of the Kinshasa music scene through the prism of a musician and street-level philosopher by the name of Jupiter Bokondji. While they were making that film they stumbled across a bunch of musicians in wheelchairs serenading the denizens of the Kinshasa night: prostitutes, renegade soldiers, hustlers and street kids or shégués as they’re known locally, apparently in mysterious homage to Che Guevara. The band was named Staff Benda Bilili (“the people who see beyond”) after a local beer joint. Barret and de la Tullaye spent the next five years and every ounce of energy and courage they possessed making a film about Staff and the extraordinary underworld they inhabited. It was called Benda Bilili and when it came out in 2010, it became the most successful non-Western music documentary since Buena Vista Social Club, helping to propel the reputations of both band and filmmakers to unimagined levels.

But Staff Benda Bilili’s success didn’t bring a deluge of music and film producers to Kinshasa. The ‘freaks’ carried on ploughing their solitary field; the curse remained in place. One reason perhaps is that both Benda Bilili and the other well-publicised Congolese tale of musical triumph against adversity – the undoubtedly remarkable story of the Orchestre Symphonique Kimbanguiste which was turned into the film Kinshasa Symphony by Claus Wischmann and Martin Baer – drew their power, for Western audiences at least, not from the originality of their art, but from their shared themes of gargantuan self-improvement and self-empowerment through music. They seemed to satisfy Matthew Arnold’s conviction, so entrenched in the Western humanist mindset, that art can elevate the lowest into the realms of ‘sweetness and light’, the only limiting factors being work, will-power and self-belief. Inevitably, there also was a complex element of pity involved.

And though none would dare admit it, both Staff Benda Bilili and Orchestre Symphonique Kimbanguiste had something of Samuel Johnson’s proverbial dog walking on his two hind legs about them: “It is not done well, but you are surprised to find it done at all.” The allusion is unkind of course, and largely inaccurate, as was Johnson’s original statement, which he made in reference to female preachers. Speaking in purely musical terms, Staff Benda Bilili added a credible new chapter to the very old story of Congolese rumba, a style that, along with its louder, brasher offspring soukous and ndombolo, has been the dominant musical force in the Congo and larges swathes of sub-Saharan Africa since the 1960s. Orchestre Symphonique Kimbanguiste might not yet have achieved the technical brilliance of the London Symphony Orchestra or the Berlin Philharmonic – who could possibly expect them to have done so – but their renditions of Carmina Burana and Beethoven’s Ninth exude a courage and cohesive pride that can ignite powerful joy in those with an open heart and sympathetic ear.

But self-improvement and the triumph of human will over poverty and disability can only inspire and sustain the career of an artist or musician for a limited time. The journey from rags to riches can only be taken once. The world must eventually judge an artist not by the journey he or she has taken, but by the intrinsic qualities of their art, not only the skill but, more importantly, the creativity and originality.

When Staff Benda Bilili split under the weight of their own success in late 2013, their main songwriter ‘Coco’ Yakala Ngambali teamed up with fellow singer ‘Theo’ Nsituvuidi Nzonza to form a new band. At first it was called Trio Mbongwana, then Staff Mbongwana International and finally Mbongwana Star. Mbongwana simply means ‘change’ or ’switch’ in Lingala, the lingua franca of the Congo River. “In Mbongwana Star, we’ve changed all the rules,” Theo says in one of the band’s early promotional videos. “We’ve decided to take control. We choose to produce our music ourselves. We are all bosses now.” Theo went further went I interviewed the band in London recently: “We also changed the rhythm,” he said. “We built a tempo that can wake up any dancefloor on the planet.” Talking to the Theo and the rest of the band, it quickly became clear to me that what the band refer to as ‘rhythm’ actually means something broader, something closer to ‘style’.

Following the global success and painful breakup of Staff Benda Bilili, whatever style Mbongwana Star chose to play had to be new and surprising. It couldn’t just be a re-run of Staff Benda Bilili minus the brilliance of the young Roger Landu and his self-made satongé (one-stringed tin-can harp), both of whom added such a unique dimension to Staff Benda’s sound. Nor did Theo and Coco want to perpetuate the Dickensian sentiments invoked by their rags-to-riches story and the fact that they’re both handicapped. That was old news. They wanted their music to stand by itself, crutchless and proud, and for it to do that, they needed to find a sound that was startling and irresistible, one that mirrored the creative genius of their home city.

But that mission was still vague and unfocussed. Both musicians were carrying a heavy load of influences and habits accumulated during long lives hard-lived (“All the lives of ghetto people are like odysseys,” says Renaud Barret). That made the task of reinventing themselves harder. Coco was turning sixty, and Theo had left his fiftieth birthday way behind. The Congolese rhumba artists who had nurtured them as children and young men still dominated their creative outlook. It wasn’t easy to imagine a new style that paid respect to those greats whilst breaking the mould they had bequeathed.

The Congolese rumba that was born in the 1940s, a love child of the country’s obsession with imported Cuban dance music mixed and its immense wealth of native dances and rhythms, has become a religion in the Congo. Its ‘gods’ – Franco, Tabu Ley le Rochereau, Le Grand Kallé, Zaiko Langa Langa, Papa Wemba – are cultural icons that inspire pride and loyalty. Their legacy cannot not be toyed with lightly, or irreverently. “Sounds can change, according to what we’re living over there, to what we come across in the streets and elsewhere,” Theo says. “But it’ll never change completely, because we’re still in the rhythm of our forebears: the rumba rhythm. Those are the roots of Congolese music. They’ll never disappear.”

Coco and Theo both contracted polio in childhood, but in contrast to the cruel ostracism suffered by many a Congolese child similarly afflicted, both were treated well by their parents. Coco only left home at the age of 14 when he realised his presence was becoming a burden to his family. He preferred to live with his friends in a special shelter for the handicapped where there was a possibility of learning a trade (tailoring for women in his case). Theo’s father, a fisherman, went to see all the traditional healers in his locality to find a cure for his son, without success. Despite this, Theo was sent to school at the age of six and stayed there until he was fifteen. Then, on the advice of his parents, he travelled up to Kinshasa to live with his older sister and learn a trade, which also happened to be tailoring.

At the time, Mobutu Sese Seko, the dictator of what was then called Zaire, took a paternal interest in the plight of the disabled and passed laws to ensure that they were, for the most part, properly fed, housed and taught some employable skills. Mobutu also exempted them from charges and duties levied on the river ferries that chugged back and forth over the Congo River between Kinshasa, capital of what had been the Belgian Congo, and Brazzaville, capital of what had been the French Congo. Mobutu’s stroke of largesse attracted many handicapped people to the Kinshasa river port, where, several times a week, their self-made hand-cranked wheel chairs would be loaded up with trade goods and heaved up the gangways onto the ferries for the tax-free journey across the river.

Kinshasa was already a huge city back in the 70s and 80s, and because many of these handicapped traders lived in shelters that were hours away from the river-port, they often decided to move closer and sleep outdoors on large flattened cardboards boxes or tonkara in the local argot (derived from the French slang vocabulary known as verlan, which ‘flips’ the syllables of two-syllable words, turning carton or ‘cardboard box’ into toncar). Despite their street-level existence, the handicapped often managed to achieve a level of security and financial stability that was denied to millions of their fellow Congolese, thanks to the perks afforded them by the law and the strength they found in numbers.

Coco’s father went down to the port to try and persuade him to return home, but he refused. His new life down by the river suited him well. His uncle, who was a musician, bought Coco a guitar and he started to entertain his fellow street-dwellers with the popular rhumba hits of the day. He would jam and hangout with another handicapped river-trader by the name of Nzalé, who was an excellent guitarist. Coco was about eighteen years old when the pair began to busk in the swanky bars and restaurants frequented by whites in Gombé, the downtown ‘entertainment’ district of Kinshasa. Years went by in this way: trading, busking, hawking, surviving.

Theo and Coco started playing together after they met down at the river-port in 1999. Theo had learned the traditional music of Bas-Congo from his father and later become the singer in a band in Brazzaville. In 2002, Coco, Theo and their fellow riverside troubadours came to the attention of one of the Congo’s most renowned international stars: Papa Wemba. Enchanted by their rough-cut melodies and fearlessness, Wemba offered them free use of his downtown rehearsal studio, but his patronage ceased after barely more than a year when Wemba was indicted by a court in France for visa-fraud and people smuggling. Not long after this setback, in late 2003, Coco joined up with Nzalé and Papa Ricky, another handicapped musician and doyen of downtown street life, to form Staff Benda Bilili. Theo joined soon afterwards.

“Something you find a lot with people \[in Kinshasa\], be they musicians or boxers, is that dreams are a way of surviving,” says Florent de la Tullaye. “Dreams allow people to walk tall and create projects. Even if they come to nothing in the end, just the energy of those dreams increases the chances of survival.” Perhaps that’s one of the reasons Coco and Theo lost so little time after Staff Benda Bilili imploded nine years later, before launching themselves on another adventure. When one dream dies, give birth to another one…quick style!

The first Mbongwana Star rehearsals were fairly chaotic. “They bought along this guy and that guy,” remembers manager and exec producer Michel Winter, “mates, members of the family and I don’t know what. And we quickly ended up with a kind of church choir, at least in terms of the voices. It was more like demo stuff than music by a band that was ready to release an album.” According to Renaud Barret, it was Theo who was most aware that what they were doing lacked originality. Barret told him about a friend called Liam Farrell aka Doctor L. Liam and Renaud got to know each other in St Ouen, the scruffy suburb north of Paris city centre where they both lived.

Liam is the son of the Irish artist Michael Farrell, who exiled himself to Paris when Liam was still a child. He grew into a maverick young drummer and producer on the Parisian hip-hop and electro scenes before becoming one of the most innovative (you might even say ‘disruptive’) producers of music from Africa. Liam had been collaborating with Kabeya Tshimpangila aka Cubain, a percussionist from Kinshasa who seems to have played with everyone who’s anyone in the city’s grass roots music scene, including Jupiter and Staff Benda Bilili. Cubain also happened to be in Kinshasa helping Coco and Theo set up Mbongwana Star. The connections were multiple.

Renaud Barret played Coco and Theo some songs from Black Voices, the album that Liam had made with the Nigerian drummer Tony Allen back in 2004. The name Tony Allen was already enough to put some heat into the idea of a collaboration. Coco and Theo were fans of Afrobeat, the rhythm that Allen had invented with Fela Kuti back in the late 1960s; Black Voices had put new life into that rhythm, just as it was emerging from the confines of African and ‘World’ music fandom and attracting an entirely new audience of white funksters and hip electro-dance priests. “That’s it!” was Theo’s reaction on hearing the album, “that’s the direction we should go in. Because mbongwana means ‘change’. Because that’s the future.”

Liam ‘Doctor L’ Farrell and Michel Winter travelled to Kinshasa in early summer of 2014 for the first real recording sessions. Michel had rented a small house in its own yard near the city centre, a parcelle in local parlance, which offered the most basic accommodation. Doctor L slept in a tiny badly ventilated room that baked in the tropical heat, day and night. The grid provided electricity only for short periods, if at all, so a generator had to be hired to run the amps, mikes and recording equipment. Coco’s wife would arrive everyday with the food – sometimes chicken, sometimes fish accompanied by fufu, rice, manioc, beans. It was the kind of set up that Doctor L thrives in.

The music that Coco and Theo played to Michel and Doctor L was a heedless assault of percussion, guitars and voices that was unsure of what direction it should be heading in. There was work to be done. The sound that everyone was searching for was still latent, like a beautiful stone sculpture embedded in a rough-hewn boulder. Doctor L began to record as much as he could, chipping away, paring down, honing. “When we started, we were still doing the same ideas as before,” Theo says, “but when Liam got involved he proposed a lot of changes.”

“We were looking for something fairly rock’n’roll,” says Winter, whose CV also includes the management of Staff Benda Bilili and the dukes of Congolese distortion – Konono No.1. “We wanted to try and get out of the 100% African, afro-African, straightjacket, into which everybody tries to stick African bands and get back, not in the music necessarily but in spirit, to the 1970s when Africans were really modern, maybe more so than us. I found that Coco already had that in him. People here are a lot more creative than we can imagine; Kinshasa is crawling with creativity. You couldn’t care less if it’s African or not! We just thought ‘Let’s just go for it! Because it’s there anyway. You can feel it in the streets. It exists!’”

Technology, the Internet, have changed the game in Kinshasa, like as they have everywhere else. The gamut of influences has exploded. “Cable TV is only four or five years old in West Africa,” Farrell continues, “and already, in four or five years, it’s totally changed the kids. They won’t listen to rumba any more, they’ll be listening to Beyoncé. They already know so much more about London and Paris than we’ll ever know about Kinshasa, and that changes what the expectations of people are from music. But it’s good. I mean, fuck it, the world is like that. Everything needs to be communicating; it’s difference of style, of vibe that makes your originality.”

For Doctor L, this opening up of the arteries of communication and influence isn’t just inevitable, it’s positive. Roots may be important, but they can’t entangle an artist in modes of expression that limit his vision or prevent him being an honest mirror to the life going on around him. “I think Africa deserves, like everybody, to have artists who can take different trips, which may or may not be 100% related to Africa,” he says. “It’s not like we’re busy saying ‘We’re European!’ What does that fucking mean? It’s important that all this magic of art can exist there as well, without it being Iike me saying ‘Ok, I’m going to Ireland to do Celtic music because that’s who I’m supposed to be.’ We’re not talking about Africa here, we’re talking about guys who are doing music.”

When Doctor L’s mixes were heard back in Kinshasa, the effect was one of puzzlement, stupefaction even, followed by escalating excitement and wild dancing. “It was a bit different compared to our rhythm here in Kinshasa,” Theo remembers. “Really, really different. We loved it from the beginning.” Really? From the beginning? “Immediately! It was…WHAAAA?…oh yes, this is good! Those were rhythms that we could get close to.”

What about guitarist R9, one of the ‘youth wing’ of the band? How did he react when he heard the mixes? “Well, it was brand new music,” he said, “but it wasn’t complicated, because it was based on music that we’ve already been hearing for a long time. It was a just a modification for us. For me, it was a joy; I was happy to have created a new style with that. The youth of Kinshasa are more interested by new things. It’s really very important.”

Barret, who was with the band in Kinshasa when Liam’s mixes came through, remembers them dancing all over the place. The songs were on constant replay. Crucially perhaps, the reaction of the band’s entourage was also very encouraging. Fans would gather whenever the band rehearsed in their studio in the Ndjili district. “They would throw flowers at us, support us, shout ‘Mbongwana Star Forward!” remembers Sage, the band’s percussionist and vibe master. “We never expected that. They \[the mixes\] were great. And they made everyone dance. Without even singing the style, people were already dancing.”

For Theo, danceability is the ultimate litmus test of any new musical venture: “Whether it’s in Kinshasa, or here \[in Europe\]: that’s the most important things for me. We’ve done quite a few concerts and everybody dances; everyone is into that rhythm.”

Thanks to a fortuitous meeting at a soirée in London dedicated to music from the Sahara Desert, Michel Winter pressed a copy of the mixes into the hands of Nick Gold, famed founder and A&R man of World Circuit. Love at first sight in rare in showbiz, and the offer of a contract on the basis of a simple demo even rarer. But those Congo River gods must have been working overtime because Gold listened to the mixes on his way home that night and a deal was on the table within weeks. Not only was Mbongwana Star the first new band that World Circuit had signed in a long while, it was also the first in over twenty years to be produced by someone other than Gold himself and the first ever to have come from the Congo (Mali and Cuba being World Circuit’s habitual hunting grounds).

By the time Liam and Michel returned to Kinshasa in November, Coco, Theo and their new musicians were busy making the new sound their own. “What’s really interesting with Coco and Theo is that they’re ready to run with it if they feel it, whatever it is,” Liam says. “It’s not me inventing them. They’re artists. This is something really interesting that I love in Africa, and that people don’t talk about a lot: the strength and rapidity they have to integrate whatever comes up.”

The band line-up was beginning to reduce and solidify. First on percussion, then drums, was a handsome young ghetto dude with an intense gaze, a neat splay of short dreads and an easy respectful manner. Forty years younger than Coco, Randy Makana Kalambayi was born in Kinshasa to a family who survived by hawking and doing odd jobs. When he was still a child, his father decided to move the family to Bas Congo but died shortly afterwards. Randy went back to Kinshasa to live with his mother’s family; it was hard to make ends meet. At the age of seven, he met Coco, who was the neighbour of one of his uncles. Coco set him up with a family in Brazzaville; the mother sold peanuts down in the market and Randy contributed by selling plastic bags on the streets. Water had to be fetched from a standpipe hundreds of metres from the house. Life was an accumulation of all these little rites of survival.

Randy played percussion in a local church in Brazzaville before deciding, aged only eight but not quite tender anymore, to go back to Kinshasa and reunite with Coco. He became his mentor’s chief wheel-chair pusher, a position that earned him Coco’s protection, as well as some standing in the informal street syndicate of the homeless and handicapped. In the brutally Darwinian world of Kinshasa’s streets, such an alliance could mean the difference between survival and obliteration for a young shégué or street kid.

Randy even joined Staff Benda Bilili for a while and contributed percussion to their first album Très Très Fort. But before he could board the sweet chariot that carried the band off to Europe and success, Randy was persuaded to come back to Brazzaville by his mother to help support the family. He worked as a fare-collector on the busses and a labourer on a building site, a job that turned out to be lethally hard and very badly paid. Eventually he crossed the river once again and landed back in Kinshasa. There Randy learned that Staff Benda Bilili had become a worldwide success and were currently on tour in Japan. When they returned they asked Randy to rejoin the band, but visa problems prevented him from going on Staff Benda’s next tour. He did play some percussion to the band’s second album however. Then, when Coco and Théo decided to quit and set up Mbongwana Star, they invited him along as drummer.

Although Randy is a father now, he still lives in a shelter for the homeless and handicapped, a place that functions, according to Farrell, like an African village lost in the middle of a megapolis. He’s become a master of the Kitéké rhythms of the Batéké plateau, the old name for the country surrounding the ‘pool’ between Kinshasa and Brazzaville. Those rhythms, subtle and strangely familiar, are the pistons of the new Mbongwana sound.

For the pivotal role of guitar-player, an instrument that has supplied the melodic pulse of Congolese music since the 1950s, Coco and Théo chose Jean-Claude Kamina Mulodi, aka ‘R9’ because he was the ninth and last child born to his parents. R9 is a thirty-something guitar hero, who long ago pledged his allegiance to Zaiko Langa Langa, the Congolese band who dominated the pan-African soukous boom of the 1970s and 1980s. He’s also a huge fan of ACDC and Angus Young, but his stock-in-trade remains the intricately flowing, delicately sparkling Zaiko-esque guitar loops, the ones that send your soul skywards while your feet make love to the ground.

R9’s father, who was in the army, had a career in the Catholic priesthood mapped out for his son; but R9 had other ideas. He began making his own instruments out of junk when he was barely five years old, and was taught how to play by his elder brothers, who sang ndombolo. Having started off as a drummer, R9 gravitated towards the guitar and eventually became lead guitarist in a band in his hometown of Dibaya in Bandundu, a huge province that lies to the east of Kinshasa. R9’s parents had both died by the time he was seven, and his brothers sisters drifted away leaving him alone to survive on the sums of money sent him by his siblings. After graduating from the local lycée, R9 travelled up to Kinshasa and began performing with small neighbourhood groups, eventually working his way up to becoming a guitarist in the band of Pépé Kallé, a huge star in the Congo. When Coco and Théo formed Mbongwana they asked R9 to become their guitarist. “The guitar loops he plays made Liam and I think of techno and electro music from afar,” says Renaud Barret, “so he adapted well to that electro aspect of the project.”

Completing the line-up was Sage (as in the French word that rhymes with ‘massage’ and means ‘kind’, ‘good’ or ‘well-behaved’). Son of Coco’s wife Marie, Sage is a self-taught percussionist, a tropical cyclone on-stage, a ghetto rude-boy who enjoys his strolls on the wild side. “Very rock’n’roll” was Barret’s succinct description of Sage’s lifestyle.

In January 2015, just as Kinshasa was going through one of its periodic spasms of political violence and mayhem following President Laurent Kabila’s unconstitutional attempts to extend his time in office, Coco, Theo, Farrell and the other musicians were holed up in the Hotel Finesse on Avenue Kasavubu, patiently working out how to reproduce the challenging dynamics of Mbongwana’s revolutionary new style live on stage. Farrell’s position in the project had evolved from that of mere producer to producer, bassist, synth and sound FX player, arranger and conceptualiser. He was no longer the white European strategist who stays in his studio, one step removed, and envelopes his charges in a skin of sound that will, he hopes, make them palatable to the ears of the world. Mbongwana Star was no longer a purely African band. It was a trans-national, trans-ethnic, trans-cultural sound machine, a coalition of black and white, Africa and Europe. Don’t think James Brown; think Sly and the Family Stone.

Given the pressures of history and the build-up of sensitivity around topics such as race, culture and colonialism, it’s easy to guess at the prevalent line of questioning that Mbongwana star will be subjected to in the media and the cybersphere. Can a white man play such a prominent role in a black African band? Does it not risk smelling of appropriation, paternalism, cultural colonialism, exploitation, racial arrogance, dilution or all of the above (delete as applicable)?

Not only is Liam unapologetic about the level of his involvement in this project, he also considers the sensitivities and malaise that often surge to the fore in reaction to any cultural collaboration between white Europeans and black Africans to be misplaced, even reactionary: “I think, if you like music, and you like art, colour’s got fucking nothing to do with nothing. That’s what’s great about this world. We all need each other. Let’s stop pretending. I’m very happy that white guys make black guys exist and vice versa. It’s like all these old Analogue Africa records. You always need these white mad motherfuckers to dig out all the old dope African music…that’s what’s great about this world. And I’ve got African records where the mix is over the top man! The guitar is 20DBs too strong, but it’s fucking killing! It’s like magic. I never could have done that. So thank you guys!”

Although there’s black blood in almost every note ever played by a white pop musician since the end of the First World War, the traffic has never been one way. Ragtime, jazz, blues, RnB, funk, soul, all have been fed by a minority of white as well as a majority of black cultural influences. In fact, the band with arguably the biggest influence on the evolution of black music in the last three decades, was white. And German! So, as Farrell suggests, let’s not pretend. The true creative impulse is colour-blind. It goes where it wants, talks to who it feels like talking to, collaborates with anybody that takes its fancy. As well as a mutual respect, it’s the brilliance, the originality at the end of the process that counts. “What’s interesting with Coco and Theo is that they’re ready to run if they feel it, whatever it is,” Farrell says. “We’re not like dictators. It’s not me inventing them. They’re artists.”

Coco repays the compliment: “Really, I like Liam. We work well with him. He’s courageous. He’s a real artist is Liam. I recognise that.” And when I ask the band if a white man can play African music, the response is heartfelt, and unanimous: “It’s not colour that plays music,” Theo says, “it’s the spirit. We don’t see the white, the black, the yellow, the red. We all have red in our veins. We’re together. We play music.”

Mbongwana’s aim is to express an attitude, a creative spirit that already exists in Kinshasa. It’s a spirit built on garbage. Renaud Barret has coined a cheeky moniker for it – System K – which he intends to use as the title of a forthcoming feature documentary. It refers not only to Kinshasa, but also to rue Kato, the downtown drag that has become the epicentre of the garbage-to-art revolution. It’s also a skit on the French term Système D, after the verbs se débrouiller (to get by, to find a way) and se démerder (to find a way without landing in the shit). Roughly, Système D means to manage and survive in the face of poverty and rejection with only your wits and your courage to protect you. The term combines English concepts such as the underclass, the black economy and the daily hustle of survival into one neat tag.

“System K runs the entire city,” Barret explains, “that’s to say, it’s imposed by the current climate, by la débrouille (making do), by all those gestures of daily life that are the creativity of survival. As you know Kinshasa was once the musical capital of Africa. Then everything crashed politically and so \[there were\] no new instruments or anything. De facto, a whole generation of young musicians with nothing in their hands and nothing in their pockets began making their own instruments, not to get into any kind of found-object art, but just out of necessity. Rue Kato is an artery, about two kilometres long from end to end, and on both sides of the streets you’ve these guys making stuff and creating stuff. They’re creating a new musical style. \[They’re\] recycled grooves but it makes me think of the first Wu Tang album, very minimalist stuff, all based on recycled materials. There are at least 10 creators there, who create loops with tape machines that are themselves reconstructed, and then people come and add stuff, whether it’s a female singer, a rapper, poets. Poverty has created this sound. That’s what’s fascinating. And It’s totally creative. If you listen closely, all the sounds of the city are in there.”

In our excitement about the potential of Kinshasa as a temple of creativity, it’s easy to forget that, in the end, it’s all about means and graft and courage. The band are well aware that, as they sit in a London hotel, talking to journalists, drinking coffee and playing with their smart phones, thousands back home are still tight-rope walking on the meagre line that separates survival from oblivion. “God pushes us to rediscover what we really see,” says R9, “so it’s a big feeling. What I can say to our friends who are still behind us, they have to work hard and give their energy to go further. No job is unworthy. Only people are unworthy. All that can be done, must be done, must be expressed. One mustn’t go backwards, or stay blocked; you have to give your energy, your inspiration. May we always remain mobile and work hard to prepare the future…”

If the master plan succeeds, Mbongwana Star could become the Trojan Horse that penetrates the bastion of the world’s indifference (and revulsion and paranoia) and lifts the curse to bring that creative power out of rue Kato, the Beaux Arts, and other parts of Kinshasa. “The Beaux Arts is like a town within a town,” says Renaud. “Mbongwana Star has started rehearsing there and there’s a correlation with visual artists, stylists, people working on logos etc. It’s this kind of electric movement, this new vibe in Kinshasa that we’re trying to mix in with the music and the image.”

The journey ahead may be long, but the time for lift-off has surely come. The Congo Astronaut has waiting long enough.

As the title states, I have no friends, so unless I want to be alone all day (something I have considered) I'll be spending the day with my family (parents, 1 younger brother). Also for context, I can get pretty down during winter so I'm more prone to feeling guilty/lonely over things.

Last year I requested going ice skating, which was a very special trip because the nearest rink is several hours away (I live in a very rural area), but I just ended up feeling kinda lonely and guilty about requesting something that required so much out of my family. I'd gone ice skating by myself when I was younger for my birthday and had had fun, but last year being out there alone on the rink just hit different in a bad way.

I would honestly love having a simple cutesy meet up with friends if I had any, like going to get our nails done (something I'venever done before), or going and hanging out at a coffee shop and chatting, but again, no friends. 

Something I've thought about is making it a ""me day"" (go get a massage, get my nails done, schedule a haircut, go get coffee, etc) and then meeting up with my family at a local restaurant for dinner or something, which does sound kinda nice tbh, but I'm also afraid that I would end up feeling lonely and guilty about spending so much money (I'm sure the things I just mentioned would total up to several hundred dollars) and that would ofc kill the vibe.

An actual birthday party also sounds nice, but feels a little self-centered and immature at my age. But I do have cousins and relatives that I enjoy spending time with that would be nice just hanging out with for an evening. But they are all older than me and I would feel weird asking them to take time out of there day to come to a party ✨️just for me✨️, and I don't want them to feel pressured to buy me anything because ik most of them are living on tight budgets rn.

Grab coffee.

I've been building a fairly complex SaaS platform and wanted to share the infrastructure decisions and patterns that emerged. This isn't about the business domain—just the technical scaffolding that might be useful to others building similar systems.

**Stack Overview**

* Frontend: React + TypeScript (Vite), wouter, TanStack Query, React Hook Form + Zod
* Backend: Node.js + Express + TypeScript
* Database: PostgreSQL (Neon serverless) via Drizzle ORM (Prod lives on AWS, not Neon!)
* Auth: Auth0 Universal Login (RFC 8252 compliant)
* Queue: BullMQ with Redis (Postgres fallback)

**Multi-Tenancy + Row Level Security**

Every tenant-scoped query requires a `TenantContext` object. We enforce this at the service layer with a `requireTenantContext(ctx, 'methodName')` helper that hard-fails with descriptive errors if `tenantId` is missing. This prevents accidental cross-tenant data leaks at the code level before RLS even kicks in.

For global resources (pricing tiers, system configs), we use a `SYSTEM_CTX` constant that explicitly bypasses tenant filtering—making it obvious in code review when something is intentionally tenant-agnostic.

**Storage Abstraction Layer (SAL)**

We built a SAL to future-proof for scale with OLTP/OLAP separation. The abstraction provides domain-specific interfaces (e.g., `ICreditStorage`, `IUserStorage`) rather than a generic `IStorage`. Each interface method enforces `TenantContext`.

Current implementation:

* Relational (OLTP): Postgres via Drizzle for transactional data
* Binary/Audio: Replit Object Storage (S3-compatible)
* Analytics (future OLAP): Architecture supports plugging in columnar stores

Migration from legacy `IStorage` to SAL is phased. We track migration status per-router and have test coverage validating tenant isolation at each layer.

**Async Writes with Read-Your-Writes**

We implemented a transactional outbox pattern for reliable background writes. Writes are routed as either:

* **Direct:** Immediate execution (users, sessions, payments, auth, credits)
* **Queued:** Outbox table → BullMQ worker with Postgres fallback

The key insight: we needed read-your-writes semantics. When a user triggers an action that queues a write, subsequent reads in the same request should reflect that pending write. The outbox pattern handles this by making the write visible in the outbox before the background worker processes it.

**Stateless for Autoscale**

The main application is stateless. We extracted stateful components into separate services:

**2-Repl Architecture for Voice:**

* Main App: Auth, UI, business logic, voice proxy
* Voice Service: Thin WebSocket relay to OpenAI Realtime API

A feature flag (`USE_VOICE_SERVICE`) controls whether voice routes through the proxy or falls back to local implementation. Local fallback code is preserved but frozen—CI prevents modifications.

**WebSocket Autoscale:** [Socket.IO](http://Socket.IO) with optional Redis adapter (`@socket.io/redis-adapter`) for cross-instance pub/sub. Graceful degradation to single-instance mode if Redis is unavailable.

**Distributed Locking:** Redis-based locking (`withDistributedLock`) prevents duplicate job execution for scheduled tasks across instances. Falls back to running without lock if Redis is down (acceptable for idempotent jobs).

**Event Loop Protection**

Long-running scheduled jobs were blocking the Node event loop, causing `node-cron` to miss executions. We built a `yieldToEventLoop()` utility that periodically yields during batch processing.

We also stagger background `setInterval` timers to prevent collision:

* Audit flush: 0s start, 30s interval
* Retention metrics: 15s start, 60s interval
* Session cleanup: 45s start, 15min interval

**RBAC System**

Six-tier role hierarchy: `PLATFORM_OWNER` → `PLATFORM_ADMIN` → `TENANT_ADMIN` → `COACH_LEAD` → `COACH` → `WARRIOR`

Backend middleware: `requireAuth`, `requirePermission`, `requireAnyPermission`

Frontend guards: `<PermissionGuard>`, `<CanAccess>`

Database tables: `roles`, `permissions`, `role_permissions`, `user_role_assignments`, `feature_configs`, `role_features`

The `useAuth()` hook exposes `isAdmin` and `isCoach` for UI conditional rendering.

**Custom Form Engine**

Built a Typeform-style form system with extensions:

* Hybrid AI strategy: GPT-4o for quick feedback, Claude Sonnet for deep analysis
* AI feedback is advisory (human review + coach oversight)
* Pattern/rule data is version-controlled and timestamped
* Forms feed into a rules engine for downstream automation

**Error Management**

Centralized error service with:

* Structured error capture and logging
* Persistence layer for error history
* Real-time WebSocket feed for monitoring
* Analytics dashboard for patterns/frequency

Circuit breakers (using `opossum`) wrap external API calls. Rate limiting middleware prevents abuse. All errors return structured JSON responses with consistent shape.

**Resilience Patterns**

* Circuit breakers on all external APIs (Auth0, OpenAI, SendBlue, etc.)
* Rate limiting at middleware level
* Graceful degradation (Redis unavailable → Postgres fallback, Voice service down → local fallback)
* Distributed locks with fallback to lock-free execution for idempotent jobs

**Integrations**

Auth0 (identity), Daily.co (video/transcription), Typeform (legacy forms), Mailgun (email), Calendly (scheduling), Circle.so (community), SendBlue (SMS webhooks), OpenAI (GPT-4o, TTS, Realtime), Anthropic (Claude Sonnet), Vidalytics (video hosting)

# Part 2: Making It Work

Now we move into the *process* of building it with AI agents—specifically Replit Agent—and the hard-won lessons about making it actually work.

**TL;DR:** AI agents are powerful but chaotic. The unlock wasn't better prompting—it was using Claude as a ""senior dev"" to review and prompt Replit, while I act as the USB cable between them.

**The Problem: Replit Forgets Everything Exists**

My codebase has a Storage Abstraction Layer, custom error handling, a write queue system, i18n requirements, strict TypeScript, and about 15 other architectural patterns that *must* be followed.

Replit Agent doesn't care. Every major build:

* Defaults to `any` types everywhere
* Ignores the SAL and writes directly to the database
* Litters the project with TypeScript errors
* Creates linting violations
* Finds creative ways to code *around* existing utilities instead of using them
* Declares ""done"" with half-implemented features

I've tried system prompts, [REPLIT.md](http://REPLIT.md) files, explicit instructions. It helps marginally, but the agent has the memory of a goldfish with ADHD.

**The Validation Script Wall**

This is why my `package.json` looks like this:

json

    ""validate:sal"": ""tsx scripts/validate-sal-imports.ts --strict"",
    ""validate:i18n"": ""tsx scripts/validate-i18n.ts --strict"",
    ""validate:console"": ""tsx scripts/validate-console.ts --strict"",
    ""validate:any"": ""tsx scripts/validate-any-types.ts --strict"",
    ""validate:errors"": ""tsx scripts/validate-error-handling.ts --strict"",
    ""validate:ai"": ""tsx scripts/validate-ai-prompts.ts --strict"",
    ""validate:lockfile"": ""tsx scripts/validate-lockfile.ts"",
    ""validate:side-effects"": ""tsx scripts/validate-side-effects.ts"",
    ""validate:pure-core"": ""tsx scripts/validate-pure-core.ts"",
    ""validate:write-queue"": ""tsx scripts/validate-write-queue-compliance.ts"",
    ""validate:all"": ""npm run validate:sal && npm run validate:i18n && ..."",
    ""preflight"": ""npm run check && npm run lint && npm run validate:ifr""

After *every* major build, I run `npm run preflight` and let the agent fix what it broke. Without this, the codebase would be unmaintainable within a week.

These scripts catch:

* Direct storage access bypassing SAL
* Hardcoded user-facing strings (must use `t()` for i18n)
* Stray `console.log` statements
* `any` types that should be properly typed
* Error handling that bypasses our centralized system
* AI prompts not using our prompt management system
* Side effects in files that should be pure
* Write operations that should go through the queue

The agent will confidently tell you ""done, all tests passing"" while 40 violations are sitting there.

**Force the Agent to Ask Questions First**

Someone in another thread mentioned Socratic prompting. I'd go further: **force the agent to ask questions before every build.**

If you just say ""build X,"" the agent will make assumptions and start coding immediately. Those assumptions are usually wrong.

Instead: ""Before writing any code, ask me clarifying questions about requirements, edge cases, and how this integrates with existing systems.""

The first time I did this, the agent came back with a list of questions that revealed it was about to make 6 catastrophic assumptions. We went through 3-4 rounds of Q&A before a single line of code was written. The build went 10x smoother.

**Markdown Task Files Save Everything**

This was a game-changer: **force the agent to create a markdown file in the repo with phases, tasks, and checkboxes before starting.**

markdown

    ## Phase 1: Database Schema
    - [x] Create migration for new tables
    - [x] Add foreign key constraints
    - [ ] Update SAL interfaces
    
    ## Phase 2: API Routes
    - [ ] POST /api/resource
    - [ ] GET /api/resource/:id
    ...

Benefits:

1. **Scope creep detection** \- When the agent starts adding tasks that weren't in the original spec, you see it immediately
2. **Drift prevention** \- Agent stays on track instead of wandering
3. **Context recovery** \- When context is shot (and it will be), you have a record of what's done and what's left
4. **Agent errors** \- When Replit crashes or loses context mid-build, you don't lose everything

I've had builds where Replit errored out 3 times. The markdown file meant I could resume without re-explaining everything.

**The Real Unlock: Claude as the Senior Dev**

Here's what actually changed everything: **using Claude to prompt Replit.**

Yes, Replit is built on Claude. No, they can't talk to each other directly. But Claude *understands* Replit's behavior patterns, failure modes, and how to structure prompts for it.

My workflow now:

1. **Spec it out with Claude** \- Describe what I want to build, discuss architecture, identify edge cases
2. **Ask Claude for the prompt** \- ""Write me a prompt for Replit Agent to implement this""
3. **Give the prompt to Replit** \- Copy/paste
4. **Replit generates code/diffs** \- Before writing, Replit shows what it's about to do
5. **Send diffs to Claude for review** \- ""Here's what Replit is about to write. Any issues?""
6. **Claude catches the mistakes** \- Typos, logic errors, architectural violations, missing edge cases—Claude spots them in seconds
7. **Send Claude's feedback to Replit** \- ""Don't write that yet. Here are issues to fix: ...""
8. **Iterate until clean** \- Then let Replit write

I'm literally a USB cable between two AI systems that can't talk directly.

**Why This Works**

Claude reads code faster than I ever could. When Replit spits out a 200-line diff, I'd need 10 minutes to properly review it. Claude does it in seconds and catches:

* Typos in variable names
* Off-by-one errors
* Missing null checks
* Violations of patterns Claude knows about from our earlier conversations
* Logic that doesn't match the spec we discussed
* Edge cases we identified that weren't handled

Claude also writes better prompts for Replit than I do. It knows how to be specific in ways that reduce Replit's tendency to make assumptions.

**The Economics**

With this workflow, I'm genuinely getting the output of 4-6 junior developers:

* They write code (Replit)
* A senior dev reviews everything at superhuman speed (Claude)
* I'm the tech lead making decisions and coordinating

What would have taken me years with a small team is happening in months. Not weeks—let's be honest, it's still hard. But months instead of years is transformative.

**What Still Sucks**

* Context limits are real. Long builds require breaking into phases with fresh contexts.
* Replit still forgets architecture constantly. The validation scripts are non-negotiable.
* You can't fully trust ""done."" Always verify.
* The USB-cable workflow is tedious. I dream of the day these systems can talk directly.
* Debugging agent-written code when something subtle is wrong is painful.

**Practical Takeaways**

1. Build validation scripts for your architectural patterns. Run them religiously.
2. Force Q&A before coding. Multiple rounds if needed.
3. Require markdown task files with checkboxes in the repo.
4. Use a smarter AI to review and prompt your coding AI.
5. Never trust ""done."" Verify everything.
6. Expect to iterate. A lot.

The AI isn't replacing developers. It's replacing the *typing*. You still need to architect, review, decide, and verify. But if you set up the right workflow, you can move fast.

Happy to dive deeper into any of these if there's interest. The SAL migration and read-your-writes outbox pattern were probably the most interesting challenges.",5,1765973998.0,replit,0,1.0,False

1pov4io,https://i.redd.it/wknx22nbnq7g1.jpeg,Dev Log Entry #3: 17.12.2025 - Finding the Scribe’s Voice,"Let’s be honest: today was rough, and the headache that came with it wasn’t helping.

But I think this is one of those days that feels like the labor pains of something better being born. I now have three fully revised systems in front of me: the health system, the mental resilience system, and a brand-new experience and skill-acquisition system.

Calling it a “level system” would be inaccurate, because I think I may have accidentally removed the entire concept of leveling from the game.

Sometimes you just flip the table and go radical. I do that a lot.



But none of that was the hard part.



Rewriting these mechanics and finishing the terminology dictionary ate half my day, yes—but the real weight was the realization that, after all this time, I finally know how to present the voice of the scribe who won’t shut up in my head.



As I write this, Affinity is open on my screen; the MasterPage is up. A page the color of ivory—lightly textured, like a traveler’s journal, almost like Tomoe River paper, but rougher. Not the stiff, mass-pressed kind.

More like the kind wrapped in red, tanned hide—a wanderer’s notebook from the 19th-century Orient, made long before machines decided paper should be perfect.

Something between Arthur Morgan’s journal and Leonardo da Vinci’s sketchbooks, but darker, dusted with ash from the Grey Road.



I’m not going for those cliché burnt-edge parchment PDFs you see everywhere.

This journal belongs to someone who took care of it—who protected it.

Someone who writes with a single color of ink because that’s all the world allows.

Someone who sketches in charcoal.

Someone whose pages have stains of tea… or ink… or blood, depending on the night.



That’s the voice I’m bringing forward.

That’s how your notes—from my head, via this fictional scribe—will finally live on the page.



Before I wrap up, I should mention something simple and strangely uplifting: I actually went outside today. Met a friend. Had coffee. Then tea—six or seven glasses, I think—and the conversation drifted into the kind of art philosophy talk that keeps you awake for days.



Gonca and I ended up circling around this idea:

that music and story together can either hold meaning or lead emotion;

that entertainment is undeniably part of art;

but that somewhere deeper, the core of art is sorrow, tragedy, and the ache that makes us human.

Maybe the most emotional works really are the most valuable ones.



I’m ending tonight not with a song, but with something I treasure deeply:

Sir Ian McKellen reading Kurt Vonnegut’s “Make Your Soul Grow.”
