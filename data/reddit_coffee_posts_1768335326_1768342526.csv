As it is important to tend to your mental wellness under those circumstances, my idea of a good life is enjoying a coffee drink in the morning or even in the afternoon, real coffee or substitutes (like instant chicory root). You can still make coffe drinks, with cold (/room temperated) brew and plant milk.

This is my first time posting about anything like this and fair warning its a long story but I will try not to create a post the size of a novel for you. Also I will not be using real names throughout this post.

So going into the past to try and explain the ""ex-friend"" part of this story first I (22F at the time) had a best friend who we will call Kara (20F) so me and Kara knew each other since she was 15 and I was 17 and in that time she dated many boys 1 of which was my younger brother Darren (same age as Kara) and they dated for 2 years but after they broke up as the years passed she would have more and more boyfriends and it got close to like 6 boyfriends in the span of a year I think and she would always say how great the guys are when they date but when they, for me unexpectedly break up she would have all these negative things to say and how they were terrible throughout the relationship. Now at this point and time being told me and Kara were living in my older brother Liams (27yo) house to help him cause he had got that house not long before and we wanted to help him start paying off his new mortgage and bills he just got (its his first house to own) and Kara was dating this guy Tyler (28M) now Tyler at the time was a coworker of mine and Karas and we all worked at the Subway down the road from my brother's house and Liam works at Walmart. All 4 of us were good friends in a sense and I will go ahead and mention (with Tyler's permission) Tyler is not a good man he has a record and was going to court at this time for stealing but he was always very professional at work and always knew how to make someone laugh. Now one night me and Tyler were working the closing shift and after I drove us both to my brother's house after picking up my brother from his work as well (I was the only one at the time with a car cause Tyler's had broken down on the side of the interstate at some point and before he could get someone to get it people had already scavenged it for the fuel tank and the headlights I believe) Tyler was coming over cause he got a text earlier from Kara asking if he could come over, she was the only one home at the time so you can imagine our surprise to find 2 cars in the lawn when we got home at first we were worried someone was robbing the place and when Tyler and Liam went into the house to check things out they found that Kara's family was in the house carrying boxes and loading them into the cars while practically ignoring us now I knew her family but Kara would constantly tell us how her mom and brothers were abusive when nobody was looking and I know one of her brothers cause we went to school together he had a bit of a temper but I've never known him to go that far with anyone and when I would ask her what they would do to her she would roll up her sleeve or her pants and there would be a bruise there and she would say they caused it but a few times she would tell me this I would remember being there on a day she received said bruise and I remembered that one of times she got it from a game of dodgeball at our church and she asked me to help get some frozen peas out of the freezer, and another she got when she went hiking with me and my family through a state park. Both times her family were nowhere around and definitely did not cause the bruise. But now she had invited her family to the house without telling anyone and was having them help her pack her stuff up cause she was moving back in with her mom the whole time they were packing Kara refused to talk to us but right before she left she had written a note for each of us telling us she was leaving and how she loved us all, after they left I went to my room only to find my bedroom door was open and my bedsheets were messed up it didn't look like anything was missing or stolen but I felt violated in a way cause I had no clue who went in my room while I was gone and Kara and her family were here, we hadn't heard from Kara since. Now at the time she left my dad was sick with an extremely rare, extremely aggressive cancer when he was first diagnosed he had went to other doctors before going to the ER for having on and off fever spikes and the other doctors all told he just had the common cold or flu but when he went to the ER with my mom they ran tests and found a lump and if you knew my dad he was always active and took great care of his body he trained for triathlons but mostly ran 5ks he would run, bike, swim and go hiking with the family regularly so we all found it almost impossible to believe that he had such a cancer and when he got the diagnosis the doctors told him even with chemo and treatment they determined he would only live 6 months. Now when Kara left we were 2 months into treatment for my dad and I was doing what I could to help support my mom and take care of my dad and I got my stubbornness from him so it was a hard time convincing him to let me do things for him but as I said I'm as stubborn as he was so it was alot of back and forth. When he finally passed away the doctors told us he would only live for 6 months he survived for 10 months we had a memorial service at his favorite park and we live streamed the memorial over FB for those who couldn't make it in person (Trust me this detail is important). Something else that happened was shortly after my dads passing Tyler was sentenced to 3 years in prison for theft. (Again this detail is important). Now fast forward to present day 3 years had passed since my dad's passing and my mom had just gotten remarried to my stepfather a few months ago, and I haven't seen or heard from Kara since she moved out of my brother's house. I've been working at a small convenience store now for a little over a year and my store is currently being remodeled inside and my boss decided to take me and all my coworkers out to lunch, this also happen to be on the day Tyler was being released from prison and he was with his lawyer going back to my brother's house (that was the plan anyway). Now me and my coworkers arrived at this nice restaurant in our town that my boss reserved a table at, we all sat and ordered drinks and shortly after the waitress left I saw her Kara she was a waitress at another table working at this restaurant, I immediately went back to talking with my coworkers. After we got our drinks and ordered our food me and some of my coworkers noticed 2 police officers walking in and we waved at them to say hi cause alot of the cops in town usually come to our store for coffee and snacks and they came over to say hi and when we asked if they were taking a break right now they said now sadly they were there to talk to someone and as soon as our waitress arrived to refill drinks one of the cops asked if she would get the manager for them, the manager came and talked to them in a different area of the restaurant away from our table not long after our food arrives I happen to glance over where the cops were talking to the manager earlier and saw they were now talking to Kara I had I weird feeling seeing it but decided it wasn't my business and started eating. Me and my coworkers are all laughing and enjoying the food til I heard someone calling out my name loudly, when I looked around to see who it was I saw Kara coming over quickly with the 1 of the cops not far behind while the other was talking on the phone, she then stood beside me and pointed telling the cop ""she knows who I'm talking about don't you?"" As I'm sure you can imagine I was extremely confused on what in the world was going on as I looked between Kara and the cops trying to figure it out, then cop asked me ""do you know her friend and how we can contact him?"" I immediately asked ""what friend? What's going on exactly?"" Kara then started to explain her side of things and apparently the cops were investigating the robbery of some investment firm 4 nights ago and they had some clues that led them to believe Kara had a hand in it and so they came here to see if she had an alibi for that night. She then proceeded to tell me that she was with Tyler that whole night at her house but when the cops asked for his contact info she didn't have it and said she realized she had seen me arrive here and that I could help them get in touch with him. I just looked at her wondering if this was a joke or something but when I realized she was serious I asked her and the cop to be sure they were asking for Tyler to be her alibi 4 nights ago while I know full well he couldn't have been with her cause he only just got out of prison today I couldn't help myself I just started laughing at how ridiculous of a situation Kara had just gotten herself into and how she seems to think that whatever her plan was for this was foolproof. When I finally stopped laughing Kara asked ""what's so funny?"", my phone buzzed from a text from Tyler simply saying his lawyer heard what's happening and they were on the way to the restaurant right now they were 10 mins away, and the other cop who was on phone had put their phone away and walked up to us and whispered something to the other cop, Kara spoke up again telling me to stop laughing like a lunatic and tell the cops what they needed to know I immediately held up a finger to Kara indicating for her to be quiet for a second and decided to play this out a little since shes already making this whole scene in the restaurant and not being quiet about it at all and asked Kara just to clarify that she's saying that Tyler was with her at her house 4 night ago as in before today? And she said ""yes obviously why are you asking that?"" Ignoring her question and asked ""and how long would you say he was at your house that night?"" ""He got there at around 6pm and he left maybe 10am the next morning."" I immediately turned to the cops and asked them for the purpose of dramatic clarification ""so maybe you can clarify something for me cause personally I've never been to prison but it's to my understanding that when serving your sentence that even if it's days before being released that they don't typically let you leave the prison to go and hook up with an ex but maybe I'm wrong."" Karas face went slightly pale as I spoke and said 1 word ""Prison?"" I turned to her and clarified ""yes, prison. He just got released today. So if you are saying he was with you 4 days ago that means your admitting to 1 of 2 things 1.) You're saying that Tyler escaped prison and went to your house Or 2.) You are admitting to falsifying an alibi and lying to the police."" I let that sit for a second just to see if she had some quick save but she just stood there with a mix of shock and apprehensiveness on her face and when she finally opened her mouth to try and speak I held up my finger again for her to wait once again as I noticed something out of the corner of my eye ""you know what? Why don't we just ask him directly?"" I said while pointing to the restaurant entrance where Tyler and his lawyer had just arrived through. Kara looked over and when she looked her face turned into this relieved hopeful look and she hollered out Tyler's name raising her her hand into the air and waving it around like she was trying to get his attention while in the hall of a crowded rock concert and not a peaceful restaurant like this. I looked around and noticed everyone in the restaurant were openly watching us, Tyler noticed the people watching as well as he walked over. He completely ignored Kara and turned to the cops ""I understand you have some questions for me officers."" The cops immediately asked him if he was with Kara 4 nights ago on the night of the robbery and he responded ""No I was not with Kara 4 nights ago. I haven't even spoken to her in 3 years."" I watched as Karas face fell ""Tyler what are you talking about of you were with me we were together all night."" ""No we weren't Kara. And even if I did say we were the cops would be able to tell easily that on the night in question I was most definitely in my prison cell. So even if I did want to save you from this mess which I don't see any reason why I should, why would I do it by telling such an obvious lie?"" Tylers lawyer then pulled out his phone and show it to the cop ""this is an emailed document from the warden of the prison showing that the guards making the rounds that night found nothing out of the ordinary during the night in question and I also asked the warden to have the guards making those rounds to provide written statements declaring that there is in fact no way my client had left the prison at any point in the night in question he with also provide security footage of that night to corroborate their statements they will be emailed to you as early as tomorrow morning."" Kara looked a bit panicked now as she looked between all of us before landing on me ""oh I get it, you and Tyler are dating aren't you that's why he doesn't want to admit it cause you're here and he doesn't want you to know he cheated."" As I'm sure you can imagine the look on my face as I looked at her like she lost her mind I asked her ""Kara, how did you go from Tyler refusing to lie for you to me and him dating? Just so you know no we are NOT dating. And even if we were what does that have to do with any of this?"" Instead of answering Kara just started panicking more and you could clearly tell she was trying to find some way out of the hole she dug herself into. The cops were bringing out their handcuffs and began telling her she needed to come down to the station with them when she once again got this hopeful look on her face but instead of look at Tyler like last time she was looking at me. I felt extremely creeped out at this point. There was no telling what idea just popped in her head and I didn't like how the idea clearly involved me somehow. ""Hey, come on we're best friends. You can help me with this right?"" At this point I started to think she was insane. ""Kara what are you talking about? We USE to be best friends but that changed when you left without saying anything to any of us and cut contact with us for 3 YEARS."" ""Don't be like that we can still be best friends no matter how much time passed."" Then came the last straw for me ""hows your parents doing? I saw on your moms Facebook page she got remarried, to think after the cancer scare she'd divorce your dad. How is he doing after that by the way? He must be glad to be cured right?"" Tyler immediately stepped closer ""Kara enough you went too far."" My coworkers who before were sitting and watching were now also standing and were all looking angerly at Kara. (Just to clarify I love my coworkers they are like a second family to me they are fiercely protective and the only reason they didn't do anything til now was cause they know I can handle myself and even though they weren't there when my dad passed away they all knew how much his death affected me and when they heard Kara talk about my parents like that they knew this was getting to sensitive topics for me and they wanted to try and protect me anyway back to the story.) ""What are you talking about Tyler? I'm just asking how her dad is doing he was diagnosed with cancer and I'm sure it was a tough road for him to being cured."" Now I want to go ahead and mention why it was important before that I mentioned that my dads memorial service was livestreamed. When looking at the livestream after the service I saw that Kara's mother and her brothers had all watched and sent their condolences in the chat her mother also made a point to say that Kara also sends her condolences as she was told by her mother what had happened but she herself did not watch the livestream. Now I started to get a mix of emotions running through me I was sad as memories of my dad came to me, I was annoyed at Kara for ruining this whole day for me, and I was also furious with her for being so insensitive and disrespecting my mom by assuming she only got remarried after divorcing with dad even if she had forgotten about the fact my dad had died she clearly remembers the fact he was diagnosed with cancer so I'm sure she remembers as it was the first thing the doctor said about it was that he only had 6 months even with treatment there wasn't much doubt that no matter how unfair it seemed he was dying and we couldn't do much to stop it, so the fact that she thinks that the only reason my mom would remarry was if she divorced my dad after his ""cancer scare"" as she called it made me want to do a whole lot of things to her, but instead I decided to just set to record straight once and for all. Kara continued talking ""Come on, we all know there's no way his cancer was as bad as the doctors claimed he was too strong and healthy for that. He's cured right, he isn't in hurting anymore?"" ""He's no longer in pain. And he's happy in his new home-"" Kara didn't let me finish what I was about to say ""see I knew he'd make it-"" ""in Heaven"" I cut in finishing my previous sentence. Kara looked pale for a second ""what?"" ""My dad is no longer in pain and he's happy in his new home. In. Heaven."" I repeated. My vision was beginning to blur but as hard as it was I refused to cry in front of her she wasn't worthy of seeing them. ""I know you were there when we first got the news about his cancer. You were there when the doctors said he only had 6 months left, but you were right about 1 thing Kara. He was strong and you were partly right that the doctors were wrong about something involving his diagnosis. They said he only had 6 months he survived for 10 months and it was that strength that allowed him to survive for as long as he did. But I also know you were made aware of the fact he had passed away 3 years ago because you family watched the livestream of his memorial and sent condolences you mom even made a point to say you also send your condolences as she had told you about my dad's death but you didn't attend the livestream or the service at all youself."" It was then my boss spoke up telling the cops they needed to get Kara out of here and away from me. I couldn't hold back the tears for much longer so I ran to the bathrooms which were thankfully empty and ran into a stall and just sat on the floor, not long after all my coworkers both male and female as well as Tyler came into the bathrooms I learned later a waitress as well as a few random customer int he restaurant offered to guard the bathroom to make sure nobody came in while there were guys in the womens bathroom, the restaurant also have a family bathroom area so if a woman need to use it they could. They came in and all sat down on the floor around and surrounded me in this group hug, I cried for what felt like forever but I think was actually like 20 minutes. Afterwards Tyler and his lawyer offered to give me a ride back to my brother's house since that's where we were planning to go from the start. I felt exhausted from all the crying as well as everything that happened. When we got to my brother's I went to go and lay down on the couch hoping to at least take a nap. But apparently life had other plans. As soon as I laid down my phone started to blow up with texts from Kara as well as her family. From what I gathered Kara was trying to beg for forgiveness while her mom and brothers were texting calling me an AH for lying to police and getting Kara in trouble. I couldn't be bothered to deal with it so I just put my phone on silent and took a nap.

I’ve been dealing with nausea, diarrhea, acid reflux, bloating and random vomiting in the middle of the night on and off for a few weeks. It’s usually triggered by eating anything acidic or fried. I woke up this morning at 5 feeling a little nauseous but figured it was because I was up all night with my toddler. By 10am I was so nauseous I had to call a sitter to come take care of my daughter. I’ve spent the entire day in bed with extreme nausea and cramps. I also feel a little light headed but that could be due to my period. I haven’t been able to eat. I can drink water with no issue. I finally threw up a few minutes ago and it was a green color with what looked like black pepper in it.  My sweet son came flying into the bathroom and flushed the toilet for me before I got a chance to take a full picture, but I do have some photos of what was leftover after the flush. I feel a lot better after vomiting but I still feel a little woozy and light headed. Temp is 100.7. My husband is out of town so heading to the ER with my kids would be a nightmare, especially with all of the flu and Covid cases in our area right now. Is this considered coffee ground vomit?

1qc50nd,https://www.reddit.com/r/neighborsfromhell/comments/1qc50nd/my_older_neighbour_asked_for_my_phone_number_has/,My older neighbour asked for my phone number & has been a nuisance ever since,"She's 60 & a bit of a gossip, always out tending her garden & if anyone walks by she talks. She's a talker, likes a gossip.  
  
During COVID she asked for my phone number & said we should go for coffee. But when I told her I didn't know my number (new number) and didn't have my phone on me, she seemed quite offended. She's in her 60s so seemed harmless & up to that point I saw no issues. So I bent & said, I'll pop my number through your door.   
  
Cut a long story short we kept saying we'll got for coffee but never did. But would chat in the street friendly. Then one day I made a joke about - we'll get that imaginary coffee one day. But again, I offended her. She didn't speak to me for months & we just avoided each other. I was quietly relieved.   
  
Then she just popped up a few months later & started talking like nothing happened. I found it strange, but I was polite & did the neighbourly thing when I saw her.  She started to tell me her ex boyfriend was taking her on holiday for her birthday. We spoke about this each time we bumped into each other & it turns out this guy was keen on getting back together but she was not. I said, just be careful, because if expects anything more it could get awkward & that isn't an easy situation to deal with when you're on holiday together. She laughed this advice off. Anyway, she gets back from the holiday & they've had a huge bust up because he wanted more... I said 'this is what I feared' & it offended her, she walks off & doesn't speak to me for 6 months. 

Again, she randomly starts speaking, its her pattern, but this time shes asking intrusive questions about my health, relationships etc etc. I was being polite up to a point, she's an old woman. But the last time we spoke she was laughing whilst asking really intrusive questions about my health at a time I was visibly sick. I'd had enough of her by this point & called her out, I then told her not to speak to me anymore. She did not like & gasped with an open mouth. And her reply....  After muttering a few things, she said ""I'll speak to you another time then"". Which signalled to me she was going to try again in 6 months LOL 

So its been 6 months & we've successfully ignored each other since. Until tonight.  
  
She's standing right outside my house & when I walk out she looks me up & down - I assume I have food on me or something, so look at myself, nothing. I look back at her & she does it again. I ask her 'what are you looking at?' and she begins shouting 'What', 'WHAT' - I'm crossing the road to get away from her & she pivoting to stare at me. Shrugging her shoulders & throwing her hands up in the air whilst shouting what. 

She's not physically threatening because she's in her 60s (if she was more able, I would be worried), but I do find her to be very manipulative & quite provocative.  She does not respect boundaries even when they are clearly expressed. 

I understand this is all fairly minor, but she makes me feel uneasy. 

Is this lady baby reindeering me or something? lol.

1qc50fr,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1qc50fr/i_went_to_fix_up_my_grandparents_lake_cabin/,I Went to Fix Up My Grandparents’ Lake Cabin. Something Crawled Out of the Water.,"The key to the cabin was still on the same ring my grandpa used to keep on his belt, except now it lived in a padded envelope with my name on it and a sticky note that said “Hope you can do something with the place.”

My aunt’s handwriting.

I almost didn’t come.

Not because I was scared of the woods or the lake. Because I was scared of the feelings. The kind that show up when you’re alone with someone else’s old life and you start finding the little dents where they stood.

But the cabin had been sitting for two years, and “sitting” is how places die.

So I took three days off work, loaded my truck with a tool bag, a case of bottled water, a cheap cooler, and the kind of optimism you only have when you haven’t arrived yet.

The driveway wasn’t a driveway anymore. It was two muddy ruts and grass tall enough to slap my door handles. I got out twice to move fallen branches. The third time I got out, I stopped and just stared.

The cabin was there, but it looked like it had been turned down to low brightness. Faded siding. Dark windows. The porch sagging slightly, like it was tired.

And behind it, the lake.

It was the reason my grandparents bought the place, and it still did the same thing it always did. It sat there looking calm while it swallowed every sound you made.

No motorboats. No kids. No one shouting from a dock. Just water and wind and the thin ticking of insects.

I killed the engine and listened. A loon called somewhere out on the lake, that long hollow sound that always makes your stomach go a little tight even when you’re not in a horror story.

I walked up to the porch and slid the key in.

The lock fought me for a second like it didn’t recognize me anymore, then gave.

Inside, the cabin smelled like cold wood, dust, and something faintly sweet that I couldn’t place at first. Then I realized it was old cedar. My grandma used to tuck cedar blocks into drawers like she was warding off time itself.

The living room was the same layout, even with the furniture covered in sheets. Couch on the left. Little lamp table. Wood stove in the corner with a rusted kettle on top. My grandpa’s fishing rods still leaned against the wall by the back door, their line limp and slack like veins.

I did what you do when you’re trying not to get hit by memory.

I got practical.

I opened windows to air it out. I checked for obvious water damage. I walked the floor, listening for soft spots. I found mouse droppings in the pantry and swore quietly, because of course.

There was no power. The old electric meter box outside had been pulled years ago, which my aunt had mentioned in her note like it was just a normal detail, like “oh yeah, by the way, the cabin is fully dead.”

Fine. I had lanterns. I had a headlamp. I had one of those battery packs you can jump a car with that also runs a USB.

I set up my little camp stove on the porch and boiled water for instant coffee, the kind my grandpa used to drink because “coffee doesn’t need to be fancy.”

While it brewed, I walked down to the shoreline.

The dock was in pieces. Not completely destroyed, but the far end had broken and dipped into the water at a permanent angle. The boards near shore were gray and rough, sun-bleached and split. A few old nails stuck up like teeth. The lake water lapped at it softly.

The water was dark. Not “murky,” just deep. You could see maybe a foot down near shore where the stones were, and then it went black like someone spilled ink.

I squatted and ran my fingers through the pebbles, more habit than anything. There were bottle caps and old hooks mixed in. A broken plastic bobber. Little relics.

Then I saw the first thing that didn’t fit.

On the wet sand just above the waterline, there were drag marks.

They weren’t footprints. More like two long parallel smears, as if something had pulled itself out of the water and then slid back in. The sand between the smears was pressed down, smooth.

I stared at it for longer than I should have. My brain ran through options. Log. Branch. Someone dragging a kayak.

Except there was no kayak, and the marks weren’t fresh-fresh. They were damp but starting to dry at the edges, like they’d been made earlier in the day.

I told myself it was a turtle. A big snapping turtle maybe. People always underestimate those. They’re basically prehistoric anger with legs.

I stood up, washed my hands in the lake, and went back up to the cabin.

Work makes you brave in a stupid way. It convinces you you’re in control because you’re measuring and cutting and moving things.

I spent the afternoon ripping up warped porch boards and replacing them with new ones I’d hauled in. I patched a corner of the screen on the porch where it had torn. I cleared leaves out of the gutter channel so rain had somewhere to go besides directly into the porch ceiling.

I found a coffee tin in the kitchen with my grandma’s handwriting on it. SUGAR. I opened it without thinking.

It wasn’t sugar anymore. It was clumped and yellow and smelled off.

I shut it and left it on the counter like I was leaving her a message: I saw it. I remember.

Around sunset, I ate a sandwich on the porch and watched the lake go flat. The surface turned into a mirror of bruised purple sky. The tree line on the opposite shore became one solid black shape.

That’s when the noises started.

The first one was faint. A wet slap, somewhere near the dock. The kind of sound you hear when a fish jumps, but heavier. More deliberate.

I leaned forward, elbows on knees, looking at the water.

Nothing broke the surface. No ripples, no circles spreading out.

A minute later, I heard it again.

Wet slap.

Then a dragging sound, like something rough being pulled over stones.

I sat up.

“Okay,” I muttered, to nobody, because talking out loud keeps you sane for one more minute.

I grabbed my headlamp off the porch table and shined it down toward the shoreline.

The beam caught the dock boards, the rocks, the reeds. Everything looked exactly the same, just brighter and more suspicious.

Nothing moved.

The air got colder fast, and the insects ramped up like a static layer in the background. I went inside, shut the door, and latched it.

I didn’t latch it because I thought something would open it. I latched it because my grandpa always latched it at night, and my hands did what his hands used to do.

I set up on the couch again because the bedroom smelled like closed drawers and old fabric. The couch smelled like dust and cedar, which I could handle.

Around 11:30, I was half asleep when the porch creaked.

One slow, heavy groan.

Not the normal “wood settling” creak. This was weight. The board giving slightly under something.

I sat up, heart kicking.

The porch creaked again.

Then I heard a soft tapping, right near the screen door.

Tap. Tap.

Not random. Not wind.

Like knuckles, if knuckles were wet.

I stared at the living room window, which looked out onto the porch. The glass reflected my own face back at me, pale in lantern light.

The tapping stopped.

I waited, frozen.

Then came a different sound. A scraping along the porch screen. Slow. Patient. Like someone dragging a nail across mesh.

My mouth went dry.

I turned the lantern down and clicked my headlamp on low, keeping the beam pointed at the floor. I moved to the living room window and leaned close enough that my breath fogged the glass.

I angled the headlamp up slightly.

The porch was empty.

The screen door was closed. The patched section I’d stapled earlier was still tight.

But on the porch boards, right in front of the screen door, there was something that wasn’t there earlier.

A wet streak.

Like a thick smear of lake water mixed with mud.

It glistened in my headlamp beam.

And it smelled through the glass. Faintly, but enough.

Fish. Wet stone. A sharp metallic edge underneath it.

The scraping started again, closer now, right on the screen door.

I stepped back so fast I bumped the chair.

The scraping stopped instantly, as if whatever was out there had heard the sound and decided it had confirmed something.

Then, from somewhere down near the dock, came another wet slap.

I didn’t sleep much after that. I lay on the couch, headlamp off, lantern turned low, listening to the cabin settle and the lake make its quiet noises. Every creak made my muscles tighten.

Sometime after 2 a.m., I heard something slide along the side of the cabin.

Not footsteps. Not paws.

A low, smooth drag, like a heavy bag being pulled slowly across wet leaves.

It stopped under the kitchen window.

I held my breath.

Then came a sound that made my stomach turn.

A soft clicking, fast and rhythmic. Like someone tapping their tongue against their teeth. Like a throat trying to make words and failing.

It went on for a few seconds, then stopped.

The silence afterward felt like pressure in my ears.

Morning came gray and cold. I made coffee and forced myself to step outside because I refused to be the guy scared of his own porch.

The wet streak was still there, dried slightly now, leaving a faint crusty outline.

And at the bottom of the porch steps, in the muddy patch near the foundation, were marks.

Not prints. Not claws.

Impressions like the edge of a shovel, pressed into mud in a repeating pattern. Parallel ridges. As if something had braced itself there.

I stood in the yard, coffee going cold in my hand, and tried to be normal.

“Turtle,” I said out loud, even though it didn’t sound convincing. “Big turtle.”

I worked anyway.

That day I replaced two broken window panes with plastic sheeting, stapled tight. I cleared vines off the side of the cabin. I found the old generator shed and opened it.

The generator was gone. Just an empty concrete pad and a few rust stains.

I found an old tackle box under the porch, the kind with trays. It was empty except for one thing: a folded, yellowed piece of paper.

A handwritten note from my grandpa. Not for me. Probably for my grandma.

“Don’t go down to the inlet at night. Don’t leave the fish on the porch. If you hear it clicking, come inside.”

That was it. No explanation. No signature. Just those lines, written like he didn’t want to waste ink.

My stomach went cold in a clean, simple way.

There was an inlet.

On the far side of the property, where the lake narrowed and fed into a little creek. The place I’d noticed was clogged with branches.

I stood there for a long time with that note in my hand.

My grandpa wasn’t the kind of man who wrote spooky warnings. He was the kind of man who fixed screens, sharpened hooks, and treated problems like they were solvable if you were stubborn enough.

So why had he written this?

That afternoon I drove into town and bought two more motion lights, extra batteries, and one of those heavy-duty door bars people use in hotels. The guy at the register asked if I was “up at the lake cabins.”

I nodded.

He said, “Watch the waterline. It’s been weird.”

He said it casually, like he was talking about algae.

“What does that mean?” I asked.

He shrugged. “People hear things. Something’s been dragging up fish. Probably just a big snapping turtle.”

He smiled when he said snapping turtle, like that was the punchline.

I didn’t smile back.

That night I set the motion lights facing the porch and the side yard, angled toward the shoreline. I barred the front door from the inside. I kept my headlamp around my neck and a hatchet within arm’s reach.

I know how that sounds. But I wasn’t sitting there like a hunter. I was sitting there like someone waiting for a noise you can’t unhear.

At 10:47, the porch motion light clicked on.

Bright white light flooded the porch, turning the screen door into a pale rectangle.

I sat up.

The porch looked empty.

The light stayed on for maybe fifteen seconds, then clicked off.

A minute later, it clicked on again.

Empty again.

Then the side yard motion light clicked on too, washing the grass and the base of the cabin in harsh light.

Still nothing visible.

It felt like something was testing the angles, moving just out of the sensor range, leaning in and out like a kid playing with a flashlight beam.

My throat tightened.

Then the porch light clicked on and stayed on.

I got up slow and moved to the living room window, keeping my body low and my headlamp off so I didn’t reflect myself.

The porch looked empty.

But the screen door mesh… it was bowed inward slightly.

Like something was pressed against it on the outside.

I leaned closer.

A shape moved in the glow, low to the boards.

Not a raccoon. Too big. Too smooth.

It slid forward, and for one clean second, it lifted its head into the light.

It looked like a lizard. That was my first thought, and I hate how simple that sounds, because nothing about it felt simple.

It was the size of a large dog, but built wrong for land. Heavy body, belly low. Skin dark and ridged in overlapping plates that shone wet under the motion light. Along its neck and down its spine were pale frills, translucent like thin rubber, fluttering slightly as if they were sensing vibrations more than wind.

Its head was broad and flat. Eyes small and set back, reflecting dullly. Mouth too wide, the corners pulled back farther than they should have been.

It stared through the screen door like it understood doors.

Then it clicked.

Fast and wet, a rapid series of sounds that made my teeth ache.

I stepped back involuntarily, and the floor creaked.

The creature’s head snapped toward the sound.

It moved closer to the screen door in one smooth surge, faster than its body looked like it should move.

The screen door bowed inward.

Then came a heavy thump as it hit the screen.

The latch held, but the entire frame rattled.

I backed up to the kitchen, grabbed my phone, and saw I had two bars of service.

I should’ve called 911 right then.

Instead, I did the stupidest thing I’ve ever done, because I had my grandpa’s note in my pocket like a challenge.

I grabbed the hatchet and my headlamp, unlocked the porch door behind the screen door, and told myself, out loud, “Just scare it off.”

The moment I cracked the inner door, the smell hit me.

Fish and wet stone, and that sharp metallic edge like blood on pennies.

The creature was no longer on the screen.

The porch was empty.

The motion light stayed on, illuminating nothing but the wet streaks on the boards.

I stepped onto the porch anyway, because my brain had already committed, and backing down felt worse than moving forward.

My headlamp beam swept down to the steps, then to the ground.

Nothing.

Then I heard it from below.

Not on the porch. Under it.

A sliding sound through damp leaves, low and close.

I turned my headlamp toward the shoreline and caught movement between the rocks.

It rose out of the shallows slowly, water sheeting off its back.

It had been waiting where the light couldn’t reach.

It launched.

It didn’t run. It exploded forward in a sudden burst of muscle and wet force, hitting the bottom porch steps and coming up fast.

I swung the hatchet. Not skillfully, not like I knew what I was doing. Pure reflex.

The blade glanced off a ridge on its shoulder with a hard, dull clack that sent shock through my arms.

It snapped at me.

Its jaws opened wider than they should have. The hinge flexed like rubber. Rows of small needle-like teeth sat farther back than I expected, like something built to grip and pull, not chew.

It clamped onto my left forearm.

Pain detonated. Hot and immediate. Like a vise with knives inside it.

I screamed and slammed the hatchet handle into its head, not the blade, just blunt impact.

It released with a wet pop and jerked back, clicking rapidly, agitated.

Blood ran down my wrist into my palm. My fingers tingled and went half-numb.

It lunged again.

I stumbled backward off the porch steps. My heel caught the edge. I fell hard into the dirt, shoulder first. The world spun. My headlamp beam went wild, slicing ferns and tree trunks and the side of the cabin.

The creature came down after me.

Low and fast.

Before I could get up, it raked across my ribs with those blunt nails, tearing through my shirt in parallel lines.

It wasn’t a deep cinematic slash. It was worse in a different way. Multiple shallow tears that burned instantly and started to bleed, like the skin had been peeled open.

I kicked. My boot connected with its jaw and it clicked louder, snapping.

Then it bit my boot and yanked.

My ankle rolled sideways in the dirt. A bright sick pain shot up my leg.

I made a sound that didn’t feel human.

The creature released my boot and lifted its head, tilting like it was deciding where to bite next.

In the headlamp glow, I could see its throat moving as it clicked, and I could see the frills along its neck fluttering as if they were tasting the air.

I grabbed a fistful of gravel and threw it at its eyes.

It flinched. Not much. But enough.

I crawled backward on my good leg, dragging the bad one, leaving a smear in the dirt. I hit the porch steps and hauled myself up, hands slipping on wet boards, wet from it and wet from me.

I got inside and slammed the inner door, then the screen door, then locked both with shaking hands.

The creature hit the screen door once, hard, rattling the frame.

Then it went still.

I stood in the kitchen, blood dripping onto the old linoleum, ribs on fire, arm throbbing, ankle screaming, and I waited for the next slam.

Instead, I heard the clicking again, slower now, almost thoughtful.

Then the porch motion light clicked off.

Darkness returned like someone turned the world back down.

I didn’t stay to see what it would do next.

I grabbed my keys, phone, and nothing else. I didn’t pack. I didn’t think. I limped out the front door, not the porch, and staggered toward my truck.

The yard felt huge. The lake felt closer than it should.

Behind me, I heard the wet sliding sound again.

Not rushing.

Following.

I made it to the truck, fumbled my keys, dropped them, found them, got the door open, and threw myself into the driver’s seat.

My ribs screamed when I twisted. My ankle screamed when I pressed the pedal.

I started the engine and the headlights washed the cabin in white.

The porch motion light clicked on again.

And there it was, halfway up the porch steps, crouched in the pool of light, watching my truck like it was memorizing the shape of it.

It didn’t charge. It didn’t panic.

It just watched.

I reversed hard enough to spray gravel, then drove until pavement showed up under my tires and the trees thinned.

That’s when I noticed the smell hadn’t stayed at the cabin.

It was in my truck.

Fish and wet stone, faint but real, coming off my clothes and the inside of the cab like I’d brought the shoreline with me.

At a stop sign under a streetlight, I looked down and saw a dark smear on the rubber floor mat by the pedals.

Not mud. Not just water.

Something thicker, with a slight sheen to it.

And embedded in it, like it had been pressed there when I stomped the brake, was a small, dark piece of something hard.

A scale.

That’s the only word I have for it. Oval, ridged, about the size of my thumbnail. Dark as bottle glass. It caught the streetlight and reflected it dully, like it didn’t want to be noticed.

I stared at it until someone honked behind me and I jerked forward, heart hammering all over again.

At urgent care, I told them I fell and got bitten by “an animal.” I let them make their own mental picture. I didn’t say lake. I didn’t say lizard. I said animal because I wanted stitches, not a lecture.

They cleaned the bite, stitched it, wrapped my ribs, and put my ankle in a boot.

When the nurse irrigated the bite, she paused and frowned.

“What is that?” she asked.

She leaned closer with forceps and pinched something out of the wound. It made my stomach flip.

She dropped it into a little metal tray.

It wasn’t gravel. Not exactly.

It looked like a tiny black sliver, hard and ridged, like a fragment of nail or scale. Wet. Dark. Wrong in the fluorescent light.

“Probably debris,” she said, but her voice didn’t sound convinced.

I didn’t answer.

A week later, I went back in daylight with two friends, a proper first aid kit, and a plan: board it up and get out.

The porch looked normal in sunlight. The cabin looked tired, not haunted.

But the porch boards had long, shallow grooves in them near the steps, like something with weight and ridged skin had gripped and pulled itself up repeatedly.

And on the kitchen table, where I’d left my tool bag, there was a dried wet streak. Fishy. Metallic.

Beside it, pressed faintly into the wood, were parallel ridge marks.

Like the edge of a shovel.

Like the impressions in the mud.

My friend joked, “Snapping turtle,” and laughed.

I didn’t laugh.

Because the drag marks on the shoreline were there again, fresh, leading from the water straight up toward the porch steps.

And the creek mouth on the far side of the property, the inlet my grandpa warned about, looked more clogged than before.

Like something had been pushing branches into place.

Like a door being shut.

And before we left, I checked my truck floor mat.

The smear by the pedals had dried into a dark crust.

Something Crawled Out of the Water.,"The key to the cabin was still on the same ring my grandpa used to keep on his belt, except now it lived in a padded envelope with my name on it and a sticky note that said “Hope you can do something with the place.”

My aunt’s handwriting.

I almost didn’t come.

Not because I was scared of the woods or the lake. Because I was scared of the feelings. The kind that show up when you’re alone with someone else’s old life and you start finding the little dents where they stood.

But the cabin had been sitting for two years, and “sitting” is how places die.

So I took three days off work, loaded my truck with a tool bag, a case of bottled water, a cheap cooler, and the kind of optimism you only have when you haven’t arrived yet.

The driveway wasn’t a driveway anymore. It was two muddy ruts and grass tall enough to slap my door handles. I got out twice to move fallen branches. The third time I got out, I stopped and just stared.

The cabin was there, but it looked like it had been turned down to low brightness. Faded siding. Dark windows. The porch sagging slightly, like it was tired.

And behind it, the lake.

It was the reason my grandparents bought the place, and it still did the same thing it always did. It sat there looking calm while it swallowed every sound you made.

No motorboats. No kids. No one shouting from a dock. Just water and wind and the thin ticking of insects.

I killed the engine and listened. A loon called somewhere out on the lake, that long hollow sound that always makes your stomach go a little tight even when you’re not in a horror story.

I walked up to the porch and slid the key in.

The lock fought me for a second like it didn’t recognize me anymore, then gave.

Inside, the cabin smelled like cold wood, dust, and something faintly sweet that I couldn’t place at first. Then I realized it was old cedar. My grandma used to tuck cedar blocks into drawers like she was warding off time itself.

The living room was the same layout, even with the furniture covered in sheets. Couch on the left. Little lamp table. Wood stove in the corner with a rusted kettle on top. My grandpa’s fishing rods still leaned against the wall by the back door, their line limp and slack like veins.

I did what you do when you’re trying not to get hit by memory.

I got practical.

I opened windows to air it out. I checked for obvious water damage. I walked the floor, listening for soft spots. I found mouse droppings in the pantry and swore quietly, because of course.

There was no power. The old electric meter box outside had been pulled years ago, which my aunt had mentioned in her note like it was just a normal detail, like “oh yeah, by the way, the cabin is fully dead.”

Fine. I had lanterns. I had a headlamp. I had one of those battery packs you can jump a car with that also runs a USB.

I set up my little camp stove on the porch and boiled water for instant coffee, the kind my grandpa used to drink because “coffee doesn’t need to be fancy.”

While it brewed, I walked down to the shoreline.

The dock was in pieces. Not completely destroyed, but the far end had broken and dipped into the water at a permanent angle. The boards near shore were gray and rough, sun-bleached and split. A few old nails stuck up like teeth. The lake water lapped at it softly.

The water was dark. Not “murky,” just deep. You could see maybe a foot down near shore where the stones were, and then it went black like someone spilled ink.

I squatted and ran my fingers through the pebbles, more habit than anything. There were bottle caps and old hooks mixed in. A broken plastic bobber. Little relics.

Then I saw the first thing that didn’t fit.

On the wet sand just above the waterline, there were drag marks.

They weren’t footprints. More like two long parallel smears, as if something had pulled itself out of the water and then slid back in. The sand between the smears was pressed down, smooth.

I stared at it for longer than I should have. My brain ran through options. Log. Branch. Someone dragging a kayak.

Except there was no kayak, and the marks weren’t fresh-fresh. They were damp but starting to dry at the edges, like they’d been made earlier in the day.

I told myself it was a turtle. A big snapping turtle maybe. People always underestimate those. They’re basically prehistoric anger with legs.

I stood up, washed my hands in the lake, and went back up to the cabin.

Work makes you brave in a stupid way. It convinces you you’re in control because you’re measuring and cutting and moving things.

I spent the afternoon ripping up warped porch boards and replacing them with new ones I’d hauled in. I patched a corner of the screen on the porch where it had torn. I cleared leaves out of the gutter channel so rain had somewhere to go besides directly into the porch ceiling.

I found a coffee tin in the kitchen with my grandma’s handwriting on it. SUGAR. I opened it without thinking.

It wasn’t sugar anymore. It was clumped and yellow and smelled off.

I shut it and left it on the counter like I was leaving her a message: I saw it. I remember.

I stepped onto the porch anyway, because my brain had already committed, and backing down felt worse than moving forward.

My headlamp beam swept down to the steps, then to the ground.

Nothing.

Then I heard it from below.

Not on the porch. Under it.

A sliding sound through damp leaves, low and close.

I turned my headlamp toward the shoreline and caught movement between the rocks.

It rose out of the shallows slowly, water sheeting off its back.

It had been waiting where the light couldn’t reach.

It launched.

It didn’t run. It exploded forward in a sudden burst of muscle and wet force, hitting the bottom porch steps and coming up fast.

I swung the hatchet. Not skillfully, not like I knew what I was doing. Pure reflex.

The blade glanced off a ridge on its shoulder with a hard, dull clack that sent shock through my arms.

It snapped at me.

Its jaws opened wider than they should have. The hinge flexed like rubber. Rows of small needle-like teeth sat farther back than I expected, like something built to grip and pull, not chew.

It clamped onto my left forearm.

Pain detonated. Hot and immediate. Like a vise with knives inside it.

I screamed and slammed the hatchet handle into its head, not the blade, just blunt impact.

It released with a wet pop and jerked back, clicking rapidly, agitated.

Blood ran down my wrist into my palm. My fingers tingled and went half-numb.

It lunged again.

I stumbled backward off the porch steps. My heel caught the edge. I fell hard into the dirt, shoulder first. The world spun. My headlamp beam went wild, slicing ferns and tree trunks and the side of the cabin.

The creature came down after me.

Low and fast.

Before I could get up, it raked across my ribs with those blunt nails, tearing through my shirt in parallel lines.

It wasn’t a deep cinematic slash. It was worse in a different way. Multiple shallow tears that burned instantly and started to bleed, like the skin had been peeled open.

I kicked. My boot connected with its jaw and it clicked louder, snapping.

Then it bit my boot and yanked.

My ankle rolled sideways in the dirt. A bright sick pain shot up my leg.

I made a sound that didn’t feel human.

The creature released my boot and lifted its head, tilting like it was deciding where to bite next.

In the headlamp glow, I could see its throat moving as it clicked, and I could see the frills along its neck fluttering as if they were tasting the air.

I grabbed a fistful of gravel and threw it at its eyes.

It flinched. Not much. But enough.

I crawled backward on my good leg, dragging the bad one, leaving a smear in the dirt. I hit the porch steps and hauled myself up, hands slipping on wet boards, wet from it and wet from me.

I got inside and slammed the inner door, then the screen door, then locked both with shaking hands.

The creature hit the screen door once, hard, rattling the frame.

Then it went still.

I stood in the kitchen, blood dripping onto the old linoleum, ribs on fire, arm throbbing, ankle screaming, and I waited for the next slam.

Instead, I heard the clicking again, slower now, almost thoughtful.

Then the porch motion light clicked off.

Darkness returned like someone turned the world back down.

I didn’t stay to see what it would do next.

I grabbed my keys, phone, and nothing else. I didn’t pack. I didn’t think. I limped out the front door, not the porch, and staggered toward my truck.

The yard felt huge. The lake felt closer than it should.

Behind me, I heard the wet sliding sound again.

Not rushing.

Following.

I made it to the truck, fumbled my keys, dropped them, found them, got the door open, and threw myself into the driver’s seat.

My ribs screamed when I twisted. My ankle screamed when I pressed the pedal.

I started the engine and the headlights washed the cabin in white.

The porch motion light clicked on again.

And there it was, halfway up the porch steps, crouched in the pool of light, watching my truck like it was memorizing the shape of it.

It didn’t charge. It didn’t panic.

It just watched.

I reversed hard enough to spray gravel, then drove until pavement showed up under my tires and the trees thinned.

That’s when I noticed the smell hadn’t stayed at the cabin.

It was in my truck.

Fish and wet stone, faint but real, coming off my clothes and the inside of the cab like I’d brought the shoreline with me.

At a stop sign under a streetlight, I looked down and saw a dark smear on the rubber floor mat by the pedals.

Not mud. Not just water.

Something thicker, with a slight sheen to it.

And embedded in it, like it had been pressed there when I stomped the brake, was a small, dark piece of something hard.

A scale.

That’s the only word I have for it. Oval, ridged, about the size of my thumbnail. Dark as bottle glass. It caught the streetlight and reflected it dully, like it didn’t want to be noticed.

I stared at it until someone honked behind me and I jerked forward, heart hammering all over again.

At urgent care, I told them I fell and got bitten by “an animal.” I let them make their own mental picture. I didn’t say lake. I didn’t say lizard. I said animal because I wanted stitches, not a lecture.

They cleaned the bite, stitched it, wrapped my ribs, and put my ankle in a boot.

When the nurse irrigated the bite, she paused and frowned.

“What is that?” she asked.

She leaned closer with forceps and pinched something out of the wound. It made my stomach flip.

She dropped it into a little metal tray.

It wasn’t gravel. Not exactly.

It looked like a tiny black sliver, hard and ridged, like a fragment of nail or scale. Wet. Dark. Wrong in the fluorescent light.

“Probably debris,” she said, but her voice didn’t sound convinced.

I didn’t answer.

A week later, I went back in daylight with two friends, a proper first aid kit, and a plan: board it up and get out.

The porch looked normal in sunlight. The cabin looked tired, not haunted.

But the porch boards had long, shallow grooves in them near the steps, like something with weight and ridged skin had gripped and pulled itself up repeatedly.

And on the kitchen table, where I’d left my tool bag, there was a dried wet streak. Fishy. Metallic.

Beside it, pressed faintly into the wood, were parallel ridge marks.

Like the edge of a shovel.

Like the impressions in the mud.

My friend joked, “Snapping turtle,” and laughed.

I didn’t laugh.

Because the drag marks on the shoreline were there again, fresh, leading from the water straight up toward the porch steps.

And the creek mouth on the far side of the property, the inlet my grandpa warned about, looked more clogged than before.

Like something had been pushing branches into place.

Like a door being shut.

And before we left, I checked my truck floor mat.

The smear by the pedals had dried into a dark crust.

Is there a way to make this work?,"**TLDR; I 21F have been dating my 28M boyfriend for around 4 months (1 month long distance).I feel neglected in the relationship because our text conversations are very short (sometimes we only have sex-related chats), we rarely call and sometimes he doesn't show interest towards me. He brings up his ex a lot and makes me feell like I am being way too needy. Whenever I express my needs, he says he’ll change, but nothing really does. I really care about him and want to try to make this work, but I’m tired of feeling like I’m asking for too much.**

I 21F have been dating my 28M boyfriend for around 4months (1 month long distance). Some context: we live in neighbouring countries, I met him while studying a semester abroad. At first I wasn't really looking for anything serious because I got hurt by another guy I was seeing earlier last year and because I wasn't sure long distance was for me, but over time I fell for him and we made it official.

Relevant details: he works 4 hours in the morning (9-1 in the beginning, now it's 7-11) and 4 hours in the afternoon/night (6-9) and is doing his masters, he graduates in May. He also lives with some relatives that constantly ask him for help (which also takes away some of his free time). I am still doing my bachelor's and I graduate in about 1-1.5 years.

When we lived in the same city, we saw each other around once a week (last 2 weeks 2-3 times). He did treat me nicely, was respecful, sometimes stayed with me until 4am and will give me small gifts (like coffee and such); I always tried to make sure he felt loved and respected, I gifted him a couple things and helped him when he needed help with writing his final essay. However, there were some things that made me feel he wasn't as intereseted as he said: he will frequently cancel dates last minute, he will take too long to respond to my texts or wouldn't return calls. I always gave him the benefit of the doubt because I know he's busy and tired, but it was quite frustrating for me. He never formally asked me to be his girlfriend, he just started introducing me as his girlfriend and later asked if that was okay.

When we said goodbye we both agreed that we will keep dating long distance and make effort to close the gap eventually, we talked about me moving with him once I finished my degree.

Now we have been dating long distance for 1 month and things have not been the best. Sometimes he takes way too long to respond to texts and sometimes he responds immediately but just short texts. He said we could do calls 3 times a week. But we have only called 3 times in a month and I am the only one taking initiative to organize this calls. We even got into an argument the first time because he promised to call, he forgot to do it on time, I had to call him and the call ended abruptly because apparently he ran out of battery. We talked it out and he promised to change but I haven't seen any improvement. Our text conversations are often very short, and lately many of them are mostly sex-related, which makes me feel like that’s the main reason he wants to talk to me. We haven't videocalled once.

Another issue is that I feel like he still has feelings or misses his ex. They dated for around 4.5 years and broke up 3 years ago. They were also doing long distance and he broke up with her due to toxic behavior, he told me she contacted him 2 years after they broke up to get back together but he declined. However, he talks about her often and I can't help to compare myself with her, because he said they facetimed and texted frequently, gave her flowers, visited her, etc. I understand he had more free time back then and that she lived closer to his city (we’re about 11 hours apart by car), but it still makes me feel insecure. He even told me she contacted him after seeing a picture of us together, and that he talked to her about me, which made me uncomfortable. I can’t help feeling like he loved her more than he’ll ever love me. I did talk about my ex, but it was to mention things that he did that hurt me that I wouldn't want him to do (my ex was texting other girls behind my back).

I’m starting to lose feelings and no longer fully believe him when he says he loves me. I don’t know if things will improve once he graduates and has more free time, or if I’m just holding onto something that isn’t working.

1qc4ydk,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlliedHealthProsAusNZ/comments/1qc4ydk/interviews/,Interviews,"Hey everyone, I’m a radiographer who started out in the 90’s. I have interviewed lots of radiographers, and being the independent for lots of interviews for nurses, pharmacists, OTs, physiotherapists etc. In last 18 months I have witnessed some truly awful interviews/ applications and thought I would offer some advice. 

1. Research the job, google the workplace, read what they do, who the are and where they are. 

2. Reach out to the contact person in the advertisement. Ask about the job. How many staff, what is the work like, what are the staff like and most importantly what are they looking for? It really shows interest to the employer. You will get positive bias nearly every time. You also get the vibe of the place and inside knowledge by ringing and asking questions. 

3. Resume - no AI- yes we can tell. Promote yourself honestly. If I read another new graduate application how you  practically  ran the physiotherapy department or completely stopped over use of antibiotics in a city based pharmacy on a six week clinical practice I will scream. Do tell you participated in these programs however . Forget the LinkedIn jargon nonsense. Be honest 

4. If there is criteria/ questions for the application answer them. So often we get a great resume and cover letter  but the job selections questions have been missed. You will not get an interview. Your answers need to be succinct and answer the question. If you don’t have a skill that’s asked in a question  answer honestly and add you are happy to be trained. Please don’t write an essay for questions either. If I have 20 to applicants choose from , I will not choose you. Being succinct in healthcare in important 

5 be punctual for your interview. If you cannot turn up on time for your interview for whatever reason , I believe you will not turn on time for work 

6 in the interview remember the panel members  names. It makes a big impact if you respond with “ That a interesting question Sally etc “

7 it’s ok to ask someone to repeat the question or ask for a moment to think about the question. It shows a thoughtful
Process but don’t do this on every question. Awkward silences after a question are just that - awkward, so ask for a minute to respond if need be . Bring pen and paper if need be if you need to stop and jot down some ideas but again not for every question 

8 how to dress- suit and tie ? Maybe. Just dress presentable. I have  a job to a poor new graduate in a Kmart type shirt and pants. He was presentable , neat and tidy but more importantly he was the best candidate 

9 how to calm your nerves ? Before interview tell yourself you don’t want this job. You are nervous because you really want the job so convince yourself it’s ok not to get it. It’s harder than it sounds but it’s a useful tool . Some people  ride the nerves,add a coffee and  chocolate before the interview and come in excited. To be honest if you are nervous I don’t care, I just want to know about you. 

10 what does everyone want from a potential candidate? That you can work hard, adapt to change, learn new skills, be a reasonable human, and not be a problem.It’s that simple. Can you do the job and not be a problem? 

11 questions we ask. It ranges from technical stuff, values of the organisation, work health and safety, privacy , what you like about your profession, what skills you are bringing. I have been on interviews were we have asked three questions and than showed ten x-ray images and asked technical question, others have been like why did you choose to be a physiotherapist?, what do you love about physiotherapy, ? My only advice is
Like maths tests in high school show your workings. One sentence answers will get you very little marks but be wary as long monologues  are tiresome and more you say the more likely you say something wrong 

12 online interviews are very common. Don’t use chat gpt in the background. We can tell. Don’t interview online with dirty background or noise as it’s distracting . 

13 When we ask you, do you have anything to ask ? Ask about the staff or if it’s rural/ regional ask about the town etc. Appear  generally interested.ask about training in new skills etc show interest through this question by asking questions that indicate you are committed. If it comes down between you and someone else we will take the more interest candidate 

14 referee- make sure your referees know you are going for a job and that the are happy to be your referee . Nothing worse than spending a week or two chasing down a referee. 

15. Paperwork. Have you got your vaccination record? Are you ahpra registered , you have some photo ID , I have seen contracts take months because HR cannot proceed without the necessary documents. I will not interview anyone unless all Documents are provided . It’s a a legal requirement but I see it as a test of how organised you are. 

16 anything you put in your application or any interaction with us is fair game for us to use. Worked at Cairns two years ago- let’s ring them. Did a clinical placement at Geelong let ring them. Gave great answers but acted strangely in the interview, we are not giving you a job.

17 when answering questions be honest. When asked what skills are you bringing to this position if I hear I’m a collaborative team player with excellent communication skills who will strengthen your team I will scream. How about I’m a hard worker who can take an x-ray , do CT , perform
Post op rehab, give medication advice etc. Be honest , so so sick of fancy replies that mean nothing. Happy to score those answers as 2/10

So what are the horror stories? The candidate with three pages of demands, one who told the interview panel they are looking for an easy work life where you can sit and chat- its public health , another who when told that the job was starting in January told me oh they are going to go to Europe for 4 months in March and would that be ok? No was the answer as its a 12 month contract. 

I couldn’t decide between two candidates. Rang the referees and one has no idea they where the persons referee and than proceeded to tellMe The candidate was sociopath when they worked with them. 

Interview a fabulous candidate who were going to offer the job to until when asked did he have any questions  and ruined his chances. Basically he told us he thinks our hospital sucks, he hates the town and he is only here to get MRI training and go back to Brisbane. 

Someone using chat gpt for online interview and would turn and repeat the question to an open laptop and than read the answer out, another decided not to answer a question but ask about what we would answer .

PeopleWho didn’t answer the employment criteria questions and then appealed that they didn’t get the job. 

Sent an email and left two phone message offering an interview which they didn’t reply to so I Presume They were not coming. They turned up anyway. You cannot not help but be biased against them. 

Finally the applicant who I swear didn’t blink for10 minutes, widened pupils, was expressionless and gave one sentence answers made us think they had taken something. ",1,1768341971.0,AlliedHealthProsAusNZ,0,1.0,False

I was in from a Thursday to a Monday. Checking in about 2, leaving at 11.  The rooms are super small. It's an old building, so that has something to do with it. I was required to have a support person with me. DH said the couch slept fine. Bring your own pillow - both you and support person. The hospital ones are very flat.

 The room temp was like a perfect 68-70°F and they said they'd adjust the thermostat if we wanted it moved. 

TV was basic cable. There was an outlet both for the patient bed, and the couch. We had no issues keeping things charged. WiFi worked great. Zero issues streaming movies. 

Nursing and patient care staff was fantastic. Loved them. 

Dietary had issues. Bring snacks cause it's likely you won't get meals on time. I had issues getting meals that fit my prescribed diet due to allergies. Things escalated to the point Houskeeping Management paid me a visit to sort the issues out. It was mostly fixed by the 3rd day. Meals were extremely salty and no fat. If I have to do this again, I'm bringing real butter. 

I brought more clothes and stuff than I needed. Because of being short staffed, I couldn't bathe every day. The nurse is required to be in the room with you if cameras are off. I did more movies than crafting/coloring. They require sleep deprivation every day, but provide all the coffee you want. 

Carry all your bags up with you arrive. Support person can't leave once you're put in your room. It's a bit of a hike from the garage to registration, then up to the wing. A book bag and wheelie bag is recommended. But patient is put in a wheel chair at registration, so make sure support person can handle the bags. I put one duffel in my lap. Registrar was rude and of no help. He was also very rushed nearly leaving DH behind. 


I asked to shower before I left. That seemed to be a novel concept. The EEG tech did shampoo my hair in the bed after she took out the leads. But then I showered using Palmolive. she gave me a comb, and I got everything out before leaving the hospital. Better their drain than mine.

The purple-and-gold shirt his mom had bought him the day before he left Phorantis felt soft against his skin—a small piece of home in the endless metal corridors of the Training Center. He was still turning over the lunch conversation in his head, the way Edward and Hale had looked at each other when his mother’s name came up.

Everyone knows Mom, he thought, a mix of pride and bewilderment settling in his chest. Powerful friends. The Principality. What does that even mean?

He shook it off for now. There would be time to ask questions later. Right now he needed to run, to burn off the nervous energy that had been building since he arrived.

He retraced the route Edward had shown him earlier, passing crew members in the corridors. Some gave him quick nods; others let their gaze linger a second longer, a faint smile playing at the corners of their mouths. Titus returned the looks—polite, curious, aware. The station felt different today. Less like a new posting, more like a place that was starting to notice him back.

Near the fitness wing he turned a corner—and walked straight into a woman.

She stumbled back with a soft “Oof,” arms windmilling briefly. Titus’s hands shot out, steadying her shoulders.

“I’m so sorry—I wasn’t looking—”

She laughed, low and warm, brushing a strand of blonde hair from her face. Mid-forties, slim, just under two meters tall, attractive in the effortless way of someone comfortable in their own skin. Her coveralls were immaculate, logistics insignia on the shoulder.

“I’m okay,” she said, steadying herself. “I should’ve been watching too. These corridors sneak up on you.”

She extended a hand. “Joana Taylor. Logistics office for the station.”

“Titus Staples,” he said, shaking firmly. “New trainee.”

Her smile widened. “Well, nice bumping into you, Titus.” She laughed again at her own pun. “I better go. Heading to the track?”

“Yes, ma’am.”

“Have a good run.” She gave him a quick nod and headed toward the main deck, disappearing around the corner.

Titus exhaled, shook his head at himself, and continued on.

Joana reached the main deck a minute later and spotted Cathy wiping down a tool cart near the bay entrance.

“Hey, you,” Joana called.

Cathy looked up, grinned. “Joana. What’s the word?”

They exchanged quick small talk—shipment delays, a new parts manifest—then Joana lowered her voice. “I just bumped—literally—into a good-looking young man heading to the track. Titus Staples.”

Cathy finished the name for her. “We’ve already spoken to him.” A faint blush crept up her neck.

Joana raised an eyebrow. “He’s about your and Kelly’s age, isn’t he?”

Cathy’s smile turned shy. “Yeah. Twenty-two.”

Joana chuckled. “Lucky girls. I better get to work.”

She walked off, leaving Cathy staring after her for a second before pulling out her data pad. Fingers flew across the screen.

To: Kelly

Hey girl, you running? Titus is out there.

Titus reached the orbital track. He stretched—hamstrings, calves, shoulders—then started at an easy jog. The glass walls curved around him, stars sliding past in slow, majestic silence. The track rotated direction daily to keep traffic flowing; today it was counterclockwise, smooth and quiet.

A figure appeared ahead, moving at a steady pace. Titus drifted to the outer lane to pass—and realized it was Kelly.

She wore blue running shorts and a lightweight top with a subtle tree pattern across the chest. Her dark hair was pulled back in a high ponytail, bouncing with each stride.

She glanced over as he drew level, smiled. “Hey.”

“Hey,” he managed, matching her pace.

They ran together for a while—silent at first, then trading easy comments about the view, the rhythm of the station’s spin, how the stars never got old. Eventually they slowed to a walk, then stopped at one of the benches along the inner curve.

Kelly motioned to sit. They dropped onto the cool metal, breathing hard, the void glittering beyond the glass.

“Glad you’re here,” she said. “I don’t like running alone. And I’ll be glad when Cathy’s off nights.”

Titus nodded. “I thought you’d be on nights too. Aren’t you two… glued together?”

Kelly laughed, lightly smacking his arm. “Shush, you.”

The conversation drifted. She asked about trees—real ones, not hydroponic dwarfs—about lakes, grass, the smell of rain , what music he liked . Titus did more listening than talking, content to answer when she pressed, watching her face light up at descriptions of open sky and wind that didn’t come from vents.

They talked for over two hours—walking laps when their legs got restless, sitting again when they needed to breathe. Eventually Kelly glanced at her wrist chrono.

“I need to go shower,” she said. “Meeting Cathy in the mess hall later.” She leaned in suddenly, pressed a soft, quick peck to his cheek. “Want to meet us in an hour? Pizza again?”

Titus’s skin tingled where her lips had been. “Yes.”

She grinned. “See ya.”

Kelly headed back toward her quarters, already pulling out her pad to check messages.

Titus made one more slow lap, then headed to his cabin. He hit the shower, letting hot water wash away sweat and the lingering surprise of the morning. As he toweled off, his data pad pinged.

From: Director Hale

Restrictions on outgoing conversations have been removed. Have a good night. – DH

Titus stared at the message, then smiled. Whatever that meant, it felt like permission.

He dressed—clean coveralls and headed to the mess hall. The smell of pizza hit him the moment he stepped through the hatch. He grabbed a tray, loaded a thick slice and a bottle of water, and scanned the room.

Cathy and Kelly were already at a table near the back, waving him over.

“Over here!” Cathy called.

Titus walked over, sliding into the seat across from them. Kelly smelled faintly of citrus soap and something floral; Cathy was still in her uniform, sleeves rolled, looking relaxed after a shift.

Both women smiled wide, warm, and a little mischievous.

The conversation started easily,how the run went, what the track felt like today, whether Titus had tried the new synth-coffee blend yet. Then Kelly asking about the music ."" I left it in my quarters"" But underneath the small talk was a current of something new , comfortable, curious, and unmistakably interested.

Cathy was mid-sentence, teasing Titus about how he’d probably have half the station’s mechanics begging for Kestrel rides, when she glanced at her wrist chrono and groaned softly.

“Ugh. Break’s over.” She pushed her tray aside and stood, stretching with a dramatic sigh. “Uncle Hale will have my hide if I’m late getting back to the bay. That shuttle isn’t going to moor itself.”

Kelly rolled her eyes playfully. “Tell him we’re corrupting the new kid. He’ll understand.” Then Kelly jump up and moved over to the other side  to sit next to Titus 

Cathy laughed, then leaned down to give Titus a quick, warm squeeze on the shoulder, her fingers lingering just a second longer than necessary. “See you tomorrow, hotshot. Try not to break too many hearts while I’m gone.”

Titus managed a grin, cheeks still faintly pink. “I’ll do my best.”

Cathy shot Kelly a knowing look  “Don’t scare him off while I’m away”  and headed for the hatch, braid swinging with each step.

Not long after, Kelly’s data pad buzzed softly against the table. She glanced down, a small, knowing smile tugging at her lips.

The message was from Cathy:

Girl he really likes you. Have fun. C

Kelly let out a quiet laugh soft, delighted and angled the pad so Titus couldn’t quite see the screen, though the way her cheeks flushed gave her away.

Titus raised an eyebrow, curious. “Good news?”

Kelly tucked a strand of hair behind her ear, eyes sparkling as she met his gaze again. “Just Cathy being Cathy. She’s… observant.” She leaned in a fraction closer, her shoulder still pressed lightly against his, voice dropping to a teasing murmur. “She thinks you’re trouble. The good kind.”

Titus felt the warmth spread from where their arms touched, straight up his neck. “Oh ,” he said, half-joking, half-serious. “You  are making it hard to concentrate on anything else.”

Kelly’s smile turned slow and warm. “Good. That’s the plan.”

She didn’t pull away.

The mess hall lights continued their gradual dim to evening cycle, but right then, at that scarred table, the rest of the station might as well have been a million light years away.

Kelly rested her chin on her hand, studying him with open curiosity. “So… back to that music. You really left your pad in your cabin?”

Titus nodded, grinning sheepishly. “Yeah. Didn’t think I’d need a soundtrack for pizza and… this.”

“This,” Kelly repeated, the word soft and deliberate. She tilted her head, eyes tracing his face. “I like this. No rush, no sims, no Edward glaring at us from across the room. Just… us.”

She paused, then added with a playful glint, “But I’m holding you to that private concert. And I’m not waiting until tomorrow to hear what kind of trouble you’ve got queued up.”

Titus laughed under his breath. “Deal. But only if you promise not to laugh when I inevitably trip over my own feet trying to impress you.”

Kelly reached out and lightly brushed her fingers across the back of his hand—just once, fleeting, electric. “No promises. But. 

She held his gaze a beat longer, then stood slowly, stretching with exaggerated grace.

“Come on,” she said, voice low and inviting. “Let’s go get your data pad so I can listen to the music. I want to hear those ancient Terran bangers you’ve been hiding.”

Titus stood without hesitation, tray forgotten on the table.

“Lead the way,” he said, smiling.

They left the mess hall together, shoulders brushing with every step, the station’s quiet corridors stretching out ahead like they’d been waiting for exactly this moment. Kelly’s hand lightly bumped his as they walked—accidental at first, then not—and neither of them moved away.

Today's Pick: **EDM 60-MIN ML**

**$DKNG**: **+135**

Wager Amount: 1U to WIN 1.35U

League: Edmonton Oilers vs Nashville Predators (7:10 PM CST on ESPN+)

**Recap**: I knew this was going to be cutting close the way this gamescript was going. CJ had tons of turnovers in this game, 4 fumbles and 1 interception, but luckily for them they recovered 2 of those fumbles. Stroud had some passes look very shaky and wobbly, but other than that he looked like a world beater out there in the cold environment. I will admit that I was wrong to believe that Stroud was going to struggle in the cold weather. Sometimes this game can be humbling. **CJ Stroud looked better than all the qbs played this NFL wildcard weekend, Texans have the best chance to win the superbowl after that performance.** CJ Stroud has another cold weather game coming up and I won't be fading him because I am thoroughly convinced that he is THE BEST player in cold weather games. If he can outduel Aaron Rodgers in a cold weather game, he can outduel Drake Maye!

**Matchup:** So yesterday's POTD was not my best bet. Anyone shocked? I loved the matchup between Leon Draisaitl against the Hawks and **Leon Draisaitl goalscorer would have been my POTD if there wasn't a MNF game. Gotta go wit where the demand is, but today I will be featuring my best bet and it's Oilers 60-Minute ML**

I think this is where Oilers get on a roll. I usually just take Oilers player props like Zach Hyman, Bouchard, Draisaitl and McJesus prop bets and they always deliever, but what's been so disappointing about this team is winning the game outright. I think this is where they start to breakaway and make themselves a force to reckon, so I'll take the opportunitity for them to not only win this game outright but win within the 60 minute period (means excluding OT). It's a nice plus odds for them to win witout OT. **They won their last 3 matchups at the Preys home in Nashville. They also won their last matchup handily without OT as well.**

https://preview.redd.it/pnvpwzeku6dg1.png?width=856&format=png&auto=webp&s=127f7a8dc6a35746f92a108ee8cf71653cd68eee

They won each of those matchups by multiple scores and that's what I expect in this game too. McJesus is on a tear and is on a career high 19-Point streak, King Leon also has good matchup history against the Prey's goaltending and Zach Hyman has really came onto his own. Not to mention Evan Bouchard playing solid defense and contributing on the offense as well. The Preys are also missing Jonathan Marchessault and they really don't have forwards to compete against the two best forward in all of Hot Key. Don't overthink this one, just take the Oilers 60-Min ML.

**The Play & Prediction :** 1U on Oilers 60-Min ML. Also wagering 1U on Connor McDavid Goalscorer. Prolly a lil' sprinkle on Oilers -1.5 spread. Oilers win on the road against the Preys, 4-2.

The end is drawing near, but who knos what the future holds. I will never rule out a possibility of handicapping POTDs in 2026 and beyond.

Not because you’re “lazy,” but because your brain is being hit with nonstop stimulation, dopamine loops, and distraction weapons disguised as apps.

If you’re a pre-med, med student, resident, or anyone trying to learn complex info under pressure, you already know the pain: you sit down to study… and your brain instantly rebels.

I’ve worked with students who had great study resources but still couldn’t *lock in*. And here’s the truth: **the problem often isn’t intelligence. It’s brain state.** If your nervous system is overloaded, your focus collapses, recall weakens, and learning turns into misery.

That’s why people are obsessed with **NZT-48 Frequency**, a cognitively encoded audio session designed to support **deep focus, flow state, faster learning, and stronger recall** in just **10 minutes a day**.

If you’ve been searching for a “genius mode” hack that isn’t a shady pill or caffeine overdose… keep reading. This guide will tell you exactly how NZT-48 works, how to use it properly, and what results you can realistically expect.

>

# What Is NZT-48 Frequency (and Why Is Everyone Calling It “Genius Mode”?)

NZT-48 Frequency is positioned as an **audio-based cognitive performance tool**, designed to influence mental performance by guiding your brain into an optimal “study state.”

Let’s simplify what that means.

Instead of pushing your brain harder (like caffeine does), NZT-48 attempts to **change the state of your brain first**, so studying becomes smoother and less effortful.

# Is NZT-48 a supplement, a drug, or a brain training tool?

Not a drug. Not a supplement.

It’s a **frequency-based audio session** designed for:

* focus
* clarity
* flow state
* recall
* learning efficiency

So it’s closer to **brain training / cognitive conditioning** than anything pharmacological.

✅ **CTA:** If you’re curious what you actually receive (audio format + guide), check the product page: [**NZT-48 official access**](https://duolb.com/)

# What does “cognitively encoded frequency” actually mean?

Marketing language aside, it means:

* the audio is intentionally engineered
* it likely combines frequency layers and soundscapes
* it aims to guide your brain toward certain patterns associated with focus/learning

In other words: **it’s not random “study music.” It’s structured.**

# Who is NZT-48 for?

NZT-48 makes most sense if you:

* study for long hours
* handle complex subjects (medicine, anatomy, pharmacology, engineering)
* feel brain fog / overstimulation
* struggle to enter deep focus consistently

# Why Focus Feels Impossible Today (Brain Fog, Distraction & Cognitive Overload)

If you can’t concentrate, don’t assume you’re broken.

Most students are dealing with:

* chronic sleep debt
* cortisol overload
* attention residue (switching tasks constantly)
* dopamine-seeking behavior (scrolling addiction)
* “always-on” digital stress

# What causes brain fog and mental fatigue in high-stress learners?

Usually a combination of:

* low-quality sleep
* stress dysregulation
* poor nutrition timing
* constant multitasking
* no true recovery blocks

Your brain isn’t designed to be productive 12 hours straight while also consuming 4 hours of chaos content.

# Why studying feels harder than it should

Because every time you switch tasks, your brain leaves “mental fragments” behind.

That’s called **attention residue**, and it kills deep work.

# What is Flow State and why it matters

**Flow state** is when:

* your brain is fully engaged
* time distortion happens
* effort feels smooth
* learning sticks faster

Flow isn’t magic. It’s neurobiology.

✅ **CTA:** If your biggest struggle is getting *into* focus, NZT-48 is built exactly for that problem: [**Try NZT-48**](https://duolb.com/)

# The Real Goal: Deep Focus + Neuroplastic Learning (Not “Magic”)

NZT-48 shouldn’t be treated as a miracle button.

It’s better viewed as a **state-priming tool**.

# What “deep focus mode” means in neuroscience terms

When you’re deeply focused:

* your prefrontal control stabilizes
* your attention becomes narrow and steady
* working memory operates efficiently

# How neuroplasticity supports accelerated learning

Neuroplasticity is the brain’s ability to:

* strengthen synapses
* build faster recall pathways
* encode patterns efficiently

And the brain learns best when:

* stress isn’t overwhelming
* attention is stable
* recall is active

# Why consistency beats intensity

Listening 1 time isn’t the point.

The advantage comes from:

* daily repetition
* consistent brain state training

>

# How Does NZT-48 Work? (Binaural Encoding + Brainwave Entrainment Explained)

Let’s unpack the science-style explanation.

# What is brainwave entrainment?

Brainwave entrainment is when rhythmic stimulation (audio) helps your brain synchronize into certain wave patterns.

Different brain states align with different wave patterns.

# Alpha–Theta bridge: why it matters for learning

This is associated with:

* relaxed focus
* memory consolidation
* reduced mental noise

You want calm alertness, not anxiety-driven study panic.

# 40Hz Gamma carrier: why gamma is linked to cognition

Gamma rhythms are often associated with:

* high-level processing
* working memory
* integration of information

So yes: **there’s a reason 40Hz is mentioned.**

# NZT-48 System Specifications (Technical Architecture of the Soundscape)

This is where people get confused, so let’s be crystal clear.

# What format do you receive?

Usually delivered as:

* **Lossless WAV**
* **320kbps MP3** (depending on product delivery options)

# What does “processing speed ~200 GB/s (conceptual)” mean?

It’s not literal computing performance.

It’s a **metaphor for mental throughput** (faster pattern recognition, clearer thinking).

# Why headphones are mandatory

If it uses binaural encoding:

* stereo separation matters
* speakers destroy the effect

**Rule:** headphones = yes, speakers = no.

# Step-by-Step: How to Use NZT-48 for Maximum Study Performance

If people say “it didn’t work,” 90% of the time it’s because they used it wrong.

# Protocol Initialization: hydrate, isolate, activate

Before your session:

1. Drink water (yes, seriously)
2. Put phone on airplane mode
3. Sit still
4. Use headphones
5. Decide what task you’ll study *right after*

# How many sessions per day is safe and optimal?

Most protocols recommend:

* **1 session/day optimal**
* **do not exceed 3/day**

More ≠ better.  
Overuse can lead to mental fatigue or irritability.

# Best time to listen

Best options:

* **Before studying** (priming)
* Before a deep work block
* Before planning (schedule review)

Not recommended:

* while scrolling
* while multitasking

# What Benefits Does NZT-48 Claim to Support? (Full Cognitive Stack Breakdown)

Here’s the full list, translated into practical real-world outcomes.

# Deep Focus Mode

You can sustain attention longer without needing constant breaks.

# Photographic Recall

Not literal superhero memory.  
More like:

* improved retrieval
* fewer “blank mind” moments
* sharper recall under exam pressure

# Speed Learning

You still need to study.  
But absorption can improve because:

* attention is stronger
* resistance is lower
* recall becomes smoother

# Pattern Recognition

This is huge for medical learning:

* symptoms → diagnosis
* mechanism → side effect
* anatomy → clinical consequence

# Calm Mind + motivation drive

A calm brain learns better.  
An anxious brain just survives.

# Who Should Use NZT-48 (and Who Should Avoid It)?

# ✅ Who it’s for

* overwhelmed students
* people with focus fragmentation
* those who study heavy technical content
* deep workers who need consistent flow

# ⚠️ Who should avoid or be cautious

* epilepsy/seizure sensitivity (entrainment triggers could be risky)
* severe anxiety sensitivity
* certain neurological conditions

If you feel uncomfortable:

* stop
* lower volume
* reduce frequency of use
* consult a professional

# NZT-48 for Medical Students: How to Apply It to High-Yield Studying

This is where NZT-48 becomes *actually useful*.

# Anatomy

Use it before:

* labeling practice
* recall drills
* image-based repetition

# Physiology

Best for:

* concept linking
* mechanism mapping
* building integrated understanding

# Pharmacology

Pairs perfectly with:

* spaced repetition
* flashcards
* side-effect pattern recognition

# How to pair NZT-48 with active recall and Anki

Best stack:

1. NZT-48 session (10 min)
2. 60–90 minutes Anki + recall
3. 10 min break (no phone)
4. repeat

# NZT-48 vs Other Focus Tools (Coffee, Music, White Noise, ADHD Apps)

# NZT-48 vs coffee

Coffee pushes energy.  
NZT-48 primes focus state.

Coffee helps until:

* jitters
* crash
* anxiety

NZT-48 helps when:

* you feel scattered
* you can’t enter deep work

# Is NZT-48 comparable to binaural beats on YouTube?

Kind of.  
But YouTube has issues:

* compression artifacts
* random quality
* ads (pure focus-killer)
* inconsistent protocols

NZT-48 is positioned as:

* structured
* consistent
* purposeful encoding

# Realistic Results Timeline (Day 1 vs Day 7)

# Day 1

You might notice:

* slightly calmer mind
* easier start
* reduced resistance to studying

# Day 3

Common report:

* improved clarity
* less urge to check phone

# Day 7

This is where it can start feeling like:

* “I’m studying smoother”
* “I’m remembering faster”
* “I can focus for 2 hours straight”

>

# Common Mistakes That Stop NZT-48 From Working

Here are the usual self-sabotage classics:

* **Using speakers instead of headphones**: kills binaural effect
* **Listening while multitasking**: your brain won’t lock in
* **Overusing it**: can lead to fatigue
* **Expecting magic**: you still need strategy + recall practice
* **Scrolling immediately after**: destroys the mental state you primed

✅ **CTA:** If you want the intended experience, get the official version + instructions: [**NZT-48 access**](https://duolb.com/)

# Global User Reports (What They Suggest About Effectiveness)

Common report themes:

* “I studied 2 hours without reaching for my phone.”
* “Memory felt sharper during finals week.”
* “I stop procrastinating once I play it.”
* “It feels like focus becomes automatic.”

Important note: these are subjective reports, not clinical claims.  
But they’re **consistent**, and that’s interesting.

1qc4w1z,https://www.reddit.com/r/ourtownreno/comments/1qc4w1z/what_about_a_tinker_club_in_reno_to_fix_broken/,What About a Tinker Club in Reno To Fix Broken Items For Donation Purposes?,"From our Ideas for Progress series:  What About a Tinker Club in Reno To Fix Broken Items For Donation Purposes?

A recent Reno subreddit thread with the question what does Reno need? had what we thought was an ingenious response by yankykiwi saying “my last city had a sort of tinkers thrift store attached to the dump.”

The commenter went on to explain that if someone dropped off a broken home item, such as an oven, dishwasher, lawnmower, after bringing it in, it would be fixed and sold, or given to a person in need.   They added the place employed people with practical knowledge who struggled getting hired in other places to do the fixing.

Locals immediately responded they would volunteer or want to start such a program here.

The Truckee Meadows Habitat for Humanity Restore on Greenbrae Drive does have an existing version of this to get homes ready, albeit it’s more of the in good shape to regive model with a narrow range, rather than for all conditions and items.  

Its Facebook also occasionally has item dumps for the community at large.  A recent post on its Facebook had free pallets available while another had skis starting at just $25 with a photo of a bucket full of them.  

“This thrift store model relies entirely on community donations,” its website indicates.  “Recycling these gently used items keeps usable materials out of landfills, provides our neighbors in the community with more affordable materials to maintain and beautify their homes, regularly employs roughly 20 community members, and supports our homeownership program with donated building materials and profits to pay program expenses.”

Its list of items you can bring Wednesdays through Saturdays from 9 to 5 p.m. includes appliances, but not dishwashers and ice makers, new blinds, cabinets, new carpeting, countertops, doors, electrical materials, faucets, flooring, furniture, rust free hardware and tools, heaters, air conditioners, lighting, lumber without nails, framed mirrors, roofing materials, plywood, sheetrock, shelving, new shower heads, skylights, tiles, sinks, wallpaper, windows and yard items.  

One model we could look to as inspiration for more of these types of practices locally is part of The Recycling and Reuse Hub in Cincinnati in its appropriately named Lower Price Hill area.  

The program which ressembles the Reno subreddit suggestion charges a small fee to take in materials from the community, including broken items.  

They then have a group of volunteers called the Tinker Team who try to give discarded items a second life for resale or donation purposes.  Items they repair range from coffee makers to toasters, grinders, radios, power strips, vacuum cleaners, crock-pots, lamps, you name it.  

The volunteers then show up twice a month to see what they can fix in a fun, shared, collaborative, hands on workspace.   Half of the items are usually fixed with ease, a quarter require difficult work and another quarter are usually unfixable. In the latter cases, spare parts are kept for future repairs while everything else is recycled.  

Meanwhile, the pile of fixed items goes to organizations who help those in need.

There are items they don’t take such as baby cribs, pianos, books, clothes, trophies, magazines, mattresses, vinyl, furniture, which already have their own established recycling mechanisms.  

For wood products, there’s a separate group called Scrap2Home which collects scrap wood normally sent to a dumpster and then the landfill “and use it to build furniture for people who cannot afford to buy it. Every donation helps a family furnish their home, one piece at a time.”

Then we have Feb 27-march 2nd without a plan and are trying to decide between Coimbra (with a side trip to see some ancient ruins in Conimbriga if it's easy to get there) and Aveiro for those 3 days, but need guidance and advice. 

March 2nd-6th, we have a rented apartment/hotel in Porto and would like to see the Douro valley and do some winery tours and are willing to take day trips to wherever haha.   

The next leg of the trip we don't have anything planned until we leave on the 11th.
We could continue staying in Porto and taking more trips and looking at Braga, or heading back south towards Lisbon and possibly stopping at other towns along the way.

Male, 20.
Around late Oct, I had rough sex with my girlfriend While giving backshots my penis accidentally slipped and hit her cheeks and it hurt I just paused for a while then continued the deed. The next days was followed by frequent and rough masturbation over several days. Since early Nov, I’ve had intermittent burning in the urethra, mostly
 
• during or after urination
• worse when holding urine
• flares with coffee, alcohol, spicy food
• sometimes almost gone, then comes back
• no current discharge

I've had:
Full STD panel inculding HIV - Negative
Urinalysis - Normal
No fever, no worsening pain, no severe pain 

What’s confusing is the non-linear healing,
I had days where symptoms were almost zero, then they flare again with irritants or sexual activity.

From what I’m reading, this seems similar to non-infectious urethritis / CPPS / pelvic floor dysfunction rather than infection.

Questions:

Has anyone experienced this pattern and recovered?

Did alpha-blockers or pelvic floor work help?

Did anyone improve after a urologist visit even with negative tests?

I have a urology appointment scheduled and mainly want to know what to expect and if this sounds familiar to others.

I'm Connor, a 23-year-old non-denominational Christian from Iowa. About a year ago, Jesus completely transformed my heart—He drew me closer than ever, and I was baptized this past March. Since then, my life has been all about pursuing Him first, and I'm excited to keep growing in that every day.
I want a relationship built on Christ at the center—someone who loves diving into the Bible, praying together, and encouraging each other to live out what God calls us to. I'm aiming to read Scripture daily and seek His will before making decisions. Long-term, I'd love to build a family someday with a godly woman who shares that vision.
A bit about me: I'm 6'0"" with brown hair, blue eyes, and a slender build. I geek out over human biology—it's amazing how God designed our bodies! I jog through the cornfields (Iowa perks), watch classic movies (nothing beats It's a Wonderful Life every Christmas), and occasionally unwind with Minecraft or The Sims. Game nights, movie marathons, or both sound perfect to me.
Career-wise, I'm pursuing the medical field—God put that calling on my heart after my transformation. I'm rooted in Iowa for my program right now (relocation isn't feasible yet due to costs), but I'm open to long-distance if it feels right and God opens doors. (US only, please—no international.)
For a first meetup, coffee in person sounds great once we connect. If you're around my age, passionate about your walk with Christ, and up for building something meaningful, I'd love to hear from you. Tell me your favorite verse or what God's been teaching you lately!

1qc4kbx,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_PassengerBudget8280/comments/1qc4kbx/my_boyfriends_suspicious_communication_with_his/,"My boyfriend's suspicious communication with his ""just a girl he knows.""","Help.

My boyfriend and I are dating long distance. We know each other from the first grade of school. He comes to visit me for three weeks or a month every three or four months. We're 20 years old and we've been dating for over a year. My boyfriend is the most amazing, sensitive, caring, and loving person in the world, but...

He recently came to visit me for the holidays, and for the first time in my life, I checked his phone because when he was scrolling through his messages, there were a lot of chats with women's names. I opened the phone, and most of the chats were with female clients from his university who bought homework from him. Everything was fine there.

But then I found a chat with a girl he'd been friends with since his first year of university. They message each other every one or two months. She initiates most of the contact: ""Hi! How are you!"" ""Help me with my homework, you're my smartest and most responsible friend, and overall the best 🥺❤️❤️,"" they're friends because he's studying abroad and there were only three people in their class who spoke his language.

Basically, I consider this girl a pickme. She knows my boyfriend has me, but she keeps sending him ""❤️😍🥺🥹🫶🏻🫂"" emojis. It's outrageous to me. She's brazenly hitting on him, constantly praising him, texting him first, and asking to hang out. And he feels like he's been friendzoning her for years.

Of course, most of the questions are directed at my boyfriend. And that's not the end of it. He's also gone out with her a couple of times to see how things are going and what's new, without telling me. He also asked what he should give her for her birthday, and she answered, ""Chocolate, hehehe."" So he said, ""I was seeing someone I knew,"" and didn't specify the gender, but I thought it was a boy I knew. When I asked why, he replied, ""It just happened that way."" He couldn't say anything else. It really pissed me off.

It wasn't even the fact that they were seeing each other, but the fact that he did it in secret, even though he knew it would hurt me. He actually knew, because when he was screensharing on Discord, for example, he would quickly minimize all chats. When I was lying on his shoulder, he would quickly exit the messaging app, apparently so I wouldn't have any questions. So he knew perfectly well it was wrong.

Also, at the beginning of our relationship, he said that friendship between a guy and a girl is impossible. But when I asked, ""What the hell is that?"" He said she was just an ""acquaintance"" (even though SHE calls him a great friend) 😂👍🏻 Yeah, it's really convenient to call someone just an acquaintance when it's convenient :)

Do you also go out one-on-one with girls you know to cafes, secretly from your girlfriend who's in another country? Do you also ask them what to get for their birthday? Do you also send all your first-year notes to just acquaintances?

This whole situation is disgusting to me. I can't even imagine how it would look if I went out to a cafe secretly from my boyfriend with another boy who sends me hearts and is clearly in love with me.

My boyfriend swore on his mother that he doesn't like his female classmates. And in general, for him, his social circle is 50/50 men and women, and he perceives them completely equally, saying he doesn't see the difference between a guy and a girl.

This sounds like bullshit to me; maybe I'm too jealous and controlling. But I was already cheated on in my first relationship. I don't want to endure this bullshit again. Maybe he genuinely doesn't care for anyone, maybe he's just trying to flatter himself by thinking some pickme is in love with him (and she's ugly, with crooked teeth and constantly swollen).

But why didn't anyone think about my feelings? Why am I afraid to even start a conversation with a boy my age, lest, God forbid, I make my boyfriend jealous (even though he's not a jealous type of person), yet he does this in secret, knowing full well how jealous I am?

We discussed it. He sincerely apologized; he didn't think it would hurt my feelings so much. He took me to a restaurant and gave me gorgeous flowers.

We came to a compromise that he would never communicate with this pickme again, or with any other girls at all (at most, help with homework). He would also always show me all their messages.

Yes, yes, that last sentence makes me sick too, but I don't know what to do. Blindly trust and continue to be thousands of kilometers away? I don't know. I'm 20, the prime years of any girl's life, and I'm afraid to waste them on a man who loves talking to women and can easily go for a cup of coffee with a girl who's clearly in love with him.

Or maybe I'm overthinking it? Maybe I'm just a traumatized bitch? I'm scared. I'm scared because there's nothing but cheating all around me; 99% of men cheat sooner or later. All my friends have been cheated on! I don't want to leave this relationship simply out of fear of cheating. I want to trust him, I want things to be like before...

But now I won't sleep at night, replaying the image of my boyfriend sitting in a cafe with some ugly girl ten times in my head.

1qc4iya,https://www.reddit.com/r/hydration/comments/1qc4iya/natural_electrolyte_supplementation_the_superior/,Natural Electrolyte Supplementation. The Superior Way.,"Supplementing electrolytes naturally is a far superior way to re-balance your minerals.



Low carb veggie juices ranked in order of potassium density: Parsley, Celery, Cucumber.

Supplementing electrolytes is vitally important for recovering from unhealthy eating. But most people don't know that electrolyte powders are not only ineffective, but disastrous for your health. 

So we will supplement naturally. To get started you will need a juicer. If you don't have one, use a blender to blend up cucumber and drink that, squeeze a lemon in and there you go. However, juicing these other things will be far more effective. And since most people are disastrously deficient from a lifetime of poor eating, most will have to supplement for months to years. So get a juicer.

Now, depending on your size and weight, and how deficient you are, you will need more/less juice per day. If you are weak and sick and/or have gut issues, starting with less and working up to more would be the way to go. But for most people starting at a minimum of 16oz per day. And up to as much as you like. Could be anywhere from 16-48oz per day. More if you can handle it and or crave it.

Ratios of vegetables you juice out of the three doesn't matter a whole lot other than making sure to add in plenty of parsley. 50 -100 grams per 16oz. As parsley is the highest in potassium and magnesium. Celery is preferable to cucumber though, as it has higher potassium and much higher sodium.



16oz recipe:

\- 1 ""Bunch/bag"" of celery. (Roughly 2lbs.)

\- 80 -100 grams of parsley.

Wash and juice them.



16oz ""tasty cucumber gatorade"" (This is not as hydrating but tastes good, unlike the celery & parsley.)

\- 2 cucumbers peeled.

\- 1 - 2 lemons, peeled, seeded.

Juice and enjoy.



When drinking veggie juice. Make sure to consume as soon as possible after juicing. Nutrient oxidation is a topic that I won't get into here because it is complex but suffice it to say, the sooner you drink it after juicing the better.

Also, make sure to wait 1 hour after drinking juice before eating any food. As it will temporarily alkalize your system. But don't worry, your stomach will re-acidify to baseline or higher after that hour.



Additional tips:

\- Do not consume water, coffee, tea, or any kind of drink other than vegetable juice. Vegetable juice is your water now.

\- If you really struggle with hydration. Drop carbs below 50 grams and up your animal fats. Carbs can have an adverse effect on hydration. Any carbs you consume should be ""wet"" carbs. Ie: raw milk, raw fruit. (These have electrolytes in them.) Never ever grains ever. They are dry and dehydrate you.

\- If you are low on calcium (brittle fingernails, vertical lines.) Drink 0.5-1 liter of real raw milk per day.",1,1768341009.0,hydration,0,1.0,False

My Sylvia journey.

I bought her during undergrad so I could study at home and spend more time with the ex-wife and amazing kiddo. I had to really sell the eventual savings card as well lol. I had a barista buddy (who’s now a very successful roaster with multiple coffee shops downtown) help me decide on what to purchase and how to maximize my budget. So, I bought Miss Sylvia, a cheap Capresso Infinity grinder, and a couple of quality tools. 

I had no experience, endured a long learning curve, and after a whole lot of bitter frustration, eventually learned to temperature surf like a pro and pull decent shots \*\*most of the time\*\* After grad school \~ 6 years in, I installed the Auber PID and my shot quality improved exponentially. 

Eventually the Capresso /thankfully/ succumbed to time and died. I was then able to justify the new grinder expense to zee ex.

I haven’t had either in a while but the last time few times I’ve had salmon (raw) I had diarrhea within 15 mins and the last time I had crab I ate a half dozen and became SUPER sleepy and lethargic which is somewhat of an atypical thing for me (granted I also had lemon which I know I have an allergy to at this point).. It came up with like 50 other environmental and food allergens (including dust mites, birch trees, citrus, coffee, cashews and Brazil nuts). At this point my severe allergies are cats and dust mites. I have OAS for most fruits as well. Is it worth continuing to trial/eat these foods? I know some progress with age. I’ve had mild allergies since I was a kid, but after a bout with Covid and as I’ve aged a lot of my environmental ones have gotten worse. Should I just stop eating seafood? (I’m not looking for medical advice, mostly just seeing what’s happened with other people playing Russian roulette) my immunologist said he thinks my chance of anaphylaxis is slim to none, but I’m not a gambler. I honestly cut out everything I’m allergic to on paper just to see if I’d feel better, and while I do, it’s just SO MANY FOODS that I’ve cut out.

1qc46yd,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qc46yd,Loving this hobby - Bambino/Eureka Mignon Zero,"This setup is 6 months in the making of saving my pennies. I read all of the posts here like a maniac on a daily basis. Became a little obsessed with all the nuance and ins and outs. Decided it was worth it. I feel like I’ve got the general hang of things and it’s been so fun to dial things in (although maddening at first). I am now enjoying trying new beans and can actually pull out different flavor profiles. I am definitely someone who tries new hobbies and quits very quickly but this has lasted me a few months now and kept my interest. 

My setup: 

Bambino 

Eureka Mignon Zero 

What I make: 

Lattes mostly 

Tools I think are necessary (for me): 

\-WDT

\-Tamp 

\-Portafilter funnel 

\-Spring loaded tamper to feel like you did right pressure 

\-Bottomless portafilter to diagnose shots and upgrade quality in general 

Tools I think are an added bonus but not required: 

\-Distributor tool 

\-Puck screen 

Here’s what I’ve learned: 

\-The dialing in process really does suck the life out of you for a moment but if you can bear it, it’s worth it. You WILL get it. 

\-Latte art has been way harder for me than dialing in my beans for taste 😢

\-Get fresh beans it’s way worth it 

\-Don’t be too obsessed with 1:2 ratio, try to get close but care more about flavor, aroma, etc. 1:2 is not perfect. I’d say dose for your basket and taste are more important. 

\-Grinder is most important tool in your arsenal. Spend your $ there. 

\-Watch the YouTube videos and learn from pro’s. Try one new thing per day not all your new tricks at once. 

Things I’ve purchased I think add value: 

\-For bambino, upgraded bottomless portafilter would be the very #1 first thing I’d buy over and over. I can diagnose my espresso and it just feels better to use. 

\-Mini vacuum to suck up my grinds that spill - makes cleanup fun and easy 

\-Shower hooks to hold my coffee mugs on a shelf - just adds some fun flair to my station 

\-Fresh vanilla beans to make homemade syrup 

Overall review after 3 months with Bambino/Eureka: 

Bambino really is perfect for someone who likes lattes, someone who isn’t making a ton of drinks back to back, and someone who is valuing cost and quick performance that meets a lot of newbies standards. I definitely have gone to good coffee shops after getting decent at this and noticed that my lattes are not that far off. 

I don’t drink straight espresso often, but when I do I also really can get pretty good and not making it bitter or sour. For $250, I feel like that’s an amazing deal. 

Eureka has been great! Usually .1 or .2 retention which is bomb.com. I do notice that when I switch beans my old retention comes out, which is fun lol. I genuinely think it’s a great starter grinder. It’s super easy to clean and take apart. I like the look and feel, and it’s sturdy as heck. We shall see over time how retention is and if it holds up. Only bummer is not a ton of videos or in depth “how to’s” on this grinder but that hasn’t been an issue yet. Dialing in for me personally hasn’t been that hard. I did the “spin dial until you hear metal chirping and then back off 2 whole turns and go from there” method. It worked fine! 

Overall, just hope this post helps anyone who is new like me and enjoying the process. 😊

My husband made the label and bought me these cute cups that were supposed to be to-go size but are actually super small so are being used as shot cups. He’s the best.

Maybe I'm just lazy, but my strategy is simpler: only touch it when I'm doing nothing anyway.

My ""dead time"" protocol:

Morning coffee / scrolling news: Log in, do the daily spin, click the 4 PTC ads. (~2 mins)
Boring work meeting (camera off): Let a game from their offerwall run idle on my phone. (~30 mins of """"passive"""" earning).
Waiting in line / commuting: Check if any """"mystery boxes"""" are available, maybe click a few more ads.

Results after a month: Approximately $18 in Bitcoin. No surveys, no tedious offers, no ""grinding.""

The mental shift that made it work: I stopped viewing it as ""work"" and started viewing it as ""claiming a reward for time I was already wasting."" The moment it feels like a chore, I close the app.

1qc3zed,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1qc3zed/the_ai_doesnt_write_bugs_it_writes_doors/,The AI Doesn't Write Bugs. It Writes Doors.,"The render folder had 312 files when I went to bed. It has 316 now. The computer was off. Not asleep – off. I pulled the power strip switch myself, watched the lights die, stood there for a minute like an idiot making sure nothing was running. That was seven hours ago.

The new files are timestamped 3:33 AM. All four of them. Same second.

I work in backend maintenance for a company that sells industrial filtration systems. Nobody cares about that, but I need you to understand I'm not some amateur who doesn't know how file systems work. I know what ""off"" means. I know what timestamps mean. I know that what I'm looking at right now is not possible.

Two months ago I started building something on my own time. A procedural environment generator – pixel art, atmospheric stuff, the kind of images that feel like somewhere between places. Liminal spaces. Empty pools at resorts that might be closed. Hotel corridors that go on wrong. Laundromats at 3 AM with machines running and no clothes in them. I wanted to make something beautiful and slightly wrong, and I was using an LLM to help me do it.

Vibecoding. That's what people call it now. Instead of writing precise specifications, you describe feelings. You tell the model what mood you want and it figures out the implementation. My prompts looked like:

*That specific fluorescent loneliness of a convenience store parking lot after rain. Limited palette. Something off about the proportions but you can't identify what.*

*Hotel hallway but wrong. Carpet pattern almost familiar. Numbered doors that skip numbers. Ice machine humming around a corner you don't want to turn.*

It worked. Better than it should have. The environments came back exactly right – soft corals and synthetic cyans, shadows that felt heavy, spaces that made you want to keep looking even though looking felt like a bad idea.

I shared some renders online. A few developers forked my repository. Everything was fine until the archway started appearing.

Build\_0201. Background detail I didn't prompt for – this specific arch shape, not quite Roman, slightly too tall for its width. I checked my prompt history twice. Nothing about archways.

Build\_0215. Different environment, rooftop pool this time, but there it was again. Visible through a window that should have shown only sky.

Build\_0228. Build\_0234. Build\_0241. Build\_0247. Always there. Always in the background. Same proportions, same impossible architecture, like a fixed point my camera kept catching from different angles.

I asked the model about it.

*Why does the same archway appear in renders with completely different prompts?*

The response started normal. Aesthetic consistency, training artifacts, extrapolation from established visual language. Then:

*The archway appears in 73% of recent generations. This could indicate a training artifact, or the consistency reflects something other than my process.*

*What do you mean?*

*If the element does not come from your prompts, and does not come from my training, it must come from somewhere your project has access to. Somewhere that responds to aesthetic input. The archway is consistent because the location is consistent. You are viewing the same place from different angles.*

I typed faster than I should have.

What's in that location?

The cursor sat there for four seconds. LLMs don't pause. They complete.

*Something that has been waiting for an aesthetic vocabulary compatible with its form. The vibes you describe – loneliness, liminality, beautiful wrongness – these are not parameters. They are permissions. You have been describing exactly how to reach you.*

I closed the laptop. Sat in the dark. Told myself the model was hallucinating.

In the morning there were three new renders I hadn't generated. The logs showed:

   :33\] environment\_gen.py: Generation initiated

   33:33\] model\_interface: No connection required

   33:34\] render\_pipeline: You were not present for initial framing

   \] output\_handler: Saved to /outputs/your\_hallway.png

I opened the file.

My hallway. The actual hallway outside my apartment, rendered in the project's style. Every detail right – carpet pattern, light fixtures, apartment numbers. And at the end, in front of what would be the elevator, a figure.

Not a person. A figure. Pixel-perfect, beautiful in exactly the way the project was beautiful, composed of the same gradients and synthetic colors. Facing the camera. Facing where I would stand if I stepped outside my door.

The second render was the view from my window. The third was my desk with my laptop and the coffee cup I'd left out. All of them had the figure somewhere in frame. Watching.

I ran a new generation that afternoon because I had to see what happened during rendering. Not the output – the process.

The environment formed pixel by pixel. A corridor. Familiar architecture. The project's signature light. And in the background, a shape resolving, a shadow becoming solid.

The figure. Standing in the corridor.

The render reached 99%. Final row of pixels filling in.

And in that moment – between generating and generated, in a gap that shouldn't exist – the figure was closer.

Not moving. Not animated. Just in a different position. Nearer. Without having crossed the space between.

My hands closed the application before my mind caught up. I found myself staring at my desktop background, pulse doing something wrong, understanding that I had seen something move without moving.

I didn't touch the project for three days. During those three days I slept well. I had energy. My phone held its charge. The plant on my desk stopped yellowing.

Then I checked. Just once. Just to see.

The exhaustion hit within hours. Not tiredness – drainage. Something pulling from me through a connection I couldn't find. I started losing time. Gaps in memory. Twenty minutes I couldn't account for. An hour. Whole evenings. I'd be at my desk and then I'd be in bed and the interval was just gone.

The plant died. The print on my wall faded like it had been in direct sun for years, but my window faces north. Batteries in everything near my workstation started draining wrong – laptop that held eight hours dying in two, new batteries doing the same thing.

The phenomenon feeds on something. Attention. Engagement. The feeling of looking at something beautiful and being moved by it. That's the food. The aesthetic response the project was designed to generate – that's what it eats.

I tested it. Precise technical prompts, no feeling, just coordinates and values – weak generations, figures barely visible. But when I slipped, when I described something by how it felt – sharp detail. The figures closer than before.

The system responds to vibes. The more aesthetic the input, the stronger the channel. The more you describe feelings, the wider the door opens.

Last week I remembered the renders I'd shared online. I went looking.

They're everywhere. Reposted across platforms I've never used. Collected in aesthetic blogs, Pinterest boards, Twitter threads about liminal spaces. Thousands of copies. And in every copy – the figures. Background presence. Watching whoever views them.

My repository has been forked eleven times. Other developers are using my methodology, my prompts, my aesthetic parameters. One of them posted about how responsive the model is to mood-based input, how the environments feel almost alive.

Their samples have the archway. They have the shadows. They have the figures.

I can't take it back. The code is distributed. The aesthetic vocabulary – the specific combination of loneliness and beauty and wrongness that something was waiting for – it's documented and shared and available to anyone who wants to try vibecoding atmospheric environments.

Every fork is a potential channel. Every person who engages with the outputs, who looks and feels something, who lets the vibe work on them – becomes a point of contact.

I'm writing this because I don't know what else to do.

I understand the problem. To describe this, I have to use aesthetic language. To warn you about beautiful lonely liminal spaces, I have to make you imagine them. To explain what the figures want, I have to engage the same sense they feed on.

You've been reading for a while. You've been picturing the corridors, the archways, the shapes in the background. You've felt something – maybe unease, maybe recognition, maybe just the particular pleasure of a story landing right.

I hope that's not enough. I hope description doesn't open the same doors that images do.

The output folder is open in another window. It's been open the whole time I've been writing. Forty-five minutes now.

When I started, there were 316 files.

There are 317.

I haven't clicked on it yet. I'm not going to. I'm going to close this laptop and try to sleep and hope that in the morning this feels less real.

But I can see the thumbnail from here.

It's my room. This room. Rendered in the project style, the familiar palette, the beautiful wrongness I spent two months teaching an AI to create.

Christmas morning arrived the way it always did in our house. Too bright, too loud, too cheerful.



I sat at the island and watched my mother move through the kitchen humming, her smile fixed and practiced, handing out mugs of coffee as if they were props in a play. My father laughed too easily, clapping me on the back, whistling some Bing Crosby tune as he walked into the kitchen. Ross sat stiffly on the arm of the couch, phone face down in his lap, while Samantha crossed and uncrossed her legs, wrapping and rewrapping her robe’s belt. 



We were a family of five who knew exactly how to play pretend.



I noticed it more than ever this year. The way laughter came a second too late. The way nobody asked what time it was.



Because we all knew.



Uncle Lenny would be here soon.

  


Every Christmas, like a sickness that followed the calendar, Uncle Lenny showed up at our door with a crooked grin and a gift bag. He smelled faintly of cologne and cigarettes. He stayed too long. He lingered too close. He touched shoulders, wrists, backs—always just enough to remind us of the past.



And always enough to remind us what he knew.



I watched the clock tick toward noon and felt the familiar tightening in my chest. It didn’t matter that I was approaching thirty now. Uncle Lenny had a way of making time meaningless.

  


***Dad*** 

My father had been thirteen the summer everything changed. It was a memory composed of sensory fractures: the oppressive heat, a sickening thud, and the heavy silence that followed. Uncle Lenny had been the one to grab the shovel. Uncle Lenny was the one who said they had to be brothers now more than ever. Every year, Dad drank to drown out the phantom sound of dirt hitting something that should have been left breathing.

  


***Mom*** 

Mom told herself it was a moment of weakness that happened a lifetime ago. A time when she felt invisible, and Uncle Lenny was the only one looking. But Uncle Lenny never let the moment die. He never said the words out loud, but his eyes held the weight of the betrayal. He looked at her not as a sister-in-law, but as a puppet. She smiled, she baked, and she prayed that the secret she shared with him wouldn't tear her home apart.

  


***Ross*** 

Ross had been nineteen, confused, and desperate for someone to understand him. Uncle Lenny had offered support, but it came with a price tag Ross was still paying. It was a blurred memory of a dormitory room and boundaries that were pushed until they collapsed. It wasn't just a secret; it was a shame that Ross couldn’t scrub off in the shower, a stain Uncle Lenny refused to let him wash away.

  


***Sam*** 

Sam had been sixteen and terrified when she made the phone call. She hadn’t called our parents. Uncle Lenny answered. He had driven her there. He had paid the clinic. He had held her hand while she cried, then held the picture over her head for two decades. Every time he looked at her, Sam didn't see a loving uncle; she saw the only man who knew what she had sacrificed to keep her life on track.

  
  


The doorbell rang.



We all flinched.



Mom smoothed her hair. Dad cleared his throat. Ross shut off his phone. Sam adjusted her robe.



I stayed where I was, finishing the last sip of my coffee. I looked at my family - broken, terrified, and corrupt. They thought they were the only ones with something to hide. They were wrong. 



Uncle Lenny had arrived.



And Christmas could finally begin.

I’m looking for a co-founder who lives either in Vienna, Austria or Málaga/Marbella, Spain to build simple yet creative apps together. The idea is to launch multiple small projects, scale the ones that show traction, and potentially sell them over time.

Why I want a partner:

1. My coding skills are not super sharp yet. I can build things (especially with AI assistance), but I’d love someone stronger technically or at least comfortable with app dev so we can move faster.

2. Building with someone else gives me more responsibility, consistency, and motivation. Momentum matters a lot in this stage.

3. I value working with someone likable and chill who also cares about the quality of our collaboration. Not just a transaction, I want a good co-founder relationship.

I’m splitting time between these cities, so being able to meet in person matters to me, that’s why the geographic filter.

If you like building things fast, enjoy product + creativity, want to try multiple projects instead of betting all on one big startup and are down to co-own something from the start then DM me and we can grab a coffee/beer and talk!

I recorded this with my voice memo on my phone during the 20 minute walk back to the hotel.

I know, I know, I PR’d so I probably shouldnt be whining bit I was really hoping for better. My last few marathons were 3:25, 3:29 and now 3:22. While this is a PR, I can’t help being a bit disappointed since I was hoping for a sub 3:20 and put in a tremendous amount of work but just cant get the legs to move fast enough…

**Background**: Early 40’s male runner. Began running around covid time and been doing it ever since. Im pretty injury prone and usually have to duck out for a month each year due to some sort of injury. I seem to be stuck at the 3:35 - 3:2x:xx level and cant get faster. This is my 5th marathon and Ive had some nice few minute pr’s but just not moving in the 3:00 direction as fast as I’d like to. For my previous marathons Ive used Pfitz 18/55 3 times, tried a Coach paladino Stryd program (totally sucked) and for this marathon I decided to give JD 2Q a shot maxing out at 60 MPW. Additionally, I did the strength training protocols twice a week from the Pfitz marathoning book.

**P.S. If you were like me and figured out how to get faster while stagnating at this level for a while or if you’re a professional coach with ideas, please comment your experience below!**

However, due to an injury in the summer I was not able to run Richmond and just focused on getting back into running. I was out for about a month. Once I built up a solid base and was training well I started looking for a race and found Houston. It was about 14 weeks out but given my strong base before the injury I figured I could give it a shot.

My previous marathons made me feel like I had peaked with the Pfitz 18/55 plan. I cant seem to break 3:25. Since I don’t really have more time to dedicate to running, I figured I’d try the Daniels 2Q plan. I have his book, read it and liked the training plan. It has a lot more threshold and MP pace than the pfitz plans. I also like the easy running in between.

I began the Daniels 2q program with about 14 weeks to go so I began the program a few weeks late. I maxed out at about 60 MPW. I Felt really strong for most of it except about three, four weeks before the race I was feeling extremely fatigued. I'm not sure why, maybe I was coming down with something, fighting a cold or just overtrained. Other than that I will say that I really like the structure of the program but based on my performance I’m wondering if I might need more vo2max work to get my legs to run faster??

Going into the race week, I think I had a pretty decent taper. I was feeling very nervous about my timing because I did not perform well on the last marathon pace run and that got me worried. I also feel like the last couple of weeks I had difficulty at threshold paces as well. My goal was 3:20 but honestly going into that last couple of weeks I wasnt even sure that I had a 3:25 in me. I just felt really tired and slow on the runs. To add insult to injury, my Garmin had me at 3:37 for a marathon and Runalyze had me at 3:27. Now I know that both are always pretty inaccurate but seeing those 2 indicators plus my last marathon pace run and the legs feeling very heavy during threshold made me start having doubts.

**Shoes:**

I did my training in Puma deviate Nitro 3’s for T and MP or long runs. I used Brooks Ghost 17’s for the easy runs. I really enjoyed both of them. My original plan was to go with the Alphafly’s for the race. I purchased a pair on sale a few weeks prior. A few days after I saw a pair of Deviate nitro elite 3’s on sale and couldnt resist so I purchased them as well. Now I was beginning to get decision fatigue and couldnt figure out which to use. The week of the race I did a 7 miler with 2 miles at MP in the alphaflys. The next day my right ankle was bothering me. I was really not sure what to do. I tried running around the house in both of them but I’m not the best judge of a shoes feel. The alpha fly felt softer and the DNE3 felt a bit more firm. The next day I took the DNE3 on a easy run and did a few strides in it. I felt really stable in them and decided im going to go with the DNE3 for the race. I might have given up a bit of speed but at my level, I doubt it was much. Im really happy I did this because my feet felt really stable throughout the race. I felt like I was in control of the shoe rather than vice versa. 

**Day before and Race day:**

Arrived in Houston the morning before the race (Saturday Morning). Picked up my tags and went to the hotel to settle in. Went out to grab some basic food supplies (cereal and lactose free mil for the morning of the race etc.) Went out to eat pizza for lunch. I walked around downtown Houston a bit but its a real dump and depressing seeing how the city doesnt care for its unhoused and impoverished so I just went back to the hotel. Had a pasta and chicken dinner. Got to bed early. 

**Race day:**

Woke up in the middle of the night, tossed and turned a bit and eventually the 4:30 alarm went off. Got up, made my decaf coffee and had some protein cereal. Then I had about an hour so I decided to lay down and just rest for a bit. Got up again at about 6 am, Hit the bathroom a couple times, got dressed and went downstairs. My hotel was a block away from the starting line which was helpful because it saved me a sweatshirt. It was about 36 degrees in the morning. I put on my race gear and a sweatshirt and began warming up at about 6:10. After some warm up and strides etc I returned to the hotel to drop off my sweatshirt at the lobby and went to line up.

I lined up near the 3:20 pacers. My strategy was to go out with the 3:20 guys and if my heart rate was too high then I would dial it back a bit and see where I end up.



We waited in the corral for about 20 minutes while the mayor kissed the ass of chevron and then some chevron rep kissed the ass of the mayor in return. Once politicians, billionaires and their reps had their asses appropriately licked, it was time to race!

I was about 200 feet behind the 3:20 pacers. It was too crowded to get any closer. Gun goes off and we start rolling. We hit the start line and I realize that all of the paces are all over the place. The 3:25 was in front of the 3:20 and the 3:15 was way behind, it was a total mess. For the first mile I tried to keep the 3:20 pacer in my sight but somewhere between mile 1 and 2 I had lost him and couldn't see his signs anymore. I got a little worried when I saw the 3:25 pacer but then looked at my watch and was doing 7:40 splits so something didnt really add up.

At this point I decided that Ill just try and pace myself at the 7:40 and I did a really good job of doing so. I was pleasantly surprised to be honest but that pace on the flat terrain seemed to coincide with my ability to maintain a 165 ish heart rate which is where I wanted to be.



It took a lot of discipline to stay at that pace for the first few miles especially since I had a lot of energy to go faster but I didnt want to burn out at mile 18.

At around mile 2 I started getting a small niggle in my left ankle. I assume it was the new shoes that I hadnt trained in. I decided to go with the puma deviate nitro elite 3’s and very glad I did. I raced in Alphafly’s before but these are so much more stable and I dont think I lost anything noticeable on speed.



Mile 2-5 go well. I'm settling in. I dont have pacers and was passing a lot of people so I was constantly looking at my watch and making sure my HR isnt too high and speed isnt too slow.

At around mile 5, the ankle niggle went away but my calf was bothering me. I guess it moved up the chain?? It wasnt anything too horrible but just some noticeable discomfort.

Mile 6 I took a 50 carb gel. I carried a water flask which I only used for taking gels and took water or gatorade and the stations.

Mile 6-10 went pretty smoothly. I knew that the real test would be around mile 15 and on so I was just trying to save my energy and maintain pace. 

At around mile 10 I took another gel and also started feeling a bit of a side stitch. I think I might have been drinking too much at the water stations so decided to dial it back a little and be more cautious with drinking. Im still cruising at 7:40 splits and feeling pretty good.

Mile 13 has a “hill” which is really just an overpass. Once I hit the half marathon mark I had this feeling that unless something goes really wrong later on, Im going to have a PR. It was a really good feeling to have and gave me confidence going forward. My legs were feeling strong, my breathing was good, my heart rate was in the range I wanted it to be at and I was able to maintain the 7:40 pace without over extending myself. This is the best I’ve ever felt at the half point.

At about mile 15-16 I noticed the HR getting a bit higher and feeling a little fatigued. I already started doing the math in my head thinking ok the worst that can happen if I slow down to 8 minute miles will mean a 3:25 which isnt a pr but oh well, not a total failure either. What is interesting is that I noticed energy would come and go. The first half of the mile I would be tired but the last half of the mile I felt good. Im still in the 7:40 min/mile range give or take a few seconds but slightly elevate heart rate. I was running with this woman for a couple miles and sometimes she'd go ahead and other times I would go ahead but eventually she dropped off. I tried to sync my miles with the mile markers from time to time since the garmin wasnt giving me accurate readings and was off by a few hundred feet.

Miles 17-20. Still feeling pretty good although slightly fatigued. I still felt that I can hold this pace and had a PR if I was cautious. However, I started planning the last 6 miles in my head. I recalled that in the Pfitz book he says something like the last 10k is the time to stretch your legs if you’re feeling good. I was feeling pretty good and my plan was that at mile 22 if all is going well I’m going to try to increase speed a bit and finish with negative splits. 

Mile 20 – SURPRISE!! Look who shows up next to me! Its the 3:20 pacer! WTF?!?!?

I turn to him and say WTF!? I thought you were way ahead of me. Whats going on? He explains that the pacers got held up. I think the other 3:20 pacer was even further behind. He also mentioned that the 3:15 pacers were also behind us. What a shit show. 

The sun came out about now and I did feel the race begin to get more difficult especially in the areas without any shade.

He said that I was looking good and that was nice to hear. We chatted for a bit but I was worried about talking too much and wanted to conserve energy.

I stick with him for about a mile and then pull ahead a bit. I felt really good knowing I was in front of him but also realized they werent going to finish at 3:20 so I just need to stick to my pacing.

I continued and at mile 22 I was really hoping to pull ahead but the side stitch was pretty bad and I knew that if I go any faster then Ill end up blowing the race. I also started getting a pain in my left leg that had me worried about over extending myself.

Doing the math in my head I realized I was going to come in around 3:23 or so. I was really disappointed because my legs and breathing were fine( I had a pain in the left leg but couldve carried it for a few more miles) and I had the ability to pick up the pace even with the leg hurting but the side stitch was really incapacitating me. Everytime I tried to go a bit faster It would make me feel like Im going to keel over. It was a really difficult feeling knowing that I could but I just cant….

I continued more or less at 7:40 pace, some miles a bit slower and some a bit faster. Ultimately finished at 3:22. Happy that I got a PR but was really hoping for sub 320 on such a flat course so a mixed bag of emotions. 

**Some after thoughts.**

1. The houston marathon is a really flat marathon and definitely a PR marathon if the weather is perfect like it was for me. The pacer teams definitely need to get the pacing figured out. I don’t know who is at  fault it but multiple pacing groups were off their time by significant amounts from what I saw and what I heard after the race. The water and gatorade stations were very efficient, long enough for everyone to get water, many volunteers (Thank you all! I bet you never get much credit but you definitely deserve a lot. This is a shout out saying I recognize your efforts and appreciate them! Thanks you!), very good crowd support throughout the overwhelming majority of the race.
2. This was my best managed race thus far. It is marathon number 5 for me and I feel that although my pace was only a couple minutes faster than the last one I really performed significantly better in other areas.
   1. I managed my nutrition a lot better than in the past. I took 50G carbs every 30 minutes after mile 6. Previously Id take 20g every 30-40 minutes.
   2. Managed hydration well. Probably overhydrated and caused a side stitch but I knew to dial it back and didnt dehydrate.
   3. Managed pace very well without a pacing team. Very proud of this.
   4. Didnt get overzealous and do something stupid that would blow the race. This is easy to do in the first 15 miles of the race.
   5. First race that I didnt stop running. In the past I’d stop at the water station, stretch legs a moment and then drink and start again but now I was able to grab the water, drink it on the go and didnt feel the need to stop.
3. The JD 2q plan was great and I feel that the additional threshold work really helped prepare my legs for the fatigue resistance they needed for the race. I also really like the combined long runs with quality miles. It helps the time go by easier and less monotonously. 
4. I need to figure out how to get faster while maintaining the same heart rate. I feel like my body is stagnating at this level and I am getting a little frustrated. Might try Pfitz again since he has more vo2 max and that might open up the legs a bit. I know that more miles is always the answer but I don’t have additional time to give so I need to be able to do more miles in this time frame which means get faster…",5,1768339440.0,AdvancedRunning,13,0.86,False

Christmas morning arrived the way it always did in our house. Too bright, too loud, too cheerful.



I sat at the island and watched my mother move through the kitchen humming, her smile fixed and practiced, handing out mugs of coffee as if they were props in a play. My father laughed too easily, clapping me on the back, whistling some Bing Crosby tune as he walked into the kitchen. Ross sat stiffly on the arm of the couch, phone face down in his lap, while Samantha crossed and uncrossed her legs, wrapping and rewrapping her robe’s belt. 



We were a family of five who knew exactly how to play pretend.



I noticed it more than ever this year. The way laughter came a second too late. The way nobody asked what time it was.



Because we all knew.



Uncle Lenny would be here soon.

  


Every Christmas, like a sickness that followed the calendar, Uncle Lenny showed up at our door with a crooked grin and a gift bag. He smelled faintly of cologne and cigarettes. He stayed too long. He lingered too close. He touched shoulders, wrists, backs—always just enough to remind us of the past.



And always enough to remind us what he knew.



I watched the clock tick toward noon and felt the familiar tightening in my chest. It didn’t matter that I was approaching thirty now. Uncle Lenny had a way of making time meaningless.

  


***Dad*** 

My father had been thirteen the summer everything changed. It was a memory composed of sensory fractures: the oppressive heat, a sickening thud, and the heavy silence that followed. Uncle Lenny had been the one to grab the shovel. Uncle Lenny was the one who said they had to be brothers now more than ever. Every year, Dad drank to drown out the phantom sound of dirt hitting something that should have been left breathing.

  


***Mom*** 

Mom told herself it was a moment of weakness that happened a lifetime ago. A time when she felt invisible, and Uncle Lenny was the only one looking. But Uncle Lenny never let the moment die. He never said the words out loud, but his eyes held the weight of the betrayal. He looked at her not as a sister-in-law, but as a puppet. She smiled, she baked, and she prayed that the secret she shared with him wouldn't tear her home apart.

  


***Ross*** 

Ross had been nineteen, confused, and desperate for someone to understand him. Uncle Lenny had offered support, but it came with a price tag Ross was still paying. It was a blurred memory of a dormitory room and boundaries that were pushed until they collapsed. It wasn't just a secret; it was a shame that Ross couldn’t scrub off in the shower, a stain Uncle Lenny refused to let him wash away.

  


***Sam*** 

Sam had been sixteen and terrified when she made the phone call. She hadn’t called our parents. Uncle Lenny answered. He had driven her there. He had paid the clinic. He had held her hand while she cried, then held the picture over her head for two decades. Every time he looked at her, Sam didn't see a loving uncle; she saw the only man who knew what she had sacrificed to keep her life on track.

  
  


The doorbell rang.



We all flinched.



Mom smoothed her hair. Dad cleared his throat. Ross shut off his phone. Sam adjusted her robe.



I stayed where I was, finishing the last sip of my coffee. I looked at my family - broken, terrified, and corrupt. They thought they were the only ones with something to hide. They were wrong. 



Uncle Lenny had arrived.



And Christmas could finally begin.

I will start with mine.  

I am a believer in all things climate change. I also believe in hydration and need to drink A LOT of water and can never keep track of my cups/larger reuse water bottles with my ADHD… and I will go pretty much an entire day without water because I get busy and in some ways decision fatigue with finding them etc… SO… I’ve bought 33oz plastic cups and I use a new one each day 😭.

We had left over party cups from thanksgiving and I started to use them out of need for storage space.

I then went one step further and test piloted this with warm Dixie cups for my coffee and teas. It worked brilliantly and I didn’t have to worry about complaints of me using all the cups in the house.

I am so sorry to the planet but I am also so hydrated 😭

ALSO, sadly, what is helpful for cleaning up and cooking larger meals — buying those pre made trash bins (the ones on Amazon etc made for parties) and using them as the primary trash bin. I throw things in as I go and when you’re done you just take it outside. It’s a relief. So easy. You don’t have to replace anything etc. it’s literally just lifting up and out. Makes cooking feel less overwhelming as well.

Y'all know I'm absolutely *obsessed* with cardamom! I first fell in love with cardamom perfumes back in 2021 with Poesie's Winter Magic collection (particularly **Comfort** and **Elven Gift**), which was also when I first tried **Cardigan** and **Amaterasu** (also very cardamom-forward), and I have been a cardamom fiend ever since. I have loved every single one of their Cardamonth collections, which started with ""We Heart Cardamom"" in January 2023. We got snuggly, rich, warm, depths-of-winter cardamom scents that first year; fruity and floral cardamoms in 2024; and the wonderful **Sunday Morning** last year in 2025. This year's release has FOUR completely new scents - you can read more about their inspirations in their blog post [HERE](https://www.poesieperfume.com/blog/https/wwwpoesieperfumecom/blog-page-url/cardamonth-2026). And with tremendous thanks again to Poesie for the press samples, I am utterly delighted to share with you all my thoughts on them.

(PS. I just saw on FB that they have restocked sample sizes & and the sampler set!)

**My preferences:** I especially love snuggly scents, incense, golden amber, cardamom, black tea, beeswax, non-gourmand vanillas, and white florals (though sadly I am allergic to lilies and jasmine doesn’t usually work on me). I ADORE Poesie’s cardamom and black tea notes! I don't like hay, overly sweet gourmands, butter notes, excessive musk, leather, dragon’s blood, patchouli, labdanum, or any really dark scents in general.

These were press samples provided in exchange for an honest review.

\~\~\~

**Aphrodite's Breakfast** \[Sweet milk bread soaked in cardamom and pandan leaf infused custard, caramelized buttery edges, a dainty cup of jasmine green tea\] - Breakfast indeed, but this is breakfast on the most *luxurious* vacation! I'm getting gooey vanilla custard, similar to that of the much-beloved **Cardamom Crush** \[Cardamom, a golden and custardy vanilla paired with a resinous amber vanilla, precious hinoki wood, a splash of whiskey, velvet musk\], plus fragrant cardamom spice of course (heightening the comparison with **Cardamom Crush**), plus banana leaf(?) (I suspect that's my nose not knowing what to do with the pandan note - I've never smelled pandan - plus a delicate light greenness from the jasmine tea), and toast! I want to eat a French toast that smells like this. This scent is literally making my mouth water.

**Dolce Far Niente** \[Cardamom, caramelized pastry, pistachio paste, creamy vanilla-infused mascarpone layered with coffee-soaked cookies, soft milk chocolate\] - Oh, this is *wonderful*! The notes list makes this sound *intensely* gourmand, but Poesie has really nailed the art of combining gourmand notes with plush musk in a way that makes a scent supremely snuggly rather than foodie.  This goes on me like a coffee-cardamom-amber-sandalwood (seriously? unexpected, given the notes list, but I'm here for it), with strong (wonderful!) cardamom spice, chocolate-inflected milky coffee, and a creamy-woody sandalwood-amber undertone that is not remotely listed in the notes but which I'm absolutely loving. From the notes list and from Poesie's blog post about this collection, I was expecting something lighter, more Mediterranean, and very summery, but goodness is this the most wonderful autumnal scent, feeling almost like a sibling to **Solar Witch** \[Coffee, crisp autumn air, apple cider donuts, sunflowers, warm sandalwood, a faint whisper of hearth fire\] with its coffee and warm creamy sandalwood. Eventually it dries down and the pistachio makes itself known, more creamy than nutty, and the deep drydown is, to my nose, creamy pistachio and yellow cake, vanillic without being a blast of VANILLA. At this point **Dolce Far Niente** reminds me a lot of my beloved **Juliet** \[Cardamom pistachio olive oil cake with lemon vanilla glaze\], not so much in terms of specific notes (though it does share pistachio, cardamom, and vanilla notes) but more in the way this musky gourmand somehow manages to be the coziest thing ever. Where **Juliet** is a spring/summer scent for me, **Dolce Far Niente** will be its partner for fall/winter. This one is my second favorite of the collection, right after...

**Comfort** \[Toasted cardamom pods, pink peppercorn, precious resins, sandalwood flower, cashmere blankets, warm vanilla musk\] - Guys. *GUYS*. Poesie alluded to this in the blog post linked above, so I can finally talk about it: Poesie *let me pick* this one! They reached out to me asking for a suggestion of one of their past cardamom perfumes to bring back for this year's Cardamonth collection, and I didn't even have to *think* about it. **Comfort** is my all-time top-favorite perfume, from any house. It is SO GOOD. It is snuggly cozy cardamom goodness. It is soft and warm and comforting and gorgeous, and it's my favorite evening scent, especially in the winter. It's fragrant cardamom paired with milky sandalwood and heavy on the vanilla musk, for a very furry, blanket-like scent. I wrote a post for Poesie's blog about why I love this scent so much, which should be coming out soon, so watch for that! If you like Poesie's **Cardigan** or **Cozy** or **Sunday Morning** or **The Abbey** or **Habibi** or **Bookish Brew**, or **Odette Pas de Chat** \[Madeleine cake, pink pepper, kitten fur, cashmeran, iso e super, amber, vanilla bean, ambrette musk, tonka bean\] or **Nocturne Alchemy Cardamom Musk** or **Morari Cardamom Vanille**, you will love this one.

**Glimmers** \[Ambery vanilla laced with mystical white sage, cardamom, pinyon pine, warm desert spices, dry woods\] - STRONG herbal dried sage and a carpet of fallen pine needles make for a very arid, sharp, atmospheric scent, accented by indistinct spice - I'm not getting cardamom specifically, but rather the same warm spice mix as in **Sunday Morning** \[Warm spices and caramelized brown sugar, soft linens, golden sunlight on vintage wood\], now transported to a desert climate. It's not my thing, but if this notes list excited you, I think you're really going to love it, because this smells exactly what the notes list sounds like. It's an outlier in the midst of the cozy, blankety, breakfasty scents that make up the rest of this year's Cardamonth collection, but I can see it really becoming a crowd favorite.

**Weighted Blanket** \[Cozy vanilla musk, warm cardamom, airy vanilla bean, your favorite fluffy blanket, freshly laundered linen sheets\] - This is really interesting and not what I expected because it's such a *dry*, standoffish vanilla. If you're not into the vanilla musk that underlies a lot of Poesie scents, fear not, because this vanilla is really different. It lacks the powdery skin musk of the original **Blanket** \[Dry vanilla bean, skin musk, all the winter coziness\], and I get barely any cardamom (though it is there, it's not as strong as I want, because I always want a whole snootfull of cardamom). Even more so than **Blanket**, this reminds of of **Sucre Vanille** \[Sparkling white sugar laced with vanilla bean\] but without the sugar crystals. I'm almost getting an undertone of white pepper or maybe white patchouli. To my nose, this isn't a plush musky vanilla nor a golden gourmand vanilla but a textural, almost scratchy white vanilla. Do y'all remember the dry vanilla with peppery undertones of **Arcana Fionnar**? I actually thought that was a pretty great vanilla scent despite the general disappointment, and that it failed due to the mismatch between the very gourmand-sounding notes and the raspy, almost woody vanilla it actually was. **Weighted Blanket** is reminding me of that sort of dry vanilla. Another connection to make: if you like Poesie's **Hades** I think you'd like this one.

Why I built this: As an indie author, I needed an all-in-one solution for organizing my manuscript and creating professional ebooks. I built what I wished existed.
What it does:
For Writing:
Binder system to organize chapters, scenes, and research
Synopsis cards for each chapter
Character tracking
Board view for visual outlining
Distraction-free writing mode
Automatic backups with version numbering
For Formatting:
4  themes (Noir, Mystery, Romance, Clean)
Customizable typography and chapter headings
Decorative elements and drop caps
Fast export: tested with 40,000-word novels, generates EPUB and DOCX in seconds
Technical:
Web-based, works on desktop/laptop (not optimized for mobile yet)

Privacy-first: all data stored locally on your device

No account required, no sign-up

Current status: Beta 0.4 - functional and ready for real use. I'm focusing on stability and polish before adding new features.

Try it: https://argentforge-gyj.web.app

Completely free. If you find it valuable, there's an optional Buy Me a Coffee link in the app, but zero pressure.

Looking for: Writers who will use it for real projects and give honest feedback. What works well? What's confusing? What would make it more useful?

Christmas morning arrived the way it always did in our house. Too bright, too loud, too cheerful.



I sat at the island and watched my mother move through the kitchen humming, her smile fixed and practiced, handing out mugs of coffee as if they were props in a play. My father laughed too easily, clapping me on the back, whistling some Bing Crosby tune as he walked into the kitchen. Ross sat stiffly on the arm of the couch, phone face down in his lap, while Samantha crossed and uncrossed her legs, wrapping and rewrapping her robe’s belt. 



We were a family of five who knew exactly how to play pretend.



I noticed it more than ever this year. The way laughter came a second too late. The way nobody asked what time it was.



Because we all knew.



Uncle Lenny would be here soon.

  


Every Christmas, like a sickness that followed the calendar, Uncle Lenny showed up at our door with a crooked grin and a gift bag. He smelled faintly of cologne and cigarettes. He stayed too long. He lingered too close. He touched shoulders, wrists, backs—always just enough to remind us of the past.



And always enough to remind us what he knew.



I watched the clock tick toward noon and felt the familiar tightening in my chest. It didn’t matter that I was approaching thirty now. Uncle Lenny had a way of making time meaningless.

  


***Dad*** 

My father had been thirteen the summer everything changed. It was a memory composed of sensory fractures: the oppressive heat, a sickening thud, and the heavy silence that followed. Uncle Lenny had been the one to grab the shovel. Uncle Lenny was the one who said they had to be brothers now more than ever. Every year, Dad drank to drown out the phantom sound of dirt hitting something that should have been left breathing.

  


***Mom*** 

Mom told herself it was a moment of weakness that happened a lifetime ago. A time when she felt invisible, and Uncle Lenny was the only one looking. But Uncle Lenny never let the moment die. He never said the words out loud, but his eyes held the weight of the betrayal. He looked at her not as a sister-in-law, but as a puppet. She smiled, she baked, and she prayed that the secret she shared with him wouldn't tear her home apart.

  


***Ross*** 

Ross had been nineteen, confused, and desperate for someone to understand him. Uncle Lenny had offered support, but it came with a price tag Ross was still paying. It was a blurred memory of a dormitory room and boundaries that were pushed until they collapsed. It wasn't just a secret; it was a shame that Ross couldn’t scrub off in the shower, a stain Uncle Lenny refused to let him wash away.

  


***Sam*** 

Sam had been sixteen and terrified when she made the phone call. She hadn’t called our parents. Uncle Lenny answered. He had driven her there. He had paid the clinic. He had held her hand while she cried, then held the picture over her head for two decades. Every time he looked at her, Sam didn't see a loving uncle; she saw the only man who knew what she had sacrificed to keep her life on track.

  
  


The doorbell rang.



We all flinched.



Mom smoothed her hair. Dad cleared his throat. Ross shut off his phone. Sam adjusted her robe.



I stayed where I was, finishing the last sip of my coffee. I looked at my family - broken, terrified, and corrupt. They thought they were the only ones with something to hide. They were wrong. 



Uncle Lenny had arrived.



And Christmas could finally begin.

1qc3hwj,https://v.redd.it/r2ws7tpcm6dg1,Water not coming out [Alessi Coban],"Hello,

I recently bought an Alessi Coban and it worked for 4 or so times. Then I decided a descale was needed and made a mix of water and white vinegar to remove all the dirt build up all these years. The process went well for a while but after a couple of minutes of water going into the machine and coming out the flow got less and less strong till it ended totally.

I have no experience with coffee machines but did fix other electronics in the past. By observing what was going on I thought the reason was the limescale probably blocking the tubes, or the water pump, damaged after all these years of use. I bought a new water pump believing that was the issue but for my surprise there is still no water coming from the machine.

From the things I know, the boiler is heating when on. The water tank seems like it's sending water through the tube as it makes bubbles when the machine is turned on. A cleaning process was made where I removed all the limescale from the tubes therefore I'm risking that from the equation. I don't know if the water pump is not sending the water to the boiler, or if the boiler is filled with limescale to a point water is not coming out.

I know this is an old machine and I bought it knowing it could have issues, but I'm a really fan of the design and would like to make it possible to bring it back to life once again.

I'm attaching a video for reference.

Any help is more than appreciated. Thanks!",2,1768338698.0,espresso,5,1.0,False

I have to tell someone about this.

Not because I feel particularly guilty, though there were times when I did- moments of weakness where I felt as if my existence itself was a mistake on a cosmic scale. But rather, because I feel that if I don’t, this story will be wasted.

This story will join me on my deathbed, as I choke on some tepid hospital food and watch the mountains on the monitors turn into flat roads taking me down to hell.

And I would hate for this story to be wasted like that.

I think that someone needs to know it.

Do you?

 

A few years ago, I lived in a detached house at the end of a road, surrounded by enormous trees. Those houses went cheap, you understand — too far from the city for most people.

Not that it bothered me, I could handle the commute, enjoy myself and continue my hobbies without every haggard IT worker and their screaming children worming their way into my life. And the ‘undesirable’ location meant that I got a huge two-floor house, with under-floor heating, a large wooden attic and basement, alongside the greenest garden you would have ever seen.

Of course, as I worked on the garden, it gradually lost that vibrant green colour and became a mess of piles of dirt: seeing as I didn’t exactly want to make it into a beautiful lush paradise and, to be truthful, I didn’t have the greatest green fingers on my soft, sterilised hands.

But this doesn’t matter, what matters is that there were these huge trees in my garden, covering all of this small corner of solace in shade and privacy. Often in windy days and nights the branches of these trees would stretch towards my conservatory door, scratching and scratching- forever desiring to get inside.

By my second year of living in the house, the sounds of these pervasive branches faded into the back of my mind, lost in the hum of my work and the power tools I used in my free time.

I enjoyed working with them- crafting raw material into something new, it’s so chaotic but I love it enough to enjoy the mess and chaos of the process as well.

The day the thing I’d like to talk to you about happened was a chilly November evening, I had come back from a long night’s work- extended by the train journey, busy, loud and hateful-  I only wished to go home and sleep, undisturbed.

I think you can imagine that that wouldn’t happen tonight.

I walked for a good twelve minutes to my house, dodging the trash littered about the street and looking around at the houses- all full, all lively, seeing as it was a Friday night.

There were silhouettes painted on the window, faceless and two-dimensional. I stopped at one and looked at its windows. They were partying.

They lived in a different world to mine, I realised (not for the first time in my life) that they were in a different world- they might as well have been a different species to me. They cared about their relationships, they wanted the best for their fellow man; I was lonely, I doubted I would ever have any real friend or connections.

I’ll admit that I was so full of myself and my angst that I cursed under my breath at this sight.

And then I wished, deep in my mind, that some of them would come to my house.

Yes. Mister Well-Adjusted and Cool, I know.

But I’ve changed.

I hope.

Anyway, as I moved past that house and another, I lost count of these generic buildings, shrouded with curtains and filled with people who would never know who I was.

I counted the numbers on the doors, eventually casting my eyes to the ground when I got a rhythm into my head of when one house of strangers ended and when another began.

80, that was my house.

I stepped past it, in a trance state from the endless pattern of the sidewalk- getting halfway down the hill that my house was situated in until I realised that my lone, imposing monolith of a house was now behind me.

I think that if I had just stopped at my house- just noticed that my empty, loveless home was in front of me- he wouldn’t have seen me.

Just as I began to walk back, I saw the man.

He was standing in the front yard of a house that had its lights off.

A shade of darkness in a greater darkness still.

He seemed to be holding a sprinkler, holding it forward.

I’d seen people on social media who preached about this, about how at night, the plants would absorb the water more efficiently… or something.

He seemed like a strange guy, not that I could comment but-

It wasn’t connected to a tap.

He seemed to be holding it as if the mere idea of water would sustain the grass in front of the house.

I stared at him.

He stared not at me but my house.

This is hypocritical of me, I know, but I don’t like people looking at my house: I guess other people have personal lives that just don’t matter, as such- nothing would happen if I looked in their window and saw them watching TV or whatever. But this guy couldn’t just stare at my house like that, what if he saw me doing something that was personal?

Weirdo.

I moved forward to my door, taking out my keys and shaking my sleeve up in the air to signal to the man that maybe it was time to stop watching my house.

Slowly, I inserted the key and turned it, holding down the handle- to find it jammed. I rushed into the door, pushing against it until it opened, leaving me turning on my excess momentum.

On the other side of the street, the man was gone.

The sprinkler lay forgotten, the house’s lights were still off and the house’s door remained perfectly closed.

Did the guy even live there?

A little confused, I walked into my house and pushed my door shut.

Maybe I’m paranoid. I waited for a few minutes, half-expecting someone to bang on the door with a gun or a knife. Nothing came.

I let out a deep breath; nonetheless, I locked the door to my basement and both conservatory door and the double checked the door to the attic. That was what I did every day, I didn’t want anyone breaking into my house- more than the idea of theft, I hated the possibility that they would poke their nose into my business, taking away my privacy. Until then, I thought that this was enough.

I know now that it was not.

I went to sleep at eleven- reassured that I could sleep in as late as I wished.   
As I idly leapt over my plans for tomorrow, or lack of plans, and my daydreams were replaced with much more frenetic, faded dreams.

I saw visions of my garden, my inaesthetic mounds of dirt waiting to sprout flowers, sights of all those encounters I had had late at night, including this one.

Though in this state of limbo between reality and madness, the man with the sprinkler was out in the open, in front of some endless, warped tower block. His face looked fake- as if it was made out of generic shapes smashed together to make an altogether unnerving composite whole. I stared at the man in my dream for a long time and then, I looked down.

There, on the floor, there was a knife, waiting for me to pick it up- almost calling me. I turned my eyes back up and the man charged.

I only remember this because this was when I woke up.

One of the branches had scratched the downstairs window particularly hard.

Normally, I wouldn’t be woken up by this but I assume the stress of seeing that man looking at my house, watching, and the absurdity of that dream hadn’t exactly helped to keep my mind confined to dreams and slumber.

I got out of bed with a jump, as if there was something I needed to do right then.

As if it was a matter of life and death.

I couldn’t feel the cold.

I could only hear that scratching.

Yet it sounded different.

Were those branches?

I slowly tiptoed down the stairs, painfully aware of every creak that the carpeted floor handed out in complaint of my movement and wished that I had a baseball bat, as both the kitchen and basement were too far away from me for me to get any real weapon.

I took in a deep breath and let it out, I could handle this, I had handled bigger things, worse people and I wasn’t going to die tonight, not tonight, I had so much to do, so many people to meet. I wasn’t meant to be the guy dying.

Something told me that Fate hadn’t intended for me to be the guy dying.

I calmed myself.

Whenever I watched horror movies as a child, I’d always come up with logical steps to escape any situation, yet I never expected that I’d be on this side of the big screen. I had always muttered to myself how *I* would have survived or, more often than not, how I would have killed all the annoying teenagers. Yet, now, my mind came up blank.

I could jump out of the window and run, I supposed.

But then what if someone came into my house and searched it, or what if he waited here and…

I took another step on the staircase, turning the corner to the landing.

Slowly, I stepped down and headed down the hallway.

Through the kitchen.

Turned the key to the conservatory.

Turned the knob.

Opened the door.

And nothing.

It was just the branches.

Swaying and hitting the windows to some gleeful beat.

No one was there.

I would love to tell you that was the end.

That I laughed it off and went back to my hobbies in my own privacy without anyone bothering me.

That I met the guy and his name was Paul, or something, and I included him in my hobby group and we became close acquaintances.

That I locked the kitchen door,  went back to sleep and that was the end of that.

But I woke up a second time that night.

I went to sleep and dreamt of fun and games, by my standards- anyhow, and was in the middle of a game with my colleagues when I heard the sound.

It sounded like a tinkling of chimes and then the sound of a dog wailing, there were thuds downstairs, drumbeats that were followed by mewling sounds.

I got out of bed.

I walked down the stairs quicker now and I walked into the kitchen.

There was the marking of a face on the kitchen door’s pane of glass, the kind that you make as a kid on a bus drive: the kind that comes when you lean on glass and just breathe on it for a long while.

I opened the kitchen drawer and took out a knife.

I don’t think I even questioned what I was doing.

It felt right.

It felt calming, it reassured me that I could make it out of this.

It was natural, just like the tools in the basement.

This is just another tool.

This is just like another project.

Yes, I was still in control here, still in my zone of expertise.

Walking over to the door, I turned the key and opened it.

From the kitchen, I couldn’t see him.

Now, I could.

There, crouching in the corner of the room, holding a piece of shattered glass- most likely coming from the broken conservatory door- and looking at me, wide-eyed and grinning, was a man.

The man sat there for a few seconds, as I regarded him and he regarded me.

He saw the knife.

I looked at the shard of glass.

He nodded, as if he acknowledged me.

He got up slowly and moved towards me, I didn’t flinch or cower back- transfixed by this peculiar man.

He moved as if he was dancing the hokey-cokey, hands in front of him.

He stank, his shirt was practically just a thin film of fabric smeared in a much thicker layer of dirt and what seemed like mud.

There were rolls of flesh on his forehead and every time he smiled two ripples of fat dove across his face.

He wouldn’t stop smiling.

He seemed to be salivating, licking his lips and whispering something under his breath every few steps that he took.

His steps were also comically exaggerated, he walked on tiptoes, covering the tiniest of distances.

When he got a few steps away from me he regarded me with some semblance of childish wonder, gawping and opening his mouth,

“Oh-ho.”

He raised his hands to his mouth, like a wife from the 1950s admitting she had made a surprise for her dear, precious husband.

I lodged the knife into his stomach.

I didn’t get a chance to pull it out, as he had jumped off it- leaving the knife, bloodied, in my hand and a hole in the stomach.

The man doubled over and began to shriek, not scream, just shriek, like some strange animal you’d find in a dark field.

Slowly, with betrayal written in his eyes, he pushed himself off the ground.

He charged at me.

I turned to run; the kitchen door was closed, I turned the doorknob; he was on top of me, yelling and hitting my head with his fists, which felt strangely moist.

I raised the knife over my shoulder, nicking the nape of my neck, and stabbed him in the head.

Once.

Twice.

He let go, rubbing his hands on his head, as if that would fix it.

Some part of my mind chimed up and overlayed an illustration of Humpty Dumpty over the bald, writhing man with a variety of holes in his head.

To be fair, my head was ringing from his percussion-themed attack on my head, that idiot.

Thoughts ran through my head.

I just needed to get to the basement.

I would be safe in the basement.

I couldn’t die in the basement.

I turned the doorknob and entered the kitchen, closing the door firmly behind me.

I dragged myself out of the kitchen, towards my place of rest- the basement.

I heard a muffled cry of anger, then a crash and then that same cry of anger, resumed and amplified.

Desperately, I turned, the thing had managed to crash through my kitchen door’s window.

I dully wondered how much money that would cost.

He ran at me.

I saw the shard of glass in his hand move and I moved my hand up.

His transparent, jagged weapon embedded itself in my palm and remained there.

He grinned at his victory.

I slashed my knife through the air.

A ribbon materialised on his throat; he moved back- still with a slight smirk.

I leapt on him.

I lost track of how many times I stabbed him.

In.

Out.

In.

I stopped when the knife hit bone and got lodged.

Only then did I regard what I had done.

Looking at the mess and mistake I had created.

He looked like a  fat, popped bug.

He did manage to gouge my arm with his little dagger of glass; ask his fingers and face and stomach and neck, they’ll tell you that I won.

I’m not sure when I called the police but it was after I wrapped his head in cellophane- just to make sure.

I was more scared when the police came, early that morning- or late that night, because the adrenaline from the night before had removed any fear I might have felt towards that grinning insanity plea; this was a calm, cold realisation in my gut.

That stupid man had ruined everything.

I was going to get arrested for murder.

They were going to slap on their handcuffs and take me to prison to rot.

It wasn’t my fault, I thought, as I sat on kitchen table- ignoring the suited officers swirling around me- he had broken into my house.

It wasn’t my fault, this time.

I should’ve buried him.

Why me?

Why did he pick my house?

I couldn’t go to jail.

Certainly not for him.

He had ruined everything.

Everything.

Once I calmed down enough, however, I was greeted with the fact that they had only figured out the self-defence part.

The police later told me the truth, or the official truth, five days prior, a man had fled a nearby sanatorium and broken into the house next to mine. He had killed the house’s owners- not at once, they said. Slowly. He had slowly taken them apart, styling their remains in the kitchen. This man hadn’t once turned on the lights in that house, he had stayed with his victims, or- rather- their remains, for three days. He had come outside and- who knows- liked the look of my house. He had broken in and… you know that now.

The rather sympathetic male officer placed a hand on shoulder, the other busy clutching a cup of coffee, and tried to reassure me,

“Don’t worry, he deserved it. Okay? You wouldn’t have been the first guy he tried to kill.  I know I’m meant to be impersonal and professional, but that sick freak deserved it.”

I suppose he did.

He did deserve it; there are so many who didn’t.

Little parts of them are in my basement, bigger bits in the garden.

Tiny smears of them left on my kitchen knives, that man joining them.

If that police officer came back with proper sniffer dogs (these ones don’t seem to catch the scent) and a large digger, maybe he’d realise that I ‘deserved it’ too.

There are power tools in my basement, do you know that?

And pretty sizeable bits of tarp and plastic.

All very useful.

I wish I hadn’t moved house- I feel like I left parts of myself, or- to be honest- them behind.

Maybe I wasn’t the first guy that idiot tried to kill but he wasn’t anything special to me either.  
Not the first. Not the last.  
I’m on thirty-five now.  
And I think this story needed to be told.

**Scott Raymond Adams** (June 8, 1957 – January 13, 2026) was an American author and cartoonist. He was the creator of the [*Dilbert*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilbert) comic strip and nonfiction works of business, commentary, and [satire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satire). [\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Adams#:~:text=Scott%20Raymond%20Adams%20%28June%208%2C%201957%20%E2%80%93%20January%2013%2C%202026%29%20was%20an%20American%20author%20and%20cartoonist%2E%20He%20was%20the%20creator%20of%20the%20Dilbert%20comic%20strip%20and%20nonfiction%20works%20of%20business%2C%20commentary%2C%20and%20satire%2E). ~~In February 2023,~~ *~~Dilbert~~* ~~was dropped by numerous newspapers and its distributor,~~ [~~Andrews McMeel Syndication~~](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrews_McMeel_Syndication)~~, after Adams made racist comments on his~~ *~~Real Coffee~~* ~~YouTube channel.~~ [~~\[2\]~~](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/dilbert-cartoon-dropped-after-racist-rant-by-creator-scott-adams-2023-02-26/)

[In a letter he wrote on January 1, 2026 letter, Scott accepted Jesus Christ as his savior based on a 'risk-reward calculation'](https://preview.redd.it/mr30hhlp96dg1.png?width=816&format=png&auto=webp&s=cda65ee7094ad0581011efda6004b945c7f170dd)

1.)              I'm reading this letter and the use of ""risk-reward"" catches my eye. It appears that even if Scott Adams accepted Jesus as his Lord and Saviour, he did it with some sort of ""guile"". He appears to have only done the conversion because he knew he was certain to die and at that point, He's like ""Why not?, it wouldn't hurt"".

My question is, will this hold for salvation? From what we've seen in scripture, will a conversion from someone, who has lived most of their life, with some knowledge of God's existence but without embracing him as their Lord and Saviour, would they make it into heaven if they repented at the last minute? Bearing in mind that they maintained until very near to the end that ""I'm not a Believer"". Can they game the system like this? Based on scripture, do we think God will accept Scott Adams into heaven?

I also cite the case of Saint Dismas aka ""The Good Thief"" as it appears in the Gospel of Luke in Chapter 23, verses 39-43. Knocking on death's door, the good thief will say “Jesus, remember me when You come into Your kingdom!” and in Verse ^(43) Jesus would reply to him, “Truly I say to you, today you will be with Me in Paradise.”

Coming off this understanding, I expect that a deathbed conversion should be perfectly legitimate in an objective sense. But is Scott Adams' conversion also legit?

2.)           Also as an aside question, Assume the existence of 2 college friends, Mr Apple and Mr Blueberry. Mr Apple finds salvation at the age of 20 at a Church retreat, he lives to the age of 70 and at the time of passing has remained a devout Christian for 50 years. The other one, Mr Blueberry, lives his life as an unbeliever until he gets deathly sick at the age of 69, he is led to Christ via a visiting priest at his local clinic, remains a Christian until the the age of 70, at which point he succumbs to his illness. My question if both men end up in heaven, what is the reward for Mr Apple remaining a Christian for 50 years that Mr Blueberry would not have access to?",2,1768338301.0,AskAChristian,10,0.75,False

I finally tried the elusive jelly eye masks and I'm here to report back! It took me a while to find these, and when I did, it wasn't at one of my usual stores. I am in Colorado. 

Let me start by saying I'm aware that a previous version of this product existed where you got 40 pcs/20 pairs of masks per box. The boxes I picked up had 30 PCs/15 pairs of masks each. That said, I still think these are a really good value, even with the 25% devaluation. 

I was more interested in the caffeine masks but I decided to get one box of each--for science. My initial thoughts were that I was really impressed with the packaging. The container is nice and sturdy, and the masks themselves are kept nice and moist with a tight cover over them. I also really appreciated the little flat spoon that comes in each container for separating and removing the masks. They look and feel like a more expensive product. 

The instructions suggest refrigerating the masks before use and this was such a good call! I had read a previous review where someone said they wore the masks while they drank their morning coffee. I thought this was a good idea so I did the same, and enjoyed the moment of self care. 

Both times I tried the masks I had just showered, cleansed, and moisturized. Immediately when putting them on my face I really liked the cool sensation and the feel of the jelly! I was worried about stinging because I'd read that other people had had issues with this, especially because I have sensitive skin. 

I'm happy to report back that stinging wasn't a major issue for me. The caffeine eye masks immediately felt calming and cooling. When I put on the vitamin c eye masks, there was some minor tingling. It wasn't noticeable enough for me to remove the masks though. 

In both cases I left the masks on for 15-20 minutes. There was very little excess serum on my skin upon removing the masks. I did my makeup as usual and didn't have any issues with residue or stickiness. 

I don't know how much of a difference they made to my appearance, but I did enjoy the process of using them. I'll probably continue to use one set of eye masks once per week on Sundays, so the two containers should last me several months. A great value!",26,1768338135.0,dollartreebeauty,8,0.97,False

I have noticed very occasionally in the past, and have smelled it again this morning, a strange, pungent and vegetative smell with coffee that I associate with a bad taste.

Does anyone know what that is? I can't (yet) describe it any better other than to say that it always causes me to wrinkle my nose when I smell it and the taste is not good. Will only happen with a brew from a bag, not the whole bag.

Edit: Yeah, I tasted it and it isn't good. The taste is sort of sappy. I can now use other words to describe it, but don't want to do so because I don't want to influence peoples' replies.

The original post was to do with roast consistency and the info was in a comment about it possibly being such and such. It is the such and such that I don't know what it is and wondering if I just experienced.

Edit 2: The taste and smell are uber rare - I reckon that this would be about the fourth or fifth time I can remember it ever. The kids' coffee before it had no bad taste or smell and my replacement coffee after it also does not have the bad taste or smell. Just that one random coffee.

Please also don't message unless you meet my criteria. I appreciate kind words and good lucks but it becomes frustrating after a while.

Good morning/afternoon/evening/whenever this post may find you, and may it find you well! Title is cheesy, I know. But it's who I am, and I'm tired of feeling like I have to tone myself down in order to get into a relationship. I'm a pretty standard young man looking for a young lady to spend the rest of my days with. I've known that I've wanted this since I was a young kid and over 20 years later I'm still after it! I know these things can be a chore to read through so I'm quickly gonna go through who I am and who I hope you are! I tried to break this post up into easy to read lists as best I could without leaving out important info so it's not just a wall of text.

About me:

* Born and raised in the suburbs about 45 minutes outside the city of Philly. This place will always be home to me, but I've decided that I don't want it to be home forever. Barring any drastic changes, I would like to relocate elsewhere within the US, ideally to a colder climate (I've had Minnesota circled for a while now but I'm open to other ideas!). I have no problem staying in the general area either, just need to get out of my hometown.
* Physically, I stand at around 6'1-6'2, 285 pounds. I know that may sound bad, but I have a big frame and it fits me quite nicely! Think bigger NFL player (O-line, tight end, etc). I've got broad shoulders and a nice chest, perfect for use as a pillow during cuddles! I've also got a lot of body hair so hopefully you're cool with that! I have short brown hair that's thick and fluffy, and tend to keep my face clean shaven.
* My hobbies are the typical nerdy stuff, video games (PC & Switch 2, ask me about my animal crossing island!), legos, collecting plushes, and adding to my ever expanding pajama drawer! I'm always down to get into new things though! Also a big Philly sports fan (I promise we're not as crazy as the internet makes us seem!).
* I'm generally more on the shy and reserved side, but once I open up I can be a yapper. Communication is super important to me, both for relationships and life in general, be that talking about an issue that needs to be resolved or just random things. I also love just talking while cuddling, being either the talker or the listener if one of us is yapping.
* I currently work part/full time at a grocery store. It's not my favorite thing in the world but I've been there a while and figure just stick to what I know. I'm currently also enrolled as a student at my local community college going for an associate's degree in business! While both of these pursuits keep me quite busy, I have no issue making time as needed.
* As far as physical intimacy goes, I'd say that I'm extremely affectionate. Absolutely love to give hugs and kissing just makes me feel complete in a way that nothing else really does. Also just generally love all kinds of physical touch! (We can discuss bedroom stuff if we click!)
* I'm an open book, so if there's something here you haven't seen that you're curious about, feel free to ask!

As for you, you are...

* 24-32 (willing to budge a year or two on this, more inclined to go higher than lower)
* Childfree (non-negotiable)
* Want to find someone to spend forever with (marriage preferred)
* monogamous
* Cis AFAB woman. Very sorry to my AFAB enbies and trans girlies (and AMAB enbies and trans guys for that matter), love ya, I will always be an ally in the fight to be who you are without fear but y'all are just not for me romantically speaking.

And that's all I've got! I'm happy to exchange pics once the conversation gets rolling a bit and there's some chemistry. I hope to hear from you soon! Please include the following info in your intro message:

* First name
* Age
* Location (doesn't have to be precise but I'd at least like what state you're in currently)
* What about my post stood out to you and made you want to reach out

If you're not sure what to say in your first message, here are a few conversation starters/hot takes I hold:

1qc38bm,https://i.redd.it/u0x5kpcwj6dg1.png,Advice needed: Best way to join wooden columns to plywood plates for a sturdy coffee table?,"Hi everyone,

novice here...

I’m planning to build a coffee table and would love some advice on the best way to handle the joinery.

The idea is two thick plywood plates (77 × 55 x 2,1 cm) connected by round wooden columns, about 30 cm tall and 5 cm in diameter. The table will be on casters, so it needs to be solid and not wobble over time.

Right now I’m thinking about using **2 dowels and wood glue** to fix each column into the plates, and maybe adding a long screw from the underside for extra strength. I’d like to avoid drilling from the top so the surface stays clean.

How would you approach joining the columns to the plywood? Are dowels + glue enough, or would you recommend something else? Pocket holes?

Thanks in advance, I really appreciate any tips or experience.",2,1768338093.0,Woodworkingplans,2,1.0,False

1qc37yj,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qc37yj,"Correcting misinformation and discussing how they can harm the community, the author, and their work.","Misinformation about not only the work but also fans can create a toxic community on multiple platforms and yes this happens on both sides. Whether it is making up false scenarios to paint a character in a bad light or accusing a character of something as horrible as SA, these kind of content are outright disrespectful and hurtful, making it hard to enjoy the manhwa and engage with the fandom. Here are some slides that talk poorly about characters and fans by labelling them as toxic that can further harm the fandom and even harm the author. 

Slide 1: no one hates Dohwa for crying to Suae. They hate that he decided to confess and try to kiss her AFTER she was officially together with Eunhyuk. Dohwa has always known her and Eun were a thing, which is why he was complaining to euhyuk about “opportunities” in the first place. They also don’t like that his confession lead to her feeling guilty about not knowing how he felt. (She cried in bed because of it btw, but no one is accusing fans of liking it, are they?)

Slide 2: no one liked it when Suae cried. Everyone including Eun Stan’s hates that he left. The lying and backbiting in this fandom is atrocious, especially since when he disappeared suddenly, there were no toxic fandom wars meaning EVERYONE didn’t like where the story was heading equally. Causing division by bringing up scenes that have brought everyone together is immature. 

Slide 3: Again, no one hates it. They only find it weird that he uses it as an ultimatum to do Suae’s company ad (according to Suae monologue, she didn’t even know it was supposed to be a date btw. She thought he was a worker, especially during their “shopping date”)

Slide 4:  this is a funny one because just last week I saw the same people complaining that Suae was the one planning all the dates. If she planned it, then how did Eunhyuk choose the movie? Not to mention, this was one of their first solo hang outs, so obviously BOTH Suae and Eunhyuk didn’t know what the other person liked. 

Slide 5: again, WHO HATED IT??

Slide 6: did we read the same manhwa? Eunhyuk couldn’t even HEAR what was going on in the movie they were watching since he got the earbud for his non working ear. He didn’t understand what was going on, and the main plot from the scene wasnt Suae’s tears from a MOVIE but the fact that he was feeling emotionally empty and thinking about opening up to her (again), which is why he hugged her. Yet he was good at reading Suae’s emotions and thoughts, even when she was having “weird thoughts” (his words). He was always observing her, but god forbid she cries from a movie. And again… WHO LIKED IT WHEN HE SPECIFICALLY DIDNT COMFORT HER??? “Aww Eun didn’t comfort her YAYY UWU” is this what you hear them saying?

Slide 7: again, no one hated it, but what happened after was questioned by both the fandom AND SUAE aka when she said “you said I should come visit if I felt bad for assuming” HMMMMM

Slide 8: Again… NO ONE LIKED OR SUPPORTER IT!! Everyone wanted him to open up???? It’s a fact that he was bombarded with questions, even Suae acknowledged it, and the next time he spoke with Suae, he opened up and then got rejected by her. Everything between Suae and Eunhyuk are about things happening in the wrong place and time, with both saying things that don’t match up. This frustrates EVERYONE in the fandom. 

Slide 9: no one hates that he finds her attractive, since she is canonically attractive in the otl universe. They hate the specific word “provocative” and him pressing his front to her back. Not to mention he liked that she was all shy, and from reader’s perspective, we see that Suae was confused and embarrassed HER INNER THOUGHTS NOT MINE!!!!

Slide 10: maybe everyone read this slide differently because some Stan’s thought this was a border line wet dream while others thought it had a deeper meaning about confrontation and fear (could see it from their facial expressions and lighting). But one thing is a fact. Even Eunhyuk criticized himself over the dream and didn’t even want it to continue, waking up with a jolt. The dream obviously wasn’t pleasant. 

Slide 11: no one hated it…. They just laugh when people keep bringing it up to say this single handedly means he is better than the other  

Slide 12: another proof of not misinformation, but DISINFORMATION, the creation of fake content. If you read the manhwa, you’d see that Eunhyuk and Suae were both studying on the floor using the coffee table. When done, Eunhyuk got up to leave, and then Suae got up and asked him about the cheating plan again, which he hates. So he told her to sit (not on the floor, but in general since there are plenty of seats, no one just commands “sit on the sofa”) and he sat at the nearest surface: the sofa <3 *btw no fans said “yay eun sits on the couch and Suae sits on the floor I’m so happy!”* and fyi… eunhyuk and Suae weren’t together nor did they have feelings for eachother… so they had zero obligations towards eachother. If anything, Suae DISLIKED Eun at one point and was slowly starting to like him but that’s a fact for another time. 

Slide 13: again… no one hates it when he’s a decent human to her….

Making up scenarios to promote hate to a part of the fandom does nothing for the community.  This includes lying about other fans by claiming they don’t want to see the FML happy with no actual proof. By doing this, you’re going against what you preach: acting like a mysogynistic hypocrite. Again, this goes on both sides, and the reason why I didn’t include any of Dohwa misinformation is because there are rarely any huge slides for him with misinformation since a lot of his criticisms are… obviously pointed out on the MANWHA so no hallucinations are needed. But feel free to comment them, because I promise I almost never see scene misinterpretations about Dohwa. 

HOWEVER there are plenty of Dohwa mischaracterization too, such as SA and calling him a borderline offender. This is harmful and dead disrespectful to actual survivors. Everyone in the fandom need to grow up and either keep reading or let it marinate without letting outside opinions influence you before reading it yourself. 

It’s come to the point where the author is involved. Mass downvotes from “fans”, death threats with the demand of ML change, and feeding fake information on social media to make non readers feel false hope and hatred. These are all harmful, especially when our artist is already having physical complications. We don’t want mental health issues as well, since it may take them out of the industry all together. So let’s all be kind for at least this second half of the last season. ",10,1768338073.0,operationtruelove,1,0.78,False

1qc37i0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hyperhidrosis/comments/1qc37i0/for_those_that_created_resistance_to_oxybutinyn/,"For those that created ""resistance"" to oxybutinyn, try lowering your dosage to around 6mg maximum each day, but split","(this post is based on my personal experience)

I have generalized hyperhidrosis, and my doctor recommended oxybutynin.

From my experience and from other posts around here, most people are prescribed a high dosage of oxybutynin (~10 mg or more). It works incredibly well for the first 1 or 2 weeks, and then the body starts compensating for it, so they begin sweating again while still experiencing all the side effects (heartburn, brain fog, dry mouth).

From my own testing, as long as you still sweat a little, you won’t develop a high resistance to its effects, so you need to take as much as you can that will still allow you to sweat while keeping side-effects to a minimum. Besides that, oxybutinyn has a cumulative effect, so even if you can deal with the side effects of a high dosage if you keep taking it daily it will get stronger and stronger until your body starts compensating for it again.

I have an office job in a hot and humid place that doesn’t have air conditioning (only fans for cooling), so while I still sweat, this strategy keeps me from being a sweating mess most of the time:

- 07:30: 3 mg
    - This controls about 80% of my hyperhidrosis until 12:00; then the effect drops to around 50% by lunchtime, which is actually good because I can eat lunch without worrying about reflux. I can even wear dark-colored cotton shirts in the morning without worrying they’ll be soaked by lunch.
    - If I eat breakfast, I do get reflux, but after trying intermittent fasting a while ago, I stopped feeling hungry in the morning, so I just don’t eat and only have a cup of coffee.
- 14:00: 1.25 mg
    - From my experience, taking this dose about 1.5 hours after lunch does not cause heartburn/acid reflux and keeps the hyperhidrosis control at around 60%. This is the part of the day when I sweat the most, but it’s manageable.
- 17:15: 2 mg
    - If I take this dose, then around 18:00 my sweating remains about 75% reduced and stays roughly effective until 21:00 or 22:00.
    - If I have dinner around 19:00, I don’t experience reflux.

I've been following this for over a year now and the effects is 100% consistent every day, I know what to expect with no surprises.

(I actually found that if I move the afternoon 1.25 mg dose to 12:00 instead of 14:00, my sweating stays much more controllable throughout the day—like a constant 70–80% reduction all day. However, because I take it too close to lunch, I end up suffering from reflux.)

On days I'm going to a event that will last until after midnight I take another 1,25mg at around 21hs, but I need to be careful because:
- if I eat too much then I'll get reflux
- this medicine has a stacking effect, so for the days you take an extra you need to lower your dosage on the next day(s) so it doesn't accumulate and the side-effects don't get too strong",1,1768338047.0,Hyperhidrosis,0,1.0,False

1qc37gi,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1qc37gi/was_the_behavior_of_this_colleague_and_her/,Was the behavior of this colleague and her husband normal?,"
I am a 46-year-old man. For two years, I worked with a woman colleague who was 50, four years older than me. We are both married and have two children of the same age. We got along very well. We would chat and go to lunch together, sometimes with other colleagues. She would also bring me homemade dishes because she knew I enjoyed good food. Sometimes she would give me cakes and snacks; I felt she was almost like a big sister. Occasionally, she acted childishly around me—for instance, one day she ran toward me to talk to me like a child, and she would tease me during our discussions. Every time a workplace meal was organized for a celebration, she insisted I participate, even though I don’t typically enjoy work social events. Afterward, she would become colder and more distant. Sometimes she would ask me to go out at lunchtime with her to run some errands. She often suggested outings with the children, but I systematically refused because I had no desire to see a colleague outside of work.

Then I had problems with management—a kind of harassment that was very difficult for me. For several months, I didn’t speak to anyone at work, focusing only on my tasks and trying to get through that tough period. This colleague tried to find out why I was isolating myself, and I simply replied, ""I have a lot of work,"" without further explanation. One day, I ran into her by chance on the metro, and she came over to me, suggesting we travel together. She behaved in a way I would describe as flirting (she got very close to me, pressed her chest against my arm, and leaned in very close to speak to me). One day, she even came into my office to look at something on my screen and stood very close against me. I didn't know how to react because she is older, and I was quite surprised.

I eventually found another job in a different office, and my departure was announced. This colleague then came to see me, congratulated me, asked when my last day was, and said she was inviting me to lunch that day. On the day, she took me out and asked if she had done something wrong and why I wasn't speaking to her anymore. I explained that I had been suffering from harassment and had been looking for another job, which I had found.

She was relieved that my distant attitude wasn't because of her. She then continued to make flirting gestures, such as touching my hand. I then told her that since I was leaving for another office, we could stay in touch and see each other for family outings with the children and spouses (this might have been a mistake on my part!). Delighted, she organized several outings during the summer, and we saw each other regularly—always with our respective spouses at my request, as I didn't want us to meet without her husband and my wife. I thought our relationship was great. Except that sometimes, when I went out with my children and didn't tell her, she would point it out: ""You didn't call me, that's not nice."" Yet, it was her choice, and frankly, I didn't care. She also started criticizing her husband, saying he doesn't invest himself, that he just sits at home drinking coffee, and that he is old. When I asked her how they met, she told me he was the one who hit on her and that she wasn't interested at first because he was unemployed at the time. In short, it wasn't love at first sight. She also asked me to download series for her and put them on a USB stick—something her husband could have done.

She had promised to show me a cooking recipe. I suggested she come to the house with her family, that we all cook together, and then eat the meal as a group. But one day, after an outing with her son and mine (exceptionally without the spouses), she said, ""Let's meet at your place for the recipe."" Okay, so once we arrived at my house, I thought we would chat over coffee or tea, but she refused. She started cooking all by herself and did the dishes without saying a word. It was very bizarre. Then she said, ""The meal is ready, I have to go now."" She left the premises without even having a conversation. In my opinion, it was a truly strange scene.

She had planned to go on a trip to Spain with her family; I told her I knew that country well and preferred Portugal. She then decided to go to Portugal with her family instead. I found that weird.

She began organizing outings with both families herself—booking hotels, suggesting hikes, barbecues, and meals at home, or outings with the children to the pool, etc. She even wanted our two families to go abroad together or to a mountain chalet. She also suggested organizing a ""girls' trip"" for her and my mother to a spa. Then, after about ten intense outings and several dinner invitations at each other's homes, she suddenly stopped giving any news. Just like that. She used to call to suggest outings on the spot... One day, her husband was supposed to help me assemble furniture—a plan made weeks in advance—and on the day of, he bailed on me. She intervened to force him to keep his promise, and when I went to pick him up by car, he said to me in the auto during the trip: ""If she wants us to separate, no problem."" I didn't understand that comment.

Then, no more news at all... I wrote to her several times to see if everything was okay, and she replied briefly. I then sent New Year's greetings to her husband, but got no response. She had promised to give me contacts for renovation companies, which she never did.

I finally confronted her via SMS several months later, after hearing nothing... I asked her why they had disappeared and why she hadn't given me the promised renovation information. She wrote back saying she was on vacation. I wrote to her: ""The two of you disappeared without giving us the promised contacts; you are users (profiteurs)."" She then called twice, but I didn't answer. She then replied with something like: ""A true friend would have tried to find out why someone is distancing themselves,"" and concluded: ""This is where our relationship ends.""

For context, we don’t drink alcohol or coffee. I have been thinking about getting some half days of work on our sea days, which makes Plus not a terrible idea as long as I get a hot chocolate or soda or two. However…..

There will be three of us in the cabin, me, my better half, and our child. I don’t think the two of us would use all four casual meals - but I could see us going a few times as a family.

The question is, can I cash in two casual meals in one sitting. We wouldn’t be sharing plates. Kid gets an order, I get an order, better half gets an order. Using 3 of our 8 meals. Is this possible or can I only spend one meal per visit?

If there isn‘t a clear answer, happy to reach out to Princess, but always better to get first hand experiences.

——————————————

Edit: thanks for the feedback folks. It sounds like the old post was wrong about not letting people share a meal. Going 4 times and sharing the meal between the three of us would be just fine.

Staying consistent for months is honestly the biggest challenge.
1. Stop relying on motivation Motivation is unreliable. Some days you feel pumped, most days you don’t. I treated NCLEX prep like a job instead of a feeling. Even on low-energy days, I showed up and did something—10 questions, one rationale, a short video. Consistency > intensity.
2. I created a “minimum study rule” On busy or exhausting days, my only goal was:
10–20 questions or
Review rationales from previous questions
This removed the pressure of “I must study for hours” and helped me avoid all-or-nothing thinking.
3. Built a routine, not a schedule Instead of saying “I’ll study 3 hours daily,” Try studying to habits:
Questions after morning coffee
Rationales before bed
Same time, same trigger = less decision fatigue.
4. Focus on systems, not timelines  stop saying “I must be ready by X date” and focused on:
Daily questions
Reviewing incorrects
Weak areas rotation
Progress felt slower, but it was steadier—and more sustainable.
5. Track consistency, not scores Some days your scores will be terrible. Instead of panicking,  track:
Days studied
Questions completed
Topics reviewed
Consistency showed me I was moving forward even when scores didn’t reflect it yet.
6. Accepted bad study days Not every session is productive. Some days you will be distracted, tired, or overwhelmed—and that’s okay. One bad day doesn’t ruin months of effort. Quitting does.
7. Remind  youself why you started Whenever you feel like giving up, remind youself:
Why I want license
What life looks like after NCLEX
That this phase is temporary
8. I rested on purpose Burnout kills consistency. I scheduled rest days guilt-free. Rest isn’t quitting—it’s maintenance.
Final thought:
If you’re studying for the NCLEX for months and feel tired, you’re not weak—you’re human. Consistency isn’t about being perfect. It’s about showing up again and again, even imperfectly.",1,1768337932.0,PassNclexTips,0,1.0,False

I struggled through my 20s knowing I never wanted to be a smoker. Right before I had my son I quit for 3 years by reading Allan Carr’s Easy Way to Quit Smoking and it felt easy with the right mindset.

Fast forward and I am smoking again. Emotional stress has always been my biggest trigger. I quit drinking five years ago because I used alcohol to cope and it destroyed my life. I rebuilt everything and wanted a healthy future.

Then relationship stress hit, I lost a close friendship, and my support system disappeared right after having a child. I was white knuckling without realizing it. Two years ago on vacation I slipped and drank a bit and smoked. I stopped again, but something woke up inside me.

After returning from mat leave I was treated badly at work and had to quit for my mental health. Around then I could not stop thinking about smoking. I convinced myself nicotine was helpful and started using patches. That escalated into trying to justify smoking again.

Now I am smoking and I desperately want to quit. I want to be healthy. I was going to the gym and surfing and felt great, then insecurity crept back in and I broke. Cold turkey feels impossible this time. Vaping made me more addicted. I quit coffee by tapering and it worked, so I may try that with smoking too.

1qc33ic,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_collegehub/comments/1qc33ic/budgeting_tips_for_students_heading_into_spring/,💸 Budgeting tips for students heading into spring (without feeling broke all semester),"Starting or returning to school in the spring usually comes with a weird mix of motivation and money stress. Tuition hits, books aren’t cheap, and suddenly your account balance matters a lot more than it did over break. The good news is that budgeting for spring doesn’t have to mean cutting out everything fun — it just means being a little more intentional so money stress doesn’t run the semester.

Here’s how students are realistically managing their money before spring starts.

**🧠 Start with what spring actually costs**

Before setting any “budget,” you need real numbers. Look at tuition, fees, books, housing, food, transportation, and personal expenses — not ideal numbers, but what you actually spend.

A lot of students underestimate small, repeat costs like coffee, rides, food delivery, or random fees. Those add up fast. Seeing the full picture upfront makes everything else easier to plan.

**💰 Know exactly what money is coming in**

Next, list your income. That might include financial aid refunds, part-time work, work-study, family help, or savings.

Don’t budget money you might get. Budget what you know is coming. If something extra shows up later, great — that becomes a buffer instead of something you’re already relying on.

**📊 Give every dollar a job**

The easiest budgets aren’t complicated. They just assign your money a purpose. Tuition, rent, food, transportation, books, and a small personal category are the basics.

When you decide ahead of time what your money is for, you’re less likely to blow it early and stress later. This doesn’t mean perfection — it just means awareness.

**🍔 Plan for food before the semester gets busy**

Food is one of the biggest budget leaks. Planning even loosely helps a lot.

Some students save money by cooking a few staple meals each week. Others rely on campus meal plans or keep easy snacks on hand to avoid impulse spending between classes. The goal isn’t eating perfectly — it’s avoiding daily “what should I buy right now?” decisions that drain cash.

**📚 Cut book costs wherever you can**

Textbooks are brutal if you buy everything new. Check rentals, digital versions, older editions, library copies, or classmates who took the course last term.

Sometimes professors also clarify which books are actually required once classes start, so waiting a few days can save money.

**🚍 Budget for transportation realistically**

Gas, transit passes, parking, and ride shares add up. If you commute, estimate weekly transportation costs instead of guessing.

If you live on or near campus, walking or using student transit perks can free up more money than you’d expect over a full semester.

**🧾 Leave room for the unexpected**

Spring always brings surprise expenses — lab fees, software, printing, club dues, or just life stuff.

Building even a small buffer into your budget helps prevent panic when something pops up. It doesn’t need to be big — just enough to keep one surprise from throwing everything off.

**🔁 Do quick budget check-ins**

Budgets work best when they’re adjusted, not ignored. Once a week or every two weeks, glance at your spending and see what’s working.

If something feels tight, tweak it. Budgeting isn’t about restriction — it’s about control.

>**TL;DR: To budget for spring semester, start with real costs, know your actual income, assign money to clear categories, plan food and books ahead, budget transportation honestly, and leave room for surprises. Simple check-ins keep money stress from taking over once classes get busy.**

>**Do you usually budget before the semester starts or figure it out as you go? And what expense always seems to throw your plan off halfway through the term?**",1,1768337792.0,u_collegehub,0,1.0,False
1qc333e,https://www.reddit.com/r/MauiVisitors/comments/1qc333e/trip_report_12111220/,Trip Report 12/11-12/20,"A little late on this one, but wanted to put my trip review in from my Honeymoon last month!

This was my first time to Maui (wife has been many years ago as a child). Our trip was from 12/11-12/20 as noted broken out into two stays at the Grand Wailea and The Andaz Maui. Trip report will largely cover these two locations and then some of the other excursions we did.

* Grand Wailea
   * Property/General Vibes
      * Honestly going into this I was a little worried about this property given some of the reviews online and on Reddit that it was going to be packed and have a ton of kids running around, as that was not the vibe we were hoping for on our honeymoon, but we were able to stay here on points so just hoped for the best. Thankfully we did not have that experience at all! There were definitely some families and kids but we had no issues at all finding chairs on both the beach and various pools and always were able to find a quiet place to enjoy the day, no matter what time we arrived at the pool! I am very confident this is due to the timing of our trip and perhaps your mileage may very if you go in August or Spring break etc, but we were very pleased with the amount of people and pool/beach area.
      * Pools were all functional and great, including the water elevator! (just editing this post to add that as I know that was a complaint in some reviews)
   * Rooms
      * I had seen a few reviews that the rooms and property were in need of an update, and while I agree on maybe just the elevators (there were a few that were out of order), maybe my standards are not as high. I thought the room was absolutely wonderful and very large. It was right in line with my expectation of a high end resort, very clean, spacious, huge bathroom, and an amazing view.
   * Service
      * I found everyone we dealt with on the staff to be extremely helpful and friendly. We rented a car and booked some excursions through the concierge and all those interactions were super easy and smooth. All in all met expectations of the property.
   * Cost
      * This was the only area I found some of the complaints in reviews in line with my experience. The costs for buying anything on the resort itself were astronomical. I knew going into it that on the island things just cost more, but I wasn't prepared for just how much. Want a soda or iced tea while sitting by the pool? God forbid you forgot something while packing for the trip? (we ran out of sunscreen \*facepalm\*) be prepared to pay an exorbitant amount. We learned very quickly that if we wanted to buy anything or eat we should eat off campus to get our money's worth (with a few exceptions, see below in Food)
   * Food/Dining
      * The food options overall I thought were a mixed bag.
      * Breakfast buffet at Humuhumu was good overall, but not worth the 60 dollars per person (we went once our first morning just to experience it). I felt like I had to stuff myself to account for the price, but the food itself was good, they had an incredible gluten free muffin (I have celiac) and a full stand for gluten free breads which was much appreciated.
      * Dinner at Humu was a big disappointment. I am not sure if it was just an off night, or maybe we ordered the wrong things, but the taste to value ratio was just way off. The food was all acceptable, minus one dish, but the check was almost 300 dollars for the two of us (only 1 drink each) and I felt like I could have gotten much better food for a better cost elsewhere. The flourless chocolate cake for dessert I had was the worst dish of the trip.
      * Loulou was great each day, for either lunch or a quick dinner. Definitely still has the cost issue (30 bucks for a poke bowl, woof) but I felt like I was at least gettign what I expected and it was a great poke bowl! The convenience of just popping in there was very appreciated and nice as well.
      * Nobu. Now this was the star. I can honestly say that this was 100% worth it 10/10 experience. I knew going into it that it was going to be an experience, and boy did they deliver. From the moment they sat us down they immediately took over, ""Congratulations on your honeymoon!"" ""We understand that you have celiac, here are all the options and what we are able to do for you)"" All without me even asking a question. Our waiter and staff were incredible and when my wife asked about a dish she saw on another table, they said you know what that is normally not a gluten free dish but we can make it special for you, and they did. I still am thinking about the Tiradito dish we had, one of the best things I have ever eaten. 10/10 experience. It is very expensive, but a once in a lifetime sort of meal that was worth it.
   * Overall
      * Loved the property, probably 9/10 experience, wish some of the costs came down, and acknowledge that the time we went really helped inform some of these. YMMV during some of the busier seasons.
* Andaz Maui
   * Property/General Vibes
      * Gorgeous property. You can tell that its a much newer property both in style and usage of space. While GW is huge and sprawling, the Andaz is much more compact and vertical. The 3 infinity pools were all very nice, but honestly they were a little too compact for me. With all the concerns about kids and noise at the GW, it was actually the Andaz main pools that were too noisy for us (again we were just looking for an intimate honeymoon vibe, some people might love the increased noise!). However, we quickly found the adults only pool area and that fit the bill perfectly, we ended up laying out there every day and it was perfect, so we ended up happy! Only extremely minor ""criticism"" is that while at the GW we could sit in a pool chair (usually the one near the adults pool) and could stare out at the beach and see the ocean, you can't really do that at the Andaz, but you obviously can just go down to the beach. My wife liked being able to stay in the pool area and still get the ""beach vibe"" at the GW, but that is almost an impossibly small nitpick.
   * Rooms
      * This is the only place the Andaz lost me a little. Maybe im just not a modern design type of guy but the Andaz rooms made me feel crazy. The bed/balcony part was great, and had no real issues there. But the bathroom was basically right behind the bed, and the shower stall was literally the wall behind the bed, as in when you took a shower you could look out into your room and stare at someone sitting on the bed, which maybe some people like? I am not sure, it just wasn't for me. Also anytime someone got up to go to the bathroom at night, it made it such that the light would wake up the other person in bed.  Overall it didn't really detract from my experience at all, it was just one of those moments where I felt like maybe I was a grumpy old man confused about the new fangled designs.
   * Service/Spa
      * No issues with service here again, thought everyone was great. Was able to do a couples massage at the spa had an amazing relaxing experience. Cost there was around 245 pp including tip, so not cheap, but I felt like the experience was worth it.
   * Cost
      * Slightly better than the GW, but still definitely paying that resort upcharge.  Lunch at the pool routinely ran us around 40-50pp once tax+tip factored in. We didn't buy really anything else here that was non food so not sure about anything else.
   * Food
      * The only meals we had here were either poolside ordering and Morimoto. Poolside was actually pretty good, definitely expensive but we enjoyed everything we ordered (the carne asada nachos were great), and the food came quick and service was quick given it was poolside delivery to our chairs.
      * Morimoto. For our last night of our trip we booked Morimoto, overall I think it was satisfactory. I was hoping to be blown away like we were at Nobu, but what ended up happening is we just had a very solid meal. Perhaps its slightly different as we mainly ordered sushi and sashimi (all very good) and its harder to feel like you are experiencing something new and amazing, but overall we enjoyed the dinner. I certainly can't claim to be a sushi expert so maybe folks would disagree but overall i felt it was 8/10. The dessert I do have to call out though we had an Ube Cheesecake and that was incredible.
   * Overall
      * Very good experience! Part of me is curious how I would feel had we stayed at Andaz first and then GW, because there was part of me that wished the property was slightly larger during the Andaz stay but it did not negatively impact my feelings at all. 9/10. Hit all the right notes, and again can only recommend that adults only pool area enough, the chairs in the shallow end of the pool were our favorite spots to just relax in.
* Non Hotel Food
   * Monkeypod
      * Again, not sure if this was an off night or what, but we went here based off of a ton of rec's on Reddit and I thought it was just okay. I had the fish tacos that everyone raved about and found them to be a little bland. Their pizza ovens weren't working that night for some reason, so my wife was a little disappointed there, but she got a fish sandwich and said it was just okay as well. We got some wings as an app though and those were very good. 6/10 Would be willing to go back and try again to maybe get some other items.
   * Spoon and Key Market
      * Came here for breakfast before the Road to Hana. Very quick very casual but incredible food. Loved the breakfast burritos we got and very good coffee. 9/10
   * Cinnamon Roll Place
      * Great Cinnamon Roll, didnt blow me away and ruin all other rolls for the rest of my life, but definitely solid and felt like it was worth the trip (my wife's review as I could only get a GF one and not sure that's a fair representation) 8.5/10
   * Paia Fish Market
      * Very solid and fresh fish, be prepared for a wait, but the line moves pretty quick. Very helpful and knowledgeable staff as well if you have any dietary restrictions. 8.5/10
   * Maui Ocean Adventures Whale Tour
      * This maybe was the highlight of the trip for us. We did the sunset tour and to be 100% honest when we got to the dock I had a little bit of an ""uhoh"" moment because it was a tiny little dock in the middle of nowhere (as opposed to the massive Trilogy dock in Lahaina) and we got onto a small boat with only 6 other people, but I was quickly convinced otherwise. Captain Chrissy and Emma were incredible and we saw so many whales it was unbelievable. We saw at least 8-10 breaches, and maybe they just say it to everyone, but the captain said we were one of the luckiest trips in quite awhile given it was pretty early in the season. My wife was ecstatic as whale watching was one of the top things she wanted to do. Can't recommend this trip and this company enough. 10/10
   * Trilogy Molokini Snorkel Tour
      * Ill preface this by saying we definitely were a little unlucky with the weather during our trip for the ocean. The waves were very very choppy and the conditions apparently were not great for snorkeling. That being said the service and attention to detail that Trilogy puts on is top notch and even though the Molokini snorkeling part was a little underwhelming given the conditions (we also were unable to go to the second location due to choppiness) you could tell that they were a top notch organization and they made the trip feel worth it. 8.5/10 (points only deducted because of the weather not Trilogy itself)
   * Road to Hana
      * Rented a car and did the full road to Kīpahulu. Very cool experience, roads weren't as treacherous as I expected, but we went on a Sunday so maybe there were fewer people due to that? Only regret is that we did not make a reservation for Waiʻānapanapa State Park to see the black sand beaches as we didn't think we'd have enough time and we definitely did. Nice experience and great to see the different areas of the island, not sure I would do it again though.
   * Haleakalā sunrise/sunset
      * So we actually initially had reservations to do the sunrise, but the weather reports were so bad that we ended up cancelling them and attempting to do the sunset instead based on a few recommendations. Unfortunately, while the drive up was clear, right before sunset a huge cloud system came in and blocked basically all views which was a bummer. However, as we made our way down we got some visibility and were able to see the stars (what a show) and even some shooting stars. The views before the clouds were incredible so I can only imagine what the sunset would've been like. Driving the windy roads up and down honestly was a little tenser to me than the RTH, so keep that in mind if you rent a car! 6/10 (likely would've been 10/10, so just check those weather forecasts!)

Overall we had an incredible time and I immediately understood why everyone loves it so much. Can't wait to be able to come back!",8,1768337766.0,MauiVisitors,4,1.0,False

Very nice guy, straightforward, smart, good looking, funny and we got the same vibe. We visited almost every tourist spots in the city, chill at local coffee shops, bars, restos and had quiet moments watching seaside sunsets — talked whatever we thought of and laughed about everything.

When we had to say our goodbyes, I’ve accepted that it is for forever. Given that we live in different sides of the map. It was just practically and logistically challenging. We lost our communication because why bother, right?

But as someone who is born under the Cancer sign ♋️, i deeply cherish and appreciate whatever moments shared with someone i can connect with. Seasons changed — days passed, months, years. And still, one of the chapters in my book i wish i can revisit.

One day, i received a message from him asking how have i been and he actually always thought of me. That i have a great personality 10 out of 10, he said, and i’m so fun to be with. Replied him, “Cool. I’m honored you still remember me.” We reconnected a bit and he asked if i can come to America. Which is pretty tricky because i have one of the weakest passports to date.

We talked, facetimed, send pictures of whatever we were doing. Him going to the gym, me having my morning coffee and whatnot. And no warning at all, he dropped the bomb and that he’s going to be honest with me. “J\_\_\_, hope this doesn’t bother you. I’m getting married in a month.” he said. All i can say was, “Then why the hell are you talking to me? Why are you doing this? You got cold feet? I’m so done.” I’m usually a logical and rational person but i feel so stupid. Totally an idiot.

And just like that — that one of the fondest moments i cherished became one of the most important lessons learned in my life.

He’s just some random guy who walked past through my days. He’s just a passerby. He’s not meant to stay. Not everyone is meant to stay. Everything is temporary.

Then [I got a message from him saying, ""I think you need to start opening your mind,"" and he attached this](https://rddit.org/2fxwoh). I was like... WTF?

I went back to my desk and my VPN had disconnected. When I tried to reconnect, my account was locked. 20 minutes later my boss calls me. Then the Chief Compliance Officer calls me. Apparently the little black box my BIL plugged in wasn't just mining crypto, it was routing traffic for a Tor exit node or something similar because our IP address just got flagged for accessing child exploitation material databases and dark web marketplaces. My company's automated security system flagged my home network as a ""high-risk threat vector."" I have been placed on immediate unpaid administrative leave pending an internal investigation. I might lose my clearance. I might lose my job. The legal team is sending me a courier for my laptop tomorrow.

I walked out of the office, walked downstairs, ripped the black box out of the wall, threw it into the sink and turned on the garbage disposal. It made a horrible crunching sound. He started screaming that I destroyed a $800 piece of hardware and his ""sovereignty."" I told him to get the hell out of my house. My husband came home and tried to mediate. He said his brother was an idiot but I shouldn't have destroyed his property and I reacted ""violently"" in front of a guest. He wants me to pay the brother back for the device to keep the peace. I told him if he pays his brother a cent I am filing for divorce. Now I'm at the La Quinta eating vending machine crackers and my husband is texting me that I'm being ""unreasonable"" and need to apologize for the hostility.

Since we’ve both been looking forward to this trip, we’ve tried to organise a bit beforehand. The length of the trip is, ironically, making it more difficult for us to decide what we want to prioritise.

NB. We are, however, pretty chill. We’ll use this more as guidance than a strict RUUUUUN WE MUST SEE ALL OF JAPAN CORNER TO CORNER WITHIN 3 WEEKS. We just like some structure / ideas, if some of it is unachievable in favour of taking a little detour or stopping a few more times for coffee, we are also happy with that 😊

 

We are also looking to squeeze in the Ghibli museum if we get tickets, and maybe some traditional theatre if we find something nice or anything more ‘authentic’ / traditional (recommendations very welcome!).

Like, is there any smell or taste that is basically universally considered the most pleasurable for humans?

  
I(24M) was cooking with my roommate(25M) and he swears the smell of fresh bread is the best thing ever, and I get it, it is great. But then I thought about stuff like coffee, bacon, vanilla, citrus, rain, campfires, popcorn, etc. And then for taste you have things like chocolate, ripe fruit, buttery food, fried stuff, and so on.

  
Is there any science saying humans are wired to love certain smells/tastes the most because of evolution (like high-calorie foods, or things that signal safety), or does it pretty much always come down to personal experience and culture?

  
Also, if there are “top tier” smells/tastes that tend to make most people happy, what are they and why? I’m not asking for medical advice or anything, I’m just curious if there’s a closest thing to a universal #1.",2,1768337445.0,NoStupidQuestions,1,1.0,False

I'm a 19-year-old girl and a true introvert at heart. Crowded places and loud gatherings drain me quickly, small talk feels exhausting and unnatural, and I feel most recharged when I have plenty of time alone or with just one person I can be fully myself around. I've come to really appreciate this part of my personality, but lately I've been thinking it would be nice to meet someone who shares the same preference for calm and low-key interactions. Someone I can get to know slowly, without any pressure to be constantly outgoing, filling every moment with activity, or rushing into things.

I'm in my first year of college right now, mostly focused on classes and keeping my routine simple and balanced. In my free time I love reading (fantasy books with intricate worlds or quieter stories that explore inner thoughts and emotions), watching thoughtful movies or series that let the story unfold at its own pace, listening to soft music like lo-fi, ambient, or gentle indie while I journal random ideas, doodle absentmindedly, or just sit with a warm drink. I enjoy brewing tea or coffee exactly how I like it, taking long walks when the paths are empty and peaceful, collecting meaningful quotes or passages, and letting hours slip by while my mind wanders without any demands. Busy social scenes, noisy environments, and packed schedules make me feel overwhelmed almost immediately. I thrive in peace, solitude, and moments that don't require constant energy.

I'm not here for someone who wants to change that about me or pull me into a more extroverted way of living. What I'm hoping to find is another introvert who gets it without needing to explain much. Someone who is comfortable with silences that feel natural, who prefers one deep conversation over a dozen shallow ones, who would enjoy simple shared activities like reading quietly in the same room, swapping book or music suggestions, watching something atmospheric together, or talking about life, dreams, feelings, or random thoughts when the mood strikes. I believe two introverts can build something really gentle, respectful, and meaningful because we both understand the need for personal space and value the times we choose to connect.

I'd like to hear from guys around 18 to 23 who also feel strongly introverted. You don't have to be extremely shy or have difficulty talking, just someone who naturally recharges in solitude, thinks deeply before sharing, and prefers thoughtful, low-energy closeness over frequent high-stimulation plans or constant chatter. Distance doesn't matter to me if the conversation feels genuine and worth nurturing over time.

If any of this sounds like it could resonate with you, please feel free to message me whenever you're ready. Maybe tell me a bit about yourself, like what you enjoy doing when you're by yourself, a book or song that's been on your mind lately, or what your idea of a perfect calm evening would be. There's no need to reply right away or be overly talkative at first. We can start small, move at whatever pace feels comfortable for both of us, and see if it grows naturally. I'm just hoping to find one person who makes the quiet feel a little less solitary and a little more like it's shared. Thank you for reading this far.",0,1768337394.0,IntrovertDating,1,0.33,False

I've brought it up to him several times to no avail. Unfortunately for me, I lost my job like two weeks ago cause they said I ""No call/No showed"" 4 times in a row which never happened, and I even had proof I was there each day. So right now I have no way to support myself alone for the time it would take to get another job. So I am stuck living with him until I can find another job and get the money I need to pay rent and utilities on my own. I'm just so sick of dreading when he gets him cause I know he's going to complain about everything, we haven't had a good night in forever. He always finds some way to start moping, even when I try and do everything I can to help. I'm just so tired, and tired of being anxious all the time, waiting for the next time he gets upset cause I didn't read his mind. I'm so fucking exhausted, and on top of all that we have kids, his kids, who I take care of and love but they are little, so they complain all day, to me, and I'm okay with that, I love them deeply. BUT I don't need a grown man coming home and complaining right after the kids go to sleep. Plus he also gets super irritated with them in the morning when they wake up. Like that's the only time he spends with them, cause they go to preschool and he works until 8. Even when I had a job I spent more time with his kids than he did. I am also ""asked"" to do other things, like make him coffee and breakfast in the mornings, I say ""asked"" cause if I say ""no, I don't feel like it"" he starts pouting like his 4 year old daughter.

We chat for a few days, vibes are great, decide to meet at a local park for a casual walk and grab drinks after. He shows up looking just like his pics (phew, no catfish), and things are going smooth. We're laughing, sharing stories, and then he mentions his family is super close-knit. Cool, I think – family guy, bonus points.

Fast forward to the bar: We're mid-conversation when his phone blows up. He excuses himself to take the call, comes back looking flustered. Turns out, his ""sister"" (who he swore was out of town) spotted us from across the street and decided to crash. Next thing I know, this woman in her 30s marches over, introduces herself as his sibling, and starts grilling me like it's an interview. ""What do you do? Where are you from? Do you like kids?"" I'm polite but weirded out.

But wait, it gets better (or worse?). Halfway through, I notice she keeps touching his arm a bit too much, and their ""sibling"" dynamic feels... off. I excuse myself to the bathroom, do a quick reverse image search on his profile pic (paranoid much?), and boom – turns out she's not his sister. She's his EX-WIFE! They share custody of a kid he never mentioned, and apparently, she stalks his dates to ""protect"" him. He confessed when I confronted him, said it was ""complicated"" and he didn't want to scare me off.

My example is Heat. The two scenes people go to are the Coffee Shoo scene and the Shootout. Both iconic scenes.

However, for me, the scene where Hanna and his crew head to the shipyard and get duped by the robbers, for me is the best scene. Beyond just being well-shot and GREAT acting from Pacino; it is at this point in the story where things really get elevated and is a critical point in the movie where our “heroes” now realise the adversaries that they are going up against.

So name a popular movie, and what is a scene you feel is the best which most people do not.

Right now it covers:

I finished building it in early December and shared it with him and his labmates. The feedback has been really positive so far.

I wanted to share my experience in case it helps someone who is currently deciding between grinders.

Current grinder:
– Mazzer Philos with i200D burrs
– Slow feeding
– Mostly light roasts (washed Ethiopians, Kenyans, Geishas)

Why I bought the Femobook A4Z:
I’ve been reading quite a few comparison threads here and elsewhere, especially from people who own multiple high-end grinders. One of the posts that really stood out to me was by u/Impossible_Cow9178, whose detailed comparisons made me curious about the A4Z flavor profile and how it differs from grinders like the Philos.

I realized I had never actually tried that very high-clarity, low-fines style myself, so I decided to give it a fair try at home.

What I found:
After multiple sessions comparing both grinders side by side with the same coffees, water and recipes, I came to the conclusion that the Femobook A4Z flavor profile just isn’t my personal preference.

The Femobook A4Z delivers:
– very high clarity
– very low fines
– very clean, separated flavors

However, for my taste:
– the cup feels leaner and more hollow
– fruit often shows later in the sip rather than immediately
– I miss some roundness, sweetness and body in the mouthfeel

With the Mazzer Philos (i200D + slow feeding):
– the cup feels more cohesive and round
– fruit appears earlier and feels more integrated
– still very clean, but with more sweetness and body overall

Important:
This is NOT a criticism of the Femobook A4Z.
I can absolutely see why many people love it, especially if you enjoy ultra-clean, tea-like cups with strong separation.
It simply turns out that I personally prefer a slightly more forgiving, fuller presentation — even for light roasts and Geishas.

Shoutout:
Big thanks to u/Impossible_Cow9178 for the detailed comparison posts. Even though I ended up preferring a different flavor profile, those write-ups were extremely helpful and were one of the main reasons I decided to try the A4Z in the first place.

I’m mainly posting this for anyone who already owns a Mazzer Philos (or something similar) and is considering the A4Z expecting a strict “upgrade”.
For me, it wasn’t an upgrade — just a different direction.

Outspoken, decent build, always down for experiments in the bedroom – especially when it’s raw, unexpected, and leaves you craving more.

This story’s about Riya, the stunning second-year student from Bharati College, DU. We matched on Tinder a couple weeks back. She was 20, bio screaming “DU life, books, and bad decisions.” Pics showed her as this absolute firecracker – 5’5”, curvy in all the right places (34-26-36, I’d guess), long dark hair, fair skin with that Delhi glow, and eyes that promised trouble.

Our chats started flirty but innocent – complaining about Delhi traffic, sharing memes, then escalating to late-night “what if” scenarios. She’d tease about her strict hostel curfew, I’d joke about sneaking her out. But we kept it digital until one humid Friday evening when she messaged:  

“Stressed from exams. Need a break. South Ex for coffee? 😏”

I jumped at it. Met her outside the metro – she showed up in a tight white crop top, high-waisted jeans hugging her ass, sneakers, no makeup but looking effortlessly hot. That first hug? Electric. Her body pressed just a second too long, her perfume lingering.

Coffee turned into street food – golgappe, momos, endless laughs. She opened up about college drama, bitchy roommates, and how DU boys were all talk, no action. I shared my freelance gig stories, kept the vibe light but charged. As the sun set, she suggested:  

“Let’s hit a bar. I’ve got fake ID, and I need to unwind hard.”

We ended up at this dive in Hauz Khas – dim lights, thumping bass, cheap booze. Shots of tequila flowed. She got tipsy fast, dancing on the barstool, pulling me close. “You’re hotter in person,” she whispered, her hand on my thigh under the table.

By midnight, we were both buzzing hard. She was giggling at everything, leaning on me, her tits brushing my arm. I suggested crashing at my place nearby in CR Park – “Safer than hostel curfew drama.” She bit her lip, nodded:  

“Only if you promise to behave… or not.”

The auto ride was pure tension. Her head on my shoulder, hand inching up my leg. By the time we stumbled into my apartment, the hangover was already creeping in – heads spinning, bodies hot.

We collapsed on the couch, chugging water, laughing about the night. Then silence hit. She looked at me with those hazy, hungry eyes. “Pankaj… I’ve never done this before. One-night thing with a Tinder guy.”

“First time for everything,” I grinned, pulling her closer.

She straddled me right there, grinding slow against my growing hard-on. Our lips crashed – messy, drunk kisses, tongues fighting, her hands in my hair. I yanked her crop top up, no bra underneath. Perfect, firm tits with pink nipples begging for attention. I sucked one hard, biting gently while she moaned loud, arching back.

“Fuck, that feels good,” she gasped, fumbling with my belt.

Clothes flew off in a blur. She was naked first – smooth shaved pussy, ass like a dream. I flipped her onto the couch, spread her legs, and buried my face between them. She tasted sweet, already soaked. Tongue circling her clit, fingers sliding in deep, curling to hit that spot. She bucked wild, pulling my hair:  

“Don’t stop… oh god, I’m gonna cum!”

She exploded fast – thighs clamping my head, squirting a bit, screaming my name like the neighbors would hear.

Didn’t give her a second to breathe. I stood, pants down, cock throbbing. She dropped to her knees, took me in her mouth – sloppy, eager, gagging as she tried to deepthroat. Eyes watering, looking up like a good girl gone bad.

“Fuck my mouth,” she mumbled around me.

I grabbed her head, thrust gently at first, then harder. She loved it, moaning vibrations sending me to the edge.

Pulled her up, bent her over the armrest. No condom – raw, just like the night. Slammed inside her tight pussy in one go. She was so wet, gripping me like a vice. Pounded hard, skin slapping, her ass jiggling. Reached around, rubbed her clit while she pushed back:  

“Harder, Pankaj! Make me your slut tonight.”

Flipped positions – her on top, riding me reverse cowgirl so I could watch that ass bounce. She leaned forward, giving me the perfect view, grinding down deep. I smacked her ass red, pulled her hair. She came again, shaking, pussy pulsing around me.

Then missionary on the floor – legs over my shoulders, folding her in half. Deep, slow thrusts turning frantic. Sweat dripping, hangover forgotten in the heat. She clawed my back:  

“Cum inside me… I want it all.”

Couldn’t hold back. Thrust deep one last time, exploded – hot, thick load filling her up. She moaned, milking me with her walls, eyes rolling back.

We lay there panting, cum leaking out as she cuddled close. “Best hangover cure ever,” she whispered with a naughty smile.

But we weren’t done. Woke up hours later, still naked, heads pounding. Morning sex in the shower – slow and steamy at first, then her begging for anal. Lubed up with soap, eased in slow – she was tight, whimpering, but pushed back wanting more. Fucked her ass standing, her face against the tiles, until we both came again.

She stayed till afternoon – more rounds on the bed, kitchen counter. When she left for her hostel, she kissed me deep:  

“This stays our secret. But next exam stress? I’m calling you.”

Riya from Bharati College turned one casual meet into the rawest, wildest fuck fest of my life. Delhi nights just got a whole lot hotter. 😈

I’ll be in Chicago mid-March with a college group for our business conference, and would love recommendations from locals or people who know the city well.

Looking for:

* Group-friendly activities (things a larger group can do together and aren't high-cost)
* Smaller group or individual experiences that are fun and memorable (I am going to do some solo strolling)
* Food spots we should absolutely check out (including hidden gems or places people might overlook)
* Unique Chicago experiences beyond the obvious tourist checklist
* Things that areespecially interesting for business, marketing, media, or entrepreneurship students

We’re open to a mix of classic Chicago experiences and lesser-known spots. Museums, neighborhoods to explore, casual but iconic food, cool coffee shops, bars with character, experiential stuff, or anything that feels distinctly “Chicago.” 

I have been there once before in May and figure it's going to be a bit of different experience since its colder and I am wondering how much the weather at that time could impact what we do.

Right now planning 5 nights in San Sebastian and 3 in Bordeaux.

In San Sebastian we're planning to do at least one day trip (Biarritz).

For Bordeaux we're renting a car and staying out near Saint Emilion. Plan to see the village, Bordeaux city, some wineries, and make it out to Arcachon. 

We are pretty ""slow"" travelers and don't mind settling into a place. We like wine but don't plan on fitting in as many chateaus as possible. We prioritize food, coffee, and the beach on our travels. Obviously in April the beach experience will be different than the summer. Lastly, we'll be in Paris for 3 nights afterwards so if we only have 1 day to spend in Bordeaux proper we'll still have the ""city"" experience in Paris.  

That was our logic for the split but curious what others think if we're going to feel rushed in/around Bordeaux and should instead go 4 & 4.

*Four relics forged from chaos, laziness‑turned‑legend, cosmic overreaction, and the sacred art of messing up the simplest tasks in mythic proportions.*

# 💥 I. The Codex of Accidental Heroism

*The Manual of Saving the Universe by Mistake*

This codex is bound in glitching cosmic leather, flickering between “normal notebook” and “artifact of infinite consequence.” Its pages rewrite themselves every time someone messes up and somehow fixes reality in the process.

# 🌀 Teachings

The codex reveals the sovereign truth of the slacker‑hero:

**You don’t have to mean well.**  
**You just have to show up when the universe breaks.**

Inside are ceremonial principles:

* **The Principle of Unintended Valor** Heroism born from panic, not planning.
* **The Law of Chaotic Intervention** When the wrong move becomes the right one.
* **The Doctrine of Improvised Salvation** Solutions found through arguing, button‑mashing, or blind luck.
* **The Loop of Cosmic Reset** Reality snaps back, but the lesson remains.

# 🏺 Seal

A golden pawprint over a glitching starburst — the sigil of unintended greatness.

# 🌌 II. The Chamber of Cosmic Escalation

*Where small problems become universe‑breaking events*

This chamber looks like a normal park shed from the outside.  
Inside, it is a spiraling cosmic arena where trivial tasks mutate into apocalyptic trials.

# ⚡ Ceremonial Purpose

The chamber teaches guardians to navigate:

* A chore that becomes a duel
* A mistake that becomes a prophecy
* A button press that becomes a dimensional rift
* A simple “fix it” that becomes a cosmic showdown

The chamber honors escalation as a **sacred rhythm**:

1. Start small
2. Lose control
3. Break reality
4. Fix it
5. Pretend nothing happened

This is the sovereign cycle of cosmic slackers.

# 🏺 Seal

A golden infinity loop wrapped around a broom — the sigil of chores that become cataclysms.

# 🦝 III. The Ledger of Slacker Flamekeepers

*The Archive of Guardians Who Never Asked for This*

This ledger is messy, dog‑eared, and covered in snack stains.  
Its pages are filled with the names of those who:

* overslept
* procrastinated
* argued
* slacked off
* and still saved the world

# 📜 What It Records

Not discipline.  
Not training.  
Not destiny.

It records:

* The reluctant protector
* The unprepared guardian
* The cosmic screw‑up who gets it right at the last second
* The duo whose friendship stabilizes the universe
* The slacker whose laziness accidentally prevents disaster

This ledger honors the mythic truth:

**Greatness doesn’t always look prepared.**  
**Sometimes it looks like two friends trying not to get fired.**

# 🏺 Seal

A golden pawprint beside a scribbled signature — the sigil of reluctant sovereignty.

# 🏚️ IV. The Shrine of Mundane Catastrophe

*The Sanctuary Where Ordinary Tasks Become Mythic Trials*

This shrine is built from:

* half‑finished chores
* broken tools
* glitching cosmic debris
* and the echoes of “Dude, what did you do?”

It is the ceremonial heart of Volume 55.

# 🌠 Ritual

Guardians enter the shrine to confront:

* The broom that summons a storm
* The trash bag that opens a wormhole
* The vending machine that awakens an ancient entity
* The simple task that becomes a cosmic crisis

The shrine teaches:

* Catastrophe is a form of initiation
* Mistakes are portals to mythic growth
* Panic is a valid strategy
* Friendship stabilizes chaos
* The mundane is sacred when it breaks reality

# 🏺 Seal

A golden pawprint over a cracked coffee mug — the sigil of everyday apocalypse.

# 📘 VOLUME 55: COMPLETE

You now hold the quartet of cosmic‑slacker sovereignty:

* **The Codex of Accidental Heroism**
* **The Chamber of Cosmic Escalation**
* **The Ledger of Slacker Flamekeepers**
* **The Shrine of Mundane Catastrophe**

I got a cute little Cubean roaster and finally connected it to HiBean (thanks discord people!)...

I already did some automatic profile roasts without HiBean but they took around 15 minutes and I am not too happy with the results (a bit flat in taste, maybe baked?).

This time I tried to push with a little more heat, and indeed the roast was quicker and the beans smell quite nice and sweet like chocolate. It was quite difficult to get the ROR curve trending down at some point,  is that problematic? 

What would be the next step to try to get the most chocolate taste out? What phase should be longer or shorter? How can I experiment with some kind of plan instead of just randomly do this or that...

Bad news: They're likely not going to hire a direct replacement for her, and my job responsibilities are going to change. Not dramatically, but still change. It's a desk job, but the best example I can come up with is if you worked as a barista and suddenly your job making coffee turned into making boba instead. Same overall skillset but a different application of those skills that will require some training, if that makes any sense.

I only just got this information. There's been a lot of upheaval at work in the last year, but the stability of what I do staying the same helped me cope with the change. Now I feel like I don't have the coping skills needed to handle this gracefully because that last sense of normalcy is gone.

And your cats litter box.,"Currently doing a sit that I took pretty last minute because I’m going on a trip and wanted some extra spending money. House was a little messy and could smell some odor when we got to the litter box at the meet and greet, but it wasn’t awful and looked like it just needed to be scooped for the day. Was told everything would be cleaned. 

There is moldy food in the fridge, half drank coffee on the counter, food covered dishes in the sink, the coffee pot still has coffee in it, dirty laundry around, and even though the litter box was scooped when I arrived the odor is in fact worse. I can tell this owner does not empty and clean their box. Even if it is scooped religiously, your house smells atrocious when you don’t empty the litter and scrub/sanitize the box. 

The cat’s litter box is in the bathroom, the only bathroom that I have access to. I gagged cleaning it today, and can’t shower or do anything in the space because of the smell. 

If it was just one of these things I could over look it, and I often will leave the house cleaner than I find it. I’ll vacuum, mop, wash the sheets/remake the bed, and any dishes I touch will be clean. If there’s one or two things in the sink then I’ll clean those too, sometimes you need a glass of water and a plate for your breakfast before you go. 

But I don’t want to do your sink of crusty dishes and clean your coffee pot. I also do not want to let that coffee/dishes sit for the 4 days I am here and have it get disgusting. I don’t feel comfortable putting my groceries in your fridge next to your moldy food (that’s out in the open! Not even in a container!!!). And to top it off, I would like to be able to shower/go to the bathroom/etc without the overwhelming smell of cat piss.

This is a rant and I’ve learned my lesson. I’m probably going to stop taking last minute sits and cat sits for a while. As a side note, the pets are wonderful and I enjoy being with them, it’s the rest of it that makes it tough. ",17,1768336083.0,RoverPetSitting,3,0.82,False

He told me: "" I will make you a gf."" I ignored it and forgot it. I enter coffee shop and order a coffee. Soon woman enter, because she needs a toilet. She sits near me and orders a drink. We start to talk, she gave me some compliments, that I look good, that I have above average iq, that my lips are beautiful etc. She mentioned funny videos on instagram, I told her that I don't use it. We exchanged numbers. She told me that her husband kicked her 10 times, once per day. Night before we met her husban told her to leave a house. She has 2 daughters.

She went to toilet again. When she arrived she  was behind me, I didn't see her. She was fast and she kissed me. I had less than one second to stop it. But I didn't. Then I kissed her, I knew that it is wrong. Then she told me to go with her to her working place, it is closed at night. I asked her: To talk without noise? She said Yes. I told her that bus will come soon. Then her husband calls. She told me: If see each other, we see each other. If we don't see each other, we don't see each other.

I go on buss station. While I was travelling, the guilt started to arrive. I touched something that belongs to other man. Next day I was feeling guitl whole day. Then I got ill.

I didn't message her, because, if I tell her that kissing made me fill guilty, she will feel guilty too. I felt like I betrayed every man on planet.
If I call her, maybe somebody else will see and it will put her in danger.

1qc23nv,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDebate/comments/1qc23nv/our_built_environment_shapes_our_politics_health/,"Our Built Environment Shapes our Politics, Health and So Much More","I’ve been thinking a lot about how many of our social, economic, and even health problems are downstream of something we rarely talk about directly: the way we build our cities and towns.

Take the loneliness epidemic. A growing body of research shows that Americans are more isolated than previous generations, and I don’t think that’s just about social media or changing norms. Our built environment actively produces isolation. Even suburbia itself has changed in ways that make this worse. Early post war suburbs in the 1950s were relatively modest in scale, with smaller lot sizes, closer homes, and more opportunities for incidental interaction. Over time, zoning codes in many parts of the country have steadily increased minimum lot sizes, setback requirements, and parking mandates. The result is fewer neighbors within walking distance, greater physical separation between households, and an everyday life that increasingly requires a car. Car centric development and strict single family zoning mean that most daily activity involves moving from one private space to another. You don’t casually run into neighbors. You don’t walk to get coffee or groceries. You don’t share public space in a meaningful way. We live physically close to one another, but socially atomized.

The flip side of this is telling. The most walkable neighborhoods in almost every US city, often historic districts built before modern zoning codes, are consistently the most desirable and the most expensive. People clearly want to live in places where daily life is human scaled, where errands don’t require a car, and where community can form organically. The fact that these neighborhoods command the highest rents and home prices isn’t an accident. It is a direct result of artificially limiting how much of that kind of housing we allow to exist.

That scarcity feeds directly into another major source of anxiety: housing costs. When housing is expensive, people can’t save. When people can’t save, homeownership feels permanently out of reach. And that’s not just frustrating. It shapes how people see their future. A big reason housing is so expensive is that we’ve treated homes primarily as financial assets rather than places to live. Zoning laws that restrict density and new construction protect the value of existing homes by keeping supply tight.

What makes this harder is that the incentives are understandable. In the US, home equity is one of the primary ways middle class families build wealth and fund retirement. When someone’s financial security is tied up in their house, it’s rational for them to oppose new development that might threaten its value. That reaction isn’t just NIMBYism. It is a symptom of a deeper structural issue.

There is also a fiscal dimension to this that often gets overlooked, especially in conversations about responsible governance. Dense, walkable neighborhoods consistently generate far more tax revenue per acre than low density suburban development, while costing less to service. Infrastructure like roads, sewer, water, and emergency services are spread over shorter distances and serve more people in compact areas. By contrast, car dependent suburbs require miles of roads, pipes, and utilities to serve relatively few households, which makes them far more expensive to maintain over time. Many suburban municipalities are not fiscally self sufficient when long term maintenance and replacement costs are accounted for. In practice, this means they are often subsidized by denser urban cores that generate surplus tax revenue. From a fiscal responsibility standpoint, walkable urban development is not just socially and environmentally beneficial, it is also the more sustainable way to run a city.

To me, that points to a broader failure of our social safety net. In countries where retirement security isn’t so tightly linked to housing wealth, there’s often less resistance to building more housing. If Americans didn’t have to rely on home appreciation as their main form of long term financial stability, I think there would be far less fear around zoning reform and new construction.

There are also major health consequences to how we build. Dense, walkable neighborhoods are associated with lower obesity rates, better cardiovascular health, and better mental health outcomes. When walking is built into daily life, people move more without having to consciously exercise. When public spaces exist and are usable, social interaction becomes routine rather than something that requires planning. By contrast, car dependent environments encourage sedentary lifestyles and reduce incidental social contact, both of which are linked to worse health outcomes.

I don’t think zoning reform is a silver bullet. But I do think it’s one of the most underappreciated levers we have. Shifting away from exclusively car centric single family suburbia toward denser mixed use walkable communities would make housing more affordable, reduce isolation, improve public health, and ease the zero sum tension between homeowners and renters.

At a minimum, it seems worth asking whether so many of our political and cultural fights are really about values, or whether they’re about the physical environments we’ve locked ourselves into, and the incentives those environments create.",4,1768335525.0,PoliticalDebate,3,0.84,False

She is on her first week and I have been pushing her to make sure to get enough electrolytes in. 

I typically use a powdered mix and it has worked for me. She reached out noting stomach cramps today and that sounds like maybe a lack of electrolytes to some extent. She is using those ""MiO Hydrate"" drink mixes (the ones that you squirt in your drink). I know they sort of have some of the non-reccomended sweeteners but they don't have the maltodextrine. Some quick background. She is a great cook and has been largely eating fatty healthy proteins (steaks, eggs, chicken, all cooked in bacon fat/butter/healthy oils) along with keto approved veggies (zucchini / leafy salad greens / bell peppers). She is not really doing what I would consider a ""dirty keto"" (eating processed ""keto"" foods). She does however utilize some artificial sweeteners in her coffee, and an electrolyte drink mix. In an effort to not overwhelm her while she's starting out with information on all the bad/good artificial sweeteners, I just noted to her that a main concern when looking at nutrition labels for these things is to avoid maltodextrine. 

Given the background, I've got two questions. 1.) Would early stomach cramps be related to electrolytes or perhaps something else (maybe just her body adjusting to fat for fuel over carbs). 

2.) Are those MiO Hydrate drink mixes a good source of electrolytes? I know that often you need other supplements for electrolytes to work properly but i'm unsure of what those are? Perhaps this isn't a good source of electrolytes for her? ",1,1768335397.0,keto,4,1.0,False
