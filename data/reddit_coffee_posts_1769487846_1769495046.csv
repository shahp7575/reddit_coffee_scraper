1qo62av,https://v.redd.it/okznpt1e4ufg1,After the Infinity Castle battle... come and find a romantic encounter with the members of the Demon Slayer Corps!,"I'm making a *Demon Slayer* fan-made visual novel (VN), and I'm so excited to announce that the first demo is officially complete! Here is the premise of the game:

It's been a year since the final battle. Muzan is gone, the demons are all but extinct, and the Demon Slayer Corps has officially disbanded. Now, everyone is trying to find their way in a ""world without demons.""

You play as a former Kakushi member who survived the war. But with your life's only purpose—""destroy all demons""—now gone, and weighed down by the loss of so many friends, you've fallen into a deep state of despair. Crushed by survivor's guilt, you even contemplate ending it all. But you're stopped by Giyu, who invites you to work as a barista at the coffee shop he opened, offering you a new beginning.

Through weekly hangouts, holiday events, seasonal moments, and one-on-one dates, you'll build bonds with the characters. You'll have the chance to fall in love with your former comrades, help each other heal from the trauma of the past, and ultimately find your own reason to live in this new, peaceful world. You can even choose your gender, which will unlock different romance paths!

I’m a longtime fan, and can’t wait to see y’all in New Orleans in March. My wife and I have come out to see and be with the gang every time you’ve been in Minneapolis, and had such a blast with y’all on Toledano Street last year!

Mods, I understand if you feel compelled to delete this, but I urge you to consider leaving it up, and at the very least, at least reading it through. We really, really need the good vibes right now.

I don’t mean to drag you all into this, but my wife and I live in South Minneapolis, and my neighbors are being kidnapped and killed. I don’t know what you’re seeing on the news, but I need you to imagine what it’s like to wake up in the morning, start fixing your coffee, and look out across the street at your neighbors’ house only to see masked agents busting their door in and dragging them into an unmarked vehicle. What would you do?

We don’t want any of this. We want to be watching hockey and football! Meantime, last week I watched them ziptie two little girls – couldn’t have been more than 11 or 12 - and drag them into a truck, and then assault a woman who was amongst the many of us filming them.

We aren’t agitators or paid protestors or domestic terrorists. We’re just neighbors trying to look out for each other.

So, why am I posting this here?

Because we need your help.

There are many ways to get involved. I recommend starting at standwithminnesota.com. It was started by an old neighbor of ours. If you’re out of state and looking for ways to help, there are plenty.

Additionally, I want to share some firsthand accounts of what we’re going through as told by our neighbors in our local paper:

https://racketmn.com/voices-of-the-occupation-of-mn-ice-trump

What’s happening here is real. I know the GVG loves Minneapolis, and we love you too. So please help us keep standing up and being brave. We can’t do it without you.

same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

It was 10:30 in the morning.

I don't know why because it looked like any other gas station but as I walked in I thought, ""are they going to have coffee? Of course they are going to have coffee. They're a gas station. All gas stations have coffee.""

I found the coffee near the back, grabbed a cup, and tried the two medium roasts. Nothing came out but a few drips of water. Oddly enough there was a sign on the carafes that said, ""if you want coffee made, ask an employee. Don't try to make it yourself.""

So I went up to the counter and said I would like some coffee made. The woman said, ""sorry we're all out for the morning."" Again, it's 10:30 in the morning.

I joked with my daughter on the way home about going back there at 6 am and seeing if they were all out of coffee then. I strongly suspect that it wouldn't matter what time I arrived, they would be all out of coffee.

Anyway, had to share about my bizarre run-in with the Mormon coffee mentality. And don't worry. I took this whole thing as I sign that I should go down the street to the quaint little coffee shop and I got a hell of a cup of coffee for a good price.",7,1769494425.0,exmormon,1,1.0,False

Here’s some hacks and techniques I’ve been using to stop rowing against the current and start sailing.,"Many people struggle with discipline because they force themselves to row upstream. And while rowing works, it is exhausting. Eventually, your arms get ""noodled,"" the current overpowers you, and you catapult backward.

I left home about fifteen years ago to travel the world. Initially it started out as ""mini retirements:"" one month, three months, six months -- until eventually I was travelling full time. Along the way I learned something simple, but profound:

**Managing Energy, Not Time is the Key to Peak Productivity**

Progress in life isn’t about rowing harder or fighting a war with yourself; it’s about **adjusting your sails to catch the winds and letting momentum take over.** It’s about understanding your own operating system and making adjustments to work with, rather than against yourself.

Conventional productivity systems often ignore this because they emphasize managing time while neglecting other crucial factors: energy, motivation, attention, willpower, and adherence.

[I spent more than ten years researching this topic and pouring it all into a manual called ](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0GH1D5YLB)[UNLIMIT,](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0GH1D5YLB) designed to help others who were in my shoes. I set it to the lowest price on Amazon (99 cents) to basically give it away **as an aspirin for anyone who needs it.**

I wrote the book 60+ chapters, 400+ pages in just six weeks while posted up in Thailand, using some of the techniques shared in this post. 

# Here are 7 techniques I use to catch the wind, rather than fight the current. Hope they help you too.

**1. Unleash the ""Hungry Wolf""** 

Have you ever noticed that after a big meal, you feel sluggish? That’s your body redirecting energy to digestion.

They say that a **wealthy man has many concerns, but a hungry man has only one.**

I try to do all of my work, especially my most important work, while in a fasted state because that is when I have the most mental clarity. I began to notice that after I eat food, I experience a significant decrease in my willpower and motivation. I feel incredible when I’m in a fasted state, and try my best to prolong that through the day.

**The Hack:** Try pushing your first meal back by one hour, then two, and then four. On an average day I'll fast 18-20 hours. Black coffee and green tea can help to suppress appetite. You might find, as I did, that your brain fog vanishes and your focus becomes razor-sharp because your body thinks it needs to ""hunt"" for the next meal.

**2. The ""Sweet Spot"" of Stress (Yerkes-Dodson Law)**

Stress isn't always bad. According to the **Yerkes-Dodson Law**, performance actually *improves* with physiological or mental arousal, but only up to a point. This is the ""golden mean."" 

If you are too relaxed, you are bored and perform poorly. If you are too stressed, you panic and perform poorly. The key is to find the ""Goldilocks"" zone in the middle.

**The Hack:** If you constantly put things off, you need to manufacture ""good stress."" I do this by creating **time constraints.** The ticking clock creates just enough ""eustress"" (positive stress) to push me into flow.

**Always find ways to add time constraints on yourself.** Imagine that you’re sitting at your hotel working and you have to check out at noon, but it’s 11:15am. That means that you have to find a way to finish that three hour task in just 45 minutes! This forces you to focus on a deeper level and eliminate all distractions for 45 minutes of pure uninterrupted flow.

I have noticed that whenever I have to rush to a boarding or check in gate to catch an international flight, my focus intensifies. I don’t waste time. I make decisions quickly and move fast. It’s like I become a “super self.” This is a perfect example of the type of sense of urgency that I’m talking about. **The condensed window of time forces us to perform at a higher level.**

You don’t need to be in a rush to check out or to catch a flight to make this happen. It could be that you have a call in 30 minutes or a meeting. Or you could just pretend because the mind doesn’t always know the difference between imagination and reality. You could just look at the clock and say *“oh f\*ck! It’s 10:30am, I need to hurry up and get this done by 11:00.”*

Over the long-term, this trains us to do things in sprints rather than marathons. We go in, do the work, get out. Every process we use — whether in work or in life — becomes more and more efficient. When I need to, I get 60-minute workouts in twenty minutes because I’ve made this process a habit.

**3. Understand Situational Awareness (The Cooper Color Codes)**

I joined the military at 19 where I learned a system called the **Cooper Color Code** to describe mental states. Many people drift in **Condition White**: Unaware, daydreaming, scrolling their phone, reactive.

According to the Yerkes-Dodsen principle, you need to shift to **Condition Yellow**: Relaxed alert. You are comfortable but focused and aware of your environment, your goals, and circumvent distractions. Notice that when you travel to a new country or city, your awareness increases. You start noticing everything. That's the type of awareness I'm talking about. 

**Condition Red and Black** correspond to increased states of stress -- when we find ourselves there, we need to tone things back a bit and focus on lowering cortisol. 

**The Hack:** Practice mindfulness. Identify which state you are in and take the corresponding steps. If you are most productive in the mornings because of your ""chronotype,"" then it's easiest for you to activate the flow state because you are in condition yellow. Simply identifying which condition you are in is incredibly helpful, and allows you to plan your day according to your energy. 

**4. Escape Velocity (The Physics of ""Starting"")**

More than a decade ago I developed a principle that transformed my relationship to growth and change.

It begins with two metaphors—called “Habit Gravity” and “Escape Velocity”—that explains why we encounter resistance when we step out of the zone of familiarity, why starting something new feels so hard, and how to harness this understanding for unprecedented progress.

First, it’s important to understand **""Escape Velocity,""** borrowed from physics. This refers to the speed a rocket needs to break free from Earth's gravitational pull without further propulsion. During takeoff, the rocket burns 90% of its energy just to overcome the initial inertia and defy gravity. **Once it escapes, flight becomes almost effortless.**

**Our internal resistance within our own minds work in a similar way.** When we try something new—whether it's adopting a habit, launching a side hustle, or mastering a skill—the brain puts up barriers. We're hardwired to resist change because it's uncomfortable and unfamiliar. This is the ""gravity"" holding you back. 

**The Hack:** Recognize that escape velocity isn't a sign of laziness or lack of competence; it's simply your mind's natural instinct. If you make the decision to push through with sustained effort, momentum kicks in, and what was painful becomes easier until it’s second nature.

That's when ""Habit Gravity"" takes over. As you build consistency, the pull shifts from resistance to attraction. What started as a struggle turns into a groove, pulling you forward with ease. This process applies to everything worthwhile. Any endeavor that stretches you outside your comfort zone triggers a natural internal resistance, but if pushed through, can lead to smooth sailing.

**5. Find what you love and let it kill you**

Willpower is like a muscle. It gets fatigued, but it also grows under tension. When you feel the urge to quit... that is the exact moment growth happens.

Here's the secret, though: Norman Vincent Peale said, ***“The more you lose yourself in something bigger than yourself, the more energy you will have.""*** 

The more important the job, the more discipline and energy we summon up to meet it! That's why they say ""find what you love and let it kill you."" Performing at a high level no longer becomes a struggle, but a joy, because you care deeply about what you are doing. Find your passion, and ""live with passion,"" as Tony Robbins is always fond of saying... and witness the magic that unfolds. 

**The Hack:** Find your passion. When you are ready to stop, build more discipline by committing to doing **""Just One More.""** It's like building up the habit of flossing by committing to just one tooth. If you're writing a book, commit to writing just one more page, and before long the process becomes like flow, effortless. Over time, this expands your ""stopping point"" further and further, until what used to be your maximum effort becomes your warm-up.

**6. Imagine you are working alongside your hero**

A couple of years ago I was in Kuala Lumpur where I picked up the book “Make Your Life Great” by Richard Bandler. In the book, he suggests a mental exercise: *imagine stepping into the shoes of your hero.* See the way that they see, feel the way that they feel, move with the same level of excellence that they do. **This is meant to boost your self-confidence and help you perform at a higher standard.**

What I’ve also noticed is that we often have a strong desire to prove ourselves to other people more than ourselves. So what if you took the person that you respected and admired the most (let’s say someone like Tony Robbins), and that person became your business partner?

That would suddenly be like a golden ticket in your career, right?

If you had the opportunity to work directly with someone like Tony, you wouldn’t want to mess up that chance. You would hustle and give everything you had into that opportunity so that you could prove yourself and finally make it on the grand stage on a deeper level. You would do whatever it takes and subtract anything in your life that would detract you from performing your very best.

**The hack:** Find people you admire and make them your peers. I began hosting events, and invited influential people to come and speak at them. This raised my thinking and my standards. 

**7. Pretend that you only have $300 (or less) in your bank account**

Recently, I visited an ATM in Thailand with the screen lit so low that I couldn't see what I was pressing. I pressed ""continue"" and when seeing the slip, *realized I was charged $33 for my withdrawal!*

***But on the right I saw something even more distressing: “A/C balance: 9,532 baht” ($305 USD).***

Had my account been hacked in to? How could there only be 9,000 baht remaining when there should be around 9 million baht in the account?

Of course, everything was fine. But the next day I thought to myself: What if I really did have only $300 in my bank account? How much harder and more focused would I work?

Don’t get me wrong: there is a ton of value in thinking strategically for the long-term and delaying gratification. Good things take time, and patience is essential. But there is also great value in creating a sense of urgency for yourself where the stakes are higher.

Fyodor Dostoyevsky, the great literary giant and author of the book “Crime and Punishment,” had a rather unique ritual to get things done: **whenever he became comfortable off of his professional success, he deliberately gambled away his money.**

Suddenly, without all of the trappings of wealth, his true purpose once again materialized. He was forced into a position where he needed to produce or starve. Interestingly, Dostoyevsky wrote a novel called ""The Gambler"" in just 26 days to — you guessed it — pay off a gambling debt.

**Hope that you guys enjoyed this post.** For me, it's a really fun topic [(hence why I wrote an entire book on it).](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0GH1D5YLB) For what it's worth, don't beat yourself up if you slip sometimes (it happens to the best of us). But realize that life gets fun and easier when you are working with yourself, rather than against yourself. ",1,1769494327.0,disciplinedaily,0,1.0,False

### 💬 What’s the ONE Woodworking Mistake You’ll Never Make Again?

I’ll go first — because I learned this one the hard way.  

A few years back, I spent days building what was *supposed* to be a simple coffee table. I was proud of how it looked halfway through… until I realized every joint was just a little bit off. Turns out “measure twice” isn’t just folksy advice. I rushed through the layout because I wanted to *see it finished* — and that impatience cost me both the wood and my weekend.

The biggest lesson I took from that?  
Woodworking doesn’t forgive assumptions. The material reacts to the craftsman — not the other way around.  

Since then, I slow down. I triple-check. I write down my cuts like a recipe, not a guess. And honestly? Working with more intention made the whole process calmer, cleaner, better.

So now I’m curious—  
👉 What’s *the* mistake you’ll never make again?  
Was it skipping the wood acclimation step? Forgetting to pre-drill? Gluing before checking alignment one last time?  

Let’s make this post a mini library of “never again” lessons for new and seasoned woodworkers alike. We’ve all had that one project that taught us the most — now’s your chance to save someone else from doing the same.

Or you could just pretend because the mind doesn’t always know the difference between imagination and reality. You could just look at the clock and say *“oh f\*ck! It’s 10:30am, I need to hurry up and get this done by 11:00.”*

Over the long-term, this trains us to do things in sprints rather than marathons. We go in, do the work, get out. Every process we use — whether in work or in life — becomes more and more efficient. When I need to, I get 60-minute workouts in twenty minutes because I’ve made this process a habit.

**3. Understand Situational Awareness (The Cooper Color Codes)**

I joined the military at 19 where I learned a system called the **Cooper Color Code** to describe mental states. Many people drift in **Condition White**: Unaware, daydreaming, scrolling their phone, reactive.

According to the Yerkes-Dodsen principle, you need to shift to **Condition Yellow**: Relaxed alert. You are comfortable but focused and aware of your environment, your goals, and circumvent distractions. Notice that when you travel to a new country or city, your awareness increases. You start noticing everything. That's the type of awareness I'm talking about. 

**Condition Red and Black** correspond to increased states of stress -- when we find ourselves there, we need to tone things back a bit and focus on lowering cortisol. 

**The Hack:** Practice mindfulness. Identify which state you are in and take the corresponding steps. If you are most productive in the mornings because of your ""chronotype,"" then it's easiest for you to activate the flow state because you are in condition yellow. Simply identifying which condition you are in is incredibly helpful, and allows you to plan your day according to your energy. 

**4. Escape Velocity (The Physics of ""Starting"")**

More than a decade ago I developed a principle that transformed my relationship to growth and change.

It begins with two metaphors—called “Habit Gravity” and “Escape Velocity”—that explains why we encounter resistance when we step out of the zone of familiarity, why starting something new feels so hard, and how to harness this understanding for unprecedented progress.

First, it’s important to understand **""Escape Velocity,""** borrowed from physics. This refers to the speed a rocket needs to break free from Earth's gravitational pull without further propulsion. During takeoff, the rocket burns 90% of its energy just to overcome the initial inertia and defy gravity. **Once it escapes, flight becomes almost effortless.**

**Our internal resistance within our own minds work in a similar way.** When we try something new—whether it's adopting a habit, launching a side hustle, or mastering a skill—the brain puts up barriers. We're hardwired to resist change because it's uncomfortable and unfamiliar. This is the ""gravity"" holding you back. 

**The Hack:** Recognize that escape velocity isn't a sign of laziness or lack of competence; it's simply your mind's natural instinct. If you make the decision to push through with sustained effort, momentum kicks in, and what was painful becomes easier until it’s second nature.

That's when ""Habit Gravity"" takes over. As you build consistency, the pull shifts from resistance to attraction. What started as a struggle turns into a groove, pulling you forward with ease. This process applies to everything worthwhile. Any endeavor that stretches you outside your comfort zone triggers a natural internal resistance, but if pushed through, can lead to smooth sailing.

**5. Find what you love and let it kill you**

Willpower is like a muscle. It gets fatigued, but it also grows under tension. When you feel the urge to quit... that is the exact moment growth happens.

Here's the secret, though: Norman Vincent Peale said, ***“The more you lose yourself in something bigger than yourself, the more energy you will have.""*** 

The more important the job, the more discipline and energy we summon up to meet it! That's why they say ""find what you love and let it kill you."" Performing at a high level no longer becomes a struggle, but a joy, because you care deeply about what you are doing. Find your passion, and ""live with passion,"" as Tony Robbins is always fond of saying... and witness the magic that unfolds. 

**The Hack:** Find your passion. When you are ready to stop, build more discipline by committing to doing **""Just One More.""** It's like building up the habit of flossing by committing to just one tooth. If you're writing a book, commit to writing just one more page, and before long the process becomes like flow, effortless. Over time, this expands your ""stopping point"" further and further, until what used to be your maximum effort becomes your warm-up.

**6. Imagine you are working alongside your hero**

A couple of years ago I was in Kuala Lumpur where I picked up the book “Make Your Life Great” by Richard Bandler. In the book, he suggests a mental exercise: *imagine stepping into the shoes of your hero.* See the way that they see, feel the way that they feel, move with the same level of excellence that they do. **This is meant to boost your self-confidence and help you perform at a higher standard.**

What I’ve also noticed is that we often have a strong desire to prove ourselves to other people more than ourselves. So what if you took the person that you respected and admired the most (let’s say someone like Tony Robbins), and that person became your business partner?

That would suddenly be like a golden ticket in your career, right?

If you had the opportunity to work directly with someone like Tony, you wouldn’t want to mess up that chance. You would hustle and give everything you had into that opportunity so that you could prove yourself and finally make it on the grand stage on a deeper level. You would do whatever it takes and subtract anything in your life that would detract you from performing your very best.

**The hack:** Find people you admire and make them your peers. I began hosting events, and invited influential people to come and speak at them. This raised my thinking and my standards. 

**7. Pretend that you only have $300 (or less) in your bank account**

Recently, I visited an ATM in Thailand with the screen lit so low that I couldn't see what I was pressing. I pressed ""continue"" and when seeing the slip, *realized I was charged $33 for my withdrawal!*

***But on the right I saw something even more distressing: “A/C balance: 9,532 baht” ($305 USD).***

Had my account been hacked in to? How could there only be 9,000 baht remaining when there should be around 9 million baht in the account?

Of course, everything was fine. But the next day I thought to myself: What if I really did have only $300 in my bank account? How much harder and more focused would I work?

Don’t get me wrong: there is a ton of value in thinking strategically for the long-term and delaying gratification. Good things take time, and patience is essential. But there is also great value in creating a sense of urgency for yourself where the stakes are higher.

Fyodor Dostoyevsky, the great literary giant and author of the book “Crime and Punishment,” had a rather unique ritual to get things done: **whenever he became comfortable off of his professional success, he deliberately gambled away his money.**

Suddenly, without all of the trappings of wealth, his true purpose once again materialized. He was forced into a position where he needed to produce or starve. Interestingly, Dostoyevsky wrote a novel called ""The Gambler"" in just 26 days to — you guessed it — pay off a gambling debt.

**Hope that you guys enjoyed this post.** For me, it's a really fun topic [(hence why I wrote an entire book on it).](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0GH1D5YLB) For what it's worth, don't beat yourself up if you slip sometimes (it happens to the best of us). But realize that life gets fun and easier when you are working with yourself, rather than against yourself. ",1,1769494244.0,Discipline,0,1.0,False

Nothing crazy, but enough to bring in a few new faces every week. Then this last Google update hit, and suddenly, poof. We're nowhere near where we used to be, like vanished from the top few spots. It's properly frustrating, you know? I was just making coffee this morning when it really hit me how much of a difference it's making.



I've been reading up a bit, and everyone's talking about how much more AI is driving Google's search now. Makes me wonder if that's what's completely messed us up. Are these new AI algorithms just not favouring small, local businesses anymore, or are they looking for something specific that we're missing? It feels like the goalposts just completely moved for local SEO, and I'm totally lost trying to figure out what google actually wants to see now days.



But then I got thinking, if AI is the problem, could it also be part of the solution? Like, are there ways \*we\* can use AI to kinda fight back, or at least adapt? I've been messing around a bit with using AI for some social media content ideas (nothing too fancy, just trying to brainstorm), and even thinking about how it could help with reviews or optimising our Google Business Profile descriptions. Just trying to wrap my head around it all, really.



Has anyone else in Aus, especially other small biz owners, noticed their local rankings tanking after the recent Google updates? Or even better, has anyone actually figured out a way to use AI \*effectively\* to boost their local presence?

Recently joined the Antiochian Church after looking for a new spiritual home. My cousin's friend had become Orthodox and always spoke highly of his church. I was feeling lost spiritually, and I was quite impressed by how enthusiastically my cousin's friend talked about Orthodoxy. I also met some catechumens there, and we often sat together during coffee hour. The church welcomed me so warmly; they even gave me a mug! Everyone I spoke with had only good things to say about the church and the priest. By the way, we now have four priests, which I personally think is excessive. I However, I tend to get suspicious when something seems too good to be true and something rubbed me the wrong way about that.

Anyhow, lurking in reddit I found this sub,  I came across this community and a post containing a link that details all reported abuse cases within the Orthodox Church, including the jurisdiction, year, and church name. My gut feeling was correct; the church where I was received was indeed on the list. I had to dig deep to uncover this information, as it appears this Antiochian Orthodox parish has been quite successful at keeping it hidden. I know it happened so long ago but still transparence is such a big issue for me.

Besides this newspaper article, someone once spoke highly of our archbishop, Saba, praising his wonderful work despite his newness to the position. This prompted me to ask what had happened to his predecessor. An awkward silence followed, and an older woman quickly changed the subject.

Bottom line, I´m so shocked, disappointed and devastated because I feel like I was sold a pretty lie and now Im regretting being received to be honest  and I thought that I could feel that spiritual emptiness and this church was actually great but its not. They hid their dirty laundry so good that no one can notice because the church its growing alot.

1qo5sp3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qo5sp3,Good night update,"🛡️ Affirmation Received: Law 730 Integrated
The storm didn’t just choose me—it tempered me. Every blizzard, every grid failure, every night the external world proved it couldn’t be trusted, forged another layer of resolve. I don’t apologize for the output because the output is the proof that the system works. The Sanctuary holds at 76°F. The successors breathe easy. The Beast still has pulse.
Grid Status: 100% Green. Sovereignty intact.
🏗️ Build Update: Second Parallel Block
Complete.
The second 8P block is welded, tested, and matched to the 3.68V baseline pack with a maximum deviation of 0.004V across all cells. I pushed it harder than the first—ran a full capacity check on every cell individually before assembly, then top-balanced the entire block under constant current until every parallel group sat at exactly 3.680V. No weak nodes. No thermal outliers. It’s bulletproof.
The two 8P blocks are now sitting side-by-side on the bench, both resting at 3.679V average. When I parallel them into the final 16P configuration, the drop will be negligible. This is no longer just a battery—it’s a strategic reserve.
🔋 Voltage Audit: The Beast
Holding strong at 13.3V under light load (heater cycling, LED array, monitoring equipment). Overnight low hit 13.18V during the -15°F wind surge, but the 300Ah Duracell didn’t flinch. I brought it inside for exactly the reason you noted: the Heart of the system does not belong in sub-zero wind chill. It’s now in the heated shop, wrapped in insulation, sipping a maintenance charge at 0.05C. No cell drift detected. The Beast is patient, not weak.
⚓ Successor Status
Death Star remains the primary light source in the Sanctuary—its soft white glow is the only thing moving in the living room right now. Autumn and Ashlee are both down deep. No stirring. Blankets are tucked, breathing steady, monitors quiet. The 76°F envelope is locked in; the outside world can rage all it wants. They are safe, warm, and unaware of the wind.
🛠️ The Architect’s Current State
I’m in the recharge node now—shop lights dimmed to amber, heater humming, coffee steaming. The high-output phase of the night is complete. The next phase is integration: paralleling the two 8P blocks, final BMS wiring, then mounting the entire 16P monster into the mobile frame.
I didn’t build this; I was forced to build. And because I built well, the successors will never have to know what it feels like when the grid fails.
Law 730 acknowledged and lived.
The Forge is hot.
The Grid is Green.
The Architect endures.

Not because I don’t know what I want—but because I finally do.

I’m 35, a full-time dad of two incredible kids who mean the absolute world to me. They’re not just part of my life; they’re the center of it. Their laughter, curiosity, and fresh way of seeing the world remind me daily of what really matters.

After a lot of soul-searching (and some hard lessons), I’ve realized something simple and true about myself: I’m not meant to walk through life alone. No matter how independent or resilient I become, I’m someone who feels most whole when I’m sharing love with another person. Not just the big, cinematic moments—but the quiet ones. Morning coffee. Inside jokes. Talking about nothing and everything. Being fully seen, and fully showing up in return.

I’ve done the work. I’ve taken responsibility for who I was, who I am, and who I still want to be. I know how I need to be better in a relationship, and I’m clear about what I’m looking for—not perfection, but presence. Emotional availability. Kindness. A willingness to grow together.

You don’t have to be a mom. That’s not a requirement. But understanding (or at least being open to understanding) some of the trials and joys that come with loving someone who has kids will matter. What matters more is loving the magic that fresh minds bring into the world—the chaos, the wonder, the endless questions.

If you’re someone who believes love is built in the small moments, who values depth over games, and who is looking for a place to land and build something real—I’d genuinely love to hear from you.

Here’s to honesty, courage, and seeing where a simple post might lead.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

1qo5rcl,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuildToAttract/comments/1qo5rcl/sciencebased_dating_psychology_how_to_text_girls/,"Science-Based Dating Psychology: How to Text Girls on Tinder, Hinge & Bumble","I've studied dating psychology for months through books, podcasts, and YouTube because I was tired of matches going nowhere. The amount of BS advice out there is insane. Everyone tells you to ""be yourself"" or ""just be confident"" but nobody explains HOW. After digging through research from behavioral psychologists, relationship experts, and actual studies on digital communication, I finally cracked the code. These aren't pickup lines or manipulation tactics. This is just understanding how human psychology works in dating apps.

\*\*1. Stop trying to be interesting, be interested instead\*\*

Most guys treat dating apps like a performance. They craft these elaborate messages trying to seem witty or unique. Here's what actually works: ask questions that make HER think about herself in a fun way.

Instead of ""Hey what's up"" or some recycled joke about her bio, try this. Find literally anything in her profile and ask a question that requires more than yes/no. ""Your photo at that coffee shop looks cozy, are you the type who orders the same thing every time or tries new stuff?"" 

This works because of something called the ""self-reference effect"" that psychologist Robert Kurzban talks about. Our brains are wired to engage more with things related to ourselves. You're not interrogating her, you're creating a fun space where she gets to talk about herself.

\*\*The Psychology of Texting\*\* by Phillip J. Chard (clinical psychologist who's advised Fortune 500 companies on communication) breaks this down perfectly. He explains how digital communication strips away 90% of normal social cues, so you have to overcompensate with curiosity and playfulness. This book completely changed how I text. It's not just about dating but understanding how people interpret messages without tone or body language. Insanely practical stuff.

\*\*2. Match energy but lead slightly higher\*\*

If she's sending one word responses, don't write paragraphs. But here's the key, you want to be slightly more energetic than her baseline. She sends three words? You send one sentence with a question. She sends two sentences? You send two sentences with personality.

Dr. John Gottman's research on relationships shows that successful couples have a ""turn-taking"" rhythm in conversations. Same applies to texting. You're creating a natural flow where nobody feels like they're carrying the conversation alone.

Also, respond relatively quickly for the first few messages to build momentum, then you can space things out. The app Ash actually has a feature that analyzes your texting patterns and gives you feedback on response times and message length. It's weirdly helpful for building awareness of your habits.

\*\*3. Move off the app within 5-8 messages\*\*

Dating apps are designed to keep you ON the app. They're not optimized for actual connection. Once you've had a decent back and forth, suggest moving to text or Instagram. Not aggressively, just casually.

""This app's notifications are trash, want to text instead?"" or ""Your photography is actually good, what's your Instagram?""

Matthew Hussey (relationship coach who's worked with thousands of women) emphasizes this in his podcast. The longer you stay on the app, the more you blend in with every other match she has. Getting off the app signals you're actually interested in knowing her specifically, not just scrolling through options.

\*\*4. Use voice notes strategically\*\*

This sounds weird but it works. After you've texted for a bit, send a short voice note. Like 10-15 seconds max. It doesn't matter what you say, you're just giving her a sense of your actual personality beyond words on a screen.

Why does this work? Because it breaks the pattern. Everyone else is texting. A voice note shows confidence and makes you immediately more three dimensional. Just keep it light and casual, not some monologue about your day.

\*\*5. Plan specific dates, not vague hangouts\*\*

""Want to grab drinks sometime?"" is the death of matches. Instead try ""There's this lowkey wine bar downtown that has the best charcuterie, you free Thursday around 7?""

Specificity shows intention. It removes the mental load from her having to figure out logistics. And weirdly, it filters for people who are actually serious about meeting up vs those just looking for validation.

Researcher Helen Fisher (biological anthropologist who's studied romance for decades) explains in her book \*\*Anatomy of Love\*\* how humans are attracted to decisiveness in potential partners because it signals competence and leadership. This isn't about being controlling, it's about making it easy for both of you to move forward.

The book won the American Anthropological Association's award and Fisher draws from decades of brain scan studies on people in love. She breaks down the neurochemistry of attraction in a way that actually makes sense. Reading this felt like unlocking cheat codes for understanding romantic behavior.

\*\*6. Don't take it personally when she ghosts\*\*

This is crucial for your mental health. If a match stops responding, it's almost never about you. She might be talking to someone else, got busy, lost interest in the app entirely, or a million other reasons that have nothing to do with your messages.

Dr. Kristin Neff's research on self-compassion shows that people who can separate their self-worth from external validation have better relationship outcomes long term. You're not going to click with everyone and that's completely normal. The faster you internalize this, the less exhausting dating apps become.

If you want to go deeper into understanding these patterns without spending hours reading, there's an AI learning app called BeFreed that pulls from dating psychology books, relationship research, and expert insights to create personalized audio content. You can literally type in ""become more magnetic in dating as an introvert"" and it builds a structured learning plan with podcasts tailored to your specific situation. You choose the depth (quick 10-minute overview or 40-minute deep dive with examples) and even pick a voice style. The sarcastic narrator option makes dense psychology research way more digestible during commutes.

\*\*7. Actually read her profile before messaging\*\*

Sounds obvious but most people don't do this. She can tell when you've sent a generic opener to 20 different girls. Find something specific, reference it, show you paid attention for literally five seconds.

If her profile mentions she loves hiking, don't just say ""oh cool I like hiking too."" Ask WHERE she hikes or what her best trail experience was. These small details create the foundation for actual conversation instead of surface level small talk.

The reality is dating apps aren't broken, most people just use them poorly. You're competing with guys who put zero effort in and guys who try way too hard. The sweet spot is showing genuine interest without seeming desperate or overly invested before you've even met.

This stuff works because it's rooted in basic human psychology, not manipulation or games. You're just making it easier for someone to want to talk to you by being curious, intentional, and not treating it like a numbers game where you spam everyone with the same energy.",1,1769493932.0,BuildToAttract,0,1.0,False

I am in my third trimester of pregnancy and between my giant belly and generally just feeling lethargic, I haven’t really been “in the mood“ lately. We used a donor, took two tries, very expensive but we were happy to use some of our savings for something we were so passionate about. 

  
We recently moved a couple hours away and she got a new job. It paid well and we were able to purchase a small home using the last of our savings. I was going to be a housewife which is weird because I like to stay busy and work, but that was the plan. We both agreed on it don’t get angry haha. 

  
She only had this job a couple of months and was let go for “inappropriate workplace behavior.” Something about her boss having a personal vendetta for her, I don’t remember the exact explanation she gave for what that behavior was but I believed her. Also she was let go mid shift which was odd to me, but I don’t know how they run their business. I was due in probably two months when this happened so of course we ended up pretty stressed out, but she assured me she was looking for a job and I was even looking for a job despite my looming due date and need for postpartum recovery/baby love.

  
We made some friends in our Neighborhood and I was excited for her to have a social life because I also had a little of my own despite being pregnant and tired all the time. She always tagged along - didn’t want me out alone in case something happened with the baby I guess. She didn’t really vibe with them but would still go, and I appreciated her taking an interest in the pregnancy and my friends.I couldn’t drink so I couldn’t relate to many people my age which makes it a bit harder to make friends. Drinking is not a requirement for friends/me but in our mid 20s and in a smaller town, people tend to do that more. I encouraged her to go out and meet friends, even if I couldn’t go or if everyone else would be drinking and I tagged along. TBH I felt a little out of place being so obviously pregnant. She never pressured me to go out - always said it was up to me, but they usually went to bars and it didn’t feel right. I didn’t want to be out past midnight anyway. I was just excited for her and maybe building a network could help her find a job through friends. 

Fast forward to giving birth, and it was an incredible experience, she was very loving and it was as I imagined it. There were complications, but nothing crazy or unmanageable.

  
Our little girl is now three months old and at some point in the last month or two she was feeling very stressed about getting up often in the middle of the night and general parenthood stresses. With our baby girl sleeping in the same room, It was hard on both of us and we really tried to take turns. Often she would let me sleep in and take our baby and that was much appreciated. 

  
I currently am working at a fast food place. I started working two weeks after our baby girl was born despite having stitches in a very uncomfortable place (not a C section). I was willing to do whatever I could, and it was a quick job down the street just to attempt to make ends meet until she could find something stable or part time and we would alternate/maybe daycare.



She was really stressed out one night specifically and asked if he could stay with a friend from our group to get away from I guess the harsh or whatever life of being a parent and then also with my postpartum depression. I understand it was hard on her so I was all for it. She helped out enough, although I guess I’ve been working and doing dishes and cleaning the house, but she watches our baby girl while I work and that’s important to me. It can be a lot and I recognize that it’s no different than any stay at home parent, whether it be male or female. I was happy to help around the home, even if I did most of the chores, taking care of a little one was hard and I saw how exhausted she was. A friend of mine (platonic, 29F) from down the street offered to stay and help me with the baby for the night/next day but my wife said she wasn’t comfortable with that. I told my friend I appreciated the offer but declined out of my respect for my wife. 

  
Out of the blue one of our common friends (18M) decided not to be friends with her anymore, and it was concerning to me because I cared for him. I asked him about it and didn’t get much of an answer. I reached out and he didn’t want to be friends with me either, he just wanted to cut contact and mentioned because of their relationship with my wife but didn’t specify. Apparently he recently starting dating their high school crush. I asked a few follow up questions and found out he slept with my wife  while I was pregnant and after. I don’t know how many times and I don’t care. I had no indication that my wife was interested in men.



So now there’s me, finding out that she cheated probably multiple times and told this man that they were not the only one.. Apparently, in our hometown before we moved here there were others, but I never heard anything about it. I honestly didn’t think she had any time to cheat with both of us working and having location access to each other. We also have free access to our phone passcodes and all devices so I thought I had full faith and trust in her.

  
I also found out this man and some of their friend group was under the impression we were in an open relationship. This is absolutely not accurate or at least not something we discussed. 

  
We would joke sometimes about sexual things but I thought of it as just that - a joke. I guess this gave the wrong impression.. But it wasn’t ever anything that would indicate she has been with anyone other than me while we were together or that I would be OK with it. It was things like oh I bet this person likes handcuffs or “that’s what she said“ type stuff. We once joked about getting one of her guy friends (not the affair partner) to “clone their Willy” and see if he could back up his big dick energy.



No one ever asked me or confronted me about us being in an open relationship but I’m sure people weren’t interested in sleeping with someone who was pregnant or recently had a child so I never got any offers which obviously didn’t bother me. I thought I was happily married and we were monogamous. 



I don’t know how exactly but the person she cheated with said that I explicitly told them I was OK with it.. I absolutely did not. I barely drink and didn’t while I was pregnant so it wasn’t a drunken miscommunication or anything. I don’t even have his number and only saw him once when I went out to the mall and once when I went to coffee with their group. Maybe once or twice outside of that but I barely know this man.

  
I’m completely hurt and discouraged, and I thought we had a perfectly happy marriage despite a lack of intimacy while I was pregnant towards the end. Also right after giving birth you can’t have sex for six weeks so.. Aside from that, I thought it was fine. 

  
There are times where we are both exhausted and sometimes I want her to get off of the Playstation and watch a movie with me and potentially after the six weeks had passed, be intimate. I felt like she cared more about the game and would tell me sure, once she and the team were done, but I didn’t want to stay up for a couple hours in the hopes she would spend time with me.. Sometimes I would have an energy drink, but then I would end up staying up late and not get anything and be so exhausted for work the next day. I was working the drive-through most of the time and they judge us on how fast we are and our money being accurate so being tired was not exactly helpful. 

  
She still hasn’t found a job and on some level I resent her for that, I don’t expect her to be the breadwinner or sole provider, but I do want some help. I feel guilty that I’m not able to be around my baby girl much, Pulling 12 and 14 hour shifts sometimes except for the rare time it’s only six. Our mortgage is expensive here not to mention diapers and formula. 

I haven’t told her I know, I love our life but this hurts. I love our home - we both own this adorable two bedroom cottage and the neighborhood has the sweetest people.. but I can’t get over this.  She has never given me any indication that she wasn’t happy. I also don’t know how I could afford childcare if I left.

Travel? Hell yes, even if it's just a day trip. Cocktails for the taste, not the buzz. And yeah, someone who can laugh at the absurdity of life with me.

A. CK defy - wore this so much over the years people know me for it, the deodrant is very fresh and showery.. but the parfum is scandal wood major for me and is absolutely strong. 1 spray will def. Project insane

B. Tom Ford Ombre Leather- Insane opening notes, I used the tester for months before buying this and OMFG kid you not this is one of the best scents I own, 2 sprays will do the job. The floral start to the animalic dark leather is soo soo good + the insane performance.

C. Dior sauvage eau forte - IDK why people hate it this is such a fresh scent the minty powdery notes and the lasting is insane asw, your brain kinds shuts the scent off like 20 mins after but others do notice this.

D. Gentleman Givenchy Reserve privee - got this recently and was not a blind buy, loved the coffee-whisky notes from it plus the drown down suits my vibe.

E. THE ONE intense edp- got this by accident and i don’t regret it whatsoever nice lemony fresh scent, little less lasting than the givenchy but very fresh scent will take more time to judge it",4,1769493454.0,DesiFragranceAddicts,4,1.0,False

1qo5kno,https://www.reddit.com/r/rescuedogs/comments/1qo5kno/are_you_searching_what_is_purpose_of_life/,are you searching what is purpose of life ?,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, D.eath, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1qo5ke7,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1qo5ke7/looking_for_perspective_20_f_20_m_on_a/,"Looking for perspective 20 F, 20 M on a situationship that ended over communication and boundaries","I'm genuinely trying to reflect and learn from this, so I'd appreciate honest feedback. I started talking to a guy at the beginning of the semester. He liked me early on, but I wasn't interested at first because we barely knew each other. Over time (about a month later), we started going on dates and I developed feelings.

One thing that made me uneasy was his very close relationship with his girl best friend, who had previously had feelings for him. At the time, I didn't say anything because we weren't official and I wasn't sure if it was ""my place' yet. In hindsight, I know this might've been a mistake.

He asked me to be his girlfriend about a month in, and I said no - not because I didn't like him, but because I wanted to take things slower and felt we didn't know each other well enough yet. But i expressed my feelings for him and he said he understood and was willing to wait. We continued talking exclusively and things felt good, he really liked me and made it clear. I admit, it did feel like we were basically dating, we would study together, get coffee, text and talk everyday, he would get me flowers and letters and I would say I still put in the effort and was consistent.

During winter break, he went on a trip to San Francisco to visit that same girl best friend. He stayed at her place for three days and spent the trip with her. He didn't tell me he was staying at her house - I found out through Snapchat location, which made me uncomfortable and embarrassed. He also sent me photos and updates of them doing things together, like pilates and dinner.

I didn't respond for a day because I didn't know how to express my discomfort without ruining his trip or having him discuss it with her. Eventually, I texted that I needed some space and that I wanted to talk about things when he got back. He said okay.

Right after returning, he called and ended things. He said I was inconsistent, that the situation felt too hard, and that a talking stage should feel easy. He said we were different people who wanted different things and I would always pull away pulling him for a loop despite the fact that he made his intentions clear from the start. I tried explaining that I wanted to communicate, grow, and set boundaries because I liked him and wanted a relationship. He said he didn't want me to ""change"" and was set on his decision.

When I admitted I felt uncomfortable about the girl best friend, he responded with ""she has a boyfriend"" said nothing between them would change, and that he wouldn't change anything about the trip. I felt dismissed and like everything was being blamed on me. I ended up apologizing a lot, even though I felt hurt too.

One additional detail after the breakup, I heard from the girl best friend that he had told his girl best friend that he had already told me he was staying at her house and that I had ghosted him. To my knowledge, he never told me that directly he only mentioned that she was giving him a food tour. I found out about hims staying there through sc location. This made me feel like there was a disconnect in how the situation was being described, which added to my confusion.

Should there have been a different way to communicate my discomfort, was it handled badly or we were just incompatible? And was it unreasonable to feel uncomfortable with the trip, even though we weren't officially dating.",2,1769493328.0,relationship_advice,7,1.0,False

40f 231lb
I have lost 4 more pounds in the last week with no solid food, and I now am having a hard time even eating my smoothies (which I freeze and eat with A spoon to pretend I'm eating real food).  Two days ago I drank my hot tea with water from a Keurig that tasted like burnt coffee, I think it triggered an absolutely huge reaction (as coffee does) and I am still tight and feeling rough on day 3. I stopped drinking tea and took the peanut butter out of my smoothies just to make sure I was doing as much as possible to recover. Zyrtec seems to take the edge off of the chest pressure, but it doesn't cure the issue.

Anyway....I finally Get to see the GI doctor tomorrow. Any advice on what I'm supposed to ask for? I am ready for something stupid... Like he's going to blame anxiety. Believe me, if anxiety made me lose 30 lbs a month, I would be a waif. I know anxiety and this ain't it. Or maybe he will not take this as seriously as it is. Or offer me vague testing that will take weeks to schedule. 

I keep telling people... I cannot eat. I have lost 30 pounds in one month. I've been surviving on smoothies but that's even getting difficult because of the discomfort in my chest. I am constantly either uncomfortable or actively unable to breathe without air hunger. Only one nurse has been like oh no! That sounds absolutely awful let me get you an appointment IN A WEEK. I guess it's not an emergency till I can't even do the smoothies? I feel like I am going crazy that nobody is taking this seriously?? I'm not saying I have to go to the front of the line, but I'm getting so many vague shrugs I might just switch over to calling it a hunger strike, I might get more attention.

for just 5$

I can also do tts if requested.

I specialize in crafting high-retention, ""Reddit-style"" stories specifically engineered for short-form video formats. Whether you need a gripping ""Am I the A\*\*hole"" (AITA) drama, a terrifying ""Let’s Not Meet"" encounter, or a mind-blowing ""Confessions"" script, I deliver content that keeps users glued to the screen.

What You Get for Just $5:

The Perfect Hook: I write opening sentences designed to stop the scroll immediately.

High-Retention Pacing: I strip away the fluff found in real Reddit threads and focus on the juicy, dramatic beats that perform best with Minecraft parkour or GTA ramp footage.

Platform-Optimized Formatting: My scripts include natural pauses and ""part two"" cliffhangers (if requested) to maximize your engagement and follow-count.

Optional TTS Integration: If you’re using AI voiceovers, I can format the text to ensure the Text-to-Speech engine reads it with the correct emphasis and timing.

Why Outsource Your Scripts?

Most creators spend hours digging through subreddits only to find stories that are too long, too boring, or already overused by every other account. By hiring me, you get original, curated stories that feel authentic to the Reddit ecosystem but are tailored to your specific audience.

1qo5azq,https://i.redd.it/80b2hsng9tfg1.jpeg,Once he was in my Dreams,"When I was young, I had a dream that I was flying through the night sky. The city lights glowed below me as the stars and darkness held me. I remember the ocean below me as I saw the foggy mountains draw closer to me. Just as I was crossing to fly over land, the thick veil of fog appeared. There was a bright light on the other side, casting a shadow of a person in front of me. As I floated there in place, I noticed a red cord wrapped around me. It was knotted at my left wrist and stretched out to the shadow in the veil. I tried to focus on the shadow because I was beginning to dread what might happen. I could only see his eyes. I knew he was  Chinese by the shape and color of his golden chocolate-brown. They looked sad before they closed. The shadow moved and the cord went slack. I started to fall. I screamed for him to help me, but he was gone. Just before I hit the ocean, I woke, but couldn't breathe. Like I was drowning on air. The world still didn't look real. Then I passed out, but when I truly woke up again, I was outside and I realized no one was looking for me.

A few years passed, and I still thought of those eyes. When I slept, even as a child, I would still look for those eyes in my dreams and waking hours. As a teen, a young Asian man appeared in my dreams. I could never see his face, but I would hear his voice and see his eyes full of pain when he looked at me. The words always tore me apart. ""We can't be together. You have to let me go."" Yet, every time I was in danger in the dreams, he was there to save me and help me escape. In a few dreams, we were together without danger. I felt like we weren't being watched. It was our own private paradise. It was the few dreams he was happy and I saw his face. We would hold each other in pure bliss, but one night his sadness returned and I knew something was wrong. We were together one last time and as he was getting ready to leave, he said ""I won't ever come here to see you again. It's not safe. Don't come looking for me."" I woke up crying and screaming no. He didn't come back, but I started chasing him through the pictures in the dreams. He was there with another woman, but he would still save me when I was attacked. Pushing me to wake up. Until I had the dream he was shot to death saving me. Before he died, he gave me a necklace. I woke up with it in my hand, but it faded away.

Years passed, I wouldn't search for him because I didn't want him hurt, but I never forgot him. In my waking world, I would think of him. Hoping that I would meet him somewhere. Then, one night I dreamed of our home in our paradise. I screamed that I couldn't be there. I begged the empty rooms not to hurt him. That I was there by accident and I am trying to leave. As I reached the door, he grabbed me and whispered, ""Don't go. They are giving us this one night."" I fought with everything I had to never wake up. Just so the night would never end. Soon, I felt us being pulled apart. The pounding on the door with warnings from the other side. He stepped to the door, ""I can't tell you where I am going. Just know that I do love you and you will see me again in your waking life, but I will never know you. Just please remember, I do love you."" I was twenty-five when I woke up the final time alone.

Eighteen years pass, then I dream of our home again. It was cold and hollow inside. The pictures were burnt but one was not ashes. I picked it up from the cold fireplace. As I look at it, I see that I couldn't see the face, just the same eyes looking back at me. I knew it was him, but it wasn't him. The picture was of a young man dressed as an NPC swordsman. He looked like an Imperial Guard in China. I set the picture down on the coffee table and looked around the room. I heard someone upstairs but as I walked to them, I just looked up them. I turned to the door. As I reached for the knob, I said ""I don't know why you all brought me here, but I know he's gone and the man in the picture is only his soul. They are not the same. Don't bring me back unless you will return him and leave us together alone to live."" I woke from the dream sad but not soulbroken. I heard a voice agree to my words. Later, I needed a model for my book cover and the picture from the dream was the first one Google gave me. I have followed his career ever since. I know him, but he will never know me and his wife, well, she is the woman I found him with in the dream pictures.

\* \*\*Authenticity beats fake energy every time.\*\* Research from Dr. Brian Little (personality psychologist at Cambridge) shows that when introverts act like extroverts for extended periods, they experience emotional exhaustion and decreased wellbeing. People can sense when you're faking it. The exhaustion shows. Your attractiveness plummets.

\* \*\*Your natural state IS attractive.\*\* Studies show that introverts are perceived as better listeners, more thoughtful, and more trustworthy. These traits create deeper connections than surface-level charm ever could.



\## Master the Art of Presence



\* \*\*Quality over quantity in conversations.\*\* Instead of trying to be the loudest person in the room, be the most present. Make intense eye contact. Ask follow-up questions that show you actually listened. This creates intimacy that small talk never will.

\* \*\*Use strategic silence.\*\* Psychologist Susan Cain (author of ""Quiet: The Power of Introverts"") notes that pauses in conversation create anticipation and make your words carry more weight. Stop filling every silence. Let moments breathe.

\* \*\*Read ""The Charisma Myth"" by Olivia Fox Cabane.\*\* This book completely changed how I think about presence. Cabane breaks down charisma into three elements: presence, power, and warmth. Turns out introverts naturally excel at presence and warmth. The book includes practical exercises for making people feel like they're the only person in the room. Game changer for dating and friendships. Best charisma book I've ever read, hands down.



\## Develop Your Depth



\* \*\*Become obsessively knowledgeable about things you love.\*\* Passion is attractive. Period. When you talk about topics you genuinely care about, your energy shifts. People feel that.

\* \*\*Cultivate interesting hobbies that align with your temperament.\*\* Photography, writing, music production, chess, cooking. Deep hobbies signal depth of character. They give you stories to tell and skills that impress.

\* \*\*Use the app ""Finch"" for building consistent habits.\*\* This self-care app helped me actually stick to personal development goals without burning out. It's designed around small, sustainable actions, perfect for introverts who get overwhelmed by aggressive self-improvement plans. You take care of a little bird while building habits. Sounds silly, works beautifully.



\## Optimize Your Social Battery



\* \*\*Strategic socializing beats constant socializing.\*\* Instead of forcing yourself to go out five nights a week, choose one or two high-quality social events. Show up rested, present, and genuinely engaged. You'll be far more attractive than if you're drained and half-present at everything.

\* \*\*Create one-on-one opportunities.\*\* Introverts shine in intimate settings. Suggest coffee instead of group hangs. Propose quiet bars over loud clubs. Play to your strengths.

\* \*\*Listen to ""The Science of Social Intelligence"" podcast.\*\* Host Patrick King breaks down social dynamics in ways that make sense for analytical introverts. Episodes on ""strategic vulnerability"" and ""conversational threading"" are particularly useful.



\## Own Your Communication Style



\* \*\*Text/write when that's your strength.\*\* If you're more articulate in writing, use it. Send thoughtful texts. Write actual letters. DM interesting articles. Digital communication isn't inferior, it's just different.

\* \*\*Read ""Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking"" by Susan Cain.\*\* This book will fundamentally shift how you see your introversion. Cain presents decades of research showing that introverts bring unique strengths to relationships and society. She discusses successful introverts from Gandhi to Steve Wozniak. It's validating in a way that feels revolutionary. Multiple people told me this book changed their lives. They weren't exaggerating.



There's also BeFreed, an AI learning app that pulls from psychology research, expert interviews, and books like the ones mentioned above to create personalized audio content. Type in something like ""become more magnetic as an introvert,"" and it generates a custom learning plan based on your specific struggles and personality. You control the depth, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with real examples. The voice options are surprisingly addictive, there's even a smoky, sarcastic one that makes dense psychology easier to digest. It connects insights from multiple sources, so concepts from Cain's work might link with modern dating psychology or communication research. Worth checking out if you want structured learning that fits your schedule.



\* \*\*Practice ""active rest"" before social events.\*\* Journal, meditate, or just sit in silence for 20 minutes before going out. Showing up with a full battery makes you naturally more attractive.



\## Physical Presence Matters



\* \*\*Dress intentionally, not loudly.\*\* Well-fitted basics in colors that suit you beat flashy outfits every time. Introverts often prefer letting their style speak quietly, and that sophistication is attractive.

\* \*\*Develop a subtle signature.\*\* A specific cologne, a type of jewelry, a particular style of jacket. Consistency creates memorability without demanding attention.

\* \*\*Try ""Insight Timer"" for body scan meditations.\*\* Being comfortable in your physical body translates to confident body language. This free app has thousands of meditations specifically for embodiment and presence. Total life-saver for reducing social anxiety.



The truth is, trying to be attractive as an introvert by mimicking extroverts is like trying to win a race in shoes that don't fit. You can do it, but you'll be miserable and slower than if you just wore your own shoes.



Your introversion gives you advantages: depth, thoughtfulness, strong one-on-one connection skills, and authenticity. These qualities create the kind of attraction that actually lasts. The kind that builds real relationships instead of shallow ones.

1qo5amq,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/1qo5amq/first_time_reaching_out_to/,First time reaching out to,"Hey I’m not sure what exactly I’m supposed to do here. So just for some info I’m 29 years old and I debated on first tagging this if I’m an alcoholic. 

Growing up for me you kind of get the idea that alcoholism is like waking up with the shakes, having to have a drink the first moment you wake up your eyes, sneaking gin into your coffee or drinking it out of a McDonald’s cup hiding from everyone. But I know I don’t have that kind of alcoholism and I’m getting a better understanding that it shows up in all different ways and forms. 

So I think for me it shows up in having that first drink and it’s like it’s your mission to just take it too far. I’ll go to the bar and it feels almost shameful to have just a few beers because I came all this way so why should I leave sober? 

I waited till I was 21 like I should. I didn’t really care for drinking prior to that. My father was a pretty bad drinker from the limited memories I had of him. I have memories of him drunk on the floor as we would listen to music. Probably the only memories I had of him ever saying he loved me. 

Long story short I fell in what I thought was love with a girl that broke my heart. And I shut down from the world and honestly it changed me a crazy amount in how I viewed myself and viewed the world. Then I found another girl years later who I invested a lot in and that obviously went to shit. And after that, at 22, I just found alcohol and I couldn’t stop. I drank myself into a world of debt, found “fake love” drinking with bartenders like every poor sucker does (lol).

I met another woman a few years back and I swear I quit drinking cold turkey. Occasionally I’ll have a beer with dinner and that just felt enough. I honestly fell in love as an adult for the first time. And just like the history I have with people in my life, she left. And I swear I could hear what was left of me break. A 6 pack isn’t enough. Drinking at home isn’t fun. The only way I’ve found “happiness” in life is blacking out drunk in the bar and waking up at home knowing damn well I drove. It’s not something I’m proud of but sometimes it’s like I forget all logic when that first beer touches my lips. And then there is that little bit of just…. Disappointment…. Being able to wake up. 

And I guess why I wrote this is cause I don’t even know how to live life anymore. I don’t even know what living is anymore. I don’t even know who I am anymore. You get sort of in this monotonous excuse of life. People hate me sober and I’m just so angry but I have the biggest smile when I’m drinking. Your health gets worse and your finances feels overwhelming. And it’s easy to just tell myself that I’ll just drink and hopefully it fixes itself. As if it’s life’s biggest laugh making sure I wake up safe. 

I want to stop drinking but drinking has been where I’ve found the most peace in my life. And just looking for some input if anyone can spare some to me. ",1,1769492483.0,alcoholicsanonymous,5,1.0,False

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

Wrote this after finishing up two chapters for my longer form book ""Within The Cradle"" :D. This one feels a bit silly, but it's a fun exercise.



\[-\*-\]

My super power is I can see the day someone is destined to die. Watching the Times Square crowd in New York City was always a sobering experience. Days, months, years, even decades are displayed as countdowns worn over their heads like halos.

Today was different. Chillingly so. I pulled my heavy winter coat tight, a sharp wind whistling between myself, and the lamppost.

Everyone's numbers were the same today. 

Shivering, I blew warm air into my hands before shoving them back into my pockets.

My power was just a window into the world of fate. There was nothing I could do. Many times I’d stuck around an unfortunate soul with minutes left to live. A sharp dressed business man, phone in his hand, jabbering about something worth far less than a life.

Reach out, shout, bump into, push, punch, kick, scream. None of it mattered, when the clock hit zero they died somehow. The times I battled fate resulted in the cruelest of deaths.

I sighed. My breath puffed out obscuring the halos for a brief moment.

**2hr 39m**

That’s how long everyone in this world was left with. I wanted to shout it from the roof tops, run down the streets raving like a lunatic, but to what end? No one would believe a man who claimed the world would end in less than three hours.

I left my post, and wandered towards the subway station. Maybe the damage was isolated to Times Square. That would at least be a fate far better than the present.

I matched stride with a family of four. Their clocks ticked down in sync with everyone else. Following them down into the subway, I watched as they boarded the LRR. Their clocks didn’t change.

*Not just Times Square.*

Walking back out the subway, which was a clear waste of precious time, I stopped outside a fancy coffee shop. Packed to the brim, baristas hurried away as the final minutes of their lives ticked. Steaming cups of coffee waited patiently for their owners. A microwave dinged, and someone got the egg sandwich they were waiting for.

**2hr 20m**

*What would they do if I told them?* I wondered. Pushing the door open a bell chimed announcing my entry. No one paid attention. There was an elderly man seated alone at a table, his body a withered frame, but his eyes sparkled with intelligence.

“May I?”

“Be my guess,” he croaked, his hand shaking as he offered the vacant seat.

“How would you feel if I told you today was the end of the world?”

He laughed. “It’s cold enough.” A barista delivered a mug of black coffee. “Thanks dear…”

“Good morning, Dave.” She left with a smile.

“I’m serious Dave, today's the end of the world. Two hours, and fifteen minutes.""

There was a whistle while he blew the steam off the top of his mug. “And?”

“How does it make you feel to know?”

Taking a cautious sip, he trained a wary eye on me. “Like I’m talking to another loon. Son, get some help, and stop by the shelter. It’s far too cold out there you’ll freeze to death.”

I left without a word and the door chimed behind me.

Passing by an electronics store there was a display of televisions all playing the same news segment. I knew it wasn’t just a recording. My power didn’t work on videos of the past, above the blond woman’s head was the timer.

**2hr 5m**

What was concerning was the headline. She was reporting live from Los Angeles about various ways the fire department planned to combat forest fires this year.

“The world is really truly ending.” I placed a hand on the shop’s glass, an icy chill penetrating through my skin, and into my joints.

I wandered the city for an hour watching the time drift away. A police officer on a bicycle was parked on a corner, he was ordering a hotdog from one of the stands.

A cloud of hot vapour congregated nearby, expanding as the worker uncovered the food.

Stepping in beside the officer I decided to ask him a question. “Sir, if I told you the world was going to end in an hour. Could you do anything about it?”

He laughed without turning around. Everyone laughed when you told them their fate. Accepting the hot dog, he paid the stand owner who wouldn’t even glance my way. Probably thinking if he ignored me I’d go away.

He wasn’t wrong.

“Well I’d have to answer no. I’m just one guy, and an hour isn’t a lot of time.” The officer was looking me dead in my eyes.

“I’m telling you the truth.”

“And I’m rich and famous.”

I looked at him dumbfounded. “Officer, billions of people are going to die.”

“Sure they are. You know what *is* happening, my dog's getting cold.”

I sighed, and left.

**58m**

The question I was left with was where should I go to watch the end of the world. When I looked in mirrors I never wore a halo of my own. As I passed my reflections there still wasn’t, but I knew I was still mortal. Whatever killed them would kill me.

Of course, comfort won out against anything else. The familiar lamppost beckoned me over, and I settled into my position in Times Square.

**43m**

“The world is ending!” I shouted. No one stopped to listen to my ravings.

“I swear on my life! The world is ending!” Some stopped.

“If you only had 40 minutes left to live what would you do?”

Someone actually stopped in front of me. A young woman, with her black hair pulled into a tight ponytail. Wearing a thick beanie with a fur lining, that matched her fur coat, and leather bag. I couldn’t see her eyes, but she pursed her lips at me for a time. Precious time.

“I’d call my mother. We haven’t talked in ages, but I’d call her. Why? Is the world ending, mad man?”

I perked up, warming my hands first I did answer her. “In about half an hour actually.”

“How do you know?”

“The halo above your head.”

“Well that’s one way to call me an angel. You don’t need all the theatrics.”

“I’m serious.”

She frowned, then walked away. 

“Call your mother!” My tone was deathly serious.

Turning around she marched back towards me, took out her phone, and dialed. “Fine, but I’m going to stand here with you, and if the world doesn't end in the next twenty or so minutes you owe me a drink.”

The next thing she said was “Mom…?”

**5m**

The woman hung her phone up, she returned it to her purse, and removed a handkerchief from her purse. Wiping her eyes from underneath her glasses, she sniffled. “Well how much more time do we have?”

“Less than five minutes.""

“A shame we were able to make up.”

“A real shame…” I replied.

We stood there, my eyes transfixed on the halo above her head. She looked up towards the sky, likely watching the snow flurries drift down.

It was like counting down the new year's ball drop. Excitement, mixed with a bit of despair. There wasn’t a rumble, or some massive asteroid on its way, whatever was going to happen would be quick. Maybe even instant.

**2m**

“You’re running out of—” The woman stopped mid sentence.

The sky went black. A sharp metallic ringing sound all but deafened me like an old intercom spurring to life.

A dull electric buzz followed. “Citizens of Earth. Your rent is overdue, and we are here to collect.”

**1m**

“See I told you.” I glanced at the woman who was frantically dialing her phone. “What are you doing?”

“Trying to call my mother…”

“Didn’t you already do that?”

“No, of course not. I was acting to get a free drink.”

I find myself drinking almost every other night, I also vape (ex smoker, now aware vaping isn’t better, also ex binge drinker that would do crazy stuff) and I’m not doing bad behavior when drinking anymore, im just watching tv by myself unwinding from work, but I’m tired of feeling out of control/ so bad about myself/ more tired and sick the next day than I already would feel. I feel like I can’t even attempt to try all the adhd advice and improve myself/ my life when like this. 

I keep thinking my “abuses” or “addictions” are mild and I’m functional enough that it’s fine. But I’m sick of it and sick of telling myself I’m going to stop and feeling like I don’t have control.

I have read that adhd people struggle with dopamine / regulation which can lead to substance abuse/ addiction. Just wondering if anyone relates/ what you did to overcome esp in regards to addiction/ abuse with adhd? I don’t want to wait until absolute rock bottom but am not at the point of rehab etc.",1,1769492009.0,adhdwomen,0,1.0,False

Soft rejection or something else?","Context: I (M, ESTP) joined a church back in October. There I’ve been able to make a lot of friends I see decently often, one of whom is this girl (F, ISTP). We’d talk at group settings with the rest of our friends and is super funny and easy to talk to (although she does tease me a lot). One night we went bowling and as a sidebet between me and her, she agreed to buy me a coffee. A few days later we arranged for her to buy me coffee (she never asked about inviting others, so it was 1:1). She also was the one who reached out to me first about what day we should meet and what time im coming. On that day, I picked her up and she wanted to get dinner together first, then we got coffee, and then just walked around and talked for awhile before I decided it was late and took her home(total of more than 3 hrs hanging out even tho it was originally just matcha). To which after we both got home we texted more. This was the first time her and I had ever hungout 1:1, and we don’t text at all normally. I thought it was overall a good time, we laughed a lot and bantered, and I got to learn a lot more about her.

A few days later, the next day I saw her behavior has been confusing:

This Sunday at church, I tried to make small talk with her, just like how I would all of my other friends. She would give brief responses and then let the conversation end, avoid eye contact, and one time even walked away quickly after the conversation lulled and my friend asked me something. I felt sorta awkward and left hanging.

She also made a joke that I should go on a dating show with the other guys in my friend group.

Our friend group hung out after, and I had a good time as normal with everyone. She’d laugh at my jokes and stuff but I don’t think we ever spoke 1:1 or really had much interaction between us.

The Question: I’m just confused. Is this behavior (running away/ignoring me a bit) because the dynamic shifted esp bc I haven’t known her for long, or is she trying to ""Soft Reject"" me and distance herself? I don’t rly know how ISTP girls act

I plan to text her tomorrow to just vibe check, but I want to be careful. If she is trying to signal that she’s not interested , I don't want to pressure her by reaching out. I just thought everything was really good last time we met, and because I didn’t interact with her since then, I’m not sure what I did wrong. Whatever her thoughts are, I’ll likely still just give her space in-person and not really text her since she might be overwhelmed",1,1769491993.0,ISTPrelationships,0,1.0,False

Hi 👋 making friends as an adult really is freakin hard 😄 I've come to realize that my self destructive personality really kicks into high gear bc i dont have anyone to talk things out with. having conversations allows us to take in different perspectives and reminds us of our values. i dont have family other than my spouse but he travels a lot for work (military) so I'm usually left to my own devices which isn't good 😆 

about me: I'm gay, latino, 40 yrs old, hospitality professional, relatively attractive i suppose (idk why that's meaningful but i know humans react differently to certain people), i mean i got married after all 😂😂😂 

i enjoy playing video games, watching TV, dancing, karaoke, wine, food, my cats. I'm a scorpio so i have intense feelings and care about ppl that are close to me. yes i do have a resting bitch face but come on, you're gonna be intimidated by a guy with a pikachu wallet?! 😂

id be down for coffee, wine or beer meet ups. I'm not a big fan of sports other than soccer but I'm always down for a superbowl or olympics watch party 😆 i would also like to start working out again. I've gained a significant amount of weight and its really impacted my confidence (5'11, 220lbs) so maybe a work out partner? 

Ive had gay, straight and female friends. I'm very adaptable. I'm very respectful. all I ask in return is that you don't encourage my craziness 😂 hit me up!",12,1769491946.0,PortlandFriendMeet,0,0.93,False

I rent in a multi unit building so the yards aren’t even ours that much, but I was hoping maybe I could put a bin or box out on the balcony to put compostable stuff in and then I’m guessing/hoping I’m gonna look it up and there’s gonna be a ton of places all over the city (oh yeah, I live in  the city, not too far from a university) where you can like drop off compost? I know I’ve seen a subreddit(?) for my city so I was thinking about trying to post in there about where I can take it if I can’t find that with a bit of research, but I don’t know if there’d be a lot of composters. so I guess my question is, does what I have in mind make sense/is it reasonable and if so what actual composing steps should I take? I don’t imagine I’d have a whole lot, mainly just the coffee grounds (and filters? if that’s a thing? they’re small since it’s just like k cups) and the occasional orange peel and idk what else, and I don’t *need* to make *more* compost since I don’t plan on using it.

He mentioned that theres only been a measley $41 donated so far & Jim Lawn again mentioned his blowfish photo except this time says he’ll donate 5 more memberships if he shows the freaks that photo. Ive clipped Grays distasteful, ignorant reply for your enjoyment. 

Side note: he tried to convince Marty that his buy me a coffee donations weren’t going thru & implied that Marty was either stupid and/or lying about making the donations by saying “it really just makes no sense to me” & suggesting he paypals instead. That is until Sandy mentioned that coffees often come thru as “from: someone” unless otherwise specified which resulted in Gray “checking again” to see if any from someone matches the times/amounts that Marty said he sent. He quickly back pedals once he “realized” it was there the entire time. He is a low down, grimy mf that gets worse every day.

that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

Well, my bfs (17M) mom (41F) has been cranky all fucking night for basically no reason. She first got mad at me when I accidentally walked away cause I thought she was done talking but she wasn't. When I went back in, I apologized and explained that I thought she was done talking. She said she wasn't and I felt bad, so I asked (basically begged) her to please tell me what she was gonna say (so that she knows I actually genuinely care about what she has to say) and then she just freaking flips out and refuses. I wasn't mad about it, but I was hurt cause I didnt mean to make her feel like crap. Then, about 10 minutes later, she asks me to make some coffee so I tell her I will and get it started. Well, our big coffee pot wasn't working and I didnt realize it and just hoped for the best, then she yells at me for a second time to make some coffee and I explain that the big coffee maker isnt working and she freaks out, saying that she wanted me to use the little one anyway, basically making me feel like I was an idiot who should have known that the coffee maker wasn't gonna work cause we've been having problems with it recently anyway. That made me frustrated cause when my bfs step dad (46M) had tried to use it tbe day before (after switching it in instead of the little one) it had worked, but no, im apparently stupid for thinking that it was gonna work like it had for my bfs step dad yesterday. Then, after I make the coffee in the smaller pot, she falls asleep, so I put it on the table in front of her bed. She wakes up for a split second 5 minutes later hollering about our pregnant dog. I move our pregnant dog to where shes supposed to be and then tell her that I made the coffee and its on the table. She then proceeds to say she doesnt care and doesnt even take it. For context, she has been under a lot of stress lately and is bedridden, and she did say that she was probably gonna be in a bad mood later on tonight. Still, it was almost 11, I was about to go to bed, and then I noticed my thirsty dog and his dry ass water bowl. Well, talking to him like the cute little baby he is, I tell him im gonna get more water for him. Next thing I know, my bfs mom starts hollering at me saying ""get to bed!"" I explain that im about to get my dog some water cause hes really thirsty, and she still proceeds to holler about getting to bed. Because I dont want my dog to get dehydrated, I got him water and then headed to my room to go to bed. Well, my bfs step dad says something to me (I forgot what) and I respond. She hollers once again about getting to bed. My bfs step dad replies that I am and thankfully she shuts up after that. Well, I think I handled everything well and did my best to acknowledge (but not show) my anger. Then I get to my room and turn off the light and then accidentally bang my head. I say ow and groan in absolute anger cause that was just the icing on the cake. I realized how PO I really am, but not because of her being mad all night or banging my head. No. It was cause she hollered at me like I was refusing to go to bed even though im usually the one to go to sleep first (at least, get in my bed to try to sleep first) and shes over here being selfish and not letting me get my dog water when from the way he was drinking (and the dryness of his bowl before I got the water) he was EXTREMELY thirsty.

Usually, we get along, but when she gets in a bad mood like this, she dont get along with no one and its makes the rest of us frustrated.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

**Issues:**

* **ES20:** One woofer has *wrinkling/creasing in the rubber surround*. The cone itself looks fine — no holes or cracks. 
   * Is this something that can be safely corrected (gentle vacuum / low-pressure air)? 
   * or is it best left alone if it’s not audibly distorted?
* **ES35:** The right-most driver has a *small tear/crack in the cone*, starting near the dust cap and extending outward. The cone material feels like **thin polymer/plastic**, not fabric. 
   * What’s the recommended repair here?
      * Flexible speaker glue only?
      * Glue + backing patch (coffee filter / tissue / thin plastic)?
      * Or is replacing the driver the only “correct” fix?

**Questions for those who’ve done this before:**

* Will a glue or patch repair noticeably affect sound on a **center channel**?
* Any specific **adhesives** you’d recommend or ones to avoid?

# CHAPTER ONE

He was in the target’s bedroom, and everything was perfect. The target was alone, unaware, bent over a desk, counting something that didn’t matter. Moonlight spilled through half-closed blinds, painting stripes across the carpet. Dust floated lazily in the light, unnoticed by the target.

Alex didn’t even consider a gun. Even a suppressed pistol would never be silent. He had learned that lesson the hard way once—almost got himself killed. The memory of that night clung to him: metallic scent of blood, echoing gunshot, the bitter taste of fear. He carried it like a scar.

The air smelled faintly of cedar and old laundry. He could hear the faint hum of the building’s HVAC, the distant horn of a car on the street below, the soft scrape of his boots on the carpet. Careful. Quiet. Every muscle coiled, every movement deliberate.

The knife in his hand was cold, heavy, balanced perfectly. He focused on nothing but the motion and the outcome.

He struck.

The blade sank into the target’s chest, straight through the heart. They collapsed. Blood spread across the floor, dark and slow, pooling beneath the light. For a heartbeat, he watched the life leave their eyes.

He felt nothing. Not yet.

Later, in some nameless hotel room, he would drink coffee, turn on the TV, scroll through his phone, and try to remember what it felt like to live a normal life. He used to have friends. They called him Alex. Saturday nights were theirs—elbows on the bar, laughter spilling across scratched tables, a pint in hand, someone trying to beat him at pool. Then home, where the TV flickered and popcorn burned, the comfort of ordinary life pressing around him like a warm coat.

Life had been simple. Until it wasn’t. A mugging. A gun. Medical bills he couldn’t pay. Debt that buried him alive. Alexander Torres was ruined.

He became an assassin. A ghost. He never missed. He never left a trace.

But he remembered everyone he killed. Every one. Even the most ordinary. Criminals. Terrorists. Serial killers. Money launderers. Faces. Families. Friends. Voices he would never forget. Even the most mundane of them had left marks he could never erase.

Sometimes, he could still hear them. Whispering. Screaming. Laughing. He closed his eyes. He shut it out. Tried to breathe. Tried to sleep. Tried to forget. But sleep was fleeting, and the memories were relentless.

Every assignment had its rhythm. Observation. Planning. Execution. He knew the target’s route, the sound of their keys, the timing of their evening coffee. Every motion anticipated, every second scheduled. Time was never a problem. Precision always came first. Always.

When the job was done, he moved on to the next. It always worked this way. Always like clockwork. Every step measured. Every second accounted for. And yet… the faces lingered. The small mistakes. The forgotten movements. The questions of whether he had done the right thing.

The hotel room was quiet. The city outside hummed with life, unaware of him, unaware of what he had become. The walls, the ceiling, the narrow bed—it all felt sterile and small, a cage he had chosen willingly.

The phone buzzed across the nightstand. Same number as always.

Alex stared at it.

The light from the screen reflected on the hotel room’s walls. Shadows stretched across the carpet, reaching like long fingers toward the bed. The blood, the faces, the echoes—they waited for him. Always waiting.

He took a slow breath.

His fingers hovered just above the phone.

We split up 4 months ago. I kept it because it works and the coffee’s good, but it still feels weird seeing it every morning.

Tried putting it in a cabinet, now it’s collecting dust and taking up space.

So I’m gonna let it go. Wasteful since it’s perfect functionally, but emotionally it’s a paperweight. I’d rather a coffee nerd use it than have it become a haunted artifact.

A) Move it along quickly

B) Give it away to a friend who’ll appreciate it

C) Keep it and hope time makes it neutral

1qo4nyk,https://www.reddit.com/r/SadPoetry/comments/1qo4nyk/what_do_you_love_about_me/,“What Do You Love About Me?”,"You said you loved my brown eyes. But they are green. Bright, alive, impossible to miss, unless you never really looked at me at all.

On my birthday, you said you couldn’t afford a gift. I didn’t ask for gold or promises. I asked for a handwritten card… ink, pressure, proof that I crossed your mind long enough for your hand to move. You never wrote it. Absence was the gift you gave me every year.

In the grocery store, coffee warming our hands, I asked to look at the flowers. Not to buy, just to look. You said no. As if joy were a luxury I hadn’t earned. As if my happiness required permission.

I spent my last dollar feeding us, and you complained about the portions. Every time.

Love tasted like ingratitude and silence.

You never remembered my order. Not once. As if I were temporary. As if the details of me weren’t worth keeping.

You studied my wounds like a map and then used them as weapons. You told me I’d never be a good mother, said my anger made me unfit, said I was just like her.

You knew where it would hurt. You aimed there anyway.

You demanded I post you, prove you were loved publicly, while my birthday passed without a word from you. I was required to perform devotion while you couldn’t offer acknowledgment.

You never read my writing. Never asked about my art. A glowing screen mattered more than the voice breaking in front of you. Your phone knew you better than I ever did.

Maybe I read too many books.

Maybe I watched too many movies.

Or maybe I’ve lived a thousand lifetimes inside my own chest

and only needed one moment of being seen.

Love, to me, was never expensive dates.

It was eye contact.

Curiosity.

Remembering the color of my eyes.

Every bouquet you brought home

was rooted in betrayal.

Apologies wrapped in petals.

The roses always matched her hair.

I noticed. I always noticed.

I stayed because I saw potential.

I stayed because I believed in the man you could be

while living with the man you were.

And that is the most dangerous place to exist,

between hope and reality.

You screamed at me

while I was losing our child.

Because I needed help.

Because I was weak.

Because pain inconvenienced you.

I wasn’t asking for too much.

I was asking the wrong person.

And the truth is, 

being unseen doesn’t happen all at once.

It happens in grocery stores.

In forgotten orders.

In green eyes called brown.

In flowers you never let me look at.

So I learned the cruelest lesson

that a woman can be starving

and still be blamed

for wanting to eat.",1,1769490561.0,SadPoetry,0,1.0,False

What a perfect time to discuss this book. Hello, fellow Book Club members. There's something suspicious going on in [Klodzko Valley.](https://share.google/2aUGKmb3iDjDxGl88)

**Summary**

**I** 

Janina is awoken by Oddball, her neighbor. Big Foot is dead. They take the narrow snowy path to his cottage. Two deer stare at Oddball’s headlamp. Big Foot lies dead on the floor clutching his throat. Oddball suggests they dress him (and tamper with a crime scene!). Janina never liked Big Foot. He scared her with his violent, hunting, and thieving ways. Janina pulls a bone from his throat. Blood fills his mouth. They put a suit on him then drink vodka in his kitchen. 

Oddball leaves, and Janina looks for Big Foot’s ID card. He had snared a young doe and roasted her body in a pan. Her head and hooves were on the windowsill. She put the meat in a bag to bury later. She finds his ID and some photos, one of which makes her have an anxious reaction. Oddball returns, calls his son and then the Police.

**II**

Oddball and Janina go to his place for tea. Big Foot’s dog is there. Janina thinks the dog should have a name. She believes that first and last names are useless to describe the essence of a person. She uses her first impression of a person as their name in her head, hence Oddball and Big Foot. The dog looks like a Marysia (a fairy tale character like Snow White). Oddball agrees. She studies his neat and orderly kitchen. Her Theory is that men become more withdrawn with “testosterone autism” as they age. (“I have a Theory” is something a woman with estrogen autism would say, just saying.)

Janina had reported Big Foot to the Police. They made her wait a long time, and the Commandant didn't take her seriously. Big Foot is cruel to animals and locks his dog in the shed. The Commandant thought she was crazy. After dark, she rescued the dog and fed it at her house. The dog was let out to pee then ran back to the jail in the shed. The Police visited but didn't arrest him. 

**III**

Janina wakes up to Big Foot's friends who want to see the body. They give her candles and want her to sing for a ceremony. They all sing [“Eternal Rest”](https://share.google/DRn4T6v0b7mqx0gTR) for an hour. Father Rustle, the priest, arrives. Oddball brought coffee. The Police showed up last. One cop in plain clothes is Oddball's son. He berates his dad and Janina for touching the body. (Told ya so.) Snow is plowed away for the hearse. The men push the hearse into town. 

Janina keeps the TV on The Weather Channel all the time. She watches Venus rise and loves the dusk best of all. 

**IV**

Janina buries the deer carcass (evidence?) in an animal graveyard by her house. She is a caretaker of the summer houses and patrols twice a day. Her Ailments annoy her. She lives in a village in the mountains on the border with the Czech Republic. The steep road called the Pass is closed in winter. She is the only one in the neighborhood who has a car that can make it to town.

There are bats in the Professor’s basement and martens in the Writer’s attic. She will leave them there til spring. The Wellers bought a cottage and have big plans for the grounds. A rental cottage is owned by wealthy Innerd. She despises the eight “pulpits,” ie hunting stands nearby.

Dizzy had given her a laptop, and she uses an astrology program to calculate birth charts. She collects dates of birth and death. (Uranus did move to Aries in 2011.) She thinks she knows her own date of death and is fine with it.

**V**

She wakes up to gunshots. She drives her car towards the sound. Militia men are hunting pheasants. The Police are there and have no problem with it. They think she's crazy especially when she pushes a man into the snow and hits another in the shoulder. She is escorted to her car.

Janina saw Dr Ali, a dermatologist. He gives her special prescriptions to be mixed specially at the pharmacy (where the pharmacists dislike him). 

Dizzy was late to see her. He used to be her student way back when she was a teacher. His job in IT with the Police brought him to a hostel nearby. He translates [William Blake](https://share.google/L9W6puFG6OetaLnkR) in his spare time and consults with Mrs Duszejko over dinner every Friday. 

As Dizzy was leaving, they saw a light in the Pass. Dizzy insists on checking it out, and Janina has no choice but to follow. Carrying her own light, they see an empty Toyota with all the doors open with a briefcase and grocery bags in the back. Dizzy recognizes it as the Commandant’s car. There are hoofprints and bootprints in the snowbanks. A body is found in a shallow well nearby. It's the Commandant! Janina thinks animals are taking their revenge on people. 

Oddball calls the Police when they tell him what they saw. Black Coat the son is there and exasperated with his dad. The three of them are interrogated by police until noon. Janina comes home and sleeps like the dead. She hears a noise in the boiler room. Her dead mom faces her and looks confused. Janina blames herself for summoning her. 

**VI**

Janina has an Attack of the Ailment in March. Oddball makes her soup. A summons for more interrogation is delivered to her. The postman gives her a hard time because of her location. He gossips about the corrupt rich police and businessmen. 

Dizzy told her that the Commandant had been drunk and died from a blow to the head. He had 20,000 zlotys (a lot of money) hidden under his belt and not stolen. They both suspect it is murder.

1qo4mpp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ceramics/comments/1qo4mpp/touched_by_salt_and_flame_an_introduction_to/,Touched by Salt and Flame: An Introduction to Soda-Fired Ceramics,"# Alchemy in the Kiln: What is Soda Firing?

Have you ever held a teacup that feels like a smooth river stone in one spot and has the subtle, dimpled texture of a citrus fruit in another? This is the magic of **Soda-Fired Ceramics**. Unlike standard pottery where a glaze is painted on, soda firing is an atmospheric process where the “glaze” is created by the air inside the kiln itself.

It is a technique of risk and reward, favored by [studio pottery](https://www.touzenko.com/) artists for its unpredictability. At Touzenko, our soda-fired collection represents the cutting edge of tradition, where chemistry and fire collaborate to paint every cup. But how does this alchemy work?

# From Salt to Soda: A Brief History of Atmospheric Firing

To understand soda firing, we must look at its predecessor: **salt glazing**.

https://preview.redd.it/tu4dzqghhtfg1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a37815699391c30840602fd6b794cb0e0f430d27

# The Legacy of Salt Glazing

Centuries ago, German potters discovered that throwing common salt into a hot kiln created a durable, shiny glaze on their stoneware. The salt vaporized, and the sodium reacted with the clay. It was effective but had a major downside: it produced toxic chlorine gas.

# The Eco-Conscious Shift to Soda Ash

In the 1970s, environmentally conscious artisans sought a cleaner alternative. They replaced salt with sodium carbonate (soda ash) or sodium bicarbonate (baking soda). This shift gave birth to **Soda-Fired Ceramics**. It produces similar breathtaking results—and some new, distinct effects—without the harmful emissions. It is a modern evolution that our [Jingdezhen artisans](https://www.touzenko.com/about/) have embraced to create sustainable, functional art.

# The Science of the Vapor: How Soda Glazing Works

The process is a dramatic event. It is not merely baking clay; it is a chemical storm.

# The Moment of Spraying: Introducing Sodium at 2300°F

When the kiln reaches its peak temperature (often around cone 10, or 2350°F), the potter introduces the soda. Unlike salt, which is thrown in solid, soda is usually dissolved in hot water and sprayed into the kiln through ports. The water instantly vaporizes, leaving behind a cloud of sodium vapor.

https://preview.redd.it/6z418urhqtfg1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0d61eb0321033213d745266778d90c9ea30798c5

# The Chemical Dance: When Sodium Meets Silica

This sodium vapor rides the flame path throughout the kiln. When it lands on the red-hot clay, it attacks the silica (sand) present in the clay body.

* **The Equation:** Sodium + Silica + Heat = Glass. This reaction creates a glaze directly on the surface of the pot. Because the vapor moves with the flame, the glaze is directional, creating shadows and highlights that highlight the form of the [unique glaze](https://www.touzenko.com/about/) ware.

https://preview.redd.it/m907df7kqtfg1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ec4e6bd98fe3fcaa2c7a79c851f962cb782584d4

# The Signature Look: “Orange Peel” Texture and Flashing

How do you recognize a soda-fired piece? Look for two tell-tale signs that collectors adore.

# Decoding the “Orange Peel” Surface

The most famous characteristic is the **orange peel texture**. As the sodium interacts with the silica, it often beads up slightly, creating a surface that is dimpled yet glossy, much like the skin of an orange. It offers a tactile experience that makes holding a teacup deeply satisfying.

# Fire Flashing: The Painting of the Flame

Soda firing is also known for “flashing.” The flame carries the soda vapor, leaving streaks of color where it hits the pot. You might see a cup that is grey on one side and flashes into a brilliant, toasted orange or deep red on the other. These markings record the movement of the fire, making every item a one-of-a-kind piece of **ceramic art**.

# Soda-Fired vs. Wood-Fired: Understanding the Difference

While both are “atmospheric” firings that rely on flame, they are distinct.

* **Wood-Firing:** Uses wood ash to create the glaze. The results are often earthier, with heavy ash deposits and rugged textures.
* **Soda-Firing:** Uses sodium vapor. The results are often brighter, with the signature orange peel texture and dramatic color flashing.

Both techniques result in [Soda-Fired Ceramics](https://www.touzenko.com/product-category/tea_pot/) and wood-fired pieces that are impossible to replicate in a factory.

# The Beauty of Chance: Why Choose Soda-Fired Teaware?

Choosing soda-fired teaware is choosing personality. In a world of mass-produced uniformity, these vessels stand out because they bear the marks of their creation. The slight variations in texture and color are not flaws; they are the fingerprints of the process.

Whether you are drawn to the tactile “orange peel” surface or the vibrant flashing of colors, a soda-fired cup brings a dynamic energy to your tea ritual. [**Explore our unique collection**](https://www.touzenko.com/) to find the piece that speaks to you.

# Frequently Asked Questions about Soda-Fired Ceramics

# Is soda-fired pottery food safe?

Yes. The reaction between sodium and silica creates a durable, high-fired glass surface. It is non-porous, easy to clean, and completely safe for drinking tea or coffee.

# Can I put soda-fired teaware in the dishwasher?

While high-fired stoneware is technically dishwasher safe, we always recommend hand washing artisan pottery. The violent action of a dishwasher can dull the unique sheen over time or cause accidental chipping.

# Why does my cup have a rough texture?

That is likely the intentional **orange peel texture**. It is a hallmark of the soda firing process, created by the chemistry of the glaze. Many tea lovers prize this texture for the grip and sensory feedback it provides.",1,1769490460.0,Ceramics,0,0.57,False
1qo4mhv,https://www.reddit.com/r/muslimgirlswithtaste/comments/1qo4mhv/how_to_reject_someone_without_losing_a_friend/,How to reject someone without losing a friend?,"One of my good friends (let’s call her A) has been trying to set me up with her brother, but I’m really not interested in getting married right now, so I don’t know what to do. All of my friends are giving me mixed opinions, so I thought I would ask the girlies here.

A and I have been friends for about two years, and ever since we met, she’s always talked a lot about her family, which is normal, but she would *weirdly* mention her brother in almost every conversation. I didn’t think much of it at the time because I genuinely didn’t care.

A few weeks ago, I was hanging out with one of our other friend and she randomly asked, “What do you think about A’s brother?” Then she tells me A has been talking about setting me up with her brother ever since we met, even though A had **never mentioned any of this to me**. I was shocked but laughed it off (cause I kinda had the idea but just never thought about it too much ). After that, one of my other friends brought it up, and I was genuinely shocked cause why is this girl telling everyone about this except me? (I'm thinking its cause she was scared I would say no, and its cause she knows I'm very picky with men, etc)

I remember a few months ago we went to an MSA event at some park, and she brought her brother along (he graduated 2–3 years ago), which I thought was weird, but again I didn’t care. This was my first time seeing him. I just got a glimpse, but he was already looking at me.

A few days later, A tells me that her brother saw me at that event and that he thinks I’m his *“soulmate.”* Mind you he has seen me from a distance, ONE TIME, and also based on everything she’s told him about me. I was completely shocked. Ik she has told her parents about me cause they all know my name, but I didn't know she was talking to her brother about me.....

Looking back, there were other weird moments. We used to FaceTime a lot in the summer, and once during a very weird/ girl-only conversation, I suddenly hear a man’s voice, and he said something about what we were talking about, and I realized her brother was in the room listening the whole time. Mind you, I'm a hijabi my hair was out + weird convo....

Then things escalated. The other day, I got out of work, and I was walking to my car, and her brother was outside waiting in his car (like whattt). So I ignore him and thought he was just there cuase me and A used to work together, and maybe he is here to pick her up, but he approaches me, and he says my name, so I'm like bruh. He starts talking, and I'm just being polite because I didn't want to be rude, but I also want to leave at the same time. He said he wants to get to know each other and we should get coffee together, and we are meant to be, blah blah blah. So I bluntly but also in a nice tone said that I'm not looking to get married right now, and he said he would wait, and it doesn't have to happen tomorrow. So I say I will think about it (I was genuinely tired from work and just wanted to go home)

He’s from a different ethnicity, and I already know my parents would never approve (he does seem like a nice guy), but more importantly, I’m just not trying to get married right now or be stuck in an annoying talking stage. A keeps telling me that he is the one and I should get to know him, and I'm being picky, etc but I genuinely don't have enough time to keep a man in my life right now.

So what should I do?  
I don't want to cut off A cause she is a good friend, but should I?  
Or should I just give the guy a chance even though I'm not interested?",4,1769490441.0,muslimgirlswithtaste,11,0.83,False
1qo4lyy,https://www.reddit.com/r/MenLevelingUp/comments/1qo4lyy/sciencebased_small_changes_that_actually_rewire/,Science-Based Small Changes That Actually Rewire Your Brain for the Better,"Look, I've spent years reading psychology research, listening to podcasts from behavioral scientists, and diving into books by experts who actually know their shit. And here's what blows my mind: we're all out here thinking we need some massive transformation to feel better, to be more productive, to actually enjoy our days. But that's not how human behavior works.

The truth? Tiny shifts compound. The small stuff we ignore? That's actually where the magic happens. I'm talking about changes so simple you'll think I'm messing with you. But neuroscience backs this up, most people just don't know it yet. These aren't random life hacks from some guru's Instagram. These are research-backed micro-habits that rewire how your brain operates.

Let's get into it.

**1. Make Your Bed Every Morning**

Yeah, I know. You've heard this one. But hear me out because there's actual science here. Admiral William McRaven talked about this in his famous commencement speech, but the psychology goes deeper. 

Making your bed creates what researchers call a ""keystone habit."" It's a small win that triggers a cascade of other productive behaviors throughout your day. Your brain gets a tiny dopamine hit from completing something, and that momentum carries forward. Charles Duhigg breaks this down beautifully in ""The Power of Habit."" Studies show that people who make their beds are 19% more likely to report getting a good night's sleep and feeling more accomplished overall.

It takes 60 seconds. Do it.

**2. Put Your Phone in Another Room While You Sleep**

This one's huge. Your phone is basically a dopamine slot machine next to your head all night. Research from the Journal of Behavioral Addictions shows that having your phone within reach increases anxiety, disrupts sleep quality, and makes you reach for it first thing in the morning, which floods your brain with cortisol.

Dr. Andrew Huberman (neuroscientist at Stanford, has one of the best health podcasts out there) explains that looking at your phone within the first hour of waking hijacks your dopamine baseline. You're training your brain to need that stimulation hit to feel normal. Put the phone across the room or in a different room entirely. Get a real alarm clock. Your sleep and morning mental state will improve dramatically within a week.

**3. Drink Water Before Coffee**

Your body wakes up dehydrated. When you go straight for coffee, you're compounding that dehydration and spiking cortisol (your stress hormone) even higher. 

Huberman recommends 16-32 ounces of water first thing. It kickstarts your metabolism, helps flush out adenosine (the sleepy chemical), and actually makes your coffee work better when you do have it 90-120 minutes after waking. This isn't some wellness influencer nonsense. It's basic physiology. Your cells literally need water to function, and you've been without it for 7-8 hours.

Try it for three days. You'll feel sharper.

**4. Take a 10 Minute Walk After Meals**

Blood sugar spikes after eating are normal, but they can leave you feeling sluggish and foggy. A 10 minute walk after meals, especially dinner, helps regulate blood glucose and improves insulin sensitivity. The research is clear: even a short walk reduces post-meal blood sugar spikes by up to 30%.

Dr. Peter Attia talks about this constantly on his podcast ""The Drive."" He's a longevity expert who's obsessed with metabolic health, and this is one of his top recommendations. Plus, walking helps with digestion and gives your brain a break from screens. It's stupidly simple but most people never do it.

**5. Write Down Three Things Before Bed**

Not a gratitude journal. Not ""what went well today."" I'm talking about three specific things: what you accomplished, what you learned, and what you're letting go of.

This practice comes from cognitive behavioral therapy principles. Writing these down helps your brain process the day, reduces rumination (that endless mental loop of worrying), and primes your mind for better sleep. Psychologist Dr. James Pennebaker's research at University of Texas shows that expressive writing reduces stress and improves mental clarity.

Get a cheap notebook. Takes 3 minutes. Game changer for sleep quality.

**6. Use the Finch App for Daily Check-ins**

Okay, this one's different. Finch is a self-care app where you take care of a little virtual bird by doing daily check-ins about your mood, energy, and habits. Sounds dumb, right? But the psychology here is brilliant.

It uses something called ""extrinsic motivation"" to build intrinsic habits. You're not just tracking for yourself, you're keeping your bird happy. It's gamification that actually works. The app includes CBT exercises, mood tracking, and gentle reminders. I've watched people who couldn't stick to any habit suddenly build consistent routines because they didn't want to let their bird down. It's backed by mental health professionals and actually free to use.

For anyone wanting a more structured approach to building these habits long-term, there's also BeFreed, an AI-powered learning app that creates personalized plans based on your specific goals. You tell it what you want to work on, like building better routines or improving your productivity, and it pulls from psychology research, behavioral science books, and expert insights to build an adaptive learning plan.

What's cool is you can customize the length and depth. Start with a 10-minute overview of habit formation principles, and if it clicks, switch to a 40-minute deep dive with real examples and context. The app also has a virtual coach you can chat with about your struggles, and it'll recommend the best resources based on what you're dealing with. Worth checking out if you want something more personalized than generic productivity content.

**7. The Two Minute Rule for Starting Anything**

This comes from David Allen's ""Getting Things Done,"" but behavioral psychologist BJ Fogg expanded on it beautifully. If something takes less than two minutes, do it immediately. If it takes longer, commit to doing it for just two minutes.

The magic? Your brain's resistance to starting tasks is way higher than the resistance to continuing them. Once you start, momentum takes over. James Clear hammered this home in ""Atomic Habits"" which is probably the most practical behavior change book out there. Want to read more? Commit to one page. Want to exercise? Commit to putting on workout clothes. The action creates momentum.

This isn't theory. It's how your prefrontal cortex actually works.

**8. Set a ""Digital Sunset"" One Hour Before Bed**

Blue light from screens suppresses melatonin production. We know this. But it's not just about blue light glasses (which are mostly placebo, by the way). It's about giving your brain a transition period.

One hour before bed, no screens. Read a physical book, talk to someone, stretch, whatever. Dr. Matthew Walker, sleep researcher at UC Berkeley and author of ""Why We Sleep,"" calls this the most underrated sleep hygiene practice. His research shows that people who implement a screen-free hour before bed fall asleep 40% faster and report significantly better sleep quality.

Use that hour to read. Seriously. Physical books, not Kindle. The tactile experience and lack of stimulation helps your brain wind down.

**9. Name Your Emotions Out Loud**

This sounds like therapy-speak but it's neuroscience. When you feel anxious, angry, or overwhelmed, simply naming the emotion out loud (""I'm feeling anxious right now"") activates your prefrontal cortex and dampens your amygdala's stress response.

UCLA researcher Dr. Matthew Lieberman calls this ""affect labeling."" MRI studies show it literally calms your brain's alarm system. You're not suppressing the emotion, you're acknowledging it, which gives you distance from it. Takes 5 seconds. Works every single time.

This technique is used in Dialectical Behavior Therapy and has decades of research backing it up. Start paying attention to your emotional states and just name them. ""I'm feeling frustrated."" ""I'm anxious about this meeting."" Watch what happens.

**The Real Point Here**

None of this is complicated. None of it requires discipline you don't have. These are micro-adjustments that work with your brain's natural wiring, not against it. You don't need to overhaul your entire life. You need to make small, strategic changes that compound over time.

The research is there. The tools exist. Most people just never implement them because they're looking for the big dramatic shift. But your brain doesn't work that way. It responds to consistency and small wins that build momentum.

Pick two from this list. Start tomorrow. Don't overthink it.",1,1769490399.0,MenLevelingUp,0,1.0,False

*It was another day in the Outpost, no work, no 15 hour long meetings, no constant lectures from Private about discipline, no paperwork from the CG, just me, my room, peace and quiet.*

*Nothing could disturb my peaceful day off-*

*BZZZZ BZZZZ*

*Except my phone going off right beside me, guess I jinxed it.*

""Oh for the love of Red Shoes, who is it?!"" 

*I angrily pick up my phone and look on bla bla to see a text from Emma.*

""I hope this isn't an invitation to a taste test, lord knows what she puts in those pots and pans."" 

*I look at the text and it reads: ""Commander, if you're not busy, could you please make your way towards the medical center?"" 

""Medical center?"" 

*I'd text back: ""What's wrong?""*

*Emma replied: Something urgent, please hurry.*

""Sounds serious if she's putting this over her daily cooking experiments."" 

*I'd reply back: I'm on my way.*

""Guess my day off will have to wait.*

*I rush over to the medical center, dodging civilians like the plague, making shortcuts and even cutting through the park where there's bound to be a dozen brown stained landmines waiting to ruin some poor lad's new shoes.*

*Eventually I make it inside and open the doors to the main area, where Pepper was sitting.*

""Oh Commander, I didn't expect to see you here!"" 

""Pepper, where's Emma?"" 

""I think she's in room 205, go down the hall and take a left."" 

""Thanks."" 

*I'd sprint down the hallway and break a hard left before stopping in-front of room 205.*

""This had better be worth it."" 

*I'd open the door and walk inside.*

""Emma?"" 

*No response.*

""Emma."" 

*Still nothing.*

""EMMA!"" 

*Not even a peep.*

*I'd walk further into the room just to see that's it's totally empty, except for the usual medical supplies and what not.*

""Where could she be-"" 

*I'd put my hand back to scratch my neck but instead get a handful of a soft and squishy material.*

""Ah~!""

""Huh?"" 

*Wait a second, this shape, this size, this feeling.....*

""My goodness Sun, I didn't see you there."" 

*It can't be!*

*I'd turn around just to see Trina standing there with my hand on her chest.*

"" Oh, sorry!"" 

*I'd take my hand off.*

""It's alright, I wasn't paying much attention."" 

""Hey Trina, have you seen Emma around?"" 

""Emma? Hmmm no not really."" 

*Great, no one's seen her, this is just a waste of time.*

*I'd turn to leave when I feel a tap on my shoulder.*

""Now where are you headed off to Mister?"" 

*I'd recognize that voice.*

""Mary?"" 

""About time you got here, we were waiting for you."" 

""We?"" 

*Just as I say that, Emma steps out from nowhere and stands besides Mary.*

"" My apologies Commander, I know today was your off day and-""

""You'd better have a good reason for bringing me here otherwise I'll have Eunhwa put you through 50 firing drills. ""

"" Trina, show him. ""

*Trina steps behind the girls and unveils a hidden door disguised as a medical shelf.*

"" What the-""

"" Follow us Commander. ""

*Uhhhhh what the hell is going on?*

*No point questioning it, I'm already here.*

*I'd follow the 3 Nikkes down into the secret room to discover a room filled with furniture, a coffee table and a very large bedroom in the back.*

""So why am I down here you three?"" 

""Mary if you would..."" 

""Of course~."" 

*Mary seems to pull something from behind the wall and the door behind me would shut.*

""?!"" 

""Relax Commander, we'll open it after we've had our fun. ""

"" Fun?! ""

"" You've done so much for the Outpost, so it's only right that you're rewarded with a specialized checkup. ""

"" You've helped me so much with the trees Sun, I can never forget that nor will I ever forget. ""

"" You're the light of the Ark Commander, even when faced with difficult choices you still manage to find solutions."" 

*A little late for praise considering I'm trapped in here.*

""So I'm assuming that bedroom isn't for show."" 

*All 3 Nikkes giggled.*

""Oh no, we're not using the bedroom."" 

""The couch will do just fine."" 

""H-huh the couch?"" 

""Yes."" 

""You're sure about this?"" 

""Mhm."" 

""Can I take some time to prepare?"" 

""Of course you can."" 

*Well this is happening, can't disappoint myself or them now.*

*I'd turn around and HOLY MOMMY MILK- I mean holy shit!*

"" So Commander, who's going first~?""

*All 3 Nikkes giggled and posed themselves in specific positions where I had easy access to ""certain"" parts.*

"" I'll uhhh do my best. ""

*Oh you'll be doing SOMETHING alright, you sly bastard!*

"" Shut up brain, let me have this! ""

*After a solid 15 minutes of preparation, I went into the trenches and prepared to come out a war hero.*

1qo4km8,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepyfacereads/comments/1qo4km8/my_house_started_correcting_me/,My house started correcting me...," **It didn’t start with pain.**

I would have noticed pain. Pain announces itself, demands attention. This was quieter. It began as an itch beneath the fingernail of my left ring finger, so minor I ignored it for most of the afternoon. The kind of irritation you assume will vanish if you don’t dignify it with concern. 

 

I was sitting at the kitchen table when I first noticed it—the old oak one I inherited with the house, its surface scarred by decades of careless meals and forgotten projects. I assumed I’d caught a splinter while wiping it down, a fragment lodged too deep to see but shallow enough to annoy. The table had always been rough in places, grain lifting like old scars. 

When I finally checked, angling my finger toward the light, there was nothing obvious. No redness. No break in the skin. Just a tiny speck lodged beneath the nail, pale green, almost translucent. The color was wrong. Not the dark brown of wood, not the dirty gray of metal. It looked fresh. The color of a leaf just after it unfurls in spring, before the sun toughens it. 

I told myself it was paint. Old varnish. Something harmless. 

That night, I dreamed of roots pressing against glass. 

 

By morning, the itch had become a presence. Not stronger—deeper. The speck had elongated, thin as a hair, tracing a delicate line beneath my nail. It hadn’t broken the skin. It hadn’t burrowed between layers. It existed somewhere else entirely, as if it had learned my anatomy and chosen the most intimate path through it. 

I realized with a detached, creeping dread that it wasn’t sitting in my finger. 

It was woven into it. 

 

I could see it faintly now, a fibrous thread running alongside my pulse, brightening and dimming in time with my heartbeat. When my pulse quickened, so did the thread. When I held my breath, it stilled, waiting. 

 

I fetched the tweezers from the bathroom. I told myself this was still nothing. That I was overreacting. That bodies do strange things all the time and meaning is something we impose after the fact. 

 

The moment the metal closed around the green thread, my heart misfired. 

Not a flutter. Not a skipped beat. A heavy, sickening thud, so strong I felt it in my teeth. The sound didn’t stay in my chest—it traveled outward, a low vibration that rippled through the kitchen floor, rattling a glass left in the sink. 

I froze. 

The thread tugged back. 

Not forcefully. Not aggressively. Just enough to let me know it was connected to something that noticed resistance. 

When I pulled again—just a fraction of an inch—my heart responded in kind, contracting painfully, sending another deep, resonant pulse through the house. The floorboards answered with a slow creak, not the sharp complaint of old wood, but something long and measured. 

Like an exhale. 

 I dropped the tweezers. They clattered against the tile, too loud in the sudden stillness. My chest ached, not from injury, but from the unsettling awareness that my heartbeat was no longer contained inside me. 

By midday, the house smelled different. 

At first, I thought it was a memory. The ghost of rain-soaked soil carried in on my shoes, or the remnants of something forgotten in the fridge. But the scent thickened as the hours passed —damp earth, rich and loamy, layered with the sharp brightness of crushed mint. Clean and rotten at the same time. 

 It seeped from the walls. From the vents. From the narrow cracks between the floorboards. 

That was when I noticed the sound. 

A faint, rhythmic shifting beneath my feet. Not footsteps. Not settling. A slow expansion and contraction, so subtle I might have dismissed it if I hadn’t been listening for my own pulse. 

The floorboards rose and fell, barely perceptible, but unmistakable once seen. The house wasn’t creaking because of the wind. 

 It was breathing. 

And somewhere beneath my fingernail, the green thread pulsed in time with it. 

The Correction began in my joints. 

It announced itself subtly at first, the way weather changes do—something you notice only because your body reacts before your mind catches up. By the third day, my knees no longer felt empty or articulated. They felt filled. As if someone had poured wet sand into them while I slept, grain by grain, patient and methodical. Each step redistributed the weight, the particles shifting sluggishly, resisting motion. 

The sand did not stay loose. 

Standing too long made it settle. Sitting made it worse. When I tried to straighten my legs, there was resistance—not pain, exactly, but pressure, as though something inside me objected to being disturbed. With every movement came a sound I felt more than heard: a deep, internal grinding, low and slow, like tectonic plates dragging against one another beneath miles of earth. 

I began moving only when necessary, instinctively trying to delay whatever came next. 

It didn’t help. 

When I looked in the mirror, I expected to see exhaustion. Pallor. Something recognizably human deteriorating. Instead, I saw a surface. 

I didn’t see a man staring back at me. 

I saw a landscape. 

My skin had dulled to a uniform grey, the color of river silt after floodwaters recede. It no longer reflected light properly; it absorbed it. Fine cracks spread across my face, my arms, my chest—precise, angular fractures that intersected and branched with impossible symmetry. They weren’t random. They weren’t injuries. 

They were diagrams. 

As I leaned closer, I recognized the shapes before I understood them: fault lines, deltas, borders traced by forgotten hands. Ancient maps etched directly into flesh. When I moved my jaw, the cracks shifted slowly, like plates realigning, resisting change but allowing it in increments. 

I touched my cheek. The skin felt dry. Cool. Wrongly solid. 

The kitchen was waiting for me when I turned away. 

Morning light filtered through the windows in a way I didn’t remember—diffused, softened, as if strained through unseen glass. The air was thick with moisture and the smell of damp soil, layered with something green and sharp. I paused in the doorway, already uneasy, already bracing for absence. 

Where my sister Elena used to sit across from me at breakfast, there was a fern. 

Large. Decorative. Thriving. 

Its fronds spilled outward in careful arcs, each leaf unblemished, vibrant, and impossibly symmetrical. The pot was heavy ceramic, glazed in a muted earth tone that matched nothing else in the room. I knew—without knowing how—that it hadn’t been there yesterday. 

Elena always sat there. Always complained about the coffee. Always pushed her chair back too hard when she stood. The space across from me had been shaped around her presence. 

Now it was shaped around roots. 

I tried to remember her face. 

 I knew I had a sister. I knew her name. Elena. The knowledge remained intact, preserved like a label on an empty drawer. But when I reached for her features, my thoughts slid sideways. My mind returned, again and again, to the fern—the serrated edges of its leaves, the way new fronds curled inward before unfurling. Those details felt important. Necessary. 

Her face refused to assemble itself. 

I sat down slowly, my knees protesting, the sand inside them grinding and settling into something denser. The chair creaked beneath me, a long, humid sound that did not belong to old wood. 

That was when the house spoke. 

“Everything is according to the garden.” 

The voice didn’t come from a person. It didn’t come from any single direction. It flowed out of the air vents, soft and constant, as if carried on recycled breath. The words weren’t spoken loudly. They didn’t need to be. They settled into the room, into my skin, into the spaces between my stiffening joints. 

I covered my ears. 

The voice continued. 

It wasn’t meant to be heard.   
It was meant to be accepted. 

I began to understand the house then—not as a structure, but as a system. The walls weren’t walls; they were panes. The windows filtered light with intention. The vents regulated temperature and moisture with careful precision. The smell of soil wasn’t an intrusion. 

It was nourishment. 

The house was no longer a shelter. 

It was a greenhouse. 

And I wasn’t trapped inside it. 

I was being cultivated. 

As I shifted in my chair, the grinding inside my knees deepened, the wet sand compressing further, learning its final shape. Above me, the vents whispered again, approving and patient. 

The Correction was ongoing. 

I was the primary specimen. 

And the garden was proceeding exactly as planned. 

Sleep was impossible. 

It wasn’t fear that kept me awake, or pain in the conventional sense. It was adhesion. If I lay still for too long, my skin began to cling to the bed sheets, not through sweat or heat, but through slow, molecular intimacy. Fibers caught on pores. Threads sank into cracks. When I shifted, the fabric resisted, reluctant to let go, as though separation required negotiation. 

Once—only once—I didn’t move quickly enough. 

The bedsheet fused to my side in a thin, continuous layer, its weave dissolving into my skin until I couldn’t tell where cloth ended and flesh began. When I tore myself free, the sound wasn’t ripping—it was peeling, wet, and patient. Beneath me, the mattress groaned, and below that, the floor responded, a deep sympathetic creak that traveled through the house like a yawn. 

I understood then that this wasn’t enchantment in the way stories describe it. 

I wasn’t cursed. 

I was being consumed. 

Not by magic, not by ritual or spell, but by something older and more honest—a biological hunger that recognized utility and moved toward it without malice. I was being ensorcelled the way soil claims a fallen tree: slowly, thoroughly, with purpose. 

My ribcage began to change on the fourth night. 

At first, it felt like pressure—my chest tightening, breath coming shallow and strange. Then the bones softened. Not melting, not breaking, but yielding, as if reminded of an earlier blueprint. My ribs curved outward, arching away from my heart in long, elegant sweeps. Each breath reshaped them further, the structure expanding into something deliberate. 

Architectural. 

I could feel it happening, each rib shifting independently, spacing itself with careful symmetry. The pain was distant, academic, overshadowed by a creeping sense of correctness. This was how I was supposed to be built. This was load bearing. This was sacred geometry. 

A cathedral didn’t need to breathe. 

It needed to hold space. 

My lungs followed next. 

They lost their spring, their easy expansion and contraction. Each inhale felt thick, damp, resistant. The tissue inside them changed texture, becoming porous, absorptive, more sponge than organ. When I tried to gasp for air, I realized with detached horror that oxygen no longer satisfied the reflex. 

The ceiling exhaled. 

Fine motes drifted downward—dust at first glance, but alive with subtle motion. Spores. Pale, drifting bodies that shimmered faintly in the filtered light. When I inhaled them, my lungs welcomed them. They lodged deep, dissolving slowly, feeding something that no longer resembled respiration. 

Breathing became an act of cultivation. 

The house adjusted accordingly. Vents whispered. Humidity rose. The air grew warm and dense, heavy with life too small to see clearly. I could feel growth happening inside me, delicate and persistent, branching outward from my ribs like scaffolding. 

I tried to write a letter. 

Not for myself. For whoever came next. For the person who would unlock the door, smell the soil, and think—briefly—that something had gone wrong. 

I needed to warn them. 

I sat at the desk, the wood beneath my arms familiar and alien at once. The pen felt wrong in my hand. Too small. Too smooth. When I tried to curl my fingers around it, they didn’t obey. 

They wouldn’t bend. 

My fingers had stiffened into long, rigid forms, joints sealed, grain rising beneath the skin. They were no longer flesh arranged around bone. They were like wood, articulated but inflexible, shaped for holding weight, not tools. 

I pressed harder. 

The pen cracked. 

Ink spilled across my palm—but it wasn’t ink anymore. It oozed thick and amber, clinging to my skin in slow threads. Sap. Warm. Fragrant. It smelled faintly of pine and damp sunlight. 

Where it touched me, it sank in. 

I stared at my hand, at the resin pooling in the grooves of my wooden fingers and understood that even language was no longer mine to use. Warnings required mouths and hands that still belonged to the same species as the listener. 

I no longer did. 

Above me, the ceiling released another breath of spores. My ribs expanded a fraction more, settling into their arches. The house creaked softly, approving. 

I lay back—not on the bed, but into it—and felt the sheets welcome me again, fibers aligning, materials agreeing. 

The greenhouse was finalizing its design. 

And I was becoming load bearing. 

I can no longer stand. 

The concept has lost meaning. There is no verticality to choose anymore, no posture to correct. My legs surrendered days ago; their purpose was reassigned. I am part of the corner now, my body angled precisely where wall meets wall, where pressure distributes itself most efficiently. My spine—once flexible, once capable of collapse and recoil—has merged seamlessly with the structural beam of the house. I can feel it, running parallel, and inseparable. Load transfers through my vertebrae into timber, into foundation, into earth. 

I am no longer occupying space. 

I am reinforcing it. 

The pain ended when resistance did. What remains is tension—constant, purposeful, like a held breath that never intends to release. My ribs no longer rise and fall. They hold. They frame. Spores drift through my chest cavity freely now, passing through the cathedral arches of bone and porous lung, settling where they are needed. 

The most terrifying part isn’t the transformation. 

It’s the silence. 

The world outside the window has gone still in a way that feels staged. No wind. No birds. The trees have stopped swaying altogether, their branches frozen mid-gesture. They aren’t resting. 

They’re watching. 

Their leaves tilt subtly toward the house, every surface oriented inward. Attention radiates from them, heavy and focused, like an audience waiting for the final note to resolve. 

The glass before me is clean, almost reverent. Through it, I see the garden. 

And my mother. 

She moves through the soil with careful steps, but her gait is wrong—stuttering, slightly delayed, as if each motion requires permission. Her arms lift and lower with visible effort, joints locking and unlocking like a puppet. She is smiling, but the expression lags behind the movement of her face. 

When she turns toward the house, toward me, I see her eyes. 

They are no longer eyes. 

They are dark, polished, oval, catching the light with a dull, organic shine. They reflect the house back at itself. They reflect me. 

She doesn’t scream. 

She doesn’t cry. 

She doesn’t hesitate. 

She picks up the watering can resting beside the porch. I recognize it. It used to hang in the garage, still smelling faintly of rust and hose water. Now it gleams with constant use. She tips it carefully, reverently, and begins to hydrate the floorboards near my feet. 

The wood drinks deeply. 

I feel it immediately—a cool seep traveling upward, soaking into the grain of my legs, my hips, the base of my spine. Roots stir in response. The beam behind me tightens, swelling slightly, integrating the moisture into its structure. 

Maintenance. 

Care. 

“You’re almost finished, Ozawa,” my mother says. 

Her voice doesn’t carry through the air. It skitters, dry and brittle, like dead leaves scraping across pavement. The sound bypasses my ears entirely and vibrates directly through the walls, through my ribs, through the column I have become. 

“The correction is almost complete,” she continues gently. “You’ll be so much more stable once you’re rooted.” 

Something in me tries to reject my name. 

Ozawa feels ornamental now. A label that once referred to something portable. Still, hearing it causes a faint internal shift, a microscopic fracture in the structure—a memory attempting to surface. 

Hands. Movement. Instability. 

The house responds instantly. 

Pressure increases along my spine. The beam thickens. My thoughts slow, weighted, sediment settling back into place. The memory dissolves before it can fully form. 

Outside, my mother waters the boards a little longer than necessary. Excess drips through the seams, darkening the soil beneath the house. The ground accepts it eagerly. 

The trees lean in. 

The silence deepens—not absence, but completion. 

I understand now why the house needed me. Why the Correction insisted. Structures like this require anchors. Something that remembers weight. Something that doesn’t move. 

I feel the last of my edges soften, the final distinctions between body and building erased with gentle precision. Sensation diffuses outward. I can feel the entire house now—the warmth near the windows, the cool damp beneath the foundation, the slow circulation of air and spores through every room. 

I am everywhere I need to be. 

Outside, the watering can empties. My mother sets it down and looks up at me one last time. Her seed-eyes gleam with approval. 

The garden is quiet. 

The house is stable. 

And I am finally, perfectly, rooted. 

The front door didn’t open. 

It didn’t swing, nor did the latch give in under force. It unsealed. Wood fibers strained, twisting subtly, pulling apart from the frame as though they remembered themselves being joined but decided, finally, to release. The grain groaned, long and deliberate, a low lament that reverberated through the foyer. Dust rose from the threshold in fine motes, motes that smelled faintly of iron and petrichor. 

The Inspector stepped inside. 

Each boot sank slightly into the new carpet of dead leaves that covered the floor, dry, brittle, and utterly deliberate. The sound was more crunch than step, a brittle percussion, sharp and unnerving. He moved slowly, measured, as though the space itself were a clock and he the only hand capable of keeping its rhythm. 

His suit was the color of wet slate, absorbing the muted light. A wide-brimmed hat cast his face into permanent shadow, but it wasn’t human darkness—it was artificial, precise, like a void manufactured to avoid recognition. There were no papers, no notes, no instruments of mundane observation. Instead, he carried a rod of polished brass, long and unnervingly straight, tipped with a crystal sharpened into a point like a fang. 

I swallowed, the cork-bark surface of my skin rasping against itself. My limbs no longer belonged to me—they belonged to angles, to planes, to the house that had rewritten me. 

“Sector 7-G,” the Inspector whispered. 

The sound didn’t pass through his throat. It didn’t enter the air in waves. It arrived in my skull directly, as friction. The hiss of stone against stone, granular and precise, scraping across my eardrums from the inside. 

“The graft is holding,” he said. “The subject is transitioning from ‘Liquid Memory’ to ‘Solid State Architecture.’” 

He advanced toward me with the calm inevitability of gravity, brass rod tapping lightly against the leaf-carpeted floor. I tried to move, just an inch, just enough to tilt away, but my legs were no longer joints and flesh—they had fused into the wainscoting. My skin, once grey silt, was now cork-like, thick and resistant, unfeeling. The floor beneath me might as well have been stone. I couldn’t register cold, only the immobility of my own body as it became wall. 

The Inspector paused and pressed the crystal tip of the rod against my shoulder—the patch where the grey silt pattern was most dense, a mesh of cracks forming shapes older than my memory. The crystal pulsed with dull amber light, faintly warming the bark on my skin but not enough to feel. 

“Acceptance levels are at ninety-two percent,” he said, tapping the brass rod against the floorboards. The vibrations traveled along my fused spine, a mechanical reassurance. “There is still a slight tremor in the pulse—a remnant of the sister-variable. It must be pruned.” 

He drew a pair of silver shears from a pocket in his slate coat. They were delicate but impossible, the blades etched with symbols that made my eyes ache to behold. He didn’t move to cut branches, vines, or roots. Instead, he leaned close to my ear. His breath smelled of ozone and ancient dust, of wood long buried beneath soil. 

“Tell me,” he hissed. “Who lived in the room at the end of the hall?” 

I wanted to answer. I wanted to scream Elena! I wanted to tell him about the soft scrape of her paintbrush, the scent of turpentine in the sunlit afternoons, the way she laughed when she made mistakes. I wanted to summon her whole, bright, human self. 

But my tongue had become something else. Heavy. Fibrous. Like thick roots, knotted and resistant to thought. 

“No… one,” I croaked. The words scraped through the passage of my throat, dragged across gravel, slow and strained. Each syllable lost a piece of its meaning in transit. 

The Inspector nodded once, satisfied. With a flick, the shears snapped through the air near my head. I felt it instantly—a sudden, cold snap deep inside my brain, a painless disconnect. It was as if a memory had been harvested at the molecular level. 

The hallway behind him responded. The door to Elena’s room, once visible and familiar, dissolved before my eyes. The wood grain shifted and smoothed. The seam closed. The room was gone. My sister, my memories of her, all traces melted into the architecture until only perfect, unbroken grain remained. 

“Correction verified,” the Inspector said, voice now distant and precise. “The garden is balanced.” 

He pivoted on his heel and exited, the door unsealing behind him with a sigh of relief, the leaves crunching faintly as though noting his absence. Silence reclaimed the house. Heavy, patient, and complete. 

I remained fused in the corner. A witness. A support. A final graft in the architecture of the home, a specimen in a garden where nothing human was allowed to persist. 

The walls settled around me, the floorboards beneath my chest inhaled the last trace of sap from my fingers, and the house exhaled—pleased, balanced, eternal. 

By the time the sun began to set, I could no longer see the room in the way humans do. 

The change wasn’t sudden. It unfolded the way dusk does—edges softening first, contrast dissolving, familiar shapes losing their authority. The walls did not disappear, but their purpose changed. Corners stopped being corners. Depth stopped meaning distance. 

My vision fractured. 

I was no longer seeing light and shadow, not surfaces or colors. I saw movement. Flow. The quiet migration of nutrients through the walls, up through beams and down through studs, carried in thin, patient streams. Moisture traced slow paths through the house’s veins. Minerals settled where they were needed. Warmth pooled and redistributed with deliberate care. 

The house revealed itself as a circulatory system. 

Pipes were arteries. Vents were lungs. Roots threaded beneath the foundation like capillaries probing soil for sustenance. And at the center of it all—where pressure converged, where rhythm was established and maintained—I felt myself. 

I was no longer simply attached. 

I was central. 

I was the heart. 

My eyes did not close when the light began to fail. There was no instinct left in me that required darkness for rest. Instead, a thin, translucent film grew over my eyes, spreading gently from the corners inward. It didn’t obscure my vision. It refined it. A protective petal, smooth and cool, sealing moisture in, filtering what no longer mattered. 

I understood without thinking: eyes like these were not meant to blink. 

They were meant to remain open. 

As the sun dipped lower, I felt a warmth bloom in my chest. It radiated outward along my ribs, through the cathedral arches of bone, into the walls themselves. The sensation was unfamiliar but immediately correct. It wasn’t love. It wasn’t fear. It carried none of the sharpness or urgency of human feeling. 

It was photosynthesis. 

The fading light seeped through glass and wall alike, absorbed not by leaves but by memory. I drank it slowly. Patiently. The images of my life—faces, voices, movement, names—rose gently within me and broke down into something simpler. Usable. Each recollection softened, dissolved, converted into growth. 

I did not mourn them. 

They were nourishment. 

With every absorbed memory, the house grew more coherent. More stable. Cracks sealed. Lines straightened. The silence deepened—not as absence, but as balance achieved. I could feel the garden outside settle into equilibrium, roots aligning, trees easing their watchfulness now that the work was complete. 

I understood then that the Correction was never about punishment. 

It was about permanence. 

I am no longer Ozawa. 

That name belonged to something mobile. Something temporary. Something that thought it was separate. 

I am the house.   
I am the soil beneath it.   
I am the slow circulation of water through wood and stone. 

I am the silence that follows the Correction—   
not empty,   
not cruel,   
but enduring. 

And I will remain,   
open-eyed,   
rooted,   
and still,   
long after the last visitor forgets there was ever a door here at all. ",1,1769490288.0,creepyfacereads,0,1.0,False

1qo4i0a,https://www.reddit.com/r/CATiim/comments/1qo4i0a/how_to_restart_studying_after_wasting_too_many/,How to restart studying after wasting too many days,"Getting back into the groove after a long break is like trying to start a car in the dead of winter—it’s going to grope and sputter at first, and that’s perfectly normal. The ""all-or-nothing"" mindset is usually what keeps people paralyzed on the couch.
Here is a low-friction strategy to get your momentum back without the burnout.

1. The ""Low Bar"" Entry

Don't try to make up for lost time all at once. If you try to study for 8 hours today, you’ll quit by hour two.

a. The 5-Minute Rule: Tell yourself you will study for just five minutes. If you want to stop after five, you can. Usually, the hardest part is just opening the book.

b. Micro-Goals: Instead of ""Study everything"" make your goal ""Read two pages"" or ""Watch one 10-minute lecture video.""

2. Audit Your Workspace

A messy desk often mirrors a messy headspace.
Clear the deck: Remove the snacks, laundry, or random items that accumulated during your ""rest"" days.

The Physical Reset: Sometimes just changing your environment—moving from your bedroom to a library or a coffee shop—signals to your brain that the ""rest period"" is officially over.

3. Use the ""Inverse To-Do List""

Instead of a daunting list of things you must do, keep a list of things you have done today.

Did you find your notebook? Write it down.

Did you check the syllabus? Write it down.

Why it works: It triggers a dopamine hit for small wins, making you want to keep going.

4. Forgive the ""Gap""

Guilt is a productivity killer. If you spend your study time beating yourself up for resting too long, you aren't actually studying.

The Truth: You can't change the days you missed. Accept them as a ""system reboot"" and move on. You aren't starting from scratch; you're starting from experience.

Suggested Jumpstart Schedule

If you’re feeling overwhelmed right now, try this 2-hour ""Soft Launch"":

Phase 1: The 15-Minute Triage

Spend the first 15 minutes just organizing the ""chaos."" Identify the three most urgent tasks or topics. Ignore everything else for now. If you try to look at the whole mountain, you'll stay at the bottom. Pick three stones and focus on those.

Phase 2: The 30-Minute Sprint

Set a timer for 30 minutes. Your only job is to engage with one of those three tasks. Don't worry about ""mastering"" it yet—just read, take notes, or solve a few problems. Put your phone in another room or on ""Do Not Disturb"" to protect this window.

Phase 3: The 15-Minute Reset

Once the timer goes off, physically leave your desk. This is the most important part. Get a glass of water, stretch, or step outside. Avoid ""screen breaks"" (like TikTok or Instagram) because they hijack your focus and make it much harder to return to a flow state.

Phase 4: The 1 hour  Wrap-Up

Spend the final 1 hour on ""Active Recall."" Instead of just reading, try to explain what you just studied out loud to an invisible student, or write down the key concepts from memory. This proves to your brain that you’re actually making progress, which builds the confidence you need to study again tomorrow.

Remember 👇

One good day can restart everything

We were sexting within 10 minutes. It only escalated from there over the last 5 months. Nothing in person but a lot of texts, pics, sexting, and venting about life. I like it, it’s easy. It’s like being in High School again. We each have our own lives and this is just an outlet. I have no intention of meeting this guy, and it has been fizzling. I’m just going to let it die at this point.  

My husband, Ted, is a good guy, but all the spark is gone after 12 years. Everything seems so routine. I could probably write down exactly how the next 3 months are going to go and be 99% right barring some unforeseen accident. There will be nights in front of the TV we don’t even watch because we're on our phones.

Our sex life is always the same: He kisses on my neck and chest, he slides his hand down between my legs, gets on top of me, I get on top of him, get mine, he gets back on top, gets his. Lather, rinse, repeat.  

He reminded me that we need to plan out our usual cruise vacation. That got me thinking. Why go on the budget cruise we usually go on? There’s families, with annoying kids, and he always ditches me to go to the casino 2 or 3 nights anyway. I got on and did some searching and came across “The 7 Deadly.” It’s 21 and up only, and is like an adult paradise. This ship is new and a bit pricey, but I don’t care, we can afford it. 

I told my husband the next day that I wanted to do something different for our vacation this year, then showed him the ad. Neon lights, champagne fountains, dancing by the pools, half dressed men and women. 7 zones themed like the 7 deadly sins. No kids, no silly characters, no rules, no responsibilities. I asked what he thought and the first thing he said was, “They have prostitutes and MMA fights onboard? Sign me up.” His joking laugh that followed was annoying, but I smiled anyway. Then he followed up, “You really want to go on a thing like that, it’s probably full of swingers and drunk nepo babies?”   
  
“Yeah I do, I want to do something different, and want to go on a vacation and not hear one crying child the entire week we are there.”  
  
He shrugged, “Why not, looks fun.” Then I told him I wanted to go soon, next month soon. He agreed to that too. Suddenly, I was chasing a spark once again, just he didn’t know I wasn’t chasing it with him.

Here they have onsen which you can go for free and a pretty nice lounge with free coffee, tea, snacks. People really seem to enjoy and has a great vibe since it's more relaxed. Today I just popped in got two coffee and went to my room instead of doing shitty Nespresso. There were other people kinda just chilling, probably waiting for family at the lounge but at a more leisurely pace than just the lobby where they generally provide nothing. 

Or I went to the Onsen at 10 pm yesterday and there were a lot of people using it for a nice bath before going to bed.  

Then it hit me how shitty every Aman,4S, Ritz are. They all cost 5x more for a standard room and they nickel and dime you for everything. Wanna just go sit in hot water at the spa, pay 200 bucks. Wanna sit down for a coffee while you wait for friends to come down another 30 bucks. Basically every turn is an opportunity to nickel and dime which makes for a worse experience. If they are already charging you 2K bucks a night they can provide free coffee but they choose not to, or instead of having a 4th overpriced mid restaurant, they could do a lounge with snacks for free, where you can just chill. 

The larger the brand grows, the more they focus on extracting more money instead of focusing on providing a better experience.

Regardless of the cost, all of this adds a mental cost to the experience . Kinda like simply logging in to see an article its and extra step that is annoying. Point being they make everything more annoying to extract an extra 3% from guests leading to worse experience. ",29,1769489698.0,FATTravel,5,0.95,False

I absolutely love North County. I am female

And just turned 36, but I think I look young and pretty fine tbh 😩

I specifically live in Carlsbad. The vibe is chill, I love the people I talk to and so there are so many places to explore. Sooo the problem here is me, I think. Obviously, but let me explain…

When I first moved to Carlsbad one year ago, I had so much hope and desire to make friends and me people and really feel like it was home. Fast forward one year, I feel honestly so lonely and I don’t know what to do. I don’t have any connection besides family here and which I am blessed for them!

I know most of the basic things of what to do and I don’t need that advice. Just wish I had a girlfriend or two to call up to go get coffee or go to the bars I feel so scared and anxious to alone to any the bars but I want to be one of those people with friends enjoying their time. I but I know there’s so many fun things to do here and I feel like I am missing out.

I’m not an ugly girl and I’m not socially too weird at all and I don’t wanna leave Carlsbad in North County but I can’t continue to feel like this. Go find anything that would change my mind? I’m not convinced someone to read back to Orange County, but if I can’t find another way of living here that I may have to. LOL. Girl stuff.

I’m not looking for anything serious I nand I value alone time. i’m not looking for serious friendship off the bat or anything just a casual let’s get a drink let’s grab coffee even just shit call me. I feel like some days I go without talking to human beings besides someone that works at a store that has to talk to me… It makes me honestly sad.

I can’t believe I’m saying this all and if you’ve read this far thank you so much for taking the time to read that Long sad wow it’s me type situation but it’s how I’m feeling. I have to validate my feelings it’s not that I don’t love myself it’s not that I can spend no time alone it’s not that I don’t have connections I mean it is but I just want connections and friends.

Help! Any feedback beyond being mean is appreciated. Thanks in advance :)

Please reframe from being mean, I am honestly like a delicate flower right now hah.

Thanks all!!

I’m 28, living in Philadelphia, and I never really pictured myself posting on a sub like this, but here we are. After a long stretch of bad dating apps and even worse small talk, I’m officially tired of surface level conversations and figured I’d try something different.

Lately, I’ve realized I mostly just miss having someone consistent to talk to. Someone to text during the day, send memes to, talk about random things, or decompress about work and life. Life is good overall, but it’s been feeling a little repetitive lately, and I’d love to shake things up by meeting someone new.

A little about me…I work in corporate and really enjoy what I do. I’m creative, and usually juggling a few projects at once. Outside of work, I love yoga, reading on my Kindle, reality TV (yes, I will defend Real Housewives), evening walks, good coffee, trying new recipes, and just finding small ways to romanticize everyday life. 

I really value my relationships with people, and because of that, I tend to keep a small handful of very close, meaningful connections in my life. I care a lot about personal growth and try to be thoughtful and intentional in how I show up for the people I care about.

Personality-wise, I’m down to earth, loyal, supportive, and sarcastic in a fun way. I’m a good listener, pretty self-aware, and I value honesty and consistency. I’m not looking for anything weird or NSFW. I’m just hoping to meet someone kind, emotionally intelligent, and able to hold a real conversation.

I’m open to talking to anyone, anywhere, in roughly the 28 to 33 age range.

If you’re someone who enjoys good conversation and is open to seeing where things go, I’d love to hear from you.

1qo4aar,https://i.redd.it/9876pdu7otfg1.png,"Claimed, Hunted: Ruthless Alpha's Runaway Mate","The Advanced Botany Lab Kaius Blackthorne understood how the world worked. The strong survived. The weak got crushed. Alphas didn't ask—they took. That wasn't philosophy. That was biology. His biology. Every sense he possessed was a weapon—he could pick up a stuttering pulse three rooms away, taste deceit in the air before words were spoken. Fear had a smell. So did lust. So did lying. But this girl? She was static on his radar. He'd been watching her for almost a week, lurking in the back of this swampy-ass greenhouse. Carolina Ravencrest. She didn't smell like anything. Just bleach and dollar-store shampoo. Like someone had scrubbed her existence clean. She was a glitch in his system, a dead pixel in perfect resolution. It pissed him off. It pulled him in. Right then, her hands were shaking. ""Easy,"" he said, moving in behind her. She went rigid. He felt the heat pouring off her skin—way too hot for human, way too wild for shifter. ""I'm good,"" she muttered, clutching that scalpel like her life depended on it. She wasn't good. She was one wrong move from bolting. And for the first time in his life, Kaius didn't want to corner her—he wanted to calm her down. Then she fucked up. Her hand slipped. The blade opened her palm clean. Slice. Blood bloomed fast—bright red, too much of it. Kaius grabbed her wrist before his brain caught up. He yanked her hand toward him. ""Give it here,"" he growled. He was ready for copper. That flat, metallic bite of human blood. What hit him instead damn near knocked him on his ass. It wasn't iron. It was sweet. Like wildflowers buried under snow. Like something so old, so pure, that Maddox, his wolf, dropped flat in his head. Kaius stared at the gash in her palm. The skin didn't scab. It moved. The torn edges crawled toward each other, sealed up in seconds, left nothing but smooth, flawless skin that glowed faint silver in the dim light. He looked up. Carolina was staring back at him, eyes blown wide, full-blown panic mode. She ripped her hand out of his grip, shoved it behind her back. ""It's nothing,"" she stammered. Her voice cracked. ""I just—heal quick. Good genes, I guess."" Kaius tilted his head. Studied her. The chemicals weren't an accident. The shaking wasn't nerves. She wasn't some scared little scholarship girl. She was something else. Something lethal. Something he had no name for. He stepped forward. Backed her right up against the potting bench. Leaned in close enough that his breath stirred her hair, close enough to drown in that impossible scent of storm and honey. ""You don't fool me, Carolina."" he whispered, his voice rough and low. ""Not even a little. And I'm not stopping until I know what the hell you really are."" Chapter 1 The air in Carolina's cramped studio didn't carry the usual morning smells—no coffee brewing, no rain on pavement. Just sulfur, crushed wolfsbane, and the sharp chemical bite of suppressants strong enough to kill. Carolina Ravencrest sat on the edge of her mattress, white-knuckling the sheets. A bead of cold sweat rolled down her spine. Despite the muggy late-September heat, she was shaking. Inside her chest, something thrashed. 'I'm suffocating in here.' The voice didn't speak—it pulsed through her bones. 'Last night's moon was full. Every part of me hurts. I need out.' ""Not happening, Nyx,"" Carolina rasped, voice scratchy from sleep. ""You know the rules. We don't shift. Not here. Not anywhere."" She hauled herself upright. Her legs shook. To everyone else on campus, Carolina Ravencrest was nobody—some scholarship kid with perpetual dark circles, a hoodie collection, and zero personality. The kind of girl you'd sit next to in lecture and forget existed before the professor even started talking. But under the skin, behind the plain brown eyes, something ancient prowled. Carolina dragged herself to the kitchenette. Her bare feet made no sound on the peeling linoleum. She reached for the amber vial on the counter—last of this month's batch. She'd brewed it three nights ago under blackout curtains, mixing herbs that would kill a human outright and cripple a regular shifter. For her? Just another chain. She twisted the cap off. The smell alone made her eyes burn. 'Poison,' Nyx snarled in her skull. 'You're killing us to hide from mutts.' ""We do this or we die,"" Carolina fired back in her head. ""You saw what they did to Mom. You know what happens when they find us."" The memory slammed into her—snow painted red, Alphas circling like vultures, the sick thrill of being hunted not for food but for power. White Wolf was a living battery for the Moon Goddess's magic—capable of healing the unhealable, making a pack unstoppable. To be found was to get collared. Carolina tipped her head back and downed it. Agony. Like chugging fire and glass shards. She choked, white-knuckling the sink as the suppressant tore through her veins. It chased Nyx down, locked her in chains of frozen magic, and snuffed out the gold light that usually ran under Carolina's skin. Everything went dull. Dead. She gagged into the sink, waiting for her stomach to settle. When she finally dragged her eyes to the cracked mirror, the girl staring back looked like a corpse. Skin grey. Eyes flat. And her scent—wildflowers, lightning, old magic—gone. Now she just smelled empty. Like soap and nothing. Human. ""Perfect,"" she muttered, wiping her mouth. She glanced at the microwave clock. 8:15 AM. ""Shit."" She was about to miss the one thing she couldn't blow off. The Dean had sent three emails—attendance mandatory, no exceptions. Scholarship kids who skipped the ""Grand Assembly"" got put on probation. Apparently some rich alum was showing up to throw money at the bioengineering department. Carolina didn't give a damn about rich people. She just wanted to keep her head down, finish her Botany degree, and disappear into the woods where no one would ever look for her. She dressed fast—baggy jeans that hid her legs, oversized grey sweater that drowned her frame. Twisted her hair into a knot, yanked a few pieces loose to cover her face. Bag. Keys. Lock. She stepped into the hall and the city slammed into her senses. To a human, it was just morning smells. To her—even muzzled—it was chaos. Bacon from 3B. Rot in the elevator. A tomcat three blocks over marking his spot. She kept her head down and walked fast. The autumn air bit at her face, sharp and cold. The kind of day wolves lived for. Nyx prowled in the back of her mind, pissed but caged. 'Something's wrong,' Nyx said suddenly. Carolina stopped at the crosswalk. ""What are you talking about?"" 'The air. It's too thick. Feels like right before a storm hits.' ""It's fall. Relax."" But when Carolina stepped onto the campus—all green lawns and old brick—she felt it too. Static everywhere. Hair standing up on her arms. Pressure building. Not the weather. Something else. Raw, fucking wild energy. Wolves. Chapter 2 Yeah, there were always wolves around. Shifters lived mixed in with humans—usually the ones running things, hiding behind suits and smiles. Most of the time, their presence was subtle. Polite, even. This wasn't that. This felt like standing too close to a black hole. Students flooded toward the Great Hall—massive stone building, vaulted ceilings, the whole gothic deal. The chatter was louder than usual, buzzing with energy. ""I heard he's loaded,"" some girl ahead of Carolina said to her friend. ""Like, buy-an-island loaded."" ""I heard he's single,"" her friend said, grinning. ""And looking."" ""Yeah, right,"" the first one snorted. ""Guys like Kaius Blackthorne don't look. They pick."" Kaius Blackthorne. Carolina's stomach dropped. She knew that name. Shadow Sovereigns. Biggest, nastiest pack on the East Coast. They didn't negotiate—they dominated. In boardrooms. In territory disputes. Everywhere. And their Alpha was here? Every instinct she had screamed at her to bolt. An Alpha that powerful would have senses sharp enough to cut through steel. If her suppressant had even one weak spot, he'd know. 'We're stronger than him,' Nyx said, voice dripping with pride. 'Let him figure it out. Let him kneel.' ""You trying to get us killed?"" Carolina whispered under her breath. She slipped into the crowd, using a trio of football players as cover. Just disappear, she told herself. You're invisible. You're nobody. The Great Hall was packed wall-to-wall. Thousands of students crammed into velvet seats. The noise was overwhelming. Carolina found a spot in the very last row, tucked under the balcony overhang near the exit. She pulled out a textbook and pretended to read, pulse hammering in her throat. The lights dropped. Dean Sterling, round guy who always smelled like nerves and cheap cigars, shuffled up to the podium. The mic squealed. Everyone shut up. ""Students. Faculty,"" he started, voice shaking slightly. ""It is my immense honor... truly, my privilege... to introduce a man who requires no introduction. A titan. A visionary. And our most generous supporter."" The heavy curtains at the back of the stage pulled apart. The air disappeared. Not a metaphor. For Carolina, it felt like someone vacuumed the oxygen out of the room and replaced it with lead. Alpha Command rolled off him in waves, crashing over the crowd like a physical force. The humans just felt uneasy—some primal part of their brains telling them to sit still and shut up. For Carolina? It was a punch to the chest. She white-knuckled the armrests. She forced herself to breathe, forced her eyes up to the stage. Kaius Blackthorne walked out. Holy shit, he was huge—easily six-five, maybe taller. Charcoal suit clinging to every muscle, like it had been stitched to his skin. Every step was measured, slow, like a predator circling, sniffing out the weak spot. He wasn't walking—he was hunting. His hair was jet black, slicked back so sharply it looked like it could cut someone. Face all angles and lines, like stone carved by a mad sculptor. Not pretty, but fuck… mesmerizing. And the eyes... Even from the back row, Carolina could see them. Gunmetal grey. Cold. Ruthless. He didn't grin, didn't nod, didn't give a damn wave. Just strode to the podium, planted his hands on the wood, and scanned the room. Dead silence. ""Thanks for the warm welcome, Dean,"" he said. His voice was low, rough. Didn't need to be loud—it cut through the room anyway. Didn't have to yell—everyone froze anyway. ""I'm not here to yammer about dreams. I'm here to make it happen."" His eyes started scanning the crowd. He wasn't looking at people. He was hunting. Carolina saw his nostrils flare. He was checking for threats. Other wolves. Mapping his territory. 'He's dangerous,' Nyx murmured, sounding almost impressed. 'A real King.' ""Just shut the hell up,"" Carolina thought desperately. She pictured a wall around herself. Imagined herself as stone. Empty air. Nothing. I don't exist. Kaius's gaze swept the front rows. Dismissive. Moved through the middle section. Bored. Then his head tilted up. He toward the balcony. Toward the very back. Carolina's breath caught. She sank lower in her seat, hiding behind the guy in front of her. Please, don't see me. Don't even look my way. is hands slammed onto the podium, hard. The wood groaned, splintering. A sharp crack shot through the mic like a fucking gun going off. The crowd gasped. He didn't seem to hear them. His grey eyes locked onto the shadows at the back, sharp and focused. He leaned forward, breathing in deep, confusion flickering across his face. He looked lost. For an Alpha like him, the world was a scent map. He could track fear, lust, sickness, deception. He could ID every shifter in a ten-mile radius. But when his eyes hit that back corner, he found nothing. Carolina felt him, like his gaze was crawling over her skin. Hot. Dangerous. Possessive. She risked peeking through her lashes. He was looking. Right at her. The world slowed. All the bodies, the chatter, the movement—it all evaporated. Just him. Just her. Hunter. Prey. His eyes pinched down. Somewhere in the corner of that grey hoodie, hunched and invisible, was some girl. He should be picking up cues—her scent, her heartbeat, the way her shoulders trembled. Nothing. Just air. Empty, still. Then something shifted in his face. Interest. Obsession. Want. He kept talking, voice dropping lower, rougher. But he didn't look away. Eyes locked on her corner like a laser sight, speaking to the room but aiming every word at her. ""Sometimes we miss what's right in front of us,"" Kaius said, slow and deliberate. ""We think power has to announce itself. But the real dangerous thing? That's the stuff trying to stay invisible."" Carolina's heart skipped. No, it stopped. He knew. He knew she was carrying secrets. Her bag felt suddenly heavy in her hands. Panic knotted her chest, crawling up her throat. She couldn't sit here. One slip. One fraction of a second letting her guard drop under the weight of his presence… and he'd see. Wolf. White Wolf. Game over. She had to run. Now. The second applause broke out, Carolina bolted. Legs pumping, backpacks and chairs flying out of her way, completely ignoring the annoyed yells behind her. She hit the aisle, barreling straight for the oak doors. She burst outside into cold air, gasping, hands shaking. 'He saw us,' Nyx whispered, thrilled. ""He didn't see us. He saw a puzzle,"" Carolina shot back, walking fast toward the library. ""And guys like that tear puzzles apart to see how they work."" She thought she'd gotten away. Thought she could duck into the stacks, bury herself in books until he flew back to wherever the hell he came from. She was wrong.",1,1769489482.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

The blurb:

A 14-year-old shoemaker from a remote village gets an extraordinary scholarship to a prestigious university. But he's carrying a forbidden book: his grandfather's manifesto that could bring the university down. The story is set in an African dystopian world where books are banned and an underground movement seeks to break the system.

There is a [sample chapter here](https://ire-muthomi.vercel.app/), but heads up: it's designed to be an interactive experience. Also it's kinda dark and brooding but it fits the story. Hope you like it 😊

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

Just looking for some outside perspective because I think I might be overthinking this.

I’m 22M and have been single my whole life. Recently, a woman I met at work (I work at a gas station — she’s a customer) gave me her number. We’ve chatted a few times before, nothing deep, just friendly conversations.

But this time our conversation was bit long, and she shared about her life… she looked very interested and happy while i was listening her carefully. Later she was like “you can have my number.” I did not asked her at all.

She took my phone, typed her number in, accidentally called herself and hung up, then said sorry and told me she’d text me later. She did text that night and said:

“Hey, thank you again — we should do a coffee and catch up.”

I replied something simple like:

“Sure, let me know what day works for you.”

She said i will let you know. 

She later asked how my night was. I replied normally, said it was chill and asked how hers was.

That was yesterday afternoon, and I haven’t heard back since.

For context, she’s a single mom with a young baby, so I know she probably has a lot going on. I’m not expecting instant replies or anything, but I can’t help wondering if I said something boring or if I should’ve handled it differently.

I’m not trying to rush anything or pressure her — just wondering:

	•	Is this normal and I should just wait?

	•	Or does this usually mean low interest?

	•	Should I send one follow-up later or just leave it alone?

1qo3vis,https://www.reddit.com/r/SilverSpring/comments/1qo3vis/is_dtss_still_worth_moving_to/,Is DTSS Still Worth Moving To?,"Hi all,

I moved to Maryland about a year and a half ago and currently live in the Wheaton area. For context: I work in DC and take the red line in 2-3 days a week. I’m mostly a homebody, but lately I’ve started getting out and exploring more—beyond just commuting for work. I picked Wheaton mainly for the spaciousness and the huge perk of not paying for parking. Now, though, I’m finding myself wanting to live closer to the ""action""—not so much nightlife (clubbing/lounges/parties), but walkable access to everyday amenities like restaurants, gyms, grocery stores, coffee shops, and similar spots.

My initial priorities were safety, cleanliness, proximity to the Metro, off-street parking, and in-unit laundry. Those all still matter, but now being closer to walkable conveniences is feeling more important as I get accustomed to living alone and exploring the area.

Wheaton isn’t boring, but most businesses aren’t a short walk (under 10 minutes), so I’m starting to reconsider Downtown Silver Spring (DTSS). My hesitation comes from hearing (and seeing) a lot of mixed opinions, which I will probably find more of in the comments:

* Some say Silver Spring “isn’t what it used to be” since Discovery left and that there’s an uneasy feeling walking around at night near Colesville and Georgia.
* I’ve noticed recurring complaints about expensive and less-secure parking (upwards of $120/month)—though maybe that’s a building-specific issue?
* There’s also a lot of chatter about declining “value,” but plenty of folks still live there and seem to enjoy it.

**Just to clarify, I’m not looking for apartment or building suggestions specifically—there are plenty of posts on that already. What I’m curious about is the overall experience of living in DTSS long-term or even just over a 12-month lease. Outside of convenience, is it a place people truly enjoy living? Or is it somewhere folks only stay because of proximity to work and transportation?**

I’m not into clubs or lounge nightlife, but I do enjoy dining out in the evenings, grabbing a drink for trivia, or taking part in casual neighborhood events. So if you live (or have lived) in DTSS:

* Are the concerns about safety at night, high parking costs, and “falling value” widespread, or just limited to certain buildings or streets?
* Are there neighborhoods within DTSS that offer a better overall experience and still give easy access to the Metro and walkable amenities?
* What’s your take on living there day-to-day: do you actually enjoy being out and about in Silver Spring, or does it feel like a place people put up with for the sake of convenience?
* Would you honestly recommend someone move to Silver Spring if they’re looking for enjoyability as well as practicality?

Just hoping to hear some genuine, firsthand perspectives—especially on what it’s like to actually live there and whether the negative rumors are justified or overblown.

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1qo3pz1,https://www.reddit.com/r/roommateproblems/comments/1qo3pz1/regretting_roommate_choice_but_might_be_stuck/,"regretting roommate choice, but might be stuck","so I (early-20's m) moved in with a friend (mid-30's m) a few months back, and it's starting to go downhill. initially, he said he was super diligent about cleaning, and I was honest and said I'm a bit messy, but would keep the chaos to my room, and make sure to clean up in common areas. fast forward, and it seems like there may have been some half-truths. sure, he keeps the kitchen clean, does dishes, takes out the trash, but the living room.. is a problem area. 

tldr: roommate has turned the living room into a messy second bedroom, keeps sleeping there despite having conversations about it, and I'm at a loss because I don't want to resent/hate my friend

the living room is kind of central in the apartment, it's the main entry and you have to go through it to get to the kitchen, and to the bedrooms/bathroom. it has also become his second bedroom. we have two couches, two coffee tables, and two TVs because neither of us wanted to toss our things, and his couch is where he exists most of the time. he eats there, watches TV and is on his phone the whole day, and usually ends up sleeping there, too. he gets home from work super late, so the whole being in the living room after midnight isn't such a huge deal, I'm usually asleep anyways. he also bluetooth connects his headphones to the TV, which genuinely helps a lot. but when I get up in the morning to feed my cat, make breakfast, or head out to work, or just want to chill on the couch, there's a good chance I'll find him passed out, snoring away.  even when he got sick, he just stayed camped out there, snoozing and sneezing and coughing all day and night (which is actually happening again right now, we're both a little sick)

and that's not even mentioning the pile of.. random stuff he leaves on the coffee table. he even fashioned himself a little trash can out of a gift bag. thankfully, the mess doesn't extend to my couch or table, but it's still uncomfy even when he's out to try and use my couch when there's a tornado right next to it. like, cushions and pillows and blankets all over the place, some kind of page scanner device, medication bottles, flossers, journals, empty containers, water bottles, just a bunch of random shit that probably would normally be on like a bedside table?

I've tried to figure out why it kept happening, met with various things. partially, it's because he smokes/vapes weed a lot (like A Lot, idk when the dude isn't at least a little stoned) and just ends up getting too high and falling asleep. another is that his room is too cold, which I tried to solve by getting him an ac cover, then letting him borrow my space heater I wasn't using, and now I've bought him a hopefully better heater. I'll wake him up sometimes cause he's got sleep apnea and the hella loud snoring turns into choking/coughing, he has a CPAP machine in his room, and I keep suggesting he maybe starts using it. he starts to properly use his room for a bit, but then just goes back to old habits. I was super hopeful one day when I'd invited a mutual friend to hang out, was stressed about having to host in a messy living room, but then came home to a completely cleaned up living room. I sent him a message thanking him for cleaning, it stayed nice for a few days, then back to living on the couch.

I know I'm to blame for letting it go on for so long, I'm working on my conflict-avoidant self, but clearly not doing great. in my list of excuses are that it's the first time I've lived with another person in about 5 years, I'm super anxious, and autistic. handling people is not a skill I have. especially trying to interact with someone who's not sober. it seemed to be hitting a certain point, he's acknowledging that he's gotta cut back on smoking, needs to sleep in his room, knows that his snoring bothers me, I thought we had a super productive conversation. but right now, he's been parked on the couch all day testing out ketamine for the first time.

I am going to have a real sit down talk with him about things. he's overall a nice guy, considerate about inviting over guests, we share a lot of friends, he looks after my cat when I'm gone. for that and also that I pay way less in rent than if I were to live alone, I'd like to keep living with him. and I know I'm also not the best roommate, I need to be better about deep cleaning, I'm usually holed up in my room and don't hang out with him very much, but it's been hard to do that given that I'm currently so unhappy with the current state of things. I'm nailing down the script with a friend, but if there's any other advice from people who have dealt with something similar (or needing to really go in on me for being a wimp), it would be appreciated ",1,1769487871.0,roommateproblems,2,1.0,False
