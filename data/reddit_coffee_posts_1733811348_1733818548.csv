","While I was petsitting in someone else's home, I left a book on a coffee table and left for about 2 hours. When I came back, the cover was completely destroyed by the dog and I had to replace it. The dog owner said, that the dog never does it and said she will pay for the book (I got a lot of instruction about the dog's behaviour, as well as I knew her pretty well already). I noticed some other posts here suggest that this is not something the dog owner is responsible for, and the dog sitter should not ask to cover the damage.

So should I just move on from this because this is my fault that I left that book in a place where the dog could reach it? Or mention the price of the book to the dog owner so that she can pay for it?",1,1733817795.0,RoverPetSitting,1,1.0,False

The vendor itself is providing a breakfast buffet: fruit, scrambled eggs, breakfast potatoes, pancakes and bacon.

We have a two vegetarians, three gluten-free and at least one nut allergy so I was planning on adding a GF/Nut-free charcuterie board, a couple dozen assorted mini donuts and a crepe cart. My groom has happy memories of crepes with his family and they can accommodate gluten allergies. 

It's 40 people in total. No fees for outside vendors.

Oh and they have coffee, juice, and mimosas. (Vendor included)

The additional food options would be about $700 which is in budget.

Gotta say, the fillings were top notch, and the baguette was yoza too. If I had to be picky, the crispy pork was on the salty side (coming from someone who likes salt), and I would have preferred a bit more coriander.

1hawrtd,https://www.reddit.com/r/paloalto/comments/1hawrtd/i_asked_chatgpt_to_roast_palo_alto/,I asked Chatgpt to roast Palo Alto,"Roasting Palo Alto, California? Alright, let's have some fun with this!

Tech Overload: Palo Alto is so tech-obsessed, you‚Äôre more likely to find a robot than an actual person at a coffee shop. The ""smart home"" here is so advanced that it probably knows your next thought before you do.

The Traffic: How is it that you‚Äôre stuck in traffic while driving a $100k Tesla? Seems like the only thing moving fast here is the stock price of your startup.

The Real Estate Prices: If you need a loan to buy a home, just apply for a loan on the moon. That way, you‚Äôll be in good company with your multi-million dollar home that has a single bathroom and a ""luxury"" view of the neighbor‚Äôs hedge.

Stereotype Central: At Palo Alto dinner parties, you‚Äôre more likely to hear startup pitches than actual conversations. ""So, what does your company do?"" is the icebreaker, and ""I just invested in another AI-powered cactus"" is the punchline.

Yoga, but Make It Elite: If you're not doing downward dog while listening to a podcast about entrepreneurship, are you even living in Palo Alto? I bet the stretch mats cost more than most people‚Äôs rent.

Biking Around: Sure, Palo Alto is ""bike-friendly"" ‚Äì if by friendly, you mean navigating your $5,000 e-bike through a parade of other $5,000 e-bikes, all while avoiding those pesky pedestrians who can‚Äôt afford the latest cycling gear.

Food Scene: The dining scene is so healthy and organic, you‚Äôll feel like a failure if your kale isn‚Äôt locally sourced from the farm next door. If you mention a chain restaurant, prepare for the looks of horror and a 10-minute discussion on the virtues of quinoa.

All in good fun, of course! Palo Alto is a place full of innovation, but it‚Äôs not exactly a place for the ""average"" person‚Äôs lifestyle. You definitely have to be comfortable with the concept of ""Silicon Valley extravagance.""


You said:

do better than that
ChatGPT said:

Alright, you want me to go deeper? Let's roast Palo Alto with some more sharp edges!

The ""Tech Utopia"" Where Reality Doesn‚Äôt Exist: In Palo Alto, the only thing more inflated than your startup‚Äôs valuation is your ego. You can spot the locals by the thick layer of self-importance they wear like a cologne. They talk about ‚Äúdisrupting‚Äù industries like they invented the word, yet most of them couldn‚Äôt even disrupt a Wi-Fi connection on their own.

Tesla Everywhere, Parking Nowhere: How does Palo Alto manage to have more Teslas than actual parking spaces? People in their $100,000 electric cars sit in traffic while bragging about how green they are, all while burning through enough electricity to power a small country. The only thing more ‚Äúsustainable‚Äù than their cars is their ability to make you feel like a financial peasant just for existing.

The Land of Overpriced Bungalows: Want to own a home in Palo Alto? Better start selling organs, because at this point, the only thing affordable in this town is the cardboard box you'd need to live in after the mortgage payment kicks in. You could buy a mansion in the middle of the country for what you‚Äôre paying for a 3-bedroom that was built in 1920 with a bathroom so small you have to step into the hallway just to brush your teeth.

Startups So Overhyped They Make IPOs Look Like Small Talk: Palo Alto is where ‚Äúdreams‚Äù go to get funded‚Äîand then quickly crash and burn. Here, everyone‚Äôs a CEO of something, and no one has time for you unless you can pitch them a billion-dollar idea in 30 seconds. If you‚Äôre not talking about the next unicorn startup or using terms like ""synergy,"" they‚Äôll stop listening and start swiping through LinkedIn to see if you‚Äôre worth their time.

‚ÄúNatural‚Äù Vibes, But Still a $300 Juice: Oh, you're into ""sustainable"" living? In Palo Alto, that‚Äôs code for paying $12 for a ‚Äúfree-range‚Äù kombucha made with ingredients you can‚Äôt pronounce. You‚Äôll never be able to tell if the yoga studio is more about zen or flexing the size of your wellness subscription portfolio. It‚Äôs a place where organic is not just about food, it‚Äôs a lifestyle... because you can‚Äôt call yourself healthy unless your matcha latte costs as much as your monthly phone bill.

The Traffic Dilemma: Welcome to a place where the only thing moving faster than your self-driving car is your anxiety about being late for your 10 AM meeting. The traffic here is so bad that Elon Musk probably has a patent for teleportation in the works just to deal with it. And no, you can't take a break and walk to your destination; everyone is too busy driving in a circle around their overpriced neighborhood looking for a parking spot.

Social Life? It‚Äôs Just Networking With Fancier Clothes: Hanging out in Palo Alto? You‚Äôre more likely to find a ""networking opportunity"" than an actual friend. It‚Äôs the kind of town where you‚Äôll meet people who invite you to lunch just to ""pick your brain"" ‚Äî but they won‚Äôt pay for their own sandwich. You‚Äôll spend more time explaining your startup‚Äôs exit strategy than enjoying your kale salad.

Kid Genius Central: If your 6-year-old isn‚Äôt coding by the age of 4 and speaking Mandarin by 5, you‚Äôre already behind. At school drop-off, you‚Äôll see kids solving algorithms before they even learn to tie their shoes. Meanwhile, you‚Äôre just trying to remember whether you‚Äôve fed your own child yet, while silently questioning your entire existence as a parent.

Palo Alto isn‚Äôt just a place, it‚Äôs a lifestyle‚Äîa lifestyle that says, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm better than you, but I‚Äôll still have a latte with you, if you can afford it.‚Äù",0,1733816992.0,paloalto,0,0.5,False

I moved towards Harold‚Äôs daughter and draped my coat around her. ‚ÄúShe can‚Äôt walk.‚Äù I saw the deep bruising, the bewildered fluttering of her eyelids, the places the demon had branded her flesh.

I lifted the girl, totally unsure whether she would die from a fever‚Äîwith her slung over my shoulder, I could smell infection‚Äîand went from the garden, Aggie calling after me. And I could hear it all as I met the street and crossed it and reentered the ruins.

Although arduous with the squalling, quivering body of the girl, I moved as quickly as I could. ‚ÄúShh,‚Äù I told her and myself, ‚ÄúShh.‚Äù Perhaps I was shaking too.

I heard the protests of Aggie, first she asked for me, then there was nothing but the siren call of the betrayed, the shrieks, the howls in response to Baphomet‚Äôs tortures. There would be water again on the compound. I moved away and readjusted the girl on my shoulder before I stumbled over my own boots. We fell hard on my knees, but I kept her in my arms and muffled a cry. An old prayer whispered from my lips, and I pushed myself to my feet before going on.

There was no lying to myself of what I‚Äôd done. What I‚Äôd done too many times. It never was easier. Never. Nothing like youthful fresh flesh placates a demon. It‚Äôs a deal that I‚Äôd made before and a deal I was certain I‚Äôd make again. There were no heroes or beauty in the world. No wonderful overcoming or examinations of the indomitable human spirit.

The girl‚Äôs pained expressions dampened to mere whimpers alongside flashes of weak, flailing hysteria; her infection was bad, and I was glad for her continued pain, because it meant she was alive. Once I‚Äôd found a place, perhaps a mile out from the garden, deep in the buildings of the tall ruins, I deposited her on the sidewalk then looked over her. She looked thin, famished (soul famished), and her eyes could not hold a concentrated gaze. Only after surveying the surrounding area, I withdrew my water gourd and put it to her lips slowly, being sure as to not drown her with its contents‚Äîher eyes shut and she supped at the mouth of the dead gourd, not even having the energy to hold it with her hands. I examined her deep cuts; a few scabby places around her wounds demonstrated healing, but others looked too deep and I imagined that‚Äôs where the infection was.

My voice whispered, ‚ÄúThese are antibiotics. Please swallow them. Even if you need to chew them, take them.‚Äù Unsure if my words had registers, I pushed the pills to her lips and her closed eyes contorted funny before I slotted the medicine past her teeth and offered her another drink of water. As expected, she chewed while drinking. I lifted her once more and walked tiredly to the safehouse me and Aggie had shared the previous night. Dead weight is easily the worst part of it. The girl‚Äôs limp body hung off my shoulder and reminded me that every step I took was an infinitely small conquest.

‚ÄúStop it,‚Äù protested the girl.

‚ÄúShh,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúI want to go home.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt we all?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs scary out here.‚Äù Perhaps she‚Äôd momentarily gained lucidity.

‚ÄúShh. You‚Äôll attract the scary things. Just be quiet.‚Äù

It was dark by the time we reached the building with the safehouse. I fashioned a sled from an old piece of discarded sheet wood so that I could mobilize the incapacitated girl up the many stairs to my hidden place. She‚Äôd not liked it when I‚Äôd secured her to the board with the rope and with every thump up the stairs, I half expected a creature to show, but nothing happened. I hoisted the makeshift sled by its connected rope, and it took until pitch black till we shuffled into the safehouse. With the door secured, I turned my attention to her, removed my jacket from her naked shoulders and set to cleaning her wounds with alcohol and bandaging what I thought was necessary‚Äîeven through the smell of her blood, the antiseptic, and through the smoke I‚Äôd lit, I could smell the brimstone wafting off her. It was treacherous, but I gave her a spare fit of clothes I‚Äôd brought and while the threads hung off her too largely, at least she‚Äôd been given decency. With her tucked into a bedroll, I watched through the same windows I‚Äôd peered from the night prior and watched the glowing eyes of creatures that parkoured across tall structures, or fought amongst themselves, and every so often it seemed those eyes stared back at me through the dirty glass, but I hoped not. I secured the door each night but was hopeful the deal would keep them at bay.

Only a few times did the Boss‚Äôs daughter stir throughout the night, but she seemed to rest well enough as anyone could within the circumstances. There were a few times I checked the heat off her forehead and felt the temperature rising. Stripping a bit of cloth off my shirt sleeve, I dampened it and draped it across her forehead; if she‚Äôd been so unlucky as to catch a fever then she‚Äôd die for I had no measures against it.

Sleep came in short spells for me, and I burned too much lantern oil, because there was a fantasy within me where I could go back for Aggie; it was common.

It was morning then night then morning again and I was breaking what little bread I had for a tough sandwich when I heard her stir from her slumber; I watched as the young woman fumbled her hands above her prone body, touching nothing, then her eyes fluttered and she pushed herself up so as to bend into a sitting position, arms buttressing her so that she could slowly examine the room. I moved to sit near her, after placing coffee over the cooking stove. Her hand moved to her face where wounds would assuredly become scars, bad deep ones that might never heal right (demon wounds never healed right all the way) and she flinched as her fingernails poked at the lines down her cheeks.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs this?‚Äù Her voice was gravelly, monotone, and dry.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre awake then?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúI think so.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood. How are your limbs? Notice anything about them that are off? Can you feel everything?‚Äù

Her jaw clenched. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll feel anything again.‚Äù

Ignoring this, I returned to the stove and pushed the heat higher. ‚ÄúCan you eat?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm thirsty.‚Äù

I motioned for the water gourd by her bedroll. ‚ÄúCan you eat? You should eat something.‚Äù

Greedily, she removed the cork and drank heavily, lines of water streaking down her chin. After removing the gourd from her mouth, a long sigh escaped her and I awaited her response, but instead, the only thing that came was a wet gurgle as she slammed the water to her lips again.

‚ÄúThe sooner you eat something, the stronger you‚Äôll get. The sooner you‚Äôre strong, we‚Äôll hit the road home. I imagine you thought you‚Äôd never miss home as much as right this second, huh?‚Äù

She cradled the gourd in her hands and smacked her lips; although her eyes were weary, a tad unfocused, she seemed self-possessed enough. ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôve met you before. I think I know you.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe,‚Äù I shrugged, ‚ÄúLots of people in Golgotha have met me, but not many people know me well,‚Äù I laughed but couldn‚Äôt smile, ‚ÄúThat sounded cheesy.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou work for my dad.‚Äù

I shook my head. ‚ÄúI do things for the Bosses sometimes. I don‚Äôt work for anyone. Never have. But sometimes a Boss needs something, I guess I‚Äôll do it.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you do?‚Äù

‚ÄúI rescued you.‚Äù

Her cold stare fell from my eyes till they drifted to the wide windows that overlooked the ruins. ‚ÄúI always thought it would be beautiful. Like a big, beautiful place. I thought it would be home. I thought it would be like dreams.‚Äù

My eyes followed hers where we could see the overwhelming cement-work that‚Äôd been done to create the ruins; walls were hewn to show skeletal rebar and every broken window was like a black tunnel. Each building was a tombstone. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a graveyard.‚Äù

‚ÄúLady said burning incense would keep the monsters away. She told me it was the only way to keep them away.‚Äù Her voice was small with a hint of betrayal.

‚ÄúIncense is good for ceremonies or preaching, but if incense was what you used to keep them away, you might as well have learned one of Lady‚Äôs incantations and done a little chicken dance.‚Äù I huffed. ‚ÄúIf they want you and you‚Äôre there for the wanting, they‚Äôll take you.‚Äù

She took in more water until the gourd was empty and then she held her stomach.

‚ÄúCareful. If you drink too much all at once like that, you‚Äôll end up with pains.‚Äù

She massaged her legs and removed herself from the innards of the bedroll to sit atop it. ‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù

I swallowed hard and pulled the fresh coffee from the heat. ‚ÄúYou should eat something. Do you prefer bread or canned beans‚ÄîI could smack together a sandwich for you. The choices are slim at the moment, but there‚Äôs a bit of dried meat too.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt they take you?‚Äù

I gritted my teeth into what was hopefully a welcoming grin. ‚ÄúHush. You should eat up and try to conjure whatever energy you have. I know you‚Äôve been through it, but there‚Äôs more to come till we see home.‚Äù

‚ÄúHome?‚Äù

‚ÄúIndeed.‚Äù

‚ÄúI came out here with Andrew. Did you find Andrew?‚Äù Her eyes momentarily illuminated with hope.

‚ÄúWho‚Äôs that?‚Äù

Her eyes drifted. ‚ÄúHe was going to be my husband. He said we‚Äôd be married.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs definitely dead.‚Äù There was no way to tell if her sweetheart was still kicking or not, but there was no use in arguing over it.

‚ÄúOh,‚Äù she whispered. There was a pause where she seemed to study the bedding she laid on. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt think it would be like this. I thought for sure that there would be something hiding out here in the wastes.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs stuff hiding alright.‚Äù I began to shrug it off but stopped myself when I could see the tears forming in her eyes. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs always hope, I guess.‚Äù

We took to eating nearer the large windows overlooking the large mouthy chasms and between swallows there were spits of conversation, but her attention was largely unconcentrated. At least her hunger was good, and she drank well.

I smoked while she interrogated me further on the state of the world.

‚ÄúAll I know is Golgotha. You‚Äôve been around, right? Is there any good place left?‚Äù She was practically pleading the question.

‚ÄúI ain‚Äôt been all over exactly. It‚Äôs not so simple. If there‚Äôs a safe place on this earth left, it won‚Äôt be long till those monsters find it and make it worse.‚Äù I watched a puff of smoke from my cigarette plume off the glass window inches from my face. ‚ÄúWho knows, huh? Maybe there‚Äôs a good place. Maybe there‚Äôs a place we go after life? Maybe that‚Äôs the safe place? My best advice? Don‚Äôt hope for it. Make it. Make it safe in the place you know. Do it in Golgotha and never leave those walls again. There‚Äôs nothing for you out here.‚Äù

Her voice was small in the wake of mine. ‚ÄúYou sound bitter. I don‚Äôt know how you could say that. That‚Äôs why I left home. I thought‚Äîwe thought there‚Äôs gotta‚Äô be a good place still left. Maybe a place by the ocean.‚Äù

I shuddered at the thought. ‚ÄúThe ocean?‚Äù

She nodded.

I shook my head. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt even try it. You‚Äôve heard the stories of what it‚Äôs like.‚Äù

‚ÄúThose are just stories to scare kids.‚Äù

I sighed. ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm sure you thought the stories of these ruins was just to scare kids. I‚Äôm sure you thought you knew it all.‚Äù I rubbed the cigarette dead against the window. ‚ÄúTake a hint and stay home. We hole up like rats or we die like ‚Äòem.‚Äù

A thought crossed her expression before she could enunciate it, ‚ÄúI remember your name,‚Äù said the girl, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Harkin or something.‚Äù

‚ÄúHarlan?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, that‚Äôs right! You‚Äôre Mister Harlan.‚Äù

‚ÄúI guess.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen you down in the town square sometimes. You like to start fights. Lady told me to stay away from you.‚Äù

‚ÄúHmph.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, never would‚Äôve thought you were such a crank. You are quite the pessimist.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm an optometrist.‚Äù

‚ÄúI think you mean optimist.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre very dull and angry-seeming.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a lot of words coming from a rich girl I pulled out of a hole.‚Äù

The room was quiet before she changed the subject once more, ‚ÄúWell, don‚Äôt you want to know my name?‚Äù

‚ÄúSure.‚Äù The word was plain.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm Gemma.‚Äù

‚ÄúA pleasure.‚Äù A moment of silence. ‚ÄúYou are aware that your father‚Äôs caused a fuss on the home-front because of your adventure?‚Äù

She shook her head.

‚ÄúHe shut off the water. That‚Äôs why I came to find you. He said he wouldn‚Äôt relinquish the pipes till his daughter was home. You have caused quite the problem.‚Äù

‚ÄúI-I didn‚Äôt know.‚Äù

‚Äú‚ÄôCourse you didn‚Äôt. The haves rarely think of how their actions might affect the have-nots.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell‚Äîokay, fine but there‚Äôs other places out west too! More than these ruins. More than Golgotha too. I heard from travelers and traders that there are whole other places with different ways of life. Why don‚Äôt people go there? Why should my father have more say than another?‚Äù

I nodded. ‚ÄúSure, there‚Äôs a place out west where they raise sheeps, chickens, or goats; that‚Äôs where the demons stalk worse than anywhere. And even further west‚Äînorthwest to be precise‚Äîthere‚Äôs where the medicines and wizards hail‚Äîa city called Babylon. There‚Äôs other places, but you wouldn‚Äôt have the faintest idea of how to get there! If you did, you‚Äôd have no standing! You‚Äôd be no better than any peasant in those places. Golgotha‚Äôs where your family is. Where your station is distinguished. You‚Äôd be a fool to give it up.‚Äù

She remained quiet for only a moment, studying the lines on her palms. ‚ÄúSurely there‚Äôs better places than home.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen some,‚Äù I shook my head, ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre looking for a better place, wait for death. At least the walls are tall, and the guns are big.‚Äù

We rested there at the waypoint for a handful of days; fevers began to take her sometime throughout the night. It would be smart to get her home before it got worse.

We set out just as the sun crested some unseen horizon, sending shadows long and darker; there were points when hugging the sides of pitch-black walls, that it remained night even in day within the dead city. Gemma was slow and I took note of her knees or elbows quivering due to whatever strain might be placed upon them with our traversal. I remained as calm as I could as we shifted through the morning chill, through hell, through the uncompromising screams of distant mutants or demons echoing off the walls. Every so often those howls would come, and Gemma might freeze where she was and I could see that if only for a moment, her eyes shrank, her throat swallowed, and she looked small and scared, then it would be as though she was totally unbothered, and she‚Äôd throw her shoulders back and continue following me.

‚ÄúAre you winded yet?‚Äù I asked after several hours of climbing old wreckage and pushing across rubble.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù her speech was gasped yet tempered, ‚ÄúNot yet. I‚Äôm fine.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be stupid.‚Äù I stopped, put up my hand and motioned for her to take a seat on a nearby stone. We sat for a moment, and I passed her the water. A few of the last drops ran the length from the corner of her mouth to her ear lobe and I winced at the loss.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm ready to go again.‚Äù She moved to rise, and I put my hand on her shoulder, snatching the empty gourd from her.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt act silly now. There‚Äôs no reason with all the sun we‚Äôve got. I hope to make it to Golgotha while there‚Äôs still light, but that does not mean I intend on dragging your corpse with me. If you need to relax, relax.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf there‚Äôs nothing better in this world, then what‚Äôs my corpse matter?‚Äù Gemma cut her eyes at me and stood to move away from me.

‚ÄúWoe is you!‚Äù I felt anger rising. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go then, but if you fall out here, I‚Äôm done dragging your ass around.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt.‚Äù She shrugged.

The travelling was slowed. I caught a strange glint off Gemma‚Äôs eyes when sun shafts landed across her face.

‚ÄúAre you feverish still? How warm are you feeling?‚Äù The brief thought of touching her forehead graced my thoughts.

She didn‚Äôt answer and instead pushed on and so I did the same, maintaining a healthy habit of checking that she was following behind every few seconds.

Without another break, through heavy breathing and through sweat, we met the edges of the open field around Golgotha nearing early evening, and I saw the fortified walls cloaking the base of the city‚Äôs structures far out. I came to a stop while Gemma attempted to continue walking. I snatched her by the wrist, stopping her. Her head lolled around to look at me although I‚Äôm certain she didn‚Äôt really *see* me and she cut her eyes hard, yanking her hand free of mine. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt touch me. I see home. It‚Äôs home. You said it‚Äôs important. We should go hide like rats.‚Äù Her jabbering came from the mouth of someone protesting through the haze of a dream.

‚ÄúNo. I need to signal that we‚Äôre coming. The men on the walls will see us through their scopes, but that doesn‚Äôt mean a stray bullet won‚Äôt find us.‚Äù I removed the sheet of aluminum Boss Maron had given me days prior and unfolded it until the thing was large as parchment sheet; I waved the aluminum flag overhead and began walking forward, grabbing Gemma‚Äôs hand again. She did not fight me and instead staggered along, her foot tips tracing lines in the dirt. Normally, I might‚Äôve checked through binoculars that the men on the wall signed back, but keeping ahold of Gemma was more important in her delirious state. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve still got enough sun in the sky that they‚Äôll know its us from the reflection.‚Äù

Just as the words left my mouth, darkness overcame the landscape and I felt cold for it wasn‚Äôt night that came, but a massive shadow; I felt the wind of something immense and pulled Gemma closer to me. Looking up into the air, there was the great winged beast‚Äîa thing I‚Äôd only seen once before and never so close to a human bastion. Its several clawed fists hung in front of its chest, forelegs muscled and prepared for snatching whatever unsuspecting prey it might find; the demon‚Äôs great head was that of a serpent and the wings which arched from its back gathered wind beneath their membranes; each stroke it took overhead left a dust fog in front of us and I could scarcely make out the innumerable writhing tendrils which danced off the creature‚Äôs body. The distinguished sound of the wall‚Äôs gunfire registered across the open land, and I felt Gemma fall into me. Leviathan circled against the angry sky, casting its tremendous shadow across us. Examining Gemma, I could see her fever had overtaken her and she‚Äôd fallen unconscious.

‚ÄúI told you goddammit! I‚Äôm not going to drag your ass across this field! Wake up!‚Äù I shook the unconscious girl. Her eyelids flickered. ‚ÄúWake up for Christ‚Äôs sake.‚Äù I slapped her hard and nothing and I shook her some more and pleaded. Leviathan‚Äôs scream shook the ground beneath us.

I moved across the open field as quickly as my legs would allow; with the addition of Gemma‚Äôs dead weight, I could pull on her limp arms only so long before I knelt before the shadow of the beast and hoisted her over my shoulders. I ran, top heavy, and imagined my feet leaving solid ground. Loud bangs were the signature for muzzle flashes from the wall that I could scarcely see through the sweat in my eyes.

There was no protest from Leviathan, not a care in response to the barrage of munitions.

Artillery whistled through the air and the ground shook once more while I staggered over my own weight to glance up at the beast as it took a broadside shot to its black torso and although the wound it received seemed critical, it remained unfazed while tar-colored flesh shed off the beast, plodding all around me. The warmth from the explosion kissed me like hot breath while the smell of rotted chicken filled the air and Leviathan‚Äôs blood rained over us as it adjusted itself in the sky. Dark blood ran granular and rough down my face and maybe Gemma mumbled innocuous cries‚Äîstill I continued through the muck. Another artillery round struck the creature‚Äôs left wing, leaving behind a smoldering hole in its thick membrane, sending it forward into a nosedive to the ground. Its trajectory arched overhead till it slammed in an explosion of sand far to the left and the sun beamed once more. Its cries were the thousands (if not more) souls it‚Äôd devoured, screeching not like a dragon, but a village of tormented folks removed from this world and placed in another; it was the screams of strangled ghosts; the wild tentacles dotting its body writhed, snatching out at open air like whips and as thick as metal cables. The wind off the beast stung as it sent up sand in my face. Like a mistaken dog, it shook its head and propelled itself far and away into a leap that shook the ground till it glided over the horizon toward a place unseen.

I stood in the open field, certain I was dead; it was not until murmurs escaped Gemma‚Äôs mouth that I took toward Golgotha again.

The cheers of the men on the wall overtook the clacking of the main gate coming free. I fell through the doorway while some of the wall-men gathered around. The blood of Leviathan was already thickened in the sun, clinging off me with some of its meat stinking and steaming into my clothes.

‚ÄúTake the girl home,‚Äù I shouldered Gemma off me onto the ground and she was caught by the men while I fell. People gathered round in knots of bewildered faces.

‚ÄúWater!‚Äù some of them shouted as the spigots in town ran freely once more. Some cheered while I took tiredly in the square by the gate and sat on an arrangement of cinderblocks. Boss Maron was there, an old metal bucket banging against his left knee; he took the contents of the container and tossed it over my head. The water was warm but welcome.

‚ÄúYou stink.‚Äù Said the Boss.

‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you go shit somewhere else?‚Äù I was nauseous at the stench clinging to me‚Äîshaking my right hand, a hunk of the creature sloughed off my arm onto the ground.

Boss Maron took up alongside me. ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt we just play nice some, eh?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to hear it.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs happened to the girl you left with? You left with one girl and came back with another? What a heartbreaker you are! Certainly, a man about town!‚Äù

Depositing my pack between my knees, I removed tobacco and took to rolling a cigarette. The paper kept tearing in my hands.

‚ÄúBoss Harold has a plan for those boys. Those ones that took him hostage.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo?‚Äù

‚ÄúSo, I‚Äôm just glad you came back with the girl. Others are too.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like *you* went without water.‚Äù

A chuckle fell from him. ‚Äú‚ÄôCourse not. There‚Äôs no reason I should. But some of the veggies in the hydro lab looked thirsty. It‚Äôs good you returned when you did. Anyway, we knew you‚Äôd come through. I can‚Äôt remember a time you haven‚Äôt.‚Äù

I bit a poorly folded cigarette and inhaled opposite a match. My eyes traced the people cheering in the streets out near the gate then up to the wall where soldiers stood with their rifles.

‚ÄúWhat brought the dragon out?‚Äù Boss Maron wondered aloud.

‚ÄúWho gives a shit? Why don‚Äôt you go pull its tail and ask.‚Äù

Among the revelers stood a figure in a cloak with a hood covering stringy gray hair. Lady was there in a moment, watching my conversation from afar, then she was swallowed by the crowd.

39M here, met a 37F two years ago through mutual friends. We started off as friends but it developed into a FWB after a few months but we never managed to take it to a more serious relationship. We have always discussed things openly and I genuinely felt that I have found a person with her who I can be my true self with.
Over the course of these last 2 years she has obviously shared a couple of very personal details with me which I am not going to go into great detail here but there was sexual abuse involved from an extended family member. She grew up with a highly narcissistic mother and my friend has just a few weeks ago said once again things like ‚ÄúI would leave the city/country in heartbeat and not tell anybody‚Äù. She has issues bonding with people and building a connection.

For the last few months it has always been me who I felt kept this friendship alive‚Ä¶ me reaching out to her through text, asking if she‚Äôs free for a coffee or lunch etc. 4 weeks ago I sat her down and told her straight into her face that I feel that I am pulling her along, that it‚Äôs me who reaches out all the time and that I don‚Äôt feel like she‚Äôs putting a lot of effort into keeping this friendship alive. 

I kind of expected her to be more on her toes now with everything I have said to her but instead I haven‚Äôt heard from her at all in these 4 weeks. She lives a 15 minute walk away from me, she has plenty of time in the evenings and on weekends (I know her routine). I just feel like I am suddenly of no use to her anymore, like a throwaway product. I am angry and actually too proud to reach out to her again. 

I think I am looking for some advise what others would do in that situation. Just move on? Hold on to it? I don‚Äôt know ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Wanted to seek feedback on depth of great room. Currently its 18.5 but wanted to do built ins. I imagine thst would reduce depth to 16.5. Not sure if that's deep enough for two sofas and two swivel chairs and end tables and coffee table. Does anyone have feedback based on personal experience. Please note we have plenty of width (see pic of floorplan attached). Btw I cannot expand dimensions as I've reached maximum setback and if I get an overwhelmingly huge response that it's not deep enough I guess I can forego the built ins although I was really wanting that look. Thank you so much in advance!!!

Recently discovered this subreddit, and it has been incredibly helpful! This trip has been in the works for me for about 3 years, finally found a good set of time where me and one of my best friends would be able to visit. For context we are both 21, Male, and decently nerdy. I arrive a day earlier than he does. Hoping to get some advice on the plans, things I should skip, things I am completely missing, etc! Thank you for any help in advance :)  
  
(12/12) Tokyo  

* Land in Haneda, send luggage from Airport to Hotel, Train to Hotel (In Ueno, very close to Ueno Park)
* Leaving this day pretty open to allow myself some ability to rest after the long flight.
* Depending on timing / energy / amount of daylight remaining, visit Ueno Park, get dinner near hotel.

(12/13) Tokyo (Mitaka)

* My first full day. I got tickets to the Ghibli Museum (YAY!). Ticket time is at 12:00.
* Metro to Mitaka Station. Coffee somewhere on the way to Inokashira Park
* Enjoy the Museum to the fullest. I have been a Ghibli fan since I was a kid, so this was one of my #1 must do things while I was here.
* Spend more time in Inokashira Park and Mitaka if I want exploring around, once I'm done, back to Ueno. If time allows, see Tokyo National Museum?
* Friend lands this day, so meet up with him at some point. Dinner again near hotel.

(12/14) Tokyo (Shibuya / Shinjuku)

* Friend's first full day. Couple neat smaller temples near where we are staying (Eishoji, Senjuin, Saiz≈çin). See them if we want, or if we get a late start just head straight to Shibuya.
* Shibuya Scramble Crossing (Obviously), Shibuya Sky Tickets @ Noon, Shibuya Pokemon Center, Shibuya Jump Shop, Tower Records Shibuya, Nintendo Store.
* Depending on how much time we have spent in Shibuya, this could be a day to see Shinjuku or another city we didn't have planned if we want.
* Dinner Reservation @ 8:00 at Yakisoba CELONA (Heard good things from another friend who has visited previously)

(12/15) Tokyo (Akihabara)

* As stated earlier, both of us are pretty big nerds, so Akihabara seemed like a must. I had heard that the roads become pedestrianized on Sundays here in Akihabara, which I thought would be neat.
* See the touristy shops, Super Potato, GiGO Arcade Building, Don Quijote, Yodobashi Camera. I'm big into Pokemon TCG, so hoping to see some shops related to that. 
* No specific plans for this day, just explore this really cool part of the city. If there are any specific things I am missing here, I would LOVE advice :)
* If we are done fast, metro to Nakano Broadway. OR if we didn't see it previously, back to hotel for Ueno Park / Tokyo National Museum.

(12/16) Shibu Onsen

* The Jigokudani Monkey Park was something my friend REALLY wanted to see, so who am I to say no. Due to the distance decided to spend the night at a local Ryokan, and see what seems to be a really beautiful city.
* \~3-4 hours of trains, bus to Jigokudani Monkey Park, store luggage at the lockers there, and see the park. After that, 10-15 minute walk to the Ryokan we are staying at.
* Dinner / Breakfast provided, private / public onsen included in the stay as well.

(12/17) Kyoto

* Breakfast served in Ryokan, take trains / Shinkansen to Kyoto. Check into hotel, rest for a bit if need be, and then head out towards Nishiki Market.
* Explore Gion District Afternoon into the night time, find Dinner / Drinks somewhere in this area (Pontocho Alley?)
* Back to hotel for a good nights sleep

  
(12/18) Kyoto

* Metro from hotel to Fushimi Inari earlier in the morning. Explore that area, see what there is to see.
* Walk / Metro (Depending on how exhausted we are) to Sanj≈´sangend≈ç Temple.
* Depending on time, walk to Kenninji Temple, or just explore around the area and meander our way to where the Wagashi Class is.
* Walk / Metro to Wagashi Class I signed us up for, which I think will be pretty cool. Reservation @ 4:00.
* Dinner in the area, walk back to hotel through Gion District which neatly splits the two.

  
(12/19) Uji / Nara Day Trip

* Breakfast / Coffee near hotel, and take metro to Uji. Heard it was neat from this subreddit, so I'm gonna give it a shot. Both me and my friend are BIG fans of Matcha, so would be cool to see a place where it is so rooted in the culture.
* In Uji: Byodoin Temple, Uji Bridge, Masuda Chaho (Tea House). Spend as much time here as we want, just not too much.
* Metro to Nara. In Nara: Todaiji Temple, Nara Park, Kasuga Taisha, Nara Higashimuki Shopping Street (Picking and choosing as time allows.) I heard places close earlier, so once stuff starts to close up, head back to Kyoto.

(12/20) Kyoto

* Leave the Hotel whenever, and head to Kyoto Imperial Palace (30-40 Minute walk from where we are staying). English tours given at 10:00 and 2:00, so gonna opt for the 10:00 one. 
* Once the tour is done, see Kyoto Gyoen National Garden which is I think apart of the Kyoto Imperial Palace.
* Shusui-tei Tea Ceremony House will be open this day as well, so see that.
* Honestly, for the rest of this day, I have no idea. Would love to round it out, but I'm not too sure what would be good. **Would love advice if anyone has any.** Wanted to see Arashiyama Bamboo Forest, but it is really out of the way and I wasn't too sure where to fit it into the days we were here in Kyoto.

(12/21) Tokyo (Ikebukuro)

* Metro / Shinkansen from Kyoto > Tokyo. Check into hotel (Same one we stayed at during first leg of the trip).
* From hotel, Metro to Ikebukuro for the Sunshine City Mall. See the Sunshine City Aquarium first, since it closes at 6:00. Bunch of other cool stores here to check out, wanted to go somewhere that we could kind of splurge towards the end of the trip so that budgeting would be less of an issue.
* Cool stores like Pokemon Center Sunshine City, Pikachu Sweets, Ghibli Store, One Piece Mugiwara Store, Bandai/Namco Cross Store, Marvel Store. Get dinner somewhere in the mall.

(12/22) Tokyo (TeamLab Planets)

* Last day :(. From Hotel, head to Tsukiji Outer Market depending on how much we liked Nishiki? Heard it has gotten significantly worse in recent years though.
* TeamLab Planets tickets @ 11:00. 
* After TeamLab, I have nothing planned. **Would also love advice here, anything cool to see or do in Tokyo as a good way to close out the trip!**

(12/23) Back Home :(

Thank you in advance for taking the time to look through this! 

**TLDR**: Would love advice on a good way to spend the last half of our last day in Kyoto, and the last half of our last day in Tokyo! (Or any advice on things to skip or things I missed). Would also love advice on any really good restaurants in any of the areas we are visiting. Left most of it up to luck, but would still love advice!",1,1733814535.0,JapanTravel,0,1.0,False

BUT LISTEN üòÖ What we have is absolutely amazing. We are head over heels in love, have worked together for a long time very closely, and it took years of me initiating to go from colleagues to lovers. Every day, I get to work early and we share breakfast and coffee before anyone else gets there. Every day, we share lunch. We go on walks. We are inseparable. We are sort of a power couple at work because we are making things happen at our organization... And there is a significant age gap, so it's less suspicious. 

But yes. PROBABLY EVERYONE KNOWS. And we are both married to other people. 

The consequences of being caught are severe for him, though they are less so for me (although maybe I'm dreaming here that they would be less severe for me.) I applied at a few other jobs because I'm scared to death we're going to get caught and see the writing on the wall, and then our personal AND professional lives will be toast. Recently, I was offered another job and accepted. I'll stay local, get way more money, and be in a managerial role (equivalent to my AP's role at another organization near by). It's a win-win.

But God my heart is absolutely breaking because I love seeing my AP every day, and we'll go down to once a week at most. I want to go legit. He is not ready to consider that. 

Has anyone been through something similar? If so, how did you make it work? Am I delusional to hope that we will continue to be together when it's no longer convenient?

I've seen so many people say they've cured or almost completely got rid of their anxiety and I just really want that. It will be a year strict BBBE salt Carnivore with no coffee or tea just water in January. Just curious if anyone knows how I can eat differently on this diet or eat more of certain things to feel better mentally. My mental health is the most important thing to me. I am in good physical shape just a bit skinny. I'm 155 pounds at 6 foot 1.  I workout 2-3 times a week and also play sports. I tried so hard with therapists and meditations and positive thinking but none of it has truly helped me other than this diet. I feel like I must be doing something wrong. I tried also eating 2000 calories a day and 155g of protien and 200g to 250g of fat so it would be a 2-1 fat to protien ratio. I also should add that I have very loose stools very quick after meals.

I‚Äôm a sucker for cute cafes, bad jokes, and exploring the city (slowly, because I get tired easily‚Äîoops).

I‚Äôm looking for a sweet, understanding guy who can make me feel at ease and maybe even take the lead, since I‚Äôm a bit shy at first. Bonus points if you‚Äôre funny, kind-hearted, and know how to keep a conversation going while I nervously sip my coffee.

I have educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out and earn extra money:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is mostly protein elements.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Your body regenerates plasma fast from staying hydrated and eating protein.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait inbetween those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hyrdrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

1havnqb,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1havnqb/new_owners_of_previous_cafe_location_are_still/,New owners of previous cafe location are still contacting with complaints. How to deal with it?,"My partner owned a cafe for four years at a location right next to a university campus. It was very successful, she gained a lot of regular customers, but the location was always the obstacle for her, due to summer/winter break periods. So, around two months ago, she finally decided to move to a more crowded and stable location, keeping everything the same(cafe name, menus, etc.) It's been around 3 weeks since opening and it doing very well so far.

Now, the new owners took over the old location with a completely new name, concept, menus, everything. They are both young, in their early 20s, first time in a cafe business. As soon as my partner put up the location at that time, they immediately contacted her and signed the contract. She told them that she will take some plates, cups, utensils and a few small things from the kitchen, but the fridge and coffee machine, furniture will all stay. That was the negotiation and they didn't request for anything else. In fact, we felt that they lacked manners, since they brought their interior people to measure everything, while my partner was still working there. They would take over two tables and discuss how to change the concept. Also, they said they were going to keep and use the furniture, but apparently they took pics of everything and put it up on an app where you sell second-hand goods. It's fine if they wanted to sell everything, but doing this while she was still working felt like a red flag.

They called and wrote to her numerous times during these two months, complaining about trivial things. Now, they are finally planning to open this week, but they called my partner again and claimed that the coffee machine was not working well. The coffee machine worked fine until the end and she even demonstrated how to use and allowed to test the machine, which all worked fine. They were also informed that the machine was quite old, so they should test it again in advance before opening. How do we know what happened during the 2 months they renovated the place? They also complained that she didn't clean the place well enough. They even threatened to take legal action due to these issues.

Is this normal? If they are going to do this two months after the contract was signed, shouldn't they have checked everything more thoroughly and requested exactly what they want before urgently signing the contract? ",1,1733812270.0,smallbusiness,5,0.67,False

It pays to listen to it,"I have spent weeks having no new subs or sends in Throne. So earlier today, I got a message from a really new account. Normally, I do not engage as much. But since the message did not just say, hi, hello or hey, I decided let him express his intention. And of course, answer questions as clearly as I can.

I am honestly glad I did. I had the most engaging conversation with a new sub that I have been longing for. He did say he will not be around this month. I told him he is welcome to come back anytime. He will be a tentative coffee sub cutie I have been wanting. 

In the meantime, I am happy I received coffee money. And yes, indulged in some nice conversation. Not the most coveted big sends but for me I am very thrilled of this small win. 

I will continue to have fun and hope that my Throne sends will light up like a Christmas tree. ü§≠ ",2,1733811625.0,findommes,0,1.0,False
1havhha,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/1havhha/i_dont_know_what_to_do_anymore/,I don't know what to do anymore... ,"I (34F) was recently hit with a huge life changing job opportunity and it's made me completely rethink my entire relationship and what I want moving forward because it requires a change of location.

Stress has been really high since the opportunity and after discussions with my husband (40M), we decided to take the plunge and move. We're still waiting for our house to sell, and in the months that have passed, things have really been very eye-opening to me and I am not sure that I want him to move with me anymore, I kind of want to go alone.

My husband, ever since we met, has been a grumpy, victim-mentality, drunk. But when I met him, I was 24 (he was 30) and I truly believed that if I could just help him get his life on track and in a better place he would be a happier person. But now, 10 years later, I realize that he will only ever be a miserable person. He gets so angry easily, too, and I had a major breakdown on Thanksgiving when he was completely wasted and blew up at me because he lost his thermometer saying he ""really just wanted to punch something"". I finally told him I couldn't take this anymore and I went outside for awhile to calm down.

The problem I struggle with, is that when he's sober and in a good mood, he is such a fun, interesting person to be with and I genuinely enjoy our time together. But when he's in a bad mood or has been drinking I just want to leave and hide. He's never been physical with me, and we actually rarely ever get into arguments, but I also have been standing up to him more lately.

We haven't been intimate in months, and even when we were it was maybe once a month if he felt like it. The last time I tried to initiate he was getting up to go fishing and I was heading to bed (I work a weird 2nd-3rd shift blend) and he told me he didn't have time because he needed to go and told me ""we can do stuff anytime, I gotta go before it gets too late."" And that really hurt me, to feel that fishing is more important than me.

I don't even feel like I can talk to him anymore because he complains that I talk to much, so I just constantly bite my tongue  and I sit silently in my house with my dogs, and chase the boredom on my phone or computer.

I am the main income provider, I pay all the bills, manage all the accounts, do our taxes, handle all our legal stuff, medical stuff, groceries, and house keeping. I make sure the animals are all cared for and that he has everything he needs. I stopped making him coffee in the morning though, and he's noticed and commented on it. When I try to get him involved with finances he tells me, ""You always figure it out, just do what you normally do."" and doesn't want to take any involvement. He get's about 50% of his income per month for cigs, alcohol, and fuel and I give myself just 10% of what I give him for my own fuel and rare days to go out. I also pay for his truck, which is 75% of his income and he wanted to start his own business but then never finished it.

He got injured a few years ago, right before we got married and after we married he quit the job he got injured at and was going to start this hauling business. It never went anywhere though because I told him it was 100% on him to get it started. After half a year, I asked him to get a part time job, while working through the business thing, to help pay for his consumables. Long story short, he's been job hopping low income jobs just to appease me and if I bring up anything work related/money related he has this ultimatum mindset that he'll just go do over the road trucking to make me happy. And I tell him that's not what I am asking, just maybe something local with a box truck or something. But it just ends in frustration so I have stopped even bringing it up.

I feel so depressed and empty all of the time, I feel like I am just taking care of a lazy roommate. I know he cares about me, but I don't feel that he cares FOR me. And yet, I sit here struggling with what to do because we made vows to get through stuff, and we both were very serious in making a marriage work and I keep telling myself it will get better, we just need X, Y, Z to happen and it will be better.

But this whole move thing has really shaken everything up and really made me open my eyes to everything I can't stand anymore. And I just don't know how to have this conversation. I'm scared for how it will pan out. I'm worried my people pleaser will kick in and I will let him swoon me again, because when I'm with him in a good mood, I just love being around him. And I have to have these kinds of talks when he is in that mood or I'm scared for what might happen.

I have no idea how divorce works, our house is already listed for sale, so in my mind it should be pretty easy - sell the house as planned, pay off debts as planned, trade the truck in to a dealership? because I don't want it and he can't afford it, and then we split whatever money is left? We don't have a child, BUT I have a preteen from a previous LTR, and hubs has a teen relative that lives with us due to some issues at home, which has NOT made our situation any easier stress-wise. They're a handful and just as frustrating to deal with as my husband is.

I had a light talk with him a couple of months ago where divorce brought up and he seemed like he would be kind and fair with the split, but we agreed to work things out. He got me some treats for my birthday, has helped with more chores lately, and overall been in a better mood, but when he drinks, it just makes me wish I could disappear. I promised him when we first met that I would never ask him to stop his consumables, and I don't plan to do that, but in exchange, I think I have to tell him I can't stand it anymore and I want out.

I realize that this is very long, and I apologize, I need somewhere to vent. And get my thoughts out, and from a 3rd perspective, I know the right answer, but from my shoes, I feel so conflicted. I'm worried I am seeing the grass greener from another side if we split. I'm worried I am just a relationship hopper and bored of being with him. I'm worried for how divorce would go and what might happen. I hardly sleep at night anymore because it's all I can think about - how much better of I'd be without him. But yet, I hesitate because I made a promise when we got married to be through thick and thin.",1,1733811588.0,AskWomenOver30,5,0.6,False
1havfr3,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/1havfr3/how_can_i_help_husband_is_having_issues_but_wont/,How can I help‚Ä¶ husband is having issues but won‚Äôt recognize his problem,"My husband hasn‚Äôt always been a heavy drinker.. through college and our early years of marriage, we normally only had a few bottles of alcohol in the house, and maybe a few bottles of beer or wine. Nothing much. Maybe we would have something with dinner, but neither of us drank very often. I really had never seen him drunk, as we weren‚Äôt party people either. 

Fast forward to Covid era.. my husband is now in his early 30‚Äôs and discovered subs on Reddit talking about different types of alcohol, and TikTok‚Äôs that bartenders made showing off how to make drinks.. he starts getting into mixology.. I started thinking ‚Äúoh that‚Äôs kinda cool‚Ä¶‚Äù thinking it was harmless as he would occasionally make a drink for us at home. 

Then he started reallllly getting into it.. buying so many different types of hard liquor, mixers, making his own mixers.. like an extreme hobby.. 

Again, I didn‚Äôt think too much of it, because he wasn‚Äôt getting drunk. But I started noticing that he was making drinks now 2-3 times a week. 

Fast forward a few more years, our baby is born, stress is higher, work is awful‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs commuting again, and I started noticing that the 2-3 times a week is closer to 5-6 drinks a week. 

I tried talking to him about it and he says it‚Äôs not too much, it‚Äôs not effecting his health, that he didn‚Äôt drink on xyz day of whatever week‚Ä¶ making excuses‚Ä¶ when I asked him about spending so much money at the liquor stores he says that he‚Äôs just a connoisseur buying ingredients because he likes the creativity of making drinks.. but his anger, and anxiety are at an all-time high right now too.. 

Well tonight he got shit faced.. ruined my night, my kids night, his night.. I ended up call his parents to come help me, as he was trying to drive away in his car incoherently‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs currently at their house sleeping it off while I‚Äôm home taking care of everything here.. I did the math.. and he has spent almost 5k on alcohol this year at liquor stores alone.. 5k for one person.. but he doesn‚Äôt seem to think that he has a problem.. meanwhile I feel guilty buying myself a coffee, because I know that our budget is tight. To say I‚Äôm mad is an understatement.. but I want him to get better and to come through this. But I think the first step is for him to understand this isn‚Äôt healthy.. 

I should add, he comes from a line of alcoholics.. his mom, grandparent, and sibling all struggle with it. His mom has been sober for 4 years now, and has totally become a better person by doing so. She gets it.. and is going to try to talk to him too. But I don‚Äôt know what I can do to make it sink in that this isn‚Äôt ok. ",4,1733811396.0,alcoholism,0,1.0,False
