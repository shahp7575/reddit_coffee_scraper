1qdfn28,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundandExpose/comments/1qdfn28/aita_for_staying_silent_after_my_fil_caught_me/,"AITA for staying silent after my FIL caught me with his other son and died from a heart attack three weeks later, while my husband mourns believing they had 'no secrets'?","Their father collapsed at the bottom of the basement stairs after catching me kissing his other son, and when the paramedics asked what happened I said he just fell.

That was three weeks ago at his retirement party. He died yesterday. Heart attack. The doctors said the stress from the fall might have triggered it but I know what really killed him.

My husband doesn't know his brother and I have been sleeping together for six months. His father knew. He saw us that night against the storage shelves, my dress hiked up, his son's hands on my waist. The look on his face before he turned around and walked back upstairs made my stomach drop.

We stayed hidden in that basement for twenty minutes. His brother kept saying ""maybe he didn't see clearly, maybe he thinks it was someone else."" But we both knew. When we finally came back up the party was still going. His father was talking to guests, laughing, acting completely normal. He looked directly at me once and I thought I was going to be sick.

He never said anything. Not that night. Not the week after. Not when my husband invited everyone over for Sunday dinner and his father sat across from me passing the potatoes like nothing happened.

His brother called me two days after the funeral. His voice was shaking. He said ""Dad talked to me before he went. In the hospital. He said he was sorry he didn't tell me sooner.""

Their father knew for three weeks that his sons' wife was fucking his other son and he kept it inside. The brother thinks the stress contributed to the heart attack. I think he's right. I think we killed him.

Here's how it started. My husband screams. About everything. Dishes in the sink, dinner being cold, me wanting to see my friends. He'd corner me in the kitchen and call me useless while his family was in the next room and nobody ever said anything.

His brother started texting me after a barbecue where my husband made me cry in front of everyone. Just ""are you okay"" at first. Then coffee to talk. Then his apartment after particularly bad fights.

I told myself we were just talking. He listened. He didn't yell. He didn't make me feel worthless. My husband hadn't touched me in almost a year but would lose his mind if I didn't kiss him goodnight. His brother would hold my hand and say ""you don't deserve to be treated like this.""

It happened in his car first. After my husband threw a glass at the wall during a fight about grocery shopping. I showed up at his brother's door at midnight and he let me in.

Every fight sent me back to him. ""At least someone actually listens,"" I told him once. He smiled. ""I'll always listen.""

The retirement party was supposed to be simple. Dinner, speeches, family photos. My husband ignored me the entire cocktail hour, complaining to his work friends. His brother tilted his head toward the hallway and I followed.

The basement was dark and quiet. Old rec room nobody used. We were against the wall when the door opened and his father stood there at the top of the stairs. He didn't say anything. Just stared. Then turned around and left.

His brother grabbed my arm. ""Wait, just wait, let me think."" We stood there in the dark trying to figure out what to do. When we came back up his father was cutting cake and smiling for photos.

Three weeks later my husband called me from the hospital screaming that his father was gone. Just collapsed at home. Massive heart attack. I drove there and held him while he sobbed in the waiting room.

His brother pulled me aside in the hallway. His face was gray. ""He knew. He told me he knew about us. Said he was sorry he didn't tell me sooner. Those were almost his last words.""

My husband keeps saying his father was his best friend. That they told each other everything. That they had no secrets. I sit there and nod and feel like I'm choking.

His brother won't talk to me now. Blocked my number. Moved to another state last week without telling anyone why. The family thinks it's grief. My husband calls him every day begging him to come home, saying ""you're all I have left now.""

I keep seeing his father's face in that basement doorway. The way he looked at us. The silence.

My husband cries himself to sleep every night. I lie there next to him thinking about how his father carried our secret for three weeks until his heart gave out.

Should I have said something right away? Should I tell him now? I don't even know what I'm asking anymore.

I just had a few questions to get off my mind, hopefully yall have answers!

For the liquid diet, can I have redbull? Im gonna need something to get me through this and I dont really like black coffee lol. What about hard candies as long as I dont chew them?

What does it feel like? (Both the prep and the procedure) Will I be nauseous or vomiting from the prep or is it strictly bowel movements? 

The biggest question; When I start the liquid diet, can I still take my daily medication? I have medication I need to take 2-3x daily for pain management, if I'm off my dosage for a few hours I start getting very uncomfortable side effects, and apparently they can be really detrimental if I suddenly stop taking it. 

I already sent an email to my Dr, but he has a very busy office, and it can take several days to answer emails and phone calls. the office is closed on Friday and my procedure is on Monday, I dont know if I'll get an answer by then.

1qdflfz,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1qdflfz/delivery_driver/,Delivery Driver,"There is a certain kind of quiet you only hear in the desert.

It is not the peaceful kind people post about, not the wide-open silence that makes you feel small in a romantic way. It is the kind of quiet that feels like the world has stepped back a few feet and is watching you. Like the empty space around your house has weight.

My parents’ place sits on the edge of Las Vegas, where the neighborhoods thin out and the streetlights start to feel too far apart. In the day, everything looks sun-bleached and normal. Stucco homes. Gravel yards with neat little succulents. A few palm trees that look like they’re fighting the climate. The horizon is always too clear, the sky always too big.

At night, though, the desert makes the dark feel more intentional.

That weekend, it was supposed to be perfect.

We’d been looking forward to it for weeks, the three of us texting in our group chat like it was a countdown to something sacred. Carmen Lopez had brought two duffel bags, one full of clothes and one full of snacks, because she said she didn’t trust anyone else to pack correctly. Shay Smith had a portable speaker and a stack of horror movies she insisted were “classic,” even though I’d never heard of half of them. And me, Alyssa Short, I had the house.

A whole house.

Just for us.

My parents called it an “Adult Weekend” with that specific tone adults use when they want you to know they’re still cool. My mom had actually said the word casinos like she was saying it for my benefit, like I was supposed to picture them dressed up and happy and out late. They were going with Carmen’s parents and Shay’s parents too. Three couples. A weekend getaway. Dinner reservations. Shows. Slot machines. They made it sound like a group field trip.

They kept telling us all the same thing.

“Don’t open the door for anyone.”

“Don’t leave the backyard gate unlatched.”

“Keep your phones on.”

“Order food, but don’t tell anyone you’re alone.”

My dad said that last one like it was a joke. Like it was a funny little modern rule.

But he said it twice.

By the time their cars pulled away Friday afternoon, the three of us were already on the living room floor with blankets and nail polish and the kind of laughter that makes your stomach hurt.

It felt like freedom in the most teenage way possible. Not dramatic. Not rebellious. Just finally, for once, not being watched.

We made TikToks we never posted. We did face masks that made us look like aliens. Carmen tried to teach Shay and me a dance she swore was easy, and we all almost fell into the coffee table.

Then it was night, and the air-conditioning made the house feel too cold, and the windows turned into black mirrors reflecting our faces back at us.

Shay wanted to watch something scary, because of course she did. She said horror movies were “comforting,” which was the craziest thing I’d ever heard. Carmen argued for a rom-com. I said we could do both, because I didn’t want to fight on our weekend.

We ended up with Shay’s choice first.

The movie was the kind that used silence like a weapon. Long shots of empty hallways. A soundtrack that sounded like distant breathing. The kind of film where every creak in the house feels like it could be part of the story.

Halfway through, Carmen got up and started rummaging in my kitchen cabinets like she owned the place.

“We need pizza,” she announced.

“Obviously,” I said.

My family has a tradition. It sounds silly when I say it out loud, but it’s real. Every weekend, at least once, we get Papa John’s. It started when I was little and my dad was working late all the time. Friday nights were pizza nights, no matter what. It didn’t matter if we were broke. It didn’t matter if we were busy. Papa John’s meant the week was done. It meant we were all in the same room.

So when Carmen said pizza, my brain didn’t even process the possibility of something else. Pizza was normal. Pizza was safe. Pizza was home.

Shay made a face. “I thought Italians hated chain pizza.”

“I’m Italian,” I said, pointing at myself like it was evidence. “And I love it. It’s a family tradition.”

Carmen grinned. “See? Cultural significance.”

We checked the fridge. Nothing that wasn’t a condiment or something my mom would use in a salad. Carmen waved her phone around like she was searching for signal even though the Wi-Fi was fine.

“My mom said they might order us food,” she said. “Like surprise us.”

“My dad said the same,” Shay added.

That settled it in our minds. The idea became a fact. Parents out at casinos, feeling generous, sending pizza to their daughters like a sitcom.

We went back to the living room and waited, half-watching the movie, half-watching our phones, the way you do when you’re expecting something you really want.

At some point, I must have gotten too comfortable. I remember the blankets around my legs, the glow of the TV, Shay’s braids falling forward as she leaned toward the screen. Carmen’s laugh was soft as she whispered a comment about how the main character was making dumb choices.

Then, the knock.

It didn’t sound like it belonged in the movie.

It came from the front door, sharp and real, and it cut through the room in a way that made all three of us freeze.

We looked at each other.

“Pizza,” Carmen mouthed, like she was afraid to say it too loudly.

Shay lowered the volume. The TV became a muted flicker.

Another knock came, a little impatient this time.

We all moved at once, the three of us sliding off the couch like we’d rehearsed it. The living room opened into the entryway, and beyond that was the front door, painted a pale tan that blended into the stucco outside. There was a peephole. There were two locks. There was a small Ring camera my dad had installed after our neighbor’s car got broken into.

We didn’t think about any of that.

We thought about pizza.

Carmen leaned in and peered through the peephole.

“Yep,” she whispered. “Delivery guy.”

Shay pushed closer. “Is he holding it?”

“Yeah. Box bag thing.”

My stomach actually fluttered with happiness. It’s embarrassing how much joy a pizza can bring when you’re sixteen and the night feels wide open.

I stepped up and slid the inside light on, because I wanted whoever it was to know we were there, to know we were coming. Then I unlocked the top lock.

Carmen’s hand touched my arm. “Wait, should we ask who ordered it?”

“It’s fine,” I said, because I genuinely believed that. “It’s Papa John’s. It’s probably my parents.”

Shay was already smiling. “If your parents got garlic knots, I’ll forgive them for leaving us.”

I opened the door.

At first, it was exactly what we expected.

A man in a delivery uniform stood on the porch. He had a cap pulled low and a thermal bag in his left hand. The porch light made his face look pale and washed out. He wasn’t old, maybe late twenties or early thirties, but there was something about his stillness that made him seem older. He wasn’t shifting his weight like people usually do. He wasn’t smiling. His eyes flicked past me, past the doorway, into the house like he was counting shapes.

“Evening,” I said, bright and automatic.

He didn’t respond to that. Instead, he tilted his head slightly and asked, in a tone that was wrong in a way I can’t fully explain, “Are you three girls alone in here?”

It was the exact moment the air changed.

The question wasn’t normal. It wasn’t part of any delivery script. It didn’t match the pizza in his hand.

Behind me, Shay went very still. Carmen’s fingers tightened on my arm.

I should have lied.

I know that now. I know it in the way you know you should have grabbed the handrail before you fell. But in the moment, my brain was still running on the assumption that everything made sense.

And Carmen, on instinct, because Carmen always answered things quickly, said, “Yeah. Our parents are at the casino for the weekend.”

The delivery driver’s expression changed immediately.

It wasn’t dramatic. He didn’t grin or laugh. It was subtler than that, which made it worse. His eyes sharpened, like something had clicked into place.

Then he moved.

Fast.

Before I could even step back, he shoved the thermal bag into my chest hard enough to knock the air out of me. My feet slid on the tile. The edge of the door slammed against the wall. He came in with the momentum of someone who’d already decided.

Carmen screamed.

Shay’s hands flew up.

I tried to push him back out, but he was already inside the threshold, already in our space. His shoulder hit mine. His breath smelled like cigarettes and something sour.

“Back,” he said, and it wasn’t loud, but it was sharp. Commanding. “Back up.”

His right hand came out from behind his body holding a knife.

Not a little pocket knife. Not a tool. A kitchen knife with a long blade that caught the porch light and turned it into a thin, bright line.

My entire body locked.

It felt unreal. Like a prop. Like something from the movie still playing silently in my living room.

But Shay made a sound, a low choked noise that told me she understood exactly how real it was.

“Please,” Carmen said immediately, her voice shaking. “Please, take whatever you want. Just, just leave.”

He didn’t look at Carmen.

He looked at me.

Maybe because I was closest. Maybe because it was my house. Maybe because I was standing there with a pizza bag pressed to my chest like I’d been handed a bomb.

“Inside,” he said. “All of you. Move.”

Shay’s eyes met mine. I saw the same thought in them, the same desperate attempt to find an exit, a weapon, an adult, a miracle.

But the house was suddenly a trap. The door behind him. The windows that were too high. The silence outside.

We moved, because the knife made our bodies obey.

He herded us through the entryway into the living room, pushing the door closed with his foot behind him. The click of it shutting sounded too final, like a lock clicking in a prison.

The movie on the TV kept flashing. A character’s face frozen mid-scream in a silent world.

The delivery driver, because I still thought of him that way even as everything shattered, pointed the knife toward the hallway.

“Bedroom,” he said.

Carmen shook her head, crying. “Please, please don’t.”

“Bedroom,” he repeated, louder. “Now.”

We went down the hallway like it was a tunnel narrowing around us. My heart was pounding so hard it made my vision pulse. I could hear Shay breathing in short, sharp bursts. Carmen was sobbing openly, her hands held up as if that could shield her.

The man followed close, the knife angled forward, and I realized, with a cold, horrifying clarity, that he wasn’t improvising. He wasn’t uncertain. He knew where he wanted us.

He pushed us into my parents’ guest bedroom, the one with the beige comforter and the framed desert print on the wall. The room smelled faintly like laundry detergent and unused space.

“On the floor,” he said.

We got down.

The carpet pressed into my knees. The air felt too thick.

He reached into his hoodie and pulled out zip ties.

My stomach dropped again. This wasn’t random.

This wasn’t a guy who snapped at the door.

He had come prepared.

He tied our wrists, tight enough to hurt but not tight enough to cut off circulation, and he did it with a grim efficiency that made my skin crawl. Shay struggled, once, instinctively jerking away, and he raised the knife close to her face in a warning that made her freeze.

“Stop,” he hissed.

He tied our ankles too, then backed toward the door, still holding the knife, eyes darting from face to face like he was watching for movement.

“You scream,” he said, voice low, “and I come back in.”

Then he stepped out and shut the door.

We heard the lock click.

For a second, none of us moved. Not because we didn’t want to. Because our brains couldn’t accept the fact that we were locked inside a bedroom in my own house, tied up, while a stranger with a knife walked freely in the rest of our lives.

Carmen was the first to break. She started shaking violently, tears sliding down her face into the carpet.

Shay leaned toward her as far as she could with her wrists bound. “Carmen. Carmen, look at me. We have to stay quiet.”

Her voice was steady in that way that didn’t match what was happening. It made me want to cry harder. Shay was always the calm one, the one who could talk to teachers without panicking, the one who could stop a fight just by looking at someone.

But this was bigger than us.

I tried to move my wrists. The zip ties bit into my skin. The pain helped keep me grounded.

“What do we do?” I whispered.

Shay’s eyes were wide, shining. “We wait. We listen. We don’t make noise.”

Carmen shook her head, whispering frantically. “He asked if we were alone. He asked. That’s not normal. That’s not, that’s not—”

“I know,” Shay said.

The house beyond the door creaked.

We heard footsteps. Slow. Wandering. Like he was exploring.

Then a drawer opening. A cabinet door. Something clinking.

He was going through our kitchen. Our living room. Our things.

The worst part was the uncertainty. The not knowing where he was. What he was doing. Whether he was bored, whether he was angry, whether he was planning something.

Time stretched. My legs went numb. My hands ached. Carmen’s breathing came in little squeaky bursts as she tried not to sob too loud.

Then we heard him talking.

At first, I thought he was on the phone. But the voice was too close. Too loud.

He was talking to himself.

Words drifting down the hallway, not coherent, fragments and muttering like a radio between stations. It made my scalp prickle. It made the situation feel less like a robbery and more like something unpredictable, something that could change shape without warning.

“Stupid,” he muttered at one point. “Stupid girls. Stupid.”

Carmen squeezed her eyes shut. Shay stared at the door like she could force it to open with her mind.

I kept thinking about the Ring camera, about how my dad would see him. Then I remembered the angle. The porch. The front door. It wouldn’t see him inside. It would see the moment we opened the door, then nothing.

And we’d opened it.

We’d invited the dark in like it was carrying dinner.

I don’t know how long we were in that room. Maybe twenty minutes. Maybe an hour. It felt like a night compressed into a tight space.

Then my phone buzzed.

The sound was tiny, almost nothing, but it was loud in a room where we were all holding our breath.

It was in my pocket.

My heart lurched. I couldn’t reach it with my hands tied.

It buzzed again. And again.

Carmen’s eyes snapped to me, panicked. Shay leaned in, whispering, “Don’t move. Don’t make it worse.”

The buzzing stopped.

A few minutes later, it started again.

This time, longer. Persistent.

My mom’s voice echoed in my head, Keep your phone on.

Dad’s voice, Don’t open the door.

I imagined my parents in a casino, lights flashing, noise everywhere, my mom checking her phone with a little smile like she was being responsible, like she was going to ask how our weekend was going.

I couldn’t answer.

The buzzing stopped.

Then, later, it buzzed again, three times, each one like a pulse.

The third call felt different. It lasted longer. It was insistent. And then it stopped abruptly, as if someone had made a decision.

Outside the bedroom, footsteps moved fast.

The man’s voice rose, angry now, yelling at no one, words slamming into the walls. Then the house went quiet, suddenly, as if he’d realized something.

I stared at the door.

Shay’s voice was barely audible. “My mom would call if I didn’t answer.”

Carmen whispered, “My dad too.”

And then, like a confirmation of our fear, the sound of a phone rang somewhere in the house.

Not mine. Not in the bedroom.

The intruder answered it.

We couldn’t hear the words clearly, but we heard the rhythm. Someone trying to sound normal. Someone trying to imitate.

“Hello?” he said, too cheerful, too quick. Then he paused. “Yeah. Yeah, we’re fine.”

My blood went cold.

He was pretending.

He was pretending to be my dad.

Because the voice was lower now, forced, and he was speaking like an adult on the phone, not like a pizza driver.

I heard my father in my mind, calm and careful, and I heard this stranger trying to wear that voice like a mask.

Then there was silence. Then the man laughed, a short, sharp sound, and hung up.

We sat there, tied up, listening to the house, and the terror shifted shape. It wasn’t just the knife anymore. It was the understanding that he was willing to interact with the world outside, that he could mislead people, that he could buy time.

Then, distant, faint, almost impossible to hear through walls and fear, came a sound that made my eyes fill with tears.

Sirens.

Not the movie. Not the soundtrack.

Real.

Approaching.

Shay closed her eyes and exhaled, one long breath like she’d been holding it for hours. Carmen let out a sound that was half sob, half prayer.

The sirens grew louder, then cut off abruptly, as if the police car had stopped just outside.

The house went still.

Footsteps moved again, quick and purposeful, toward the front door.

We heard the chain slide. The lock. The door opening.

Then a voice.

A man’s voice. Firm. Controlled.

“Sir,” he said, and it echoed faintly down the hallway. “We received a call from this residence. Can you step outside for me?”

The intruder’s voice changed again, deepening, smoothing, trying to become my father.

“There’s no problem,” he said. “I’m the homeowner. Everything’s fine.”

The officer didn’t sound convinced.

“Okay,” the officer said slowly. “Can I see your ID, sir?”

A pause.

A long pause where the house seemed to hold its breath with us.

“I, uh,” the intruder said, and for the first time he sounded unsure. “It’s inside.”

“Then let’s get it,” the officer said, still calm, still firm.

Another pause.

Then, sharper, “I don’t need to show you anything. I told you, I’m the homeowner.”

The officer’s voice hardened slightly. “Sir, the caller is still on the line with dispatch. They are saying you are not the homeowner.”

My stomach flipped.

Dispatch. My dad. The call. He’d called 911.

And the officer knew.

The intruder’s voice turned brittle. “This is ridiculous.”

The officer said, “I’m going to ask you one more time. Show me your ID.”

We heard a shuffle, like someone moving on the porch. Then another voice, a second officer, quieter, saying something we couldn’t make out.

Then the first officer spoke again, louder. “Sir, step back. Keep your hands where I can see them.”

My heartbeat pounded in my ears.

In the bedroom, Shay shifted, trying to rub her wrists against the carpet. Carmen stared at me like her eyes could ask a question she didn’t have words for.

Then we heard it.

A sudden thud, like a body hitting the door frame.

A scuffle. A curse.

The officer shouted something, and then the sound of the front door slammed.

Footsteps pounded inside the house, not wandering now, but running.

The intruder was moving deeper in, away from the porch, away from the police.

Toward us.

Shay’s eyes went wide, her face draining of color.

Carmen began to whimper.

I tried to scoot backward, dragging my bound legs uselessly, until my shoulder hit the bed frame. The wood felt solid and cruel behind me.

The doorknob rattled.

Once.

Twice.

Then the lock clicked, and the door opened a fraction before stopping, caught by something, maybe the officer pushing from the other side, maybe the intruder trying to force it.

A voice filled the hallway, close now, commanding.

“Police,” the officer shouted. “Step away from the door. Step away now.”

The door jerked, then slammed shut again.

Silence.

Then the officer’s footsteps moved fast down the hall, closer, and a key turned in the lock.

The door flew open.

An officer stood there, gun raised, eyes scanning the room, his face taut with concentration and adrenaline. Behind him, another officer, slightly farther back, covering the hallway.

For a second, they looked at us like they couldn’t process the sight. Three girls on the floor, wrists bound, ankles bound, faces streaked with tears.

Then the first officer swore under his breath and rushed in.

“It’s okay,” he said, voice softer now, urgent. “You’re okay. We’ve got you.”

He knelt and began cutting the zip ties with something small and sharp. The plastic snapped. Blood rushed back into my hands in hot, painful tingles.

Shay’s breath came out in a sob she’d been holding in the whole time. Carmen started crying so hard she shook.

“Where is he?” the officer asked, scanning the room again as he freed us. “Did he come in here? Did he leave?”

I tried to speak, but my throat felt sealed.

The officer’s radio crackled. Voices layered over each other, urgent updates about the front of the house, about the backyard, about a suspect moving through side yards, about a vehicle.

A vehicle.

The unknown car.

My dad had seen it. That was what made him call. That was what saved us.

My legs finally freed, I pushed myself upright, dizzy, my knees weak. The officer helped me stand like I was much older than sixteen, like I might collapse into dust.

“Your parents are on the way,” he said. “Stay with us.”

But even as he said it, my eyes drifted past him to the hallway, to the shadows beyond, to the rest of my house, suddenly unfamiliar. Every open doorway looked like a mouth. Every room looked like it could be hiding something.

My brain kept replaying the moment at the door, the way we’d seen a uniform and a pizza bag and assumed it meant safety.

The officer led us out into the living room. The TV was still on, the horror movie still playing silently, characters moving in flickering dread while real life stood in the same space, heavier and colder.

The front door was open. Night air poured in, warm and dry.

Outside, red and blue lights strobed across the stucco walls, turning my yard into a pulsing, surreal scene. Neighbors had stepped out onto their porches, drawn by the commotion, faces lit by the police lights, eyes wide with that distant curiosity people get when danger happens near them but not to them.

I saw my dad’s car skid into the driveway a few minutes later, my parents spilling out like they’d been launched, my mom’s face white, her hands shaking. Carmen’s parents and Shay’s parents arrived too, all of them frantic, voices overlapping, adults suddenly small in the face of something they couldn’t control.

My dad grabbed me, crushing me to his chest so hard it hurt.

“I called,” he kept saying into my hair. “I saw the car. I saw the car. I called.”

My mom’s hands framed my face, checking me like she could fix what she was seeing. “Baby,” she whispered, voice breaking. “Oh my God.”

And all I could think was that I had opened the door.

I had opened it like it was a gift.

Later, after statements and blankets and water bottles we couldn’t drink because our hands shook too much, an officer came over and spoke quietly to my parents. I caught pieces of it. The suspect had fled on foot. They were searching the neighborhood. They had units out. They had a description. They had the vehicle.

I kept staring at the driveway, at the place where the unknown car had been parked earlier, the place my dad saw on the Ring camera.

The window that saved us.

I realized, sitting on the curb with my knees pulled up to my chest, that the most terrifying part wasn’t the knife, or even the bedroom lock.

It was how quickly our brains had filled in a story to make everything feel normal.

A knock.

A uniform.

A pizza bag.

And we had written the rest ourselves.

It made me wonder how many times a day we do that, not just with deliveries, but with everything. How often we assume a thing is safe because it looks like other safe things we’ve seen before.

How often we open doors.

When I finally went inside again, escorted by an officer, the house smelled like cold air and disturbed space. The guest bedroom carpet still showed the faint impressions where we’d been pressed into it. The zip ties, cut and discarded, lay like little broken loops of plastic on the floor.

On the kitchen counter, the pizza bag sat abandoned, the Papa John’s logo facing outward like a cruel joke.

The officer asked if we wanted it thrown away.

I nodded too quickly.

Because I could already see how it would feel in the future, how the sight of that logo would make my stomach turn, how garlic sauce would smell like fear.

I stood in my living room, staring at the front door, and my mind kept replaying the delivery driver’s question, the one that didn’t belong.

Are you three girls alone in here?

It wasn’t just a question. It was a test. A probe. A crack in the surface of the world.

And I realized something that made my chest tighten so hard I could barely breathe.

The scariest thing about that night wasn’t that something bad happened.

It was how easily it could have happened without warning, without reason, without any dramatic signal that we were about to cross a line.

Because nothing about it looked like danger, not until it already was.

And now, every time someone knocks on a door, every time I see a uniform, every time I smell pizza in a hallway, my mind does something it never did before.

It asks what else might be hiding behind what I think I see.

It listens to the quiet outside the house, the desert quiet, the watching quiet, and wonders how many people are out there depending on us to make the mistake first.

How many of them are holding something in one hand and a story in the other, waiting for us to believe the wrong one.",1,1768471158.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

A bunch of the regular vendors are apparently doing a warehouse style clearance to make room for their 2026 stock so there should be some decent deals on home goods and jewelry. It is always a nice excuse to grab a coffee at Laromas and walk around the farm even when the weather is a bit miserable in January. Has anyone been to one of these warehouse specific sales before or is it mostly just the same items as the regular spring markets?

Dear Valued ""Early Access"" Associate,
On behalf of the engineering team here at Garmin, we would like to extend our deepest, most sincere gratitude for your recent $1,100 donation - disguised as an Epix Pro Gen 2 purchase.

Your willingness to pay a significant ""Alpha-tester"" premium has been instrumental in our quest to see if rugged athletes could handle the terrifying brightness of an AMOLED screen without fainting. While you may feel ""abandoned"" now that we’ve perfected the technology and moved the entire software ecosystem to the Fenix 8, please understand that your sacrifice was not in vain. Without your brave willingness to buy a flagship that we intended to discontinue in 14 months, the Fenix 8 owners wouldn't have the polished UI that we’ve decided you aren't allowed to have.

We trust that the initial ""honeymoon phase"" provided ample compensation for the lack of long-term software support. We can only imagine the surge of adrenaline and pure ego-gratification you felt while thrusting your wrist into the personal space of every Tom, Dick, and Harry you encountered. Whether they were trying to enjoy a quiet coffee or were simply trapped next to you on a chairlift, we hope the look of confusion on their faces as you demonstrated ""True Blacks"" and ""Red Shift Mode"" provided a sense of superiority that no firmware update ever could.

Sure, Tom, Dick, and Harry didn't ask to see your watch, but we know you showed them anyway. That’s the Garmin spirit!

As you sit there with your ""legacy"" device, watching the Fenix 8 users enjoy their new interface and leak-proof buttons, take comfort in knowing that you were the bridge we walked over to get to them. We look forward to seeing you at the launch of our next ""revolutionary"" experimental sub-brand, where you can once again pay full price to help us beta-test the year 2027.

I joined an online mothers group associated with my babies due date and the country I live in. The platform, FB, offered community chats via its messenger system for all community pages. I joined the one associated with my due date group. It was great and able to ask questions. 
When the community chats got shut down a number of mothers decided to start a new unmonitored chat….. I was pulled into this new group. 

Things were going well and after some postpartum issues I decided to organise a meet up with the few mums near me in this group. I felt it went well. We got on so organised another. 

During this time the main group became sour for me as for reasons I couldn’t understand, anytime I needed support or wanted to show positives of being a mother I was mercilessly attacked by some mums who were like ‘ringleaders’ 

One of the mums that lives local to me (25F) seemed to notice and became a good friend and someone to lean when the other mums attacked me for any number of parenting choices- like feeding, sleep, self care, day care, meals, return to work- everything I did they had me feel like a terrible mother, and this friend. We would have coffees and play dates for our older children

I ended up leaving the main but she stayed and as I left she started to be the main target for these ‘high school bully’ attacks from grown women 

Fast forward to this week and this mother had had enough of the attacked and ddciddd to say something, I was added to a small facebook chat of other mums from the original group and told to prepare as they had been talking and had all been attacked by the bully women….. I won’t even call them mothers they were vile. 

Anyway in the original chat my friend calked out the bullies however they had retaliation prepared. Turns out my friend was originally part of a group that set out to disgustingly bully those of us they perceived as ‘not normal’… my only crime really being the oldest mum in the group by far 

I found out that prior to meeting this mother in our first meet up she had been equally as critical in their side chat and during the first meetup was tasked to do things like take photos of me while sharing them to the side chat and saying horrible things 

She was extremely remorseful and I am fairly sure I have seen her good side in all the meetups we have had and also been given proof after she saw I was a good person she stopped conversing in those chats but….. how do I get past that? 

At my age I’m limited with the amount of friends  with babies as all my friends with kids have older children now and I felt like I’m losing my village. 

I want to forgive but really, how?

for the record, it is not like I never go and see his parents, i see them like twice a month when we’re in the area. (We travel a lot)

we got into an argument this morning because I turned down the idea of making plans for dinner this weekend with a “I don’t think I want to, but I mostly just don’t want to talk about this right now”. (we got into an argument yesterday because he did not tell me we had plans with his mother and let me make other plans for us which I had to cancel. so I really just wasn’t in the mood to talk about it)

I’ve always been less social than he is. I’m introverted and have been having a rough time with my mental health going into 2026, I’m at my limits and really trying to lessen stress as much as I can. I have a language barrier with his parents and often feel excluded when I’m with them. They’re good people, it’s just difficult. Also, it’s very different than how my family dynamic is. My family is very make set plans every few weeks, while his family makes plans a day or less in advance. I have struggled a lot with the spontaneity throughout our relationship. With all of this, I just haven’t really wanted to hang out with them, or anyone, since christmas.

On his side, I understand. Family is very important to him, and he says he’s getting tired of being asked where I am and he’s worried that they won’t like me. I know he really likes it when we all spend time together. They are also only around us for a few more weeks until we are apart again for a couple months.

i just really wish he would be understanding and accepting that this is how I am right now. I have pushed for the spontaneous coffee visits and dinners in the past, but it just feels like too much right now. He keeps telling me I’m just being avoidant, which I suppose is true, but I think that should be ok for the time being given what I’m dealing with? I just started a new job, with a different language barrier, and I am still physically and emotionally reeling from a difficult diagnosis in 2025. When I told him that I wish he was more understanding of all this, he said I should be accepting of the role his family plays in his life. I understand and support his family being important to him. I never stop him from visiting his family, and he still sees the 2-4 times a week, I just don’t join him for all of that. I still see that as being supporting. He told me I should really put more effort in, and in a way I kinda agree, but I’m also trying to recognize my limits better and set boundaries. I just don’t know if this is the wrong way to do it, I feel guilty.

1qdfgmt,https://www.reddit.com/r/stayawake/comments/1qdfgmt/delivery_driver/,Delivery Driver,"There is a certain kind of quiet you only hear in the desert.

It is not the peaceful kind people post about, not the wide-open silence that makes you feel small in a romantic way. It is the kind of quiet that feels like the world has stepped back a few feet and is watching you. Like the empty space around your house has weight.

My parents’ place sits on the edge of Las Vegas, where the neighborhoods thin out and the streetlights start to feel too far apart. In the day, everything looks sun-bleached and normal. Stucco homes. Gravel yards with neat little succulents. A few palm trees that look like they’re fighting the climate. The horizon is always too clear, the sky always too big.

At night, though, the desert makes the dark feel more intentional.

That weekend, it was supposed to be perfect.

We’d been looking forward to it for weeks, the three of us texting in our group chat like it was a countdown to something sacred. Carmen Lopez had brought two duffel bags, one full of clothes and one full of snacks, because she said she didn’t trust anyone else to pack correctly. Shay Smith had a portable speaker and a stack of horror movies she insisted were “classic,” even though I’d never heard of half of them. And me, Alyssa Short, I had the house.

A whole house.

Just for us.

My parents called it an “Adult Weekend” with that specific tone adults use when they want you to know they’re still cool. My mom had actually said the word casinos like she was saying it for my benefit, like I was supposed to picture them dressed up and happy and out late. They were going with Carmen’s parents and Shay’s parents too. Three couples. A weekend getaway. Dinner reservations. Shows. Slot machines. They made it sound like a group field trip.

They kept telling us all the same thing.

“Don’t open the door for anyone.”

“Don’t leave the backyard gate unlatched.”

“Keep your phones on.”

“Order food, but don’t tell anyone you’re alone.”

My dad said that last one like it was a joke. Like it was a funny little modern rule.

But he said it twice.

By the time their cars pulled away Friday afternoon, the three of us were already on the living room floor with blankets and nail polish and the kind of laughter that makes your stomach hurt.

It felt like freedom in the most teenage way possible. Not dramatic. Not rebellious. Just finally, for once, not being watched.

We made TikToks we never posted. We did face masks that made us look like aliens. Carmen tried to teach Shay and me a dance she swore was easy, and we all almost fell into the coffee table.

Then it was night, and the air-conditioning made the house feel too cold, and the windows turned into black mirrors reflecting our faces back at us.

Shay wanted to watch something scary, because of course she did. She said horror movies were “comforting,” which was the craziest thing I’d ever heard. Carmen argued for a rom-com. I said we could do both, because I didn’t want to fight on our weekend.

We ended up with Shay’s choice first.

The movie was the kind that used silence like a weapon. Long shots of empty hallways. A soundtrack that sounded like distant breathing. The kind of film where every creak in the house feels like it could be part of the story.

Halfway through, Carmen got up and started rummaging in my kitchen cabinets like she owned the place.

“We need pizza,” she announced.

“Obviously,” I said.

My family has a tradition. It sounds silly when I say it out loud, but it’s real. Every weekend, at least once, we get Papa John’s. It started when I was little and my dad was working late all the time. Friday nights were pizza nights, no matter what. It didn’t matter if we were broke. It didn’t matter if we were busy. Papa John’s meant the week was done. It meant we were all in the same room.

So when Carmen said pizza, my brain didn’t even process the possibility of something else. Pizza was normal. Pizza was safe. Pizza was home.

Shay made a face. “I thought Italians hated chain pizza.”

“I’m Italian,” I said, pointing at myself like it was evidence. “And I love it. It’s a family tradition.”

Carmen grinned. “See? Cultural significance.”

We checked the fridge. Nothing that wasn’t a condiment or something my mom would use in a salad. Carmen waved her phone around like she was searching for signal even though the Wi-Fi was fine.

“My mom said they might order us food,” she said. “Like surprise us.”

“My dad said the same,” Shay added.

That settled it in our minds. The idea became a fact. Parents out at casinos, feeling generous, sending pizza to their daughters like a sitcom.

We went back to the living room and waited, half-watching the movie, half-watching our phones, the way you do when you’re expecting something you really want.

At some point, I must have gotten too comfortable. I remember the blankets around my legs, the glow of the TV, Shay’s braids falling forward as she leaned toward the screen. Carmen’s laugh was soft as she whispered a comment about how the main character was making dumb choices.

Then, the knock.

It didn’t sound like it belonged in the movie.

It came from the front door, sharp and real, and it cut through the room in a way that made all three of us freeze.

We looked at each other.

“Pizza,” Carmen mouthed, like she was afraid to say it too loudly.

Shay lowered the volume. The TV became a muted flicker.

Another knock came, a little impatient this time.

We all moved at once, the three of us sliding off the couch like we’d rehearsed it. The living room opened into the entryway, and beyond that was the front door, painted a pale tan that blended into the stucco outside. There was a peephole. There were two locks. There was a small Ring camera my dad had installed after our neighbor’s car got broken into.

We didn’t think about any of that.

We thought about pizza.

Carmen leaned in and peered through the peephole.

“Yep,” she whispered. “Delivery guy.”

Shay pushed closer. “Is he holding it?”

“Yeah. Box bag thing.”

My stomach actually fluttered with happiness. It’s embarrassing how much joy a pizza can bring when you’re sixteen and the night feels wide open.

I stepped up and slid the inside light on, because I wanted whoever it was to know we were there, to know we were coming. Then I unlocked the top lock.

Carmen’s hand touched my arm. “Wait, should we ask who ordered it?”

“It’s fine,” I said, because I genuinely believed that. “It’s Papa John’s. It’s probably my parents.”

Shay was already smiling. “If your parents got garlic knots, I’ll forgive them for leaving us.”

I opened the door.

At first, it was exactly what we expected.

A man in a delivery uniform stood on the porch. He had a cap pulled low and a thermal bag in his left hand. The porch light made his face look pale and washed out. He wasn’t old, maybe late twenties or early thirties, but there was something about his stillness that made him seem older. He wasn’t shifting his weight like people usually do. He wasn’t smiling. His eyes flicked past me, past the doorway, into the house like he was counting shapes.

“Evening,” I said, bright and automatic.

He didn’t respond to that. Instead, he tilted his head slightly and asked, in a tone that was wrong in a way I can’t fully explain, “Are you three girls alone in here?”

It was the exact moment the air changed.

The question wasn’t normal. It wasn’t part of any delivery script. It didn’t match the pizza in his hand.

Behind me, Shay went very still. Carmen’s fingers tightened on my arm.

I should have lied.

I know that now. I know it in the way you know you should have grabbed the handrail before you fell. But in the moment, my brain was still running on the assumption that everything made sense.

And Carmen, on instinct, because Carmen always answered things quickly, said, “Yeah. Our parents are at the casino for the weekend.”

The delivery driver’s expression changed immediately.

It wasn’t dramatic. He didn’t grin or laugh. It was subtler than that, which made it worse. His eyes sharpened, like something had clicked into place.

Then he moved.

Fast.

Before I could even step back, he shoved the thermal bag into my chest hard enough to knock the air out of me. My feet slid on the tile. The edge of the door slammed against the wall. He came in with the momentum of someone who’d already decided.

Carmen screamed.

Shay’s hands flew up.

I tried to push him back out, but he was already inside the threshold, already in our space. His shoulder hit mine. His breath smelled like cigarettes and something sour.

“Back,” he said, and it wasn’t loud, but it was sharp. Commanding. “Back up.”

His right hand came out from behind his body holding a knife.

Not a little pocket knife. Not a tool. A kitchen knife with a long blade that caught the porch light and turned it into a thin, bright line.

My entire body locked.

It felt unreal. Like a prop. Like something from the movie still playing silently in my living room.

But Shay made a sound, a low choked noise that told me she understood exactly how real it was.

“Please,” Carmen said immediately, her voice shaking. “Please, take whatever you want. Just, just leave.”

He didn’t look at Carmen.

He looked at me.

Maybe because I was closest. Maybe because it was my house. Maybe because I was standing there with a pizza bag pressed to my chest like I’d been handed a bomb.

“Inside,” he said. “All of you. Move.”

Shay’s eyes met mine. I saw the same thought in them, the same desperate attempt to find an exit, a weapon, an adult, a miracle.

But the house was suddenly a trap. The door behind him. The windows that were too high. The silence outside.

We moved, because the knife made our bodies obey.

He herded us through the entryway into the living room, pushing the door closed with his foot behind him. The click of it shutting sounded too final, like a lock clicking in a prison.

The movie on the TV kept flashing. A character’s face frozen mid-scream in a silent world.

The delivery driver, because I still thought of him that way even as everything shattered, pointed the knife toward the hallway.

“Bedroom,” he said.

Carmen shook her head, crying. “Please, please don’t.”

“Bedroom,” he repeated, louder. “Now.”

We went down the hallway like it was a tunnel narrowing around us. My heart was pounding so hard it made my vision pulse. I could hear Shay breathing in short, sharp bursts. Carmen was sobbing openly, her hands held up as if that could shield her.

The man followed close, the knife angled forward, and I realized, with a cold, horrifying clarity, that he wasn’t improvising. He wasn’t uncertain. He knew where he wanted us.

He pushed us into my parents’ guest bedroom, the one with the beige comforter and the framed desert print on the wall. The room smelled faintly like laundry detergent and unused space.

“On the floor,” he said.

We got down.

The carpet pressed into my knees. The air felt too thick.

He reached into his hoodie and pulled out zip ties.

My stomach dropped again. This wasn’t random.

This wasn’t a guy who snapped at the door.

He had come prepared.

He tied our wrists, tight enough to hurt but not tight enough to cut off circulation, and he did it with a grim efficiency that made my skin crawl. Shay struggled, once, instinctively jerking away, and he raised the knife close to her face in a warning that made her freeze.

“Stop,” he hissed.

He tied our ankles too, then backed toward the door, still holding the knife, eyes darting from face to face like he was watching for movement.

“You scream,” he said, voice low, “and I come back in.”

Then he stepped out and shut the door.

We heard the lock click.

For a second, none of us moved. Not because we didn’t want to. Because our brains couldn’t accept the fact that we were locked inside a bedroom in my own house, tied up, while a stranger with a knife walked freely in the rest of our lives.

Carmen was the first to break. She started shaking violently, tears sliding down her face into the carpet.

Shay leaned toward her as far as she could with her wrists bound. “Carmen. Carmen, look at me. We have to stay quiet.”

Her voice was steady in that way that didn’t match what was happening. It made me want to cry harder. Shay was always the calm one, the one who could talk to teachers without panicking, the one who could stop a fight just by looking at someone.

But this was bigger than us.

I tried to move my wrists. The zip ties bit into my skin. The pain helped keep me grounded.

“What do we do?” I whispered.

Shay’s eyes were wide, shining. “We wait. We listen. We don’t make noise.”

Carmen shook her head, whispering frantically. “He asked if we were alone. He asked. That’s not normal. That’s not, that’s not—”

“I know,” Shay said.

The house beyond the door creaked.

We heard footsteps. Slow. Wandering. Like he was exploring.

Then a drawer opening. A cabinet door. Something clinking.

He was going through our kitchen. Our living room. Our things.

The worst part was the uncertainty. The not knowing where he was. What he was doing. Whether he was bored, whether he was angry, whether he was planning something.

Time stretched. My legs went numb. My hands ached. Carmen’s breathing came in little squeaky bursts as she tried not to sob too loud.

Then we heard him talking.

At first, I thought he was on the phone. But the voice was too close. Too loud.

He was talking to himself.

Words drifting down the hallway, not coherent, fragments and muttering like a radio between stations. It made my scalp prickle. It made the situation feel less like a robbery and more like something unpredictable, something that could change shape without warning.

“Stupid,” he muttered at one point. “Stupid girls. Stupid.”

Carmen squeezed her eyes shut. Shay stared at the door like she could force it to open with her mind.

I kept thinking about the Ring camera, about how my dad would see him. Then I remembered the angle. The porch. The front door. It wouldn’t see him inside. It would see the moment we opened the door, then nothing.

And we’d opened it.

We’d invited the dark in like it was carrying dinner.

I don’t know how long we were in that room. Maybe twenty minutes. Maybe an hour. It felt like a night compressed into a tight space.

Then my phone buzzed.

The sound was tiny, almost nothing, but it was loud in a room where we were all holding our breath.

It was in my pocket.

My heart lurched. I couldn’t reach it with my hands tied.

It buzzed again. And again.

Carmen’s eyes snapped to me, panicked. Shay leaned in, whispering, “Don’t move. Don’t make it worse.”

The buzzing stopped.

A few minutes later, it started again.

This time, longer. Persistent.

My mom’s voice echoed in my head, Keep your phone on.

Dad’s voice, Don’t open the door.

I imagined my parents in a casino, lights flashing, noise everywhere, my mom checking her phone with a little smile like she was being responsible, like she was going to ask how our weekend was going.

I couldn’t answer.

The buzzing stopped.

Then, later, it buzzed again, three times, each one like a pulse.

The third call felt different. It lasted longer. It was insistent. And then it stopped abruptly, as if someone had made a decision.

Outside the bedroom, footsteps moved fast.

The man’s voice rose, angry now, yelling at no one, words slamming into the walls. Then the house went quiet, suddenly, as if he’d realized something.

I stared at the door.

Shay’s voice was barely audible. “My mom would call if I didn’t answer.”

Carmen whispered, “My dad too.”

And then, like a confirmation of our fear, the sound of a phone rang somewhere in the house.

Not mine. Not in the bedroom.

The intruder answered it.

We couldn’t hear the words clearly, but we heard the rhythm. Someone trying to sound normal. Someone trying to imitate.

“Hello?” he said, too cheerful, too quick. Then he paused. “Yeah. Yeah, we’re fine.”

My blood went cold.

He was pretending.

He was pretending to be my dad.

Because the voice was lower now, forced, and he was speaking like an adult on the phone, not like a pizza driver.

I heard my father in my mind, calm and careful, and I heard this stranger trying to wear that voice like a mask.

Then there was silence. Then the man laughed, a short, sharp sound, and hung up.

We sat there, tied up, listening to the house, and the terror shifted shape. It wasn’t just the knife anymore. It was the understanding that he was willing to interact with the world outside, that he could mislead people, that he could buy time.

Then, distant, faint, almost impossible to hear through walls and fear, came a sound that made my eyes fill with tears.

Sirens.

Not the movie. Not the soundtrack.

Real.

Approaching.

Shay closed her eyes and exhaled, one long breath like she’d been holding it for hours. Carmen let out a sound that was half sob, half prayer.

The sirens grew louder, then cut off abruptly, as if the police car had stopped just outside.

The house went still.

Footsteps moved again, quick and purposeful, toward the front door.

We heard the chain slide. The lock. The door opening.

Then a voice.

A man’s voice. Firm. Controlled.

“Sir,” he said, and it echoed faintly down the hallway. “We received a call from this residence. Can you step outside for me?”

The intruder’s voice changed again, deepening, smoothing, trying to become my father.

“There’s no problem,” he said. “I’m the homeowner. Everything’s fine.”

The officer didn’t sound convinced.

“Okay,” the officer said slowly. “Can I see your ID, sir?”

A pause.

A long pause where the house seemed to hold its breath with us.

“I, uh,” the intruder said, and for the first time he sounded unsure. “It’s inside.”

“Then let’s get it,” the officer said, still calm, still firm.

Another pause.

Then, sharper, “I don’t need to show you anything. I told you, I’m the homeowner.”

The officer’s voice hardened slightly. “Sir, the caller is still on the line with dispatch. They are saying you are not the homeowner.”

My stomach flipped.

Dispatch. My dad. The call. He’d called 911.

And the officer knew.

The intruder’s voice turned brittle. “This is ridiculous.”

The officer said, “I’m going to ask you one more time. Show me your ID.”

We heard a shuffle, like someone moving on the porch. Then another voice, a second officer, quieter, saying something we couldn’t make out.

Then the first officer spoke again, louder. “Sir, step back. Keep your hands where I can see them.”

My heartbeat pounded in my ears.

In the bedroom, Shay shifted, trying to rub her wrists against the carpet. Carmen stared at me like her eyes could ask a question she didn’t have words for.

Then we heard it.

A sudden thud, like a body hitting the door frame.

A scuffle. A curse.

The officer shouted something, and then the sound of the front door slammed.

Footsteps pounded inside the house, not wandering now, but running.

The intruder was moving deeper in, away from the porch, away from the police.

Toward us.

Shay’s eyes went wide, her face draining of color.

Carmen began to whimper.

I tried to scoot backward, dragging my bound legs uselessly, until my shoulder hit the bed frame. The wood felt solid and cruel behind me.

The doorknob rattled.

Once.

Twice.

Then the lock clicked, and the door opened a fraction before stopping, caught by something, maybe the officer pushing from the other side, maybe the intruder trying to force it.

A voice filled the hallway, close now, commanding.

“Police,” the officer shouted. “Step away from the door. Step away now.”

The door jerked, then slammed shut again.

Silence.

Then the officer’s footsteps moved fast down the hall, closer, and a key turned in the lock.

The door flew open.

An officer stood there, gun raised, eyes scanning the room, his face taut with concentration and adrenaline. Behind him, another officer, slightly farther back, covering the hallway.

For a second, they looked at us like they couldn’t process the sight. Three girls on the floor, wrists bound, ankles bound, faces streaked with tears.

Then the first officer swore under his breath and rushed in.

“It’s okay,” he said, voice softer now, urgent. “You’re okay. We’ve got you.”

He knelt and began cutting the zip ties with something small and sharp. The plastic snapped. Blood rushed back into my hands in hot, painful tingles.

Shay’s breath came out in a sob she’d been holding in the whole time. Carmen started crying so hard she shook.

“Where is he?” the officer asked, scanning the room again as he freed us. “Did he come in here? Did he leave?”

I tried to speak, but my throat felt sealed.

The officer’s radio crackled. Voices layered over each other, urgent updates about the front of the house, about the backyard, about a suspect moving through side yards, about a vehicle.

A vehicle.

The unknown car.

My dad had seen it. That was what made him call. That was what saved us.

My legs finally freed, I pushed myself upright, dizzy, my knees weak. The officer helped me stand like I was much older than sixteen, like I might collapse into dust.

“Your parents are on the way,” he said. “Stay with us.”

But even as he said it, my eyes drifted past him to the hallway, to the shadows beyond, to the rest of my house, suddenly unfamiliar. Every open doorway looked like a mouth. Every room looked like it could be hiding something.

My brain kept replaying the moment at the door, the way we’d seen a uniform and a pizza bag and assumed it meant safety.

The officer led us out into the living room. The TV was still on, the horror movie still playing silently, characters moving in flickering dread while real life stood in the same space, heavier and colder.

The front door was open. Night air poured in, warm and dry.

Outside, red and blue lights strobed across the stucco walls, turning my yard into a pulsing, surreal scene. Neighbors had stepped out onto their porches, drawn by the commotion, faces lit by the police lights, eyes wide with that distant curiosity people get when danger happens near them but not to them.

I saw my dad’s car skid into the driveway a few minutes later, my parents spilling out like they’d been launched, my mom’s face white, her hands shaking. Carmen’s parents and Shay’s parents arrived too, all of them frantic, voices overlapping, adults suddenly small in the face of something they couldn’t control.

My dad grabbed me, crushing me to his chest so hard it hurt.

“I called,” he kept saying into my hair. “I saw the car. I saw the car. I called.”

My mom’s hands framed my face, checking me like she could fix what she was seeing. “Baby,” she whispered, voice breaking. “Oh my God.”

And all I could think was that I had opened the door.

I had opened it like it was a gift.

Later, after statements and blankets and water bottles we couldn’t drink because our hands shook too much, an officer came over and spoke quietly to my parents. I caught pieces of it. The suspect had fled on foot. They were searching the neighborhood. They had units out. They had a description. They had the vehicle.

I kept staring at the driveway, at the place where the unknown car had been parked earlier, the place my dad saw on the Ring camera.

The window that saved us.

I realized, sitting on the curb with my knees pulled up to my chest, that the most terrifying part wasn’t the knife, or even the bedroom lock.

It was how quickly our brains had filled in a story to make everything feel normal.

A knock.

A uniform.

A pizza bag.

And we had written the rest ourselves.

It made me wonder how many times a day we do that, not just with deliveries, but with everything. How often we assume a thing is safe because it looks like other safe things we’ve seen before.

How often we open doors.

When I finally went inside again, escorted by an officer, the house smelled like cold air and disturbed space. The guest bedroom carpet still showed the faint impressions where we’d been pressed into it. The zip ties, cut and discarded, lay like little broken loops of plastic on the floor.

On the kitchen counter, the pizza bag sat abandoned, the Papa John’s logo facing outward like a cruel joke.

The officer asked if we wanted it thrown away.

I nodded too quickly.

Because I could already see how it would feel in the future, how the sight of that logo would make my stomach turn, how garlic sauce would smell like fear.

I stood in my living room, staring at the front door, and my mind kept replaying the delivery driver’s question, the one that didn’t belong.

Are you three girls alone in here?

It wasn’t just a question. It was a test. A probe. A crack in the surface of the world.

And I realized something that made my chest tighten so hard I could barely breathe.

The scariest thing about that night wasn’t that something bad happened.

It was how easily it could have happened without warning, without reason, without any dramatic signal that we were about to cross a line.

Because nothing about it looked like danger, not until it already was.

And now, every time someone knocks on a door, every time I see a uniform, every time I smell pizza in a hallway, my mind does something it never did before.

It asks what else might be hiding behind what I think I see.

It listens to the quiet outside the house, the desert quiet, the watching quiet, and wonders how many people are out there depending on us to make the mistake first.

How many of them are holding something in one hand and a story in the other, waiting for us to believe the wrong one.",1,1768470660.0,stayawake,0,1.0,False
1qdffrz,https://www.reddit.com/r/CastleTV/comments/1qdffrz/the_great_love_story_episode_324_knockout_my/,"The Great Love Story: Episode 3/24- ""Knockout."" (My Version, With A Twist): A Story that fills the gap between Kate and Rick leaving the hangar and being at the Funeral.","**For me, there are two iconic episodes in the 8 seasons of Castle. The first one being ""Always,"" which led to Kate and Rick becoming Caskett. The second one is ""Knockout,"" which eventually moved their love story in the direction of ""Always."" As I did in my last story about the episode ""Time of Our Lives"" where I filled the gap between the precinct and their wedding vows, I'm attempting to do that here. Because a 43-minute TV show has limits to what they can squeeze into an episode. They have to cut out what could have been meaningful dialogue or information, just to move things along. I haven't always agreed on what is cut out and not cut out. In this particular episode ""Knockout"" we have a tremendous gap from the hangar to the funeral. As we well know, there would've been at least 3-4 days before the funeral could be organized.**

**What happened in those few days? We see Kate, giving the eulogy, and pointedly looking at Castle and saying, ""And if your very lucky, you find somebody willing to stand with you,"" but last we saw was Caskett's argument saying they were over, her asking Montgomery to get rid of him, and then Castle dragging her out of the hangar. What could have happened between the hangar and the funeral? What could have changed her mind, from wanting him gone, to Kate asking him in a pointed look to stand beside her?**

**That's what fanfiction is all about, and the great writers (I'm not one of them) that are out there are huge fans of these two characters as am I, and we always know there is ""More to the Story."" This is my different twist on how things could have played out.**

**xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx**

They drive in silence, not a word uttered since she asked him if he needed a ride home. Her body was a whirlwind of emotion's now. Anger, betrayal, loss, sadness... such immense sadness. The loss of her mentor, father figure, friend, her pain ran deep. She took a sideways glance at the man sitting next to her. Stone faced and silent... oh so silent. She barely recognized him, their fight still fresh in her mind. She had yelled at him, ""*You think you know me Castle, but you don't*."" What a joke that had been. He knew her better than anyone, other than her Dad.

What a long night, she thought. The boys had arrived first, ""Thank God."" They had a cursory discussion of the basics, just enough to get them thru the night, as CSU and I.A. would be crawling up their butts soon, and as expected they'd been barraged with questions about what happened, and by the time people were mostly satisfied, a long night had just been made longer. It was going on 3A.M. and her body felt like it was just shutting down on her. ""God,"" she thought, ""I need to get home.""

Kate drove her Crown Vic and pulled up in front of Castle's loft. Castle started to get out of the car; Kate grabbed him by his arm. Castle glanced down at her hand, then up to her face, ""Castle...The next few days are going to be a blur,"" Kate fighting the tears that want to come, ""I have to talk to Evelyn Montgomery, she has to decide who'll be the pall bearers, who does the eulogy, and I'll have to coordinate that with the honor procession, but I'm going to need to talk with you and the boys before that. We need to protect Roy at all costs. Will you be available to come over maybe tomorrow?""

Castle stares at her for a brief second and asks, ""So I take it that we're not over like you said earlier?""

She huffs, ""Obviously not, considering you're in my car and I drove you home.""

""Just checking...I'll wait for your call, if you need anything, in the meantime, don't hesitate to reach out if you do.""

""Talk to you tomorrow, Castle,"" as he shuts the door. She looks at Castle as Edwardo swings the door open for him. He's moving slowly, shoulders hunched, hands in pockets of his jacket.  She knew he was as devasted as she was. She had been so angry at him at first, for dragging her out of the hangar, but with some time to think, she realized that as usual, even after she kicked him out of her life, he had been there for her, and honored Montgomery's wishes. It was almost an unattainable position to be put in, with no right answer, and she feels such sadness for him as she feels for herself right now.

30 minutes later Kate pulls into her parking spot at her apartment, she looks at her watch and sees its almost 4 am. She places her hands on the steering wheel... lays her head against it, and the tears that have been bottled up for the last few hours, come strong and unrelenting. As her tears ebb, she glances up to the rear-view mirror and barely recognizes the mess of the woman staring back at her. Face red and blotched, mascara running, and eye lids heavy. Her body screams at her to decompress; she wants the world to stop spinning for just one second, and she wonders, ""Is that asking too much?""

She gets out of the car a few minutes later, which seems like hours, and wipes the remaining tears with the back of her jacket sleeve. ""So tired... fuck, I'm so tired."" No shower tonight, straight to bed, maybe she won't even take her clothes off. Kate unlocks her door, and staggers thru, turns to lock it and lays her head against the frame of the door. As she mentally collects herself, she hears a noise. Like lightning she turns around...gun out, raised up to meet the intruder, and then she hears, ""Jesus Kate, put the gun down."" She stares, thinking to herself, ""You've got to be fucking kidding me."" She lowers her gun and puts the safety on, places it on the kitchen counter, then she snaps, ""Josh, what the hell are you doing here.""

He stands, still in doctor scrubs, running his hands thru his hair, ""I heard thru the grapevine, that Montgomery was killed tonight, and I figured you'd be involved, so I thought I would come over and be a shoulder to cry on."" He approaches her, arms out to press her to him, but she wants none of that, she shoves his hands away, strides across the room, turns around with her hands on her hips, finding the last bit of energy she has left. ""When did I, all of a sudden become the damsel in distress, and what right do you have to use a key that was for emergencies only. What were you thinking?""

""Jesus Kate,"" he huffs. ""I just wanted to be here for you, and I didn't think you'd mind that I let myself in.""

Shaking her head, thinking tonight of all nights, ""That key was not for you to decide when and where you would deem it necessary enough to come over. My body is about to shut down, and I don't need any of this bullshit. I just want to go and collapse in my bed."" She turns around to head into her bedroom when she hears him shuffling behind her. She looks over her shoulder and sees he's starting to get out of his scrubs. Kate turns on him, ""What the hell do you think you're doing?"" she says in exasperation.

Josh, agitated now, ""Getting ready to go to bed. What's the problem here?""

Kate closes her eyes, trying her best to not just explode, trying to find some inner peace, she takes a deep breath, and her mind goes back to a letter that sits hidden in her drawer. Creases sharp...sharp enough to cut, from all the times she opened and closed it. The letter from Royce:

""*Risking our hearts are why we're alive, the last thing you want to do is to look back on your life and wonder...If Only.""*

""How had he seen that,"" she thought to herself. ""How had he seen that Castle and she had something real in their brief encounter with Royce 7 months ago. Why do people keep seeing what they themselves are too afraid to see."" She looks back at Josh, who's waiting impatiently, tapping his foot on the floor like a petulant child. Kate remembering the argument with Castle, she thinks to herself, ""Was that just hours ago, because it felt like days,"" his words still echoing in her head:

*""Just like you hide in these nowhere relationships, with men... you don't love!""*

""Enough of this,"" Kate snaps, she brushes past Josh, and heads out to the kitchen, she realizes that she's running on adrenaline only, she hears him dutifully following her. She reaches over to her keys that lay on the kitchen counter. Josh watches her as she grabs his apartment key from her key ring and slides it off. She places it in his hand, and says, ""This,"" she waves her finger back and forth between them, "" This is never going to work, and I hate myself that I let it go on longer than I should have. Sometimes...sometimes I feel like this has been a yearlong booty call. Hell, we haven't even talked Josh, since I returned from L.A."" An argument where Josh had yelled at her about not telling him where she was, and of course him finding out that Castle had gone with her. He had stormed out, before she even had a chance to explain, and the funny thing was, is that she had only felt relief, and hadn't really cared.

Josh snarks back, ""And who's fault was that?""

""Apparently mine, as you seem to keep throwing it in my face, which goes back to what I'm trying to say. Look, I've spent as much time hiding in this relationship as I've spent in it, and you deserve better than that. You're a really nice guy Josh, and it's been fun, but you're never going to be the one that I will ever want to run to, and I'm never going to love you.... I'm just not! So, please give me my key back, and let a horrible day not get any worse, and let me go to bed...Alone!""

Josh fumbles with his key chain, and tosses her key roughly on the counter, ""I tried to make you happy Kate. Hell, I even stayed for you when I was supposed to go to Haiti, but I always felt that making you happy was always going to be a losing proposition, and that I was always going to come in second...You're in love with him aren't you, just admit it?"" Neither of them had to say the name of the big elephant in the room, it had always been a constant source of arguments between them...Kate, stands face to face with Josh, then looks away and down to the floor, remaining ever silent. ""Yeah,"" he says, ""That's what I thought."" He turns to walk away, then glances over his shoulder on the way out, all his venom is gone, just sadness now, ""I'd say please return anything that I've left here, but I don't think there is anything, which if you think about it, sums up this whole relationship. I hope he makes you happy Katie,"" and with that he leaves, the door silently closing, with a finality that speaks much more, than just the click of a lock.

Kate heaves a big sigh, then turns on her heels and heads to the beckoning call of her bed...if there is one thing that happened right today, it was this. She shakes her head and thinks just how shitty of a day she's had. She staggers into her bedroom, plops down, and curls into a fetal position... grabs her pillow like a long-lost lover, her heart actually feeling slightly lighter. She briefly thinks of Castle, and knows deep-down, that he's the only one she would ever run too. Kate hopes that she just might be able to sleep tonight.... She doesn't.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Castle had paced all morning, holding his damn phone in his hand, getting looks from his daughter, waiting for a call. He didn't get a wink of sleep, and it shows, and he feels it. He pounded multiple cups of coffee this morning, trying to clear his head, a cacophony of thoughts swirling and whirling, bouncing around in his writer's brain...a brain that never shuts down, and he keeps going over and over the argument, and the hangar, and just about every damn thing. He keeps replaying it all. Could he have said something else, could he have handled things differently, but when it all plays out in his head, he feels that events played out the only way they could have, and he's not sorry. He won't ever be sorry, when it comes to saving her life. He loves her, he knows that, and she will always be his first priority, whether she likes it or not.

It's going on 2:00 pm when he breaks from his torturous musings and his phone rings. He looks and sees the picture of her...a bright smile adorns her face; she looks so beautiful. He clicks on the phone and answers, ""Castle.""

On the other end he hears Kate ask, ""Can you come over now? The boys will be here in about an hour.""

""I'll be there shortly.""

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

When the boys first arrived, she had made them coffee, everyone seemed to be walking on eggshells, not knowing what to say or how to say it. After what seemed to be an eternity, the boys in her life sat across from her, their looks varying from hardened to lost. Kate gathered up the courage to speak, Castle looked at her and saw that no make-up could hide the fact that she hadn't slept, deep hollows underscored her eyes. ""Had any of them slept?"" he doubts it.

Kate clears her throat, ""I spent the early part pf this morning talking with Evelyn about Roy, kind of going over what happened without really saying too much. I'm not sure, that she bought it, I think she knows that there was a lot more to this, but she didn't push. The funeral she thinks will take place in about 3-4 days, and she wants all of us to be pall bearers. She said a couple of Roy's partners from when he was a detective would fill out the rest."" Kate says, with a tremor in her voice, ""She wants me to do the eulogy,"" then she looked at Castle and said, ""Castle... Evelyn asked if you would be one of the speakers too.""

""Tell Evelyn that I'd be honored Kate,"" he says softly.

""Good...That's good Castle... thank you.""

""I'm going to add one more thing here, and you guys need to listen good. *""No one...No one outside of this immediate family ever needs to know about this, as far as this world is concerned Roy Montgomery died a Hero. We owe it to him...All of us.""*

Kate looked at her two boys, the grief they were showing, each one in their own way. Javi, who looked like he wanted to punch a hole in the world, and Kevin, who had tears in his eyes looking lost and confused, and then there was Castle...""Her Castle,"" who looked empty like a dark void in space. ""Everyone understand?"" Kate asks.

There was a silent nod between them. ""Okay guys, unless there's something you want to get off your chest, because this is the time to do it."" They all nod no. ""Then I think we'll wrap this up, and I'll keep you updated on the funeral."" Espo and Ryan make their way to the door and let themselves out. She sees that Castle has cleared the coffee cups and was placing them in the sink. She shook her and smiled to herself, ""It's just like him."" She notices that Castle starts to move to the door, ""Rick, would you mind sticking around for a minute please?""

Castle, his eyes flirting with a glance down at his feet, her calling him Rick catching him by surprise, ""Sure Kate, whatever you need.""

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Kate leads him back to her sofa; they take opposite ends of the couch. Kate places her arm against the back of the sofa and places her head in the palm of her hand. Castle notices the irony of the situation, as it reminds him literally of the same moment, they had on the couch a month ago in L.A. where things seemed to be simmering until she got up and waked away. Considering he doesn't believe in cheating, he was never sure just what would have happened if she had walked back thru that door, but it's not like his writer's brain hadn't conjured up possible scenarios. It's obvious that she wants to talk so he gives her time.

Kate jumps up off the couch, and blurts out, ""I think I want some wine, do you want some wine?""

It catches Castle a little off guard, but he senses she needs it. ""My God,"" he thinks to himself, ""is this her telling him again that their over?"" he doesn't think he'd survive that. ""Yeah, if you're having some, then that sounds good.""

Kate pours a couple of healthy glasses, Castle almost blanches at the amount. ""This is going to be serious conversation,"" he thinks.

Kate sits back down and takes a big gulp of wine, so does Castle, preparing for the worse. ""After our argument the other day,"" she starts looking anywhere but at him. ""I went to Montgomery and asked him to get rid of you,"" She still won't look at him.

""OooKay""...Stunned doesn't even describe the way that hits him, ""Is that what this is all about, because you already told me we were thru, so is this some kind weird way to... rub it in?""

""Jesus Castle"", she takes another big gulp, stands up and paces, then turns around and looks down at him, with her arms crossed over her chest, defensively. ""We've already been thru this; you wouldn't be here if we were thru. Just let me finish, will you?"" Castle shrugs but says nothing.

""I was furious with you, I felt like everything was collapsing in on me, and you asking me to drop my mother's case was like the final straw, a stab in the back, and I just lost it. When I asked Roy to get rid of you, I wanted to take those words back the minute I said them."" Kate trying to implore Castle to understand.

Castle sits there, kind of out of his depth. They normally didn't talk like this, and inside his stomach was churning. ""Damn writers' brain!"" He thinks to himself.

Kate continues, ""But before I could say anything Roy said, ""*You want Castle gone? He's Gone. This is my house, Kate; the major doesn't call the shots...I do, you oughta know that by now. I could have kicked Castle to the curb years ago; the reason I kept him around was...I saw how good he was for you. Kate...you're the best I've ever trained, maybe the best I've ever seen, but you weren't having any fun until he came along.""* Kate sighs, ""He was right Castle, I wasn't, but at the time I was just so pissed, I couldn't even think straight.""

Castle, his words biting, ""Yeah...well I am the school's funniest kid, so that makes sense.""

Kate barks back, ""Knock it off Castle, I'm trying to say I'm sorry, besides, you gave as good as you got. I lost it after you asked me to drop the case, your my partner, and you wanted me to give up something that's driven me for years. Of all people I thought you would always have my back.""

""Kate,"" Castle says rubbing his hands over his face in frustration, ""I didn't feel much like a partner yesterday, the way you were yelling at every one...The boys, Montgomery and you were ignoring my phone calls, so no, I didn't feel much like a partner. Besides, I was compelled to say what I did, even though I knew it risked our partnership.""

""What...are you telling me, that you had no choice?""

""That's exactly what I'm telling you.""

Kate almost inhaling her wine now, starts pacing back and forth, ""You're really going to have to explain that one to me, because you always have a choice.""

Castle calmly replies, ""I'm not going to talk to you while you're hovering over me, my neck is getting a cramp.""

Kate plunks her butt down on her couch in a huff, ""Fine... Talk!""

Castle holds out his pinky finger and extends it to Kate. She looks at it like it grew out of the side of his head. 'What's that for?"" she asks incredulously.

""Because what I'm about to say to you, cannot be repeated, and I won't tell you until you pinky swear.""

Kate rubs her hands thru her hair and snorts, ""You're got to be kidding me, right?""

Castle calmly replies, ""Not kidding, pinky swear, and no fingers crossed, or this is a conversation that you and I won't be having.""

""God your so fucking frustrating,"" she's yelling now. ""I swear you do this to test my patience...You're the most frustrating person I've ever met."" Kate sees a smirk on his face; ""Richard Castle, don't you dare smirk at me.""  ""Oh Yeah,"" she thinks to herself, ""He knows what he does to her, and if she wasn't so pissed she would smile too."" She glances back at him and sees he continues to remain silent with his hand extended. She whips her hand out and grabs his pinky finger roughly with hers and wiggles her other hand in front him. ""See, no fingers crossed, you big baby... now start talking.""

Castle blurts out in what seemed like one long running sentence, ""Your Dad came to see me the other night, just before our fight.""

""What...What, what are you talking about...How does he even know where you live?""

""He's a lawyer Beckett, and he's smart, so it probably wasn't too hard for him to find me, and believe me, I was as surprised as you are now.""

Maybe it's a lack of sleep, because her mind can't seem to wrap its head around any of this, ""What could he have possibly wanted from you?""

""I wondered the same thing. We sat down at my table, and he said, ""Rick I feel like I already know you, from all the great things Katie's said about you."" He notices that Kate looks down as her hair falls over her face, cheeks turning pink. ""Then he asks me about Lockwood, and what kind of man he was.""

Kate looks back up at him with concern, ""What did you say?""

Castle sighs, ""I told him the truth, one father to another, that the man you were after was a trained killer, and I thought he was going to vomit.""

""Jesus' Castle did you really need to tell him that?"" she snaps at him.

""Yes,"" he barks out catching Kate off guard not used to him raising his voice like that. ""Damn right I was going to tell him the truth. I'm a father Kate, and I would want someone to tell me if this was about Alexis. I'm not going to lie to your father. It's just not going to happen.""

She feels that she has no fight left in her. She's tired of all the death surrounding her. She's tired of the fact that there is no movement on her mother's case, she's tired of the fact that she wasted 9 months on a relationship that was never going to work, and she's so tired of arguing with this man who means so much to her. So, she quiets her mind, takes a deep breath and says, ""Was that it. Was that all he had to say?"" Kate whispers back.

Castle sensing a change in her demeanor, calmly says, ""No, then your dad got up and says, ""Look Rick... Katie cares about you, and unless your dumber than you look, you care about her too."" Then your dad paused for a second and says, ""Don't let her throw her life away."" Then Castle huffs, ""Not sure I like that whole dumber than you look statement."" Kate wants to laugh, but this is kind of all too much right now. Castle continues, ""The whole time he's talking to me I'm thinking, why isn't he talking to Dr. Motorcycle Boy, the man you've thrown in my face more than once. Why is he talking to me?"" Castle realizes that he sounds like he's whining.

Kate heaves a big sigh and extends her arm along the back of her couch and places her fingers into the palm of Castles hand. Castle looked bewildered, they just don't do this kind of stuff. Kate runs her fingers back and forth against his palm. She looks up to Castle and changing the subject says. ""I introduced Josh to my dad not long after the bombing incident. He kept asking me why I hadn't let him meet my dad, and at that time I was trying to be better for him, considering he didn't go to Haiti and all that, but I got the distinct impression that my dad was not a fan. He didn't say anything, but he has his tells, and I didn't ask because I guess I didn't want to know.""

Kate continues, ""I broke with Josh the other day after the hangar. He was waiting for me when I got home. I'd given him a key for emergencies only and he took upon himself to wait for me as I walked in. Needless to say, things went downhill fast from there, especially after the night we already had."" She sees that Castle is still preoccupied with watching her fingers around his, ""I'm sorry Castle, for throwing him in your face, I just suck at this relationship stuff.  Plus, you scare me Rick, and I think I kept running back to him to keep me from doing something stupid like running to you, because that's what I wanted to do.""

Castle his voice pitching higher, and sounding kind of girly, ""Why do I scare you, Kate?""

Kate bites her lower lip, trying to find the courage to be honest. ""Because, I can't have one foot out the door with you Castle, I wouldn't be able to run away. You're a man that's all in... all the time, and that kind of commitment scares the hell out of me, and yet, I find myself wanting to dive into it with you, and I kind of wanted you to say that the other day, but instead you rambled on about your being my friend and partner. I wanted more from you Castle, I needed more... Someone told me recently that risking our hearts are why were alive, and that we don't want to look back on our lives and wonder, if only. At the end of the day Castle, I don't want my life to be filled with regret. I want to be more than I am, and I needed you to step up. Their palms are now kissing each other, warm embers run up and down her arm. She sees Castle lower his head almost apologetically.

He sighs, ""Kate... I'm sorry, but you've been running away from me all year... the freezer, the bomb, always letting me know that Josh was such a great human being There was no way I was going to tell you how much you mean to me, I was afraid to have it thrown back in my face. I'm sorry I was such a coward, I just didn't think you felt the same way.""

""I'm sorry too Castle."" She slides over next to him, thighs touching, and lays her head against his chest, he wraps his arms around her, his embrace feels like a warm blanket... and it feels like coming home. Kate whispers ""I'm scared Castle, I don't want to lose what we have.""

Castle looks down at her, ""I'm scared too Kate,"" she looks up at him, ""Yeah?"" Castle continues, ""Of course I am, we're both human Kate. We make mistakes. There's always going to be some inner turmoil over something new. We'll just have to live with the questions and find our way... but personally I think that we'll be amazing.""

Kate looks up at him and smiles, ""I think so too, but I still want to find out who's behind my mother's murder, and I'm going to need my partner in order to see this thru. You know I can't just ignore this.""

He looks down into those amazing gold flecked eyes...eyes that seem to change with her emotions and moods, sometimes green, sometimes brown, but always beautiful. He gathers his thoughts to come up with something that will work for both of them. That keeps her safe...Keeps them safe:

""Kate, you're the most extraordinary woman I've ever met,"" her eyes are now locked on him, ""As much as I've always been attracted to your beauty,"" then he chuckles, ""And yes your body."" She smirks at him, but smiles, ""It's how your mind works, along with your compassion and heart that has always drawn me to you. Always will, but when your mother's case rears its ugly head, that is when you're at your worst."" he can see that she wants to interject, so he rushes along. ""Kate, you literally went down the rabbit whole the other day, you were shutting out everyone that cares about you. You spoke like your death had no meaning, and that you would willingly die for your cause, but I'm telling you now that, charging off blindly, waving your gun around, plays directly into the Dragon's hands. I want to help you... I will help you, and I will always be there for you. The boys want to help you too, but we need to do this with forethought and planning. Something that keeps the Dragon in the dark, until we can take him down, but also keeps us all alive.""

""How bout this,"" as he looks down on her, ""When the funeral is all over, and we have a chance to grieve for Roy, and get our minds right, we'll come back here, order some take-out and put our collective heads together and talk about us and where we go from here, and then form some kind of game plan on how to handle your mother's case.""

Kate talking into his chest, mumbles, ""Sounds like a plan. I'd like that very much."" Kate closes her eyes, ""I'm so tired Castle.""

He places a gentle kiss to her head, ""Then sleep Kate."" After only a few minutes he hears a slight snuffling noise from her and realizes that she has indeed fallen asleep. He smiles at the sounds she's making, it's adorable, but he'll keep that to himself fearing permanent ear damage. He's always believed in the Universe, and how it makes the unthinkable...thinkable. Just a day ago, he thought he was kicked out of her life for good, and that thought had devastated him, but here he is with her in his arms, the woman he loves, talking about tomorrow, and all that it holds for them. He cradles her, and a peace he has never known washes over him... and he sighs.

3 Days Later:

*'My captain once told me, that there are no victory's...only battles, and that the best we can do, is to find a place to make our stand.""*

*""And if we're very lucky,""* She turns to Castle and hopes that he can see in her eyes what she is trying to convey... that his presence in her life is so important to her, and that she needs him by her side. ""*W*e *find somebody to stand with us,"" As She Continues. ""Our Captain would want us to continue the fight...*

Kate hears her name called out and simultaneously feel an unbearable piercing pain, she feels a solid mass tackling her to the ground. There's screaming and running, swirling all around her, but she can't block out the excruciating pain. She's never felt such blinding, visceral pain in her life, and didn't think that kind of pain existed other than in movies and books, but its real... this is real, and for the first time in seconds she realizes that she'd been shot, and that maybe she was going to die. Laying there, her eyes shut tight, trying to fight the agonizing burning white hot embers of pain coursing thru her entire body, she's struggling to breathe, and she feels so numb...Kate can tell that someone is cradling her head, and she hears words...realizes it's his words. ""*Kate...stay with me Kate, okay?... Please don't leave me...I love you Kate...Kate, I love you.""*

The words she so desperately wanted to hear...needs to hear, and she thinks to herself, ""I don't want to die...I'll fight for us Castle, please don't give up on me... I'll fight to come back to you. I promise I won't leave you,"" Kate feels wet drops landing on her face and she wonders, ""Is it raining?"" She forces herself to open her eyes. They flutter, and a kaleidoscope of colors emerge as she opens them...she is fading fast...she knows she is. She fights to bring her eyes into focus, and eventually she sees only one color...blue... cerulean blue, those magical blue eyes that she's looked into for 3 years, and she realizes it wasn't rain that was falling on her face only His tears. Tears leak from the corners of her eyes, her thoughts blurry, fuzzy, her throat feels like she swallowed glass, and she thinks to herself, ""Don't cry Castle...it's going to be okay.""

Castle cradles Kate's head in the palm of his hands, his undying love pouring from him in anguish, not knowing if she had even heard him.

He thinks to himself, ""Please God, please don't take her from me,"" and he hears his pounding heart, and its breaking in two. ""Don't leave me Kate, I can't be without you,"" and his heart is pounding harder, and it's breaking in two...He watches her eyes close, his anguish deep, his words gushing forth, ""No Kate...You can't...Please, you can't.""  He hears a faint whisper, barely audible, whispered silently from her lips, he leans down and hears Kate say as she closes her eyes, her words slurring, ""Love You too Cassttlle...Alwa."" and then the light fades from her eyes.

A loud, anguished kenning noise escapes his throat, and the dam breaks, his eyes flood with tears, and in that single moment, he knew with all certainty that his heart had actually...............Just broke.

*Fin*

*P.S. This story will never end for these two star-crossed lovers. My continued vision for them is Kate asks Castle to go to the cabin with her. He helps her rehab, provides comfort and holds her in his arms on those nights that she has nightmares, and panic attacks. Kate becomes stronger physically and emotionally, and when she returns, they return as one. Partners in crime and life, facing the world together...Because I'm a big sap... for their Love Story.*",2,1768470564.0,CastleTV,0,1.0,False

However at the date she said she is very nervous coz it was her first date . She is roman catholic and i was not religious person but i respected her beliefs and encouraged everything after the date she said no to me coz i was not catholic so our relationship will not be good so i respected her decision and stopped talking to her however after few days she se texted me are we still talking i said yeah but we can’t be friends just co- workers coz i felt it awkward then later she asked me for another chance and told me that she has severe anxiety and ptsd from her childhood trauma coz she was abused by her foster care parents then i asked her out and she said yes and she was very happy and at first she was really happy and was super clingy 24/7 and told everyone about me including her parents however her mom wasn’t very happy coz i was a non catholic person but everyone knew me as a good teacher in the town and kids loved me and the parents as well so she didn’t say anything that time later on everything was good she was happy i was happy and after few months we were really into each other and we had our first private moments and she really liked how i make her feel i told her about my history about how i am an immigrant in west and i came here to for my higher studies and after that I’m doing job as a teacher and everything i asked her would u like to go to my country she said absolutely however i told her that i have limited visa only purse relationship if u are sure that u can handle long distance and everything if ever time comes she agreed! To everything as she felt so in love she asked me to have a baby i told her we are not yet married and ready for the child yet! Then one day i found so much stuff of her ex like love letters and shit i asked her why u still keep them Politely i asked do u still like him jokingly and she said not at all and i asked so u why u not throw them she said angrily i will throw them but then she didn’t one day i we fight about something and i asked her why u didn’t throw these gifts and letters away she said who are u to tell me i will not it made me upset and wonder that she still might have feelings for him coz she never throw anything it made me upset but i didn’t tell her that time one day i bought it up again and she still say im not throwing anything i told her seems like u don’t have love for me coz she was so defensive talking about them she throw the stuff away saying i dont like to throw but im throwing coz it makes u happy ! After that she brought the baby thing again and asked me to have a child i said no then one day she said don’t use protection she will take the plan -b i trusted her i asked her next day did u take the pill she said she will take tomorrow surely but she didn’t then again i asked did u take the pill she said she forgot and didn’t take it and got herself pregnant it was hard and shocking for me coz she is catholic and i got herself pregnant pregnant before marriage however i stood like a man and asked her to marry me she said she will have to tell her parents i agreed and her parents took my interview about how this happened i told them about my story however her mom didn’t seem to like me very much was really disrespectful and asked me if u are not living in this country and leaving why u been in relationship with my daughter i told her that i explained my situation and everything before handed and she was the one pursuing me i really thought i found the one and someone who genuinely like me ! Itold her i will marry her she said u don’t have to marry if u are having a child with her only i said i genuinely love her !

She said what u gonna do after marriage i told her k can take her to my country if she like it i can take her there or if she didn’t we can live here if that she prefer’s she said u cannot take my daughter out from my sight u don’t know she was abused and everything coz the foster parents beaten her once me who came from a country where beating comes in form of self discipline in kids ! But i did say it to her basically she was really mad at me i didn’t say a word but told them no matter what its my child and she is the one i love i wont leave her in the middle at all i have saving and everything to help her coz thankfully i came from good family she got sick after that a little everyday i take her to hospital coz she was having hard time i drove like three hours everyday extra to take her to hospital after work without sleep i only sleep for 2-3 hours but make sure she is comfortable and eating good i took her to shopping and dinner and everything basically never let her down whatever she ask i did took care of her ! Then her attitude started changing but i thought its pregnancy hormones so its ok i was always kind and nice to her family one day i stayed at hospital for 14 hours coz she was sick her mom was there and dad was there she didn’t even say hello to me just asked me are u going to increase your stay i said im working on extending my visa ! Then the doctors told that u guys can leave coz she is here for whole night and tomorrow she has to go to ct scan i stayed there without eating coz i couldn’t see her in that condition so worried for her and next morning with two cups of coffee i took her to ct scan and dropped her home went to bed came back to work and then went to hospital with her again ! She was really happy with me and i bought her so many flowers as she liked them and gifted her everything was going good i one day i saw a lot of her ex bf pics in her phone and they were a lot of them i mean like thousands i asked her at the starting of relationship u know that i don’t like this then i came to know she went to her ex bf house coz they we’re friends with her family they broke up in bad terms and she was very hurt coz i seen her feelings when she describes that pain what i told her is like whatever happened happened its ok u have to leave your past behind and be good in future things that happened to u are not your weakness its your strength that makes u as u are today  so i asked her to delete those pictures and step forward she said im not deleting them coz its my memories i said atleast move them in some other laptop she said she will then i came to know she went to her ex party even tho she knows she agreed to terms i asked her why u did that did u not care about my feelings she said i can’t help u with it its your problem that u thinking this way its nothing and u can’t tell me where to go who to talk i said but i dont like it at all ! How would u feel if i go to my ex on his birthday party she said coz she and her family are good friends and stuff i went back to kitchen thinking i should not argue coz she is pregnant i went to the kitchen did the dishes make good meals clean her room and did laundry help her in moving to parents house from rented unit and gave her flowers then 

Something was bothering me that her mother thinks that k made her pregnant on purpose to get citizenship here it was so hard for me to hear coz that was not my motive at all and i couldn’t tell anyone what happened either at work i usally pack lunch for her and make her food coz she didn’t know how to cook much but she like my cooking atleast that what she used to say her friends were jelous of me and they said  im a liar he pretends to be good and lot of things that i don’t wanna say ) i told her that i might be a little insecure im sorry if i keep questioning about your past and ex pics it bothers me she says u will be fine i said ok ! I didn’t tell my parents about pregnancy coz in my place we can’t have kids before marriage i asked her lets get married and then whole cycle repeats again her mom says im not letting u get married to her coz the immigration officers will think its fake i told them how its fake i have a child with her my baby i love him she said i heard in your country they will put baby in adoption center i told them u heard weong and who is telling u this im the father of the child ill die before anything touches my family im overprotective person ! She said u don’t know each other for long so u don’t know if she is the she had a point but i told her i want to tell my parents about it as well she said ok ! Lets see if the baby is healthy first wait for few months and will see i said ok then again after coming from hospital we were talking happy coming back from drive i asked somehow this topic came back again of ex pics i asked her delete them i was tired and hungry and was just exhausted so went silent and she said now u not speaking to me coz of I’m not deleting ex pics i said im just tired and then when i went home i asked her why is it such a big deal for u to move or delete your pics she said my past bothers u so much im breaking up with u u don’t care about my pregnancy at all and im breaking up with u ! She broke up with me over text ! At work i tried talking to her about our child and her financial state i said i want to be part of child life i understand u dont want to be with me its fine but child is mine too she shouted  at me i dont care at all u are harassing me in front of her friend and another co worker and later complained about me in office i got called in office and they asked me not to do this again i agreed on that coz i knew she needs this job i told them its my mistake please take actions on me she have nothing to do with it ! She didn’t even looked at me once and i gave her all her belongings back and gave her letter to tell im sorry i didn’t mean to upset u please don’t break our little family she didn’t replied at all whole family blocked me completely and she went on tik tok describing how she will be a single mom she didn’t even told me about the gender of child i came to know it from tik tok where she started posting that she wanted to day someone her age and she reveled the gender of baby on tik tok i was so heartbroken i tried to contact her mom she said don’t text me ever if she is done I’m done never contact us here i told my parents and family that we are no longer together and we are not marrying anymore then she started following her ex and started talking to him and posting on his comments and blocked me from everything then in front of me told other co-workers that im a really controlling person and egoistic that’s why she left me they looked at me with disgust i will never forget that day later on that day i was bleeding from nose and head coz i accidentally hit my head on a drawer and a box fell on me she saw i was bleeding looked af me and went inside the room i had a thought i went sleepless for her in hospital-she did’t even care to ask u ok ! Its alright im not mad maybe coz we broke up and that’s why idk she told whole town that im controlling and other coworkers usually female told me how disgusting i am to ask her to delete her ex pics i went silent and later quit the job and left that province honestly i feel like a bad person for couldn’t doing anything for child i tried talking to her and texting her that she is ok her health is fine not with anger but with kindness not like miss u or something but just how are u is our child ok is your health ok no response at all later i texted her from new number when i told her im your ex she blocked me from there too and i came to know she made fun of me at work that im still texting !

I think this is a clevelandite feldspar copper and manganese bearing matrix with Cuprian Elbeite inclusion.

The black 'filaments' are opaque and form films between the layers of the white blocky crystals. What I suspect is the manganese seepage as the formation grew that causes a flakey effect as there's places the crystals did not bond to each other so chunks although untested for hardness do have a sense of fragility.

The picture is taken next to a window with ambient lighting only and no artificial light and the inner blue still glows throughout. 

Roughly fist size blue area I'm 6ft2 I'd say about 1000g potentially included in the +-3kg mass. 

Of course this seems crazy considering the market for this sort of thing but there is real Providence which is a whole different story for now..

Anyway I'm mainly trying to determine if there's some way to believe myself or to wake up and realise my coffee is cold.

Thank you.

1qdf8jd,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1qdf8jd/so_i_need_a_sanity_check_on_something/,So... I need a sanity check on something.,"I dated this woman (25F) in high school and 3 years into university we broke up as she was moving to the UK and I (26M) couldn't commit to that move yet.

The relationship wasn't the greatest, it was pretty toxic and break ups here and there. In-between it all we were together for a total of 6 years. It was a messy breakup, as I was too busy to be there to help her and her family pack their furniture up etc and she went out with the girls and ended up cheating me (I cheated on her a few times in the relationship, I think she did too. Like I said it was toxic and messy). We were kids that weren't ready for a serious relationship like that, as we both wanted to have types of fun that the relationship didn't allow.

During the 8/9 years of the breakup my love for her has only grown each day, and I've had dreams of her and it's really been fucking up my current mindset and my current relationship.

Side note: my current relationship is lost in the void. Love is totally gone and I don't want to promise more time to my current gf as I feel it's really unfair, and I've got this intense overwhelming feeling of love for my ex everytime I think about her.

During the 8/9 years we've been broken up for we never spoke, the only signs of communication was liking an Instagram story / post here and there.

A few months ago I was really emotional and I messaged her for the first time confessing my love to hear and how I felt about her (essentially telling her that I'm here for her when she's ready to try a relationship again.) - no reply, wasn't expecting one at all so that's totally fair.

Another side note: she was married at the time, is now divorced.

Fast forward to a few days ago I manned up and just sent her a neutral message asking how she's doing, and making it clear in my message that I wasn't expecting a reply. Just wanted to get a message through to her to let her know that I'm still here. I just couldn't keep my love stored in anymore, and that small neutral message helped so much.

3rd side note: she lives in the UK, I live in South Africa

She responds with a neutral message back, no tension, no past, just a nice check up message, which I really appreciated. She did mention that she was sorry for not responding to my first message confessing my love for her, but she didn't confess anything back, rather that she appreciates the message.

I send one back saying no problem, wasn't expecting anything just wanted to get the feelings off my chest etc. and proceeding to ask her about life in the UK and how her family is doing (I was like their son really, not in a weird way).

Conversation continues and she mentions that London is busy, work is busy and that she travels a lot, family is good. She then proceeds to mention that she's going to be on holiday in South Africa, close to where I live at the exact same time that I'm on leave.

Fast forward two days and now we're meeting up for a lunch + coffee in less than two weeks. I'm absolutely stoked for this opportunity to see her again, as I've literally dreamed about just seeing her again. I know it sounds super cliche but it's the truth.

I would like to think that this is something super casual and I don't want to overthink it, but we haven't spoken for 8/9 years and the first few days of talking we're meeting up? Surely there's something in that?

Let me know if I'm crazy, Reddit.

**TL;DR;** : Ex (25F) of 9 years and I (26M) are meeting up in less and 2 weeks after a messy breakup. My love for her has only grown. Need some advice and want to know if I'm overthinking this whole thing?

1qdf5ly,https://www.spectator.com.au/2026/01/melting-pot-2/,"Melting pot?, Can Labor balance integration with multiculturalism.","Andrew McLorinan

Family history has it that I was expelled from the St Andrews Church of England Sunday school for talking too much. Given this, I am probably ill-equipped to discuss Christianity, freedom of religion, and multiculturalism in the context of the Bondi massacre, but I will because I still talk too much…

My family wasn’t much into religion. When I grew up, it was fashionable to disparage Christianity – it was old-fashioned on censorship and birth control and much more. It was fashionable to be a ‘humanist’, which was a kind of low-fat Christianity – being nice to people but without spiritualism. But for all the disavowal of Christianity in the 60s and 70s, it is fundamental to the central tenets of the Western secular state.

It sounds like an oxymoron, but our secular state is Christian at its core.

‘Render unto Caesar what is Caesar’s’ sets up the secular State. I will skip the Renaissance, the Reformation, the English Civil War, the Enlightenment, the founding of the United States, and much more in the interest of time (thank God!).

Author Tom Holland has made the case that the Woke agenda is, in essence, Christian in that Christ’s ministry was essentially one about caring for the less fortunate. The parable of the Good Samaritan says that being a good neighbour is a universal responsibility, not one defined by a community, and that is now part of how the modern state operates providing equality, human rights, and welfare.

It is that inherent Christianity that makes multiculturalism possible in a secular state. Post Bondi, the limits of multiculturalism are sadly on display.

What if a group that doesn’t respect the separation of Church and state, that isn’t about the welfare of us all, and that finds a turned cheek to be an invitation to strike is allowed to fester within the body politic? What if a religion is also an alternative political construct that is antithetical to our modern secular state?

Let’s go back to the beginnings of multiculturalism.

In Australia, that beginning came with the Whitlam government in 1973 and was endorsed by the Fraser government and subsequent governments of both colours. Those were more innocent times. In 1970, in the wake of US race riots, the UK pop group Blue Mink released a song called Melting Pot. ‘What we need is a great big melting pot.’ The idea that all of the racial groups would just blend to churn out ‘coffee coloured people by the score’ was well received. Melting Pot charted in the UK and Ireland and reached number 10 in Australia. The lyrics would not pass politically correct modern standards, but at the time no one doubted the virtue of us all being lumped together ‘what a beautiful dream / if it could only come true’.

Multiculturalism with assimilation has produced a very successful Australian cultural melting pot in my view, but it carries with it risks as Bondi has revealed.

There are lots of countries who aren’t that keen on the melting pot described by Blue Mink. Finland, Japan, South Korea, Hungary, and the Czech Republic are some examples. Some countries place more emphasis on social cohesion and see multiculturalism as a threat to that. Countries like the Netherlands, Denmark, and the United Kingdom are moving from multiculturalism to a more assimilationist approach.

It should be noted that in the Netherlands and Denmark the challenges of managing growing numbers of immigrants from the Middle East has resulted in policies we hardly recognise for countries so often held up by the progressive left as models of toleration, welfare, and state intervention.

Denmark found that the continuation of its welfare state itself was at risk of becoming unsustainable. Governments of the left and the right became concerned about poor levels of integration and the formation of Islamic ghettos.

In 2004, then-Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen warned of areas where ‘the men are unemployed, the women are isolated, and the families speak only the language of their home country’. In response, the Danish government moved to sell off and demolish public housing to force dispersion of its Islamic ghetto dwellers – places where more than 50 per cent of residents are from ‘non-Western’ backgrounds. Denmark has tightened the ways refugees can be joined by their family. Language tests, age restrictions, financial guarantees, and welfare exclusion now apply.

In Australia, multiculturalism is holy writ for now. The ABC provides some guide to the reason for this for the cynical like me.

‘Left-leaning governing parties have traditionally benefited from the support of first-generation Muslim communities, as well as from the particular intersection of class, gender, geographic, and multicultural politics which shape Muslim voting patterns.’


Which strangely enough brings me to John Christian Watson, the third Prime Minister of Australia. The Federal seat named in his honour is now held by Labor’s Tony Burke, the Minister for Home Affairs, Immigration and Citizenship and also Leader of the House of Representatives.

Watson is a very multicultural community. Islam is the largest religious affiliation (25 per cent) and Arabic is the language other than English most commonly spoken at home (16 per cent). There are other Labor seats with strong Islamic populations, such as Blaxland.

How does Labor deal with its multicultural challenges?

‘There is no place in Australia for antisemitism,’ Trumpets the press release put forward as part of the ‘PLAN TO COMBAT ANTISEMITISM’.

Sadly, it’s not a plan to combat murderous Islamic extremism. It seems to me that this framing allows for the argument that there are antisemites of different origin – Islamic and non-Islamic (neo-Nazis, presumably) – therefore the problem isn’t primarily about the Islamic community.

The other framing, which I believe has some foundation in political expediency, is this.

‘Aggravated hate speech offence for preachers and leaders who promote violence.’

In my conception, Elmer Gantry was a preacher. The dictionary says a preacher is ‘a person, usually a priest or minister, who gives a religious speech’. It could be an Islamic preacher, I suppose. I don’t know that any Christian preacher has been accused of hate speech. Indeed, given Christ’s ministry was one promoting ‘love your neighbour as yourself’ it seems a clever construct which doesn’t single out Islamic ‘hate preachers’ or reference hate Imams.

No doubt there would be security concerns about the identification of Islamic terrorism and the risks of further alienating Islamic communities.

After 911, the attack on the Bataclan in Paris, the Manchester Arena bombing, the Bali bombing, the bombing of the London Underground, and now Bondi, it is naïve to think that ordinary Aussies don’t associate Islam with terrorism. It follows that Islamophobia is on the rise. That isn’t fair to law-abiding Islamic citizens, but it is inevitable.

For the Labor Party this considerable challenge arrives at a difficult time.

Senators have quit Labor to support Greens’ motions recognising the state of Palestine. The left of the Labor Party was already fiercely pro-Palestine, but now with the emergence of a Muslim-focused political organisation, seats like Watson won’t be as safe as they currently are. It seems quite plausible that, as has happened in Britain, Muslim voters will jettison Labor in favour of Muslim candidates for Muslim causes.
I think the prognosis is not good.

Multiculturalism, as an institution, is too politically powerful. It is an icon that presents too great an opportunity for governments to hand out culture grants and court favour with particular ethnic voter blocs. Why would they replace it with an assimilationist approach?

I can’t see any restrictions on Islamic migration to Australia, particularly in light of section 116 of the Constitution, but also because the problem in Bondi was (at least partially) alleged to be home-grown, not imported extremism. If a government crackdown were to take place, I expect Islamic hate preachers will take their hate underground, but the hate won’t go away. The Islamic community will continue to be isolated and to experience Islamophobia and as a consequence inspire new terrorists to embark on a murderous jihad.

Perhaps the idea of a Melting Pot was right – a beautiful dream if it could only come true.

Today was peak chaos.



Two students from the same group pulled me into a Zoom ""emergency"" about their shared Google Doc. Student A says Student B used AI to write two paragraphs in the methods section without telling anyone. Student B says Student A used AI to rewrite those same paragraphs at 3 AM and then accused B to cover their tracks. The doc looks like a battlefield - comments like ""THIS SOUNDS LIKE CHATGPT"" and ""this is clearly human stop gaslighting me"" sprinkled between half-finished citations.



They both kept running Turnitin on the same draft and sending me screenshots with different similarity scores because of all the incremental edits. One is waving around some weird AI detector site that flagged ""high probability AI"" for phrases like ""a plethora of"" and ""furthermore."" The other is pointing to version history and claiming small edits count as ""proof"" of intent. Meanwhile I'm on my third iced coffee and my stipend would not cover the emotional labor of one of these emails, let alone two. We have a syllabus policy about AI tools: permitted for brainstorming with disclosure, not permitted for drafting core content. They both claim the other is violating that rule and both swear they themselves only used ""light assist"" for grammar. I can see in version history that a chunk of text popped in at once at 1:42 AM, and then another chunk swapped in at 3:17 AM with synonyms and a ton of adverbs. It all reads like it was written by a sleep deprived robot - so, relatable - but not exactly conclusive.



Professor is at a conference till Monday and said ""use your best judgment"" which, cool, except my best judgment is currently held together by cold brew and spite. I suggested they scrap the contested section and rewrite together on a Zoom call with track changes while screensharing. They both acted like I asked them to donate a kidney.

Has anyone dealt with dueling AI accusations in a shared doc? I need something fair and scalable, not a forensic linguistics degree. Also, is there a way to leverage Google Docs version history without turning me into Judge Judy of adverbs?

I've been living in South Carlsbad for around 4 years now. Sadly, I've yet to find a great location to do work/study from a laptop for long periods of time.

There are coffee shops here and there, but most have limited seating or the seating is geared towards the stylish aesthetic of the shop and not to be comfortable or to promote hanging out for an extended period (in my opinion). Chairs are small with little or no back--flat out just not ergonomical.

I also don't really know of any good third spaces that have ample seating. The best I could find are local libraries, but honestly, and to their credit, when I have visited, they are generally packed with little or no seating available and usually some questionable characters hanging around as well. Which is fine, but you're seated quite closely with your neighbors and that can be a deal breaker if you're looking to set up for 3-4 hours.

TL;DR: Remote worker looking for reprieves from the home office and to get out in the world. Timeframe is generally second shift of the day, from say 1-6/7pm.

Yesterday I launched 0xCal — a calorie tracking app — and it ended up #5 on Product Hunt with 200 upvotes. As a solo developer shipping my first real product, I wanted to share what worked (and what I learned).

**The app in short:**

It's a calorie tracker where you just describe what you ate (""scrambled eggs and coffee"") and AI calculates the nutrition. You can also snap photos. I built it because I kept rage-quitting MyFitnessPal — too much friction searching databases and entering portions.

**What worked for launch:**

1. **Positioning matters more than features.** I didn't lead with ""AI-powered"" (everyone says that now). Instead I focused on design and simplicity: ""Calorie tracking for people who hate calorie trackers."" That resonated way more.

2. **Answer every single comment.** I spent hours on Product Hunt replying to every question. People notice when the maker is present and engaged. Several commenters mentioned it.

3. **Launch timing.** January is peak season for health/fitness apps (New Year's resolutions). Rode that wave intentionally.

4. **Design as a differentiator.** Most calorie apps look dated and cluttered. I obsessed over making it feel minimal and polished. Multiple comments specifically mentioned the UI — it stood out.

**What surprised me:**

\- People asked way more questions about accuracy and portion sizes than I expected. Having clear answers ready would've helped.

\- The Product Hunt community is genuinely supportive. Expected more skepticism.

\- 125 downloads and 24 free trials started from one day of PH traffic. That's not huge, but it's real people using something I made.

**What's next:**

\- Apple Search Ads running (though barely spending yet — still learning)

\- More Reddit posts in relevant communities

\- Collecting feedback and shipping v1.1

**Lessons for other solo devs:**

\- Ship before you're ready. I could've polished forever.

\- Pick a niche angle, not ""another X app""

\- Engage personally — people buy from people

\- January is gold for health/fitness products

1qdf145,https://v.redd.it/er3okxljdhdg1,I made an app that creates 'Breaking News' articles from your daily life.,"I'm the solo developer behind Embargo, and this is a surprisingly personal launch for me.  
  
This app started from a difficult period in my life. About two and a half years ago, I was laid off and struggled with burnout for a long time.  
  
Scrolling through social media made it worse. Seeing everyone else's highlight reels made my own daily life feel small and insignificant. I wanted to find a way to look at my ordinary, messy days differently.  
  
That's when I thought about reframing mundane moments as breaking news. It was a simple shift in perspective, but treating my daily struggles as serious headlines actually made them feel fun and significant. It was the first time in a long while that I felt motivated to build something again.  
  
I created Embargo to push back against the pressure of perfection on social media. I wanted to show that everyday moments—like a quiet coffee or a missed bus—deserve attention too.  
  
Embargo turns your short journal entries into high-quality parody news articles. You can choose from various tones like satirical, serious, or tabloid to suit your mood.  
  
I hope this app can bring a fresh perspective to your daily life, just as it did for mine.

I wanted to share a project I’ve been quietly working on. I’m currently writing a long-form book focused on the **history of Alfa Romeo**, from its early roots in pre-WWI Italy through its racing dominance, technical innovation, and the lesser-known stories that tend to get skipped over in most summaries.

This isn’t meant to be a quick coffee-table book or a surface-level brand tribute. I’m aiming for something more narrative-driven — part history, part engineering, part cultural context — written for people who *actually care* about the marque and what made it special.

# What I’m working on

* Early ALFA origins and the Darracq years
* Pre-war racing and engineering philosophy
* Post-war identity struggles and revival attempts
* Motorsport highs and lows (not just the famous wins)
* The human stories: engineers, drivers, designers, and oddball decisions

I’ll be sharing progress updates as I go, excerpts where appropriate, and I’m very open to feedback.

# What I’d love help with

If anyone here is willing to contribute, I’d genuinely appreciate:

* **Photographs** (historic, personal, or obscure — credited, of course)
* **Quotes or anecdotes** (from books, interviews, family stories, etc.)
* **Corrections or clarifications** if I get something wrong
* **Advice** from anyone who’s written long-form non-fiction before
* Or even just encouragement — writing something this big solo can be a grind

My husband's text lit up my phone at 4:47 PM. Photo of him holding the signed contract, his whole team around him with champagne glasses raised. Million dollar deal. His first one. He looked happier than I'd seen him in months and I was lying in his brother's bed wearing yesterday's clothes.

I told him that morning I had a dentist appointment. Then errands. Said I'd probably grab dinner with my sister since he'd be out late celebrating anyway. He kissed my forehead before he left. Said if this deal went through, everything would finally pay off.

I drove to his brother's place at 10 AM.

Been sleeping with him for three months. Started at a family barbecue when my husband spent two hours on a work call. His brother made me laugh. Refilled my drink. Touched my lower back when he walked past. A week later he texted asking if I wanted coffee. I said yes.

I knew what I was doing. Every deleted message. Every lie about where I'd been. Every time I let him touch me while wearing the ring my husband saved eight months to buy. I knew.

The second text came at 5:12 PM. From his brother. ""Heard the news bro!! You fucking crushed it!!"" with a photo attached.

Same celebration photo. The team in the conference room. My husband front and center with his contract. And through the window in the background, there I was. Walking down the sidewalk in my black dress. Holding coffee from the shop two blocks from his brother's apartment. Timestamp said 4:45 PM.

I was supposed to be across town at my sister's.

My phone rang thirty seconds later.

""Where are you."" Not a question. His voice was flat.

""I'm at dinner, I told you-""

""Don't fucking lie to me right now.""

My stomach dropped. ""What are you talking about?""

""My brother sent me a photo. You're in it. Two blocks from his apartment. At 4:45. Want to explain that?""

I couldn't breathe.

""Are you fucking my brother.""

The silence felt like forever.

""ARE YOU FUCKING MY BROTHER.""

""It's not-""

""I can see your car parked on his street. I can see the license plate. You're wearing the same dress from this morning. Your sister just texted me asking what time we're coming over Sunday. So tell me where the fuck you actually are.""

I started crying. ""I'm sorry.""

""How long.""

""Please-""

""HOW LONG.""

""Three months.""

He hung up.

I called back seventeen times. Voicemail every time. I threw up in the bathroom. His brother sat on the couch staring at his phone, white as paper. ""He knows,"" he kept saying. ""Holy shit he knows.""

I drove home at 6 PM. His car wasn't there. I called his best friend. His coworker. Nobody answered. At 8 PM his best friend texted back: ""Don't contact him. Get a lawyer.""

He came home at midnight with his dad and two friends. They brought boxes and garbage bags. I tried to talk and he looked through me like I didn't exist. His dad told me to sit down and shut up or they'd call the cops to escort me out instead.

They packed for two hours. His clothes. Documents. His grandfather's watch. Photos of his family that didn't have me in them. The coffee maker he bought himself for his birthday. Everything that was his. When they finished his dad looked at me and said ""You're a disgrace.""

My husband stopped at the door. First time he'd looked directly at me since getting home.

""I made more money today than all of last year combined. I had tickets to Paris in my desk. Two weeks. I was going to surprise you tomorrow."" His voice cracked. ""I got everything I ever worked for and lost my wife in the same day. And you threw me away for my brother. The one who can't even pay his own fucking rent.""

He left. Filed for divorce the next morning. His whole family blocked me everywhere. His brother stopped answering my calls after three days. The lawyer sent papers showing he wanted nothing from me. No shared assets. No drawn out process. Just out. Clean break. His last text said ""Keep the house. I don't want anything you touched.""

Divorce was final in six months. I heard through mutual friends he got promoted again. That he's seeing someone. That his family threw a party when the divorce finalized and made a rule never to mention my name.

I destroyed the biggest day of his life while in bed with his brother. Threw away six years for someone who ghosted me the second it got real. I turned the man who loved me into someone who can't stand to be in the same room.

But I keep thinking, he worked all the time. He was never home. I was lonely and his brother was there. I made a mistake but doesn't context matter? Doesn't intention count for something?

Am I really the only villain here?

1qdezz4,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1qdezz4/my_64mm_ssp_multipurpose_burrs_experience/,My 64mm SSP Multipurpose burrs experience,"Before buying the 64mm SSP MP burrs, I spent a lot of time searching for real-world impressions and didn’t find as much detail as I wanted. This is purely personal experience (not scientific), but I figured it might help anyone who’s on the fence.

**Setup**

* Grinder: CF64v
* Machine: Lelit Victoria

**Coffee preferences**  
I drink all roast levels. I definitely have a sweet tooth, so I gravitate toward shots that emphasize sweetness—whether that’s light and fruity or dark and chocolatey.

I previously upgraded from a Eureka Mignon Specialità to the CF64v and already found that to be a huge improvement for my needs, even with the stock burrs. I used the stock burrs for about 4–5 months before switching.

**How I compared**  
Nothing scientific here. I simply got very familiar with a few different coffees using the stock burrs, then pulled shots with those same beans after installing the SSP MPs. I seasoned the SSP burrs with \~3kg of beans and aligned them before serious use.

**Results so far**  
Honestly, I’m finding a massive improvement across the board—light roast espresso, dark roast espresso, and pourover. I’d read that these burrs can be difficult to work with, but I’ve experienced the opposite. The shots feel more transparent and easier to adjust to taste.

What I was hoping for was better balance in acidity, and that’s exactly what I’m getting. Sharp acidity is noticeably tamed, and sweetness comes through much more clearly. I was also worried that darker roasts would end up thin or hollow, but that hasn’t been the case at all—for my taste, there’s still plenty of body.

**Conclusion**  
That’s about it. If you’re on the fence about the 64mm SSP MP burrs, I’d personally say go for it. I’m extremely happy with the upgrade and feel like it’s elevated everything I do with this setup. I've still got a lot more coffee to try, but these first impressions are telling to me.",5,1768468882.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

I’m exploring a new idea and would really value your advice. I’m partnering with a friend who runs a three decade old precision manufacturing unit. We supply primarily metal builds to global names like Bosch so we know how to deliver reliable, high-quality manufacturing. The plan is to introduce automotive accessories across cars, bikes, SUVs, pickups, and more.

Like many of us, I’ve been frustrated with steep markups on imported products or settling for lower-quality local options. We’ve already made and tested armored bumpers, roofracks, lids etc on my and his Isuzu in real conditions. Hoping to offer things like crash guards, panniers, rear racks, canopies, campers, mounts, and whatever else makes sense, all at fair Indian prices (at least 50% below imports and matching indian product pricing).

Still early days with the product ideas. Curious to hear from retailers, dealers, entrepreneurs, and enthusiasts:
- What sells steadily or what do customers keep asking for in cars and bikes?
- Any frustrations with suppliers on quality, pricing, or custom options?
- For those in the business, would something like this fit your lineup?
- Partners wise: Interested in becoming a co-founder, distributor?

Open to chats, ideas, or even a coffee if local. Thanks so much for any thoughts as we figure this out step by step!

Back in college, I remember steering clear of people, a total introvert, my classmates would call me ""the cold one"". I just hated talking because of my own personal self-esteem issues. In one of my classes, I sat next to, let's call him **Jim**. I didn't have the book and he offered to share his book with me. Later I thanked him, and was about to leave when he asked me if I was from the same town as his, and I excitedly said ""yes!"". It was nice to know someone from my town was in my college.

We slowly started talking a little more, we'd call each other to work on assignments, and then end up talking hours, sharing about our interests and thoughts. We realized that we had similar tastes and interests, started hanging out, exploring the city together. It was wonderful, I felt so understood, so warm and protected when I was around him.

Although it felt like we felt similar in so many ways, he was a total extrovert. Everyone at uni was his friend, meanwhile the only other friend I managed to make was a friend of his (it got messy but I'll get to it later). Anyways, halfway through my program, Jim's friend (we'll call him **Ted**) hosts a party at his parents' house and invites me, along with the entire university (lol exaggerating but there were a lot of people).

Towards the end of the party, everyone's super drunk, I was super sober. Jim and Ted sat next to me started talking. Ted was acting weird, saying stuff like ""why you so beautiful"" I was weirded out. I gave Jim a look, and Ted blurted out ""Why do you look at him like you love him? Didn't Jim Tell you he has a girlfriend?"" I thought I didn't hear it right, and just looked at Ted's face kinda confused. Ted went on and said ""sorry I mean, Jim show me you girlfriend's picture"" and my world just fell apart.

I remember Jim telling me very early on that he had a girlfriend of 5 years, my brain just wasn't ready to accept it, until the day I heard it from someone other than him. It wasn't his fault, it was mine. For being so in love with someone who was taken. So when Ted said that, he realized that he had broken my bubble. Ted then immediately told Jim to get us some drinks and took me out of the house. I was hyperventilating and then I sobbed, fell on the street, had such a weird mental breakdown. Ted then called Jim and told that I wasn't feeling good so he'd drop me home. That night, Ted drove me around for hours, absolute silence. I had no energy, no thoughts, nothing in me that'd help me function. I just sat in the car, Ted seeing every now and then if I was alive and okay.

He then took me to a spot and told me to get out of the car. I didn't realize that he had bought some snacks and drinks from the convenience store, we sat the entire night and had snacks. He told me how he was in love with me from the first day he saw me, then saw me hanging out only with Jim. He told me that he had tried to talk to me several times, but I didn't respond. I don't remember seeing anyone but Jim in the class, so I didn't know when Ted tried to talk to me. He then said ""What a wonderful tragedy. This pain will be more memorable than all the good things to come. Somehow I like this pain"" And I agreed, because as much as I was bleeding, I liked the pain. Moreover, I liked that I had someone to share this with.

We spent the entire night talking about random things, watched the sun rise, and went back home. It's been years now, Jim's girlfriend moved to the city a year later and we stopped hanging out or talking to each other. Ted would ask me about the courses I'd pick for the term and deliberately not pick them. I guess that was his way of working through his heartbreak. I started going for therapy, and my therapist said, that I have a lot of trauma from my past (that story is for another day) and that my coping mechanism is completely tuning out the things I don't want to see or hear. We worked on my trauma for 2.5 years, then acknowledging reality for another year.

Thankfully I did well in school. I applied to jobs in every city other than the city I was living in, and got one. I knew that moving elsewhere would help my healed soul start anew. It's been years now, Jim married his girlfriend and has two kids. Ted got a girlfriend too, and they both keep in touch with me. I don't seem to have an interest to date, so I hang out with my friends (YES I MADE FRIENDS) and my co-workers are the nicest people.

It sometimes scares me how I would've never healed myself if I hadn't met Jim and Ted, how I'd be in my mid 20s, living a sad life. Today I'm able to enjoy life as it is, from enjoying time with people I know, to quietly enjoying a cup of coffee in my apartment with my cat. I know that I will never feel love the way I felt for Jim, and I also know that being in a relationship will never be a necessity for me. So I've accepted my life, and the wonderful people that help me live it well.",1,1768468717.0,love,1,1.0,False

I was just messing around and I don’t consider myself a good writer or anything just wanted to know what people thought of this. Yes its stupid I know

The keys beneath my fingers melted as soon as I pressed. Each note gracefully flowing into the other like butter. Around me was an aroma of coffee and cigarettes, a scent so strong, yet so comforting. The background chatter of locals blending with the sound of the piano. Through the door, a cloud walked. The air rushed through the door as it came through. A cloud?

I open my eyes to see the blue sky and clouds. The piano I was just playing, the smell of coffee, the sounds. All gone. The wind gusts against my body violently, and a countdown begins. 3. 2. 1. Before I realize what’s happening, I get pushed off. My body as weightless as a feather plummeting through the sky. I look up and see an airplane flying off with a few others in it. And then it hits me. I'm skydiving. Fear takes over my body and I freeze, my mind racing but my body being unresponsive. How the hell is this even happening? I snap out of it and pinch myself to make sure it wasn’t a dream and sure enough, it wasn’t. Before I can even think of doing anything, everything goes black.

I jolt up and look around. The ceiling above, my blanket, a bottle of water in the corner of the room, my handcuffs un-done. It was a dream

Two years ago, I was Percy Molov. One of the best I got into a car crash involving a bus, killing 2 others and presuming me dead for two whole minutes. Once I reached the hospital, I was in a deep coma for about 3 months. The only thing I remember was waking up and not remembering where I was and who I was. The doctors said I shouldn’t even have lived through that accident. 4 broken ribs, severe nerve damage, a concussion, and all the bones in my hands shattered. Being a pianist, it couldn’t have been any worse. Months after I was discharged, even the smallest tasks were humbling. Picking up a pencil, typing, hell, even moving my hand was a struggle.

Yet throughout this, there was one other effect which was unexplainable. Since I had gotten out of the coma, I would have these vivid, realistic dreams about dire situations. Waking up tied up in an abandoned warehouse, running from foreign killers, going through the streets of Singapore trying to kill a mob leader. At first, they just felt like dreams. I would wake up in my bed with everything normal and nothing in my room being touched. But day after day, it got weirder. I would wake up on the ground with the shower running, or in my bed but in a whole new outfit I had never owned. The doctor diagnosed me with somnambulism and couldn't do anything about it besides telling me to cuff myself to my bed. So, I did, and I would wake up with them broken. Every single time. 

Anyways let’s get this geek out of the way. When the crash happened, I died. But instead of going wherever you go after dying, I went into this guy's body. A Pianist. When we were in the coma, I saw everything. All his memories, his loved ones, his whole life. 3 months it took for it to all unveil, 3 of the most boring months of my life, or whatever it is right now. My name was Anthony, born in Kosovo and raised in Russia. My family ran off mob ties and gang involvement. If you ever needed anyone gone, my family could get rid of them. Till I was 10, I was raised in Russia, learning the history and origin of my family, one day promised to take over it all. Then came 16, when I wish it didn’t. My ma never wanted me to go down the path of my father but there wasn’t much she could do. I was set to take over once I became 16, and when I did, I ran. I fled home and got a ticket far away from home. New passport, new name, new age, new beginnings. I worked throughout my teen years hustling for whatever money I could get. Cleaning tables, sweeping floors, and doing the dishes. Anything I could do to keep making money. Once I had enough saved up, I'd move again. If my family found me, they would kill me. Scared of me being a rat, they’d send people to look for me and hunt me down. At one point I was constantly on the run. Life wasn’t easy until my 25th birthday. I was in Australia at the time and was working as a bartender, when a complete smoke show walks in. Blonde hair blue eyes, typical perfect Aryan master race. Couple months go by and man, I fell in love with this girl. Long story short, we got married and moved together to the States. Everything was perfect until I found out why she was really with me. Everything seemed too perfect. I hired a private investigator to find out more about her background and little do you know, she's my dad's family friend. Sent here to kill me no matter the cost. 

Fast forward to today, I died before she could kill me herself. So now, every time this loser goes to sleep, I can take over and get my eye for an eye. Does he know about me? Nope. Will he know about me? Probably. He is a pianist, but I'll give something to him; he is smart.

Every night was a restless night. I couldn't sleep, not knowing if I would even end up back home. I sat on the edge of the bed, hands trembling. My muscles twitching beneath the skin that barely obeyed me. What would happen this time. Would I wake up with blood on my hands? Maybe my windows broken? God, what animal do I turn into when I'm not awake. The constant fear was always lingering over me, but despite this, I had to get sleep today. It's been 2 years since I’ve last worked anywhere. Pianos was just a distant memory now, something that belonged to another version of me.  I needed money, stability. A friend of mine cashed in some favors and got me an interview for a position at the bank. It was the least he could have done since it was supposed to be him in that car and not me. I lay down on the mattress attaching my hand to the cuff. Staring at the ceiling with millions of different thoughts rushing through my head, my eyelids got heavier, my heartbeat grew slow. Just before I drifted off, the only thing I could wish was to wake up here.

The cold air fills up my lu-, his lungs. I'm in control, but it's still his body. His hands beyond repair, weak wrists, shaking fingers. He doesn't know how to control them yet, but I do. I stand up slowly to get a feel of his body. I can't bear the feeling of this pianist's body. Weak, crumbly, and not an ounce of testosterone. When I was alive, or had my body, I wasn’t a bodybuilder, but I was solid. Growing up I was always skinny but being on the run made me realize I wouldn't survive if I stayed weak. I learned to be fast; watch every exit in a room. My strength was instinct. This body lacks everything. I take a step forward. The ankle wobbling unstably. Step after step, I make it to the washroom. I look in the mirror. He looks back, or his reflection does. Pale, thin, dead eyes. I'm looking at my reflection, but it's not my reflection I see.

I look around the room, finding anything of use for where I'm about to go. Closet, drawer, jackets, nothing. God, pathetic. I make my way to leave his bedroom, turning the knob slowly. Something’s off. I scan the room closely, paying attention to every little detail. There it was. His phone was on charge, but not where it usually is. It was facing the bed. The little prick tried to record me. I pick it up and unlock it. There the video sits. He’s getting curious, too curious. I delete the video and take the phone with me. 

I leave through his bedroom window and take a jacket with me. These nights are the only times I have something to myself. I'm in control, not him. He wants to go to a bank interview tomorrow, pretending to live a normal life. Sitting behind a desk while his hands tremble barely being able to hold the cheque getting cashed or using the computer he can barely operate. I almost laugh. He thinks stability is the solution, he wants to be normal. There isn't any normal for him anymore. Soon, he won’t even be waking up at all.

When in bangalore and u dont know where to ride.....where do u go? Thats right 'NANDI HILLS!' And here the story begins....

Woke up at 7.15 my regular wake up time and then got ready although I was feeling lazy. Left my house at 8.15 with a navigation mobile and a mount (that is how unprepared i was). Started fitting the mount on the bike and VOILA! I drop the small screw and cant find it. Took me atleast 10 min to find it. 

Then I hit the road ntg much happend just me and the highway and then I decided to eat breakfast and went past Nandi hills to chikkaballapur. Saw some places with amazing google reviews....I visited 2 but there was no place to sit peacefully and enjoy eating so I started looking. Finally found a place and I kid you not the ride from chikkaballapur to that place (the dosa point) was amazing. Beautiful country roads with trees lined on either side of the road. Cool breeze and a pleasant beam of sunlight combined with fresh tarmac and minimal speedbumps. I was in paradise.

An the place I had breakfast absolutely amazing view. A bill hill made from one road right in front of me with a dosa and a coffee to compliment it. Peacefully sat there for quite some time.

Then I decided to check out tge place where linkin park is supposed to perform. Since I dont have a ticket wanted to see if there is a hill that I can watch the show from. Put the location on maps it showed that I should head back the way I came from but my no.1 rule is always take an alternative road. So I went in the opposite direction and g-maaps rerouted, took that route and the least I can say is it was on adventure.

Same beautiful roads with trees lined but then maps told me to take a left. After a little while on my left side there was a litteral dirt-track. Oh boy i was excited. First I thought I would be trespassing but then said f#&* it and when ahead and did some dirtbiking on my duke 250.

Next came the a absolutely horrendous road with more potholes than road followed by 3-4 km of pebble road. Sounds horrible right? But there was no traffic or sign of human life around so I was speeding like a maniac on those road. I was having fun loosing the rear on a lot of occasions.

And here comes the end to an epic adventure. Lot of fun and lot of memories that I could never do with a group because of the shear amount of detoured I like to take.

P.S: I just wanna document it hence this post.
If u guys have any questions lmk.
Would love to know how was writing is and where i can improve.

The pay is decent, the hours are flexible, and the work is, for the most part, mind-numbingly simple. The forum’s premise is that the world—our world—didn’t make it past 2019. According to the community, we’re living in a copy, an echo, or a simulation that’s slowly degrading. My job was to keep the peace among the believers, filter out the obvious trolls, and generally maintain a digital asylum for what I considered a group of harmless eccentrics coping with a shared, elaborate delusion.

The content was usually what you’d expect. Users would log what they called ""artifacts"" or ""rendering errors""—small inconsistencies in the world that they believed were proof of the simulation's decay. It was all very creative, and for a long time, I treated the place like a collaborative fiction project.

Here are a few typical examples from the early days:

User: SkyWatcher77

Subject: Color Palette Update?

Has anyone else noticed the sky? For the last three months, the daytime blue has been... off. It's less saturated. I checked my old vacation photos from 2018 and it's a completely different hue. It’s like they pushed a system-wide graphics update and hoped no one would notice.

User: MemoryHole

Subject: The Lost Episode

I need a sanity check. I have a vivid memory of watching the series finale of Parallax in the summer of 2019. I remember the main character, Elias, sacrificing himself. I talked about it with my coworkers for a week. Now, I look it up, and the show was cancelled after one season in 2017. The finale I remember doesn't exist. It never existed.

The community had a peculiar set of rules, which I enforced with a kind of detached amusement. I saw them as role-playing mechanics, designed to deepen the immersion of their grand narrative.

* Rule 3: Do not attempt to contact members outside the forum. All communication must remain on-platform.
* Rule 5: All ‘glitches’ must be logged with date, time, and precise geographical location. Vague entries will be removed.
* Rule 7: Do not attempt to photograph, record, or otherwise capture direct evidence of anomalous entities. Describe them from memory only.
* Rule 9: Never speak their names aloud. Use designated codenames only.

I took the job for the easy money and a bit of sociological curiosity. I was a neutral observer, a janitor sweeping up the digital dust of their fantasies. I lived in my world, the real world, and they lived in theirs. The line was clear and absolute. At least, it was, until I read Post ID 7g4-b9k.

The First Glitch: Post ID 7g4-b9k

It was a Tuesday afternoon, and I was wading through the usual queue of pending posts with a cup of coffee. Most were easily dismissed—reports of deja vu, dreams that felt too real, the usual. But one post, from a user named 'Witness_Zero', was different. It wasn't hysterical or vague. It was cold, precise, and utterly terrifying in its coherence.

User: Witness_Zero

Subject: VERIFICATION NEEDED: The Old Town Clocktower

Date: 10/14/2021 Time: 14:30 PST Location: Oakhaven, Oregon

I need someone else to see this. The clocktower in my town's square has four faces. It has always had four faces. I have lived here my entire life. I looked at it on my way to lunch today. It now has three. There is just smooth, uninterrupted brickwork where the west-facing clock face should be. There is no sign of construction. No dust, no scaffolding, no news reports. I asked three people walking by what they thought of the change, and they looked at me like I was insane. They all said, ""It's always been like that."" I am losing my mind. Please, if anyone is near Oakhaven, go to the town square. Tell me I am not the only one who remembers.

My first reaction was a sigh. A classic case of false memory. I opened a new tab to find a quick photo of the Oakhaven clocktower to post in the comments and lock the thread. I searched for images. Every single photo, from professional shots on the town’s tourism page to recent tourist photos on Instagram, showed a three-faced clocktower. The west-facing side was just seamless, old brick.

Then, my professional cynicism gave way to a prickle of unease. I dug deeper. I used a satellite map service with a historical imagery feature. I dragged the timeline back. 2020… three faces. 2019… three faces. Then I hit July 2018. The satellite image was lower resolution, but it was undeniable. Four faces. I clicked forward one month to August 2018. Three faces. The change was there, in the data, but with no corresponding real-world event. No demolition permits, no news articles about a renovation, no blog posts. It had simply… changed.

On the forum, the post exploded. A few other users claimed to remember the four-faced tower from old family trips. Then, 'Witness_Zero' posted one last, frantic comment: ""It knows I saw. Something is outside my house. It's just standing there. It doesn't have a f—"" The post cut off. A few minutes later, their account was deleted. User Not Found. I realized later he'd broken Rule 7. He wasn't describing from memory; he was looking right at it. That was his mistake.

I told myself they probably just panicked and deleted their profile. But for the first time, I felt a genuine chill. That online anomaly was the first crack in the wall separating their world from mine. Soon, I’d start seeing the cracks in my own.

The Cracks in My Reality: When the Rules Came Offline

The forum was no longer a game. After the 'Witness_Zero' incident, I started reading the posts not as a moderator, but as a student. The detached amusement was gone, replaced by a low, humming paranoia. I found myself looking for inconsistencies everywhere—the pattern of the tiles on my bathroom floor, the number of steps to my apartment, the exact phrasing of a commercial jingle. The world had become a puzzle, and I was terrified of what I might find.

My first, undeniable glitch happened a week later. I was on the phone with my sister, talking about our childhood dog, Buster. ""I'll never forget the day we got him,"" she said, laughing. ""You cried because you were so happy, and Dad tripped over the redacted on the way in.""

The word she used wasn't just strange; it was impossible. It sounded like a burst of radio static, a garbled piece of data that had no place in human speech. My blood ran cold.

""The what?"" I asked, my voice tight.

""The leash,"" she said, sounding confused. ""He tripped over the leash. Are you okay?""

I frantically searched the Echo Chamber archives. I typed ""garbled speech,"" ""static words,"" ""corrupted audio."" I found it. Dozens of posts. They had a codename for it: ""The Misplaced."" A rare audio glitch where a piece of the world's source code momentarily bleeds through. Users described it happening during conversations with loved ones, on TV broadcasts, in overheard conversations on the street. It was a known phenomenon. My personal, private moment of terror was just a data point in their horrifying catalog.

The second anomaly was worse. I was walking home from the grocery store, late in the evening. A man walked past me under a flickering streetlight. For a single, horrifying instant—as the light strobed—his face wasn't a face. It was a blur, a pixelated smear of flesh-toned colors, like a low-resolution texture that hadn't loaded properly. I froze, my grocery bag slipping from my hand. The light flickered again, and he was just a normal man. But as he passed, his expression wasn’t one of confusion. It was a look of profound, cold disappointment, as if he was annoyed I had noticed him at all.

My sanity, once a solid foundation, was now a web of fractures. I went home and read the forum rules again. ""Rule 7: Do not attempt to photograph, record, or otherwise capture direct evidence of anomalous entities."" ""Rule 9: Never speak their names aloud."" These weren't for a game. They were survival instructions. And I was beginning to realize I was no longer a moderator in a game; I was a player who didn’t know how to win.

The Unspoken Truth: I Am No Longer a Moderator

I don't moderate the forum anymore. I participate. My duties are no longer about enforcing guidelines; they are about cross-referencing logs, searching for patterns, and trying to understand the new mechanics of a world that is fundamentally broken. I am a survivor, just like them.

From the fragmented, terrified accounts of the forum's most trusted members, I've pieced together what seems to be the unspoken truth. The world didn't end in fire and brimstone. It just… stopped. And something else started. This reality we're in is a bad copy, running on failing hardware. The glitches aren't supernatural; they're system errors. The strange things people see aren't invaders from another dimension. They're native to this one. They are the bugs in the code, the system daemons, the things that exist in the rounding errors of reality.

And the rules are not for our protection. They are to keep us from being noticed by the system's automated cleanup crew.

* Rule 3: Do not attempt to contact members outside the forum.
  * What we think it means is: Contacting another person who is ""awake"" creates a node. It establishes a connection that the system can trace. Small, isolated instances of awareness are tolerated as random error. A network of aware individuals is a threat that must be purged.
* Rule 7: Do not acknowledge the 'Flicker Men'.
  * The terrifying consensus is that: I think I know what I saw under that streetlight. The others call them 'Flicker Men' or 'Un-rendered'. They are background processes, NPCs that haven't loaded correctly. They are not meant to be seen. Acknowledging them—staring, showing fear, speaking to them—flags your own code for review. They are the sentinels, and they feed on observation. They will slowly un-write you from reality.
* Rule 9: Never speak their names aloud.
  * What we’ve pieced together is: Certain concepts, certain truths about the nature of this broken world, function like root commands. Speaking them aloud is like typing 'delete' into the command prompt of reality. It draws immediate, catastrophic attention.

I saw it happen. A user named 'Logician' started a private chat with me. He believed he had found a way to exploit the glitches. He broke Rule 3, trying to organize a few of us. He broke Rule 7, attempting to study an anomaly too closely. Then he broke Rule 9, telling me in a voice message the ""true name"" of the system itself. His posts became incoherent strings of text and numbers. Then they stopped. The next day, I looked for his user profile. It was gone. Not just deleted, but as if it had never been there. Out of a terrifying hunch, I searched his name on social media. His profiles were gone. Public records returned no results. He had been scrubbed. He wasn't just dead. He was deleted.

I am writing this because last night, I made a mistake. I broke a rule. And I know what is coming for me.

They're Here: My Final Log Entry

I broke Rule 7. I saw one again, on my street, standing across from my apartment building. A Flicker Man. This time I didn't just glance. I stared. I was tired, I was angry, and I wanted to understand. For about ten seconds, I held its non-gaze, trying to resolve the blur where its face should be. It turned its head towards me. And I felt a click deep in my mind. The feeling of being seen. The feeling of a file being marked for deletion.

The signs started an hour ago. There's a high-frequency hum in my apartment that my neighbor can't hear. The corner of my vision has a persistent blur, like a smudge on a camera lens that moves when I try to look at it. The faces of the people in the photos on my wall are wrong. The smiles are too wide, the eyes are too dark. My own reflection looks like a stranger.

I'm writing this now because the forum was the only guide I had, and this is the only way I know how to pass on the warning. As I type, the words on my screen keep auto-formatting against my will, snapping into the rigid structure of a forum log entry. The static isn't just a sound, it's a feeling. Deleting temp files. I can feel the memories going first. My mother's face. The taste of coffee. This post is all that's left of me. User ID M_Blackwood is being scrubbed. Remember Oakhaven. Remember the clock. Remem—

1qdeos3,https://www.reddit.com/r/MenInModernDating/comments/1qdeos3/what_to_text_after_the_first_date_the_psychology/,What to Text After the First Date: The Psychology That Actually Works,"Okay, let's cut the crap. You just finished your first date. Maybe it went well. Maybe it was awkward. Maybe you're sitting there staring at your phone like it's a bomb about to explode, wondering what the hell you should text this person. Should you wait three days like some outdated dating rule from 2005? Should you text immediately? Should you play it cool or be honest?

Here's the thing. I've spent way too much time studying relationship psychology, reading research from Dr. John Gottman, listening to Esther Perel's podcast, and diving into evolutionary psychology to understand what actually works in modern dating. And trust me, the texting game after a first date is where most people completely blow it.

The anxiety you feel? That's normal. Your brain is flooded with dopamine and cortisol, trying to predict outcomes and avoid rejection. We're wired to obsess over uncertainty in romantic situations because, evolutionarily, finding a mate was crucial for survival. But here's the good news: once you understand the actual psychology behind post date texting, you can stop overthinking and start connecting like a normal human being.

Let's break this down, step by step.

 Step 1: Text Within 24 Hours (Seriously, Stop Playing Games)

First rule: The three day rule is dead. Bury it. It's outdated bullshit from a time when people thought playing hard to get was cute. Research from communication studies shows that prompt follow up actually increases connection and reduces anxiety for both parties.

If you had a good time, text them within 24 hours. Ideally, text them the same night or the next morning. Why? Because waiting three days just makes you look uninterested or like you're playing games. And nobody has time for that manipulative crap anymore.

Example texts:

 Had a really good time tonight. Let's do it again soon.
 Just got home. That was fun, thanks for hanging out.
 Hope you made it back safely. Really enjoyed our conversation about [specific thing you discussed].

Notice how these are simple, genuine, and reference something specific from the date? That's your formula right there.

 Step 2: Be Specific (Generic Texts Are Death)

Here's where most people mess up. They send some bland, generic text like Had fun! Cool. So did everyone else on every other date ever. If you want to stand out and actually connect, reference something specific from your conversation.

This does two things: it shows you were actually paying attention (which is rare these days), and it gives them something concrete to respond to. Our brains are wired to respond more positively to personalized communication. It triggers reciprocity and makes the other person feel valued.

Good examples:

 Still thinking about that story you told about your crazy road trip to Portland. You've got me wanting to plan one now.
 I looked up that book you recommended. Just ordered it. You better be right about it being life changing.
 That Thai place was incredible. I'm already planning my next order.

See the difference? You're creating a callback to shared experience. That builds connection way better than Hey, had fun.

 Step 3: Don't Overthink the Length (But Also Don't Write a Novel)

There's this weird anxiety around text length. Should it be short? Long? Match their energy? Here's the deal: stop counting characters like a psychopath.

Your text should be long enough to express genuine interest and reference something specific, but short enough that it doesn't feel like you're writing a dissertation on your feelings. Aim for 1 to 3 sentences. That's it.

And for the love of everything, don't write a novel analyzing the entire date, your feelings, your hopes for the future, and what you want to name your future dog together. That's a one way ticket to scaring someone off.

 Step 4: Suggest Another Date (But Give Them an Out)

If you're interested in seeing them again, say it. Don't dance around it. Don't play coy. Adults appreciate directness. But here's the key: suggest another date while giving them space to respond genuinely.

Research from attachment theory shows that secure communication, being direct but not pushy, creates the healthiest relationship dynamics. You want to express interest without applying pressure.

Examples:

 I'd love to see you again. Let me know if you're free next week.
 We should check out that art exhibit you mentioned. Would you be into that?
 Had a great time. If you're down, I'd like to take you to this cool spot I know.

You're being clear about your interest, suggesting a concrete plan, and leaving the ball in their court. No pressure. No desperation. Just honest communication.

 Step 5: Read the Room (And Their Response)

Okay, so you texted. Now what? Pay attention to how they respond. This is where emotional intelligence comes in.

If they respond quickly with enthusiasm and engage with what you said, that's green light energy. Keep the conversation going naturally. If they take hours to respond with short, bland replies, they're probably not that interested. And that's okay. Don't chase people who aren't matching your energy.

Dr. Helen Fisher's research on attraction shows that reciprocal interest is crucial in the early stages of dating. If someone's genuinely interested, they'll show it through their communication patterns. If they're not, no amount of perfect texting will change that.

 Step 6: Know When to Move On

Here's the harsh truth: sometimes people aren't interested, and that has nothing to do with your text game. Maybe they're not over their ex. Maybe they're dealing with personal stuff. Maybe there just wasn't chemistry for them.

If you text someone after a first date and they ghost you or give you weak, uninterested replies, don't chase. You're not here to convince anyone to like you. You're here to find someone who's genuinely excited to hear from you.

Read the book Attached by Amir Levine and Rachel Heller. It's a game changer for understanding relationship patterns and why some people pull away. This book breaks down attachment theory in the most practical, research backed way I've ever seen. It'll help you recognize when someone's genuinely interested versus when you're wasting your time on someone emotionally unavailable. Seriously, it's the best relationship psychology book you'll ever read.

 Step 7: Keep It Light (Save the Deep Stuff for Date Two)

Your post first date text isn't the place to get into heavy topics, confess your undying feelings, or analyze the meaning of life. Keep it light, fun, and positive.

You're trying to maintain the good vibe from the date, not turn the conversation into an emotional deep dive. Save the meaningful conversations for when you're actually face to face again.

What to avoid:

 I feel like we really connected on a soul level.
 I've been hurt before, so I'm being cautious.
 Long paragraphs about your feelings or insecurities.

Just. Keep. It. Simple.

 Step 8: Don't Double Text (Unless It's Been Days)

If you send a text and they don't respond within a few hours, don't send another one. Give them time. People have lives, jobs, and responsibilities. Not everyone is glued to their phone 24/7.

However, if it's been 2 to 3 days with no response, you can send one more casual follow up. Something like, Hey, hope things are going well. Still interested in grabbing coffee? If they don't respond to that, you have your answer. Move on.

 Step 9: Use Apps That Help You Communicate Better

If you're someone who struggles with texting anxiety or overthinks every message, try using Ash, an AI powered app that helps you navigate relationship communication. It gives you coaching on how to text, what to say, and how to read responses. It's like having a relationship therapist in your pocket.

Another tool worth checking out is BeFreed, an AI learning app built by Columbia alumni that pulls from dating psychology books, research papers, and relationship expert insights to create personalized audio content. Type in something like improve my dating communication and it generates a custom podcast based on your specific struggles, whether that's texting anxiety, attachment patterns, or reading social cues. The content draws from sources like the books mentioned here and communication research studies. You can adjust the depth from a quick 10 minute summary to a 40 minute deep dive with examples, and there's an adaptive learning plan that evolves based on what resonates with you. Plus the voice options are surprisingly addictive, way better than robotic text to speech.

Also, if you're dealing with dating anxiety in general, Insight Timer has guided meditations specifically for managing relationship stress. It's free and has thousands of sessions that help calm your nervous system so you're not spiraling every time you hit send on a text.

 Step 10: Remember, Texting Isn't Everything

Here's the final truth bomb: texting is just texting. It's not the relationship. It's not the measure of someone's interest. It's just a tool to stay connected between seeing each other in person.

Don't build entire narratives in your head based on response times, punctuation, or emoji use. Focus on how you feel when you're actually with the person. That's where real connection happens.

The goal of your post first date text is simple: express genuine interest, reference something specific, and set up the next meeting. That's it. No mind games. No manipulation. Just honest, clear communication.

We became friends after I asked for his contact. During these 2 months, he :

\- Checks on me and cheers me up at work

\- Gives me little gestures like snacks

\- Texts actively, playful and sharing his day

\- Invites me out for coffee/dinners and drives me around despite the long travel distance

\- I invited him to go NYE countdown with me, he was supposed to have dinner with friends but he skipped and joined me that night

Recently, around his birthday, I noticed a change:

\- Slower replies to texts, sometimes leaving messages unread

\- Stopped initiating conversations

\- Still greets me and talks to me at work, but texting has paused

\- I sent him a thank-you + birthday + weekend invitation message but he seen the message and hasn't replied in 2 days

I’m trying not to overthink, but I can sense a shift in his energy.

Questions:

1. For introverted Capricorns, is it normal to act distant sometimes even with someone they like?
2. How do I interpret warmth in person but slow/no texting?

1qdehgb,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrevilleCoffee/comments/1qdehgb/2025_oracle_dual_boiler_woes/,2025 Oracle Dual Boiler Woes,"Hey folks,

I’ve seen a number of comments across various different threads about inconsistencies in brewing on the new Oracle dual boiler. We ordered ours to upgrade from the Jet very shortly after it was released. Since then, it has been the biggest large purchase regret we’ve ever made. Below are some problems we have with our machine, and I’d love to hear from you all your experiences too. 

- LED backlight light bleed on the screen that looks much much worse than the Jet which is at a lower price point

- Extremely loud water spout; the entire machine vibrates quite aggressively when using, and there is an audible clanging when in use

- Breville created a special “sandblasted” filter basket for this model specifically. Trying to use anything else either from them or a third party results in the grinder and tamper being unable to work properly (as if the tamp fan is relying on some special resistance), so we’re totally locked in to the stock items. The basket from the Jet for example, does not even work on the dual boiler. 

- Most importantly: extremely inconsistent espresso shots, even on manual mode with auto grind size adjustments turned off. Same beans from the hopper that brew one way in the morning will require grind size adjustment by the afternoon. The very next day they may revert back or need to be adjusted in the opposite direction. It makes no sense whatsoever and there is seemingly no rhyme or reason. My current leading theory is that the grinder and chute channel on this machine is somehow poorly insulated from the very very hot top cup warming heating element, and it’s causing drastic temperature changes on warm up, cool down, and use of the machine. For a long time I thought the issue was a poor portafilter fit, but more and more I’m looking at the grinder’s retention and possible thermal instability as the cause. 

Has anyone else had these or similar problems? It would be helpful to know if it’s a larger problem with the model. We use 2-3 week old fresh roasted beans, usually from Equator. 

On the positive side, it’s quite pretty, the front filling water spout is super helpful, and the steam once heated is dry and decently powerful. If the machine could brew consistent shots, I’d love to regularly use a custom programmed manual shot, but even when I spend 20 min creating the perfect shot, it’s never repeatable in the next coffee session without grind adjustments. We’re at our wits end and likely will have to ditch it soon unfortunately. We’ve wasted so much coffee on bad shots.",1,1768466918.0,BrevilleCoffee,0,1.0,False

***Reading time:*** 20 Minutes (It got quite long, sry)

Welcome Back to Our [Ghosts of Saltmarsh Campaign Rewrite Series](https://www.patreon.com/collection/1634852?view=expanded)!

Our players have arrived in Saltmarsh, a quiet coastal town full of intrigue, trade, and secrets. They are about to attend their first City Council meeting, where they’ll receive a mission that will set the stage for the first major adventure: The Haunted House, the central location where the Sinister Secret of Saltmarsh will unfold.

Like our [Internal Rock Adventures series](https://www.patreon.com/collection/1314109?view=expanded), I will begin with retelling the story. Afterwards I will give a small lookout for further stories of the campaign and list all the changes I made to the adventure.

# Lets begin the Adventure!

The adventure begins as the players attend the council meeting of Saltmarsh. Everyone is present except **Manistrad**, she is overseeing operations at the mine. **Eliander Fireborn** begins the meeting with the most pressing matter: travelers have gone missing on the road between Seaton and Saltmarsh, rumors suggests that ghosts are responsible, they come from an old mansion along the road. This could pose a danger to anyone traveling the route and might even disrupt trade between the two towns, something the council wants to prevent. Fireborn suggests sending the adventurers, invited to the meeting by **Anders Solmor** and **Skerrin Wavechaser** (if you used the introduction from the [Saltmarsh Village article](https://www.patreon.com/posts/137034120?collection=1634852)) to investigate the mansion. **Gellan Primewater**, however, dismisses the rumors as nothing more than superstitious nonsense. He argues that the council shouldn’t waste resources chasing ghost stories. After some back and forth, the council votes to send the party to investigate. Primewater cannot sway the others against the decision. As the meeting concludes, Primewater approaches the party privately and invites them to his mansion. He remarks that, as heroes, they deserve a proper rest before their adventure, and he would be happy to host them.

When the party accompanies Gellan to his mansion, many townsfolk greet them warmly along the way, he is quite popular by the common folk. The richest men of the city (proclaimed by himself) hands coins to several beggars, doing much to maintain his image as Saltmarsh’s benevolent patron. That evening, after a fine dinner, the players are shown to a lavish library where they may rest. Once they’re settled, Gellan reveals his true intentions, he attempts to bribe the adventurers. He offers each of them 50 gold pieces to abandon the council’s mission and spend their time on more “worthwhile” pursuits than chasing shadows in an old, haunted house. Whether the party accepts his offer is up to them. Afterwards, everyone retires for the night.

Later, Gellan secretly arranges to hire **Ned Shakeshaft**, instructing him to travel to the haunted house ahead of the party. Ned’s task is to hinder the adventurers’ investigation should they decide to go there. Primewater warns Ned not to inform **Sanbalet** (The leader of the haunted house smuggler) of any of this, Gellan distrusts the ruthless smuggler and wants nothing to do with his violent methods.

The next morning, the party packs their belongings and says goodbye to Gellan Primewater. They set out on the road toward the old mansion. Since we are using alternate overland travel rules (see [Azure Coast blog post](https://www.patreon.com/posts/139334699?collection=1634852)), the players can only take a long rest in safe havens, not just anywhere. About half a day’s journey from the Haunted House, the group comes across a small farmstead. The farm belongs to Enryn and his family, who live a modest but peaceful life there. The players decide to spend the night at the farm and gain the benefits of a long rest. This encounter also introduces Enryn and his family, a narrative element we will revisit later in the adventure. After a restful night, the party continues their journey toward the Haunted House, ready to uncover the mysteries that await them within its crumbling walls.

# Haunted House

I ran the Haunted House mostly as written and tied it in to the overarching plot. The players searched around the property and decided to enter through the backyard, heading into the living area (room 4). There, they triggered the Magic Mouth trap. Instead of just playing the standard warning message, I used the Magic Mouth spell to trigger a flashback, an episode from one character’s traumatic past. The vision showed the burning and destruction of their home by the Scarlet Brotherhood, letting the player reveal their backstory through roleplay. This turned what’s normally a simple trap into a powerful emotional moment. Afterward, the group discovered the secret trapdoor leading down into the cellar. From the stairs, they heard voices and saw torchlight. Instead of rushing into combat, they decided to go down and talk to the smugglers, trying to figure out what was really going on.

The smugglers, who were using the Haunted House as a front, were completely shocked to see the adventurers. Unsure whether to attack or flee, they send one to fetch **Sanbalet**, their ruthless leader. Sanbalet was furious to find strangers in his hideout and shouted at his men for not dealing with them immediately. However, the party quickly diffused the situation by bluffing, claiming that Gellan Primwater had sent them to check on the operation. A very high Deception roll saved them from combat breaking out. Sanbalet, still suspicious, told them he needed more time to move the goods into Saltmarsh. He mentioned they were expecting the Sea Ghost in two days to complete a weapons deal. Pressing for more details made him visibly uneasy. To complicate things, Sanbalet then brought in Ned Shakeshaft, demanding to know who the party was and why Gellan had supposedly sent two groups to check on him. It was a tense and entertaining moment as the players desperatly tried to talk their way out of the situation. Eventually, they persuaded Sanbalet that Ned was lying and no longer useful. The wizard killed Ned on the spot, then took two of the players as hostages, sending the others away with instructions to bring proof of their loyalty to Primewater.

Outside, the party regrouped and managed to ambush and overpower part of the smuggler crew, killing them in the process. They then stormed the cellar and cave systems, guns blazing, and took down the rest. For the encounters, I used the Bandits from the [Monster Manifest](https://www.patreon.com/posts/monster-manifest-141234939) to replace both the scouts and standard bandits, while keeping the Hobgoblins as written. The players were level 3, and even then the fight was quite tough, especially after they used a large wine cask as a rolling trap to crush several smugglers. I can easily see a level 1 party suffering a TPK here, be aware of that if you run the adventure. When looting the bodies, the group found the signal system used to communicate with the crew of the Sea Ghost. I used a printed handout from [Reddit ](https://www.reddit.com/r/GhostsofSaltmarsh/comments/ikzyoc/sanbalets_riddle_a_very_simplistic_puzzle_for_the/)made by [u/eichwald86](https://www.reddit.com/user/eichwald86/) and edited by [u/reakess](https://www.reddit.com/user/reakess/). When the party searched Sanbalet's private quarters, they found a bullseye lantern and some candles. They realised that the smuggler were using the code as a signaling system to communicate with the approaching ship. They even realised that they probably should go upstairs to find a high spot from which the crew on the ship could see the lantern's light better. I was quite impressed with them at that moment, how fast they realized that. Additionally they also found some brandy and silk from the Archipelago, the Sea Princes come from. They were a little perplexed by these items, but this would become clear later to them.

# Return to Enrys Farm

Bloodied and bruised, the party decided to return to the nearby farmstead to rest. The farm is designated as a **Safe Haven**, where the players can take a long rest. See the visiting the [Azure Coast blog post](https://www.patreon.com/posts/ghosts-of-azure-139334699) for a full explanation of this rule. After they had wiped out the smugglers beneath the Haunted House and felt they could do nothing more there for now.

When the party arrived back at the farm, they found a dramatic scene unfolding. Soldiers of **Marik Feldren**, the ruler of Seaton, were attempting to plunder the farm. These men carried orders to requisition grain from surrounding homesteads to feed the growing army presence in Seaton. The reason is Seaton is preparing for war against the Sea Princes and is rapidly militarizing, many new soldiers need to be fed. The farmer, **Enryn**, protested, saying that he had already paid his taxes to the **Saltmarsh Council**, as his land lies under their jurisdiction. The soldiers disagreed and dispute between them broke out. The moment before swords were drawn, one of the players, a noble, invoked her title and used her authority to command the soldiers to stand down, preventing the looting and earning the farmers’ gratitude. This encounter served as a lore drop, highlighting the rising tension between Saltmarsh and Seaton and foreshadowing the coming conflict with the Sea Princes. It also introduced **Marik Feldren** as a ruthless ruler, someone who will play an important role later in a player’s personal quest. After the confrontation, the soldiers departed, and the party finally rested safely at the farm.

The next morning, the adventurers were awakened by the sound of approaching horses. **Skerrin Wavechaser** arrived with several Saltmarsh guards, having heard that Seaton’s soldiers were harassing local farms. He came to resolve any conflicts and ensure the safety of the townsfolk. This is an excellent moment to portray Skerrin as compassionate and protective, helping the players build trust with him. Skerrin asked the group about their mission at the Haunted House. The party chose to keep **Gellan Primewater’s** involvement a secret, and he didn’t press the issue but suspected more. Skerrin further suggested a bold plan: the party should stay hidden at the mansion and deceive the incoming crew, seizing the ship in the process so they can find out more about the smugglers.

If the players asked about the smuggled goods (the silk or tabacco for example), Skerrin explained the situation in detail. Due to the rising tensions and the likely war between the Kingdom and the Sea Princes, goods from the Princes’ islands can now only be traded through the Kingdom’s largest harbor, which is not Saltmarsh. The Crown has imposed heavy taxes on these goods to weaken the Sea Princes’ profits. Commodities like tobacco, coffee, silk, sugar, rum, and brandy are all in high demand and can be sold for great profit if smuggled into the Kingdom through a small fishing town without paying taxes.

Before departing, Skerrin also brought news from town. Two fishing boats owned by the Solmor family had run aground on Abbey Island and their crews are missing, a teaser for the next adventure: Abbey Island. **Anders Solmor** is distraught and wants to send a rescue mission, but Saltmarsh lacks the manpower to act. Skerrin offers the adventurers a reward if they agree to investigate the island once their current mission is complete. Finally, before leaving, Skerrin gives the party two healing potions and bids them farewell.

# The Signal

After their morning rest, the party decided to return to the Haunted House and wait for the smugglers’ ship to arrive. While passing the time, they explored the upper floors of the abandoned villa. Other than moldy furniture and a few oversized centipedes, they found nothing of real interest. As evening fell on the second day, the Sea Ghost appeared on the distant horizon. The players quickly recognized the signaling system they had discovered earlier and prepared to respond.

To make the scene more immersive, I set it up in real life: I used an actual garden lantern (borrowed from my mom! Bless her) and darkened the room. To “send” the signals, I used thick sheets of paper to block and reveal the light, and the players did the same to “reply.” but used their handy light. (I should have given the lantern to them in hindsight) It turned into a really fun and atmospheric moment, as we all physically mimicked the coded light exchange between the mansion and the ship. After successfully responding to the signal, the party spotted a rowboat leaving the Sea Ghost, heading toward the coastal grotto beneath the mansion.

In the grotto the party encountered three pirates led by **Bloody Bjorn**, the first mate of the Sea Ghost. After a brief attempt to deceive the pirates with lies about **Sanbalet** and the other smugglers, combat quickly broke out. The fight was short but fierce. Bjorn and two pirates were killed, while the last one, badly wounded, was sent back to the ship as a warning. For the pirates, I used the Bandit stat block, replacing their crossbows with flintlock pistols and giving one of them a simple bomb to throw for flavor. After the fight, the party’s bard cleverly decided to seal the cave using Shatter, collapsing the tunnel to prevent anyone from using the grotto again.

To the party’s surprise, the pirates did not retreat. They launched a full assault on the grotto, furious at the death of their comrades. They began digging through the collapsed tunnel to reach the adventurers. This moment created incredible tension at the table. As the pirates hammered away at the rubble to open the collapsed tunnel, the players started to panic. Then, in a moment of pure brilliance, the bard cast Thunderwave, blasting the remaining boulders into the attackers. The explosion echoed through the cavern. The ensuing battle was brutal. The party faced eight pirates using our [Bandit](https://www.patreon.com/posts/monster-manifest-141234939) stats, **Captain Sigurd Snake Eyes**, and the ship’s wizard **Punketah** (both using their normal stats). The fight ended with only the ranger and Sigurd still standing. The two clashed in a desperate one on one duel, ending with Sigurd’s death.

To emphasize the pirates’ ruthless fighting style, I gave Sigurd and one bandit special bonus actions for dirty fighting, trip attacks to knock foes prone and dirt throws to blind enemies. Small touches to show their underhanded tactics. After the dust settled, the party looted the bodies. They found Sigurd’s magical coat and his enchanted compass. The compass always points toward what its holder desires most, and it also serves as an insignia identifying one of the Sea Princes. The party does not know this yet, but it will be revealed later. Sigurd’s rank as a Sea Prince will tie the group directly to the pirate faction, deepening the story’s intrigue and political tension. With the pirates defeated, the party took a rowboat and made their way to the **Sea Ghost** itself.

Upon boarding the ship, the party discovered only one survivor, the old boatswain **Gebu**, a grizzled pirate who had served under seven previous captains of the Sea Ghost. I added Gebu as an NPC information source and a potential connection to future smuggling or piracy. He explained that only the party, himself, a prisoner, and the lizardfolk waiting for their weapons remained. Since the players had already defeated the captain and most of the crew, I removed the remaining ship combat encounters to keep pacing tight. During the conversation, Gebu revealed several key points. He was the first boatswain of the Sea Ghost. **Sigurd Snake Eyes** was a Sea Prince, and by pirate tradition, that title now passes to the ranger who killed him. The cargo on board was worth thousands of gold pieces. He suggested that the new captain should hire him and that they could sell the cargo for a fortune. The party pretended to agree with his plan for now.

The group searched the captain’s quarters, finding the payment for the lizardfolk. They then descended into the ship’s hold, where they discovered both the weapons and the prisoner **Oceanus**, a triton changed from a sea elf to distinguish him from the elves of Silverstand and Dreadwood. Oceanus revealed everything he knew, which is basically nothing and joined the party. I portrayed him as noble hearted, polite, and somewhat naive, a knightly triton unfamiliar with life on land. The party then approached the lizardfolk in the hold. One player used a Disguise Kit to impersonate Captain Sigurd Snake Eyes. The situation was tense. The lizardfolk demanded their weapons and were deeply suspicious. Through some incredibly high rolls, the party convinced them that the ship had been attacked by soldiers from Saltmarsh, who killed most of the crew and stole the weapons. It was not the most believable lie, but the lizardfolk were desperate, and the dice were kind.

# Return to Saltmarsh

The Sea Ghost sailed up the coast and reached Saltmarsh within a day. The ranger sent a message with his owl to **Skerrin Wavechaser**, asking him to prepare an ambush for their arrival. The plan worked perfectly. When the ship approached the harbor, the Saltmarsh city guards under the command of **Fireborn** were ready. They quickly ambushed the lizardfolk and seized control of the ship. In the aftermath, Skerrin congratulated the party on their success and rewarded them generously for their efforts.

The adventure ends here, but several story threads remain open and will serve as setups for future adventures.

* **The lizardfolk** were captured and imprisoned in Saltmarsh. Why did they need the weapons? Are they preparing to attack the town? This will lead into the later adventure, Dangers at Dunwater.
* **Gellan Primwater** is the true mastermind behind the Saltmarsh smuggling operation. The party knows this but lacks solid proof. They have the cargo, but all the smugglers are dead except for Gebu, who does not know Gellan’s contact in town. Only Sanbalet had that information. For now, they have nothing to directly connect Gellan to the smuggling network. This storyline is large enough to deserve its own detailed post later.
* **The fishermen** who shipwrecked on Abbey Island are still missing. A rescue mission will need to be organized. This will set up the next adventure, Isle of the Abbey.

The players had a lot of fun, and so did I. I mostly ran the module as written, weaving an overarching plot around it and tying in already established characters such as Skerrin and Gellan. Here is everything, listed clearly:

* The smuggler at the haunted house work for Gellan Primewater. His name appears in Sanbalet’s personal documents.
* Gellan Primewater attempts to bribe the players to prevent them from going to the haunted house. He also sends Ned Shakeshaft to the villa to warn Sanbalet.
* I added Enrys Farmstead. It serves as a temporary base where the players can rest and as a tool to establish further storylines. Skerrin Wavechaser later comes to the farm and meets the players there.
* I added an explanation for the smuggled goods. What is smuggled and why.
* Siggurd Snake Eyes was elevated to the rank of Sea Prince, tying the pirates more closely into the story. I added the compass as a way for the players to join the pirates’ side if they wish.
* I changed Oceanus’s race to triton to differentiate him from the many elves of the land.

Besides that, there is not much more to add. The adventure served as a great setup for the upcoming stories and the many mysteries still waiting to be uncovered by the players. Hope you liked the article. :)

Welcome Back to Our [Ghosts of Saltmarsh Campaign Rewrite Series](https://www.patreon.com/collection/1634852?view=expanded)!

Our players have arrived in Saltmarsh, a quiet coastal town full of intrigue, trade, and secrets. They are about to attend their first City Council meeting, where they’ll receive a mission that will set the stage for the first major adventure: The Haunted House, the central location where the Sinister Secret of Saltmarsh will unfold.

Like our [Internal Rock Adventures series](https://www.patreon.com/collection/1314109?view=expanded), I will begin with retelling the story. Afterwards I will give a small lookout for further stories of the campaign and list all the changes I made to the adventure.

# Lets begin the Adventure!

Everyone is present except **Manistrad**, she is overseeing operations at the mine. **Eliander Fireborn** begins the meeting with the most pressing matter: travelers have gone missing on the road between Seaton and Saltmarsh, rumors suggests that ghosts are responsible, they come from an old mansion along the road.

Instead of just playing the standard warning message, I used the Magic Mouth spell to trigger a flashback, an episode from one character’s traumatic past.

The smugglers, who were using the Haunted House as a front, were completely shocked to see the adventurers. Unsure whether to attack or flee, they send one to fetch **Sanbalet**, their ruthless leader. Sanbalet was furious to find strangers in his hideout and shouted at his men for not dealing with them immediately. However, the party quickly diffused the situation by bluffing, claiming that Gellan Primwater had sent them to check on the operation. A very high Deception roll saved them from combat breaking out. Sanbalet, still suspicious, told them he needed more time to move the goods into Saltmarsh. He mentioned they were expecting the Sea Ghost in two days to complete a weapons deal. Pressing for more details made him visibly uneasy. To complicate things, Sanbalet then brought in Ned Shakeshaft, demanding to know who the party was and why Gellan had supposedly sent two groups to check on him. It was a tense and entertaining moment as the players desperatly tried to talk their way out of the situation. Eventually, they persuaded Sanbalet that Ned was lying and no longer useful. The wizard killed Ned on the spot, then took two of the players as hostages, sending the others away with instructions to bring proof of their loyalty to Primewater.

Outside, the party regrouped and managed to ambush and overpower part of the smuggler crew, killing them in the process. They then stormed the cellar and cave systems, guns blazing, and took down the rest. For the encounters, I used the Bandits from the [Monster Manifest](https://www.patreon.com/posts/monster-manifest-141234939) to replace both the scouts and standard bandits, while keeping the Hobgoblins as written. The players were level 3, and even then the fight was quite tough, especially after they used a large wine cask as a rolling trap to crush several smugglers. I can easily see a level 1 party suffering a TPK here, be aware of that if you run the adventure. When looting the bodies, the group found the signal system used to communicate with the crew of the Sea Ghost. I used a printed handout from [Reddit ](https://www.reddit.com/r/GhostsofSaltmarsh/comments/ikzyoc/sanbalets_riddle_a_very_simplistic_puzzle_for_the/)made by [u/eichwald86](https://www.reddit.com/user/eichwald86/) and edited by [u/reakess](https://www.reddit.com/user/reakess/). When the party searched Sanbalet's private quarters, they found a bullseye lantern and some candles. They realised that the smuggler were using the code as a signaling system to communicate with the approaching ship. They even realised that they probably should go upstairs to find a high spot from which the crew on the ship could see the lantern's light better. I was quite impressed with them at that moment, how fast they realized that. Additionally they also found some brandy and silk from the Archipelago, the Sea Princes come from. They were a little perplexed by these items, but this would become clear later to them.

# Return to Enrys Farm

Bloodied and bruised, the party decided to return to the nearby farmstead to rest. The farm is designated as a **Safe Haven**, where the players can take a long rest. See the visiting the [Azure Coast blog post](https://www.patreon.com/posts/ghosts-of-azure-139334699) for a full explanation of this rule. After they had wiped out the smugglers beneath the Haunted House and felt they could do nothing more there for now.

When the party arrived back at the farm, they found a dramatic scene unfolding. Soldiers of **Marik Feldren**, the ruler of Seaton, were attempting to plunder the farm. These men carried orders to requisition grain from surrounding homesteads to feed the growing army presence in Seaton. The reason is Seaton is preparing for war against the Sea Princes and is rapidly militarizing, many new soldiers need to be fed. The farmer, **Enryn**, protested, saying that he had already paid his taxes to the **Saltmarsh Council**, as his land lies under their jurisdiction. The soldiers disagreed and dispute between them broke out. The moment before swords were drawn, one of the players, a noble, invoked her title and used her authority to command the soldiers to stand down, preventing the looting and earning the farmers’ gratitude. This encounter served as a lore drop, highlighting the rising tension between Saltmarsh and Seaton and foreshadowing the coming conflict with the Sea Princes. It also introduced **Marik Feldren** as a ruthless ruler, someone who will play an important role later in a player’s personal quest. After the confrontation, the soldiers departed, and the party finally rested safely at the farm.

The next morning, the adventurers were awakened by the sound of approaching horses. **Skerrin Wavechaser** arrived with several Saltmarsh guards, having heard that Seaton’s soldiers were harassing local farms. He came to resolve any conflicts and ensure the safety of the townsfolk. This is an excellent moment to portray Skerrin as compassionate and protective, helping the players build trust with him. Skerrin asked the group about their mission at the Haunted House. The party chose to keep **Gellan Primewater’s** involvement a secret, and he didn’t press the issue but suspected more. Skerrin further suggested a bold plan: the party should stay hidden at the mansion and deceive the incoming crew, seizing the ship in the process so they can find out more about the smugglers.

If the players asked about the smuggled goods (the silk or tabacco for example), Skerrin explained the situation in detail. Due to the rising tensions and the likely war between the Kingdom and the Sea Princes, goods from the Princes’ islands can now only be traded through the Kingdom’s largest harbor, which is not Saltmarsh. The Crown has imposed heavy taxes on these goods to weaken the Sea Princes’ profits. Commodities like tobacco, coffee, silk, sugar, rum, and brandy are all in high demand and can be sold for great profit if smuggled into the Kingdom through a small fishing town without paying taxes.

Before departing, Skerrin also brought news from town. Two fishing boats owned by the Solmor family had run aground on Abbey Island and their crews are missing, a teaser for the next adventure: Abbey Island. **Anders Solmor** is distraught and wants to send a rescue mission, but Saltmarsh lacks the manpower to act. Skerrin offers the adventurers a reward if they agree to investigate the island once their current mission is complete. Finally, before leaving, Skerrin gives the party two healing potions and bids them farewell.

# The Signal

After their morning rest, the party decided to return to the Haunted House and wait for the smugglers’ ship to arrive. While passing the time, they explored the upper floors of the abandoned villa. Other than moldy furniture and a few oversized centipedes, they found nothing of real interest. As evening fell on the second day, the Sea Ghost appeared on the distant horizon. The players quickly recognized the signaling system they had discovered earlier and prepared to respond.

To make the scene more immersive, I set it up in real life: I used an actual garden lantern (borrowed from my mom! Bless her) and darkened the room. To “send” the signals, I used thick sheets of paper to block and reveal the light, and the players did the same to “reply.” but used their handy light. (I should have given the lantern to them in hindsight) It turned into a really fun and atmospheric moment, as we all physically mimicked the coded light exchange between the mansion and the ship. After successfully responding to the signal, the party spotted a rowboat leaving the Sea Ghost, heading toward the coastal grotto beneath the mansion.

In the grotto the party encountered three pirates led by **Bloody Bjorn**, the first mate of the Sea Ghost. After a brief attempt to deceive the pirates with lies about **Sanbalet** and the other smugglers, combat quickly broke out. The fight was short but fierce. Bjorn and two pirates were killed, while the last one, badly wounded, was sent back to the ship as a warning. For the pirates, I used the Bandit stat block, replacing their crossbows with flintlock pistols and giving one of them a simple bomb to throw for flavor. After the fight, the party’s bard cleverly decided to seal the cave using Shatter, collapsing the tunnel to prevent anyone from using the grotto again.

To the party’s surprise, the pirates did not retreat. They launched a full assault on the grotto, furious at the death of their comrades. They began digging through the collapsed tunnel to reach the adventurers. This moment created incredible tension at the table. As the pirates hammered away at the rubble to open the collapsed tunnel, the players started to panic. Then, in a moment of pure brilliance, the bard cast Thunderwave, blasting the remaining boulders into the attackers. The explosion echoed through the cavern. The ensuing battle was brutal. The party faced eight pirates using our [Bandit](https://www.patreon.com/posts/monster-manifest-141234939) stats, **Captain Sigurd Snake Eyes**, and the ship’s wizard **Punketah** (both using their normal stats). The fight ended with only the ranger and Sigurd still standing. The two clashed in a desperate one on one duel, ending with Sigurd’s death.

To emphasize the pirates’ ruthless fighting style, I gave Sigurd and one bandit special bonus actions for dirty fighting, trip attacks to knock foes prone and dirt throws to blind enemies. Small touches to show their underhanded tactics. After the dust settled, the party looted the bodies. They found Sigurd’s magical coat and his enchanted compass. The compass always points toward what its holder desires most, and it also serves as an insignia identifying one of the Sea Princes. The party does not know this yet, but it will be revealed later. Sigurd’s rank as a Sea Prince will tie the group directly to the pirate faction, deepening the story’s intrigue and political tension. With the pirates defeated, the party took a rowboat and made their way to the **Sea Ghost** itself.

Upon boarding the ship, the party discovered only one survivor, the old boatswain **Gebu**, a grizzled pirate who had served under seven previous captains of the Sea Ghost. I added Gebu as an NPC information source and a potential connection to future smuggling or piracy. He explained that only the party, himself, a prisoner, and the lizardfolk waiting for their weapons remained. Since the players had already defeated the captain and most of the crew, I removed the remaining ship combat encounters to keep pacing tight. During the conversation, Gebu revealed several key points. He was the first boatswain of the Sea Ghost. **Sigurd Snake Eyes** was a Sea Prince, and by pirate tradition, that title now passes to the ranger who killed him. The cargo on board was worth thousands of gold pieces. He suggested that the new captain should hire him and that they could sell the cargo for a fortune. The party pretended to agree with his plan for now.

The group searched the captain’s quarters, finding the payment for the lizardfolk. They then descended into the ship’s hold, where they discovered both the weapons and the prisoner **Oceanus**, a triton changed from a sea elf to distinguish him from the elves of Silverstand and Dreadwood. Oceanus revealed everything he knew, which is basically nothing and joined the party. I portrayed him as noble hearted, polite, and somewhat naive, a knightly triton unfamiliar with life on land. The party then approached the lizardfolk in the hold. One player used a Disguise Kit to impersonate Captain Sigurd Snake Eyes. The situation was tense. The lizardfolk demanded their weapons and were deeply suspicious. Through some incredibly high rolls, the party convinced them that the ship had been attacked by soldiers from Saltmarsh, who killed most of the crew and stole the weapons. It was not the most believable lie, but the lizardfolk were desperate, and the dice were kind.

# Return to Saltmarsh

The Sea Ghost sailed up the coast and reached Saltmarsh within a day. The ranger sent a message with his owl to **Skerrin Wavechaser**, asking him to prepare an ambush for their arrival. The plan worked perfectly. When the ship approached the harbor, the Saltmarsh city guards under the command of **Fireborn** were ready. They quickly ambushed the lizardfolk and seized control of the ship. In the aftermath, Skerrin congratulated the party on their success and rewarded them generously for their efforts.

The adventure ends here, but several story threads remain open and will serve as setups for future adventures.

* **The lizardfolk** were captured and imprisoned in Saltmarsh. Why did they need the weapons? Are they preparing to attack the town? This will lead into the later adventure, Dangers at Dunwater.
* **Gellan Primwater** is the true mastermind behind the Saltmarsh smuggling operation. The party knows this but lacks solid proof. They have the cargo, but all the smugglers are dead except for Gebu, who does not know Gellan’s contact in town. Only Sanbalet had that information. For now, they have nothing to directly connect Gellan to the smuggling network. This storyline is large enough to deserve its own detailed post later.
* **The fishermen** who shipwrecked on Abbey Island are still missing. A rescue mission will need to be organized. This will set up the next adventure, Isle of the Abbey.

The players had a lot of fun, and so did I. I mostly ran the module as written, weaving an overarching plot around it and tying in already established characters such as Skerrin and Gellan. Here is everything, listed clearly:

* The smuggler at the haunted house work for Gellan Primewater. His name appears in Sanbalet’s personal documents.
* Gellan Primewater attempts to bribe the players to prevent them from going to the haunted house. He also sends Ned Shakeshaft to the villa to warn Sanbalet.
* I added Enrys Farmstead. It serves as a temporary base where the players can rest and as a tool to establish further storylines. Skerrin Wavechaser later comes to the farm and meets the players there.
* I added an explanation for the smuggled goods. What is smuggled and why.
* Siggurd Snake Eyes was elevated to the rank of Sea Prince, tying the pirates more closely into the story. I added the compass as a way for the players to join the pirates’ side if they wish.
* I changed Oceanus’s race to triton to differentiate him from the many elves of the land.

Besides that, there is not much more to add. The adventure served as a great setup for the upcoming stories and the many mysteries still waiting to be uncovered by the players. Hope you liked the article. :)

***Reading time:*** 20 Minutes (It got quite long, sry)

Welcome Back to Our [Ghosts of Saltmarsh Campaign Rewrite Series](https://www.patreon.com/collection/1634852?view=expanded)!

Our players have arrived in Saltmarsh, a quiet coastal town full of intrigue, trade, and secrets. They are about to attend their first City Council meeting, where they’ll receive a mission that will set the stage for the first major adventure: The Haunted House, the central location where the Sinister Secret of Saltmarsh will unfold.

Like our [Internal Rock Adventures series](https://www.patreon.com/collection/1314109?view=expanded), I will begin with retelling the story. Afterwards I will give a small lookout for further stories of the campaign and list all the changes I made to the adventure.

# Lets begin the Adventure!

The adventure begins as the players attend the council meeting of Saltmarsh. Everyone is present except **Manistrad**, she is overseeing operations at the mine. **Eliander Fireborn** begins the meeting with the most pressing matter: travelers have gone missing on the road between Seaton and Saltmarsh, rumors suggests that ghosts are responsible, they come from an old mansion along the road. This could pose a danger to anyone traveling the route and might even disrupt trade between the two towns, something the council wants to prevent. Fireborn suggests sending the adventurers, invited to the meeting by **Anders Solmor** and **Skerrin Wavechaser** (if you used the introduction from the [Saltmarsh Village article](https://www.patreon.com/posts/137034120?collection=1634852)) to investigate the mansion. **Gellan Primewater**, however, dismisses the rumors as nothing more than superstitious nonsense. He argues that the council shouldn’t waste resources chasing ghost stories. After some back and forth, the council votes to send the party to investigate. Primewater cannot sway the others against the decision. As the meeting concludes, Primewater approaches the party privately and invites them to his mansion. He remarks that, as heroes, they deserve a proper rest before their adventure, and he would be happy to host them.

When the party accompanies Gellan to his mansion, many townsfolk greet them warmly along the way, he is quite popular by the common folk. The richest men of the city (proclaimed by himself) hands coins to several beggars, doing much to maintain his image as Saltmarsh’s benevolent patron. That evening, after a fine dinner, the players are shown to a lavish library where they may rest. Once they’re settled, Gellan reveals his true intentions, he attempts to bribe the adventurers. He offers each of them 50 gold pieces to abandon the council’s mission and spend their time on more “worthwhile” pursuits than chasing shadows in an old, haunted house. Whether the party accepts his offer is up to them. Afterwards, everyone retires for the night.

Later, Gellan secretly arranges to hire **Ned Shakeshaft**, instructing him to travel to the haunted house ahead of the party. Ned’s task is to hinder the adventurers’ investigation should they decide to go there. Primewater warns Ned not to inform **Sanbalet** (The leader of the haunted house smuggler) of any of this, Gellan distrusts the ruthless smuggler and wants nothing to do with his violent methods.

The next morning, the party packs their belongings and says goodbye to Gellan Primewater. They set out on the road toward the old mansion. Since we are using alternate overland travel rules (see [Azure Coast blog post](https://www.patreon.com/posts/139334699?collection=1634852)), the players can only take a long rest in safe havens, not just anywhere. About half a day’s journey from the Haunted House, the group comes across a small farmstead. The farm belongs to Enryn and his family, who live a modest but peaceful life there. The players decide to spend the night at the farm and gain the benefits of a long rest. This encounter also introduces Enryn and his family, a narrative element we will revisit later in the adventure. After a restful night, the party continues their journey toward the Haunted House, ready to uncover the mysteries that await them within its crumbling walls.

# Haunted House

I ran the Haunted House mostly as written and tied it in to the overarching plot. The players searched around the property and decided to enter through the backyard, heading into the living area (room 4). There, they triggered the Magic Mouth trap. Instead of just playing the standard warning message, I used the Magic Mouth spell to trigger a flashback, an episode from one character’s traumatic past. The vision showed the burning and destruction of their home by the Scarlet Brotherhood, letting the player reveal their backstory through roleplay. This turned what’s normally a simple trap into a powerful emotional moment. Afterward, the group discovered the secret trapdoor leading down into the cellar. From the stairs, they heard voices and saw torchlight. Instead of rushing into combat, they decided to go down and talk to the smugglers, trying to figure out what was really going on.

The smugglers, who were using the Haunted House as a front, were completely shocked to see the adventurers. Unsure whether to attack or flee, they send one to fetch **Sanbalet**, their ruthless leader. Sanbalet was furious to find strangers in his hideout and shouted at his men for not dealing with them immediately. However, the party quickly diffused the situation by bluffing, claiming that Gellan Primwater had sent them to check on the operation. A very high Deception roll saved them from combat breaking out. Sanbalet, still suspicious, told them he needed more time to move the goods into Saltmarsh. He mentioned they were expecting the Sea Ghost in two days to complete a weapons deal. Pressing for more details made him visibly uneasy. To complicate things, Sanbalet then brought in Ned Shakeshaft, demanding to know who the party was and why Gellan had supposedly sent two groups to check on him. It was a tense and entertaining moment as the players desperatly tried to talk their way out of the situation. Eventually, they persuaded Sanbalet that Ned was lying and no longer useful. The wizard killed Ned on the spot, then took two of the players as hostages, sending the others away with instructions to bring proof of their loyalty to Primewater.

Outside, the party regrouped and managed to ambush and overpower part of the smuggler crew, killing them in the process. They then stormed the cellar and cave systems, guns blazing, and took down the rest. For the encounters, I used the Bandits from the [Monster Manifest](https://www.patreon.com/posts/monster-manifest-141234939) to replace both the scouts and standard bandits, while keeping the Hobgoblins as written. The players were level 3, and even then the fight was quite tough, especially after they used a large wine cask as a rolling trap to crush several smugglers. I can easily see a level 1 party suffering a TPK here, be aware of that if you run the adventure. When looting the bodies, the group found the signal system used to communicate with the crew of the Sea Ghost. I used a printed handout from [Reddit ](https://www.reddit.com/r/GhostsofSaltmarsh/comments/ikzyoc/sanbalets_riddle_a_very_simplistic_puzzle_for_the/)made by u/eichwald86 and edited by u/reakess. When the party searched Sanbalet's private quarters, they found a bullseye lantern and some candles. They realised that the smuggler were using the code as a signaling system to communicate with the approaching ship. They even realised that they probably should go upstairs to find a high spot from which the crew on the ship could see the lantern's light better. I was quite impressed with them at that moment, how fast they realized that. Additionally they also found some brandy and silk from the Archipelago, the Sea Princes come from. They were a little perplexed by these items, but this would become clear later to them.

# Return to Enrys Farm

Bloodied and bruised, the party decided to return to the nearby farmstead to rest. The farm is designated as a **Safe Haven**, where the players can take a long rest. See the visiting the [Azure Coast blog post](https://www.patreon.com/posts/ghosts-of-azure-139334699) for a full explanation of this rule. After they had wiped out the smugglers beneath the Haunted House and felt they could do nothing more there for now.

When the party arrived back at the farm, they found a dramatic scene unfolding. Soldiers of **Marik Feldren**, the ruler of Seaton, were attempting to plunder the farm. These men carried orders to requisition grain from surrounding homesteads to feed the growing army presence in Seaton. The reason is Seaton is preparing for war against the Sea Princes and is rapidly militarizing, many new soldiers need to be fed. The farmer, **Enryn**, protested, saying that he had already paid his taxes to the **Saltmarsh Council**, as his land lies under their jurisdiction. The soldiers disagreed and dispute between them broke out. The moment before swords were drawn, one of the players, a noble, invoked her title and used her authority to command the soldiers to stand down, preventing the looting and earning the farmers’ gratitude. This encounter served as a lore drop, highlighting the rising tension between Saltmarsh and Seaton and foreshadowing the coming conflict with the Sea Princes. It also introduced **Marik Feldren** as a ruthless ruler, someone who will play an important role later in a player’s personal quest. After the confrontation, the soldiers departed, and the party finally rested safely at the farm.

The next morning, the adventurers were awakened by the sound of approaching horses. **Skerrin Wavechaser** arrived with several Saltmarsh guards, having heard that Seaton’s soldiers were harassing local farms. He came to resolve any conflicts and ensure the safety of the townsfolk. This is an excellent moment to portray Skerrin as compassionate and protective, helping the players build trust with him. Skerrin asked the group about their mission at the Haunted House. The party chose to keep **Gellan Primewater’s** involvement a secret, and he didn’t press the issue but suspected more. Skerrin further suggested a bold plan: the party should stay hidden at the mansion and deceive the incoming crew, seizing the ship in the process so they can find out more about the smugglers.

If the players asked about the smuggled goods (the silk or tabacco for example), Skerrin explained the situation in detail. Due to the rising tensions and the likely war between the Kingdom and the Sea Princes, goods from the Princes’ islands can now only be traded through the Kingdom’s largest harbor, which is not Saltmarsh. The Crown has imposed heavy taxes on these goods to weaken the Sea Princes’ profits. Commodities like tobacco, coffee, silk, sugar, rum, and brandy are all in high demand and can be sold for great profit if smuggled into the Kingdom through a small fishing town without paying taxes.

Before departing, Skerrin also brought news from town. Two fishing boats owned by the Solmor family had run aground on Abbey Island and their crews are missing, a teaser for the next adventure: Abbey Island. **Anders Solmor** is distraught and wants to send a rescue mission, but Saltmarsh lacks the manpower to act. Skerrin offers the adventurers a reward if they agree to investigate the island once their current mission is complete. Finally, before leaving, Skerrin gives the party two healing potions and bids them farewell.

# The Signal

After their morning rest, the party decided to return to the Haunted House and wait for the smugglers’ ship to arrive. While passing the time, they explored the upper floors of the abandoned villa. Other than moldy furniture and a few oversized centipedes, they found nothing of real interest. As evening fell on the second day, the Sea Ghost appeared on the distant horizon.

After successfully responding to the signal, the party spotted a rowboat leaving the Sea Ghost, heading toward the coastal grotto beneath the mansion.

In the grotto the party encountered three pirates led by **Bloody Bjorn**, the first mate of the Sea Ghost. After a brief attempt to deceive the pirates with lies about **Sanbalet** and the other smugglers, combat quickly broke out. The fight was short but fierce. Bjorn and two pirates were killed, while the last one, badly wounded, was sent back to the ship as a warning. For the pirates, I used the Bandit stat block, replacing their crossbows with flintlock pistols and giving one of them a simple bomb to throw for flavor. After the fight, the party’s bard cleverly decided to seal the cave using Shatter, collapsing the tunnel to prevent anyone from using the grotto again.

To the party’s surprise, the pirates did not retreat. They launched a full assault on the grotto, furious at the death of their comrades.

As the pirates hammered away at the rubble to open the collapsed tunnel, the players started to panic. Then, in a moment of pure brilliance, the bard cast Thunderwave, blasting the remaining boulders into the attackers. The explosion echoed through the cavern. The ensuing battle was brutal. The party faced eight pirates using our [Bandit](https://www.patreon.com/posts/monster-manifest-141234939) stats, **Captain Sigurd Snake Eyes**, and the ship’s wizard **Punketah** (both using their normal stats). The fight ended with only the ranger and Sigurd still standing. The two clashed in a desperate one on one duel, ending with Sigurd’s death.

To emphasize the pirates’ ruthless fighting style, I gave Sigurd and one bandit special bonus actions for dirty fighting, trip attacks to knock foes prone and dirt throws to blind enemies. Small touches to show their underhanded tactics. After the dust settled, the party looted the bodies. They found Sigurd’s magical coat and his enchanted compass. The compass always points toward what its holder desires most, and it also serves as an insignia identifying one of the Sea Princes. The party does not know this yet, but it will be revealed later. Sigurd’s rank as a Sea Prince will tie the group directly to the pirate faction, deepening the story’s intrigue and political tension. With the pirates defeated, the party took a rowboat and made their way to the **Sea Ghost** itself.

Upon boarding the ship, the party discovered only one survivor, the old boatswain **Gebu**, a grizzled pirate who had served under seven previous captains of the Sea Ghost. I added Gebu as an NPC information source and a potential connection to future smuggling or piracy. He explained that only the party, himself, a prisoner, and the lizardfolk waiting for their weapons remained. Since the players had already defeated the captain and most of the crew, I removed the remaining ship combat encounters to keep pacing tight. During the conversation, Gebu revealed several key points. He was the first boatswain of the Sea Ghost. **Sigurd Snake Eyes** was a Sea Prince, and by pirate tradition, that title now passes to the ranger who killed him. The cargo on board was worth thousands of gold pieces. He suggested that the new captain should hire him and that they could sell the cargo for a fortune. The party pretended to agree with his plan for now.

The group searched the captain’s quarters, finding the payment for the lizardfolk. They then descended into the ship’s hold, where they discovered both the weapons and the prisoner **Oceanus**, a triton changed from a sea elf to distinguish him from the elves of Silverstand and Dreadwood. Oceanus revealed everything he knew, which is basically nothing and joined the party. I portrayed him as noble hearted, polite, and somewhat naive, a knightly triton unfamiliar with life on land. The party then approached the lizardfolk in the hold. One player used a Disguise Kit to impersonate Captain Sigurd Snake Eyes. The situation was tense. The lizardfolk demanded their weapons and were deeply suspicious. Through some incredibly high rolls, the party convinced them that the ship had been attacked by soldiers from Saltmarsh, who killed most of the crew and stole the weapons. It was not the most believable lie, but the lizardfolk were desperate, and the dice were kind.

# Return to Saltmarsh

The Sea Ghost sailed up the coast and reached Saltmarsh within a day. The ranger sent a message with his owl to **Skerrin Wavechaser**, asking him to prepare an ambush for their arrival. The plan worked perfectly. When the ship approached the harbor, the Saltmarsh city guards under the command of **Fireborn** were ready. They quickly ambushed the lizardfolk and seized control of the ship. In the aftermath, Skerrin congratulated the party on their success and rewarded them generously for their efforts.

The adventure ends here, but several story threads remain open and will serve as setups for future adventures.

* **The lizardfolk** were captured and imprisoned in Saltmarsh. Why did they need the weapons? Are they preparing to attack the town? This will lead into the later adventure, Dangers at Dunwater.
* **Gellan Primwater** is the true mastermind behind the Saltmarsh smuggling operation. The party knows this but lacks solid proof. They have the cargo, but all the smugglers are dead except for Gebu, who does not know Gellan’s contact in town. Only Sanbalet had that information. For now, they have nothing to directly connect Gellan to the smuggling network. This storyline is large enough to deserve its own detailed post later.
* **The fishermen** who shipwrecked on Abbey Island are still missing. A rescue mission will need to be organized. This will set up the next adventure, Isle of the Abbey.

The players had a lot of fun, and so did I. I mostly ran the module as written, weaving an overarching plot around it and tying in already established characters such as Skerrin and Gellan. Here is everything, listed clearly:

* The smuggler at the haunted house work for Gellan Primewater. His name appears in Sanbalet’s personal documents.
* Gellan Primewater attempts to bribe the players to prevent them from going to the haunted house. He also sends Ned Shakeshaft to the villa to warn Sanbalet.
* I added Enrys Farmstead. It serves as a temporary base where the players can rest and as a tool to establish further storylines. Skerrin Wavechaser later comes to the farm and meets the players there.
* I added an explanation for the smuggled goods. What is smuggled and why.
* Siggurd Snake Eyes was elevated to the rank of Sea Prince, tying the pirates more closely into the story. I added the compass as a way for the players to join the pirates’ side if they wish.
* I changed Oceanus’s race to triton to differentiate him from the many elves of the land.

Besides that, there is not much more to add. The adventure served as a great setup for the upcoming stories and the many mysteries still waiting to be uncovered by the players. Hope you liked the article. :)

1qdeds0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXPreppers/comments/1qdeds0/no_stress_preps/,No stress preps,"A lot of people are drained but want to keep going. I designed this day/weekend list of things to do that are restorative but still prep adjacent so that you can take a day off but come back wiser and more aligned with your prepping purpose. 

Ideally this is done on a day off, so you can be without distractions. 

Constraints: no actual prepping, buying, organizing, gardening, or anything else that reminds you that the world could change in an instant. The idea is to give your nervous system a break while remaining in a cruise control prep in the background of it all. 

This is not prescriptive, they are just examples of how you can prep while bringing down stress levels.

1. Go for a walk in your neighborhood or city by foot without a map or destination. Make note of shops, cars, street lights, who is around, etc. Just walk. Take note of your body-- heart rate elevated? Worried about something? Shoes no good/slippery/bad fit? Did you get thirsty or hungry? Did people talk to you? 

2. Watch a docuseries or read a magazine about something popular with the masses. Sports documentary, popular long running TV show, foreign film. Having knowledge of these topics can help you quickly build common ground with potential helpers. It humanizes you to strangers.

3. Don't cook. If you have shelf stable food, eat it and see how you feel. Bagged popcorn, PB&J, nuts, fruit, instant coffee or tea. 

4. Get your news from others. Great conversation, gets you out of the doom loop, and gives you a chance to see who has trustworthy perspectives. ""Have you been following the news in MN? I'm out of the loop. What's it all about?""

5. Take a nap. For as long as you want. Sleep won't come easy when there's an emergency, being able to fall asleep for short periods, especially in noisy areas, is a valuable skill to develop. 

6. Before you look at a clock, guess what time it is and/or how much time has passed.

7. Listen to the music/talk on the radio. You'll need entertainment that isn't news. Familiarize yourself with AM stations.

8. Play with puzzles, word searches, sudoku etc. Even offline video games like star dew. Learn a group game like dominoes or a card game. DIY something.

9. Work on ankle and wrist mobility and strength. These are weak points that can take you out of the game. 

10. Write a journal of your negative thoughts and throw it away. The physical act of writing reduces stress and enhances clarity. 

11. Rewire you mind to be positive in all these instances by reciting affirmations: I'm good at getting around my neighborhood by myself! Wow the Olympic doping scandal was so interesting, I picked a good film. I love eating all these snacks we have laying around.

Any other ideas for this concept?  Nothing active like checking batteries, organizing,etc. Truly lazy girl ppreps that you can do when you feel like you must act, but you should really chill.  ",13,1768466542.0,TwoXPreppers,1,0.94,False

Here are some reviews on a few and if you know of any good travel packs (not discovery packs, full travel size) please let me know! 

ACQUA DI PARMA (these are 12ml so a little more generous than usual)

*Fico di Amalfi* (fig nectar, lemon, pink pepper). This is a really jammy fig nectar - not the usual green fig leaf type of scent. Really tasty, but very close to the skin, almost no projection, and wears off pretty quickly. Very quiet compared to the other two. But damn the fig in this is delectable 

*Arancia di Capri* (orange, mandarin, caramel). The orange is very ripe and the caramel is prominent. Despite this it manages to be very fresh. A really unique scent!

*Mirto di Panarea* (myrtle, lemon, juniper). This was my surprise favourite out of the three - the myrtle really makes this. Fresh, zingy, herbaceous. Like the fresh moist face towels this give post sauna at an expensive day spa.


ATKINSONS (note: these travel bottles are some of the best quality I have seen - thick sturdy glass, a really nice atomiser, heavy lids that won’t deform)

*The Big Bad Cedar* (cardamom, broom, cedar). Woody woody woody. Sharp and a touch spicy, almost has a bit of liquorice feel to it. If you like the dry wood smell of cedar, this is worth trying. 

*Mint & Tonic* (mint, lime, ginger). This reminds me a bit of Bohemian Lime by Goldfield & Banks. VERY limey, both the juice and the zest. The mint is the peppermint kind, not the spearmint kind (spearmint gives me a toothpaste vibe every time). 

*Pirates’ Grand Reserve* (rum, cocoa, heliotrope). I love a boozy scent and this don’t disappoint. The heliotrope lends a powdery quality to it, the cocoa adds a slight bitterness, and the rum is deep dark and sweet. Absolutely love this 

*Scilly Neroli* (petitgrain, neroli, patchouli). I’m not a neroli / orange blossom fan, so I thought this one would be a giveaway. However it manages to overcome this as petitgrain is the dominant note to my nose. Nothing to write home about but a perfectly serviceable freshie 

AKRO

*Awake* - this is the most realistic freshly pulled espresso I have smelled. My husband asked if I spilled coffee on myself. I really love this. Lemon note on opening fades away fast and you’re left with a dark roast coffee.

*Bake* - soft lemon and butter tart. Sits very close to the skin and has poor longevity but man it’s such a nice scent for the fleeting time it is with you for. Comes third in the lemon gourmand olympics for me (Chelsea Morning by Lush = gold, Nishane Ani = silver, Lira scraping in 4th place)  

*Rise* - I do get a slight sunscreen smell from this. The pineapple smells quite realistic - not that ripe, like you’ve just twisted the stem off a pineapple and realised you were too hasty because it really needs a few more days to ripen up.  

PENHALIGON’S - (note, i’m annoyed these travel sizes don’t unscrew - I got these hoping to refill The Favourite and Empressa when they’re empty from full bottles I have of each. However I was delighted to find they come with quality travel pouches - tight elastic at the neck so they don’t slide off easily, with Penhaligon’s signature bow.)

*Luna* (bitter orange, juniper, rose, jasmine) - opens up with a very punchy juniper note, settles into a citrus floral. Citrus is zesty, the rind not the juice, smells like a very aromatic gin and tonic. 

*Empressa* (bergamot, peach, rose, dewberry, patchouli) - this is such a fantastic modern chypre and it’s hard to just reduce it to a few notes, there is a lot going on here. It’s citrusy, it’s fruity yet in a mature way, it’s floral, it’s earthy. It reminds me a bit of Chloe Nomade. 

*The Favourite* (violet, iris, mimosa) - there is just something about The Favourite that tickles me. It’s powdery, musky, floral and clean, and makes me feel like a helpless princess trapped in a tower. 

PENHALIGON’S (again)

*The Cut* (basil, peppermint, fir balsalm) - this is a classic fougere, but sweeter than I expected so it isn’t aggressively masculine. Fresh, herbal, a bit balsamic.

*Sartorial* (honey, ginger, beeswax, lavender) - WOW I adore this. No citrus note is listed but I get a strong lemon from this. To my nose, this is Naxos reimagined for summer. If you like Naxos by Xerjoff this is absolutely worth checking out. Full bottle worthy for me.

Enjoy.

# Round 1: Moon Guard

Moon Guard rolls in, candles lit, lore tight,  
Walk-ups alive and active every single night.  
When Stormwind breathes, the streets got soul,  
From nobles scheming to guards always on patrol.  
Yeah we heard the jokes, the Goldshire memes,  
Still out RP you while your just an AFK dream.  
We write dialogue, not just raid short stats,  
Every /say hits harder than your combat facts.

# Round 1: Wyrmrest Accord

Wyrmrest steps up a slow burn but with deep roots,  
Long-formed dramas with paragraph pursuits.  
We don’t spam /emotes, we build up the scene,  
Paragraph posts, each with an emmy winning sheen.  
You chase crowds, we craft a legacy,  
Years-long arcs with deep formed memory.  
While you’re speed-dating lore in cathedral square,  
We’re holding guild councils that actually care.

# Round 2: Moon Guard

Councils? Cool to see, if they ever conclude,  
Three weeks later you're still discussing the right mood.  
Moon Guard’s fast, reactive, and alive,  
Walk into stormwind and see ten plots collide.  
Military orders, mage towers, rogue spies,  
Politics layered, not just short style wise.  
We adapt on the fly, improv quite elite,  
While you need a forum post just to cross the street.

# Round 2: Wyrmrest Accord

Improv’s cute till the lore breaks apart,  
Random player ideas change every restart.  
We respect the setting, weight every word,  
If a shaman speaks, the spirits are always heard.  
You flood the zone with noise and flair,  
We make silence heavy, the meaning’s there.  
Quality over quantity, patience is key,  
RP’s a slow drum, not instant brew coffee.

# Round 3: Moon Guard

Let’s talk visibility, a heavy community pull,  
Events so packed the shards go null.  
New RPers land, get caught in the ropes,  
From walk-ups to plots with actual hopes.  
Yeah, we’re chaotic but so’s Stormwind lore,  
Capital cities should always be the Lion’s roar.  
You guard tradition like it’s made of glass,  
We let it breathe and the party outlast.

# Round 3: Wyrmrest Accord

We don’t chase numbers, we chase immersion,  
Every arc planned with a narrative version.  
When a character dies, it means something here,  
Not resurrected next week forgetting god mode was there.  
You burn bright, sometimes burn out fast,  
We build stories with meaning meant to last.  
Roleplaying ain’t a market, it’s a sacred fire,  
Tended slow, and fed by creative desire.

# Final Round: Cypher (Both Servers)

**Moon Guard:**  
We’re the server that never logs off,  
Where stories collide and sparks constantly pop off.  
Is it messy? Sure but still alive to the core,  
Roleplaying that breathes is what we’re here for.

**Wyrmrest Accord:**  
We’re the long road, the ancient elven song,  
Where patience proves the story goes strong.  
Not loud, not rushed, but deeply lore bound,  
Roleplaying with roots sunk forever in the ground.

(In conclusion, RP in MG is like a fast food chain. WRA is like a sit in restaurant. Both have quality and measure in each but its up to the player to decide which they prefer. 

A tribute to both when it comes to roleplaying style and flair.)",0,1768466258.0,wow,2,0.25,False

Wag seryosohin masyado—pero may konting katotohanan. 

May phase din sa buhay ko na akala ko pera lang ang goal.  
Earn more. Save more. Buy nicer things.  
Yung tipong pag may sweldo, hindi ka kinakabahan.  
Pag may emergency, hindi ka nagpapanic—nagpaplano ka lang.

Hindi naman ako mayaman.  
Pero comfortable.  
Yung klase ng comfort na hindi mo kailangang ipost,  
pero ramdam ng mga tao pag kasama ka.

Napansin ko ‘to over time.

Hindi ako yung laging nagyayabang ng presyo.  
Hindi rin ako yung nagtatanong ng “magkano yan?” sa harap ng lahat.  
Pero may mga sitwasyon na biglang may nagsasabi ng:  
“Ang dali mo kasama.”  
“Oo nga no, hindi ka stressed.”

At doon ko narealize—  
minsan, hindi itsura ang napapansin.  
Hindi rin lifestyle.  
Kundi **peace**.

May mga date na dapat quick coffee lang.  
Pero biglang nagiging dinner.  
Tapos dessert.  
Tapos “sige, isang lugar pa.”

Hindi dahil nagyayabang ka ng wallet.  
Kundi dahil walang awkward na “hala, magkano na ‘to?” moment.  
Parang may silent understanding na *okay lang*.

Dati, inisip ko normal lang ‘yon.  
Na ganun talaga pag marunong ka mag-manage ng buhay mo.  
Na pag hindi ka problemado sa pera, mas present ka sa usapan.

Aminado ako, na-enjoy ko rin minsan.  
Yung feeling na ikaw yung “easy choice” sa logistics.  
Hindi ka tinatanong kung kaya mo—ina-assume na.

Pero habang tumatagal, may napansin din ako.

May mga taong naa-attract hindi sa’yo…  
kundi sa **ginhawa** na dala mo.

At medyo doon ako napaisip.

Kasi masarap sa ego, oo.  
Masarap marinig ang “ang sarap mo kausap” o “ang gaan mong kasama.”  
Pero minsan, ang ibig pala nilang sabihin:  
*“Ang gaan ng buhay pag andyan ka.”*

Which is flattering…  
pero delikado rin.

Kasi hindi mo alam kung ikaw ba ang gusto—  
o yung version ng buhay na napapadali mo.

Ngayon, iba na ulit.

Okay pa rin ako financially.  
Hindi rin naman biglang naghirap.  
Alam ko pa rin ang value ko—  
hindi lang sa bank account, kundi sa diskarte at disiplina.

Pero mas maingat na ako.

Mas gusto ko na yung taong interesado kahit walang flex,  
kahit simple lang ang plano,  
kahit walang upgrade.

Yung marunong mag-enjoy kahit hindi “sponsored by me.”

Kasi pera, pang-comfort.  
Pang-ayos ng problema.  
Pang-bukas ng options.

Pero hindi siya foundation.

Minsan gusto kong sabihan yung younger self ko:  
“Bro, okay yung pera.  
Okay yung pagiging ready.  
Okay yung ikaw yung ‘kaya’ lagi.”

“Pero hindi lahat ng kumportable kasama,  
gusto talagang sumabay sa’yo pag mahirap na.”

Kasi ang pera, pang-sustain.  
Ang stability, pang-impress.

Wag seryosohin masyado—pero may konting katotohanan. 

May phase din sa buhay ko na akala ko pera lang ang goal  
Earn more. Save more. Buy nicer things.  
Yung tipong pag may sweldo, hindi ka kinakabahan.  
Pag may emergency, hindi ka nagpapanic—nagpaplano ka lang.

Hindi naman ako mayaman.  
Pero comfortable.  
Yung klase ng comfort na hindi mo kailangang ipost,  
pero ramdam ng mga tao pag kasama ka.

Napansin ko ‘to over time.

Hindi ako yung laging nagyayabang ng presyo.  
Hindi rin ako yung nagtatanong ng “magkano yan?” sa harap ng lahat.  
Pero may mga sitwasyon na biglang may nagsasabi ng:  
“Ang dali mo kasama.”  
“Oo nga no, hindi ka stressed.”

At doon ko narealize—  
minsan, hindi itsura ang napapansin.  
Hindi rin lifestyle.  
Kundi peace.

May mga date na dapat quick coffee lang.  
Pero biglang nagiging dinner.  
Tapos dessert.  
Tapos “sige, isang lugar pa.”

Hindi dahil nagyayabang ka ng wallet.  
Kundi dahil walang awkward na “hala, magkano na ‘to?” moment.  
Parang may silent understanding na *okay lang*.

Dati, inisip ko normal lang ‘yon.  
Na ganun talaga pag marunong ka mag-manage ng buhay mo.  
Na pag hindi ka problemado sa pera, mas present ka sa usapan.

Aminado ako, na-enjoy ko rin minsan.  
Yung feeling na ikaw yung “easy choice” sa logistics.  
Hindi ka tinatanong kung kaya mo—ina-assume na.

Pero habang tumatagal, may napansin din ako.

May mga taong naa-attract hindi sa’yo…  
kundi sa ginhawa na dala mo.

At medyo doon ako napaisip.

Kasi masarap sa ego, oo.  
Masarap marinig ang “ang sarap mo kausap” o “ang gaan mong kasama.”  
Pero minsan, ang ibig pala nilang sabihin:  
*“Ang gaan ng buhay pag andyan ka.”*

Which is flattering…  
pero delikado rin.

Kasi hindi mo alam kung ikaw ba ang gusto—  
o yung version ng buhay na napapadali mo.

Ngayon, iba na ulit.

Okay pa rin ako financially.  
Hindi rin naman biglang naghirap.  
Alam ko pa rin ang value ko—  
hindi lang sa bank account, kundi sa diskarte at disiplina.

Pero mas maingat na ako.

Mas gusto ko na yung taong interesado kahit walang flex,  
kahit simple lang ang plano,  
kahit walang upgrade.

Yung marunong mag-enjoy kahit hindi “sponsored by me.”

Kasi pera, pang-comfort.  
Pang-ayos ng problema.  
Pang-bukas ng options.

Pero hindi siya foundation.

Minsan gusto kong sabihan yung younger self ko:  
“Bro, okay yung pera.  
Okay yung pagiging ready.  
Okay yung ikaw yung ‘kaya’ lagi.”

“Pero hindi lahat ng kumportable kasama,  
gusto talagang sumabay sa’yo pag mahirap na.”

Kasi ang pera, pang-sustain.  
Ang stability, pang-impress.  
Pero ang values at direksyon—  
‘yun ang dahilan kung bakit may gustong manatili  
kahit hindi na madali ang lahat.

So we've been cooking something up, and it's finally here: full AI video creation right in the VEED mobile app (iOS for now, Android coming soon).

Here's the thing — you know those moments when you need a video *yesterday*? Maybe you're commuting, waiting for coffee, or just don't want to deal with setting up lights and a camera? Yeah, we felt that too.

Now you can easily create a complete talking head video from your phone. No filming. No hunting down actors. No ""let me get back to my desk for this.""

**What you can do (Full video creation studio now in your pocket):**

* Generate a script (or write your own)
* Pick from realistic AI actors who'll deliver it
* Add captions, music, B-roll — the whole editing suite
* Export and post before your competitor even opens their laptop

Perfect for ads, product demos, explainers, social content — basically whenever you need a human face talking but don't want to be that face (or don't have the time/budget for production).

The [iOS app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/veed-captions-for-videos/id1634439688) is live now. If you're on Android, you can jump on the waitlist and we'll hit you up when it's ready!

Neck and traps are a lot less tense. One of the main reasons I quit was because I was getting very bad neck pain all day, for 4 years after an injury. Hoping this keeps improving.

Also seem to be able to manage alcohol wsy better. Had a few beers last night and woke up feeling pretty fine this AM.. usually I get the worst hangovers and 2 beers kill me the next day.

Been having decafs to help the cravings. I still love the taste of coffee.

When I first got it, it was nice but felt a little stiff and “new.” Now it’s got this worn-in character, soft edges, and a patina that makes it feel like it belongs to me.

I’ve spilled coffee on it, thrown it around, stuffed it full of heavy books, and it hasn’t fallen apart. A little conditioning every once in a while keeps it supple, but really it’s mostly just time and use that make it look this good.

I’ve tried cheaper leather bags before and they always end up cracking or losing shape within a year or two. This one, though, feels like it will last decades. If you’re thinking of investing in a leather bag, I’d say go for quality and don’t be afraid to let it age naturally.

Curious how you all feel about this. Do you prefer your leather stuff looking pristine or do you like it to develop a story over the years?",1,1768465321.0,ProductQuery,0,1.0,False
1qde0ta,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1qde0ta/i_dreamed_i_was_trapped_in_an_infinite_office_and/,"I dreamed I was trapped in an infinite office, and I couldn’t stop eating the bricks","Dream Log: 01/15/26

The dream started with a taste. Metal, wet glue, and for some strange marzipan. I hate marzipan. 

I was Ana. Or maybe I was watching her, but it felt like me at the same time. I’m not sure where that shift happened. I ate a brick, and for some reason, it made perfect sense while it was happening.

The air in the office felt thick, like sticky notes crawling toward my shoes to file complaints about my existence. Every step made the floor feel like wet paper folding under me.

I remember thinking I should step carefully, but I also knew it wouldn’t help. I was already part of whatever was happening.

[The Office Logic]

You don’t just enter the office. It enters you. That felt true in a way I didn’t question.

I looked up and saw myself drifting toward the ceiling, my jaw unhinging in a way that felt wrong but normal at the same time. My teeth were humming. I remember thinking it sounded mechanical, maybe like satellites, but that could be something I’m adding now.

The mirrors didn’t reflect me. They archived me. They muttered about my posture and filed me under “Mildly Annoying Humans.”

When I looked down, I saw dozens of versions of me arguing over who deserved the fluorescent light. I couldn’t tell which one I was supposed to be.

Gravity just gave up. That’s the only way I can describe it.

[The Harold Variable]

Then there was Harold.

Harold floated past with his tie twitching in a way that made my stomach tighten. He felt important, like the dream was organized around him for reasons I didn’t understand. He leaned in close, smelling like ozone and old coffee, and asked, “Do you think the stapler has feelings, or am I overthinking this?”

Even in the dream, I felt irritated by him. That part was very clear.

The pens around me were whispering. The ceiling tiles felt judgmental. The coffee machine made a sound like it was sighing.

Then Harold wasn’t there anymore. Or he changed into something else. I can’t remember the exact transition, only that he stopped being a person.

[The Shift]

Time stopped behaving normally after that. Gravity felt sideways, like I was standing incorrectly.

I remember the smell of toner and a vague memory of my first stapler jam, even though I don’t know why that mattered.

The bricks were arranged neatly, like coworkers in a meeting. They were humming. One of them seemed angry at me, like I had failed it somehow.

My heartbeat felt synced with the coffee machine.

Another brick hovered above me.

Harold appeared again, but he looked partially melted, like wax. He asked if the office was haunted or if he was just underpaid. The question felt important at the time.

I tried to leave, but there wasn’t really an exit.

A photocopier produced a piece of paper that felt very old. I didn’t read it, but I knew it was meant for me.

The fluorescent lights were blinking. I thought it might be Morse code, but I don’t actually know Morse code, so that could be my brain filling things in.

[The Wake Up]

The last brick acknowledged me. I don’t know how else to explain that.

I swallowed it, and I felt its weight settle in my stomach.

The ceiling tiles were chanting something about Harold, but I can’t remember the exact words anymore. Just the tone. Repetitive and mocking.

I woke up suddenly.

I’m sitting in my bed now, writing this while it’s still fresh. My jaw still feels tight, almost like it’s buzzing. My room smells faintly like ozone, which doesn’t make sense.

I keep glancing at my wardrobe because for a second after I woke up, I thought I saw a sticky note move near it. I know that’s probably leftover dream imagery, but it unsettled me.

Has anyone else had something like this? The office, the bricks, or a man named Harold with a twitching tie?

I might be mixing parts together, but the feeling of it is sticking with me more than usual.
