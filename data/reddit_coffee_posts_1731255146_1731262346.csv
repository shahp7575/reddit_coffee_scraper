It's been a bit of a rollercoaster, and I've found myself feeling a little adrift and in need of a genuine connection. My friends are amazing, but I'm craving someone new to share stories and experiences with.

Lately, I've been reflecting on what I want from life and relationships. I've had a few casual dates, but nothing that felt truly meaningful. Seeing my friends in committed relationships makes me hopeful but also a bit anxious about finding that special someone who truly understands me. I'm passionate about literature, love exploring new coffee shops, and have a soft spot for indie films. It would be wonderful to meet someone who shares these interests or introduces me to new ones.

Has anyone else felt the weight of these thoughts? How did you overcome the fear of opening up to someone new? I'm looking for someone who I can connect with on a deeper level, someone who makes me feel valued and understood. Is that too much to hope for? Let's chat and see where our conversation takes us.",1,1731262141.0,Kikpals,1,1.0,False

Every second person on LinkedIn either works at J.P. Morgan or 8 figure e-commerce uses it. I was over it so I started looking at alternatives like 

- NeetoCal.com
- ⁠Cal.com, and 
- ⁠Acuity Scheduling

But even these platforms were missing essential features. So, I built something myself.

1. Here’s what we’ve built:

🤝AI-powered meetings: Take calls without anxiety while our AI handles all your notes, so you can just sip your coffee.

🫡Payment integration: Get paid before a call is booked. Or, if you prefer, offer a free call.

🎉Question & Document Collection: Gather important questions and documents before the call, making each meeting productive.

🥳Flexible Scheduling: Override specific times, dates, or even entire weeks, as needed.

2. Who’s it for?
Freelancers, marketing agencies, business owners, traditional businesses, and even Reddit marketers—this is for everyone.

IF YOU JUDGE ME THEN... PLEASE DON'T JUDGE ME... IF YOU JUDGE ME YOU'RE THE ONE WHO'S WRONG! IF YOU READ IT AND JUDGE ME THEN YOU DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE BOOK AT ALL (that would be possible and probably normal) idk what to say.... just don't judge me. nobody likes to be judged. 

you'll probably think: ew what a weirdo! 

you wouldn't be wrong to think that but i would feel kind of bad... anyway... i can't force ideas into your mind so let your mind wander wherever it wants but pls enjoy this book
(some of it is true some of it isn't... sometimes your mind can create things out of nothing and in the end you're like wtf but it's still amazing bcs your brain is a living world creating machine! it's literally so cool and so creepy at the same time... but anyway, as i was saying, this book (if i can call it a book) is a soup of randomness combining real and fictive worlds, events, persons, places, etc... a soup. 

(the blender is my brain.)
(maybe i'll try to make it less dark because life isn't always dark... sometimes it is but not always... theres a LOT of happiness in the world and we should really (en profiter au maximum). Please stay safe and be happy. 

if ur not, smile for 30 seconds i saw that on yt) 

SMILE and enjoy everything! sadness is good too. its incredible to think that we can feel sadness like woah... sometimes i feel like i don't want to be sad, I want to stop feeling sadness but that would mean stopping living and that's horrible. NOT LIVING. i wouldn't be immortal but not living, giving up, is really sad, too sad... even sadder than sadness itself... compared to death, sadness is a wonderful state, almost like happiness! 

If you're reading this text... then it means that you're really important to me (or that someone sent it to you!) you're loved, never let anyone tell you otherwise!!!!!!!!!!! 

okay, you read a lot (thx!). here's the book: 

(i am sorry for any mistakes/typos.... some of them are intentional but some aren't) 

I hope you'll love it and hate it as much as i do!
I hope i'll like it too 

*I AM LOVE, I AM AN ANGEL, I AM EVERYTHING. EVRYTHING, THIS IT WHAT I AM MADE OF.
(THE ULTIMATE TEMPORARY SOUL KILLING TEXTBOOK)* 

hope u like it! (you probably won't but still...) 

made with me
by love 

I am love, a light entity. I am blessed, I am a blessing. Love runs in my veins. 

(note: no i didn't and i would never take drugs i just wrote random stuff bcs why not and yeah!) 

during my lesson, drugs are forbidden because they blind you... some people may say that they open your third eye but they don't. they show you a fake world. nobody wants a fake world. i don't. do you?

Welcome to Innards Haven, have a great fucking carnage session! We hope you'll enjoy your stay! 

Sasha walks towards the front desk. A woman caught in a phone call, welcomes Sasha with the smile she gives to every regular (costumer).
She signs him to wait with her index finger.
She takes a sip of blood flavored coffee and she swallows quickly.
-...4PM?... Okay... Good! Have a wonderful day m'am!
She hangs up and stands up in a jump. 

-Greetings Sasha! What can I do for you today?
-Hi Poly! I would like t- 

""Cut me the fuck open! Y-yeah... Right there! Pull on my guts!!!"" 

-I just told them to stop screaming... It's so stupid, why won't she pay for a Pearl Room...? Anyway, what were you saying? 

-I wanted to try one of the new Syncrs, are they ready yet? 

-Yeah, they're more than ready! They were used 52 times since we've made them available! 

-Oh really? I'm already missing out I guess.
-Haha i guess we could say that! So, what do you want?
-A Basic Room, Surgery Play, Syncr and... which Numbers are available?
Poly places a small tablet in front of Sasha.
A seemingly never ending list of numbers appear before his eyes. Some are white, while others are gray or black.

She drops into her chair and starts typing the costumer's order. She takes a big sip from her cup.
[BASIC.SURGERY.SYNCR.0736]
-Your InID?

*clck tck tick clac takc.... beep*

-Alright Poly!
Sasha smiles and heads to the waiting room (salle d'attente). Black leather chairs covered (in/of) sharp silver spikes, two double rows of ten shiny chairs facing eachother. Some of the seats are taken. A man is smoking while reading the latest Virtual Meat Market magazine.

V.M.M.
Virtual Meat Market
*[BLACKMAILING DISCOUNT FRENZY AT V.M.M.]*
V.M.M. doesn't exist. It's immaterial, virtual. You could compare it to a alley in a supermarket. Soups/sauces, snacks/cookies, milk/cheese... It's not even that big! Just a random alley in a random supermarket... well not really... Because V.M. is the biggest supermarket in the world! It's wonderful! When I say ""super"" I mean something like ""on steroids"" or ""on drugs"" because that's really how it is! Visualize cows on a dairy farm. What do the farmers need to do to make more money? They need to produce more milk, but to do so there aren't a thousand ways... So they ""boost"" the cows. Ehanced championship ready top of podium doped cows! That exactly what they do with the V.M., they boost it to the fucking max. 

YOU CAN DO ANYTHING YOU CAN OWN ANYTHING YOU CAN YOU CAN YOU CAN ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE NO THIS ISN'T A DREAM YOU'RE NOT UNDER THE  INFLUENCE OF DRUGS THE VIRTUAL WORLD EXISTS!!! EMBRACE THIS WHOLE NEW REALITY THIS MAGICAL WORLD IS WAITING FOR YOU!!! DEMATERIALISE TO GAIN MORE SPACE FOR USELESS TRAUMATIZING THINGS! YOU LOVE THE INTERNET AND THE INTERNET LOVES YOU! 

You'll never break free. 

Drugs
Weapons

Illegal porn

-Honey, I feel like there's something missing...
-Oh, actually I think you forgot the milk.
-Thanks! 
*kiss*
.............
WELCOME TO VIRTUAL MARKET!
(smile for the cameras!)
:):):):):):):):):):):):):):)
*supermarket jingle*
*muzak*
The signs over the alleys read:
- A Lot Of People's Lives (100% discount on products you personally know!!!)
-Worldwide Products!!! (exotic products!!! some even manufactured by real slaves!!!)
-Unreleased/Banned Products! (drugs, humans, weapons...!)
-Entertainement For Humans! (litterature! cinematography! sports! pornography! games! and much more!!!)
...
alleys never stop appearing at the Virtual Market, it's a never ending cycle. They just appear... They're not there but the moment you blink... thousands of new alleys appear. 

They don't have what I fucking want. I want the fucking cure, the answers. They don't have that, I can only trust myself. DOCTORS NEED TO GET PAYED AND I GOTTA GO TO SCHOOL... (actually does it cost money to go see a doc? probably not... forget what I said...) I can't ask a doctor to give me the cure because it doesn't physically exist... actually the cure could be ""telling my brain to shut the fuck up because I have my own creativity, ideas and my way is special in its own way."" but it's oh so hard to accept this answer, to swallow this pill, to let your body process the molecules.... I HATE IT. I hate overthinking, jealousy, complicated relationships... NOT HAVING WHAT THE FUCK I WANT! Give me what i want. I'm not asking to God or anyone... I'm just asking. ASK AND U SHALL RECEIVEEEEE!!!!!!!!!! Imagine being your best friend, but like actually. You both like the same things, you do everything together, you listen to the same music, you have the same friends.... Imagine liking yourself 100%... but not to a sexual extent... just liking yourself. It probably isn't possible.

# *[MILULU'S SAGA]* by lulubenene

# MILULU'S BEACH.
Today, I went to the beach. It was really fun. Water, sand and people.

But something happened.

I was playing a game on my phone bcs i didn't want to go swim, get wet... Yeah I know, I'm boring, but I also really wanted to start playing that goddamn game (Subarashiki Hibi). So there I was, sitting in a tent, hiding from the sun reading a vn. Balls occasionally hitting the tent. At one point, i had to go pee, like I HAD TO FUCKING PEE. I started looking for a washroom. It was located at the fucking exact opposite of where we were. I passed by strangers, barbecues and clouds of flies. THE FUCKING MEN WASHROOM WAS CLOSED BCS THE JANITOR WAS CLEANING IT. So i took a place in line, waiting for the door to open. A man, took place next to me. After some time, the door finally opened! I entered a stall and the man entered the one next to mine. I sat down and peed. I felt something on my leg, i looked down. Liquid was dripping off of the other's stall wall, forming a puddle. Drops splish splashing on my leg. EW EW EWE EW THE MAN WAS PISSING ON THE WALL AND HIS URINE WAS ON ME. STOP STOP STOP. I was so fucking disgusted. Pee y'all, fucking piss. CAN'T YOU FUCKING LEARN HOW TO AIM YOU DUMBASS MOTHERFUCKER!? IF YOU REALLY CAN'T JUST FUCKING SIT DOWN ON THE DAMN TOILET. I moved away from the wall and the puddle as much as I could. Fuck. Even so, his piss was still splish splashing on me. The was my first golden shower i guess? Hahaha. When he finally got out, urine was still dripping off of the wall into the yellow puddle. My feelings were all mixed up, I felt like crying and laughing at the same time. I silently laughed out of uneasiness. This stranger just (accidentally?) peed on me. Well, at least it wasn't in my mouth or something... I got out of the stall in a state of panic. How tf was i supposed to wash piss off of my legs at the beach?? Taking a swim seemed like the most logical option, but I wouldn't feel comfortable with a soap-free option... I also could put soap all over my legs... How tf would i rinse it??? By taking a fucking swim? Yeah, but the beach was like really far away, that meant walking with hand soap all over my legs in front of strangers. I used wet paper towels to wash off as much pee as i could, washed my hands and got out. That's when i saw it! God didn't abandon me! A bottle of hand sanitizer!!!! I put an outrageously big amount of hand sanitizer in my hands and rubbed it all over my legs. Drunk legs, surgery room level sanitized legs. The new cocktail: legs, water, salt, sweat, urine, alcohol. I passed the BBQs, the strangers and the clouds a flies, swallowing some bugs on my way to the tent. Seasoned legs and fresh living protein snacks, that's what i got from the washroom.

# MILULU'S NYC.
I LOVED GOING TO NEW YORK! What a beautiful city. There's a lot of people there, rich ones and poor ones. We saw a lot of things! The Statue Of Liberty, Ground Zero, World Trade Center, Grand Central Terminal...
One of my favorite was Summit One Vanderbilt. It's a huge tower, the highest in New York. We took an elevator that took us like 90 floors high in like 40 seconds. Flashing, mirror covered elevator. Metallic decors, mirror floors, huge windows, silver balloons, art expo... Everything was beautiful, EVEN THE WASHROOM!! There was fog but it was still very beautiful and impressive. We went to so many different places. The amount of people is overwhelming. Umbrellas, flowers and ponchos sellers. We walked a lot, went in various stores! We even went to the UGG store! We also went to the Nike store. SHOES, THERE'S SHOES EVERYWHERE! I walked around. I had to pee, again. So i looked for a washroom. It was located in a creepy hallway.  As i was walking, i saw two men talking. I noticed the washrooms' doors. I didn't know if the men were waiting to go or if they were waiting for someone so I tried to open one of the doors. As soon as I opened the door, I heard a steady rhythm. Breathing. Up, down. I WAS LOOKING AT A STRANGER JERKING OFF. He was facing the wall, aiming for the toilet. His right arm beating the shit out of his meat. He didn't even turn back to look at me. I don't even think that he knew I was there. I closed the door. I walked away pretty fast. The I heard one of the two men say: ""You good bro?"" I was like WHAT THE FUCK? Was he talking to me or to the dude who was jerking off behind the unlocked door???? Like, yo. I loved NYC. Y'ALL SHOULD GO TO NYC!

# MILULU'S FAKE LOVE CONFESSION.

Yeah. The title.

I used to use Discord a lot. A WHOLE FUCKING LOT. I ""knew"" a lot of people. During my downward spiralling, I met a Brasilian boy online. Here's what he told me:
He's around 14
He's Brasilian
He's a boy
He used to send nudes to strangers
He doesn't have a lot of friends irl
... Blah blahhhh

We made a promise: Never send nudes to strangers ever again and never watch shota ever again. In my opinion, that isn't a bad idea... I think that there shouldn't be any children doing disgusting things for adults.

We failed. I told him that I had failed and he told me that he had also failed. He felt so fucking bad. He kept saying that he was a mess. He wanted to kill himslef. He told me that he was drunk and that his parents were away. I tried to calm him down. I was so fucking stressed out. I was trying to save someone's life in the middle of the night. 

Then, one night, during a family party, he texted me to confess his feelings... What the fuck was i supposed to do? I DIDN'T WANT HIM TO KILL HIMSELF.... so i told him that i loved him too... I know it's wrong, but like... Idk what would've happened if I told him that he didn't interest me bcs BRO I DON'T FUCKING KNOW YOU, I NEVER EVEN TOUCHED OR SAW YOU. he was happy, but still a bit depressed.

Then he started saying lover typa things. He wanted us to share nudes bcs ""that's the kinda things a couple do"". I refused because we promised to never do that again. I told him to do as he wanted, but that I wouldn't send nudes. He sent a dick pic. I didn't know what to answer. Since I didn't instantly answer, he deleted the picture and started saying that he was so stupid and that I didn't like him... He started to panic and all. I was scared as fuck. Only I knew that he was depressed. Well, actually i still don't know if it was just a lie or if it was true. I don't really want to know.

I don't even remember if I told him ""bye"" when i deleted my account. I don't think i did, but idk.

I just wanted to get rid of everything.

# MILULU'S NON-CON FANTASY.
Once, I went to the beach(?). I was wearing shorts that were a little too short for me. I was picking up pebbles to do ricochets. Then i saw a group of men. I wanted them to look at me, to want me. Every single pebble picking movement was planned. Bend over, arch your back, get back up in a tantalizing way...... I wanted to trap them. I wanted to get trapped by them. But like wtf was I expecting? To be able to turn three men into gay pedophiles? Well, i was trying. Rape me. 
Life isn't a porn film. People don't just randomly fuck eachother for no reason. There's laws. Adults can't fuck kids. Pedophilia is really bad

# MILULU'S DRUNK CALL.
Drink, after drink, after drink. Shots, shots, shots. Cake and chips. Water. Heyyyyyy!!!!
I called my friends while i was drunk. It was fun, but not the next day. You feel so slutty when your drunk. So free. But when you're too drunk, you just feel like shit.

# MILULU'S NEW FRIEND.
I met this Asian girl online. She was pretty nice and normal at first. We were talking about our favorite mangas and other things. At one point, we started talking about our kinks. Her's were shota and guro. WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT WEIRD ASS PSYCHOPATIC PEDOPHILIAC MIX????!!! GURL- girl was a pedonecrophile. She made me join a private server with her friends. It was full of gory shota content. Dead  or beat up manga boys in inappropriate positions. LIKE WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU!? At that moment I didn't really care because, she wasn't mean to me, she actually was pretty nice. But now that i think about it, this girl had a serious problem.

# MILULU'S BEDROOM.
there's this atmosphere in a bedroom.
It's reassuring but worrying. It's your space but you're away from everyone. You feel like you should be with everyone else, but you just do nothing. You have to force yourself to get up and leave that comfort. You have to leave your comfort to use your time. You feel like you have to do all these things, but do you really have to? I just wanna be always comfortable. I wanna gain knowledge, skills and experience while being comfortable. But you get nothing if you do nothing. Doing nothing isn't fun. But how am I supposed to be 100% comfortable when I'm not good at something? What's better?

# MILULU'S BRIDGE.
The bridge. One week out of two, I walk home from school. I have to cross that bridge. It's usually windy. Comfortable during summer, cold as fuck during winter. Sometimes, I stop to look at the water under me. Sometimes throwing things in the water. It really beautiful. But it's dirty bcs of pollution. What would it feel like to jump in the water? I don't want to do it i am just wondering. How high, how long, how scary, how cold? I'll never jump off that bridge because, why would I? I'm not depressed, I live a beautiful life.

Fucking mess, talentless mess

# MILULU'S HATRED (random) (extremely abridged sample)


(sorry, WELL ACTUALLY BRUH NAH FUCK OFF, WHY WOULD I HAVE TO BE SORRY, I'M A GODDAMN ARTIST! A VISIONARY! I AM ART!)

I fucking hate school. I don't get how there's people who want to become teachers. A shitty job. You're in school during your youth and you go back to school during your adulthood. What the fuck. Help. Who wants to get mocked by stupid teenagers.

AHWHSHDBFJ I don't.

I hate.
I just hate.
Idk what but i do.
I'm mad at something.
Something's missing.
The missing piece.
There's a hole inside of me. I mean there's many holes outside and inside of me but there's one specific hole that just moves around and changes shape inside of me. I hate it. It's longing ig. Longing for ""something"". Something unknown. I long for success maybe?

HAHAHSHWBSID FBF IF SOMEONE READS THIS THEY'LL BE LIKE: WHAT THE FUCK? I don't get it? 

I can't help you understand i don't even understand it myself.
It's just
It's just a canvas with parts of my brain squished, pasted, stapled, emptied all over it. 
I'm having fun for real, writing is fun. When you start it's like a waterfall, it's endless.
Thoughts.

It's just another random text. I guess someone might've written some sentences i write with the words disposed differently in other contexts hahahahahah lets make some!!!

Sentences with shuffled words.

5555 words. It must be a sign. (More like 666 or 69 hahsheonadjfkdn)

Okayyyyy so. Lets pick a random sentence!

-there's this atmosphere in a bedroom.
there's a bedroom in this atmosphere.

-I'll never jump off that bridge because, why would I?
why would that bridge jump off I? Because I'll never.

-I didn't know if the men were waiting to go or if they were waiting for someone so I tried to open one of the doors.
I didn't know if the doors were waiting for one of the men, or if they were waiting for someone to open, so I tried to go.

-How tf was i supposed to wash piss off of my legs at the beach??
How tf was the beach supposed to wash my legs off of my piss?? (WHERE TF SHOULD I PUT THE ""AT"")

there's probably words missing jahahahagahsbdnwksbs pls tell me if it's the case

hHahabaheiabxbx hahahHAHAHAHAHAHHA SHEHSBSB AHAHSH
Jahavxjd.


Please tell me I'm an artist, tell me I'm a genius tell me I'm incredible tell me i am special tell me i am a visionary a game changer... Tellll meeee when did i go wrong what did i do to make you change your mind completely when i thought that we love would never end......... what if this love's not ours to have.... (are the lyrics correct?) HAHAJWKSNHEHEHEHRB i love music. 

Classical, modern yummmm its like caviar. It taste like unborn baby fishies. Eating babies is common in the bourgeoisie! It's really chic. Small black pearls full of fish DNA.

I never tasted caviar i think. Idk.


# MILULU'S LANGUAGE
why am i writing in english?

# MILULU DOESN'T KNOW WHAT TO WRITE ANYMORE
i just noticed that i forgot periods at the end of titles...
not that i really care but i noticed. There's a whole lot of mistakes in my text and i am totally aware of it. Imagine having to stop at every mistakes. Is art only for virtuosos who never make any mistakes????? Fuck them. I fucking hate them. Good for them, but.... ARHEBDBFNF.

# MILULU IS A SLUT (in theory but not in practice)
Milulu wanted to be a slut so bad. He wanted to be the sluttiest slut of all. 
Dress up like
Move like
Act like
Think like
Talk like

a slut

(must?)

  - accept that everything they say or do can have consequences
  - abandon themselves to sluttiness
  - adopt a whore's way of living
  - fuck it just
  - bruh
  - just
  - be 
  - a 
  - fucking 
  - slut
  - you
  - fucking 
  - shit
  - !

Lie, you must lie.
Lie until you're not able to tell the truth anymore.
Have fun and let others make fun of you slut.

LIE about your lifestyle


If you don't you'll look fucked up







You are. (Or not)

# MILULU ISN'T SPECIAL(?)
Milulu is depressed, so he must be special, right? Is Milulu depressed? Probably not.

Milulu doesn't know how he feels anymore. He just feels special. Is he? No.

what if i wrote a good text?
what if i wrote something interesting?
imagine being content.

I'm so normal, my life is normal and I'm okay with it.
I live in a peaceful country and we're not poor.
Even if i don't like it, i go to school.
We celebrate holidays.
We smile and laugh a lot.
I love living.
Being me.

But i feel like there's something missing.
I wonder if all my worries about what's missing will go away, when I'll be in a romantic relationship... Probably

Because I'll be enough for someone, I'll be the best at being myself for this person.
They'll be my world.

I'm not crazy, i just type rapidly.

I am normal.

IF YOU JUDGE ME THEN... PLEASE DON'T JUDGE ME... IF YOU JUDGE ME YOU'RE THE ONE WHO'S WRONG! IF YOU READ IT AND JUDGE ME THEN YOU DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE BOOK AT ALL (that would be possible and probably normal) idk what to say.... just don't judge me. nobody likes to be judged. 

you'll probably think: ew what a weirdo! 

you wouldn't be wrong to think that but i would feel kind of bad... anyway... i can't force ideas into your mind so let your mind wander wherever it wants but pls enjoy this book
(some of it is true some of it isn't... sometimes your mind can create things out of nothing and in the end you're like wtf but it's still amazing bcs your brain is a living world creating machine! it's literally so cool and so creepy at the same time... but anyway, as i was saying, this book (if i can call it a book) is a soup of randomness combining real and fictive worlds, events, persons, places, etc... a soup. 

(the blender is my brain.)
(maybe i'll try to make it less dark because life isn't always dark... sometimes it is but not always... theres a LOT of happiness in the world and we should really (en profiter au maximum). Please stay safe and be happy. 

if ur not, smile for 30 seconds i saw that on yt) 

SMILE and enjoy everything! sadness is good too. its incredible to think that we can feel sadness like woah... sometimes i feel like i don't want to be sad, I want to stop feeling sadness but that would mean stopping living and that's horrible. NOT LIVING. i wouldn't be immortal but not living, giving up, is really sad, too sad... even sadder than sadness itself... compared to death, sadness is a wonderful state, almost like happiness! 

If you're reading this text... then it means that you're really important to me (or that someone sent it to you!) you're loved, never let anyone tell you otherwise!!!!!!!!!!! 

okay, you read a lot (thx!). here's the book: 

(i am sorry for any mistakes/typos.... some of them are intentional but some aren't) 

I hope you'll love it and hate it as much as i do!
I hope i'll like it too 

*I AM LOVE, I AM AN ANGEL, I AM EVERYTHING. EVRYTHING, THIS IT WHAT I AM MADE OF.

hope u like it! (you probably won't but still...)

I am love, a light entity. I am blessed, I am a blessing. Love runs in my veins. 

(note: no i didn't and i would never take drugs i just wrote random stuff bcs why not and yeah!) 

during my lesson, drugs are forbidden because they blind you... some people may say that they open your third eye but they don't. they show you a fake world. nobody wants a fake world. i don't. do you?

Welcome to Innards Haven, have a great fucking carnage session! We hope you'll enjoy your stay! 

Sasha walks towards the front desk. A woman caught in a phone call, welcomes Sasha with the smile she gives to every regular (costumer).
She signs him to wait with her index finger.
She takes a sip of blood flavored coffee and she swallows quickly.
-...4PM?... Okay... Good! Have a wonderful day m'am!
She hangs up and stands up in a jump. 

-Greetings Sasha! What can I do for you today?
-Hi Poly! I would like t- 

""Cut me the fuck open! Y-yeah... Right there! Pull on my guts!!!"" 

-I just told them to stop screaming... It's so stupid, why won't she pay for a Pearl Room...? Anyway, what were you saying? 

-I wanted to try one of the new Syncrs, are they ready yet? 

-Yeah, they're more than ready! They were used 52 times since we've made them available! 

-Oh really? I'm already missing out I guess.
-Haha i guess we could say that! So, what do you want?
-A Basic Room, Surgery Play, Syncr and... which Numbers are available?
Poly places a small tablet in front of Sasha.
A seemingly never ending list of numbers appear before his eyes. Some are white, while others are gray or black.

V.M.M.
Virtual Meat Market
*[BLACKMAILING DISCOUNT FRENZY AT V.M.M.]*
V.M.M. doesn't exist. It's immaterial, virtual. You could compare it to a alley in a supermarket. Soups/sauces, snacks/cookies, milk/cheese... It's not even that big! Just a random alley in a random supermarket... well not really... Because V.M. is the biggest supermarket in the world! It's wonderful! When I say ""super"" I mean something like ""on steroids"" or ""on drugs"" because that's really how it is! Visualize cows on a dairy farm. What do the farmers need to do to make more money? They need to produce more milk, but to do so there aren't a thousand ways... So they ""boost"" the cows. Ehanced championship ready top of podium doped cows! That exactly what they do with the V.M., they boost it to the fucking max.

WELCOME TO VIRTUAL MARKET!
(smile for the cameras!)
:):):):):):):):):):):):):):)
*supermarket jingle*
*muzak*
The signs over the alleys read:
- A Lot Of People's Lives (100% discount on products you personally know!!!)
-Worldwide Products!!! (exotic products!!! some even manufactured by real slaves!!!)
-Unreleased/Banned Products! (drugs, humans, weapons...!)
-Entertainement For Humans! (litterature! cinematography! sports! pornography! games! and much more!!!)
...
alleys never stop appearing at the Virtual Market, it's a never ending cycle. They just appear... They're not there but the moment you blink... thousands of new alleys appear. 

They don't have what I fucking want. I want the fucking cure, the answers. They don't have that, I can only trust myself. DOCTORS NEED TO GET PAYED AND I GOTTA GO TO SCHOOL... (actually does it cost money to go see a doc? probably not... forget what I said...) I can't ask a doctor to give me the cure because it doesn't physically exist... actually the cure could be ""telling my brain to shut the fuck up because I have my own creativity, ideas and my way is special in its own way."" but it's oh so hard to accept this answer, to swallow this pill, to let your body process the molecules.... I HATE IT. I hate overthinking, jealousy, complicated relationships... NOT HAVING WHAT THE FUCK I WANT! Give me what i want. I'm not asking to God or anyone... I'm just asking. ASK AND U SHALL RECEIVEEEEE!!!!!!!!!! Imagine being your best friend, but like actually. You both like the same things, you do everything together, you listen to the same music, you have the same friends.... Imagine liking yourself 100%... but not to a sexual extent... just liking yourself. It probably isn't possible.

# MILULU'S BEACH.
Today, I went to the beach. It was really fun. Water, sand and people.

But something happened.

I was playing a game on my phone bcs i didn't want to go swim, get wet... Yeah I know, I'm boring, but I also really wanted to start playing that goddamn game (Subarashiki Hibi). So there I was, sitting in a tent, hiding from the sun reading a vn. Balls occasionally hitting the tent. At one point, i had to go pee, like I HAD TO FUCKING PEE. I started looking for a washroom. It was located at the fucking exact opposite of where we were. I passed by strangers, barbecues and clouds of flies. THE FUCKING MEN WASHROOM WAS CLOSED BCS THE JANITOR WAS CLEANING IT. So i took a place in line, waiting for the door to open. A man, took place next to me. After some time, the door finally opened! I entered a stall and the man entered the one next to mine. I sat down and peed. I felt something on my leg, i looked down. Liquid was dripping off of the other's stall wall, forming a puddle. Drops splish splashing on my leg. EW EW EWE EW THE MAN WAS PISSING ON THE WALL AND HIS URINE WAS ON ME. STOP STOP STOP. I was so fucking disgusted. Pee y'all, fucking piss. CAN'T YOU FUCKING LEARN HOW TO AIM YOU DUMBASS MOTHERFUCKER!? IF YOU REALLY CAN'T JUST FUCKING SIT DOWN ON THE DAMN TOILET. I moved away from the wall and the puddle as much as I could. Fuck. Even so, his piss was still splish splashing on me. The was my first golden shower i guess? Hahaha. When he finally got out, urine was still dripping off of the wall into the yellow puddle. My feelings were all mixed up, I felt like crying and laughing at the same time. I silently laughed out of uneasiness. This stranger just (accidentally?) peed on me. Well, at least it wasn't in my mouth or something... I got out of the stall in a state of panic. How tf was i supposed to wash piss off of my legs at the beach?? Taking a swim seemed like the most logical option, but I wouldn't feel comfortable with a soap-free option... I also could put soap all over my legs... How tf would i rinse it??? By taking a fucking swim? Yeah, but the beach was like really far away, that meant walking with hand soap all over my legs in front of strangers. I used wet paper towels to wash off as much pee as i could, washed my hands and got out. That's when i saw it! God didn't abandon me! A bottle of hand sanitizer!!!! I put an outrageously big amount of hand sanitizer in my hands and rubbed it all over my legs. Drunk legs, surgery room level sanitized legs. The new cocktail: legs, water, salt, sweat, urine, alcohol. I passed the BBQs, the strangers and the clouds a flies, swallowing some bugs on my way to the tent. Seasoned legs and fresh living protein snacks, that's what i got from the washroom.

# MILULU'S NYC.
I LOVED GOING TO NEW YORK! What a beautiful city. There's a lot of people there, rich ones and poor ones. We saw a lot of things! The Statue Of Liberty, Ground Zero, World Trade Center, Grand Central Terminal...
One of my favorite was Summit One Vanderbilt. It's a huge tower, the highest in New York. We took an elevator that took us like 90 floors high in like 40 seconds. Flashing, mirror covered elevator. Metallic decors, mirror floors, huge windows, silver balloons, art expo... Everything was beautiful, EVEN THE WASHROOM!! There was fog but it was still very beautiful and impressive. We went to so many different places. The amount of people is overwhelming. Umbrellas, flowers and ponchos sellers. We walked a lot, went in various stores! We even went to the UGG store! We also went to the Nike store. SHOES, THERE'S SHOES EVERYWHERE! I walked around. I had to pee, again. So i looked for a washroom. It was located in a creepy hallway.  As i was walking, i saw two men talking. I noticed the washrooms' doors. I didn't know if the men were waiting to go or if they were waiting for someone so I tried to open one of the doors. As soon as I opened the door, I heard a steady rhythm. Breathing. Up, down. I WAS LOOKING AT A STRANGER JERKING OFF. He was facing the wall, aiming for the toilet. His right arm beating the shit out of his meat. He didn't even turn back to look at me. I don't even think that he knew I was there. I closed the door. I walked away pretty fast. The I heard one of the two men say: ""You good bro?"" I was like WHAT THE FUCK? Was he talking to me or to the dude who was jerking off behind the unlocked door???? Like, yo. I loved NYC. Y'ALL SHOULD GO TO NYC!

# MILULU'S FAKE LOVE CONFESSION.

Yeah. The title.

I used to use Discord a lot. A WHOLE FUCKING LOT. I ""knew"" a lot of people. During my downward spiralling, I met a Brasilian boy online. Here's what he told me:
He's around 14
He's Brasilian
He's a boy
He used to send nudes to strangers
He doesn't have a lot of friends irl
... Blah blahhhh

We made a promise: Never send nudes to strangers ever again and never watch shota ever again. In my opinion, that isn't a bad idea... I think that there shouldn't be any children doing disgusting things for adults.

We failed. I told him that I had failed and he told me that he had also failed. He felt so fucking bad. He kept saying that he was a mess. He wanted to kill himslef. He told me that he was drunk and that his parents were away. I tried to calm him down. I was so fucking stressed out. I was trying to save someone's life in the middle of the night. 

Then, one night, during a family party, he texted me to confess his feelings... What the fuck was i supposed to do? I DIDN'T WANT HIM TO KILL HIMSELF.... so i told him that i loved him too... I know it's wrong, but like... Idk what would've happened if I told him that he didn't interest me bcs BRO I DON'T FUCKING KNOW YOU, I NEVER EVEN TOUCHED OR SAW YOU. he was happy, but still a bit depressed.

Then he started saying lover typa things. He wanted us to share nudes bcs ""that's the kinda things a couple do"". I refused because we promised to never do that again. I told him to do as he wanted, but that I wouldn't send nudes. He sent a dick pic. I didn't know what to answer. Since I didn't instantly answer, he deleted the picture and started saying that he was so stupid and that I didn't like him... He started to panic and all. I was scared as fuck. Only I knew that he was depressed. Well, actually i still don't know if it was just a lie or if it was true. I don't really want to know.

I don't even remember if I told him ""bye"" when i deleted my account. I don't think i did, but idk.

I just wanted to get rid of everything.

# MILULU'S NON-CON FANTASY.
Once, I went to the beach(?). I was wearing shorts that were a little too short for me. I was picking up pebbles to do ricochets. Then i saw a group of men. I wanted them to look at me, to want me. Every single pebble picking movement was planned. Bend over, arch your back, get back up in a tantalizing way...... I wanted to trap them. I wanted to get trapped by them. But like wtf was I expecting? To be able to turn three men into gay pedophiles? Well, i was trying. Rape me. 
Life isn't a porn film. People don't just randomly fuck eachother for no reason. There's laws. Adults can't fuck kids. Pedophilia is really bad

# MILULU'S DRUNK CALL.
Drink, after drink, after drink. Shots, shots, shots. Cake and chips. Water. Heyyyyyy!!!!
I called my friends while i was drunk. It was fun, but not the next day. You feel so slutty when your drunk. So free. But when you're too drunk, you just feel like shit.

# MILULU'S NEW FRIEND.
I met this Asian girl online. She was pretty nice and normal at first. We were talking about our favorite mangas and other things. At one point, we started talking about our kinks. Her's were shota and guro. WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT WEIRD ASS PSYCHOPATIC PEDOPHILIAC MIX????!!! GURL- girl was a pedonecrophile. She made me join a private server with her friends. It was full of gory shota content. Dead  or beat up manga boys in inappropriate positions. LIKE WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU!? At that moment I didn't really care because, she wasn't mean to me, she actually was pretty nice. But now that i think about it, this girl had a serious problem.

# MILULU'S BEDROOM.
there's this atmosphere in a bedroom.
It's reassuring but worrying. It's your space but you're away from everyone. You feel like you should be with everyone else, but you just do nothing. You have to force yourself to get up and leave that comfort. You have to leave your comfort to use your time. You feel like you have to do all these things, but do you really have to? I just wanna be always comfortable. I wanna gain knowledge, skills and experience while being comfortable. But you get nothing if you do nothing. Doing nothing isn't fun. But how am I supposed to be 100% comfortable when I'm not good at something? What's better?

# MILULU'S BRIDGE.
The bridge. One week out of two, I walk home from school. I have to cross that bridge. It's usually windy. Comfortable during summer, cold as fuck during winter. Sometimes, I stop to look at the water under me. Sometimes throwing things in the water. It really beautiful. But it's dirty bcs of pollution. What would it feel like to jump in the water? I don't want to do it i am just wondering. How high, how long, how scary, how cold? I'll never jump off that bridge because, why would I? I'm not depressed, I live a beautiful life.

Fucking mess, talentless mess

# MILULU'S HATRED (random) (extremely abridged sample)


(sorry, WELL ACTUALLY BRUH NAH FUCK OFF, WHY WOULD I HAVE TO BE SORRY, I'M A GODDAMN ARTIST! A VISIONARY! I AM ART!)

I fucking hate school. I don't get how there's people who want to become teachers. A shitty job. You're in school during your youth and you go back to school during your adulthood. What the fuck. Help. Who wants to get mocked by stupid teenagers.

AHWHSHDBFJ I don't.

I hate.
I just hate.
Idk what but i do.
I'm mad at something.
Something's missing.
The missing piece.
There's a hole inside of me. I mean there's many holes outside and inside of me but there's one specific hole that just moves around and changes shape inside of me. I hate it. It's longing ig. Longing for ""something"". Something unknown. I long for success maybe?

HAHAHSHWBSID FBF IF SOMEONE READS THIS THEY'LL BE LIKE: WHAT THE FUCK? I don't get it? 

I can't help you understand i don't even understand it myself.
It's just
It's just a canvas with parts of my brain squished, pasted, stapled, emptied all over it. 
I'm having fun for real, writing is fun. When you start it's like a waterfall, it's endless.
Thoughts.

It's just another random text. I guess someone might've written some sentences i write with the words disposed differently in other contexts hahahahahah lets make some!!!

Sentences with shuffled words.

5555 words. It must be a sign. (More like 666 or 69 hahsheonadjfkdn)

Okayyyyy so. Lets pick a random sentence!

-there's this atmosphere in a bedroom.

I never tasted caviar i think. Idk.


# MILULU'S LANGUAGE

# MILULU DOESN'T KNOW WHAT TO WRITE ANYMORE
i just noticed that i forgot periods at the end of titles...
not that i really care but i noticed. There's a whole lot of mistakes in my text and i am totally aware of it. Imagine having to stop at every mistakes. Is art only for virtuosos who never make any mistakes????? Fuck them. I fucking hate them. Good for them, but.... ARHEBDBFNF.

# MILULU IS A SLUT (in theory but not in practice)
Milulu wanted to be a slut so bad. He wanted to be the sluttiest slut of all. 
Dress up like

You are. (Or not)

# MILULU ISN'T SPECIAL(?)

what if i wrote a good text?
what if i wrote something interesting?
imagine being content.

I'm so normal, my life is normal and I'm okay with it.
I live in a peaceful country and we're not poor.
Even if i don't like it, i go to school.
We celebrate holidays.
We smile and laugh a lot.
I love living.
Being me.

But i feel like there's something missing.
I wonder if all my worries about what's missing will go away, when I'll be in a romantic relationship... Probably

Because I'll be enough for someone, I'll be the best at being myself for this person.
They'll be my world.

I'm not crazy, i just type rapidly.

I am normal.

We started with a 10 am breakfast reservation at Steakhouse 71. We planned to lyft to the hotel and then walk to Magic Kingdom when we were done. We had a slight hiccup with a car accident blocking the road to the Contemporary so we had the driver drop us off at Wilderness Lodge. We had plenty of time before our reservation so it was actually fun to take the water taxi to Magic Kingdom and then hop on the monorail to the Contemporary. I'm glad I did my research so I knew what to do.

Breakfast was at Steakhouse 71 awesome. Our server, Tim, was really sweet and took really good care of us. I was able to order a half order of the eggs benedict, which was great with the potatoes. My husband loved his prime rib hash, but wished the portion was bigger. The bread basket was yummy. 

After breakfast, a quick walk to Magic Kingdom and we had just enough time to make our virtual queue for Tiana's. We got there at the end of our hour, and we still waited 45 minutes to get on the ride, which I thought was annoying. It was a beautiful ride though and my favorite of the day. We then rode Pirates of the Carribean and went straight to waiting in line for 35 minutes to ride Jingle Cruise, which I would not do again. Lunch at Pinnochio's was not bad at all, the chicken tenders and chicken parm sandwich were satisfying. 

Next we went to Tomorrowland to ride the people mover. Loved it. After that I didn't feel like waiting in line at Joffrey's so we went to another spot for softserve with Joffrey's ice coffee, which I thought was not great. Next time I will wait in line for a fancy coffee at Joffrey's. After that we rode Haunted Mansion and Thunder Mountain Railroad which had really short wait times. Next was the train back to Main St. to freshen up my socks before doing one last walk around before we got on Tron before the park closed at 6 pm for the Christmas Party. The posted wait for Tron was 55 minutes but ended being 45 minutes and felt shorter. The ride was nuts, I blacked out for most of it. Incredible ride, but I am not a coaster person. I am proud of myself for riding it though.

After we left the park we took the water taxi to Wilderness Lodge for the best burger ever and the best flatbread ever - a charcuterie flatbread with meat, bear cheese, pickled onions, arugula, and balsamic glaze. The campfire mousse and fruit custard for dessert were the perfect ending to a really fun day. ",2,1731261524.0,WaltDisneyWorld,0,1.0,False

For several years, I have been facing a dilemma that gnaws at me internally. Nothing too serious; I am doing perfectly well, but sometimes my thoughts unwittingly unearth an indescribable feeling: a mix of incompleteness and resignation. I thought long and hard before deciding to make this post out of fear of exposing myself, being misunderstood, or mocked like many people who are too interested in UAPs (Unidentified Aerial Phenomena)...  
  
Nevertheless, I feel the need to share a discovery that I believe could prove important. Among you, there will undoubtedly be more skilled and inspired individuals who will know better than I how to make good use of it. I don’t know how you will receive my story; in any case, I sincerely hope that it will capture your attention and kindness.  
  
Here’s how it all began,  
  
Passionate about science since always, I managed to obtain a position as an engineer in a reputable and prestigious company. I was proud of it, even though the scientific aspect was unfortunately drowned in regulations and administration. Years went by... tedious projects were followed by soporific reports to the point that I would swear I had lived the life of a goldfish trapped in its bowl...  
  
Anyway, one day in the summer of 2019, I joined my colleagues at the coffee machine (I know it sounds cliché) to find a semblance of social interaction. That day, the discussion seemed particularly lively. Indeed, my colleagues were commenting on a New York Times article stating that the Pentagon had authenticated a video (FLIR1) of a UAP that had leaked a little earlier.  
  
At that time, I didn’t pay attention to these musings. Being a staunch advocate of critical thinking, I presumed it was a case of misunderstandings, misinformation, or hoaxes, and the story ended there due to a lack of tangible elements. However, this video intrigued me; it showed an object shaped like a Tic Tac, without wings, without propellers, no air intakes, no gas emissions, and yet it managed to keep a distance from an F18 Hornet...  
  
Without saying a word, I watched the video over and over again... questions and speculations were flying from all sides:  
\- Is it real? A weather balloon?  
\- Could it be an unknown natural phenomenon? Artificial? Is it a hoax?  
\- A prototype? How can it fly?  
\- What navigation instruments does it use? How does it propel itself?  
\- How does it steer? What was its trajectory?  
\- What could be its energy source?  
\- Why does the pilot maintain course while the object is out of sight???  
  
But very quickly, curiosity faded, and discussions returned to trivial matters... except for me... the more I became interested in this case, the more it fascinated me. For my colleagues, it was ultimately just a curious and insignificant anecdote. The fact that this object contradicted years of studies did not seem to affect them in the least. For my part, the feeling was diametrically opposed, and I kept questioning this mystery that had occurred 15 years earlier. Then, due to a lack of time, family obligations, and fatigue, I turned away from it, telling myself that, in any case, other people much more competent, better placed, and experienced had probably already studied the phenomenon from all angles.  
  
Shortly after the lockdown in France, I remember stumbling upon the documentary ""UFOs: A State Affair"" by Dominique FILHOL. I was astonished to see the former director of the DGSE, Alain JUILLET, express his perplexity regarding these phenomena, on which absolutely no information had apparently leaked in nearly 15 years!  
  
This story was becoming increasingly strange. That same night, I revisited the few drafts I had scribbled here and there. I then remembered an idea, a ""trick"" that had germinated in my mind, but at the time it seemed ""too naive"" to be taken seriously. To put it simply:

*Think of your aluminum soda can. Consider for a moment those who designed it and the very first question they must have asked: ""What dimensions offer an optimal volume for minimal aluminum cost?""*

*Without going into details, mathematics allows us to find the precise solution that optimizes both aspects. You just need to set up an equation for volume and surface area based on the same parameters (R radius and x height-to-length ratio). If all goes well, you obtain an equation that can be studied to find an optimum corresponding to the ideal pair R and x.*  
  
*Well... in practice, other parameters come into play (logistics, aesthetics, packaging, coating, varnish, etc.), which significantly distances us from the original solution.*

*Now imagine a future archaeologist who finds the remains of your can. They will be able to measure its dimensions and will perform the reverse reasoning to finally ascertain with certainty the optimization effort. Because there are a vast number of possibilities, but only one is optimized! Logically, they will conclude that this object was designed and produced by ingenious people.*  
  
And you see where this reasoning leads us: If the object is artificial, it is certain that its designers would have used their knowledge to maximize advantages while minimizing constraints—in a word: optimize. I emphasize that this is about searching for ""the trace of an optimization"" to confirm or refute the artificiality of the phenomenon. This approach does not claim to explain its technique or even less its origin. Assuming it is a hoax or a misunderstanding, there is very little chance of finding the trace of a ""fortuitous optimization.""  
  
So I start by formulating the volumes and surfaces of each part of the Tic Tac. I compare them all in the same table. Once my work is finished, I find that nothing particular stands out, just convoluted formulas containing x and R but nothing truly conclusive. The premises of my reasoning thus lead to a dead end and a manifest absence of optimization of the fuselage. ""What a waste of time... and to think I missed an episode of The IT Crowd for this!"" Science has spoken... this approach yields absolutely no results.  
  
... unless...  
  
What if we introduced a value for one of the two parameters? We cannot give an accurate estimate of the radius, but we can provide an approximate estimate of x by taking the height-to-length ratio from the video. I measure and find about 0.4. I then revisit the table, replacing x with this value.  
  
... and there, everything changes...  
  
I remember feeling dizzy; I was astonished! ... I went over and over all the calculations... no mistakes. There was indeed a particular relationship appearing for the precise value of x = 0,4. Until now, my approach was purely motivated by scientific curiosity and a critical approach... I didn’t genuinely expect a robust result... But suddenly, without even realizing it, I found myself facing a result I could not ignore: ""The phenomenon is undeniably the result of a judicious design."" If, like me, this result intrigues you, you may not be ready for what comes next...  
  
Remember, to optimize, you need a starting equation; well, this starting equation of the Tic Tac can be found, and here it is:

https://preview.redd.it/noi22o9u040e1.png?width=343&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c520fea6f40827e8a2b347fe5305546153af984

In concrete terms, it highlights a relationship between spherical and cylindrical surfaces and their respective volumes. This relationship disappears for any value of x other than 0,4. All calculations and demonstrations are, of course, available in the last part of this message so that everyone can access them freely and revisit them at leisure.  
  
Has anyone noticed this before? To my knowledge, no; I was the only one to have discovered this result or at least the only one willing to talk about it and make it known. Later, I would learn that an article discussing the shape of bacteria also revealed a relationship between volume and surface, but ultimately nothing comparable. Other than that, nothing!  
  
Well... Okay, I found this... it's interesting or at least quite curious... and now? ... What do I do? ... Who do I talk to now, if possible without coming off as crazy?  
  
I’ll spare you my tribulations, but fortunately, SIGMA2 in France offered me the chance to present my work, which I was more than delighted and relieved about. The presentation went wonderfully; very competent and qualified people made constructive observations and critiques with varying degrees of reservations about the conclusions. Everyone agreed that the approach had a certain interest, and my caution was particularly appreciated.  
  
The commission took good notes on my work but raised a significant problem that I had not anticipated: No radar recording = no investigation; it’s as simple as that, and it’s perfectly understandable. The catch is that the SCU is trying to obtain these recordings without success so far.  
  
Since then, what has become of my work?  
  
Well... to be honest... not much 😅...

I continued to study the previous results and made some additional advances (much more delicate to explain). Nevertheless, in terms of communication, it’s a void... Unfortunately, I have not managed to make them known much more. Yet, I regularly see journalists and others discussing this case, making all sorts of hypotheses but never mentioning this relationship... thinking about it, I feel like I’m living a 2.0 version of the Cassandra myth. And now, I dread seeing it gradually sink into oblivion when it seems to me to be an essential piece of the puzzle.  
  
There you go; now you know everything there is to know in broad strokes. At least if you had the courage (or the madness) to read this scandalously long post! 😅  
  
I look forward to reading your feedback. Thank you.  
  
As promised, the demonstrations, reasoning, and calculations are all available below:  
  
Let’s start by schematizing our Tic Tac:

https://preview.redd.it/w5ql0aqw040e1.png?width=945&format=png&auto=webp&s=7be1529635b9951764d7a4d4a3581df31680f036

The first step is to establish the formulas for the surfaces and volumes of each ""spherical"" or curved ""part."" It quickly becomes clear that 2 parameters (x: height-to-width ratio and R: radius) are sufficient to define the shape.

https://preview.redd.it/5d3c5zhz040e1.png?width=692&format=png&auto=webp&s=cfb88d5d569cc20a4d084a6f20ac3a60f879b1d1

The second consists of comparing them in a first table (with x and R undetermined). Nothing conclusive appears for the moment.

https://preview.redd.it/m4xki121140e1.png?width=945&format=png&auto=webp&s=66d527425a2bf7166aa677327ef9b14436e19ce7

If we refer to the video, we can see that x is around 0,4.

https://preview.redd.it/1epod9lk140e1.png?width=945&format=png&auto=webp&s=f03b2a1995f15fcdde48b818e563c531701e8982

Let's take our previous table again with x = 0,4 ; this time, everything changes :

https://preview.redd.it/38kns8jm140e1.png?width=945&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b866e2aae8f7028a2faffc156a11a6babb41e2b

For the sake of verification, let’s revisit the problem as a hypothetical designer would have approached it. That is to say, starting from a constraint formulated in an equation to arrive at the most advantageous solution for x:

https://preview.redd.it/gem2pt7p140e1.png?width=945&format=png&auto=webp&s=f48727fcd4687c625ee9cfb57045fbb687a8aad9

The hypothesis of an optimization is greatly supported, but can it still be a coincidence?

Let us now express compactness:

**In retrospect, I have a reservation about the use of compactness (C=1); it indeed allows for an estimation of R that aligns with the pilots' observations, but at the cost of 'heavy' implications that I will not elaborate on here.**

https://preview.redd.it/pn2ttd8v140e1.png?width=869&format=png&auto=webp&s=698d22a38d7721680a44891d18e4359dc7759a8d

https://preview.redd.it/vut6t22x140e1.png?width=627&format=png&auto=webp&s=d03d76884b6e9b3a8571281b0710a64f3ac99ffb

https://preview.redd.it/ywbzx39y140e1.png?width=945&format=png&auto=webp&s=1cbff6114a9785bedeb733eb0a12603f1b3ad57f

We can now complete our diagram with the optimal solutions:

https://preview.redd.it/a8xniw60240e1.png?width=945&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ef32e94cdeb4095886be4d7a0bca280f73a5d03

We arrive at a 'predictive' length of approximatelyb 11,5m. As a reminder, the witness pilots estimated the length of the TIC TAC to be about 12m (40 ft).

Our little trick thus leads us to an optimal solution that is extremely close to the witnesses' estimates, which supports a 'wise' design. The highlighted relationship has undoubtedly served as the basis for this design.

The following diagram summarizes the pathways:

https://preview.redd.it/tfv9nh21240e1.png?width=945&format=png&auto=webp&s=b066e4452bd06bc28fd16b9e5f39aea32c24a37a

The story doesn't stop there, but the continuation becomes much more mathematical. However, this post is probably already far too long! But at least I now feel the relief and satisfaction of having shared and given these calculations a chance to live their own life.

Hi everyone! Thanks so much for your support over the last year. What a road this has been. I’m very thankful for the posts I see and how encouraging you all are to me and each other. 

I’m only 8lbs from my goal weight, hitting more stalls but feeling fantastic. 

Attached a third pic which has been a wild NSV. Flying basic economy used to be such a massive pain, but as you can see(!) not so bad anymore!! 

My biggest ongoing side effect has been dehydration fainting/seeing black spells when I stand up too quickly. But Liquid IV or the like has greatly reduced that. 

I’m doing maintenance at the gym (2-3 work outs per week, once with my trainer) because I don’t really want to “get swoll” - I feel like I have a great level of fitness (I play soccer again!) and I’m just having fun.

Still eating 5-7oz (7oz makes me feel very full) per meal, and average of 4-5 meals per day. Always prioritizing proteins, adhering to the 30-30 rule, and maxing out at (against recommendations) 20oz coffee a day. 

Keep on keeping on, fam! Stay the course, and remember to take pics because the body dysmorphia is real - and comes and goes!

My boss made good impression on me since the job interview, because besides being a good looking person he has a very nice, and charming personality. With time we found out that we have the same interests, reading the same books, magazines and even listing the same podcasts. Automatically, it leads to many conversations as we are both quite clever. I do really enjoy working with him, and he too, as he told me that one day. 



However, some attitudes of him started to concern me. First and foremost, after few months of working I have already received pretty heavy tasks, which requiring a lot of responsibilities. Moreover, my boss is happy with whatever I am doing, and compliment me one on one or in front of the team that sometimes I am feeling a little bit ashamed/uncomfortable. Of course, he is married! 



Very often, when we talk about work-related issues, he ends by asking about our common interests - whether I've already received a subscription to our favourite magazine in the post, or whether I've already started watching the games of our favourite team. In the past, when he came to work with the dog, he invited me several times to his room (when he was alone) to come and play with the dog or to get a coffee if I wanted to. These kinds of suggestions are not made in front of other members of the team. Recently, when we were on our way back together and with another colleague from a business trip, for example, he asked me what system I had for marking quotes in a book.

Related, trying to think of an activity for today, Sunday, November 10th for them.  Not Granville, not a museum, not a lot of walking in the rain.  We can take Uber or public transportation.
THANK YOU for any ideas!

It has been the worst experience and has destroyed my mental health. I am doing better, but the election triggered alot of feelings I wasn't expecting to come up and my husband and I decided we would be staying at our home and visiting my in laws. My dad texted me shaming me for the decision and I am fed up. I sent this letter to them yesterday.... I'm VLC with my dad and LC with my mom. 

This all may backfire but who fucking knows. Any words of support are very appreciated 

(I hope it's clear that this isn't about political disagreements, instead it's their inability to let anyone have an opinion about anything that isn't in alignment of their own thinking and their dismissal of my feelings that are a result of things currently very prominent In My life)

For context, one of my sisters thinks that all people who didn't vote for DJT were bots or influenced by vaccine mind control. She didn't come to my wedding because she didn't want ""liberals"" there... so I said OK no hard feelings you don't have to come.

""Hi mom & dad, 
This email is to inform you that I will not likely be attending any holiday this year and to explain why I have chosen to distance myself from this family in the last 2 years. I am still considering coming for the Thanksgiving meal, but after years of being quiet, I just wanted to lay out all of my frustrations. I do love you both and spend a lot of time trying to figure out how to navigate communications with you all, I'm not sure if this is the best way to do it, but here is to trying. 

Mom, Instead of recognizing how I may feel hurt and lost by a rapist being elected as president, I am told both candidates suck. Do they? Eh, maybe. You are allowed to have that opinion. I am still allowed to feel angry that this country and you all voted for a rapist after I have spent the last 18 months speaking up about my abuse and trying to have my community and state believe women when a man is held liable for sexual assault. I am allowed to have my feelings and I am allowed to take measures to protect myself during the holidays after the worst 2 years of my life. Below is a Facebook Post that I made regarding my feelings about this. I do not want to hear a single word about you not liking how Harris stepped into politics. Harris being a mistress is unethical but Donald Trump abusing 26+ women and fucking a porn star while his wife is pregnant is okay? Make that make sense. That’s just blatant misogyny in my eyes. My emotional response isn’t about Harris losing, it is about WHY and how Trump won and the message that sends about men I have chosen to spend my life speaking out against. 


Mom, Back in August, when I tried to emotionally open up about my friend being arrested and his wife miscarrying and staying with us, you went on and on about suitcases and your trips with no empathy or concern about the stress I was going through. 

You both make my choice to spend time with my in-laws about finances and just don’t seem to understand that my in-laws allow me to show up and be who I am, unapologetically. Many of my in laws are very split politically but we respect each other mutually to shut the fuck up and not talk about it. It’s not one side calling the others idiots and expecting us to still like them. MIL & FIL are still republicans but they know what is off topic at family get togethers and they value my opinion and even ask for my perspective on things they aren't educated on or that don't affect them. They also know that it is valid that if they give their opinion, I will likely tell them mine, and they don’t scream at me or belittle me for doing so. My opinions are disagreed with, but they are valued and my in laws consistently show me that I am considered. These feelings even extend to our dog. Yes she is a pitbull. I know as insurance agents you all have a bias, but she is frankly one the kindest, gentlest dogs of our family’s dogs, yet I have been asked repeatedly by you both “well is “IT” friendly.” I feel that this family judges beings without even knowing the person or dog based on well-ingrained biases. 

Dad, all I wanted on my wedding day was for you to call me pretty. Not once could you compliment ANYTHING about me or my wedding or my amazing husband. During our father/daughter dance all you could muster up to talk about was a family member dying soon. While getting ready that morning, my bridesmaids informed me about your behavior the night before, telling my in-laws and their friends that I was a bitch and that [my sister] would be crashing my wedding. I was extremely close to not allowing you to walk me down the aisle and cutting the father/daughter dance, but I didn’t because I was trying to show you the respect I used to dream of earning from you. You told me the only thing I did right in life was not get pregnant as a teenager the week after I graduated college. When you came and saw our home, all you could do was criticize my coffee maker and tell me “It sure is modern!” about the house and wanted to leave. I have not once felt that you felt proud of me or could see me as anyone besides someone who disagreed with you. 

My whole life, you both have called liberals “dumbasses” “Crazy” “Stupid”. It was focused on the news, not me, but I am liberal. I am a democrat. I am far, far left from Biden and Harris on many issues. I am far enough left that you get your guns and vaccine decisions back! If you think that I am an idiot, that’s okay, but I don’t have to surround myself with people who think I am an idiot while simultaneously uninterested in hearing my opinion. I think when I was 16 or so, I commented that Obama wasn’t the worst president we’ve had. [My sister] called me an Obama lover and dad called me a communist. I assure you I am not. 

Not once have I felt my opinions or views were respected, so why should I care about yours? Or do only your opinions matter and mine don't? If we want to play this game, I will match your energy and call you stupid and crazy too. But it is disrespectful when I do it. Rules for me, not for thee, I guess. If you want to call me an idiot that is fine, but you both raised me to not put up with that behavior from a man, and I won't let my dad speak to me that way and I will never let any child I may have to be spoken to in that way. 

Mom, you have consistently defended dad’s behavior. Just because you don't hear or see something, doesn’t mean dad or anyone hasn't done or said it. And telling me “well I didn't see that” when I open to you feels like an attempt to get me to let stuff go. Okay fine. Then I won't tell you anything. I have had far too many people invalidate me and tell me to shut up to tolerate the same behavior from my family. 

You have both spoken to my husband and to my expartner about how difficult I am. Am I the easiest person to be married to? No, but that's because I am not a people pleaser. Frustratingly enough, I don’t think I have let a single thing go in my life. I truly wish I could. I would think a parent would love that I have found a husband who loves me for me - stubbornness and all. My husband and one of my best friends told me that I need to stop apologizing for who I am because “I am not difficult to love.” I know joking with partners of mine is probably intended as a joke, but sometimes I have to question if you don’t truly feel that way. 

I have no idea on how to move forward, but I also do not care for an apology. I know you both keep telling people you miss me and want me around more, but why do you miss me? Any time I come home it seems that if I don't just shut up and be a shell of myself that I am the problem. I happen to really like the person I have become from the work I have done in speaking up for myself and I just don't have it in me this year to be home for the Holidays if I have to be silent while being surrounded by people who are allowed to speak their minds. [my other sister] tries to people please to fix this family and that's just not going to work for me.

There needs to be mutual respect and I have not once felt my existence to be respected by dad or [conspiracy sister] and I don't think my feelings or reality are respected by [more normal sister] or mom. I am loud. I am offensive. My life experiences have made me the person I am today and I have so many people in my life that love those parts of me. I speak up for myself and every person who is capable of human empathy. [Conspiracy sister] is allowed to be herself and that's fine, but I don't have to like her or accept that behavior.

I have so much empathy and understanding for every person in this family, but I don’t feel that empathy has been returned to me and it doesn't seem you have cared to understand me, so I do not feel I have a space in our family or a seat at our dinner table.

Yes, some of this is an emotional reaction to Trump’s election and maybe next year I will feel differently. But as I said, these last 2 years have been incredibly difficult and all I want is to be home with my husband who respects my opinions, my body, and my feelings. I am NOT saying you have said this, but many conservatives have spewed “fuck your feelings” but I was always taught to respect others’ feelings and our feelings are our reality. 

Again, I am not trying to make anyone feel bad and nothing I am saying is out of spite. I would be interested in working on our family relationships but I just have been shown time and time again that my feelings and opinions do not matter so I'm not sure how to keep trying.

Love,

1go6914,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1go6914/does_my_boss_have_crush_on_me/,Does my boss have crush on me? ,"I have just stared my dream job in amazing team. My boss made good impression on me since the job interview, because besides being a good looking person he has a very nice, and charming personality. With time we found out that we have the same interests, reading the same books, magazines and even listing the same podcasts. Automatically, it leads to many conversations as we are both quite clever. I do really enjoy working with him, and he too, as he told me that one day. 



However, some attitudes of him started to concern me. First and foremost, after few months of working I have already received pretty heavy tasks, which requiring a lot of responsibilities. Moreover, my boss is happy with whatever I am doing, and compliment me one on one or in front of the team that sometimes I am feeling a little bit ashamed/uncomfortable. Of course, he is married! 



Very often, when we talk about work-related issues, he ends by asking about our common interests - whether I've already received a subscription to our favourite magazine in the post, or whether I've already started watching the games of our favourite team. In the past, when he came to work with the dog, he invited me several times to his room (when he was alone) to come and play with the dog or to get a coffee if I wanted to. These kinds of suggestions are not made in front of other members of the team. Recently, when we were on our way back together and with another colleague from a business trip, for example, he asked me what system I had for marking quotes in a book. 



I like this type of relationship, but I'm afraid people might start gossiping. I'm good at what I do and I'm glad I've been given more assignments in a short space of time, but I'm afraid that as a young woman I might be wrongly labelled later.  ",0,1731260759.0,dating_advice,1,0.5,False

I’m loving it so far, although I scoop quite a lot of foam out of my coffee daily. I know… I know …. Everyone loves the foam (crema) it seems a bit overpowering to me because it’s the same amount of coffee to foam or sometimes more foam if it’s an espresso size pod. I enjoy adding a bit of warmed frothed almond milk maybe some sugar or flavored creamer and a little cinnamon on top.  What are your favorite pods that are full size cups so i don’t have to keep using two pods? So far I really enjoy the half caff version and the Puerto Rican pod (I’m biased) the dulce one is good.

Now, my question is, since I will be doing IF and not eating during this time frame, will drinking black coffee mess up my medicine’s effectiveness? Does anyone have experience with this? Thanks!

**Biked:** 2 miles

**SM:** 10 floors

**Sunday, 3 Nov. 2024 -** cup of coffee @ 8:45am, went to gym for 1 mile walk on treadmill, 1 mile on the stationary bike, and up 5 flights of stairs on the stair master. Went on 30 minute walk @ local park in the evening. Meal prepped for Monday.

**Monday, 4 Nov. 2024 -** First day of oatmeal for breakfast. Using a protein mix gave it a flavor at least. I fell off-the-wall and ate without logging. Oops! Meal prepped for next day, ensuring I will be withing my CICO range. Added chia seeds to oatmeal for texture and reduced the water to 2/3 cup water as the amount I put in the night before (Sunday) was a little too much for my liking.

**Tuesday, 5 Nov. 2024 -** Woke up @ 4am, went to gym by 5am. Felt very productive before and during a large part of work. Adding a scoop (30g) of Quest^(®) Cinnamon Crunch to my oatmeal was actually really good. Meal-prepped for the next day. I was in bed by 5pm, asleep by 6pm as I was TIRED. (And stressed as it's Election Day...)

**Wednesday, 6 Nov. 2024 -** I had missed my morning egg and sausage sandwiches, which the 2-egg-one-sausage muffin I had created the night before was so good. Defiantly didn't pace myself eating during my window on food I've already logged like I should have. I slipped and had a cupcake, but still logged it. Hunger pangs persisted while @ game-night. I figure it may be a slight ""trigger"" for my brain as we do sometimes snack as we play. The only distraction I could give myself post-game was to take a short drive around to clear my head some and grocery shop for my meal-prep. I do note having a particular craving for banana and peanut butter. So I picked up some PB2 powder to add to my oatmeal\* for the following day.

**Thursday, 7 Nov. 2024 -** Adding the PB2 powder to my oatmeal this morning was the equivalent of eating chunky peanut butter - but the chunks aren't as firm / large and the quantity of chunk-to-peanut-butter is 99.9 to 0.1 ... if that make sense? Still something to spice the oatmeal up, I suppose. No dance, as I went deep into prepping five bags of cabbage / kale / carrot salad, dough for bean burgers, and pre- cut / measured for my stir-fry. Double checking I am measuring and recording every measurement. Kept up my fast the entire day, after my eating window had ended at 10:40am! I did end up going to the gym for a short while for some sort of distraction. But a little bit into it, I was not feeling not so into it... a little dizzy, tiredness / exhaustion, and light-feeling.

**Friday, 8 Nov. 2024 -** Fasting went well. I had broken my fast at 7:04am. I have been feeling a little light headed... and a little light headed feeling all around my body as well. I am slightly concerned. The purple cabbage / kale / carrot salad was okay, other than a bit of a throat scratch from the kale. But I do feel full and I have a bite and a half left of lunch before. Finally had to cooking my turkey stir-fry, purple cabbage salad, and egg muffins with the kitchen to myself.

**Saturday, 9 Nov. 2024** \- Finally got to run to the store after an almost-emergency. Strawberries, mangos, carrots, spinach, red cabbage, chicken breast, guacamole sauce, and a cereal-flavored whey protein shake. Did not hold myself to a strict fasting plan this day. Because I have prepared all of my food, I can break things up into identifiable breakfast, lunch, and dinner all while spreading them out through my day. Mixing my failed bean patties in with my butternut-corn soup (8 ounces of frozen each, blended in water & frozen until use). My turkey stir-fry held up and was pretty nice. I do think the layering of items and not mixing them up may have made a difference. So I must keep out an eye.",1,1731260398.0,u_PristineTurn5335,0,1.0,False

It will be my husband and I (57, 64) and our kids (26, 23). I have a recent knee injury, so lots of walking, hiking probably won't be possible for me, but the kids could always leave me behind and do something more adventurous.

I do these things almost all the time in bd but no one ever thanked me?   
Next, when i was in UK at first i thought that i will face racism, spoiler alert i didn't. Instead in a  cafe named The breakfast club, the waitress asked me where i was from and then she gave me a free coffee, with even suggestions on what to do. I was flabbergasted.   
The only bad thing i encountered happened when i was about 13-14 in Singapore, once i fall off a skooter because i was trying to go as fast as possible over a some small speed bumpers. And when i fall instead of people coming to help me there was a guy in a bus stop laughing at me, the injury wasn't good either, a big chunk of my skin under my lips was torn still he was laughing.

I could not find docs or threads that helped me to figure it out, so posting here. if this has been discussed before, happy to close to avoid duplicates. Mostly found thread with issues the other way around, from local to cloud

I have device A (desktop pc) which has the original files that I want to edit, I start curling and editing and want to continue from the coffee shop, so I upload my progress to the cloud. I take device b (laptop or android phone), I can see where I left off, and continue working, the cloud has the latest edits from a and b, but when getting home, I want to sync the edits to my hard drive on device a, so that it also has the progress I made on device b. how can I achieve that?

I see this on the docs
-----
What does the Copy to Cloud option mean in Lightroom?
With the Local tab, you can access locally stored photos from your computer without importing them to Lightroom. This makes it easier to edit photos as you don't need to import every image to Lightroom before editing it. You can selectively copy pictures to the Cloud to access them on Lightroom for mobile and Lightroom on the Web. 

When you copy a photo to the Cloud, the Cloud, and Local copies are separate. You can continue to edit the image in the Cloud section. If you edit the Local copy again, you can update the Cloud copy with the new edits from the Local section.
​-----

And have done that(continue editing local on device A and sync the changes later to the cloud), but then again, if I edit on the cloud on device b, I have not found a way to sync back to local. And I do read that it mentions Cloud and Local copies are separate, I am not looking for autosync, just a way to start a sync from the cloud back to local.

Also second inquiry (happy to open another thread if that is more adequate), 
I am out on the field, I have my camera, my phone and a sd card reader. I want to start curling on the phone, without uploading to the cloud, is that possible? I am able to import my images from the sd card to lightroom in the phone, but it start to upload them. Does not seem I can only explore and flag/rate them. 
 
I guess this kind of ties back to the original question, I would not have an issue of them uploading from the phone, if once I am back at home, and move the files from my sdcard to my pc, I could sync the flags and edits made on the phone, and not having to re upload/end up with duplicates. is that workflow possible?

 I see the archive from cloud option, but that seems more meant to be used as for offloading cloud content to local that is not going to be kept in cloud going forward. am I misunderstanding that option, and that is what I am looking for?

I am new to photography (about a year in), and just started retouching my images on lightroom about a couple months ago.

I’m having a Disco Rodeo Austin reception in December, and instead of an open bar, we’re offering three cocktails + a few highballs with selected liquors. Since it’s in December, we’re going for a seasonal vibe with a Texas twist. So far, we have a Maple Old Fashioned and a Cowboy Coffee (think Irish coffee, but with American whiskey). But we’re stuck on the third cocktail!

I wanted to do a cranberry-pomegranate margarita for a light, ‘disco’ vibe that isn’t too summery and still true to Austin. As a former bartender, I’ve tried a few recipes and experimented, but I just can’t get it to taste right! Has anyone nailed a cranberry/pomegranate margarita recipe or have other ideas for a fun, light liquor cocktail that would fit our theme? I’m open to suggestions!

* Your body runs on something called ATP (adenosine triphosphate)
* Tiny cellular structures called mitochondria make this ATP
* Your brain, while only 2% of your body weight, uses 20% of your energy
* Yes, your breakfast literally powers your thoughts

**Foundation Mode (Start Here)**

*Nutrition:*

* Think of complex carbs as slow-burning logs
* Simple sugars are like newspaper - quick flame, quick burnout
* Water is literally your body's coolant - even slight dehydration makes your brain feel like it's running Windows 95

*Movement:*

* Plot twist: Exercise creates energy
* Your mitochondria are like Apple - they release upgrades when challenged
* Consistency > Intensity (walking daily beats monthly gym guilt)

*Sleep Optimization:*

* Your brain runs its defrag program during sleep
* Morning sunlight = biological coffee
* Evening darkness = your body's shutdown sequence

**Advanced Techniques (The Deep Tech)** 

*Mitochondrial Hacks:*

* Near-infrared saunas (like a spa day for your cells)
* Specific nootropics (premium fuel for your cellular engines)
* Intermittent fasting (spring cleaning for your cells)

*Cold Exposure:*

* Triggers catecholamine release (nature's energy drink)
* Can boost metabolism by up to 300% (not a typo)
* Yes, this means cold showers actually work

# Track Your Power Levels 

* Get blood work (find your body's bottlenecks)
* Consider Oura ring (like having a tiny scientist on your finger)
* Listen to your body (it's been optimizing energy longer than we've had smartphones)

1go5xv9,https://www.reddit.com/r/FattyLiverNAFLD/comments/1go5xv9/words_of_encouragement_for_those_in_need_my_lfts/,Words of encouragement for those in need; My LFTs are close to normal in 1.5 months Long post ahead,"For context, I 27M am a doctor. I had really irregular lifestyle while living in hostel. My lifestyle was pretty much sedentary with very bad eating habit. I ignored my health far enough to see NAFLD grade 2 few days back, living the life of a hypocrite. 

I didn't notice overt symptoms like most people at first.  Because whatever symptoms I noticed like chronic fatigue, sluggish attitude, mood changes, altered bowel habits I blamed them on my study and work pressure. I never accounted fatty liver in this scene. I (175cm) was overweight at 93.4kg. Always have been overweight. So yes, there was a massive chance of nafld for me. Most of the general population have silent fatty liver. It's common due to modern lifestyle. But most are contained upto grade 1 and such. 

Anyway as part of a job offer, the company prompted me through a variety of pre-employment medical checks that I haven't done for myself for years since covid. 
That's when I got to know I had elevated ALT, AST and cholesterol too. 

Since they didn't quote me the exact numbers of my own tests citing some bs privacy policy, I rechecked again from a local lab. My alt was 193 and ast was 120 u/L with every other parameters in range. I didn't check my lipids then. 

Following that I promptly got an usg done from the same lab and got to know I had grade 2 NAFLD. The doc suggested me fibroscan. But I wasn't at my hospital where I can get it done for free. I being a lazy ass, didn't get it checked outside too. It was concerning to me, though I didn't freak out that much. Cause I have seen such cases in before and knew that proper diet and exercise can heal liver pretty fast. So my only way out was proper diet with moderate aerobic exercise.

It was 1.5 months ago. And I have completely changed my diet since along with at least 30 mins of cardio for 5 days a week. I am at 88 kg now, lost 5.4 kg. Still a long way to go. 

I checked LFT, Lipids again today. Now ALT- 60, AST-38 U/L, lipids are borderline high. What more concerning was I decided to check my TSH and it came back high like 8.6 uIU/L. I am suspecting subclinical hypothyroidism. I am yet to check ft3 and ft4. Maybe that's the root cause of all these evil. I'll update once I do it again in a month. Anyway coming to my point...

What my diet was- heaps and heaps of white rice, refined flour or maida, packaged fruit juices, sugary drinks, sweets. You get the point. Type of foods with high saturated fats and carbs that I advise patients not to eat. Yet I was doing it all myself. 

What it is now- my food was deficient in protein. So I added more protein decreasing dependency on carb and fat. I have been following intermittent fasting 16/8 having 2 meals a day with only black coffee in the morning. For protein- lean meat like chicken, lots of fish, egg whites, curd, skimmed milk, chickpea, legumes, soya chunks, paneer or cottage cheese and whey. Variety of combination everyday to eat at least 90g of protein. Protein is 
                  
  For carb- brown rice, oats, gram flour, chickpea flour, wheat flour or atta as we call it. In limited quantity. I cut down all processed foods like pasta, noodles, white bread. Even somedays I just ate soya chunks and it's excellent source of protein with decent carb.
                
   Dietary fibre- extremely important for a high protein diet. Otherwise you would end up with constipation most days. I started taking psyllium husk few days back as I was not reaching my dietary fibre goal. I solved my constipation problem. Psyllium husk reduces your appetite with added benefit of lower your cholesterol. Don't overdose or you will be farting through the roof. 
And also don't take immediately with meals as it can reduce absorption of nutrients. I take 2 teaspoons 40-45 mins before each meal. 

Now sugar- completely cut off. I try to avoid added sugar as much as possible. Read labels with serving size. If you see added sugar in excessive amount, runaway. Some spice mix or dressing can have added sugar. Calculate the amount you're using and sugar in it. I try to keep it lower than 1g a day. You don't want to get 4 to 5 tbsp worth of sugar everyday from processed foods. So avoid as much as possible. 

Fat- go nuts. Really, a handful of mixed nuts everday with any oil rich in pufa and mufa, like olive, sunflower, mustard etc. Chia and flax seeds for added pufas and fibres. 

For exercise- I am a lazy ass. Still I try to spend 40 mins on assualt bike or just walking. Intense sessions on assault bike can drain you a lot. That's why eating protein is important. It helps to minimize muscle loss during weight loss. Try to have a calorie deficit of 400-700kcal everday. I aimed for 800g -1kg / week of weight loss. Weight loss at 1% of your weight/week is recommended. 

And for recovery from nafld, even 5% weight loss can make a big difference. I'll get another usg done in 2 months. Thanks for reaching this far.",1,1731259956.0,FattyLiverNAFLD,0,1.0,False

Couldn’t fathom having additional caffeine which is great bc it felt like for a long time coffee just stopped working. Now it WORKS lol. Did anyone else experience this? Lots of talk about increase in nausea etc when I searched the thread. 

Second question: I know i still need to eat but food is literally making me gag. What do y’all do in the mornings to make sure you get something in you?

I am struggling to dial in my first espresso shot with my brand new coffee machine.

I have a Lelit Mara X as well as an Eureka Mignob Spezialita.

The coffee in question is a medium light roast blend that I love from my favourite coffee shop.

At the shop they have told me that they use the following settings: 6,5 brew pressure, 18,2g; 27 seconds at 92 degrees C for about 36g of coffee


I have adjusted my OPV valve on the Mara that around 2,6 grind setting i get about 6,5 - 7 bara of pressure. I am using the 92 degree setting (setting 1). I am running into the problem that the coffee is still astringent; bit both sour and bitter.

Flow is also a bit too fast; i get to 36 grams around 20 seconds.

However; when i adjust my grind setting to 2.2 or anything below my pressure shoots up to 8, ruining the coffee completely making it extremely acidic.

So instead i went up on the grams to 18,5 for slower extraction and that got me closer - 24s; however the taste is still wrong.

Please send help my head hurts. (Also tasted at least 12-14 coffees)",2,1731259707.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

This guide is all about enjoying a tasty, filling breakfast while saving money on it. I'll share some tips you can easily follow to make breakfast at home for less, using basic ingredients and a few easy tricks. By the end, you’ll know how to avoid the high costs of breakfast foods, especially when it's so easy to make these meals yourself. Let’s get started!

# 1. Boil Eggs at Home

Eggs are one of the most affordable and nutritious breakfast options, but buying pre-boiled eggs can be surprisingly expensive. Save yourself a few bucks by boiling them at home! It’s as easy as popping them into a pot of boiling water for a few minutes. Buying eggs by the dozen instead of individually will also help stretch your budget. I like to make a few extras at the start of the week and keep them in the fridge—they’re great for quick breakfasts or snacks!

# 2. Stock Up on Breakfast Essentials

Skip the pricey frozen meals and stock up on ingredients to make quick breakfasts yourself. With just a few ingredients, you can easily make waffles, burritos, parfaits, or sandwiches at home. Pre-packaged meals may seem convenient, but they come at a premium price. Prepping even a couple of items in advance, like sandwich fillings or waffle batter, will save both time and money in the long run.

# 3. Blend Your Own Smoothies

Smoothies can be super pricey when you buy them at a shop, but making them at home is much cheaper—and often healthier! Keep some frozen or fresh fruits and vegetables in the fridge, and you’re set. Blend up a smoothie with fruits, greens, and maybe a spoonful of yogurt. Not only will you save money, but you can customize your smoothie however you like.

# 4. Brew Coffee at Home

That morning coffee run may seem innocent, but it can add up over time. Brewing coffee at home is an easy way to save a few dollars each day. You can even invest in a simple coffee maker, which will pay for itself after a few weeks of skipping the café.

# 5. Bring Your Own Coffee Mug

If you’re still craving that coffee shop experience, bring your own mug! Some places give you a small discount when you bring a reusable cup. While the savings might feel minor, they really add up if you’re a regular coffee drinker. And hey, it’s an eco-friendly choice too!

# 6. Make Fresh Fruit Your Go-To Breakfast

Sometimes, a simple breakfast is best. Eating fresh fruit is a quick, healthy, and affordable breakfast option. Stock your fridge with fruits you enjoy, like apples, bananas, or berries, and grab them on the go. Fruits are also easy to pair with a handful of nuts or a dollop of yogurt for a bit more protein.

# 7. Prepare Your Own Granola

Granola is often way more expensive than it needs to be, especially if you buy it pre-made. But the good news is that it’s super simple to make yourself! Find an easy recipe online, mix up oats, nuts, and a bit of honey, and bake it on the weekend. You’ll have a whole batch of granola ready to go for the week—and it’ll taste even better because you made it yourself.

# 8. Buy Yogurt in Bulk

Yogurt is a breakfast staple, but those single-serving containers can be a money trap. Instead, buy a larger container of plain yogurt and portion it out yourself. You can add fruits, honey, or even a spoonful of that homemade granola for a delicious, budget-friendly breakfast. Plus, buying in bulk cuts down on waste from all those plastic containers.

# 9. Get Creative with Leftovers

This might sound unconventional, but leftovers make for amazing breakfasts! If you have any veggies or proteins left from last night’s dinner, toss them into scrambled eggs for a quick and hearty breakfast. Not only does this save food from going to waste, but it also means you’re getting a full meal with minimal effort.

# 10. Keep an Eye on Store Discounts

Sometimes, the best way to save money is to plan your breakfasts based on what’s on sale. Check for discounts on bulk breakfast ingredients like oats, eggs, and fruit. Many stores offer deals on larger quantities, which can be perfect for stocking up without breaking the bank.",1,1731259670.0,EconomyKitchen,0,1.0,False

1go5p9d,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1go5p9d/aita_for_asking_my_sister_to_replace_my/,AITA for asking my sister to replace my jellybeans after her son ate them?,"
So, I (25M) recently invited my family over for dinner at my new condo. I’m really proud of this place—it took years of saving, hard work, and sacrifice to get here. It’s small, but it’s mine, and I wanted to celebrate with a nice family dinner.

I decided to make homemade spaghetti carbonara. I spent hours on it: crisped pancetta, freshly grated Parmesan, whisked with eggs and pasta water for a perfect, silky sauce. Carbonara is all about timing and texture, so I was in the kitchen paying close attention to every step. I added garlic bread, salad, and even made a cheesecake for dessert. It was a big effort, and I wanted the evening to feel special.

Now, I keep a big jar of jellybeans on my coffee table as a treat. I love picking out a few here and there, and I always save the Cream Soda ones for last—they’re my favorite. The jar has lasted a long time, and it’s something I enjoy after a long day.

My sister Laura (35F) brought her 7-year-old son, who’s honestly a bit of a handful. He’s not used to hearing “no” and thinks every space is his to do what he wants. My sister has never set limits with him, and growing up, our parents spoiled her too.

While I was busy in the kitchen, my nephew found the jellybean jar. I didn’t notice at first because I was trying to get the carbonara just right. After dinner, I went to grab a handful of jellybeans and realized that almost all the Cream Soda ones were gone. My nephew had picked them out, leaving a mess of crumbs and broken bits.

I pulled Laura aside and mentioned it, asking if she’d noticed. She just shrugged and said, “Oh, he only likes the Cream Soda ones, so he picked those out. No big deal.” I tried to be polite, but I told her that those were my favorites and asked if she could replace them, or at least get me some more of the Cream Soda flavor.

She got annoyed and snapped, “He’s just a kid. You’re seriously this worked up over some jellybeans?” I told her it wasn’t about the jellybeans, but that it would’ve been nice if she’d kept an eye on him or taught him to ask. Laura rolled her eyes and said, “Then don’t leave temptations out if you don’t want kids touching them.”

I asked her one more time to either replace the jar or just the Cream Soda ones, but she refused, calling me “petty” and saying I was blowing things out of proportion. My parents jumped in to back her up, telling me to “drop it” and that I should “know better than to have temptations out around kids.”

But it’s not just about the money—it’s about respect and boundaries. I put a lot into that dinner, and her response was to let her son treat my place like his personal candy store. Now my family thinks I’m overreacting, but to me, this is about respecting boundaries.

1go5oe2,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1go5oe2/time_looped_chapter_26/,Time Looped (Chapter 26),"Admitting that eternity was a game had benefits and drawbacks. Games usually had a set of strict unchangeable rules: only certain people who had joined eternity could get classes, each mirror only gave out a class once, there was no changing the key holder. That was enough to come up with a bunch of ideas or even a plan. The drawback was that the person most familiar with games in general was the most unreliable of the bunch.

“For real, bros,” the goofball said, chugging down cocoas as if they were water. “I’m the goat! Been playing games way before eternity.”

That didn’t sound in the least reassuring. Everyone instantly imagined the guy wasting hundreds of loops on mobile games and nothing else. For all they knew, he had done just that while working with Daniel.

“I got it covered,” Will said.

“I’m with Stoner,” Jace agreed. Against most expectations, he kept a surprisingly healthy diet, which had resulted in him ordering a glass of water and an apple. “His idea makes sense.”

“For real?” Alex slumped backwards in his seat. “I can improve it, though.”

“Alex!” Helen hissed. “What’s the plan?” She turned to Will.

“You don’t get your class,” Will explained. “The goblins won’t pop out until their mirrors see you. That’s why you don’t. Alex does.”

“I’m not trusting him with the knight.” The girl crossed her arms.

“I’ve been the knight hundreds of times,” the goofball grumbled.

“The *point*—” Will raised his tone slightly “—is for Alex to set up his traps in the room *before* you go in. Then you take your class, kill them off, and we see what we do from there.”

There was a long moment of silence, only interrupted by the barista passing by to refill Alex’s mug. As far as he was concerned, they were discussing the strategy of some mobile game. And even if he found anything suspicious, he’d forget about it in about five minutes.

“Good plan,” Jace said, his words soaked with doubt. “We can join in to help. A team is always stronger than a group of individuals.” He gave Will a glance. “Until they run off.”

“The three of you in the girl’s bathroom?” Helen asked mockingly.

“Won’t be the first time.”

“Bro,” Alex laughed. “That sounded so wrong. But nah. Key holder gets to keep the loop. She must do the kills. Maybe we’ll get something useful.”

Everyone nodded.

“The important thing is that we time and learn this,” Will said. “It’ll be our starting point from here on. Alex goes in, then out. Helen gets the knight, kills off all the goblins, then we meet up in class. And Jace learns what he needs to do to extend his loop.”

“Lame,” Alex said, grabbing the new cup of cocoa that arrived at his table.

“We’ll know more when we know more.” Will said and took a sip of his soft drink. It tasted of sweetened strawberries—definitely not something he’d try again in any future loop.

“So… we do this every loop?” Jace asked, only now realizing the situation.

“Seriously?” Helen gave him her typical glare. “What do you think this is?

“Hey!” Despite being the loop newbie, the jock had no intention of taking any shit. “What about shifting the classes a bit? During training, coach had us take on different roles so we got an idea how everything worked.”

That, to everyone’s surprise, was a remarkably good idea. Will even hated himself for not coming up with it first, despite thinking the exact same a hundred loops ago. With everyone knowing the pluses and minuses of their class alone, their way of thinking had become restricted. Switching up things would let everyone get a different perspective, not to mention that it would be fun.

“Let’s get the timing on this first, okay? Then we’ll try variants.”

It sounded simple enough. With everyone else doing the same things in the same fashion, it had to be. Will pushed his drink away. There were a few more minutes until the end of the loop. Part of him considered whether to have a mousse. It had been a while since he’d tasted one. Better not. There would be a chance to do so in another few dozen loops or so.

“Not that it’s my business, but aren’t you supposed to be at school?” the barista asked.

“Teacher’s sick,” Alex said without batting an eye. “Diarrhea.”

If there was a topic that was certain to end all conversation, it was discussing diarrhea in a coffee shop. Even with no people around, the barista instinctively pulled back, out of fear that he might get affected by the word itself.

“Way to go, idiot,” Helen whispered beneath her breath.

“Always works.” The goofball smiled. “Ready to go?”

Noone said another word for the next minute.

 

**Restarting eternity.**

 

Will looked at the entrance. As far as he was concerned, this was nothing but a standard loop. Unlike Alex and Helen, his only goal was to do the same thing he did every loop and not draw attention. And that meant he could spend a few moments to chill.

“Cool move, weirdo,” Jess and her friend passed by.

“Thanks,” the boy turned to the pair. “You’re cool as well.”

Both girls reacted in a completely different fashion. Jess’ friend took that as an insult and doubled her pace in an attempt to pull her friend away. Jess, in contrast, saw it as a compliment and slowed down.

“Never noticed you came so early,” he continued.

“Yeah, my father has to get early to work, so he drops me off half an hour before class starts. I usually go to pick up Ely before we come here.”

“Maybe I can meet up with you sometime as well. There’s not much—”

“Jess,” Ely hissed like a viper before an attack. “We’ll be late for class.” She grabbed hold of the girl, pulling her towards the entrance. This time, Jess followed. Despite liking the attention she’d just gotten, she didn’t want to appear easy to get.

“See you around later,” Will said just as the entrance door closed behind them.

Usually, this was the point at which Alex appeared with his talk of muffins. The fact that no such thing occurred gave Will hope that everything was going as close to plan as possible. Waiting a few more seconds just to be sure, he entered the school building.

The normal thing to do was get the rogue and go to class. In typical teenage fashion, though, Will decided to casually stroll to the girls’ bathroom between the two. To little surprise, he found that Jace was already there.

“Hey,” Will said, trying to hide his disappointment.

“Yo.” The other nodded.

Several seconds passed in silence as students walked by in the hallway.

“Heard anything?” Will asked, trying unsuccessfully not to stand out.

“Nope.” Jace shook his head.

“Think everything is alright there? I mean, there’s no harm in helping.”

Almost simultaneously, both boys looked in both directions of the corridor. There was no chance that they’d enter unseen. On the bright side, neither coach nor any of the teachers were present. The worst that could happen was them being dragged to the vice-principal’s office, and even then they’d probably not even get to hear a full lecture before the loop ended.

“Think we should go?” Will said, knowing what the other’s answer would be.

“You go first, then toss me a knife. I’ll disarm any traps you step in.”

Not the worst plan someone could come up with. It was ironic that, of all people, Jace had to be selected as the crafter. As far as Will knew, the most complicated device the jock had seen was a football.

Taking one look around, the pair was just about to storm in when the door opened in front of them.

“Knew you’d be here.” Helen passed by, not even taking the effort to glare at them. “Classroom.”

Jace and Will looked at each other.

“Was lit, bros!” Alex said, appearing out of nowhere. “Sadge you weren’t there.”

A few moments passed.

“You know,” Jace said after a while. “Sometimes I really hate him.”

“Don’t,” Will whispered, even if the goofball wasn’t in his good book at the moment, either. “You get used to it. Besides, you can’t hit him. I’ve tried.”

Class proceeded as usual. Or rather, semi as usual. Jace took the time to meet up with the rest of the football team, while Will and Alex helped Helen in opening the windows. The stench was still noticeable by the time the rest of the class started arriving.

That annoyed Will somewhat. There was no reason they couldn’t discuss what had happened in the girls’ bathroom, yet Helen had been adamant that they do it during recess. Judging by Alex’s unusual support, there had to be a reason for that, although it made matters just a bit more complicated. For one thing, while Will knew what he was supposed to do to reach that time, Jace remained completely new, so to speak. It was going to take him dozens of loops at least until he found his own path. Then again, it dawned on Will—maybe that was the point.

Arts was long and boring. None of the loopers put any effort into their work, even if it would have earned them additional loop minutes. Whatever attempts Jace made, they had clearly failed, for by the start of class, the loop had already ended for him.

Visually, nothing had changed, yet everyone else involved knew. It was as if there was an invisible barrier that divided the looped with the non-looped. Once the time had passed, the jock seemed to have lost his vibrance, becoming part of the “gray” background. What complicated matters was that he didn’t seem to realize it, at least not fully. As far as this version of him was concerned, he was the same person with the same memories, just lacking the supernatural elements. For that reason, when recess came, he joined the other three in the yard.

“So?” Will asked the question.

“The plan worked,” the girl said. “Mostly.”

“For real?” Alex sighed. “Just needs some fine tuning.”

“The goblins didn’t drop anything,” she said.

“Not even knives?” Jace asked. “Even we could get some of those last time.”

“Those disappeared once I killed them all. And it wasn’t the normal fade, either. When the last creature was gone, all of them flashed away.”

That was new, though not unexpected.

“Any levels?”

“The usual one. And a scoreboard.”

“Scoreboard?”

“What was your score?” Will asked. The lack of response quickly let him know that wasn’t the right question. “Not that it matters since you’re the only one who—”

“I was fifth,” she interrupted. “There were four people ahead of me.” There was a momentary pause. “The Archer was second.”

That was something that no one expected. Only Alex seemed to be handling it better than the rest. His philosophy that anything new in a loop was a positive development seemed to do wonders for his attitude.

“The Summoner was first, with twice as many points as everyone else combined,” Helen went on. “The Druid was third and the Martial Artist was fourth.”

“Any sixth?” Will couldn’t help himself.

“No. That’s all.”

“What’s the big deal?” Jace joined in the discussion. “So you’re not first yet. Big deal. You’re still in the top five. That’s what counts.”

“Fifth of twenty-four,” Will said. “That’s not the scary part, though. When the fight took place, only a minute had passed. That means that the four ahead of her managed to kill more goblins in that time.”

“Nah, that’s not the big oof,” Alex corrected.

“What can be worse?” The jock ran the fingers of both hands through his hair.

“Team structure, bro. Five teams—five key holders. We’re in the minor leagues.”

It didn’t take much to calculate that out of twenty people, their team was dead last. Of course, that left the remaining sixth team, suggesting there was still one group that hadn’t started the tutorial.

“Welcome to the grind,” Alex said, taking out a muffin from his pocket.

“Do I want to know?” Jace glanced at him.

“The grind is the long period of doing lots for little progress,” Will said, who was already familiar with the term. Since they had just figured out something that Daniel hadn’t, he hoped that there would be more to it, sadly it was once again back to basics. “Helen will have to go through the entire school and find the other goblin rooms. Meanwhile, the rest of us would have to extend the length of our loops.”

“Speak for yourself, bro. I can go for weeks.”

Everyone, including Helen, stared at the goofball.

“What? It’s boring with Danny gone. You’re boring too.”

“Wait. You’ve spoken to us out of loop?” Will felt a chill run down his spine.

“Chill, bro! Your secrets are safe with me.” The goofball winked. “Only sad thing is that I had to repeat every convo again and again.”

All glances shifted to Jace.

“I’m not going to remember any of this, am I?” he asked.

“We tried to warn you.” Helen shrugged. “When out of loop, better do what you usually do. Less awkward that way.”

“Right. You better catch me up next loop.” The jock pointed at each of them in turn. “If you don’t, I’ll—”

 

**STAB**

**Surprise attack.**

**Damage increased by 1000%**

**Fatal wound inflicted.**

 

Alex stabbed the jock in the neck before he could finish. Jace crumbled to the ground, without even realizing that he had been killed in the loop. Instinctively, Will and Helen leaped back.

“What?” Alex asked in the most innocent way possible. “He won’t remember. Faster this way.”

Of all the things that came to Will’s mind, “faster” was definitely not one of them. That posed an interesting question—had Alex done the same to him and Helen as well? If so, maybe the lovable goofball wasn’t as lovable as everyone gave him credit for.

I (35/F) and finishing up my divorce process with my husband. It’s unfortunate and but thankfully not messy at all.

I have a very shallow/superficial mother who almost makes me wish I was back in my dead marriage. She’s always cared and put an emphasis on “looks.” Don’t get me wrong, she’s religious but because she’s from a different time, her outdated advice is starting to mess with me. 

I was a chubby kid who lost weight as an adult due to stress. Now that I’ve ended things with my husband, I’ve put on some sad/neglected wife weight. 14 lbs exactly but for someone my height it’s noticeable. I left a marriage where I was neglected, never appreciated, never felt beautiful/loved and I moved back home only to actually hear the things wrong with me.

“Today let’s start diet. Wow I’m shocked at your appetite. You need to get it under control. Why are you eating bread?” I hear 100 different variations of these phrases everyday and she’s not wrong but the divorce process is so fresh/still going on, I just need her support right now.

I’m almost 36 so of course I’m aging. I like to think I look good for my age but she pointed out every jowl, wrinkle, etc and before I knew it, I made an appointment to get Botox for the first time. 

I’ve been on some coffee dates from the Muslim app that were hit/miss but I never ever thought it was because of my appearance. I figure it’s the age, lifestyle, religious values not aligning.

My mother is older so you can’t tell her she’s wrong as she’s so set in her ways. She also feels panic that I’m going to be single again and wants me to put my best foot/face forward but the stress of coming back home is making me miserable 

I can’t snap at her but many days, I feel like it. I need patience but it’s running thin. ",2,1731259252.0,MuslimMarriage,0,1.0,False

Basically, you do surveys to earn points, and you can cash out once you have enough. Plus, they have a few bonus features to boost your earnings, which makes it a bit more interesting!

**Earn Money by Taking Surveys**  
The main thing here is the surveys. They’re usually pretty quick and straightforward, and you earn points for each one you complete. I’ve been doing them during coffee breaks—it’s a nice way to feel productive and earn a little something on the side! ☕💸

**Earn by Playing Games: A Mix of Fun and Frustration 🤨**  
Prime Opinion actually lets you earn by playing games too, which is cool, but fair warning: some of these games can be a bit unpredictable with rewards. Some are worth it, while others make you work a little harder than I’d like. But hey, if you like gaming, it’s another way to earn while having fun. 🎮🕹️

**Weekly Raffles: Win Up to 1,000 Points! 🎁**  
If you’re consistent and do at least one survey every day for seven days, you get entered into a raffle. Last time, I won 500 points (roughly $5), which covered my coffee costs for the week! ☕ Not a bad deal, so I try to keep up with the streak.

**Leveling Up: Unlock Extra Perks 📈**  
There’s a level system too, which makes it feel a bit like a game. Each time you level up, you unlock features and earn extra points. Maybe one day I’ll hit level 99 and be the ""Survey King""! 👑😂

I set up an altar the first night with a candle, coins, a poem for him and crystals (this is my first time working with deities so hopefully it was a okay effort 😅)  Then I did a a meditation, speaking in my thoughts to him of who I am and I am thankful for him to reach out. I told him my situation (finance struggles, not being able to travel that much anymore). 

The next day I go to get my coffee and the barista said it’s on the house! Today I went to get coffee again and they gave me a bigger size on accident but charged for the small size. These small things are amazing to me. 🫶💗🐢

Looking for Advice on ADHD Med Experiences,"Hey guys, I know Adderall vs. Vyvanse has been discussed a lot, but I wanted to share my experience and get advice. I tried Strattera initially, but the nausea was unbearable. After a QB test confirmed ADHD, my doctor prescribed Adderall XR (he avoids IR for adults due to potential abuse).

Since then, I’ve been going back and forth between Vyvanse and Adderall XR. I haven’t tried other stimulants, so my experience is limited to these two. I’m trying to find the right balance of dosage and side effects, and would love to hear your experiences. Currently, I’m on 30mg Adderall XR but called my doc today to switch back to 50mg Vyvanse to see if it better suits my schedule.

Here’s what I’ve noticed:
Adderall XR: Helps with focus, but I tend to obsess over small details (like spending hours perfecting school assignments). My drive peaks between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., then tanks when I need energy for evening classes or clients, so I end up drinking coffee. Also, interruptions really throw me off.

Vyvanse: I felt able to switch between tasks and enjoy hobbies without hyperfocusing. It was refreshing but confusing—I switched back to Adderall months ago because I didn’t feel as motivated on Vyvanse and felt irritable with headaches. This weekend was better, though, so I called my doc to switch back.

Main questions:
1.How can I tell if my dose is too low or high?
2.Has anyone else found it easier to “switch tasks” on Vyvanse vs. Adderall?
3.Should I try a different stimulant? I haven’t tried Ritalin and worry about switching meds in a busy program.

Any advice or tips would be awesome. Thanks so much!",3,1731259196.0,ADHD,3,1.0,False

1go5mvk,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1go5mvk/time_looped_chapter_25/,Time Looped (Chapter 25),"Dead goblins covered the bathroom floor. Even more were pinned lifelessly to the walls. Sadly, despite the many killed, three remained alive, standing above Helen’s lifeless body.

For several seconds, Will stood there, his mind unable to comprehend what his eyes were seeing. There was no way Helen could be killed. As a knight, fighting was her element. She had undoubtedly proved it by dispatching all the creatures that lay scattered about, and still they had managed to get to her.

Before he could realize what was going on, Jace rushed by him into the room. One of the goblins tried to turn around, only to get a dish in the face, sending it flying straight into the bathroom window.

“Fuck!” the jock swore, gripping his hand. As much pain as his punch had caused, he felt as if he’d received twice more in return. It was as if the creature he was fighting was made from stone.

The remaining two goblins snarled. Finished with their initial prey, they turned their attention to Jace, swinging at him with their knives. One of the weapons struck the jock’s thigh, sending him to the ground convulsing in agony. Coincidentally, it was this that snapped Will back to reality. Taking advantage of the fact that they weren’t paying attention to him, he rushed in, striking the nearest creature on the back of the neck. The method had worked fine a while ago, but this time he had the misfortune of hitting the goblin at the top of the spine. Lacking strength of accuracy, the tip of the blade pierced the skin, causing some significant discomfort, but failed to do much more.

With a scream, the target of the attack turned around. Eyes glared at the boy, conveying dozens of threats and curses in fractions of a second.

Still gripping the knife, the boy stepped back into the hallway. Losing the element of surprise, he had a pretty good idea of how this would end. There remained a one in a hundred chance that he might evade the goblin’s next attack, but even if he did, it wasn’t like he could kill it off, or rush to his mirror to get the rogue class.

“Why did you appear here?” he wondered, as he continued stepping back.

The goblins didn’t bother answering. No longer viewing Jace as a threat, both charged at Will, snarling as they did. The front one struck, aiming for the boy’s chest. The tip of the knife split the air, far too fast for Will to react, but just before it hit him, something caused the goblin to freeze in place.

*Did that just happen?* Part of the boy’s mind wondered. The rest instinctively made him swing his own knife, this time striking the side of the creature. The familiar disgusting gurgle followed.

“Lit hit!” Alex appeared out of nowhere.

“Huh?” Will looked at his friend. “Where were you?”

“Usual. Get my class, level up, get the notes from Mister June and the harpy…”

“You what? Why the heck will you do that now?!”

To Will’s annoyance, the goofball only shrugged.

“Tradition, bro,” he said with a smile. “Is cool, bro. Things are cool.”

Looking at the situation, things seemed anything but “cool.” The school was already starting to panic. The coach and a few more teachers were visible at the far end of the hallway, rushing in order to find out what was going on. News of the goblins had probably spread all over social media at this point. It wouldn’t be long before police, firefighters, and all the local media arrived to ask questions.

Meanwhile, Helen was dead and Jace wished he were.

“Time to rush, bro,” Alex said.

“What about Jace and Helen?”

“We’ll see them in eight minutes.”

Eight minutes… that meant that the entire goblin encounter had taken less than two. With all the adrenaline, Will felt that hours had passed.

As Will followed Alex to the exit, possibilities ran through his mind. If he had taken the rogue skill, maybe things would have been different. He’d have dealt with the creatures, that was for certain, possibly fast enough to help Helen before she was killed. Jace wouldn’t have had to step in and break his hand. The scene of panic, though, wouldn’t have been avoided, or would it?

In the background, several of the corpses had already turned transparent. In a matter of minutes, they would have vanished completely, just as the wolves did once they had been defeated.

Sirens sounded as the boys left the building. Naturally, there was yet a school announcement to be made. For some reason, people had a harder time accepting that goblins were real than wolves running down the hallways.

“What happened?” Will asked as the pair rushed across the street. “Were they supposed to appear like that?”

“No clue, bro. First time for me.”

The calmness with which he said it made the statement sound disingenuous.

“Danny didn’t say anything about them?”

“Maybe.” Alex glanced over his shoulder. “He said there were more than wolves a week before he died.”

The running turned to walking. Not long after, they were at their usual coffee shop, drinking cocoa. Several police cars had already reached the school. Even the local news channel had picked up the story, spinning all sorts of theories on what had actually happened. Not even overenthusiastic reporters dared mention the notion of disappearing goblins, so theyw ere keeping things simultaneously vague and ominous enough to increase their audience.

Will checked his phone. Two minutes remained until eight.

“Was it a mistake making her the key holder?” the boy asked, stirring his drink without as much as a sip.

“Girl’s a knight,” Alex replied, as if that explained it all. One had to admit that she had killed a lot more than Will, Jace, and the goofball combined.

“Did any of them jump out of your mirror?”

“Nah.”

“They must appear only when they see the key holder.” Just like wolves in corners. “Why the starting mirror, though?”

“Bro, eternity is…” Alex waved his hands about as if preparing for an incantation in a children’s show. “… eternity. No one knows. Shit happens.”

Will stopped stirring his drink. The liquid continued to twirl on its own.

“How do you manage?” He looked at the goofball. “Weirdness left and right and you’re calm as a champ.”

“Sigma chad, bro,” the other laughed. “Nah, you’ll get there in a few thousand loops. Not much new.”

“The goblins were new,”

“Used to newness.” Alex laughed, then chucked down the cocoa as if it were water, making even the barista wince. “Helen was new,” he added. “You too, bro.”

“Yes, we’re all new compared to you.”

“True that!”

The conversation was an exercise in uselessness, yet it had managed to provide enough calm for Will to start thinking about the problem at hand. Philosophical ponderings aside, they had been given a task with no obvious solution to complete. Last loop, Will was wondering how many loops it would take them to defeat the boss. Now, he wasn’t even sure they could deal with the initial wave of goblins.

“Can I have another, bro?” the goofball yelled at the barista.

“Shouldn’t you be at school?” the man asked, but took his cup and went for a refill.

“Nah. Big oof at school today. Won’t be over till noon.”

Everything considered that wasn’t far from the truth. It wouldn’t be a surprise if school was canceled for an entire week until enough people from enough institutions had done a thorough investigation. From their perspective, something weird had happened a week after the unusual suicide of a student. As far as the world outside the loops was concerned, there was a chance that both events were somehow connected. Speeches would be made, psychologists hired. The entire school would get sessions scheduled with Mister June to discuss what would be considered the most important topic of the day. Helen’s family would go in mourning and hold a small service, then after a few weeks, things would return to normal.

Suddenly, a terrifying idea crossed Will’s mind. What if there was another pause in eternity? The girl had claimed that Daniel was on track to find a way out of the game, then he had died and the cycle of loops was broken until Will had taken his place.

“Did Danny say anything about being a key holder?” the boy asked, checking the time on his phone. Seventeen seconds remained till the end of the loop.

“Nah, bro. Told you.”

“Are you sure?”

“Yup, bro. Why?”

“What if Helen’s dead?”

“Hey, don’t worry, bro. Happens. I’ve been dead plenty of times.”

“Dead dead!” Will all but shouted. “We chose her to be the key holder. What if it was our task to protect the key holder while she unlocks the mirrors and finds the boss?”

Several seconds passed with both Alex and Will looking at each other motionless, as if someone had transformed them into a pair of statues.

“Big oof,” the goofball said at last. That was something new that he hadn’t seen coming.

If Will’s suspicion was true, that meant that everything that had occurred today would remain unchanged until another participant was found.

“Sorry about this, but how exactly will you be paying?” the barista asked, placing the full mug of coco in front of Alex.

“Cash, bro,” the boy reached into his pocket.

“Cash?” The barista gave him a suspicious look. In general, the coffee shop accepted cash, even coins. That was part of its charm. Having a school student pay with cash so readily did raise a few red flags, though. “I thought all of you used phones.”

“Nah, bro. Left my wallet in my other phone.”

Before the man could get to make a comment on the topic, the loop ended.

 

**Restarting eternity.**

 

*Quickly, quickly!*

Will pulled his phone out of his pocket and quickly typed in Helen’s number. After the entire Danny file debacle, he had learned it by heart. This time, he wasn’t going to send a text, going directly for a call.

“Where are you?” He looked around. Normally, this was the time about which Jess and her friend would pass by and greet him with a random insult. For some reason, that hadn’t happened.

*It’s a reset*, he told himself. A new loop started, so it had to be a reset. That meant that Helen had to be alive and everything that happened ten minutes ago—goblins, death, and all—was nothing but a memory. And yet the girl refused to respond.

*Pick up! Pick up! Pick up!*

The call got declined. Will stared at the screen of his phone, uncertain how to react. Of all the times he’d phoned Helen after joining eternity, she hadn’t hung up on him once. Refusing to accept defeat, he quickly redialed and put his phone against his ear, as if that might increase his chances of success.

“What?” Helen asked in a rather annoyed tone.

*Thank goodness*, the boy let out a mental sign of relief. She was alive, at least.

“Where are you?” he asked.

“I’m in the hallway, right about to—”

“Don’t go in!” he interrupted. “Stay where you are and I’ll be there in a sec!”

“Why not?”

That wasn’t a question he wanted to hear. Keeping his phone between his head and his shoulder, Will rushed into the school, running towards the boy’s bathroom.

“Don’t you remember what happened yesterday?” he asked.

“Of course, I remember. Why do you think I—”

“Running in the hallways, Stone?” the massive figure of the coach asked, blocking Will’s bath.

The boy swallowed. He definitely didn’t remember this part. Normally, the coach would be gone by this time, off to have his shouting session with the football team. The fact that he wasn’t meant that something had changed. Seeing Helen a short distance away, giving him an annoyed glare, phone in hand, told him that she might have been the cause.

“I need to go, coach!” The boy feigned urgency and rushed by the coach.

The large man made a halfhearted attempt to stop him, but not really. As someone who had experienced similar situations, he empathized with the need to go to the toilet. Still, since his public image was on display, he diplomatically waited for Will to enter the boy’s bathroom, then went on a mini tirade about how it was proper to take care of bodily functions before going to school and not relying on finding a bathroom at the last minute. No one in the hallway paid much attention, which only gave the man the excuse to turn around and continue in the direction he had originally been heading before all this.

Meanwhile, Will went through the standard mirror sequence in the bathroom, tapping all of them in the known order. Messages appeared and disappeared, but he didn’t even read them. Taking advantage of the rogue’s reaction speed, he rushed out into the corridor again. The moment he did, the phone in his ear gave off the familiar sound indicating that the person on the other end had ended the call.

“Well?” Helen asked.

“I’m just glad you’re okay.” The boy smiled, then looked at the door to the girl’s bathroom. “Haven’t been there, right?”

“No.” Helen crossed her arms, still a bit suspicious.

“Let me borrow the knight for this loop, okay?”

Not waiting for an answer, Will rushed in. There was no sign of the goblins, nor thankfully, anyone else. The mirrors acted as normal, reflecting everything opposite them, just like any mirror would. Taking a deep breath, the boy tapped every mirror in turn, then ran to the exit, expecting a swarm of goblins to emerge. They didn’t.

*I was right,* he thought. Suddenly, his phone pinged.

**U ok?**

The message appeared. Will was just about to answer when he had a better idea, tapping on the video call icon. To little surprise, Helen accepted.

“Any goblins?” she asked, remaining in voice only.

“Not for now. Go full video.”

Helen’s profile picture changed, displaying her face.

“What’s up?” she asked.

“Hold there for a moment.” He pointed the screen of the phone at one of the mirrors. There was a moment of tenseness, though it was soon gone as nothing happened. Apparently, the key holder had to be in front of a mirror in person in order for the effect to be triggered.

“Nice try. Want me to come in?”

“No. Call the others. We’re going to the coffee shop. I have an idea.”

1go5k96,https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/1go5k96/introverts_and_anxiety_practical_strategies_for/,Introverts and Anxiety: Practical Strategies for Sustainable Wellbeing,"Introverts. Those of us who prefer calm situations and environments. We may enjoy socialising but we recharge by spending time on our own, we often enjoying getting lost in our own thoughts – just enjoying being inside our own heads for a while. We tend to lean toward smaller, close-knit social lives. But let’s clear up a misconception: introversion doesn’t mean we’re anti-social. It just means we are at our best in situations that aren’t overwhelming.


Anxiety. The emotion that warns us when something threatening seems to be just around the corner. In moments of true danger, it can be life-saving: the foresight that there is trouble ahead, and those vital few seconds to get ready for it saved many of our ancient ancestors (while their peers perished – unable to pass on their genes.) That’s one of the factors why we’re here today. But, when anxiety lingers beyond its intended purpose, it becomes not just tiring—it’s exhausting. If this sounds familiar, you’re definitely not alone.

Not all introverts experience anxiety, and you don’t have to be an introvert to struggle with it. But many introverts do. It’s a common combination, and knowing how to navigate it can make all the difference.


Signs You’re an Introvert with Anxiety—which ones do you relate to the most?
1. You Typically Overprepare
You think through worst-case scenarios in detail. It makes you feel more in control—but it can also be draining.
Tip: When you find yourself imagining worst-case outcomes, think about a balanced ""most likely scenario"" scenario too. Give yourself permission to think about the ‘’best case scenario’’ – luck isn’t a good strategy, but take it when you get it! Thinking through these scenarios helps to bring your anxious thoughts back to a more realistic middle ground. This practice doesn’t stop your mind from thinking about risks but it does help add perspective.


2. You Tend to Overthink and Listen to Your Inner Critic
Introverts often have rich inner lives, which can mean their internal dialogue is active—sometimes too active. Anxiety amplifies this, often turning up the volume on self-critical thoughts.
Tip: Develop a ritual for challenging anxious thoughts. When a negative thought comes up, ask yourself: ""Is this thought 100% true?"" Most often, it won’t be. Questioning and even writing down these thoughts can give you some distance from them, reducing their power. If this is an issue for, look up my article ‘From Limitations to Liberation’ – it takes a dive in to tackling limiting beliefs. 


3. You Always Feel the Need to Be Busy
Anxiety often compels you to keep moving (it’s a high energy ‘state’ – one of the reasons it can be so tiring)—constantly doing something. But staying busy can sometimes just mean staying distracted, without actually being effective.
Tip: Replace ""busy"" with ""purposeful."" Each day, set just one or two specific goals that really matter to you. A small amount of focused effort is often more satisfying (and less stressful) than a day spent rushing from one task to the next with no real direction. Ask yourself at least five times a day: ‘what is the most value adding thing (in the context of what your life is about) I could be doing right now?’


4. You Prefer Routines and Struggle When Things Go Off-Plan
Routines give a sense of control, but sometimes they turn into rigid safety nets – sometimes beyond them being value adding. When something unexpected happens, it can trigger deep unease.
Tip: Practice gentle flexibility. Start small: maybe change the route you walk or try a new café. These small ""novelty exercises"" help build resilience for when larger, unexpected changes occur. The key is to show yourself that change, is often manageable. Remember that change is neither good or bad (change can also be for the better). Remember also that we have been ‘programmed’ by our evolution to perceive change as bad: once we transcend that ‘programming’ new avenues of opportunity open up for us.  


5. You Hide Nervousness Behind a Mask
You’ve learned to mask nervousness well, but that doesn’t mean it’s not taking a toll internally.
Tip: Identify trusted people who you can be honest with. Even if it’s just one close friend or a journal entry, letting out what you're feeling helps you process the anxiety instead of holding it all in. Vulnerability is powerful; it connects you to others and often takes the edge off anxiety.


6. You See More Danger Than Others in Everyday Situations
Anxiety primes your mind to be vigilant (and reduces your options – see my article ‘Live the life you choose – expand your Thought-Action Repertoire’), sometimes turning neutral situations into seemingly threatening ones.
Tip: Try reframing the ""threat."" If you’re anxious before a social event, instead of focusing on what could go wrong, set a small, achievable goal for the event—like having a meaningful conversation with one person. Reframing your focus can help your mind move away from perceived threats and toward positive intentions.


7. Perfectionism and People-Pleasing
Perfectionism often stems from a need to feel worthy. Beliefs like “I need everyone to like me to be valuable” create intense anxiety around how you’re perceived.
Tip: Shift from a focus on being liked to being authentic (are you living your life for you or for ‘them’?) Practice saying ""no"" in low-stakes situations. Remember, you’re not responsible for everyone else’s happiness: you are responsible for your well-being (not theirs!) The right people will appreciate your true self more than a perfected (according to who?) version of you.


8. Nerves Sometimes Turn You In to an Over-Talker
Normally, you speak only when you feel confident, but anxiety can shift you into overdrive, where you say too much to fill the silence.
Tip: If you catch yourself over-talking, pause and take a deep breath. Silence can feel awkward, but it’s not a problem. Giving yourself permission to pause helps reduce the pressure to fill every moment with words.


9. Trouble Sleeping
Anxiety makes it hard for your mind to shut off at night, leading to trouble falling asleep, frequent waking, or early rising.
Tip: Create a ""wind-down"" routine. Dedicate the last 30-60 minutes before bed to relaxing, tech-free activities. Reading something light, or writing down your thoughts can help signal your brain that it’s time to rest. Top tips (1) get as cold as you can (reductions in our core body temperatures are a cue to go to sleep) (2) forget the clock telling you it is ‘lights out’ time – read until your eyes close and your head nods.


Moving From Awareness to Action
Being an introvert with anxiety can feel overwhelming at times, but it’s also something you can learn to manage with care and practice. Anxiety may not disappear overnight, but you can make shifts that help it lose its hold on your everyday life. You’re not alone. Many of us walk this path, learning how to balance the gifts and challenges of introversion and anxiety. Keep being gentle with yourself—there’s strength in softness.


Practical Strategies for Thriving as an Introvert

1.	Create and Protect Your Recharge Time
For us introverts, alone time is essential for recharging. Make it non-negotiable. Whether it’s 30 minutes in the morning or a quiet evening ritual, schedule time just for yourself. Communicate this need with those around you—it’s a matter of maintaining your well-being, not just a preference.


2.	Leverage Your Strengths in One-on-One or Small Group Interactions
We tend to excel in deeper, more intimate conversations. Rather than pushing yourself to thrive in large social gatherings, seek out or create opportunities for one-on-one or small group interactions. You could host a dinner with close friends, or meet up individually for coffee. Cultivate the type of social life that aligns with your strengths.


3.	Prepare and Plan for Social Situations
One of the best tools for introverts is preparation. If you have a social event or a work meeting coming up, prepare conversation topics, questions, or think about what you hope to get from the interaction. This doesn’t mean scripting everything, but it does mean having some mental prompts to feel more comfortable and confident. You don’t even have to say much: a few thoughtful questions can go a long way.


4.	Create a Space at Home that Grounds You
Set up a specific space in your home where you feel completely relaxed—this could be a reading nook, a meditation corner, or even just a comfy chair by a window. Use this space to do whatever helps you feel grounded, such as journaling, reading, or simply sitting in silence. Having a dedicated spot to return to helps to re-centre yourself, especially after having been with people.


5.	Harness Your Listening Superpower
Introverts are often strong listeners, and this can be a powerful skill in both social and work settings. Make it a habit to ask thoughtful questions and really listen—this not only helps you navigate social settings more comfortably, but also makes people value your presence. Remember, quality over quantity is where you shine.


So, ask yourself: What is one thing from this article that resonates most with you? What small action can you take today to start navigating your life in a healthier way?

Anyway I haven't experienced any tooth/gum related symptoms or whatever so I'm pretty confident they're healthy, albeit looking rather yellow but I'm sure that's just genetics since I don't smoke or drink coffee. 

In the end I just want to know if the ""flossing is necessary"" thing doesn't actually apply to everyone because I honestly do not see any reason why I have to hunch over the sink and do finger contortionism just to get nothing out of it. I do not understand how some people can floss everyday, it's plain torture for me. ",1,1731258946.0,DentalHygiene,0,1.0,False

I was scrolling through delhi subs (because, well, I’m from Gurgaon) when I saw a post asking for underrated spots in Delhi to grab coffee. Naturally, I jumped in with a comment about how Gurgaon’s coffee shops actually have better vibes. I mean, no traffic, no noise – you know the drill. 😎

Then, this girl responds, calling me out, saying that no amount of “Gurgaon peace” can compete with the ""chaos and charm"" of Delhi. We started riffing back and forth, and before I knew it, we were debating the superiority of Delhi street food vs. Gurgaon malls. (Yes, it got that deep). I’m telling you, the banter was on point.

She dropped this insane line about how “Gurgaon might have fancy malls, but Delhi has real taste in everything,” and I had to clap back, “Gurgaon has 20 different types of coffee; Delhi has...dust and honking."" 😂

We both ended up sending each other ridiculous pics of where we live – her showing off her iconic Delhi street corner and me proudly showcasing a random park in Gurgaon (because let’s be real, that's the most peaceful thing we’ve got).

By the end, we were having a mini rivalry, and it honestly felt like we were old friends, even though we’ve never met. It was like we were on a completely different wavelength.

Hey everyone!

Hope everyone’s doing well. I’m just here bored at work lol.

I’m just looking for more friends that like to write/rp and draw! I’m honestly very open-minded with subject matters. I used to be the kind of artist that did a lot of self-inserts back in the day, and I even wrote fanfiction xD

I play a lot of single player games and FFXIV on my pc. I have a ps5 and am slowly going through FF7Rebirth. I get distracted a lot.

TV shows… let’s see. I watch a bit of anime; so stuff like Elusive Samurai, that one anime with crow people that has a name I can never remember. I also read manga too. Finally getting into Vagabond and Vinland Saga. Berserk and Witch Hat Atelier are my absolute favs.  
I’m watching ‘Dark Winds’ with my partner, and I usually end up just watching the BBC version of Pride and Prejudice as a comfort show. LoTR is my comfort movie as far as trilogy’s go. I’m a little picky with actual tv shows though and am totally fine with foreign ones too. Jordskott was a favorite of mine to watch!

I don’t read as often as I’d like sadly, kinda dropped the ball with it.

Anyways! Besides all that I like hot Cheeto fries and coffee (not together that sounds terrible for both ends lol). Botanical gardens, museums, observatories, the zoo or the aquarium, anything where I can be outside and just learn about stuff and see nature is always a good thing for me. Also coffee shops, I am not a coffee expert,  but I love the smell of it! Also with some pan dulce or something is good.

I’m a Latina and non-binary. Fashion style is kind of goth/alt and always sleepy lol. I speak Spanish and I’m looking to get back into practicing that and maybe Japanese or Swedish again.

Fun fact: I’ve been to Sweden a couple of times

I’m looking for friends closer in age that like joking around and can also be mature at times. I’m burnt out from being the therapy friend all the time so I just want people I can be a dork with and relax a little.

Also if you looove monster romances! Can we be friends?! lol",4,1731258372.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

I have been working with individuals with developmental disabilities throughout my working career. A few years ago I decided to get my teaching degree to teach Special Needs Education (from WGU as this enabled me to keep working and pay my bills as an adult student and keep being a mom).

I recently reached my student teaching portion of my degree, and unfortunately at the same time was laid off from my previous job working with IDD clients (my department was closed).

My school has had a difficult time placing me locally, possibly due to how many teaching programs are in our immediate area. However, they told me that if I was able to find a teacher that would volunteer sponsoring me, that I could start my student teaching that way rather than waiting for placement from the school (it's been two months now without finding placement).

I'm seeking dual endorsement (Elementary GenEd/SpEd, Secondary SpEd) so I'm needing 500+ hours of mentorship/demonstration/observation in order to satisfy my degree requirements, which means I need almost an entire semester of student teaching time. I'm worried that if I get too far into the spring semester I will have to wait until the fall of 2025 to complete my hours.

Does anyone have any local resources or recommendations on anything I could do to get placement?

Are there any other teachers out there that would consider sitting down with me over coffee or something, and giving me a chance to introduce myself, that maybe they would consider sponsoring me?

Thank you all for any information or help you can provide!

The star-sent’s ‘hydroponics’ were the newest source of confusion for the farmer. The air smelled of something acrid, and the room was more humid than a marshy island’s summer. Rows and rows of interspersed columns stretched across the wide circular floor, the mass of white pipes and blue tubes connecting everything like veins. If such an analogy were truly apt, then the heart would be the conglomeration of the star-sent’s machines, electronics, and pumps that worked noisily in the center of the dome. Then, there was the farmer. She was like… Well…

Hmm. The black-skinned female did not actually know enough about organs to put herself into the comparison—even more so with how little she knew about what her tasks even *were*. Refilling ‘nutrient tanks,’ checking on water-seed growth, and ensuring the symbols of light were within a ‘range’ were all alien to her when she first heard them. All she knew before was how to tend to the fields of dirt and crops, not whatever Cycle-worshiping pseudo-farming this was!

…And then the Creator taught her. Throughout the morning, the esoteric male took her and the other two farmers around the glass, metal, and stone building, teaching them all about its uses and the females’ purpose within it. He related the concepts of water, nutrients, roots, and sunlight to their applications for the growth of flora. It was a lot to take in, but as he explained the subjects more and more, she began to understand exactly what he meant, uncovering the truth behind the plants she once cultivated.

She recognized it now—about the flora, yes of course, but also about the star-sent. Others had spoken highly of him, and the farmer could certainly understand where they were coming from initially. The settlers were given everything they needed to thrive. However, she now knew there was more depth to their appreciation after directly speaking to him. He explained the concepts of the world she never knew before, used the foci of *every* Tridei sect, and presented it all in ways the farmers would understand. If she had not known his purpose was to construct a colony before, she would have easily guessed such after her training. His skills in preparing the banished—both in equipment and in knowledge—were directed and exceptionally efficient in ensuring they had everything they would need for their tasks.

The black-skinned female had spent but a few days within his burgeoning colony, but she could not help but feel a sense of reverence for her leader. Having a male chief was queer, but the veneration was there nonetheless. Perhaps it was because of his unrelenting commitment to the settlement. His eyes bore a deep hue beneath their lids and his motions were enervated. His work must take a toll on him, especially with such a small masculine body.

Her stomach knotted at the idea of his undertaking. Exceptional his skills and knowledge may be, but he was still a male. Why do the females here allow him to continue with such arduous labor by his lonesome? To participate with such physical involvement? Some part disgust and another of pity layered around her consciousness at the sight. Some females had the competency to assist his struggles, but that hardly made up for it with their inconsistency. Lord above, he was put into live combat alongside them! Uncomfortable would be an *understatement* for how that idea made her feel. But, such had to be ignored… for now. The settlement was successful, and every pair of hands was needed for its construction… Even if it pitted those who must be protected into danger… From dawn till dusk. 

That was another detail of their foreign chief. He was apparently the last to slumber, yet was still found working before most even opened their eyes. Akula said that Rook and the other harvesters had attempted to replicate his work ethic by waking up at the same time. They were successful… but only if they went to their beds much earlier than was commonly accepted. Their results continued to this day but to a lesser degree. The miners would return to their nests after dinner, allowing them to wake shortly after the creator, once the sun rose. They admirably fed his machines with metals and lumber by first sunlight, marching to and from the cave with equipment in hand.

Now it was the farmer’s turn to do her part, she supposed. She was previously assigned as a fisherwoman, but now her expertise in farming could be used for the betterment of the settlement’s future. Perhaps if she excelled in her tasks and encouraged growth within the crops, the Creator would notice… and maybe not just for her labor.  He… He had no female to truly see to his stress or to compliment his strenuous work. None to ensure he need not endanger himself. Neither the paladin nor the artificer had cared to offer themselves, so… so what if the farmer could fill a role for such an esteemed male? Her many winters of sowing fields and reaping the benefits had formed her strength and will. Her reliability and effort were incomparable to that of the townsfolk slobs, so she need not worry about such.

What she did need to worry about was making herself known. Such a task started with something as simple as ensuring her crops grew healthily and plentiful. Then, perhaps he may find more use of her…

The hydroponics dome automation code was done, the walls were just about halfway finished, mining and exploratory expeditions were underway, and most of the Malkrin were trained in weapon usage, so what else was there to do? Harrison sat in a dark and empty corner of the workshop. Away from the cacophonous lines of efficiently placed machines. Away from their encroaching clutter. But their reach and noise could never fully be escaped. The sounds had become one with his ears by then.

A white desk lamp lit the mess of loose paper, notebooks, and pens on his workspace. He rested an elbow on the table, holding his head up with the heel of his hand. He rapped his fingers against his skull with deadened taps like the hammers of a piston. His nose was constantly crinkled into a slight snarl—it was the only way to passively soften the blow of his beating migraine. No combination of caffeine or over-the-counter drugs would help him now. He hated how draining the headache had become, sucking what little energy he scraped by with each day. It was the absolute *last* thing he needed right then, but there wasn’t a damn thing he could do about it, save for the kind of medicine to put him to sleep for days… or forever.

He clenched his hand into a fist, pushing his forehead into his knuckles in a pitiful attempt to flush away the dragging agony. A sting of frustration poked at his already furrowed brows, boiling up into complete resentment for his body. Why now? Why fucking ***now***? There were only a few days until the blood-moon. He had so much to prepare for, so much to read, but his eyes could barely focus on the screen in front of him. 

His writing hand shook as his breaths grew quicker. He had at least three-hundred pages of defensive doctrine to read over, another hundred about wall mechanics-slash-statics, and god-knows however more about geography. How was he supposed to start any of it? It was like God himself simply pointed to Harrison and decided he was going to suffer. Why? He had so much to do, but none of it could be done if he couldn’t *focus*. Couldn’t it have waited until he had some time to breathe? For some time when he wasn’t under a mountain’s worth of things to worry about? Stupid shit always had to happen when he—

*Snap.*

A shot of pain sparked in his hand. His eyes shot open. Black liquid seeped out of his palm and onto the notes he was writing, a hint of maroon slipping into the oily mess. Dammit… *DAMMIT*.

He hissed boiling frustration through his teeth at the accident. He dropped the pen into its spilled contents, flicking his hand free from loose biofuel-based ink. The trickle of blood in his grip was the least of his worries compared to losing however many notes were just made unreadable. He pinched the bridge of his nose with his uncontaminated hand, closing his eyes shut. Why didn’t he just move to online notes? He wasn’t on any orbital station, so why did he still follow recording regulations? Was he stupid? Maybe. Jesus, why couldn’t something just go right for him?

He felt a soft grip on his shoulder, Tracy’s warm, worried voice following. “Hey, uh… You alright, man?”

Harrison didn’t flinch at the sudden appearance, nor did he open his eyes. He mumbled out his retort with venom. “Just peachy.”

The sound of a hand clapping against the desk drew his attention, bringing the technician’s sympathetic frown and pinched brows into view. “You just snapped your pen in half and your hand’s bleeding. You’re not good, man… Here, since you always insist we carry aid kits.”

She reached around her overall’s waist section and pulled out a zipped-up kit with a little red cross on the corner. It took her less time to pull out a bandage and a sterile dab than it took him to realize what she was doing.

He held out a hand, speaking sternly. “Trace, I’m fine. It’s barely a cut and I—”

“*Shut*,” she ordered, pushing down on his shoulder and preventing him from standing up. She stepped around him, gently dragging her hand across his neck until she reached the ink-stained side of him.

She hovered beside the desk, tenderly grabbing the sides of his arm. He wordlessly watched her clean the black tar away with her small hands and inspect the larger-than-expected gash on his palm. Was he really gripping it that hard? Christ…

Tracy stared at him out of the corner of her eye, her frown having grown larger. She whispered simple questions. “What the hell did you do? What’s up with you, man?”

“It was an accident,” he returned with a heavy exhale. His anger had run dry under the woman’s soft touch. It almost helped to distract him from the pounding migraine festering around his forehead. The one hand she used to hold his arm softly massaged the skin underneath with circular motions of her thumb.

“Really? Harrison… You don’t look too hot. Seriously, tell me what’s up,” she pleaded, wrapping gauze around his palm with slow motions.

Harrison stared at her flatly. “I’m failing to keep up with work because of a stupid migraine. It’s quite frankly pissing me off.”

She winced, nodding. “Shit, dude. Sorry about that. Can I get anything for you? You want, like, coffee or some painkillers or something?”

He shook his head sluggishly. “There’s nothing I haven’t already tried today.”

“Right…” Tracy sucked in air through her teeth, her face lighting up after a split moment of silence. She looked right into his eyes, raised a brow, and smiled warmly. “How about you take a break and I’ll help you with your migraine? My dad taught me just the technique.”

He pinched the bridge of his nose, shaking his head. “Does it look like I have the time to take a break?”

Her soft massage of his hand grew a bit more intense. She gave him the ‘really?’ face, looking completely nonplussed. “And how much work are you getting done with your migraine? What if it gets worse? What if you have to suffer through it during the blood-moon? What then?”

“No, Trace, I really need to—”

“Shush.” She poked his forehead. “I’m helping you. Just wait right here, I’ll be back in a moment.”

He grumbled, but nodded anyway. She had a bit of a point. Honestly, he’d do anything for some miracle right about then. So much so that he’d be willing to put away the piling jobs for it, even if the idea of doing anything but picking away at them put a tightness in his chest. Hopefully, Tracy knew her stuff. The taps of her boots got quieter and quieter as she left, only to return moments later with an even quicker pace. He didn’t bother to even look in her direction at that point, using all the energy he had to shut his eyes and rub his forehead with his knuckles.

There was a rusting of nylon nearby, followed by a loud ‘*ziiiiiip*’. He cracked open an eye to see the technician flattening out a sleeping bag of all things. She had it laid out on the floor next to his desk and  sat on her shins at the head portion of the makeshift bed.

“…You have a sleeping bag…?” he questioned, holding up his head with a fist.

“Mid-day naps.” She shrugged, patting her thighs with a lighthearted smile. “C’mere. I’ll fix ya right up.”

“I don’t really think that—”

“You’ve let me give you a massage with both of us half-naked,” she firmly stated with incredulously raised brows.

“That’s not what I was—”

A ‘fake angry’ expression snapped on her face, a cheek puffed up in a pout. “Shut up and come here.”

The engineer sighed, pushing himself off his desk with a grunt. His exhaustion showed with his annoyingly sluggish stride toward Tracy. It took him a few seconds to let his weight down onto the comfortable sleeping bag, and a little bit longer to lay down supine. His head lay just below her knees on the makeshift bed, close enough for her to do whatever she needed.

“What are you doing?” She stared down at him with fists on her hips.

He looked up at her, disgruntled at the sharp question. “Laying down?”

She gestured to her legs with wide open palms. “Wrong place, dumbass.”

Harrison wasn’t given a moment to retort before she dug her fingers underneath his shoulders, pulling his head onto her awfully squishy thighs. Their soft give encompassed the back of his beating skull while her hands pressed into his temples. He felt a tenseness in his chest at the unexpected position, taking in a deep breath. It was… sort of awkward, despite the comfort.

She smirked, a playful tone in her voice. “You’re supposed to relax, not freak out.”

“I wasn’t,” he grumbled.

“If you say so. Just close your eyes and lemme work.”

He resigned to his fate, doing just as she asked. Her fingernails calmly dragged from his hair toward his forehead, her warm fingertips pressing into the skin. She tapped in repeating motions, drumming patterns with the heart-beat pains of his migraine.

He eventually gave up in keeping his eyes open, feeling a small shift in her body a few seconds later. She whispered just above him, wisps of her hot breath passing his skin. “Focus on the taps, feel every point of pressure on your skin.”

Entire fingers were soon draped across his scalp and forehead, moving in comforting circles. She spoke again, her quiet voice emphasizing each ‘S’ and popping on each ‘P.’ “Now focus on your head, relax your muscles, and push out all the stress and built-up tension… Unclench your teeth, unfurrow your brows… Then move to your neck… Mmmhmmm. See? Let it unwind. Now, slowly move to your chest and do the same…Now your shoulders…”

He succumbed to the instructions, feeling out every part of his body and just… letting go. He didn’t even realize how tense most of his muscles were, especially around his face and neck. They were all practically stone when he started, but they soon melted into jelly as time went on and he fell into a deeper trance. It was like gravity became ten times weaker in just a few minutes, letting him feel weightless. Her warm words, her fingers massaging his forehead, and the slow reset of his figure drew what minuscule energy he had away. His closed eyes became ever-harder to reopen. He didn’t really want to anyway. His mind was once rampant with worries about the blood-moon, his building workload, and the headache-inducing stress of his position, but even that too fell away.

Harrison might have heard giggles and maybe a near-silent ‘hell yeah’ come from some distant voice, but his brain was already preparing dreams in his practically unconscious state. It only took a few seconds for him to fully give in to what his body begged for.

And he slipped right into sleep.

\- - - - -

His eyes shot open, revealing nothing but dark gray metal above him. It was a familiar sight—the underside of the top bunk he woke up to… some nights. He’d been sleeping in Shar’s bed a lot recently, huh?

He shrugged off the groggy thought. He felt like shit; a dry mouth, complete exhaustion, and a total loss of time toyed with him. The lights were still on in the room and he wasn’t even fully under his blanket…

But that wasn’t everything he felt. A weight other than cloth laid over his left arm, drawing him to lazily rotate his head to… Blackness. No, that wasn’t quite right… It was black hair, and if he craned his neck enough… He saw a white complexion, a black tank top, and a whole lot of cleava—

Ah. Tracy. That made sense. He swiftly averted his gaze elsewhere, finding anything else to focus on. She had her arms wrapped around his, her face nuzzled into his shoulder.

Wait… No. None of that made sense. Tracy? He blinked several times, resisting the urge to rub his eyes. Why… Why anything? Why was she in his bed? Why was he in the bunk room? What was he doing before? What goddamn time was it?

Last he remembered, he was struggling to write some notes over some wall material and composition articles that Sebas had brought up for him to study, but his headache prevented him from… *His migraine.* It was *gone*!

Harrison thought back a little harder, connecting the dots of events he recounted. Right, Tracy offered to help him with his problem after he’d practically run out of other solutions. Well, he’ll be damned! Her method actually worked. He’d have to thank her when she woke up.

The engineer squinted at his technically uninvited bed addition, subtly putting distance between the back of his palm and her warm, exposed midriff. She must’ve fallen asleep sometime after he did. Did she drag him back to the barracks when he went under first? No, that wouldn’t be feasible. Not because she couldn’t do it—it would take a hell of a lot of effort to, though—but she wasn’t the type to really bother. Shar was, which he couldn’t confirm was the actual culprit, but that still brought another dozen questions to his mind.

…Questions he really didn’t want to bother with. He just lost a completely unknown amount of time doing absolutely nothing… He stared up at the ceiling in thought. Was it really losing time? His headache was completely gone, so it couldn’t have been a total loss, right? God, his mind was too foggy after waking up.

He shook his head and looked back down at Tracy, wondering how the hell he was going to untangle himself from the attached woman. She just helped him get over some of the worst pain he’d ever been in—and he has had some particularly dire experiences with agony recently—so some part of him would feel like shit for ruining her sleep. And, as perplexing as her presence in his bed was, he could hardly find himself upset by it. The only real worry on his mind was that he was now being unproductive.

He scowled, patting himself down with his unanchored arm for his data pad to no success. His hand snaked down the side of the bunk to hopefully locate the device or at least the rig he held it in. Nothing… Nothing… Nothi—Ah! Something! Wait… Nope, those were his shoes. Whoever brought him to the barracks must’ve been pretty meticulous in seeing to him going to sleep well.

Fuck it. If he couldn’t work using his data pad, he might as well see if he could leave. His slow sigh filled the air, his eyes trained on the arms wrapped around his bicep. They were loose—enough for him to slip out of. So, with a few deft movements, he did just that. He had to weasel his way out using all his limbs in a delicate manner—especially around her chest— managing to just slip his forearm riiight out, and—

Hot skin gripped his fingers just as they were about to escape, a quiet ‘mmmm?’ coming from the sleeping technician. Shit. It was clear she was still asleep for the most part, so he gently slipped his hand out of her grasp. She sleepily reached out for his missing limb, letting out another groggy high-pitched hum as she attempted to pull his hand back. The motion forced him to really take in the scene. He sort of ignored it all in his groggy state, but it suddenly hit him.

Her clothing hung loosely on her lithe frame, her long eyelashes brushing against his skin as she tried to snuggle into what little contact she was searching for until he got his hand clear. She mewled in dissatisfaction, her warm breaths slowing as she settled. He was tempted to reach out and brush aside the hair resting over her face, a bemused smile of appreciation coloring his gaze. The idiot was supposed to be programming the rest of the armed harpies, yet here she was dozing.

…It *was* comfortable, though. He could already feel the reassuring warmth bleeding off as the cooler temperature sapped his body heat. And she was rather soft, which made it all an all too alluring idea to lay back down…

He clenched his teeth and turned away in a snap of clarity. God, he was dumb sometimes. There was way too much to catch up on to be letting anything other than his fully conscious brain do the thinking. He grabbed his boots and his things laid out nearby—something Shar has definitely done before for him in similar situations—and left without a word. He wouldn’t forget to thank the technician when she woke up.

\= = = = =

Water dripped from the sharp stones above the carpenter. Heavy footsteps and even heavier breaths echoed between each ‘*plip*’ of the liquid. The cave was as dark as an overcast night, the spelunkers’ flashlights almost blinding in comparison, the glare reflecting harshly against the moist rock. The sage-colored female never thought she would be subject to such an environment, yet here she found herself, far under even the foot of the Grand Mountain.

Her exhalations were shaky, her eyes constantly darting to shadows between the miners’ headlamps and handheld flashlights. She should have stayed on the lumber team… It was foolish for her to blindly follow the respected Rook into this damp abyss. The strength of her Head Harvester had inspired the carpenter to make a half-witted decision that not even a Cycle-worshiper would make.

She could not leave this place, for there was a goal beyond the ominous dark expanse. This was no routine venture for sphalerite; it was an expedition to uncover the treasures within Ershah. 

The five pathfinders went further into the cold stone, past the shining minerals, marking their paths and chipping at the walls as they explored. There was an elaborate method and numbering system put in place by the Creator for labeling and marking the stone, but it went over the carpenter’s head. Her task was simple in comparison—she was a porter of equipment.

The sage-colored female stopped with the group when Rook held up a hand, signaling the others to cease their movement. All flashlights converged just below her eyes, sparing her from blindness. Her intent was as deep as her tone was professional. *“The path steepens. Prepare drill ropes.”*

The porter stopped and inhaled sharply, dreading the action before her. She hesitantly reached around her back, gripping the cold steel instrument. The Creator’s equipment was wonderful, but this one… Her tail tensed at the thought. Repelling down cave walls was *not* something she was born for.

…But it was something she must do. If not for those counting on her labor, then for her own merit. Who was she, a mating-age female, to be afraid of menial things such as cave exploring? She had the tools of a diety-sent to see her through.

A loud humming echoed through the walls, followed by an ear-flattening ‘*thunk*.’ The carpenter’s eyes flicked toward the noise, drawing her attention to the drill rope firmly embedded into the ground just before the drop-off—it was Rook’s. The Head Harvester unraveled the attached twine, tugging on it twice before fearlessly stepping over the steep edge and descending. It took only a moment before she disappeared.

May the Lord of the Mountain give her courage. One by one, the others launched their drill tips into the ground and rappelled down, leaving just her at the top.

She hissed and followed suit, feeling the moderate recoil of the star-sent’s tool before doing her own tests of the rope and its connection to a karabiner on her waist rig. And that was it. She was ready to descend. She had done it twice before now; this would be no different. No time to think, just… *fall*!

Her stomach flew into her throat for but a split moment before her foot hit the frigid stone wall, her Malkrin-tailored ‘boots’ being the only thing giving her traction on the wet surface. First part down. Now to slowly let herself lower, one motion at a time. She did her best not to stare down into the black abyss beneath herself. Her rapid breaths and heavy heartbeats failed to slow down, every palm she let go from the rope seemed to hitch both at the same time.

Then she was on the flat floor below. The comforting illuminance of the other’s lamps calmed her, reminding her she was not alone in the dark depths. She untied herself and looked around. The various flashlights failed to reveal the far walls of what was now obviously a cavernously large room. Sheer darkness stretched on, its presence only cut by the shine of her sisters’ lights on the nearby floor. A bout of nervousness sunk into her frills at the sight. It was no different from staring down into the depths of the deep dark oceans, wondering what nightmares existed just out of sight.

She vigorously shook her head. Those were foolish thoughts of a pup. Just because she was not accustomed to the land below did not mean she needed to fear the darkness. There was nothing she could not deal with. Not even the much-feared ‘abhorrent’ were to be worried about, given the war parties’ successes. They were mere bottom feeders, right?

Their group leader clicked her tongue twice, motioning with two hands to continue forward. The others gave no hesitation, stepping into the tenebrous expanse. They were like floodlights in the night amongst the black, paving their way through it, drifting further and further…

*“Carpenter!”* a miner called out, her flashlight almost blinding the sage-colored female. *“Come forth. Do not be left behind.”*

The nervous Malkrin nodded once, catching up as fast as she could. Her unease flared at the thought of being left alone, her lower hands trembling all the while. She held the straps of her backpack a little tighter to hide the shaking. She had to persevere through the cold, alien, and unnerving world beneath the pink grass. They had many tasks to complete before returning. The ground and sharp walls had a unique hue of orange and green compared to the prior grays and tans. The sight sparked several stops to take pieces of each new texture or color, making sure to mark each one with the Creator’s specifications.

The carpenter stood around whilst the experienced females worked, taking out whatever equipment they needed from her pack. Otherwise, her attention was given to the suffocating darkness. Her mind loved to play tricks on her with the eerie ‘*clicks*’ and ‘*plips*’ that echoed throughout the cave. Water dripped and winds hummed all around her like the intent of the damned.

But the group still continued, unfazed by the unsettling ambiance. They bounced from wall to wall, inspecting each unique corner of the massive cave, slowly traversing what must have been thousands of paces. Its expanse was as impressive as it was worrisome. It changed and melded as they went, taking slight declines or wide turns.

One rotation about a large wall brought the five explorers into something… *new*. There was a shorter passageway that jutted under rock archways, slowly raising the pungent smell of… She could not quite place what it was, but it gained strength as the explorers pushed forward. It was familiar yet entirely foreign all at once, only becoming clear when five settlers crossed into another abyss that their flashlights failed to pierce, the glare only illuminating faint wisps of cold air, leaving them to stand at the edge of the void with stifled breaths.

She finally understood what the scent was. It was the sickly smell of rot and the suffocating aroma of one’s retching. The situation gave even Rook pause as she tensed up, her stance lowering. A strike of fear cut through the carpenter’s spine. Was there perhaps some dead animal dragged into the cavern? Was this a predator’s den? W-What would live in such a place?

Faint ‘*clicks*’ echoed through the cave, the choking silence elsewhere becoming unbearable as not even the Malkrin wished to break it. Movement out of the corner of her eye caught her attention. Rook slid an item from her waist rig pocket.

*“High Harvester, what are you doing?”* one of the miners projected, their intent quiet yet urgent.

The orange-skinned female brought up what was obviously a flare, holding another hand in the air. *“Preparation and information is half the battle. Prepare your flares, affix bayonets—”* She glared back at the others with stern confidence. *“—and ready your rigs with **extra** ammunition.”*

Ammunition? B-Battle? Certainly t-there was no such threat, no? The others worked swiftly to do as asked while the carpenter fumbled with her equipment, shaky hands making sluggish work. The polymer UKM grip felt cold in her palm, the barrel rattling ever so slightly with her jitters. The flare in her other hand felt heavy, almost like it would slip out of her grasp at any moment. Her body understood what its activation entailed. She would know what resided within the abyss soon, whether she acted on it or not.

The group shuffled back into the pseudo-mouth of the cave, beneath a rock archway. Some of the miners reached into her pack and added additional boxes of ammunition to their already cluttered rigs, followed by the sounds of several racked bolts and the clicks of safeties being turned off.

They had practiced this before… this very same defensive doctrine… just not underground and certainly not with the constraint of pitch-black darkness. The flares would have to make up for what their headlamps lacked—distance. They stood shoulder to shoulder, barrels sticking out like pikes, nerves tense like taut twine.

*“Find your angle. Launch flares on my mark,”* the High Harvester ordered, angling her flare out in front of her like a banner of war.

It was all too sudden for the carpenter. No time had passed at all. She still needed time t-to prepare o-or to ready her mind or something! Her trembling hand barely prepared the flare for launch, her arms merely copying her battle-sisters’ motions. She looked closer to her side, studying the others’ motions through her anxious breaths. They were… also shaking. Was she just seeing things, or was she perhaps not alone in—

Rook brought her hand forward in a directing chop. Several ‘*pops*’ echoed out immediately after, the carpenter’s own flare firing as a result of the sudden shock. She was given no time to react, her eyes already tracing the five streaks of light barreling down the long cave. Some went low, others went high, forcing her to get a look at… *everything*.

The red orbs of light illuminated small sections of the floor and ceiling, revealing nothing but vermilion-colored rock. The ground was littered with moist, oval-like stones in between long groups of both knobby and sharp growths that resembled anything from mangled stalagmites to organic boxwork veins. The ceilings were similar, sans the circular formations.

The carpenter was relieved, her breath almost taken out of her from the sudden weight disintegrating off of her shoulders. The sight of an extended cave rather than any vicious predator felt like the mountain’s peak, despite her prior fear of the underground. Perhaps after noting the new addition of the path, the team might simply return after collecting so much—

***Click***.

All five explorers stiffened.

*Click…Crack… Click…Crack Click Click ClickClickClick **ClickClickClickCrackClickClickCrack***.

Foreboding red illumination outlined a sea of movement across the ceiling and floor of the vast cavern in front of her. Pieces of the rock broke, jutting out in sudden movements, sharp limbs breaking free of their stone imprisonment. The walls came alive in the thousands, crawling creatures of nightmares exiting their slumber with echoing cracks. Their footsteps resounded like thousands of ‘*tinks*’ against the stone.

The very cave crept right toward *her*, gaining in speed by the moment.

*“Abhorrent! Fire away!”* Rook yelled

 T-These were the abhorrent? May the Mountain Lord protect her…

Flashes of light burned into her eyes as the roar of staccato gunfire sprayed indiscriminately into the approaching horde, snapping the carpenter out of her wide-eyed terror. Monster-shaped stones fell from the ceiling with hefty crunches, fifty and thirty-caliber bullets ripping chunks from their vile bodies.

She yanked the trigger back of her own UKM. Recoil dragged the barrel in wide jumps, the metallic beast gnashing against her hand’s hold, fighting for star-sent superiority over her strength. A haze of red light scantly illuminated the thousands above and below the smoky flares, leaving her wide eyes to dart from one target to another through the darkness. The odd missed tracer round bouncing off a black wall was all she was given for the shape of the cave, the rest left to imagination of its depths.

The beasts had yet to reach where their headlamps illuminated, but that did not stop her from slowly stepping back. T-There was too many to deal with. Her weapon tore through many, but *not enough*. Her sisters did much the same in her peripheral vision.

Gunfire and growls echoed in the stony abyss, the building haze of ignited gunpowder obscuring visibility. The cacophony of noises and visual attacks only added to the chaos. Red flares created faint backdrops that silhouetted the approaching horde, outlining a sea of scrambling limbs getting closer and closer. Their weapon-mounted flashlights began to illuminate the head of the wave. Gnawing stony teeth and rock-laden legs charged through the darkness toward them. A hail of bullets fought directly against the surging swarm, forging a battle of sheer force, but the Malkrin were *losing*. 

Backstep after backstep, they barely made any distance away from the gnashing maws of the abhorrent. Every cry of ‘reloading!’ sparked a rush of creatures through the crippled defense. Every subsequent racking of a bolt was prefaced with a yell of ‘GRENADE!,’ followed by hunks of carapace soaring through the air in a cacophonous boom that rattled bone and minds alike. Steel barrels steamed under heat burning away at the air’s moisture.

Beasts crawled along the walls, fiery explosives sent groups of them flying into the air, and napalm slowly brightened the smoked-out cave. It was a nightmare born just as the Texts of Origin regaled. Fire and brimstone raged across the visible plains of stone and dust. Roars of defiance and terror melded with the screeches of hellish monsters. S-She was no warrior; she was a mere carpenter! The unfolding terror of the unending horde suffocated her more and more. The sight was so far departed from reality, yet the burning blood within her veins and the sting of recoil bruises told her otherwise. Her vision grew into a mere tunnel of what was in front of her, legs retracing previous steps through the cavern in a stalwart yet desperate bid to escape the growing swarm.

Some Malkrin would trip over unseen rocks with their attention wholly focused on the conflict, yet a nearby sister was always prepared to pull them to their feet; some ran out of rig ammunition, yet a nearby backpack was always prepared with an excess; some abhorrent got a little too close, yet a thickened steel bayonet was always prepared to render it *lifeless*. Their teamwork melded into desperation, each fighting tooth and talon for the others’ weapon to come to life. Every machine gun not firing only inspired the gnashing maws across from them more.

The battle raged on in the orange fire-lit pit of the damned with no end in sight. Their backs were pressed tightly against the very slope they descended, dangling drill-ropes beside them swaying under the heat and pressure sizzling off of red-hot barrels.

There was only one direction left to go. There was no time to tie knots, only enough to grab on and ascend. Automatic winches pulled the lines of descent up, gradually carrying the clinging females up the wall. It was no faster than their *walking* stride. Frigid shivers ran up her frills at the sight of creatures tearing up the surface behind them, practically nipping at their feet. Inaccurate fire tore them off, their bodies falling down into the abyss below as several others replaced their fallen comrade immediately.

The carpenter felt nothing and everything all at once. Her body was aflame in courage and terror. Her muscles strained to hold onto the rope. Her mind screamed at the mangle-tooth maws just beneath her. Every second along of ascension drew on longer than the last, deafening cracks of her firearm just *barely* keeping them at bay. Muzzle flashes sparked every horrid detail of the rock beasts, from their blood-covered exteriors to the vile green innards exploding from high-powered bullets. The flare of ignited gunpowder illuminated the open jaws of a beast dashing right toward—

A painful pressure flared from her dangling foot, a crushing sensation ripping through her sabatons. She screamed, letting a flurry of shots down at the creature actively pulling her into the maws of the rest. It fell in a blaze of gunfire, but another took its place. Powerful jaws sunk into the metal of her calf. The winch whined under the additional strain. Vile beasts dashed toward her as if smelling the blood in the water. She was immobile, *surrounded*.

Agony tore up her leg as others latched on, shaking their heads side to side as if to rip whole chunks of her flesh. Her guttural shouts and growls became ringing in her ears, pumping blood drowning everything out as she wildly jabbed her bayonet through shell after shell of the swarming monsters. Her finger never let go of the trigger until there was nothing left but a deadened, tactile ‘*clicks*.’

She snarled widely, fighting with all her strength, but they just kept *coming*. Cold blood flowed out of her leg at alarming speeds, chunks of her armor’s metal now embedded into her flesh under the pressure. She was powerless, weakened, and weaponless. Her grip lost its strength, failing to hold onto the rope.

A forceful yank nearly sealed her falling fate, but her last bout of vigor kept her attached. Her arms were gripped and pulled over the final ledge. Battle sisters slaughtered the beasts attached to her while the others dragged her further into the cave. She could barely stand to keep up. Another wrapped an arm around her back and assisted her mangled leg. It was slow… too slow, but she continued. Her sisters needed every rifle.

*“Reloading!”* she called out with withering intent, throwing the empty box onto the ground and preparing another.

Pain bounced around her entire body. Her eyes were blurry with tears. The weapon in her hand singed her palms.

But she continued. Darkness crept from her peripherals, the faintest flashes of her weapon illuminating anything beyond the blurry shadows.

Her sisters needed her.

Costco beans probably will not give the YouTube Instagram like espresso shots that you are thinking of. Good for price and works in milk based drinks. For just espresso or curiosity, try local roasters.

Hi everyone, I wanted to share my personal experience with some Costco beans and Breville. I have had my barista pro for 5 months now and I started my espresso journey with Costco beans (they are cheap so why not)

I tried every day to dial in my machine with the beans but simply couldn't. I tried multiple internal and external burr settings and barely got the Starbucks French roast to come close to correct extraction time but for Peet's decaf beans, my grinder gave up on me but I simply couldn't get it fine enough to get a good shot. It always flowed like Niagara waterfalls clocking 36 grams espresso in around 15-20 seconds. I started to wonder if I don't know how to make an espresso 😂 I still haven't been able to do it but I don't want to jam my grinder at this point for these beans.

Then I started experimenting with some local beans like Voyager, verve, barefoot, etc and I finally was able to make some good espresso. Perfect time, perfect cream, perfect flow. So anyone out there in the same boat, it's most definitely the beans if you have been trying for a while. This post doesn't mean that Costco beans are bad, they are really good for the price and for days when you only care about caffeine (in form of drinks, I don't drink them for just espresso shot). All the local roster coffee beans are at least 3 times more expensive for me. Once you try local roasters, it's hard to go back though. ",2,1731257910.0,espresso,4,1.0,False

Now we have to talk about the tree. The tree is officially known as the Founder’s Tree in the town’s records. The old story goes that in 1666 when Glory Point was founded, the puritan colonist Buford Spry planted a tree. This would become the center of town and the main tourist attraction in  the town’s square. 


The tree itself does not look like much at first glance. It’s an old half dead willow tree about three stories high. It’s never had leaves, it’s never looked healthy and somehow it’s never died. Just by looking at it you can see why kids might make stories from it. It looks like something from a scary old ghost story. However it’s much more than that. The tree is known by the inhabitants of town as the Hanging Tree, and the fruit of the Hanging Tree is nightmares. 


There is no easy place to start so I’ll just share the information I got from the library first. In those days it was still kinda fun. Even without my brother I felt like I was paying tribute to him and keeping his stories alive. 
Here are some headlines and context that for some reason, never seemed to make the news. 


December 14th 2002: Three Hispanic Men later linked with sex trafficking and coyote work were hung from a tree at the Center of Glory Point. Signs of a struggle as they clawed at their necks and had unknown skin and blood samples under their fingernails.
What did not make the news was that starting 


January of 2003 Glory Point High had several reports of men with bulging red eyes and dark red rope burns on their necks were spotted in the showers after a cheer team tryout.


From August onward that shower became the center of many new ghost stories. My brother received out of school suspension for spreading the rumor that it was Principal Spry, Mayor Spry and then Chief Baxter astral projecting to spy on new sacrifices. It was one of his least popular stories but I always got a kick out of it.


June 8th 1993: Julia and Oscar Louder- an older couple at Spry Retirement Home- are found hung at the tree while also having purposely ingested several morphine pills. The coroner reported that they did not suffer and most likely died instantly when their necks snapped.


The Glory Point Gazette (The GPG for  short) did not report that during that same Summer the Spry Retirement Home Inhabitants and staff all gossiped about seeing the same couple dancing together in the Bingo Hall with the grace they had in their 30s. 


June 8th 1995: The GPG make an inspirational post about a local troubled teen resident being saved from suicide by hanging on the tree by local police.
What the GPG did not report was that that same kid talked for decades that an older couple with bright smiling faces and rope burns around their neck had taken him down. 


October 31st 1971: The GPG report the  first Halloween Massacre. 31 non-residents were found hanging from the tree. All of the corpses were reported to have been skinned alive as there were signs of struggle and thrashing on the exposed raw skin below as they hung. Each flayed person was wrapped in archetypal Halloween costumes such as witches, vampires, werewolves, mummies etc. 


It was reported in various small newspapers throughout the US as well as a small article in the Washington Post that 12 of those corpses were found connected to various disappearances across the nation. Evidence found on the corpses opened several cold cases tying them bodies to serial killers that were never caught. 5 more had their homes investigated and there were several buried bodies, under each home. 1 of the 5 had a living victim still alive in their basement who had been severely tortured. The chief torture among them being flaying of the skin of the hands and feet. The others had nothing connected to them.


My brother had a field day with this one. The Halloween Massacre was a common horror story amongst Glory Point inhabitants. Each of the 31 is meant to haunt a certain day of the month of October. Each has their own ritual and superstition attached them such as The Mummy. In that case unless someone dresses up in a mummy costume stays next to the tree from 6pm to 12am on October 1st The Mummy will kill one child in town. The story comes from him being a known child killer after his death who gets one chance a year to have his fun again. 


October 31st 1976 the GPG had a report that 2 teenagers were arrested for disturbing the peace while high on acid during a a Halloween concert near the center of town. 
What did not make the Gazette but only traveled through tall tales and ghost stories is that what they saw that night was 31 corpses, dripping with blood. They were clawing at their nooses and making choking gasps while hanging from the tree. 


February 19th 1896 3 black men were found castrated, covered in tar and flour and hung from the tree. A group of 7 members of the Ku Klux Klan were charged with the crime and subsequently acquitted by the jury. On April of the same year The GPG reported that the infamous defendants of that case were all found castrated, covered in boiling tar with their hoods covering their heads. 


My mother had a story about this case. She was a storyteller too, just quieter than my brother. When she had a story to tell there was a quiet dignity to her that made everyone listen in. My brother was a showman while her stories felt more like an intimate confession. 
Hers was only one of a few black families that lived in Glory Point in 1974. 


The people there were nice and inviting but she would sometimes feel out of place. As she got older she struggled with depression (another trait she shared with my brother). Towards her senior year the stress of staying or leaving made her try self harm on many occasions. (My mother never shied away from dark topics or her own struggles. She wanted us to have the tools and language to deal with our own demons).  


She’d gone to the hanging tree then and she’d almost done what couldn’t be taken back. As she was about to kick the ladder from under her she saw below her the Klansmen. Their blood shot eyes bulged from their white hoods. The shimmery tar covering their skin glistened  white in the moonlight. The eyes looked so hungry. In her panic she slipped from the ladder and began thrashing. She’d kicked the ladder by accident then. 
She always had to pause at this part. I remember her clenching her mug of coffee so hard that her knuckles turned white. 


But she preserved. She said then she felt so much regret that the feeling felt more suffocating than the noose she’d tied around her neck. Worse than that was them. She felt their hands all over her body then. As her vision grew darker and darker she could feel their touch go from a caress to feeling like they were trying to pull the skin from her.

She understood then that she’d made a mistake. She’d sent herself for her and had no way out. It all grew black then until she opened her eyes. Then she looked up for the first time at my father. He had been crying and was in shock when she saw she was up. The tree was what got my parents together in the first place. The tree is what starts every story in Glory Point. 

The hanging tree is the center of every ghost story in this town. Every legend, tall tale and nightmare was carved from the wood of that tree. But what is the tree really? Why did the heart of my hometown curse it this way? 

The answers are there. But we have to take this slowly, one step at a time. It’s the only way you’ll believe it. It’s the only reason I can. Next, we have to discuss what really happened during the Halloween Massacre, and The Man Who Stole Vengeance from God.

So, there’s this study called ""The Effects of Massage Therapy on Chronic Lateral Knee Pain in a Patient with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome"" by, you guessed it, Natalie A. Delange. Published back in 2018—feels like just yesterday!—this case study dives into one patient’s experience managing knee pain, which is like a persistent roommate you can’t get rid of, just awful if you ask me. It’s kind of remarkable really, how this individual with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (what a mouthful, right?) navigates their world of chronic pain with a gentle approach through massage therapy.

So, what’s Ehlers-Danlos syndrome? Honestly, it's a bit of a mixed bag of connective tissue issues that result in joint hypermobility, especially—hey, I mean, that's fancy talk for “crazy flexible joints!” In this case, those joints are causing instability, pain, and all-around frustration, particularly with the knees. If you’ve ever dealt with knee pain, you know how frustrating that can be—like trying to walk with a pebble in your shoe, only way worse.

This study? It’s solid, based on good observations. But, let’s be real, it’s just one patient, so it raises eyebrows about how much we can generalize. Think of it like trying to judge an entire restaurant (or, ya know, a new Netflix series) based on just one dish—definitely leaves you with more questions than answers, huh? Anyway, here’s the scoop.

### **What We Can Learn About EDS and Knee Pain**

Ehlers-Danlos, or EDS, can be quite the handful—joint pain, skin that stretches too much, and other tissue issues that would probably have you rethinking any extreme sports. And chronic knee pain? Ugh, that’s a real challenge in the EDS community, right? Repetitive strains on weakened tissues can wear the body down even more. Imagine wearing out your favorite cozy slippers—eventually, the support is just gone, leaving you wishing for more comfort.

But hey, massage therapy? It’s a non-invasive, cushy approach that just might help hard-to-reach spots without twisting anything too sharply. That’s sort of what this study explores—could massage actually make this patient’s quality of life better?

### **The Good Stuff from the Study**

***Pain Reduction*** This patient breathed a sigh of relief! After several sessions of massage therapy, they noticed the pain in their knee had decreased significantly. Like, who wouldn't want that? Daily activities felt more doable, though, here’s the catch—this relief didn’t stick around forever. It’s more like slapping a Band-Aid on a situation that still needs some serious healing.

***Mobility and Joint Stability*** Ahh, the sweet relief of being able to move better. Massage appeared to chill out those tight muscles around the knee, which is pretty sweet—but sadly, it didn’t stop the joint dislocations. It’s like wearing a raincoat in a storm; it’ll help a little, but it won't shield you from everything.

***Emotional Perks*** And can we talk about stress for a minute? It’s like an unwelcome guest at a party—ever-present and super annoying. The patient said massage helped ease their mental load too, giving them a brighter outlook alongside physical relief. It’s wildly fascinating how mind and body connect like long-lost pals reconnecting over coffee.

***But Here’s the Rub—Temporary Relief*** So, the comfort didn’t last long; it’s like that fleeting moment right before you wake up from a great dream. The relief was short-lived, spanning just a few hours—maybe a couple of days? This points to massage therapy as more of a quick fix instead of a magic bullet.

### **What Could Be Improved?**

While there’s lots to chew on here, let’s not ignore the glaring gaps.

*   ***Sample Size*** Only one patient, really? I mean, it’s like judging a book by its cover without actually reading it. To solidify the findings, future research could include more EDS patients with similar symptoms—more voices in the conversation, you know?
*   ***Control Group*** Can’t really go around saying massage alone did the trick when you don’t have a control group to compare it against. A little standard care or a placebo, perhaps, could lend some credence to the results.
*   ***Long-Term Follow-Up*** What’s the deal with long-term benefits? It wasn’t mentioned in the study, which leaves a big question mark hanging. A follow-up after a few months or years would be useful—does it wear off?
*   ***Standardized Measurements*** Self-reported improvements, while valuable, don’t give the whole picture. Using tangible measures would help quantify improvements, making findings more trustworthy—hard numbers tell a clearer story, right?
*   ***Massage Protocol*** Details, details! How long were massages? What techniques did they use? A clear protocol might help replicate these results, allowing other therapists to get in on the action.
*   ***Comparison with Other Treatments*** Context is everything. How does good ol' massage stack up against, say, physical therapy or bracing? A dash of comparison could really illustrate where massage fits in the treatment puzzle.
*   ***Potential Risks*** It’s a delicate dance when it comes to EDS. Tissues are like fine china, easily breakable. Is massage therapy even safe? Addressing potential risks is just essential here.
*   ***Therapist Expertise*** What about the skills of the therapist? Having someone who understands EDS could totally change the game—improper techniques could be a recipe for disaster.
*   ***Multidisciplinary Approach*** Lastly, slap massage therapy into the mix alongside other treatments—why not? A combined approach might be the secret sauce to better patient outcomes.

### **Widening Our Perspective on EDS Management**

All said and done, even with its limitations, this case study hints that massage therapy might be a shining star in the constellation of pain management for EDS patients. No invasive procedures or medications—just a gentle push toward relief, which is pretty appealing to those wary of pharmaceuticals. It’d be wise though—EDS patients ought to chat with a healthcare pro before diving into something new. Personalized plans? Definitely the way to go for ensuring a safe journey through massage therapy.

**Final Thoughts** Delange’s study sheds light on the possibility of massage therapy as a potential ally against chronic knee pain for EDS patients. While the findings are optimistic, remember: it’s not the silver bullet. A more extensive range of studies, with large groups, controls, and all that jazz, would help paint a fuller picture of massage’s role in managing EDS-related pain.

This study really emphasizes how a gentler, tailored approach might usher in a world of comfort for EDS patients, whether physically or emotionally. Some relief and a bit of warmth in everyday life? Sounds like a win to me!

Now we have to talk about the tree. The tree is officially known as the Founder’s Tree in the town’s records. The old story goes that in 1666 when Glory Point was founded, the puritan colonist Buford Spry planted a tree. This would become the center of town and the main tourist attraction in  the town’s square. 


The tree itself does not look like much at first glance. It’s an old half dead willow tree about three stories high. It’s never had leaves, it’s never looked healthy and somehow it’s never died. Just by looking at it you can see why kids might make stories from it. It looks like something from a scary old ghost story. However it’s much more than that. The tree is known by the inhabitants of town as the Hanging Tree, and the fruit of the Hanging Tree is nightmares. 


There is no easy place to start so I’ll just share the information I got from the library first. In those days it was still kinda fun. Even without my brother I felt like I was paying tribute to him and keeping his stories alive. 
Here are some headlines and context that for some reason, never seemed to make the news. 


December 14th 2002: Three Hispanic Men later linked with sex trafficking and coyote work were hung from a tree at the Center of Glory Point. Signs of a struggle as they clawed at their necks and had unknown skin and blood samples under their fingernails.
What did not make the news was that starting 


January of 2003 Glory Point High had several reports of men with bulging red eyes and dark red rope burns on their necks were spotted in the showers after a cheer team tryout.


From August onward that shower became the center of many new ghost stories. My brother received out of school suspension for spreading the rumor that it was Principal Spry, Mayor Spry and then Chief Baxter astral projecting to spy on new sacrifices. It was one of his least popular stories but I always got a kick out of it.


June 8th 1993: Julia and Oscar Louder- an older couple at Spry Retirement Home- are found hung at the tree while also having purposely ingested several morphine pills. The coroner reported that they did not suffer and most likely died instantly when their necks snapped.


The Glory Point Gazette (The GPG for  short) did not report that during that same Summer the Spry Retirement Home Inhabitants and staff all gossiped about seeing the same couple dancing together in the Bingo Hall with the grace they had in their 30s. 


June 8th 1995: The GPG make an inspirational post about a local troubled teen resident being saved from suicide by hanging on the tree by local police.
What the GPG did not report was that that same kid talked for decades that an older couple with bright smiling faces and rope burns around their neck had taken him down. 


October 31st 1971: The GPG report the  first Halloween Massacre. 31 non-residents were found hanging from the tree. All of the corpses were reported to have been skinned alive as there were signs of struggle and thrashing on the exposed raw skin below as they hung. Each flayed person was wrapped in archetypal Halloween costumes such as witches, vampires, werewolves, mummies etc. 


It was reported in various small newspapers throughout the US as well as a small article in the Washington Post that 12 of those corpses were found connected to various disappearances across the nation. Evidence found on the corpses opened several cold cases tying them bodies to serial killers that were never caught. 5 more had their homes investigated and there were several buried bodies, under each home. 1 of the 5 had a living victim still alive in their basement who had been severely tortured. The chief torture among them being flaying of the skin of the hands and feet. The others had nothing connected to them.


My brother had a field day with this one. The Halloween Massacre was a common horror story amongst Glory Point inhabitants. Each of the 31 is meant to haunt a certain day of the month of October. Each has their own ritual and superstition attached them such as The Mummy. In that case unless someone dresses up in a mummy costume stays next to the tree from 6pm to 12am on October 1st The Mummy will kill one child in town. The story comes from him being a known child killer after his death who gets one chance a year to have his fun again. 


October 31st 1976 the GPG had a report that 2 teenagers were arrested for disturbing the peace while high on acid during a a Halloween concert near the center of town. 
What did not make the Gazette but only traveled through tall tales and ghost stories is that what they saw that night was 31 corpses, dripping with blood. They were clawing at their nooses and making choking gasps while hanging from the tree. 


February 19th 1896 3 black men were found castrated, covered in tar and flour and hung from the tree. A group of 7 members of the Ku Klux Klan were charged with the crime and subsequently acquitted by the jury. On April of the same year The GPG reported that the infamous defendants of that case were all found castrated, covered in boiling tar with their hoods covering their heads. 


My mother had a story about this case. She was a storyteller too, just quieter than my brother. When she had a story to tell there was a quiet dignity to her that made everyone listen in. My brother was a showman while her stories felt more like an intimate confession. 
Hers was only one of a few black families that lived in Glory Point in 1974. 


The people there were nice and inviting but she would sometimes feel out of place. As she got older she struggled with depression (another trait she shared with my brother). Towards her senior year the stress of staying or leaving made her try self harm on many occasions. (My mother never shied away from dark topics or her own struggles. She wanted us to have the tools and language to deal with our own demons).  


She’d gone to the hanging tree then and she’d almost done what couldn’t be taken back. As she was about to kick the ladder from under her she saw below her the Klansmen. Their blood shot eyes bulged from their white hoods. The shimmery tar covering their skin glistened  white in the moonlight. The eyes looked so hungry. In her panic she slipped from the ladder and began thrashing. She’d kicked the ladder by accident then. 
She always had to pause at this part. I remember her clenching her mug of coffee so hard that her knuckles turned white. 


But she preserved. She said then she felt so much regret that the feeling felt more suffocating than the noose she’d tied around her neck. Worse than that was them. She felt their hands all over her body then. As her vision grew darker and darker she could feel their touch go from a caress to feeling like they were trying to pull the skin from her.

She understood then that she’d made a mistake. She’d sent herself for her and had no way out. It all grew black then until she opened her eyes. Then she looked up for the first time at my father. He had been crying and was in shock when she saw she was up. The tree was what got my parents together in the first place. The tree is what starts every story in Glory Point. 

The hanging tree is the center of every ghost story in this town. Every legend, tall tale and nightmare was carved from the wood of that tree. But what is the tree really? Why did the heart of my hometown curse it this way? 

The answers are there. But we have to take this slowly, one step at a time. It’s the only way you’ll believe it. It’s the only reason I can. Next, we have to discuss what really happened during the Halloween Massacre, and The Man Who Stole Vengeance from God.

I work in a small, local diner/coffee shop, and since it’s a neighborhood spot, we see a lot of the same faces over and over. There’s this one lady who’s in here pretty much every day — at least three times a week, and I only work four shifts a week. Every single time I serve her, she seems to go out of her way to make things awkward (I’m not the only one who’s noticed).

Today was a perfect example. She ordered a chai tea latte, which isn’t super common here. Just to clarify, none of us are barista-trained; we make “cappuccinos” and “lattes” by just adding espresso shots to steamed milk in mugs. Anyway, we offer both a chai spice tea and a chai latte, so I broke down the difference and asked which one she wanted. She replied with, “No, I don’t want coffee in it.” I explained that neither option has coffee, then showed her the chai concentrate and the tea bags. She pointed to the tea bag, so I went ahead and made her drink.

When I handed it to her, along with a couple of other items she ordered, she checked the drink and immediately complained that it wasn’t what she wanted. Apparently, she actually wanted the other option I’d already explained to her in detail. This kind of thing happens constantly with her, and it’s exhausting. Someone convince me she’s not doing it on purpose before I actually scream.

I'm a bit concerned as I've been querying since August and have had no personalized feedback.

Dear (blank),

 

I am seeking representation for my novel, *Splendid Thieves*, a Young Adult/Adult crossover, SFF adventure, complete at 93K. Blending elements of steampunk and a high-stakes heist, *Pirates of the Caribbean* meets *A Tempest of Tea* by *Hafsah Faizal* against the backdrop of India.

 

Five miscreants become sky-pirates to pull off an unlikely heist.

 

Born of two warring nations, outcast for her mixed heritage, Evie Spicer seeks refuge in a war-torn underworld, discovering a community of machine-infused invalids and malfunctioned Automatons – the Damned – with whom she finds the possibility of belonging.

 

But most view the Damned as technological mistakes and when Evie hears of plans to eradicate them, she vows to save them, no matter the cost. Operating a shady coffee den by day and smuggling the Damned out of the city by night, Evie is helpless when her only link to salvation disappears and her means to rescue the Damned with it.

 

With a rising body count and a relentless Privateer on her trail, hope rekindles when an old friend proposes a daring heist: retrieve the legendary Map of Nought, rumoured to possess a power that might save the Damned. All Evie must do is pose as Captain Metalwork’s hostage, the fearsome sky-pirate who once tried to kill her.

 

Flung into the deadly world of sky-piracy alongside four eccentric renegades, Evie races to find the map that could end an age of oppression… or ignite a new era of chaos.

 

(Blank), in your profile you mentioned enjoying gothic adventures, high stakes, worldbuilding and characters you would follow anywhere. I hope *Splendid Thieves* is a novel you’ll enjoy, full of morally grey characters and uncertain dangers in a gritty setting.

 

Thank you for your time.

 

Warm regards,

I wanted to share some practical tips to help you refresh your space and make it feel unique and inviting. Whether you’re redecorating a whole room or just looking for a small update, these tips can make a big impact!

# 1. Start with a Blank Canvas

Remove all decor items and then add things back with intention. Starting with an empty room helps you identify focal points and rethink layouts without distraction.

# 2. Focus on Function and Flow

Consider how you’ll use the space and how people will move through it. Keep high-traffic areas clear, and arrange furniture to make sure every seat has a purpose and a view.

# 3. Create a Mood Board

Look up styles on Pinterest or other sites and create a board to gather inspiration. This helps narrow down colors, styles, and textures you love, making it easier to build a cohesive look.

# 4. Choose a Focal Point

Identify a key feature (like a statement wall, large piece of art, or fireplace) and design the room around it. This draws the eye and makes the space feel intentional.

# 5. Mix Textures and Materials

Bring variety by mixing materials like metal, wood, glass, and fabrics. For example, if you have a wooden coffee table, consider adding metal accents or a soft rug to balance it out.

# 6. Use Artwork Wisely

If you have existing artwork, try to complement it with new decor that has similar colors or themes. Use different types of wall art – like mirrors, clocks, or sculptures – to add depth and avoid overwhelming the walls.

# 7. Pay Attention to Lighting

Good lighting makes a huge difference. Use a mix of lighting sources (overhead, task, and accent lighting) to create a warm, inviting atmosphere. Dimmers can be a great addition for mood control!

# 8. Consider Scale and Empty Space

Balance large items with smaller accents, and remember that not every surface needs decor. Leaving some areas empty can help create a clean, airy feel.

She was a secretary for a big important man, in a big important building, at a big important company. The job paid well but it wasn’t as interesting, or as sexy, as she had hoped. Somedays while scheduling meetings and writing emails, she daydreamed about working as a secretary to her fiancé and having him invite her to his office and locked the door behind them so no one would interrupt their “meeting”. He’d slide everything off his desk tossing her up onto it. He’d spread her legs and being pleasantly surprised she wasn’t wearing underwear under her short skirt, she never did around him. He’d have his way with her, devouring her pussy as she tried not to moan out so the office couldn’t hear. Their love would have been forbidden after all. Her real boss was not nearly as attractive, not even worth daydreaming about on her most boring days.

She held herself as a very professional woman, always on time, showing up with her hair in a bun and wearing a pencil skirt, she would make small talk to her coworkers around the coffee pot but never stayed too long as she always had some work she was supposed to be doing.

Martha was tired. Overworked and under fucked she’d joke to herself. She moved to the city to find excitement but found nothing but paperwork. While she had her fiancé, she always felt guilty because her work consumed so much of her energy that she was too tired to do much but sleep when she got home. She spent most of her days cooped up in the stuffy office all day, so she always enjoyed her lunch break. Not just as a break from the monotonous busy work that was expected of her, but as an excuse to get outside and get some air. Ironically it was only after starting work as a secretary in the city did, she learned to appreciate nature. She always looked forward to spending her time in a little park by the office.

It was a sunny day, but there was a chill in the air and a slight breeze made the autumn leaves dance on the trees. Despite the weather, she managed to stay warm. She took out a thermos of soup from her bag and felt at peace as she ate and watched the people stroll by on the path. She was more than enjoying herself until she noticed something, or rather someone, two little eyes peeking out from the bush. Everyone walked past and never seemed to notice, but under the brush, Martha could make out what looked like the face of a young girl. Martha put her soup back in her bag and took a few steps closer to the girl. She watched the face dart back into the darkness.

“It’s okay Hun, I’m not going to hurt you,” Martha said calmly, kneeling down and holding out a hand for the child, “Are you lost, where are your parents?”

A small hand poked out from the branches, beckoning Martha to follow.

Martha took the child’s hand and was led into the woods. The child was wearing a dirty tattered dress and looked to be shivering.

“Are you taking me to your parents?” Martha asked confused as to where they were going but still following the young girl. The girl said nothing and kept walking, holding Martha’s hand to lead her along.

Martha wasn’t sure where she expected to go, maybe a tent or makeshift shelter, never was she expecting the girl to take her out of the woods and lead her towards a furniture store.

“Are your parents in there?”

The child still gave no reply only tightened her grip on Martha’s hand as she marched into the store. Martha was exceptionally confused and worried about why the girl was leading her into a rather classy furniture store. People looked over their shoulders, trying not to make it obvious, but their stares pierced Martha to the core. She didn’t blame them, they were quite the odd sight to behold, a businesswoman being dragged by a dirty child through a fancy store would make anyone curious.

The child pulled her over to the section where all the beds were located, luckily there weren’t any people in this area yet. The girl found a large canopy bed and pushed Martha through the curtains with seemingly inhuman strength.

“What are you doing?” Martha asked with fear in her voice.

The child climbed up onto the bed and blinked, revealing fiery orange eyes like a cat, and a long-forked tongue spilled from the monster’s mouth. This was no innocent girl. Martha watched in horror as horns sprouted from the child’s head, her skin appeared to burn up, a tail grew from behind, and her shoes fell away to reveal a pair of cloven hoofs. The imp crawled up onto Martha’s chest and grabbed her hand, its long prehensile tongue wrapping around her finger, sliding her engagement ring off. It held the ring with its tongue, taunting her with it, before throwing its head back, tossing the ring into the air, catching it with its mouth, and gulping it down.

Martha gasped out in anguish at the sight of losing her ring. Martha tried to sit up some force seemed to be holding her down. The imp wagged a finger in her face as if to say no. She watched the little demon make its way down between her legs and up her skirt. She felt a new hole being torn in her leggings and the creature’s hot breath between her thighs. The imp begins kissing and licking her inner thighs as Martha struggles against the imp’s paranormal bondage.

Hot and wet she feels a tongue slip between the lips of her pussy, drawn like a magnet to her clit. The imp’s infernal tongue was hot and left a fiery tingling sensation on her clit that made her groan out and squirm. Martha managed to grab a pillow to pull over her face to quiet her moans, but it was little use. The imp wrapped its tongue around her clit and began to suck. The stimulation was so much and so intense, Martha bit down on the pillow trying not to cause a scene but she noticed silhouettes began to gather around the bed, looking inwards. The demon, being a devilish little creature listened to her moans and acted accordingly. Martha felt the imp begin to work its tongue in a pumping motion. The motion, the fiery tingly sensation, the suction, the imp had her exactly where it wanted and knew it. The imp wanted an audience.

Not being able to control herself, she howled out in ecstasy. Physically her body was overcome with pleasure, mentally, she was in horror as she watched one of the silhouettes grab and pull back the curtain, exposing her to the crowd that had gathered. The imp of course chose this time to double down on its sucking and licking. Martha’s legs shook uncontrollably as the creature brought her closer to the edge. She grabbed at the sheets, howling out in physical delight, the pillow doing nothing to quiet her. The crowd that had gathered watched on in horror, disgust, and arousal, or some mix depending on the individual. All, however, had their eyes glued to the scene before them, unable to look away.

Martha clawed at the bed, too overwhelmed with the sensations to even notice the ever-growing group of onlookers. The tiny demon between her legs was getting her so close, she could feel herself right on the brink of orgasmic bliss. But then nothing. The imp slowed its pace to nearly nothing just teasing her clit with the tip of its forked tongue. Mentally she came back to earth enough to understand what was going on around her and looked up at the crowd with nothing but embarrassment on her face. She felt the imp lift up her skirt, exposing her to the entire flock to see. The imp curled its tongue back into its wicked maw and lashed out at her, flogging her clit with its whiplike tongue. Martha cried out in pain and embarrassment, the sting of the whipping tongue pushing her to the brink of tears. She sobs out in a mix of pain and pleasure, so aroused she can barely comprehend the world around her. The demon began to lap at her pussy hungrily, causing any worry she had to melt away as a new feeling of ecstasy flowed through her. The intense stimulation, then nothing, then even more stimulation was torment. She continued to sob out unknowingly, her body wholly and entirely overstimulated.

The gathered crowd saw Martha lying there no longer, trying to silence herself with the pillow as it had proven useless. They watched as the little creature pleased her with its face under her skirt and its tail flicking about in delight. They were transfixed to the spot, unsure of if they should intervene or even if they could. However, with the sounds Martha was making she certainly sounded like she was enjoying herself.

And she certainly was enjoying herself. She kicked and screamed out, so, so, so, very close to orgasm but the little devil wouldn’t let her. Martha didn’t know how much more she could take. The pleasure, the edging, it was too much. She didn’t care about anything at all at that moment, she was floating in a sea of pain and pleasure, so desperate to cum. Finally, the imp let her. Martha’s legs shook uncontrollably. She clawed at the sheets trying to hang onto something as if this wave of pleasure that washed over her would pull her away. Her back arched as she thrust her hips in the air to try to lose the demon who kept sucking. She howled out, screaming to the whole store that she was in total orgasmic bliss. She lost what little control of her body she had left as she thrashed about on the bed crying out in delight.

She felt the little imp take its horned head out from under her skirt and heard its hoofs clomp across the floor as it ran out of the building. A man tried to help Martha to her feet, but her legs felt like Jello, and she collapsed back into his arms. She took a while to rest on the bed to regain her composure. Shockingly she didn’t feel particularly worried that the entire store watched her get eaten out by a demon, or that she had taken far too long of a break and was late for work. She relaxed on the bed still overcome with pleasure from the fiery little imp.",1,1731256954.0,Forest_Creature,0,1.0,False

Yuzhou waiting for so long, like an eternity, fell deep asleep. The Relaxation overwhelms him as the sun beaming down, his respirator calming his mind as he takes deep breaths. A faint voice calls him calming yet...

""Ayatan! AYATAN! **AYATAN!**"" Yelled a young boy

Yuzhou wakes up on the chair, the room dimmed where only light comes though a window. The floors polished and cleaned, the chair comfy where anyone can sleep on instantly.

""Ayatan, you gotta stop falling asleep in important meeting."" Said The young boy

""Kayden rights, wake up man maybe get some coffee."" Said another young boy staring out the window, his hair messy like he hasn't done hair in a while

""Speak about yourself Cosi, tidy up your hair will you"" 

""Oh yeah, let me do that know."" As Cosi leaves yawning.

""What is happening?"" Asked Yuzhou in a young melodic voice 

""Ayatan, the fair here monsters are believed to show up."" Replied Kayden. 

""And we're going right now."" a Voice coming from the door, a man with white hair and sunglasses peaks in. His hand waving at both of them. ""Get prepare yall.""

""We know that Sou-Sensei, you told us 10 minutes ago."" Said Kayden

""\*Chuckling\* well what if Ayatan didn't hear it"" Sou said as he entered the room, patting Yuzhou on the head.

""Alright then I'm going"" 

Kayden leaves through the door walking down the empty hall, the creaking of the floors that can be heard. Sou still patting Yuzhou's head starts to speak...

""So what did you dream this time, Ayatan?"" Sou asked, ""A time with food or a thirst for battle?"" 

""No, it was just nothing..."" Replied Yuzhou

""Alright then! Let's go going Ayatan, let me show you what a happy celebration looks like. So don't be sad be happy."" Said Sou ""So you one day can rest

He’s in the military and he just got back from his deployment like two days ago, and it was his longest one yet. The first night we spent all day together and it was great. But last night i went out with some of my friends, i wouldn’t usually go out right after we get reunited again but this was planned weeks prior. I left the house at 8 pm and i told him i’d be back around 11, but i reached home at around 12:40. My phone was dead so I couldn’t tell him I’d be home late. I unlocked the door and he was in the kitchen, i started to apologize for being late but I stopped when i saw the kitchen table. It was all set up with candles and flowers, and the dinner he cooked. He even had some music playing on the speaker. He started to say how I didn’t inform him I would be home late and he called me so many times because he was worried sick, I told my him phone died and I wasn’t planning to stay out that late. We went back and forth and we fought.

The fight ended in me going upstairs and he stayed downstairs. I honestly don’t think it usually would’ve escalated into such a huge fight, but the glass of whiskey I saw on the coffee table and the fact that he was probably exhausted contributed to it. After about 30 minutes I went back downstairs and I sat down next to him. He was doing some work on his laptop, and I tried to make small talk which he answered with very blunt responses. Then I asked him if he’s mad at me, which I know was a really stupid thing to ask but I guess i just wanted to make sure. He kind of lost it after that and started saying how he’s obviously mad and it doesn’t take a genius to figure that out.

He told me how it’s only his second night back and I’m already starting with this bullshit. At one point he said how “I’m an irresponsible fucking mess who can’t even remember to charge their damn phone”, and I said at least I’m not drinking at 1 am like an alcoholic. Alcohol is a touchy topic for him because of his alcoholic father, and he’s always so careful to never go overboard when he does rarely drink anyways, so I know it was a really messed up thing to say. He went upstairs after that and we haven’t talked since.

I took my dose yesterday (2.5mg, week 4, final week of this dose ) and ordered some Mexican for dinner. 

Now PROS are that normally, previously, I'd overeat throughout the day and then have ALL the chips and ALL the large queso plus ALL or almost all of my combo meal (burrito, quesadillas, rice and beans combo), feel like crap and then still have some chocolate later :( so the PRO is i didn't eat that much. 

But I did overeat. I had a solid lunch. Then I had half the chips, half of the queso, the entire quesadilla, and 1/3 of the combo. Good news is it is a lot better than before. Bad news was I overate and I was SO full i couldn't drink water.  and I am FEELING it today. 

It's like a food hangover. Im bloated. Legit stomach pain. Had one little biscuit this morning with coffee. I feel dehydrated from the salt. And I had mild diarrhea.

42 days in the hospital and then an unexpected outpatient procedure the very next day. I'm exhausted.
My house is in shambles. I count at least 8 loads of laundry. My desk and work bench both look like a bomb went off on them. I'm left feeling disappointed, resentful and sad because it seems like I'm expected to just do everything myself.
This isn't like my daughter, who lives with me. 
Yesterday was particularly hard. It was like she just expected me to act like I did 29 years ago and do everything.
I wasn't sure if I was going to survive this time. The sepsis infection has been well entrenched by the time I git to the ER. If I'd waited until the next day, I would be dead. (ESRD down to catheter sucks)
This is somewhat out of character for her. I'm thinking she's got depression, anxiety and burnout going on. I don't know how to help her.
But I'm feeling angry, disappointed and saddened; I'm not physically capable of doing much right now. I need help getting stuff cleaned and organized. 
We fought yesterday. I told her she needed to get up off her butt and help me. She responded with a meltdown and said if I get hospitalized again, she's walking away.
I'm very hurt and very ALARMED. The dying person in me wanted to tell back ""there's the fucking door!"". But the mom in me heard ""terrified cubling"".
I'm having coffee and making cinnamon rolls rn. I tend to cook and bake for comfort.
 I'm not up for more fighting, but I have nothing left. I need her help.

I've been crushing hard on a coworker for months, this crush was so hard that I finally had the confidence to ask her out, even though I've been told dating coworkers can be a bad idea.

She actually said yes to getting coffee with me, however, even though I was treating it as a date I could tell she wasn't. Regardless, we had a great conversation and I feel like similar to at work, we had great chemistry and there was no reason to think she wasn't interested in me.

The next day I asked her if she wanted to go on a real date with me, she said that even though she had a good time with me, she isn't ready to start dating yet. This is completely reasonable, as her husband was killed tragically in a car accident last year.

I need to respect her feelings and her decision, but I can't help but think under different circumstances she would actually have been interested in dating me. Normal people could easily move on from this and already look to meet someone new, but for someone who's dating life has been nonexistent, it is very difficult seeing her everyday at work and wondering what if.

I feel like I'm never going to find a woman like her on a dating app (or anyone in general) and I am already preparing for how I am going to handle myself if in a few months or even years she is ready to start dating and I find out she is dating someone other than me.

I probably could have got over her if she just said she wasn't interested or wanted to be friends, but because I feel like there is a chance she actually is interested in me, I am crushing on her even more, even though I've done all I can. I guess if there's one positive, if she would have said yes to dating me and we would have went on like 5 dates only for it not to have worked out, seeing her at work everyday would hurt even more.

We have lived two completely different lives, she was married for so long only for it to be suddenly taken away, while I've been alone for so long I don't know what it's like to feel closely connected to another person.

Im not happy to start the day.

My conscious day starts with dread. 

I get my coffee and sit down and proceed to stare into nothing for hours. Be it my phone, my coffee cup, out the window, lay my head down and look at the wall.

I see the pile of work and tasks I need to do and the thought of them weighs as heavy as the anxiety on my chest. 

 The cycle repeats until I start crying because I’m malfunctioning. Why is this happening ? Who am I? I used to wake up and immediately start on mental / physical tasks. I would wake up happy to get started on projects. I would stretch and feel good and drink water and and and and and and and -

Now I wake up and wish I never did. I begrudgingly move my body and work out the stiffness of sleeping in a frozen anxious position. I shuffle to the kitchen and chug a glass of water in fear I wont drink any the rest of the day. I make my coffee and not even it, tastes like I give a damn. I see my pile of tasks and can’t even comprehend how to start them so I look for a laugh online, and an hour later I realize I’m staring at the birds again. 

Knowing how productive and focused I’ve been my whole life and seeing how I hardly manage to function now cuts a hot searing hole into my chest. I try breathing exercises but as I calm down I start to cry. 

And now three hours have passed and it’s time for work. 

Until I drive home in silence and sit on the couch, in the dark. Just waiting for an appropriate time to go back to sleep. 

Like where do I even start? How has this happened? Who am I?",5,1731255862.0,depression,2,1.0,False

\- Remove umbrella pole, peanut jar, ketchup bottle, silverware, napkins, coffee cup, paper.

\- balance the lighting so it doesn't look like we're staring into the sun (which we are)

\- fix the weirdness with my forehead hair (I'm the guy on the right, FYI) 

\- Change the ATROCIOUS background with something less green and distracting

\- Open my GF's (woman holding her own arm, the two on the left are my daughters) eyes a little bit

\- bring everything into focus.

I'll skip sugar in my coffee, I'll do intermittent fasting again, I'll avoid carbs all day.  If I can just get in a routine like that I can do it, I just don't have the willpower.  Every fucking day I just give in!""

Before Zep, me every morning/afternoon:  ""A little sugar in my coffee won't hurt. And I'll have a frozen waffle. That'll keep me from being hungry all day and I'll eat less. Oh, lunchtime.... I wonder if there are any chips in the house?  NO, don't even go looking.  Well, I'm already huge, one more day of eating crap can't make it THAT much worse.  I'll start being better tomorrow.""

....and then again at night, and again, and again, every single day, just a repeating spiral of ""I can't/I should/I suck!""

The day I picked up my prescription, I threw out half a large bag of chips and immediately gave myself a shot. Went to bed feeling hopeful. Woke up feeling hopeful. Got to the coffee pot and saw the sugar next to it and said, ""nah, not today."" Put in some cream and went about my day. Afternoon came, didn't even think about junk food. Skipped breakfast, skipped lunch, ate a nice dinner, went to bed.

ZERO recriminations. ZERO guilt about what I'd done all day. ZERO judgy self-talk in my head.

1go48t5,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1go48t5/road_map_for_young_men_navigating_a_breakup/,Road Map for Young Men Navigating a Breakup,"My intentions for writing this are to share my experience and help young men like myself navigate the hellish void that is a break up. This is something I would have really benefitted from, I hope you do as well.

**Background:**

I'm a 22(m), currently finishing my last semester of college. I am currently going through my second breakup, my first being of 3.5 years out of highschool. This one ended 2 days before our 1 year anniversary. It was not my choice but it wasn't a total surprise either. I really thought she was the one, and I was putting everything I had into making this work. The harsh reality is people change and the girl who I began dating was not the same person as the one who decided she no longer wanted me in her life. By far the worst pain I've ever felt, in my life this far.

**Week 1:**

**- Day 0:**

You've just been broken up with and are still in shock at what has just happened. If you can, you must surround yourself with people. I know it seems like the world and your heart have just been crushed. This is the lowest of the lows. Call parents, friends, whoever you can and tell them what happened. You don't even need to talk, just be in their company. Share the weight of the experience with as many as you can. Cry if you can, let everything out, hold nothing in. I know you are trying to be strong, but let your emotions flow. Trust me.

**- Day 1:**

You might not want to get out of bed today, thats ok. Your appetite is also likely gone, try to eat something if you can. Something delicious and calorie dense, treat yourself. If you can, surround yourself with people and don't do anything you don't want to do. If you can, call in sick to work. Today is your day to do whatever you want. What gives you the slightest sembelance of joy.

**- Day 2:**

It is hard to say what you will be feeling today. Might be pure sadness, rage, emotionless, etc. Whatever it is, today is crucial for your recovery. I want you to block your EX on everything and I mean everything (except email/text). This may seem like an over reaction, but it is crucial. Trust me when I say you will be glad in a couple weeks you did this.

After you've done that, delete or hide all photos of this person. This is the hardest part of the getting over it process but trust me when I say it must be done. The last thing you need is to see their face and trigger an overwhelming wave of memories and emotions. Hang in there. Do what brings you Joy.

**- Day 3-6:**  
Surround yourself with people. Do what makes you happy, remember you need to eat. That pit in your stomach won't be there for ever. If possible, have friends do any of the communcation with your ex. Belongings might need to be exchanged, etc. It's best case if someone can handle that for you. You need to focus on you right now.

**Key Points:**

* Surround yourself with people
* Let the emotions out
* Block your Ex on everything
* Remove any photos or things that will trigger memories.

# Week 2:

**- Day 7-10:**

By now you have most likely accepted this new reality. You are still going to be burning inside, that is ok. Ride the emotional wave.

A major thing that helped me at this point, was I shaved my moustache. This is something I had had for around 5 months, and my ex loved it. I wish I had known to do this during my first breakup. Seeing a different version of you in the mirror, then the one who was with your EX, does something powerful in the brain that I struggle to describe.

For me, it was a new me, a fresh start, and alot of negative emotions and pain were left with the old me.

If you can, get a haircut, shave, or even buy a new pair of glasses. Something to immediatley change the image you see in the mirror.

**- Day 10-13:**

I imagine right now, the sadness and misery you feel has started to turn into anger and hatred. Don't let it consume you, channel it. Pick up a new hobby, learn a new skill, something productive. This energy you're feeling is some of the most power you'll ever have. May as well put it to good use.

For me, I started going very hard on my school work and my workouts. This was tough because my EX and I bonded over going to the gym. My sanctuary had turned into a place which brought back the most memories. Luckily I had a gym buddy I was able to rely on to help keep me on track. Friends are your biggest tool right now, utilize them.

It is going to feel weird not having someone constantly texting you, or asking how your day is going. Again, friends, family, and people are crucial. Surround youreslf with them.

**Key Points:**

* Change something about your physical appearance
* Channel the negative energy towards good things
* Let the emotions come, ride the wave, then let them go
* Surround yourself with people

# Week 3:

This is a new week and a new you. If you've been riding the emotional waves, they should be becoming less frequent and less scary. During this phase, if you can, begin talking to other girls. I downloaded hinge, and was able to go on a coffee date with a lovely girl. Nothing needs to come from this but seeing that their are still good people willing to put effort into you is huge for self motivation and future hope. You will still be getting hit by waves of emotion, sadness, grief, anger. Hold the course.

The biggest thing you should focus on this week if possible, is forgiveness. Consistantly being angry at someone, gives them power over you as are directing your valuable energy towards them. Be happy for the good times you had together while understanding she missed out on the best guy she'll ever meet. If it was going to happen, it's better it happened now then years down the line. Forgive them, we're all human trying to figure this all out.

I want you to write down all the things you disliked about your EX. How they acted, tendancies you weren't a fan of, things they did that annoyed you. Lay it all out, no one is perfect. When you think of them, read this. Not only will it help combat the fantasies, but give you a good road map for what to look out for in the next girl you bring into your life.

**Key Points:**

* Meet new people
* Let the emotions continue to flow
* Forgive as soon as possible
* Write down everything you disliked

**Closing Remarks:**

Man, I know how it seems like your world has eneded. Although they decided they no longer need you, YOU ARE WORTHY. You are a great guy, a true treasure and there is someone out there who will eventually see you for the amazing person you are. Do not lose hope. Grow from this, become better, get to know yourself and how to love you. Everything is going to be ok.

When you are really going through it, give this video a listen. I probably have heard watched it over 100 times at this point. It really helps.

1go48k0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1go48k0/im_divorcing_my_wife_after_discovering_her_affair/,I'm divorcing my wife after discovering her affair with the dad of one of the kids she coaches,"{Links to all previous posts are at the bottom}

**Recap of the situation leading to this update:**

I became suspicious of my wife after she started making strange comments about a 17-year-old boy she coaches in soccer. When I confronted her, she became defensive and lashed out. After going through her phone, I discovered that she’s likely been having an affair with the boy’s father. Initially, I felt a sense of relief that it wasn’t a predatory situation, but I was also overwhelmed with grief and betrayal, realizing that my wife had been unfaithful.

**Update:**

First off, I just want to thank you all for your support and patience through this difficult time. Unfortunately, my most recent update was removed, so I reposted it, but that was then locked so I haven’t been able to reply to any comments or make any edits to the actual post.

Now before the update I also need to admit something that I lied about in my last update. I said I got records from our shared phone provider, but the truth is, I actually went through her phone. I was nervous about admitting this on here and worried about potential consequences. But in retrospect, I feel I had good enough reason to check, and the phone was purchased using our shared bank account, which could give me a valid claim for accessing it. If it counts for anything, I did try to contact our shared service provider, but they told me they don’t give out any specific personal information (this includes messages) to anyone but the police, for security and confidentiality reasons.

When looking through her messages with ""Hot soccer dad"", the same name kept coming up and it became clear that this was the kid. The messages made it quite obvious who it was as they were often using the kid as an excuse to stay in contact. The conversations were overly flirty, and it was quite obvious that something was going on between the two of them. On top of this, it looks like they have met up several times for coffee after practice. I don’t know where the kid goes in that time, as there is still no mention of his mother, and I still don’t know much about the kid’s family situation.

With all that said, I’m relieved to say that things are finally moving forward. I decided to meet with a divorce attorney who has been fantastic and am in the process of finalising everything. I’m now set up in a temporary apartment with a separate bank account. It was surprisingly easy to open, and I regret not doing it earlier, the freedom it’s given me has been a massive weight off my shoulders. I’m not naïve anymore and I have no intention of dragging this out but know things may still get complicated. Though, after a lot of stress and uncertainty I’m finally starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel and it’s a relief to think shell soon be out of my life.

The last real piece of bad news in this update. Her family, especially her sister, is fully aware of the situation but has chosen to side with her. I’ve never been the biggest fan of her sister to be completely honest, but never to this extent. I’ve been receiving aggressive messages from her sister, calling me selfish and threatening to ensure my wife “gets everything.” They’ve even implied that they use their family’s financial resources to back her legally as they’re well off and have offered to cover her costs. To add to this there are some legal loopholes regarding out shared assets, including the house, which could mean I have a lot more to lose in this than I expected.

This has been a humbling and, in some ways, eye-opening experience. I always assumed infidelity – or these kinds of situations – would be easy to spot. I never expected to be blindsided by my own partner, someone I loved and trusted completely. I realize now that betrayal doesn’t fit into near categories or follow obvious patterns. Although this situation didn’t turn out to be the predatory relationship I feared, it shown me that anyone – male or female – can be vulnerable to this kind of manipulation.

With the court date set and the divorce process underway, it feels like I’m nearing the end of this exhausting chapter. I’m incredibly grateful for all the support and insight I’ve received here. it’s been a strange few weeks, but I’m determined to close this chapter and start fresh. I’ll keep sharing updates as things progress, though I don’t foresee too many more developments.

Thank you again for being there. I know I can’t respond to everyone, but your encouragement has meant a lot and given me the courage to keep on fighting.

Oh, and one more thing I forgot to add - I reconnected with my brother and shared everything about what’s been happening. Thankfully, he was really glad I reached out, and he’s actually planning to come visit at the end of the year. I’m really looking forward to it; I’ve missed him a lot since we last saw each other during the difficult time of our mother’s passing.

Since this is the r/advice subreddit, I still need to ask for advice so: Can anyone give me any advice on how to get through a tricky divorce? Has anyone else been through anything similar to this? What is the best way to move on with my life?

1go47jj,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1go47jj/laid_off_this_past_week_maybe_coastfire_maybe_not/,"Laid off this past week, maybe CoastFIRE, maybe not. How to move forward?","Hello fellow seekers of financial freedom.  I was laid off this past week, deep into my FI journey and could use some perspective.  The ""surplusing"" wasn't entirely surprising. While a historically high performer at work, my VP and major supporter of my professional development left the business in May and the guy who took over is someone I've butt heads with over the years and I've known this as a highly likely result since that time.  So it goes, but that's part of the beauty of pursuing FI, afterall.

We were up until this point, a dual income household in our early 40s with 3 kids in grade school/middle school.  My wife works part time up to 20hrs/wk, take home of $80k or so/yr 1099 style (no bennies, pretax).  I was making around $220k/yr after bonus and what not.  Now I make zero!  We've got a networth of around $2.6MM, about $1.8MM of which is not home equity.  No other debt other than our 2.75% mortgage with about $455k left on it.  I have no plans to pay this off early.  Lastly, I've got 3 months of severence and healthcare coverage following my termination and vested some RSUs (leadership awards, lol) at a prorated amount now in my personal trading account.  I plan to sell these while they are at a neutral cost basis, this week.

Account breakdown:

* $60k cash

* $370k taxable

* $170k roth ira

* $50k gambling with individual stocks and a bit of options (up 180% YTD, thanks RDDT!)

* $1.2m 401k/HSA

* $85k 529s

* $80k in vehicles (2020, 2021)

* $1.1m residence, $650k equity

We used to track expenses religiously but totally fell off the wagon in 2023 and 2024.  I'm currently going through 2024 expenses, month by month, but our average monthly expenses the last few years have been around $11-12k/mo.  We live in a MCOL area in the Midwest with home taxes capped at 1% of our appraised value.  Not having fully gone through all 2024 expenses for the year yet, from what I can see we can very easily cut expenses down to about $8-9k/mo without any major hit to lifestyle.  Apparently I bought a lot of coffee and ate out way too much this year, and my wife has a HomeGoods addiction.  MMM would be disappointed in us, I'm sure.

Since getting laid off, I've had a few calls with recruiters that are jobs I'm not sure I'd actually want - e.g. one was a 100% road warrior job that pays extremely well with an equity stake but I'd have to travel constantly.  This has caused me to pause and reconsider what it is I want, which I frankly don't know.  This past year has been great because I've worked low hours, and been home most of the time which has allowed me to spend more time with the family, and contribute around the house in a way I haven't in years.  So far this week, I've been enjoying crushing my to-do list every day and spending a ton of time with the family.  I'm pretty handy so I have a looooong list of house projects I can work on for probably multiple years.  I've also taken over cooking and I am enjoying meal prep/planning as a temporary job.  If I'm honest, I'm enjoying myself at this exact moment.

However, my wife is panicking which is kind of her MO, but it's the only thing that I find stressful while not working.  I'm of the opinion that there is no rush to find immediate employment meanwhile she's looking for jobs for me more than I am.  That one is probably above the paygrade of r/fi but I wanted to include it for full disclosure of stuff going through my mind right now.  Personally, I feel like the math puts us firmly in coastFIRE territory with just a little bit of expense control, though I'm not sure how healthcare would work?

Questions to those of you not in my emotional shoes:

* How would you approach figuring out next steps?  I feel like we don't need to rush, though my wife would vehemently disagree

* Healthcare: A quick look at a healthcare calculator with $80k/yr income from my wife looks like we could pay just $183/mo for a family of 5 with ""financial help"".  Without financial help, it would cost $1485/mo.  Does that seem correct??

* Is dental included in ACA stuff?

* Outside of brushing up on my resume & filing for unemployment, is there anything else major I should be doing right this moment?

* What else??",13,1731255446.0,financialindependence,28,0.76,False

A guy comes through and asks when breakfast ends and I tell him 9:30 (it was 11am at that point) they're cleaning the breakfast room now. He says oh okay then proceeds to head into the breakfast room anyway. The housekeeper in there doesn't speak English so I didn't want her to have to deal with the confrontation so I called after him to stop him.

He came back out and I told him again that breakfast was over and the door was only open because the housekeeper was in there cleaning. He asked to speak to a manager, I told him the manager would be back in on Tuesday. He then proceeded to spin me sob story about how his family was upstairs and they'd come in late last night, blah blah blah. Would we please extend him the courtesy of letting them have breakfast now?

I reminded him that breakfast ended *an hour and a half* prior and the room was currently being cleaned. He grumbled a bit and went over to the coffee station, watching me out of the corner of his eye and I watched him out of the corner of *my* eye to make sure he didn't try to go in the breakfast room again. While making his coffee he got on the phone with someone and started talking about how he didn't even want hotel breakfast, and dining out was much better.

1go452m,https://www.reddit.com/r/swordfights/comments/1go452m/how_hard_is_it_to_do_stunts_with_wires_on_you_do/,How hard is it to do stunts with wires on you? Do people underestimate how hard it is to do wire fu action scenes? Does doing even simple stuff like jumping over 2 foot stones require some training and/or prep despite use of wirework?,"Years ago I saw an a page on TVTropes where some American who grew up watching martial arts movies as a child and he aspired to become a martial artist and stuntsman one day. The page said he eventually accomplished his dream and became so good at action scenes and stunts work that he was able to do a lot of the stuff he saw in the Kung Fu movies he loved watching from childhood....... And it was a gigantic surprise for him to learn so much of the action he saw on TV and films growing up were not really done by the actors themselves but were executed with the assistant of wires and other tricks. It was both a big disappointment and disbelief to learn that for him in the fact of being able to do a lot of the jumpy flipy stuff on his own just by his sheer athleticism and skill.

I wish I can find the exact article but I can't seem to get it no matter how many times I search on TVtropes so you'll just have to take my word for it, That said having finished half of Jet Li's movies and now starting on Jackie Chan, I'm inspired to ask this question just by the fact that while Jet Li used a lo of wires from his 90s stuff, he also did a crap ton of movies whee he was doing all the stunts and fight choreography on his own without any assistance be it from attached wires or stunt doubles or the plethora of other tricks in the movie industry.

Is it easy as 123 doing stunts and fight scenes with wire fu? Like no more difficult than drinking coffee on your comfy couch in the morning before reading the newspaper? Or does it have some challenges? That even movie stars known primarily for their beauty and thus have to use wirework because they aren't conditioned for Wushu such as Lin Qingxia will have to do sometimes preparing themselves physically and rehearsing scenes over and over before filming the actual footage? That Joey Wong couldn't just start filming right away swinging her swords and flying across the sky from building to building and over the sea to land on a nearby ship even though the wires attached to her would ease up the burden so much?

That even people with prior kung fu training such as Michelle Yeoh will have to practise before doing a Wuxia film and stunt professional veteran men will have to specifically learn how to use wires if they never used them before? Why so? I probably got a lot of details wrong but the second paragraph comes from the fact I remember watching videos with Yeo saying she has to get used to moving with the wires and footage of her drilling with wires with a bunch of repeating movements were shown in between the conversation with the person interviewing her. So I'm wondering if wire fu is a skill all by itself that deserves respect and isn't something any run-of-the-mill stuntsmanor martial artist can start using right away for filming?",1,1731255259.0,swordfights,0,1.0,False
