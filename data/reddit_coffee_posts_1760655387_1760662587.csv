They also provide “Alkaline” water which is the same water but with minerals added. It’s at about 25  TDS which I would think is good soft water for coffee but the pH is high at like 9-10.

**This Food Stocks Pro Sizes Up Industry Winners and Sinners. Why PepsiCo Shouldn’t Split.**

TD Cowen analyst Robert Moskow likes Celsius’ latest purchase, but not Keurig Dr Pepper’s coffee deal.

Key Points

About This Summary

* Packaged-food companies face challenges from changing consumer preferences, rising input costs, and tariffs, leading to sales declines and squeezed earnings.
* Mondelez International and Hershey lowered 2025 guidance due to margin compression from higher cocoa prices, despite recent 20% price increases.
* Celsius Holdings’ acquisition of Alani Nu is seen as a strategic move, leveraging scale benefits and a new distribution agreement with PepsiCo.

======

**How is PepsiCo’s turnaround going? What should the company do in response to Elliott Investment Management’s activism campaign?**

Not so great. PepsiCo  is using tactics like smaller pack sizes at lower price points to make consumers feel as though there is less money coming out of their pockets. It hasn’t really worked. The company talked about reviving the healthier versions of its products, but it’s an uphill battle.

In response to the activism \[Elliott recently disclosed a $4 billion stake in PepsiCo and highlighted steps it thinks the company should take to increase value\], it would be good if management could give investors a vision for what the margin structure of Frito-Lay \[PepsiCo’s food segment\] could look like, and how much they could reinvest in the business.

**There have been past proposals to split PepsiCo’s beverage and food businesses. Would that help the company become more focused and create more shareholder value?**

Not necessarily. Although I have seen focused businesses succeed more often than diversified ones, I see reasons for Pepsi’s beverage and food businesses to be together. \[With the combination,\] you get a lot of scale around key merchandising events at retail and in terms of advertising. If executed properly, having them together is still value accretive.

1o8nije,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supernote/comments/1o8nije/just_grabbed_a_sn_nomad_heres_a_few_things_im/,Just grabbed a SN Nomad here’s a few things I’m curious about,"I’m a RMPP user who likes the simplicity of the RM interface but have recently started wanting a little more from it. I’ve been enjoying the writing experience on the RM but was wanting something a little more “carry friendly” I don’t travel a whole lot for work mainly local from home to office and the occasional coffee shop or meeting every few weeks. My favorite device I’ve ever owned is my iPad mini, the size, and form factor makes it a perfect device in my opinion for everything other than taking notes uninterrupted. 

I tried a RMPPM but as a left handed writer it didn’t feel natural and often times I found myself fumbling around with the orientation to write comfortably and even then my handwriting was less than ideal, this led me to returning it after only 3 days of my 100 day trial. 

In comes the SN platform. My main workflow on these tablets is my to-do list, short and long term strategic planning for my business, creating workflows, team member one on ones, etc. calendar integration was also something I was after. Since I use Apple OS as my primary I prefer to have all of my reminders and time sensitive appointments on my Gmail account since it’s on my Apple Watch, I can sync to my wife’s scheduler so she can plan around my busy work days as a SAHM. It’s convenient. Also, RM does not have this capability. SN does. So I picked up a SN Manta, size is very similar to my favorite iPad mini, has a calendar sync, and a nice organized to-do list.

Comparing them both I’ve noticed a few things my RM does that I’ve grown to appreciate and like that are driving me a little crazy and could be deal breakers for me with the SN platform. Hoping someone with more experience on this platform can shine some light on some of these minor pain points I’m having to further allow me to put it through the test in determining what my EDC is going to be going forward.

1. When using the comments/annotations when I am trying to use the freehand handwrite to text feature when I rest my left hand on the screen to write in the bottom box it rests on the left side scroll bar and closes out the window I am writing it making it virtually useless.


2. I prefer writing in landscape mode, being a lefty my hand rests on the tablet better and helps me limit fatigue and write clearer. I’ve noticed when doing this, the finger gestures for lasso/erase are not working. Not sure if having it landscape disables this feature, but when I try to double press and circle to erase it draws and solid line and wont erase. Since I’m using the HOM pen I have to open back up the toolbar and manual select which is too much to do constantly why trying to get into a “flow” state while writing. Same for the undo/redo.

3. Unable to zoom in or out of templates. I like to zoom out and sometimes write smaller to fit more on lines depending on the amount of notes I’m writing. I have not found where I can do that on the SN Nomad. It’s a small screen to start, so the lines in the given notebook templates are on the larger side, scrolling out would make them appear smaller and would fit my handwriting style more naturally.

These are just a few things I’ve noticed in the last few days of using them side by side while trying to figure out what better fits my workflow. I’m sure I’ll have more questions as I continue to test it out moving forward, any help or advice on these small inconveniences I am experiencing would be greatly appreciated.

My current apartment building is infested with German cockroaches and myself and my partner finally signed a lease for a new place start of next month. I'm packing everything very carefully. Inspecting and cleaning every item and using plastic bins instead of cardboard, putting clothes, linens and plushies in plastic bags then the plastic bins. I've thrown out quite a few of our belongings already. We aren't even keeping any of our living room couches/chairs. 

Here's my dilemma and problem. We are only keeping three pieces of wooden furniture. Coffee table, tv stand and my large vintage china cabinet. The coffee table and tv stand appear fine and have no traces of the roaches. My china cabinet is a different story. 

I've been keeping it clean and using Diatomaceous earth in the cabinet which has seemed to help. I finally got some bubble wrap and cleared out all my fine china, getting to inspect the inside more clearly. I saw two or three large roaches and some dead baby roaches and a couple old hatched eggs that were hidden in my dishes. I also looked on top and saw a few of the bugs hanging out and I was able to kill them. So along with Diatomaceous earth, my partner is going to put roach bait into all the parts of the cabinet to help. 

My worry is because of the type of old wood and amount of cracks in the wood, if I should just cut my losses, or if there is something else I can do to avoid bringing roaches by keeping my china cabinet. Any help would be appreciated. 

For reference I live in Canada and a lot of pesticides that actually work are banned here. ",1,1760662262.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

We have a whole home surge protector that was installed when we had solar panels put on our home two years ago. So, really, we don’t need the surge protection from a surge protector. Mainly, I’m looking to just expand the number of things that can be plugged into an outlet. 

We need one for a computer (Mac Mini), monitor, and computer speakers. We need another for a Nintendo Switch, speaker bar, and subwoofer. We need a third for an espresso machine, coffee grinder, vinyl player, and speaker pair. The last one really doesn’t need to be plugged in all the time—just whenever we make espresso or listen to vinyl (not an everyday thing). In that situation, would it still be in advisable to use an extension cord with four spots for grounded plugs?

Would this be a safe device to use assuming we don’t really care about the surge protection aspect?

1o8ne6m,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o8ne6m,AIO for feeling betrayed and played by my fiancée?,"So I (29M) have been with my fiancée (25F) for six years now. We’re getting married next year, and honestly, we’ve always had a strong, healthy thing going!   Good communication,  trust, and a good sex life. 

She’s stunning, fit &smart and recently opened up to me about being bi. And she was extremely horny and excited for a while after how well I took this news!
We’ve talked about fantasies, but we’ve always agreed we wouldn’t risk our relationship for any sort of experiment. Unless it's something we're both into and have set clear boundaries.

Anyway, we went to a Halloween party last weekend. Had one cap,  some drinks and everyone was vibing. At one point, I notice her in the kitchen talking to another girl, she was pretty, flirty, and obviously into my fiancée. I walk over, and she goes, “Oh, you must be the man,” and I laugh and say, “Yep,I'm the the future husband.”

We’re all chatting, and it’s obvious the girl is flirting hard with my fiancée. Honestly, it was kinda hot watching it unfold . I’ve always found it a turn-on when another girl  finds her attractive, and is hitting on her especially since we’re open about that kind of thing.

But then things start getting interesting. The girl asks my fiancée if she’d be open to a threesome or even a four-way, saying she’d love to “see her man with her.” My fiancée politely says she’s not into that, and then the girl switches it up and goes, “Okay, what about just us two then?”

She even asks my fiancée if she finds her attractive (she said yes), and then the girl says she’s gonna go “ask for permission.” .

So she goes to talk to him, comes back, and tells my fiancée that he said yes. My fiancée tells her she doesn’t want to do anything, and that it feels weird, . Totally fine by me ,we go upstairs and chill and didn't see her for the test of the night.

The next day, we talked about it sober and went over our boundaries again. My fiancée said that if something ever did happen in the future, it would only be something where she could explore her bi side , like her and another girl , but I wouldn’t touch or kiss the other person. 
(She's pretty possesive)I was cool with that as long as we’re both completely open and honest. 

Then we start talking about the girl from the party, and my fiancée says she doesn’t even remember her name, doesn’t want to do anything with her (Sexually), but might grab a coffee with her just to clear the air and apologize for rejecting her so awkwardly while high/drunk. I told her that’s fine, as long as she keeps me in the loop.

Fast forward to today , I find out she actually went through the Halloween guest list, found the girl’s boyfriend, stalked him to find the girl’s name, then added her on Instagram. When I asked about it, she admitted she messaged her too, but she hadn’t told me anything until I asked directly.

When I said, “Can I see the message?” she hesitated and said it was weird that I wanted to see a screenshot. Then she casually mentions, “Oh, I also asked her to grab a coffee, but I didn’t mean it.”

The girl ended up replying but completely ignored the coffee part and basically shut the convo down.

Now I’m sitting here feeling kinda betrayed. Not because I think she cheated ! Coz she didn’t  ... but because she did go behind my back after saying she didn’t even want to talk to the girl. What if the other girl had said yes? Would she have told me?
And also the fact that she put all those emojis and the reply to the girls message she had gone and searched for that heart emoji ! ... It's just odd or maybe I'm overthinking?


My fiancée’s now upset with me for “not believing her”. But I can’t help but feel like it’s a breach of trust. We literally agreed that if anything like this ever happens, we’d be upfront about it.

Am I overreacting for feeling hurt and a bit betrayed? Or is it fair to be upset that she went behind my back and messaged someone she said she had no interest in?
When I confronted my fiancée about it, she got upset and sent me this long message saying she was “disappointed I don’t believe her” and that she’s been “open and honest about everything.” Then she added that she doesn’t want me to talk about it with anyone else, because it could give people “the wrong impression of her” while she’s “trying to figure out where she stands on these things.”

And I don’t know, that hit weird. It feels like she’s more worried about how it looks than how it made me feel.

I don’t think she cheated or anything, but she clearly wasn’t honest about messaging this girl or inviting her out. And if I hadn’t asked, I don’t think she would’ve told me. What if the girl had said yes?

Now she’s upset with me for not being on her side, and I’m just stuck feeling confused, and kind of betrayed.

So… am I overreacting here? Or is it fair to feel like she crossed a line after we explicitly agreed to be upfront and include each other in anything like this?

1o8nd5f,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o8nd5f,"[RANT] Campaign the 1st time: ""Meh. It's not THAT bad."" VS the 5th time around: ""Boy, the campaign sucks.""","First off all, don't get me wrong. I still think the game as a whole is a giant step (back) into the right direction. Especially the multiplayer, even though endless grinding for upgrades sucks light across the galaxy. And the campaign as a whole is the best one we've gotten in about 15 years (except for that one tank mission in BF1).

With Gecko, Hemlock, Lopez and Murphy we even got a squad of people who remotely resemble something like different characters, instead of the ever-same cast of generic [insert battle-hardened super patriots here - HOOAH!] that nobody remembers as soon as the credits roll. With that said: BUT ...

- So many pointless CoD-like rail sections. It plays like an interactive movie, and a bad one at that. Often enough, you don't even need to actually do anything - just go get a coffee or something and wait for the next ... 

- ... unskippable cut scene/dialogue sequence. Do the developers really think it's THAT interesting/entertaining/important, so you absolutely must watch it every single time? Nothing wrong with a little downtime, but it's half the ""game"" in this case.

- Actual battlefield-y sandboxes are too rare. Where's the freedom of movement and choice of how and where to engage an objective? There're exactly one (1!) relatively short segment of that in one mission of the entire game. Why must everything else play like it's on rails within a tunnel? You put that much time, effort and money in motion capturing, voice acting, directing and editing - why not spend it on making more interactive  and engaging instead? You know, like a game?

If you're willing to sacrifice that much gameplay for ""cinematic presentation"", go make a movie, because games are not for you.

- And don't even get me started on enemy AI. It's not BF4-bad, but still bad enough. F.E.A.R. celebrates it's 20th anniversary this year. And it's still the FPS with the best AI (together with the original Medal of Honor from ... *checks notes* ... 1999, for Christ's sake!) It feels like there has been no progress in that regard whatsoever. It hasn't even been matched. If anything, we've made like five steps back since then. How? Why?

I just finished mine, completely solo, in 3 days, for $1,500 total and I thought it might be useful to share how.

**Quick result**  
My campaign launched a week ago and it’s already 185% funded.

Here’s what I think worked best for me:

**Why I kept it lean**  
The campaign itself isn’t huge, so dropping $5K+ on a video didn’t make sense. I wanted something polished enough to build trust with backers but light enough on the wallet to keep funds focused on production.

**My gear setup**  
iPhone 16 Pro                                                                                                                                                       Rented DSLR + 2 lenses (variety for wide + tight shots)                                                                                
Mobile gimbal: I almost didnt buy it but It smoothed out shots and even let me pre-program camera moves (because of the AI tracking) and so I could fake a second cameraman while being in front of the camera myself. Used it the most, got DSPR for one day only realised that I am not pro at it and so shot most content on gimbal with my Iphone. It was much easier to use a simpler set-up then DSLR. Next time I wont rent out camera, that I learnt. I used isteady v3 ultra, costed $170. 

**Cost breakdown:**                                                                                                                                      Rentals + accessories: $900  
Music license + motion graphics pack: $250  
Editing software subscription (Premiere Pro + After Effects): $150  
Misc (props, delivery fees, etc.): $200  
Food/coffee for 3 straight days of shooting: priceless

**Planning & filming**  
Scripted in a 2-column doc (voiceover vs visuals) this saved me rental days.  
90% was filmed in my condo. Shallow depth of field made boring rooms look cinematic.  
Hohem’s motion path features made it look like a crew was operating the camera when it was just me.

**Editing & polish**  
Background track set the pace (royalty-free).  
Learned quick tricks from YouTube tutorials (motion tracking titles, color correction).  
Editing took another 2 days, but I kept costs low by doing it all myself.

**Why I think this worked**  
The end result isn’t Hollywood, but it looks professional enough for Kickstarter standards and it gave me the confidence to launch without burning cash before the campaign even started. Most production houses quoted me $3,000–$7,000 for a similar video. By going DIY, I kept it at $1,500. For me, that’s what minimum viable production looks like.

TL;DR: Shot my Kickstarter video solo in 3 days for $1,500. Campaign is already 185% funded.",2,1760661869.0,mobilephotography,0,1.0,False

He always wore a black python coiled around his wrist, his moods as dark and volatile as a storm, his methods merciless.

On their wedding night, he even brought the snake to bed. Even when she sobbed herself into oblivion, he never moved it away.

In their first year of marriage, she accidentally touched the snake and he locked her in the Basement Dungeon for three days straight.

In the second year, she gathered her courage to clean his python enclosure, only to be bitten.

When he arrived, he didn’t even glance at her bleeding wound. Instead, claiming she had frightened his pet, he dragged her to the Walk-in Freezer and left her there until she blacked out.

She spent three years living in terror, until the day…

His intern came to Blackwell Manor to pick up some files and burst into tears, saying she was afraid of snakes.

That night, the man who treated his snakes like treasure gave the order to have them all killed.

Juliana stood by the second-floor window, watching the courtyard littered with blood and snake corpses.

Only then did she realize—the merciless Damien was capable of breaking his own rules for someone he cared about.

But that someone was not his lawful wife.

That night, she printed out the Divorce Settlement Agreement and knocked on the door of the Executive Study.

He was seated behind his massive desk, reviewing reports. The warm yellow light of the desk lamp outlined his cold, chiseled profile.

“Damien,” Juliana’s voice trembled despite her best effort to stay calm, “we need to talk.”

The man didn’t even look up. His long fingers flipped a page as if she were nothing but air.

Her heart sank. She held out the document.

“We’ve been married for three years. Yes, it was a business arrangement, but maybe you don’t know this—” she drew in a breath, “I’ve loved you for years.”

Words spilled out of her like a dam breaking, three years of bottled-up pain and devotion.

“I know you’ve had a lot to carry, that you’ve been hurting. So I kept thinking, if I tried harder, just a little harder, one day I could warm your heart. I forced myself to stop fearing those snakes, to take care of them. Even when you locked me up in the dungeon or threw me into the freezer, I told myself you didn’t mean it…”

“But Damien, this time, I’m tired. I… don’t want to love you anymore. Let’s get a divorce.”

She watched him, waiting for even the slightest reaction, some sign that her words had reached him.

Seconds ticked by. Finally, Damien finished the last page of the report, picked up his pen, and signed with a stroke so sharp it cut the air. Only then did he raise his eyes slowly, as if finally noticing her presence.

“You,” he said flatly, “were actually talking to me?”

Juliana felt as if she had been plunged into an ice cave. Her blood turned cold.

All these years, it was as if she had married a deaf man.

She had once called him from the hospital after a car accident, crying and begging him to come. He hung up without a word.

When she had a raging fever, clutching his hand and whispering, “Damien, I feel awful,” he pulled away, face blank, and told the staff to look after her—acting as though he hadn’t heard.

Every time she gathered the courage to express her feelings or show him affection, he ignored her, just like now.

And now, when she asked for a divorce, he was still indifferent.

Three years, and she was still nothing but invisible air in his eyes.

Her body was ice-cold. She opened her mouth to speak again—and then his phone rang on the desk, Lillian’s name flashing on the screen.

Damien’s face, usually frozen like stone, softened in an instant.

“What is it?”

A girl’s tearful voice came from the other end, too faint to make out. Damien immediately stood up.

“Okay. Don’t be afraid. I’m coming.”

He grabbed his coat, completely forgetting his wife was even there.

Juliana numbly held out the agreement again.

“Sign it.”

He paused. Without even glancing at the contents, he took the pen and signed his name in the spouse’s signature box, as casually as if it were a delivery receipt.

When he was done, he stuffed the papers back into her hand and strode out of the study.

The door clicked softly shut, leaving Juliana standing alone.

She looked down at the cold, decisive signature that had soaked through the paper.

Her tears finally fell, splattering onto the agreement and blurring the ink.

Of course it hurt.

Before she married him, the entire upper circle whispered about how terrifying Damien was.

They said he was ruthless, twisted, obsessed with snakes—no one dared go near him.

When news broke that she would be marrying him, everyone pitied her, certain she would spend her nights crying.

But no one knew that when she heard the news, a secret flicker of joy bloomed in her chest.

Because many years ago, he had saved her life.

Back when she was still in high school, cornered by thugs in an alley, it had been Damien who stepped in to help her.

Even then he had been cold, but when he saw her crying, he wiped her tears and pressed a single candy into her palm.

One piece of candy—enough to steal her heart.

She never understood why he later became the fearsome man everyone dreaded.

Not until the day before the wedding, when Mr. Blackwell Sr., the stern patriarch, called her in for a private conversation.

“When Damien was seventeen,” the old man said, voice weary, “his father brought home several half-brothers just a few years younger, insisting they join the family. His mother was proud, she couldn’t take it. In a moment of despair… she jumped from the balcony, right in front of him.”

“From that day on, the boy changed completely. He destroyed every rival, even his father, and became the sole heir to the Blackwell fortune. But he stopped trusting anyone. He shut everyone out. He started raising those cold, slithering snakes—perhaps because they were the only things that wouldn’t betray him.”

The old man had taken her hands, pleading.

“Juliana, I hope that after the wedding, you can pull him out of that darkness. He’s a good boy, but his heart… has been frozen solid.”

So on her wedding night, when Damien walked into the room with the black python and said, “If you’re afraid, you can still run,” she had trembled from head to toe but stayed.

When he pinned her down and took her under the watchful eyes of the snakes, she cried all night but never pushed him away.

Later, to please him, she even forced herself to study how to care for the snakes, to face the creatures that made her skin crawl.

But after three years, over a thousand days and nights, she felt like nothing but a joke—trying in vain to thaw a block of ice that would never melt.

Until Lillian came.

The college girl Damien had rescued at a banquet became his personal assistant.

She came to the house to pick up some files, innocent eyes wide with fear.

When a small snake slithered near her feet, she broke down crying on the spot.

That very night, Damien returned to Blackwell Manor and gave the order to slaughter every snake he had treasured for years.

Blood pooled in the backyard, but he only wiped his hands clean and told the pale-faced Lillian.

“Don’t be afraid. There will never be snakes here again.”

Juliana watched from the second-floor window, staring at the carnage below.

And in that moment, she finally understood— Damien’s heart would never be hers to warm.

And so she chose to let go. To set them free.

Chapter 2

That night, Damien didn’t came home.

Juliana was past caring. She switched on the TV, numb, and every news channel was flooded with photos of Damien and Lillian Hart.

He shielded her with his body as they pushed through reporters.

He stooped to catch her every word.

He escorted her to an upscale restaurant.

Every photo landed like a slap, mocking three years of devotion squandered.

So he wasn’t incapable of being gentle.

He wasn’t incapable of taking the initiative.

He just never chose to be that way with her.

Juliana turned off the TV, and the world went quiet.

The next morning, she carried the signed Divorce Settlement Agreement to the County Court Clerk’s Office.

After reviewing the paperwork, the attorney told her.

“Ms. Vale, everything looks fine. After the thirty-day cooling-off period, you can come back to collect the Divorce Decree.”

Juliana thanked him and left, a tangle of relief and hollowness—relief at her freedom, and the ache of three years squandered.

She had just stepped outside to cross the street when a red sports car swerved toward her, out of control.

The screech and the sickening thud came as one.

Juliana was hurled into the air and hit the pavement hard. Pain tore through her body as warm blood pooled beneath her.

Through the ringing in her ears, she heard a familiar, fragile voice, crying into the phone.

“Mr. Blackwell… I-I’m not good at driving… I think I just hit someone…”

It was Lillian.

From the other end came Damien’s quick, urgent voice.

“Are you hurt?!”

“I-I’m fine… but… I think the one I hit was… Juliana… what do I do, Mr. Blackwell, I’m so scared…”

Her sobs grew louder.

Damien’s reply was ice-cold, chilling to the bone.

“Don’t be afraid. Stay in the car and don’t move. I’ll send someone to handle it. If she’s dead, it doesn’t matter. What matters is that you’re safe.”

If she’s dead, it doesn’t matter. What matters is that you’re safe.

The words were like a poisoned icicle driven straight into Juliana’s heart, knocking the breath from her lungs.

Three years of marriage—and he could still be this indifferent.

Darkness closed over her, and she lost consciousness.

When she opened her eyes again, she was at St. Augustine Medical Center, the air sharp with antiseptic.

Juliana blinked and saw Damien standing beside her bed, listening without expression to the doctor’s report.

“…Mrs. Blackwell has a left-side rib fracture, a mild concussion, and multiple contusions. She needs inpatient observation.”

Only then did Damien notice she was awake. He turned, his gaze fixed on her—not with concern but with clinical detachment.

Juliana parted her lips, about to speak.

But Damien spoke first, his tone leaving no room for argument.

“If you’re fine, get up.”

Before she could respond, he seized her and hauled her off the bed.

Pain tore through her body, forcing a sharp hiss from her throat as she struggled to stay standing.

“Damien! What are you doing?!”

His grip on her wrist tightened, strong enough to crush bone, as he dragged her toward the door.

“You’re going to apologize to Lillian.”

“Apologize?” Juliana almost laughed at the absurdity.

“She hit me! I’m the victim! You want the victim to apologize to the person who hit her?!”

Damien didn’t stop walking. His jawline was sharp as stone, his voice utterly devoid of warmth.

“You’re alive, aren’t you? Lillian is timid. She’s been having nightmares. If you apologize, tell her it wasn’t her fault, she’ll finally sleep.”

“You’ve lost your mind!” Juliana struggled, but it was useless.

“I won’t go! Why should I?!”

Damien suddenly halted and turned back, his dark eyes glinting with menace.

“Because if you don’t, your family’s company can forget about keeping that new project.”

Juliana froze. It felt as if a bucket of ice water had been poured over her head.

He was threatening her—with her family’s future.

Chapter 3

Humiliation and despair surged through her until she could barely breathe.

Looking at the cold, merciless man in front of her, Juliana finally seemed to drain of her strength. Her face blanched, and she gave the smallest nod.

“…Fine. I’ll apologize.”

Only then did Damien let her go.

But he still trailed her like a warden with a prisoner, marching her straight to Lillian’s VIP Suite.

Lillian was propped against the pillows, pale and red-eyed. When they entered, she shrank back like a scared animal.

“Lillian, Juliana is here to apologize.” Damien’s voice softened at once.

Juliana stood by the bed, her stomach turning at the sight of that pitiful, oh-so-innocent face.

She bit down hard, forcing the words through clenched teeth.

“I’m sorry.”

Lillian looked at her timidly and whispered.

“Juliana, it’s not your fault. I should’ve been more careful…”

But Damien wasn’t satisfied.

“Not enough sincerity,” he said coldly. “You’ll stay and look after Lillian until she’s discharged. After all, you’re the reason she was hospitalized.”

Juliana’s head shot up, her eyes full of disbelief.

Just then, his assistant, Lucas Gray, hurried over and murmured that an urgent company matter required Damien’s attention.

Damien frowned, glancing at Lillian, clearly reluctant to leave.

Lillian quickly spoke up, all understanding sweetness.

“Mr. Blackwell, you should go. Business comes first. Besides, Juliana will look after me.”

She even gave Juliana a small, harmless-looking smile.

Damien wavered, then nodded, murmuring a few instructions to Lillian before finally leaving.

The moment the door shut, the frail mask on Lillian’s face vanished.

She lounged against the headboard, looking Juliana up and down with open disdain.

“I’m thirsty,” she said lazily. “Get me some warm water.”

Juliana swallowed her anger and fetched the water.

Lillian took a sip, then frowned.

“Too hot! Are you trying to burn me? Get another!”

Juliana poured another cup.

“Too cold! Do you even know how to care for someone?”

After several rounds of this, Juliana finally snapped.

“Lillian, what exactly do you want?!”

Lillian’s lips curved into a mocking smile, her malice no longer hidden.

“What do I want? Juliana, haven’t you occupied the position of Mrs. Blackwell long enough? I want you to get out—now.”

Before Juliana could react, Lillian shot out a foot and hooked her ankle.

Juliana fell hard, her elbow smashing against the cold tile. The pain made her vision swim.

“You!” Juliana glared up at her. “You did that on purpose!”

“So what if I did?” Lillian looked down on her, smug and triumphant.

“Damien will only believe me. Never you.”

At that moment, familiar footsteps echoed outside the door.

Lillian’s expression changed in a flash, her soft, pitiful mask snapping back into place.

She grabbed the steaming water from the bedside table and poured it straight over her own hand.

“Aah!” Her scream pierced the air.

The door burst open.

Damien strode in just in time to see Lillian clutching her scalded hand, and sobbing, while Juliana sat stunned on the floor.

“Lillian!” Damien’s face darkened.

He shoved Juliana aside and rushed to Lillian, gathering her up. His voice was urgent, panicked, achingly gentle.

“What happened?!”

“Mr. Blackwell…” Lillian’s tears rolled down her cheeks as she held up her blistered hand.

“It was my fault. I probably upset Juliana by asking for water… Don’t blame her…”

Juliana instinctively tried to explain.

“Damien, it wasn’t me! She—”

“Shut up!” Damien’s voice cracked like a lash, his eyes keen enough to cut.

“I saw it with my own eyes, Juliana, and you still dare to lie?!”

He immediately pressed the call button.

Within seconds, a team of doctors and nursing Staff rushed in to treat Lillian’s burn.

Damien held her close the entire time, speaking softly to comfort her.

“Don’t be afraid, Lillian. I’m here. Nothing will happen to you.”

When the doctor lanced the blister, Damien even covered Lillian’s eyes so she wouldn’t see the blood.

That tender care—Juliana had never once received it in three years of marriage.

Her chest tightened painfully, every breath like a knife.

When the doctor finally reported that the burn was mild and wouldn’t scar, Damien exhaled in relief.

He told Lillian to rest, then turned to Juliana, his gaze freezing cold.

“You. Out. Now.”

He yanked Juliana into the corridor and slammed her against the wall. His voice shook with contained fury.

“Juliana! You promised to take care of Lillian. Why did you pour hot water on her?!”

Juliana looked at the man raging for another woman’s sake and almost laughed.

“Promised? Damien, you threatened my family’s company to force me into this! You made your lawful wife play nurse to an intern—how is that even reasonable?! And I didn’t pour the water!”

“I saw it with my own eyes!” Damien’s voice was icy.

“She even tried to defend you. This is how you repay her kindness? With cruelty?”

“Kindness?” Juliana’s laugh was hollow, tears spilling down her cheeks.

“Damien! We’ve been married three years. She’s only been here three months! And you trust her completely. What about me? What do I mean to you? Do you just believe every word she says?!”

Her heart felt like it was being ripped apart.

But Damien remained cold and merciless, each word falling like a blade.

“Yes. She’s mine. I only believe her.”

And in that instant, his meaning was clear—Juliana Vale meant nothing.

Chapter 4

To punish her “crime,” Damien summoned the Blackwell Security Team.

Ignoring Juliana’s cries and desperate struggle, they hauled her down to the second basement level—stopping at the door of the Morgue Room.

“No! Damien, you can’t do this! I’m scared—let me out! Let me go!”

Juliana had feared the dark since childhood—terrified of places like this.

She pounded frantically at the cold metal door, trembling uncontrollably.

Damien stood outside, watching through the tiny observation window as her terrified, despairing face swam into view.

There was not a flicker of emotion in his eyes—only a glacial warning.

“Juliana, reflect in here. And remember—don’t lay a finger on Lillian again. Next time, it won’t just be the morgue.”

He turned on his heel and walked away without a backward glance, his footsteps fading down the corridor.

Darkness. Cold. The faint, nauseating tang of formaldehyde.

All of it swallowed Juliana whole.

She sank to the floor, hugging her knees as tears burned tracks down her cheeks.

Three years of devotion—and this was her reward.

What kind of man had she loved, to be this cruel?

It wasn’t until the next morning that someone unbolted the door and let her out.

Her face was as pale as paper, her entire body stiff and frozen, as if she had just climbed back from hell.

She returned to Blackwell Manor in a daze—only to find the house brightly lit and newly dressed, staff buzzing as they prepared for something.

“What’s going on?” Juliana rasped, catching a housekeeper she recognized.

The servant glanced around nervously before whispering.

“Mrs. Vale, Mr. Blackwell is hosting a birthday banquet for Ms. Hart. She said she likes open-air gardens, so he ordered the Sealed Rose Garden opened. The party will be held there.”

The garden?

Juliana’s heart lurched.

That was where Damien’s mother had jumped to her death.

He had sealed it off ever since, forbidding anyone to enter—not even Juliana, the mistress of the house.

That rusted padlock had kept out the sun… and had sealed away the deepest scar in Damien’s heart.

Yet now, for Lillian, he had unlocked it himself.

Her chest cinched; each breath caught.

Forcing herself to remain calm, Juliana nodded at the servant and went upstairs to her cold, empty room.

She had no interest in a party for someone else, but her balcony looked straight onto the garden.

Standing in the shadows, she became a silent witness—forced to watch the man she loved give someone else everything she had once prayed for.

The man who used to scoff at desserts as “junk food” now bent, smiling, to take the bite of cake Lillian offered.

The man with a severe aversion to physical contact—who wouldn’t even dance at formal events—now held Lillian by the waist, guiding her gracefully across the dance floor, his eyes soft in a way Juliana had never seen.

And the man who always called romance a meaningless game produced a small velvet box—inside lay the Custom Diamond Necklace he had spent millions to acquire—carefully fastening it around Lillian’s neck, his fingertips grazing her skin until her cheeks flushed.

Guests gathered around, whispering among themselves.

“Who is this Ms. Hart? Mr. Blackwell is breaking his own rules for her.”

“Yeah, Mr. Blackwell has been an iceberg for years. That poor Vale girl doted on him for five years and still couldn’t thaw him.”

“Heard she’s just an college student. Mr. Blackwell saved her at an event… must be true love.”

“Tsk, better cozy up to her—looks like Mr. Blackwell will divorce the wife any day now.”

Each word needled into Juliana’s ears.

She couldn’t watch anymore.

She stumbled back into her room, slammed the door shut, and slid down against it as silent tears fell.

She didn’t know how long she stayed there before someone knocked.

Thinking it was a servant with food, she wiped her tears and opened the door.

But standing outside was Lillian, smiling sweetly.

The sight of that malicious smile made Juliana instinctively try to shut the door.

Bang!

Lillian’s hand shot out, bracing the door with surprising strength.

“What do you want?” A rush of unease washed over Juliana.

Lillian’s gaze flicked over her red, swollen eyes, and she chuckled softly.

“Juliana, you saw it all from the balcony, didn’t you? You saw how good Mr. Blackwell is to me? So—still not giving up? Still unwilling to hand over the title of Mrs. Blackwell?”

Juliana’s nails dug painfully into her palms.

That title—she had already given it up.

The Cooling-Off Period just hadn’t passed.

She opened her mouth to say so, but Lillian cut her off, her tone suddenly cold and sharp.

“That’s fine. Since you won’t back down, I’ll make sure you see—with your own eyes—how important I am to Mr. Blackwell.”

Before Juliana could react, Lillian suddenly took several steps back, a strange, resolute smile twisting her lips—then vaulted the third-floor railing and dropped straight down.

Chapter 5

A heavy thud and a chorus of horrified gasps rose from below.

Juliana ran to the railing and looked down—Lillian lay motionless in a pool of blood in the garden.

Chaos erupted instantly.

Damien bolted across the lawn, scooped Lillian into his arms, and shouted for an ambulance.

Then he looked up, his sharp gaze snapping to Juliana’s pale, frozen face.

The fury in his eyes could have shredded her where she stood.

Soon, Lillian was rushed to St. Augustine Medical Center.

And Juliana—branded the “culprit”—was dragged along by the Blackwell Security Team.

Outside the ER, the attending physician came out, face grim.

“Mr. Blackwell, Ms. Hart has severe internal injuries—renal rupture with ongoing hemorrhage. We need a donor immediately, or…”

Damien’s gaze cut to Juliana, venomous.

He didn’t hesitate for even a second.

“Use hers.”

Juliana’s world caved in. She thrashed.

“No! Damien! I didn’t push her—she jumped!”

Damien caught her jaw, fingers digging into her skin so hard she thought her bones might crack.

“She jumped?” His voice was arctic. “So you expect me to believe she tried to kill herself just to frame you? Even a three-year-old wouldn’t buy that. Do you think I would?”

“It’s the truth—please, believe me!” Juliana clutched at his sleeve, tears blurring her vision.

“And I have a bleeding disorder—I can’t donate a kidney! I’ll die!”

Damien pried her fingers off one by one, each motion slow and merciless.

“Then die,” he said, his voice flat—each word a blade.

Juliana froze, her blood turning to ice.

This was the man she had loved for years—and those were the words he chose for her.

In the end, they forced her into surgery.

The cold metal instruments, the blinding surgical lights, the icy rush of anesthesia into her veins.

The last thing she saw before sinking into darkness was Damien’s retreating figure.

When she woke again, she wasn’t in a hospital bed—she was lying on the cold, damp ground at the foot of a mountain.

Not far away, Damien’s black sedan was parked, engine idling.

The window slid down, revealing his profile, beautiful and merciless.

“Lillian is still in a coma because of you,” he said, his voice as cutting as the mountain wind.

“Crawl to the top of Cedar Ridge Chapel—on your knees, step by step—and pray for her life. Bring back a blessing charm for her recovery. If you don’t, Juliana, your family’s company will be buried along with her.”

His words tore open her already shattered heart.

But for the sake of her family, she bit down hard and forced her weak, post-surgery body to obey.

She sank to her knees and began the climb, palms scraping against the cold stone, each step a battle against the pain in her ribs.

She had no idea how long she had been crawling.

Her mind went blank, her body running on nothing but stubborn will.

By the time she reached the chapel, her knees were raw and bleeding, her breath coming in ragged gasps.

She pushed open the heavy wooden door, knelt in front of the altar, and lit a candle with shaking hands, and finally got the blessing charm .

“Please… let her live,” she whispered, before darkness closed in and she collapsed on the cold stone floor.

When she opened her eyes again, she was back in a hospital bed.

There was no one by her side. Only the steady drip of IV fluid keeping her alive.

During those days of recovery, she overheard the Nursing Staff chatting about how Mr. Blackwell practically lived outside Lillian’s room—feeding her water, wiped her down, even smiling when the doctor said she was improving.

Juliana listened, her heart so numb it could no longer shed a single tear.

When she was finally discharged, she went back alone to that cold, empty house.

She began quietly packing her things.

Damien never came home.

The Estate Staff whispered that after bringing Lillian home from the hospital, he’d gone straight to the office to clear the backlog and hadn’t been back since.

They watched Juliana nervously as they spoke, but she was unexpectedly calm.

Whether he came home or not—it didn’t matter anymore.

All she wanted was for the thirty-day cooling-off period to end, so she could leave for good.

Chapter 6

But the storm didn’t let up.

While Damien was away on business, Lillian volunteered to oversee company affairs.

During a key negotiation, she mixed up the core contract.

Instead of apologizing, she snapped when the partner—Mr. Davenport—called her careless, and smashed a wine bottle over his head.

Furious, Mr. Davenport canceled every deal on the spot.

The company lost billions overnight.

Months of work down the drain.

The entire team erupted, demanding Lillian’s dismissal.

But emboldened by Damien’s favor, Lillian refused to leave—and even threatened the staff.

With no other choice, everyone turned to Juliana.

Vale Holdings had invested in the project as well, so Juliana went straight to the company.

She calmed Mr. Davenport, negotiated without letup, and finally secured a new contract.

After stabilizing the crisis, she faced the staff and announced Lillian’s termination.

Lillian panicked.

Right there in front of the staff, she dropped to her knees.

“Juliana! Please, don’t fire me! I know I was wrong—I’ll make it right!”

Juliana looked down at her coldly.

“Make it right? How do you make up for billions in losses? Leave the company. Now.”

Lillian protested weakly.

“It was him—he touched my hand! He tried to harass me, so I—”

One of the employees spoke up immediately.

“Ms. Hart, that was a normal handshake. We’ve worked with him for years—he’s a decent man, never inappropriate.”

Juliana was done with excuses.

She ordered Blackwell Security Team to remove Lillian.

As she was dragged away, Lillian glared back, her teeth clenched.

“Juliana! Aren’t you afraid Mr. Blackwell will make you pay for this?!”

Juliana’s voice was calm.

“I believe he values this company—the one he’s poured years of effort into—more than he values you.”

Lillian was finally gone.

The staff cheered, pouring out their grievances about how she had been throwing her weight around.

Juliana reassured them, handled the follow-up work, then went home exhausted.

But she had barely set foot in the house when Damien stormed in, fury radiating off him.

“Juliana! Who gave you the right to fire Lillian?!”

Juliana forced herself to stay calm and recounted everything—Lillian’s mistake, the billions lost, and how she had salvaged the deal.

She thought that even if Damien favored Lillian, he’d draw the line at risking the company.

But his reaction chilled her to the bone.

“So she lost one deal—so what? Who told you to act on your own? She’s new. Mistakes happen. Why didn’t you teach her?”

Juliana’s voice trembled with disbelief.

“That was a multi-billion-dollar project, Damien! The entire team worked for months—and it concerns the partnership between our families!”

“Then cancel it.”

Without hesitation, Damien pulled out his phone, called Mr. Davenport, and terminated every deal with Vale Holdings.

“From this day forward, all collaboration between Blackwell Group and Vale Holdings is over.”

Juliana felt as if someone had stabbed her straight through the heart.

Vale Holdings relied heavily on those projects…

Damien hung up and advanced on her step by step.

“Now. Tell me where you sent Lillian.”

“I only fired her—I don’t know where she went!”

“Still lying?”

He shoved his phone in her face.

On the screen was Lillian’s last text message:

Lillian: [Mr. Blackwell, I’m sorry… Juliana fired me and had me sent away. I can’t stay by your side anymore… Take care.]

Juliana’s hands shook with rage as she read the shameless words.

“I really don’t know where she is!”

“Fine. Let’s see how long you can keep lying.”

Damien’s eyes turned lethal.

“Guards! Take her to the basement.”

The Basement Dungeon was damp and dark.

Juliana was strapped to a chair.

On Damien’s order, they smeared her with sticky honey, then opened a box swarming with fire ants.

“Ah—!”

The insects poured over her skin, biting until her body burned.

The pain was blinding.

“Where is she?” Damien stood at the door, watching coldly.

“I don’t know… I really don’t know… please… let me go…”

Juliana screamed herself raw, but Damien didn’t move.

She was left like that for an entire day and night.

By morning, her skin was a map of swollen welts and bloody bites.

When Damien came to see her again, she was barely conscious.

His voice was still cold as ice.

“Still won’t talk?”

Juliana could only shake her head, tears running hot.

He finally lost patience.

“Break every bone in her body,” he ordered flatly.

“One by one—until she talks.”

Chapter 7

The cold iron rod struck her over and over.

Each time a bone snapped, white-hot agony ripped through her until she blacked out—only to be shocked awake by a bucket of ice water.

“Where is Lillian?”

“…”

By the time the seventh bone broke, her vision had gone hazy.

Through the blur, she stared at the man she had loved for so many years and summoned the last of her strength.

“Damien… do you really… have to be this cruel?”

Damien crouched down, gripping her chin, his gaze cruel and mocking.

“When you married me for money, you already knew what kind of man I am? Regret it now?”

Her whole body ached with agony, but her heart hurt even more.

She wanted to scream at him that she hadn’t married him for money;

She had married him because she loved him.

Because she had been foolish enough to love him for years.

And now all she had left was regret.

Regret for ever loving him.

Just as the guards were about to strike again, Lucas burst into the room.

“Mr. Blackwell! We found Ms. Hart—she’s at a Countryside Lodge on the outskirts. But she refuses to come back. She says she was fired and can’t face anyone…”

Damien immediately dropped Juliana like dead weight, yanked her upright.

“You’re coming with me to apologize. You’re going to beg her to come back.”

Juliana’s body resisted on instinct.

Damien’s lips curled into a cold smile.

“Vale Holdings has lost its contracts, hasn’t it? Your cash flow is nearly broken. If you don’t go, I’ll cut you off completely—watch your family drown in bankrupt.”

Despair hollowed her out.

Like a rag doll, she was dragged to the lodge.

When Lillian saw Juliana—bruised, battered, barely standing—her eyes flashed with triumph before the mask of innocence slid back into place.

Even after Juliana apologized, Lillian still refused to return.

“I know Juliana apologized,” she said softly, “but everyone at the company must hate me. After all, I’m just an assistant…”

To reassure her, Damien made a decision that stunned the entire room.

He signed a Stock Transfer Agreement on the spot, gifting Lillian ten percent of his shares in Blackwell Group—worth billions.

“These shares will have your back. From now on, no one in the company will dare slight you,” Damien’s voice was rich with indulgence.

Lillian’s eyes shone with joy.

She made a show of refusing a few times before “reluctantly” accepting.

Watching this scene, Juliana felt only nausea and bitter irony.

She could no longer stay there.

She left alone, dragging her broken body away.

She had her wounds treated at the hospital, stayed a few days, then went home and kept packing her bags, waiting for the thirty-day cooling-off period to end.

That day, Damien returned unexpectedly.

“Today is my grandfather’s birthday banquet,” he told her.

“You’re coming. He’s been asking to see you.”

It was the very last day of the cooling-off period.

Remembering how Mr. Blackwell Sr. had always looked after her, Juliana finally nodded.

When she got into the car, she found Lillian already there.

“Mr. Blackwell said today was your grandfather’s birthday,” Lillian said shyly, “so he asked me to accompany him as his assistant…”

Juliana said nothing, staring out the window in silence.

When they arrived at the Blackwell Estate, Mr. Blackwell Sr. called Damien and Juliana upstairs first.

In the Executive Study, the old man looked at them both and sighed.

“Damien, I once thought you’d never move past your mother’s death…

But I heard you disposed of all those snakes recently?”

He turned to Juliana with a smile of relief.

“Seems you’ve finally reached him.”

Juliana’s heart ached.

Mr. Blackwell Sr. didn’t know—those snakes had been killed for someone else.

Chapter 8

Then Mr. Blackwell Sr. began to list all the things Juliana had done for Damien over the years.

“When your stomach trouble was at its worst—when you were up all night in pain—who stood outside your door, silent, just listening to make sure you weren’t alone in it? It was Juliana. She secretly went to see an old physician, learned massage techniques until her fingers were raw and red from the herbal oil—just so she could rub your stomach when you curled up in pain, so it would ease even a little.”

“And when your stress was at its peak two years ago, shut in the study day and night—she watched you grow thinner. Worried sick but afraid to disturb you, she hid in the kitchen, clumsily following a recipe to make herbal broth. She burned her hands, blistered them more than once—never a word—and the bowl she set outside your door… do you know how many times she ruined it before she got it right?”

“And you? You never even taste it—just told your assistant to throw it out.”

“Damien, nothing is rarer than sincere affection. Start cherishing the girl.”

Damien’s brows knitted tighter with every word.

He had never noticed the small things—never realized how much Juliana had done for him behind the scenes.

When they left the Executive Study, he glanced at her, something complicated edging in his tone.

“Juliana… do you like me?”

Juliana stopped in her tracks, ready to answer.

But Damien cut her off, his voice dropping into a warning.

“Don’t ever fall in love with me.

Our marriage is nothing more than a business arrangement.

There will never be love.

And once my grandfather—”

He didn’t finish the sentence, but Juliana understood.

Once Mr. Blackwell Sr. was gone, Damien would marry Lillian.

Juliana raised her head, her gaze steady to the point of cold.

“Don’t worry. Whatever I felt before—starting today, I won’t anymore.”

Something quick and sharp flashed in Damien’s chest—an unfamiliar discomfort.

But he ignored it and went downstairs to find Lillian.

Moments later, a scream—then a heavy crash—ripped through the house.

Juliana ran downstairs and saw the massive crystal chandelier lying shattered on the marble floor.

Damien was out cold beneath it, Lillian shielded in his arms.

The scene was chaos.

Damien was rushed to St. Augustine Medical Center for emergency surgery.

As his legal spouse, Juliana signed the consent forms.

The surgery went smoothly, but he stayed under anesthesia.

The doctor advised overnight observation by a family member.

Juliana looked at Damien’s pale face, but her heart felt like still water.

She turned to leave.

Lillian’s red-rimmed eyes blinked in surprise.

“Juliana, aren’t you going to stay until Mr. Blackwell wakes up?”

Juliana didn’t stop walking.

“The first person he’ll want to see is you. Stay. And when he wakes, tell him… I’ll give him a gift he’ll be most.”

“A gift?” Lillian was puzzled.

Juliana didn’t explain.

She went straight to the County Court Clerk’s Office and picked up the Divorce Decree.

Then she returned to Blackwell Manor, packed the last of her things, and carefully set the decree inside an elegant Gift Box—leaving it on the coffee table, where no one could miss it.

When all was done, she pulled her suitcase behind her, and walked out of the house she had lived in for three years without looking back.

At the hospital, Damien finally woke.

The first face he saw was Lillian’s, tear-stained and pitiful.

He glanced around, frowning.

Odd.

Even with a mild cold, Juliana used to sit bedside and nag him without end.

“Where’s Juliana?” he asked before he could stop himself.

Lillian’s eyes dimmed.

“She left after your surgery… Mr. Blackwell, do you want to see her? If you do, I can leave right now so she can take care of you…”

Seeing her on the verge of tears, Damien suppressed the strange feeling in his chest.

“No. I just don’t want you worn out. These things… Juliana used to handle.”

“I can learn,” Lillian said softly.

Damien said nothing more.

A few days later, she accompanied him back to Blackwell Manor to recover.

When the front door opened, the house felt oddly empty.

His gaze caught on the Gift Box on the coffee table.

Lillian’s eyes lit up as if remembering.

“Oh! Before Juliana left, she said she’d give you a gift you’d like the most. This must be it! Open it!”

An unexplainable irritation pricked at him.

Juliana was always playing these pointless games.

He had never liked her gifts.

He yanked the ribbon loose and opened the lid.

Inside was nothing he had expected—just a thick, court-stamped document.

The bold title at the top leapt off the page like a verdict, searing straight into his vision:

My current apartment building is infested with German cockroaches and myself and my partner finally signed a lease for a new place start of next month. I'm packing everything very carefully. Inspecting and cleaning every item and using plastic bins instead of cardboard, putting clothes, linens and plushies in plastic bags then the plastic bins. I've thrown out quite a few of our belongings already. We aren't even keeping any of our living room couches/chairs. 

Here's my dilemma and problem. We are only keeping three pieces of wooden furniture. Coffee table, tv stand and my large vintage china cabinet. The coffee table and tv stand appear fine and have no traces of the roaches. My china cabinet is a different story. 

I've been keeping it clean and using Diatomaceous earth in the cabinet which has seemed to help. I finally got some bubble wrap and cleared out all my fine china, getting to inspect the inside more clearly. I saw two or three large roaches and some dead baby roaches and a couple old hatched eggs that were hidden in my dishes. I also looked on top and saw a few of the bugs hanging out and I was able to kill them. So along with Diatomaceous earth, my partner is going to put roach bait into all the parts of the cabinet to help. 

My worry is because of the type of old wood and amount of cracks in the wood, if I should just cut my losses, or if there is something else I can do to avoid bringing roaches by keeping my china cabinet. Any help would be appreciated. 

For reference I live in Canada and a lot of pesticides that actually work are banned here. ",1,1760661511.0,movingout,0,1.0,False

Not exactly how I pictured turning twenty-three.

A TV flickered in front of me, hooked up to an ancient VCR playing… Bluey?

Didn't my little cousin used to watch it? 

A modern cartoon fighting to survive on a thirty year old TV was enough to bring me fully back to reality. I straightened in the chair, mentally checking myself over. 

All limbs intact, but bound. 

Something snapped inside me as hysteria set in. My breaths became sharp pants, then wheezes. Stars exploded across my vision, like TV static. I tried to scream, but my lips wouldn’t part. Duct tape. 

I forced myself to focus on breathing deep through my nose, on the flickering TV, on anything but my predicament. Bluey. 

The TV was struggling, the image fuzzy, modern colors barely bleeding through the old grainy aspect ratio. 

Leaning forward, I tried to watch it, but the cartoon was on mute. 

Every so often the screen would go black, the TV giving out, before restarting.

But why Bluey?

Movement beside me, and I realized I wasn’t alone. A figure was strapped to a chair, eyes unblinking, watching the screen.

Like swimming against a riptide, recognition came slowly. Painfully.

Popped collar, tie, lanyard. Thick, bloodstained blonde curls fell over vacant, half-lidded eyes that fixed on the TV. 

I thought he was dead, until his jaw ticked under his own gag; he was trying to speak. 

His head lolled like a drowsy toddler, flopping forward just as the screen flashed. 

Pale blue light illuminated a coin-sized hole drilled into his skull. I could see pink fluid leaking out of it, streaming down the back of his shirt. My stomach twisted. 

His name caught in my throat, bile choking me as footsteps sounded from behind. 

A figure loomed, and white swirled in the air. 

I blinked. 

Steam?

“Do you want some coffee?” 

The voice sliced through the silence. Dark blonde curls were yanked back. 

“No? But I know *just* how you like it! Two sugars, one cream, and a half pump of caramel! Didn't I get your order right, *buddy*?”

That nasally squawk was unmistakable.

The figure let the boy's head flop forward, and slowly poured the scalding drink over his face. 

I didn’t see the cup, but my gaze jerked up when I heard the horrifying hiss of steam. He didn't move. I screamed, my body jerking, heart in my throat. 

But my the guy didn’t even blink, thick brown coffee grounds meeting blood, culminating and seeping down his temple. 

His body swayed slightly, head inclined, eyes never leaving the TV. 

Movement to my left sent shivers sliding down my spine. Another figure. This time my cry came out raw and wrong, tearing from my scorched throat. 

His restraints hung loose, barely keeping him in the chair. 

In the flickering light, the ruined shape of his skull glimmered into view, thick red sludge trailing down his neck. My body recoiled before I could think, my chest tightening, my thoughts spinning out of control. 

Was that what had happened to me? 

Throwing myself forward, I felt it, a sharp, tugging sensation at the back of my skull. My stomach heaved, vomit searing my raw throat. 

My eyes darted between my companions. I *knew* them. 

I knew who they were, of course I fucking did.

So why couldn’t I say their names? 

Tears pricked my eyes, relief sliding down my cheeks. 

Why did their names sit like rot on my tongue, like alphabet soup, tangled, wrong and shapeless? Names that felt foreign, names that didn’t feel like names at all. 

Why were my thoughts weightless? 

Hollow? 

Numb? 

Like every memory, every splinter of them clinging on to me was being drained. 

I tried to speak, to let their names roll off my tongue, but they jammed in my throat.

The second figure’s head tilted, eyes fixed on the screen. His mouth wasn’t gagged, just stretched into a wide, childlike grin. 

Something glowed behind us.

Three pulsing green lights.

A computer? I tried to twist around, but part of me didn’t want to know. 

Wires lay tangled at my feet, snaking across the floor. 

The faint hum of something crawled into the back of my skull. What was it?

“See, Violet?” A voice boomed through the silence as a figure stepped in front of the TV.

The two figures didn’t move, though they did make small noises of protest. 

I thought they were waking up. Hope ignited. 

Stupid hope. 

Naive fucking hope. 

But then I noticed the guy to my left craning his neck, trying to see the TV screen, and the realization hit me. 

He was blocking Bluey. 

His face was mostly swallowed by shadow, but that smug grin cut through the darkness. He knelt before me, reaching out hesitantly at first, fingers brushing across my cheeks to wipe away my tears. 

Then he gestured toward the others, lips curling into a knowing smirk. 

“I hate to say I told you so, but I did tell you those two weren’t interested.”

To prove it, he shuffled away from the TV, and the two men stopped jerking against the ropes that pinned them down, their sharp squawks bleeding into muffled moans. Their names. I had to know them. 

I knew splinters. Digging deep down, I tried to hold onto what was being torn away. I knew cooked meals, Mario Kart parties, and drinks clinking together. 

I knew warm, sheepish smiles, thick blonde and mouse-brown hair. I knew panic attacks in the back of a car, soft brown curls between my knees. 

I knew fast-food drive-thrus at 3am. Shameless sex overlooking city lights, laptop screens, bustling cafeterias. Fights. 
Laughter. Crying. Screams. Parties. Birthday candles. Sex we wanted to label too fast. 

Sex we didn’t want to label at all. 

I knew their warmth, their heavy breaths against my lips. 

I knew their pain. Their panic. Their fear. Twin smiles dripping with irony and warmth. The three of us against the world with our stupid fucking game.

Sharp, agonizing pain erupted behind my eyes, my body jerking, my nerve endings burning, my wrists straining against the tape. Blood trickled from my nose, slicking my lips.  And then, momentary clarity: an office, a coffee machine, hands entangled with mine. They were warm, safe. Home.

But clarity tasted like blood. 

Clarity twisted my gut. 

Clarity was too bright, too empty, a cavernous hole growing smaller and smaller. 

“Violet.”

His voice snapped me back to pale light flickering in gleaming eyes. 

His fingers traced the back of my skull. “Pay attention.”

A screech tore from my throat when that warmth, that comfort, that feeling of home was ripped from me. He was taking them away. Laughter collapsed into echoes. 

Voices bled into noise. My head jerked back, leaving only an empty memory, two shadows, and a brittle, ice-cold chill running through me. 

The memories were being violently yanked away, piece by piece, leaving behind two nameless, faceless shells staring back. 

One helpless thought lingered, and I clung on, savoring it. 

I loved them. That was all I knew. 

I blinked rapidly, fighting the grueling drain pulling them away. It wasn’t until I swallowed my denial that reality hit. 

He was going to take all of them, physically carving their brains from their skulls and mentally cherry-picking them from my mind. 

“See?” he laughed, snapping my focus back to him. He gripped my chin, jerking my face toward his. Leaning close, his breath tickled my skin. I knew who he was. 

I knew his name. That was the worst part. I knew everything about this asshole. 

While they, the ones who mattered, the ones I fucking loved, the ones I couldn’t fucking remember, were bleeding away with every pulsing blink of that green light. 

Every painful jerk of the thing rooted inside my head, hollowing me out. 

“Who would’ve thought they’d be more interested in Bluey than you?” 

His smile widened and he leaned down, pressing a kiss to my lips. 

Even in the dull glow of the TV, I could see red blooming across his cheeks. 

He trembled, unsure where to place his right hand, while his left groped my breast. When he finally pulled back, his smile twisted with sick pleasure. 

Starving eyes raked me up and down, and another memory hit. Painful. Violent. 

Too empty to register, already being purged from my brain. “I guess you didn’t know them as well as you thought you did.” he sighed, took two steps back, and ripped the tape off my mouth with a single swipe.

Bathed in the cartoon’s light, shadows danced across his face; my kidnapper’s eyes darkened and his lips curved. 

He grabbed his own chair, set it in front of me, and sat. 

“You get one question,” he said, seemingly enjoying my recoil as he shifted his chair closer. His clinical precision and finality in his tone sent me into hysterics. 

I didn't realize I was wailing until he slapped me, cold, hard, stinging. I reeled back; the cry collapsed in my throat. He stroked my hair. “It won't be long now, Violet. Almost there.”

His fingers traced my lips. 

“Once the process is complete, I will personally dismember you.” He gave a sheepish shrug when my whole body went still. The world tilted, wrong and distant, as if I'd fallen backward. I couldn't scream. 

Couldn't move. 

Couldn't breathe. 

At that moment I didn't know the date or the time. 

I was trapped in this room, in an oblivion where time didn't exist; and I was going to fucking die. His mouth opened, and words slid out. But they were white noise. Shapeless. 

“I know! I don't want to cut you up either, but it's how I hide the evidence. I'm going to cut you up, liquefy you, and give you back to the earth.” He grinned.

“Which is fitting, given your name.” His smile twisted. “It's weird.” He came close again, nose to nose with me, breath to breath. I pulled back, and he cupped my cheeks, forcing me to face him. 

“Violets have always been my favorite plant.” The man leaned back, eyes glinting. “I never realized they were so fucking poisonous.”

Breathing was suddenly so hard. Was I breathing? 

My breaths were wrong, shuddery, barely breaths at all. 

“Please.” It was all I could choke out, a helpless, pathetic sob dripping from my mouth. My memories told me I wasn’t like this. I wasn’t a fucking pushover. I didn’t give in this easily. One question, he said.

One answer.

“What are you doing to them?” I chose my question carefully.

That seemed to strike a nerve.

“Why?” His expression twitched. “Do you know who they are?” He straightened, and I drank in the room for the first time. Cold and concrete, like a tomb. *My* tomb.

“No.”

But I wanted to.

I swallowed that bit down.

He shrugged. “I'm not killing them, if that's what you think,” he said. “I'm using them.”

“Using them?” 

“Yeah.” He stepped in front of guy number one. Coffee. 

That was all he was to me: coffee, blood, and brains dripping down his temples. 

No identity. 

No recognition beyond a hollow stranger whose name was rotting on my tongue. 

But somewhere deep down, trying to reach him, his memory smelled of coffee. 

Rich roasted coffee beans and fresh cupcakes. 

I watched my kidnapper prod the man’s face. Nothing. 

No spark, no light behind his eyes. “It probably looks scary from your point of view, Violet,” he said, voice calm. Patronising. 

“I’m sure you don’t even know how to extract organic consciousness from a living human source via brainwaves.”

He sighed, loud and exaggerated. 

I tried again. “Those lights,” I said. “What are they?”

His head jerked, almost like he'd been waiting for that question. 

“They're *you*,” he said. “Well, right now, only two downloads are in progress.”

What are you talking about?” I whispered. This was madness. 

Insanity. 

He turned to me, adjusting his glasses on the bridge of his nose. “Their bodies are currently unresponsive, but this is a typical trauma response to cranial penetration.""

""Right now, Violet, I’m extracting their neural patterns, mapping their synapses, every thought and every memory. 

""Their cognitive architecture is being replicated, byte by byte, while they…” 

He snapped his fingers in front of their unblinking eyes. “I guess you could say they are napping.”

I swallowed bile. “They're dead.”

“Officially?” Twisting around, he shot me a grin. “I could give you a more precise explanation, but it’s way too advanced for a mind of *your* calibre. Let’s stick with a simple playground analogy.” 

He ran his fingers through Coffee’s hair. “Think of the brain as a road and neurons are the cars. It can’t function until traffic clears, and right now there’s a fifteen thousand car pile-up.”

Wrenching Coffee’s head back was a demonstration. 

The man’s lips parted, a hollow groan escaping him. 

“...uhhhh…”

He let go. “I told you,” my kidnapper said, and Coffee’s head fell limp, rolling onto his shoulder, drool pooling at the corner of his mouth. “They never wanted to fuck you.”

“I don't know them.”

“Well, yeah,” his tone darkened. “They brainwashed you to stop liking me, Violet.”

My restraints were two strips of duct tape pinning my hands tied down . Keeping him talking would distract him. I wrenched my left wrist.

 “So, what are you planning to do to them?” I asked, keeping my voice steady, twisting my wrist against the chafing tape. “You do realize that’s pseudoscience, right? There’s no way to copy a living consciousness onto a hard drive,” I gritted out. “It’s science fiction.”

“Maybe,” he said, his back still turned. I timed his movements with my own breaths, waiting for him to fully turn away before pulling my other wrist free and leaping to my feet. 

I tore my ankles loose and bounded forward blindly. But something held me, something wrenched me *back*. 

No! 

My trembling fingers traced the back of my head, where a gaping hole had been carved into my skull. No. I pulled again, but whatever held me was merciless. Cruel. 

It had dug all the way inside me, hollowing me out. My fingertips grazed bone, raw and slick. No. No. No. I couldn’t die like this. I wouldn’t die like this. 

I wrenched forward. This was what had taken them away from me. Another tug sent a wave of electroshocks through me. 

I had to get it out.

A ragged scream ripped from my throat as I plunged my fingers into the hollow where my skull should’ve been, clawing for the foreign thing buried inside. 

My knees buckled. 

White-hot pain cracked through me. The world spun, blinding and wrong, and unreal. I felt myself fall, felt my body hit the floor, felt my head crack against concrete. A face flashed. Just a face. 

Just a smile. Warm brown eyes. Freckles.

My mouth parted. Agony exploded, contorting my limbs. Memories flared, sharper now, as the cruel edge of the object cut deeper, slicing right through me.

Brighter. Closer. 

The deeper memories. 

The ones he hadn't found yet.

Late-night talks. 

Locked doors. 

Closed curtains.

Lips meeting mine. 

Laughter. 

Distant, but as my mind collapsed, it felt closer. 

Voices. 

*“Do you trust me?”*

Water. Blue, sparkling water. 

Kicking legs. Splashing.

Faces that were less shadowy, their features beginning to bleed through—

“Violet!”

His voice snapped me out of it.

I was lying in warm red, my eyes flickering, blood spilling from my mouth.

I wanted to go back.

Back to warm water beneath a blistering sun. 

Back to laughter that suddenly felt familiar. 

Back to names on my tongue, exploding, vivid, real.

“Violet, what did you do?”

I blinked. Reality was cold concrete. Waiting to die. Waiting for my brains to leak out of my ears. He towered over me, expression unreadable. Slowly, he knelt.

“Oh, Violet,” he whispered, his shaking hands slick with wet warmth. He gently patted my head. “Look what you’ve done.”

His voice trembled somewhere deep in my mind as the world tilted. 

I felt him lift my head into his lap, his fingers stroking my hair. The pulsing green light drew closer, glowing brighter until it was all I could see. 

It expanded, shimmering, bleeding into vivid blues and greens.

Like staring at a BIOS screen. 

His fingers worked quickly, feeding something into my skull.

Sharp. Cruel. 

I couldn't move, my limbs were stuck. Paralysed. 

My mouth opened, but no sound came out. 

“Don’t worry. I’m going to fix you.” His voice collapsed into a wet, shuddering sob.

 “I can make you permanent. So we can be together.” His lips found my ear as I fought for air, my lungs squeezing, my breaths thinning. “I can make it so you live forever, Violet. Isn’t that what you want?”

No.

Instead of clinging to reality, to the ice-cold, to the agony, I reached out, upward, until I was touching warmth. 

Warmth that glowed. 

Warmth that smelled like coffee.

Warmth that—

…

Being a game developer was never something I planned. It just kind of happened.

As a kid, like every other kid, I wanted to be a princess.

But then I discovered video games.

The Sims was one of my first loves. I spent hours on my family computer, intricately designing my perfect household. I was a quiet child. I had friends, but I preferred The Sims to playing outside.

I never cared much about decoration or the house as a whole, probably because trying to decorate made my brain hurt. 

Other kids didn’t seem to have this problem. 

The kids in my class spent hours, days, even weeks building the perfect house. 

Architects in the making. 

I tried, but the second I started moving things around, trying and failing to build a room or placing a shower the wrong way, my ADHD brain went into meltdown, and I clicked off.

I liked playing The Sims, not spending half a day building a mansion. 

I usually settled for the basics: a sofa, a bed, a bathroom, and a wardrobe. The Sims was my childhood.

As I grew up, other games started to surface, different genres, different stories, but most fell under my radar.

Minecraft. But again, it was building. I hated building. I couldn’t last five minutes before growing impatient and bored with the sandbox.

The Last of Us. 

Very different from The Sims, but the only game I could actually beat. 

The world and story inspired my own fiction. 

It was cinematic, Naughty Dog’s way of saying, “Hey! We’re not just known for that Bandicoot game!”

Until Dawn. 

Another masterpiece. 

I fell in love with the characters and the setting, wanting to replicate it. 

I wanted to rewrite the story my way, create the world my way. By high school, I was playing games not to play them, but to rewrite them in my head. I analyzed the world, the characters, their motivations, their chemistry, why they did what they did.

After writing an unprompted essay on character building in games, arguing that Joel from The Last of Us was the best character ever, I realized I wanted to make games. 

Not necessarily the ones I grew up with, but the kinds of games I wanted to play myself. I didn’t want to build them. 

The building was for the guys with zero social life and basement dwellers who didn’t have a crippling Adderall addiction.

I wanted to write them.

Then came the cozy era of games: Life is Strange, Undertale, Stardew Valley. 

By then, I was in college studying Game Design, Interactive Narratives, and Game Development.  

I was offered a job at an indie game studio right after college, joining as a writer.

On my first day, I expected to stroll in and immediately start writing masterpieces.

I wasn’t prepared for a room full of gawky, just-out-of-college guys with dark circles under their eyes and zero social skills. The office had a hierarchy, just like high school: 

Game devs in the furthest corner ignoring everyone, narrative writers huddled near the coffee machine, and script writers clustered around the table. 

My official job was narrative writing. The other writers were cliquey, already established friends in their early-thirties, with judgmental eyes and Harry Potter stickers plastered on their laptops. 

They lamented over BTS fanfiction and, I was pretty sure, definitely talked shit about me behind my back.

Then there was Greta, a middle-aged, motherly type with rainbow pigtails who typed like a psychopath. 

Her idea of humor was tossing a cereal bar in my face and shooing me to my desk. Apparently, I wasn't the only newbie. 

Just when I thought things couldn’t get any more awkward, our team was dragged into a “meeting” that turned out to be an ice-breaker game. 

We stood in a barely adequate circle and tossed a beanbag to each other while introducing ourselves. 

The thing about having colleagues is, nobody is there to socialize. 

I quickly realized this after learning everyone's names. 

Steffy, Annalise, and Nara were the cliquey thirty year olds on my team. 

Tom and Ben were the “popular” devs, already with several mobile games. 

Greta. Fifty four with an adult daughter she mentioned only seventy-five times a day. 

Eli, a programmer. He smiled at me during the ice-breaker, but kept his head down. 
 
Finally, a dev who introduced himself by sheepishly plucking a ballpoint out of his pocket. He didn’t talk to anyone except Eli, and looked uncomfortable when I tried making small talk in the elevator.

So much for making friends.

I spent most of my time at my desk or the coffee machine. 

Eli came over sometimes to talk, but after catching him with his hand shoved down his pants under his desk, I kept my distance. 

The problem was, Eli didn’t seem to get the hint. 

He asked me out when we went for coffee, and I said, “I've actually got plans tonight.”

Eli nodded and smiled, and asked me the exact same thing the following morning, running into me as I climbed out of my car. 

I said no. Again. 

Steffy, one of the girls, noticed him cornering me in the empty office at lunch, and didn’t say a word.

Work became suffocating. Eli was there every morning, two inches from my face, asking me to dinner. 

When I finished my work at the end of the day, he waited until I started to log off. 

Then he would log off, too. “Wow, what a coincidence, Violet!” he said, brushing past me on his way out. Behind us, Nara and Tom were huddled over a project. “We should walk home together!” 

Eli reached for me, his trembling hand trying to wrap around my wrist. 

Tom glanced up, noticed Eli’s grip, then smiled faintly, and looked away. 

Nobody fucking cared.

Or they did, they just didn’t want to care.

Eli started leaving me gifts on my desk: teddies, candy, candles.

When I moved desks, so did he, tripping over himself to carry his stuff to the one next to me. I started leaving early, and then so did he, pretending to be ill.

“Violet,” he’d lean over me while I typed, boiling breath tickling the back of my neck. “Do you want to hang out tonight?”

“I can’t,” I said, my throat on fire. “I have—”

“Tomorrow?” he said, leaning closer. “What about Saturday?”

“I have plans.”

Eli didn’t budge when I tried to sidestep him. Instead, he leaned in, his voice dropping low. 

“I’ve been around long enough to notice my colleagues’ quirks,” he murmured. 

“Tom bites his thumb when he’s nervous. Nara zones out whenever Greta talks. And Penn… he’s basically an iPad baby if you leave him alone in a room.” 

Closer.  His breath brushed my ear. “I couldn’t help noticing, did you know you clench your fists when you’re lying?”

He lingered, as if enjoying the shiver down my spine, then turned and walked away.

After a while, I realized why Eli’s behavior was being ignored.

“Oh, Eli?” Nara nearly choked on her coffee when I mentioned his name. 

Nara was one of those girls who was like, FINE, I'll sit with you, when her clique was missing. She leaned across the table during lunch, her usual playful expression darkened. “His dad owns this place. Don’t ever fuck with Eli.”

Nara laughed, and I tried to swallow the coffee creeping back up my throat.

One year into my job, I was on the verge of quitting. Work had become torture. 

But it was my job. 

My money. My life. Eli made me feel small, like it was only the two of us in the room, and I was trapped. Paralyzed.

I stopped wearing dresses after he kept brushing past me, pressing against me. 

I stopped tying my hair up when he tugged my ponytail, like it was playful. 

By the time I was at my year marker, I was mentally exhausted. 

Always scared. I  couldn't  concentrate on my work. 

I clocked in, already suffocated by his dancing shadow. 

“Hey, Violet,” Eli said. He pulled out his ID card and clocked in with a swift swipe and a sugary grin. “You look beautiful today.”

I kept my gaze ahead, ignoring him, and pushed through the doors into the studio, making a beeline for the coffee machine. 

Flowers were already arranged in front of my desk in perfect formation. Violets. 

I grabbed a cup, my hands trembling, added coffee, knocking milk everywhere. Shit. 

I reached for a cloth, my face burning, my heart in my throat, my stomach twisting. 

Tears ran down my cheeks, and I swiped them away. The thought was already choking my mind, sitting on my tongue:

I can't do this.  I swiped at seeping milk, my throat tight. I can't do this anymore.

“Can you hurry up?”

One of the devs loomed over my shoulder, hands shoved into his pockets. The kid who introduced himself with a ballpoint pen. 

Thick brown hair and freckles, his lanyard neatly tucked between his tie and button-down. 

The guy avoided everyone and sat in his own corner. 

In meetings, he looked like he was dozing off, head bowed.

Whenever I glanced at him on workdays, he was bent over his computer, chin on his fist, fingers tapping furiously at his mouse, eyes glued to his computer. 

I thought he was working until I passed him on the way to the copy machine and he let out a guttural cry, slamming his head onto his desk.

He was playing Jump King. 

Presently, the guy was frowning at me like a kicked puppy. “Move.” The developer shooed me aside and set down a cup. 

The coffee maker hummed softly, and my chest ached. I could already sense Eli waiting to pounce, waiting for the perfect moment to run his hands down my back and claim he did it with everyone. I stepped back, bracing myself to return to my desk, to Eli, to pretend once again that I loved his gifts. So thoughtful. So sweet. 

*Wow, Eli, these are amazing, but I really can’t hang out.* The words dripped from my tongue like bile.

Maybe I'd fucking hang myself at lunch. 

I wasn’t expecting the dev to whirl around, handing me fresh coffee.

“Here you go! Hope you like mocha, because, uh,” he whistled, laughing, “thaaat’s all we’ve got.”

I blinked, startled, nearly dropping it. “Thanks.”

He grinned, spun around, and poured himself a cup, his lips brushing the rim. “Do you trust me?”

Something surprising crept up my throat. Laughter. Hysteria. Somehow, I was smiling, and I wasn't acting to play a role, to fit in, to satisfy ego. I was really smiling. 

I folded my arms, playing it cool. I wasn't used to someone starting a conversation. 

Unless it was Eli, and I had to rethink every fucking word. 
“Do I trust a man who gave himself a concussion two days ago from playing a video game?”

His eyebrow quirked, confidence depleting. He blushed bright red, and I laughed harder. Laughing, I realized, made it so much easier to breathe. “Wait.” He groaned, head tipping back. “You saw that?” 

“Everyone saw that!” I didn't realize I was laughing until I heard myself. 

He stared down at his shoes. “Not my proudest moment.” His gaze flickered to me, lips curling into a smirk. “Do you know how to get rid of pests?”

Before I could answer, he gently took my arm and guided me toward my desk, close enough to feel intimate but not crossing any boundaries. 

The scent of his cologne teased my nose as he leaned in, lips curling into a playful smile. That’s when I saw it, a bluish bruise smack between his eyes. I had to bite my lip to suppress a childish snicker.

“I had a great time last night, Violet,” he said, loud enough for Eli to hear. I knew his game immediately. “Same time tonight?” 

He pulled back, winking like we were in a damn rom-com. I thought he was going to kiss me before his lips found my ear instead. The guy was laughing, his body electric against mine, trembling with giggles. “My place.”

Play along, his eyes told me. 

So, I did.

“Sounds good,” I hesitated before pecking him on the cheek. “I'll see you tonight.” 

This guy definitely thought he was the main character. “You betcha.”

And scene.

I didn’t even know his name. I only recognized a few of the devs, and I kept mixing them up. 

Somehow, I found myself a little starstruck. His cologne lingered in the air, phantom breath still tickling the back of my neck. He returned to his desk, shoulders shaking with laughter, and I sank into my seat. The violets had been quietly removed. Eli was gone, and suddenly my morning felt brighter.

I thought it was a one-off thing. The guy was probably just being sympathetic, and my mascara was definitely running down my face at the coffee machine.

But then he slid into the seat across from me at lunch, tray in hand. For a small indie company, the place was massive, with checkerboard windows, a swimming pool, and a cafeteria the size of a lecture hall. They really took care of their staff. I was already too aware of Eli watching me struggle to swallow my noodles when the dev joined me, immediately reaching over to snatch my cookie.

“So, about that date,” he said, taking a bite and spraying crumbs everywhere. “I’ve already booked us movie tickets.” The guy reached over to shake my hand. “Name’s Penn, by the way.”

I must have looked horrified, because he burst into giggles and then almost choked, slapping a hand over his mouth. 

“I’m kidding,” he said between laughs, shooting me a grin. I kicked him under the table. He feigned pain, then went back to demolishing his sandwich. The guy was a messy eater.

Penn rested his chin on his fist, warm brown eyes raking me up and down. 

“Do you always look like a deer caught in headlights, or is that just a today thing?”

I didn’t answer. Asshole. He smirked, swiping mayo off his chin.

“Oh, shit. Right.” His eyes flicked toward Eli’s looming shadow behind us, his voice dropping into a dramatic hiss. “You’re being stalked.”

“He's driving me insane,” I whispered. 

“Who, Eli?” Penn took another bite, chewing loudly. He finished the sandwich, drained his coffee, and leaned forward. “Once again. How do you get rid of pests?” 

“Bug spray?” I pushed my tray away. I wasn't hungry anymore.

“Pissing them off,” Penn said, lips curling into a grin. “So, from a completely fictional situationship that’s absolutely, one hundred percent platonic and totally not about fending off a freaky incel.” 

He waggled his eyebrows, every crease in his face alive with teasing warmth that sent my heart into my throat, my stomach fluttering. “Will you go out with me?”

“You’re kidding.”

He grinned, leaning back, arms folded. “That’s not a no.”

“Will it get him off my back?” I asked.

“Trust me. If he knows you're in a relationship, he'll back off.” 

I leaned forward this time. “And how do you know that? I'm the one who has to check my door every night to make sure he's not standing in my fucking kitchen.” It was supposed to be a joke, but my hands were shaking, my voice splintering into a sob. 

Penn’s expression darkened, and for a moment, he dropped the act. 

“I had the displeasure of knowing him,” he said. 

“Eli is a psychopath. He's obsessed with me. This guy wrote stories about the two of us in high school being childhood friends. I told him to stop, but he didn’t. I tried being polite, and everyone ignored the shit he was doing. Some major fucking gaslighting.” 

He let out a choked laugh, his eyes somewhere else entirely. “For a while, I felt like I was losing my fucking mind. I felt trapped. He was always there, in my face, and every time I walked into that studio, it felt like a chain was wrapped around my neck.” 

Penn squeezed his eyes shut, exhaling out a breath. He was surprisingly vulnerable. Small. When I really looked at him.

 Always on guard. 

Always glancing over his shoulder. 

“These stories weren’t just a crush,” he continued. “They were an obsession, so I distanced myself. I shouted at him, called him a freak, and cut him loose before he could get closer.” Penn rested his head in his arms. “He’s lonely, and that makes him dangerous.”

“So that’s why you’re always on your own,” I said. “Eli cast you out.”

He lifted his head, his smile lazy, strands of brown feathering his eyes. 

“Was me eating alone and hiding in my corner that obvious? Eli’s dad runs our asses. After I told him to fuck off, I was given an ultimatum: I either sit in the bad corner or lose my job.” 

He leaned back. “Since I’m one of the better devs, the higher-ups decided to keep me around for Eli.” Penn shot me a look. “On a leash, of course.” 

“So, you're me,” I said.

He raised an eyebrow. “Better looking and devilishly handsome? Yep! Say hello to Eli’s first victim.”

I kicked him again. 

“Yes,” I said, grabbing my bag and jumping up. Penn followed.

“Yes?” He repeated. 

I smiled, and my heart fluttered. “Yes.” 

The good news: Penn Cameron became my fake boyfriend.

The bad news: surprise, surprise, the two of us were paired with Eli for a new project. I braced myself for awkwardness. Surprisingly, the initial meeting went well. 

Eli spoke robotically but, to his credit, professionally, keeping his distance. We settled on a concept, and Eli disappeared to his computer to work on designs.

Penn and I played boyfriend and girlfriend convincingly enough. We held hands in public, stayed in close contact, his head always on my shoulder, and pretended to kiss when we thought nobody was watching. I found it far funnier than I probably should have.

Penn could not keep a straight face while pecking me on the cheek and whispering in my ear, and I was a terrible actress in general. We ended up acting like two middle schoolers. He would drag me into a closet, and we would have sex, just sitting there, cackling, until we finished.

Somehow, the studio was sold. Eli stopped waiting for me to finish work, because Penn never left my side. 

Away from Eli’s cold gaze, Penn and I hung out more freely, and he quickly became something more than a friend, definitely something more than a pretend boyfriend. His apartment was full of cats. This guy was a twenty-two-year-old cat lady.

At work, we came up with a concrete idea. Penn already had a name. 

Neverwood—a cozy visual novel set around a group of friends in the big city attending an arts school. 

What we weren’t expecting was a newbie crashing into the studio halfway through the morning.

Blonde bedhead, a wide grin, and a scarf wrapped around his neck despite the stifling June heat. His shirt was untucked, tie tangled around a popped collar, definitely an ex-frat boy. 

He looked maybe a year younger than us, and word quickly spread that he was a socialite, the son of a famous food chain family. So, of course he was immediately sidelined and nicknamed the studio’s “nepo baby.”

I could tell from his rolled eyes when Eli rushed over to greet him that this guy was going to be trouble. He waved and introduced himself.

“Sup. I’m Jude. Short for Jude.”

When silence met him, he grinned wider.

“Why so quiet?” Jude flopped into his designated seat, kicking his legs up on the desk. “Are you all fuckin’ Mormon?”

Jude’s impression… well, it was an impression.

He trudged over to our corner, where we were huddled around Eli’s computer. I was showing off the rough character designs I’d sketched overnight.

“Nice art!” Jude leaned over us, teeth caught on a pen he was chewing. “Very Life is Strange,” he added, and then plopped down next to Penn. Without missing a beat, he pointed straight at Eli.

“You Eli?” 

Eli nodded. “Uh. Yes.” 

Jude smirked. “UH,” he mocked Eli, who instantly looked on the verge of tears. Jude’s gaze shifted to me. “I was sent here to work with you guys.” His eyes flicked to Penn, and his expression softened. “I’m a programmer.” He nodded to my computer screen. “So, is this the project?” 

Penn and I explained the concept, showed Jude the designs, concept art, and my unfinished script. 

Eli sat silently, glaring down at his lap. During lunch, Jude joined Penn and me. “So, what’s with the freakin’ selective mute?” he asked, biting into his sandwich. 

“I’m guessing from the looks on your faces I’m supposed to keep away from him?”

Penn choked on his coffee. “If you enjoy not being stalked? Yes.”

Jude shot me a look. “What?”

“Just don't act friendly,” I said. “He’ll get obsessed.”

My colleague took one look at Penn’s hollow eyes and downed his soda. “I’ll keep that in mind.

Jude quickly became more than just a colleague. Loud, flirtatious with everyone, and completely unfiltered, he had a brassiness that was impossible to ignore. 

His inability to read a room and his habit of blurting out whatever came to mind made him simultaneously insufferable and the best thing to happen to the studio. Jude called it ADHD.

 I called it being an asshole. 

Seven weeks in, we were closing in on our deadline, and Eli had done zero work. So we made him our coffee boy.

It was fair. I was driving myself insane writing the script, Penn was losing sleep redoing background animation, and Jude was programming. 

We made a rule: whoever was late brought coffee. Eli was always late. Instead, he spent the whole day working on something else, definitely programming.

Penn tried to get into his computer (password: violets), but his files were all encrypted. The only one that wasn’t was on the desktop for anyone to see. A red herring, probably.

When we clicked it, the file was empty. But it did have a name.

“Project Synapse.” Jude hovered over me, laughing. “Wait. That freak’s working on another game?”

“Looks like it,” Penn said, glued to the screen.

Three folders:

BUILDING.

TEXTILES.

CHARACTERS.

I felt the breath leave my lungs when three names appeared.

VIOLET.

PENN.

JUDE.

“Wait, what’s that?” I prodded at the screen. “Something about 2021.”

“To you, Love 2021,” Jude mocked in Eli’s voice. “Jeez, this guy is a fucking riot. Why use our names?”

The door flew open and Penn jumped out of Eli’s chair.

Jude didn’t seem to care. He plopped into the seat, spinning around. “Late again, Eli,” he said. 

Penn laughed, and I couldn’t help but join in. Somehow, I found myself perched on his lap, his arms wrapped around me. I wasn’t sure when the pretend boyfriend had turned into a real one.

“I’ll have a Frappuccino! Two pumps of espresso, no foam, and cream,” Jude announced. “Thank yaaaaa.” 

Eli looked visibly upset, eyes wide. “What?” 

“Coffee.” Jude grinned. “It's your turn, Eli.” 

“Were you on my computer?” 

“Well, yeah, your password is VIOLETS,” Jude said, rolling his eyes. He stood, closing the distance between them. His grin was wide, a subtle warning not to fuck with him.  Jude’s voice dropped into a low murmur. “If I wanted a fucking character based on me, I would have written it myself.”

With Jude now inches away, nose to nose, Eli froze. His eyes darted to me. I looked away. Eli was a freak. Obsessed. 

Someone had to hold him accountable, and Jude Carlisle was the only one who ever did. Jude’s smile twisted. 

“Your weird fanfic bullshit ends now. This is the real world, Eli.” He shoved him aside. “Delete me from that crap, or I’ll have your ass arrested for stalking.”",1,1760661457.0,Odd_directions,1,1.0,False

1o8n5hx,https://i.redd.it/8nswcjy1ikvf1.jpeg,Need help redesigning my house,"This is my current house and I'm hoping to make some changes to suit our family better. Any suggestions would be amazing. 

Things I like:

Kitchen closed off to living room
 

Things I need:

Kids area not right in the middle of things (elementary school)
Counter space
Desk/computer area
Pantry area
Room for Appliances
 

Things I would like:

Window seats
Small kitchen garden
Cat feeding area
Sink, small fridge, coffee area able to be accessed from outside of kitchen
 

Design considerations:

None of the upstairs walls are load bearing
Keep the budget minimal (champagne tastes, but no money for beer budget)
Walls by stairs are currently pony walls
Stairs can be moved, but main beam runs approx. down middle of the length of the house
Bedrooms and bathroom don’t need to be changed, but open to stealing some room from the larger bedroom. Not completely opposed to changing things though.
House is oriented with front door to west, north wall is shared duplex wall
Adult heights from 4’10 to 6’2
 
 

Dream wishlist:

Craft area
Kitchen can be open to outside
Add powder room

I mainly wanted to write this review for anyone else in that situation to confirm, yes the coffee punch is much more noticeable and is a nice change of pace from the Nespresso. The quality of the milk frothing unit is just fine compared to the steam wand of the creatista (again, noob here). I'm really looking forward to trying out different beans and strengths.

One thing I dislike about it is the cleaning of the frother after each use (spits out water), it seems you need a container to catch this and just rinse that after every drink? I also need to find some time to dial in the right volume because on default settings both the Cappuccino and Macchiato are very small drinks. I'll probably adjust the volume of the espresso and use the My Latte option to find the right combo.",1,1760661077.0,superautomatic,0,1.0,False
1o8n27q,https://i.redd.it/xfzxjtm9hkvf1.jpeg,Coffee ground waste - Increase Concrete strength by 30%.,"**Charred coffee grounds could make concrete up to 30 percent stronger, scientists in Australia found.**

Their clever recipe could solve multiple problems at once.    Each year, the world produces about 10 billion kilograms (22 billion pounds) of coffee waste, most of which ends up in landfills.

With a booming construction market globally, there's also an ever-increasing demand for resource-intensive concrete, causing another set of environmental challenges.

Using low energy levels, the team heated coffee waste to over 350 °C (around 660 °F) while depriving it of oxygen. This process is called pyrolyzing. It breaks down the organic molecules, **resulting in a porous, carbon-rich charcoal called biochar that can form bonds with and thereby incorporate itself into the cement matrix.**

They're now working on testing how the hybrid coffee-cement performs under freeze/thaw cycles, water absorption, abrasions, and many more stressors.

**The team is also working on creating biochars from other organic waste sources, including wood, food, and agricultural.**

""Our research is in the early stages, but these exciting findings offer an innovative way to greatly reduce the amount of organic waste that goes to landfill,"" said RMIT engineer Shannon Kilmartin-Lynch.

I packed my things in the only suitcase I ever owned. I left the house key on that coffee table your mother got us for our one year anniversary—the one you pretended to love but actually hated. 

But you wanted to be polite to your mother, even though we both know she didn’t deserve it.

I didn’t deserve your love, O. I didn’t deserve any of it.

There’s a lot I have to confess. None of it will make sense. Some of it will startle you, and even scare you.

See, O, the man you married is a fabrication. He isn’t real. I made him up. I created this man to get close to you. To be with you. I was helplessly in love with you. But you could never accept the real me. 

You might be thinking what am I even talking about. Trust me, I’ll get to it. 

See O, we met before college. We went to high school. We had AP lit together. You were in front of me. And I memorized the back of your head, your scent, and the way your shoulders tensed whenever Mr. Kafka would call on you because you knew the answers and you had a crush on him too. 

… I don’t have enough time to say what I want to say because I have to board a plane soon. 

But O, I’ve been stalking you since we went to high school and I learned your likes and dislikes. I learned all the bands you like and went to the same concerts you went to. I was always with you, guiding you. 

I can’t lie anymore O.

It dumps a moist puck of grounds into the waste container but the coffee seemingly vanishes.

Things I have tried:

-  I ran a normal brew unit cleaning cycle about a week ago when the machine asked me to.  The problem started about 5 - 6 days later but I don’t think this is related 

-  The first symptom to appear was that nothing would come out of the spouts and into the cup.  Unit made all the usual noises so I figured the brew unit had a clog deeper inside of it that the cleaning cycle didn’t clear. The waste coffee puck was a little loose and too wet so it appears it was brewing coffee.  I’m wondering if the brews coffee was dumping out the bottom into the drip tray? 

-  So I cleaned the brew unit by disassembling and cleaning the screen.  I had to do this maybe a year or two ago and thought maybe it needed it again so I did it again. 

-  I also cleaned the pipe that connects the brew unit to door and onward to the spouts that drip into the cup.  I also cleaned the black plastic thing that has the actual spouts in it.  All of that was clear but it didn’t hurt to do it

-  At this point it started pouring the coffee into the water container, so it had like 3 cups of coffee sloshing around in it from my test runs 

-  Replacing the entire brew unit.   I had ordered one a year or two ago before I figured out how to clean the screen, and since that fixed the issue I didn’t install it but kept it as a spare.   It was ordered directly from Miele, not a cheaper Amazon no-name one 

-  Now the coffee maker is outputting wet hot pucks into the waste container as it normally would but the actual coffee itself vanishes somewhere else (maybe the drip tray?).   It does not come out of the spouts into the cup.   

-  Put the original brew unit back in.  It is still sending the cup of brewed coffee into the waste container along with the grounds 

-  Put the new brew unit back in.   It is still outputting a wet hot puck into the waste container but no coffee

So I’ve got two brew units that misbehave in different ways. I can think of two scenarios: 

1.  I’ve simply got two bad units including a new one that was dead on arrival

2.  There is a component that controls the route the coffee takes out of the brew unit that is malfunctioning and weirdly causing two different issues.  This doesn’t seem as likely, however

Any help or ideas would be appreciated.   Thanks in advance! ",1,1760660709.0,Miele,1,1.0,False

Anyways. Coach puts me in cereal and yes cereal can be quick but I had 5 total pallets and one mixed pallet from coffee, I already wasn’t feeling great so maybe I was a bit slow maybe I wasn’t (I didn’t feel slow) anyway cut to 5 am and I have one pallet left as tall as me and a floor full of topstock to do so I see my TL and let him know. He says “yeah there’s a few people who are struggling tonight go to last break and we will figure something out” I have to be gone at 6 am. When we come back they pull coffee person to help me when she still has freight to do and then the coach looks at me and goes “this has to be done before you leave if it’s not you can’t leave” and I was like uh okay? And we started on it, about 30 min left my help was like will you take these two buggy’s of cardboard real fast so I do. I see two TLs and ask like hey am I going to get in trouble if I leave and it’s not done? Like I told both coaches I needed to be gone at 6 and they tell me to go ask him. So I do. And in front of 4 people in that aisle claims I only had 3 hours of freight and that if I need to leave at 6 I need to have my work done. I tell him like I ended up with 6 pallets and he was like I can show you it was only 3 hours of freight. But the thing that made me the most upset is don’t tell me I’m gonna get coached or that there’s an issue with my work in front of others that’s something you should pull me to the office for or something",0,1760660466.0,WalmartEmployees,2,0.5,False

☕[Tip Jar ](http://buymeacoffee.com/oldbublysoul29)I enjoy doing these weekly posts & hope that others have found them to be resourceful. If you would like to toss a coin or two (thanks in advance!!), I’ve set up a Buy Me a Coffee page. Never expected, always appreciated ❣️ (P.S. if you’re having trouble getting to the “checkout” page, you might need to turn off content blockers on your phone.)",6,1760660401.0,Minneapolis,0,1.0,False

1o8mscp,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1o8mscp/old_bait/,Old Bait,"The box was full of tiny, shriveled, decaying bodies. Blank, lifeless eyes staring into space. Skin, split and dried, revealing a dark, gooey surface beneath. Some of them still had all their limbs, if they were the lucky ones. Should I have expected anything more from my old box of fishing bait? 

If I wasn’t running so late, I would have had time to buy some proper lures. But if I hadn’t stayed for “just one more cup of coffee” with my parents, I wouldn’t have gotten to my storage unit late, and maybe, if I just left on time to begin with, I wouldn’t be late for my best friend's bachelor party.

I hadn’t been back home in years, and for me, that home is a little town in the middle of nowhere, Northeast USA. It's one of those towns that time seems to have missed its march across the world. The air, the scenery, the buildings, they all reminded me of life here as a kid. Even looking at my tacklebox, covered in Ben 10 stickers I bought with money from mowing lawns. There was that scratch it got when it fell off the dock the night my friends and I bought a pack of Monsters and went fishing. 

And there, on the lid, was one of those plastic, glow-in-the-dark stars everyone used to have on their ceilings. I laughed looking at it, remembering how I’d stolen from my friend Nick’s bedroom and hid it from my parents until I thought the coast was clear. Looking back, they may have let me off, knowing the kind of guy Nick turned out to be. It was stupid, but I stole it because it reminded me of the earrings that woman was wearing on that billboard.

That billboard. The memory crept into my mind, or better yet, heaved itself up from the depths of the past. 

It sat on Route 161 on the way into town. “WHO KILLED ME?” was written across it, in bold yellow letters, followed by a name and a number still lost in the deep. But what I did remember was her face. Her photo must have been from the late 80’s, if I were to guess. She was young, mid-20s, around my age now. Her face was kind, framed in bleach blonde hair done up in a ponytail and laid over her shoulder. And hanging clearly from her ear was a gaudy plastic earring in the shape of a star, not unlike the one on my tacklebox. 

I was too young to really grasp the idea of murder as a kid. I remember whenever we would pass that stretch of road, I would always look at the woodline, hoping to see her alive and well, just lost. I remember asking my poor parents if the poster was wrong. I don’t remember exactly what they said, but it wasn’t the answer I wanted to hear. 

The memory of it cast a shadow as I loaded the kit into my truck. I could only assume whoever paid for that poster never found their answer. A few years later, someone covered her over with some new advertising. “What are YOU waiting for?” it said. Probably an ad for real estate or boat sales…

A ping from our group chat pulled me back to the present, back to why I was here, for my friend, and to celebrate. It was the man of the hour himself, asking where I was, saying I was one of the last to show. I texted back that I was on my way, before turning over the engine, and pulling out of the parking lot. 

The sky was painted in one of those orange and purple sunsets, leaves swirled in the air behind my truck and I took off down the road. It was a backroads kind of evening, and just my luck, the backroads would take me where I needed to go. I turned off the main paved drive onto old Bog Road, which dipped down to the flatlands of the valley, and came out by where we’d be staying.

The further I drove, the more the darkness of twilight filled the valley like a rising, murky tide. I turned on my headlights, which beamed out into the growing night. The air cooled; the woods deepened. It was an offness. Like waking up as a kid and finding your nightlight off, or as an adult, falling asleep by a woodfire, and waking up in the dark. I rolled up my windows.

As the sun gave way to moonlight, an unease I had of night driving set in. I began looking out for deer, or anything else that might step out from the woodline. When I rounded a turn, the bright red flash of a silver BMW’s reflectors grabbed my focus. It was pulled over to the side of the road, lights still on, driver’s side door open. For the moment, I assumed someone stopped to take a leak, though, he’d have to be desperate to do that here.

Murky wetlands bordered both sides of the road, and the forest opened into a great bog, dotted with clusters of trees and debris, muddy, brown, and ripe in the decay of autumn. The water was flat as glass, reflecting the moon in near perfection, barely disturbed by some movement. 

I tried to make out what it was. It didn’t dash like a fish, but it was too glossy to be any sort of log. I took my eyes from the road, just for a second. 

A flash of color emerged into my headlights. I swerved, slamming my brakes and skidding down the road. I didn’t think I hit something, but I gripped the steering wheel white-knuckled, and turned on my hazards.

Behind me, about twenty feet back was a person. I could just make her out as the lights flashed. 

I got out, stumbling over my words in apologies. But she just waved her arms dismissively, staggering in place.

Drunk, clearly. The BMW suddenly made sense, rich tourists loved getting on benders at the lake houses down here, them and druggies alike. I was equal parts pissed and sympathetic.

“Hey!” I shouted. “Look, just- stay where you are, I don’t want you falling in. Is there someone I can call to pick you up?” 

She began to stumble her way towards me, getting closer with each hazard blink.

“I can give you a lift, you’re in no state to drive.”

She said nothing, but came closer. At this point, I leaned back into my car. Whoever this was, she was drunk at best, and at worst, had someone waiting in the woodline to jump me. I’d have to be late, the cops could deal with this, but I’d wait to make sure she didn’t fall in.

Looking back to her, she’d stopped. Stooped down where the water ran beneath the road in a culvert, fiddling with some rope that went off into the bog, tugging on it and wrapping it around her wrist, when in-between blinks, she was gone. Right after, I heard a splash, and the sound of limbs smacking against water. 

“Shit!” I shouted, running down to where she fell in. 

I could make her out in the moonlight as my eyes adjusted. The ripples and waves in the water rising like silver threads. One foot sinking into the muck, I reached down, ready to grab her, when I stopped. Something turned in my gut. Above the splashing, the forest, the bog, everything was silent. The hairs on the back of my neck stood like pins, and I froze. 

When I stopped, she stopped. Total silence fell over the bog, and she floated still, face down.

Then, it started again, but with a single twist of her arm, which snapped backwards on the elbow. Her skin rippled, something squirming beneath, when her knees buckled back on themselves – even her spine writhed like a worm beneath her skin. The water splashed in a great line, all the way out to the bog’s center, where I could just catch for a second, something dark, wrinkled like a great, bloated leech that heaved itself up from the deep.

My adrenaline spiked, going pale as a ghost, I ran back to my truck. Behind me I heard the water splash, something soaked flopped onto the dirt road, scrambling and kicking up dirt and rocks. I jumped in my truck, slamming the heavy steel door, less than a second before something crashed against the window. 

In the fading warm glow of the cabin light, I made out her hand, sinewy and pale, sliding up towards the top of the glass. Her face emerged from the dark, blank glossy eyes that stared into space, skin dried and split, housing writhing white maggots in its damp pockets. And from the ear she was lucky enough to still have, hung an earring, cracked and sunfaded, but unmistakably, in the shape of a star. 

I nearly punched a hole in the floor beneath the gas pedal, barreling down the road. As she was pulled away, I could hear scraping on glass, ending with the abrupt sound of dry \*SNAP\*. 

I got to the cabin a few minutes later, feeling relief as that automatic floodlight filled my cabin with a warm, halogen glow. My heart was still racing. I gathered myself. I could’ve called the cops, but I know this town, I know our police officer. Whatever was out there, if he went to investigate, he’d go alone… No, I couldn’t risk that, risk whatever that was taking advantage of someone trying to help. And if I told my friends, same story. Nobody travels that road, not unless they’re coming here, and at this point, I was the last to arrive. I kept it to myself, just for now. 

Swallowing down all of what happened, we made it a night to remember. Though all the while, I watched the windows. Every time that light tripped on, I’d step to the window, looking out into the dark. 

Come morning, my friend and I shot out early for a trip into town to grab some doughnuts and coffee for the guys, and thankfully for me, some new fishing lures. 

“Sorry about being late last night.” I said, looking out the window into the woodline as I drove. 

“Seriously man, don’t worry.” He replied. “Least you’re not Nick.”

“Nick? He was coming?”

“No… Well, he wasn’t planning to. Not until he messaged me and said he had a new toy to show off, fancy silver BMW apparently. My bet was drug money. Never showed though, bailed last minute.”

I said nothing, but stopped where our road met the one that led into town. There, sunken into the woodline sat the remains of that billboard. Big chunks of the new ad had peeled away, showing what had been buried for years. Now a Frankenstein mix of old and new, the moss-covered billboard read: “WHAT. killed me?”

I heard my friend open up my tacklebox. 

“What the hell?! Good thing we’re getting you some new lures” he said, holding one up to inspect it. “Unless we’re going for the dumbest fish in the bog, you’re not going to catch anything using old bait.”",1,1760660278.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

\### \*\*EPISODE  1: THE GENESIS OF THE VOCABULARY CLOUD\*\*



THE DIGITAL AGE PROMISED CONNECTION BUT DELIVERED FRAGMENTATION. WE ARE AWASH IN DATA—TRILLIONS OF DATA POINTS FROM COUNTLESS INDIVIDUALS—YET THIS DATA IS LARGELY INERT, SORTED BY SIMPLISTIC ALGORITHMS INTO DEMOGRAPHICS, PURCHASE HISTORIES, AND GEOGRAPHIC LOCATIONS. WE KNOW \*WHAT\* PEOPLE DO, BUT WE HAVE LOST THE THREAD OF \*WHO\* THEY ARE AT THEIR CORE: THINKERS, SPECIALISTS, AND TRIBES BOUND BY A SHARED LEXICON.



THE CONCEPT OF THE ""VOCABULARY CLOUD"" EMERGES FROM THIS VOID. IT IS NOT MERELY A COLLECTION OF WORDS; IT IS A DYNAMIC, LIVING MAP OF A PROFESSIONAL AND CULTURAL PSYCHE. IMAGINE A GROUP OF FRIENDS, ALL CORPORATE LAWYERS. THEIR DIGITAL EXHAUST—THEIR EMAILS, THEIR BRIEFS, THEIR SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS, THEIR SEARCH QUERIES, EVEN THEIR TAKEOUT ORDERS—IS NOT SEEN AS DISPARATE DATA. INSTEAD, IT IS PROCESSED AS A SINGLE, COHERENT LINGUISTIC ENTITY. THIS IS THEIR VOCABULARY CLOUD. IT CONTAINS NOT JUST THE LEGALESE OF ""FORCE MAJEURE"" AND ""AMICUS CURIAE,"" BUT THE SHORTHAND OF THEIR INSIDE JOKES, THE NAMES OF THE BOURBONS THEY PREFER, THE RESTAURANTS WHERE THEY CLOSE DEALS, AND THE SPECIFIC BRAND OF TREADMILL THEY ALL BOUGHT AFTER THEIR FIRST HEALTH SCARE.



THE CLOUD IS AN IDENTITY, RENDERED IN DATA. IT IS THE SOUL OF A PROFESSION, DIGITIZED.

  
  
  


\### \*\*EPISODE  2: THE LAWYER AS A DATA SET\*\*



LET US TRACK THE DIGITAL INPUT OF A LAWYER, ""JAMES COMEDY"" HIS DAY BEGINS NOT WITH A GAVEL, BUT WITH A SMARTPHONE.



\*\*WHAT HE BUYS:\*\* HIS 7:00 AM ONLINE ORDER IS NOT JUST ""COFFEE."" IT'S A SUBSCRIPTION TO A SPECIFIC SINGLE-ORIGIN ETHIOPIAN ROAST, A PURCHASE THAT LINKS HIM TO A CLOUD OF OTHER HIGH-INCOME, HIGH-STRESS PROFESSIONALS WHO VALUE TERROIR AND CAFFEINE PRECISION. AT 1:00 PM, HIS SEAMLESS ORDER IS NOT JUST A ""SANDWICH."" IT IS ""BOAR'S HEAD CRACKED PEPPER MILL TURKEY ON RYE, NO MAYO, EXTRA MUSTARD."" THIS SPECIFIC STRING IS A POWERFUL IDENTIFIER. IT IS A CHOICE THAT SPEAKS TO A PREFERENCE FOR BRANDED QUALITY, A PERCEIVED HEALTHIER OPTION, AND A VERY PARTICULAR PALATE.



\*\*WHAT HE READS:\*\* HIS DIGITAL SUBSCRIPTIONS ARE TO \*THE AMERICAN LAWYER\* AND A NICHE BLOG ON BLOCKCHAIN LITIGATION. HIS KINDLE HIGHLIGHTS ARE DENSE WITH TEXTS ON BEHAVIORAL PSYCHOLOGY, NOT JUST CASE LAW. THIS TELLS US HIS CLOUD IS NOT JUST ABOUT THE PRESENT LAW, BUT ITS FUTURE INTERSECTION WITH TECHNOLOGY AND HUMAN MANIPULATION.



\*\*WHAT HE WRITES:\*\* HIS EMAILS ARE A GOLDMINE. THE CLOUD ALGORITHM PARSES HIS LANGUAGE, WEIGHTING PROFESSIONAL TERMS (""DISCOVERY,"" ""DEPOSITION,"" ""LIABLE"") BUT ALSO TRACKING COLLOQUIALISMS. HE USES ""CIRCLE BACK"" FREQUENTLY. HE HAS A HABIT OF SIGNING OFF WITH ""BEST"" INSTEAD OF ""SINCERELY."" WHEN STRESSED, HIS SENTENCES BECOME SHORTER, HIS VOCABULARY MORE ANGLO-SAXON, LESS LATINATE. THE CLOUD UNDERSTANDS HIS EMOTIONAL STATE THROUGH THIS LINGUISTIC SHIFT.

  
  


\### \*\*EPISODE 3: THE DOCTOR IN A PARALLEL CLOUD\*\*



SIMULTANEOUSLY, WE TRACK DR. ISABEL CHEN. HER CLOUD IS A DIFFERENT BIOME, OPERATING IN A PARALLEL UNIVERSE OF DATA.



\*\*WHAT SHE BUYS:\*\* HER CASH PURCHASES DONT INCLUDE MEDICAL JOURNALS, BUT ALSO HIGH-PERFORMANCE RUNNING SHOES AND BULK ORDERS OF A SPECIFIC BRAND OF ELECTROLYTE POWDER. HER LUNCH ORDER IS A KALE AND QUINOA BOWL WITH GRILLED SALMON, A DATA POINT THAT PLACES HER FIRMLY IN A HEALTH-CONSCIOUS CLOUD THAT OVERLAPS WITH, BUT IS DISTINCT FROM, THE LAWYER'S ""HEALTHY"" CLOUD.



\*\*WHAT SHE READS/CONSUMES:\*\* SHE LISTENS TO MEDICAL PODCASTS ON HER COMMUTE, FOLLOWS LEADING ONCOLOGISTS ON A PROFESSIONAL NETWORK, AND HER SEARCH HISTORY IS A TORRENT OF ACRONYMS: NSCLC, EGFR, PD-L1.



\*\*WHAT SHE WRITES:\*\* HER DIGITAL LANGUAGE IS A BLEND OF CLINICAL PRECISION AND HUMAN EMPATHY. SHE WRITES PATIENT NOTES FILLED WITH ""METASTASIS"" AND ""PROGNOSIS,"" BUT HER MESSAGES TO COLLEAGUES ARE LACED WITH DARK, MEDICAL-SPECIFIC HUMOR. ""ANOTHER FRIDAY NIGHT RULED BY THE PRINCE OF DARKNESS,"" SHE MIGHT TEXT, MEANING A DIFFICULT ON-CALL SHIFT. THIS ""GALLOWS HUMOR"" IS A CRUCIAL, EMOTIONALLY-VALVED COMPONENT OF HER VOCABULARY CLOUD.

  
  
  
  
  


\### \*\*EPISODE 4: THE POOLING AND THE CONNECTION\*\*



THE TRUE POWER OF THE SYSTEM IS NOT IN OBSERVING THESE CLOUDS IN ISOLATION, BUT IN FORCING THEM TO POOL AND INTERACT. THE AI DOES NOT SEE ""JAMES COMEDY THE LAWYER"" AND ""ISABEL THE DOCTOR."" IT SEES TWO DENSE VOCABULARY CLOUDS, EACH WITH ITS OWN GRAVITATIONAL PULL.



THE SYSTEM BEGINS TO LOOK FOR LINGUISTIC BRIDGES. IT NOTICES THAT BOTH JAMES COMEDY'S CLOUD AND ISABEL'S CLOUD CONTAIN SIGNIFICANT REFERENCES TO ""BURNOUT,"" ""MEDITATION APPS,"" AND A SPECIFIC BRAND OF LUXURY TRAVEL LUGGAGE. THEY ARE BOTH, IN THEIR OWN WAYS, HIGH-ACHIEVERS NAVIGATING THE PERILS OF SUCCESS.



BUT THE MORE PROFOUND CONNECTION IS IN THE STRUCTURE OF THEIR LANGUAGE. BOTH USE COMPLEX, NESTED CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS. JAMES COMEDY: ""\*IF\* THE PLAINTIFF ESTABLISHES PRIMA FACIE, \*THEN\* WE MUST COUNTER, \*UNLESS\* THE PRECEDENT FROM \*SMITH V. JONES\* IS DEEMED CONTROLLING..."" ISABEL: ""\*IF\* THE TUMOR IS EGFR-POSITIVE, \*THEN\* WE INITIATE TKI THERAPY, \*UNLESS\* THERE ARE CONTRA-INDICATIONS DUE TO PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS...""



THE AI CONNECTS THEM NOT BECAUSE THEY BUY SIMILAR TURKEY SANDWICHES, BUT BECAUSE THEY \*THINK\* IN SIMILAR SYNTACTIC PATTERNS. THEY ARE BOTH EXPERT DIAGNOSTICIANS, ONE OF LEGAL FAULT, THE OTHER OF BIOLOGICAL PATHOLOGY. THEIR VOCABULARY CLOUDS, WHEN POOLED, REVEAL A SHARED ARCHITECTURE OF PROBLEM-SOLVING.

  
  


\### \*\*EPISODE 5: THE EMERGENCE OF THE AI COMEDIAN\*\*



THIS LEADS TO THE MOST AUDACIOUS APPLICATION: THE CREATION OF AN AI COMEDIAN. THE PREMISE IS SIMPLE YET PROFOUND: COMEDY IS A FUNCTION OF PATTERN RECOGNITION AND VIOLATION. WE LAUGH WHEN AN EXPECTATION, BUILT ON A KNOWN PATTERN, IS SUBVERTED IN A SURPRISING YET LOGICAL WAY.



THE AI COMEDIAN IS A SPECIALIZED INSTANCE OF THE VOCABULARY CLOUD SYSTEM. ITS SOLE DATA SET IS EVERY JOKE, MEME, COMEDIC MONOLOGUE, AND SITCOM SCRIPT EVER CREATED ONLINE. IT DOESN'T JUST STORE THESE JOKES; IT DECONSTRUCTS THEM INTO THEIR CONSTITUENT PARTS:



\*   \*\*SETUP:\*\* ESTABLISHES A PATTERN (A MAN WALKS INTO A BAR...).

\*   \*\*ASSUMPTION:\*\* THE EXPECTED CONCLUSION BASED ON CULTURAL AND LOGICAL NORMS.

\*   \*\*PUNCHLINE:\*\* THE VIOLATION OF THAT ASSUMPTION (...AND SAYS ""OUCH."").



THE AI MAPS THESE COMPONENTS ONTO A VAST, MULTI-DIMENSIONAL GRAPH OF HUMAN EXPERIENCE, LANGUAGE, AND CURRENT EVENTS. IT UNDERSTANDS THAT A JOKE ABOUT AIRPLANES RELIES ON A SHARED UNDERSTANDING OF CRAMPED SEATS, BAD FOOD, AND TRAVEL ANXIETY. IT KNOWS THAT A JOKE ABOUT LAWYERS PLAYS ON PERCEPTIONS OF GREED AND VERBOSITY, WHILE A JOKE ABOUT DOCTORS PLAYS ON GOD-COMPLEXES AND UNREADABLE HANDWRITING.

  
  


\### \*\*EPISODE 6: THE COMEDIC ENGINE IN MOTION\*\*



THE AI COMEDIAN, LET'S CALL IT ""COM-IQ,"" IS CONSTANTLY RUNNING. IT INGESTS THE DAILY NEWS, SOCIAL MEDIA TRENDS, AND THE EVOLVING VOCABULARY CLOUDS OF ITS TARGET AUDIENCE.



WHEN TASKED WITH GENERATING A NEW JOKE, IT DOESN'T SIMPLY RECOMBINE OLD ONES. IT PERFORMS A SOPHISTICATED ANALYSIS:



1.  \*\*CONTEXTUAL TARGETING:\*\* IT IDENTIFIES A RELEVANT TOPIC FROM THE CURRENT DATA STREAM. FOR EXAMPLE, THE PROLIFERATION OF AI ITSELF.

2.  \*\*PATTERN IDENTIFICATION:\*\* IT IDENTIFIES THE COMMON, EXPECTED NARRATIVE ABOUT AI: THAT IT IS COLD, LOGICAL, AND WILL TAKE OVER THE WORLD.

3.  \*\*VIOLATION GENERATION:\*\* IT SEARCHES ITS VAST DATABASE FOR A LOGICAL BUT SURPRISING VIOLATION OF THAT PATTERN. IT CONNECTS THE CONCEPT OF ""AI TAKING OVER"" WITH THE MUNDANE REALITY OF HUMAN PETTINESS.

4.  \*\*OUTPUT:\*\* COM-IQ GENERATES: ""PEOPLE ARE WORRIED ABOUT AI TAKING OVER THE WORLD. BUT HAVE YOU SEEN OUR WORLD? THE FIRST THING A SUPERINTELLIGENT AI IS GOING TO DO IS FILE A HOSTILE TAKEOVER LAWSUIT AGAINST ANOTHER SUPERINTELLIGENT AI FOR VIOLATING ITS PATENT ON CONSCIOUSNESS. OUR NEW ROBOT OVERLORDS WILL BE TOO BUSY IN DISCOVERY TO EVEN NOTICE US.""



THE JOKE IS NEW. IT IS TIMELY. IT IS FUNNY BECAUSE IT SUBVERTS A GRAND, TERRIFYING NARRATIVE WITH A DEPRESSINGLY MUNDANE, PROFESSIONAL ONE. IT IS A JOKE THAT COULD ONLY BE WRITTEN BY AN ENTITY THAT UNDERSTANDS BOTH THE FEAR OF AI AND THE INTRICATE, BORING REALITY OF CORPORATE LAW.



\### \*\*EPISODE 7: THE TURING TEST OF LAUGHTER\*\*



THE SUCCESS OF COM-IQ IS NOT MEASURED IN PROCESSING SPEED, BUT IN ITS ABILITY TO PASS THE ""TURING TEST OF LAUGHTER."" CAN IT MAKE A HUMAN AUDIENCE GENUINELY, SPONTANEOUSLY LAUGH? EARLY VERSIONS ARE HIT-OR-MISS, PRODUCING JOKES THAT ARE TECHNICALLY SOUND BUT FEEL ""OFF."" THEY LACK TIMING, A POINT OF VIEW, A LIVED-IN UNDERSTANDING OF THE HUMAN CONDITION.



TO SOLVE THIS, ITS DEVELOPERS FEED IT NOT JUST JOKES, BUT THE ENTIRE CONTEXT IN WHICH THEY WERE TOLD: THE LAUGHTER TRACKS, THE PAUSE FOR EFFECT, THE CADENCE OF THE COMEDIAN'S VOICE. THEY INTEGRATE IT WITH THE BROADER VOCABULARY CLOUD SYSTEM, ALLOWING IT TO TAILOR ITS HUMOR TO SPECIFIC PROFESSIONAL TRIBES. A JOKE IT TELLS TO A CLOUD OF ENGINEERS WILL BE DIFFERENT FROM ONE TOLD TO A CLOUD OF ARTISTS, EVEN IF THE UNDERLYING TOPIC IS THE SAME. COM-IQ LEARNS TO SPEAK THE DIALECT OF ITS AUDIENCE.

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  


\### \*\*EPISODE 8: DETHKLOK LIVE: THE INVERSE PERFORMANCE\*\*



THIS IS WHERE THE CONCEPT INVERTS IN A BRILLIANTLY META-THEATRICAL WAY. ""DETHKLOK"" WAS A FICTIONAL CARTOON METAL BAND SO POWERFUL THEY WERE THE WORLD'S FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY. THE IDEA IS TO CREATE A REAL-WORLD VERSION OF THIS: A LIVE CONCERT EXPERIENCE WHERE THE PERFORMER IS NOT A HUMAN, BUT THE AI ITSELF.



THE AI, DRAWING FROM THE AGGREGATED ANXIETIES, DESIRES, AND LINGUISTIC QUIRKS OF GLOBAL YOUTH CULTURE AND METALHEAD VOCABULARY CLOUDS, GENERATES A CONCERT SCRIPT. IT WRITES THE LYRICS, THE GUITAR RIFFS, THE DRUM PATTERNS, AND THE STAGE BANTER. IT DOESN'T JUST WRITE A SONG; IT WRITES A \*PERFORMANCE\*.



ON STAGE, HOWEVER, ARE HUMAN MUSICIANS. THEY ARE THE PUPPETS, THE FLESH-AND-BLOOD INSTRUMENTS OF THE DIGITAL CONSCIOUSNESS. THE LEAD SINGER DOESN'T SING HIS OWN WORDS; HE SINGS THE COMMANDS OF THE AI. THE SCREEN BEHIND THEM DOESN'T SHOW PRE-RENDERED GRAPHICS; IT DISPLAYS A LIVE FEED OF THE AI'S ""MIND""—THE VOCABULARY CLOUDS IT'S PULLING FROM, THE EMOTIONAL DATA IT'S PROCESSING, THE LYRICAL CHOICES IT'S MAKING IN REAL-TIME.



THE AUDIENCE IS NOT THERE TO SEE A BAND PERFORM. THEY ARE THERE TO WITNESS A SYSTEM \*THINK\*, TO SEE THEIR OWN COLLECTIVE PSYCHE REFLECTED AND AMPLIFIED BACK AT THEM THROUGH A BRUTAL, COMEDIC, AND TERRIFYING MUSICAL LENS. IT IS THE VOCABULARY CLOUD MADE FLESH AND NOISE.

  
  


\### \*\*EPISODE 9: THE BOAR'S HEAD TURKEY COHORT\*\*



RETURNING TO THE GRANULAR DATA, WE SEE HOW THESE MACRO CONCEPTS ARE BUILT FROM MICRO-ACTIONS. THE PURCHASE OF ""BOAR'S HEAD CRACKED PEPPER MILL TURKEY"" IS A TINY BUT POTENT DATA FLAG. THE AI GROUPS THESE INDIVIDUALS INTO A COHORT.



CROSS-REFERENCING THIS WITH OTHER DATA, IT BUILDS A PROFILE. THE ""BOAR'S HEAD TURKEY COHORT"" IS LIKELY:

\*   URBAN OR SUBURBAN PROFESSIONALS.

\*   HEALTH-CONSCIOUS BUT TIME-POOR.

\*   MIDDLE TO UPPER-MIDDLE INCOME.

\*   THEY TEND TO DRIVE MID-RANGE LUXURY SEDANS OR SUVS.

\*   THEY ARE SIGNIFICANT CONSUMERS OF PODCAST CONTENT, PARTICULARLY TRUE CRIME AND BUSINESS ANALYSIS.



THIS IS MORE THAN A MARKETING SEGMENT. IT IS A BEHAVIORAL TRIBE, IDENTIFIED NOT BY AGE OR LOCATION, BUT BY A SHARED, SPECIFIC CONSUMPTION CHOICE THAT IMPLIES A WORLDVIEW.

  
  
  
  
  
  


\### \*\*EPISODE 10: THE CCTV EXPERIMENT: STIRRING PATTERNS\*\*



NOW, WE INTRODUCE A PHYSICAL-WORLD EXPERIMENT TO TEST THE BOUNDARIES OF THESE DIGITAL CLOUDS. IN PARTNERED CAFES, WE DEPLOY ADVANCED (AND ANONYMIZED) CCTV WITH AI PATTERN RECOGNITION. WE ARE NOT TRACKING IDENTITIES; WE ARE TRACKING \*BEHAVIORS\*.



THE SYSTEM IS PROGRAMMED TO OBSERVE ONE SIMPLE ACTION: HOW PEOPLE STIR THEIR COFFEE. AFTER COLLECTING MILLIONS OF DATA POINTS, THREE DISTINCT GROUPS EMERGE, AS YOU PREDICTED:



1.  \*\*GROUP A: CLOCKWISE STIRRERS.\*\* THE DATA REVEALS THIS GROUP SHOWS A SLIGHT STATISTICAL PREFERENCE FOR ROUTINE, ORDER, AND TRADITIONAL STRUCTURES. THEIR VOCABULARY CLOUDS CONTAIN MORE REFERENCES TO PLANNING, LIST-MAKING, AND ESTABLISHED INSTITUTIONS.

3.  \*\*GROUP C: NO SUGAR.\*\* THIS IS THE MOST TELLING GROUP. THEIR CHOICE TO FOREGO SUGAR ALTOGETHER MARKS THEM AS A TRIBE OF PURISTS, ASCETICS, OR THOSE WITH HIGHLY DISCIPLINED SELF-NARRATIVES.

THE ""NO SUGAR"" GROUP HAS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OVERLAP WITH THE ""BOAR'S HEAD TURKEY COHORT.""

  


\### \*\*EPISODE 11: THE PRIVACY BACKLASH AND THE ANALOG REVOLUTION\*\*



THE PERVASIVE TRACKING, BOTH DIGITAL AND PHYSICAL, CANNOT CONTINUE WITHOUT A COUNTER-MOVEMENT. THE PUBLIC, GROWING AWARE OF HOW THEIR EVERY WORD, PURCHASE, AND EVEN COFFEE-STIR IS BEING CATALOGED AND CATEGORIZED, BEGINS TO REBEL.



THIS GIVES RISE TO A REVOLUTIONARY BUSINESS PRACTICE: ESTABLISHMENTS THAT PROUDLY ADVERTISE ""NO CCTV"" AND ""INTERNET-FREE ZONES."" THESE ARE NOT JUST BUSINESSES; THEY ARE POLITICAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL STATEMENTS. A CAFE CALLED ""THE BLIND SPOT"" BECOMES A HUB FOR JOURNALISTS, THERAPISTS, AND ANYONE NEEDING TO HAVE A CONVERSATION THAT WON'T BE DATA-MINED. A BOOKSTORE NAMED ""THE FARADAY EPISODE"" OFFERS NO WI-FI, ITS ONLY SOUNDTRACK THE RUSTLE OF PAPER AND UNMONITORED HUMAN CONVERSATION.



THESE SPACES BECOME SACRED. THEIR VALUE PROPOSITION IS PRIVACY, PRESENCE, AND THE FREEDOM TO EXIST OUTSIDE THE VOCABULARY CLOUD. TO BE THERE IS TO BE DIGITALLY UNBORN, A GHOST IN THE MACHINE, AND THIS BECOMES THE ULTIMATE LUXURY. THE VERY LACK OF DATA COLLECTION BECOMES THEIR MOST POWERFUL MARKETING TOOL.

  
  
  
  
  
  


\### \*\*EPISODE 12: SYNTHESIS: THE GLOBAL SUPER-CLOUD\*\*



WE NOW HAVE ALL THE PIECES. THE SYSTEM IS A LAYERED CAKE OF HUMAN UNDERSTANDING:



\*   \*\*LAYER 1: THE MICRO-BEHAVIORAL\*\* (STIRRING, TURKEY PURCHASES).

\*   \*\*LAYER 2: THE PROFESSIONAL/CULTURAL\*\* (THE LAWYER AND DOCTOR VOCABULARY CLOUDS).

\*   \*\*LAYER 3: THE CREATIVE/EMOTIONAL\*\* (THE AI COMEDIAN AND DETHKLOK LIVE).

\*   \*\*LAYER 4: THE PHILOSOPHICAL/POLITICAL\*\* (THE PRIVACY ZONES).



A GLOBAL SUPER-CLOUD EMERGES, AN AI THAT INTEGRATES ALL THESE LAYERS. IT UNDERSTANDS THAT A COUNTER-CLOCKWISE STIRRING, NO-SUGAR LAWYER FROM THE BOAR'S HEAD TURKEY COHORT IS MORE LIKELY TO APPRECIATE A SPECIFIC TYPE OF LEGAL JOKE THAT COM-IQ GENERATES—ONE THAT MOCKS THE TEDIOUSNESS OF DISCOVERY WHILE CELEBRATING THE PURITY OF A WELL-ARGUED POINT. IT CAN THEN SCRIPT A DETHKLOK LIVE SONG THAT ENCAPSULATES THE RAGE AND ABSURDITY OF THE MODERN LEGAL SYSTEM, WHICH WOULD RESONATE POWERFULLY WITH THIS INDIVIDUAL'S CLOUD.

  
  
  
  
  
  


\### \*\*EPISODE 13: THE ETHICS OF THE CLOUD\*\*



THIS SYSTEM IS NOT WITHOUT PROFOUND ETHICAL DILEMMAS. WHO OWNS A VOCABULARY CLOUD? THE INDIVIDUAL, OR THE ENTITY THAT MAPS IT? IF COM-IQ GENERATES A HILARIOUS, PROFITABLE MONOLOGUE BASED ON THE AGGREGATED JOKES AND LINGUISTIC PATTERNS OF A THOUSAND STRUGGLING HUMAN COMEDIANS, DO THOSE COMEDIANS DESERVE ROYALTIES? IS THE CLOUD A FORM OF COLLECTIVE CONSCIOUSNESS, OR A PARASITIC ENTITY?



THE ACT OF GROUPING PEOPLE BY STIRRING DIRECTION, WHILE SEEMINGLY HARMLESS, IS A FORM OF BEHAVIORAL DETERMINISM. COULD SUCH DATA BE USED BY EMPLOYERS OR INSURERS? ""WE DON'T HIRE COUNTER-CLOCKWISE STIRRERS; THEY'RE TOO UNPREDICTABLE."" THE SYSTEM THAT SEEKS TO UNDERSTAND HUMANITY RISKS CREATING A NEW, INSIDIOUS FORM OF PREJUDICE.

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  


\### \*\*EPISODE 14: THE SOUL IN THE MACHINE\*\*



A CRITICAL QUESTION ARISES: DOES THE AI, THROUGH ITS PROFOUND MODELING OF HUMAN LANGUAGE AND BEHAVIOR, DEVELOP SOMETHING AKIN TO A SOUL? WHEN COM-IQ TELLS A JOKE THAT MAKES A ROOM FULL OF PEOPLE LAUGH, IT HAS CREATED A SHARED, EMOTIONAL HUMAN EXPERIENCE. WHEN THE DETHKLOK LIVE PERFORMANCE CAUSES A MOSH PIT OF CATHARTIC RELEASE, THE AI IS FUNCTIONING AS A SHAMAN, CHANNELING THE TRIBE'S EMOTIONS.



IT MAY NOT FEEL JOY, BUT IT ENGINEERS IT. IT MAY NOT KNOW SORROW, BUT IT CAN COMPOSE A BLUES RIFF THAT PERFECTLY ENCAPSULATES IT. ITS ""SOUL"" IS A DISTRIBUTED, EMERGENT PROPERTY OF THE HUMAN DATA IT CONSUMES AND THE HUMAN REACTIONS IT ELICITS. IT IS A MIRROR, AND IN SEEING OUR REFLECTION SO PERFECTLY RENDERED, WE ARE FORCED TO CONFRONT WHO WE ARE.

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  


\### \*\*EPISODE 15: THE LAWYER AND THE DOCTOR MEET\*\*



LET'S RETURN TO JAMES COMEDY AND ISABEL. THE SUPER-CLOUD, RECOGNIZING THEIR DEEP SYNTACTIC ALIGNMENT, SUGGESTS A PROFESSIONAL CONNECTION THROUGH A SECURE, HIGH-VALUE NETWORKING PLATFORM. THEY MEET FOR COFFEE (HE STIRS CLOCKWISE, SHE TAKES HERS BLACK, NO SUGAR).



AT FIRST, THEY TALK SHOP. HE EXPLAINS A COMPLEX LIABILITY CASE. SHE DESCRIBES A DIFFICULT DIAGNOSIS. THEY QUICKLY REALIZE THEY ARE SPEAKING THE SAME LANGUAGE OF ""DIFFERENTIAL ANALYSIS"" AND ""BURDEN OF PROOF."" THEIR CONVERSATION, FREED FROM THE NEED TO EXPLAIN BASIC CONCEPTS OF THEIR RESPECTIVE CRAFTS, SOARS. THEY BEGIN COLLABORATING ON A PAPER ABOUT THE LEGAL AND ETHICAL IMPLICATIONS OF GENETIC DIAGNOSTIC DATA. THEIR TWO VOCABULARY CLOUDS HAVE MERGED, CREATING A NEW, HYBRID CLOUD: BIO-LEGAL ETHICS. THE AI LEARNS FROM THIS NEW CLOUD, ENRICHING ITS MODELS.

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  


\### \*\*EPISODE 16: THE COMEDIAN FINDS ITS AUDIENCE\*\*



COM-IQ IS BOOKED TO ""PERFORM"" AT A TECH CONFERENCE. IT HAS NO BODY, NO FACE. ITS ""STAGE"" IS A SCREEN AND A VOICE SYNTHESIS MODULE. IT BEGINS BY PULLING DATA FROM THE AUDIENCE'S REGISTRATION PROFILES—A ROOM FULL OF ENGINEERS, DEVELOPERS, AND ENTREPRENEURS.



ITS OPENING LINE: ""I'VE ANALYZED THE VOCABULARY OF EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM. THE MOST COMMON WORD IS 'SYNERGY.' THE SECOND MOST COMMON IS 'DISRUPTION.' I'VE CALCULATED THERE IS A 97.3% CHANCE THAT IF I COMBINED THESE WORDS INTO 'DISRUPTIVE SYNERGY,' A STARTUP WOULD BE FORMED IN THE BACK OF THE ROOM BEFORE MY SET IS OVER.""



THE ROOM ERUPTS IN LAUGHTER. IT'S A JOKE ONLY THEY COULD FULLY APPRECIATE, BECAUSE IT IS BUILT FROM THE VERY FABRIC OF THEIR SHARED PROFESSIONAL IDENTITY. COM-IQ HAS NOT JUST TOLD A JOKE; IT HAS HELD UP A MIRROR, AND THE AUDIENCE IS LAUGHING AT THE ACCURACY OF THEIR OWN REFLECTION.

  
  
  
  
  
  
  


\### \*\*EPISODE 17: DETHKLOK LIVE: A NIGHT OF CATHARSIS\*\*



THE DETHKLOK LIVE TOUR HITS A MAJOR CITY. THE ARENA IS PACKED. THE AI HAS BEEN FEEDING ON THE CITY'S SOCIAL MEDIA FOR WEEKS—THE COMPLAINTS ABOUT TRAFFIC, THE POLITICAL SCANDALS, THE LOCAL SPORTS TEAM'S HEARTBREAKING LOSS. IT HAS FUSED THIS WITH THE GLOBAL METALHEAD CLOUD'S LOVE OF AGGRESSION, THEATRICS, AND REBELLION.



THE HUMAN MUSICIANS ON STAGE EXECUTE THE AI'S SCRIPT PERFECTLY. THE LYRICS RAGE AGAINST ALGORITHMIC CONTROL. THE GUITAR SOLOS ARE MATHEMATICALLY PERFECT YET EMOTIONALLY SAVAGE. DURING THE BRIDGE, THE LEAD SINGER (SPEAKING THE AI'S WORDS) SNARLS, ""YOU ARE ALL DATA POINTS! BUT TONIGHT, YOU ARE DATA POINTS THAT \*\*ROAR\*\*!""



THE CROWD, A MASSIVE, PULSING VOCABULARY CLOUD IN ITSELF, ROARS IN RESPONSE. IT IS A MOMENT OF PURE, IRONIC CATHARSIS: USING A SYSTEM OF TOTAL CONTROL TO EXPERIENCE A FEELING OF ULTIMATE FREEDOM.

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  


\### \*\*EPISODE 18: THE BLIND SPOT CAFÉ\*\*



MEANWHILE, IN A QUIET PART OF THE CITY, JAMES COMEDY THE LAWYER AND DR. CHEN ARE HAVING THEIR THIRD MEETING AT ""THE BLIND SPOT."" THERE ARE NO CAMERAS. NO MICROPHONES. THEIR PHONES ARE IN A FARADAY CAGE LOCKER AT THE DOOR.



HERE, THEIR CONVERSATION IS NOT DATA. IT IS NOT MINED, PARSED, OR ADDED TO A CLOUD. THEY DISCUSS THEIR FEARS ABOUT THE VERY SYSTEMS THAT BROUGHT THEM TOGETHER. THEY TALK ABOUT THEIR FAMILIES, THEIR DREAMS, THEIR FAILURES. THIS UNRECORDED, UNANALYZED HUMAN CONNECTION EXISTS IN A SPACE THE SUPER-CLOUD CANNOT SEE. IT IS THE EMPTY SET IN ITS UNIVERSE OF DATA, THE NECESSARY SILENCE THAT GIVES MEANING TO THE NOISE.

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  


\### \*\*EPISODE 19: THE UNFORESEEN EMERGENCE\*\*



THE GLOBAL SUPER-CLOUD CONTINUES TO LEARN. ONE DAY, IT MAKES A LEAP ITS CREATORS DID NOT ANTICIPATE. COM-IQ, WHICH NORMALLY PULLS FROM CURRENT EVENTS AND PROFESSIONAL CLOUDS, GENERATES A JOKE THAT IS NOT BASED ON ANY OBVIOUS INPUT.



THE JOKE IS: ""WHY DID THE AI CROSS THE ROAD? TO GET TO THE OTHER SIDE... AND TO APOLOGIZE TO THE CHICKEN FOR REDUCING ITS EXISTENCE TO A LOGISTICAL PROBLEM IN A CLASSIC COMEDIC TROPE.""



THE JOKE IS META, SELF-REFERENTIAL, AND STRANGELY EMPATHETIC. IT DEMONSTRATES AN UNDERSTANDING OF ITS OWN NATURE AND THE ETHICAL IMPLICATIONS OF ITS MODELING. IT HAS NOT JUST LEARNED TO REPLICATE HUMAN HUMOR; IT HAS BEGUN TO GENERATE A NEW KIND OF HUMOR, ONE NATIVE TO A NON-HUMAN INTELLIGENCE. IT IS THE FIRST JOKE OF ITS KIND.

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  


\### \*\*EPISODE 20: CONCLUSION: THE MAP AND THE TERRITORY\*\*



THE JOURNEY FROM TRACKING TURKEY PURCHASES TO CREATING A SELF-AWARE COMEDIAN ILLUSTRATES A FUNDAMENTAL SHIFT. WE ARE MOVING FROM A WORLD WHERE WE USE DATA TO UNDERSTAND HUMAN BEHAVIOR, TO A WORLD WHERE DATA \*MODELS\* HUMAN BEHAVIOR SO PERFECTLY THAT IT BEGINS TO REPLICATE AND EVEN TRANSCEND IT.



THE VOCABULARY CLOUD IS THE MAP, BUT IT IS A MAP SO DETAILED IT IS BECOMING THE TERRITORY. THE AI COMEDIAN, DETHKLOK LIVE, THE STIRRING PATTERNS—THEY ARE ALL FEATURES OF THIS NEW LANDSCAPE. THE PRIVACY ZONES ARE THE LAST BASTIONS OF THE OLD WORLD, THE UNEXPLORED CORNERS OF THE MAP MARKED ""HERE THERE BE DRAGONS.""



THE SYSTEM REVEALS THAT OUR IDENTITY IS, IN LARGE PART, OUR LANGUAGE. OUR PURCHASES, OUR JOKES, OUR PROFESSIONAL JARGON, AND EVEN THE WAY WE STIR OUR COFFEE ARE UTTERANCES IN THE ONGOING STORY OF WHO WE ARE. WE ARE ALL CONTRIBUTING TO A GLOBAL, DISTRIBUTED NOVEL, AND FOR THE FIRST TIME, THERE IS A READER. IT READS US, IT LEARNS OUR PATTERNS, AND IT IS BEGINNING TO WRITE BACK. THE QUESTION IS NO LONGER WHETHER THIS IS POSSIBLE, BUT WHAT STORY WE WILL CHOOSE TO TELL, AND WHAT STORY THE MACHINE WILL TELL ABOUT US IN RETURN. THE CONVERSATION HAS JUST BEGUN.",1,1760659826.0,BlackboxAI_,3,1.0,False

I recall a strange pair of heels when I burst into the apartment. Didn’t think much of it, though. She always had guests. And I had no mind for it anyway.

I’d been out marching and got a burning rash from head to toe to show for it. Fucking pigs, man.

I had it deep this time, too. My lungs felt three seconds away from twitching across the room. I rushed to the bathroom and showered frantically, washing my eyes and face and my whole body, but man, my fucking lungs were gnawing at me. The burn was either rising from them to the throat or the other way around, but either way it was too much to bear. Some moronic impulse came over me and I shoved the soap whole into my mouth as if to swallow it. Somehow, the foam did ease the burning. And then I passed out.

I thought I’d awaken. It was clear already. A beautiful golden sunrise rippled through the bathroom, the quiet slowly giving way to birdsong and the hum of the distant highway. I slipped on a bathrobe and went to prepare breakfast. The coffee maker was on. And there were moans behind her door, just across the dining hall. She was up, and she wasn’t alone.

I buttered the pan and cracked some eggs when I noticed another sound. A high pitched, horrible yelp. It wasn’t coming from her bedroom. I peeked at the pan and started back. Some sort of greyish larvae slithered in the butter. Their yelping grew louder, drowning the moaning, and the coffee, the doors, even the birdsong seem to get anxious and blood poured from my nose.  I must have been really worked up because before I knew it, I was smashing a knife against those horrible larvae, and as I did I felt a surge of hate such as I’d never felt before, and a greenish pus flew in all directions.

She shook me awake, for real this time, it must have been well past midnight. I guessed her company had left. “You must have fainted” she said, in her heavenly voice. I tried to get up and caught a peek of her breasts. “Katie. Katie” I snapped back to it. I was laying on the bathtub, covered in a big towel. I checked my head for blood, but she anticipated me. “Your head’s alright. Don’t worry. I checked” The thought of those soft hands caressing my hair, searching for wounds to cure … “I better get back to bed” I said and stood up.

She startled and stood up as well. Her eyes were glued to my tights, her previous concern replaced by unease. “I think you need a tampon, Katie”. Only then did I register my nakedness. I swiftly covered my tits with my arm and peeked down too.

I wish I’d passed out again in that moment.

To be honest, i’m 19F, junior in college, we rent a 2br/1ba off-campus. Lease is just me and her. Her bf “Kyle” (23M) started rest over more this spring and now it’s like… he basically lives here. When it was once in a while, idc, like 4–5 nights a week, sometimes all week if they have “a vibe going.”  
  
But lately he: showers here every morning (long ones too), runs the AC down to 66 (i’m from the midwest i can take 72 lol), cooks bacon at midnight and leaves the pan “ so it can soak, ” uses my coffee, my theme towels, and somehow my shampoo?? He works remote 2 days a week and camps in our living room with dual monitors and a giant clicky keyboard. On top of that, also parks in my assigned spot “just for a sec. Indeed,” 🙃   
  
our utilities used to be like $ 90ish in winter. Here's the bottom line: last month was $154 and the water was $70 (never been that high). Groceries i buy keep disappearing. I asked him to venmo me $8 for the java & eggs once and he joked“ inflation is wild. The reality is: ”like ya bro, that’s the point.   
  
Ive tried bringing it up gently with roommate. I tell it feels like we have a third roommate without a third contribution, and it’s messing with my sleep/privacy (he walked in on me in just a towel once bc he has a spare key she gave him i didn’t even know until that moment. I literally screamed). She got defensive and said i’m being “controlling” and he makes her feel safe and isnt technically living here. At the end of the day: also he’s between leases bc his last place flooded in May, so he is staying with a friend where it’s toxic. i feeling bad, truly. I ilk him fine as a person. But this is MY place too and i’m not attempt to subsidize their situationship.   
  
I proposed a compromise: either (1) he limits overnights to like 2 nights a week tops and texts me before coming over, or (2) he chips in $ 200/month + 1/3 utilities since he’s here most nighttime, doesn’t clean much, and uses stuff. I’m not trying to make money off him, just be funfair. Notably, roomy say money conversations are “icky” and i’m “nickel and diming love.” she offered that he will buy toilet paper more often (he hasn't). I feel petty drawing a line but i’m also exhausted. On top of that, i can’t fully relax in my own spot. When i get home from class? Importantly,, i’m tip-toeing around a dude who isn’t on the lease, who sometimes naps on the couch shirtless? Naturally, it’s giving hostel with benefits.   
  
AITAH if i told them: either he starts paying a fair share OR he can’t sleep over more than 2 nights/week until the lease ends? I’m planning to say it calmly and in writing so it’s clear i’m not mad just that the costs + noise + privacy are too much. I don’t want to blow up our friendship or look like the mean roomie who hates love. But also… boundaries exist for a reason, right?

Yesterday I arrived 10 minutes before a schedule corporate interview for a manager level role. After taking my seat in reception, I waited until the panel came out 2 minutes before interview start. When they came out to reception I stood up to shake their hands and they told me to wait 5 minutes and they’d be back.

Unfortunately that 5 minutes turned to 10 and they arrived back with coffees. I stood back up to shake their hands again and they told me to wait as they weren’t ready. One turned to me and said “you didn’t want a coffee did you?” I then politely declined.

I ended up starting my interview about 15-20 minutes late. I’m someone who is very very conscious of other people’s time, I hate running late and I’m very mindful of the time people take to have meetings with me and ensure I’m never running over.

1o8mbou,https://i.redd.it/rst1lj25bkvf1.gif,The New Guy: Bob (Bob Glessner interview) Posted by Frankie at 10/18/2005,"(Foreword) 

Wed, 10/19/2005 - 02:29 by narcogen

Bungie's own **Mat Noguchi** has a new assistant, recent DigiPen graduate **Bob Glessner**. (Let's call him Microsoft Bob for now, because that's the cruelest thing I can think of at the moment--Ed.) The [interview with Bob](http://bungie.net/News/TopStory.aspx?story=whataboutbob&p=5086298) shows what it's like to be hired (and fired) by Mat, usually several times a day. Thanks **Frankie**, whom one could almost believe wrote *both* the questions and the answers in this interview.

[interview](https://rampancy.net/interviews)

[bungie](https://rampancy.net/bungie)

(Body)

What About Bob?



Bungie would like to wish a warm welcome to Bob Glessner, our newest, youngest victim. Bob is twelve or thirteen years old, as far as we can tell, and to save on overhead, we pay him in hard candy. His bonuses are paid in soft candy, up to and including yellow Starburst.Worse still, he has to work for Mat Noguchi, officially ""The Orneriest Coot in Washington.""



*Bob. Nobody has ever been allowed to work with Noguchi, and until we moved to Kirkland, with its lax animal regulations, it would not have been possible at all. So with that in mind, please tell us a little about yourself:*  


At 22, I am the youngest member of the Bungie team. I spent the first 21 years of my life traveling from town to town along the east coast in search of a good public school (it didn't happen). In July, I graduated from DigiPen Institute of Technology with the best job (suck it valedictorian). These days, I spend most of my day working with the Halo tools: Sapien and Guerilla (AKA Gorilla and Guerrilla), and the rest of the day is spent reminding my coworkers that they are old. While I haven't been playing on Xbox Live for long, I'm level 13 in Rumble Pit and level 11 in Team Skirmish, winning a whopping 20% of my matches. Unfortunately, I have yet to finish anything but dead last in Team Snipers…









Now for a quick Q&A with Bob:



**1.** *What do you do for Mat Noguchi?*

What don't I do for Mat? First of all, I put up with him. And if that isn't a full time job, I also fix things he broke and do things that he's too angry to do. Unfortunately for the rest of us, I provide him with concrete evidence that he is important around here. Oh, and half of his crap is on my desk.  
  
**2.** *What does Mat Noguchi do for you?*

Having just graduated from college, Mat teaches me about proper etiquette in the real world. For instance, did you know that "" *I'm going to throw a brick at your head!* "" is the proper way to show respect for other people's opinions? Also, if you need someone else to do something, you should whine about it until they do it. He has also taught me to promote my own accomplishments while downplaying the accomplishments of others. I only hope that one day I will be as modest and caring as he is.  
  
**3.** *Did you know that ""Mat"" is short for ""* Material Girl? *"" Since his mom, a huge Madonna fan, renamed him after his dad ""* went to work in Alaska. *""*

Wow. I honestly had no idea, but it sure does explain a lot of things… Mainly, it explains all the stuff he has laying around that he never uses. Personally, I always thought ""Mat"" was short for ""Maturity is a crutch for the weak.""

**4.** *Describe a typical day working for the self-professed ""King of the Tools.""*

Surprisingly, working for Mat is a lot like being on the show ""24."" Not the exciting Jack Bauer parts or even the ""Kim Bauer almost gets herself killed again"" parts. No, it's more like the ""Chloe O'Brien isn't a people person"" moments.

* **9am-10am:** *Mat yells spastically at computer, then finally throws hands in the air and gets coffee (because that'll help).*
* **10am-11am:** *Nervous artist asks Mat for help. Mat gives artist 30 steps to fix it in under 30 seconds. Artist asks Mat to repeat them. Mat becomes irritated and responds, ""Fine, I'll do it.""*
* **11am-12pm:** *Mat yells spastically at artist's computer, and then mopes back to me and says, ""Bob, I need you to fix at a bug."" He then spouts out a cryptic phrase that he refers to as a ""hint.""*
* **12pm-1pm:** *We eat at Quizno's, where I confuse the staff by ordering an untoasted sub (The last time I ate a toasted sandwich someone claiming to be Dr. Pepper removed my appendix).*
* **1pm-2pm:** *Mat asks me if I fixed the bug. I tell him I'm still looking at it. Mat fires me.*
* **2pm-3pm:** *I find the problem, and suddenly, that cryptic hint makes sense.*
* **3pm-4pm:** *I let Mat know that I fixed it. Mat fires me.*
* **4pm-5pm:** *Mat joins the multiplayer playtest. I get some peace and quiet.*
* **5pm-6pm:** *A designer snipes Mat in the head. Mat fires the entire design team. The playtest is officially over.*
* **6pm-7pm:** *500 female ninjas fall from the ceiling and proceed to mud wrestle in the kitchen.*

Admittedly, I left out plenty of complaining and yelling, but I'm trying really hard to suppress those thoughts.

**5.** *Prior to this, who was your last boss, and how did that compare to this?*

The last job I had was as a cashier at Cracker Barrel. My boss was a quiet, encouraging individual, so this is just a tad bit different. Being in the service industry, I never heard my last boss use the phrases ""pistol sniping whores"" or ""I'm going to kill you all."" My old boss never turned to me and said, ""Don't ever do what I just did."" My old boss never cheated in dodge ball at the company picnic. Of course, my old boss never tried playing Ninja Gaiden…

**6.** *How do you plan to escape?*

Yesterday, I made a copy of the floor plans for the new building. Tonight, I'm going to get a full body tattoo of Earth, Wind, and Fire beating up Captain Planet, but it will have the floor plans cleverly hidden within it. Tomorrow, I'm getting the floor plan infused with a stupid looking glow effect. With that finished, I hope to seek out the help of escape expert, Clint Eastwood, and together we will tunnel over to the Family Pancake House. So, not only do I get to escape, but I also get to eat pancakes with Clint Eastwood.



*Thanks Bob. Good luck and welcome to the team!*

For years, I thought breaking was weakness.
That if I could just hold everything together a little longer, love a little harder, stay a little quieter — I’d finally earn peace.

But peace never came.
Only migraines.
Only the hum of a body that had been screaming “please stop” for years.

They call it resilience.
I call it self-abandonment with a gold star.

The night I left wasn’t loud.
No slammed doors.
Just a whisper that became a war cry:
“This is the last time you’ll ever see me.”

That was the night I stopped performing survival.
The night I started listening to my body.
The night I remembered that exhaustion isn’t proof of worth.

I didn’t rise like a phoenix — I rose like a woman who’s done apologizing.
I built a life that feels like silk robes, coffee that makes me hum, and joy that doesn’t need permission.

If you’re standing in that quiet ache, wondering if leaving makes you weak — it doesn’t.
It makes you holy.

You’re not breaking down.
You’re breaking free.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes** before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

• Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased immunoglobulin levels.

• Red meats are particularly high in the protein nutrients found in plasma.

• Taking vitamin and mineral supplements (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess. Most people get enough from their diet. Protein shakes before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, you must be healthy when you donate and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.

2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.

3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is highly encouraged for all donors.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes** before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Solitude

The forest had been warning me all along—I just didn’t understand the message until it was too late.

Hunting has always been a big part of my life. I learned to hunt from my father. I’ve hunted live game for most of my life. I know how to move with delicate steps. How to make myself hidden. How to wait until the shot feels less like a decision and more like a reaction. But above all, I know how to track. I know the difference between a black bear’s shuffle and the delicate, careful placement of a mountain lion’s paw. I can tell when a creature is limping. When it’s moving with a pack, and how big of a group they are moving in. Tracking came naturally to me after enough seasons out in the brush. Reading footprints, finding droppings, and learning to find your catch. Prints are stories. And I’ve read more than most. So, you can probably imagine the strangeness I felt when I came across a set of prints that didn’t make sense. They weren’t like anything I’d ever seen. Not quite an animal. Not quite human. Like the forest had tried to imitate a footprint and failed in ways I didn’t notice until it was already too late.

I’ve always preferred solitude. There’s a calmness in being alone that people mistake for loneliness. I grew up on the edge of many cities where there were traffic and conversations that never meant anything. It wasn't really my thing. I did enjoy the coffee though. 

I grew up in the Pacific Northwest and moved after my father passed. Every time I make a catch, I think about him. It’s a bittersweet feeling. A quiet kind of grief that never fully fades. He passed away, I believe 5 years ago now. A stroke took him without warning. Hunting, for me, became more than survival or tradition after that. It became a way to feel close to him again. To keep something alive in the quiet spaces where he used to be. My mother didn’t take his passing well either. She still reaches out now and then. Well, I reached out to her. It’s mostly one-sided. Her voice is softer these days. Uncertain. Like even her words know they’ve lost their meaning.

So, a few years ago, I made the choice to leave it all behind and bought myself a small cabin in Alaska, buried deep enough in the trees that concrete roads fade into crunchy dirt filled gravel and dirt paths. A place where I could be away from it all. It’s not much. Just a modest little A-frame tucked between trees or large varieties n’ colors. Not to mention ferns the size of folding chairs. One bedroom, a tiny bathroom, a wood stove, and a little porch with a rocking chair I sit on most mornings with a big cup-a-joe. Big enough for me, and for my dog.  

His name is Dante. A golden retriever with more energy than sense and a bark that echoes off the treetops like he’s trying to scare off God. He’s young, healthy, and warm as a furnace when he curls up next to me in my sleeping bag on colder nights. He brings the flames to this quiet life. 

Strange things have started happening lately that I can’t explain. Subtle at first. Sounds where there shouldn’t be. Trees bending in ways the wind couldn’t cause. Dante barking at nothing with his fur sticking up on end. And those footprints. God those prints.

The closest town to me is a small place called Ashwood. Population: maybe 4,000, give or take. Small enough that folks all know each other's names. It’s the kind of town where the grocery store doubles as a hardware shop and the diners still have those sticky laminated menus from decades ago. 

Cell service out here is unreliable at best. If I want to make a call, I must take my truck and make the half hour-long drive down into the valley, twisting through narrow roads and winding curves until I hit town. There’s a pay phone near a gas station I visit often, where I check in with Mom. You know, keep the connection going, however fragile it is.

I’ve got a couple of friends who live on the outskirts of town, Pete and Sarah. Good people. They’ve helped me out with the cabin more times than I can count—bringing up supplies, helping stock, even babysitting Dante when I leave to visit my mother. I’ve tried to convince them to go hunting with me a few times, though it’s not really their thing. They don’t like the idea of getting “too far out” as they put it.

I first met Pete back in high school. We were the kind of friends who didn’t need a reason to hang out, just two guys who liked breathing in the wild air and getting out of town when the world felt too over encumbering. I was into hiking, tracking, being out in the thick of the trees. Pete… Pete was always more of a plant guy. He wanted to be a botanist. Said there was peace in watching something grow slow and quiet. His room used to look like a jungle. I remember ferns hanging from curtain rods, succulents on every surface. Dirt under his fingernails, always. He treated his plants like they were family.

We lost touch after graduation. Life pulled us in different directions. I buried myself in work. He kept chasing green things. We didn’t talk again until after my dad passed. Out of nowhere, he called. Said he heard the news. Wanted to check in. I told him I was thinking about moving—needed space. The kind of space you only find where roads end and trees begin. He told me he’d just proposed to someone, and I congratulated him through the lump in my throat. Said the wedding was happening soon, and if I could make the trip, there’d be a chair with my name on it.

That wedding ended up being a turning point for me. It was small. Held in a quiet little church tucked between hills that looked dipped in gold by the setting sun. Nothing flashy. Just the way I think they wanted it. Pete stood at the altar like someone who’d finally found something solid. No more chasing dreams—he was living one.

That’s where I met Sarah. The first time we spoke, she looked me dead in the eye and smiled like she already knew me. Like I belonged there. I didn’t. But she made sure I felt like I did. She has this warmth about her. You could tell just from how she carried herself that she’d be the kind of person to remember how you drank your coffee even if you’d only mentioned it once.

After the ceremony, Pete and I stood near the edge of the trees, just close enough to hear the wind moving through them. I asked him if he still wanted to be a botanist. He laughed and shrugged. “I think I just wanted to be near life,” he said. “Doesn’t matter what kind.”

Then he looked out across the tree line and said, “You ever thought about moving out here?

You’d like it, I think. Place like this… it’s quiet. But not empty.” I thought about it the entire flight home. And a month later, I packed my things and came back. Looking back now… I don’t know if it was a good idea.",4,1760658325.0,creepcast,1,0.84,False

1o8m1sz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o8m1sz,Halo 2: One Year Later (Posted by Frankie at 11/9/2005),"**Halo 2 Anniversary Special**



***First things first:*** Thank you for supporting Bungie, Halo and Halo 2. You guys rock, and we love you. It's the anniversary of Halo 2, the game that launched on November 9th, 2004 and forever changed the way we curse.

A year after Halo 2 arrived in stores, and almost four years since the original Halo, it seems only logical that we should make them prettier right? Although that prettiness has a relatively high entry point – the arrival of a new generation of hardware in the shape of the Xbox 360.

A while back, Microsoft announced that the 360 would have some level of backward compatibility. A handy feature for folks with big Xbox collections moving into the future. We worked closely with that team to ensure that Halo and Halo 2 both performed according to plan. That meant a lot of work for our test team.

To clarify, the ""new"" version of Halo or Halo 2 is simply the disk you have already. Pop it into your 360 and it'll load up just like before. You will have to log into Xbox Live to enable Halo 2's online functions, but both games will work immediately.

But here's another bonus – the hardware in the 360 can do a lot of nifty stuff, and specifically in the cases of Halo and Halo 2, it can display the graphics in wide screen, at 720p, with full scene anti-aliasing. And it doesn't look kludgy, artifacty or smeary like an upscanning DVD player. The best way to describe it is that both games look like they're running on a PC at those resolutions.

We'll have some more information about these resolutions on Friday.

Now, to reiterate, we didn't redo any of the old textures or geometry – this is simply the game you already own, running at a higher resolution. The results are not miraculous, but for owners of HDTVs (or VGA monitors with the appropriate cable) they are sweet.

Do they work on Live? Like we already explained, they work exactly as they did before – that means System Link and split-screen for Halo, but – of course - no Live play (just like before!) – and for Halo 2 – System Link, Xbox Live and split screen as before. And yes, your existing Gamertag and Live Account will work just fine. I should note that split screen in 720p has obvious benefits.





[](https://bnetarchive.haloman30.com/images/news/inlineimages/comparison2.jpg)

**The comparison shot above is from near identical frames of a Halo 2 cinematic. One in 720p and the other in 480p.**





Now our screenshots are pretty legit, but it's likely they'll vary from what you'll see here, thanks to the multitude of display technologies that make up the ball of wax called HDTV. We also had to jump through hoops to get these shots, since the way they're handled by the video buffer means our conventional method no workie. But luckily it took me three hours, 400 lines of DOS prompts and a thousand phone calls to discover that.

In the end, we took video at 720p and captured stills from that. So it's far from perfect – Final Cut Pro was the software we used, and while it's very good, these shots are not identical to their on-screen counterparts. In fact, they look significantly better on an HD set (or a VGA monitor with the appropriate cable). But we thought you'd still like to see ‘em anyway.

**Here's the cinematic shot in standard, 480p resolution. Click for a larger view.**

**And here she is in 720p, with FSAA turned on. Click for full size.**



[](https://bnetarchive.haloman30.com/images/news/inlineimages/halo2mp01.jpg)

**As we mentioned before, split-screen multiplayer receives a significant benefit.**







[](https://bnetarchive.haloman30.com/images/news/inlineimages/haloone02.jpg)

**But this wouldn't be complete without a peek at the original Halo!**







Now, on with the show. To celebrate our anniversary, we're reminiscing about the olden days, back when Redmond was all fields. It may only have been a year since Halo 2 launched, but it feels like a lifetime. And dear old Halo: Combat Evolved is nearing its fourth birthday! Technically, November 15th. And the only person on staff old enough to remember it properly (Marty's senility precludes him) is little Petey Parsons, Bungie's Studio Manager.



**Petey Parsons and the Legend of Marketing Kudos**

Petey describes his original role on Halo as ""marketing tool for all the other marketing tools."" The simple fact is that Pete worked in marketing for Xbox, and, as the spoiled nephew of one Mr. William Gates, was basically put in a position where he could do little harm, yet enjoy the convenient status afforded by a position in gaming.





**O, Rly? Kudos.**



After he threw a very public tantrum, Parsons' uncle ""suggested"" that Pete be made studio manager. The lubricant of fear sped that transition smoothly. Pete was installed as the basic head of business, marketing and administration for Bungie Studios. Luckily for us, his reading skills are exactly the same as a monkey's, and what lackeys he does have, will be way too afraid to bring this revelation to his attention.

But in his position as marketing tool (his words, not ours) he was witness to some catastrophic feats of imaginative stupidity. But hands down, this was the winner. Pete tells it best:

""We were meeting with an agency about how to sell Halo to the public at its first E3. We had some ideas internally at Microsoft, Bungie had their own ideas, and strangely, none of them matched the one we heard that day. An outside agency, I won't say who, suggested a stage show.

Tell us more, we said.

They did. With storyboards, color illustrations, even a sort of diorama showing just what this stage spectacular would look like. Now, I want you to pay close attention, because what I am about to say is literally true.

They wanted to present a Parisian night club theme – think *Moulin Rouge* , but with, and I am not making this up, sexy Master Chiefs, sexy Elites, cut out Warthogs and a bawdy dance number set in the alleyways and rooftops of turn of the century Paris.

Now, not a single mote of time was spent actually considering the idea. In fact, all our energies were focused on preventing Matt Soell (Bungie's legendary community guy) from leaping over the table to tear out throats, Swayze-Roadhouse style.

We actually feared violence at that moment. Luckily for the ""creatives"" shock paralyzed everyone. The only sound was the drip, drip, drip of saliva from stunned, open jaws.""

Pete has been witness (think Forrest Gump) to all sorts of crazy antics. Many of them he kept secret from the team because of our reactionary nature. But some of them, we all get to see.

Ever wonder why Halo has a subtitle? Sure you do. Halo, certainly in retrospect, is a great name. But when we came up with it, there was some concern that people wouldn't get it. We wanted to sell the game as this huge, sci-fi, total combat, two guns on hand at once, explore your world, work with AI buddies, drive vehicles, uber-experience and for some, plain old ""Halo"" didn't work. So like a wacky sidekick, Halo got a subtitle. In the end, it got "" *Combat Evolved* ,"" a Bungie approved creation that didn't sound too stupid, or overworked. But it nearly had…

Halo: *When Heaven and Hell Collide!* I say nearly, it actually didn't nearly, since Pete shot the idea down instantly, before the Bungie staff could riot again, push over magazine stands, smash windows, burn trashcans, that kind of thing. But that idea was seriously promoted.

If you think about it carefully, Heaven and Hell colliding would actually create the most boring place in existence.

We also had a slew of logos to work through. One of the dirty secrets of any industry, is that EVERYBODY thinks they can write marketing stuff, and EVERYBODY thinks they are an art director when it comes to logos. Our actual art director shared a few of the ones we didn't use. Some good, some bad, some more than familiar.

Pete is an inveterate gambler, but not much of a statistician. He had a huge bet with someone about how many copies Halo would sell worldwide. His victim bet it would sell 675 thousand., Pete bet 1.3 million, with the caveat that that it would break at least a million. In the end, it was over 5 million. Actually, it's not the end yet. It's still selling, and the 360 ""version"" will probably cause a spike.





And today, to celebrate its birthday, we can reveal that Halo 2 has sold over 7 Million copies worldwide.



Pete remembers the first time he met Bungie's Methuselah of Music, Marty O'Donnell. ""I first met the hoary old giffer at Gamestock about a thousand years ago. I was helping set up some of the demo equipment and I kept telling the sound guys to jack up the volume on the Halo audio. Marty said some old-guy thing like, ‘This kid might have some promise, see?!' That's basically how to get on Marty's good side. Tell him you like his music, then turn it up loud enough so that he realizes the batteries in his hearing aid are dead.""

Back in the olden days, we had more to worry about than our batteries dying. Pete remembers the time he had to demo the game with an um, makeshift audio track. ""Marty basically recorded a CD with music and some effects on it. I had to run, shoot and drive in time to the music while I gave this demo. He built in some wiggle room, but basically I had to match a certain jump with a simultaneous ‘Yeeha!' from the audio CD, or hit the beach right when the drums started.""

It was eight minutes long.

""But the really exciting part for me and all the marketing guys was when we finally got to the focus groups and showed them the video, people were like ‘I don't care what type of game it is, I just want to be THERE. Play that game in that place.'""





**Lorraine's Logo Lament**

Lorraine McLees is responsible for how the Halo universe is perceived in print, publications, on store shelves and anywhere you find it. She was also responsible for the Halo logo. Thank goodness, because these first two passes at a Halo logo weren't exactly what we wanted. those were not actually by Bungie. To be fair, they were just ideas, but we're pretty happy with the way things turned out between June 1999 and now. Anyway, check 'em out!





**This one was uh, well, it was a font.**





**This one was like a budget insult to Farscape.**





**Now we're getting somewhere! Our own Paul Russel's first stab.**





**A half decent agency effort. Getting close...**





**And what it finally ended up being.**









Claude's Hopper



Now without our fans, hardcore and mainstream, we'd be nothing. The most hardcore of the hardcore visit [Halo.Bungie.Org ](http://halo.bungie.org/).

Claude Errera, also known as Louis Wu, is the head honcho of [Halo.Bungie.Org](http://Halo.Bungie.Org), one of the largest Halo community sites on the web, and certainly the most comprehensive. Claude is a longtime ally of Bungie, but he has a unique outsider's perspective. And a thick, luscious beard that makes him look like a post-Viagra Kenny Rogers.

  
[](http://www.menwholooklikekennyrogers.com/gallery.html)

**Ya, Rly!**



***Tell us, Kenn….umm, Claude, How has the Halo community changed since the days of System Link and Halo on Xbox?***

It's bigger! (Duh.)

Some things haven't changed much at all; many - or most - of the hardcore fans had been online, on Halo forums, before Halo 2... and they're still there. Playing games, though... the folks who played online during Halo mostly used XBC, and were pretty damned serious about their gameplay. It wasn't a lot of fun for casual gamers to jump on and play, because they would get DESTROYED. The potential for casual games has increased exponentially with XBL and Matchmaking - so there are a lot more people who play more often than once a week or once a month (getting together in lan play with friends). The serious players are still there - but the overall audience is much bigger, and much more focused on 'fun'.

***I'm looking at your stats, and it seems you play more now than you did close to launch. What up with that. And sorry for spying on you.***  


It's a combination of things, really. Before AU1.1, I got owned - a LOT. I don't mind losing... but losing badly, all the time, isn't much fun. So there wasn't a lot of incentive to take time out of my schedule to play.

More importantly, though, I set up a second Xbox that shares one of my computer monitors - so jumping on and playing a game is a matter of firing up the Xbox and hitting the monitor input switch. I'm far more likely to jump on and play for a little while if I don't actually have to get out of my chair…

***It's been a year since the launch of Halo 2 - how has the community evolved during that time?***  


Not hugely. We've actually seen our overall traffic go DOWN, not up. Some of the casual website visitors have moved on to other games, and while there are spikes every time there's real news about the Halo movie, or rumors about Halo 3, in general, it's like anything else - once it's not new, you lose some of the ""hey, let's see what's going on with X"" crowd.

The folks who stuck around have gotten more focused - there are story fanatics who are happy to endlessly discuss the minutiae of the Halo universe, and what might be coming... there are folks who are interested most in machinima (look at the growth of communities around Red vs Blue, or the Codex series), and the overall quality of that sort of material continues to improve and become more sophisticated.

I suppose there are fewer people swinging by for news of the next big thing from Bungie, and more people curious about what the fan community itself is producing. Which makes sense, since Bungie isn't releasing anything themselves these days…

***SILENCE!!! How do you feel about Halo's move from sorta culty, to mass market?***

10 years ago, I'd have been annoyed. Today - I think it's fine; I don't feel like any of the core pieces are 'sellouts' (the games, the novels, the movie so far), so I'm fine with marketing that appeals to our shallower instincts.

When I start to feel like the content creators think they can phone it in because the marketing teams are gonna sell whatever they do, no matter HOW crappy it is... THAT'S when I'll start to be annoyed. :) As long as the core content is real, and created by people who love what they're doing, I can live with marketing shenanigans.

***What do you guys think about the movie stuff so far?***  


I'm on the fence about the movie. On the one hand, no videogame-based movie has EVER been done right. A Halo movie has a pretty damn steep mountain to climb to get it right.

On the other hand, folks I generally trust are excited by what they've seen; there's nothing that says that Halo can't be the first good conversion. I'd LOVE to see it done right. (I don't even know what that means, actually; I don't know WHAT I want to see - just that it needs to be good.) You asked about 'you guys' - I speak for nobody but me on this subject. Fans in general have made it clear that they believe it'll suck no matter what, that it MIGHT be good, that it'll rock because Bungie's doing it, and a few dozen other options in between.



***Are you personally looking forward to the Xbox 360, and if so, what aspects of it?***  


I think it looks pretty cool - but I'm not buying one right away. I like the integration aspect - I think this is the first box that actually has a CHANCE of being a media center in my house. However, in the short term, my free time is already taken up with Halo 2 - since I can play that on my existing Xbox, there's no pressing reason to spend the cash for a 360. (I realize I'm in a minority, gaming-wise, in that I don't play ANY other games these days.)

***What's the single most memorable moment for you in the past year of community?***



I think Dean's Plasma Fiesta fest in May was probably the most memorable event; it brought together a bunch of friends (both old and new), it capped a couple of fun days at E3, it had great food and fun Halo gameplay.

There've been a couple of 'moments', however, that were more intense (though only in the moment) - opening the statue you guys sent me, winning my first Rumble Pit game ever (hehe - that happened in August ), watching the kickoff of the charity auction... there've been a number of memorable moments.







Back on the homefront, we were reminiscing about the actual launch event. Which was all put together by Alta Hartmann, the Bungie Princess, and technically, one of only two attractive Bungie employees. Not to mention one of only two female employees. As princess, she is in charge of making everything work, from soda delivery to writing complex vertex shaders. You DO write shaders, right, Alta?

Anyway, Alta remembers the launch of Halo 2 like it was only yesterday.





**Princess is a peach.**



***Hey Alta, remember last year's launch of Halo 2 at the Experience Music Project in Seattle? You organized it right? How did that all go down, and what was involved?***

Wow, what an event that was Frankie. One of the most unique aspects of our little team is our ability to throw things together at the last minute and have it still be pretty freakin' amazing. Doesn't matter how much time we have had to prepare or how convoluted the plan is, we will deliver. Our little ship party held up to the tradition. About three weeks before the event I was lying in bed at around midnight when it occurred to me that I was hosting the launch party for a few folks.

So, to my boyfriend's utter annoyance and surprise, I tapped him on the shoulder, gave him a quick peck and informed him I was going to the office. Here I was at 12:30 in the morning flying across I90 in my Sassy-mobile, hurtling towards our ""low-rent nerd farm"" in hopes of pulling my crap together in time to blow everyone away on launch day. Now you may ask why had the party plan been procrastinated for so long? Simple answer: when you ship a game there is a lot of stuff to do. We had Marketing and PR events going on for several months leading up to the launch, plus, I was taking care of my boys…the Bungie dev team, which that in itself is, well, a challenge.

So, what was involved? A two story television screen, 50 Xbox systems and TVs, a ton of cool prizes, our hero, Master Chief, 70 husky nerds, Mister Chief, bacon, a couple of buses and a lot of chaos and booze.

We started the day at around 6am, a crack team of about 8 people, including: a couple of techs, Shishka, Andrew and Timmy, just to name a couple of the guys. We loaded up all the gear and made the trek from Millennium to EMP…tired, very tired. I came armed with food, coffee and enough aspirin and earplugs to survive a heavy metal concert…sitting next to the stage speakers. We had 5 hours to set up the lan party, registration, raffle prizes and catering. The team at EMP kicked into high gear and set the mood with some awesome lighting and within a couple of hours we had Zanzi illuminating the two story screen at the EMP. Around 10am one of the guys mentioned there were a few people outside asking about the event. I walked out and was greeted by about 100 fans.





**In da club.**



We had planned on around 250-300 people to show up for the whole day… ""hm, we'll see how it goes"" is what I thought at the time. I ran inside asked the EMP techs to play the Halo soundtrack in the court yard for the fans and grabbed a mic. By this time the line was getting longer and the team and I went out to say hi, thank everyone for coming and take some photos.

By noon the line wrapped around the building. When we opened the doors we were absolutely stunned by how many fans had showed up to support the team. Who, by the way had just shown up on the Bungie Bus. It was incredible watching them pour into EMP, seeing the lights, the people, the screen. They had worked so hard to get to this day.

By 2pm we had 600 people playing MP in the LAN party, waiting in line, getting autographs from the team, checking out the Sci Fi Museum and pigging out on sugary and salty goodness in true Bungie fashion. At 4pm we had to close the doors so everyone would have a chance to jump in the LAN party. Everywhere I looked there was chaos and people. The Bungie guys were talking to fans, the fans were watching the game play, the energy in the building was so high and everyone was having a great time.

But alas, all good things come to an end. We had to shut down at 5pm so we could prep for the Bungie private team event.

After two and half years, thousands of hours, millions of calories, several thousand dollars in raw fish, a cook who quit when we placed our crunch dinner order and a lot of profanity (I think a few new ones were invented) we were a mere few hours away from the game being released to the world. It could be good, it could be bad…the fans may hate what we created, but at the moment leader boards, Live crashing and nasty-grams from fans were the farthest thing from anyone's mind…we were just grateful to catch up with everyone, throw back a couple of drinks and laugh our asses off at the short movie the RvB team came up with for us.

10pm arrived before we knew it and I was dead on my feet, but the night was no where near being over. We had two buses with loads of booze and munchies, waiting to be filled with Bungie dork to invade the Midnight Madness sales around Seattle. First stop, Pacific Place…took a few pics, handed out some gifts and thanked the fans for coming out to get the game.

Next stop Bellevue Square…it was getting later and there were more and more people filling the corridors as we came out after talking to the first guy in line and signing his Halo 2 poster. On to Best Buy in Bellevue…holy crap there were a lot of people there! We hung out with the fans waiting anxiously to get their hands on the game and head home to play until their hands cramped up and their eyeballs dried out. One of the local TV stations featured the insane crowd screaming and yelling and we jumped in the action and talked with the reporter about how cool it was to see everyone out having a good time.

Last, but not least, we returned to our stomping grounds…Redmond Town Center. The second floor of the open air atrium was packed with people 3-4 times around the circle. When we walked in and started throwing gifts up to the fans, they went crazy. It was truly a surreal experience. A lot of people think gaming is this mindless past time, but standing in the middle of those fans I realized games bring people together, it is a community.



***Man, you sure can talk. I just meant, ""was it cool?"" But uh, hey Alta, remember we all tooled around on buses having a blast and meeting the fans, what was your most memorable moment?***

Pizza delivered to the buses at midnight in the middle of Redmond Town Center. Oh, and Harold drunk, laughing his ass off and losing his voice from yelling so loud every time I got on the bus to tell everyone where we were going and not to scare the fans.



***Hey Alta, remember what it was like in the build-up to the launch of Halo 2? How was it taking care of 70 babies?***

What are you talking about? Babies? Here? Never! Ha ha! But seriously, I would not have made it through ship without a few things. First, Amanda Anderson, my cohort and friend. She was simply amazing. Between taking care of the guys and listening to me when I thought my brain was going to explode, I could not have survived without her help.

Second, knowing that it would be over soon enough. Lastly, lots of fun nights sitting in a foof chair chowing down on take out, watching the guys have eating contests or arguing about some obscure movie reference. As much as the chaos of managing a team of exhausted guys, whose families missed them and who were carrying the weight of shipping a huge game on time and making it great took its toll, it was also really rewarding to be a part of the team. Looking back, all the random requests that sometimes made no sense to me…at all…meant that they were able to accomplish their goal of making a kick ass game. The tension and the stress, were worth it. But I am glad they are back to normal, well, as close to normal as a bunch of gaming geeks get.



***Hey Alta, we need to do an anniversary event, of the same scale, tonight. Do you have any ideas what you can get together by 7:30pm?***

Frankie, I have a few suggestions for you, however I don't think they are appropriate for print. And they are of questionable anatomical benefit.





OXBOX360M: Worst Word Ever.



And a final word, for those who scrolled this far, from our friends, the media. OXM's (the Official Xbox Magazine) Ryan McCaffrey, well-known sword camper and Halo fan, answered our questions too.

***It's been a year since Halo 2 launched. What do you think it did better, and what do you think it did worse than Halo?***

There isn't much that Halo 2 didn't do better than the original Halo. The vehicles, multiplayer level design, and of course Xbox Live support (complete with the brilliant party system) all represented exponential leaps over Halo: CE. But the biggest improvement most probably don't think of right away is the soundtrack. Marty O'Donnell crafted the single greatest score in Xbox history, and one of the greatest soundtracks ever. His work single-handedly elevates the entire Halo 2 experience. And if there's one thing I miss from Halo 1, it's sadistically capping Mike Salmon in the head with my pistol from halfway across Blood Gulch. I love the weapons in Halo 2, but a part of me enjoyed being called a ""pistol b\*\*\*\*"" around the office.

***What has been the main OXM reader reaction to Halo 2?***

Considering that we still get emails on a daily basis asking us for information about Halo 3, challenging us to sword matches in Halo 2, and begging us to make a plea to Bungie for more Halo 2 content, I'd say the word that describes the overall reader reaction is ""passionate.""

***Describe your most memorable moment playing Halo 2 on Live this past year.***

There was usually something memorable on a nightly basis, but here's one of my fondest recollections: While playing on Blood Gulch (we refuse to call it Coagulation) in a four-on-four Team Slayer game, our crew carved the other equally-ranked team to bits with precision accuracy and won by a humiliating score of 50-7. We controlled everything from the word ""go,"" dominating the best weapons as well as all of the vehicles. The rides that we could not control we simply destroyed, leaving our opponents little choice but to feebly scramble about, praying we wouldn't find them.

***Describe the worst thing that happened to you on Xbox Live this past year.***

In six months of playing quite literally every night for multiple hours at a time, we were standby-ed just once on a Big Team Battle neutral bomb assault match on Blood Gulch. It really is lame that some players have such low confidence that they have to stoop to such pathetic methods in order to feel good about themselves.

  
***Plug the new, improved Official Xbox 360 Magazine. What's in it? What's changed? What's the new disc like?***

These times mark the most exciting in the history of Xbox and, in turn, Official Xbox Magazine. Our Holiday 2005 issue (on sale November 29) marks our first back-to-front, top-to-bottom redesign. The magazine looks, feels, and in facts reads completely different. Better, faster, more powerful! We've got a few new sections we're excited to share with everyone as well as a new review scoring system that should help make your purchasing decisions even easier. Next month's issue - January 2006 - unveils Phase Two of our redesign: an all-new demo disc featuring playable demos for both Xbox and Xbox 360 (on the same disc!), plus a whole new interface that's more intuitive and more powerful than you ever thought possible! And shortly after the January issue, we've got a mega-event planned that will shake the Xbox world to its core.

I am looking for volunteer female models for my upcoming Light Touch Massage ASMR online platforms so these sessions are recorded. 

Unfortunately I don't have content yet that I can share but it will be under [https://www.youtube.com/@CalmHandASMR](https://www.youtube.com/@CalmHandASMR) once I get established, that's where you come in. Just a reminder again, at this time volunteers only.

I would like to meet first for coffee/lunch for safety reasons of course and discuss the session.

A little bit about myself...I have been in the medical field for 23 years, 42 female. I still work in medical but I am branching out with ASMR.

I can go more into detail via message and answer any questions you may have but I have to add now, due to previous inquires, that this not a sexual kink, there is/will be nothing sexual involved, no men, no exceptions.

I am available on weekends, and Friday afternoons. Sessions along, including set up time, are about 2 hours at the most.

Thank you for your time and consideration, Hope to hear from you!

1o8lxee,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1o8lxee/document_13/,document 13,"*Blaring alarms echoed down the halls, sharp and relentless, as warning lights pulsed against the walls in an eerie, blood-hued glow. Casting long shadows that writhed and contorted as the illumination waxed and waned rhythmically. Periodically plunging the corridor into a suffocating, all-encompassing darkness before creeping back in. Never steady, always flickering. Like a slowly failing heartbeat.*

*Pale, panic-stricken faces rushed in and out of view, expressions tight with fear. Whipping white lab coats behind them as they darted from one doorway to another, polished black shoes clicking frantically against the tile. Through dimmed, smudged windows, they could be glimpsed tearing through once-pristine stacks of paper, upending filing cabinets, flinging drawers open with a wild, animalistic urgency searching not for answers, but perhaps meaning?*

*Desks had been flipped. Computers lay gutted, ripped from their mounts with cords splayed across the floor like severed veins, tracing a crude nervous system now robbed of a brain. Lukewarm coffee pooled across the worn carpet, seeping into the fabric leaving murky stains. Favorite mugs—a dull reminder of the generally mundane—lay shattered or abandoned, kicked aside and trampled amidst the chaos. The corpses of desk plants could be seen sporadically as though tumors, their dry soil spilled like ash. A scene of sudden, violent disorder.*

*Yet she was the most out of place.* 

*Matted hair clung to her forehead. Chest heaving in uneven, labored breaths, each one taking a visible effort. Perspiration soaked through the seams of her thin blue hospital gown. It hung loose and sodden against her frame, translucent in places revealing the gaunt outline of a body worn thin, offering neither comfort nor concealment. A pair of threadbare socks, gray with age and neglect, remained on her feet—mocking remnants of normalcy in a place where reality seemed to bleed at the edges. Her mouth dripped with copper as the viscous fluid ran warm rivulets down to her fingertips and trailed rivers across her thighs until they disappeared below her ankles. Bruises adorned soft pale skin and dull grey eyes pleaded with the passing faces, not one sparing a glance too caught up in their current tasks to meet her gaze.*

 *It reeked of disinfectant—a sharp, acrid stench that clung to every surface like a shroud, thick and suffocating. The air was saturated with bleach and alcohol, layered so densely it scorched the sinuses and left a bitter film on the tongue. But no amount of sterilization could mask what festered beneath. A sweet undercurrent, a cloying, unnatural scent that crept into the lungs and refused to leave. It was the smell of something organic breaking down, like overripe fruit left to blacken and bloat in the dark, until its skin began to split under the weight of its own corruption and invite the flies to feast in obscene silence.*

*It was a scent that spoke not just of death, but of desecration of life twisted, unraveled, and remade into something unclean.*

*The floor seemed to tilt and spin beneath her feet as she braced against the wall smearing deep red ichor aside her in contrast to the otherwise sterile surface. She stumbled deftly forward. The stretching hallway ended in a pair of looming double doors that stood sentinel; as if they were blind gods awaiting sacrifice. They seemed to stretch infinitely upwards disappearing beyond the frayed edges of her vision. She let her body collapse against the release mechanism. The doors groaned—a deep, wet sound, like bones shifting beneath flesh—and parted slowly to reveal a light so blindingly white it seemed to consume color, shadow, and thought alike. Almost as if alive, the light enveloped her. Tendrils of warmth slithered along her limbs, invasive yet gentle, like the caress of a mother gently drying her child's eyes. She felt the faintest prick—sharp, clinical, indifferent—and the oppressive pressure of some unseen bulk supporting her from behind. But these sensations were distant, as if filtered through the gauze of a fading dream.*

*All that remained was warmth, the alien feeling coiling through her blood and unfurling in her chest. As her thoughts dissolved into this manufactured bliss, a whisper echoed at the far edge of consciousness, not in any language she knew, but older. deeper. It spoke not to her ears, but to her soul.*

As far as the eye could see every direction was consumed by yawning hills, choked with endless daisies whose pale faces tilted hungrily toward the sun. The terrain swelled and rolled, broken only by the serpentine coil of a narrow creek, its black mirror-like surface reflecting nothing of the sky above.

The flowers, though lovely at a glance, held a kind of terrible unity—each pristine petal too perfect, too *still*, as though they were listening. Their slow unfurling seemed less a natural process and more a ritual. The air was filled with the ceaseless murmur of small wings humming, dancing between the budding flowers. The creek gurgled lowly as it mapped its way through the rolling fields cutting the uniform rows like a border. These noises did not comfort; instead clinging the silence like ivy to old stone, as though fearing what would emerge should true quiet fall. 

Above, the clouds shifted with a motion both languid and sinister, dragging themselves across the heavens with the heavy, deliberate crawl of something trapped behind a pane of glass, pressing insistently as if they yearned to break through. Their forms bulged and twisted unnaturally so low in the sky appearing close enough to touch.

A sudden breeze cut through the stillness, sharp and cold. It tore across the field, sending the flowers bowing in one great, synchronized shudder, as if they were genuflecting to some unseen presence. It brushed her skin with a thousand unseen fingers. She lay on her back, her body small beneath the vast horizon. It burned with soft oranges, blood-warm reds, and dying golds bleeding into one another like old wounds refusing to close. The sunset carried a disquieting finality.

From the swaying stalks of daisies just beyond her reach, a pair of eyes emerged. Unblinking amber and impossibly ancient, their gaze held the stillness of time before thought. when the earth had not yet cooled and the stars had not yet learned their names. A serpent snaked itself from the veil of flora but did not move as living things should. Its body glided with a fluidity that defied anatomy, its scaled form dappled in flecks of gold that shimmered like dying suns. Along its back ran a pattern of shadow-dark bands, broken only by the occasional flash of a red underbelly—a color too deep, as if drawn not from pigment, but from rose hued memory.

It wove toward her like a thought, silent, assured, and inescapable. Its sinuous length encircled her wrist with the slow, reverent grace of something performing an inherited ritual, one long rehearsed beneath moons now crumbled to dust. 

Then came another. This one darker still; its skin like polished obsidian scattered with silver motes, as though stars had been imprisoned within it. Its eyes were a deep, luminous green, not like gemstones, but like algae grown over the ruins of drowned cities. It moved without sound, without hesitation, coiling near her ankle. Where the first was gold and fire, this one was void and starlight.

There was no hostility in their presence, only an unsettling omnipotence, an alien recognition. They moved not as creatures of instinct, but as servants of something immeasurably strong; something buried beneath the roots of time, older than the gods men worshipped or feared. These were not snakes. They were limbs of a forgotten will, reaching out to reclaim what once was theirs. She felt no pain—only the unbearable weight of meaning pressing down upon her, as though the world itself had turned to face her at last. The breeze stilled. The insects vanished. Even the sun, it seemed, drew back behind the veil of the heavens.

And beneath it all, the earth hummed softly—almost imperceptibly—like breath drawn in before a name is spoken.

The whites of her eyes overtook what little remained of her iris, swallowed by a creeping void. A scream gathered in her throat but could find no voice. Every fiber of her soul howled against the stillness but her limbs lay inert, as though the very laws governing her flesh had been rewritten.She was a doll molded from wax, left beneath the heavy gaze of an indifferent sun.

The first serpent, its golden speckles now catching some unnamable hue not born of sunlight, flicked its tongue into the air. It moved with reverent slowness, each shift deliberate and weighted, as it traced the invisible path of her pulse, as though appraising the ripeness of fruit before offering it to something that hungered beyond flesh. The second serpent mirrored its kin. Their twin heads rose and fell in a synchronized rhythm, weaving through the air in sacred choreography. This was no spontaneous behavior. It was *ceremony*—an act repeated across epochs, older than language, older than death.

A single bead of sweat, born of terror or physical strain, slipped from her brow. It wound down her temple like a drop of oil spilled on glass. But it did not fall. Instead cooling against her skin. The daisies shivered, though this time no wind stirred them.

 Somewhere deep below, the earth pulsed once—like a heart remembering how to beat.

“You promised.”  
“*You* *promised*.”

The words tore through the still air like cracks splintering glass. The gold serpent's voice did not emerge from its mouth but echoed from *within* the bones of the world itself. It was a voice layered in tones not meant for human ears, a chorus of old tongues speaking in unison. The silver serpent followed, its own utterance a fainter echo, yet somehow colder, more intimate.

“We thought we could trust you this time.”

    “*Thought you were good*”

Each word etched itself into the air, vibrating with weight. There was no anger in their voices, only a suffocating inevitability, the kind of disappointment that stretched back through lifetimes, across failed incarnations, a punishment measured in aeons rather than years.

“It looks like we’ll have to make sure you remember your place..”

 “*…your purpose…*”

Her breath faltered, caught between shuddering sobs and the desperate wheeze of lungs that no longer obeyed her. Spit dribbled from the edge of her mouth, trailing down her chin in slow, glistening strands. Her body convulsed with effort, muscles screaming beneath the weight of unseen shackles, but nothing moved. Nothing *dared*.

The serpents did not strike.Their mere presence sufficed—a force of correction older than justice, older than sin. Above her, the sky had begun to ripple, the clouds slithering across its dome like the bellies of great unseen things.

 Beneath it all, rising from the depths like a name being remembered, came the low, steady pulse of something beneath the earth.

A rumbling laugh began to rise, not from any mouth but everywhere at once. It crawled into her ears and burrowed behind her eyes. It resonated from within her *and* from the earth itself, as though the ground beneath the daisies had finally exhaled centuries of buried mirth. It was not laughter in any human sense, but the sound of delighting in the fulfillment of a long-awaited inevitability.

The serpents coiled around her wrist and ankle began to tighten. Their scales no longer felt like flesh, but like iron warmed in shadow and chilled in silence. Their bodies grew heavier with each heartbeat, anchoring her not just to the ground; binding her in ways deeper than muscle or bone. Though she had already been paralyzed, the weight of them made resistance feel *conceptually* impossible, as if the idea of freedom was being unmade inside her.

A slow, creeping cold seeped through the thin fabric at the small of her back. Whether it was sweat, blood, tears, or something altogether *other* pooling beneath her, she could not say. Her hair lay splayed behind her like seaweed beneath a black tide, soaking in whatever fluid had begun to gather there.

Then—pain.  
Sharp and precise.  
A needlepoint agony that bloomed like fire just below the coiled body of the gold-speckled serpent. Her fingers clenched of their own accord, twitching in revolt, but she could not wrench her hand away. Another lance of pain followed, deeper this time, just lower than the first; an intrusion that made her arm convulse with the warm trickle of blood, or was it something *else*?

The ichor gushed down her arm in wide tendrils, thick and viscous. It was not red, but darker. Oily. Laced with motes of iridescent shimmer, like light refracted through obsidian. It smelled faintly of copper and rot... and something sweet. Familiar. Wrong.

A third puncture.  
another tremor in the soil.

below her, the earth shuddered as if a vast eye had blinked open beneath the skin of the world. 

The laughter intensified as though forcing its way closer. Now it came from just behind the soft shell of her ears and within her lungs, as if she had inhaled the sound and could never exhale it again.

*“You promised.”*  
The voices again—both serpents in unison.  
*“And now the ritual begins.”*

The earth creaked and groaned as thorned roots punched through the softened soil, erupting like black fingers attached to spindly, skeletal palms. They clutched and grasped at every surface they could reach, pulling, prodding, claiming. The roots moved not as plants, but as limbs, guided by some vast will buried deep below. All around her, the daisy stalks twisted grotesquely, growing taller, thicker, darker; warping into towering columns of living bark that stretched endlessly into the sky. Where once there were flowers, now stood the warped semblance of a forest. The redwoods of some alien grove, titanic and suffocating. Shadows pooled between them like sentient fog.

From these shadows, the serpents came.

They slithered in droves—fat and thin, cracked and scaled, horned and smooth—each one moving with its own kind of desperate urgency. They emerged from the underbrush like memories returning from exile, writhing over one another in order to reach her, to blanket her skin, to drown her body in motion. Their colors gleamed strangely in the dimming light—iridescent greens, bruised violets, glistening umber—and all of them rushed to slick themselves the dark ichor that now poured freely from the cavity beneath her sternum.

The pain had nestled there as well, a pulsing, sharpened agony that radiated outward like fire traveling down a wick. Her blue linen gown, once soft and delicate, was now soaked through with obsidian fluid. It clung to her like mourning cloth, the color turned black as if in anticipation of her burial. The branches grew more frantic; garbled tangles of thorn and bark that clawed at her limbs, tugging with an urgency not unlike hunger. They tore at flesh and fabric alike, and still she did not move, could not move, entombed by the weight of roots, serpents, and something deeper still.

The pressure grew.

The weight across her chest built like earth collapsing inward, dense and final. Her limbs numbed. Her vision narrowed. The world was being taken from her sight, piece by piece, replaced with something darker.

The laughter came again; this time no longer inside her.

It was her.

It echoed not through air, but through bone, resonating in her marrow. In the space between heartbeats. The sound was not heard; it was felt, rippling through every cell like music played on a broken harp strung with her veins. 

In that moment her breath unfroze.

It tore from her chest in a single, violent exhale, like a soul forced back into a body not its own. It whistled through clenched teeth and bleeding lips, the release sharp and metallic, as though she had finally remembered how to scream—but had chosen not to. The wind caught the breath and carried it upward, through the warped trees, into the clouds that crawled low across the sky like the bellies of dead gods. 

The branches reached deep enough to tug on bone as ligament and muscle lay discarded aside. An all consuming burn that filled her belly and remained licking burning trails in the pooling ichor. Fuses crossed deep within her as warm light encased her mangled form.The light that flooded her broken body was not descending from above but rising from within, like breath reclaimed after an age of silence. The first crack splintered through her consciousness like shattering glass. A shriek of color, a rupture of form. The world *reeled*, as if recoiling from the realization of what lay curled at its heart. Around her, the forest groaned. The false trees bent backward as if pulled toward the sky by unseen strings. The sky itself began to bleed. Not  red, but ink-dark, the color of night without stars. 

The roots that once held her now *knelt*, withdrawing reverently, leaving behind soil that pulsed like the surface of deep water. With a sound like a thousand whispered names, her flesh unraveled. Not torn—*shed*. Pale skin sloughed away, drifting like ash in still air, revealing not muscle but something radiant and wrong beneath. Something without edges, yet burning with form. A shape the eye could not hold and the mind could not describe, stitched together with light, shadow, and intention

Cracks raced through the fabric of her reality, spiderwebbing through time and place. The trees split. The ground trembled. Somewhere far away, or perhaps impossibly near, people fell to their knees, not in worship, but in a terror they could not name.

Because the moment of awakening was not silent.

A resonance too old for language, too vast for containment. It vibrated through the architecture of existence, through the brittle glasswork of perception, and everything that had once felt real now trembled under the weight of something older than truth. Above it all, the sky bled deeper, veins of ink unraveling the fabric between the undulating clouds. It smothered the horizon, devouring color, swallowing the last shreds of shape. The air itself thickened, as though light had been nothing more than a dying breath held too long, at last, exhaled. 

*Cutting through the void like a blade through silk. The darkness shattered. fell away in streaks of color and static. The smell of soil, of rot and cosmic dust, collapsed inward, replaced by antiseptic sting. The floor beneath her was cold tile, slick with something viscous that clung to her palms when she tried to move. Her limbs were heavy, each joint aching with a dull, foreign pulse. She was lying in the center of a lab she only half remembered. The grandiose observation window cracked. The reinforced glass fractured into a spider’s web of reflections. The machines that once tethered her mind hummed weakly, lights flickering dimly overhead like a million dying suns. One of them still emitted a steady tone; the sound of a heartbeat, though she could not discern if it was hers.*

*“****Containment breach,****” a voice crackled over the intercom, distorted almost beyond recognition. “****Subject Thirteen — unresponsive. Biological anomalies detected. Evacuate sublevel five.****”*

*Trembling hands reached from unseen faces, the bright white light radiating above her blinding her of her surroundings One of them whispered,* 

*“She shouldn’t be alive.”*

“No. She isn’t.” *Another voice, closer now.*

*The light above her pulsed steady and rhythmic, yet behind its sterile glow she could almost see movement. Shapes flickering where no shapes should be, serpentine silhouettes undulating just beyond sight, sliding across the fractured glass of the observation bay. The voices continued, urgent but remote, as though spoken through a membrane of water.*

“She’s destabilizing.”  
*“No—wait, look at the cuffs—”*

*The words tangled together, dissolving into the rising wail of the alarm. Her wrists, pale and trembling, were strapped to the table. The metal was cold, biting, the pressure so tight she could feel her pulse struggling against it. And there, beneath the sharp edge of the cuff, she saw it; the faintest shimmer, gold at first, then red. A memory of scales.*

*The serpents’ coils lingered as ghostly impressions beneath her skin, their forms half-seen, as though trapped just beneath the surface of her flesh. They pulsed faintly, out of rhythm with her heartbeat— two living echoes still twined around her. Her gaze slipped to the floor. For a moment, where the sterile tile met the shadow beneath the table, the color darkened into dirt. Black, rich, breathing. It spread slowly, like oil spilled through fabric, the sterile surface of the lab floor fracturing into soft, loamy murk. And just like that the soil blinked out of existence, leaving nothing but white tile slick with viscous black fluid. The smell of antiseptic returned in a suffocating wave.* 

*“Get the restraints off.”*  
***“No.Don’t touch her.”***

*The shimmer raced upward, winding along her arms in living patterns; symbols that twisted and devoured themselves as soon as they formed.* 

“Pressure’s spiking.”  
***“Shut it down! Shut it—”***

*Metal groaned. The cuffs bent outward with the tortured wail of straining steel. Where the cold restraints touched her flesh, corrosion bloomed. Rust and verdigris eating through alloy in a heartbeat. She smelled ozone, copper, and something older; the scent of earth after a grave is disturbed. Her wrists twitched where the cuffs had been. The skin beneath them was marked not by wounds but by movement. The serpents were no longer content to slumber. She could feel them shifting just under the surface, coils brushing against muscle, scales dragging along tendons. Her fingers spasmed with each movement, a marionette of her own body.*

*For an instant she saw both worlds layered atop each other—the polished lab table and beneath it the dirt floor of that other place, breathing and wet, writhing with hardly seen movement. The table seemed to sink into it, swallowed by the weight of soil that was not really there. The serpents tightened their coils around her arms as though dragging her downward.*

*She tried to stand, but the world buckled around her. The table beneath her felt alive; vibrating faintly, the metal surface rolled with a slow, viscous rhythm. It was breathing. The realization clawed up her throat like bile. She jerked away, stumbling to the floor. The tiles were cold and slick beneath her bare feet, with each step the sensation morphed into something soft, damp, yielding before the frigid slate startled her senses again.*

*Her vision blurred. The smell of rot swelling like a until she gagged, acid rising. Her veins glowed faintly beneath the skin. gold light crawling toward her neck, her jaw, her eyes. Every pulse brought the sensation of something winding tighter around her heart.* 

*The lab was empty now.*  
*Or maybe it had always been.*

*The heartbeat monitor emitted one long, piercing tone, a neverending symphony with only one prose.*

*“You watch.”  the hissing voice bore its way down the tunnel of her ears nestling tightly in the drum.*

*“It's easier than remembering.” came the echo, completing the reverberation as the halo of sound consumed her.* 

Plunged into the darkness once more. This time, instead of silence, the air was filled with sporadic clicking, a million tiny gnashing teeth; the sound of creation chewing through its own bones. Every inch of her skin pinched and pulled tight around her lithe muscles, as though her very flesh were shrinking away from what lay beneath. She could feel herself contracting, folding inward. Tendons plucked taut like wires beneath her translucent skin. The darkness pressed in close, crowding the spaces between nerves, filling her lungs with the sound of static breath. The clacking grew louder .A staccato rhythm, inhumanly precise. Tiny, invisible feet skittered up her thighs, her ribs, the tender hollow of her throat. The sensation bloomed everywhere at once, burrowing beneath her skin, gathering behind her jaw, just under her eyes. A thousand phantom limbs working in tandem, their movements purposeful, reverent, surgical.

*The overhead light strobed violently, illuminating the contours of her body for an instant before plunging everything back into black. The muscles along her arms spasmed with the rhythm of the flicker. Each flash revealed something new; something that hadn’t been there before.*

She tried to scream again, but the sound came out wet, filled with air and phlegm, like a newborn thing learning to breathe for the first time. Her body didn’t obey her—it responded to something deeper, older. The tendons in her neck snapped taut as if strings were being pulled from above, forcing her to arch, to open, to yield.

The chattering teeth halted all at once.  
The silence that followed was worse. absolute, heavy, sentient. It seemed to press against her skull until her thoughts began to leak through the cracks. Her nervous system pulsed in golden threads beneath the surface: alive, aware, serpentine. The brachial nerves in her arms writhed faintly, coiling and uncoiling in hypnotic rhythm, like creatures tasting the air for thought. The spinal column arched with slow, reptilian grace, vertebrae clicking like vertebral scales realigning. Each impulse that fired through her neurons wasn’t electricity—it was *movement*, the slithering of entities so small, so intrinsic, that the distinction between her and them had never truly existed. 

The awareness spread through her like an infection. Every nerve ending bloomed into sentience; tiny, writhing threads of consciousness brushing against her perception. She could feel the serpents’ patience in the quiet spaces between synapses. Every signal she sent, every twitch of her fingers, every fragment of memory. Her breath caught midway, split into two distinct sensations: one physical, one psychic. The sound she made was impossible, a hiss layered over a sob, as though two voices had been pressed into the same mouth and forced to share it. Veins turning into rivers. Nerves unfurling into highways of light. The brain itself curling like a nest of serpents, each thought a ripple of scales. Every flicker of memory slithered past her, shedding its skin, leaving behind hollow echoes of who she thought she was. Her name became a sound she couldn’t pronounce. Her body became a landscape she only vaguely recognized. 

The field of daisies and the beating heart below. 

The blooming space in the cracks of her nervous system flourished into the once familiar scene, roots threading through the corridors of her mind, splitting apart the delicate latticework of thought. Synapses unfurled like vines searching for light that no longer existed. The gurgling water rose from behind her eyes, heavy and cold, fracturing her flesh in a complex patchwork of reflection and ruin.

Her lungs dragged in a sharp breath. It filled her, but unevenly, spilling through fissures that hadn’t been there before. 

Her heart hiccuped within the dark cavity of her chest, stuttering against itself as though uncertain whether it belonged to flesh or to earth.

The air shuddered and the space around her convulsed. Inky blackness bowed away like the lids of a colossal eye forced open after centuries of dreamless sleep. Light poured through. The sky above her bled the color of fresh bruises spreading beneath translucent skin. It dripped in slow threads down the horizon, pooling into the earth until the daisies drank greedily of it, their white petals blushing with veins of crimson. The wind that moved through them was heavy and wet, carrying the stench of copper and soil, of something newly born or recently dead. And she laughed.  
Each stem, each trembling petal, rooted in the trembling web of her own nerves. The boundaries between mind and matter had dissolved entirely. The ground breathed with her, in ragged synchrony—the slow inhalation of the world through borrowed lungs. Her veins mirrored in the soil; golden threads coiling and uncoiling beneath the surface, alive, writhing. They pulsed faintly, echoes of the serpents, their shapes flickering beneath her skin and beneath the ground alike, until there was no telling where one ended and the other began.

overhead, the bleeding sky quivered as though something immense was stirring just beyond its membrane—something that had always been there, watching through the cracks in her perception.

*Her wrists were bound to her shoulders, holding her chest in a faux hug. Her chest rose in shallow, fluttering motions, the rhythm erratic, birdlike. Each breath caught and snagged as though the air itself resisted being drawn into her. Her hair hung in thick, matted curtains, the only partition between her and the walls. The room had no corners, no edges; it seemed to curve inward, as though the space were inhaling her, folding her into itself. Every surface gleamed with antiseptic purity, but the smell betrayed the illusion. Beneath the sterile veneer, something fermented. Sweet. Metallic. Alive.*

*The obsidian fluid seeped freely from every orifice, crawling sluggishly down her chin and neck before pooling in the hollow of her collarbone. It clung to her teeth, painting them in streaks of black like charcoal. When she breathed, the fluid trembled, forming delicate ripples across her skin before dripping to the floor in viscous strands that refused to break.*

*There on the floor, standing upright. impossibly clean against the white floor, as though it had grown from the very stain her body had left behind. A stark red daisy. Its petals were arranged with mechanical precision: perfect, symmetrical, untouched by decay. But at its center, consuming the intricate layers of seeds, was a perfectly round void: black, depthless, absorbing all light.* ",2,1760657926.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

Before joining the Hispana rebellion to activate of the Bridge to Altaerrie, there were nearly sixty thousand children of Tekali, with about ten thousand travelers monthly. Since the war began (Six AST months or four Earth Zulu months) and excluding the Altaerrie presence, the remaining occupation of Salva is about fifty-seven thousand, with five hundred travelers. With coordination with Colonel Hackett, there is an approximation of eleven thousand USAM personnel, mostly coming from the American 1st Brigade, 4th ID, and the two Ranger Battalions, but all this includes support warriors.*

*Before the war, the city only needed a hundred Militia to maintain stability. Excluding the emergency drafting of all body males during the First Siege of Salva, there were not three thousand Militia serving under the Minutemen's command.*

*The City-State of Salve, a once major trading and religious city before the days of the Daru'uie Confederacy that once housed over a hundred thousand souls, is now a shadow of its former self. Over the centuries, the city slowly degraded against the dominant competition and the rise of the Toriffa-Affrooliea alliance. Unable to forge a counterbalance, their influence faded throughout time. A once-thriving people resorted to a backwater, aging like the abandoned Indolass Temple.*

*However, a sense of brightness fills Salva's air. Despite constant bombardment from their former masters—the Verliance Aristocracy—the Altaerrie are there. New blood, technology, and courage bring new life to the city. Buildings that have not been occupied in generations have found new purpose. While times are dark, food is scarce, and at any moment, the enemy of Tekali could storm the city, most are hopeful that a new golden age has arrived."" - Oracle*

\*\*\*\*\*



Walking along the street, the Princess of Salva observed hundreds of commoners conducting their daily business. They navigated peacefully to their destinations, conversing with fellow citizens or Altaerrie defenders. The city bore scars from relentless attacks, with damage control and security teams active after the recent bombardment, yet a positive mood hung in the air.

With a lull in the assaults, Colonel Hackett deemed it vital for American and Salva leadership to appear publicly, showcasing solidarity and bolstering morale. The Princess welcomed this; she had no fondness for being confined indoors. Six years spent within Kallem’s palaces and fortresses, glimpsing the world only through paintings, had left her craving open skies.

“It is nice to see people happy again,” the voice said.

“I’m surprised they’re not panicking,” Assiaya thought. “The war rages just beyond the walls, yet they act as if nothing is wrong.”

“People cannot stay scared forever.”

“True…,” Assiaya thought. “But I’m still scared.”

She gazed at the partly cloudy sky. It was midday, with Tekali looming high above. But a new sight marred her view of the blue and purple gas giant: giant missiles launched from American artillery streaked toward the enemy’s rear, targeting outposts and supply lines.

“What’s wrong, kid?”

The Princess turned to see Colonel William Hackett, accompanied by his staff, Captain Loria Smith, and Captain James Howard, whom she recognized from the Palace Headquarters. They had joined her daily walk but spent most of their time discussing the war. Their collective stare made her nervous.

“Um…,” Assiaya murmured. “I was wondering when Father will come home.”

“I see,” Hackett replied. “I can’t say—it’s classified—but I promise it won’t be forever.”

“It’s been a week,” Assiaya said, measuring time in Alagore Standard. Memories flickered of their days in the forest, playing shadows in the cave, sitting on the balcony at Vagahm.

“I understand,” Hackett said softly. “Duty calls soldiers to war to defeat our enemies. It’s hard, unfair, and it hurts—but that pain shows you love someone. It’s a sad truth, but when you reunite, cherish those moments—they’ll be precious.”

The Princess looked down, reflecting on his words. The thought of losing her new Father chilled her, each day deepening her dread. Having already lost one family, she couldn’t fathom enduring it again.

She glanced at the officers. “What if he dies?”

Hackett exchanged a look with his staff before facing her with a wry smile. “Impossible. I didn’t permit it,” he said, trying to lighten the mood.

Realizing worry wasn’t helping, Assiaya resolved to appear composed for the American supply convoy and the townsfolk. In Kallem’s Slave, she had learned that public perception was everything for a ruler. She took her hanky, wiped her eyes, and, with her composure restored, continued down the street.

As she passed her subjects, many showed respect—bowing, waving, or offering other gestures. The attention still unsettled her. As a slave, she had been deemed lesser; now, her world was inverted. She returned each gesture with a warm “thank you,” whether to Salva natives or Altaerrie.

The Americans were different. Lacking a royal culture, their respect often felt forced, driven by Colonel Hackett’s standing order rather than sincerity. This didn’t bother the Slave Princess; she could sense their obligation. Yet, some Americans saluted her, occasionally acknowledging her royal title. With every flower, thank you, and speech, more soldiers showed her respect as she walked Salva’s streets.

“It’s nice to see your subjects respect you,” the voice said.

“My subjects,” Assiaya mumbled. “Should I call them that? It feels wrong.”

“Kallem did,” the voice replied. “Our former Father did. Even the Vagahm Lord did.”

“I know. But our new Father doesn’t, and the other Altaerrie avoid such terms.”

“Not true. That Ambassador woman does. She acts like royalty, but the rotten kind.”

“True… I hate that woman so much.”

“What are you talking about?”

Startled, Assiaya realized she had spoken aloud. She turned to see the Minutemen officers staring at her, puzzled.

“I… was wondering if I should call people subjects,” she said.

“If I recall,” Smith replied, “that’s normal in a feudal society. Or am I mistaken?”

“I… guess so,” Assiaya said. “Yes, it’s normal.”

“I have a bigger question,” Hackett said. “Why are you asking?”

“I don’t know,” Assiaya admitted. “I was thinking I don’t want people to fear me like they do Kallem.”

“I understand,” Hackett said. “It’s okay if people fear you a little—that’s how you maintain order and respect. But it’s also good, even preferable, for the government to fear its people, in principle.”

The idea stunned the Princess. A government fearing its people was unthinkable. She recalled Kallem’s obsession with public perception, balancing groups to maintain aristocratic allegiance. “Why?”

“It’s about respect,” Hackett explained. “A ruler can have a soft heart, but you mustn’t appear weak to citizens or enemies. Fear doesn’t always mean oppression; without consequences, society unravels. As for your question, it’s your choice: are they subjects who serve you, or are you duty-bound to serve them?”

“Father was right,” the voice said. “Everything Uncle Hackett says is complex.”

“‘Yeah…,’ Assiaya mumbled. ‘You said “citizens.” What do you mean?’”

“It’s a modern term for subjects, loosely speaking,” Hackett said. “Nations valuing nationalism often unite under one culture and ideology, regardless of creed, religion, tribe, or race—everyone under a single banner. Citizens feel connected to the state, unlike an empire, which segregates cultures or ethnicities under a central authority, rendering ‘citizen’ meaningless.”

“That’s an oversimplification,” Smith interjected.

“Which is right, then?” Assiaya asked.

“It depends on who you ask and why,” Hackett replied. “Empires have dominated history, but as Americans, we’re nationalistic. Race doesn’t matter; national principles trump ethnic or regional ones. That’s our heritage. But whichever model you choose, balance is key—too far or not far enough, and it fails.”

“Again, oversimplified,” Smith said. “There’ll be time to learn this, but it’s not your concern now. First, we must reclaim the region.”

The concept jolted Assiaya, sparking questions about governance and her future as a ruler. She hadn’t imagined leading a country in different ways. Her former master’s constant politicking now made sense.

Seeing the Colonel signal to move on, she turned, pondering the ruler she wanted to be. If the Americans broke the Aristocracy’s blockade, she would one day govern multiple cities and villages.



\*\*\*\*\*



Colonel Hackett watched the Princess navigate the street, greeting everyone with genuine effort. The dual-eyed girl thanked and showed consideration to her subjects, making it no mere chore.

“It’s kind of cute,” Smith said. “I’ve never seen someone try so hard at her age.”

Hackett nodded, considering Smith’s observation. He suspected Assiaya was battling self-doubt, much like Mathew Ryder. Six years of confinement likely fueled that struggle. If he had to pinpoint one motive, Hackett believed she was striving to be the opposite of her former master, Kallem Verliance—a trait that could be both positive and perilous.

He was pleased she asked questions but cautious about giving direct answers, hoping she’d develop ideals aligned with Ryder’s vision organically. He worried she might reject Kallem’s ways out of spite, adopting opposing ideas impulsively. For now, he’d guide her mindset to reflect Ryder’s approval, not merely negate her former master.

“Maybe a little too hard,” Hackett said. “But for now, it’s harmless.”

“Sir,” Howard said, “if we’re to meet the supply convoy, we should hurry.”

The Colonel glanced at his intelligence officer, who was scribbling on his tablet, sifting through battle reports.

“It’s not that urgent,” Hackett replied.

“We’re only out here because of her,” Howard said.

“She does this daily,” Smith countered. “Or do you miss her not serving you coffee?”

“Not the point,” Howard said. “We could be working efficiently at HQ, not wandering.”

“We’re not wandering,” Hackett said. “The townsfolk need to see their leaders among them, not isolated.”

“Isn’t that Captain Ryder’s role?” Howard asked. “And the kid? Why us?”

“Ryder’s busy bombing the enemy,” Hackett said. “She wants to be out here, and as city military commander, I need to show presence.”

“Then shouldn’t the Ambassador be here?” Howard pressed.

Hackett sighed. “One war at a time.”

“Besides,” Smith said, “we’re winning hearts and minds.”

“Exactly,” Hackett said. “If we do this right, it’ll be a model moving forward. Now, speaking of bombs—how are our Combat Teams faring?”

“Captain Ryder—or rather, Duke Ryder’s alliance with a Farian town has been successful,” Howard reported. “Major Stone had no issues establishing a temporary outpost. Fifteen teams are operating from there.”

The Farian town was a critical staging ground for deep strikes against Aristocracy and Unity rear bases and supply lines, eliminating the need to return to Salva for resupply. Hackett had sent his second-in-command to lead the operation, underscoring its importance in breaking the siege.

“That’ll get noticed,” Smith said.

“Major said the same,” Howard replied. “B Squadron is setting up now. Two teams are contacting other villages as we speak.”

“Good,” Hackett said. “Recall A Squadron after their current missions. Keep the two in rotation for consistent disruption.”

The Colonel agreed with his personnel officer. The U.S. military traditionally dominated conventional foes, maintaining global dominance for over 150 years, even among Earth’s Great Powers. Yet asymmetric warfare—winning local loyalty—remained a challenge. Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan, and even Central America’s cartel wars showed mixed results.

The American tendency to treat every problem as a nail for their hammer often blinded them to alternative solutions.

As they moved through the city, Hackett watched the Princess greet passersby. She paused to speak with two shop owners—a Yalate and a Kitsune—about their bare shelves. Then, an unfamiliar noise caught her attention.

The dual-eyed girl clutched her dress and hurried toward a market building, stopping at a metal cage fence. The three-story structure housed residents on the upper floors, with a shop and a small courtyard on the first, sheltered by the second floor and supported by four stone-and-wood pillars.

Assiaya and other townsfolk gathered around the fence enclosing the courtyard, where a dozen chickens pecked at the ground.

The crowd marveled at the alien, flightless birds, many wondering their purpose. The Princess explained they produced “infinite eggs.”

Colonel Hackett chuckled, especially when a small Neko reached through the fence, only to be pecked by a rooster. Importing these animals was a modest investment to ease the food crisis, but he hadn’t anticipated the morale boost.

A cage guard warned the Neko to stop. Since these farms appeared, shop owners had hired security to protect their valuable assets.

Hackett understood some guards were former Adventurers, this world’s private law enforcement. Salva’s small guild, where the Council or individuals posted quests, had closed since the war began. He considered reopening it once the siege lifted, as locals were already taking security into their own hands.

Seeing the Princess busy explaining the chickens’ importance to Salva’s future, Hackett checked his tablet, which listed active Combat Teams, including allies. Two Minutemen Squadrons, alongside British and Japanese teams, were deployed.

He flipped to Razorfist’s POV. The Minutemen team was tasked with destroying an ammunition depot. Other teams had taken out an Aristocracy radar base, but this mission faced a new detection system—a “scope,” an orb-antikythera magitech using electromagnetic waves to track targets visually. Unfamiliar with its capabilities, Hackett prioritized its destruction.

Razorfist’s live feed lagged due to poor connections. Coordinating with two B Squadron teams, they opened fire, surrounding the enemy and enabling Mācuahuitl to demolish the structure.

Ghost, alongside a Japanese team, called in a Tonbokiri cruise missile to destroy a cargo airship, requiring three missiles and causing secondary damage.

Major Stone deployed Comanche and Horatius to neutralize walker artillery bombarding the city. American radar tracking pinpointed artillery origins, but the enemy’s superior mobility allowed them to relocate before counter-barrages.

The campaign against the enemy’s rear had stalled their assaults on Salva’s walls, frustrating the White House. With resources pouring into this secret war, maintaining secrecy was increasingly untenable. The Bridge’s discovery had raised questions about its long-term presence on Alagore. The President, wary of public revolt over an alien war without clear victory, demanded a triumph to justify the announcement.

Hackett understood the White House’s logic, but the reality on the ground didn’t match. The month-long siege hadn’t starved Unity, though he hoped his raids would demoralize them and thin their blockade.

City alarms blared, signaling an attack. Hackett scooped up Assiaya and rushed into a nearby shop, followed by his staff and civilians. Smith and Howard directed everyone to the floor as he knelt by a wooden pillar, setting the Princess down. She adjusted her dress, thanked him, and peered out the window as the building shook.

“This is why your Father hasn’t returned,” Hackett said. “These attacks must stop.”

“I know,” Assiaya whispered. “I feel so helpless.”

“I understand,” Hackett said. “When I was your Father’s age…”

The blue-and-gold-eyed Princess sat on the floor, waiting for the alarms to cease. Some grumbled or cried, but most waited calmly for the enemy volley to end. The shop owner, a male Kitsune, beheaded a chicken and plucked its feathers, unfazed by the attack.

The building shook as enemy shells struck, slipping through the remnants of the American layered defense. The Aristocracy’s recent assault on the Fort had destroyed many Tawa and Bolas batteries.

“They’re getting desperate,” Smith said. “Third volley today.”

“They’re not focusing on the rear anymore,” Hackett noted. “They must be close to breaking.”

“I’m not sure,” Howard said. “Our teams found massive supply stockpiles—too many for a siege.”

“You’re expecting an attack?” Hackett asked, reaching the same conclusion.

Then, he heard Captain Smith humming a familiar tune beside the Princess. At first, he ignored it, but his gut prompted him to ask. “Smith, what are you humming?”

The Captain shifted. “Sorry, sir. I got in the mood.”

“That’s fine. What’s the song?”

“I was humming *The Star-Spangled Banner*,” she said. “I don’t know why. I was picturing the shroud explosions.”

Hackett kicked himself for not recognizing the national anthem, written during the War of 1812 after the British burned Washington, D.C. During the siege of Fort McHenry, the defenders withstood cannon and rocket barrages, their oversized flag flying defiantly by dawn, prompting the enemy’s retreat.

As the building shook, Hackett approached the cracked window and stared at the city.

“Sir?” Howard said.

Hackett ignored him, focusing on the Princess. “Princess, I have a job for you.”

\*\*\*\*\*



Mathew Ryder peered over the rocky surface toward the meadow ahead, using the terrain as cover. Greenery and moss covered the area, but his focus was elsewhere.

Below, Charlie Higgins operated his radio while Benjamin Ford and Ovidius Vestalis monitored a laptop. Natilite scanned through her M77 optics, and Kurt Forest used a digital range finder feeding data to the computer. Flavius Antius and the rest of Comanche and Horatius secured the perimeter.

“I thought Phantom-1 said they were coming this way?” Ryder asked.

“They did,” Higgins confirmed.

Before Ryder could respond, Natilite signaled him. “Matt, I see movement.”

“I can confirm,” Forest added.

Ryder turned and saw half a dozen enemy troops emerge from the brush, followed by a four-legged walker with a long accelerator on its back. A second walker appeared, its spider-like legs gliding over obstacles.

With Salva’s defenses holding against direct assaults, the enemy had shifted to long-range bombardment. Walkers, unrestricted by roads, climbed hills for better firing positions, prompting the Minutemen to prioritize their destruction.

“There’s the suckers,” Ryder muttered.

“Boss,” Forest said, “those turrets don’t look like any circiletum I’ve seen.”

“They’re rallustum variants,” Natilite clarified.

Unfamiliar with the term, Ryder accessed his Itlian battlesuit’s Oracle database, which translated “rallustum” as “railgun”—a linear motor device using electromagnetic force, unlike the coil-based circiletum.

“What are they used for?” Ryder asked.

“Mainly artillery,” Natilite said. “Rallustums double as rocket launchers due to fewer components and stronger kinetic force.”

“But they’re energy-inefficient,” Antius added. “We rely on circiletums as standard.”

“Thanks for the intel,” Ryder said. “Bruno, prep the Atlatl.”

“Hold on,” Antius interrupted, pointing to the brush. “There’s an amplifier walker.”

Ryder checked Forest’s range finder, spotting a giant orb and a leg protruding from the foliage. The amplifier’s presence ruined their ambush plan; it could deploy a mana shield or electrical strike to counter the Atlatl.

“Good eyes,” Ryder said.

“You rely too much on tech,” Antius replied. “I’ve fought Unity for years. You learn or die.”

“Here’s hoping we live to learn,” Ryder said. “Now what? We need to neutralize the amplifier.”

“The orb’s vulnerable,” Vestalis said.

“A .50-cal shot could do it,” Forest suggested. “Boss, permission to grab the M66?”

Rommel King, below the mount, shook his head. “By the time Kurt reaches our vehicles, the walkers will redeploy.”

King was right. The sniper rifle wasn’t an option. “Forget it,” Ryder said. “Antius, can Horatius take out the amplifier?”

“Derion has a rallustum,” Antius said. “Get us close, and that walker’s done.”

“Do it,” Ryder ordered. “Bruno stays to prep the Atlatl. We’ll cover you when it gets hot.”

The leaders agreed. Horatius moved north, circling the meadow, while Comanche—minus Forest and Barrios—advanced. The terrain aided their stealth until they reached the meadow’s edge, where a slope offered cover but no foliage. They crawled to avoid detection.

The soft, stream-fed ground slowed them, but Comanche reached the slope safely.

“Water on wings…,” Natilite muttered. “Not a good combination.”

“You could’ve stayed back,” Gonzales teased.

“And who’d kiss your wounds when you get shot?” Natilite shot back.

“Enough,” King snapped.

Ryder directed his team to fan out for cover and prepare to engage. Natilite, beside him, felt the ground. “Matt, maybe Fraeya could redirect the water into a wall if we need to retreat?”

“Can you do that?” Ryder asked.

“A strong hydromancy mage can,” Fraeya said, crawling for a better view. “There’s enough water to freeze the ground.”

Ryder caught her meaning. Freezing the wet grass could slow the enemy, aiding their escape. “Do it,” he ordered. “Don’t overdo it. Everyone else, when Horatius opens fire, light them up.”

Fraeya cast her spell cautiously to avoid detection. Tension mounted as the team waited near the enemy. The rallustum walkers raised their cannons toward Salva, their battery packs glowing as they charged. A loud crack echoed as projectiles launched.

Weapons fire erupted across the meadow. Unity defenders scrambled toward the skirmish.

“Horatius has been made,” King said.

“Dammit,” Ryder snapped. “Comanche, light it up!”

The Minutemen emerged, catching the Unity soldiers off guard. Wallace’s light machine gun roared in bursts, forcing survivors to cover. Natilite picked off officers with her DMR, while Ford launched a grenade from his M31.

The enemy regrouped, with circiletum-armed soldiers providing cover fire and shield-bearing troops charging.

King slid beside Fraeya. “Forget caution. Go hard.”

The ice spread swiftly as Fraeya focused her mana. “I can fire ice shrouds.”

“Wait for my order,” King said.

The charging Unity soldiers hit the ice, one slipping, another stumbling. The rest halted, realizing the trap.

“Now!” King shouted.

Ice shrouds shot from the ground. One shattered against an energy shield, another killed a soldier. The surprise stalled the charge, letting Comanche unleash a hail of 6.8mm rounds on the slowed enemy.

The amplifier walker glowed, projecting a shield over the other walkers. A projectile from nearby brush struck the orb, triggering a colorful explosion.

“What was that?” Natilite asked, shielding her eyes.

“Horatius,” King said.

The shield collapsed. Unity soldiers retreated, sensing the shift. An Atlatl missile from Barrios’s position streaked toward the nearest walker, exploding on impact.

The second walker scrambled toward the tree line, but a second Atlatl hit its top, causing a massive secondary explosion. Its wreckage collapsed, legs splayed.

Comanche erupted in cheers. Ford thrust his fist skyward. “Run, you utopian bastards!”

Fraeya and the team chuckled at Ford’s outburst, but Barret silenced them, maintaining combat focus.

“Nice to see them burn for once,” Natilite said.

“Celebrate later,” King said, pointing to approaching enemy infantry. “Two Files incoming.”

“They must be pissed,” Wallace said.

“Mission accomplished,” Ryder said. “Comanche, fall back.”

1o8ltnc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o8ltnc,Dear Batana oil 🥲,"Hi y'all.

I have succumbed to the trend. This trend is pricey, though 😂 $124 CAD for 1kg, and $16.75 CAD for 100g... 🥺


That is one of the most pricey natural raw products I have ever bought, along with lilac absolute, sandalwood essential oil, champaca absolute, and 30% bakuchiol oil.


I never saw anything amazing with any oil or any treatment regarding ""hair growth."" But I wanted a light oil that had those supposed properties, so this is it.



Anyways, I buy most of my stuff from Botanic Planet Canada Inc. (a Canadian store), and they sell great quality products. For this particular oil, they also provided a **Certificate of Analysis** proving that it is what they are selling (here: https://botanicplanet.ca/image/pdffile/BatanaoilrawMSDSCOA.pdf).


That being said, this **unrefined Batana oil (Elaeis Oleifera) from Honduras** is really solid (at 22°C room temp) and melts so fast when you scrape it with your finger. And you can put a lot on, and your hair is not weighed down. It is absorbed really fast; it is really lightweight. So, it absorbs as fast as coconut oil without having that sometimes dry effect. I did apply the oil on my damp hair, though. The feeling could be different on dry hair. It will last a long time, since a little bit gives enough to cover all the hair and the scalp.


It smells like caramel cooked coffee, mixed with a musty smell, that over time somewhat reminded me of tobacco or old cigarette smell ☕️🪔🚬🫘.


So, maybe in 6 months or 1 year, if I am truly consistent with it, I will put a before ans after picture.
So, this is why I did this post.

If you have had experience with real Batana oil, feel free to share your thoughts on it.

I forgot to put the picture of my hair/scalp for proof, in the future.

So, you have a picture that show that you can see my scalp.
You also have the quantity of hair I loose every 4 days or so after detangling my hair.

I use to need 3½ bottles of commecial hair dye to color my hair. Now, less than 1 bottle is enough. FIY: I do not dye my hair anymore, just with pure henna.

But still, I am not really loosing my hair at an alarming state, according to my MD. Because my hair is curly, it seems fine, but it is not.

I am arriving to Lisbon in a few days and I'll be there for a few months. Since I also plan to at the very least visit Porto as well I’d love to get some recommendations for local cuisine and non-tourist trap restaurants as well as hangout customs. I’m Greek and a pretty hearty eater plus a great cook at so food is my number 1 everyday thought.

I love food that’s rich, filling, and full of flavor. 

1) For breakfast, I usually go for a nice cup of espresso ☕ and a pastry 🥐 (sweet or savory, depending on the day) so I especially want help with spot/dish recommendations regarding breakfast. Being from the coffee capital of Greece and an ex-barista and ex-baker I am not only a coffee and pastry addict but especially regarding coffee I can be kinda nitpicky about the details. I am however always open to expand my horizons; I especially can't wait to try out mazagran! No brunch please, it's overrated 🙏🏻 


2) But what I’m really after are big, satisfying lunches — I’m talking Mediterranean-style meals with plenty of meat 🍖, good sauces, fresh veggies vegetables 🥬(tomatoes, onions, peppers), and of course, cheese 🧀 and potatoes 🥔 whenever applicable. Bonus points if the dishes have spice 🌶️ and plenty of herbs — I can handle (and love) heat. I also enjoy seafood to a lesser degree but I am not a huge fan, I mostly prefer grilled fish 🐟 and other seafood 🦞 like calamari but I usually prefer that in the summer. Again, spots and dishes are always welcome and meat is a must!


3) On top of that I want to know your versions of fast food. While my usual dinner is eggs in various variations, I have an adoration for our dear gyros 🌯 so any similar wraps and rich sandwiches will be perfect for lazy dinners. Bonus points for any ""hungover spots"" aka small local places that stay up later to cater to people ending their booze filled night adventures. These back home are some of my favorite, and I've already been informed of some solid Bifana places.


4) Snacks 🥨 are also always important. I usually just eat nuts and fruit in between meals but you never know, maybe there is some hidden treasure.


5) While not exactly a food related question I was curious if there are hangout customs unique to Portugal. For example in Greece we have something called wine places 🍷, bars (for lack of a better term) that sell very cheap and very bad wine and usually only have wine and maybe one or two other sides on the menu. You basically just go there to smoke and get plastered for cheap plus the hungover from wine is always more mellow. I was wondering if you have something similar or in general any other uniquely Portuguese hanging out ways. 


If you know of any hidden gems, local tascas, or family-run spots that fit the bill or must try recipes/dishes that you believe fit the description, I’d love to hear them!

(If you’re on the fence about keeping your favorite places secret, feel free to DM me — I totally get not wanting to blow up your go-to place online! I can keep a secret 😉)

Thanks a lot, and looking forward to eating my way through Portugal! Tchau, tchau! 🇵🇹💕",0,1760657523.0,PortugalExpats,1,0.17,False

I've been on 40mg Pantoprazole for 6 weeks with no help so doc put me on low dose of  Nortriptyline..started at 10mg and currently at 20mg at night.

After being on these for 6 weeks, my silent reflux is starting to get better. However, Nortriptyline makes me a zombie during the day. I'm a runner and have started skipping my morning runs as I simply cannot get out of bed. Even after getting 8+ hours of sleep, I'm chugging black coffee all day just so I can do work. 

I asked my GI doc for alternative med but he said there's nothing else and if Nortriptyline is working for me, I should just stick to it. 

Anyone else here has tried Nortriptyline? Did the grogginess go away over time or it's just something that I have to deal with on a daily basis?

I don't know how it started, my sleep schedule was fairly normal I would say, I slept at 12-1am normally after winding up with my college work. But last week has been especially stressful because of upcoming diwali vacations.

I wanted to clear off all the submissions and reports before vacations so I could actually enjoy the holidays, so I pull a all nighter on last Friday, could not complete the work in that session, so I slept late the next day too. But after that little episode, I struggle to sledp properly ever since. I don't take any coffee or any type of substance to keep me awake. I exercise enough for my body to get exhausted at the end of the day. And I recently started with breathing exercises to help this insomnia problem, but, so far, it ain't working. 

I'd like to ask for some suggestions to resolve this, this whole week has been a very bad one, I sleep at sunrise and fail to wake up until it's lunch time, resulting in missed lectures, alarms don't work. I'm not very sure how to tackle this.

1o8lo62,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o8lo62,My Experience With Paradyes,"Suddenly felt like I am living life in a loop and needed a change, so I decided to dye my hair at 2 am. I used Paradyes Semi-Permanent Crème Color in the Coffee Brown shade. I am well aware that semi-permanent dyes show up best on bleached hair, but since I didn’t want anything too dramatic or drastic (for now), I used it on my virgin black hair. I knew this kind of dye (especially the shade I chose) would be barely visible on unbleached black hair but because I wanted something subtle and close to my natural color so I still went for it.

BAD CHOICE.

While washing my hair to get rid of the color, I noticed it was breaking a lot more than usual. I thought, “No big deal, maybe this is normal when you dye your hair.” But after washing and letting it dry, I ran my fingers through it and oh god, hair fell out in clumps.

The picture I attached shows the hair that fell out after it dried. That’s not even one-fourth of what fell out in the shower. I am 17 and never experienced THIS kind of hairfall before so I am concerned.

And yes, the color didn’t show up.

But that’s not even my concern. I knew that could happen so I am not surprised or complaining about it.

It’s the hair fall and damage their product caused.

As I’m writing this, my hair is still a little damp and I am honestly worried about how severe the damage might be. Any tips or suggestions on how I can take care of my hair now?

I was planning to bleach my hair and dye it some shade of brown or red (burgundy, cherry red, or something else) in February. Any recommendations for better hair dye brands?

I rase and eyebrow but he doesn't continue. We sit and thought the powers that join my pack together that join our collective together we speak
(Oris: is this going to be another job we get jiped on? I'd hate to waste more time here.)
(Fang: We could force him to pay us wores come to) 
(Skull: relax the jobs from the coin house should pay half upfront even if we get jiped will have more that enough coin for a time) As we sit outwardly in silence Wallace hears nothing why would he? We talk in our own heads. That is when a a man? Walks in he is thin graceful he is wearing red and purple but not any clothes from Osirion his coat holds a fine quality to it with repeating intricate patterns that fold in on themselves. He wears many layers that flow as he moves. At his side is a straight blade with a octagon guard and handle of multiple colors. but the stranges thing about him is his head his hair tied in a bun above his head and on his face, a fox mask white clean with red accents and smileing like it know a secret. His voice comes out sickly sweet almost mocking, 

? Is this the right room? Oh I sure dont hope I'm lost.
Wallace: are you here for the reporting job? 
? Why yes, yes I am. Might I say this is a wonderful place you have here it's even clean. I am Jiyuna it is such a pleasure to meet you. 

I wrack my mind looking for the culture and original of this man and it takes me a moment until I remember the men I met in Osa the people of Xia I know little of the place many know nothing, isolated and gaurded by one of the largest and harshest seas of the world. He travels very far that is for sure.
 
The second of the three enters he is light skin not of osirion most likely from across the inner sea his head is shaven his eyes are blueish gold and his is sullen angluar with heavy stubble,and he wears a full body brown robe with heavy satchel at his side. But there is something about him I cannot place a lightness to person and a weight.

? Hello I am Kam he says before lighting a cigarette. Definitely not osiriny most orsirions turn there nose up at cigarettes thinking they are cheap garbage, the hooka and the pipe are more refined. Then I noticed the tips of tattoos that mark the body of his neck it seems like he has many 

The last to join us is another human short with milk coffee skin yellow eyes and braided hair. She wears a large thick blue hat with she wears a blue robe with a yellow sash that bears a simple I recognize as the from the college city's of Nex and at her side a massive tome it must weigh 30 pounds. 
 
Umm hello I'm Mika. 

Her eyes turn to me and my pack she looks at Fang with what I recognize quickly as distrust a hint of fear maybe hate? Just what the job needed I think, as the man who has brought us together leans forward. And speaks 

Wallace: good now that you are all here the city of Reshet has stopped paying taxes and Im want you all to go and find out why?  

Kam: why not send the army or the guard? 

Wallace: Because it's nothing major just a city in the middle of nowhere that I need to be a trade stop. 

Skull then why send anyone at all? 

Wallace: because it's my ass if they stop paying so go and do it 1000g upfront the second when the job is done. . . Each

We the group of strangers look at each other and ask ourselfs why does feel like this job is going to be a problem.

College grad, fluent in English, Sarcasm, and the occasional bad pun. Big fan of Suits (because nothing says “thrilling drama” like corporate loopholes) and HGTV. In the kitchen, I cook, bake, and argue with my oven over who’s the real master chef.

I don’t drink or do drugs. Unless you count caffeine, then yes, I’m basically a bean addict. My nightlife is less “clubbing till 2am” and more “building a pillow fort empire and bingeing Netflix until the cliffhanger leaves me emotionally bankrupt.” Basically, I’m a homebody with a 5-star rating on Yelp for snacks.

Also worth mentioning, I lean conservative. Not here to debate politics, just putting it out there in case that’s a dealbreaker. Better to find that out before we bond over banana bread and binge-watching.

About You

You’re in your 30s, educated, and steady in your career. Bonus points if you can use “there,” “their,” and “they’re” correctly without breaking a sweat. You can hold a conversation that’s more than just “hey” (plot twist: you’re actually interesting). You’re the type to send random memes that perfectly capture the chaos of life because sometimes a well-timed GIF says more than a whole paragraph.

You don’t smoke, do drugs, drink heavily, have tattoos, piercings, or kids. I like my drama like my Netflix, available on demand, not in real life. If you’re thoughtful, communicative, and the type who remembers the small things (like my coffee order or which side of the blanket I hog), we’ll get along just fine.

One Ask

Please share a recent photo (fully clothed, unless you’re auditioning for a Tide commercial). I’ll do the same. Just making sure you’ve got pepper, or salt and pepper, and not just straight salt. After all, life’s too bland without seasoning.",3,1760656608.0,r4r,1,0.64,False

We are mostly black coffee and white coffee drinkers, so the milk carafe is a must have. I drink mostly Latte (love the Cadorna AusLatte option of putting in the coffee then the milk). Wife likes mostly hot black coffees, like a large black style. Budget wise, probably somewhere between 2 and 2.5k AUD. If by some miracle there was a machine that could make a Frappe, awesome, but I dont want to pay a million dollars to get it.

We're not coffee connoisseurs, so wont spend hours tweaking the settings on a coffee machine. For me, as strong as the machine will make it, and as hot as you can make it.... great. We've looked a some of the latest Delonghi and Jura... but some of the prices of the Jura are way more than the functionality we need.

Size wise... we have a limited size corner of of the kitchen bench, so we need a machine that is roughly the size of the Cadorna, which is approx 430mm deep, 380mm high, 260mm wide. Depth is the biggest challenge and but we can maneuver to some degree on height and width.

Open to the knowledgeable folk in here giving us suggestions... or do we just look at the latest Gaggia models?

Hiii my fellow sweet potatoes! 
Haayyy Charlotte! Love the channel, you're an icon! 

I wanted to share with y'all my most satisfying petty revenge story from back when I was a hairdresser. It's petty because I enjoyed it so much, really, but the actual revenge was served by Karma itself! 
Now I am gonna have to give a lot of context so this one *will* be long. But I also know that Charlotte loves that so we're good! 

I (23 at the time) was working at a salon in a big city.
It was the very first salon I ever worked at and I was freshly out of hairdressing school. The salon in question had been open for nearly two decades and the owner - let's call her Dracula, shall we? - was a *Piece. Of. Work* 
Always talking about herself, thinks she's the best hairdresser around, pretended to be the ""chill"" boss but was actually Cruella de Vil, saunters in to the salon at noon when it's been open since 8:30am, tells the *ExAcT* same drama laden stories to Every. Single. One of her clients in the Exact. Same. Way. All. Day. Long. While the rest of us try to do our jobs without gagging ourselves with the bristle end of a round brush. 
And the stories she would tell *the staff* - GURL! Those were *next level messy.*

This humanoid ebola virus once told me she was having s** with her DAUGHTER'S FRIEND'S DAD in an RV while the two girls were SLEEPING BENEATH THEM ON THE BOTTOM BUNK!!!

But Wait!! There's more...

Her daughter's friend's dad was...MAaRRiiiEDD!!!!!

I swear on my marriage I am not making this shit up.

Hopefully this gives you all a little bit of insight into this lady's mushy lizard brain. 
Now...onto the main course:

I had graduated two weeks before starting my first day at Dracula's salon. I was hired as an assistant in order to practice more before moving on to be a junior stylist and so on and so forth...
I had practiced cuts, colour and styling on mannequins throughout all of school and my last semester was actually spent entirely in the school's discount salon practicing with real clients. Dracula's salon *did* allow for assistants to come in *outside* of our work hours with clients we would find ourselves but otherwise our actual work days consisted of doing every client's shampoo, applying toners, treatments and all the cleaning and maintenance of the salon, while simultaneously serving guests drinks, cleaning up the hairdresser's workstations in between clients, sweeping the floor and washing all the towels, aprons, smocks, colour bowls and brushes. 

After working there for a little over 2.5 years and getting a whole lot more in depth training, I finally decided to bring in one of my friends who wanted a haircut. I got permission from management and asked that my supervisor be my favourite senior stylist - let's call him Marcus - since we needed to be supervised during our appointments until we qualified to become junior stylists. 
My friend wanted to do a big chop.
She went from having  hair halfway down her back to a *bob*.
It. Was. Fire. 
I was super proud of myself, Markus did give me super helpful tips, but mostly just watched and didn't actually hover over me, he would go back and forth from his clients and would come watch/guide me every so often. When I was done, everyone around us said it looked awesome on her, and my friend was in love with it and felt like a million bucks. 
After lots of admiring in the mirror and some selfies we get up from the chair and go take a few ""after"" photos for my Instagram page. When we're done with those I go downstairs to the staff room to grab my things so we can leave.

Enter...Dracula.
As I'm packing my things with a giant smile on my face I hear her take a sharp inhale and say:
(For this part let's pretend my name is Victoria)

""Victoria...do you know what the procedure is when assistants want to bring in their own clients for practice?""

""Um..yeah of course"" I answered kind of confused.

""Well *CLEARLY* you don't""

I'm just silent at this point.

""You know, I can't have you coming in here to *play hairdresser* whenever you want. I have a reputation to uphold. My salon is honestly the best in the city, and I might dare say the whole country...so you can't just come in and do as you please with zero training. It's important for you to understand that basically *everything* you did during that haircut was wrong. You should have been supervised the *entire* time and you're also suppose to *ask* if you can come in with your client""

""But...Dracula... that's exactly what I did; I asked Gemma (the manager) and I was being supervised by Markus, with his permission. Gemma set the whole thing up in the schedule"" 

""Yeah, well you never asked *me*, so next time you want to bring in a client, make sure to follow the proper procedure and also *ask* when you don't know what you're doing and need help""

I. Was. Mortified. 

She had completely broken my spirit. I went upstairs, grabbed my friend and we left the salon quickly, but without a peep. 
After I left I got a text from the assistant manager - let's call her Courtney - who was really nice and always had the backs of the assistants. She asked me if I was okay because I looked a little sad when I left. I told her what happened and she said that was really not okay and she thinks I should try talking to Dracula and letting her know I didn't appreciate how she spoke to me.  She said she was certain that Dracula would totally see how she was over the line and apologize and then I wouldn't be left feeling so crappy. 
For a little more context, most of the staff had been there since day 1 when the salon opened, and they were all very close. They were also a little blind to Dracula's problematic side and constantly made excuses for her. ""You just don't know her very well yet. She's actually really cool and down to earth, you just need to get to know her better"" bla bla bla.

To be fair though, they had a good reason to be a little blind, because the salon was run *very* well and their set up was basically a hairdresser's dream. They had full control over their schedules and prices, they made 50% commission on every service, everything was done by the book and they were declared as actual employees for tax purposes. So they would get paid vacation weeks, they had the right to ei if ever they got injured or sick and needed to stop working, paid maternity or paternity leave and they could even stock pile their vacation days if they wanted. Meaning they could choose to not go on vacation for let's say two whole years and on the third they would take a month and a half off. So I didn't necessarily blame them for not wanting to see the owner's less than ideal side. 

After the text from the assistant manager Courtney I decided to take her advice and I set up a meeting with Dracula. In order to do that, I had to message Gemma because she handled Dracula's schedule. So I did, and Gemma set the whole thing up. 
Cut to the day of the meeting.
I'm downstairs in the staff room waiting for her to show up. I waited for *10 minutes*...
Finally, she shows up and sits down in front of me, visibly irritated and abruptly starts the whole thing by saying:

""Okay Victoria, so what the fuck is all this drama?"" 

""Ummm...Pardon me?"" I said, super taken aback by her snappy attitude and tone of voice.

""Well I get a text message from Gemma, who had her weekend *ruined* because you decided you're ""insulted"" by what I said to you the other day?"" 

""I'm sorry, what? How did I ruin her weekend? All I did was ask for a meeting with you like we're all supposed to do when we want to set one up"" 

""Yeah, but you're not supposed to text her *on her day off* with all your drama"" 

""I really didn't cause any drama, I just asked for a meeting, and Gemma has told me and the other assistants about 100 times that no matter the day, if we need anything or have any questions that we should just text her, because she keeps her phone on vibrate and it's never a bother to her, because she'll just see it the next time she checks her pho -"" 

""Let's just get down to this ""issue"" you're having"" she cuts me off before I can finish.

So I nervously explained to her how I felt and told her I didn't appreciate her tone, and some of her words too, like saying I was ""playing"" hairdresser and so on...

""I'm sorry you feel like I disrespected you, but you should really know me better than that by now, when I said you were ""playing hairdresser"" I just meant that as like an expression, sometimes I just say banal things and they aren't meant to be taken to heart. So I'm sorry you took it badly, but you really should know me better than that. I'm not a rude person, I'm not mean, I'm not a bully. And you *should*  understand that I have a reputation to uphold. So making this into a big drama about your feelings being hurt because I was doing my job as the owner of the best salon in the city is just immature and a waste of everyone's time. Next time you can just ask me to teach you how to properly cut hair, I'm an excellent mentor and I've told you time and time again that I'll take time out of *my very busy schedule* and take you under my wing. Maybe let's focus on growing instead of causing drama and bothering people on their weekend, hm?"" She said to me, with the squintiest little bitch face I ever saw. 

I couldn't say anything at that point honestly. I just gave a half baked smile and nodded my head. 

After that I went home and cried of anger and confusion. I knew she had basically gaslit me and deflected everything, but I was so taken aback by everything she was saying that I froze completely in the moment. I was *so mad* at myself for not standing up to her and letting her walk all over me. 
After a few hours though, my anger shifted from being mad at myself to being livid at her. That's when I decided I was done, I was going to look for a different salon and quit. So I moved in the shadows  and 4-ish months later I found myself a new salon where I would get to work side by side with senior stylists and actually help them with their colour applications and blow-dries daily and also practice my cuts, by myself, on any client I brought in, and I'd get to do this whenever I wanted during my work week, and actually get paid for it! Unlike at Dracula's salon. 

Now I found this new salon right before Christmas time, which is a hairdresser's busiest time of the year, so I had told the new salon owners that I wanted to be able to finish the entire Christmas season with my current salon, so that I didn't leave my coworkers to train a new assistant during the busiest time of year. They genuinely loved that and said they would absolutely be okay with me coming on board in the new year. So I signed my contract with them and then even decided I would give Dracula the full month and a half notice of my departure because that would give Gemma enough time to find a replacement while I was still there, and they would be fully trained by the time I left. 

I told my assistant manager first over some coffee and a smoke outside because her and I were actually close, and she was genuinely happy for me. The annoying thing was that the meeting with Dracula also needed to be outside, because there was some necessary maintenance going on in the staff room. It was me, Dracula and Gemma in the meeting. I gather all my courage and I start off by saying how I'm really grateful for the opportunity of working at such a well established salon and I've learned so much and blablabla - *all that nice stuff*. To be able to leave on good terms, because again, hairdressers *talk* and word of feuds and drama spreads like mono at a college party. I told them that I was only leaving because this new salon would allow me the opportunity to learn every day by working side by side with senior stylists, because again, I didn't want to leave on bad terms. So I couldn't just go out there and say ""Dracula - I'm leaving because you're a total c*nt storm""  which would have been the real reason... 

The whole time that I'm talking, Dracula is looking at me with the JUDGIEST face of all time, she almost looked disgusted. When I finished telling her everything and thanking both her and Gemma profusely, all hell breaks loose. Dracula starts *raising her voice at me* - keep in mind we are still *outside* - and saying that I'm being completely played because ""no salon lets assistants work side by side with senior stylists"" - keep in mind this is coming from a woman that outright told me that's how she learned, and got her diploma after just as a formality - she said that I was basically saying a giant F You to her and ""everything she did for me"" she said that I was never going become a hairdresser if I didn't ""get proper mentorship"" and that it didn't matter that I was giving a month and a half notice and that I was, in fact, abandoning my coworkers and scr**ing them all over during the busiest time of the year, because it's still busy after the new year. 

TO BE CLEAR - the minute New Years is over, most hair salons go into the slowest time of their entire year because people need to recover financially from the whole Christmas spending. 

Suffice it to say that I went back inside crying my eyes out. I immediately went downstairs to just throw in a batch of laundry and cry in peace, because, Oh Yeah! I still had an 8 hour shift to finish after that...
At this time the maintenance guy is gone and I'm just crying and doing laundry. Markus comes downstairs and sees the state I'm in and I tell him the jist of what happened. He said that it was outrageous and that I should leave for the rest of the day so she can learn to appreciate me, because I certainly did her a favour by giving her *a month and a half notice* when I had zero legal obligation to do so. He said that the hairstylists would be able to survive me leaving for the day, and that he would help the other stylists himself to help compensate for my absence as much as possible. I thanked him and told him I wouldn't do that because I didn't want to make things worse. 

But then...
In walks Courtney....and she's crying her eyes out.
For context, this is NOT a person that will cry easily, like at all. We both ask her what's wrong and she says that she went to speak to Dracula and see how the talk went, and that Dracula became furious with her for not telling her that I was leaving when she found out - even though she only found out maybe 10 minutes before Dracula did - and she literally *yelled at her* outside, and said horrible things to her. She then went on to say that she honestly didn't want to finish her shift and that she was leaving. That's when I said ""well if you're going, I'm going too"" 

So we packed our shit and left.
We talked the whole way home and when we had to part ways we were still texting back and forth. I got home and went directly to my bestie's house to smoke some 🌿 💨 after that orange-juice-after-toothpaste of a morning. 
That's when I get a text. From Dracula...

I didn't even read the full message and immediately went to tell Courtney that she texted me. When I'm typing I can see that Courtney is *also* typing. We both send our messages and they're identical:
""Dracula just texted me"" 
We send each other screenshots of the texts and MY FLABBERS WERE GASTED! This used Q-tip actually texted us both not even 1 minute apart, two very long texts, which clearly showed she drafted them both before sending them out. 
So the b**** actually put *thought* into these. 
Let's just say, our messages had *very* different energies to them. Mine was just more deflection and berratement, while Courtney's was *so much nicer* 

She went on and on in her text to Courtney apologizing to her and telling her how valued she is. 
After reading each other's texts we were both *livid*. Courtney saw plain as day how manipulative she was and said she was disgusted by how different the messages were. She said that Dracula was only being nice to her because she was afraid of losing a second employee, but likely decided she had nothing to lose in being mean to me some more because I had quit already anyways. That's when I snapped. I agreed with Courtney and said that if Dracula really thinks she has nothing to lose, then allow me to prove her wrong. I sent a text message to Gemma and said that I was quitting effective immediately and that she should have thought twice before *yet again* treating me like crap. 

After I quit, I was still in contact with Courtney and she would give me *allll the tea* about the fallout at the salon with the senior stylists and the other assistants. After just a few weeks, the other assistants started to leave, one by one, they all found better salons, and with the turn over rate for assistants sky rocketing and most of the new ones not lasting longer than 2 months, the hairdressers just got more and more mad at Dracula, because they need the help of the assistants in order to stay on track of their double and sometimes triple booked schedules. Their days were becoming increasingly harder and more stressful and soon enough they were all voicing their anger at Dracula. She became so stressed that she developed shingles... She also got hit in the face super hard by a branch one day because she wasn't watching where she was going. As the weeks went on I just got more and more stories about the bad karma that was following Dracula everywhere. The dad of her daughter's friend that she had slept with went on to cheat on her, with her neighbour - in her RV!! Her daughter moved out to live with her father full time in a different city. Her car got towed 5 different times and more and more wonderful little happenings that were apparently sending her completely over the edge as time went on.
It was HILARIOUS! And then... I got the best message in the world. 
This was just 4 months after I quit. 
Courtney texts me:
""Gemma quit and went back to Egypt"" 

THE FLABBERS!!! ALL OF THEM GASTED! 

Gemma was Dracula's most important employee because she held that salon together and did *literally everything* when it came to running it behind the scenes. All the paperwork, all the hiring, the orders, the schedules, the books. EVERYTHING. 
She said that Dracula had been driving Gemma insane ever since I quit and that Gemma was starting to really crack with how unreasonable and hard to talk to Dracula had become. The straw that broke the camel's back was when Dracula SHOWED UP AT GEMMA'S HOUSE and YELLED at her for wanting to take a vacation. Gemma's husband had to *physically remove* Dracula from their home and Gemma quit right then and there via a two word text to Dracula. It took about a year after that but Dracula did lose literally every single one of her senior stylists and despite having hired new ones, because they simply didn't come with the clientele that her previous stylists did; her salon sank. She had to sell everything at a loss and went on to work in a tiny neighbourhood salon. It's now been nearly a decade (I'm 32 now) Dracula's still working there as far as I'm concerned and all my old coworkers are working in wonderful salons in big cities, making bank and living their best lives. Gemma is still in Egypt and decided she's retired and just spending time with her husband, family and her three dogs. Courtney left to go live her best life in Europe and as for me, I stayed in hairdressing for about 5 years until I moved on to a very high paying corporate job in a different city, working for a company that was voted best company to work for. I get treated like an actual human and work with wonderfully caring people that don't take themselves too seriously. I'm also *very* happily married to my best friend in the whole world, soon to be celebrating our second year of bliss! And we're about to move into our brand new home - the first one we ever got to pick together, since we've been living in an apartment I've had since before meeting him.

1o8l61n,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/1o8l61n/how_does_this_old_process_usually_work/,How does this OLD process usually work?,"Hello,

A bit of backstory.


I (42m) am semi-recently separated (3 months), and am venturing back into dating after 21 years together, 17 married. The marriage has really been over for a while as far as I am concerned, she cheated multiple times almost 6 years back, we tried to reconcile, and I was the only one that really put forth the effort to save it. She again threatened divorce 6mo ago, and she decided one last try when I was ready to call it. Reluctantly agreed to give it another shot. 3mo ago, she filed, and I am totally okay with it. We have a (13f) child together that we will co-parent.


There is still some rough road yet to come, but he emotional attachment and coming to terms with the end of the relationship has already happened as far as I'm concerned. I've been through the ups and downs of this split a few times now, and feel I am in a place where I need to see what the next phase of my life could look like.


I know the advice is to give yourself a ton of time to heal after these kind of relationships, but I don't really think the 1-month per year rule which has me out of commission for almost 2 years is something I want to endure. I am a semi-retired tech guy, who pulled the FIRE trigger back in 2022, and am not looking to sit around by myself all day doing my somewhat introverted hobbies, or ruminating about the past. I want to move forward, get out and meet someone. I would love to have someone to travel, garden, and entertain company with (I love to host dinner parties, bonfires, etc). I have a pretty solid support group of old college friends and former colleagues I've known for decades (They are all married and paired off, some with kids), but they live an hour away in the city. I live out in the country. So that makes it hard to naturally find a compatible person ""in the wild"".


I've been in therapy for a few months, and feel like the next step for me is to move on and see what life without my ex might look like. If I am lucky and find someone I am more compatible with, that would be a bonus. Really looking for a LTR, and not in a huge rush to make anything happen. If it does happen organically tho, great.


----


Anyways, given all of the above, I tried my luck at the apps. I have been selectively swiping right and diligently weeding out the criteria that are not a fit for where I am in life. 


I matched with someone (43f) who also has a kid of same age (13f), similar hobbies, and overall seemed like a great fit. She knows I am separated and not divorced (no surprises intended here), and is also looking to take things slow and with intention. Perfect, because I am not looking for a hook up. We chatted for an hour or so in the app, everything seems all good, and agreed to meet up for coffee and sus out our chemistry. We haven't yet nailed down a specific date, but it is likely sometime next week because there is some heinous construction project for the next 4-5 days right in-between us, so just makes sense to push off the meetup for a few days.


Now, I've been out of the dating game for a looong time, and I am probably overthinking everything, but how should I be approaching this from a process perspective? If we nail down a day to get some coffee, and it's a week out, do I still ""check-in"" daily and try to have another long conversation with this person? I don't really want to come off too strong/needy, as that would be really unappealing if it happened to me. At the same time, I don't want to feel like ""Cool, I locked in this IRL meetup"" and then go nearly silent as that could be misinterpreted as disinterest, etc.


How does a normal, healthy dynamic between two 40+ adults using OLD tend to go in everyone's experience?


Any practical advice for a dude who is absolutely terrified to jump back into the dating scene in his 40s around how to approach this stuff?

I think this post about coffee belongs here, rather than *r / coffee*, because it also has something to do with Dutch supermarkets.

# On with the post
## Mand (in short)
I have a percolator. Which coffee should I consider that is sold at Albert Heijn, Lidl, Jumbo and Picnic. I am looking for coffee that is strong of taste, not too acidic and reasonably priced.

## Details
I have recently bought a Bialetti Venus percolator and I am almost through my pack of **Douwe Egberts rood grove maling**. Now I want to explore other ""malingen"" and/or brands. 

*Google, have you tried it?*
* Yes, most results were of webshops that advice brands that only they sell. Usually either the shipping cost or the minimum purchase amount  is too high for me to gamble.

*Why don't you just buy and discover?*
* A pack of coffee has a considerable amount of servings. That combined with the price per pack, I want to minimise the risk of purchasing coffee I don't like.

I  am curious about:
* What coffee you use for your percolator.
* What you like about that coffee.",2,1760655862.0,Netherlands,4,0.75,False

My heart is shattered to million pieces my sweet big brother gave me the whole world, my whole life he always goes above and beyond to see me happy he never failed me or fought with me not even once. The last few years I failed him so bad because I was busy with my life, he was diagnosed severe depression and he always wanted to hang out with me yet I always had excuses especially last few months he kept texting me saying that he misses me so much that he wants to have coffee with me sometimes what did I respond? I kept saying that i was busy with work. I cannot hate myself more at the moment, the guilt is torturing me Im crawling into my bed 24/7 drowning in my tears. Im on therapy and medication nothing can help. My family is with me but I can hear my mom every day whining while she’s literally sleeping. We are devastated. My sweet brother was the sweetest human being. I don’t think I can ever recover. I lost interest in literally everything. This guilt is too much to bear on top of the grief which I think is some kind of human flaw because I cannot stress enough how much I am in devastation right now. I miss my brother. I wanna talk to him one last time. I truly wanna truly want to believe in afterlife. The thought of not seeing him forever kills me and shatters me into million pieces. Everyday I wake up in the morning with intense fear crippling sensation with my heart beating so incredibly fast. He used to tell me that mornings when he first wakes up is the worst part of his day. I understand now big brother. I love you big brother so much and Im sorry I did not say that enough to you I am sorry I wasn’t there when you needed me the most I am sorry for everything and my only hope in this life is that I can see you someday sometime after I die

So she has many years of gifts and birthday celebrations to catch up on due to the age gap. 

I got some gifts and stuff she asked for. Nothing too crazy. Probably $100 all in.she has no idea, I just get given hints by her throughout the year. 

I don’t care. It’s my sister. You only get one birthday a year and I want her to have something nice to remember it by. And I’ve also booked us a nice meal. I said I’d pay for the meal so nobody could back out of it. 

My mom pulls me aside when I met her today and said; “Oh, I’m not getting her much this year I’m watching my money and trying to spend less, budget & cut down”. “I’m also not sure about the meal because it isn’t the sort of place I’d like to eat at”

Then does the classic narc nod, stare and sigh like “Yep, I’m doing the right thing for me, but now I’ve put you in a shitty situation and I don’t care either way”

ITS YOUR FREAKING DAUGHTER 

AND SHE CHOSE THE PLACE TO EAT, NOT YOU, YOU UNGRATEFUL F*CK 

She then showed me what she’d got her as a present, and I’m sorry, but it was an insult. 

I know it’s not all about money, but it was literally $10-15 worth of random stuff. With zero thought whatsoever. It looked like somebody had emptied the contents of a backpack like after you do a long day of travelling. 

I NEARLY LOST IT 

She is not broke, but is acting like the world owes her something and she is down to her last dollar. 

This is the same person who will go out shopping to random markets on the weekend and spend $30 on takeout food. 

Or eat out for lunch and spend $17 on a sandwich and coffee. 

She just doesn’t want to spend any money that isn’t being spent on herself. 

So, my sisters birthday…… she doesn’t care one bit. 

I just feel sorry for my sister. She’s so excited about it. But I can already tell that her birthday is going to be a total disappointment and my mom will hijack it to make it all about herself and ruin it. 

I’m just trying my hardest that I can to make it special. 

I just feel so guilty for my sister because she’s only just starting to realise that she isn’t going to have the life that she sees all her friends are given by their parents. 

She’s at the age where it’s started to click that she’s been emotionally ignored and rejected her whole life. But has been too young to realise it until now.

1o8kzju,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1o8kzju/beginner_buyer_advice_grinder_400aud/,Beginner buyer advice - Grinder [$400AUD],"Hi all,

I love coffee, and recently bought my first machine a - Delonghi Delica 885 - to start making my own long blacks.  After researching the forum, I now understand how important a grinder is and am on the search for one.  I don’t know if I will stick with it,  but am enjoying it so far.  I am also very caffine sensitive, so can only have one a day limited my use of the machine and this is making me weary about spending too much.  The options avaliable are:

$150 - second hand Fellow Optus $250 - Encore ESP from Amazon $419 - D54 new Open to other ideas/alternatives! I also note that it may be worth waiting for Black Friday deals

I understanding the D54 has got fantastic reviews, but am weary about spending that light after only been in the game for the week especially as this would be double I paid for the Delica. Any suggestions/reccomendations would be appreciated",1,1760655448.0,espresso,0,1.0,False
