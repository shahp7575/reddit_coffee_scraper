1juc6vg,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpanishAIlines/comments/1juc6vg/common_spanish_verb_pairs_that_often_confuse/,Common Spanish Verb Pairs That Often Confuse Learners,"Here are some pairs of Spanish verbs that may seem similar and are often confused by learners ‚Äî especially English speakers. So I‚Äôve explained the differences between them to help you stop mixing them up and really understand when each one is used.

1. Trabajar vs. Funcionar

Both can be translated as ‚Äúto work‚Äù, but they‚Äôre used in very different contexts.

Trabajar = when a person or living being works. It refers to having a job or putting in effort.

Ejemplo: Trabajo en una oficina.‚Üí I work in an office.

Funcionar = is always used when a thing or system ‚Äúworks.‚Äù It refers to machines, devices, plans, ideas ‚Äî anything non-human.

Ejemplo: Mi tel√©fono no funciona.‚Üí My phone doesn‚Äôt work.

2. Moverse vs. Mudarse

Moverse = to move your body or shift position. Used for people, animals, or anything that changes place momentarily.

Ejemplo: No te muevas. ‚Üí Don‚Äôt move.

Mudarse = to change residence (move house, city, etc.) This is for long-term relocation ‚Äî changing where you live.

Ejemplo: Nos mudamos a Barcelona el a√±o pasado. ‚Üí We moved to Barcelona last year.

3. Beber vs. Tomar (Tomar has many meanings, but here we‚Äôre focusing only on the cases where it can be translated as ‚Äúto drink‚Äù)

Beber = to drink (literal, slightly more formal). Used more in written or neutral contexts.

Ejemplo:

Bebo mucha agua. ‚Üí I drink a lot of water.

Tomar = to drink / to take. It‚Äôs more common in everyday speech and has a broader meaning.

Ejemplos:

¬øQuieres tomar algo?‚Üí Do you want something to drink? / Wanna grab a drink?

Tomar un caf√© ‚Üí Have a coffee.

4. Tardar vs. Durar¬†

Tardar = how long someone or something takes to do something. It‚Äôs about the duration of the action from the point of view of the person or thing doing it.

Ejemplo: Tardo 10 minutos en llegar al trabajo. ‚Üí It takes me 10 minutes to get to work.

Durar = how long something lasts or continues. It focuses on the duration of an event or object ‚Äî how long it is happening.

Ejemplo: La pel√≠cula dura dos horas.‚Üí The movie lasts two hours.

1juc5gk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Burryology/comments/1juc5gk/starbucks_coffee_tariffs_adam_smith_and_you/,"Starbucks, coffee, tariffs, Adam Smith, and you...","As I sit here with my second cup of coffee, I realized something. I had a vague notion that coffee couldn't be produced in much of the US, and it was essentially impossible/impractical in almost of of the CUS (the US does produce coffee in Hawaii and Puerto Rico, and a tiny amount in particular areas of CA). 

From a quick search, Brazil, Vietnam, Colombia, Indonesia, and Ethiopia are the largest coffee producers in the world. These countries have the climate necessary as well as the historic ""industry"" in place to facilitate coffee growing and production for consumption. Certainly, each has local consumers, but they can produce far more than their citizens could or would consume. So they can export and fill the desire/demand of countries like the US, where there is great demand, but essentially no ability to grow our own suitable to meet our national demand. 

So, OK, great, we have a source of the coffee we demand. Now what? As always, I speak only for myself, but a big bowl of coffee beans or grounds is not really what I want, in the morning or anytime at all. I want ""coffee"" as a beverage. So I looked at the various ways my wife and I have to turn the beans and ground coffee into what we actually want. China, Germany, Italy, Costa Rica, and the US were the sources of the things we use. I suspect China is probably the largest supplier of ""coffee makers"" in/to the US. China produces a comparatively small amount of the world's coffee and apparently, Starbucks buys about half of that production. Costa Rica is also a coffee producer, but my Costa Rican coffee ""appliance"" is a chorreador - basically a sack in a stand, which could be made anywhere, even at home with a needle, thread, and a pocket knife. The US coffee maker is an 75-year-old cold drip Filtron, which is really just a few glass and Bakelite things. One could essentially replicate it with lab glassware or even a gallon jar and some cheesecloth. The electric bean grinders and ""coffee makers"" are pretty much single-purpose items that require a factory and labor to produce. The Chinese, Germans, and Italians have both already and seem to make decent products at prices people will pay (see Adam Smith).

Much of the world loves coffee (the beverage). We might disagree on some or many things, but we agree on our love, desire, and even demand for coffee. I've noticed no great rumblings in the US over the sources of the coffee or the devices that produce it for us. I don't like Starbucks and know essentially nothing about their devices, so I Googled it. Apparently, it gets its makers from a Swiss company and HEY! Bunn! A US company who makes it in the US. I see Bunn coffee makers everywhere. In fact, I know people who have home versions.

So, where is all this coffee klatching headed? Well, it seems to me that the coffee situation has pretty well handled itself to the world's general, if imperfect, satisfaction. Each country ""chips in"" what it can and is generally good at doing, the world's coffee fans get generally, if imperfectly, what they want, and life moves along generally, if imperfectly, just fine. Great news, world! Well done!

But...tariffs. OK, the US is going to slap a tariff on just about everything involved in our morning coffee, except presumably the Bunn makers. But wait, there's more! A little research and common knowledge says that while Bunn makes it machines in the US, with US workers, etc., there are one hell of a lot of non-US items that go into them doing that. From the machines that make various parts to the computers that control them, to the planes, trains, cars, bikes, buses, etc. that get the workers to the plants and around to where they may need to go, to the microwaves that heat their lunches to...it just goes on and on. 

And now, Trump and his Bottom-of-the-Barrel Gang are going to fuck with and fuck up the whole thing. It was working fine enough for government work. Was it perfect? Nothing's perfect. I know I enjoy my morning coffee. I know a lot of people around the world do, too. Morning, mid-day, evening - we might kill each other over the Gods we make, but on coffee, it's kumbaya, brothers, sisters, sisters who want to be brothers, brothers who want to be sisters, and those who are undecided at the moment.

And now, a bunch of idiots, led by a cut-rate would-be tinpot dictator, is going to fuck that up for everyone. These idiots claim to be economic experts with all sorts of fancy educations. I have a fancy education myownself. Coincidentally, finance and economics were a large part of it. I've heard of Adam Smith. In fact, I've read his work and studied those who followed. It is, or at least it was, part of an fancy advanced education in the subject. I'm beginning to suspect that these clowns may not be as educated and knowledgeable as they tell everyone (and themselves). 

Anyway, it's amazing what you can learn from just your morning coffee...if you have an open mind and an education (fancy optional, as always) and actually know how to use both of them. Have a great morning and enjoy your coffee. While you still can.",2,1744114712.0,Burryology,0,1.0,False

Can you imagine a 22 year old,  who appeared to be an optimistic survivor after living in the USA, then Poland, balancing with 2 universities in different countries simultaneously all by herself? With strong dedication to change the world but having no single idea of how to do it? Well, that was me. 

I applied my CV to every company where there was any mention of ‚ÄúTranslator or Interpreter‚Äù. Surprisingly, I started receiving calls. It was Friday when I was supposed to have 3 interviews. The first one went well, but I could literally feel that I was in the wrong place and there was no space for me and my ambitions of changing the world.

I was having a coffee break in-between when my phone rang. It was an invitation for the interview in the reproductive clinic. What does it even mean? But the girl sounded so pleasant and I checked Google map and it was not too far from my coffee break, so I decided to give it a try and said ‚Äúyes‚Äù to the interview promptly. Of course, I didn‚Äôt have time to check on the clinic and I had no idea what I was getting myself into, as you can imagine. 

I was greeted by a girl who I spoke over the phone with and offered me to sit and wait for the Senior Manager to come. While I was waiting, there was another girl who suddenly started to talk to me in English, so I realised it was the beginning of my interview already. I smiled and did my best to look up for smart words and collocations I used to study at the university haha. Apparently, I did well because when the Senior Manager came in she just nodded. I believe it meant that my English was tolerable.

I wish I would remain that successful during the next stage of my interview but I wasn‚Äôt. The Senior Manager didn‚Äôt look that friendly-oriented at all. She started with ordinary questions about my work experience. I believe I was in the middle of my story when she came straight to the point with that one question: ‚ÄúDo you at least know what HCG means?‚Äù. I knew it was a ‚Äúcall it a day‚Äù moment. Of course, I didn‚Äôt. But I was very curious to find out and to show my strong interest in this totally unknown abbreviation. Yeah, she explained it. Very reserved and clear. And after that we said good bye to each other. There was another girl waiting for the interview. 

After I exited I started googling about reproductive health, infertility, IVF etc. It was such a new world for me yet I could feel my heart racing with the idea to work here. I even cancelled the next interviews hoping to get the job. But what were my chances after that question? Let‚Äôs be honest, none. 

Surprisingly, my phone rang in a couple of hours. It was that pleasant girl who called earlier asking if I could start next Monday. Can you imagine the mixture of feelings I had at that point? I said yes! I was reading up on the clinic I was supposed to start working at, and did a thorough research about infertility treatment for hours on end. I promised myself that it was my last moment of embarrassment and it was a lesson for me to get myself prepared for the interview. The only thing I was hoping to do was not see the Senior Manager on my first day of work because she literally scared me out of hell. And guess what? She was there and we were supposed to work together. Luckily, the first impression was wrong and she appeared to be an extraordinary woman and we have been working together for more than 8 years since then:)

The thought that I can change people‚Äôs lives for the better drives me. My servant philosophy centres on empathy, empowering others and being compassionate. 

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I chose the reproductive field, it is quite the opposite: the reproductive field chose me. I feel special having an extremely important mission - help people to become parents. Thank you for choosing me‚Äù.

1juc1d5,https://www.reddit.com/r/SustainabilityViews/comments/1juc1d5/sustainability_news_today/,Sustainability News Today,"**Title: Sustainability Strategy: Mastering the Four Lenses Framework**

Hey Redditors,

I recently stumbled upon an insightful Harvard Business Review article that sheds light on why many companies‚Äô sustainability efforts might be missing the mark. If you're in any way involved in sustainability planning‚Äîor even just interested in the topic‚Äîthis framework could be a game-changer. Let's dive into the key takeaways and explore how these can be communicated effectively on social media!

### **Why Some Sustainability Efforts Fall Short**

The central theme is all about focus‚Äîor the lack thereof. Companies often dilute their impact by trying to address an overwhelming number of sustainability issues. On average, businesses spread themselves across nearly **12 priority topics**! No wonder many sustainability initiatives falter before they truly begin. 

What's the solution, you ask? A strategic focus on a few key areas that impact your business most substantially.

---

### **The Four Lenses Framework**

To cut through the noise and hone in on what really matters, the article introduces a **Four Lenses Framework**. This helps businesses prioritize issues according to overlapping criteria:

1. **Stakeholder Influence**: What matters most to your customers, employees, and partners? Ignoring this can result in stakeholder discontent and lost opportunities.
  
2. **Science & Technology**: Use robust data to spotlight environmental and operational risks. For instance, how will climate change affect your supply chain?
  
3. **Business Fundamentals**: Align sustainability endeavors with financial performance. If it doesn‚Äôt make business sense, it‚Äôs less likely to earn executive buy-in.

4. **Ethics & Purpose**: Let your core values guide you. Whether it‚Äôs fair labor practices or community development, grounding efforts in what you stand for builds credibility.

### **Case in Point: Keurig Dr Pepper‚Äôs Pod Solution**

The article uses Keurig Dr Pepper as a prime example. They tackled the massive waste issue from their coffee pods by adopting recyclable materials, driven by scientific insight into product life cycles and stakeholder demands (consumer concerns over environmental impact).

### **Social Media Post Ideas**

Here are some ready-to-go post ideas to share these insights effectively on social media platforms:

Shifted to a semi auto recently (DF54 + solis perfetta plus), and although I love making coffee with it, am too busy right now and have been skipping coffee because don't have the time to make it

So, need to get a super automatic. Only drink milk drink (latte, machiattos, etc), sometimes flavored sometimes not.

Was going to choose the philips latteGo but I've read the milk isn't great and not hot enough, which is a big drawback for me considering I only drink milk drinks and like them hot.

Any recommendations would be great, thanks!

Core requirements  
\- super easy to clean (dishwasher safe components, easy to remove, easy to install)  
\- the less cleaning required the better  
\- easy to maintain (descaling, etc is easy)  
\- one-click coffee  
\- good, hot milk  
\- (very optional) add pre-ground coffee so I can leverage my df54

But here‚Äôs the thing‚Äîwe‚Äôre all in this mess together. I‚Äôve picked up a few tricks that help me claw my way out when overwhelm hits hard, so I figured I‚Äôd share:
	
‚Ä¢ Take a break. Sounds wild when you‚Äôre stressed, but stepping away for a sec‚Äîlike a quick walk or just zoning out‚Äîcan reset your brain.

‚Ä¢ Talk it out. Venting to a friend, my dog, or even the void helps me unclog my head.

‚Ä¢ Make a list. Dumping everything on paper makes it look less like a monster hiding under the bed.
	
‚Ä¢ Break it down. Big task freaking you out? Chop it into bite-sized pieces and tackle one at a time.

‚Ä¢ Ask for help. I‚Äôm still working on this, but leaning on friends or coworkers can be a game-changer.
	
‚Ä¢ Self-care basics. Eating something that‚Äôs not just coffee, sleeping decently, maybe a stretch‚Äîkeeps me from imploding.
	
‚Ä¢ You‚Äôre not alone. Seriously, millions of us are out here adulting badly together.

If you‚Äôre feeling buried right now, just know there‚Äôs people who‚Äôve got your back. 

Remember, you're not alone.

My sales were basically zero because I wasn't actually doing anything.The penny dropped when I realized the issue wasn't the product... it was me.

So, I decided to try something kinda nuts: Actively go hunting for 'NOs'.My weird challenge: Try and collect 10 rejections a week. Not by being annoying, just by asking for slightly bolder things:Asking someone for free help (surprisingly works sometimes!)

This is a long story but I want to make it short.

I met this guy last year in April in the library and we opened up a lot, very fast. He eventually introduced me to a lot of his friends and family and we talked more (started going to his church). He's one of those very argumentative guys who has strong beliefs and rarely negotiates (loves to debate types and laugh at you for not agreeing with him). I didn't see this side of him until things settled down.

I gave him a lot of advice regarding girls and career stuff etc. I came to him for advice like once regarding a job interview I had even though he doesn't have experience with interviews (he works at a movie theatre and I work in a high rise office. im not putting him down when I say this for your information but he hints at wishing he could do my type of job). The other day, the topic of politics came up and he mentioned how he is a republican and asked what I support and I said democrat. He said he guessed its probably because my father was a democrat and I said yes, partially but not entirely because of my father. He laughed and said how much (in terms of influence) ? I said I wouldn't quantify it and then he said ok ""I'm gonna assume a lot"" and started to tell me about how everything ive agreed with is basically what republicans support. it sounded like he was trying to convince me, subtly - even started telling me to go read more on DJT and what he stands for and to not listen to media's that destroy his reputation.

The next day, over text, I addressed the part where he assumed im solely a democrat because of my father and said ""Hey Charles, I didn‚Äôt appreciate how you tried boxing me in yesterday when you said you believe the reason I‚Äôm liberal is solely due to my father after I told you I didn‚Äôt want to go into politics. An apology will suffice"". This sparked conflict and asked me to meet him in person which I did. But he sent this before we met that evening when we went back and forth :

""Ok. See you next time. Consider this friendship over. But I‚Äôm looking forward to taking about what you didn‚Äôt like about what I said and, if warranted, an apology will be made. Things will be cordial and amicable moving forward, but this friendship is over my dear bro. You are my brother in Christ, but a friendship is out of the question. I‚Äôll hit u up for next time. I‚Äôm looking forward to it.""

I ended up going to meet. I bought us both coffee at Starbucks and sat on a couch with him. In person, he insulted my character, raised his voice and said I only asked him to apologize because I have low self esteem and low confidence and how I want to bring him down to my level by forcing an apology and submit, how he doesn't trust me, how I love to argue, how controlling I am etc. I told him he's wrong about me and im not doing that and even mentioned the things ive done for him that were in his best interest like uplift him (not to come off as bragging but to dismantle his argument and show him my perspective).

After he left. I sent him this :

I don‚Äôt feel bad about myself Charles nor do I have low self esteem. I'm ok the way I am, Charles even much better than others

This apology thing bothered you that much, to the point where you began insulting me and throwing all kinds of bad words in my direction.¬†

People do things in their life, sometimes bad sometimes good, even you joke about it when it happens.¬†

But you took it seriously today (even the texting) and threw unnecessary bad words against my character.¬†Non stop.

I‚Äôm not interested in ever being friends after this. I don‚Äôt deserve this type of treatment and disrespect. Ciao for now"".

Its been almost 9 weeks of no contact and i've stopped going to that specific church (I get texts from people at church saying they miss me and asking if everything is alright but I just say ive been busy with work and school stuff to avoid drama). When he sees me in passing he just nods my head or actually gives me a pound with his fist and says ""hey what's up Adam"". AITA ?

I went to prepare him a soft drink and my Mum says ""he won't like that"" proceeds to tip it away and makes it how HE likes. 

All I'm thinking is why the hell did he invite himself around if he wanted all of his creature comforts and also GTF out of my house. But I keep the peace for my Mum. You may ask what she is doing whilst this is happening - well, just rolling her eyes as if to say that's just the way he is. 

They are already planning when to come around again. And in all honesty I don't want them here again. Unfortunately my Mum is included in this as she doesn't address his behavior or appear to think it's an issue.

I‚Äôm planning to spend time in Colombo, down South near Mirissa and a few weeks in Trincomalee. 

Excited to travel through your beautiful country and had a few questions:

1) How crazy an idea is it to rent a scooter for the entire month and travel between cities using it? Are the roads and traffic manageable?

2) Any digital nomad hotspot towns with good speciality coffee and some fun sea activities?

3) What‚Äôs a good way to find cheaper mid-term stay (~2 weeks) options compared to Airbnb?",3,1744113041.0,srilanka,2,1.0,False
1jubk16,https://www.reddit.com/r/tbilisi/comments/1jubk16/trying_to_understand_georgian_attitudes_social/,Trying to understand Georgian attitudes & social behavior ‚Äì looking to connect for a real conversation,"Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm currently in Georgia and I‚Äôve been trying to understand something that‚Äôs been on my mind for a while. I‚Äôve traveled and lived in many countries across the world‚Äîincluding places in South Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Europe‚Äîand I‚Äôve never quite encountered a social atmosphere like I have here.

To be fully honest, I‚Äôve experienced a lot of coldness and what felt like rudeness or even hostility, even in situations where I was spending a fair amount of money or just trying to be friendly. As someone who‚Äôs respectful and curious about cultures, this really surprised me. I started researching and noticed that post-Soviet countries often carry a certain collective trauma, and I wonder how much of that might still shape social behavior in Georgia today.

Historically, Central Asia was known for its warmth, hospitality, and openness. Another attitude I found in my research is the concept of ""*ghvino da puri""*, wine and bread, which has a great emphasis on hospitality. So this contrast between the historical attitude and the current social experience in Georgia has really made me think‚Äîand I want to understand, not judge.

I‚Äôd love to talk to someone who‚Äôs open to sharing their view‚Äîeither online through messages or even over a coffee (on me, of course!) somewhere in Tbilisi or wherever it‚Äôs convenient. It‚Äôs not about debate or criticism; I genuinely want to get a first-person perspective on what shaped Georgian society and what people feel themselves.

Thanks in advance to anyone who‚Äôs willing to share. Feel free to DM me if you‚Äôre up for a short chat or meeting up.",0,1744112811.0,tbilisi,5,0.29,False

1jubfuf,https://www.reddit.com/r/BokunoheroFanfiction/comments/1jubfuf/izuku_is_done/,Izuku is done,"""Deku vs. the Horror Cinematic Universe""

Summary:
Izuku Midoriya is trying to become the #1 Hero, but for some godforsaken reason, every horror movie villain keeps crawling into his life. Freddy, Jason, Ghostface, Pennywise, Chucky‚Äîeven the damn Babadook. He doesn‚Äôt know why, he doesn‚Äôt care anymore. He‚Äôs tired, he‚Äôs pissed, and he‚Äôs done playing by horror rules.


The first time Freddy Krueger appears in his dream, Izuku just dropkicks him mid-sentence and sets the entire dreamscape on fire.

Ghostface tries a sneak attack during finals week. Izuku throws a desk at him and says, ‚ÄúTry me again during midterms, coward.‚Äù

Jason shows up. Izuku says nothing‚Äîhe just pulls out a baseball bat made of tungsten and goes feral.

Pennywise taunts him from a sewer. Izuku responds by flooding the sewer with industrial-strength bleach.

Chucky climbs into his backpack. Izuku microwaves the whole thing. Doesn‚Äôt even blink.

The Pro Heroes are confused. The students are scared. But Izuku? He‚Äôs just tired. And done. And unhinged.


Bakugo is terrified. ‚ÄúDeku‚Äôs not even a hero yet and he‚Äôs committed 12 counts of creative homicide.‚Äù

Aizawa refuses to get involved. ""If you're dumb enough to try haunting Midoriya, you deserve what happens to you.""

All Might just kind of watches in horror as Izuku throws hands with Slenderman and wins.

Midoriya starts carrying salt, iron, holy water, a taser, a sledgehammer, and a flamethrower in his support gear. No one questions it anymore.



Absolutely. Here‚Äôs a scene of Class 1-A discovering Izuku‚Äôs nightmare fuel trophy room and regretting every life decision that led them there.


---

Scene: ‚ÄúMidoriya‚Äôs Trophy Room‚Äù

Location: Secret basement under Midoriya‚Äôs dorm room.
Why does he have a basement? No one knows. Not even the school knew it existed. He built it himself out of spite and horror-fueled trauma.


---

The class stares, horrified, at what can only be described as a shrine to violence, terror, and deeply unhinged pettiness.

Ochaco: ‚ÄúI-Is that‚Ä¶ is that Chucky‚Äôs head in a box?!‚Äù

Izuku (calmly sipping tea): ‚ÄúYeah. He wouldn‚Äôt shut up, so I tore half his face off. The other half is a reminder.‚Äù

Chucky‚Äôs head (still alive): ‚ÄúI‚ÄôLL KILL YOU, YOU GREEN-HAIRED‚Äî‚Äù

Izuku presses a button. Chucky gets tased. Again.
‚ÄúPain loop. It resets every five minutes.‚Äù

Kaminari: ‚ÄúBro‚Ä¶ why do you have, like‚Ä¶ five different Ghostface masks?‚Äù

Izuku: ‚ÄúDifferent killers. I color-coded them based on how annoying they were.‚Äù

Red mask: The one who tried to kill him during lunch. Died by chopsticks.

Blue mask: Hid in a haunted Costco. Didn‚Äôt survive the forklift.

Green mask: Tried to prank call Izuku. Izuku traced the call, showed up at his house, and suplexed him through a coffee table.


Tsuyu: ‚ÄúWhy do you have Freddy Krueger‚Äôs claws?‚Äù

Izuku: ‚ÄúBecause he scratched my desk. Now he scratches the prison wall in Hell.‚Äù


---

Other Notable Trophies:

Jason‚Äôs machete, bent in half. Izuku used it to stir ramen.

Pennywise‚Äôs balloon, stuck to the ceiling with a knife through it. It still occasionally squeals.

A recording of the cursed Ring tape, labeled ‚ÄúWatched it. Beat her. Lame.‚Äù

Slenderman‚Äôs suit, hanging on a mannequin. The mannequin is bleeding. No one knows why.

A fully bound Annabelle doll, locked in a tiny cage surrounded by salt, holy water, laser tripwires, and a note that says ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt touch unless you want to explode.‚Äù

A polaroid wall of Izuku smiling next to each defeated villain like a tourist at Disneyland.

Caption: ‚ÄúMe & Freddy ‚Äì After I turned his face into brisket!‚Äù




---

Bakugo: ‚ÄúWhat the actual hell, nerd?! Are you even human?!‚Äù

Izuku (calmly polishing a silver stake): ‚ÄúNo. Not anymore.‚Äù

Iida (trembling): ‚ÄúMidoriya-kun‚Ä¶ this is highly concerning‚Äî‚Äù

Izuku: ‚ÄúTell that to the Babadook. Oh wait, you can‚Äôt.‚Äù

He points to a cracked hardcover book, framed with the title ""BA-BA-DOOK""‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs blood on it.

Conclusion:
Everyone agrees never to ask why Izuku looks tired anymore.

1jubfqf,https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder/comments/1jubfqf/april_recovery_challenge_day_8_check_in/,April Recovery Challenge Day 8 Check In,"Hello and welcome to Day 8 of the April Recovery Challenge, how are you?

Wishing you peace and progress today :)

# Today's check in:

What is something you can do to be kind to yourself today?

# Bonus exercise: an emergency kit

Do you have days where you just cannot for whatever reason? Can't muster the energy to cook the meal you planned to cook, had a bad day, didn't sleep the night before, got some really bad news, feel like crap, need to hide under a blankie or self-soothe big time? And is this a risk time for you to binge? An emergency kit might come in handy!

An emergency kit can be an actual box or basket full of things (and I've seen people really go to town with these and decorate them etc) or it can be as simple as a list on your phone, it's basically a ready-made action plan for when you really need some 10/10 comforting and self-soothing. Leaving decisions about 10/10 comforting to when you actually need it can potentially lead to unwanted outcomes (we've all been there!)!

Here are some things that could go in an emergency kit:

* a scented candle
* a comforting scented spray (bubblesandbooks)
* some nice crystals (slapstickanarchist)
* a notebook and pen to write out feelings
* a fidget spinner
* fairy lights (bubblesandbooks)
* play doh (zodiahck)
* a cozy blanket
* a comfortable outfit
   * anything fuzzy and cozy (bubblesandbooks)
   * some oversized sweats (MSH0123)
   * fuzzy socks (depressionkitten)
* some helpful media
   * a dvd or mp3 of your favourite movie of all time
   * christmas movies (maybe even a whole little christmas tree!) (bubblesandbooks)
   * a list of fun podcasts or comedy youtube channels
      * The Office Ladies (MSH0123)
* a note with a detailed take-out or order-in plan:
   * it's highly recommended to have a specific item already chosen from the menu, it can be hard to make good choices in an emergency
   * something from a place you haven't tried yet or wouldn't ordinarily get (MSH0123)
* some chewing gum (zodiahck)
* kept in the freezer:
   * a non-binge portion of a food that you love
   * a nice microwave meal (slapstickanarchist),
   * a comfort meal from childhood (bubblesandbooks)
* a single wrapped serving of a treat food
* a written list of friends to call
* positive, loving or encouraging notes to yourself
   * nice notes you've received from friends (guavatc)
   * remind yourself that this isn't permanent and you deserve good things (bubblesandbooks)
* some bubble bath or a single pack facial or foot wrap
* an unread issue of your favourite magazine
* a puzzle
   * something not too hard or time consuming, doable in a couple of hours, eg 100 piece (bubblesandbooks)
* a babysitter's phone number!
* a book of short stories (MSH0123)
* a variety of teas and flavored decaf coffees (MSH0123, Snowy\_lovegood)
* some theme night ideas to choose from
   * pick a letter of the alphabet and make a night out of it, eg the letter V: have Vietnamese food, play Video Games, and make cocktails with Vodka (MSH0123)
* something to cuddle
   * a squishmallow (depressionkitten)
   * a pet (depressionkitten)
* craft supplies
   * yarn (Snowy\_lovegood)
   * paint supplies (Snowy\_lovegood)
   * a colouring book and markers
   * any small easy crafts that can be completed within a few hours (Anybody\_Minimum)

Basically it's anything and everything to give yourself a maximum amount of soothing when you need it! It should include a normal, non-restrictive portion of food that you enjoy but also a range of other self-soothing items to go along with it. :)

**So the exercise is:**¬†Do you think an emergency kit could be helpful for you, and what do you think you would put in there? I will add any suggestions to the list :)

\----------------------------------

**WHAT IF I HAVE A SLIP DURING THE CHALLENGE?**

If you have a slip,¬†[here is a link to the slip debrief](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZhdjmzEVA6UTCNAEU53xn9LuN8TOfLbl/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=100257616608241708100&rtpof=true&sd=true), which can help to turn the symptom into a learning opportunity.¬†:)¬†

Hi everyone, I‚Äôm a 29 years old female and I‚Äôve been considered ugly or plain my whole life, and now I‚Äôd like to make myself a bit more attractive.

Here are my characteristics:

-A morphology ( pear shaped), small chest, big butts and thighs. I‚Äôm 5 feet and 50 kg, and I feel really fat even though I know my BMI is normal.

-very pale and thin skin with freckles, my complexion is not too fresh sometimes.

- ash brown and thin hair, to my shoulders. Green eyes but I find them a bit dull sometimes.

Now I need some advice on the following?

1. I don‚Äôt know which colours suit me, do you think I have more of a soft autumn or summer complexion? Gold looks definitely better than silver on me but brown and beige make me look so dull‚Ä¶ mustard is really my colour. 

2. I like using henna but I don‚Äôt know which hair colour would suit me? I‚Äôm thinking of a golden auburn? Or should I go for a colder shade? Or just leave it?

3. How can I naturally get rid of my nasolabial folds and double chin? 

4. I can I make my teeth whiter and stronger? They tend to be yellowish ( I brush them 3 times a day with a good electrical toothbrush and don‚Äôt drink coffee, I guess it‚Äôs just the quality of the enamel).

5. What kind of make up and haircut would look good on me?",2,1744111965.0,beauty,2,1.0,False

Chapter 1 Scandal At The Funeral  
""Iris, you're grown now‚Ä¶""  
  
The words were a hushed breath against Iris Curtis's ear, dark with longing. Heat seared through her, a tremor rippling down her spine.  
  
From the funeral home, the muted weeping of mourners could be heard.  
  
Pinned against the wooden railing in a gazebo behind the funeral home, Iris whimpered, her voice unsteady, ""Anyone could walk in...""  
  
The hem of her black, form-fitting dress rode up, her long legs brushing against the sharp fabric of Vincent Stewart's tailored trousers.  
  
......  
  
""Have you heard? At Caden Lambert's funeral yesterday, a pair of shameless lovers were making out at the gazebo behind the funeral home.""  
  
In a private suite on the second floor of Mellow Caf√©, Gretchen Higgins, a wealthy socialite, pressed a silk handkerchief to her lips as she leaned toward Bryanna Stewart, her expression curling with distaste.  
  
""Some playboy must've gotten tangled up with a slut. No shame, even in a funeral home,"" Bryanna scoffed, revulsion flashing in her eyes.  
  
Nothing disgusted her more than people who had a chaotic and depraved private life.  
  
""The surveillance footage is already being reviewed by the Lambert family. It won't be long before they find out,"" Gretchen added.  
  
Lost in thought, Iris jolted as coffee spilled onto the table.  
  
Bryanna's eyes flicked up. ""Iris, steady your hand while pouring the coffee.""  
  
Gretchen lifted her chin, her eyes settling on Iris with quiet scrutiny. ""Bryanna, you've raised her well--polite, poised. And most importantly, she never crosses the line.""  
  
Bryanna took a slow sip of coffee, satisfied. ""A woman's purity is her most valued virtue. For those from distinguished families, it matters even more.""  
  
The door to the suite groaned as it swung open. ""Mr. Stewart has arrived,"" someone announced.  
  
With her head lowered, Iris caught the gleam of impeccably polished leather shoes, the sharp lines of bespoke trousers--a portrait of quiet luxury.  
  
Vincent greeted Gretchen and Bryanna, his voice carried a smooth, measured depth.  
  
Bryanna, his sister-in-law, greeted him with a warm smile. ""You only got back yesterday and headed straight to Caden's funeral. Iris, did you see him there?""  
  
Heat rushed to Iris's face at the memory of last night's scandalous encounter. She still couldn't fathom why Vincent had suddenly lost control.  
  
The coffee carafe in her hand was blistering, yet she barely felt it.  
  
""No, we didn't cross paths,"" said Vincent.  
  
Vincent reached for the carafe, taking it from her grasp and pouring himself a cup leisurely.  
  
Her palm burned and flushed a furious shade of red.  
  
A man who commanded power with effortless authority--yet just as easily, he could deny their connection and carry on as if nothing had happened.  
  
Bryanna let out a light laugh. ""Iris has always been a bit wary of Vincent. And with him being overseas for the past seven years, the gap between them only grew wider.""  
  
Gretchen laughed lightly. ""That much is obvious. She looks like a mouse cornered by a cat--completely terrified.""  
  
Bryanna teased, ""Iris, there's no need to be scared of him. Perhaps it's time I find him a wife. Someone who can get him to drop that icy exterior and bring out his smile.""  
  
Gretchen placed her cup down. ""I heard Dolores Dawson is at Mellow Caf√© today.""  
  
Bryanna turned to Vincent. ""She's considering a connection through marriage with our family. What's your take on it?""  
  
Vincent took a sip of coffee, fingers resting lightly on the delicate porcelain cup. ""I'll let you handle it.""  
  
Iris lowered her head even further, her nails digging into her palm.",1,1744111895.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

1jub9o9,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1jub9o9/i_slept_with_by_brothers_girlfriend/,I slept with by brother's girlfriend.,"I know from the title alone people will rip to absolute shreds but before you start with the beating please try to see it from my pov. I know what I did was wrong and I shouldn't have but I feel like I am not entirely to be blamed for this situation but that's just me.

I will use fake names since I have people on my main account. I'll call myself Xavier M19 my brother Will  M30 and his Gf Kara F30. That was over the fact I was an unplanned pregnancy before my birth my family was happy but then I was born with very bad eczema skin condition. It was pretty obvious since my birth both my parents and Will found my condition absolutely disgusting. Will called me one thing a ""Disgusting Lizard"". I mostly just avoided them however school was pure hell. Everyone bullied me the teachers never called me up because they thought I wasn't pretty enough to do anything on a stage. I loved music as a kid I loved singing but I gave it up since they wouldn't let me sing. 

High school was the worst though. While everyone was enjoying life with their girlfriends I had nobody. I was lonely, they all thought I was disgusting. I honestly thought about just ending things I couldn't take anymore but didn't because I wanted to be better then Will in something. He was perfect, handsome, and incredibly smart and now he is still perfect a lawyer who has been dating Kara for 8 years. While me I was and to be honest am still pathetic. Still with my condition trying to get an engineering degree because other than music that was all I could do without completely hating it. I had no friends, no relationships and barely any contact with my family. I am in college but decided to come back home because I didn't have anywhere else to go for break. 

That's when I met Kara. She had been dating my brother for 8 years when I met her. I had never met her before since we barely talked I hadn't even seen her. When I came home I saw her for the first time and she was really pretty. I didn't expect much to be honest I had never gotten any attention from women before all of them either avoided me or were disgusted by me. But she was different. To give you an idea on how she was different here's the reasons.

Most of my talk with people in my town was either extremely awkward or horrible. Our town is the stereotypical town. Homophobic, transphobic somewhat racist towards people like me with skin conditions. They were basically either polite but really uncomfortable or down right disgusted. Kara however treated me with respect she was polite and even apon learning of my condition she wasn't disgusted. She actually told me about her brother who also had it. She treated me with kindness and we started to hang out. My brother however was pissed at us. He constantly disrupted our gaming sessions or just us cooking since we both enjoyed it. I asked Kara whether this was normal and she said yes. She told me about how he was controlling he didn't allow her to see other male friends and some female friends. Her simply being polite to male waiters sent him off. He would accuse him of ""flirting"" with them even though she only said stuff like ""the coffee was great."" or ""you're a really good waiter."" I know this sounds like I am trying to paint him in a bad light no I am just saying the facts. He at least was financially responsible spilling the rent, keeping the house clean and buying his own groceries and more. I admit financially he is a great partner but emotionally no. I had actually posted this before on another sub-redidit before the following paragraph but instead of advice all I was told was how my story is fake and all that. So if you have any advice or criticism for me just say it so don't waste either your or my time by saying this is fake because I really wouldn't even bother with you.

Okay now on to what happened. Me and Kara went to the gym together. She had motivated me to get into shape since I was slightly overweight and I got into decent shape. After our workout was done we met and started to chat where she opened up about some things about my family. My parents have been pressuring her to have kids even though she doesn't want them. She said that she might just leave my brother. Speaking of him he has been a lot of controlling he constantly scoops her phone and if she even has a man's number he implodes on her. After she said this I was comforting her by talking about random things like cooking and random TV shows. Now she was feeling better and she started to talk about Law and order but I wasn't really focusing she was in a sports bra and tits were visible and I was staring at them directly. I guess she got me staring cause she looked me in the eyes and said ""You want a squeeze?"" She asked me. I was completely flabbergasted I hadn't even ever gotten a kiss before. I ended up squeezing her tits. Then she kissed me then I felt my pants being pulled down then she ended up riding my dick. That happened when I was 18 and she was 29. They ended up breaking up of course my family thought it was my fault. Kara and I only had sex a couple of more times before we found out that we didn't love each other we did what we did just because of our shared resentment for my family. I thought about the situation after finding a group for me. I am still in college trying to get a degree. I just thought about posting this.

1jub9ms,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1jub9ms/my_own_recipe/,"My ""own"" recipe","Couple months of trying all kinds of methods and could not find results that I liked and were consistently reproducible. Recently, I went from 4:6 method to three pour style inspired Rao/gagne etc and was amazed. This seems to work for me with light roasted naturals and washed beans, and even some random supermarket beans with only small adjustments. For me, it was important to quantify all variables for easy reproduction. Most recipes tend to leave some info out, lile stating ""let draw down for a while before pourong more"", which is not helpful for a beginner, while I understand more experienced barista works by feel.

I am using the kingrinder k6 at 77 (+-3) clicks. Adjustment goes down to -5, but burrs already touch at -1, therefore I start click count at 0.

Tap water with no alterations. Hardness 3.0dh, or 0.53 mmol/l. Water temp usually 100c, might drop down to 95c for older Or darker beans.

21g coffee for 350g water.
60g bloom for 45sec, usually with a swirl
Pour for 30sec, up to 210g total (5g/s).
Pause for 15sec
Pour for 30sec, up to 350g total (5g/s)
Pause for 10sec and swirl
Total brew time usually 3.00-3.15min

Both pours are high agitation, just before the stream breaks.

This recipe seems to reduce in a full-bodied and balanced cup with some acidity and sweetness. I would like my cup a bit more bright and clear, but this seems to be at a good place right now.

Shin‚Äôichi Yamamoto meets ‚ÄúTaeko Goodman,‚Äù a member from Montana who had introduced 10 families from her community to the Soka Gakkai while still struggling with severe homesickness.","Montana? I feel like a Montanan after watching 1883, 1923 *(Ouch, the painful series finale last night!!!)*, and Yellowstone! 

Yesterday we were all focused on the audit and I could not do anything to support Longhouse Elem. But Bernie and Artie went and visited some more families of prospective 2nd graders. It seems that Artie had developed his own PowerPoint about Longhouse Elem to show to families! (Thank you, Artie!) Two families signed up and wrote checks as deposits!

>[Shin‚Äôichi] sensed that, scattered throughout this vast land of America, friends were beginning to ‚Äúemerge from the earth‚Äù‚Äîfriends who would lead lives dedicated to the mission of propagating the True Law far and wide. The time of worldwide kosen-rufu had truly arrived.‚Äù

I can‚Äôt explain any other way how to describe my joy when Bernie texted me that two more families joined the Longhouse Elem family. I was delighted about the families and can‚Äôt wait to meet the children. But more amazing to me was that Bernie and Artie had understood and communicated the profound mission of the school. It‚Äôs not just about me; I am the pipeline through which the spirit of Longhouse Elem is transmitted. Relax and be confident, Director Guy Schmidt! Others who understand are appearing!

There‚Äôs another point in the chapter that resonated with me. Taeko Goodman had driven all night to meet Shin‚Äôichi. She got lost in Seattle, could only find parking far away, and had to lug this heavy tape recorder while trying to walk on the high heeled shoes she was wearing. In her mind she was also struggling between her desire to move back to Japan and her commitment to take care of the people in Montana she had introduced to Buddhism.

>‚ÄúThere is nothing more praiseworthy than a person who strives earnestly for others.‚Äù The moment she heard Shin‚Äôichi say this, emotion and determination welled up inside her. ‚ÄúI will strive here, in America,‚Äù she vowed in her heart, ‚Äúfor those who have placed their trust in me and started practicing Nichiren Buddhism.‚Äù

This pierced my heart. These families have placed their trust in me. Who cares whether I am capable or not capable? I just need to strive earnestly on their behalf!

Sensei states:

>Human brilliance derives from the light of altruistic action. It is not an exaggeration to say that people are truly human only when they endeavor to dedicate their lives for their friends and fellow human beings. Here, too, lies the way to break through the shell of the small ego and develop and expand one‚Äôs spiritual capacity to a profound degree. 

I get it, I had it all wrong. It‚Äôs not that I first break through the shell of my small ego‚Äîand then build the school. Just the opposite: the *reward* from making Longhouse Elem the best school in America is breaking through the shell that has restricted me in my 30 years.

The Fam is munching over Cheerios, bacon and eggs, and steaming coffee. There is a feeling of, is the word ‚Äúcertitude‚Äù?, after such a successful audit yesterday.

Quite embarrassed to talk so candidly about myself but here goes.

I'm 39F. 5ft6 and weigh 300lbs.

Had a bad couple of years after break-up/business loss etc... and my weight increased significantly (always been big but around 17.5 stone is average prior to this).

Anyway, l've got myself back in to a better mental position, new house, new job. Wanted to follow this by getting in better shape. And so on the 1st of March I bought a treadmill.

Before I was walking around 40km a month (work from home, barely go out). Last month I got that to 100km a month using the walk pad. This month l've started adding in outdoor walks too, with the aim to get to 150km.

I've set a calorie deficit and eating 1700 cal a day. Also drinking 2L water (green tea/tea also included) and limiting to one black coffee per day.

I've been sticking to this for a month and my weight has not changed (fluctuates between 300 and 295 pounds each day) apart from 3lbs (started at 303).

What am I doing wrong?

I have been measured myself and down all over (5cm on stomach is best result, 2.5cm on each calf for example) but the scale is simply not moving and it's really disheartening.

Can anyone give me some advice?",5,1744111563.0,loseit,3,1.0,False

I‚Äôm a service manager at a mechanic shop. I‚Äôm in my early 20s and work with other men in their 50‚Äôs and 60s. Or a few teenage kids in high school. So already I feel alienated. 

My co worker [early 60s M] who I‚Äôll call ‚ÄúTim‚Äù in this story is a mechanic originally born in chile. He had an accident and died for minutes and then found the lord after years of drinking. Being an asshole. Doing drugs. He started being involved in the church shortly before I worked here. He has a reputation for being an ah and kind of narcissistic about his mechanical abilities. His ego is his greatest cause for the mistakes he makes at the job. 

I‚Äôve worked here for 3 years now and I‚Äôve watched him slowly get sucked into a religious cult. We live outside of nyc and his ‚Äúchurch‚Äù is there. I think it‚Äôs a charismatic or evangelical type. But nothing I‚Äôve seen or heard before. 

Not only do his ‚Äúpastors‚Äù call him up and beg for Zelle payments, but he tells us all about his church and what kind of things they do. People in the church aren‚Äôt allowed to talk to the different sex alone. 

Tim is a severe diabetic and also is a far right conspiracy theorist anti medicine type of dude too. His diet is absolutely strange. 

He will say he fasts for a week at a time. He drinks a pint of heavy cream a day with multiple cups of coffee. (Our boss supplies the milk and cream and coffee and he runs with it) He will drink pine needles tea. Other things he thinks will regulate his diabetes. He‚Äôs fainted once. Started having an episode where he screamed and would touch the ground and get up like he was doing burpies. And then said it was because of a spirit afterwards. My boss almost called the ambulance. 

I saw a video from his church YouTube where they encouraged a woman with schizophrenia to throw her meds in the ‚Äúwitchcraft pile‚Äù and chant while she shakes the evil sprits out of herself. 

 He tries to regulate his blood sugar on his own. He doesn‚Äôt trust doctors. He a pompous arrogant man to begin with. But the church has made him believe that his diabetic hallucinations are visions from Christ. He‚Äôs told me he would stay up until 3am to pray. 

He talks about witchcraft all the time. How his church fights it. He won‚Äôt eat chicken because they‚Äôre used for witchcraft. How he can see these spirits and demons in people. 

He believes demons come in the form of animals. Gorillas, apes, bugs, and will see peoples face morph into them. He‚Äôs accused his daughter of using witchcraft because she‚Äôs apparently ‚Äúwoke‚Äù he said god gave him a dream of wasps and read about it in the Bible. Then when he saw his daughter he said he saw her face morph and grow swollen like she was stung by a million bees. 

This dude is everything people stereotype about conservatives. But it‚Äôs with religion. He will take off of work for ‚Äúdeliverances‚Äù across the country. He came back saying that he had 4 demons in him. 

The other week, he ditched work to drive down south to save a church friends daughter from ‚Äúbeing kidnapped‚Äù which come to find out, was in a ‚Äúspiritual sense‚Äù 

He calls women jezebells. Claims that dozens of women (some even as young as 20) in his church throw themselves at him. Which I highly doubt. Every week another woman in his church are having issues and beef with him. ",2,1744111285.0,whatdoIdo,5,0.75,False

A few examples of jealousy episodes; 

\- during a weekend city break, I left a google review to a barista at a coffee shop because she game me free tea ( I was buying the tea for a homeless man who found my hat on street ). Comment said ""Lovely barista, and good coffee"". My gf somehow saw the comment and was quite jealous. It took me a while to calm her down.

\- My best friend is female and she had bought concert tickets for my last birthday ( this was before I met my gf ). The concert is coming up and my gf wants to come with but no tickets left. My gf asked me a few tiems to to get the tickets from my best friend so that I can go with my gf rather than my best friend. I ofcourse told her this is very rude and that I will not ask my best friend to give the tickets away... gf is now asking if I will go to this concert knowing that she will be very upset if I go without her  
\- My gf lives in a shared accommodation with other girls in central london. Whenever I go to stay over at hers, I have the usual chit chat with her housemates, however this is also making her jealous as she mentioned that she is not comfortable with me speaking to them so much... I am  quite aproachable, chatty guy, comfortable at small talk in general...

\-she asked a few time to have access my doorbell camera, which I declined of course...
  
There are other examples as you can imagine. My question is has anyone overcome jealously at this level or know others who has overcome. My concern is that she will stop me from going on my mountain biking or climbing trips if there are other girls in the group, and limit my life in general. I don't have much time to lose (36M) as I want to start a family, looking for also general opinion on whether this is worth pursuing for me as this could make my life a misery if things get worse with jealousy.

I‚Äôm 39F. 5ft6 and weigh 300lbs. 

Had a bad couple of years after break-up/business loss etc‚Ä¶ and my weight increased significantly (always been big but around 17.5 stone is average prior to this). 

Anyway, I‚Äôve got myself back in to a better mental position, new house, new job. Wanted to follow this by getting in better shape. And so on the 1st of March I bought a treadmill. 

Before I was walking around 40km a month (work from home, barely go out). Last month I got that to 100km a month using the walk pad. This month I‚Äôve started adding in outdoor walks too, with the aim to get to 150km. 

I‚Äôve set a calorie deficit and eating 1700 cal a day. Also drinking 2L water (green tea/tea also included) and limiting to one black coffee per day. 

I‚Äôve been sticking to this for a month and my weight has not changed (fluctuates between 300 and 295 pounds each day) apart from 3lbs (started at 303). 

What am I doing wrong? 

I have been measured myself and down all over (5cm on stomach is best result, 2.5cm on each calf for example) but the scale is simply not moving and it‚Äôs really disheartening.

So I just read about these two women who both got scammed by thinking they were dating Brad Pitt and Keanu Reeves. Now I know this sounds unreal, but come on, how could anyone fall for that?

I thought the same thing: how could you possibly give a stranger you never even talked to on the phone, that says he's Brad Pitt, 830,000 pounds or around 830,000 dollars? That is just insane. 
Another woman thought she was dating Keanu Reeves and gave him thousands of dollars before she found out she was being scammed. 

I'm a New Yorker, I don't trust anyone so for me this is unbelievable. Besides the fact that I would never give any man real or not, any of my hard-earned money. Oh hell no! If you have to ask a woman for money, what kind of man are you? Definitely not a man for me that's for sure.
But then I am not desperate for a man either. When people are desperate they do things they would never normally do. These women wanted someone to love them, so badly that even when they felt or saw red flags they still pursued this ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù 

I always say that I would like a man in my life but I do not need one in my life. I am okay by myself. I like myself, my time alone, my life with my girls and my friends. I have interests and my church, my life is full. I would never allow some man into my life just because I was lonely. 

Would I like someone to share my life? Yes, but I will not be blinded by bullshit or love bombing.  I see the red flags right away and I am out of there. I have more years behind me than in front of me and I will not waste one moment on some time-wasting man. We will text, we will talk on the phone and then we will meet all in a short time. I will not date anyone in another city or definitely not another county. No, you better live here, and if we are not meeting even just for coffee then boy bye. Next!! 

So today my friends remember when you are desperate you allow things that you wouldn't normally allow. You can't be desperate. You can't ignore the red flags and trust me there were many red flags in these two cases. You have to be complete, so complete yourself. Find hobbies, go out with friends, or make new friends. Explore yourself and what you like to do. Be fulfilled by being by yourself but don't get taken in by these scammers because you're desperate.
You're worth more than that.

1juaw1z,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1juaw1z,Public transportation problem,"Hello fellow mayors of Cities: Skylines,

So‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve been on a noble mission: building a city with zero traffic and a public transport system so smooth, even the Swiss would be jealous. Sounds dreamy, right? Well, reality hit me harder than a traffic jam at a six-way roundabout.

Here‚Äôs the deal ‚Äî I‚Äôve got thousands of citizens desperately trying to hop on buses and metros, but instead of moving, they just kinda... vibe at the stops. Forever. Like it‚Äôs some weird urban ritual.

Now, I did buff up the capacity of buses and metros using a mod ‚Äî made them absolute people-hauling beasts ‚Äî but that didn‚Äôt solve the issue. And before anyone blames the mods: nope, same mess happens in vanilla too. I even installed a bunch of ‚Äúplease fix this madness‚Äù mods, but the chaos lives on.

After some late-night Google archaeology, I discovered the culprit: the game‚Äôs boarding logic. Apparently, when a bus pulls up, it makes a VIP list of who‚Äôs getting on ‚Äî and won‚Äôt leave until every single person on that list boards. Even if there‚Äôs one guy left who's still casually strolling across the park three blocks away, the bus just chills there. Full on 79/80 passengers. Waiting. Forever. For *Dave*.

Meanwhile, traffic backs up, buses pile in, metros gridlock, and my dreams of a clean, efficient city spiral into smoky, honking doom ‚Äî all thanks to one slow citizen who‚Äôs probably stopping for coffee on the way to the stop.

So here‚Äôs my question: has anyone made a mod that makes buses and metros pick up whoever‚Äôs closest and just *go*? Like, sorry Dave, you‚Äôre late ‚Äî catch the next one.

Thanks in advance, and may your traffic always flow like water. üöçüí®",3,1744110389.0,CitiesSkylines2,2,1.0,False

The day Joong, in all his glory, proved just how much he values his fandom. And, no, it wasn‚Äôt in a ‚ÄúI‚Äôm too busy‚Äù way ‚Äì it was in the you‚Äôre-not-even-worth-it way. Yesterday, folks, was supposed to be the grand celebration of Joong‚Äôs fandom‚Äôs anniversary. A momentous occasion, right? The fans had waited all year, heart in hand, for Joong to acknowledge their existence. They had hope, they had faith. Maybe even too much hope, but let‚Äôs be real, it‚Äôs cute when you still believe in fairy tales at 23.


Twitter threads(I‚Äôm lazy sorry) : 

1.	So‚Ä¶ yesterday was the anniversary of the sacred CP, DungJangs .
And Jung? Absolute silence. No post. Not even a recycled story.
Fans? Losing their minds like it‚Äôs a Taylor Swift breakup era.


Obviously, we needed a villain. Guess who? Est. Because it‚Äôs always Est.
	2.	‚ÄúIt‚Äôs because of Est that Jung forgot the anniversary!‚Äù
‚ÄúJasper stole his attention!‚Äù
Even Jung‚Äôs little sister got dragged because she didn‚Äôt scream ‚ÄúHappy Broday Dunky‚Äù online.
Truly‚Ä¶ elite levels of fandom delusion.
	3.	The result?
Jung posts a letter the next day.
Interpretation? Harassment works.
But of course, he gave us the classic:
‚ÄúI wrote everything yesterday, but‚Ä¶ I accidentally deleted it while copy-pasting.‚Äù
Sure. And I accidentally adopted a dog and named it after my ex too.
	4.	And what‚Äôs inside the letter?
Hearts. ‚ÄúI want you to be my future.‚Äù
But the best part? ‚ÄúNo girlfriend. Only bros.‚Äù
The BRO. The sacred word.
Jung could tattoo ‚ÄúBRO‚Äù across his forehead and they‚Äôd still be like, ‚ÄúSee? He‚Äôs trying to hide his feelings.‚Äù
	5.	Friendly reminder:
Someone who doesn‚Äôt talk to you for 4 days, who only replies to plug their brand?
That‚Äôs not your soulmate. That‚Äôs your marketing partner. Calm down.
	6.	But the fans?
Grateful.
Emotional.
Posting ‚Äúwe‚Äôre crying‚Äù GIFs.
As if that letter wasn‚Äôt a damage control note to protect Est, Jasper, and Jung‚Äôs poor little sister from your chaos.
	7.	And even with the ‚Äúbro‚Äù label repeated five times, they still go:

‚ÄúOmg he said he wants to bake cakes with Dunk, they‚Äôre in love!!‚Äù
Girl. He‚Äôd bake cakes with a microwave if it looked at him the right way.

	8.	So yeah.
You harass someone into posting a vague letter with fanservice sprinkles‚Ä¶
Then clap like seals because you think you‚Äôve uncovered true love?
That‚Äôs not romance.
That‚Äôs corporate gaslighting with glitter.

But what did Joong do? NOTHING. Well, no, that‚Äôs not true. He did post. A lot. He posted and reposted his moments. He was online, replying, interacting, being all‚Ä¶ engaged. But the ONE THING he didn‚Äôt do was wish his fandom a happy anniversary. The one thing that mattered the most. He literally went out of his way to show everyone he couldn‚Äôt care less. And don‚Äôt come at me with ‚Äúmaybe he just forgot‚Äù or ‚Äúhe‚Äôs too busy.‚Äù The man was online, posting like it was his job ‚Äì which, spoiler alert, it is. But he couldn‚Äôt take five seconds to acknowledge his fans.

But wait, there‚Äôs more. Is it a coincidence that he was extra active yesterday, just to intentionally NOT post for the anniversary? Nope. Why? Well, the timeline of events doesn‚Äôt lie. The one time he posts like a madman happens to coincide with the fact that he was supposed to acknowledge the fans who have been feeding his career. Do you see the passive-aggressive genius here? Oh, and here‚Äôs the cherry on top: he even posted a long-ass ‚Äúthank you‚Äù message to ‚Äúbro‚Äù ‚Äì his agent, maybe?

Oh, and don‚Äôt even get me started on his love letter for the fans. The one where he says, ‚ÄúI want you to be my future,‚Äù then in the next breath says, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have a partner, just bro.‚Äù Sure, Joong. Sure. Keep that sweet fanservice flowing. But let‚Äôs not be too obvious about it. If you squint hard enough, you‚Äôll realize that Joong is saying one thing while meaning another. A love letter wrapped in sarcasm and carelessness.

‚ÄúI wrote everything on my mind in the Notes app. It was very long. I was planning to thank everyone and bro (the famous ‚Äúbro‚Äù). But when I copied and pasted, I accidentally deleted everything. The text disappeared in the blink of an eye. Hahaha.

But to summarize what I had written:
I love everyone very much, you‚Äôre all so adorable.
I don‚Äôt have a partner, I just have bro.
There were some deep quotes, an unfinished song,
the sweetness of a letter, everything I‚Äôve drawn,
‚ÄòI want you to be my future‚Äô,
moments in the kitchen, cakes,
past concerts and those to come,
places I want to take you,
things I want to do with you.‚Äù

‚∏ª

And now, for the ultimate betrayal: The Notes app.

Oh, Joong. Really? The Notes app? You should have known better. Listen, I get it ‚Äì sometimes you need a little help crafting your image, and what better way than to use the classic ‚ÄúOops, my phone deleted my beautiful message‚Äù trick? But guess what? Apple‚Äôs iPhone is a sneaky little thing ‚Äì when you accidentally delete a note, there‚Äôs a function called ‚Äúshake to undo.‚Äù That‚Äôs right. SHAKE your phone, and it pops back up. No, Joong, it‚Äôs not a magic trick. It‚Äôs technology. A simple undo. Oh, and even if you don‚Äôt shake it, there‚Äôs this thing called ‚Äúrecently deleted‚Äù where your notes linger, like a bad memory you can‚Äôt quite get rid of.

So yeah, when Joong tries to tell us he lost his message‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sorry, honey. You don‚Äôt just ‚Äúlose‚Äù something on iPhone. That‚Äôs like saying you accidentally deleted your entire life on Facebook and, oops, it‚Äôs gone forever. Nice try, though. But guess what? You didn‚Äôt fool us. You lied. And you can‚Äôt even pretend it was an accident anymore. We all know.



‚∏ª But wait ‚Äì let‚Äôs talk about Jung. Oh yes, Jung, the very same guy who now doesn‚Äôt like Dunk‚Äôs posts on Instagram anymore. Do you see what‚Äôs happening here? They haven‚Äôt even talked in FOUR DAYS! Can you imagine? Not a single word. Not even a ‚ÄúHey, happy anniversary!‚Äù So, while Joong is busy being ‚Äúactive‚Äù online, guess what? He‚Äôs not even talking to his so-called ‚Äúbro,‚Äù Dunk. The communication is as dead as their ship,

Let‚Äôs be real here. Joong isn‚Äôt even in the fandom game anymore. He‚Äôs out. He‚Äôs been out. And this is just his subtle (and not so subtle) way of saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm done. You guys are on your own now.‚Äù And frankly, it‚Äôs kind of hilarious to watch. The whole Joongdunk ship is crumbling faster than we can get a decent picture of them together. And yet, the fans keep trying to hold on to that sliver of hope, clinging to Joong‚Äôs every action like it‚Äôs some kind of lifeline. But let‚Äôs face it, the ship is sinking, and Joong‚Äôs just sitting there, casually sipping his iced coffee and scrolling through Twitter, not giving a damn about the hull breaking apart.

So, to all the fans still hanging on: It‚Äôs time to let go. Stop pretending. Stop acting like this ship is anything other than a fantasy. Because guess what? Joong‚Äôs been trying to tell you for a while now, but you just don‚Äôt want to hear it.

If you‚Äôre still stuck in this delusion, let me help you out:
	‚Ä¢	The ‚Äúhappy anniversary‚Äù post? Was never coming.
	‚Ä¢	The ‚Äúlove letter‚Äù? Written by a team, not Joong.
	‚Ä¢	The Notes app incident? Joong straight-up lied about it.
	‚Ä¢	Joong‚Äôs ‚Äúactivity‚Äù? Just enough to make you think he cares, but not enough to actually prove he does.

Here‚Äôs the kicker, though ‚Äì fans are so busy crying over Joong‚Äôs lack of acknowledgment for the anniversary (because, of course, that‚Äôs what‚Äôs really important), but how many of you have actually done something to support Dunk‚Äôs business? How many of you are buying his products, sharing his brand, or giving him the support he deserves as a business owner? Nope. That‚Äôs not your priority, is it? But you‚Äôll cry about Joong not posting on time. Got it. It‚Äôs just a classic case of ‚Äúwe want to be fed,‚Äù but we won‚Äôt lift a finger to help anyone who‚Äôs actually trying to make a living.

So here‚Äôs a challenge, fans ‚Äì stop supporting these people for their imaginary love story and start supporting them individually, like you claim you want to. Dunk has his business, Joong has his career, and they both need support for what they do. If you really want to help, stop pretending to care about their nonexistent relationship and start putting your energy into something real ‚Äì like actually helping Dunk sell his products. Because guess what? He won‚Äôt get anywhere with your hollow ‚Äúshipping‚Äù support if it doesn‚Äôt translate into real-life sales.

‚∏ª

So, to sum up everything:
	‚Ä¢	Joong and Dunk? The ‚Äúbros‚Äù who don‚Äôt even talk to each other.
	‚Ä¢	The anniversary? Didn‚Äôt matter to them.
	‚Ä¢	The Note app incident? Cute try, Joong, but your ‚Äúaccident‚Äù is not fooling anyone.
	‚Ä¢	Support? Only if it involves plugging Dunk‚Äôs brand.
	‚Ä¢	Fans? Stop pretending to care about their love story and start actually supporting them for what they‚Äôre doing, not for what you wish they were doing.

‚∏ª

In conclusion:
The ‚ÄúJoongDunk‚Äù ship isn‚Äôt sinking ‚Äì it‚Äôs already gone under. Let it go, and support them for who they are, not for who you want them to be. Stop investing in illusions, and start supporting Dunk‚Äôs business if you truly care. Otherwise, you‚Äôre just feeding into a fantasy that even they don‚Äôt care about anymore. #BrosNotBoyfriends

So yeah, to all the fans out there‚Ä¶
The Joongdunk ship isn‚Äôt just sinking, it‚Äôs being deliberately scuttled by Joong himself. So maybe, just maybe, it‚Äôs time to stop pretending that this ship is anything more than a dream. Let it sink. Move on. It‚Äôs over.",2,1744109990.0,JoongEstPlanet,1,1.0,False
1juar83,https://www.reddit.com/r/NCLEXsuccessStories/comments/1juar83/resilencedetermination_and_triumph_in_my_nclex/,"Resilence,determination and triumph in my NCLEX journey after several setbacks","This success story is all about resilience, determination, and triumph after multiple setbacks. This about my NCLEX success story.

The NCLEX was never just a test for me, it was the mountain I had to climb to prove I could turn my dream of becoming a nurse into reality. But that mountain felt insurmountable at times, especially after stumbling not once, but twice, before finally reaching the summit. My story isn‚Äôt a straight line of success, it‚Äôs a messy, gritty tale of setbacks that tested my resolve and a determination that refused to let me quit.

It started after nursing school, a whirlwind of late-night study sessions, clinical rotations, and a quiet pride when I walked across that graduation stage. I thought I was ready for the NCLEX RN. For my first attempt, I leaned on what had gotten me through school: my notes, a stack of flashcards, and a free online question bank. I studied hard, but not smart, cramming without a clear plan. Walking into the testing center, I felt a knot in my stomach, but I told myself I‚Äôd power through. The questions came fast, and my confidence unraveled faster. At 150 questions, the computer shut off, and I left feeling like I‚Äôd been hit by a truck. The result? Failed. I remember sitting in my car afterward, staring at the steering wheel, wondering if I‚Äôd ever be good enough.

That failure stung, but I dusted myself off and tried again. This time, I borrowed a review book to be specific Uworld from a friend and spent weeks poring over it. I thought I‚Äôd cracked the code, focus on content, memorize everything. Attempt number two felt better; I even got a few of those tricky ‚Äúselect all that apply‚Äù questions, which I‚Äôd heard could mean you‚Äôre on the right track. The screen went blank at 100 questions, and I dared to hope. But when the results came, it was another gut punch: failed again. Two strikes, and I was drowning in self doubt.
 Friends were passing, starting jobs, while I was stuck, questioning if nursing was even meant for me.

Those setbacks could‚Äôve broken me, but something inside wouldn‚Äôt let go. I‚Äôd come too far‚Äîyears of school, sleepless nights, sacrifices‚Äîto walk away. So, I got stubborn. I decided the NCLEX wasn‚Äôt going to define me; I was going to define it. For my third attempt, I changed everything. I scraped together money for a structured NCLEX preparation course, one with adaptive practice tests that mirrored the real exam; The Naxlex Qbank! No more guessing, I needed strategy. I learned to stop obsessing over what I didn‚Äôt know and started mastering why answers were right or wrong. Pharmacology, delegation, infection control, I drilled them until they stuck.
The bigger battle was in my head. Test anxiety had sabotaged me twice, so I fought back with new weapons: meditation to calm my racing thoughts, I did  RAT  and CATs in Naxlex Qbank to build stamina, and a mantra. Something just whispered to me I did RAT 8 and 9 twice  because I had not scored so good and I didn't understand why I was scoring just high,I wanted very high ratings to get the confidence that I was looking for. I whispered daily: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve survived worse. You‚Äôll survive this.‚Äù My family became my cheerleaders‚Äîmy sister quizzed me over coffee, my parents left encouraging notes. Every practice score that crept higher fueled my fire.

When the third test day arrived, I walked in different, nervous, sure, but grounded. I‚Äôd faced this beast before and lived to tell the tale. The questions rolled out, and I tackled them one by one, refusing to let panic take the wheel. I read every question twice before I went to options given, then after getting the answer I went back to the question to confirm why that answer suits the bill. To be precise I encountered 3-4 case studies that had gone through in RAT 8&9 At question 85, the screen went dark. My heart stopped. Had I bombed again, or was this it? The wait for results was torture; two days of pacing, praying, and replaying every click in my mind.

Then, the moment: I logged in, hands shaking, and saw it RN‚Äù next to my name. I‚Äôd passed. Tears hit the keyboard as triumph washed over me. Those failures? They weren‚Äôt the end; they were the forge that made me stronger. Resilience carried me through the dark days, determination rebuilt me after each fall, and that third try was my victory lap.
Now, as I step into my nursing career, I carry those lessons with me. The NCLEX didn‚Äôt just give me a license, it gave me proof that I could rise above any setback. I‚Äôm not just a nurse; I‚Äôm a fighter who turned stumbles into strides. For me this is  a testament to how resilience and determination can transform setbacks into a powerful triumph.
Special mention to Naxlex Qbank for giving me the confidence that pushed me to my victory lap in the 3rd attempt of my NCLEX journey.",28,1744109921.0,NCLEXsuccessStories,22,1.0,False

Yes that is right, Kendu is going to the Florida grove festival in Orlando on the 12-13th April. We have successfully managed to raise $5000 with $1000 donated by StaySeaArt so massive thanks to her. The rest of it was raised through OTC trades or donations.

The familiar face of Kendu will forever be etched into the attendees minds and we can gain a lot of holders through this event.

10-15k people will be attending this event over the 2 days which is crazy, Kendu will be handing Kendu Energy out, making a mural and we will have a tent.

Massive shoutout to StaySeaArt and the Kendu street team for their amazing efforts. This will be the 3rd Florida Festival in 6 months!!!

This is another addition to Kendu‚Äôs game changing IRL success.

**Why IRL alpha is important**

IRL alpha is important because it cannot be faked. Whilst memes, tweets, reddit posts( not this one) and whatever else can be faked. IRL products and events cannot be. Crypto isn‚Äôt the most trusted space in the world so the fact we have IRL content is massively important for retail investors.

As AI use increases globally, IRL alpha will be the most crucial for investors by far

**What has Kendu achieved/got:**

18k holders

50k certik votes, only other coin to ever achieve this is Pepe.

283 million ATH market cap

Extremely active telegram and social media scores

A rating on certik¬†

International community¬†

**IRL events/products**

Kendu has many IRL products: Kendu Energy, Kendu Coffee, Kendu Merch, Kendu animation, Kendu games, Kendu Gum, Kendu Creator, Kendu pendants, Kendu Beer, Kendu Video Games and Kendu Games.

Kendu was at Miami Art Basel, NoSleep305 was present and even created a Kendu Mural in a very busy part of Miami  
Kendu Entertainment(ran by Ishan) is hosting Pickleball events in India, which is a very popular sport in India. This is gathering lots of traction in the Pickleball community and has been a great success so far. 

Kendu was very recently at Miami Music Week, where we have given a few thousand energy drinks out, Kendu cocktails(cocktails made with Kendu Energy) and merch.

**Some Thoughts**

Kendu is around 10 million market cap, with social media dominance that is nearly unparalleled, with telegram activity that is off the charts. In addition, Kendu also has IRL alpha that has never ever been seen before. Kendu is going to the billions and I believe we will set the memecoin standard for the future. There is no doubt in my mind that we will see ""How ..... is the Kendu of 2029"", people will see Kendu as a benchmark and they will try and match us.

My advice to you is to join the Kendu telegram and just hang around, you don't have to buy Kendu, but I think you will see how different Kendu is to the rest of the competition. Any questions are always welcome, just ask in the telegram or our subreddit r/KenduInu_Ecosystem.

This is strictly my opinion and is not financial advice but I think Kendu can 1000-3000x this cycle. Yes maybe I am deluded but I truly believe that we are at the foot of one of the best financial opportunities available this decade.

If Shib can do a 1000x in 36 days(from 22 million to 22 billion), with less money and less understanding of the potential of a strong memecoin, I think Kendu can match this.  
Kendu is organic and has an incredible community  just like Shib, Doge and Pepe, these 3 have proven that community is the deciding factor in a memecoin and that is all that matters. 

Kendu belongs in the memecoin hall of fame with them 3 and we will get there, there is no doubt in my mind. Kendu belongs in the billions and the community deserves it for sure.

The Art of Dessert Pairing: How to Enhance Your Romantic Evenings with Sweet Treats
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creating the perfect romantic evening is all about the right atmosphere, thoughtful gestures, and, of course, delightful desserts. Pairing your sweet treats can enhance flavors and create memorable moments, making any evening truly special. Here are some ideas to inspire your dessert pairing endeavors.

### Chocolate and Red Wine

Nothing says romance quite like chocolate and red wine. The rich, deep flavors of dark chocolate pair beautifully with a robust red wine. This duo can create a luxurious experience that feels indulgent. You can enjoy dark chocolate truffles with a glass of Merlot or Cabernet Sauvignon. The tannins in the wine will beautifully complement the sweetness of the chocolate, making every bite and sip a decadent delight.

### Vanilla Ice Cream with Fresh Berries

If you are looking for a lighter option, consider pairing vanilla ice cream with fresh berries. This combination is fresh, vibrant, and visually appealing. To bring this pairing to life, scoop some creamy vanilla ice cream into a dish and top it generously with strawberries, blueberries, or raspberries. The sweetness of the ice cream balances the tartness of the berries, creating a refreshing contrast that will tantalize your taste buds.

#### Enhancing the Experience

- **Add Mint Leaves:** Garnish your dessert with mint leaves for a pop of color and a refreshing flavor.
- **Drape with Chocolate Sauce:** A drizzle of chocolate sauce can elevate your dish and enhance its visual appeal.
- **Serve with Whipped Cream:** A dollop of whipped cream on top adds creaminess and takes your pairing to the next level.

### Cheesecake and Coffee

The combination of cheesecake and a warm cup of coffee can be an ideal choice for those late-night dates. The creaminess of cheesecake, whether it's classic New York-style or flavored with berries, goes perfectly with a rich, aromatic coffee. Whether you choose a bold espresso or a smooth latte, this pairing can spark interesting conversations and create a cozy atmosphere.

#### Crafting Your Cheesecake Experience

- **Choose Your Flavor:** Opt for a classic cheesecake or explore flavors like caramel or chocolate for added variety.
- **Experiment with Toppings:** Top your cheesecake with a fruit compote, chocolate shavings, or crushed nuts for an extra layer of indulgence.
- **Serve on Elegant Dishes:** Presentation matters, so use attractive dishes to create a visually stunning dessert display.

### Macarons and Sparkling Wine

If you're in the mood for something chic and elegant, a pairing of macarons and sparkling wine is a winning combination. These delicate French cookies come in various flavors, allowing you to explore different profiles. Pairing them with a glass of bubbly, like Prosecco or Champagne, adds a touch of class to your romantic evening. The effervescence of the sparkling wine cuts through the sweetness of the macarons, enhancing both flavors in the process.

#### Choosing Your Macarons

- **Match Flavors:** Try to select macaron flavors that complement your sparkling wine choice, such as raspberry macarons with a fruity bubbly.
- **Create a Color Palette:** Arrange your macarons in a colorful display. The visual appeal adds to the romantic ambiance.
- **Take Your Time:** Savor each bite and sip slowly, enjoying the combination of flavors as you both connect over dessert.

### Fruit Tart with Herbal Tea

Consider a delightful fruit tart paired with herbal tea for a tender touch to your evening. The buttery crust, filled with luscious custard and topped with seasonal fruits, invites a refreshing herbal tea option. Chamomile or peppermint tea complements the tart flavors without overwhelming them, making this pairing an ideal after-dinner treat.

#### Enhancing the Tart Experience

- **Choose Fresh Ingredients:** Use the ripest fruits in season for maximum flavor and visual appeal.
- **Offer Different Teas:** Have a selection of herbal teas available to cater to different tastes.
- **Pair with Candied Ginger:** Adding a few pieces of candied ginger can elevate the flavors and create a unique taste experience.

These romantic dessert pairings not only tantalize your taste buds but also create a warm and inviting atmosphere. Whether you choose the richness of chocolate and wine or the lightness of ice cream with berries, each combination offers a unique experience for you and your partner to cherish. Enjoy your sweet moments together!

Yesterday i had a birtday party of a friend of me... i normally dont visit nightclubs as its not my thing but h√© invited me so i went. I had a great first 2 hours but then i was a bit tired ( worked all day) so i bought a red bull energy drink. Since my diagnosis 3 years ago i havent had any energy drink. After finishing the drink i suddenly felt really anxious and parano√Ød. Today i woke up and i feel horrible, extreme fatigue, slow brain, weak limbs and Overall just not good.

I sometimes drink coffee and i dont react to coffee like that maybe some fatigue but not this bad.

Can these feelings be caused by energy drinks?",2,1744109615.0,AddisonsDisease,1,1.0,False

Considered difficult and one of the remote treks lies the beautiful Barun Valley surrounded by the landscape that often feels unreal to the ones who embarks on this epic trek that takes you deep inside the Eastern side of the Himalayas, where you can view the majestic Everest, Lhotse, Nuptse, etc. and be right at the basecamp of the 5th Highest mountain the world Mt. Makalu. Starting your trek from the low subtropical vegetation and reaching the highest elevation 4800 meters, this trek is ideal if you are looking for digital detox, authentic experience and pristine wilderness. Hidden from the eyes of the commercial masses, this is an ideal outdoor adventure for the ones who are looking for a serene escape from the modern comforts and amenities, splurging in the nature, in the middle of nowhere for an experience that is almost incomparable to other trekking experiences in the Himalayas. Lying in the region of Makalu Barun National Park, this trek is rather unheard with very few trekkers less than 1000 visiting the region every year. 

**Permits and Entry Requirements**

The permits for Makalu Barun National Park can be purchased at Kathmandu, Nepal Tourism Board office or the National Park Office at Seduwa, which is our trek starting point. In addition to this, there is also a provision of Rural Municipality Permit. However, the last time I was there leading the trek, there were no mentions about this permit fees.   
  
There are no requirements of any other permits and permits are issued to Independent Trekkers contrary to the rule of mandatory Trekking Guide. 

**Getting to Makalu  Barun National Park**

The most reasonable option to reach the trail head for this trek would be to get a flight from Kathmandu to Tumlingtar Airport. Upon reaching Tumlingtar Airport, you can get a Private Jeep from the Airport to the place called Seduwa that takes about 6-7 hours. The cost for private jeep hire is about 150 USD and Flight Tickets can be on the range of 125 USD. Buddha Air, a private domestic carrier does one flight every day to the airport and hence, acquiring the tickets are not a problem. You can purchase the flight tickets online from their [website.](https://www.buddhaair.com)

Alternatively, you can also travel to Khandbari on a Shared Jeep, Micorbus or a Bus that takes about 8-10 hours from Kathmandu and should cost about NRs. 2500. The local jeep/microbus departs every morning from Koteshwor and tickets are not available online and hence, your ground contact needs to acquire the tickets beforehand. 

Other than that, you can take a shared Autorickshaw to the town of Khandbari and get a shared jeep from Khandbari to Num or Seduwa, where you can begin the trek. It should cost about NRs. 3000 per person for the jeep fare. However, looking at the road conditions and the crowd of the local jeeps, I recommend getting a Private Jeep Transfer. 

**Trekking Itinerary and No. of Days**

To complete the trek safely with adequate acclimatisation days, you would **require 16 days** starting from Kathmandu and ending at Kathmandu. 

The trek starts from the village of Seduwa where you reach on the Day 1 after the Flight from Kathmandu and 7 hours on the Jeep. On 2nd day, the trail is relatively easy to Tashigaon which takes about 5 hours. 

On Day 3, we start a rather steep uphilll hike to Khongma that takes about 6-7 hours, where we can have lunch at Dandakharka. Please bear in mind that the trail to Khongma is entirely uphill once you leave Tashigaon and feels the hardest than any other day of the hike. As you reach Khongma, the breathtaking views of the landscape below along with lively forest trails would definitely keep you longing for more in the coming days. 

Day 4 would be your acclimatisation day at Khongma since this is your fist night at 3500 meters. Today, you can take rest and let your body adapt to the altitude, as tomorrow we have to traverse the Shipton La (pass) at 4200 metres to reach Dobate and onto the beautiful Barun Valley. 

Day 5, we would trek from Khongma via uphill trail till we traverse the beautiful Shipton La. The views of the breathtaking valleys on both sides of the pass along with glimpses of Makalu range and Kanchenjunga range enroute are the highlights of this day. 

Having our lunch at one of the two teashops at the pass, we traverse Shipto La via 2 beautiful natural ponds which has got religious significance for the local people and descend down to Dobate which is the entry point to Barun Valley.  

To spare you the details of the itinerary, here is an overview of the trek:  
Day 6 - Dobate to Yangle Kharka   
Day 7 - Hike to Shivdhara and Parvati Caves  
Day 8 - Hike to Langmale Kharka  
Day 9 - Langmale to Makalu Base Camp  
Day 10 - Hike to Makalu View Point  
Day 11 - Makalu Base Camp to Yangle Kharka  
Day 12 - Yangle Kharka to Dobate  
Day 13 - Dobate to Khongma  
Day 14 - Khongma to Tashigaon  
Day 15 - Tashigaon to Seduwa (Hike) and Jeep to Tumlingtar  
Day 16 - Tumlingtar to Kathmandu (Flight)

**Highlights of the trek**

Barun Valley is one of the most pristine destination surrounded by the entirety of Makalu Range. Void of permanent human settlement, this valley is the alpine meadows used by the people of the Makalu region to herd their Yaks, Sheeps and Goats. Surrounded by 100s of waterfalls and the beatuiful Barun river that comes from the glaciers of Makalu range, the true beauty of this valley is showcased in monsoon periods when the wildflowers bloom, the landscape comes alive and the occassional mingle of Shepherds and Yak Herders just add to its experience. 

Makalu Base Camp, is one of the destination that grants you with one of the most breathtaking views of Mt. Makalu directly from the basecamp to the summit. A short hike to the Makalu View Point grants you an awe inspiring views of the rarely viewed and photographed, Everest, Lhotse and Nuptse in the distance and a longer hike to the High View Point even grants you the views of the vast Tibetan plateus that lies beyond the Himalayas. 

Remoteness of the trek is one of the beautiful aspect of the trek. Without any connection to the outside world, this is a perfect escape for trekkers who is looking for an off the beaten path adventure. The rustic and authentic experience of the trek is comparable only to few other treks in Nepal which I will address periodically in other articles. 

**Teahouse and/or Camping and Food**

This trek can be completed without any camping equipment or support. There are basic teahouses (not more than 1 or 2) in all the rest stops and the choices are abundant. You can indulge yourself in the basic and hearty meals with the good choice of traditional local and Nepalese dishes and some choices of Western dishes like Porridge, Pasta, etc.   
  
I would suggest packing a Sleeping Bag, as with the less number of teahouses, there might not be enough blankets and the rooms are not well insulated which means the night time temperatures might dip down and the blankets provided by the teahouse is not enough. Regarding the food, Eggs are your main source of protien along with occassional 'sukuti' if your appetite allows for that which is a smoke and sun dried strips of Yak meat. 

Other than this, you should pack plenty of powerbars and snacks as the distance between lunch stops and the teahouses is long and we need refuelling along the way. It is also helpful if you can pack a small cook system such as **Jetboil** so that you can have hot water/tea/coffee as you feel like along the trail. 

**Sanitation, Hygiene, Laundry Situation and Drinking Water**

As with most of the remote treks in Nepal, there are no provisions of Hot Showers/Gas Showers once we cross Seduwa. There are provisions of Bucket Showers at every tea house. We managed to avail Bucket Shower at Khongma, Yangle Kharka and Langmale for this 16 days trek. 

The toilets are Squat toilets and I would suggest packing Hand Sanitiser and Toilet Paper. You can also purchase Toilet Paper along the way and hence, no need to packk extensive quantity. 

The teahouses we stay in prepare and handle the food in a safe manner. I haven't observed dirty sanitation and hygiene issues in any of the teahouses and is sufficienty safe for the trek. However, I would still suggest you to pack some Medicines which we will discuss about it later down the article. 

Regarding the Drinking water, there are plentiful supply of running water along the way. However, I strongly recommend using **Water Purification Tablets** or **Filtration system** such as **Lifestraw, Sawyer or Ketadyn.** I recommend using no more than 2 litres Nalgene Bottle or a Hydration Bladder as we can fill up the water in every lunch stops and tea houses. 

Lastly, Laundry is not available throughout the trek. I would suggest packing in possibly a Laundry Liquid like Sea to Summit Wilderness Wash or Laundry Wash and handwashing your items as you go. You can also use dedicated Laundry system such as [this](https://thescrubba.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoqQOpqu5lHzJJhbNQpetg9ZSItbvfMmRu-1H28dqKPbQfWoNRMg). 

**Medication, Emergency Care and Evacuation**

For medication along with the ones prescribed your GP, it is essential to carry atleast the following: 

* Cold and Flu Tablets
* Diarrhoea Medications and OTC Antacids and Electrolytes
* Broadspectrum Antibiotics as prescribed by your GP
* Anti Allergy Medications (If Any)
* Paracetamol and Ibuprofen
* Crepe Bandage, Blister Tapes, Band Aids, Medical Tapes and Sterile Dressing pad 
* Acetazolamide (Diamox), Dexamethasone

Most of the first aid medications would be carried by your Trek Guide. However, I would suggest getting the Cold & Flu Tablets, Diarrhoea Medications, OTC Antacids and Anti Biotics from back home. Other than that medications like Diamox and Dexamethasone should only be taken after your consultation with GP to know about any medicinal allergy and preliminary physical conditions. 

As for the **Emergency Care,** there is small health clinic at Seduwa which we reach on the first day of the trek. There is not a dedicated treatment centre along the hike and we must be very proactive in managing the issues of **Altitude Sickness or any other health issues.** 

For **Evacuation,** since the trek is remote having the options of riding a Mule or Horse is difficult to impossible due to the terrain. The only option that we have is to call for **Heli Evac**, and hence having a **high altitude trek insurance** that **covers heli evac** is almost mandatory for this trek. 

**Cost and Other Details**

If you are doing the trek independently, you can expect to complete this trek on the range of 1800 USD to 2600 USD that includes: 

* Kathmandu to Tumlingtar Two Way Flight
* Private Jeep Transfer from Tumlingtar to Seduwa and Back
* Makalu Barun National Park Permit Fees
* Food and Accommodation during the trek

However, if you are looking to do this trek with a Trek Assist and a Guide, then you can expect the cost to be:

* Guide Fees at 40 USD per day (640 USD)
* Trek Assist at 20 USD per day (280 USD)

I would suggest the ideal value is doing this trek with the **minimum of 2-4 people**. This way, most of the fees including the Private Transports, Guide and Trek Assist fees, etc are divided among the members and thus provides reasonable value for the expenses. 

**Packing and Preparation**

For Packing and Preparation, I would suggest suggest trying to Pack lightly with all the essentials. Having to depart on at least 10-12 multi day high altitude treks every year, I understand if some of the items below doesn't conform to your requirements and thus can be adjusted accordingly. From my experience of exclusively leading remote treks such as Kanchenjunga, I pack the following for each of my treks along with the associated brand for each of the clothing

1 Fleece Beanie (IB Merino)  
2 Neck Buff (SPF - BUFF and Mid weight BUFF)  
2 Hiking Full Sleeved Quick Dry Hiking Tshirts (Offbrand)  
1 Merino Half Sleeve Hiking Tshirt (Forclaz)  
1 Ice Breaker 260 GSM Merino Thermal Base Layer  
4 Pair of Merino Wool Hiking Socks and 1 pair of Heavy Alpine Trekking Socks (Rohner)  
4 Pair of Underwear (Offbrand)  
2 Hiking Trouser -(1 RAB Torque Mountain and 1 RAB Torque Winter Pants)  
1 Hiking Shorts  (Forclaz)  
1  Mid Layer Fleece ( RAB Evolute)  
1  Down Jacket (RAB Neutrino Pro)  
1 Goretex Shell Top (OR Foray II)  
1 Goretex Shell Bottom (Marmot Minimalist Rain Trousers)  
1 Fleece Gloves (RAB Power Stretch Pro)  
1 Heavy Gloves (BD Guide Gloves)  


1 First Aid Kit with all the aforementioned items  
1 Pair of Knee Compression Sleeves  
Jetboil Minimo and Butane Canister   
Hydralyte Electrolyte Satchets  
1 Victorinox Multi Tool  
1 BD Cosmo Headlamp and spare batteries (AAA Duracell)  
1 ltr Nalgene Bottle   
2 ltr Platypus Hydration Bladder

1 Sleeping Bag (Neutrino Pro Comfort R -4C)  
1 Pair of Trekking Shoes (La Sportiva TX S)  
1 Pair of Flipflops

3-4 Powerbars and some snacks

Toiletry and Personal Hygeine Kit including Sea to Summit Wilderness Wash for Laundry

Packed in 70 ltrs Forclaz  MT100 Easyfit

After all the wearables, the bagpack the weight is around 12-14 kgs or 26-30 lbs. This is the standard weight that I carry as part of the job and thus, can be more lenient or light depending on your needs or preferences. 

**Connectivity and Electricity**

The last place to have cellular connectivity would be Tashi Gaon and the last place to have cellular connectivity along with Internet connection would be the first day of your trek at Seduwa. Beyond Tashi Gaon, you have very sparse cell connectivity until Khongma and almost zero connectivity after Khongma especially over Shipton La. 

Still, I would suggest getting a **NTC Simcard** after you land in Nepal which has got more remote connectivity than other popular carrier **NCell**.

I suggest you have a Satellite Communicator like InReach Mini to let your loved ones know about your situation. I personally use InReach Explorer for general messaging for remote treks and Thuraya Satellite Phone  exclusively for Emergency Communication. 

Like Cellphone connectivity, the last point to have electricity would be Seduwa. Beyond Seduwa, the villages are only **powered by Solar** and hence, I would suggest carrying a Power Bank and a Portable Solar Panel (if required) if you have lots of electronic devices (Camera, GPS, Smarwatch, Cellphone). 

**Cash and Currency Exchange**

Since the trek is disconnected from the grid, I would suggest having all the cash in **Nepalese Rupees**. I understand that you might be hiking with big chunk of cash but the trek itself is very safe and you don't need to worry about misdeeds. 

I would suggest 60 USD worth of Nepalese rupees per day for your F/A Expenses and about NRs. 20,000 more as an emergency or backup fund. There are no currency exchange facilities once you leave Kathmandu and hence, I would suggest doing it at any of the currency exchange shops at Thamel. There are some ATM at the town of Khandbari but it can be pretty hit or miss with the international cards and hence, suggest you for all the transactions at Kathmandu itself. 

**Other FAQs**

**Is hiring a Guide mandatory for doing this trek?**

Contrary to the rules, it hasn't been enforced and you can easily do this trek by yourself. However, since this is a remote trek and if you aren't experienced to multi day high altitude treks, then I would recommend having a trekking guide for this trek who can arrange the logistics of the trek as well as Guide you along the way. 

**What is the weight limitation for Trek Assists?**

We don't have mandated weight limitations. However, I would suggest trying to keep the weight under 8 kgs, as the Trek Assists are shared among 2 trekkers. With 16 kgs of luggage and 4-5 kgs of his own bagpack we ensure our Trek Assist is carrying no more than 20-21 kgs or 40 lbs.   
  
Also, if you are hiring a Trek Assis, we should pack the stuff in good bagpacks probably 100 ltr capacity so that the they don't need to use the [head straps](https://www.alamy.com/stock-photo-nepalese-porters-use-a-head-strap-locally-called-a-namlo-to-support-81980000.html) which might be detrimental to their healthy mainly due to **vertebral compression**. Although the head straps have been used since years ago, we must be the part of positive change to our Trek Assists and help them have a better and safe work environments.  

**How do I select the Agency or go forward for this trek?**

For remote treks, I believe there are only handful of Agencies and Trekking Guides who have the experience of organising and leading these kind of treks. Most of the agencies and websites shall feed you the same information just paraphrased along the way. This is one of your indicators that the Agency or the Trekking Guide doesn't know what they are selling to you. 

You can ask for recent information regarding the trail such as till last October, the Jeep access was only up to the village of Num and a bit below to the place called Chamlakharka. However, it has been about 3 months that they have completed the bridge and now the jeep access is till Seduwa. 

You can ask for pictures of Makalu Base Camp with their clients. Most of the trekking guides have atleast one photo with their clients or the trekking agencies have photo with their banners.

Lastly, ask for referrals from the clients that they have done the exact trek before. At this day and age, I don't trust just the reviews but a real world referral of the trek experience of any previous client who completed this particular trek. 

Just last year, an inexperienced trekking guide who was leading a trek in Kanchenjunga region at the time of torrential rainfall failed to get updated with the alternative trail. While I was leading the trek via the alternative trail, we could see a landslide on the old trail that had caused one of his team member (Camp Kitchen Staff) to be buried underneath and passing away just an hour ago. The trek guide was new to the region and had only led the way based in internet accounts and relying on offline apps for navigation. Having the first hand knowledge of the landscape, potential fall areas, alternative trails, etc. are the key to leading a safe trek. 

**Conclusion**

Makalu Base Camp trek is one of the most pristine destination hidden away from the commerical masses of the trekkers. Mainly the remoteness of the trek that requires significant time contribution acts as a deterrent to many trekkers. If you are looking for a perfect alternative to Everest Base Camp but still want to see Everest and also Mt. Makalu, then this remote adventure will check all the boxes to be an authentic experience of the Himalayas. 

Thank you for readind through this article and hope this helps for your planning. There is only so much I could share. However, if this peaked your interest and require more information, then feel free to hit me up via email (tmg.kiran91@gmail.com) or whatsapp (+9779862212123).

**Trekking Itinerary and No. of Days**

To complete the trek safely with adequate acclimatisation days, you would **require 16 days** starting from Kathmandu and ending at Kathmandu. 

The trek starts from the village of Seduwa where you reach on the Day 1 after the Flight from Kathmandu and 7 hours on the Jeep. On 2nd day, the trail is relatively easy to Tashigaon which takes about 5 hours. 

On Day 3, we start a rather steep uphilll hike to Khongma that takes about 6-7 hours, where we can have lunch at Dandakharka.

**Highlights of the trek**

Barun Valley is one of the most pristine destination surrounded by the entirety of Makalu Range. Void of permanent human settlement, this valley is the alpine meadows used by the people of the Makalu region to herd their Yaks, Sheeps and Goats.

It is also helpful if you can pack a small cook system such as **Jetboil** so that you can have hot water/tea/coffee as you feel like along the trail. 

**Sanitation, Hygiene, Laundry Situation and Drinking Water**

As with most of the remote treks in Nepal, there are no provisions of Hot Showers/Gas Showers once we cross Seduwa. There are provisions of Bucket Showers at every tea house. We managed to avail Bucket Shower at Khongma, Yangle Kharka and Langmale for this 16 days trek.

You can also use dedicated Laundry system such as [this](https://thescrubba.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoqQOpqu5lHzJJhbNQpetg9ZSItbvfMmRu-1H28dqKPbQfWoNRMg). 

**Medication, Emergency Care and Evacuation**

For medication along with the ones prescribed your GP, it is essential to carry atleast the following: 

* Cold and Flu Tablets
* Diarrhoea Medications and OTC Antacids and Electrolytes
* Broadspectrum Antibiotics as prescribed by your GP
* Anti Allergy Medications (If Any)
* Paracetamol and Ibuprofen
* Crepe Bandage, Blister Tapes, Band Aids, Medical Tapes and Sterile Dressing pad 
* Acetazolamide (Diamox), Dexamethasone

Most of the first aid medications would be carried by your Trek Guide. However, I would suggest getting the Cold & Flu Tablets, Diarrhoea Medications, OTC Antacids and Anti Biotics from back home. Other than that medications like Diamox and Dexamethasone should only be taken after your consultation with GP to know about any medicinal allergy and preliminary physical conditions. 

As for the **Emergency Care,** there is small health clinic at Seduwa which we reach on the first day of the trek. There is not a dedicated treatment centre along the hike and we must be very proactive in managing the issues of **Altitude Sickness or any other health issues.**

* Kathmandu to Tumlingtar Two Way Flight
* Private Jeep Transfer from Tumlingtar to Seduwa and Back
* Makalu Barun National Park Permit Fees
* Food and Accommodation during the trek

However, if you are looking to do this trek with a Trek Assist and a Guide, then you can expect the cost to be:

* Guide Fees at 40 USD per day (640 USD)
* Trek Assist at 20 USD per day (280 USD)

I would suggest the ideal value is doing this trek with the **minimum of 2-4 people**. This way, most of the fees including the Private Transports, Guide and Trek Assist fees, etc are divided among the members and thus provides reasonable value for the expenses. 

**Packing and Preparation**

For Packing and Preparation, I would suggest suggest trying to Pack lightly with all the essentials. Having to depart on at least 10-12 multi day high altitude treks every year, I understand if some of the items below doesn't conform to your requirements and thus can be adjusted accordingly. From my experience of exclusively leading remote treks such as Kanchenjunga, I pack the following for each of my treks along with the associated brand for each of the clothing

1 Fleece Beanie (IB Merino)  
2 Neck Buff (SPF - BUFF and Mid weight BUFF)

After all the wearables, the bagpack the weight is around 12-14 kgs or 26-30 lbs. This is the standard weight that I carry as part of the job and thus, can be more lenient or light depending on your needs or preferences. 

**Connectivity and Electricity**

The last place to have cellular connectivity would be Tashi Gaon and the last place to have cellular connectivity along with Internet connection would be the first day of your trek at Seduwa. Beyond Tashi Gaon, you have very sparse cell connectivity until Khongma and almost zero connectivity after Khongma especially over Shipton La. 

Still, I would suggest getting a **NTC Simcard** after you land in Nepal which has got more remote connectivity than other popular carrier **NCell**.

I suggest you have a Satellite Communicator like InReach Mini to let your loved ones know about your situation. I personally use InReach Explorer for general messaging for remote treks and Thuraya Satellite Phone  exclusively for Emergency Communication. 

Like Cellphone connectivity, the last point to have electricity would be Seduwa. Beyond Seduwa, the villages are only **powered by Solar** and hence, I would suggest carrying a Power Bank and a Portable Solar Panel (if required) if you have lots of electronic devices (Camera, GPS, Smarwatch, Cellphone). 

**Cash and Currency Exchange**

Since the trek is disconnected from the grid, I would suggest having all the cash in **Nepalese Rupees**. I understand that you might be hiking with big chunk of cash but the trek itself is very safe and you don't need to worry about misdeeds. 

I would suggest 60 USD worth of Nepalese rupees per day for your F/A Expenses and about NRs. 20,000 more as an emergency or backup fund. There are no currency exchange facilities once you leave Kathmandu and hence, I would suggest doing it at any of the currency exchange shops at Thamel. There are some ATM at the town of Khandbari but it can be pretty hit or miss with the international cards and hence, suggest you for all the transactions at Kathmandu itself. 

**Other FAQs**

**Is hiring a Guide mandatory for doing this trek?**

Contrary to the rules, it hasn't been enforced and you can easily do this trek by yourself. However, since this is a remote trek and if you aren't experienced to multi day high altitude treks, then I would recommend having a trekking guide for this trek who can arrange the logistics of the trek as well as Guide you along the way. 

**What is the weight limitation for Trek Assists?**

We don't have mandated weight limitations. However, I would suggest trying to keep the weight under 8 kgs, as the Trek Assists are shared among 2 trekkers. With 16 kgs of luggage and 4-5 kgs of his own bagpack we ensure our Trek Assist is carrying no more than 20-21 kgs or 40 lbs.   
  
Also, if you are hiring a Trek Assis, we should pack the stuff in good bagpacks probably 100 ltr capacity so that the they don't need to use the [head straps](https://www.alamy.com/stock-photo-nepalese-porters-use-a-head-strap-locally-called-a-namlo-to-support-81980000.html) which might be detrimental to their healthy mainly due to **vertebral compression**. Although the head straps have been used since years ago, we must be the part of positive change to our Trek Assists and help them have a better and safe work environments.  

**How do I select the Agency or go forward for this trek?**

For remote treks, I believe there are only handful of Agencies and Trekking Guides who have the experience of organising and leading these kind of treks. Most of the agencies and websites shall feed you the same information just paraphrased along the way. This is one of your indicators that the Agency or the Trekking Guide doesn't know what they are selling to you. 

You can ask for recent information regarding the trail such as till last October, the Jeep access was only up to the village of Num and a bit below to the place called Chamlakharka. However, it has been about 3 months that they have completed the bridge and now the jeep access is till Seduwa. 

You can ask for pictures of Makalu Base Camp with their clients. Most of the trekking guides have atleast one photo with their clients or the trekking agencies have photo with their banners.

Lastly, ask for referrals from the clients that they have done the exact trek before. At this day and age, I don't trust just the reviews but a real world referral of the trek experience of any previous client who completed this particular trek. 

Just last year, an inexperienced trekking guide who was leading a trek in Kanchenjunga region at the time of torrential rainfall failed to get updated with the alternative trail. While I was leading the trek via the alternative trail, we could see a landslide on the old trail that had caused one of his team member (Camp Kitchen Staff) to be buried underneath and passing away just an hour ago. The trek guide was new to the region and had only led the way based in internet accounts and relying on offline apps for navigation. Having the first hand knowledge of the landscape, potential fall areas, alternative trails, etc. are the key to leading a safe trek. 

**Conclusion**

Makalu Base Camp trek is one of the most pristine destination hidden away from the commerical masses of the trekkers. Mainly the remoteness of the trek that requires significant time contribution acts as a deterrent to many trekkers. If you are looking for a perfect alternative to Everest Base Camp but still want to see Everest and also Mt. Makalu, then this remote adventure will check all the boxes to be an authentic experience of the Himalayas.

I have an experience that I get some mornings after breakfast. I feel like I need to go to the washroom, but then nothing happens. I go back to my sofa and sit down, and I feel this nervous energy in my gut. Legs tingle. What I have found is that if I go for a walk it gets better. A 30 minute walk will provide some relief, a one hour walk and I feel much much better. Movement is good of course, and healthy.

My issue is that sometimes I need to read and write - for my work! And I can't take these 30-60 minute walks multiple times during the day.

I'm experimenting with Yakult, Activia for gut health. Maybe I should reduce my coffee intake? I'm just not sure.  
  
The tense/nervous feeling is quite debilitating and annoying sometimes, as I can't do what I *need* to do at that time (read/write/focus).

1juamtt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1juamtt/persistent_breathing_issues_dry_mouth_heart/,"Persistent breathing issues, dry mouth & heart racing after single alcohol incident","On Christmas, I (18M) decided to drink a fair amount of alcohol (I never drink). Not even 10 minutes later, my heart started racing to around 150bpm. It stayed like this for 12 hours, and after this I had difficulty breathing.

Fast forward months later, I'm still experiencing:

* Constant yawning (can't get enough air even when yawning)
* Persistent difficulty breathing that only stops when I sleep and reappears randomly after waking up
* Severe and CONSTANT dry mouth on awakening that has not gone away for a single day since the incident
* Occasional dizziness and light-headedness (feels like I'm going to faint)
* Initially had lack of appetite that resolved after a few weeks
* One random episode of feeling really cold

I had a 2-week period where symptoms disappeared completely, which occurred about 3 weeks after they began. Then I suddenly started getting a bad coughing fit 2 hours after waking up, and all symptoms returned.

My digestive system has also been affected,  I've had alternating constipation and diarrhea, and recently noticed black specks (possibly seeds) in my stool.

I've been told this is probably anxiety, but I find it hard to believe since it's constant, every single day, and never happened before the alcohol incident. The only similar experience I've had is sometimes getting shortness of breath for a few hours after drinking coffee. My stress tolerance has drastically decreased, if I get even slightly scared, I feel like I'm going to faint.

Tests completed (all normal):

* Echocardiogram
* ECG
* Blood analysis
* Evaluation by a cardiologist who said symptoms are ""subjective""

Interestingly, two things have helped somewhat:

1. Probiotics seemed to improve my symptoms
2. A herbal supplement containing passion flower, valerian, lemon balm, California poppy, and melatonin also reduced symptoms

I've been looking into acetaldehyde sensitivity and the connection between alcohol, mucosal barrier damage, and chronic symptoms. Could this be a case where the alcohol triggered acetaldehyde buildup that damaged my mucosal barriers, leading to systemic effects including breathing issues and dry mouth?

I tried to start exercising to deal with the symptoms but could barely manage 2 minutes of HIIT on the first day. I also wake up with dry mouth every single morning.

So we had a great night and I felt terrible the next morning. I didnt drink for whole week after that again.

Till about a week ago, I was having coffee with a friend that turned into a beer. A beer turned into 4. And from that moment on I have been drinking again every day starting with a glass of wine alone in the sun around 4 or 5.

Last night I drank too much and hurt myself on my way home.

This Analyst Thinks Different,"The crypto world is buzzing as the CEO of CryptoQuant has dropped a bombshell, declaring the Bitcoin bull cycle might be over. But hold your horses, because another analyst has entered the ring with a counterpunch!

According to Ki Young Ju, the Realized Cap may hold the key to Bitcoin's future. This model looks at the price at which coins were last transacted‚Äîessentially revealing what investors initially paid. If the Market Cap doesn't keep pace with Realized Cap changes, it signals potential bearish territory for $BTC. üò±

Recent data shows a negative growth rate difference between the Market Cap and Realized Cap, hinting that inflows aren‚Äôt lifting prices as they should. It's like a party where no one‚Äôs dancing! But wait, James Van Straten isn't buying that narrative just yet.

He highlights that the Realized Cap has avoided major drawdowns historically seen during bear markets. Investors still seem to be holding strong, suggesting confidence in $BTC remains intact. So, is it an exit or a mere hiccup? Only time will tell if we're in for a bear or if the bulls are just taking a coffee break. üêÇ‚òï

Meanwhile, as Bitcoin kicked off this week with a sharp drop to $76,500, investors are left wondering what the rest of the market will do. Will AI tokens and meme coins also react to this dramatic shift? Keep your eyes peeled and your wallets ready!

1juakaw,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1juakaw/i_was_let_go_on_the_final_day_on_my_probation/,I was let go on the final day on my probation period - just an hour before the Christmas party,"I was working in a boutique PR company (my first PR job out of university), and had done two internships before. I was hired at a very junior role but worked across the most amount of accounts out of anyone in the team. My salary was actually minimum wage and I usually worked 8.40-7pm with no extra compensation. I was delighted to be in such a cool agency with entirely women and wanted to work hard. As soon as I started I noticed the vibe of the office was really off, we all sat around a long table and no one spoke to each other, the boss had never asked my a question in my entire time there / looked at me and it felt both stifling and terrifying (I was once told that it was my job to get coffee for a random client who I never worked with - I was happy to but the way it was communicated was: 'just want to let you know its your job to get people tea and coffee...'). I was making quite a few mistakes my first few weeks as I didn't have proper onboarding with usually getting 200 emails a day. My line manager went away for a few days in my first couple weeks and I was picking up all of her emails, at one point I accidentally sent a press update (a screenshot of a published news article) to the wrong client. I immediately apologised and said it wouldn't happen again. The director of the company said can we have a chat next week in person about making mistakes so we did - she said I need to stop making mistakes and I agreed and said I'd be more diligent, this was on me. Months go by and its high stress and very intense, I enjoyed it but I was constantly checking emails in the night, worried I was messing up and would regularly work 12 hour days. A few weeks before Christmas I ask to schedule in a call with my line managers about my progression and if im doing okay, they basically said yes but more attention to detail. I was relieved but knew there was more room for improvement. I realised Christmas was coming up and it was the end of my probation period, and no one had said anything. It was the day of the Christmas party and I emailed my boss to say we hadn't had a conversation. My boss said the CEO would call me with the director on zoom. They did, and just said 'we're sorry to say this but we won't be keeping you on. We need someone with more experience.' I was almost in tears and in shock, but said: 'I'm very disappointed this has been relayed to me so late, even when I had a call with my line managers about my progress just a few weeks ago.' They said it wouldn't change their opinion and that I wasn't writing reports - something that had never been communicated to me (I confirmed afterwards from my boss that wasn't something I was supposed to be doing or had been told). They never hired for my role and the director went on maternity leave, hiring only senior people. They have a constant rotation of 2 unpaid interns for 3 months who basically did my role (with guidance from me). 

Long story short I am applying for new jobs but honestly feel pretty traumatised by it. I have a reference from them thats positive but a bit wishy washy - they even got my title wrong.  I am so scared about working in a similar sector and also feel as though this experience will sabotage possible future careers. I've had a lot of interviews and got the final  round for 4 jobs.

1juafo1,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/1juafo1/mbas_are_not_worth_it_for_international_students/,MBAs are not worth it for international students without scholarship,"Just wanted to add some insight based on my experience so far. I'm an international student at an M7 originally from Europe. I come from predominantly an accounting background and have done some fp&a work prior to starting my MBA. 

My goal after the MBA was to move into investment banking since I had relevant finance experience, and the only two industries we were told have structured recruiting processes that also sponsor are banking and consulting. 

Although this technically might be the case, the reality of the situation is very different. Many banks claim to be open to sponsorship but are not really and simply won't consider you. Sometimes I've been told during coffee chats and networking events that the bank won't consider students who need sponsorship, despite their website saying they can sponsor. 

Some international students recruiting for consulting had similar experiences with many consulting firms that claimed they are willing to sponsor, yet simply don't. 

Those were the more blatant experiences of my visa situation being a hindrance. The vast majority typically end up in me being ghosted when they find out I need sponsorship - whether that's at the initial application stage or later on in the process after I've networked a lot when my visa status gets brought up. 

My prep hasn't been an issue and I interview well because I've reached a few final rounds just to literally get told ""sorry but you requiring sponsorship has meant we've decided to go for another candidate"". 

After I had this issue when applying for internships in my first year, the second years in the finance club confirmed that the sponsorship was the key issue from conversations they had with people at the banks they've interned at. They've also tested me on my prep and I've never had an issue with my technicals. 

Many domestic students in my class who were also recruiting for IB didn't have any relevant finance experience and comfortably managed to get several internship offers. I've seen domestics from a range of schools from across the T25 who have obtained great offers without any relevant experience whatsoever. 

Obviously US citizens will get priority for jobs in their own country, otherwise what's the point in being a citizen, right? But I'm just pointing out that you will be at a *significant* disadvantage compared to them. I guess needing sponsorship is a bit like affirmative action in the sense that if you're a domestic student the 'entry requirements' for getting the same job are a lot lower than they are for international students. Even if you're above average, there are plenty of decent domestic students who will still be preferred to you. 

Essentially, there are many firms that say they can sponsor but simply don't, and there are other firms that will actually sponsor but will hold you to a significantly higher standard than someone who doesn't need sponsorship. 

Employment reports are not truly reflective of the actual situation on the ground and skew heavily towards domestic students with offers who self-report. When you see statistics about 'how many people got into a particular sector', it's almost always domestic students. 

Schools are never fully transparent about this. They will mention that sponsorship can be a difficulty so they're not lying or anything, but they're never honest about just how imbalanced the playing field is. 

Even this sub suffers from survivorship bias so I do feel this post is necessary. You see a few posts from international students typically from HSW who have offers, but not the plethora of those who end up with nothing. 

I didn't get any IB internships and didn't manage to secure anything in my second year for full time despite extensive networking, and the visa situation was repeatedly brought up as an issue. I widened my search and did get an offer for a strategic accounting position, but it's literally a step back career wise from what I was doing back home. 

I'm going to end up returning home with an MBA that may be great in the US, but is unrecognisable in Europe. I will get a promotion at my old job that I could've achieved without the MBA, and have missed 2 years of earnings whilst racking up significant tuition debt that will be hard to pay off on my European salary. 

I guess my final advice is this:

- if you're a domestic student and have clear goals as to how an MBA can help, then absolutely go for it if you go to a good school. 

- if you're an international student you need to be truly aware of how much things are stacked against you even in industries that claim to sponsor. It's only worth going if you get into a T15 at the very minimum and ideally get some sponsorship to mitigate risk. You also need to be significantly better than US citizens to get the job over them. The only caveat being if you genuinely have a stellar profile and are at HSW and feel you'll definitely get what you're aiming for. ",48,1744108688.0,MBA,8,0.94,False

1jua9y9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jua9y9,"Icy Indy filling in for Ready Bat‚Äôs ‚ÄúTHE BALDWINS, EPISODE 7‚Äù ReCap. Let the madness and the tedium begin!","


Buenos Dias, mi Pepinos Especial! 

Well, it‚Äôs here: the penultimate episode of the first, and likely final, season of ‚ÄúThe Baldwins.‚Äù

It‚Äôs entitled ‚ÄúWorking Guy,‚Äù b/c Alec was in a film called ‚ÄúWorking Girl‚Äù back in the 80‚Äôs, when his career still meant something, remember? Do you remember, loyal ‚ÄúBaldwins‚Äù watchers? ALEC REALLY WANTS YOU TO REMEMBER!

Before each new episode of ‚ÄúThe Baldwins,‚Äù I catch the tail end of something called ‚Äú90 Day Fianc√©e,‚Äù which apparently all humans except me have been watching. Maybe I *am* missing out, b/c I‚Äôm captivated by this beautiful African-American French islander who‚Äôs moved to America to meet, marry, and have a baby with a man who looks to be at least three times her age. 

In these last few minutes of her show, she is often seen speaking solely in French, entire monologues of her thoughts are captioned at the bottom of the screen by English subtitles. 

She says things like ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôd known about this, I would not have wanted to marry him.‚Äù

This is called not only speaking in the present tense; it‚Äôs a great way to show you are genuinely from the country you claim you are, and truly ‚Äúbilingual.‚Äù

I can‚Äôt believe in 7 episodes of ‚ÄúThe Baldwins,‚Äù Hillary has *never* done this. Just sat and delivered one of her infamous ‚Äúcouch lectures‚Äù exclusively en Espa√±ol. 

For that matter, she hasn‚Äôt done this in any of her hundreds of media appearances over the past decade, period.

Anyhoo, think about it, my Bostonian-by-way-of-Mallorca *chica,* it might help. 

I digress‚Ä¶let‚Äôs start the show! 

A little summation of what we‚Äôve seen thus far on ‚ÄúThe Baldwins‚Äù rolls, and I gotta admit, I kinda miss Dr. Hipster Jheri Curl. At least Hillary and Alec‚Äôs interactions during his sessions were slightly more interesting than looking at a rug or listening to a sink. Producers, take note. If by some undisclosed Faustian bargain this trainwreck of a series *has* been renewed, consider putting more of these back in. Something tells me Alec and Eelz will still be having marriage problems. 

The episode launches with a sad scene of #1 fortunate daughter Carmencita ‚Äúplayfully‚Äù slapping PeePaw‚Äôs leg and ordering him to zip up his fly, which he can‚Äôt do b/c there is no ‚Äúfly‚Äù as he‚Äôs wearing gym shorts.

Alec begs her to agree not to pick on him for the rest of their time together. She haughtily sniffs ‚Äúthere isn‚Äôt much to pick on,‚Äù and Alec recites a quote from King Lear: ‚ÄúHow sharper that a serpent‚Äôs tooth is an ungrateful child.‚Äù Carmen responds: ‚ÄúOmg, you SMELL.‚Äù

Kids. Can‚Äôt live with them, can‚Äôt abandon them in the woods to fend for themselves. 

(But you can fuck off to your separate apartment and hire a squad of nannies!)

The scene concludes with Carmen observing: ‚Äúyou look like horse poop,‚Äù and Ladies and Gentlemen, yes, the poop motif we‚Äôve established will continue. 

A sweet scene with the Not-Twins ensues where Alec reads them ‚ÄúHumpty Dumpty‚Äù in an exaggerated British accent, but oddly (and jokingly) tries to turn it into a metaphor about ‚Äúbanking and capitalism,‚Äù tacking on an uncomfortable addendum that after Humpty took his tumble, he sought medical treatment, then sued and was awarded ‚Äú19.5 million dollars in damages.‚Äù

Gee, I wonder what‚Äôs been on his mind?üßê

Hilaria invades in her black oil-slick leggings and ‚Äúew.‚Äù

Meddy Loo reminds Hillary ‚Äúshe‚Äôs really old‚Äù and Edu jumps on Alec‚Äôs balls, prompting him to bust out the English accent again and painfully relay ‚Äúhe‚Äôs gotten me in the old Galveston‚Ä¶the Corpus Christi.‚Äù

He chuckles & recovers quickly. 

Fade out. 

*Tonight‚Äôs episode of The Baldwins is bought to you by Supplemental PediaSure, perhaps particularly suited for Mothers feeding their children scraps of plain tofu, spinach-disguised-as-kale chips, and dry starvation tortillas with smeared with a whisper of humus. Supplemental PediaSure¬ÆÔ∏è, when you still can‚Äôt get things right.*

Fade in on Alec‚Äôs meeting with 6ft+ Emily the Assistant. She‚Äôs here to remind us how much she respects Alec, despite his quirky Grandfatherly ways, and how she simply ADORES Hillary, the BeSt mOm EvEr, but now she must type PeePaw‚Äôs VERY BUSY schedule into the computer. 

(Before they sit, she asks him which side he wants, and Alec actorly replies ‚Äúmy left side is my better one,‚Äù snagging the corresponding chair. Emily says ‚Äúher left side is also her good one,‚Äù but sucks to be you, Emz, PeePaw got there first.)

Emily reminds us again of how *very busy* both the Baldwins are, and kooky shots of the ‚Äúfamily chaos‚Äù pop up onscreen. She then enters Alec‚Äôs dictated schedule into a Microsoft Word Calendar Template, which she ridicules a bit b/c MY GOD! HE‚ÄôS SO OLD! Why does he INSIST upon this?? And Emily, again, we‚Äôre sorry, but you took this job. 

Emily likens herself to a ‚ÄúGirl Friday,‚Äù doing everything from ‚Äúscheduling doctor‚Äôs appointments for the kids‚Äù (too much on your plate, SuperMam√≠?) to reading aloud iHeart‚Äôs weekly stats for business purposes, to fixing the Luxury Land Barge‚Äôs broken windshield, to even, as Couch Hillary says, ‚Äúworking out with Alec at the gym.‚Äù 

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù Alec agrees, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre bros.‚Äù (Sigh. Sorry again, Em.) 

Suddenly remembering the production brief, she talks about ALL the scripts and job offers Alec needs to get through. Alec agrees he has SO MANY job offers coming to him right now.

I don‚Äôt want to be a Debbie Downer when I say this, but, uh‚Ä¶‚ÄúSure, Jan.‚Äù

Alec does his Trump impression. He reminds us he spent 4 years playing him on SNL. 

Emily offers in a cut to her personal ‚Äútalking alone to the camera‚Äù time that she knows everyone imagines Hillary and Alec are always trotting off from one glitzy, red carpet event to another, basking in the glory of Hollywood glamour, the apple of the public eye‚Ä¶

(Morgan Freeman voice: *no one imagines this*)

‚Ä¶but Alec is just your average Dad of Seven (EIGHT, there‚Äôs still Ireland‚Ä¶is anyone ever going to remember that there‚Äôs. still. Ireland? ü§î). He just wants to be around his family! Family! That‚Äôs what these two crazy lovebirds are ALL ABOUT! Honest to God! üôè

(God: *You people leave me out of this.*)

Meddy is asked how camp was as Alec hoists Eternal Baby into the air. 

If she answers, no one hears her, and it wasn‚Äôt shown, b/c the devoted Father of Seven (Eight) had to get back to his schedule. 

Meddy says she wants to poop on someone and that she pooped on Emily,  and good for her. Why ask a question if you don‚Äôt want an answer?

Fade out. 

*Are you suffering from the chronic Irritable Bowel Syndrome affliction known as Chrohn‚Äôs Disease? Skyrizi¬ÆÔ∏èmay be the answer! Skyrizi¬ÆÔ∏è. Proud sponsors of tonight‚Äôs episode*

Intro with Chopin üé∂üéµüé∂üéº, b/c the Baldwins are CLASSY! 

Blah, blah, Alec loves to clean and organize, he has OCD (we know, we know). Cue up shots of him puttering around the house, ‚Äúorganizing,‚Äù while ‚Äúthe Baby‚Äù takes a clue and wipes off the coffee table, which Hillary climbs on top of and crawls over.

Why? I don‚Äôt know why. 

If there‚Äôs one thing I‚Äôve learned while watching these people is to never, ever, ask yourself ‚ÄúWHY?‚Äù Your brain might explode. ü§Ø 

Alec wears a T-shirt while splashing in the pool with the Lost Boys and encourages them to burp at each other. Charming. 

Ro-may-oh/Ro-mee-oh gets quizzed on what his favorite thing is about Mommy and Daddy, after introducing himself and being ordered, off camera, by Hillz to say it in a bunch of different emotional states (b/c he has ACTOR DNA, remember?) and we all cheer when his favorite thing thing about Daddy is ‚Äúhe gives me flaming Cheetos‚Äù but his favorite thing about Mommy is‚Ä¶

Is‚Ä¶

We‚Äôve stumped the little professor. 

After an extremely elongated pause, he sweetly comes up with: ‚ÄúYOU are my favorite thing about YOU!‚Äù (meaning Hillz) and repeats this also applies to how Daddy is his favorite thing about Daddy, but, just between us birds, ‚Äúit‚Äôs also when he buys me stuff.‚Äù

We cut to Couch Alec ‚Äúwisely‚Äù opining on this, using one of my least favorite terms I hear to describe children, which is ‚Äúmanipulative.‚Äù That children  *manipulate* their hapless parents.

I‚Äôve never really agreed with this, and it creeps me out a little b/c it‚Äôs disparaging, implying very young children are inbued with some sort of sneaky, predatory and deceitful nature where they suss up grown-ups, then use their little fiendish, childish brains to coyly con unsuspecting adults into doing their wicked bidding and indulging their malicious whims. 

I dunno. Maybe I‚Äôm too sensitive, but I‚Äôve never liked the idea of the ‚Äúmanipulative child,‚Äù shrewdly using charm and beauty and innocence to slyly get whatever they want.

It was a favorite refrain of‚Ä¶(wait for it) *Jodi Hildebrandt and Ruby Franke.* 

The idea is just not for me. 

Sure, kids want stuff. All sorts of stuff. Sometimes stuff they can‚Äôt or shouldn‚Äôt have. But YOU are the adult and YOU are the one with the car, and the money. When it comes down to it, all you have to do is say ‚ÄúNO.‚Äù

No, I‚Äôm sorry, you can‚Äôt have that; it‚Äôs bad for you. Maybe when you‚Äôre older. No, I‚Äôm sorry, you can‚Äôt have that, we can‚Äôt afford it; maybe for Christmas. No, don‚Äôt put mascara on your two year old sister, it could blind her. She can wear mascara when it‚Äôs safer to and she grows up. 

No. It‚Äôs a complete sentence. See how easy that was? N-O. ‚ÄúManipulation‚Äù dodged. 

But Alec doesn‚Äôt subscribe to my point of view, and talks about how Romeo ‚Äúmanipulates‚Äù him by asking him over and over and OVER to buy him this thing or that, until he finally caves in. 

I thought this was called ‚Äúpestering,‚Äù but we‚Äôre from two diff‚Äôrohnt worlds, Ah-leck; never the twain shall meet. 

Pro tip: You don‚Äôt HAVE to ‚Äúgive in.‚Äù I mean you just don‚Äôt. A little pouting and sulking never hurt anybody. 

BTW, it‚Äôs always weird to me that whenever Alec does his ‚ÄúRomeo imitation‚Äù (which he does here, A LOT) he twists his mouth to the side and makes him sound like W.C. Fields or a 30‚Äôs Gangster character. I feel in no way does Romeo sounds like this. I dunno if this is simply cuz Alec likes to do this accent, or if he just isn‚Äôt *around* Romeo enough to know how he actually speaks, but it‚Äôs weird. 

Now we‚Äôre on to pushing Carmen‚Äôs book, so we have to see her doing ‚Äúskincare‚Äù-related things, in various ways to various victims; this time it‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Baby.‚Äù

I cannot tell you how hard I cringed at an indifferent Carmen spraying mist after mist of God-knows-what onto 2 year old L‚Äôil No H‚Äôs face and later smearing her with big globs of lotion, commenting on how she likes to also put ‚Äúlip stuff‚Äù on her and ‚Äúeyelash stuff‚Äù when her Mom isn‚Äôt looking.‚Äù üò± 

WHAT??? THIS IS A TWO YEAR OLD CHILD AND DON‚ÄôT F‚ÄôING DO THAT, CARMEN!! Ugh, I want to scream! 

But she‚Äôs on a tv show and she can‚Äôt hear me. OH WELL. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Then we get a Couch Hillary cut-in explaining Carmen‚Äôs ALWAYS been into this, with a special Couch Alec affirming Carmencita‚Äôs extraordinary advancement, and a flashback to an astonishingly younger-looking Alec playing ‚ÄúTaxi‚Äù with toddler Carmen at the wheel of a parked car. 

He recites an anecdote detailing her ‚Äúgenius‚Äù at finding an internet recipe teaching you how to mix various substances together with lighter fluid to ‚Äúburn dog poo off of your shoes,‚Äù and words provided by TLC‚Äôs lawyers pop up reminding us not to ever do this at home. Gotcha. No problem. 

Romeo ducks an armed Carmen attempting to to smear him with one of her special, homemade ‚Äúskincare‚Äù concoctions, crying ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt! It hurts!‚Äù Run, Romeo, RUN. 

(Guess he was trying to ‚Äúmanipulate‚Äù her into not seizing full advantage of her AMAZING ‚Äúskincare‚Äù abilities and gifts.)

The First of the 12 Gay Best Friends of Hillary, Designer Daniel, ‚Äúdrops by‚Äù so he can do ‚Äúsuper fun‚Äù hair stuff with her b/c DUH ‚Äúhe‚Äôs gay!‚Äù and Hillary brings him upstairs, confessing she has a SECRET to tell him, in a playful, but hesitant, tone. 

Whatever will it be?

Fade out. 

*Is your chronically inflamed bowel not responding to Skyrizi¬ÆÔ∏è? Consider Cozentyx¬ÆÔ∏è. Cozentyx¬ÆÔ∏è. Apparently, we love the Baldwins, too.*

Fade back in and we‚Äôre in Hillary‚Äôs Hamptons bathroom and GUESS WHAT THE SECRET WAS? 

She‚Äôs done a ‚Äúprocedure.‚Äù 

(Which my captions hilariously change to ‚Äúsurgery.‚Äù üòè) 

Danny sees her worried eyes and reassures her not to sweat it, b/c all his girlfriends with kids have done it. And what exactly is ‚Äúit?‚Äù

Well, it‚Äôs never specifically identified, but Hillary ambiguously alludes to having had something ‚Äúlifted.‚Äù 

Later, Couch Hillary explains after ALL the many, many pregnancies she‚Äôs had (cue pic montage of Hilaria in hospital bed with fresh babies) and all the mucho, mucho ‚Äúbreastfeeding‚Äù she‚Äôs done (cue a bunch of foul pix of her with a grotesquely swollen, exposed plasticine belly, or nursing or ‚Äúmilking‚Äù herself with her trusty ancient Emotional Support Breast Pump), certain things didn‚Äôt go back to the way they once were, so she simply HAD to have her still somewhat unspecified ‚Äúprocedure,‚Äù but she ‚Äúdid it for herself‚Äù so it‚Äôs ok.

I think we‚Äôre supposed to deduce she‚Äôs had a breast lift. 

Uh-huh. A ‚Äúlift.‚Äù That‚Äôs ALL you‚Äôve ever had done. Sure thing, Hillz. Any leftover real estate on the Moon you want to sell us, or bridges in Brooklyn? 

She makes a pithy declaration that ‚Äúanytime she does something in the realm of vanity,‚Äù she worries about the message she‚Äôs sending her kids, especially Carmen (ya know, the only kid who counts), buuuuut‚Ä¶

I think it‚Äôs pretty safe to say Hilaria got over this ‚Äúworry‚Äù pretty quickly.

Extra credit for blaming the media and the ‚Äúhaters‚Äù for driving you to such an obsession over your appearance, Hillz. 

My God, this woman‚Ä¶ üòí

Then a fascinating linger on Hillz and Danny listening to the sound her bathroom sink makes. 

Yes. If you thought installing a carpet last week was too exciting, tonight we stand around and listen to a sink. Season 2 officially guaranteed! 

Fade Out. 

*Do you have dementia? If so, chances are watching this ad won‚Äôt do you much good. Nonetheless, why not take Kinsula¬ÆÔ∏è? Kinsula¬ÆÔ∏è. It might not be watching ‚ÄúThe Baldwins‚Äù that‚Äôs making you confused.*

When we come back, Hillz tells us the ever-so-relatable story about seeing her 10 year old screwing around in the kitchen with TikTok face mask recipes and putting a call into her agent b/c this must mean ‚ÄúCarmen has a book in her!‚Äù 

We next see the evil people from the infernal Sequoia publishing company make this happen, shooting promo material for said book. 

I will give Carmen props for being extremely snarky to Hillary during this photo session. She does funny faces while forced to do tandem ‚ÄúYo-gah‚Äù and adamantly corrects an intercut Couch Alec that actually, in fact, NO! She most certainly is NOT *anything* like her mother. 

Time will tell, Carmzy, and it ain‚Äôt looking too good for your future from our POV, but for now, you get a quiet ‚ÄúYou go, girl!‚Äù from me. 

Now there‚Äôs a ludicrous scene of Hillz fetching a definitively-not-planted toy spider off the roof b/c she‚Äôs the only one who ever DOES anything around here, damn it! 

She says the boys threw it up there, and promises ‚Äúthis really did happen, I‚Äôm not making it up.‚Äù 

Interesting how after Hillz gets it down (I swear, she actually *wags her ass* in a production assistant‚Äôs face as she descends the shaky ladder with the toy) and Alec asks ‚ÄúWhere did you find it?‚Äù Lost Boy #12765 responds with confusion and bafflement: ‚ÄúIt was on the *roof?‚Äù* 

But I thought you guys threw it up there! Where else would it BE? 

Nevermind. 

Alec did impressions of both Jack Nicholson AND Robert DeNiro while the Great Rooftop Spider Retrieval went down, bitterly laughing about how much money Jack made from ‚ÄúBatman.‚Äù

*Alec‚Äôs Jack Nicholson voice: ‚ÄúI never have to work again.‚Äù* 

Sigh. Someday, Big Guy, someday. Death comes to us all.

(Meddy Loo‚Äôs cries for a snack during this segment went ignored, but darn if Eee-lah-dee-duh didn‚Äôt bust out some SERIOUSLY Spicy Se√±orita-ness for this shenanigan. We‚Äôre talking DEFCON 5 Charo coochie-coochieness)

Hillz and Emily go off to have their first ‚Äúgirly day‚Äù getting their eyelashes sewn/glued on *doogehdurr* and snicker about how old Alec‚Äôs tired ass is, and, consequently, how goofy his Instagram comes off. 

Glass houses, Hillz. Glass houses. 

I won‚Äôt even dignify their stupid, untrue story they share at the Eyelash Joint about ‚Äúfaking out the Papparrazzi‚Äù by dressing Gigantic Emily up in Alec‚Äôs coat.

It‚Äôs much better recounted in this sub post by brilliant Pepino commentary:

https://www.reddit.com/r/HilariaBaldwin/comments/1jq0iaz/hilaria_baldwin_tricked_the_paparazzi_with_fake/?rdt=37429



Fade out.

*Do you smell as bad as Alec? Why not add Lysol Laundry Sanitizer to your wash? Seriously. Consider it. We know Alec won‚Äôt.*

We‚Äôre back! Guess what, homies? It‚Äôs ‚ú®Date Night.‚ú® It‚Äôs how they keep ‚Äúthe spark‚Äù alive!

And by ‚Äúspark,‚Äù I mean the gritted determination to drive this miserable clown car of a marriage until the wheels come off. 

Atrocious, Bubble-gum Pink Dress Hillary emerges (Yes, THAT pink dress. The one that her gigantic, only ‚Äúlifted,‚Äù certainly not implanted, wonky gozagongaz suffocate in and yearn to be free from).

She walks SchmAlec to the car. 

They bicker over who will drive. Hillary, of course, will drive. Surprise, Hillary *always* drives. It‚Äôs a metaphor for their relationship. Kind of. üòâ

Alec comments there‚Äôs Turkey Poop on the car, because poop. That‚Äôs what your life is now, PeePaw. Poop. Poop. Poop, poop, everywhere, and not a pile to scoop. 

Alec does a ‚Äúromantic Spaniard‚Äù Antonio Banderas voice on the way to the restaurant, egged on by Charo Hilaria pipsqueaking about Turkey Poop and ‚ÄúBehBeh Turkeys,‚Äù but she goes back to Valley Girl Hillary when she has to stop and concentrate on parallel parking. 

‚ú®Extended Parking Sequence‚ú®

And you thought listening to the sink was exciting. 

They go inside the restaurant (which Hillary looks LAUGHABLY overdressed for, but there are cameras here, damnit! ) and nestle into a table. 

The lens lingers on her straining Circus Tits and enormous, Volleyball-sized diamond gumball ring. Buncha rings on tonight. 

Must be üí´üåüspecial.üåüüí´

The ‚Äúspecialness‚Äù isn‚Äôt Alec randomly running into Chazz Palimienteri (sp?), who‚Äôs ‚Äúsummering‚Äù in the Hamptons with his much less gussied-up, age-appropriate wife.

Alec slobs a bunch of fan service over ‚ÄúBronx Tale,‚Äù before immediately inquiring ‚ÄúWhat are you doing now?‚Äù 

(As in ‚Äúwork.‚Äù As in Alec needs some. As in ‚ÄúChazz, please throw me a bone! üôè) 

The other actor brushes him aside; he‚Äôs just, you know, enjoying summer in the Hamptons. He graciously tells Alec ‚ÄúGod Bless‚Äù and says goodbye.

No, the ‚Äúspecialness‚Äù isn‚Äôt Chazz, it‚Äôs Hilaria needling Alec about getting back to work. 

She‚Äôs dropped hints throughout the entire episode, but framed it as her ‚Äúwishing this *for Alec.‚Äù* 

Because he ‚Äúloves it so much.‚Äù Because it‚Äôs his ‚Äúpassion.‚Äù Because it‚Äôs ‚Äúthe way that Alec CONNECTS to other people.‚Äù

(Really? It‚Äôs not by leaving threatening voicemails or promising to put a boot in someone‚Äôs ass?)

You know Hillary, she‚Äôs all heart. 

She tries to illustrate how much the children are over everything b/c time has marched on, and everybody‚Äôs over things now. 

Alec gives a bewildered, tight shark-grin, and counters:  ‚ÄúThe kids were just talking about the trial today in the car.‚Äù

Whomp, whomp.

She pivots quickly: ‚ÄúWell, kids are resilient.‚Äù Good save? üëé

Hillary does funky Reiki-healing meets Hand-jive motions in the air with her ever-spicy, spindly fingers, and babbles about ‚Äúhealing‚Äù and ‚Äúmoving on.‚Äù

She rests her boobs on the table while Alec says he‚Äôs still ‚Äúbitter and angry‚Äù and ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt have the space for it anymore.‚Äù 

Hillary, panicking, drains her wine glass. 

Alec continues, telling her sets and stages are not his ‚Äúhome,‚Äù and that during his marriage to Kim, their house *never* felt like a ‚Äúhome‚Äù (ouch). 

He asserts he wants a ‚Äúhome.‚Äù

Hillary gets freaked out and makes him tell her what he loves about acting.  Alec says it‚Äôs the ‚Äúchallenge.‚Äù

But presently he ‚Äújust wants to take care of his kids.‚Äù

Hillary tells him that means *taking care of himself.*

He repeats he wants to stay HOME with his kids.  

Oh, YUCK! Right, viewers? Oooo Hillz does NOT like that. 

She reminds him he‚Äôs an ACTOR (cue up edited-in Red Shirt Couch Hillary shaming Alec for his tendencies to ‚Äúpull away‚Äù and ‚Äúwithdraw‚Äù) and that he doesn‚Äôt have to ‚Äúchoose.‚Äù

Pronounced: ‚Äúshooozz.‚Äù ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

She coos: ‚Äúit can be both.‚Äù 

(Jazz hands! Seriously. She does jazz hands to punctuate this.) 

She says Alec can be happy ‚ÄúHERE and THERE,‚Äù and that he doesn‚Äôt have to be ‚Äúhyper focused‚Äù (on his KIDS??? üò≥); that he can pull from both parts of his ‚Äúidentity,‚Äù which she really over-enunciates with her ‚ÄúSpanish dental T‚Äôs.‚Äù

He chews thoughtfully. 

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt necessarily want to go back.‚Äù 

And that‚Äôs it. 

Lights out! üö©Cliffhanger! üö©The end!!! 

The‚Ä¶end?

The end of all the wonderful, giving, powerful, genius, connection-building performances the Great Alec Baldwin has given us over the years? 

Why? Because he wants to keep T-shirt swimming with his lousy kids and doing time-wasting activities liked reading books and eating pizza? 

(We know, Hillary, you can absolutely in no way relate to this.)

‚ùìWILL Alec return to acting, despite his misgivings?

‚ùìWILL Hillary admit to having anymore ‚Äúprocedures‚Äù done? 

‚ùìWILL Carmen burn The Baby‚Äôs face off, maybe blind her, with more of her masterful ‚Äúskincare techniques,‚Äù before ‚ÄúGlowing Up‚Äù can make The NY Times Bestseller List? Setting a precedence for 11 year old aspiring junior aestheticians, all over the world?

‚ùìDOES ANYONE give a rip about the Lost Boys when they‚Äôre not burping? 

You‚Äôll have to tune in next week to get the answers! 

üé¨

(In scenes from next week, Hillary ‚Äúdoes Yoga‚Äù on a prone Alec, lying face down in agony on the floor; the Baldwinitos go back to school; Emily the Giant wrestles in a balloon bouquet for somebody‚Äôs birthday, and PeePaw *record scratch* ominously threatens: ‚ÄúWhenever I need affirmations about this life, my answer is to have a new baby‚Äù and Hillz makes an ‚ÄúOMG WHAAA???‚Äù eye-roll/mouth-agape ‚ÄúWTF?‚Äù face. B/c the new narrative is, it‚Äôs ALEC who wants all these kids now, not Hillz. Are we clear? WELL, ARE WE?)

Yeah.

1jua9cq,https://www.reddit.com/r/superpowers/comments/1jua9cq/so_i_have_a_question/,"So, I have a question","I created a power system, where all abilities are categorized under one of the following six types. Which of these categories does teleportation (both short-range and long-range) fall under?

Enhancement (Âº∑Âåñ, Ky≈çka): You enhance your body in some form or another. Despite the name, ‚ÄúEnhancement‚Äù Skills do not need to be a direct physical enhancement. Skills that allow you to turn invisible, as well as Skills that allow you to duplicate yourself, transform yourself into another state of matter, such as fire or ice, or even transform your body into another creature, are classified as Enhancement Skills. Because of this, Enhancement Skills are the most prolific among the six categories.

Transmutation (Â§âÊèõ, Henkan): Using the fundamental powers of deconstruction and reconstruction, you reconfigure the state of matter. Transmutation Skills can be as simple as reshaping materials from one form to another, or as complex as transmuting one object into a completely unrelated object. An example of such would be reconfiguring a wooden coffee table into a fully-functional flatscreen TV. While not being the rarest type of Skills, those that fall under the Transmutation category are the most complex, and thus difficult to master. Transmutation is the third-most rare Skill category, with Creation as the second-most rare, and Deviation as the most rare.

Emission (ÊîæÂá∫, H≈çshutsu): Similar to Enhancement, Emission is a category with a broad scope. The only criteria for a Skill to be categorized as Emission is that it ‚Äúemits‚Äù something from your body. Skills such as generating an element, such as fire, ice, or lightning, or producing a substance such as acid or gas, are categorized as Emission Skills. Emission is the second-most prolific category among the six categories, directly behind Enhancement.

Creation (ÂâµÈÄ†, S≈çz≈ç): You tap into the power of creation to create something. Creation Skills can be as simple as creating simple objects, such as weapons, to as complex as creating sentient, living creatures that possess their own personalities and individualities. Creation Skills are the polar opposite to Emission Skills; While Emission Skills are the second-most prolific after Enhancement, Creation Skills are the second-most rare, directly after Deviation.

Manipulation (Êìç‰Ωú, S≈çsa): You manipulate matter in some form or another. Most telekinesis-related Skills, such as pyrokinesis, cyrokinesis, and electrokinesis, fall under this category, as do all illusion-based and mental attacks/mind control Skills. Manipulation Skills are considered to be the third-most common Skill category, with Emission as the second-most common Skills, and Enhancement as the most common.
 
Deviation (ÂÅèÂ∑Æ, Hensa): Skills of the Deviation category are any Skills that do not fall under any of the other five classifications of Enhancement, Transmutation, Emission, Creation, or Manipulation, named as such because they ‚Äúdeviate from the norm‚Äù. As such, these Skills can do just about anything, and can be as random as a blind man throwing darts at a dart board. Examples of Skills of the Deviation category include nullifying, replicating, or outright stealing the Skills of others, as well Skills that can slow down, or even stop time. Because of how abnormal Deviation Skills are, it is considered to be the rarest category of Skills.",1,1744107990.0,superpowers,0,1.0,False

Back in the day I used to follow this girl then for some reason she has disappeared from my feed. 
Now TikTok has shown a video of hers which I liked - then it showed me like 2 more

What I noticed, is that in all her videos she eats the same breakfast: plain porridge with like 6 pieces of raspberries and BLACK coffee.

If anyone has been following her, is she claiming she has recovered? Because to me it seems like she is stuck at a place she is comfortable with and no longer challenges anything.

Over time coffee started causing worse and worse side effects starting with anxiety and complete insomnia (like if I drank a cup of coffee at 8am I would not sleep for 36 hours) graduating to even worse insomnia and panic attacks. So I switched to tea, easier on the stomach but same insomnia issues. So I stopped drinking tea and coffee and started trying just a small diet soda, realized after while that I was getting the same side effects starting up again so Im pretty sure I just need to quit. When I stop my sleep goes back to normal and the anxiety/stomach issues go away after a couple of days

1jua78k,https://i.redd.it/suhldkzh7lte1.jpeg,How to read Billionaire Alpha's 99 Deadly Games,"When Aria Collins rushed to the healer den after hearing that her mate Alpha Lucas Thornwood had been attacked by rival wolves and was bleeding out, she immediately donated a full liter of blood for him.  
  
His friends urged her to go home and rest, and she reluctantly agreed. But just as she reached the doorway, anxiety gripped her heart and pulled her back.  
  
Turning around, she witnessed the pack healer dumping all five bags of blood‚Äîher blood‚Äîstraight into the garbage bin!  
  
At that moment, thunderous laughter erupted from a nearby room, so loud it could've shattered windows.  
  
""Your Sweet Luna, Aria Collins fell for our bullshit again!"" a voice howled. ""What a fucking idiot!""  
  
Aria froze, staring through the half-open door. Among the crowd, she immediately spotted him.  
  
Lucas was lounging casually against the headboard, scrolling through his iPhone, barely paying attention to his friends. Though his face was partially blocked, she could still make out his chiseled jawline and perfect features‚Äî  
  
He didn't have a single scratch on him!  
  
Aria blinked hard, convinced her distress was making her hallucinate.  
  
""Guys, let's count,"" drawled one guy she recognized as Tyler, Lucas's closed friend. ""How many times have we screwed with her now?""  
  
""The first time,"" chimed in Blake, another alpha's son from Lucas's circle, ""we told her Lucas lost the silver moon pendant he was supposedly getting her. She spent the entire night searching in a blizzard. Even with a 104-degree fever, the dumb bitch wouldn't quit.""  
  
""Remember the second time?"" Derek, Lucas's another friend, leaned forward eagerly. ""We convinced her Lucas was in a coma after a territory fight. She spent all night at the sacred grove lighting candles and sobbing to the pack elders. Got blessed water and a moonstone. Lucas poured the water out casually and gifted the moonstone to Leila Blackwood the next day!""  
  
""My personal favorite,"" smirked Josh, ""was when we framed her for challenging the lycan king's mate and nearly got her a rogue. The way she begged the pack council‚Äîpathetic! Still makes me laugh thinking about it.""  
  
""This blood donation scam makes ninety-six,"" Tyler calculated, checking something on his phone. ""Just three more pranks, and our revenge tour wraps up. Not bad for four years of entertainment. Worth every minute, right, Lucas?""  
  
Lucas barely looked up from his phone, his voice detached and bored. ""Whatever. As long as I can finally reject her and banish her from the pack after we hit ninety-nine.""  
  
""It's what she deserves,"" Blake insisted. ""Remember how she beat Leila for that position as ceremonial dancer? Leila cried for days. Nobody messes with your beloved and gets away with it.""  
  
""That's why it's been so perfect,"" Derek added. ""Pretending to accept her as your future Luna just to systematically destroy her? Pure genius, man. Too bad it's almost over. We'll need to find someone else to torture soon.""  
  
A deafening ringing filled Aria's ears, like a bomb had detonated inside her head.  
  
Her chest constricted so violently she thought she might be having a heart attack. She clutched at her sternum, doubling over to gasp for air, her lungs burning as though filled with acid.  
  
The words kept replaying in her mind like a nightmarish loop. Lucas was only mating with her for revenge. Four years of what she thought was love‚Äîjust an elaborate scheme to break her.  
  
He knew exactly how desperately she loved him...  
  
Lucas Thornwood, the Alpha of The Thornwood Pack. With his predatory good looks, he could've stepped off a GQ billboard. ""One look at Lucas Thornwood and you're ruined for all other wolves""‚Äîthat's what everyone said.  
  
And like a moth to flame, she'd fallen just like all the rest.  
  
Since the day she found out he was her mate, she had chased him relentlessly for three years, sacrificing every shred of her dignity, while he remained coldly indifferent‚Äîuntil one day, when he miraculously accepted her as his mate.  
  
She thought her persistence had finally melted his heart. Instead, it had all been a calculated game of destruction.  
  
The truth crushed her: he'd initially rejected her because his heart belonged to someone else.  
  
He only agreed to accept her later because she had beaten Leila Blackwood in that crucial moon dance competition and made his precious beloved cry.  
  
For revenge, he pretended to accept her, orchestrating ninety-nine humiliations to systematically destroy her soul piece by piece.  
  
Aria's tears streamed down uncontrollably, her throat constricting as if invisible hands were choking her.  
  
She stared at the group laughing without restraint, at Lucas's indifferent face, and suddenly felt hollowed out completely.  
  
She had given him everything‚Äîher love, her trust, her very being‚Äîonly for him to crush it all beneath his Italian leather shoes and toss it away like yesterday's garbage.  
  
Just then, Josh noticed movement at the door and glanced over.  
  
Aria spun around and fled.  
  
She walked faster and faster until she was sprinting down the pack compound corridors, past startled pack members and guards.  
  
She had no destination‚Äîshe just needed to escape this place, escape Lucas, escape the smoking ruins of her reality.  
  
When her legs finally gave out in some distant corner of the pack garden, she collapsed onto a bench as tears flooded from her eyes like a broken dam.  
  
She covered her face with trembling hands, her body convulsing with silent sobs that tore through her like physical pain. Each breath felt like inhaling shards of glass.  
  
God, Aria, you pathetic, gullible fool.  
  
After what seemed like hours, her mother's gentle voice reached her through the mindlink.  
  
""Aria, sweetheart, your father and I are finalizing our arrangements to move to the Northern Alpine Pack in the Northern Territory next week. The High Alpha Council has requested him to lead their howl choir before the next full moon ceremony. Are you absolutely certain you don't want to join us? They has excellent moonlight dance instructors too.""  
  
Her father, a celebrated historian of werewolf traditions, had received this prestigious appointment months ago. They had planned to relocate as a family, but Aria had delayed and made excuses repeatedly, unable to bear leaving Lucas. She'd even considered staying with The Thornwood Pack permanently, transferring her allegiance just to be near him.  
  
Now, the irony of it all cut deeper than any silver blade could.  
  
""No,"" she wiped away her tears with such force it hurt her skin. She took a deep, shuddering breath. Her voice emerged raw but unwavering, ""Mom, Dad, I'm coming with you to the Northern Alpine Pack.""  
  


Chapter 2

Her mother's excited voice immediately came through the mindlink: ""That's fantastic, sweetheart! We'll start the pack transfer ritual right away‚Äîonce it's done, there's no turning back. It's a point of no return.""  
  
Her fingertips trembling, but her voice remained unshakeable: ""I won't change my mind.""  
  
Her mother was about to end the mind-link but hesitated, cautiously asking: ""What about that alpha mate of yours? Didn't you chase after him forever? I thought you were head over heels for him.""  
  
The word ""mate"" felt like a knife twisting in her chest.  
  
Aria's mind instantly flashed back to the healer's room‚Äîthe cruel laughter, Lucas sprawled carelessly on the bed scrolling through social media, his friends' vicious mockery, and the devastating realization that he'd wasted three years pretending to accept her solely to execute some twisted revenge plan for Leila Blackwood.  
  
Her heart constricted so violently she could barely breathe, like someone had reached into her chest and was squeezing it with bare hands.  
  
""I'm done with him,"" she heard herself say, her voice raw but eerily steady. ""Completely done. Forever.""  
  
After the mind-link, Aria stood motionless on the sidewalk, letting the bitter wind whip through her hair. She stared up at the bleak gray sky, drew in a deep breath that burned her lungs, and turned toward what she had foolishly called ""home.""  
  
The moment she pushed open the door, the familiar scent punched her in the gut.  
  
Aria froze in the entryway, staring at the living room she knew so well, feeling like she was trapped in someone else's nightmare.  
  
This was Lucas's den‚Äîthe one he'd casually invited her to share after accepting her.  
  
That day, he had leaned against the doorframe with that trademark smirk and shrugged: ""Wanna move in?""  
  
Back then, she'd blushed like an idiot, heart soaring with joy, believing it was the beginning of their bond rather than what it actually was‚Äîconvenient access for his ongoing psychological torture campaign.  
  
She had spent countless nights lying beside him, dreaming about their future mating ceremony, picturing their cubs running around, fantasizing about growing old together in this space.  
  
Now those memories were like wolfsbane in her veins.  
  
Moving in together? Just another calculated move to maximize her pain when the final blow came.  
  
She couldn't comprehend the depths of his obsession with Leila‚Äîto waste three years of his life with someone he despised, to let her sleep in his den, to run with her during full moons night after night...  
  
All to build the perfect illusion before destroying her completely.  
  
For the next three days, Aria didn't contact Lucas.  
  
She locked herself in the den and systematically purged every trace of him from her life.  
  
She found the journal where she'd documented her pathetic crush‚Äîa thick, worn notebook with every page filled with lovestruck ramblings.  
  
""OMG saw Lucas in the pack borders today!!! Charcoal V-neck + those black jeans = DYING. Had to pretend to patrol because I couldn't stop staring!""  
  
""HE ACTUALLY SPOKE TO ME TODAY!!! Just asked me to pass his coffee but I swear our fingers touched and there was a MOMENT. Haven't washed my hand yet lol.""  
  
""I CANNOT BELIEVE IT. He said YES. ME. Lucas Thornwood is letting ME into his pack. Is this real life?? I'm literally shaking writing this!!!""  
  
Aria flipped through page after cringe-worthy page, tears streaming down her face, each drop burning like fire.  
  
She threw the journal into a garbage bag with such force it tore through the plastic, her hands shaking with anger‚Äîat him, but mostly at herself.  
  
Next came the gifts she'd spent thousands on‚Äî  
  
The silver wolf pendant she'd saved three months for. The limited-edition ceremonial knife she'd stood in line overnight to purchase. The leather jacket that cost more than her rent. Each item representing months of sacrifice and planning on her part, probably tossed in a drawer and forgotten on his.  
  
Finally, the dozens of photos she'd secretly taken and printed of him.  
  
Pictures of Lucas giving speeches at pack gatherings, dominating the training grounds, holding court in hallways surrounded by admirers‚Äîeach one had once made her heart flutter like a trapped bird.  
  
She dumped everything into the trash, methodically erasing every physical reminder of her former delusion.  
  
By the evening of the third day, Aria had finally purged the last item.  
  
Standing in the center of the now-barren living room, she felt a strange lightness wash over her, like shedding a skin that had grown too tight.  
  
Just then, the front door swung open and Lucas walked in.  
  
His eyes narrowed as he surveyed the noticeably emptier space. ""What the hell did you throw out?"" His tone was sharp, demanding.  
  
Aria looked up, meeting his gaze without flinching: ""Nothing important. Just garbage I should've gotten rid of years ago.""  
  
Lucas stepped closer, irritation evident in his voice: ""I was at the pack healer's after a serious territory dispute. Where were you?""  
  
Aria's lips curved into a hollow smile, her voice ice-cold: ""You're walking around just fine, aren't you? Guess it wasn't that serious after all.""  
  
Lucas froze, clearly caught off guard by her tone. He recovered quickly, softening his approach: ""I heard you donated blood for me. I was worried about you, so I came to check.""  
  
His gaze dropped to her arm, his voice dropping to that seductive murmur she once found irresistible: ""Are you in pain?""  
  
Aria pulled her arm away like his gaze might contaminate her. ""No,"" she said flatly, as if speaking to a stranger.  
  
Lucas's brow furrowed deeply, clearly unsettled by this new version of her: ""What the fuck happened while I was gone? You're like a completely different person.""  
  
Aria's lips twitched into a smile that didn't reach her eyes: ""Different? How so?""  
  
Lucas didn't answer, but they both knew exactly what had changed.  
  
The old Aria had looked at him like he hung the moon and stars. She'd once spent three straight nights by his bedside when he had a common cold, checking his temperature every hour, making homemade soup, practically worshipping at the altar of his minor discomfort.  
  
Yet now, after what was supposed to be a life-threatening injury, she hadn't even bothered to call.  
  
Lucas's intense gaze searched her face, hunting for some clue to this sudden transformation.  
  
His voice dropped to that practiced, intimate tone he used when he wanted something: ""You seem stressed. My friends are throwing me a welcome-back rager tonight. Come with me?""  
  


Chapter 3

Before Aria could refuse, Lucas had already grabbed her wrist and practically dragged her to his Range Rover.  
  
The car pulled up outside The Night, the territory's most exclusive alphas-only club for elite werewolves. After parking, Lucas circled around to her side and opened the door with a theatrical flourish that once would have made her heart flutter.  
  
Aria gave him a flat, empty stare as she stepped out.  
  
The moment they entered the dimly lit space, Aria's attention was immediately drawn to a familiar figure.  
  
Leila Blackwood.  
  
She wore a champagne silk slip dress with a dangerously high slit, designer heels, and just enough silver to look effortless. Her glossy hair fell in loose waves, and her calculated smile drew everyone in as she held court in the VIP section, cocktail in hand.  
  
Leila had been Lucas's childhood friend. During the years Aria had mated with Lucas, the two women had never crossed paths.  
  
So she'd never suspected that Lucas had been obsessed with Leila all along.  
  
When Leila spotted them, her eyes flickered with recognition, then narrowed into the slightest smirk‚Äîa look that confirmed everything. She'd been in on the 99-part revenge scheme all along.  
  
This is revenge #97, Aria realized with stomach-turning clarity. Coming here was a setup.  
  
Lucas also noticed Leila's presence. His fingers tensed around Aria's before he abruptly dropped her hand like it had burned him.  
  
He leaned in, his breath hot against her ear: ""Gotta take this call. Network with packmates or whatever. Back in five.""  
  
Aria stood frozen, watching Lucas's retreating figure, a cold emptiness spreading through her chest. The casualness of his dismissal felt like another slap in the face.  
  
Before she could react, Leila was already gliding across the room with runway precision, following directly in Lucas's wake.  
  
Their silhouettes‚Äîone leading, one following‚Äîdisappeared around a corner, no doubt heading somewhere private.  
  
Aria had no time to dwell on what they might be doing together, as Lucas's friends quickly surrounded her.  
  
""Well, if it isn't Lucas's favorite charity case!"" Tyler's voice boomed as he shoved a glass of something amber-colored into her hand.  
  
Aria shook her head firmly. ""I don't drink.""  
  
""Don't be such a fucking buzzkill,"" Blake sneered. ""What's wrong, afraid Lucas will get mad?"" They all laughed, exchanging knowing glances.  
  
""Or maybe she can't handle her liquor,"" Derek added, pushing the glass toward her lips. ""Little Miss Perfect probably gets wasted off one shot.""  
  
Aria tried to step back, but Josh blocked her path. ""Either drink it or wear it, sweetheart.""  
  
When she tried to break free, Tyler gave her a hard shove. ""Oops, my bad.""  
  
""Ah‚Äî!""  
  
She cried out as she lost her balance and fell straight into the adjacent infinity pool.  
  
The freezing water engulfed her instantly.  
  
She couldn't swim. Her limbs flailed desperately, but her clothes quickly became waterlogged, dragging her down.  
  
Water rushed into her nose and mouth, burning her lungs. The club lights above the surface blurred and distorted as her consciousness began to fade, darkness closing in until everything went black.  
  
...  
  
When Aria next opened her eyes, she found herself back in the bedroom of Lucas's den. Her head pounded with each heartbeat, and her body burned as if she were being roasted alive.  
  
She struggled to focus her vision and saw Lucas sitting by the bed, holding a glass of water and some pills.  
  
""You're burning up. Take these,"" Lucas said, his voice soft with what might have seemed like concern‚Äîif she didn't know better now.  
  
Aria hazily accepted the pills and swallowed them with the water.  
  
Too weak to think clearly, she only registered that her throat felt like she'd swallowed glass and her body seemed to have turned to concrete.  
  
She closed her eyes, wanting to escape back into unconsciousness, but her temperature kept climbing, something scorching through her veins.  
  
Some time later‚Äîminutes or hours, she couldn't tell‚Äîshe forced her eyes open again and realized Lucas was gone.  
  
Of course, she thought bitterly. He can't even be bothered to maintain the charade anymore.  
  
She struggled to sit up, touching her forehead. It was terrifyingly hot.  
  
She knew she couldn't wait any longer. She needed medical help.  
  
With trembling fingers, she ordered an Uber to the nearest ER out of the pack.  
  
Aria dragged her leaden body through the hospital doors, barely making it to the reception desk before a nurse rushed to help her.  
  
The doctor immediately put her on an IV drip, which finally brought her fever down slightly.  
  
After examining her thoroughly, the doctor frowned: ""Ms. Collins, your temperature was 104.3 when you came in. You're bordering on pneumonia from aspiration. Why didn't you come in sooner?""  
  
Aria leaned weakly against the hospital bed, her voice barely audible: ""I thought the medicine would help.""  
  
The doctor looked concerned. ""What medicine were you taking?""  
  
Aria pulled a small bottle from her pocket and handed it to the doctor. ""Fever reducers. My mate gave it to me.""  
  
The doctor opened the bottle, examined its contents, and his expression darkened: ""These aren't medication at all. The bottle is labeled correctly, but these are nothing but sugar pills. Taking these instead of actual medication could have been extremely dangerous in your condition.""  
  
Aria's heart plummeted, her fingers trembling slightly.  
  
Suddenly, her phone buzzed repeatedly.  
  
She weakly raised her hand to check it. A series of WhatsApp notifications lit up her screen.  
  
They were from a group chat with Lucas's friends.  
  
Tyler: Revenge #97 = EPIC WIN!!!  
  
Blake: Whoever came up with the pool + fake meds combo deserves a fucking medal! First we ""accidentally"" push her in, then Lucas swoops in with sugar pills. She's gotta be DYING rn  
  
Josh: Lucas's face when she swallowed those pills tho  
  
Derek: HOLY SHIT DELETE THIS! WRONG GROUP! SHE CAN SEE THESE!!!
