I am a gay man from India and I am currently 42 years old.   
I have lived and worked in different Western countries for 17 years.  
6 months ago my life changed radically - professionally and personally.

**My previous posts on this sub-reddit:**

**6 months ago:**

After a year of living and working in NYC, I was informed that my employment contract will not be renewed.   
There were a lot of issues at work that I will not get into here.   
It got so toxic for me that when I heard the news about my contract, I was in shock but also my body felt physically relieved.   
A part of me felt 'Phew.. I don't have to go to that place anymore!'.   
So I knew that it was the right thing for me even though it was a nasty surprise.

I felt very burnt out and disillusioned with my career.  
I liked living in NYC and doing fun things with friends (it was expensive though).  
I could have stayed in the US and sought another job.  
But I felt that I really need to make some big changes in my life and begin by taking a break.  
I felt that I needed/wanted to live in India with my family for a while and figure out what I want to do.  
  
My boyfriend was hurt and wanted me to stay - he offered to marry me.  
He said that he will not force me to stay and wants me to be happy.  
It was very difficult for me to say goodbye to my boyfriend than it was for me to say goodbye to my career.  
After a year of living in NYC, I chose to leave everything behind and move to India.  
Initially, my boyfriend and I wanted to do long-distance relationship.  
But it started to put a lot of strain on both our mental health.  
So I told him that I wanted to break up and remain as good friends (if that's what he wants also).  
We continue to love each other very much and chat on WhatsApp.

  
**Today:**

It's been 6 months since I moved to India.  
I live with my family in a small town in South India.  
I am slowly rebuilding healthy food habits and spending quality time with my family.  
I am teaching yoga (like I always wanted to).   
I have started to learn how to do small-scale eco-farming on a small piece of farm land that I bought.  
I have enrolled in a Masters program and want to become a certified mental health counselor.  
I am working on writing two books - one solo authored and another with a co-author.  
  
Dating / sex life in my town is not ideal (which I knew).   
Other than that, I am mostly happy (in small ways) and live a somewhat boringly peaceful life.  
I have a little bit of savings and therefore I can afford to not work full time for a little while.  
I am staying with my family rent free and mostly eat what I grow.  
Teaching yoga gives me a little structured activity to my day and some side income that I use to buy art supplies, garden stuff, and fuel for my motorcycle.  
I drink coffee and go for rides on my motorcycle.  
I usually read, paint, teach yoga, garden, listen to music, and talk with friends and family.  
Some days I feel lazy and just watch some trash on YouTube.

I don't have much clarity about my future.  
I don't know what job I want to do or where I want to live.  
Mostly I feel that I am ok.  
I do have moments of self-doubt and panic about future.  
But I have lovely friends and supportive family who reassure me.  
So I am doing my best to enjoy every day that I get to spend with my family.  
It's given me a great opportunity to repair a lot of childhood trauma.  
Probably the best part about me living in India with my family is my relationship with my two nieces.  
My brother has two daughters and I am getting to know them.  
We have lovely conversations and do fun things together.

I had a troubled childhood and therefore have a lot of negative traumatic memories about my childhood home.  
When I look back at my childhood and search for happy memories with my whole family, I cannot find any.  
But now I am getting an opportunity to make those memories with my family.  
It feels lovely to spend time with my nieces and get to know them.  
Surprisingly, my family has been mostly supportive and not pressured me about job.  
I understand that I am privileged in many ways.

I am in a weird but lovely place in my life.   
I don't have much (no job, no relationship, no future plans) but also feel like I have everything I need (food, shelter, health, freedom, and loving family).  
May be if I had a puppy, my life would be perfect.. LOL.. We do have an adopted stray dog in our farm.

I have worked for other people for a monthly salary my entire adult life.  
Now I am my own boss and I am still slowly figuring out how to be responsible. LOL

1gun0bv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlAnon/comments/1gun0bv/im_scared_my_moms_liver_is_failing/,I’m scared my mom’s liver is failing,"She has drank every night consistently for fourteen years. She also had periods beforehand where she drank and then stopped cold turkey. She would also get black out drunk and take prescribed medications like ambien, trazedone, etc. As far as I know she doesn’t take the sleeping pills, but she also smokes and takes several other prescription meds. 

About four-five years ago, she had to have surgery last minute to get her gallbladder taken out. I've never been sure if it was related or not.

In July, she had severe pain in her kidney area and urine the color of coffee/tea. I took her to an emergency room and they said she had a kidney infection. Then they said she didn’t, and diagnosed her with sciatic pain (terrible hospital!!) That hospital did a scan to look at her organs and said everything looked healthy. I ended up having to take her to another emergency room the next day where they treated her for a kidney infection and the (horrid) symptoms went away. At the second hospital, all they did was pull her records from the previous visit and treat her for the infection. As far as I know, the symptoms went away. 

I've seen her sweat profusely in cool temps for years. I'm always freezing cold in her house/car and she still is hot. Recently, in August, we were in a nail salon and she had this random episode where she had shortness of breath, turned red all over, and got super hot/ sweaty. It scared me—I thought she was going to have a stroke. She insisted she was fine though and eventually the episode went away. She has high blood pressure and takes two medications for it. That same day or a few days later, she called me because she forgot her bank pin. She has had the pin for longer than she’s been drinking (14 years). 

Over the past three to four years, she’s developed severe diarrhea. She will have to completely stop what she’s doing and run to the bathroom. Overall gassy, belching, etc. She also gets itchy all over. 

Recently she had bloodwork done. It's through her job, so it's not with her PCP or anything. She told me her liver enzymes were high, and that she wanted to get sober. But her plan is to cut back on alcohol now (I’ve heard this before) & get sober in January, because she insists on not missing work… she went to her doctor to figure out how to get sober. Her doctor told her it would take two weeks to detox. So my mom plans to take vacation time, detox, and go right back to work in January. It could definitely be a step in the right direction, however she’s been telling me the entire 14 years she’ll get sober. And the plan ahead thing & not taking medical leave makes me very weary. 

I saw her most recently, two days ago, and she was glistening with sweat & hot. I may have caught a whiff of the musty liver smell? I felt she was acting strange. We have been on the rocks because of her addiction but have made up before this. She kept walking off from me, and getting lost in the store basically. My grandma did this when she started to decline mentally from Alzheimer’s. 

She also has said that she is sick and has a very, very bad cough where she is hacking stuff up. Not sure what. 

Two of her siblings died before they were 60 because of drug abuse…

What are your thoughts? I’m absolutely terrified she doesn’t have much longer. 

tl;dr I’m worried my moms liver is failing and she will take a rapid turn. She has itchy skin, spider veins, extreme diarrhea, a kidney infection, shortness of breath, overheating & sweating, forgetfulness & confusion. ",2,1731984247.0,AlAnon,1,1.0,False

It's about a situation with a friend for over a year that finally ended in me having somewhat of a mental breakdown on the weekend, being in a pretty dark spot. I am currently in the process of finding professional help because I think I need it either way. But let's start at the beginning.  


**Chapter 1: The beginning**  
A women started at my company. She came from a different country and moved here for the job. We quickly became friends, we had lots of mutual intrests and I liked to talk to her. We had a small friendgroup of work friends. It was nice. I got her a gift back then for holiday time since I knew she was far away from home and it might be nice to also get something from someone. I also offered her support since she is in a foerign country.   
Later that year she needed some more help. We started spending a lot of time together and I gladly helped her with her problems. I am genuinly happy when I can support people. Everything was fine. She went trough a tough time, broke up with her long term boyfriend back then who was not good to her which she struggled a lot with. We exchanged dozens of messages daily, talked until early in the morning. When we would be out together I would bring her home and we would talk for hours, and we would play games together. After some time I started to develop feelings for her. One faitfull night we were out together (I helped her for her apartment search and we went for drinks afterwards) and there was a big fight with another mutual friend, so that wasnt a good day. I comforted her, we had some more drinks and then we went for the tram. And suddenly she said that I wasnt well lately, and asked whats bothering me, And I was struggling a bit, thats true, because she had some ""friend"" from a different country she was flirting with and I knew about it and with my feelings for her it did hurt, but it was alright. I tried to brush it off but she kept asking telling me that I shouldnt lie to her when I say that everything is alright.  
Now that to be said, for me its not too big of a deal. I only really develop fellings for people that I already know well enough, so when I develop feelings its usually for friends and it was not the first time that happened. But I also know that its a difficult concept for most people, and having feelings for a friend, and being happy with them when they are with someone else if they are happy, and just getting over these feelings is something that seems impossible for a lot of people. Something inside of me knew that it was a big deal for her as well. Yet after repeated attempts of her to get me to tell her what was going on in my mind I gave in and confessed that I had feelings for her.  
I said that it does not need to be a big deal. She told me that she can forget about it again and we can keep that pandoras box closed. She invited me inside when we arrived at her place and we sat down and she started crying, telling me how her whole life here falls apart, how everyone was right about me and some other tough things. I also started crying trying to tell her that its alright, nothing needs to change between us, we just stay friends. I tried to explain to her that its not a big deal for me because of what I described above and as long as she is alright with it we dont need to keep distance and that its fine. She had an upcoming surgery that I was supposed to accompanie her to. So we for now agreed that we just ignore all this until the surgery is over. I went home afterwards. On my way home I checked in on her via text message because I was worried. She said that she is alright. I told her how important she is to me and how much I value our friendship and that it will be alright. I had to work that day so I went home, took a shower and had to go to work already.

  
**Chapter 2: The Aftermath**  
That same day we were supposed to pick up her mom at the airport, I offered my help. We picked up her mom, went for a coffee and checked out another apartment for her. I am honest, I made a mistake here bringing up the topic again from the night before, I wanted to reassure her that these feelings I have for her are a small part, they shouldnt be between us. She told me that she started talking to her ex again but that she didnt tell him what happened between us because she didnt want him to be ""right"" about something. Afterwards we went shopping for groceries together, it was fun, it was fine. I sneaked a mini rabbit figure (she loves rabbits) into her backpack which she at first thought she accidentally stole. We all went to her apartment and then I left for home. We still messaged that evening and she said the day was amazing.  
The next day there was mostly silence. She then told me that I shouldnt accompanie her to her surgery, and that she needs some distance. Thats the point where I started panicking a bit. I didnt want to loose a friend, I felt like I had a close conenction to her. I could deal with the fact that she didnt have any romantic feelings for me, but I struggled a lot with the thought of loosing that friendship. She also canceled all our plans from before the surgery. I told her that its alright, and that I am avialable if she needs me. I also send a second message if she thinks if everything will be alright between us. I was very anxious. After 2 days she started messaging me, and I messaged her back. I kept it to responding since she told me that she needed some distance. We started writing a lot again actually. After her surgery she stayed in the city for a bit longer. I asked her if I can bring her some welcome home care package when she was back and she said yes. I bought a flower, researching which flower is gifted among friends and which color is appropiate to not make it feel like a romantic gesture, I got her some cake and also an envelop with ticket for a nice zoo for her and her mom. She was struggling financially and couldnt afford them and I knew she wanted to go there with her mom but canceled the plan due to financial reaons. I also wrote her a letter explaining a bit how I feel, I thought it might help clear things up because I was afraid she would take all this the wrong way. That wasnt a smart idea in hindisght since I wrote it during a very emotional evening.  
We talked a bit, she told me she got back together with her ex. I was smiling and wishing her the best. I later told her that the letter doesnt matter anymore and she doesnt need to read it anymore (she didnt read it yet) and that there was a small gift in there for her which she might want to take out. She read the letter and told me that she doesnt know what to say, I told her she doesnt have to say anything to it and that that letter doesnt matter anymore (my anxiety was gone). The days after were pretty normal, she send me some pictures, some messages and then... dead silence. Nothing. Suddenly she wouldnt respond for days if at all. And at first I thought maybe because she is with her boyfriend and I knew he used to be jealous. After some weeks I asked her if there is something wrong between us. I told her that its okay if there is, that I just need to know. She first responded no, to what I just said that it feels like it. The next day she suddenly dropped a huge message, basically telling me what a toxic person I am and that her ex suddenly is a much better person and someone flipped a switch because I am the toxic person in her life now, that she deoes not know how to face me anymore and I was.. a bit shocked. She also brought up the letter and mentioned things that I was sure I didnt put in there. I still had a copy of it, read through it and found the passages she complained about but what I wrote and what she said I wrote were completely different things and I didnt fully understand because I knew the letter wasnt great but also not terrible, and all the passages she mentioned where different from what I actually wrote. Since english is not the main language for both of us I assume that might have been an issue. I just responded that I wish we could have talked about it and that there seem to be a lot of missunderstandings.

So I still had her work computer with me since it had to be repaired before her surgery and she had to work from home still recovering. I asked her if its alright if I bring it to her and she said yes. So I went to her apartnment. She opened the door and smiled slightly. Since she said she didnt know how to face me anymore I just handed her the computer, wished her a great day and went downstairs. When I was in the tram she messaged me asking if everyhting is okay. At first I responded with yes, but I couldnt really hold it back and reponded with no, its not, and that I am upset that we couldnt at least talk about it before our friendship breaks apart, and I also added that I was upset about the fact that she didnt even plan to tell me at first even though I was clearly suffering from that uncertainty and could feel something is wrong, asking her if I really deserve that treatment. We then had some long discussions, where I tried to explain that what she said I wrote in that letter is not what I actually did write and after a day she apologized, telling me that she understand it was just a missunderstanding and that the words about me being the toxic person were not her words but her therapists words and that her therapist told her that she needs to talk to me in that way. (The last part is not the exact wording, she might have worded it differently). At first I was happy that everything was alright between us but It also felt wrong. You dont tell something like that to someone if you dont mean it to at least some degree, right? But I also cared about her still and I was a bit worried. So we stayed in touch. I helped her with her move since she never wanted to ask anyone for help, so I organized everything for her. I started growing more attached to her again but there was a weird pattern, it constantly felt like this was still between us. She would be responsive and avialable to talk and play games one week, and then be unavailable for 2-3-4 weeks. Thats when I started to occasionally worry and I would ask ""Hey, is there something between us? You seem distanced"". She was going through a tough time so maybe I should have been less worried here but I was still worried about our friendship. She would get angry at me until at the end of that year being really mad with me. I remember apologizing to her and telling her that I wont question our friendship anymore and that I will trust her to reach out when she has a problem with me. I got her some gifts again like the year before and asked if its okay to bring them over, it was, and she enjoyed them. She then was unresponsive for 3 weeks, and I just ignored that. She then aplogized for being so unresponsive. We meet up that week, played some games another day and then the weeks after she was unresponsive again. I think it was that moment that I might have recognized that I got a little obsessed with her because that radio silence was painful. I had a bit of an impulsive reaction and removed her from different platforms, basically to not see her anymore online when she would ignore me. We exchanged some messages that weekend and then she asked why I removed her. And I just told her how I felt and that it was an impulsive reaction that I am sorry about but that I think I need some distance from her for now since this friendship is not healthy for me. She agreed and said that its also not healthy for her.  
Overnight she then removed me from everywhere else, left mutual discord servers and let me throw of a server she invited me to. At work she wouldnt even look at me. I got anxious again and wrote her that it hurts that she doesnt even look at me and I didnt want to be removed from her life but just needed some distance. She got mad at me, understandably I guess. I told her that I just wanted to have my friend back, to goof around at work, send each other funny memes and play games with all night.   
After that we had a long break of not talking at all, for months. 

  
**Chapter 3: I had no idea for a title :(**   
There was a point where we had a little argument at work. She didnt do something properly and I told her about it in a review. She got mad at me and I told her that this is what review processes are for, that developers make mistake and I told her that I know she is a great developer. She just told me that she wishes she would have trust the same trust in herself as I have. She was already questioning herself in the past and I was reassuring her. It was also this moment that I felt like we will have trouble working together if  we cant repair this friendship. So I reached out, I still had some snacks for her pet rabbit laying around which I got for a holiday season gift for her. We started talking again although I kept my distance. I noticed that when she was telling me stories which involved her boyfriend she would talk about a friend instead, I knew that because I overheard her telling our manager in a loud argument the same story she told me but instead of referring to a friend she was referring to a boyfriend. She also told me at that time jokingly that I hurt her so much emotionally (in the snese of ""oh, just because you hurt me emotionally so much?"" ) so it felt right to keep a distance. She would occasionally make hints at playing games together but I brushed it off, I felt comfortable with our distance, but I also noticed that my feelings where still there (I think I jsut denied them in the past because I was so anxious about our friendship). I would occasionally get her snacks or drinks that I knew she liked and place it on her desk. I also planned a little birthday suprise with our mutual friend at work, putting maybe a bit too much effort into it making maybe a bit too large/expensive gifts (it was a new drive for her computer which broke which is not large physicall but expensive). And its a pattern that I noticed from myself where I would tend to get way too often little gifts and occasionally bigger ones for her. I wanted her to be happy, but maybe I also still wanted her to see me as a good person? I fear that this played a big role in my behaviour.  
Fast forward, a few  weeks ago she anounced that she will leave and move away, and I got anxious. We started connecting again. I started making plans for our small friendsgroup since we havent met in months, making plans with her as well to go to the cinema and to invite her for lunch before she leaves (we used to do that somewhat regularly, I would most of the time pay for her because I knew about her financial situation, she sometimes complained slightly). I planned some gifts for her as well. I started sending her more messages again like back in the days and she did the same. One day I got her some chocolate when she was frustrated (I was shopping around the corner and was joking that I will come by anyway to pull a prank on her, so she asked for chocolate and I brought her). Then I had a meeting with our manager the day after and lets just say she told me some things about her move and our manager some different things, so she was lying to one of us and I was sure that at least partially its me. Because to me she said she will move in with a friend while to him she said she wants to move in with her boyfriend. (It was just a side note during the talk with our manager, we talked about the team being not to full capacity with her leaving and then we quickly discussed the reasons.)

I mentioned that to her since she complained about not getting a counter offer to me, so I said if the reason she provides is not work related that she cannot expect a counter offer. She got mad at our manager for ""gossiping"" and I just asked her if she still has a problem mentioning her boyfriend in front of me. Then she told me that she has that issue, yes, and that she broke up with her ex and found someone new, and that she lied to our manager because she didnt want to leave on bad terms and he is the issue she had in our company.

It was the first time in over a year that she seemed open to me again. And for some stupid reason later that day I messaged her on a different platform that I am still not really over my feelings for her, and that I am happy for her new relationship and that I hope she will be happy. That I still want to be friends of course and hope we can do all the plans we had for before she leaves and that the distance will hopefully help me leaving these feelings in the past. And that she shouldnt fear any anxious messages like the last time. I cant even say why I did that. She hasnt been responding to that and started ignoring me. Today she called in sick for work and I asked how she is doing - no response. And I messaged her today again explaining to her calmly and not emotional (like I usually tend to be) how romantic feelings work for me, that its just on top of a strong wonderful connection between friends that matters to me the most. That I can be genuinly happy for her relationship despite having these feelings and that it will pass. And I also said that I need that openess between us, I need the possibility to be vulnerable with each other as friends (especially because I knew we used to be before I told her about my feelings). I also said that I know there wont be anything between us and said that I never did anything to pursue her or to make a move.  
I also told her that she is the one who needs to decide if she wants to keep our friendship or not, and that she needs to communicate, not today, not tomorrow, but someday. I said that our friendship was good enough that it deserves a proper farewell instead of fading out in silence. I cannot go through that silence treatment a second time.

She hates long messages, well, she hates them when they are about difficult topics. So her response was ""Are you serious? I thought no long messages this time.""  
I told her that I said no anxious messages this time and that this is a non emotional message with things that needed to be said because there seemed to be so many missunderstandings in the past. And I asked her just read through it with a neutral view.

She set herself to ""Do not Distrub"" afterwards and played games until she went offline.



Thats the whole story and I am genuinly questioning myself, was I a terrible person? Was I even manipulative? I thought the gifts were just little gestures but werent they maybe meant to make me look good as well?  
I also often told her that she is an amazing person and complimented her abilieties because she tended to doubt herself. Although I also reassured her that her decision to move away is the right decision.

I just feel terrible because I noticed that I was really obsessive, and maybe it were attempts of manipulating her? Or at least it looked like it. What if she now thinks that I tried to manipulate her with the gifts and compliments? ",1,1731984157.0,Manipulation,0,1.0,False

This would have to be connected to my laptop, an ASUS Vivobook N580GD, to hopefully allow for some level of pcvr play.  
Currently my pc is running:  
An i7 8750H Coffee lake CPU  
A GTX 1050 mobile with 4Gb of Vram  
16Gb RAM (upgradable)  
The laptop doesn't have a Thunderbolt 3 connection, so the GPU would have to be connected through an ADT-Link to my M.2  slot wich is currently housing my SSD. That would probably have to be moved to an unoccupied 2.5 SATA HDD slot on my motherboard connected with a M.2 to 2.5 adapter. I understand that i should expect PCIE 3.0 x4 levels of bandwidth from my M.2 port, but i might be wrong and i would love your opinion on the matter. I am definitely unexperienced but eager to learn, so i would like to ask any of you if you have advices with:  
\-estimating potential bottlenecks in my setup (CPU, bandwidth ecc...)  
\-choosing a GPU that wouldn't suffer from excessive bottlenecks (i was looking at rtx 3080 and 2080 ti)  
\-potentially, finding setup/troubleshotting guides to help me get through the installation process

\-finally, and most importantly, undestanding if the wole ordeal would be worth to invest in, in terms of potential gains in performance with lets say an ipotetical 2080ti or even a 3080.  
To anyone that took the time to read and/or answer, thank you for your help, any insight is apreciated c:  
I'm planning on eventually reporting back with updates on the project if i decide to go through

* Run it a couple of times with just water, not just the once. You'll be able to smell the metal in the water you pour out.
* Spend several minutes repeatedly assembling and disassembling it to break the threads in, otherwise it'll be stupidly stiff to use. 10 times will be more than enough.
* To avoid wear, when attaching the middle piece to the base slowly and gently backturn it until it jostles into place before screwing it in. Also avoid cooling the machine with cold water as the official guidance says if you care about maximum longevity.
* If you're considering buying a metallic screen to use above the puck, don't. Instead use an additional paper filter. The paper-puck-paper sandwich will make the entire puck immediately disposable and dramatically speed up cleaning afterwards. Older advice will tell you that purpose cut (51mm diameter) portafilter paper filters are hard to come buy at a reasonable price. [This is no longer true.](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0CX94Q8VG?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title)
* If the underneath of the base of the machine becomes wet ***DRY BEFORE HEATING.*** The surface is so smooth that if it's wet the eventual steam will cause it to slide on the heating plate. It'll also cause the machine to heat slower than usual.
* The brew is finished by the time the fluid *just* reaches the bottom of the spout.
* A basic WDT-tool will be superior to any other grounds distribution method. The price point and type doesn't matter as long as the ends are blunt. You could probably use anything blunt and pointy enough in a pinch.
* A portafilter funnel is the most essential non-essential item.
* If the vent/chimney spits water just aim it away from yourself. Nothing is wrong.
* If the portafilter's rim is spitting coffee stop the brew. It means that the portafilter isn't on tight enough.",2,1731982843.0,9Barista,0,1.0,False

1gumh97,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1gumh97/stay_with_a_nice_guy_or_try_again_with_an_ex/,Stay with a ‘nice guy’ or try again with an ex,"Conflicted is an understatement.

Broke up an engagement recently with 'nice guy'. We were dating for 2.5 years. It started out great then it wasn't. He was cheated on numerous times. I was cheated on- how my previous marriage ended, so would never do that to anyone. He was insecure, needed my reassurance and attention all the time. If I even looked sideway at a man it was assumed I am 'interested'. By profession and hobbies I am around males and females and believe in male/female friendships. His lack of introspection and accountability and a certain incident where he yelled at me for hugging his best friend (and his wife) to say goodbye after a dinner got me to break up the engagement. He promised numerous times to go to therapy etc- all talk no action. He was sure good to me otherwise but made my life hell with this behaviour. He wants to work things out. 

I have an ex I dated 6 years ago. It was undoubtedly the best relationship I had. We just got each other naturally, he influences me to be more and set me on my life path. We lost a baby in the second trimester and it was devastating. We did not handle that well, decided mutually to part ways. There was a deep friendship aside the relationship and we remained friends. Nothing sexual- we think alike, same values, both Europeans. A year before I met nice guy on a one-off night we hooked up and we said don't want to ruin a friendship that means a lot to both of us. Nice guy was absolutely adamant to not to have any male friends, especially not him so we did not see each other or talk for 2 years. Fast forward to now, I went back to the same gym he goes to and tried to avoid running into him. It worked for a while- 3 weeks ago we happened to be there same time. We picked up like nothing happened. I missed our friendship. He professed the same. We met for lunch or coffee or worked out together as used to. Two days ago he sat me down and told me he realized after all those years we were stupid to let each other go and he never had a connection like ours with anyone. Basically asked if I would consider trying again and that he still wants a family and kids- with me. I was speechless.

And now I have no idea what to do. 
My ex-fiance certainly have to change in order to be a good partner. But he thinks I hung the moon and would do anything for me. I am not sure he promises now to work on himself just to keep me or he actually thinks he should change.  

My ex-boyfriend is a self-reliant guy who can be alone for long, not a player- seen it. But that's his dowfall too. I don't want to get my heart broken by repeating the same as before. However can't deny there is something between us I never had either. The level of friendship and how we brought out the best in each other. Unlike with my ex-fiance. 

What should I do?

I haven’t dated in years and wasn’t sure I was ready. He seemed patient at first but I noticed something was off. Very soon he would write about how much he liked me and how well we would fit together. No matter how little attention I payed to him he continued. I found it strange because usually people don’t put that much effort and time into someone they just stared talking with and still haven’t met in real life. We didn’t know anything about each other and he seemed kinda obsessed with the idea of me. We texted on and off and against my better judgment my friends convinced me to meet up with him “what harm can a coffee do”?. 

I made the mistake of inviting him to my place. He very quickly told me he had gone through a very bad drug addiction and was in rehab for a while. I was a bit taken aback because it seemed so personal and I didn’t know how to react. Something was definitely off with him. He said some things about how he liked my apartment and how he could see himself living here with me. When he tried to kiss me I pushed him away and he proceeded to ask me why not. After a while I asked him to leave because I had an early morning. On his way out he managed to ask me two times if I wanted to see him again and when we should meet up. I was a bit scared of rejecting him as he stood in my home so I said we could see during the week. 

Since then I have tried to tell him in a very nice way that I am not interested. In my younger days I would have ghosted him but I don’t do that anymore. However on Friday I had a bit to drink and told him off in a much more direct way. It started with him asking me what I was doing for the weekend. I said I was going to a wedding. When he asked for who and I told him my exes sister he got kinda mad/rude and asked how come we were still friends and that it was weird. He completely disregarded everything I said and kept pushing to knock my boundaries down. Telling me how he really liked me and how he was thinking about me constantly. When I told him I didn’t feel the same he said how he even got me a gift - love bombing me to the max. I don’t fall for stuff like that - it actually has the opposite effect. Finally he got the message or so I thought. 

Two days later he messages me how he is sorry for his behavior. I make the mistake of responding saying it’s okay. Apparently this was enough for him to think I wanted to continue talking and he kinda tries to slip in again. Today he asks to see me and I tell him again that I haven’t changed my mind. He continues arguing about it telling me how we are meant for each other and how he wants to love me and be there for me. How I’m exactly the girl he was looking for. I tell him how I am actually scared of his behavior because he isn’t listening to me and only telling me what he wants. I tell him I am not interested and inform him that this is the last message I will send before I block him. 

He didn’t say he had BPD but I can definitely recognize some of this behavior from past relationship with a BPD man. Now I’m terrified of what he could do since he knows where I live. I deeply regret inviting him to my home. I have never done this before and not sure why I did now. Has anyone been in a similar situation and how did you handle it?

1gumc7t,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1gumc7t/im_tired_of_procrastinating_and_i_hate_being/,I'm tired of procrastinating and I HATE being micromanaged - here's how I'm fixing it.,"First I want to share my intentions for this post: 

I am hoping sharing this will help someone! I'd even love any ideas you may have too.

I am not promoting myself and I will not post any links in this post.

  
I've worked remotely since 2017, and have spent the last couple of years working for myself. It's incredibly difficult especially since I get so easily distracted. Working from coffee shops either goes really well or I get triggered and I am put out the rest of the day.

I'm never late for client work, but when it's side projects or getting new clients, it takes me SO long to do one task. 

  
I also don't have a manager to report to, so the pressure of having to answer to someone isn't there. I also hate being micromanaged.

  
My days have consisted of me trying to work ALL day, then finally getting around to it around 4-5pm. Then getting distracted. Then being up until 2am-3am.

  
I cannot to that anymore. Body doubling works the best for me but most of the people I know don't have the same goals or challenges as I do. It's really hard to find someone to commit.



 So here's what I am doing to fix it.

  
I am (and have) started streaming everyday. It's day 3.  I am doing a work/study with me stream where I play Lofi in the background with a timer. Telling myself I would use a timer without being on video wasn't working. I just put it off.

I wish I had a little more social time on my breaks but whatever.

  
Just being on camera is enough to ""force"" me into doing the things I need to do. Both the fun and not so fun detailed tasks that I hate.

Ideally, I want to get to a point where I can interact on breaks and then get back into focus during focus times.

  
Have you tried being on video when you are having trouble getting to work? It might help! 

From a streaming standpoint - have you ever watched a work/study with me stream? What did you like/not like about them?",1,1731982182.0,ADHD,3,1.0,False

He felt his various mechanical organs power down as his heartbeat slowed and slowed until it eventually stopped. His last sight was the silver-haired man standing triumphantly over him, his fist covered in blood.

 

Eric's corpse had barely hit the floor of the dingy concrete arena before the referee ran over and poured a small vial of crimson liquid into his contorted bloody maw. Two more men carried him away as his flesh pulled itself back together and his bones reknit themselves into their original state.

 

Eric awoke in an extravagant office; his massive body was splayed out on the carpeted floor like a bearskin rug. The mirror to his left reflected his misshapen but healed visage. He had short black hair, golden brown skin, and silverish-grey cybernetic eyes with bags under them. He collected himself and stood up, craning his neck to avoid hitting his head on the ceiling.

 

Sitting behind a desk in front of Eric was a tall, muscular man with golden brown skin in a black suit. The man had black hair and a five-o'clock shadow. His eyes were crimson red.

 

He spoke with a professional voice. ""Your winnings, or, in this case, losings, come out to about $1500. Subtracting the cost of resurrection leaves you with about $750. Do you want it in cash or would you prefer I wire it to your account directly?"" D asked while counting a stack of cash.

 

Eric felt his mechanical organs whirl to life as he cracked his back. Resurrection always left him stiff. Eric spoke with a softness that didn't fit his stature. ""I'll take cash.""

 

D tossed a bundle of cash into Eric's hands and continued counting. Eric counted the money carefully, double-checking to ensure he didn't miscount. He confirmed the amount and cleared his throat. ""I've got a job tonight, and I might need some healing or a resurrection in the worst-case scenario.""

 

D continued counting that day's profit as he responded. ""I'll have a clone follow you. 300$ for each healing and 800$ for each resurrection. The clone won't participate in the job other than to heal or resurrect you. If the clone gets killed, it's an extra 3000$. Deal?""

 

Eric nodded. D grabbed a small knife and cut off one of his fingers. The finger slowly grew, first bones, then veins and musculature, and finally skin. It stood up and saluted toward the man who spawned it. D waited for his finger to regenerate before wiping it off and tossing some clothes at the clone from a drawer in his desk. ""Follow him. Heal or resurrect anyone he asks you to. If he dies, bring him back. Avoid getting killed as best as possible unless it conflicts with the first three orders."" The clone saluted, got dressed, and followed after Eric.

 

Eric nodded, craned down, squeezed himself to fit through the door, and left the office. He went to the back of the club and climbed the ladder that led out of ""Deadman's Delight,"" the underground arena. Eric walked out of a supply closet and into the bar called ""Deadman's Drink."".

 

One of the patrons saw Eric and called him out drunkenly. ""I didn't catch the fight today. Did you win?"" he asked slurringly.

 

His equally drunk friend slapped him on the back of the head. ""Shhh! Don't you know the fights are secret? Do you want to get this place to shut down your drunk bastard!?"" He yelled, broadcasting the conversation to the entire bar.

 

The bar was a front for a ""secret"" illegal fight club run by the ""Deadman."" The Deadman could regenerate, heal people using his blood, and create blood clones. Nobody knew his real name, so people called him either D or Deadman.

 

Eric left the bar and looked around. The flashing neon lights drowned out the stars and reflected off the puddles. Eric checked his phone. It was 2:24 AM. *Just enough time*, Eric thought as he made his way to the graveyard to visit his mother.

 

As he walked, he noticed a short teenager, no older than 15, spray painting on the side of an abandoned building. Eric read the graffiti. ""**The meek shall inherit the earth.""** As the teenager finished, a police officer came around the corner. The teenager tried to run, but the officer teleported in front of him.

 

Eric watched the casual use of superpowers and felt a small twinge of jealousy. He had spent years trying to become strong enough to fight superhumans, undergoing dozens of surgeries and genetic alterations. Yet despite his efforts, he still had an abysmal win rate against superhumans in Deadman's Delight. The fact that he won at all was unheard of for regular humans.

 

Not that Eric could be described as a regular anything. So far he had replaced just under half of his body with cybernetics and had altered the majority of his genetic code. He had an artificial metallic heart to pump his artificial blood, which was 20% more effective at delivering oxygen than normal blood.

 

He had replaced his lungs with a chamber in his chest that carried a 30-pound block of solid oxygen. A person only needs about half a pound of oxygen per day, so Eric could go up to two months without needing to refill. On top of that, he could also temporarily boost the amount of oxygen he was using to increase his condition for a short period. However, he had to be careful or he would experience oxygen toxicity.

 

He had replaced his hinge joints with ball joints, allowing him to move his limbs and fingers unnaturally. His teeth and jaw were replaced by metal. That combined with his motorized jaw allowed him to bite through steel.

 

His genetic alterations were equally extreme. He altered his brain to make it so he no longer needed to sleep. He changed his pain receptors to be able to turn on and off, allowing him to endure excruciating punishment while still being able to have a sense of touch.

 

He altered his amygdala to feel reduced fear. He altered his pituitary gland, allowing him to grow endlessly bigger. He modified his body to produce a more concentrated version of adrenalin. He altered his muscles to become more and more dense so he could fit more muscles into a smaller space. And yet, despite having molded himself into a veritable monster, he was still outclassed by the average superhuman.

 

Currently, he was saving up to purchase a cybernetic augmentation that would give him solid graphene bones. This would prevent him from getting his bones broken as easily. The best part about D's powers, for Eric at least, was that they would heal any broken cybernetics if they were still in the body, so he didn't have to worry about his augments.

 

Despite the innumerable modifications Eric had made to his body, he was still nowhere near his goal. He turned to the clone D made. ""Wait here for a while."" The clone saluted.

 

Eric entered the dark and dreary cemetery. He walked past many graves, all human. Superhumans didn't age or get sick, so death was rare for them, and even when it did happen, they had enough money to afford better accommodations.

 

Eric walked up to a grave labeled ""Misty Mendoza"" and sat next to it.

 

""Been a while, Mom. Sorry, I haven't visited more,"" Eric said as he pulled out a sandwich from his coat pocket.

 

""I've been busy with my work. I just need to do one more job, and I'll be able to afford the graphene bones. Then I can start saving up to buy subdermal plates. That should be enough."" Eric took a bite of his sandwich before continuing.

 

""It'll take a long time, but I'll make it happen. I won't let the man who did this to you live much longer. I promise. Oh, uh, the cat I adopted a while back... I had to give her to Nathan. I haven't had an apartment ever since I got the implant that removes my need for sleep, so I couldn't take care of her. She's a really lovely cat; you would have liked her."" He felt himself tear up slightly. He quickly steadied himself.

 

""I'll bring flowers next time,"" Eric said somberly as he placed the wrapper in his coat pocket.

 

Eric left the cemetery and made his way to an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of the city. He walked up to one of the cars parked outside and knocked on it. ""Nathan? You ready?"" he asked.

 

A tall, scraggly, and unkempt man stepped out of the car. He had dark circles under his bloodshot emerald-green eyes. His long black tangled hair was tied up in a ponytail. Despite being 6'8 he was dwarfed by Eric. He sighed deeply. ""That cat is quite frankly a little demon. She woke me up 3 times last night."" He cracked his back and began walking toward the warehouse.

 

Eric followed behind closely. ""She's a sweet cat, I promise. She just gets a little chaotic during the nighttime."" Eric justified.

 

Nathan gave him a withering look. ""Says the dude who DOESN'T HAVE TO SLEEP!"" He groaned like a dying animal as he forced himself to walk into the warehouse.

 

Eric looked down sadly. ""If you don't want to take care of her, I can find another place for her."" He said dejectedly.

 

Nathan snapped around at an intense speed. ""No! She's mine. You can have her when you pry her from my cold dead hands."" He said it with a wild look in his eyes.

 

Eric meekly put his massive hands up in surrender. ""O-okay man.""

 

They walked into the warehouse. Nathan's tall, lanky frame was contrasted almost cartoonishly by Eric's hulking silhouette. There were several other people inside talking. Eric made his way to the group as Nathan sat on a couch in the corner while making himself coffee using telekinesis.

 

Once Eric arrived, a tall man with black hair and silver eyes looked at the Deadman clone behind Eric. ""I see you got the job I requested done. Don't worry, I'll cover the costs of the clone and any resulting expenses. Now let's go over the plan once more. Any questions and concerns will be addressed.""

 

Several of the other people groaned with annoyance, as they had already heard the plans dozens of times. Eric, however, was thankful; his numerous neurological augmentations had made him a little forgetful and distracted, so Sherlock's reminders of the plan were very useful.

 

Sherlock began. ""First up is Jimmy. He will use his illusion powers to make our car invisible."" Jimmy was an unkempt man in a tie-dye shirt and bloodshot eyes.

 

Next is Z. He will use his lightning powers to cause a blackout so they can't contact the sentinels."" Z was a feminine man with blonde hair and bright blue eyes. He constantly floated everywhere on a cloud of lightning. Eric couldn't tell if he was lazy, arrogant, or both.

 

""Then Eric will cause a disturbance around the front of the building, attracting most of the guards. Then we sneak around back, and Nathan picks the lock.""

 

""It's less ""picking the lock"" per se and more me just telekinetically moving the tumblers,"" Nathan interjected as he sipped his coffee.

 

Sherlock gave him a side-eye. ""Well, after he telekinetically moves the tumblers to open the door, then comes in Pinky."" Pinky was a short girl with bright pink hair and very pastel colors all over her clothes.

 

""She will use her plasma powers to melt through the first layer of the vault. I'll be hacking into the alarms and cameras to prevent our discovery. Nathan will move the tumblers and open the second layer. The second layer has fire-resistant metal, and the first layer has weighted pins, so both of them are necessary.""

 

Z raised her hand. ""Why not find a stronger telekinetic then? That way we would have one less member and therefore one less cut to distribute.""

 

""Finding a telekinetic that powerful would be easy. The issue is precision. Nathan might only be a low-level telekinetic, but he's been around since the golden age, so he has a lot of experience."" Sherlock explained.

 

Everyone besides Eric and Sherlock began looking at Nathan with more respect. The golden age was over 600 years ago. This meant Nathan was one of the first superhumans. His powers weren't particularly strong, but he had centuries to perfect his precision. Nobody else objected to his inclusion in the heist anymore.

 

Sherlock continued. ""After both layers of the vault have been bypassed, I'll hack the final layer, which is a bioscanner. It sounds more secure than it is. After that, Jimmy makes an illusion of Eric while making the real Eric invisible. He meets us at the van; we hop in, and we drive back here. Questions?""

 

Eric raised his hand and asked a question. ""What about Z? Will we be picking him up?""

 

Sherlock shook his head. ""No. Z can turn into electricity. He will escape by himself and meet us at the warehouse.""

 

Nathan spoke next. ""What exactly are we stealing?""

 

Sherlock explained. ""Something that has no value to you but a lot of value to somebody else.""

 

Nathan looked annoyed. ""I don't wanna get involved in something that could draw the ire of a big shot or a legacy family.""

 

Sherlock laughed. ""We are mercenaries. We are the lowest rung on the ladder. Going after us would only be a waste of time. This is a fight between titans.""

 

Nathan aqueised.

 

Pinky raised her hand. ""How much are we getting, and how are we receiving our cut?""

 

""We will bring the item back here and sell it to the client. Each of us will split the money equally. Any questions?"" Sherlock asked.

 

""Yes. Many. Firstly, how do we know you won't run away with the money? Second, are you seriously suggesting that a mortal will get a full cut like the rest of us?"" Pinky asked indignantly.

 

""For your first question, I will remain as collateral when the item is being sold. If you don't get your money, you can vent your frustrations on me. As for your second question, N-"" Sherlock was abruptly cut off.

 

""If you have an issue with my friend taking a full cut, you can take it up with me and I can show you what 250 pounds of force can do to your brainstem,"" Nathan spoke menacingly.

 

The room grew silent. All of them felt an ever-so-slight pressure in the room. Pinky backed up with her hands raised. ""Chill out, okay? I didn't know he was with you. Just make sure he pulls his weight and we'll have no issues."" Nathan nodded silently.

 

Sherlock cleared his throat and continued. ""Now that that is sorted, the last thing to go over is the deadman clone. He will stay with Eric, as he's the one in the most direct line of fire. If one of you ends up dead, the rest of us will try to get your body back to the clone within 3 minutes. Any longer than that, and you'll be resurrected with a mangled mind."" Sherlock spoke solemnly.

 

Everyone in the room besides Z looked a little anxious, as death was a real possibility. But if they were successful, then the rewards would be biblical. Z, on the other hand, looked entirely nonplused.

 

Sherlock looked out over the crew once more. ""Are you all prepared to risk your lives for this? Survival is not guaranteed. Success is not guaranteed. But if you do survive and succeed, then you will make 10 million apiece at the minimum. Probably more. Not to mention, if you manage to complete this heist, you'll earn a permanent spot in my crew for any future jobs applicable to your skill set.""

 

Eric took a deep breath and nodded. ""*I need that money. It will be enough for more than just graphene bones. It will be enough for that subdermal titanium alloy I saw at the mod shop. I'd be bulletproof. That might be enough. Enough to finish it.""*

 

Nathan and the rest of the group all agreed. Some looked more hesitant than others. Z yawned as he waved his hand. ""Yeah, sure, let's get going already."" He said as he floated into the back of the van.

 

The rest of the group piled into the van. Jimmy went around to the front and got in the driver's seat. He reached out to turn the key and suddenly screamed. ""FUCK! Don't scream in my ear like that!"" Jimmy turned to the side and yelled at his empty passenger seat.

 

Eric opened his mouth to ask a question, but Sherlock stopped him. ""He's schizophrenic. He has medication, but his illusions aren't as realistic when he's medicated. Don't worry too much; he has experience dealing with hallucinations."" Eric began to wonder if he had made a mistake joining this heist as the van started up.

 

Eric began hyping himself up as they approached the facility. His job was the simplest and also the most dangerous. All he had to do was cause a ruckus. But he was also going to be riddled with bullets. Thankfully the Deadman clone was here, and Sherlock was footing the bill.

 

As they neared the facility, Jimmy began to flex his temple. Suddenly the van and the people within it vanished. Eric panicked for a moment at not being able to see his own body but quickly calmed down. They parked right across the street from the facility.

 

Sherlock turned to Jimmy. ""How long can you hold this?"" Jimmy looked in the direction of the voice. ""30 minutes, 45 at the most,"" Sherlock spoke to the rest of the crew. ""Okay, let's move. Z, you go first, then Eric. Then we move out.""

 

Z stepped out of the back of the van and turned into a bolt of lightning. He zoomed toward the distribution substation. A second or two passed until suddenly the whole district went dark.

 

Eric took a deep breath and stepped out of the van with the deadman clone. Jimmy undid the illusion placed on him but left the deadman clone invisible.

 

Eric walked to a car nearby, bent down, and lifted with all his might. His metallic implants whirred and buzzed as he lifted the car over his head. He hurled it toward the front of the facility with all his might. The vehicle crashed through the building into the front desk area. Panicking security guards ran out of the building and opened fire with their weapons. Bullets lodged themselves in Eric's flesh as he charged toward them.

 

Sherlock and the others piled out of the van, still covered by Jimmy. They rounded the corner, and Pinky blasted open a side door. The building was dark. Sherlock quickly guided them to a staircase and led them to the bottom floor.

 

""Okay, the backup generator should kick in within 30 seconds,"" Sherlock said as he tore a keypad off a door and hooked into it with a strange device. A few seconds passed. The door opened as the power came back on.

 

""I've hacked the cameras. Yesterday's footage will play on a loop for the next hour. Hurry in."" Sherlock said urgently.

 

Nathan and Pinky ran in and went to the first layer of the vault. Pinky smiled as she summoned a massive ball of bright pink plasma. It tore through the first layer. They quickly ran through. Nathan froze as he saw a hitch in their plans. Somebody was guarding the second layer.

 

On the outside, Eric continued to go wild. He was tearing the guard's limb from limb. He was in a wild frenzy, or so he made it seem. One of the guards ran to the back and grabbed a shotgun. He leveled it at Eric's head point blank and fired.

 

At the last moment, Eric tilted his head just enough so that the shrapnel would mostly hit his metal jaw. The shrapnel blasted most of his face apart, but he was left alive. The guards watched in horror as pieces of Eric's face sloughed off. This gave Eric enough time to dive behind the car where the invisible Deadman clone was.

 

The Deadman clone was intelligent enough to know when to heal and when to stay back. It bit open its finger and dripped a single drop of blood into Eric's mangled mouth. Eric was about to re-enter the fight when he heard a loud voice.

 

""I knew we shouldn't have hired a bunch of fucking mortals to protect this facility; I warned the boss about something like this."" A 6-foot man with long silver hair spoke angrily to another man next to him.

 

""They are weak, but they work for very cheap. Besides, security is mainly based on the illusion of strength. Most criminals will be dissuaded from breaking into a place just by seeing a lock. The strength of the lock is secondary to the illusion of strength it produces."" A slightly shorter man with golden hair replied calmly as they walked out of the facility.

 

Eric recognized them both. One of them was Alloy. The fighter that killed him in the underground arena earlier that day. The other was Achilles; he was Alloy's brother. The two of them pushed past the security guards toward Eric. Alloy looked up at him with a feeling of recognition. Suddenly he smiled and activated his power that turned his skin to metal.

 

Inside the facility, Nathan and the others were alarmed to find somebody guarding the second layer. Before the man could even react, Nathan sent two blades of telekinetic energy directly toward the man's eyes. They shattered on contact as the man smiled.

 

""I should have known this gig was too good to be true. It looks like I'll have to earn my salary. A telekinetic, an unknown, and I'm guessing from the melted door one of you is a fire user. Okay. Let's get to it."" The man reached out to grab Pinky, and she responded with a pink plasma blast to his face.

 

As the smoke cleared, the man coughed a little and waived it out of his face. ""There's the fire user."" He lunged toward Pinky as she sent repeated blasts toward him.

 

Nathan concentrated his energy and sent a hyper-condensed blade of telekinesis into the man's ear canal. It managed to draw blood but not pierce through the ear canal.

 

The man held his bloodied ear with his hand as he turned to Nathan. ""Crafty telekinetics are the worst."" Just as the man began to lunge, he stopped and grabbed his throat. He was choking.

 

Nathan casually walked past him and began moving the tumblers of the second layer of the vault. The man tried to reach out to grab him but was growing weaker by the moment.

 

Nathan stood up as the second layer door opened. He looked at the collapsed man. ""The game was over the moment I saw you cough. It means you still breathe. Then I just had to wait for you to open your mouth long enough to send a strand of telekinetic energy into your windpipe. I created a small telekinetic barrier. It's 600 years too early for trash like you to step to me.""

 

Nathan turned toward Sherlock and grabbed him by the throat. ""You said no superhumans would be here. Was that guy just a regular dude who can tank a plasma blast point-blank?""

 

Sherlock raised his hands. ""My sources told me that the superhumans that guard this facility would be gone today! If that guy is here, then that means Alloy and Achilles are probably here too. The whole mission is a wash!""

 

Nathan let go of Sherlock. ""No, we can still salvage this. Give me a second."" Nathan closed his eyes and began mouthing words to empty air. The telekinetic energy began to flurry about in a chaotic but orderly manner.

 

Outside, Eric stood before Alloy and Achilies. Alloy was covered in silvery chrome metal. Achilles was covered in a reflective golden metal. Alloy suddenly spoke. ""I recognize this guy. He was the mortal I iced in the arena this morning!""

 

Achilles sighed. ""You're still doing that shit? Why? It's not like you need the money."" He said it with an exasperated tone.

 

Alloy replied defensively. ""There's no risk because Deadman always resurrects me if I die. It's good training.""

 

Eric Wrenched his hand back and threw a punch toward Alloy's center of mass. Alloy flew across the street and landed on the side of the facility, creating a hole in the wall. Eric turned to run when he felt Achilles grab him in a bear hug. Alloy stood up and began to run toward Eric. At the last moment, he leaped into the air and did a flying drop kick to the back of his head. 

 

As Eric recovered, Achilles spoke. ""You might have a point, brother. This is pretty fun.""

 

Eric ripped himself free of Achilles' grasp and lept toward where the Deadman clone was hiding invisibly. Achilles grabbed Eric's leg as Alloy looked around where Eric was leaping. He saw a faint outline of dust in a vaguely humanoid shape. He grabbed the outline by the throat.

 

""Looks like our friend here came prepared with a Deadman clone and an illusion user too! Sorry to say it looks like our friend Deadman won't be able to collect his fee."" Alloy taunted as he killed the deadman clone.

 

Eric's mind began to race when suddenly he heard Nathan's voice in his ear. ""Eric, are you okay? I can hear you just speak.""

 

Eric tossed the question of how Nathan could talk to him aside for the moment. ""Nathan! I need help! I'm fighting Alloy and Achilles, and I'm losing hard! The Deadman clone is gone!""

 

""I'm not close enough to use a significant amount of power right now!"" Nathan replied. It was taking all of his concentration to send and receive vibrations and turn them into sound.

 

Eric felt himself begin to panic. ""Then I gotta get the fuck out of here! These two are practically invincible!""

 

""Calm down, Eric. They aren't invincible. Their skin is metal. Nobody in this world is truly invincible. They have regular human strength and speed for one. For two, their internals are the same as ever. The most important thing is to think creatively. That's the key to any fight with a superhuman. Think outside the box. I gotta go now. I have faith in you, kid."" Nathan's voice vanished from Eric's head.

 

Eric took a deep breath and calmed down as he turned to face the metallic twins. *""Nobody in this world is invincible.""* Eric's mind began working at full speed.

 

Alloy laughed. ""God, it's sad to see such a formidable mortal lose his mind. Although I can't say I blame him, he is just a human."" Alloy mocked.

 

Eric ran toward Alloy and threw a punch to his temple. The punch was intense and filled with strength. Achilles chuckled. ""Don't you know the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and over?"" he suddenly stopped. Alloy had stood up, but he was looking woozy and confused.

 

Before Achilles could recover from the shock, Eric grabbed him. Eric had both his hands on the side of Achilles' head. ""Wait, stop, we can."" Achilles tried to plead but was cut off by a sickening crunch as his neck was snapped into an unnatural angle.

 

Alloy's head was spinning. He couldn't make sense of anything. Then he saw his brother's lifeless body on the ground. He looked at Eric with a fury untold as he powered through his concussion through sheer force of will. ""I'LL KILL YOU!"" He roared with fury untold.

 

Eric tried to grab him, but contrary to Alloy's rage-stricken expression, he was not beyond sense. He no longer viewed Eric as a weak and pathetic mortal. He treated him as a fellow superhuman.

 

Every blow to Eric was intense. The hits may not have had superhuman strength behind them, but the fists were made of metal. It was like being hit by brass knuckles. Slowly he was being worn down by the assault.

 

Eric decided to switch tactics. ""You are the superior brother. I mean, talk about a letdown. I was hoping for the battle of the century with golden balls over there, and what did I get? A 3-minute skirmish followed by an easy execution. Not to speak ill of the dead, but where's his showmanship? If he had that kind of performance in the arena, the spectators would ask for their money back.""

 

""YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP YOU FUCKING FREAK!"" Alloy screamed as he threw punch after punch at Eric. But he committed too much and made a small mistake. Eric dodged to the side before the last punch connected, causing Alloy to slip. Eric took advantage of the slip and grabbed Alloy. He held him tight as he jumped into the lake.

 

As they began to sink, Eric smiled. He didn't need to breathe thanks to his cybernetics. A few minutes passed before Alloy finally stopped breathing. Eric let go and watched the metallic man sink to the bottom of the lake.

 

As Eric resurfaced, he saw a hand extended out to him. It was Nathan. ""You did good, kid. We got the item. It's time to go."" Eric and the others piled in the back of the van and headed back to the warehouse.",0,1731982156.0,fantasywriters,0,0.5,False

I am hoping sharing this will help someone! I'd even love any ideas you may have too.

I am not promoting myself and I will not post any links in this post.

  
I've worked remotely since 2017, and have spent the last couple of years working for myself. It's incredibly difficult especially since I get so easily distracted. Working from coffee shops either goes really well or I get triggered and I am put out the rest of the day.

I'm never late for client work, but when it's side projects or getting new clients, it takes me SO long to do one task. 

  
I also don't have a manager to report to, so the pressure of having to answer to someone isn't there. I also hate being micromanaged.

  
My days have consisted of me trying to work ALL day, then finally getting around to it around 4-5pm. Then getting distracted. Then being up until 2am-3am.

  
I cannot to that anymore. Body doubling works the best for me but most of the people I know don't have the same goals or challenges as I do. It's really hard to find someone to commit.



 So here's what I am doing to fix it.

  
I am (and have) started streaming everyday. It's day 3.  I am doing a work/study with me stream where I play Lofi in the background with a timer. Telling myself I would use a timer without being on video wasn't working. I just put it off.

I wish I had a little more social time on my breaks but whatever.

  
Just being on camera is enough to ""force"" me into doing the things I need to do. Both the fun and not so fun detailed tasks that I hate.

Ideally, I want to get to a point where I can interact on breaks and then get back into focus during focus times.

  
Have you tried being on video when you are having trouble getting to work? It might help! 

From a streaming standpoint - have you ever watched a work/study with me stream? What did you like/not like about them?

She wasn't comfortable with it and eventually reported me for stalking. After I tried to confront her, the police were called, and now I'm banned from the center and Cohon.

I am a regular at The Center of Diversity and Inclusion of the university. I love the free coffee, the couches but most importantly, the people. I graduated on August from MISM and as an international student and with no way of making money in the US until I find a job in tech, I decided to stay in Pittsburgh since it is cheap. I am having a hard time (depression and anxiety) so I decided to keep going to the university center to keep myself sane.

Last year I had a crush on this girl who worked at the center part-time as a student. I confessed my feelings and told her we shouldn't be friends, I knew she didn't feel the same way. She ghosted me and when we met at the  center she evaded me as if I had a contagious desease transmitted by eye-contact. I dind't pay any attention and minded my own business, I continued going to the center as it is a safe space for lesbians, I also avoided any event she coordinated to give her own space. Today, more than a year later after I confessed my feelings, the person in charged of the center started asking me a bunch of questions, including what other activies where there for me at the university, she ultimately said this person didn't feel comfortable around me and asked me not to go back to the Center.

I was really upset because this person told her boss and who know how many other people I was going to the center to stalk her. I went to the center to talk to her and she just said she wouldn't talk to me so as stupid as I am I yelled she wasn't a good person and not everything revolved around her. Long story short they called the police (even though they said they wouldn't if I left, which I did) and not only did they banned from the Center but from Cohon too (no idea where am I going to have all you can eat for $10 now)

I feel empty and I just feel is so unfair. ""Winter is coming"" (punch there) and I feel so empty, especially in this weather. No job. No center.  I don't understand how you can treat someone who has nothing wrong so badly",0,1731981651.0,cmu,18,0.38,False

I began working with a couple friends which are the business owners of a new Café. Their goal is espresso and coffee done proper. They've done lots of research into learning how to make good coffee, but I get the feeling we are all still learning as we go.

I worked at Starbucks so my knowledge of preparing espresso was almost nil when I began working for them. I am trying to do my own research and understand better how to prepare espresso so it comes out the best.

My knowledge has come to this for a 2 shot setup:
Find the right grind size for the strain. Too small and your espresso pours too slow and becomes bitter. Too large and your espresso pours too fast which can be watery and sour.
Use the right basket for your portafilter. We've been using a 17g basket for a 18g weigh. We use a device that sifts the grinds and evens out the spacing so there are no large air gaps. Then we use a spreader/tamper, and finally a flash tamper. Wipe off and grinds on the side of the baskets.

I don't really know what the optimal time to pour water through a puck is. One of the machines (LA Marzocco Linea Mini 2023) does a pre infusion which adds 16 seconds before straight pouring. The volume reaches 2oz at around 40-45 seconds. Tried weighing to 36 g (based on the 18g grind) and ended up with 38 seconds.

Are there some critiques to any of this some of you experts can add? Any straightforward video guides that can help me learn more about this?

I wouldn't say we're very close, but we're close enough to the point where I feel comfortable discussing personal topics like relationship details or things I am struggling with, *up until now that is.*

We hadn't spoken for some months now as she lives far away and we only meet up when she comes to town for a specific reason. She mentioned that she recently broke up with her boyfriend who lives in my city, and whom I am mutual friends with, and she wanted to have lunch while she's in town for a couple work related events. She usually would be driven around by her ex, but this time she asked if I could pick her up for our outing as well.

We always hang out in a group setting never one-on-one, which felt *slightly* strange, but nbd, I figured she wanted to talk about her relationship privately with me and possibly life advice as she's turning 30 soon and I'm older her than her.

This wasn't really the case as she didn't really open up about things until I asked her if she wanted to talk about it, emphasizing only if she wanted to. She kept it pretty on the surface and I couldn't shake this feeling of awkwardness as she seemed reluctant to open up deeper about what's been going on her life and when I wouldn't initiate talk, she had a nervous look on her face like she was struggling to come up with something to say, so I kept the conversation going by opening myself up, sharing what's been going on and asking her friendly questions, etc.

After lunch, we headed to another location in another part of town to grab coffee, conveniently located to a class she'll be teaching later that day, so we headed there. I paid for our drinks and then she started asking me about my work. I currently have a good job that i'm happy at, and she started opening up about how she's unhappy with her current place of work and began to ask me about how I like my job. I explain and she continues to ask about the department I'm in, what other departments are like, how people I know got their positions at the place as well, and told her she could be a really good fit for this other department since her skillset is strongest in the work they do. Her mood instantly changed and she was excited, jovial. I continued to explain that my department wouldn't be a great fit for her since we don't specialize in that skillset and she interrupted me and said ""Oh, I don't mind doing boring work either!""

I mentally clocked that, then tried to end the conversation by sharing a job posting for a position that just opened up in that specific department, to which she asked ""Can you recommend me?""

I kindly said no and tried to change the subject. Her mood seemed pretty high for a bit, but as the conversation tapered, she reverted to her previous mood earlier in the day. I felt uncomfortable and sick to my stomach so I told her I had to leave and we exchanged a friendly goodbye.

**I keep questioning my thoughts and feelings on the interaction, but did she use me to get a job reference and also belittle what I do for work?

Orange Custom Button: You can set 3 actions on it under tap, double-tap and long press. I like and if you use Tasker you can have even more options by customizing a set of actions and exporting them into an App for the Button to trigger

Sorry all, not a comedy post… looking for opinions. Here’s my situation:
- 75” TV (I know, /TVTooSmall… we’ll get a 85”+ in 5 years)
- Everybody in the family watches TV either semi reclined or lying down. My wife and kids on the couch and I’m often on the rug in front of the coffee table
- Back of couch is roughly 9.5 feet from wall, actual eye to center of TV distance is more like 10.5 feet
- When lying on the rug, my eye distance to center of TV is roughly six feet, perfect distance for my FOV preference.

This setup necessitates a TV that’s angled down… I set it for my family, angled down roughly 10 degrees so it’s pointed at the back of couch. I can’t really tilt down or move the TV down much more without the media console blocking my view to the bottom edge of TV.

As set up in the picture, the center of TV is roughly 51” above floor and top of TV edge is around 69” above floor. Our eye level standing up is around 64”/65”.

Will be getting a new wider media console… looking for something below 18” height but hard to find.

You are someone who is happy whenever I will send her coffee or banana bread and never failed to tell the world whenever I do that. Sometimes I'd like to tell you not to tell anyone but I find it cute when I hear you utter my name though.

When I am feeling down you would check me out esp when you  bought me lunch to make things bearable.

We never kissed but whenever you would hug me, I do feel that my world stopped because I was in your arms.

Listen, I have an affliction towards doing anything half-way. I painted a Baneblade for my IG before I even touched a Leman Russ or Rogal Dorn. So, like a crack addict between pay days, the Gladiator Lancer left me wanting more. Enter the Primaris Repulsor Executioner. I wanted to see what kind of quality was achievable within the constraints of a weekend, and write out the process for anyone curious. (I also have a pregnant wife and toddler who can't stand to be away from me, so this is definitely doable.)

The goal-

Have a model that's above tabletop standard complete by Sunday night.

  
Friday-

Bought the kit from my LGS on Friday during lunch. Got home and did family things until about 9pm, when the house got quiet. Assembly and adding details took me until about 11:45pm. Once the model was together, I used Tamiya putty to fill in body line gaps (because my exacto work is shakier than Helen Keller with a coffee). Left the putty to dry overnight.

  
Saturday-

  
This was a process between 9am and 10pm where I wasn't just sitting in the hobby hole all day. I was getting up every few minutes until the kid went down for a nap, and then finally down for the night. BUT a lot of progress was made. The goal was to finish all of my base coats and begin to work on the fun things.

1. Sand off my putty job that looked like termites got a taste of plastic. (45 min)

2. Prime with Vallejo black primer through the airbrush. (5 min)

3. Base coat dark green through the airbrush (5 min)

4. Zenithal with a light green (5 min)

5. Block in reds with brush. (60 min)

6. Block in Metallics with brush (30 min)

7. Highlight reds with brush. (45 min)

  
Didn't manage to get everything I had hoped for, done, but had a functional model.

  
Sunday-

  
The Lord's day is for cramming in everything else.....

  
Again, spent most of the day, but wanted to be able to call it done by 8pm.

1. Edge highlight the greens (omg never again) (180 min)

2. Paint books and purity seals. (30 min)

3. Wash silver with black wash. (10 min)

4. Block in browns with brush. (45 min)

5. Edge highlight browns. (20 min)

6. Paint lenses/ screen white. (15 min)

7. Apply transfers (micro sol stained my paint and I'm feeling vindictive). (45 Min)

8. Dry brush grav pieces with brown. (5 min)

9. Dry Brush grav pieces with highlight. (5 min)

10. Wash gold and flesh with brown/ red mixed wash. (10 min)

11. Apply judicious coat of pigment powder with dry brush (20 min)

12. Air brush yellow over lenses for cheap OSL look. (10 min)

13. Paint rim of base black and not even bother basing it because it's a tank and Gamers Grass is expensive. (2 min)

  
So yeah. Almost 13 hours for a ""nicer than tabletop look"". I'm well aware there are some spots that could be cleaned up, but that wasn't the intention of this. If I had taken my time, it would've been over the course of a week with better OSL, and cleaner edge highlights. I've been contemplating making YouTube videos for a while and wanted to play test a video idea sans the filming and editing.\` Anyway, hope someone finds value in this. I have my DA recipe down to an almost science and can crank ~~my hog~~  out a squad within 10 hours. If you have any feedback, please share (but my daddy left and my ego is fragile).

I haven't seen any in the apartment, but recently I found these coffee like specks in the back of a linen cupboard which has sheets, quilts and towels at the top, books and boxes at the bottom. The droppings were over the books and at the back of the shelf that had the towels/sheets - though I'm still cleaning it out as I allergy wash and dry everything.

Online suggests roach dropping smell, but these really don't. I've made up a mix of borax and peanut butter (and honey to some of it) and put some in the cupboard, kitchen and laundry. But I'm struggling to accept why they would be in there in the first place. All the linen is clean. I don't see droppings in the kitchen (though granted the cupboard is reasonably close to it - but surely there are closer hiding spots).

Does this make sense that I would find roaches in the linen cupboard? Or could it be some other insect?

Also, do you think the borax/peanut butter mix will be enough? I was considering to pick up additional arsenal on my next shop.

I started using dating apps, and went to two dates, one was terrible in 2 hours of awkward silence, another one was better, but we didn't seem to connect. 
So, I'm very much uncomfortable about financial part🙈  so, for one date I kinda suggest walking in the park, just to avoid any payments, but it was too cold. For another one we were meeting in a coffee shop, and I was late, so I just figured he would just take coffee during that 10 minutes I was late for, so I took coffe before finding a guy at the table, and then it was a bit awkward because nope, he didn't take himself a coffee, and he was waiting for me to do it and I kinda understood that if we met first, there would be this super uncomfortable for me situation where he would try to buy me a coffee (plus, he brought me flowers which was very nice, but then I was just feeling super guilty for not wanting a second date). And now with another guy we agreed to go play pool, and I'm terrified in advance about how can it turn out after we are done and need to pay, and how to just naturally split the bill without any discussion, and how big is the probability that he will offer to pay for the both of us and how to avoid it, preferably not saying anything 🙈😅 I'm very sorry, I'm too nervous, overthinking and worrying.",1,1731980205.0,dating,2,1.0,False

Every single time I pullup even if it’s at the expected finish time they act like I’m causing a problem by showing up too soon. Even had them say one time: “Can you please give us more time next time?” I’m not even expecting it to be ready when I showup and don’t understand why they feel like it has to be. Wouldn’t it in theory make it easier than if I just came up and had to list out my items on the spot into the mic rather than just say my name and they get working on it? Sometimes they even make me park and then the person behind me can order a million things through the mic but stay in the line it just doesn’t make sense to me but maybe somebody can shed some light on it.,0,1731979677.0,starbucks,6,0.22,False
1gulhb6,https://www.reddit.com/r/twinpeaks/comments/1gulhb6/all_extra_pain_medication/,[All] Extra pain medication,"In P14, the Experiment, disguised as Sarah Palmer, went to a bar. There was an annoying man credited as Trucker bothering her. It probably was past dinnertime, but she was not just thirsty but also hungry. 

>Sarah: ""I'll eat you.""

Then she did as promised and stove her sharp tongue into Trucker's neck, biting half of it off.

Curiously, [the man seems to have been none other than the mysterious Billy](https://www.reddit.com/r/twinpeaks/comments/1gjrutv/all_the_sweeping_man/) who had gone missing. We did also meet another man directly called as Billy when a highway patrolman credited as First Trooper went to investigate Mr C's trashed Lincoln Town Car in P3. Like Trucker in the bar, the trooper was hit by some sudden impact, falling on his fours.[ ](https://www.reddit.com/r/twinpeaks/comments/1gjrutv/all_the_sweeping_man/)

>Second Trooper: ""What the hell, *Billy*?""

His partner helped Billy back to their car. He was last seen leaning on its hood.

[Billy was on the stove, and she stove right in him.](https://preview.redd.it/lv7misuzbr1e1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4dc6363f0249e7d1c3b7753dd6267829e021793e)

The suspected Billy appearing as Trucker and the patrolman called as Billy would get connected by a farfetched third scene, as seems the usual storytelling practice in Return. In P7, Beverly arrived at a house and met a woman credited as Nurse at a door.

>Nurse: ""Dinner is on the *stove*.""

A stove is a metal plate with a heat source below it, like a car's hood that the suddenly ill Billy leaned on. On the other hand, Trucker who ended up as the Experiment's dinner had her sharp tongue *stove* in his neck.

If the Troopers' patrol car was now Tom's stove, the scene in the house should reflect what was going on by the roadside. Another hint of that was given when Beverly called Nurse by her name that was not given in the credits.

>Beverly: ""I'll see you tomorrow, *Marge*.""

The word ""marge"" is a synonym for margin which is another kind of edge, like the edge of the road where Mr C's Lincoln stopped after it flipped around. We'd get back to that edge in a moment.

The shot of Tom Paige sitting in his wheelchair appears to have been put together like a fine Renaissance painting, filled with details that didn't lack meaning. Lynch has always rather been a painter than a movie maker, and countless shots in Return have been put together so that we are expected to spend time watching what he has done instead of just letting the show pass by our eyes.

[A fan and a Tom make a Phantom.](https://preview.redd.it/oi215tsbcr1e1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0c360259880338d01175654d07d851dc397918fc)

Both the wrecked car and ailing Tom had *four wheels* under them. Whereas the car had a *gas* tank, Tom got auxiliary oxygen from a *gas* cylinder. There were *two round* pressure gauges to his left, linking to the Lincoln's round dashboard clock and cigarette lighter that were repeatedly shown in extreme closeups when Mr C fell ill while driving. 

We also got an extreme shaky-cam closeup of the car's air-conditioning panel. Tom was *sitting* in a wheelchair while the panel had several icons of a *seated person*. On the left, there was an icon for the car's *fan*. To the right, there was a button labelled as ""DUAL"". Respectively, to Tom's right, there was a pair a bellows, a kind of *fan*, while the name Tom itself is short for Thomas that means ""twin"", another word for *dual*. The shape of the windshield defrosting icon was also repeated in the fireplace *arch*.

In a drastic twist, as it seems, **the wrecked car would now have appeared as Tom**, sick and suffering. Billy the patrolman who had leaned into the car would have been the dinner waiting on the stove, to be tasted in the bar after another extreme transition.

We might find the car aka Tom Paige also in the bar. When Bartender was shown for the first time, he was framed together with *four round stools* that could have reflected the four wheels of Tom's chair and the black Lincoln. He was quite a bit bulkier than Tom, perhaps because of all that gas from the cylinder. 

[All that gas got him back on his feet.](https://preview.redd.it/39g1v6iucr1e1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=27563ebd7ce5e326d56ca045f6ad276f27651b00)

Other details supported this conclusion. The colors of Tom's bedsheet stripes were repeated on Bartender's shirt while the bed's wooden foot end was similar to the bar's counter in front of him. The bushy and greyish plant was reflected in Bartender's unkempt hair and beard.

This furiously shapeshifting character's later developments apparently got increasingly worse as he seems to have soon thereafter [lost his head](https://www.reddit.com/r/twinpeaks/comments/1g35kwz/all_turning_cartwheels/), shown to us as [the explosion of another car](https://www.reddit.com/r/twinpeaks/comments/1gbo8uk/all_dna/), the white Ford. While the decapitated corpse would have been found in Ruth Davenport's bed, [the man's missing head would have turned up as the penny](https://www.reddit.com/r/twinpeaks/comments/1ggzpwy/all_darlene/) picked from the road by an unnamed Girl. 

This would then link back to Mr C's car. A penny has President Lincoln on it while the car's clock face was another round item with ""LINCOLN"" on it. The implication was that at least in the highway scene, the black Lincoln Town Car was not only this same man but Mr C was literally face to face with him, **the clock being an extreme abstraction of his head**, at this time still attached to the man.

It is a slow crawl to make sense who these characters lost in Lynch's dreamland really were. Like u/raspfan realised, the combination of a *fan* and *Tom* probably indicated the presence of [the Phantom](https://inland-empire.fandom.com/wiki/The_Phantom) brought over from [Inland Empire](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0460829/) to Twin Peaks, the presence of this supernatural antagonistic illusionist further emphasized by the metal *pole* holding his IV infusion bottle framed in between them, in likely reference to the Phantom's alternate identity as a jealous *Pole*, a Polish man. This idea was further emphasized by Tom's jealous behavior about Beverly's doings.

[Tom got some real extra pain and sorrow.](https://preview.redd.it/wzpon483er1e1.jpg?width=1008&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=061f2117811b35d8f201908c645ba5dc405cea48)

When Mr C fell ill in the car, he threw up violently before losing his consciousness. What splattered all over the car looked like garmonbozia introduced in *Fire Walk with Me*, creamed corn used as a peculiar abstraction for ""pain and sorrow"". Its impact was likened to gas when Second Trooper called for help.

>Second Trooper: ""We need an ambulance. And tell them to bring *gas* masks. There is something bad in this vehicle.""

Apparently, Tom's dinner had been cooked with this gas, suggesting it aided Billy's transformation to Trucker. An abstraction of Mr C's corn vomit showed up in the shape of Tom's lap rug that was hanging over the left armrest, on the same side of the ""vehicle"" that the doppelganger threw up on.

Since the word ""rug"" sounds the same as ""drug"" and Tom's lap rug was hinted to be ""pain and sorrow"", there probably was a link here to what Nurse had administered to him.

>Nurse: ""He's better, but *I* had to give him *extra pain medication*.""

[If you sleep on the marge, you might wake up as Marge.](https://preview.redd.it/sxe9wu0ier1e1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c2ce83d4a15b55a0cc71e4d468e24a5d2f30241f)

This suggested another sharp twist. Since Mr C passed out right at the edge of the road, having vomited his garmonbozia on the car, the nurse called as Marge - the margin - having administered some ""extra"" pain medication to Tom was none other than the character who had possessed the otherwise mindless doppelganger. This would align with [the idea](https://www.reddit.com/r/twinpeaks/comments/1d4kbtc/all_carsick/) that **this Mr C and thus also Nurse's character was Special Agent Tammy Preston**, having now parted ways with the doppelganger. Like Albert reminded Cole in P4, Tammy got *carsick*.

There was also a fairly direct hint about Nurse and Mr C being connected. Beverly's house number 16832, briefly visible next to Nurse, may have been intended as a pointer to P16 at 8:32, a shot of the remote hillside when Richard was burning on a rock. Mr C should have been standing right there in the middle of the shot but he was *nowhere to be seen*, the inconsistency possibly used to suggest we needed to think about him and Nurse.

[She had a bit of a rough Dale earlier but he's gone now.](https://preview.redd.it/9npagctyer1e1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7339ff2cc95142eb1ea465e864201629d18a0b4d)

As for what happened to the doppelganger who wasn't anywhere to be seen by now, there was a shot of it sitting unconscious in the car before the patrolmen arrived, but when Billy the trooper leaned in and fell ill, we didn't see what was really going on in the inside. We did get a hint what happened, when his partner walked him to the patrol car.

>Second Trooper: ""*You'll be all right.""*

This was reflected in what Mr C told Andy in P17 when the deputy suggested a cup of coffee.

>Mr C: ""No, thanks. *I'm all right*.""

Moments later in the Sheriff's office, Mr C was lying on the floor, quite dead. However, it wasn't Lucy who shot him because there was only one gunshot. Instead, it looks like [he died because his alter ego Trucker was killed in the bar](https://www.reddit.com/r/FindLaura/comments/1fopoi3/all_67/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), the two sharing a strange connection that would go back to Billy the trooper reaching to Mr C and possibly becoming the vacant doppelganger's new soul.

If Bartender could now be traced to Tom Paige who was sick and suffering because he had been the black Lincoln Town Car that got in an accident, that naturally asks to explain how come he had become a motor vehicle.

The car appeared for the first time when Mr C got its keys from Jack, his garageman. When he opened the car's door just as Jack touched its hood, he realised something and started awkwardly kneading Jack's face like it was dough. This went on for quite a while. Jack didn't say anything and only closed his eyes. Then Mr C stopped, keeping his hand on Jack's face. This was where we got cut off. 

[Jack's head while still on and when it wasn't any more.](https://preview.redd.it/b173iqsnfr1e1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4ed9b3dc2ff1e33214f872c1a25e0182faad1232)

Based on the Buckhorn Coroner Talbot repeatedly calling the headless corpse found in Ruth bed as *John Doe*, Mr C's kneading looked like a hint that Jack's character would sooner or later become headless: Jack is John's diminutive, and the word ""dough"" sounds the same as Doe. 

Later on the highway, the first shot of Mr C showed him looking unwell. That was followed by the dashboard's clock face coming to focus. *Him and the clock were face to face*, just like him and Jack were earlier.

Elsewhere in P13, Anthony Sinclair went to see Detective Clarke. How their characters would link to all this is something interesting to think about, but for now we'd just need some associations from them. The officer wasn't happy to see Sinclair.

>Detective Clarke: ""'Cause you're a weak fucking coward. *It makes me sick just to look at you.*""

Just as Mr C appeared from behind the hill, his car was framed together with a sign warning about horseback riders. A kind of horseback rider is a cowboy an earlier word for which was a *cow ward*, a job that was looked down upon to the degree that it became an insult, *coward*.

Like Detective Clarke and the warning about a horseback rider hinted, **Mr C got sick because he was looking at a certain face in front of him** \- the clock face. 

In the middle of the clock's face are its hands. The time was 2:53. The position of the hands roughly reflected Jack's squeezed lips when Mr C stopped kneading his face. The shape of Jack's coverall's collars was also reflected in the decorative elements on both sides of the clock. In between Mr C and Jack, there was the Lincoln's door. 

[My Pole is always with me. Sometimes ahead. Sometimes behind. Sometimes to the left. Sometimes to the right. Sometimes a pool.](https://preview.redd.it/v06r7hrzfr1e1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fae9be9e5b028be50ca0101cf5f7387060dc2bbe)

In other details to pay attention to, right behind Jack, there was a yellow *pole*, probably **indicating the presence of the Phantom** \- the Pole - like the metal pole next to Tom did. Its possible counterpart would have appeared in the bar as the green pool table - words ""pole"" and ""pool"" being homonyms - framed together with Bartender and bridged by the green display element of the same shape in the car's dashboard in between the fan and DUAL buttons like the metal pole was between the pair of bellows and Tom.

Where this would be heading was that as Mr C stop kneading Jack's face, there would have been another sudden jump to a new story: in this one, **Jack was the black Lincoln Town Car** and Mr C its driver, the two still facing each other as Jack's face would now have been the dashboard's clock. But while Jack - apparently aided by the Phantom - was able to make the other one sick simply by Mr C looking at his face, that wasn't enough to avoid a serious beating that left the car - and thus Jack himself - badly bruised. But his head would still have been attached to him, and as Mr C fell unconscious, Jack could slip away to another story, on the run for an unknown reason.

In ""Jack"" and the Phantom, we apparently had two inexplicably intertwined characters, a common theme in Lynch's works: a man and the worse version of himself.

IF MR. QI HAS NO HATERS, I AM DEAD. I just finished the Mr. Qi Fruit Challenge - shipping 500 of his dumb little smirking fruit.

  
I was tempted because the reward was 100 gems. I thought, okay -- find, grow, propagate and sell 500 plants in 14 days? No biggie.

  
JFC was I wrong... First of all. I spent MILLIONS trying to find those little seeds. Once I ran out of trees to chop down in the world, I switched to the mines, buying hundreds if not thousands of bombs, only to find 1, maybe 2 seeds per floor. And I would LEVEL these floors. Not a single stone unturned.

  
Next - I dug up SO MANY OF MY ANCIENT FRUIT TO MAKE SPACE FOR THESE SEEDS. My ancient fruit farm on Ginger Island is decimated, I have to start all over. 

  
I quickly ran out of bones, so I had to start buying instead of making speed gro fertilizer - MORE MONEY SPENT on this man.

  
I missed Feast of the Winter Star to complete this quest! Poor Gus, he never got a present. And my poor family - my wife, Haley, my two kids, my four pets and my horse - all neglected for two weeks.

  
When I finally dug up 500 of those stupid little smirking Qi fruit heads and shipped them, what was my reward? Oh yeah, FIVE HUNDRED GOLD COINS. EACH FRUIT WAS WORTH ONE COIN. MILLIONS SPENT FOR 500 COINS!

  
Okay, I guess I also get 100 Qi Gems but JFC I'll just stick to buying 600 coffees and turning them into freshly brewed espresso next time...

1gul4k1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1gul4k1/what_i_thought_was_going_to_be_my_happily_ever/,"What I thought was going to be my happily ever after, quickly turned into my worst nightmare.. ","It started out like a scene from some dreamy romantic movie. I was in the cereal aisle, reaching for the last box of Cinnamon Toast Crunch, and her hand brushed mine as she reached for it too. I looked up to find myself staring into the warmest brown eyes I’d ever seen. She laughed, the sound soft and musical, and said, “Guess we’ve got the same taste.” She had this easygoing confidence, like she wasn’t a stranger but someone I’d known forever.

Her name was Kate. She was beautiful in that effortless way, with a quick smile and this energy that seemed to light up the air around her. Over coffee, I learned she was smart, funny, with a way of looking right at you like you were the only person in the room. That day led to a second date, and a third, until days turned into weeks, and I was hooked.

She had a mysterious edge, though, something she didn’t fully reveal. It was in the way she talked about her family, this tight-knit group of women who lived on a “homestead” tucked deep in the woods. “It’s like a haven,” she said. “No noise, no distractions. Just peace.” She smiled, but her eyes had this far-off look, like she was seeing something I couldn’t. Then, one night, she asked me to visit the homestead with her. She wanted me to “see her world,” as she put it. I didn’t hesitate—I would’ve followed her anywhere.

The drive was longer than I expected, and the forest seemed to close in tighter around us the further we went. We finally turned down a dirt road that snaked through dense trees, branches scraping against the car windows. It was almost dark when we reached the homestead, a cluster of cabins that seemed to appear out of nowhere, nestled deep in the shadows of the trees.

I’d expected some idyllic little village, but this place felt wrong, oppressive, like the air was thick with something unseen. Women stood in front of their cabins, watching as we pulled in, their expressions unreadable. Kate led me inside one of the larger cabins, handed me a cup of tea. I took a sip, but it tasted strange, metallic and bitter. The room spun, my vision blurred, and the last thing I saw was Kate’s face, her smile melting into a cold, unfeeling stare.

When I woke, I was lying on a cold, damp stone floor. My wrists were bound behind my back, my head pounding as I tried to focus. The room was dark, the air thick with the smell of mold and something metallic… something like blood. I struggled, called out, but my voice echoed back, hollow and empty. Then I heard a low, rattling breath from somewhere nearby.

“Quiet. Don’t draw attention to yourself,” came a voice, barely more than a whisper.

I twisted, straining to see, and finally spotted him—a man slumped in the corner, his face battered and bruised, his eyes hollow with terror. He looked at me, his gaze a mixture of despair and something else… recognition.

“They got you too,” he rasped, his eyes locking onto mine, then shifting, almost fearfully, toward the door.

“What… what is this place?” I managed, panic clawing up my throat.

He shook his head, voice trembling. “She told you her name was Kate, didn’t she?” He laughed bitterly, his voice like sandpaper. “Yeah, that’s what she told me too. Kate, Ashley, Mary… she’s used them all. It’s not her real name. None of them are real.”

A chill crept up my spine. I tried to argue, to defend her, but his eyes held a look that crushed every word before it formed.

“She and the others bring men here,” he continued, his voice hollow. “They lure us, charm us, bring us here like lambs to the slaughter. I’ve been here for days, maybe weeks… watching them kill.”

I barely had time to process his words before the door creaked open. Kate walked in, but she wasn’t the woman I’d fallen for. She was cold, her eyes as dark as the shadows pressing in around us. Two other women followed her, their faces as blank and hollow as hers. They grabbed the man, dragging him out of the room. His screams started almost immediately, desperate and raw, growing fainter until there was only silence.

When they brought him back, he was nothing more than a lifeless shell, his face twisted in horror. I felt bile rise in my throat as I looked away, fighting down the panic, trying to keep control.

Hours passed, maybe days. I barely ate, barely slept, every sound from above making me flinch, my mind unraveling as I waited for them to come back for me. I thought about my family, my friends, anyone who might notice I was gone. But the days kept dragging on, and my hope was slipping away.

Then, one night, a new prisoner arrived, a man no older than me, his eyes darting around like a trapped animal. I watched him, hoping he had a plan, but he was as lost as I was. And then, one night, he snapped. I watched as he managed to loosen his bindings and dashed for the door, his footsteps frantic as he bolted down the hall. I heard him shout as he made it to the clearing outside… followed by a single, echoing gunshot. His body hit the ground with a dull, final thud.

And then there was silence.

I’d given up. There was no hope, no escape. I was weak, broken, waiting for the inevitable. But then, in a desperate flash, I remembered my smartwatch. I must have triggered the emergency alert when I’d thrashed against my restraints. It was a long shot, but it was all I had.

I drifted in and out of consciousness, time slipping through my fingers. And then, faintly, I heard the sound of sirens in the distance. My heart hammered as red and blue lights flashed through the cabin windows, the harsh beams cutting through the darkness. Shouts erupted outside, doors splintered open, footsteps thundered above me. And then, hands were on me, lifting me, carrying me out.

As I stumbled out of the cabin, I looked back, and there she was—Kate, or whatever her name was. She stood in the shadows just beyond the reach of the lights, her expression as empty as the forest around her, her eyes meeting mine with a look that chilled me to the bone. She watched me as they led me away, and then she vanished into the trees.

The police found nothing but the empty cabins when they returned; Kate and the others had vanished without a trace.

I’m back in the city now, safe, but I still can’t shake the feeling that it’s not over. Late at night, I catch glimpses of her in crowds, feel her eyes on me from across a crowded street, see her smile in strangers’ faces. And I know, one day, I’ll turn around, and she’ll be there—waiting, ready to lure her next victim into the darkness.",6,1731978599.0,nosleep,0,0.81,False

1gul07i,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1gul07i/am_i_getting_playedused/,Am I getting played/used?!,"Hey everyone,

I'm a university student (late 20s) and i matched with a girl (early 20) on a dating app. We wrote to each other pretty consistently (every 1 or 2 days for an answer) across 2-3 weeks and we both are looking for something short-term. I asked pretty early on for a meetup in person. Initially we had some scheduling problems regarding the date (i had to reschedule the date 2 times! She even suggested some nice events!). We finally got around and meet up last week for the first time. We first went to a café and afterwards took a short walk across the town and then hit a bar in the evening. In total we spend the whole afternoon up to midnight when the bar closed together. I really had fun on this date, but there are some things that bug me. At first she wasn't really that talkative, especially in te cafe. In the bar she loosened up and talk some more. Her body language though was always more distanced, she never really turned to me, only turned/looked at me with the upper body/head, her legs where always turned to the bar counter. During our conversation whe also talked about past and current relationships. She told me that she has apparently an fwb, but more the benefits part than the friend part (i personally would describe it as a fu*kbuddy, if this is allowed to say). I then asked her why she meet up with me and how long her fwb has been going on. She told me, that the fwb is pretty fresh and not as long going than our match on the dating app (so she has known me longer than the fwb). After our date both went home together (we linked arms and hugged goodbye), she clearly stated that she had no interest in staying at my place for the night, and therefore we parted ways at my place and she went back home alone (she lives not too far from me and she did not want me to accompany/bring her home, which i offered). She texted me that she arrived safe at home and told me that she hadnfun today and thinks that i am a charming person, which she liked. I also want to note, that i payed for the entire date (coffee & bar tap) as a makeup for the past reschedule of the date.

The next day we continued writing on the dating app and she made it clear that she was not looking for an fwb with me, just a friendship, which i am dine with. She also offered me her WhatsApp first! And we later on agreed to meet up again on the weekend to go party in a local club (i had free entry tickets, which i brought up in the bar conversation). The conversation dried up a bit, especially on the day where we wanted to go to the club and she only wrote me at the evening if i still had entry ticket for the club, since she and her friends where running late and couldn't get into the during the ""free entry"" time. This gave me the feeling that she was just using me for the tickets.

I looked the tickets up and saw that the tickets where expired and told her so. At first she didn't answer and i went into the club alone with one of my friends. During the evening i asked her again if she will be coming anyways and she actually did. So we meet up in the club and she introduced me to her 3 friends (1 girl and 2 guys). We had a lot of fun in the club and i also where alone with her on the dancefloor for some time and infelt that we where actually pretty vibing together (i also aked her jokingly how her online dating is going and if she had found anything for after the club, which she declined and that it is not going well. We have joked about this before on WhatsApp). I also used the chance to talk to her friends (the guys) during the evening and tried to get some information from them on how much of the stuff she told me during the bar evening was true. Both of the guys told me that they she was single and had no one meeting up with her. Now here are some more things that bug me: she again does not allow much physical intimacy besides hugging and the sort. Even offering to show/teach her dance moves like the salsa basic step got shot down (which has no physical closness). The second thing is, that she herself told my friend in private, that ""i am hers for tonight"". (and he told me this the next day). Well, we stayed in the club until it closed down at 5 in the morning and went home. During this time one of the guys, who is married, went already home. So in the end we were only me, my ""date/friend"", my guy friend, the female and the ither guy friend of my ""date/friend"". On our way home the female friend went with my friend to spend the night together. So we went to the nearest bus stop where my ""date/friend"" wanted to take the bus home. We talk about the night and about our friends crashing at each other and i vented abit about my frustration with my guy friend that he always has so much luck with getting women. She then told me that i could have had her, if i just had made a move. She also told me that i could also have had a threesome with her friend and my friend if i would be up to it, which i declined, since i am not interested in this. I told her that her friend is nice, but i prefered her instead. But I also told her that i respect her decision, that she doesn't want to do something with me. This entire conversation was happening while waiting for a bus, but she and the other guy friend agreed to just take the car home (i did not know that they came by car), which was actually parked back at the club. So we walked back to the club and she linked arms again with me but stopped shortly after. During the entire time the guy friend played wingman for me and tried to persuade her to go with me and crash at my place (i only could make it out partly due to them speaking in a foreign language which i know very lottle of, but it was very obvius from the way her friend talked to her). While i appreciate the guys effort to get us together, it was not sitting right with me and i told her that i am aware of what her friend tries to do and that it he doesn't has to do this. Also note, that she was very adamant on not going with me home! Well after we arrived at the car she went sitting on the passenger seat, the guy was driving and i was on the backseat. They drive me home, where she ushered me out of the car very fast and them they drove of. After i was back in my flat we continued to write a bit. I told her that i am bit disappointed in the way she treated me in the end (i went a bit overboard, but no swearing), which she closed with some, for me harsh wording too, and wished me a good night in a sarcastic ""tone"". Which i have to say, made me feel even more frustrated at her behaviour.

Anyways, on the next morning i wrote her an apology for the way i wrote to her. The communication switched really fast back to a carefree friendly way and we continued writing to each other in a 5 to 10 minutes interval all throughout the day and even sent some pictures to each other from what we were doing. I invited her to meet up on the next weekand for some event, which she agreed to come to (she is also meeting some female friends of hers on the same day and still wants to come to the event). She also invited me and my guy friend again to join them in a bar on the same evening, which we had to decline due to lectures on the next morning. She reacted on my rejection with a ""😢"" (i also deleted the match on the app, since we are already writing on WhatsApp, which she found surprising and funny ""😂"").
I also asked her on the evening if they went to the bar, but she gave me not much reaction. And she didn't answer until the next morning. I just so happen to have found another event in the December which i send her and she again agreed to participate with me! So we have 2 other meetings coming up. After she agreed the chat went dry and we havent written to each other all day, she very rarely initiates the texting.

And this is the end for now...

For me this all seems a bit toxic and like a game of hot/cold and I can't really gauge her interest on how to interpret all of this. therefore I have chosen for now to lay low and not initiate the contact to see if she actively is interested in maintaining the contact as friends. I just fear that she may be playing with me emotionally and just trying to get her emotional needs? meet, which she doesn't from her fwb. (If she even has one that is?!). This all is really messing with my head and drains a lot of energy... 
So i am really grateful for any insight/experiences on what you people see in all this...

Long story short, she’s looking for community creative and cultural spaces (3rd spaces). I’m asking on her behalf to assist with the transition and provide options to her while she adjusts. 

I’m looking for art galleries, art communities, coffee classes, and poetry related events. Any and all things that are rooted in the arts and can serve as restorative rest and rejuvenation.

1gukyys,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1gukyys/almost_final_month_of_the_year/,Almost final month of the year.,"It's almost the end of the year, and after reading one post here about why 2024 feels off more for many of us, it's because it does. After pondering for quite some time during my downtime overviewing some well-known volcanic lake scenery, here are my thoughts.

Reflecting on 2024 feels like carrying the weight of unfulfilled expectations and the bittersweet pang of endings I wasn’t ready for. It’s as if every door that closed left a draft that chills my resolve. Sometimes, I wonder if the heaviness is just time reminding me how fragile dreams are. 

2024 doesn’t feel like it’s moving forward; it feels like it’s dragging me sideways. Progress feels false, as though I’m stumbling through moments that aren’t mine to claim.

Bears don’t carry their struggles into hibernation. They find a dark, quiet space and let the world move on without them for a while. What if I could do that? Sleep through the noise, the heartbreak, the endless carousel of things demanding my attention?

I also have something to say to certain people/incident in my life that are what I consider part of what shaped my 2024.

**Osk...**  
First off, fuck you, lmao. Despite our differences after that tragic venture of yours that put me in a rabbit hole so deep, I could figuratively see the mantle of the earth. I can't stay mad at you, lol. Hop in to discord some time and start speaking Tagalog again with that funni EU accent.

**J...**  
To begin again. There's always not enough words for me in the dictionary to describe what I always feel about you, but I did my best to compress it via my unsent letter. That small reconnection was fun! I wish it would happen again, but that's a moonshot. Regardless, I'm always proud and will be supportive of your decisions as always, and nothing would ever change. Never forget that ""flowchart"" I sent you in case you yap again about ""you're not hard to love"" or ""you'd move on easily."" I promised myself that you'd be the last person to see that version of me, and it's now an empty husk, not because of bad faith; it's because that version of me was so sickeningly sweet, it'd cause insulin shots, lol. I could keep reiterating what I've said on that letter of mine since it feels like we're sown together; you're born to mesmer, and at this point, I don't mind getting stuck on rewind. I'm going through stages, like roaming through pages, **誰もが自分を見失う そんな時は日々の喧騒から離れて 見渡せばそこにはほら今の 君が映るから**. I lost myself through that ecstacy and I don't have any regrets. 

**To M..**  
While I did explain my piece and you found it in a very unsatisfactory state, that is the truth, without any modifications whatsoever, and you're right, I was trying to be considerate of what you feel and what you're going through; it felt unfair when I suddenly told you that I'm interested in someone, J... and I was really surprised at how and why you reacted that way. In my defense, my intents were clear that we were good friends and have not made any assumptions dati, but perhaps I should've. Please know that I've no facade when it comes to our friendship, but you be well.

 **To the two cats I lost. Buchok and coffee butternut.**

**Buchok**, you prick, we would've visited the vet, but you ran away; now I am unable to locate you. Who's going to annoy me and push things til fall on the table now? Regardless of all the expensive destruction you caused with my equipment, lol, I'd still want you to come back. If you're still out there, I hope some telepathic 4th dimension entity sends you this message, but if you're out on the rainbow road already, know that you're part of my family, and I hope you felt loved.

**Coffee,** while you're a neighbor's cat, categorically, know that I treated you as one of the cats I own. Your masungit and shy nature is in contrast with your brother Cheddar, and I'm sorry that your time to enjoy this world is cut short. I promise I will take care of your clingy brother Cheddar, and I hope you were happy during the time you spent in our garage.

**And finally to everyone who's suffering the same affliction of a shitty 2024 and wasn't able to find what they desire.**

Dude and dudettes, to all who felt the crushing weight of 2024 pressing down like an unrelenting tide: tomorrow is another day. It waits beyond the veil of this moment, untouched by today’s anguish, unscarred by the wounds you carry. No matter how broken the night feels, the dawn will come—not to erase the pain, but to remind you that nothing, not even despair, holds dominion forever. Tomorrow is a silent promise, whispered by the universe itself: that even in your darkest hour, the story is not over. Keep breathing. Keep holding on. Tomorrow may yet bring the light you’ve forgotten how to seek.

It’s worth reflecting on the staggering speed at which we, quite literally, traverse the cosmos. The Earth hurtles around the Sun at an average speed of 107,000 kilometers per hour, completing its orbit in just one year. But that’s not all—our entire solar system is racing through the Milky Way at a mind-bending speed of about 828,000 kilometers per hour, making its grand galactic circuit over the course of roughly 230 million years. Even as our personal worlds feel slow and burdened, we are part of this immense, relentless motion. These cosmic velocities remind us that stagnation is an illusion. The Earth never pauses; the solar system never hesitates. Similarly, even when life feels heavy and static, we are always moving—forward, outward, toward something greater, even if we cannot yet see it.

I am not invalidating your struggles, your emotions, your heartbreaks, your failures, and your pain. Let me say this: your struggles are real, your pain is valid, and the fight you’re enduring is not insignificant. You are allowed to feel overwhelmed, to feel tired, even to feel lost in the midst of it all. But remember this—you have made it this far, through storms you thought you wouldn’t survive, through nights that felt eternal.

I’m not your average 30-year-old—I’ve smoked more weed than most people have in their entire lives, done so many drugs people I’ve known since high school bump into me and ask, “How are you still alive, man?!” But I’m still here, healthy, because I’ve lived life the way it’s meant to be lived: to the fullest. I never worked a day in my life. I’ve spent my time partying, playing video games, and just chilling. I was a state-caliber wrestler in high school—2nd place, close to winning states—but let’s be real, I wasn’t trying to make it my career. After high school, I went on to get my black belt in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, competed in kickboxing, fought in pro MMA. I’ve traveled to every dream vacation spot I ever wanted. If I die tomorrow, I’d be happy. I've done it all, man. I’ve lived a life most people can only dream of. Now, I’ve got a bunch of money, thanks to my inheritance. My parents used to run a martial arts school that they left to me when they passed 10 years ago. But the thing is, I haven’t touched it for a while because I wanted to keep it a respected community space. Recently though, I turned it into an ""amateur fighting promotion."" I’ve got school teachers, homeless people, all kinds of people stepping into the ring, and they’re getting paid. I can afford it. I’ve got money for the next 20 years, at least.
Here’s the thing. I ran into my old friend (let's call him Mark) while getting coffee the other day. Haven’t seen him since high school graduation, and he’s just... lost. He’s working a dead-end office job, barely scraping by. When I bumped into him, I could tell he wasn’t living. So, I did what any good friend would do—I offered him a way out.
I told him, “Dude, you’ve got the potential. I can train you full-time, get you into the fight game.” And I’m not talking about just some amateur stuff. The kid’s got what it takes to go pro. But guess what? He’s too much of a coward to take the leap. He’s 120 lbs soaking wet, but he’s smashed  this one 180-pounder in my promotion before. He even won first place in a grand prix I threw, walked away with a huge payday. He made more money in one night than he’s ever made. But instead of seeing it as an opportunity, he calls me a jackass. He says I’m just using him for my own amusement. But the way I see it, I’m trying to help him out. I’m trying to give him a way out of being stuck in this mundane life. I’m even helping this homeless guy who won a bonus, sent him home to his family with a set of new rims. I’m trying to change lives, man.

So, AITA for pushing my friend to get out of his loser mentality and take a shot at something better? I don’t think so, but let me know

Every morning, she sipped her coffee by the window, watching the world wake up. The same café. The same cup. The same view of the city skyline. It was in this comforting rhythm that she first saw him—Eli, with his tousled hair and a notebook tucked under his arm, always arriving at precisely 8:15. He never looked her way, but she noticed everything about him. The way he always ordered a black coffee, the way he scribbled furiously in his notebook, as though he were trying to capture something fleeting.

She’d always been too shy to speak to him, too content with her quiet observations. But over time, the space between them seemed smaller. She caught glimpses of his writing, a phrase here and there that seemed strangely intimate, even though they weren’t meant for her eyes. She knew nothing of his life, yet somehow, she felt connected to him in a way she couldn’t explain.

One morning, after weeks of silent longing, she made up her mind. She walked up to the counter, ordered her usual, and took the seat across from him. His eyes flicked up in surprise, but he said nothing, only returned to his writing.

“Do you mind if I join you?” Maya asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

Eli paused, then nodded, still unsure, but intrigued. It wasn’t the reaction Maya expected, but it was enough.

“I’m Maya,” she said, feeling a blush creep up her neck. “I’ve seen you here before, and I—well, I was wondering what you’re writing.”

Eli hesitated, his eyes scanning her face as if measuring her sincerity. Finally, he sighed, closed the notebook, and pushed it toward her. “It’s not much,” he said quietly. “Just... thoughts.”

Maya opened the notebook. The words were fragmented, raw, beautiful. They spoke of dreams and loss, of longing for something that could never be. She was captivated. “It’s amazing,” she said softly, not sure if he would believe her, but knowing it was the truth.

Eli looked at her, his face a mixture of disbelief and something else—something guarded. “I didn’t think anyone would ever care about it.”

Maya smiled gently, realizing how much she had in common with him. She, too, kept her thoughts hidden, afraid of what would happen if anyone saw them.

The next morning, Eli wasn’t at his usual spot. Neither was his notebook. Maya felt a pang of disappointment but tried to push it aside. Maybe he was just running late, or maybe—she had no idea.

Days passed, and Maya kept returning to the café, waiting for him to appear, but he never did. The unease in her chest grew with each passing day. She considered reaching out, but how? What could she say?

On the fifth day, a small envelope appeared on her usual table. Her name was scrawled across the front, and her heart raced as she opened it.

Inside was a single sheet of paper, handwritten:

“I never thought I would meet someone like you. The notebook is yours now. Maybe you’ll write something better than I ever could.""

Maya’s hands trembled as she read the last line. She stood up, glancing around the empty café, but there was no sign of him. The space where he had sat was now cold and vacant. A wave of longing washed over her, mingled with confusion. Had she misread everything? Had she imagined a connection that wasn’t really there?

As she turned to leave, a voice called her name. ""Maya, wait.""

She spun around. It was Eli, standing just outside the door, his expression unreadable.

“I—” He stopped himself, running a hand through his hair, looking at the ground. ""I didn’t mean to disappear like that. It wasn’t you, it was me.""

Maya’s heart fluttered. ""I thought... I thought maybe I had misunderstood.""

Eli’s gaze softened. ""No, you didn’t. It’s just… I’m not good at this. At being seen. But when I saw you read my words that day, I realized I wanted you to see more of them. I wanted you to *know* me.""

Maya took a step forward. ""So, what now?""

Eli smiled, a little sad, but genuine. ""Now, I write a new page. And maybe this time, we can write it together.""

Maya felt a warmth spread through her chest. She didn’t have all the answers, but she knew one thing: this wasn’t the end of their story. It was just the beginning.",1,1731978040.0,story,0,1.0,False
