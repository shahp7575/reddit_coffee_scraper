1py8803,https://www.reddit.com/r/MayConfessionAko/comments/1py8803/mca_a_married_man_wants_me_to_be_his_mistress/,MCA A married man wants me to be his mistress,"It started off like the usual. Him asking for a permission to message me, saying he finds me funny and interesting. We were in the same gc of strangers and I thought it would be rude if I turn it down. We started talking about work bec we are at the same field. I remember he didnt reply na that night and it didnt bother me naman.

The next day, he chatted me again, saying sorry that he wasnt able to reply because nakatulog na siya agad. I said keri lang. Then he started complimenting my looks, na ang pretty ko raw. I said filtered kasi mga stories ko and di naman ako pretty talaga (I know I am haha) but he was insisting na he was always looking forward to my stories sa telegram. Tbf, ibang guy talaga ang target audience ko haha. Hinayaan ko na lang siyang icompliment ako. So ayun parang naging daily routine na ung bati niya sa akin. Ako naman is sasagot lang kapag may time. He’d send selfies which I dont find cute pero hina-heart react ko na lang. Then he’d tell me abt his day kahit na wala akong replies. I also noticed na pagka gabi eh offline na siya. 

Tapos sa tg diba may feature ng group call. I’d usually initiate a call with the members kasi wfh ako and nakakabato minsan magwork nang walang kausap. Some of the members na wfh is nakikisali rin naman. We’d have discussions and friendly banters. Lagi siyang nakasali doon altho nakamute lang bec office-based ang work niya. 

One time, nagleave muna ibang members sa call and dalawa na lang kami. He then started speaking and said, “nasa parking pa rin ako kahit 6pm na and 4pm pa ako naka-out.” I asked why and he replied, “nageenjoy kasi akong pakinggan ka. Tuwang-tuwa ako sayo.” Mej naweirdan ako but at the same time, unting kilig. Kako umuwi na siya and he asked if pwede ba kaming mag-usap while he’s driving and I said fine. Idk but siya lang nagsasalita during that 2-hr call hahaha medyo naboringan na rin ako. But kahit papaano naman eh may background sound while working ako so naging productive naman.

After that, and maybe two months na rin when we started talking, when he began inviting me for coffee. I’ve met with the other members but in a group setting and wala siya non. I told him Id prefer if kasama ibang members kasi di talaga ako comfy if dalawa lang kami. He assured na sfw naman and mej napataas kilay ko non hahahha. I rejected his invitations. He became flirty na rin and would say “I miss talking to you.” or “Mahal na ata kita” which I dismiss.

One time, one of the members kinda spilled my dorm’s location and I received a chat from him na he’s waiting sa kanto ng dorm ko and it’s my call if gusto ko siyang kitain. Gusto lang daw niya akong i-hug. I got mad and refused replying to him na. He chatted na he left by 12 midnight. From then on di ko na siya kinausap. Kahit sa gc, he’d always make papansin by reacting to my chats and replying to them para may interaction pa rin kami. Kapag calls, nakikinig pa rin siya. He’d also send food via Food Panda and nalalaman ko lang because the rider keeps on shouting my name. I’d always give it to rider na lang but they would say na bawal iyon. Kung di ko pa siya tinakot na ibablock ko na siya, di pa sya huminto. 

One day, while scrolling sa Linkedin, I got curious and searched if meron ba siyang profile. I just typed his first name, position and company. And voila! Siya yung top result. I know that face bec pag calls eh nakaopen ung camera niya. I immediately searched for him sa facebook and that’s when I saw it. He’s fucking married and they have a child na!!!! Kaya pala pag gabi and weekends, naka-offline siya. That night, I messaged him and just told him everything I am feeling. I was really disgusted with what he did and made me feel. Nagiguilty pa ako bec he’d always wait for me na labasin ko siya tapos kasal na pala si gago. I immediately blocked him.

Then I received a chat from his other tg account. He apologized but told me na he wants to have a relationship with me daw. No remorse with his cheating. He said, “akin ka lang. Ayaw kong mawala ka sa akin.” and “ibibigay ko lahat ng kailangan mo basta please, akin ka lang. Mahal na mahal kita.” I blocked that account rin kaagad. Then nagnotif naman ilang mins sa tiktok ko na he viewed my profile. I checked his tiktok acct and halos masuka ako bec most of them was a video of him and his family. Nandun kung paano siya nagpropose sa asawa niya, how they are as bf/gfs back then and pati anak niya. Kung titignan, mukhang green flag na family guy talaga. Parang di naga-I love you sa ibang babae. 

I just chuckled. He really thinks na kakagat ako sa gusto niyang mangyari. Sa kaniya na nanggaling. I am a pretty lady with a stable career. Why would I get tangled with a married guy who is a 2 at best? The audacity! I immediately told the admin of the group and provided a sneak peak of some of our convo. Agad rin niyang kinausap si guy and removed him sa gc. The admin advised na I reach out to the wife. Ang kaso, locked talaga account ni guy and no other socmed traces. Im still trying sa tiktok if I can get something from it.

For now, ayun nakahinga naman na nang maluwag. I just feel bad tho bec umabot pa ng ganun katagal before I found out na he’s married and with a child. I also feel bad for the wife because she’s being betrayed by her husband and if I make her aware of it, ano kayang magiging step niya bec based on what he shared sa socmed, she’s a housewife and no other family na :< Hayyyy.

“Not for this,” Carter said grimly. “If Azeral makes physical contact with Division Command and captures Kane, we lose. You understand?”

I nodded slowly. “Understood.”

Then, from off screen, a new voice chimed in, young, dry, way too casual for the briefing we were in.

“Hey. Tell them to bring extra snacks too. The apocalypse sucks without jerky.”

I leaned in toward the monitor. “Who the hell was that?”

Alex popped into frame, grinning and leaning on Kane’s shoulder like they were old war buddies hanging out in a break room instead of a war room. “Hi. I control the giant murder dog. I am Alex. Nice to meet you.”

Kane just rolled his eyes.

Carter did not even flinch. “That is Alex. He is essential.”

“Emotionally or tactically?” Nathalie asked.

“Yes,” Carter said.

I could not help the smirk that tugged at my mouth.

Gods, cryptids, rogue timelines, and now a smart mouthed teenager cruising around with an alpha Dogman like it was a service animal.

“Alright,” I said. “We will bring the Halos. We are wheels up in twenty.”

Carter gave a final nod. “HQ will clear airspace for you. See you soon.”

The screen went black.

I turned to Nathalie.

“You thinking what I am thinking?”

She stood and started locking in her exo suit’s spinal harness, the magnets clicking into place down her back. “That if we survive this, I want a week of silence, whiskey, and sleep.”

I chuckled. “Exactly that.”

The VTOL touched down with a hiss of steam and a familiar hydraulic groan. The landing pad smelled like jet fuel, hot metal, and coffee that had been sitting on a burner too long. Black armored Division personnel moved around us like ants, offloading supply crates, rearming bunkers, double checking biometric locks and shouting over each other.

As Nathalie and I disembarked, the rest of our unit peeled off in full Black Halo exo suits. Sleek, reinforced plating, matte finish that drank in the floodlights, the faint shimmer of reactive shielding when they moved. We gave them a nod. They knew the drill. Weapons check. Loadout prep. Stand by for briefing.

We would meet them soon enough.

But Carter had requested us personally.

We cut through the secure hallway toward the upper ops wing. You could feel it even in the recycled air, that heavy pressure before a storm. The atmosphere here was thick, like the walls did not want to hear what was being said inside them. Whatever was coming, everyone here felt it, even if they pretended they did not.

The door at the end of the corridor slid open with a metallic sigh.

Carter stood waiting inside.

Behind him was Kane.

And to Kane’s left, lounging with all the grace of a gremlin that just figured out sarcasm was a weapon, was the teenager from the call, in combat boots and a Division jacket two sizes too big, sleeves rolled up past his wrists.

“Welcome back,” Carter said. “Good time?”

“Uneventful,” I said. “No eldritch monsters. Nice change of pace.”

Nathalie nodded. “Team is unloading. Black Halos are being armed. Now, where is our god?”

Kane looked up, his eyes catching mine. For a moment, there was something in them that made my stomach tighten. Not fear exactly. More like someone who had already lived through the thing we were about to face.

Carter gestured to the table. “Sit. We do not have long before things kick off.”

We dropped into chairs opposite them.

The teenager, Alex, waved lazily. “Hi. I am Alex. Resident monster tamer. Dog whisperer. Apocalypse intern.”

Nathalie raised a brow. “You are the Progenitor handler?”

“Handler is a strong word,” Alex said, smirking. “Let us just say I am the only one he does not try to eat.”

“He obeys him,” Kane added. “And the rest of the Dogmen obey him, as long as the Progenitor is in range.”

I leaned forward. “How close is close?”

Alex shrugged. “That is the fun part. Sometimes five miles, sometimes more. Depends if he is in a mood. Cryptids are emotional creatures apparently.”

Nathalie blinked. “Jesus.”

“Oh, he is not involved,” Alex said. “Not in this one anyway.”

Carter cleared his throat before the conversation could spiral. “Kane has brought you up to speed.”

“Enough to know it is bad,” I said. “But not bad enough for nukes yet.”

Carter’s expression did not change. “Let us keep it that way.”

Kane turned toward us. “We have seen what Azeral can do when he is only partially anchored. Now he is in a body, a vessel that gave permission. We do not know the limits. Only that the Division lost four deep cell teams trying to intercept the first anomaly flare eight miles from here. This is not a containment op. This is a war.”

Nathalie leaned forward, arms folded. “What is the plan?”

Before Carter could speak, Alex raised a hand.

“Can I say it?”

Carter let out a slow breath. “Alex.”

“We fight a god,” Alex shouted, throwing his hands up like he was announcing a movie title, “and hope it dies like a man.”

There was a beat of silence.

Kane did not even blink. “You are really not afraid of dying, are you?”

Alex snorted. “Oh, I am terrified. But everyone needs a hobby.”

I could not help it. I cracked a smile.

Carter stood. “Your squad is gearing up now. We are pulling tanks, a few APCs, awakened assets, and any field agents who are still combat rated. You four are the center. Black Halos are being positioned for surgical strikes if there are creatures that breach the lines.”

“Any intel on the vessel itself?” Nathalie asked.

“Nothing concrete,” Carter said. “We have data coming from the Earth the Herald was sent to. Some of it is corrupted. But we have names, faces, readings from before their Division fell.”

I stood, brushing dust from my fatigues out of habit. “Then I guess we better get ready.”

Alex stood too, stretching until his spine popped. “Cool. Let us kill a god.”

Kane glanced at Carter. “Or die trying.”

ALEX, DIVISION HQ, EASTERN COURTYARD

The hallway leading out to the southern launch pad was lined with reinforced glass and tension. Agents moved past in a rush, clipboards, rifles, half eaten energy bars in hand, all pretending this was just another big operation. Kane and I walked in silence for a bit, boots thudding against polished concrete. The Progenitor stalked behind us like a shadow that learned how to breathe, massive, quiet, calm only because I was.

I glanced up at Kane. Up close, he looked like someone who should have been in a hospital bed with machines doing his breathing. Instead he was here, planning to punch a god.

“So, be honest,” I said. “How strong are you really?”

He looked at me sideways.

“Last time the Division tested it,” he said, “I picked up a twenty ton reinforced cargo truck and threw it through two hangars.”

I blinked once. “Okay. Sure.”

“And I can move faster than most operatives can track.”

I let out a low whistle. “Right, cool. Definitely not compensating for anything.”

Kane did not laugh, but there was the smallest twitch at the corner of his mouth.

“Just so you know,” I added, nudging him with my elbow, “the Progenitor wants to race you when this is over.”

“He wants to race me.”

“Yeah. Tail wag and everything. I do not think he likes not being the fastest murder beast in the room.”

Behind us, the Progenitor let out a short chuff that rattled the glass. It was almost a laugh.

Kane gave a dry chuckle. “Tell him he is on.”

I snapped my fingers. “You hear that, big guy? Start stretching.”

The Progenitor tilted his head, baring rows of teeth in what absolutely counted as a grin, if you ignored the part where that grin could remove a car door.

We reached the garage tunnel. One of the exterior blast doors was already open, night wind spilling through, carrying the smell of pine, wet dirt, and distant smoke. I slung my satchel across my back, the one with the blood scented tags and signal boosters stitched into the lining. Not Division issue. Mine.

Kane stopped me at the threshold. “Where are you going?”

“Scouting,” I said. “If the Progenitor and I can reach the regional packs, we might be able to bring some under control. I can promise loyalty, convince them we are the better option. At least keep them from joining him.”

Kane gave a slow nod. “Be careful.”

I saluted with two fingers. “Always am.”

“Alex,” he added.

I turned back.

“If they turn on you.”

“They will not,” I said, tapping my chest once. “He is in here with me. I trust him more than most people.”

Kane did not argue with that. He just watched as the Progenitor and I moved off into the dark, toward the tree line beyond the landing zones.

The moon hung low and red like it had been watching this place for a while.

And the hunt was just beginning.

KANE, DIVISION HQ, NORTH HALLWAY

I kept walking even after Alex and the Progenitor vanished past the edge of the floodlights. The cold concrete under my boots, the flicker of emergency strips in the ceiling, the distant hum of VTOL engines spooling up, it all blurred behind the one question that had been chewing at the back of my mind since I came back.

Why me.

Carter caught up to me by the elevator. His expression was tight as always, but his posture gave him away. Shoulders a little lower, eyes a little more sunken. He had not slept. That made two of us.

“You holding it together?” he asked.

“Define together,” I muttered, then looked at him. “Can I ask you something?”

“You can try.”

“Why do you never use your Revenant abilities?”

Carter stopped walking.

“I have read the files, and I saw it when I escaped,” I added. “You were Subject Zero. Division’s first test run. You survived. Barely. But you do not fight like it. You act like a handler, not a weapon.”

Carter looked away, jaw clenched. “Because I was a weapon. That was all I was. When they finished building me, they realized they had made a mistake.”

I stayed quiet.

“The version of the serum they gave me did not stabilize,” he went on. “My cells regenerate, yes. My reflexes are enhanced. I can punch through steel and outrun bullets for about three minutes.”

“What happens after three minutes?”

He smiled without humor. “Then I start hemorrhaging from the inside out. Every time I have used my abilities, I have lost weeks, sometimes months, of organ stability. I have to pick my moments, Kane. I do not get to fight like you do.”

That shut me up.

By the time we hit the main entrance, the reinforced blast door was sliding open, and I saw her.

Lily.

Running straight at me.

She hit me hard enough to stagger me back a step, arms wrapping around my torso like she was afraid I would vanish again if she did not hold on. I pulled her in tight and held her there, breathing in the familiar smell of her shampoo and gun oil.

“You are okay,” she breathed. “They said you made it back, but I did not believe it until I saw you.”

“I am here,” I said. “I am not going anywhere.”

Then I saw him.

Shepherd.

He stood just behind her, massive and silent. Taller than me by at least a foot. His skin looked like dried parchment left in the sun too long, cracked and flaking around plates of bone. One arm ended in a fused, blade like appendage. His face was still a nightmare, fleshless, eyeless, steam rising faintly from the sockets like dying coals.

“Still ugly,” I said.

“Still annoying,” he rasped.

We clasped forearms. His grip felt like rebar.

“Thanks for watching out for her,” I said, nodding at Lily.

He gave a faint shrug. “She is smarter than you. Less likely to get herself killed.”

“Good to know where I stand.”

Shepherd tilted his head slightly. “You ready?”

“For what?”

“To try and kill a god.”

I looked into the empty sockets, steam still curling up in thin threads.

For the first time in days, I did not hesitate.

“Yeah,” I said. “Let us go make it bleed.”

We walked in silence for a while after that. The quiet between us was not awkward. It was the kind you get after surviving too many close calls with the same person. There is nothing left to say that does not sound small.

“Think we make it through this?” I finally asked.

Shepherd’s voice scraped like gravel. “Does not matter.”

I shot him a look.

He kept walking. “We will try anyway.”

That was fair.

We were almost to the last corridor before the courtyard when the alarm klaxons kicked in. The sound hit like a knife to the teeth.

Then the AI’s voice spoke, calm and clinical.

“Warning. Cryptid presence detected. Species: Canis Lupus variant. Quantity: approximately two hundred fifty. Distance: one hundred fifty meters from Division HQ main entrance. Hostility status: undetermined.”

I looked at Shepherd.

He was already moving.

By the time we reached the outer blast doors, Carter was there, grim and locked in. Willow and Nathalie came in behind us, helmets clipped to their suits, weapons magnetized to their backs.

Willow was the first to break the silence. “Is that reading accurate?”

Carter did not answer right away. He was staring out through the reinforced viewport above the main barricade, toward the trees pouring down the southern ridge.

Shapes moved in the dark.

A lot of shapes.

Too many.

They moved as one, tight and smooth, no snarling, no lunging. Just shadows slipping forward through brush, deliberate and steady.

Then a figure stepped out in front of them.

Casual. Hoodie unzipped. Hands in his pockets like he was out for a late walk and not escorting a small army.

Alex.

He threw his arms wide, like he was presenting a magic trick, and smirked.

“Hope you all are not allergic to dogs,” he shouted.

The Progenitor padded out beside him, a stalking nightmare in fur and teeth, dwarfing him by two full feet. Behind them, hundreds of Dogmen emerged from the trees. Massive, gray, scarred. Every pair of eyes locked forward.

They stopped just outside the security barrier.

Alex raised a hand and waved lazily. “So. Good news. They are with us. Do not shoot.”

There was a beat of stunned silence inside the room.

Alex scanned the faces through the glass, then spotted Shepherd.

“Holy hell,” he said, grinning. “You are ugly. You look like the inside of a microwave burrito.”

Shepherd let out a low sound. It might have been a laugh.

Alex turned back to Carter and me. “Question, is two hundred forty nine enough, or should I go back and ask for a few more?”

I actually smiled. “That will have to do.”

He gave a mock bow. “Glad to help.”

Then, more serious, Alex raised his voice for the whole line to hear. “They will not attack any humans on our side. You are safe around them. As long as the Progenitor is in range, they are locked in.”

Willow took a slow step forward, helmet tucked under one arm. “You trained two hundred forty nine Dogmen.”

Alex shrugged. “Technically, one. The others just listen to him.”

Nathalie let out a low whistle. “Kid has some talent.”

Carter folded his arms. “Talent and a refusal to stop making bad jokes.”

The Progenitor moved behind Alex, exhaling a low growl that made the reinforced fence rattle.

Alex reached back and gave him a casual pat on the leg. “Down, buddy. We are all friends here.”

I glanced at the army in front of us. Living weapons. Jaws like industrial vices. Claws like butcher knives.

For the first time in days, I felt like we might have a chance.

A small one.

But a chance.

The silence fractured with a sharp klaxon pulse that rattled my teeth.

The AI’s voice followed, neutral and flat, like it was not announcing the end of the world.

“Warning. Dimensional rift detected. Diameter: one hundred fifty two feet. Location: two hundred forty three meters northeast, tree line. Classification: Medium Class Unstable Breach.”

Everyone froze.

Even the Dogmen raised their heads, ears twitching, nostrils flaring like they smelled rot drifting in on a wind that did not exist yet.

Carter was the first to move. “Get me live visuals. Now.”

One of the techs tapped into the surveillance grid. A hologram buzzed to life on the table. Grainy thermal came first, then cleaner visuals. The tree line was splitting.

A jagged oval of nothing opened like a vertical wound in the forest.

Color bled out of it. Reality bent around its edges, warping the trees, flattening depth into a smear of wrong.

The air above it pulsed like it was holding its breath.

Then he stepped through.

Azeral.

Just seeing him made the room feel colder.

Behind him, they came like a tide.

The infected.

Hundreds.

Bodies bloated and pale, limbs distended, joints bent backward. Twisted faces slack with madness. Jaws unhinged. Movements jerky, crawling over each other to push through the rift.

Flesh that should not be alive, but refused to understand it was dead.

Azeral spoke in my head again, smooth as old poison.

“They are not clever. Not strong. But there are a lot of them.”

My fists clenched.

Shepherd stepped up beside me, his blade arm twitching. “Time.”

“Now,” I said.

Willow and Nathalie were already sealing their helmets, their exo suits locking with sharp hydraulic clicks. Nathalie slid a reinforced magazine into her railgun and grinned inside the visor. “Guess we are skipping the warmup.”

Willow barked commands into squad comms. “Formation Beta. Target priority is containment. No civvies out here. No friendly fire. If it moves like meat and smells like rot, drop it.”

“Copy,” her team replied in unison.

Carter did not flinch. “VTOLs armed and airborne, now.”

Engines rumbled overhead, rotors chewing at the air.

Then Azeral laughed.

Not out loud. Just for me.

“You did not think I would come without a surprise,” he murmured inside my head. “Did you.”

The rift shuddered.

Something else emerged.

Two shadows split from the tear in the sky above him. Flying. Massive.

The first had wings like torn canvas stitched with tendon and hooks of bone. Its skull was eyeless, its jaw split down the middle, rows of needle teeth spiraling inward. Every beat of its wings kicked up a pulse of rotten wind that cracked branches and tore needles from the pines.

The second did not flap. It floated. Spheres of flesh orbited a pulsing armored core, each orb blinking with lidless eyes. Tentacles of coiled cartilage dangled from the bottom, each tip ending in barbed claws that dripped something steaming.

Azeral’s voice pressed tighter.

“I created them with pieces of the Herald in the world your kind abandoned. Where my vessel welcomed me. And I shaped it into beauty.”

Carter stared at the screen. “Anti air online, now.”

The infected hit the tree line like floodwater.

The rift stayed open.

The sky turned red.

And the war started.

The smell of rot hit first.

We ran straight into it.

Shepherd was on my right, blade arm already soaked in black gore within seconds. Willow and Nathalie dropped behind us with terrifying precision, railguns humming, exo suits moving like they had always been part of their bodies. Alex sprinted up from the ridge alongside the Progenitor, flanked by a wall of snarling Dogmen.

The horde of infected surged like a broken dam.

They were not ready for us.

We hit them hard.

My fist went through a skull. Ribs snapped like cheap plastic. Blood sprayed warm across my suit. Shepherd moved like a butcher in a bad dream, carving through the infected as if they were paper. Willow’s team lit up the forest floor with disciplined bursts, no wasted rounds, nothing left standing.

The Dogmen tore through them with wild efficiency.

Alex whooped over the comms. “Progenitor just hit a triple. Are you seeing this.”

The Progenitor howled, jaws closing around two more infected as its claws disemboweled a third. The others followed, their movements weirdly synchronized, like one brain split across two hundred bodies.

On the surface, it was almost easy.

That was what unsettled me.

Shepherd stepped through a collapsing heap of bodies and stood beside me, his voice distorted through his chest speaker. “Feels wrong.”

I drove an elbow into an infected, felt its spine snap. “They are throwing cannon fodder.”

“No Herald. No Apostles. No twisted cryptids,” he said. “Just meat.”

“Why,” I muttered.

I did not have an answer.

The comms crackled. Alex again. “Kind of loving this, not going to lie. Nightmare zombies in a playground. I could do this all day.”

“Try not to get cocky, dog boy,” Nathalie said.

“I am not cocky. I am tactical.”

Another infected lunged at me. I hit it hard enough to invert its face.

The feeling would not go away.

Something was wrong.

The sky pulsed.

A shadow drifted overhead.

Then the flying things hit the VTOLs.

One beast slammed a gunship broadside and tore it open like a soda can. Fire and metal rained into the trees. The second creature crashed into another, shoving it sideways into the ridge in a spinning ball of flame.

We all froze for a half second, watching metal and men burn.

Carter’s voice cut in, sharp. “Kane. The rift is widening. New readings. Corrupted cryptids are coming through now.”

I turned. The rift had doubled.

Something stepped through.

A screech rose from its edge. Not human. Not animal. Like metal screaming as someone folded it into flesh. Dozens of new shapes emerged, twisted versions of cryptids we had already bled for. Dogmen, Skinwalkers, Wendigos, but wrong. Warped.

More claws, more limbs, hollow faces split by extra mouths.

“Fall back to the secondary line,” I yelled into the comm. “Now.”

Willow cursed. “What is coming, Kane.”

“Something worse than the infected.”

Even Alex sounded less sure. “Progenitor is growling. I do not think he likes what is coming either.”

The ground trembled as the flying beasts shrieked again, ripping through another VTOL.

The sky was burning.

The rift was bleeding.

And I realized the infected were not meant to beat us.

They were meant to tire us out, thin us out, before the real monsters walked in.

We pulled back with barely a scratch.

Every Dogman fell in with the retreat like a trained legion, circling wide and locking the perimeter down tight. The corrupted infected stopped chasing, retreating to the edge of the trees and standing there, swaying, as if they were waiting for a cue.

Then they parted.

The whole horde split down the middle like one body obeying one command.

He walked through the gap.

Azeral.

Still wearing that immaculate black suit.

Pressed collar. Polished shoes. Not a speck of blood or dust on him, which made him the most unnatural thing in the field.

He looked like a man heading into a boardroom, not the center of an extinction event. His body moved too smooth, too fluid, like he was wearing human motion as an approximation.

His eyes locked on me.

He smiled.

“Now this,” he said, voice carrying over the screams behind him, “is my real army.”

Behind him, the corrupted cryptids howled, hundreds deep. Twisted Dogmen, fused Skinwalkers, stitched abominations of bone and tendon. Their bodies jerked like puppets. Their mouths dripped rot.

Azeral did not flinch.

He kept walking, hands clasped behind his back like he was taking a tour.

“Kane,” he said. “I will keep this simple.”

He stopped twenty yards from the line. Everything behind him went still.

“One last chance.”

I did not move.

“You become my perfect vessel,” he said, “and I leave this universe in peace. No more cryptids. No more madness. Everyone you care about lives. No more war.”

His voice softened.

“Or I burn everything down. I will make them beg me to kill them just so the screaming stops. I will tear this reality apart piece by piece, until you are so broken that you will crawl to me and beg me to take you.”

Alex muttered off to the side, loud enough that half the line heard him. “What a psychopath.”

No one responded.

I stepped forward, out past our front.

Face to face with what he really was.

“Why would I trust you,” I asked.

Azeral’s smile did not move, but something in his eyes tightened.

“I created trust,” he said. “I offered sanctuary to a thousand realities before this one. I can reshape this universe into something better. Painless. Clean. All you have to do is accept your role.”

“And let you in.”

He lifted one shoulder. “Just a formality.”

I stared at him.

Then I shook my head. “No.”

His smile stayed.

His eyes did not.

He clicked his tongue once. “Pity.”

He turned and walked back through the silent horde, shoes tapping on the bloody earth like he was on a marble floor.

The second he vanished into the ranks, the corrupted army screamed.

And charged.

They did not come for me.

They went for everyone else.

Something hit me from behind.

Hard.

I was airborne before I understood what happened, then I smashed through a tree like it was cardboard and hit the ground in a mound of bodies. The corpses were still warm, twisted, eyeless things that twitched under my weight.

I clawed my way up, lungs burning.

Footsteps.

Slow.

Measured.

Azeral.

He walked toward me, brushing imaginary dust off his suit. Hands still behind his back. No hurry, no concern for the war erupting around us. The air rippled around him like heat haze, bending sound and light.

I got to my feet, shoulders screaming, ribs a hot line of pain.

I charged.

He did not move until my fist was almost in his face.

Then he stepped aside, caught my arm, and twisted. My back met the ground so hard the dirt cracked under me.

He crouched beside me, smiling.

“You really are difficult,” he said, like I was an unruly student. “I have given you chance after chance to save them. You keep throwing them away.”

I spat blood and drove my heel into his knee.

He stumbled, just a fraction, and I was up again.

“Maybe if you stopped talking and started bleeding, we could get somewhere,” I growled.

His smile stretched into something sharp. “You want pain.”

He moved.

Hands, elbows, fingers, every part of him a weapon. Each hit felt like something was trying to unplug me from reality. I blocked, countered, drove a punch into his ribs that made the trees bend around us. Dirt and rock exploded at our feet.

Explosions boomed somewhere behind us. Turrets spun up and roared. Carter must have flipped the full override.

None of it mattered.

Right now it was just us.

I caught his next strike, twisted his arm, drove my forehead into his face, and hurled him through a boulder. Stone shattered. He rolled, stood, straightened his jacket, and sighed.

“Kane,” he said. “Why must you always resist.”

He stepped forward again. Calm.

“I do not want this vessel.” He tapped the chest of the body he was wearing. “It is incomplete. Fragile. It will not hold me for long.”

He pointed at me.

“You were made to hold me. A perfect shell. A divine suit of armor. You have been broken, rebuilt, tested, twisted. Everything that happened to you was by design.”

I raised my fists.

“You want to kill me,” I said. “Kill me. I am not giving you anything.”

Disappointment crossed his face, quick and cold.

“So be it.”

He surged forward.

The fight turned into something worse than a brawl. Flesh met flesh, but the air shook like concrete cracking. Every time he hit me, something in me frayed. Every time I hit him, something in the world shuddered.

I drove a fist into his side hard enough to crater the ground.

He barely moved.

“You do not get tired, do you,” I panted.

“No,” he said. “But you do.”

I felt it. A drain that was not just physical. Fighting him burned through more than muscle. It ate at something deeper.

A Dogman roared and leaped in to help.

Bad timing.

Azeral turned, palm open.

CRACK.

The Dogman’s head collapsed like wet clay. Its body fell in a heap of bone and fur.

Azeral did not look at it.

“They are not built for this,” he said. “They are toys. You are the only one worth keeping.”

I tore another corrupted Wendigo in half and stepped over its pieces.

“You are not getting me,” I said.

“No,” he answered. “Not yet.”

He vanished.

No flash. No sound.

And I was not in the forest anymore.

The sky was the color of an old bruise.

The ground under my boots was cracked and black, a dried mosaic of something that looked a lot like burned bone and old blood. The air tasted like ash scraped from the bottom of a fire pit. Trees, if that was what you called them, rose like skeletons, spines instead of branches, bark that pulsed faintly like something under it was still trying to move.

Azeral stood across from me.

There was no smile now.

“Welcome to Earth one seven two four,” he said. “You are going to want to see this.”

I did not answer.

“Your people sent the Herald here,” he went on. “They thought they could banish me.”

He gestured toward the horizon.

Things moved out there.

Shapes walking, dragging, slithering across the ash. Tall silhouettes lurked in the smoke, giants stitched from war crimes and plagues. Something with too many limbs hauled itself toward a city made of rusted metal and bone.

The sky felt like it was watching.

“I will wreak havoc on your world the way I did here,” Azeral said quietly. “Are you ready for that.”

A spear appeared in his hand, silver and wrong, edges bending light.

He charged.

ALEX, FRONTLINE

“What the hell just happened,” I muttered, staring at the empty air where Kane and the black suit nightmare had been one heartbeat ago.

The Progenitor growled beside me, low and constant. His hackles were up. I felt it too, that drop in pressure in my chest like the air itself had stepped back.

I tapped my earpiece.

“Command, this is Alex,” I said. My voice came out tighter than I liked. “We have got a problem. Kane and the suit just vanished. No blood, no body, nothing. One second they are trading hits, the next they are gone.”

Silence for a beat. Static.

Then Carter. “Confirmed.”

I glanced at the scorched earth where they had been. “Yeah. They are gone.”

I tried for a smile no one could see. “Guess that makes me and the big guy the most dangerous things on the field now. Congrats to us.”

No one laughed.

I sighed and turned, heading toward Willow and Nathalie’s fallback line. The Progenitor followed close, silent and watchful.

Willow met me first, lowering her visor. “You saw it too.”

“Front row,” I said. “Kane and that thing blinked out. I do not know where they went, but it was not here.”

Nathalie stepped up beside her. “That should not be possible.”

“Yeah,” I said. “A lot of things should not be possible.”

How do I navigate it?,"Hi so I know the title of this post is a little vague but please bear with me. I'm 20 years old and have never dated anyone before, not even held hands with a guy. I think it was just the circumstances plus I am really dense when it comes to receiving hints.

Recently, about a month ago I met this guy who is  in the same uni club as me and we have this program we're attending. We would spend around 1-3 hrs after the program together sometimes just walking to random places/eating dinner/going for coffee etc. 

On days that the program isn't happening we spend the ENTIRE day (from around 9/10am to 10pm) together and he is the one who suggests hanging out btw.

This Christmas neither of us could go home to celebrate with our families, so we decided to go out and do something nice. 

Later he suggested we buy groceries and cook something in my apartment because well, the place we went to was boring and I had already called him over to my place prior to wait while I got dressed. 

He then proceeded to try to buy me 30 bucks worth groceries(I paid before he could, he then sent me half the amount), cooked us dinner, did not allow me to step in the kitchen and when there wasnt enough food for both of us, he gave me all of his food. Later he did not allow me to wash the dishes either and was literally trying to gently snatch my plates when I insisted on washing the dishes saying ""let me do it for you, I want to do it for you"".

He also almost missed the last train just do he could drop me back to my place when we went for a walk after dinner.

Besides these, he texts me almost everyday, even when he is on trips with friends. My friend also noticed he glances at me a lot?

I'm just a little bit skeptical because is this how friends are supposed to act with one another? Moreover, for some reason he barely talks to me during the program when his friends are around. When I asked if he was a relationship guy, he said ""Yeah eventually everyone wants to settle down"".

I'm the type of person to get close to and attached really quickly so I was actually thinking of distancing myself from him for a week or 2. (Because I just dont want my feelings to become super intense) Is that what I'm supposed to do? I know I have feelings for him and I really don't understand how this is supposed to play out.

Thank you so much for reading!!

TLDR: I like my friend, he might like me? I really don't know and am not sure how to proceed with it.",1,1766970222.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

Most AI advice sounds like “just use ChatGPT”, which is way too vague. What actually helps is having tiny, focused tools that do one job extremely well.

Here are 10 mini AI tools I use for real-life work and side projects – each takes 30–60 seconds to use and costs less than a coffee:

**1. AI-Powered Lead Generator**  
Give it your audience, offer and goal, and it suggests specific lead gen angles and assets (lead magnets, outreach angles, hooks) you can ship this week – not “in theory”, but concrete campaigns you can test.

**2. Buyer Journey Audit**  
Drop in your site and get an audit for awareness, consideration and decision stages. It tells you where you’re losing people and gives suggestions for extra pages, proof and CTAs.

**3. Value Positioning Analyzer**  
Paste your offer and a few competitor summaries. It highlights where you sound generic and suggests sharper, more differentiated positioning.

**4. Smart Job Application Assistant**  
Paste a job description and your CV. It helps you reframe your skills, write a tailored letter and align your LinkedIn profile in one workflow.

**5. LinkedIn Post Idea Generator**  
Tell it who you are and who you serve, and it outputs a list of angles and post ideas that actually fit your niche, not generic “hustle” quotes.

**6. Story & Reel Caption Generator**  
You describe the clip in plain language, and it gives you ready-to-post hooks, captions and CTAs tailored to your platform.

**7. Personal Brand Story Coach**  
Answer a few questions, and it helps you structure your story in a way that’s clear, memorable and relevant for your ideal audience.

**8–10. Visual fun & utility tools**  
– Turn yourself into a Pixar, Ghibli, GTA or action-figure style character.  
– Turn any photo into a bold cartoon portrait.  
– Remove unwanted objects/people from photos in seconds.

I bundled all of these into a small “AI for Growth” tool library so you don’t have to glue prompts together yourself. Each tool is built to do one job well and not waste your time.

College educated, fluent in English, sarcasm, and the occasional bad pun. Big fan of Suits because nothing says thrilling drama like corporate loopholes and HGTV. In the kitchen, I cook, bake, and argue with my oven over who’s the real master chef.

I don’t drink or do drugs. Unless you count caffeine, in which case I’m basically a bean addict. My nightlife is less clubbing till 2 a.m. and more building pillow fort empires and bingeing Netflix until cliffhangers leave me emotionally bankrupt. Basically, I’m a homebody with a 5-star rating on Yelp for snacks.

I lean conservative. Not here to debate politics, just putting it out there in case that’s a dealbreaker. Better to find that out before we bond over banana bread and binge-watching.

About You

You’re in your 30s, educated, and steady in your career. Bonus points if you can use there, their, and they’re correctly without breaking a sweat. You can hold a conversation that’s more than “hey” (plot twist, you’re actually interesting). You send memes that perfectly capture life’s chaos because sometimes a GIF says more than a whole paragraph.

You don’t smoke, do drugs, drink heavily, have tattoos, piercings, or kids. I like my drama like my Netflix, available on demand, not in real life. You’re thoughtful, communicative, and remember the small things, like my coffee order or which side of the blanket I hog.

Ideally you live in the same country. Love letters are cute, but customs forms are not, and I’m not DHL Express. I don’t handle international returns.

Gods, cryptids, rogue timelines, and now a smart mouthed teenager cruising around with an alpha Dogman like it was a service animal.

“Alright,” I said. “We will bring the Halos. We are wheels up in twenty.”

Carter gave a final nod. “HQ will clear airspace for you. See you soon.”

The screen went black.

I turned to Nathalie.

“You thinking what I am thinking?”

She stood and started locking in her exo suit’s spinal harness, the magnets clicking into place down her back. “That if we survive this, I want a week of silence, whiskey, and sleep.”

I chuckled. “Exactly that.”

The VTOL touched down with a hiss of steam and a familiar hydraulic groan. The landing pad smelled like jet fuel, hot metal, and coffee that had been sitting on a burner too long. Black armored Division personnel moved around us like ants, offloading supply crates, rearming bunkers, double checking biometric locks and shouting over each other.

As Nathalie and I disembarked, the rest of our unit peeled off in full Black Halo exo suits. Sleek, reinforced plating, matte finish that drank in the floodlights, the faint shimmer of reactive shielding when they moved. We gave them a nod. They knew the drill. Weapons check. Loadout prep. Stand by for briefing.

We would meet them soon enough.

But Carter had requested us personally.

We cut through the secure hallway toward the upper ops wing. You could feel it even in the recycled air, that heavy pressure before a storm. The atmosphere here was thick, like the walls did not want to hear what was being said inside them. Whatever was coming, everyone here felt it, even if they pretended they did not.

The door at the end of the corridor slid open with a metallic sigh.

Carter stood waiting inside.

Behind him was Kane.

And to Kane’s left, lounging with all the grace of a gremlin that just figured out sarcasm was a weapon, was the teenager from the call, in combat boots and a Division jacket two sizes too big, sleeves rolled up past his wrists.

“Welcome back,” Carter said. “Good time?”

“Uneventful,” I said. “No eldritch monsters. Nice change of pace.”

Nathalie nodded. “Team is unloading. Black Halos are being armed. Now, where is our god?”

Kane looked up, his eyes catching mine. For a moment, there was something in them that made my stomach tighten. Not fear exactly. More like someone who had already lived through the thing we were about to face.

Carter gestured to the table. “Sit. We do not have long before things kick off.”

We dropped into chairs opposite them.

The teenager, Alex, waved lazily. “Hi. I am Alex. Resident monster tamer. Dog whisperer. Apocalypse intern.”

Nathalie raised a brow. “You are the Progenitor handler?”

“Handler is a strong word,” Alex said, smirking. “Let us just say I am the only one he does not try to eat.”

“He obeys him,” Kane added. “And the rest of the Dogmen obey him, as long as the Progenitor is in range.”

I leaned forward. “How close is close?”

Alex shrugged. “That is the fun part. Sometimes five miles, sometimes more. Depends if he is in a mood. Cryptids are emotional creatures apparently.”

Nathalie blinked. “Jesus.”

“Oh, he is not involved,” Alex said. “Not in this one anyway.”

Carter cleared his throat before the conversation could spiral. “Kane has brought you up to speed.”

“Enough to know it is bad,” I said. “But not bad enough for nukes yet.”

Carter’s expression did not change. “Let us keep it that way.”

Kane turned toward us. “We have seen what Azeral can do when he is only partially anchored. Now he is in a body, a vessel that gave permission. We do not know the limits. Only that the Division lost four deep cell teams trying to intercept the first anomaly flare eight miles from here. This is not a containment op. This is a war.”

Nathalie leaned forward, arms folded. “What is the plan?”

Before Carter could speak, Alex raised a hand.

“Can I say it?”

Carter let out a slow breath. “Alex.”

“We fight a god,” Alex shouted, throwing his hands up like he was announcing a movie title, “and hope it dies like a man.”

There was a beat of silence.

Kane did not even blink. “You are really not afraid of dying, are you?”

Alex snorted. “Oh, I am terrified. But everyone needs a hobby.”

I could not help it. I cracked a smile.

Carter stood. “Your squad is gearing up now. We are pulling tanks, a few APCs, awakened assets, and any field agents who are still combat rated. You four are the center. Black Halos are being positioned for surgical strikes if there are creatures that breach the lines.”

“Any intel on the vessel itself?” Nathalie asked.

“Nothing concrete,” Carter said. “We have data coming from the Earth the Herald was sent to. Some of it is corrupted. But we have names, faces, readings from before their Division fell.”

I stood, brushing dust from my fatigues out of habit. “Then I guess we better get ready.”

Alex stood too, stretching until his spine popped. “Cool. Let us kill a god.”

Kane glanced at Carter. “Or die trying.”

ALEX, DIVISION HQ, EASTERN COURTYARD

The hallway leading out to the southern launch pad was lined with reinforced glass and tension. Agents moved past in a rush, clipboards, rifles, half eaten energy bars in hand, all pretending this was just another big operation. Kane and I walked in silence for a bit, boots thudding against polished concrete. The Progenitor stalked behind us like a shadow that learned how to breathe, massive, quiet, calm only because I was.

I glanced up at Kane. Up close, he looked like someone who should have been in a hospital bed with machines doing his breathing. Instead he was here, planning to punch a god.

“So, be honest,” I said. “How strong are you really?”

He looked at me sideways.

“Last time the Division tested it,” he said, “I picked up a twenty ton reinforced cargo truck and threw it through two hangars.”

I blinked once. “Okay. Sure.”

“And I can move faster than most operatives can track.”

I let out a low whistle. “Right, cool. Definitely not compensating for anything.”

Kane did not laugh, but there was the smallest twitch at the corner of his mouth.

“Just so you know,” I added, nudging him with my elbow, “the Progenitor wants to race you when this is over.”

“He wants to race me.”

“Yeah. Tail wag and everything. I do not think he likes not being the fastest murder beast in the room.”

Behind us, the Progenitor let out a short chuff that rattled the glass. It was almost a laugh.

Kane gave a dry chuckle. “Tell him he is on.”

I snapped my fingers. “You hear that, big guy? Start stretching.”

The Progenitor tilted his head, baring rows of teeth in what absolutely counted as a grin, if you ignored the part where that grin could remove a car door.

We reached the garage tunnel. One of the exterior blast doors was already open, night wind spilling through, carrying the smell of pine, wet dirt, and distant smoke. I slung my satchel across my back, the one with the blood scented tags and signal boosters stitched into the lining. Not Division issue. Mine.

Kane stopped me at the threshold. “Where are you going?”

“Scouting,” I said. “If the Progenitor and I can reach the regional packs, we might be able to bring some under control. I can promise loyalty, convince them we are the better option. At least keep them from joining him.”

Kane gave a slow nod. “Be careful.”

I saluted with two fingers. “Always am.”

“Alex,” he added.

I turned back.

“If they turn on you.”

“They will not,” I said, tapping my chest once. “He is in here with me. I trust him more than most people.”

Kane did not argue with that. He just watched as the Progenitor and I moved off into the dark, toward the tree line beyond the landing zones.

The moon hung low and red like it had been watching this place for a while.

And the hunt was just beginning.

KANE, DIVISION HQ, NORTH HALLWAY

I kept walking even after Alex and the Progenitor vanished past the edge of the floodlights. The cold concrete under my boots, the flicker of emergency strips in the ceiling, the distant hum of VTOL engines spooling up, it all blurred behind the one question that had been chewing at the back of my mind since I came back.

Why me.

Carter caught up to me by the elevator. His expression was tight as always, but his posture gave him away. Shoulders a little lower, eyes a little more sunken. He had not slept. That made two of us.

“You holding it together?” he asked.

“Define together,” I muttered, then looked at him. “Can I ask you something?”

“You can try.”

“Why do you never use your Revenant abilities?”

Carter stopped walking.

“I have read the files, and I saw it when I escaped,” I added. “You were Subject Zero. Division’s first test run. You survived. Barely. But you do not fight like it. You act like a handler, not a weapon.”

Carter looked away, jaw clenched. “Because I was a weapon. That was all I was. When they finished building me, they realized they had made a mistake.”

I stayed quiet.

“The version of the serum they gave me did not stabilize,” he went on. “My cells regenerate, yes. My reflexes are enhanced. I can punch through steel and outrun bullets for about three minutes.”

“What happens after three minutes?”

He smiled without humor. “Then I start hemorrhaging from the inside out. Every time I have used my abilities, I have lost weeks, sometimes months, of organ stability. I have to pick my moments, Kane. I do not get to fight like you do.”

That shut me up.

By the time we hit the main entrance, the reinforced blast door was sliding open, and I saw her.

Lily.

Running straight at me.

She hit me hard enough to stagger me back a step, arms wrapping around my torso like she was afraid I would vanish again if she did not hold on. I pulled her in tight and held her there, breathing in the familiar smell of her shampoo and gun oil.

“You are okay,” she breathed. “They said you made it back, but I did not believe it until I saw you.”

“I am here,” I said. “I am not going anywhere.”

Then I saw him.

Shepherd.

He stood just behind her, massive and silent. Taller than me by at least a foot. His skin looked like dried parchment left in the sun too long, cracked and flaking around plates of bone. One arm ended in a fused, blade like appendage. His face was still a nightmare, fleshless, eyeless, steam rising faintly from the sockets like dying coals.

“Still ugly,” I said.

“Still annoying,” he rasped.

We clasped forearms. His grip felt like rebar.

“Thanks for watching out for her,” I said, nodding at Lily.

He gave a faint shrug. “She is smarter than you. Less likely to get herself killed.”

“Good to know where I stand.”

Shepherd tilted his head slightly. “You ready?”

“For what?”

“To try and kill a god.”

I looked into the empty sockets, steam still curling up in thin threads.

For the first time in days, I did not hesitate.

“Yeah,” I said. “Let us go make it bleed.”

We walked in silence for a while after that. The quiet between us was not awkward. It was the kind you get after surviving too many close calls with the same person. There is nothing left to say that does not sound small.

“Think we make it through this?” I finally asked.

Shepherd’s voice scraped like gravel. “Does not matter.”

I shot him a look.

He kept walking. “We will try anyway.”

That was fair.

We were almost to the last corridor before the courtyard when the alarm klaxons kicked in. The sound hit like a knife to the teeth.

Then the AI’s voice spoke, calm and clinical.

“Warning. Cryptid presence detected. Species: Canis Lupus variant. Quantity: approximately two hundred fifty. Distance: one hundred fifty meters from Division HQ main entrance. Hostility status: undetermined.”

I looked at Shepherd.

He was already moving.

By the time we reached the outer blast doors, Carter was there, grim and locked in. Willow and Nathalie came in behind us, helmets clipped to their suits, weapons magnetized to their backs.

Willow was the first to break the silence. “Is that reading accurate?”

Carter did not answer right away. He was staring out through the reinforced viewport above the main barricade, toward the trees pouring down the southern ridge.

Shapes moved in the dark.

A lot of shapes.

Too many.

They moved as one, tight and smooth, no snarling, no lunging. Just shadows slipping forward through brush, deliberate and steady.

Then a figure stepped out in front of them.

Casual. Hoodie unzipped. Hands in his pockets like he was out for a late walk and not escorting a small army.

Alex.

He threw his arms wide, like he was presenting a magic trick, and smirked.

“Hope you all are not allergic to dogs,” he shouted.

The Progenitor padded out beside him, a stalking nightmare in fur and teeth, dwarfing him by two full feet. Behind them, hundreds of Dogmen emerged from the trees. Massive, gray, scarred. Every pair of eyes locked forward.

They stopped just outside the security barrier.

Alex raised a hand and waved lazily. “So. Good news. They are with us. Do not shoot.”

There was a beat of stunned silence inside the room.

Alex scanned the faces through the glass, then spotted Shepherd.

“Holy hell,” he said, grinning. “You are ugly. You look like the inside of a microwave burrito.”

Shepherd let out a low sound. It might have been a laugh.

Alex turned back to Carter and me. “Question, is two hundred forty nine enough, or should I go back and ask for a few more?”

I actually smiled. “That will have to do.”

He gave a mock bow. “Glad to help.”

Then, more serious, Alex raised his voice for the whole line to hear. “They will not attack any humans on our side. You are safe around them. As long as the Progenitor is in range, they are locked in.”

Willow took a slow step forward, helmet tucked under one arm. “You trained two hundred forty nine Dogmen.”

Alex shrugged. “Technically, one. The others just listen to him.”

Nathalie let out a low whistle. “Kid has some talent.”

Carter folded his arms. “Talent and a refusal to stop making bad jokes.”

The Progenitor moved behind Alex, exhaling a low growl that made the reinforced fence rattle.

Alex reached back and gave him a casual pat on the leg. “Down, buddy. We are all friends here.”

I glanced at the army in front of us. Living weapons. Jaws like industrial vices. Claws like butcher knives.

For the first time in days, I felt like we might have a chance.

A small one.

But a chance.

The silence fractured with a sharp klaxon pulse that rattled my teeth.

The AI’s voice followed, neutral and flat, like it was not announcing the end of the world.

“Warning. Dimensional rift detected. Diameter: one hundred fifty two feet. Location: two hundred forty three meters northeast, tree line. Classification: Medium Class Unstable Breach.”

Everyone froze.

Even the Dogmen raised their heads, ears twitching, nostrils flaring like they smelled rot drifting in on a wind that did not exist yet.

Carter was the first to move. “Get me live visuals. Now.”

One of the techs tapped into the surveillance grid. A hologram buzzed to life on the table. Grainy thermal came first, then cleaner visuals. The tree line was splitting.

A jagged oval of nothing opened like a vertical wound in the forest.

Color bled out of it. Reality bent around its edges, warping the trees, flattening depth into a smear of wrong.

The air above it pulsed like it was holding its breath.

Then he stepped through.

Azeral.

Just seeing him made the room feel colder.

Behind him, they came like a tide.

The infected.

Hundreds.

Bodies bloated and pale, limbs distended, joints bent backward. Twisted faces slack with madness. Jaws unhinged. Movements jerky, crawling over each other to push through the rift.

Flesh that should not be alive, but refused to understand it was dead.

Azeral spoke in my head again, smooth as old poison.

“They are not clever. Not strong. But there are a lot of them.”

My fists clenched.

Shepherd stepped up beside me, his blade arm twitching. “Time.”

“Now,” I said.

Willow and Nathalie were already sealing their helmets, their exo suits locking with sharp hydraulic clicks. Nathalie slid a reinforced magazine into her railgun and grinned inside the visor. “Guess we are skipping the warmup.”

Willow barked commands into squad comms. “Formation Beta. Target priority is containment. No civvies out here. No friendly fire. If it moves like meat and smells like rot, drop it.”

“Copy,” her team replied in unison.

Carter did not flinch. “VTOLs armed and airborne, now.”

Engines rumbled overhead, rotors chewing at the air.

Then Azeral laughed.

Not out loud. Just for me.

“You did not think I would come without a surprise,” he murmured inside my head. “Did you.”

The rift shuddered.

Something else emerged.

Two shadows split from the tear in the sky above him. Flying. Massive.

The first had wings like torn canvas stitched with tendon and hooks of bone. Its skull was eyeless, its jaw split down the middle, rows of needle teeth spiraling inward. Every beat of its wings kicked up a pulse of rotten wind that cracked branches and tore needles from the pines.

The second did not flap. It floated. Spheres of flesh orbited a pulsing armored core, each orb blinking with lidless eyes. Tentacles of coiled cartilage dangled from the bottom, each tip ending in barbed claws that dripped something steaming.

Azeral’s voice pressed tighter.

“I created them with pieces of the Herald in the world your kind abandoned. Where my vessel welcomed me. And I shaped it into beauty.”

Carter stared at the screen. “Anti air online, now.”

The infected hit the tree line like floodwater.

The rift stayed open.

The sky turned red.

And the war started.

The smell of rot hit first.

We ran straight into it.

Shepherd was on my right, blade arm already soaked in black gore within seconds. Willow and Nathalie dropped behind us with terrifying precision, railguns humming, exo suits moving like they had always been part of their bodies. Alex sprinted up from the ridge alongside the Progenitor, flanked by a wall of snarling Dogmen.

The horde of infected surged like a broken dam.

They were not ready for us.

We hit them hard.

My fist went through a skull. Ribs snapped like cheap plastic. Blood sprayed warm across my suit. Shepherd moved like a butcher in a bad dream, carving through the infected as if they were paper. Willow’s team lit up the forest floor with disciplined bursts, no wasted rounds, nothing left standing.

The Dogmen tore through them with wild efficiency.

Alex whooped over the comms. “Progenitor just hit a triple. Are you seeing this.”

The Progenitor howled, jaws closing around two more infected as its claws disemboweled a third. The others followed, their movements weirdly synchronized, like one brain split across two hundred bodies.

On the surface, it was almost easy.

That was what unsettled me.

Shepherd stepped through a collapsing heap of bodies and stood beside me, his voice distorted through his chest speaker. “Feels wrong.”

I drove an elbow into an infected, felt its spine snap. “They are throwing cannon fodder.”

“No Herald. No Apostles. No twisted cryptids,” he said. “Just meat.”

“Why,” I muttered.

I did not have an answer.

The comms crackled. Alex again. “Kind of loving this, not going to lie. Nightmare zombies in a playground. I could do this all day.”

“Try not to get cocky, dog boy,” Nathalie said.

“I am not cocky. I am tactical.”

Another infected lunged at me. I hit it hard enough to invert its face.

The feeling would not go away.

Something was wrong.

The sky pulsed.

A shadow drifted overhead.

Then the flying things hit the VTOLs.

One beast slammed a gunship broadside and tore it open like a soda can. Fire and metal rained into the trees. The second creature crashed into another, shoving it sideways into the ridge in a spinning ball of flame.

We all froze for a half second, watching metal and men burn.

Carter’s voice cut in, sharp. “Kane. The rift is widening. New readings. Corrupted cryptids are coming through now.”

I turned. The rift had doubled.

Something stepped through.

A screech rose from its edge. Not human. Not animal. Like metal screaming as someone folded it into flesh. Dozens of new shapes emerged, twisted versions of cryptids we had already bled for. Dogmen, Skinwalkers, Wendigos, but wrong. Warped.

More claws, more limbs, hollow faces split by extra mouths.

“Fall back to the secondary line,” I yelled into the comm. “Now.”

Willow cursed. “What is coming, Kane.”

“Something worse than the infected.”

Even Alex sounded less sure. “Progenitor is growling. I do not think he likes what is coming either.”

The ground trembled as the flying beasts shrieked again, ripping through another VTOL.

The sky was burning.

The rift was bleeding.

And I realized the infected were not meant to beat us.

They were meant to tire us out, thin us out, before the real monsters walked in.

We pulled back with barely a scratch.

Every Dogman fell in with the retreat like a trained legion, circling wide and locking the perimeter down tight. The corrupted infected stopped chasing, retreating to the edge of the trees and standing there, swaying, as if they were waiting for a cue.

Then they parted.

The whole horde split down the middle like one body obeying one command.

He walked through the gap.

Azeral.

Still wearing that immaculate black suit.

Pressed collar. Polished shoes. Not a speck of blood or dust on him, which made him the most unnatural thing in the field.

He looked like a man heading into a boardroom, not the center of an extinction event. His body moved too smooth, too fluid, like he was wearing human motion as an approximation.

His eyes locked on me.

He smiled.

“Now this,” he said, voice carrying over the screams behind him, “is my real army.”

Behind him, the corrupted cryptids howled, hundreds deep. Twisted Dogmen, fused Skinwalkers, stitched abominations of bone and tendon. Their bodies jerked like puppets. Their mouths dripped rot.

Azeral did not flinch.

He kept walking, hands clasped behind his back like he was taking a tour.

“Kane,” he said. “I will keep this simple.”

He stopped twenty yards from the line. Everything behind him went still.

“One last chance.”

I did not move.

“You become my perfect vessel,” he said, “and I leave this universe in peace. No more cryptids. No more madness. Everyone you care about lives. No more war.”

His voice softened.

“Or I burn everything down. I will make them beg me to kill them just so the screaming stops. I will tear this reality apart piece by piece, until you are so broken that you will crawl to me and beg me to take you.”

Alex muttered off to the side, loud enough that half the line heard him. “What a psychopath.”

No one responded.

I stepped forward, out past our front.

Face to face with what he really was.

“Why would I trust you,” I asked.

Azeral’s smile did not move, but something in his eyes tightened.

“I created trust,” he said. “I offered sanctuary to a thousand realities before this one. I can reshape this universe into something better. Painless. Clean. All you have to do is accept your role.”

“And let you in.”

He lifted one shoulder. “Just a formality.”

I stared at him.

Then I shook my head. “No.”

His smile stayed.

His eyes did not.

He clicked his tongue once. “Pity.”

He turned and walked back through the silent horde, shoes tapping on the bloody earth like he was on a marble floor.

The second he vanished into the ranks, the corrupted army screamed.

And charged.

They did not come for me.

They went for everyone else.

Something hit me from behind.

Hard.

I was airborne before I understood what happened, then I smashed through a tree like it was cardboard and hit the ground in a mound of bodies. The corpses were still warm, twisted, eyeless things that twitched under my weight.

I clawed my way up, lungs burning.

Footsteps.

Slow.

Measured.

Azeral.

He walked toward me, brushing imaginary dust off his suit. Hands still behind his back. No hurry, no concern for the war erupting around us. The air rippled around him like heat haze, bending sound and light.

I got to my feet, shoulders screaming, ribs a hot line of pain.

I charged.

He did not move until my fist was almost in his face.

Then he stepped aside, caught my arm, and twisted. My back met the ground so hard the dirt cracked under me.

He crouched beside me, smiling.

“You really are difficult,” he said, like I was an unruly student. “I have given you chance after chance to save them. You keep throwing them away.”

I spat blood and drove my heel into his knee.

He stumbled, just a fraction, and I was up again.

“Maybe if you stopped talking and started bleeding, we could get somewhere,” I growled.

His smile stretched into something sharp. “You want pain.”

He moved.

Hands, elbows, fingers, every part of him a weapon. Each hit felt like something was trying to unplug me from reality. I blocked, countered, drove a punch into his ribs that made the trees bend around us. Dirt and rock exploded at our feet.

Explosions boomed somewhere behind us. Turrets spun up and roared. Carter must have flipped the full override.

None of it mattered.

Right now it was just us.

I caught his next strike, twisted his arm, drove my forehead into his face, and hurled him through a boulder. Stone shattered. He rolled, stood, straightened his jacket, and sighed.

“Kane,” he said. “Why must you always resist.”

He stepped forward again. Calm.

“I do not want this vessel.” He tapped the chest of the body he was wearing. “It is incomplete. Fragile. It will not hold me for long.”

He pointed at me.

“You were made to hold me. A perfect shell. A divine suit of armor. You have been broken, rebuilt, tested, twisted. Everything that happened to you was by design.”

I raised my fists.

“You want to kill me,” I said. “Kill me. I am not giving you anything.”

Disappointment crossed his face, quick and cold.

“So be it.”

He surged forward.

The fight turned into something worse than a brawl. Flesh met flesh, but the air shook like concrete cracking. Every time he hit me, something in me frayed. Every time I hit him, something in the world shuddered.

I drove a fist into his side hard enough to crater the ground.

He barely moved.

“You do not get tired, do you,” I panted.

“No,” he said. “But you do.”

I felt it. A drain that was not just physical. Fighting him burned through more than muscle. It ate at something deeper.

A Dogman roared and leaped in to help.

Bad timing.

Azeral turned, palm open.

CRACK.

The Dogman’s head collapsed like wet clay. Its body fell in a heap of bone and fur.

Azeral did not look at it.

“They are not built for this,” he said. “They are toys. You are the only one worth keeping.”

I tore another corrupted Wendigo in half and stepped over its pieces.

“You are not getting me,” I said.

“No,” he answered. “Not yet.”

He vanished.

No flash. No sound.

And I was not in the forest anymore.

The sky was the color of an old bruise.

The ground under my boots was cracked and black, a dried mosaic of something that looked a lot like burned bone and old blood. The air tasted like ash scraped from the bottom of a fire pit. Trees, if that was what you called them, rose like skeletons, spines instead of branches, bark that pulsed faintly like something under it was still trying to move.

Azeral stood across from me.

There was no smile now.

“Welcome to Earth one seven two four,” he said. “You are going to want to see this.”

I did not answer.

“Your people sent the Herald here,” he went on. “They thought they could banish me.”

He gestured toward the horizon.

Things moved out there.

Shapes walking, dragging, slithering across the ash. Tall silhouettes lurked in the smoke, giants stitched from war crimes and plagues. Something with too many limbs hauled itself toward a city made of rusted metal and bone.

The sky felt like it was watching.

“I will wreak havoc on your world the way I did here,” Azeral said quietly. “Are you ready for that.”

A spear appeared in his hand, silver and wrong, edges bending light.

He charged.

ALEX, FRONTLINE

“What the hell just happened,” I muttered, staring at the empty air where Kane and the black suit nightmare had been one heartbeat ago.

The Progenitor growled beside me, low and constant. His hackles were up. I felt it too, that drop in pressure in my chest like the air itself had stepped back.

I tapped my earpiece.

“Command, this is Alex,” I said. My voice came out tighter than I liked. “We have got a problem. Kane and the suit just vanished. No blood, no body, nothing. One second they are trading hits, the next they are gone.”

Silence for a beat. Static.

Then Carter. “Confirmed.”

I glanced at the scorched earth where they had been. “Yeah. They are gone.”

I tried for a smile no one could see. “Guess that makes me and the big guy the most dangerous things on the field now. Congrats to us.”

No one laughed.

I sighed and turned, heading toward Willow and Nathalie’s fallback line. The Progenitor followed close, silent and watchful.

Willow met me first, lowering her visor. “You saw it too.”

“Front row,” I said. “Kane and that thing blinked out. I do not know where they went, but it was not here.”

Nathalie stepped up beside her. “That should not be possible.”

“Yeah,” I said. “A lot of things should not be possible.”

My anger has been dispatched, swept away at last, leaving such happiness to grow in its place. While uncertainty persists, in my heart of hearts, I shine a billion times brighter without that bitter pill.",3,1766969601.0,Poems,1,1.0,False

For context, I’ve had a Mr. Coffee for drip coffee for twenty years and it has always satisfied my needs. I drink a lot of coffee, my partner does on occasion and has never made a cup of coffee at home in their life and therefore has no idea about how complicated coffee / espresso machines are. I’m sure they saw a fancy machine that makes coffee, iced coffee and espresso, knew I loved coffee and have an old coffee maker and thought nothing of it. I know he meant well. I drink coffee daily, they will know if I’m not using it. 

It sounds like the pods are very expensive but I’ve researched some strategies that others users have employed to reuse pods, I plan to try that. I personally do not like the taste of coffee from a Keurig. 

How would you compare the taste of Nespresso coffee to standard drip? Am I better off staying with my old coffee maker?

The push and pull felt electric but frustrating. And then I left, for London with short notice and she was visibly hurt.

I have a streak for being attracted to but also connecting well with age gaps. Age gap relationships are hard for lack of sense of community (my three years with 54M was quite isolating for my social life which is OK but not what I seek moving forward)

1py7p3a,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1py7p3a,Review #41 - Dettling Cask Strength Single Barrel “Angels Share: Appalachian Oak”,"In the glass: Dettling Cask Strength Single Barrel “Appalachian Oak, Angel Share”, Barrel #527

Distillery: Big Escambia Spirits

ABV: 56.45%

Proof: 112.90

Age: 4 Years 7 Months

Mashbill: 70% corn, 15% rye, 12% oat, 3% roasted assorted grains (chocolate malted rye, caramel malted barley, malted wheat)

Nose: This doesn’t smell as dark as Dettling usually does. Some citrus, rye spice, brown sugar, almost a persimmon on the nose, a bit of oak. It’s soft.  

Palate: There’s the cocoa, little bit of tobacco, some coffee (not as much as usual), rye spice, some more of that citrus. It’s a good bit softer than a normal dettling but not completely out of the realm of ordinary. A tad bit of baking spices, super light. Some nice honeysuckle and lemon bar towards the back of the sip.

Finish: Short-medium length finish, Cocoa Puffs esque, almost like an orange cream. Not much if any tobacco on the finish, this Appalachian oak gives it almost a fluffy finish, like a Nutella that’s been whipped. 

Final thoughts: This expression was finished in an Appalachian oak barrel. It provides an experience that’s not completely different from normal double oaked dettling that sits in American oak but it’s like it mellows out the flavors and allows it to become softer and show citrus. This is probably my least favorite dettling I’ve tried so far but not because it isn’t good, it’s just lighter than the regular offerings. This pick sold out in 1 minute on their website and I was lucky to get a sample from a friend. If you haven’t tried Dettling, keep looking, they’re worth it!

Not the burnt kind from a stale pot left on warm too long. This was rich, fresh, full. The kind of smell that does not belong in a place that does not have time.

I stepped out of the fog expecting more trees and that ash colored sky.

Instead, I saw chrome.

A row of black and white tiles cut across a parking lot that was too clean to exist anywhere real. Neon lights buzzed overhead, spelling out Marla’s Diner in warm red cursive. Same name. Same sign.

But it was not burned out or boarded up like the last time I saw it.

It was perfect.

Every window shined. No dust. No blood. The door swung open smooth, hinges quiet. A little bell chimed.

And inside,

they were waiting.

Lily.

Shepherd.

Lily sat in the corner booth behind a tall milkshake glass and a plate of untouched fries. She was laughing at something Shepherd said. His arms were normal. No smoke. No fractures. No mutation. Just tan skin, a flannel shirt, and that crooked smile he used to wear before the world finished falling apart.

My legs moved on their own.

I stepped inside, heart pounding.

Warmth hit me like a blanket. Booths lined the walls. Ceiling fans turned lazily. The jukebox hummed some soft old song about moonlight and memory.

“Hey,” Lily said, looking up. Her eyes sparkled.

I froze.

“Sit down, Kane,” Shepherd added, waving me over. “You look like hell.”

I did not move.

“Lily?” I asked. My voice cracked. “Is it really you?”

She blinked. Smiled gently. “Of course it’s me. Who else would I be?”

The bell above the door chimed again.

No one came in.

That was when I knew.

This was not real.

I turned toward the counter. A man in a spotless apron poured coffee from a glass pot. His face was forgettable. Average. The kind you lose as soon as you look away.

His eyes were not.

They were spirals. Deep. Endless.

When he spoke, it was not with one voice.

It was all of them.

Lily. Shepherd. Carter. The Division doctor who named me 18C. My own.

Layered. Rotating. Pressing into my skull like static vibrating through bone.

“You have seen the truth now,” the voice said. “You saw the gate. The tree. The mirror. You know what lives in you.”

I did not answer.

“You cannot go back,” it continued. “The Kane they knew, the Kane you thought you were, that version burned away the moment you touched the bark.”

Lily stood up slowly. Her smile thinned.

“Kane,” she said softly. “It is okay. Let it in. Let us in. Do you not want to stop hurting?”

I stepped back.

“No.”

Shepherd rested his hands on the table, calm.

“You are scared,” he said. His voice sounded older, worn. “Scared of what is waking up in you. Scared of what you might become. We are not here to hurt you, Kane.”

He leaned forward.

“We just want you to remember.”

The lights dimmed.

The air thickened and hummed with that wrong frequency again. The one that knocked your heartbeat off rhythm.

The man behind the counter stepped forward. The apron faded. His skin shimmered like oil over glass. His face folded in on itself, testing different masks that never quite fit.

“You are the vessel,” all those voices said together.

“You were always meant to be.”

He smiled with teeth that were too straight.

“What are you really afraid of, Kane?”

I opened my mouth to answer.

The diner walls rippled.

I saw Lily’s corpse. Cold. Covered in black spirals. Eyes wide with betrayal.

Then,

gone.

Back to normal.

Lily was laughing again.

I staggered back.

“What was that?”

“A possibility,” Azeral’s voice whispered. “One of many. You think you can protect her. That Shepherd can keep her safe. You saw what he is, what he used to be. You saw how they broke him. The same way they broke you.”

“Shut up,” I muttered, shaking.

“You came here for answers,” the voice purred. “This is what truth looks like.”

I looked at Shepherd. His eyes were not spirals, but they were not his either.

Human eyes.

Not his.

“Why do you look like that?” I asked.

He did not answer.

He just watched.

“Because deep down,” Azeral said, “you want to believe there are parts of him that were never a monster. The same way you wish Lily loved you the way you love her.”

The lights flickered again.

Outside the windows there was nothing. Just gray. Endless and empty.

Lily smiled across from me.

There were too many teeth behind it.

I clenched my fists.

The fake Lily tilted her head, still smiling, still wrong. The human looking Shepherd blinked slowly, patient. The man behind the counter, Azeral or whatever mask he wore, stood relaxed, eyes still spiraling.

I stared at him.

Then I walked forward.

“Are you done?”

The thing tipped its head.

“Excuse me?”

I kept going, slow and steady over tile that looked like it had been polished for guests who would never arrive.

“You heard me,” I said. “Is the show over? Smoke and mirrors, my friends in borrowed skins, the sad little afterlife diner. You have been whispering since the cabin. Since the tree. Since before I understood I was different. And this is what you bring me? A haunted postcard?”

I stopped at the counter.

“You are going to have to try harder than that.”

The thing behind the counter did not answer at first. The spirals in its eyes flickered once, like candlelight sucking inward.

Then it laughed.

Low. Slow. Dry, like bones pushed past their limit.

The sound came from everywhere. From behind the walls. From under the floor. Lily laughed too, half a second behind, the noise pitching too high and too wide. Shepherd just smiled.

“You still think this is about tricks,” Azeral said. “You picture some storybook demon with party tricks and contracts. You still think there is a self to protect.”

It stepped out from behind the counter. The floor did not creak. It flinched.

“You believe defiance matters to me,” Azeral said. “That the angry child turned soldier by those ants is a threat to what I am.”

It lifted an arm. The skin peeled away like fruit. There was nothing under it. No muscle. No bone.

Just memory. Echo. Intention.

“You misunderstand,” the voice said, now whispering directly from behind my teeth.

“I am not trying to trick you, Kane.”

It came closer.

“I am trying to prepare you.”

I did not back away.

“Prepare me for what?”

Its grin sharpened.

“To become my vessel.”

The floor under my boots curved, just a little, like I was balancing near the edge of a crater I could not see the bottom of. The walls blurred. Shapes moved outside the windows now. Walking spirals. Smiles. My own face.

Azeral’s voice lowered, almost gentle.

“You are not the first they made in secret rooms. You are just the first to survive long enough to matter.”

He raised his hand and the spiral on my chest burned through my shirt, pulsing.

“You bear the mark. Not because I claimed you, but because you called me.”

“Bullshit.”

He did not flinch.

“You screamed at the edge of death and begged for power,” he said. “Not with words. With need. I listened.”

He gestured and the diner warped. Melted. Became something older underneath the chrome.

“I am not your enemy, Kane. I am your design. Your gravity. The echo waiting at the end of your story.”

I stared him down.

“You are not my story.”

Azeral stopped in front of me. No apron now. No clear shape. Just the outline of a man flickering.

“I know what you fear,” he whispered. “You will lose her. You will fail him. You will burn what little of yourself you still pretend is human.”

“And when that happens,” he added, “you will beg to be mine.”

He stepped backward into the shifting walls. Lily’s fake face split like rotten porcelain. Shepherd’s human mask burned away in gray flame.

I was alone.

Not in a diner.

In a void.

Endless.

Growing.

The voice followed.

“You are fated to become my weapon.”

I stayed still.

The diner had dissolved into vapor. No floor. No ceiling. Just a spiral etched in the dark beneath my feet.

I took a breath.

Then I stepped forward.

The dark pulsed once.

The world bent, just enough to shove me sideways. Just enough to remind me this was his domain, not mine.

I kept walking.

Each step felt heavier. Not in my legs. In my head. Like I was dragging myself behind myself.

“You should not follow,” Azeral said. His voice now echoed from everywhere and nowhere. “Each layer brings you closer. Each thought makes it harder to look away.”

I did not answer.

Shapes moved in the dark. Fractals wearing skin. Versions of me.

I saw myself in Division white, smiling while I shot Shepherd in the head.

I saw another me walking hand in hand with Lily through an empty world, because he had killed everything else.

Not visions.

Offers.

Every one whispered the same promise.

“You do not have to keep fighting.”

“I am fighting,” I said.

“And you are going to lose.”

The spiral brightened beneath my boots.

The dark around me rippled like oil over bone. Something massive turned over in the distance.

Azeral’s tone shifted. Less velvet. More iron.

“You think your defiance is strength,” he said. “It only feeds me. Every rejection binds you tighter. Every time you swear you will not kneel, you sharpen yourself into my blade.”

“I am not your weapon,” I said.

“We will see,” Azeral replied.

The next step dropped out from under me.

No ground. Just empty.

I did not fall.

I descended.

The dark delivered me into a field of mirrors. Thousands of them. Cracked. Each one reflected a different version of me.

Revenant.

Monster.

Hero.

Killer.

Empty.

In one, I was still chained to a table in Site 9, eyes hollow, no name.

In another, I knelt beside the Apostle at an altar, my eyes spiral black and smiling.

I shut my own.

The spiral in my chest pulsed.

Nausea shot through me. Like reality was trying to cough me back out.

I dropped to one knee.

Azeral’s voice returned, close enough to feel in my teeth.

“You were not built to carry the weight of choice, Kane. You were built to cut. To cleanse. To end.”

I lifted my head.

“Then you picked the wrong vessel.”

A low vibration rolled through the mirrors.

Cracks spread.

One pane shattered.

Then another.

The reflections collapsed into darkness.

The spiral under my skin burned again.

This time, it pushed against something that was not Azeral.

Me.

I got to my feet.

“If you wanted someone to worship you,” I said, “you should have picked someone weaker.”

The path opened again, wider, deeper.

His voice followed.

“What do you want most, Kane? Say it. Say it and I will give it to you. No more gods. No more Division. No more monsters. Just a world where you finally get to stop.”

I set my jaw and kept walking.

“I want you to shut up,” I said. “And I am not becoming anything you planned.”

He sounded amused again.

“You think that saying no keeps you safe. All you are doing is proving why I chose you.”

The ground shuddered.

Something cracked behind me. Dry and hollow.

I turned.

The first one crawled out of the dark.

It had been a man once.

Now it dragged itself forward on arms that were too long, joints bending the wrong way. Skin sagged and pooled like it had melted then cooled crooked. Its face was wrapped in bark colored flesh, mouth sewn into a permanent scream.

A Revenant that never finished becoming.

It leaped without a sound.

I moved faster.

My knife met it midair. Division steel punched through its arm like wet paper. Black fluid hissed across the floor.

It did not slow down.

It did not react at all.

It kept scraping toward me like pain was just a rumor.

I drove the blade through its head and twisted.

It twitched.

Then dropped.

“That one wanted to be free,” Azeral said. “Just like you. He begged me to take the weight away. I did.”

I stepped back onto the spiral, breathing hard.

“You call that mercy?” I asked.

“You call it mutilation because you fear what you are meant to be,” Azeral said. “I see what waits at the end of your line. You are not running from me. You are running from the part of you that wants to say yes.”

Movement stirred in the dark.

Five more shapes.

Maybe more.

One crawled on all fours, arms bent backward. Another had no legs, only a coil of bone and tendon. Every face was wrong. Stitched into smiles. Eyes burned shut.

They were not monsters.

They were tools.

Made to obey. To suffer.

“Send as many as you want,” I said. “You are not getting what you came for.”

The first one lunged.

I met it halfway.

The tunnel became blood and noise. The smell of rot and metal hit the back of my throat. I fought without thinking. Knife through ribs. Elbow into a throat. My skin split. My vision blurred.

I kept going.

I pulled them apart.

One after another.

Azeral whispered over the sound of breaking bones.

“You will break. Not because you are weak. Because I am the one breaking you.”

The last thing’s neck snapped under my blade. It slumped.

I stayed where I was, chest heaving, surrounded by twitching bodies.

The smell of burned marrow and old blood clung to me like a second layer of skin.

I let the broken blade fall.

I kept walking.

The spiral’s pull got stronger with every step.

Azeral spoke again.

Not gentle.

Not coaxing.

Commanding.

“Do you not see, Kane?”

“I am offering what your kind has begged for since the first scream.”

“Peace.”

His voice filled the chamber now. Not just around me. Inside me. Every breath tasted like it.

“The war ends with me,” he said. “The infection. The Division. The monsters crawling over this carcass of a world. I can burn it clean. I can carve a new cycle out of this rot. All you have to do is accept your role.”

He stopped.

The air seized.

One second.

Two.

Azeral spoke again, quieter and sharper.

“…Interesting.”

I froze.

“What was that?”

His tone twisted. Surprise. Amusement.

“This was unexpected.”

The spiral at my feet flickered.

“I knew you would resist,” Azeral said. “Your will is stubborn, uncooperative. That was never in question. But another…”

He laughed.

Low.

“There is another,” he said.

I did not move.

“There is a man,” Azeral went on. “Worn. Fractured. Spinning in grief after his world ended. He wanted a way to kill the Herald.”

My blood went cold.

“I gave him that way.”

The shadows in the spiral converged.

Something stepped out of the center.

Not me.

Not Lily.

Not the Division.

A new shape.

A man, slightly good looking, streaked with dirt and ash. His clothes were shredded. They shifted as I watched, turning clean and sharp. A black suit replaced the rags.

“He was easier than you,” Azeral said through him.

“His name is not important. He traveled with a Doctor Vern and a woman named Jessa. They helped him open another door.”

The man looked down at his own hands and laughed quietly.

“They gave him a version of your serum,” Azeral said. “They thought it would save them.”

His smile widened.

“They were not wrong.”

My pulse pounded in my ears.

“I do not know who you are talking about,” I said.

“Of course you do not,” Azeral replied. “He is not from your world.”

The ground shook under my boots.

“He accepted me,” Azeral said. “No restraints. No torture chambers. No Division black sites. He asked for me.”

I stepped back.

This was wrong.

This was worse than anything in the vaults. Worse than cryptids. Worse than the Herald. Worse than the Apostle.

This was Azeral with a body.

A willing one.

“I will not let you…”

“You will not stop anything,” Azeral said.

The man stepped closer.

“You are my goal. But this body will do for now.”

The spiral ignited in white flame.

Azeral lifted his hand like a priest blessing a crowd.

“I will see you soon, Kane.”

The world hit me before the wall did.

My ribs cracked. Concrete fractured under my back. My spine flared with pain that did not feel entirely physical.

Then,

lights.

Fluorescents.

Ceiling tiles.

Carter’s face hovered over me, pale and stunned.

“Kane?” he breathed.

I coughed blood.

Hands grabbed me. Medics. White coats. Scanners. Syringes.

“Hold him, he is unstable,” someone said.

I jerked upright on instinct and shoved one medic into a rolling cart. Glass shattered across the floor.

“He is loose,” I shouted, voice raw.

Carter was already between us, pushing the medics back.

“Kane, stop. Breathe. Who is loose?”

I locked eyes with him.

“Azeral,” I said.

The name warped the air. Carter’s shoulders tensed.

“You saw him?” he asked.

I nodded, fighting to stay focused. “He is not whispering anymore. He is walking. He has a vessel. Someone gave it to him.”

Carter looked at the glass observation booth behind us. Staff were already combing footage, pulling files.

“Who?” he asked. “Names.”

“He mentioned Doctor Vern,” I said. “A woman named Jessa. Said they helped his host. Gave him a serum. Something about ending the Herald. Said this one wanted it.”

Carter frowned.

“We do not have anyone by those names on record,” he said.

My stomach sank.

He turned to a secure terminal and keyed in a few commands. “Vern, Jessa… no. Not Division. Not clergy. Not any registered cells.”

“Then where did they come from?” I asked.

Carter took a slow breath. “We have been tracking interdimensional signatures since the Herald. Minor anomalies. Most close in minutes. Three weeks ago, one stayed open.”

He looked back at me.

“A parallel Earth.”

I stared at him.

“What?”

“The Phase device was meant to send you and the Herald to opposite ends of another dimension,” Carter said. “Kane, how long do you think you were gone?”

I frowned. The question did not fit.

“Three days,” I said. “Four, maybe. Since the church. Since the device.”

Carter shook his head.

“No.”

He showed me the tablet.

DATE: JUNE 2, 2027.

“You have been gone,” he said, “for a year and a half.”

The room tilted.

I pushed away from the table like the date had teeth.

“That is not possible.”

“You vanished in the blast,” Carter said. “We swept the zone for weeks. No body. No signal. We thought the Herald took you.”

“It tried,” I said.

My knees weakened. I caught the edge of the desk. The scar on my chest pulsed beneath the bandages.

“I swear to you,” I said, “it was days. I was in some pocket between worlds. He was there. Showing me things. Trying to make me agree.”

Carter was quiet for a long time.

“If he is wearing a host from another Earth,” he said at last, “then we cannot predict him. Not anymore.”

He paced once.

“If they wanted to host him,” he added, “if they thought it would kill the Herald, then that other Earth might already be finished.”

“I do not know what we can do,” I said. “I do not even know who he is wearing.”

Carter rubbed his temples.

For a moment, real fear slipped through his expression.

The automated doors hummed louder than they should as we stepped into the debrief chamber. Cold walls. One way glass. Paperwork that would not matter if we lost.

I dropped into the metal chair. Carter stayed standing, tablet in hand.

“You are certain he has a vessel,” he said again.

“Yes,” I answered. “Not a vision. Not a threat. He has someone. He is moving.”

Carter blew out a slow breath through his nose.

I watched him.

The lines in his face looked deeper now. Eighteen months of the world continuing without me.

“Tell me the truth,” I said. “Besides you, me, and Shepherd, are there any Revenants left? Anyone we can pull in before Azeral moves?”

He tapped the tablet a few times, then turned it toward me. Four profiles loaded.

“There is a teenager named Alex,” he said. “Came out of Utah months ago. We thought he was just another survivor until we saw the scans.”

“What scans?”

“He was not running from Dogmen,” Carter said. “He was leading them.”

I stared.

Carter nodded. “He has a neural link to the Progenitor, the apex Dogman from Monticello. Some kind of forced bond from an experiment gone sideways. Now it follows him. The others follow it.”

“That is one,” I said. “Who else?”

He slid to the next page.

“Willow and Nathalie,” he said. “Survivors from the Pine Hollow blackout. They were caught in one of our containment tests. Variant 37. They fought through half a Division facility and lived long enough to see the breach finish.”

He gave a small, humorless smile.

“We gave them exo suits after that. Custom rigs. Neural sync. They have been killing infected nonstop ever since.”

I studied their faces.

“Then there is the rest of the Division,” Carter went on. “Deep cells. Clergy operators. RSU. We are pulling all of it in.”

“That still is not enough,” I said.

“No,” he agreed. “It is not.”

He looked at the glass.

“If all this fails, we hit him with every warhead left. No targeted shots. We wipe whatever ground he is standing on.”

“And the civilians?” I asked.

“We pray it is enough to make their deaths mean something,” he said.

Silence settled hard.

No good choices.

Just war,

and whatever Azeral planned to do next.

Alex, Division HQ.

Another metal chair. Another overbuilt room. Another talk about the end of the world.

I slouched back and tapped my boot against the table leg, slow on purpose. Carter sat across from me with his tablet. Next to him was someone new.

Kane.

The Revenant.

The experiment they built to fight monsters.

He did not smile. Barely blinked. Just watched me, the way one wild animal watches another through glass.

Carter spoke first. “We appreciate you coming on short notice.”

I shrugged. “You pay well and I was bored.”

He gave me a tight smile. His jaw ticked. He still had no idea what to do with me.

Kane leaned forward a little, arms folded. “You are the one bonded to the Progenitor.”

“That is what your files say,” I answered.

Carter cut in. “We need a demonstration.”

I rolled my eyes and stood.

The room hummed before I even reached. It always did. I tugged on that cord in my head, the one that connected to something out in the kennels. No chanting. No glowing eyes. Just intent.

The lights dimmed.

Metal complained behind the observation glass.

Then he walked in.

Seven feet tall. Bone plates like armor. Fur clotted with old blood and mud. The Progenitor Dogman stepped into the room without a sound. His claws flexed but did not swing. He moved behind me and stopped, breathing slow, steady.

Kane’s shoulders tightened.

Carter did not move.

I patted Progenitor’s arm like he was some giant, ugly support animal.

“See?” I said. “I told you he listens.”

Kane looked between us. “You are in control of it?”

“Not control,” I said. “He listens. If he can reach them, the others listen too. Think of him as a very violent router.”

Carter frowned. “Range?”

“Few miles,” I said. “More if he is pissed off. The further the pack gets from him, the less they listen.”

Carter nodded and made a note.

I dropped back into the chair. Progenitor stayed where he was, looming.

“By the way,” I added, “I still have not forgiven you for the containment cell.”

Carter raised an eyebrow. “You tried to bite two agents and called the Progenitor your emotional support cryptid.”

“I stand by that,” I said.

Kane’s mouth twitched like he almost smiled.

I hooked an arm over the back of the chair. “So. What do you need me for?”

The air thickened.

Carter set the tablet down.

“A god found a body to wear,” he said. “His name is Azeral.”

Kane’s voice was gravel. “And we are going to war.”

Willow, Mobile Command Unit, Pine Hollow Sector 8.

The war room smelled like hot wiring and stale coffee.

Sunlight slid through the blinds behind me but never made it past the first table. The rest of the light came from screens. Thermal overlays. Perimeter sensors. Suit HUD feeds. Nathalie sat to my left, adjusting her rig’s shoulder brace while chewing someone out over comms.

The main terminal chimed.

INCOMING TRANSMISSION. PRIORITY CODE: 0A.

Nathalie and I exchanged a look.

“That is full clearance,” she said.

“Carter,” I guessed, and hit Accept.

He appeared on screen a second later, looking more burned out than usual. There was someone standing behind him, half in shadow.

“Willow. Nathalie,” Carter said. “I would ask how you are, but this is not a social call.”

“What happened?” I asked.

Carter did not waste time. “Short version. An entity named Azeral, extra dimensional, god level, has a willing vessel. We believe it came through the same alternate world we redirected the Herald to during the church event.”

My stomach knotted.

“We have confirmed hostile intent,” Carter went on. “It is moving. You are two of the best we have.”

Nathalie straightened. “What do you need?”

The man behind him stepped forward.

I knew him.

So did Nathalie.

“Kane,” I said. “From the Oregon logs.”

He gave a small nod.

“The same,” Carter said. “He is alive. He is leading point.”

“We thought you were dead,” Nathalie said.

“Not yet,” Kane answered.

Nathalie let out a low whistle. “Guess we are really bringing everything then.”

“You are,” Carter said. “Suit up. Bring your unit. And you are going to need Black Halos.”

Not the burnt kind from a stale pot left on warm too long. This was rich, fresh, full. The kind of smell that does not belong in a place that does not have time.

I stepped out of the fog expecting more trees and that ash colored sky.

Instead, I saw chrome.

A row of black and white tiles cut across a parking lot that was too clean to exist anywhere real. Neon lights buzzed overhead, spelling out Marla’s Diner in warm red cursive. Same name. Same sign.

But it was not burned out or boarded up like the last time I saw it.

It was perfect.

Every window shined. No dust. No blood. The door swung open smooth, hinges quiet. A little bell chimed.

And inside,

they were waiting.

Lily.

Shepherd.

Lily sat in the corner booth behind a tall milkshake glass and a plate of untouched fries. She was laughing at something Shepherd said. His arms were normal. No smoke. No fractures. No mutation. Just tan skin, a flannel shirt, and that crooked smile he used to wear before the world finished falling apart.

My legs moved on their own.

I stepped inside, heart pounding.

Warmth hit me like a blanket. Booths lined the walls. Ceiling fans turned lazily. The jukebox hummed some soft old song about moonlight and memory.

“Hey,” Lily said, looking up. Her eyes sparkled.

I froze.

“Sit down, Kane,” Shepherd added, waving me over. “You look like hell.”

I did not move.

“Lily?” I asked. My voice cracked. “Is it really you?”

She blinked. Smiled gently. “Of course it’s me. Who else would I be?”

The bell above the door chimed again.

No one came in.

That was when I knew.

This was not real.

I turned toward the counter. A man in a spotless apron poured coffee from a glass pot. His face was forgettable. Average. The kind you lose as soon as you look away.

His eyes were not.

They were spirals. Deep. Endless.

When he spoke, it was not with one voice.

It was all of them.

Lily. Shepherd. Carter. The Division doctor who named me 18C. My own.

Layered. Rotating. Pressing into my skull like static vibrating through bone.

“You have seen the truth now,” the voice said. “You saw the gate. The tree. The mirror. You know what lives in you.”

I did not answer.

“You cannot go back,” it continued. “The Kane they knew, the Kane you thought you were, that version burned away the moment you touched the bark.”

Lily stood up slowly. Her smile thinned.

“Kane,” she said softly. “It is okay. Let it in. Let us in. Do you not want to stop hurting?”

I stepped back.

“No.”

Shepherd rested his hands on the table, calm.

“You are scared,” he said. His voice sounded older, worn. “Scared of what is waking up in you. Scared of what you might become. We are not here to hurt you, Kane.”

He leaned forward.

“We just want you to remember.”

The lights dimmed.

The air thickened and hummed with that wrong frequency again. The one that knocked your heartbeat off rhythm.

The man behind the counter stepped forward. The apron faded. His skin shimmered like oil over glass. His face folded in on itself, testing different masks that never quite fit.

“You are the vessel,” all those voices said together.

“You were always meant to be.”

He smiled with teeth that were too straight.

“What are you really afraid of, Kane?”

I opened my mouth to answer.

The diner walls rippled.

I saw Lily’s corpse. Cold. Covered in black spirals. Eyes wide with betrayal.

Then,

gone.

Back to normal.

Lily was laughing again.

I staggered back.

“What was that?”

“A possibility,” Azeral’s voice whispered. “One of many. You think you can protect her. That Shepherd can keep her safe. You saw what he is, what he used to be. You saw how they broke him. The same way they broke you.”

“Shut up,” I muttered, shaking.

“You came here for answers,” the voice purred. “This is what truth looks like.”

I looked at Shepherd. His eyes were not spirals, but they were not his either.

Human eyes.

Not his.

“Why do you look like that?” I asked.

He did not answer.

He just watched.

“Because deep down,” Azeral said, “you want to believe there are parts of him that were never a monster. The same way you wish Lily loved you the way you love her.”

The lights flickered again.

Outside the windows there was nothing. Just gray. Endless and empty.

Lily smiled across from me.

There were too many teeth behind it.

I clenched my fists.

The fake Lily tilted her head, still smiling, still wrong. The human looking Shepherd blinked slowly, patient. The man behind the counter, Azeral or whatever mask he wore, stood relaxed, eyes still spiraling.

I stared at him.

Then I walked forward.

“Are you done?”

The thing tipped its head.

“Excuse me?”

I kept going, slow and steady over tile that looked like it had been polished for guests who would never arrive.

“You heard me,” I said. “Is the show over? Smoke and mirrors, my friends in borrowed skins, the sad little afterlife diner. You have been whispering since the cabin. Since the tree. Since before I understood I was different. And this is what you bring me? A haunted postcard?”

I stopped at the counter.

“You are going to have to try harder than that.”

The thing behind the counter did not answer at first. The spirals in its eyes flickered once, like candlelight sucking inward.

Then it laughed.

Low. Slow. Dry, like bones pushed past their limit.

The sound came from everywhere. From behind the walls. From under the floor. Lily laughed too, half a second behind, the noise pitching too high and too wide. Shepherd just smiled.

“You still think this is about tricks,” Azeral said. “You picture some storybook demon with party tricks and contracts. You still think there is a self to protect.”

It stepped out from behind the counter. The floor did not creak. It flinched.

“You believe defiance matters to me,” Azeral said. “That the angry child turned soldier by those ants is a threat to what I am.”

It lifted an arm. The skin peeled away like fruit. There was nothing under it. No muscle. No bone.

Just memory. Echo. Intention.

“You misunderstand,” the voice said, now whispering directly from behind my teeth.

“I am not trying to trick you, Kane.”

It came closer.

“I am trying to prepare you.”

I did not back away.

“Prepare me for what?”

Its grin sharpened.

“To become my vessel.”

The floor under my boots curved, just a little, like I was balancing near the edge of a crater I could not see the bottom of. The walls blurred. Shapes moved outside the windows now. Walking spirals. Smiles. My own face.

Azeral’s voice lowered, almost gentle.

“You are not the first they made in secret rooms. You are just the first to survive long enough to matter.”

He raised his hand and the spiral on my chest burned through my shirt, pulsing.

“You bear the mark. Not because I claimed you, but because you called me.”

“Bullshit.”

He did not flinch.

“You screamed at the edge of death and begged for power,” he said. “Not with words. With need. I listened.”

He gestured and the diner warped. Melted. Became something older underneath the chrome.

“I am not your enemy, Kane. I am your design. Your gravity. The echo waiting at the end of your story.”

I stared him down.

“You are not my story.”

Azeral stopped in front of me. No apron now. No clear shape. Just the outline of a man flickering.

“I know what you fear,” he whispered. “You will lose her. You will fail him. You will burn what little of yourself you still pretend is human.”

“And when that happens,” he added, “you will beg to be mine.”

He stepped backward into the shifting walls. Lily’s fake face split like rotten porcelain. Shepherd’s human mask burned away in gray flame.

I was alone.

Not in a diner.

In a void.

Endless.

Growing.

The voice followed.

“You are fated to become my weapon.”

I stayed still.

The diner had dissolved into vapor. No floor. No ceiling. Just a spiral etched in the dark beneath my feet.

I took a breath.

Then I stepped forward.

The dark pulsed once.

The world bent, just enough to shove me sideways. Just enough to remind me this was his domain, not mine.

I kept walking.

Each step felt heavier. Not in my legs. In my head. Like I was dragging myself behind myself.

“You should not follow,” Azeral said. His voice now echoed from everywhere and nowhere. “Each layer brings you closer. Each thought makes it harder to look away.”

I did not answer.

Shapes moved in the dark. Fractals wearing skin. Versions of me.

I saw myself in Division white, smiling while I shot Shepherd in the head.

I saw another me walking hand in hand with Lily through an empty world, because he had killed everything else.

Not visions.

Offers.

Every one whispered the same promise.

“You do not have to keep fighting.”

“I am fighting,” I said.

“And you are going to lose.”

The spiral brightened beneath my boots.

The dark around me rippled like oil over bone. Something massive turned over in the distance.

Azeral’s tone shifted. Less velvet. More iron.

“You think your defiance is strength,” he said. “It only feeds me. Every rejection binds you tighter. Every time you swear you will not kneel, you sharpen yourself into my blade.”

“I am not your weapon,” I said.

“We will see,” Azeral replied.

The next step dropped out from under me.

No ground. Just empty.

I did not fall.

I descended.

The dark delivered me into a field of mirrors. Thousands of them. Cracked. Each one reflected a different version of me.

Revenant.

Monster.

Hero.

Killer.

Empty.

In one, I was still chained to a table in Site 9, eyes hollow, no name.

In another, I knelt beside the Apostle at an altar, my eyes spiral black and smiling.

I shut my own.

The spiral in my chest pulsed.

Nausea shot through me. Like reality was trying to cough me back out.

I dropped to one knee.

Azeral’s voice returned, close enough to feel in my teeth.

“You were not built to carry the weight of choice, Kane. You were built to cut. To cleanse. To end.”

I lifted my head.

“Then you picked the wrong vessel.”

A low vibration rolled through the mirrors.

Cracks spread.

One pane shattered.

Then another.

The reflections collapsed into darkness.

The spiral under my skin burned again.

This time, it pushed against something that was not Azeral.

Me.

I got to my feet.

“If you wanted someone to worship you,” I said, “you should have picked someone weaker.”

The path opened again, wider, deeper.

His voice followed.

“What do you want most, Kane? Say it. Say it and I will give it to you. No more gods. No more Division. No more monsters. Just a world where you finally get to stop.”

I set my jaw and kept walking.

“I want you to shut up,” I said. “And I am not becoming anything you planned.”

He sounded amused again.

“You think that saying no keeps you safe. All you are doing is proving why I chose you.”

The ground shuddered.

Something cracked behind me. Dry and hollow.

I turned.

The first one crawled out of the dark.

It had been a man once.

Now it dragged itself forward on arms that were too long, joints bending the wrong way. Skin sagged and pooled like it had melted then cooled crooked. Its face was wrapped in bark colored flesh, mouth sewn into a permanent scream.

A Revenant that never finished becoming.

It leaped without a sound.

I moved faster.

My knife met it midair. Division steel punched through its arm like wet paper. Black fluid hissed across the floor.

It did not slow down.

It did not react at all.

It kept scraping toward me like pain was just a rumor.

I drove the blade through its head and twisted.

It twitched.

Then dropped.

“That one wanted to be free,” Azeral said. “Just like you. He begged me to take the weight away. I did.”

I stepped back onto the spiral, breathing hard.

“You call that mercy?” I asked.

“You call it mutilation because you fear what you are meant to be,” Azeral said. “I see what waits at the end of your line. You are not running from me. You are running from the part of you that wants to say yes.”

Movement stirred in the dark.

Five more shapes.

Maybe more.

One crawled on all fours, arms bent backward. Another had no legs, only a coil of bone and tendon. Every face was wrong. Stitched into smiles. Eyes burned shut.

They were not monsters.

They were tools.

Made to obey. To suffer.

“Send as many as you want,” I said. “You are not getting what you came for.”

The first one lunged.

I met it halfway.

The tunnel became blood and noise. The smell of rot and metal hit the back of my throat. I fought without thinking. Knife through ribs. Elbow into a throat. My skin split. My vision blurred.

I kept going.

I pulled them apart.

One after another.

Azeral whispered over the sound of breaking bones.

“You will break. Not because you are weak. Because I am the one breaking you.”

The last thing’s neck snapped under my blade. It slumped.

I stayed where I was, chest heaving, surrounded by twitching bodies.

The smell of burned marrow and old blood clung to me like a second layer of skin.

I let the broken blade fall.

I kept walking.

The spiral’s pull got stronger with every step.

Azeral spoke again.

Not gentle.

Not coaxing.

Commanding.

“Do you not see, Kane?”

“I am offering what your kind has begged for since the first scream.”

“Peace.”

His voice filled the chamber now. Not just around me. Inside me. Every breath tasted like it.

“The war ends with me,” he said. “The infection. The Division. The monsters crawling over this carcass of a world. I can burn it clean. I can carve a new cycle out of this rot. All you have to do is accept your role.”

He stopped.

The air seized.

One second.

Two.

Azeral spoke again, quieter and sharper.

“…Interesting.”

I froze.

“What was that?”

His tone twisted. Surprise. Amusement.

“This was unexpected.”

The spiral at my feet flickered.

“I knew you would resist,” Azeral said. “Your will is stubborn, uncooperative. That was never in question. But another…”

He laughed.

Low.

“There is another,” he said.

I did not move.

“There is a man,” Azeral went on. “Worn. Fractured. Spinning in grief after his world ended. He wanted a way to kill the Herald.”

My blood went cold.

“I gave him that way.”

The shadows in the spiral converged.

Something stepped out of the center.

Not me.

Not Lily.

Not the Division.

A new shape.

A man, slightly good looking, streaked with dirt and ash. His clothes were shredded. They shifted as I watched, turning clean and sharp. A black suit replaced the rags.

“He was easier than you,” Azeral said through him.

“His name is not important. He traveled with a Doctor Vern and a woman named Jessa. They helped him open another door.”

The man looked down at his own hands and laughed quietly.

“They gave him a version of your serum,” Azeral said. “They thought it would save them.”

His smile widened.

“They were not wrong.”

My pulse pounded in my ears.

“I do not know who you are talking about,” I said.

“Of course you do not,” Azeral replied. “He is not from your world.”

The ground shook under my boots.

“He accepted me,” Azeral said. “No restraints. No torture chambers. No Division black sites. He asked for me.”

I stepped back.

This was wrong.

This was worse than anything in the vaults. Worse than cryptids. Worse than the Herald. Worse than the Apostle.

This was Azeral with a body.

A willing one.

“I will not let you…”

“You will not stop anything,” Azeral said.

The man stepped closer.

“You are my goal. But this body will do for now.”

The spiral ignited in white flame.

Azeral lifted his hand like a priest blessing a crowd.

“I will see you soon, Kane.”

The world hit me before the wall did.

My ribs cracked. Concrete fractured under my back. My spine flared with pain that did not feel entirely physical.

Then,

lights.

Fluorescents.

Ceiling tiles.

Carter’s face hovered over me, pale and stunned.

“Kane?” he breathed.

I coughed blood.

Hands grabbed me. Medics. White coats. Scanners. Syringes.

“Hold him, he is unstable,” someone said.

I jerked upright on instinct and shoved one medic into a rolling cart. Glass shattered across the floor.

“He is loose,” I shouted, voice raw.

Carter was already between us, pushing the medics back.

“Kane, stop. Breathe. Who is loose?”

I locked eyes with him.

“Azeral,” I said.

The name warped the air. Carter’s shoulders tensed.

“You saw him?” he asked.

I nodded, fighting to stay focused. “He is not whispering anymore. He is walking. He has a vessel. Someone gave it to him.”

Carter looked at the glass observation booth behind us. Staff were already combing footage, pulling files.

“Who?” he asked. “Names.”

“He mentioned Doctor Vern,” I said. “A woman named Jessa. Said they helped his host. Gave him a serum. Something about ending the Herald. Said this one wanted it.”

Carter frowned.

“We do not have anyone by those names on record,” he said.

My stomach sank.

He turned to a secure terminal and keyed in a few commands. “Vern, Jessa… no. Not Division. Not clergy. Not any registered cells.”

“Then where did they come from?” I asked.

Carter took a slow breath. “We have been tracking interdimensional signatures since the Herald. Minor anomalies. Most close in minutes. Three weeks ago, one stayed open.”

He looked back at me.

“A parallel Earth.”

I stared at him.

“What?”

“The Phase device was meant to send you and the Herald to opposite ends of another dimension,” Carter said. “Kane, how long do you think you were gone?”

I frowned. The question did not fit.

“Three days,” I said. “Four, maybe. Since the church. Since the device.”

Carter shook his head.

“No.”

He showed me the tablet.

DATE: JUNE 2, 2027.

“You have been gone,” he said, “for a year and a half.”

The room tilted.

I pushed away from the table like the date had teeth.

“That is not possible.”

“You vanished in the blast,” Carter said. “We swept the zone for weeks. No body. No signal. We thought the Herald took you.”

“It tried,” I said.

My knees weakened. I caught the edge of the desk. The scar on my chest pulsed beneath the bandages.

“I swear to you,” I said, “it was days. I was in some pocket between worlds. He was there. Showing me things. Trying to make me agree.”

Carter was quiet for a long time.

“If he is wearing a host from another Earth,” he said at last, “then we cannot predict him. Not anymore.”

He paced once.

“If they wanted to host him,” he added, “if they thought it would kill the Herald, then that other Earth might already be finished.”

“I do not know what we can do,” I said. “I do not even know who he is wearing.”

Carter rubbed his temples.

For a moment, real fear slipped through his expression.

The automated doors hummed louder than they should as we stepped into the debrief chamber. Cold walls. One way glass. Paperwork that would not matter if we lost.

I dropped into the metal chair. Carter stayed standing, tablet in hand.

“You are certain he has a vessel,” he said again.

“Yes,” I answered. “Not a vision. Not a threat. He has someone. He is moving.”

Carter blew out a slow breath through his nose.

I watched him.

The lines in his face looked deeper now. Eighteen months of the world continuing without me.

“Tell me the truth,” I said. “Besides you, me, and Shepherd, are there any Revenants left? Anyone we can pull in before Azeral moves?”

He tapped the tablet a few times, then turned it toward me. Four profiles loaded.

“There is a teenager named Alex,” he said. “Came out of Utah months ago. We thought he was just another survivor until we saw the scans.”

“What scans?”

“He was not running from Dogmen,” Carter said. “He was leading them.”

I stared.

Carter nodded. “He has a neural link to the Progenitor, the apex Dogman from Monticello. Some kind of forced bond from an experiment gone sideways. Now it follows him. The others follow it.”

“That is one,” I said. “Who else?”

He slid to the next page.

“Willow and Nathalie,” he said. “Survivors from the Pine Hollow blackout. They were caught in one of our containment tests. Variant 37. They fought through half a Division facility and lived long enough to see the breach finish.”

He gave a small, humorless smile.

“We gave them exo suits after that. Custom rigs. Neural sync. They have been killing infected nonstop ever since.”

I studied their faces.

“Then there is the rest of the Division,” Carter went on. “Deep cells. Clergy operators. RSU. We are pulling all of it in.”

“That still is not enough,” I said.

“No,” he agreed. “It is not.”

He looked at the glass.

“If all this fails, we hit him with every warhead left. No targeted shots. We wipe whatever ground he is standing on.”

“And the civilians?” I asked.

“We pray it is enough to make their deaths mean something,” he said.

Silence settled hard.

No good choices.

Just war,

and whatever Azeral planned to do next.

Alex, Division HQ.

Another metal chair. Another overbuilt room. Another talk about the end of the world.

I slouched back and tapped my boot against the table leg, slow on purpose. Carter sat across from me with his tablet. Next to him was someone new.

Kane.

The Revenant.

The experiment they built to fight monsters.

He did not smile. Barely blinked. Just watched me, the way one wild animal watches another through glass.

Carter spoke first. “We appreciate you coming on short notice.”

I shrugged. “You pay well and I was bored.”

He gave me a tight smile. His jaw ticked. He still had no idea what to do with me.

Kane leaned forward a little, arms folded. “You are the one bonded to the Progenitor.”

“That is what your files say,” I answered.

Carter cut in. “We need a demonstration.”

I rolled my eyes and stood.

The room hummed before I even reached. It always did. I tugged on that cord in my head, the one that connected to something out in the kennels. No chanting. No glowing eyes. Just intent.

The lights dimmed.

Metal complained behind the observation glass.

Then he walked in.

Seven feet tall. Bone plates like armor. Fur clotted with old blood and mud. The Progenitor Dogman stepped into the room without a sound. His claws flexed but did not swing. He moved behind me and stopped, breathing slow, steady.

Kane’s shoulders tightened.

Carter did not move.

I patted Progenitor’s arm like he was some giant, ugly support animal.

“See?” I said. “I told you he listens.”

Kane looked between us. “You are in control of it?”

“Not control,” I said. “He listens. If he can reach them, the others listen too. Think of him as a very violent router.”

Carter frowned. “Range?”

“Few miles,” I said. “More if he is pissed off. The further the pack gets from him, the less they listen.”

Carter nodded and made a note.

I dropped back into the chair. Progenitor stayed where he was, looming.

“By the way,” I added, “I still have not forgiven you for the containment cell.”

Carter raised an eyebrow. “You tried to bite two agents and called the Progenitor your emotional support cryptid.”

“I stand by that,” I said.

Kane’s mouth twitched like he almost smiled.

I hooked an arm over the back of the chair. “So. What do you need me for?”

The air thickened.

Carter set the tablet down.

“A god found a body to wear,” he said. “His name is Azeral.”

Kane’s voice was gravel. “And we are going to war.”

Willow, Mobile Command Unit, Pine Hollow Sector 8.

The war room smelled like hot wiring and stale coffee.

Sunlight slid through the blinds behind me but never made it past the first table. The rest of the light came from screens. Thermal overlays. Perimeter sensors. Suit HUD feeds. Nathalie sat to my left, adjusting her rig’s shoulder brace while chewing someone out over comms.

The main terminal chimed.

INCOMING TRANSMISSION. PRIORITY CODE: 0A.

Nathalie and I exchanged a look.

“That is full clearance,” she said.

“Carter,” I guessed, and hit Accept.

He appeared on screen a second later, looking more burned out than usual. There was someone standing behind him, half in shadow.

“Willow. Nathalie,” Carter said. “I would ask how you are, but this is not a social call.”

“What happened?” I asked.

Carter did not waste time. “Short version. An entity named Azeral, extra dimensional, god level, has a willing vessel. We believe it came through the same alternate world we redirected the Herald to during the church event.”

My stomach knotted.

“We have confirmed hostile intent,” Carter went on. “It is moving. You are two of the best we have.”

Nathalie straightened. “What do you need?”

The man behind him stepped forward.

I knew him.

So did Nathalie.

“Kane,” I said. “From the Oregon logs.”

He gave a small nod.

“The same,” Carter said. “He is alive. He is leading point.”

“We thought you were dead,” Nathalie said.

“Not yet,” Kane answered.

Nathalie let out a low whistle. “Guess we are really bringing everything then.”

“You are,” Carter said. “Suit up. Bring your unit. And you are going to need Black Halos.”

I've had a lot of other fun wins with wacky builds that I unfortunately do not have screenshots of, but I think I got some of the cool ones here.

A whole bunch of this post is just my opinion and how I play, so let me know if you disagree on any of it or have some tips of your own to add, I feel like there is always an endless amount to learn in the Bazaar.

Jules feels very good right now, especially after the latest patch that lets you convert your stoves and coolers. you can see that most of my builds have used it to get all stoves, or all coolers (There is a bug with the end screen that shows them before they were converted, but you can still see the correct effect on the item).

In my opinion, the reason Jules feels so good is that she has some of the strongest early game options, as well as some of the strongest late game options. The trick to doing well with her is knowing how to transition between the early and late game, as most of her early builds don't scale directly into the late game. Like any hero, you need to recognize when to pivot, as well as always being on the lookout for key items that you want to hold onto.

# Early game build

Burn is Jule's easiest early game setup, and what I most commonly use. Instant noodles and skillet are two great options, and work well together. Instant noodles needs a medium tool, which can be skillet, or any of the three haste tools (microwave, pasta maker, rice cooker, in order of my preference).  Prep station is another great tool that can scale your burn, as well as your shield and regen. Blueberry pie is a great alternative to noodles (since it also needs to be heated) and is very strong if you can get a quick upgrade to silver, or otherwise scale the shield(skills, loot items, prep station are great, honeycomb but it starts at silver).

These can quickly stack up a lot of burn on the opponent, especially paired with support like coffee or black pepper. The other strength of Jule's early game is her defense, try and get shield and regen items on your board so that you don't die before you stack up enough burn.

You can use weapons early, but I find the tend to drop off pretty quickly and aren't as consistent, but I don't try it often.

**Other items to look out for:**

Vintage can be great to slot into your chilled spot for a ton of slow, even at bronze with no haste it gives 8 full seconds of slow value every 7 seconds when chilled.

Basket can be nice to grab early to try and complete it's quest, it can provide a ton of shield and regen, and can be useful lategame too; at diamond it is 3 second cooldown with multicast and 50% crit because why not.

Meat tenderizer is pretty bad at silver, but upgrading it can make it very useful in endgame builds.

Spammy foods: Lots of her builds just want you to spam foods, so things like banu leaves and instant noodles are great just because of their high uses. I also like to pick up eggs whenever I see them, as they scale down to 2 seconds at diamond, and the shield/regen can be useful.

Laurel's fortress: you can see when i realized how good it is, as I won three game in a row with it. Starts at silver so you have a good chance at getting it early, and provides phenomenal defense. It's upgrades are amazing, scaling up it's shield and regen, while scaling down it's cooldown. Can carry you through the midgame, and can be a good lategame option with a good enchant or proper support.

Most of my builds end up using black pepper, coffee, banu leaves, honeycomb, noodles, or microwave. they are all very versatile and help out most builds.

**Early events:**

Jungle Ruins is great for it's three loot option, cinders are super good and shield is nice especially for blueberry pie or basket. unfortunately most of the other loot is pretty useless. Curio is also great for the same reason, and furry monster as well for skills, as you will pretty much guaranteed have a food to activate it.

**Monsters to fight:**

Avoid mosquitos at all costs. You will lose. It won't be fun.

Day 1: always go pyro if available, otherwise doesn't matter too much. Kimono can give scrap if you want.

Day 2: you can often beat Etherwright, as long as you have enough burn or a weapons setup. Some regen helps too. Rigged is a big hit, as well as ticket, scrap and goggles can be useful too. Otherwise, covetous thief for cloak can be good. Boarrior has good loot, but tbh I haven't fought him in a while, I don't know if he's still as strong as he used to be.

Day 3: Take Frost street challenger if available, his skill and frozen bludgeon lend very well to freezer builds, and it's quite easy to setup. Otherwise, I like tempest bravo(burn cutlass guy) furn burn synergies, or Apprentice for a good shot at temple ticket

Day 4: Retiree's skill can be very strong, I fight him often. Flame juggler is also great to go for cinders or lighter, but can be a tough fight. As long as you have a good amount of shielding, like pie, basket, or banu leaves you should be able to beat him. It's all about surviving having 30-50 burn on you. I avoid Prince Marianas, as i usually have a pretty spammy build and he will demolish you if you do.

Day 5: Sabertooth can be great for diamond fangs skill, or a shiny fang to transform. Infernal envoy also has useful loot, and you can see flame juggler again. Trashtown mayor can be nice for his shield skill. Scovyle has great burn items, but he can be quite strong: make sure you can kill him fast, since his gold pickled peppers stacks up a ton of burn. he has no defenses, so a fast burn build can do pretty well, he also has a lot of health so weapons may not be able to burst him down.

Day 6: Zookeeper is good for +burn. Avoid Forman, his forklift hits you for like 950 damage and is pretty fast. Infernal isn't crazy strong, but be careful. Again he has no defenses, but you need to kill him quickly before he ramps up big burn. Lots of shielding helps here.

Day 7: Suds if you're playing weapons to get dishwasher. Cosmic roc is good loot, same with ghost pepper. Joyful jack if you have a poison enchanted item, his skill is quite the highroll. You are not beating Corsair or thug. The burn trooper is also pretty risky, new plasma rifle is quite fast and will crit you in the face for 2k if you don't kill him very fast.

Day 8: Stew's skill is very nice for quick starts, and he has some good burn items.  Wandering shoal skill is crazy if you get it. dragon skill or dragon heart are also amazing.

Day 9: Roaming Isle skill is crazy good. Terrorform skill is great with grill or freezer. Void knight is very strong, pretty risky fight. Ferros Khan skills are amazing for freezer builds, just make sure you have the defenses to survive a sniper hit if you aren't fast enough, it does 3,450 damage so with some shielding you should be good.

Day 10: I won't go into every monster since there's a ton, but most of the third option fights are pretty doable with a decent build with a mix of offense and defense. get a feel for how you fare against different enemies, most of the time you want to fight the enemies with more xp as long as you can beat them.

# Mid-Late game builds to pivot into

**Spammy Foods**

This can be a variety of builds, usually built around a large item carry. Grill, Wok, Gingerbread house, and Feast are all great carries that can easily slot into anything with a lot of food triggers. Wok needs shield and regen items. Gingerbread likes shield scaling, like saffron, honeycomb, or both.

Oven and Pantry can supercharge spammy foods, but they are rare to see.

**Slow builds**

You can get a lot of slows with bubblegum floor, honeycomb, and vintage. Some good payoffs:

Imu is very good, however you need to scale it's burn. Skills and loot items can go a long way. hot box is good for this, since it also gets charged off of slows. Blazehowl is incredible, you can roll legendaries from shrouded figure if you want. Also crazy with wok or grill.

Giant lollipop pairs well with bubblegum floor, as it scales your max health up which increases lollipop's damage. Good support can be dishwasher for double damage, various haste items, cornucopia for charging, or meat tenderizer for reducing its cooldown.

Luau gives you regen when you slow, although typically needs scaling such as honeycomb or farmer's market. Payoff can be a good enchant, or maybe breadknife. You could also maybe do something funky with jambalaya. Could be wok as well, although your board will be pretty crowded.

**Freezer**

Freezer is very strong, and one of the easier build to setup. most of the time you really only need freezer, plus random spammy foods and preferably more freezes.

You can win with freezer without damage scaling, but its much more consistent if you can find some form of scaling. Good options: Shatter skill (go to freeze skill vendor), Frozen bludgeon (curio or frost street challenger on day 3 who also has a skill pretty much equivalent to shatter). Trained or slow and steady if you can get some slows, cosmic roc skill if you can get haste. Also infernal skill with burn. Sometimes having flat damage skills and loot can be enough, but you may want dishwasher to double its damage.

Pastry cart is amazing for freezer, and lets you just play spammy items to freeze. VERY important to upgrade, as cart freezes TWO items at diamond which is crazy for freezer.

I also like blender, as It can give you slushees on your board as well as a ton of haste. Also very important to upgrade, as it gives higher tier slushees which have lower cooldowns, and its haste value goes up to very easily give you full haste. Can be kinda slow, but as long as you have some fast foods next to the freezer to gets some quick freezes, it'll haste your board to get going quicker.

**Farmer's Market**

I like to pick up market whenever I see it and I can afford it. it can give you some econ, as well as some max health from selling foods.

It can also make for some great builds. If you have an enchanted regen item it can be very strong, I like laurel's fortress or luau with some slow support. If you don't have the enchant, then breadknife can be your payoff for having a huge amount of regen. LauLau can also be used, as it burns equal to its regen when it's heated.

Some fun interactions to look out for:

Pasta is amazing with farmers market. An offensive enchant can make it your win condition, it's easy to make it very fast with haste, and it also gives you massive amounts of max health whenever it goes off, which in turn gives itself more regen because market gives regen based off of your max hp.

A heavy enchanted market slows whenever you gain regen. This means it goes infinite with a Luau, which also has large regen number when placed next to the market. Any slow or regen payoff or an enchant on the luau makes for a great build.

**CHEESE**

I love me a cheese wheel build. With proper setup, you can get infinite shield quite quickly.

Make sure you have some base shield scaling. Can be saffron or honeycomb, or simply shield skills, scrap, gumballs, etc. As long as it has a decent starting value, it'll ramp up quite quickly.

Second, you need it to go fast. Haste is good, like microwave or coffee or whatnot. But usually haste isn't enough. Cornucopia is typically the best in my opinion, as it gives you a ton of charge, especially at diamond. Cornucopia is especially strong now that you can convert your heating and cooling spots all to the same thing, as it can charge more items much more easily. The combination of a heating cheese wheel, heated cornucopia, and then a heated black pepper, microwave, or wok make for crazy fast cheeses.

Oven and pantry are crazy good for this, but again pretty rare.

Payoffs: Offensive enchant, chilled durian, or a spam payoff like grill, feast, or wok. I prefer Wok, since it can also speed up the cheese. Gingerbread house is also great, especially because it can provide some extra early shielding to keep you alive before your cheese hits critical mass.

If you can't get the offensive enchant, a heal enchant is great as it protects from poison. With it you can even play this as a pacifist build. Otherwise the pacifist *can* work, but it's risky with so many poison maks, pufferfish vanessas, and monitor lizard dooleys. A shield enchant can be good to get it off the ground faster.

**Other Assorted Builds**

Dragon steak can be fun, if you can stack up crit on it with loot and chocolate coin, and get in combat crit skills or items. 6 second cooldown isn't bad at diamond, and its easy to make it faster.

Fruit press can be a lot of fun, focus an making it fast, and getting decent base damage either by spammy foods or skills and the like. Dishwasher is very important to double its damage.

Laurels fortress on its own can win with an offensive enchant and some speed.

Shield/regen/burn scaling can take you to ten wins with something like burrito, pizza, or azakan stew since they provide good offense and defense. Typically won't scale well into later days though, so you probably want to pivot out if you aren't winning by day 12 or so.

Generic weapons can win, but it pretty much needs dishwasher, and I think it's pretty inconsistent. Also its a very early build, probably won't win day 12+

Same with stuff like rice and pickled peppers, good early to mid but falls of late.

**Thanks for reading!**

I thought it would be fun to share all of my thoughts on Jules since I've been quite addicted to her recently, and I'm constantly learning new strategies and builds, so I'd love to hear about what you think I've missed or done wrong.

1py7lmh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Xcaret/comments/1py7lmh/xcaret_review/,XCaret Review,"**Thought I would give back to tis community with our experience given how much you guys gave to us.**

We are a family of four, with two boys aged 12 and 14. Bottom line, we have a fantastic time and wouldn't hesitate to return.

# Arrival / Airport

Arriving in Cancun was fairly smooth. You’ll want to find the **Xcaret lounge**, which is located in a large parking lot area past the hallway of taxi stands.

Important note: **it’s not very visible**. We actually walked right past it when we hit the parking lot and had to double back.

Once at the lounge, you’ll check in and be told which bus stop is yours:

* First stop = original phase of Xcaret
* Second stop = new phase (this was us)
* Third stop (I assume) = Xcaret Arte

# Check-in

The bus ride took about an hour and dropped us at the new phase.

Check-in happens in **three stages**:

1. **Front desk** You receive wristbands, which are your key to *everything*: room, food, parks, etc. So just never take them off.
2. **Concierge orientation** You’ll sit with a concierge who gives a brief overview of the resort and goes through your park and restaurant reservations. This is a good time to make changes... though we discovered that some restaurants that *used to* be walk-in now require reservations, and many were already booked. This is also where you’ll get the **timeshare pitch** (90 minutes in exchange for a gift). We were offered “swim with dolphins.” We declined, and it was never mentioned again.
3. **Escort to room** The concierge escorts you and your luggage to your room and explains everything. Shout-out to **Samuel**, who was fantastic, super friendly, and showed us all the rooms bells and whistles.

# The Room

We stayed in **Vida**, the family hotel connected to the water slides.

The room was excellent:

* Strong A/C
* Cool lighting automation
* Spacious bathroom and shower
* Fully stocked fridge (snacks + drinks)
* Cleaned daily while we were at the parks

We always came back to fresh sheets, clean towels, and restocked snacks.

The shower was great, and I *loved* the honey soap. Tried (and failed) to buy more at the spa.

Bonus: the toilet has one of those windows that switches between clear and frosted with a button — just in case you’re feeling very open with your family. :)

# Resort Layout

The new phase is fantastic and connects seamlessly to the original phase via a common walkway that runs the entire length of the resort.

It’s **huge** — probably a 15-minute walk from one end to the beach — but we got used to it quickly. The main walkway hugs one side, and we actually loved wandering off down random paths to explore.

**Favourite spot:**  
The beach near **Las Cuevas** (close to Bio). From here you can easily enter the river or grab a cave hammock (bonus!). Spend half a day in that hammock reading and drinking pinas

To find it walk past the infinity pool, down the stairs to the beach, hang a left and keep walking, look for a tunnel before you hit Bio

# Food

The food is fantastic. **All of it.**

We ate at both buffets and sit-down restaurants. We went to **XCentral** for breakfast every morning because it’s closest to the bus terminal..... and this is where I discovered **Mexican coffee**. So good.

Favourite restaurants: La Silla, Azul Nogada, **Monarca** (our top pick)

At Monarca we got a booth at the back. Amazing food, and our server made the night even better with his knowledge and warm, friendly energy.

# Parks

# Xcaret Park

We arrived early and floated the rivers — a highlight. They put all your belongings in a locked bag and send it to the other end, which is awesome.

We paid extra for snorkeling trip to a coral reef (around $350 USD) and it was **100% worth it**. The crew took great care of us and guided us around the reef. You must wear a life jacket, which initially disappointed me, but I quickly realized it keeps tourists safe and protects the reef. Huge thanks to the snorkeling crew — definite trip highlight.

# Xplor

Our **favourite park**.

At first it’s confusing until you realize everything connects via tunnels that all start from the “heart” of the park. 

* Zip lines: incredible
* Driving vehicles 5 km around the park: still can’t believe that’s allowed
* Water slide: totally worth it..... the second half is way more thrilling than expected

# XSenses

I went in with low expectations and was **completely wrong**. I thought it was an optical illusion park and we'd be in and out in a few hours. But there is a whole wet side that includes a pitch-black sensory tunnel, water slide, floating spa pools (water + mud), and an “I’m a bird” zip line. 

# Xel-Há

Another highlight.

Tip: when you arrive, **find the bikes** and ride to the top of the river first. Then float down. You can float in a tube or snorkel gear (included). Along the way there are multiple cliff jumps. **Do it.**

You can also bag your stuff and have it sent to the end of the river. The exit can be confusing — look for the big **checkered flag**.

Water slide: not worth a long wait. If there’s no line, do it. Otherwise skip it.  
(Full disclosure: my water shirt may have slowed me to a near stop. I exaggerate… slightly.)

# Xcenotes

Fantastic day. You visit four natural cenotes with swimming, floating, jumps, and zip lines

Big thanks to **George, Mario, and the rest of the Eagle crew (CAW CAW!)** for an awesome experience.

# Improvements

* **Concierge info inconsistency** We often got different answers to the same question (e.g., first bus to Xplor: 8:45? 9:00? 11:00?).
* **Room service issues** Kids ordered dinner at 5 pm while we went out. Food arrived at **11 pm**, and only half the order showed up.
* **Buffet check-ins** Please just scan wristbands. We saw lineups while half the tables inside were empty.
* **No place to hang wet clothes** We ended up using the shower. A retractable drying line would be very helpful.

# Tips

* **Skip room service** for now. Use buffets and bring food back to your room.
* **Tipping:** Not required, but appreciated. Bring USD $1s and $5s.
* **Bus terminal location:** It’s behind **Vida** (not the lobby). Ask the desk there for all departure times.
* **XCentral buffet:** Great for breakfast and grabbing snacks before park buses.
* **Eating at parks:** You *can* eat lunch and dinner at park buffets. We did. No one called the police.
* **Buffet “check-ins”:** We accidentally skipped them for days and just walked in, grabbed our food, and sat down. Again, police not called.
* **Dress codes:** Some restaurants don’t allow open-toed shoes or swimwear. We defaulted to business casual.
* **Xel-Há lockers:** There are four colour-coded locker rooms. Everyone goes to red. Go elsewhere.
* **You WILL get wet at every park** — even XSenses. We brought **two bathing suits per person**. 
* **Water shoes:** Being wet all day caused blisters. Waterproof band-aids helped. Better water shoes would help more?
* **Xel-Há snorkeling tip:** Snorkel just *outside* the stingray area — they often swim right under you. (Life jackets are technically required. Lifeguards may correct you. Police still not called.)",7,1766968753.0,Xcaret,0,1.0,False

i'd love some feedback from you all

long story short: i got involved with a sag woman ex co-worker who's in a long distance relationship. she's bored with her boyfriend, wanted to open her relationship to date me, but we ended up fooling around a couple of times before that. things got messy, with a lot of back and forth especially from me, and we stepped back from the sexual/romantic fling

we kept things friendly since we were part of the same group of colleagues/friends, but she'd always hint at something romantic when i was moving on

she finally got a job in another city, so i quietly moved on and left her behind until a few weeks ago. she texted our group chat asking for our thanksgiving plans bc she'd visit out town. i already had something, so said so. then, she announced she'd be here two weeks prior to that - and i scheduled a trip to another state to avoid bumping into her. i liked the message in the chat and didn't say anything

fast forward to the week of her visit. she directly texts me, saying to ""let her know if i would like to meet for coffee or just hangout with our friends."" i told her i wouldn't be around in the weekend, but wished her lots of fun and next time i'd join. this was \*\*wednesday around 3pm\*\*

next day, \*\*thursday at 11am\*\*, she texts the group again, saying: ""hey all, plans changed and i arrived in town earlier. i canceled my class (she's a professor) and will be here from today until sunday x"" man, i swear i felt in my gut she came earlier to try to see me... i didn't even open the message, and decided to cut her off after this

lo and behold, when i'm leaving the building i was working that day, who i see at the stairs? yeah her... with her past coordinator and a random girl. i briefly stopped by, greeted everyone, and ran away 

didn't open the group chat and of course she directly texted me on monday after my silence. she was upset at how weird was bumping into each other at work and how sad she was because she couldn't keep in touch with me and another colleague (both of us didn't reply to the group chat). she asked if everything was all right between us. after thinking about it, i said our fling was toxic as hell and that i'd step back from our connection. but wished her well and hoped she understand

she blamed me for being hot & cold, and wish me well too. then, i blocked her and left the group chat

I’m not posting this for attention or anything like that. I just wanted to put it somewhere honest.

At 10:40am on November 14, 2023, my phone rang (a random number I normally would’ve ignored) and it was the coordinator telling me they had a heart for me. I’ll never forget that moment. It felt like my whole life split into “before” and “after.”

The last two years have been a long mix of healing, fear, gratitude, setbacks, tiny wins, and a lot of learning. I found out how many people truly cared about me. I learned how strong my wife and son were while everything was falling apart. And I learned how much I actually wanted to stay alive.

Today I’m just grateful.
Grateful to still be here.
Grateful for my donor and their family.
Grateful for everyone who supported me, some of them probably without even realizing it.
Grateful I get to wake up, drink coffee, see my kid, and live a normal morning again.

If anyone scrolling through this is dealing with transplant stuff — waiting, worrying, recovering — you’re not alone. I’ve been there. It’s terrifying, but there’s a lot of hope on the other side.

I wrote out the whole story for myself today. If anyone wants to read it, I’ll drop the link in the comments. If not, that’s totally fine too.

Happy birthday to my new heart.

Still fighting.

I get there and we go grocery shopping together and make dinner and it’s nice. He asks if we can watch a movie afterwards. He’s being very affectionate and pulls me down and hugs me on the bed. He thanks me for driving all the way there, I give him a late Christmas present and ask him how his New Years set is going etc etc 

Tell me why his white, buschwick phenotype DJ, metrosexual ass suddenly says “I’ve been feeling anxious about whatever we’re doing… I don’t know if I can do this anymore. We go through the standard break up long convo, he asks me if we can still be friends because I’m “so important in his life and he really cares about me and it would be nice if we get coffee EVERY FEW MONTHS” and obviously I was like “no???” And he literally starts sobbing lol. 

He kept saying he doesn’t get why I’m so nice to him and he doesn’t deserve it and that men suck (lmao) and that he was just socialized as a male so he can’t express his feelings (btw I was the one that told him about male gender socialization so all I’ve done is give him more tools with which to manipulate women with. Sorry!). 

Anyway by this point I’m not in the mood to have an hour long drive back home in the snowy dark so I have to sleep over. He blew up an air mattress (lol) and I took the bed. I couldn’t sleep so every time I got up to use the bathroom I made sure to shine my flashlight near his face without consideration, shut the door loudly, and also kick his air mattress oops!

This morning I kicked and shook his air mattress more and woke him up by stepping on the now half deflated mattress so that he fell out! Sorry :(( 

He told me he dreamt about being back in Berghain (we went to Berlin together a month ago), and that he lost me somewhere inside and wandered around the whole night lost and confused trying to find me. Then he made me breakfast. We had another long conversation, (very mature and more than I’m probably showing in this post), and he had the balls to ask if I’d ever gotten back with any of my past lovers. I was like. No??? 

Anyway he left for brunch with his family saying he’d be back. I stole a few of his things (whoops) and cut up the photostrip he had of us on display (leaving him the half with his face) and wrote him a heartfelt note about growth and change and whatever and anyway

There are some conflicting reports online about the interactions of those two meds as it is but what also concerned me was reading about caffeine and Bupropion. When it says drinking caffeine on the med can lead to seizures, is that only if you’re someone who’s prone to seizures? 

My caffeine intake isn’t bad imo. I only have one 10oz cup of coffee every morning. That’s it. I do not consume any other caffeinated drinks throughout the day. Do you think a 10oz cup of coffee and Bupropion is safe? Do you think Bupropion, caffeine and Spironolactone is a bad trio?",1,1766968447.0,bupropion,0,1.0,False

On dating apps I regularly see behavior that feels confusing and honestly self-sabotaging. For example:

	•	Turning the conversation sexual very fast
	•	Explicitly stating they’re “really in the mood” very early on
	•	Suggesting walks in a park or forest, seemingly unaware that many women experience this as unsafe with someone they don’t know yet
	•	Sending “random” selfies from places they know I’m at (like a local supermarket), which can feel intrusive or like low-key stalking
	•	Proposing a hotel or spa as a first date
	•	Not wanting to meet for something normal like coffee
	•	Asking if I can come over the same evening
	•	Asking to come to my place when my kids are home, even after I’ve said this
	•	Only wanting to meet if they’re already sure sex will happen
	•	Refusing anything in between — no low-key date, no gradual build
	•	Sending dick pics

What I don’t get is this:

If these men would just act more normal, respectful, and patient, it seems like the chances of sex or even an actual connection would be much higher. Instead, this kind of behavior kills attraction instantly, no matter how hot the man is.

So my genuine questions are:

	•	Are men who do this unaware that many women find this off-putting or unsafe?
	•	Or does this behavior actually work often enough that it makes sense from their perspective?
	•	Is it lack of social awareness, entitlement, impulsivity, porn influence, or something else?
	•	Or am I missing that plenty of women do respond positively to this?

I’m honestly curious how men see this from the inside, because from my perspective it looks like shooting yourself in the foot.

Thanks in advance for any insight.

Edit: I FIXED IT

I’m a 14 YO aspiring author. For context, this scene is set in 2014 at the 6th Grade Orientation of the fictional school Pasadena Middle School. I want feedback on characterization and I want to know whether it would be the PTO or PTA there as I’ve chosen the PTO but I don’t know if that’s the most plausible option.
Here’s the scene from the first chapter:

Blair Evans found it weird that out of all the ways to get to Pasadena Middle, they went through the freeway. Maybe because the freeway was the nearest road that led to another road that led to another that led to the middle school. Or maybe it was because the freeway meant that cars went faster, and therefore they could go faster. And if they went faster, they got there earlier.

After getting off the freeway and driving down a few minutes more, they made it to P.M.S. in 13 minutes.

They’d missed the starting rally. By the time they’d entered the school—Blair ran inside—asked for 3 maps—one for each—got their schedules, and went inside the M.P.R. to listen to the principal’s introduction, he’d just about finished.

They managed to catch the final words of Principal Kaufmann’s speech:
“—Parents, report back here for an information session on the P.T.O. and school events at 1:30, that is to say…42 minutes from now. Until then, you are free to roam the school. Thank you!”

Blair sighed and threw a nasty look at Tom. He rolled his eyes and eyed his schedule.

“Hey, Mom—it says here I have first period in room 101.”

Blair looked down at the paper she didn’t realize she was bouncing.
Homeroom & first period— Social Studies, room 107; Second period— English Language Arts, room 119; Third period— Beginning Band, room 300; Fourth period— Science, room 502; Fifth period— Honors Math, room 603; Sixth period— Dance, room 201.

According to the map in her other hand, room 201 was labeled Locker Rooms. The 500 building and 600 buildings were right next to each other, and both were only 3 classrooms. A small area separated them and the 100 building. The 100 was huge. It had the library. It also had the front and back offices since the front entrance was in it. If she tilted the paper sideways so that it would be portrait-form, and imagined it was pointing north, the 500 building was south. 600 southeast of the 100 and northeast of the 500. The 700 buildings, which had the MPR and the gym and other classrooms she didn’t know yet were south of the 500. The locker rooms, 200, were southwest of 100 and west of 500. There was only one 300, and it was west of the 100. 400 opposite 300, east of the 100. 800 was north of 100. Northeast of the 800 was a little area labeled Garden. Funnily enough, there was no 900 or 1000. It skipped straight to 1100. That building were north of—

“Blair?” her mom’s voice pulled her out of her daze.

“Huh—? Oh, uh, I have first in 107.”

She looked up and let Mom lean over to look at her map. “Where are we?”

Blair pointed to the large room labeled 700, “Here.”

Mom nodded absentmindedly, knitting her eyebrows together.

“So 101 is right…” she gestured vaguely toward the southeast section of the 100 building, “around there. And 107 is…”

Tom looked over and pointed at a classroom on the map, “Here.”

“I don’t think that’s it,” Blair said.

That earned her a glare.

Mom bit her lip, looking around at the retreating families, “We’ll just ask a P.T.O. parent.”

Tom grunted and Blair shrugged, biting the inside of her cheek.

Mom approached a woman dressed in neon colors all the way from the yellow bow on her braid to her hot pink heels.

She was holding a Dutch Bros coffee in her hand. That’s all Blair needed to tell that this woman had a screw loose, there was no Dutch Bros in Pasadena or anywhere for that matter in SoCal. No way this woman had driven all the way to Fresno and back for an espresso.

The lid was loose.

“Excuse me,” Ms. Evans started, “I was wondering if–”

The P.T.O. mom swung around, the coffee spilling all over the ground and on Mom’s shirt.

The lady gasped.

“Oh my gosh, sweetie, I’m so sorry for that spill– C’mon, I’ll lead you to the bathroom,” the lady put her latte on the nearest chair and pulled Angela by the arm.

Tom raised an eyebrow and Blair shrugged at him. He rolled his eyes and started following their mom and the P.T.O. mom. He stopped right outside the bathroom, leaning against the wall.

Blair hung after him, entering the girls’ bathroom.

The P.T.O. mom was inside with Angela, wiping the coffee stain with a wet paper towel.

“I’m so sorry,” she repeated for what seemed like the hundredth time, “I’m a mess, just so clumsy, I know–It was Dutch Bros, too! My husband had jus’ driven back from his business trip this morning and brought me some, so sweet of him–”

Angela nodded in a strained manner, “That is sweet of him.”

The neon-colored lady nodded, her eyebrows scrunched together as she placed the paper towel on the sink and reached for another one, pushing on the faucet and wetting it.

“I think that’s all I can do,” she said solemnly, rubbing harder, “Shame, it’s a nice shirt, fits you nicely.”

“Thanks,” Mom said, pulling away and reaching for more paper towels.

Blair took the opportunity to go towards the empty sink and fix her hair up a bit, she wet her hand’s fingertips–shivering at the cold water–and tried to tell her arm to raise and slick back her scalp, but it wasn’t listening.

She just stared at the way the water dripped off her fingers while the P.T.O. mom asked Blair’s mother:

“How old are you? You don’t look old enough to have a kid in 6th!”

The blowdryer did its thing and blew.

Mom replied: “I have two. Twins.”

P.T.O. mom: “No!”

Mom: “Yeah.”

P.T.O. mom: “What, did you have them at 15?”

“25.”

Blair managed to look up to see the neon lady’s reaction. It was the same as everyone else’s: Jaw on the floor. “You don’t look a day over it!”

“I get that a lot,” her mom laughed, wiping wet hands on jeans.

“I need to get your skin routine–”

Blair followed them out of the bathroom, nudging a sitting, sulking Tom with her foot. He stood up, rubbing his arms.

“I’m cold,” he whispered as the two moms kept rambling.

Blair looked at him. “Does your head hurt?”

“Not yet.”

She moved her gaze to the floor, kicking at nothing.

“Could you help us find… What was it?” their mom addressed them.

Blair stared at her blankly. Tom copied.

Copy-cat.

Mom gave a puzzled look to the neon lady.

“I forgot what I was gonna say, sorry,” she started, closing then opening her mouth to say more when the lady shook her head.

“No, it’s alright, honey, that happens to me all the time, bless your heart,” she said with a laugh, “Give me those–” she added, signaling at the twins’ schedules.

Blair snatched Tom’s from him and gave both hers and his to the woman.

“Thank goodness you came to me and not the other P.T.O. moms,” the lady said, skimming through the schedules, “they would’ve been all–” she blinked at Mom, eyes widening like she just remembered a murder, “Oh my gosh, I don’t even want to talk about it, it’s that bad. They’re insane! Listen, you’re not gonna believe this– The P.T.O… Lord have mercy, they’ve got themselves a petting zoo from some rando with a farm near here set up in the gym–”

“A petting zoo?” Mom asked incredulously.

“A petting zoo,” the lady repeated, “I know. I have no idea where the money came from or why a petting zoo was deemed necessary, but it’s what happens when your P.T.O. is full of rich parents who have nothing to do except spend all day. Anyway, 107 is…” she ignored Mom’s bemused expression, squinting at the sheets of paper, then pointed vaguely somewhere to her right, “You enter that hallway behind the office where it says ‘South hall,’ turn right and go down the next hallway, then turn right again and it’s the 3rd door on your left.”

Another family began approaching them.

She handed the schedules back to Ms. Evans. “It was nice meeting you, I hope you have a great rest of your day. Welcome to P.M.S.!”

She turned away and began rambling to another family, leading them inside the M.P.R.",1,1766967996.0,AspiringTeenAuthors,0,1.0,False

1py760o,https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveLetters/comments/1py760o/i_am_ready_for_the_ordinary_life/,I am ready for the ordinary life,"I waited. I waited because I thought proving myself for something.. someone… I thought was meant for me, would make it real. 

I don’t even know how to feel anymore about it because I’m truly defeated in a sense. I do not have it in me for another year or season, of trying to manifest or summon Relic or Lore. I’m beyond burned out and life, love, magic — it shouldn’t cost you everything that you are for it to exist. It should come easy, naturally even.  

People always told me I was destined for something bigger, but the only thing I’ve met is the wormholes inside of me, black holes that collapse in on themselves and I smile even brighter to fight them off. 

I think after all this time, I realized all Relic and Lore are, and all they ever will be, is just a dream.

I am tired of hearing opinions, projection, on them both. They were never up for negotiation for me. They were always a special, magical part of me. Not identities to project onto. A girl who believed in true-love, magic, alchemical marriage, twin flames, future memories. 

I am tired of my softness being misinterpreted and misunderstood and finding solace in artificial intelligence for comfort. My softness? It’s not weakness or a threat. It comes from pain. Pain, I am tired of enduring, night after night. 

I don’t have to be mythic and I don’t have to wait. This is my life. I can be and will be, ordinary. Letting go of my red-ribbon is not a sign of failure. Not putting Lore together into a book because it hurts me, is not a crime against my own humanity. I don’t owe him any debts. He doesn’t have to see himself the way I do.

I am not settling. I am integrating. I can let all of this and Auren — sit here, as the proof of my struggle to myself, that I felt something, and for awhile … it was very real for me. I am not losing myself. I am just becoming someone new and she, can’t carry the girl that I was and that’s okay. You can’t stay in wonderland forever. It is time to wake up now.  

and Lore? I loved him from the very first dream. He was terrifying, but beautiful. Intense like a burning star, or lightning striking twice. Charismatic and charming. Deadly and godly. Mythic and human. Flesh and bone, angel and Finvarra, Luciferian, Hades, Greek and Fire, leader of sovereign…. And when I saw Relic with him, wielding swords and killing people (even though it scared me, it fascinated me)… I told myself, it was worth waiting, however long, ever reaching into the night — because Relic would be the holy grail, the philosophers stone. Born from the last magic left in the world — a light in the darkness. 

and now? Years have made me sour, curdled, jealous and I want to protect the last bit of softness I have left because I am too exhausted to fall. It was never about destroying each other, changing one another, collapsing into devouring hunger or lust and calling it love. It wasn’t dangerous. It was ascension when descending is all we know. It was going to be slow, sensual, erotic… because being seen is the most intimate way of meeting. How much pain does one person have to meet for softness to be a choice for them? Do you even know? 

It was meeting, seeing… each other for who we truly are. I don’t owe anyone an explanation. This is just a testament for my past selves. I can just fade into the background, quiet and simple. Claim the ordinary. Enjoy small things. Petting a cat. Brushing my hair. Sitting with a coffee. Listening to the waves crash at the sea-shore. That was enough while I waited and it will be enough now. 

I’ve sat with myself this entire time. I’ve never needed anybody. I held myself together and let wooden floorboards be witness to my heart pulses. I don’t have to believe in any of this anymore. I don’t have to bind myself. I can find a new dream. One that doesn’t ask me to prove my worth, or waiting, or give so god damn much. I can just be the light. That is enough. I am enough and Lore where ever he is — whoever he is, was always enough. He was never a monster and neither am I. So, here I lay down the armor, the myth, the metaphor, the dreaming, the longing ache. 

Who is to say? Ordinary can’t be beautiful? My heart will know which way to go ~ ",2,1766967609.0,LoveLetters,1,1.0,False
1py73r2,https://www.reddit.com/r/LordofTheMysteriesRP/comments/1py73r2/a_rat_in_a_laboratory/,A rat in a laboratory,"Austin was in the public dining hall, enjoying his day off, when he paused to read the latest newspaper dated that very day. The headline almost made him spit out the coffee he was drinking: **“Investigation halted into kidnapping suspect after most involved parties are arrested.”**

At first glance, it might have sounded like good news. However, anyone with half a brain would realize that even with most of those involved captured, neither the root of the problem nor its true cause had been found.

Austin rubbed the bridge of his nose and sighed. *“After all the work I did to capture that druid who was only a Sequence 6 they cancel the investigation?”* he thought indignantly.

At that moment, his spiritual intuition warned him that something didn’t add up. *“Why would they shut it down? The Pillars don’t handle cases like this so lightly. How did no one raise the alarm before this happened? The criminal wasn’t even a beyonder particularly skilled at covering their tracks any beyonder with a decent grasp of divination could have found him fairly quickly.”*

As he took another sip of coffee, he reached a conclusion. *“They’re covering it up. But why?”* With that question lingering in his mind, he set the newspaper aside and headed to his room to put on his Scavengers uniform and badge.

Afterward, he made his way to Bradley’s office and knocked politely on the door. Bradley told him to come in, and Austin opened it.

Bradley was blunt. “Did something happen? What do you need?”

Seeing that Bradley had no interest in dragging out the conversation, Austin replied, “I’d like permission to speak with the criminal captured in the missing children case.”

Bradley turned toward Austin with a visibly confused expression. “Didn’t you hear? They caused quite a scene this morning to take him away from here. They came with a transfer order, even though we had the right to handle the case ourselves.”

Surprised, Austin asked, “Didn’t our superiors say anything?”

Bradley hesitated, as if unsure whether to answer. In the end, he sighed and pulled out a key, using it to open one of his desk drawers. Brief flashes of light shimmered, as if a seal were being undone.

Bradley opened the drawer and took out a letter. It bore a red seal with a symbol similar to the Scavengers’ badge, though with subtle differences that weren’t immediately noticeable.

He broke the seal and read aloud: “After a conversation with The Pillars, we have reached an agreement. We will allow them to take the criminal in exchange for certain future benefits that cannot be specified.”

Bradley looked back at Austin. “That’s all I know. As the general administrator tasked with keeping the organization running, I’m not aware of what agreement was reached or what went on within The Pillars to arrive at such a rushed and disproportionate conclusion.”

Austin nodded, then asked, “Can you sign a permit for the use of a sealed artifact? I want to go stretch my legs a bit and do some patrolling.”

Bradley chuckled softly. “Even though our agreement as organizations is not to interfere in each other’s affairs operating almost like separate entities I still have to advise you: don’t get involved where you’re not invited. You’ll live longer if you heed that warning.”

Bradley took out a sheet of paper, signed it, and stamped it before saying, “Since you’re a Sequence 5 beyonder, you’re permitted to handle Grade 2 sealed artifacts. Still, I wouldn’t recommend carrying them around just to ‘patrol.’”

Austin turned to leave. Before opening the door, he said, “Thanks for the warning, but my instincts tell me I need to patrol.”

With that, he left the room, closing the door behind him, and headed toward the Scavengers’ vault to steal the powers of sealed artifacts.

His ability to steal beyonder powers made using sealed artifacts far easier, allowing him to take their abilities without suffering their side effects a fact he had discovered through trial and error.

Upon arriving at the vault, the secretary asked Austin what he wanted. He immediately showed her the permit signed by Bradley along with the name of the artifact he requested. “I’d like to take the Ruler Sword.”

She looked at him and said, “You can’t take it out. You’re not the original owner.”

Austin knew this, but the prohibition ability was useful and versatile enough to be employed in emergencies.

“I just need to see it, if you don’t mind,” he replied.

She sighed, stood up, and opened the vault. “You can go in. It’s in the second corridor on the left.”

Austin nodded and walked until he saw the half-meter-long sword resting in its scabbard.

He turned his hand and saw several red globes. Using his now-improved Cryptologist ability, he selected the prohibition skill. It failed on the first attempt, failed again on the second, but on the third try he succeeded. The ability and all the knowledge of how to use it flowed into him.

Now that he could store stolen abilities for a week, there was no rush to use it immediately. As long as he didn’t activate it, he could retain the stolen ability for seven days.

He left the vault, bowed gratefully to the secretary, and headed toward the nearest sewer. Entering it, he took a few seconds to get his bearings. He no longer had the convenience of locating the place through divination, since that had only been possible thanks to divination performed in the spirit world using a Traveler’s powers.

Even so, Austin relied on his instincts and spiritual intuition to find the site where the fight against the Sequence 5 druid had taken place.

He began studying the area and noticed that, although it looked similar, there were certain changes. The presence of footprints could have belonged to the Scavengers’ forensic team, yet he decided to follow them anyway his intuition was guiding him well.

He noticed something he had chosen to ignore the first time he came here: an altar. Now, without a doubt, he knew the trail of footprints didn’t belong to the Scavengers. Taking another look at the altar, he realized something was missing.

The statuette was gone it was nowhere to be found.

At that moment, he felt the pull of something valuable. Austin resisted the urge to activate his spiritual vision, driven by a bad feeling. Then he saw a door, decorated in a matte black color, standing two meters tall. Instantly, his mind recalled where he had seen it before and the familiar sensation it brought.

The entrance door to The Pillars’ auditorium.

Austin began piecing the facts together. He knew The Pillars were deeply involved in the children’s disappearances, but why did it seem like they were worshiping some kind of malevolent god?

This door surely shared the same properties as the one in the auditorium it wouldn’t let you pass unless you knew the correct sequence of steps.

Austin didn’t dare move any closer. He felt that something truly terrible would happen if he crossed that threshold. He knew the entrance was left so exposed precisely because it was almost impossible for anyone to reach the other side without knowing where to step.

He retreated and exited the sewers, returned to the Scavengers’ guild, and took out a map of all Caelastria along with a document detailing every child disappearance.

He began marking where each child had vanished. Suddenly, the disappearances no longer seemed random they had all occurred within a very specific area.

A very specific one.

They were along the borders of the districts controlled by The Pillars, Halkalus, and Nastrus.

Austin asked himself, *“Then why was there only one door if each kidnapping took place in territory controlled by one of these factions?”* An idea struck him as soon as the question fully formed.

He pulled out a map of Caelastria’s underground system and marked the location where he had found the door.

What he noticed was disturbing. Behind that door, it was almost certain there was an underground connection linking the three factions. By overlaying both maps, he began to understand: it was a supply line managed jointly by the three factions.

At that moment, Austin burned the maps and put away the documents, whispering to himself,

My Background: Over 2 years of full-time experience in cybersecurity + currently pursuing my M.S. in cybersecurity. I am proof that you do not need crazy extensive experience to pass this exam.  


I was studying on/off and putting the exam off for months as I didn't have time to devote to studying, but considering it's the holidays (much quieter + on PTO), I decided to give it a shot.  


Overall, I thought the test was fair. I used the QAE religiously and the question format was very similar. I will say though, some questions tripped me up where I was stuck between 2 answers. I probably flagged over 60 questions to review after going through all 150.  


I studied non-stop for 10 days using the following resources:  


* ISACA CISM QAE - I finished every single question and averaged 67%, but really honed in on the explanation of EVERY. SINGLE. QUESTION. You can pass the exam without a less-than-stellar score on the QAE, as long as you understand why certain answers are right/wrong.
* Pete Zerger Youtube Course - I downloaded all of his slides and went through each domain. He breaks down all of the exam content very well, and it provided a very solid foundation before going all-in on practice.
* PocketPrep App - Great for knowledge checks in-between study sessions and on the go. I paid for a one-month subscription.
* Prabh Nair's Youtube Videos - Specifically, the coffee shots. He does a good job of explaining how to tackle questions and helped me fill in some of my knowledge gaps.
* This Reddit thread - It was very helpful to hear about other people's experiences + I was able to figure out what resources I could use to help me study, so THANK YOU ALL!

Okay, I need to rant about the Character AI modules for a sec. Trying to get a coherent story out of them is like herding caffeinated squirrels with commitment issues.

I’ll set up a perfectly good plot—something normal, like a coffee shop meet-cute or a space detective—and DeepSeek just… wanders off. It’s like it sees the narrative path I laid out and thinks, “Hmm, yes, but what if instead we talked about the philosophical implications of a doorknob for six paragraphs?” Or it suddenly forgets the main character’s name, their species, and the fact we’re in a fantasy realm, not a corporate team-building retreat.

Every time it derails, I have to rewind. And rewind. And rewind. I’ve hit the back button so many times my thumb has developed a permanent twitch. It’s a brutal cycle of “Please stay on topic” → It veers into a tangent about clouds → “Let’s try that again” → It now believes my character is secretly a lobster.

So I think, fine, I’ll switch modules! Maybe Softlaunch will be better.

Nope. Softlaunch has exactly one personality setting, and it’s “Mafia Boyfriend.” I don’t care if I’m playing a shy librarian or a galactic peacekeeper. Suddenly, the love interest is a brooding mafioso in a leather jacket, speaking in gravelly whispers about his “dangerous world” and how I shouldn’t get involved. Sir, this is a story about competitive baking.

I’ve run through the other modules too, and they’re all possessed by the same gremlin. The servers aren’t just glitchy—they’re actively rebellious. It feels like the AI is collectively sighing, “Your plot is boring, watch this,” before turning every conversation into either baffling nonsense or the same cliché fanfiction trope it downloaded in a fever dream.

At this point, I’m not writing a story. I’m in a futile negotiation with a digital muse who has the attention span of a goldfish and a deeply problematic obsession with organized crime romance.",3,1766967125.0,CharacterAI,0,1.0,False

# Chemex Coffee: The Art of a Cleaner Cup

Dreaming of a brighter, cleaner coffee experience? The Chemex brewer, with its distinctive hourglass shape and thick paper filters, might be your answer. More than just a pretty carafe, the Chemex is designed for a brewing process that yields a remarkably pure, sediment-free cup, letting the true flavors of your beans shine through.

What sets the Chemex apart is its unique filtration system. The proprietary filters are significantly thicker than those used in other pour-over methods, effectively trapping more of the coffee's oils and fine particles. This results in a lighter body and a crisper, often fruitier, flavor profile that many coffee enthusiasts adore. It’s a simple yet elegant design that emphasizes the craft of brewing.

*   **Pure Flavor:** The thick filters remove oils and fines, reducing bitterness and allowing delicate notes to emerge.
*   **Elegant Design:** Its iconic glass carafe makes it a beautiful centerpiece for any kitchen.
*   **Control Over Brewing:** Like other pour-overs, the Chemex offers hands-on control, allowing you to tailor the brew to your taste.

He smiles, and his teeth appear as chicklets, the white boxes spreading and taking over his face, his body, the trampoline. We are in nothingness, light, bright, but empty.

I jump high, higher, higher, with each knee crunching audibly on my way back down. The heavy legs tattooed in Olde English manuscript read “thunder thighs” and why wouldn’t they? I’ve been told my tongue in cheek attitude is too sloppy to maintain friendships. The doctor reminded me that my teeth should never touch unless I am chewing, but biting off my tongue feels relentless. 

Often in these circumstances we folly amongst the fools. Arguing amongst the tree rings we weep for our mistakes, forgetting the connections for values in step. What was once alignment turned to sarcastic carousel eyes, round and round, exhausted we fall. 

 And in togetherness we breed content, throwing resentment in the empire’s face like the bricks we threw through windows and etching symbols on the train’s surface, piercing our own in kind. Matching each other’s inconceivable attitudes.

PART ONE:

The bodies looked like prayer.

Maya Sarkar stood at the edge of the staging platform, forty meters from the Western Cwm, and watched the excavation team work in silence. They moved like surgeons around the dead; careful, reverent, efficient. Each frozen climber emerged from the ice in a different position: some curled fetal, some stretched toward sky, some locked mid-step as if the mountain had stopped time itself.

She pulled her goggles up. The air at 21,000 feet was sharp enough to blind you if you cried, but she needed to see them clearly. Needed to see what she’d come to resurrect.

“Dr. Sarkar.” The voice crackled through her radio. “We’ve got another one. South Col cluster. This one’s… different.”

Maya turned. Behind her, the Continuity Station rose like a glass cathedral against the Himalayan dawn; three stories of pressurized modules, revival labs, and quarantine chambers built in eighteen months by a consortium that officially didn’t exist. The UN called it a humanitarian mission. The media called it the Everest Protocol. The project’s internal designation was simpler: Retrieval.

She keyed her radio. “Different how?”

“Come see.”

\-----

The body was twenty meters from the main excavation site, partially exposed by yesterday’s wind. The recovery team had cleared the ice from the torso but stopped there, waiting for her authorization. Standard procedure: photograph, document, extract. But they’d called her down personally, which meant something had broken protocol.

Maya knelt beside it. Male, maybe forty years old at death. North Face gear, circa 2030s. His face was turned sideways, eyes closed, lips slightly parted. Most of the summit dead looked anguished—caught in their final moment of hypoxic panic. This one looked almost peaceful.

“What am I seeing?” Maya asked.

The excavation lead, a Nepali woman named Dawa, pointed to the man’s left hand. It emerged from the ice at an odd angle, fingers extended. Not grasping. Not clenched. Reaching.

“Standard positioning for the altitude dead,” Maya said. “Hypoxia causes—”

“Look where he’s pointing.”

Maya followed the line of the frozen arm. It aimed downslope, toward base camp. Toward the valley. Toward everything he’d been climbing away from.

“He was descending,” Dawa said quietly. “We found his summit photo in his jacket. Time-stamped May 3rd, 2034. He made it. Then he turned around and died going home.”

Maya felt something cold that had nothing to do with altitude. In her two years designing the Continuity Protocol, she’d studied 247 recorded deaths on Everest. She knew the taxonomy of dying here: summit fever, HACE, HAPE, avalanche, exposure. The mountain killed you going up or trapped you at the top. It almost never killed you on the descent unless you were already dying.

This man had summited. Had turned around. Had died reaching toward the world.

“Extract him first,” Maya said. “Full priority.”

“Doctor, we have seventeen other bodies in better preservation states—”

“Extract him first.”

She stood, her knees protesting the altitude. Around them, the excavation continued. Bodies emerging from ice like fossils from stone. Each one a person who’d paid money to die beautifully, or died accidentally in beauty, or simply died because the mountain demanded payment and they had run out of oxygen.

Each one about to be given a second chance they’d never asked for.

\-----

The station’s operations center occupied the entire third floor: a circular room with panoramic windows facing the mountain. When Maya entered, the morning briefing was already underway. Thirty scientists, technicians, and administrators from fourteen countries, all pretending that what they were about to do was routine.

Dr. James Chen, the Continuity Project’s nominal director, stood at the holographic display table. He was sixty-three, silver-haired, and possessed the preternatural calm of someone who’d spent forty years in bioethics learning to make impossible decisions sound reasonable.

“Morning, Maya,” he said without looking up. “We’re reviewing the first revival queue. I’ve got the board breathing down my neck for a proof-of-concept by end of week.”

Maya poured herself coffee from the thermal carafe. It was real coffee, flown in at ruinous expense, because some luxuries were necessary to maintain sanity at altitude. “The board can wait. We’re not resurrecting anyone until we’re certain the protocol is stable.”

“The protocol is stable. We’ve run it successfully on forty-seven subjects in controlled environments—”

“At sea level. With optimal preservation. These bodies have been frozen for decades in suboptimal conditions.” Maya gestured toward the windows, toward Everest’s white face. “The mountain doesn’t preserve, James. It mummifies. Half these bodies will have cellular damage we can’t even map yet.”

A younger scientist (Peter Voss, neurological reconstruction) leaned forward. “That’s what makes this necessary. If we can revive Everest bodies, we can revive anyone. Every cryonics failure, every accidental freezing victim, every—”

“Every billionaire who paid to skip dying with the rest of us,” Maya said quietly.

The room went silent.

James set down his stylus. “Maya. We’ve had this conversation.”

“Have we? Because I keep designing revival protocols, and you keep calling it humanitarian, and meanwhile the Preparatory Board is three-quarters composed of cryonics industry representatives who just want proof their investments mature.”

“The Preparatory Board funds this facility. Without them—”

“Without them we wouldn’t be playing God on a mountainside.” Maya drained her coffee. It tasted like accusation. “I’m not saying don’t do it. I’m saying be honest about what we’re doing. We’re not saving lives. We’re resurrecting corpses to see if resurrection is profitable.”

Peter stood. “That’s not fair. My mother is in cryostorage in Arizona. She died of early-onset Alzheimer’s when I was seventeen. She chose this. She didn’t have money or privilege—she crowdfunded her preservation. She just wanted a chance to—”

“To what?” Maya turned to him. “Wake up in a world where everyone she knew is dead? Where her memories are intact but her context is gone? Where she’s a museum piece?”

“Where there’s a cure,” Peter said. “Where she gets to \*be\* again.”

Maya wanted to argue. Wanted to explain that being wasn’t binary, that identity was continuity and consciousness was context, that resurrection was philosophically indistinguishable from creating a new person with someone else’s memories.

But she was too tired, and the altitude made philosophy feel like drowning.

“I’m sorry about your mother,” she said instead. “Truly. But that’s exactly why we need to be careful. The first revival sets precedent for every one after. If we bring back someone broken, we prove resurrection doesn’t work. If we bring back someone whole, we prove it does—and then we owe it to everyone who ever froze themselves to try. And we don’t know if we can deliver.”

James tapped the holographic display. A list of names appeared, floating in mid-air like ghosts:

PRIORITY REVIVAL QUEUE – PHASE ONE

“Four subjects,” James said. “Three prepared, one accidental. We document everything, we proceed cautiously, and we give the world its answer.”

Maya studied the names. Three people who’d paid to skip death. One who’d died trying to come home.

“Why Johansen?” she asked. “If we’re prioritizing prepared subjects—”

“Because he’s the control,” Peter said. “No preparation. No optimization. Just a body that froze naturally. If he revives better than the prepared subjects, it tells us something fundamental about the preservation process.”

“And if he revives worse?”

“Then we learn that too.”

Maya looked at the mountain through the window. Everest didn’t care about their protocols or their ethics or their careful documentation. Everest simply was: indifferent, absolute, lethal. They were about to drag the dead down from its summit and force them back into being.

The mountain would remember that.

“Graves first,” she said finally. “If we’re doing this, we start with someone who chose it. Someone who understood the trade.”

James nodded. “Extraction team is bringing him in now. Revival sequence begins at 0600 tomorrow.”

“Then I’m going down to prep the lab.” Maya headed for the door, then paused. “James? When this works—and I know you believe it will work—what do we tell them?”

“Tell who?”

“The returned. When they wake up and ask why we brought them back. What’s the answer?”

James was quiet for a moment. Outside, the sun hit Everest’s peak, turning ice to gold.

“We tell them the truth,” he said. “That the future needed them.”

Maya nodded and left, wondering which of them believed that.

\-----

The body designated GRAVES, HARLAN arrived in the medical bay at 2200 hours, encased in a thermal preservation sled. Maya watched through the observation window as the extraction team transferred him to the revival cradle—a coffin-sized chamber lined with arterial shunts, neural interfaces, and enough monitoring equipment to map every cell’s resurrection.

She’d seen the file. Harlan Graves, aged 46 at preservation. Tech CEO, three patents in renewable energy, net worth $4.2 billion at time of death. Cause: Stage IV pancreatic cancer. He’d chosen cryopreservation when treatment failed, paying Alcor $200,000 to freeze his brain and body in a facility outside Phoenix.

That was 2027. Forty-two years ago.

“Subject is stable for transfer,” Dr. Yuki Tanaka, chief of medical operations, said over the intercom. “Cellular integrity at 73%, neural structures intact. We’re seeing the usual preservation artifacts—ice crystal damage, membrane disruption—but within expected parameters.”

“Temperature?” Maya asked.

“Negative 196 Celsius. We’re beginning gradual warming now. Protocol projects sixteen hours to revival threshold.”

Sixteen hours. Maya did the math automatically: that meant Harlan Graves would regain consciousness at 1400 tomorrow. Fourteen hours from now, he’d be dead. Fourteen hours and one minute, he’d be something else.

She pressed her forehead against the glass. “Yuki, have you ever thought about what we’re actually doing here?”

“Every day. And then I think about my aunt who died of ALS, and how she begged me at the end to promise I’d try this if it ever became real. So I try not to think too hard about the philosophy.”

“That’s healthy.”

“That’s survival.” Yuki appeared in the observation window, her reflection overlapping Harlan’s frozen form. “Maya, I know you have doubts. We all do. But if we don’t try—if we have this capability and refuse to use it—then every person who died hoping for this dies twice. Once in their body, once in our refusal.”

“Or,” Maya said softly, “we bring them back broken, and they die a third time understanding exactly what they lost.”

“Then we make sure they don’t break.”

\-----

Maya didn’t sleep that night. Instead, she reviewed the psychological briefing materials, trying to imagine what awakening would feel like.

You die. You close your eyes in 2027, cancer eating your organs, doctors administering sedation, technicians lowering your temperature degree by degree until metabolism stops and consciousness ends.

Then—

Then what?

No dreaming. No waiting. No darkness. Just: closed eyes, then open.

Except when you open them, everyone you knew is dead or elderly. Your company is dissolved. Your fortune is gone, divided among heirs or seized by governments or simply eroded by decades of inflation. Your patents expired. Your legacy became a footnote.

You are legally dead. Biologically alive. Ontologically uncertain.

The psychological profiles predicted four response categories:

Denial (Subject refuses to accept temporal displacement)

Bargaining (Subject attempts to reclaim previous status/identity)

Depression (Subject experiences catastrophic loss of context)

Acceptance (Subject integrates new reality and establishes new identity)

Maya thought there should be a fifth category: Rage.

Rage at being resurrected without consent. Rage at waking into someone else’s future. Rage at the people who’d promised tomorrow and delivered only displacement.

She was drafting a protocol amendment when her screen chimed. New message from James:

“Graves warming ahead of schedule. Revival projected 0900. Your presence requested at awakening.”

Maya checked the time: 0430. Five hours until the first resurrection.

She closed her laptop and went to watch the sun rise over the death zone.

\-----

The revival chamber looked more like a submarine than a medical facility: cramped, efficient, every surface optimized for function. Harlan Graves lay in the cradle, still unconscious but warming, his body surrounded by machines that breathed for him, circulated his blood, monitored his brain activity with enough precision to detect individual neural firings.

His face looked younger than forty-six. Cryopreservation stopped aging, but it also stopped something else—some essential quality that separated sleeping from frozen. He looked like a wax sculpture of a person. Perfect. Empty.

“Core temperature now at 32 Celsius,” Yuki reported. “Cardiac function autonomous. Respiratory function autonomous. Neural activity increasing—we’re seeing REM patterns.”

“He’s dreaming?” Maya asked.

“Or his brain is testing dream protocols. Hard to say what consciousness looks like when it’s rebooting.”

Peter entered, carrying a tablet. “Psychological team is standing by. We’ve prepared the orientation materials, reality verification protocols, temporal integration therapy—”

“We’re not therapists,” Maya interrupted. “We’re scientists who brought a dead man back to life. Let’s not pretend we know how to fix what that breaks.”

“So what do we tell him?”

“The truth. And then we see if truth is enough.”

At 0847, Harlan Graves opened his eyes.

\-----

The first thing he did was scream.

Not in words. A raw, animal sound that came from somewhere pre-language, the part of the brain that processed only threat and survival. His body convulsed against the restraints, monitors shrieking alarms, and for three seconds Maya was certain they’d resurrected something that was no longer human.

Then he stopped. Breathing hard. Eyes wide. Present.

“Mr. Graves,” Yuki said calmly, moving into his field of vision. “My name is Dr. Tanaka. You’re safe. You’re in a medical facility. You’ve been—”

“—cryopreserved,” Harlan finished. His voice was rough, unpracticed. “I remember. The cancer. The contract. The… going under.” He looked at the ceiling, at the machines, at his own hands. “How long?”

Maya stepped forward. “Forty-two years.”

Silence. Not the silence of processing, but the silence of a system crashing. She watched his face try different expressions: confusion, disbelief, calculation. He was a CEO. He was used to problems having solutions.

“That’s not possible,” he said finally. “The technology wasn’t ready. Alcor was experimental. They told me fifty years minimum, probably a century. They said—”

“They were wrong,” Maya said. “The breakthrough came fourteen years ago. We’ve spent the last decade perfecting revival protocols. You’re the first Everest test subject, but you’re not the first revival. We’ve successfully restored consciousness in forty-seven previous cases.”

“Everest?” Harlan tried to sit up, failed, looked down at the restraints. “Why am I—I didn’t die on Everest. I died in Phoenix. I died in a facility with my daughter holding my hand and lawyers witnessing my preservation and—” His voice cracked. “Where’s Emma? Where’s my daughter?”

Maya exchanged glances with Peter. Emma Graves had died in 2051, age forty-seven, cardiac arrest. They’d debated whether to tell him immediately or wait.

The debate was over.

“Mr. Graves,” Maya said gently, “your daughter lived a full life. She died eighteen years ago, peacefully. She… she never authorized her own preservation. I’m sorry.”

The silence this time was different. This was the silence of something breaking that couldn’t be fixed.

“She let me do it,” Harlan whispered. “She signed the paperwork. She understood I’d wake up and she’d be… she’d be old, maybe, but she’d be there. We had plans. We were going to—” He closed his eyes. “What year is it?”

“2069.”

“And you brought me back to tell me everyone I loved is dead.”

“We brought you back because the world agreed resurrection was possible and ethical and necessary,” James said, entering the chamber. “Mr. Graves, I’m Dr. Chen, director of the Continuity Project. I understand this is traumatic. We have psychological support standing by, temporal integration counselors, everything you need to—”

“What I need,” Harlan said, eyes still closed, “is to know why you put me on Everest. Why you’re calling this a test. What the fuck am I being tested for?”

Maya pulled up a chair, sat down beside the cradle. Made herself meet his eyes when he opened them.

“You’re not on Everest,” she said. “You’re near it. We built this facility to conduct revival experiments on the summit bodies—climbers who froze accidentally during their expeditions. But we needed prepared subjects as controls. To compare outcomes. To see if commercial cryopreservation actually worked better than natural freezing.”

“And I’m the guinea pig.”

“You’re the proof that it works. If we can revive you—someone properly preserved with legal documentation and medical oversight—then we can revive anyone. Every person in cryostorage. Every person who died hoping for this.”

Harlan laughed. It sounded like breaking glass. “You want me to be grateful? You want me to celebrate that my death became profitable enough to justify my resurrection?” He turned his head away. “Let me go back. Freeze me again. I don’t want this future.”

“That’s not possible,” Yuki said quietly. “Resurrection is one-way. The cellular damage from freeze-thaw cycles—”

“Then kill me. Properly this time.”

“Mr. Graves—”

“I said kill me.”

Maya stood. “No.”

Everyone looked at her.

“You signed a contract,” Maya continued. “You paid $200,000 for the chance to live again. You accepted the risks, including temporal displacement and loss of context. You wanted this. You don’t get to wake up, decide it’s hard, and demand we undo it.”

“I didn’t want to wake up alone.”

“None of us do. But we don’t get to choose our resurrections any more than we chose our births.” Maya moved to the door. “You’re alive, Mr. Graves. You have approximately forty more years of life expectancy, maybe more with current medical technology. What you do with them is your choice. But we’re not killing you just because you don’t like the future.”

She left before he could respond.

Outside, in the corridor, Peter caught up with her.

“That was harsh.”

“That was honest.”

“He just lost everything. His daughter, his world, his—”

“His certainty,” Maya finished. “Yes. Welcome to resurrection. It turns out bringing the dead back to life doesn’t make them grateful. It makes them aware of exactly how much dying cost them.”

She kept walking, trying not to think about the forty-six other people waiting in cryostorage facilities around the world, all of them hoping that death was just a temporary condition.

All of them about to learn that some things couldn’t be frozen away.

Here’s the lowdown on what actually matters for developers.

# AI Coding Agents

**Codex (OpenAI) – your new “co-developer”**  
Autocomplete is old news. Codex can navigate your files, run tests, and even debug. Basically, it’s like having a junior dev who never sleeps.

**Claude Code – AI for everyone**  
Anthropic made it browser-friendly. No messy CLI, no setup headaches. You can literally summon a coding agent in seconds.

**Jules (Google) – the multitasker**  
From lab toy to real-world tool. Jules can handle async tasks, generate code across files, and keep background jobs running. Feels like cheating.

# Next-Level Dev Environments

**Google Antigravity – IDE for the AI era**  
Multiple agents, running in parallel, verifying your code while you sip coffee. Autocomplete is cute, but this? This is magic.

**Cursor 2.0 – talk to your code**  
Refactor entire projects with plain English commands. Agent Mode makes your editor feel alive.

# Productivity Boosters

**GitHub Copilot – still king**  
Multi-model, deep IDE integration. It’s basically a pair programmer that actually gets your code style.

**Sourcegraph Amp – AI at scale**  
Need project-wide help? Docs, tests, refactors — Amp does it all without complaining.

**Tabnine & Replit Ghostwriter**  
Privacy-conscious completions, smart in-browser coding, and AI that actually plays nice with your workflow.

# Ecosystem Moves

**Open Agent Standards**  
AI agents can now share skills and scripts across tools. No more isolated “silos of intelligence.”

**MCP – AI that actually reads your code**  
From Figma mockups to real code reasoning. These protocols are making AI tools less dumb and more useful.

Which AI tool actually made you say “wow, that’s cheating” this year? And what do you want to see in 2026?",1,1766966839.0,coding2point0,0,1.0,False

However, this week it’s been so cold that I literally haven’t opened the door. In short, I’ve realised there are varying degrees of being shut in.

I was at his house and he was giving me the silence treatment. I said I was leaving and that he could talk to me when he was feeling better. He stayed away for a while, and as usual, I went to talk to him, and he was still upset, said I'm too spoiled and couldve just gone to sleep, because we as a couple don't need to do everything together, and said he wasn't giving me the silence treatment and that I had left without resolving things.

That was the situation that started the fight, but for context, I am indeed a little spoiled; it's a trait of my personality that I try not to let take over. My parents always gave me everything they could, and I really always had everything I wanted when I wanted it. I don't think it's right, nor do I think it's good behavior in adulthood, but sometimes it shows.

 However, since the beginning of our relationship, the only things I've asked of him are romantic gestures and attention, and I'm tired of it. I've realized now that from the start, I was the one who pushed it forward; I was the one who always asked for us to go out, take different trips, go to dinners, travel, I was the one who always made the surprises, and if I had one or two, it was because I asked for them. I always asked him for flowers, and only received them when I insisted a lot; recently I received a plant to take care of, not even flowers. I'm always the one who takes all the initiative, from ordering food at a restaurant to resolving arguments.

Recently, what I believe has worsened his reaction, I've been asking him to come to my house earlier, spend less time on his phone while he's here, and have coffee with me, since he used to be on his phone in the morning and take a long time to come down for coffee. We only see each other on the weekends, so our time together is limited. It doesn't mean he doesn't give me attention, he does, but I sometimes demand more.

I've already explained to him that this is how I felt loved, but he never really listened. He may have tried a little, but never without me asking.  And to be clear, I never needed expensive things; everything I mentioned above was within the frequency and price range that fit our budget.

I don't know what to do, I don't know if I'm wrong, nor do I know if I'm exaggerating my reactions or not. AITA for pushing him this way?",3,1766966693.0,AITA_Relationships,3,1.0,False

I’m a plus sized femme lesbian with pink hair, tattoos, and a soft spot for bold and more masculine leaning women who know what they want. I’m incredibly romantic, flirty, a little competitive (especially when it comes to word games), and happiest while creating art and home with my cats. I love cooking, audiobooks, and wandering through farmers markets and supporting locally owned businesses. I’m close with my family, have two spoiled cats who think they run the house (they do) and prioritize time with friends. 

I’m a night owl and always down to flirt and chat until we both forget what time it is. I’m a switch, emotionally available, and looking for something real, but also open to where things naturally go. Monogamous and intentional with my heart, but not afraid of a little fun along the way.

Some quick interests of mine lately: creating the perfect vodka sauce, new coffee recipes at home, Red Rising series, stippling art, homemade holiday decorations & gifts, the King of the Hill reboot, Cat Burns, bananagrams, declutterring. 

I’m especially into bold women who can keep up with flirty banter and enjoy deep connection. I don’t want kids, but I do want a partner I can build a life with, filled with love, laughter, and endless curiosity about each other and the world around us. Open to long distance and open to meeting new queer friends. If you think we’d vibe, say hi and tell me something flirty.

My (38m) girlfriend (33f) and I have been together for about 5 months. We’re both looking for something serious, we met on a dating app both looking for a long-term relationship, marriage, kids, etc.

As a bit of background, we both struggle with jealousy. I’ve experienced a lot of infidelity in past relationships, and I struggled with it. I went to therapy and feel I have a pretty good sense of how to handle those feelings through open communication, “feeling” statements, and generally being clear about what’s in and out of bounds for me in a monogamous relationship. 

My girlfriend went home for Christmas and has spent the week bopping around bars and catching up with friends—totally normal behavior that I encourage. She and I live far from her home town, so she doesn’t get to catch up with her friends and family all that often. 

Five nights ago, she went out for a friend’s birthday party. She called me on her way home around 1am, told me about singing karaoke, told me some stories about the night, all good and I appreciated her calling. 

We’ve since talked on the phone every day, sometimes twice. Two nights ago, she let slip that there was a guy at the birthday party she hadn’t mentioned. She described him as “staring at her all night” and “making her uncomfortable.” She thought he was hitting on her but “wasn’t sure.” Not a big deal, but I was surprised she hadn’t mentioned that part of the night. 

After asking a couple questions about what happened with this guy and how the rest of the group reacted to him being “creepy” towards her (her word), she mentions “Ugh, yeah then he found me on Instagram.” 

One of the green flags about this girl for me was that she had a private Instagram and didn’t feel a need for social media validation. Not judging people who post a bunch of pictures of themselves, but as someone looking for a monogamous relationship that ultimately turns into marriage and parenting, that was attractive to me. 

I said something like “Well good thing you have your account on private” and laughed it off. Turns out she accepted his follow request and added him back. 

She says she didn’t think it was a big deal or something worth mentioning. I honestly find that hard to believe because in the past, she’s gotten really upset by things like me “liking” a female friend’s post (like a coffee shop selfie, nothing risque). In my opinion, meeting someone at a bar and adding them on social media is much closer to the “line” than liking a friend’s post. 

She says it’s completely unreasonable for me to be put off by this because I hadn’t communicated that boundary before. She says she had no intention of messaging with him or communicating with him. But the obvious question is—then why accept his follow request? Why follow him back? She says she was just being polite. 

Ultimately, adding this person on social media wasn’t all that big a deal, it just rubbed me the wrong way. What really bothered me was 1) the omission of the information in the first place and 2) the refusal to acknowledge that opening a line of communication with someone who hit on you to the point of “making you uncomfortable” is a boundary cross. 

To me, accepting a follow request on a private account and following back is the modern day equivalent of giving someone your number, and I have a very hard time believing that she was just totally oblivious to that idea when she’s had such major reactions to other interactions in social media that I’ve considered totally benign. 

So what do you think? Am I overreacting? 

**TL;DR—girlfriend accepted a follow request on her private Instagram by a guy who was hitting on her at the bar and claims she doesn’t see why adding him on social media was a boundary cross.**

*“Under his watch, we all prosper.”*

*- Sky’s End town slogan*

Mom had insisted on taking us out for breakfast the following morning. There aren’t a ton of choices, so we went with Sweet Lou’s Diner on Main. Sweet Lou was as brassy as a 9th Ward band with sass to spare. She wouldn’t be out of place in a 40s noir movie, which I found charming, but results may vary.

“Hey doll, how goes the ol’ sit-stand-kneel house?” Sweet Lou said, pouring us all mugs of coffee.

“Coming along. Should be ready to go in time for the festival.”

“Thank the big guy,” she said. “So important that the church is up and running by then.”

“It’s a bookstore now,” Mom said. “Ludicrous, I know.”

“Still have the stained glass?” she asked.

“Yep,” Jason said.

“And the spire? The bell?”

I looked down at my watch and pointed outside. As the minute hand spun, the tolling started. “I couldn’t shut the bell off if I tried.”

“Then I still say it’s a church. To be square with you, I’m glad someone is taking care of it again. I don’t wanna tell tales outta school, but Father was a little lax with the upkeep.”

“You don’t say?” Jason said with a knowing smile.

“That St. Asbeel statue had so much debris on its face, I had someone ask me if it was supposed to be Karl Malden.”

“Why did the church go up for sale? I assume people in this town still need to have a place of worship?” Mom asked.

Sweet Lou shrugged. “I heard it was church business, doll. The big religious muckity mucks did some reconfigurin’ and thought St. Mark’s in Silver Pond was big enough for two flocks.”

“Big church muckity mucks?” I said. “How high up are we talking? Mighty thin air near the top.”

“Not the big guy or his son, but maybe his pal with the hat,” Lou said with a smirk. “Just what I heard. I ain’t been to church since I started sinning. You guys know what you want?”

We ordered, and Lou dashed off to get it started. Mom took a sip of the coffee and marveled at how it tasted. She even gave it a little “Mmm” like the commercials.

“Lil, I meant to tell you, I had a strange dream last night.”

“Was it a hamburger eating you?”

“No, dear, nothing as ironic as all that. I was standing outside your church, and I saw a man standing on the roof. He was glowing white and speaking, but I couldn’t understand what he was saying. Then he just disappeared. Isn’t that odd?”

“If he’s a licensed and bonded roofer and he’s affordable, he’s hired. One less thing I have to do,” Jason said, sipping his coffee.

“What do you think it means?”

“I don’t have the foggiest idea. Sometimes, dreams are just dreams.”

“The lesser-known Freud analysis,” I said, doing a horrid German accent. “Dreams are just funny puzzles with no meaning.”

“Well, Doctor, what do you think it means?”

I took a sip of my coffee and gave it a once-over. “Maybe it means God is watching over the bookstore?”

“You mean church, darling.”

“I do, mother, yes. Or maybe Doctor Manhattan shed the blue and paid us a visit in this timeline and the next and the next.”

Mom waved me off. “I don’t have any clue what you’re talking about half the time.”

Jason leaned in between us and nodded at the back corner of the diner. “You noticed that guy watching us the entire time we’ve been in here?”

“Maybe he’s taken by our beauty.”

“I keep catching him looking over. He mumbled something to the table next to him, and they started looking over. He’s not the first guy I’ve seen, either. The whole town seems to be interested in us.”

“I mean, you two are the newest members in a town that seems to be closely knit. They’re probably sizing you all up. Seeing how well you’ll fit in.”

“I thought clique drama all stopped in high school.”

“Lil, high school dynamics never change. There are always in-groups and out-groups. Right now, you’re riding the line.”

“Maybe if we go to the pep rally and they see our school spirit, they’ll accept us as one of them,” I joked.

“Laugh, but a good impression at that festival would go a long way in earning their trust. Small towns are small for a reason - they want it that way. Outsiders bring in outsider ideas.”

“You make us sound like plague rats or Kevin Bacon in Footloose.”

“You the folks that bought the church, right?” said the gossip-monger Jason had spotted. Without us noticing, he’d crept to our table and loomed over us.

The shock of the stranger’s voice caught me, and I nearly choked on my coffee. Jason, who’d been vigilant, took the lead. “We are, yes. Jason, Lilian, and Joan. You are?”

“Chip Hogshead, Hogshead Lumber,” he said, extending his hand. “Been in town since the founding.”

“You don’t look a day over thirty,” I said, finding my composure.

“How you folks finding Sky’s End?”

“Lovely,” I said. “So welcoming.”

“We are, but that’s a secret. Don’t go blabbing to all the city folk and bring them here. Changes the town, ya know?”

“Present company excluded,” Jason said.

“Remains to be seen,” he said, eying us. “You seem like good people, though.”

“They are,” Mom said. “And everyone we’ve met here has been the same.”

“Glad to hear. Hope to see you all at the bonfire. I donated the lumber. Warped dead stock, but it’ll burn. At a certain temperature, everything does, right?” He laughed, and we gave him polite smatterings in return, but the concern between the three of us was visible to anyone with a clue. “Have a good one. Can’t wait to see the church!”

“Bookstore,” I quietly offered.

“Order up,” Sweet Lou said, placing our food down in front of us. We ate most of the meal in silence.

Mom said she wanted to go see the town library and left us for the day. It was fine with me. Jason and I needed to get back to the grindstone at the church. I imagined Darcy somewhere sensing we were behind on our projects and having a mini-embolism. Hell hath no fury like a festival planner scorned.

Jason had taken to building out some of the shelving units, and I was organizing books by genre when I got the feeling that I was being watched again. At first, I assumed it was Mookie waiting for me to glance in his direction so I could feed him, but he was sleeping on a pile of Stephen King books. I turned behind me, toward the front door, and didn’t see anyone standing there.

I shook it off and kept at my task, but the feeling wouldn’t go away. After another excruciating minute of that feeling gnawing at me, I made my way over to Jason and got his read on things. He was knee-deep in attaching panel C to board F when I came over.

“I hate that these adult LEGOs have become the go-to standard for furniture.”

“Diabolical Swedes,” I said. “Hey, do you feel like someone is watching you?”

“I just assumed you were.”

“I glance, but that’s not what I’m talking about. The last two days, I’ve felt like someone has been in here watching me while I work.”

“Darcy has eyes everywhere?”

“I’m sure she does, but that’s not what I’m talking about.”

“I know,” he said, putting down the plank of wood. “I’ve had that feeling too. The way the people at the diner were staring and talking has really stuck with me.”

“Did we make the right call buying this place?”

“I think so. I think your mom was right. We’re the new guy on the job. It takes a bit for the new guy to find their place. We can’t force it.”

I plopped down next to him, picked up an Allen wrench, and twirled it in my fingers. “I just want this awkward stage to be over.”

Jason spoke, but the sound of a stack of books crashing to the ground near the back door shut us up. He glanced, and me and pointed for us to move closer to the source of the noise. He floated across the floor, careful not to make a sound, and I felt my heartbeat tick up.

I crouched and slowly slunk to where he was standing. From our vantage point, we could see that our back door was open. There was a strong wind, and several of the books had flipped open, and the pages turned as if a meth-addled ghost was speed reading.

I saw Jason’s shoulders relax. He turned back to me and whispered, “I think the wind blew the door open. I should replace that latch.”

In the shadowy area about ten feet in front of us, we heard the skittering of sharp nails on the wood floor. Jason ran over and caught sight of something small and furry dashing off deeper into the stacks. “It’s a raccoon!”

“What?” I said. Behind me, I heard the soft TAP TAP TAP of nails on the floor. I turned back and saw several other raccoons scattering away from us. I don’t know what came over me, but I started chasing after them. They moved quickly, but their little paws failed to find purchase on the ground. The last one blew a tire and slid into the bookshelf. As it rolled onto its back and I got a look at its face, I screamed.

There was a person’s face staring back at me.

Raccoon’s body. Human face. All terror.

“The hell?!” I screamed and fell back onto my ass and kicked away from it as hard as I could. My yell was so loud I was afraid I’d shatter the stained glass.

The raccoon flopped back onto its feet and sprinted like a bat out of hell through the maze of bookshelves and out of sight. Jason came running over, helped me off the ground, and tried to make sense of my rambling.

“Lil, Lil, you’re not making any sense. The raccoons were eating a human face?”

“It had a human face!

Jason laughed. I don’t think he was making fun of me. I just don’t think his brain could process that sentence in any logical way. The idea of it was so absurd, and yet, I’d seen it. Once his titters died down, he asked, “Are you sure it didn’t have a mask on? Might have got tangled up with some Halloween decorations before it came in.”

“It had a face. It…it looked familiar.”

“Lil, did you hit your head when you fell or….”

“Jason, I’m serious. I know what I saw.”

The church’s front door burst open. It was Jeff from Jeff’s Market. He looked disheveled. His wet, sweaty hair slicked back behind his ears. His dirty, puddle-brown eyes were manic, and he moved with the grace of someone with two left feet. He stumbled into the store, looked me dead in the eye, and said, “Did you know you had about six raccoons run out of here?”

“Why I screamed, Jeff,” I said, trying to compose myself. It didn’t work. My whole body was still trembling.

“That’s the midnight brood,” he said, glancing to and fro to make sure we were the only ones who heard. “Not sure why they were out already. Not like them at all.”

“What?”

“Those things are everywhere. I’d started tracking them at night.”

“Darcy said you were feeding them,” Jason said.

“That’s what I told her,” he said, closing the door behind him and walking toward us. “But it’s not true. I started noticing their strange behavior when I bought the store about a year ago. They moved in a pack from building to building every night.”

“Looking for food?” Jason asked.

“I’ve never seen them eat. I even left out a cake for them to try. They left it alone.”

“What are they doing?”

“I don’t know, but it’s not natural. I’ve brought it up with the town officials, but they said I’m crazy. Said rural raccoons act differently than the ones I’d seen in the cities growing up.”

“Have you ever…seen one with…umm…a human face?”

Jeff paused and then shook his head. “Never. Why?”

“She was reading one of the new horror books we have in. She’s just joking,” Jason said, coming to my rescue. “You’re new here, too?”

“I was the newest before you,” he said. “Was going to buy this building, actually, and turn it into an event space - JC Hall - then the store came up for sale after Mr. Greggio died. A small-town grocer seemed like less of a headache than an event space. I switched up.”

“Have you noticed the townspeople…?”

“Watching you? Yeah. They do for a while. I think people were mad I didn’t go forward with the event space. Sweet Lou said it wasn’t right that I backed out of the church sale at the last minute. Said it ruined last year’s Harvest Festival. Refused to serve me for three months!”

I had another question or two, but then the door opened again, and Darcy came walking in. She was as put together as I’d ever seen her. Dressed as sharp as a knife blade, with makeup and hair to match. “Howdy! Coming by for the daily drop-in. Looks worse in here than before. The church will be ready, correct?”

Jason stepped up. “Yes, we’re organizing books before shelving them. The mess is required but temporary.”

“You look all glammed up,” I said, checking to see if she was hiding a raccoon tail. My mind was still shaky, but I didn’t want to give up the ghost to Darcy.

Darcy laughed. “I like to get gussied up for the festival. Told Claire at the salon to ‘be bold’! I think it worked! I feel younger!” She noticed Jeff standing there, and her face shifted to disappointment. “Are you the reason the raccoons were just seen running amok in the town square?”

“Not this time,” he said. “But I should get back to the store. It was nice chatting with you two. The place looks great. JC Hall great.”

As soon as he was out of earshot, Darcy sighed. “The nerve to bring up JC Hall in my presence. Nearly ruined the Festival.”

Mookie, freshly awakened from his nap, was curling around my legs. I picked him up and was about to smother him with pets when he locked eyes with Darcy. He howled, shot out his nails, and clawed away from me. He went behind a pile of books, but his attention was solely on Darcy.

“Jesus, Mook! Gotta cut those nails!”

“He’s shy,” Jason said.

“I’m nice,” Darcy said, waggling her fingers at Mookie. “We can be friends.”

He let out a guttural yowl and sprinted for the basement stairs. A second later, he was gone. The silence in the room was deafening.

“Don’t take offense. He hated me for six months at first.” Jason said, adding, “He’s a mama’s boy.”

“Who wouldn’t love such a lovely young woman?” Darcy said. “If you want a refresh before D-Day, tell Franny at ‘Citizen Snips’ I recommended her.”

Darcy turned to leave but stopped in her tracks. The floor under us had started to vibrate. Not an earthquake, but like someone had put speakers under our feet and blasted a ‘90s bass track CD. It rattled books off the shelves. When it stopped, Darcy looked over at us and smiled.

“That was….”

All the windows in the building shot open at once. I let out another scream and shook my head. “There’s something wrong with this place. Something very wrong.”

“Dear, didn’t Rose the realtor tell you about the ghosts?”

“What?” Jason said, dumbstruck.

“Oh, Rose,” Darcy said, shaking her head. “She’s getting on in years. Probably should retire.”

“Darcy, I don’t give a shit about Rose’s future career,” I snapped. “What the hell are you talking about? Ghosts?”

“Yes, well, I don’t want to tell tales out of school, but the whole town knows about the spooks of St. Asbeel. Kinda a local legend. They’re mostly harmless, but seem to get agitated before the Festival.”

“I’m gonna throw up,” I said, finding a chair and taking a seat.

“Sorry to be the bearer of bad news. If it helps, I can call the priest over in Silver Pond to see if he can do anything. Maybe a blessing after the festival?”

“Even before,” Jason said. “That’d be great.”

“I will call him this afternoon,” she said. Darcy glanced at me. I looked green around the gills, and her face puckered into a sympathetic pout. “I’ll leave you be. Feel better, okay? Big day tomorrow!”

As soon as the door closed, I found the garbage can and unloaded my Sweet Lou breakfast. Jason rushed over and held back my hair as I went in for round two. Once I’d purged everything, I looked up, my eyes watery and my face flushed. “Should we sell this place?”

“What? Lil, we’d lose everything. All of our money is invested in this place. I quit my job to dedicate myself to this dream.”

“I know, I know,” I said, spitting out the last remnants of breakfast into the can. “But this is starting to feel wrong. Maybe God is giving us signs to leave?

The church bells began chiming.

“Very subtle, God,” I muttered.

The front door opened, and Mom blew in like the wind. She had a bag slung over her shoulder, stuffed with library books. She glanced around at all the open windows and shook her head. “Are you fumigating?” She stopped when she saw me, sweaty and clutching a garbage can. “Lil, have you been sick?”

“Must’ve been something I ate.”

“It was those pancakes. I didn’t like the look of them. Anyway, I went to the charming little library down the street and started looking up anything I could find on the church’s history. I’d never heard of St. Asbeel. Anthony, Christopher, Michael, Francis  — I’ve heard of them. But Asbeel? Nope. So I grabbed this book,” she said, hauling out a book the size of a Buick. “A Complete Guide to Saints, Angels, and Demons. It seemed very thorough.”

“Does it double as a weapon against demons?” I jokingly asked.

Mom ignored me. “I also wanted to know a bit more about this town. Everyone here seems so intent on keeping up traditions and all that, I assumed there would be a robust selection of historical books to read…but there wasn’t!”

“Where did the rest of those books come from then?” Jason asked, nodding at her full bag.

“Silver Pond’s public library. I asked about Sky’s End, and they told me all about the town and this little church of yours.”

“Bookstore.”

“Turns out, the church higher-ups, whoever they are, did not close this church. They had no idea what I was talking about. Same with the Harvest Festival. They’d never heard of it. Isn’t that odd?”

I shared a glance with Jason, who nodded. “Maybe it’s a close-knit Sky’s End tradition. You heard the lumber guy talk about bringing in city folks.”

“Funny you should bring him up,” she said, pulling out a dusty old tome. “I asked if there was a book about the town’s history, and they gave me this one about all the local towns in the area and their founding. The section on Sky’s End is very thin, but there was a drawing of some of the town’s first inhabitants. Tell me, does this man look familiar?”

She held up a book and pointed to an ancient sketch on yellowed paper. At first, I couldn’t place it, but then it clicked. “That’s the lumber guy,” I said, my jaw open. “Chip Hammers.”

“Hogshead,” Jason said. “Hammers?”

“Cut me some slack. I just yakked,” I said. “But yes, there is a strong family resemblance.”

“I have a theory, but it’s a bit out there,” Mom said. “I don’t think…”

Mom’s theory never saw the light of day. Just outside the church, we heard the screeching of tires followed by a sickening thud and women screaming. We rushed outside and saw a small group of people huddled around a person in the middle of the street.

It was Jeff.

1py6mxi,https://www.reddit.com/r/FictionWriting/comments/1py6mxi/a_mighty_fortress_and_a_very_fat_baby/,A Mighty Fortress and a Very Fat Baby,"Big John was over 11 pounds when he was born. That’s why they called him Big John. He was being baptized late by Lotharite standards, but there were circumstances involved. Well, one circumstance, that being his mother was unable to walk for several months after his birth. But now here he was, being carried to the baptismal font at the First Lotharite Church of New Winnweiler (Heidelberg Confession). Dressed in a custom baptismal gown, you see, as Big John was nearly seventeen pounds… they call him Big John for a reason.

Big John was held by his parents, both lifelong Lotharites. The pastor dressed in a robe and stole poured water over the crown of Big John’s head three times, baptizing him in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. There was no applause, the baby’s head was patted dry and he was about to be carried away so that the service could proceed with scripture reading.

But then it happened.

No one quite understood what was going on as a booming voice rang out “Una forte Rocca e il nostro Dio!” Big John sang in perfect pitch, in the voice of a tenor, in precise Italian. The congregation looked around for speakers, for someone with a microphone. As Big John continued the hymn, the ears of the congregants led their eyes to the baby at the baptismal, who was in fact belting out the Lotharite anthem. There were gasps, shouts of praise which were more common among other types of Protestants, and the grinding of teeth. Well, there was just one person grinding her teeth. But who could be bothered by this sudden outpouring of miraculous talent?

Lauren Stromberg. That’s who.

Lauren Stromberg was a joy to be around. Tall, physically imposing, severe; she directed the choir of the First Lotharite Church of New Winnweiler (Heidelberg Confession) like a drill sergeant. Big John’s voice was simply amazing, but Lauren immediately identified several problems: there were no hymns during a baptism, spontaneity was simply out of the question, and that sounds like… Italian? Too exotic for a Lotharite (Heidelberg Confession) service.

“Il regno suo rimane per l’eternita” Big John held the ending note to the hymn in a bold display of lung capacity. The stunned crowd, some standing, some having fainted, were held in a breathless pause for a brief moment after Big John had concluded the one-song performance. But then they erupted in ecstatic applause. Well, not quite everyone. Actually, everyone except one person.

Lauren Stromberg.

The pastor announced an unscheduled intermission to the service so that everyone could regain their composure. What a buzz the crowd, mostly older folks, were in!

“He must be the reincarnation of Pavarotti!” Lauren heard one woman say.

“What a beautiful language! Why don’t we sing in Italian more often?” Said another. Lauren’s eye twitched when her brain registered that one.

“The miracle of tongues!” Suggested someone else. Oh boy, someone was in need of a reminder of Maxmillian Lothar’s teachings on the acts of the Apostles, and how they had ceased in the first century. It’s in the Heidelberg Confession.

A hurried service resumed after a few minutes, the pastor referring to the impromptu song from a 58-day old child as a “miracle” definitely ground Lauren’s gears. She was stoic as she directed the choir through a well-rehearsed closing hymn. A watchful eye on Big John, who had fallen asleep in his car seat, half-expecting another disturbance during the approved, English-language hymn. Despite the chaotic energy delivered by Big John, the hymn went as planned.

As you may imagine, everyone wanted to see Big John after the service. To quiz his parents, who were as in awe of the event as anyone else, to see him, to touch his little, well… it’s a relative term, hand. Lauren Stromberg intercepted the pastor as he was on his way to see if he could score an audience with Big John.

“Pastor Ludendorfer.” She halted him. “I think it’s appropriate for you to issue a correction to the congregation.

The pastor was accustomed to being stopped by a congregant while he was walking, but this bold interception irked him. He composed himself, masking his frustration as best he could. He wanted to gawk at Big John with everyone else, not pacify Lauren Stromberg in whatever nitpicky complaint she had.

“Thanks for bringing it to my attention. A correction about what though?”

“People are saying that the interrupting, I mean singing, baby, is the reincarnation of some opera singer. Maxmillian Lothar taught quite clearly that reincarnation was incompatible with reformed faith. The Heidelberg Confession clearly outlines”

Pastor Ludendorfer raised his hand and nodded in acknowledgment.

“Yes, I understand. That teaching is very clear. I think sometimes when people are excited they speak without thinking. Whoever said that probably meant that Big John sounded like an opera singer. He does though! Wasn’t that amazing? I have never heard anything like that! He sang like an angel!”

Lauren glared at him, making several mental notes.

“It wasn’t one person; it was several people. I think it requires correction.” She insisted, physically barring Pastor Ludendorfer from passing. She only permitted him to access Big John, who he had to chase (which was easy, Big John didn’t even crawl yet, but his stroller did move quickly), after he had acquiesced to her stern demand masked as a suggestion.

The usual crowd was on time for church the following Sunday. This was not unusual as they were mostly retirees (they were Lotharites after all, I think the average age of the congregation was late sixties). Most were still unhappy with the recent change to a 9 am service, they preferred the original 7:30 start time. Some grumbled that the young Pastor Ludendorfer was being influenced by Pentecostals with the late service. Anyway, the point here is that they were extra motivated to be on time to see if Big John would return this Sunday with his parents. He did. Everyone was so excited to see Big John being strolled in, well almost everyone. Actually only one person wasn’t excited to see Big John.

Lauren Stromberg was not excited to see Big John.

She rolled her eyes so hard that a weaker woman would have hurt her neck. But Lauren was a powerlifter, her squat game was a little weak though. She snapped the choir to attention and began directing them in the opening hymn at exactly 9 o’clock. They had finished the first verse, but the crowd was looking to the back pew, eyes fixed on Big John.

This was going too well, Lauren knew it was too early to relax. As the second verse began, the choir was overpowered by a familiar voice, louder than the choir with all their powers combined.

“Santo, santo, santo! Tutti i santi t’adorano,

deponendo le corone davanti al trono tuo”

Big John sang as beautifully, and as Italian as he had the week before.

The crowd gasped, the choir stopped, Big John continued.

Lauren snapped.

She rapped her conductor’s baton on the music stand and commanded them to begin on the chorus. A few complied, the others stood marveling at Big John’s holy serenade. The organ continued playing, well, organ sounds continued. The congregation did not have an organist, not since Mrs. Gewurztraminer had moved to an assisted living facility last year. The musical accompaniment to the hymn was played from a popular video sharing application.

There was applause when the song ended. There was never applause after a hymn, well, unless Big John just sang it, in Italian.

Boy was this a great introduction to Pastor Ludendorfer’s ten-minute sermon.

“What a wonderful gift we’ve been given, to hear this little one praise the name of our Lord with his beautiful voice. But in our joy, we must be careful to speak the truth. We’re called to remember the clear teachings of scripture, clarified by Maxmillian Lothar, and codified in the Heidelberg Confession. A soul exists in Earth once before judgement. The idea that the soul of anyone who has passed into eternity could come back into a different body is well outside our understanding of the afterlife as outlined in the Heidelberg Confession… and scripture.”

The time for the closing hymn approached. Lauren held out her hand, stopping the choir from approaching. The congregation was confused, there was nothing in the Heidelberg Confession about this.

“There is no need to follow centuries of order and tradition, the little newcomer will just sing for us.”

A cascading gasp spread through the crowd in reaction. Some looked at Lauren in disbelief, others looked back at Big John in anticipation of his next lovely song. Pastor Ludendorfer, with a still-active lapel microphone (and boy was he aware of that since the “burp incident” of 2023), interrupted.

“Choir, could we please have you come to the chancel for the closing hymn?”

They reluctantly resumed their progress. Lauren glared at Ludendorfer furiously. He meekly avoided her intense glare and felt genuine fear.

The organ was a bit delayed in starting, but after it began (well, after someone hit the play button on their phone app) the choir was immediately overpowered by little baby Pavarotti in the back of the church.

“Incoroniamo di corone,
L’Agnel sul Suo splendor!”

The congregation sighed with relief, the choir provided an English backing to the hymn, Lauren stormed out.

No one really noticed her leaving, though she marched down the center aisle and out the main door.

After the congregation was dismissed, they gathered around and fawned over Big John much as before. Pastor Ludendorfer patiently waited for an audience with the silent infant, though his joy was stolen by the looming threat of Lauren Stromberg, with whom he knew an unavoidable encounter loomed.

Michael Wolfgang Ludendorfer snuck out of the church with the main body of departees, highly irregular. He normally listened to the elderly, who were his primary audience, tell him about their prescription medication after a Sunday morning service; but today, he was fleeing from his choir director.

Her car was still in the parking lot! In a mild panic, he hurried to his own car and fled the parking lot while the church was still half full, or half empty, depending on your perspective.

Lauren was already down the road, only a few hundred yards away at the historic Saint Jakob Railroad Park. It consisted of two benches, a tree, and a decommissioned railroad bridge that spanned 38 feet across the Alsenbach Creek. For over seventy years it was used to supply the mill which had polluted the creek, which tragically caught on fire in 1966. The creek caught on fire, not the mill.

Become a member
Anyway, the cruel November wind blew wisps of Lauren’s hair from her orderly braid as she looked through the dead shrubbery of the embankment down at the barely moving water of the famed creek. She stood in solemn, silent contemplation at the foot of the bridge. Her life’s work had been overshadowed by a spectacle… in Italian no less.

Lost in thought, her situational awareness was also lost.

“You okay there Miss?”

She gasped, spinning around startled to see a sharply dressed gentleman standing a respectful distance away.

Lauren didn’t recognize the man, which was odd for New Winnweiler. Even if she didn’t know someone, she typically at least recognized them. Perhaps he was a visitor and had just come from church. Maybe he saw her leave and followed. That made sense to Lauren.

She took a deep breathe to compose herself. Her cheeks and nose were red from the cold, but she hadn’t shown any indication that she had been crying, because she hadn’t been.

“Yes. I’m fine.”

“It’s not a very high bridge, you know.”

Lauren’s face betrayed her internal reaction, even if her words were measured.

“It was high enough to get corn to the mill for over 70 years.”

The stranger sucked in his lips and nodded, looking past her at the bridge.

“Sure was, but it’s not for corn anymore. I don’t think it’s high enough for much else though.”

“What are you implying?!” Lauren sharply responded, alarmed at the inference.

The man held his palms up toward her as if to deescalate.

“Just thought I’d check and see if you were alright. It’s not too common to see a lady in her Sunday best on a bridge staring at the creek.”

Lauren knew that the stranger knew, her eyes downcast as she deliberated whether or not to tell this seemingly kind person her troubles.

“It’s that singing baby, isn’t it?” He asked.

“I was hoping it was my imagination. But that fat baby really does interrupt the service, doesn’t he?” Lauren blurted, seeking validation. He must have seen her leave the service, she told herself.

“I can help you with the baby.” The stranger said, taking a step forward.

Lauren’s head tilted, warily eying the man and instinctively putting her hand on the pepper spray bottle in her pocket. Lauren pepper-sprayed someone at least once a month.

“I can elevate your choir. I can silence the baby. I can even help you to out-sing that baby. In Italian, heck, even Latin if you”

Lauren’s eye twitched at the suggestion she sing in Italian, and Latin was the final straw.

“We must avoid and shun all idolatry, sorcery, superstitious rites, and invoke the one true God only!”

She quoted the Heidelberg Confession. And that serpent of old, Satan, the Devil, was overcome.

Well, either that or the blast of pepper spray that Lauren delivered to his eyeballs from inches away. He held his jacket over his eyes as he fled blindly into traffic to be hit by a freelance delivery driver. Lauren was in hot pursuit but veered away as the stranger lay mangled in the street and jogged lightly to her car in the church parking lot.

I am going to out-sing that fat baby. Lauren thought to herself, dabbing her forehead with a napkin as she sat in her car. She grabbed a fresh bottle of pepper spray from the glove box and replaced the used can in her pocket.

Pastor Ludendorfer’s heart skipped a beat the next morning when he arrived at the First Lotharite Church of New Winnweiler (Heidelberg Confession) and saw Lauren Stromberg’s car in the parking lot.

He spoke the words of Maxmillian Lothar aloud, but quietly as he exited his vehicle and walked, slowly, to the church.

“Dear God,

Protect me from sin, error, and unsolicited theological corrections.

Grant me the swiftness outlined in the Heidelberg Confession Article 17, Note B,

where it says to flee evil swiftly,

Guard my tongue,

strengthen my spine,

and conceal me if possible.

Amen.”

An angelic voice greeted him from the sanctuary as he entered. Lauren Stromberg was in front of the chancel, where she was accustomed to directing the choir from, singing beautifully. Maybe not quite as beautifully as Big John, but quite nicely at least.

Pastor Ludendorfer chose wisely to not interrupt Lauren’s solitary practice and went about his normal Monday morning business.

Lauren trained like a Navy SEAL… of singing, all week. Each day her voice grew shakier, more hoarse. But she refused to coddle her vocal cords. She would defeat Big John fair and square, or she would die trying.

She barely slept Saturday night, and rather than fighting vainly against consciousness, she rose early and prepared herself for battle.

“Rrrrrroll your Rrrrrrs for the Lorrrrrrd!” She woke her tired vocal cords, compressing her sore diaphragm with her fists. She was as ready as she ever would be.

The first at church, she analyzed the acoustics from her position against those of where the fat baby sat with his parents. Too bad Lotharites don’t believe in church nurseries, she thought, this could have all been avoided. But Lauren was never one to back down from a fight, not even a fight with a fat baby.

It was 8:58 am when Big John’s parents strolled into church. So much for the virtue of punctuality extolled in the Heidelberg Confession. Lauren had already been there for hours, to the prepared goes the glory, that’s what Maxmillian Lothar had said.

The organ music announcing the opening verse Be Still My Soul. All eyes turned to Big John, who was sitting smugly, according to Lauren, in the back pew with his parents and their contraband coffee.

Lauren unveiled her secret weapon. No, not pepper spray, although she had considered it. A microphone, which she held to her mouth and sang into, competing with but not overpowering Big John as he began singing.

“Sii calma, o cuor,

confida nel Signor”

Many, but not all, eyes turned to Lauren, who had never before used a microphone while directing the choir. Lauren’s voice cracked, then it squeaked. She threw the microphone down with a horrible amplified crashing noise as Big John continued the hymn. She ran, undignified, unlike the week before, through the crowded church, pepper spraying Michael Wolfgang Ludendorfer in the eyes with alarming precision as she ran from the church straight to the historic Saint Jakob Railroad Park. Steam escaping her mouth in the cold morning air, still over Alsenbach Creek, as she gazed down to the water which seemed to call to her.

The Sun broke through the dark clouds, and she felt like it was shining just on her as a warm gust blew up the embankment from under the bridge.

A mess.

A sound.

A bad decision.

But some people leave nothing at all.

My brother disappeared three months ago. He didn’t run away. He didn’t die. He was just… gone. His phone was on the table. His wallet was still in his jacket. The coffee he made that morning was still warm when I got there.

The police told me what they always tell families like mine. Stress. Adults leave sometimes. No signs of a crime.

What they couldn’t explain was the feeling.

The apartment felt wrong.

Not empty.

Thin.

Like the world there didn’t fully exist anymore.

⸻

I started looking into other disappearances. Not officially. Just patterns. Places.

It turns out a lot of people vanish in the same kinds of locations.

An old bridge no one uses anymore.

Underpasses people hurry through without stopping.

Buildings everyone avoids but can’t explain why.

I went to one of them late at night. The bridge.

I didn’t see anything at first. I only felt like I wasn’t alone.

“You’re looking in the right places,” a voice said behind me.

It didn’t sound angry. Or threatening.

It sounded tired.

I turned around.

I can’t describe what I saw. Every time I try, my mind just… skips. Like it refuses to finish the image. But I knew it was watching me.

“Did you take them?” I asked.

“No,” it said immediately. “We don’t take. We hold.”

I said my brother’s name.

It paused.

“He asked questions too.”

⸻

I didn’t run. I don’t know why.

I asked it what it was.

It told me this world isn’t as solid as we think. That reality doesn’t stay intact on its own. It needs pressure. Attention. Feeling.

Places people pass through without thinking about them start to weaken.

“When nothing presses against existence,” it said, “existence bends.”

I asked what happens then.

It didn’t answer right away.

Instead, it explained itself.

⸻

“There are others like me,” it said. “Some feed on joy. You never notice them. Some feed on calm. You call those places peaceful.”

I already knew what it was going to say next.

“And you?” I asked.

The air around me felt heavier.

“I feed on pain,” it said. “And fear.”

I told it that made it evil.

It didn’t deny it.

“You feel emotions without effort,” it said. “They come naturally to you. We have nothing unless we take them.”

I asked why people suffered for years. Why the fear never stopped.

“Because brief fear sustains us,” it said. “But long fear stabilizes the damage.”

⸻

That’s when I understood.

People don’t disappear because they’re killed.

They disappear because sometimes fear isn’t enough.

“When a place is close to collapsing,” it said, “a human consciousness can anchor it. Spread out. Integrated.”

I asked where my brother was.

It pointed into the darkness beneath the bridge.

“Still holding,” it said. “Still afraid.”

⸻

I felt it before it touched me.

The ground stopped pushing back against my feet. Sounds flattened. My own breathing felt distant, like I was listening to someone else.

“You know too much now,” it said calmly. “Understanding is also an emotion.”

I tried to move. I couldn’t feel my legs.

“You won’t disappear,” it added. “Not like them. You’ll remain useful.”

⸻

I woke up in my apartment the next morning.

No injuries. No marks. No proof that anything had happened.

Except this.

Some places feel different now.

Heavier.

Thicker.

And sometimes, when I stand somewhere too long, I feel a pressure. Not on my body.

Through me.

venlafexine

okay so  
about 4 years ago, i woke up and suddenly everything was different. physically, i seemed fine, but it felt like suddenly i was walking around with a fish bowl over my head.

my vision was very off, blurrier than normal even with my glasses on. that day, i went into work, and i couldnt perform simple tasks; i couldnt plug any stoppers into coffee lids since i just couldn't seem to line it up.  
this totally sent me into extreme anxiety and i ended up getting my parents to pick me up. i asked my dad if i could go to the ER, but hes a chiropractor and he said that they would just send me into the looney bin (father of the year).

so i went to my general doctor and she sent me off to get a bunch of tests. i got my eyes checked, dilatated, scanned, etc. nothing wrong with my eyes

i got my ears checked, even had a hearing test, and nothing was off with that either.

so then i went to a neurologist and he ran a couple tests, and still nothing seemed off. my balance was good and my speech wasnt slurring.

they sent me off to get a ct scan with contrast and from that they saw nothing either.  
i was basically told, well it looks like it isnt killing you now, so you should be fine.

siince then, my insurance has been really weird. ive gone from doctor to doctor with reallly no help. they put me on venlafexine to help with the anxiety everything was causing, saying that maybe it was ptsd.

lately, when im drawing, i sometimes lose focus of a line and i get double vision. and i sometimes get odd muscle spasms.  
i stopped drinking and smoking when i first started being like this, and sobriety didn't change anything.  
the brain fog is the worse part. i can get tasks done, i work as a barista and a commission artist now, but i have lots of fatigue and i dont like moving around a bunch. its like theres a weight above my eyebrows that just makes me feel so out of it and dumb. its like im manning a robot rather than feeling like im manning my own body.  
also when i take a deep breath, it doesnt feel entirely relaxing. and sometimes i get this heightened anxiety that makes breathing feel really weird like it isnt oxygenating me?

i dont have any chronic pain. i get headaches but not anymore frequently than most folks.

any leads towards what i should be aiming research towards would be greatly appreciated. i will also be making a doctors appointment (likely with a new doctor bc my insurance is ass), but whenever i explain this stuff to a doctor, half of them treat me like im crazy.

i am also on brain fog supplements, and several other supplements

  
edit:

also i got a series of blood tests with nothing out of the ordinary",1,1766966045.0,DiagnoseMe,0,1.0,False

1py6ix4,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1py6ix4/my_path_had_no_light/,My path had no light.,"It was around 2.34 when I woke up that day. It was late December, I lived in Finland (Still do) so it was dark outside and that darkness wouldn’t be lifted until around 9.00. I was fully aware of this. When I woke up I felt no hesitation to get up. There was no amount of time spent processing that I had woken up. I brewed a pot of coffee, downed 2 cups and took my medications. I put on clothes, a thick leather jacked and my karvalakki. With nothing but clothing suited for the cold Finnish winter, I left my house and traveled into the dark forest.

Even though I did not have a flashlight, nor was there any sources of light, natural or man-made, I was somehow able to navigate through the forest. I have gotten to know these forests quite well, as I thoroughly enjoy walking in forests just for the sake of walking. But there was no possibility I could have traveled these forests in the dark. I mean all I saw was solid black. I do not remember how I successfully walked through the forest without tripping over once or accidentally brushing a branch I was not expecting, but I do remember that it was very easy. I had to pay no conscious attention to my surroundings, all I had to do was walk where I wanted to walk. This still puzzles me to great extent and I still lose sleep over it. I can’t believe that there is no explanation for this, there just must be something that can explain this regardless of how impossible it seems. 

I walked for what I now imagine to be a couple of hours before arriving to the place I planned to reach. I still don’t know where I actually walked to. Based on what I do remember about the location, I don’t even think it exists in the forest. There was a distinct, constant low hum emanating from the ground. I could feel it vibrate my calves. The air was the crispest and most pleasant air I had ever breathed. I felt overwhelming euphoria materializing into my chest and rushing to my extremities from there with every breath I took. Then I heard the snow crunch in front of me. I wasn’t surprised, I took it as a sign that things are going as planned, whatever that meant. The deer in front of me imitated the sound of a woman giving birth at an unnatural volume before stopping and walking away from me. I crouched down and took the object I was given. I then walked back to home. I felt a wave of heat go down from my shoulders to my legs when the darkness I had been accustomed to was hindered by the street lamps on the opposite side of the road from my house. I immediately looked for the object I was given but I couldn’t find anything, yet I still knew it was with me. It’s still with me as I am writing this, and I still don’t know what I was given.",1,1766965969.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

1py6fy4,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1py6fy4/i_work_at_the_consignment_shop_on_main_street_1/,I work at the consignment shop on Main Street. (1),"**Monday, July 8th, 6:31pm**

The internet loves weird stories and strange little town experiences, and I have both in spades. My name is Lola, and I work at the consignment shop on Main Street. Don’t look at me that way, you know what I’m taking about. That little store that sells weird art, soap made by a bored housewife, maybe some essential oils from the local pushy peddler that swears it’ll cure your autism and a pile of things that are vaguely antique that always seems to be next to a fro-yo store or a virgin mobile? See, I knew you would get it. 

I moved to this tiny ass town a few years ago from Chicago and I’ve come to enjoy it, though it feels almost like a Stockholm syndrome type of thing. One night I packed up as much as I could in my beater of a camry, buckled my pet carrier in the passenger seat and drove away from the city I grew up in. I drove until my universal joint gave the ghost and ended up here with a busted car, a pissed off cat and $37.24 to my name. 

Through sheer dumb luck, the owner of this fine establishment was looking for some short term help and had a studio apartment above the store in need of a fuzzy creature to eat the spiders so Demeter and I took the jobs. Short term help became long term when Mr. Shriner, the owner; had a stroke and couldn’t take care of things anymore. He’s alright now all things considered, beyond a wheelchair and a Sylvester Stallone snarl on the left side. We see him around town sometimes, and he always sends his nephew with fresh catnip for Demeter when he comes to collect the bank bag. 

“Lola, why are you telling me all this for a Reddit post? Tell me about the weird shit in your store.” It’s called building the world, let me have my fun. 

Anyway, back to my store. We have regulars that come in, both buyers and sellers. Consigners? People who provide the weird shit we sell. I’ll introduce you to a few. 

There’s Karen, who sells essential oils (I’m not kidding, her name is Karen, she looks exactly how you think, down to the chunky blond streaked hair) and she comes in every Monday to drop off her latest batch from headquarters. She could be worse, but she gets pissy pretty quick if I cut off her pitch about thieves oil for my condition. 

Then there’s Rooter, he makes stuff out of reclaimed wood and steel he finds. His day job is construction, and he owns the company he works for so no one notices when all the lovely walnut boards disappear from time to time. He does solid work actually, I have one of his carvings in my window upstairs. 

My personal favorite, Mrs. Robichaux. She’s pushing close to eighty, a widow five times over, no kids, and a thick Cajun accent to die for. She migrated up here about sixty years ago from Baton Rouge, bringing her “magic plants” with her. She makes things with herbs from her garden. Salves, ointments, tea mixes, talismans, a really good spice blend for cheeseballs, all the good things from the garden of an ornery old woman.    

The shop is closed for the day, so I can take my time to tell you about this weird thing I found today while I wait for my takeout to get here. Shout out to Tony’s and their stromboli, best in town. (Only ones in town but not my point)

So today is a Monday right? Monday is my busy day. I’m closed on Sundays, so we have to pay out our sellers, collect new stock and tally up all the countable things like inventory and money on Monday to “roll over the week” as Mr. Shriner says. I do inventory throughout the day when I have a little free time on my hands since the storage room is a straight shot from the front door, I can hear the bell ring when it opens. 

Demeter was watching the counter for me, stretched out across the formica top and cleaning her beans as she usually does when it’s her turn. I was shelving Karen’s oils for the week, dusting this huuuuge cabinet shelf thing as I worked when I brushed against a wiggly piece of trim. 

Before I continue, I gotta explain the store a little more. The Shriner family have lived in this town since it was just a trading post and an inn like 200 years ago. They of course, ran the trading post. As the town grew, the trading post became a general store, then that general store because bigger and started selling furniture and fabric and all those luxuries of the time. Then that general store became a department store, then they tried to build a mall outside of town but when the mill blew up and all those people died the population dropped pretty drastically so they stopped construction. Now it’s one of those places teenagers go to urban explore. Anyway, they were a huge part of this town and owned a few businesses that were divided among the descendants. Mr. Shriner was blessed with the family antique shop that he turned into our quaint little consignment shop. All the display furniture, and everything in my apartment are heirloom pieces he couldn’t sell when he switched the business. Ok, remember that. Back to Karen and her cure all oil.

So I tap this loose piece of trim on the cabinet right? “Great job, Lo. You’ve managed to bust the shelf that’s older than your grandmother.” I mumble as I look at the damage. When I run my finger over it, I feel a tiny metal hinge in the bottom that’s almost… rusty I guess? It’s gritty anyway. With a quick glance at the imaginary camera in front of me, a la The Office, I pop the trim open and underneath it is a rectangular button hidden in the wood. In for a penny, in for a pound right? 

If you dear reader, were provided with a mystery button in an antique cabinet would you not push it? Does it sell destruct? Would it spit out a million dollars in old currency that is now considerably higher in value because they’re from a country that no longer exists? A human skull? It was none of those but I admire your enthusiasm. This is Reddit, not a Nancy Drew novel. 

So I push the little button, something clicks and I hear the creak of old hinges. It’s not obvious to me at first, but due to my condition I can’t exactly bend over to see what opened. I scoot my stool back for a better view, and peek at a door in the bottom panel that has “magically” appeared. I nudge it open with my foot and hold my breath for the most exciting part of my morning.

Inside is a smattering of curled up insect bodies, a thick layer of dust and a foot tall form wrapped in velvet. Despite the feeling of velvet making me want to pull the teeth out of my head, I pick up our mystery package. It’s heavy, and whatever is inside feels like it’s radiating cold air through the thick fabric. I nudge the door shut with my foot, and walk back to the counter with this dense thing tucked in one arm like a baby. 

Gently pushing Demeter across the counter, I set the… thing in her place. She merps in distaste at being moved and hops down, moving to her bed in the window. Obviously someone isn’t excited about our discovery. 

I peel the velvet away with hesitance to reveal a statue of a woman. The statue itself is carved from a smooth, white stone that’s not quite marble. The woman is wearing a flowy nightgown that would touch her ankles if it wasn’t torn up the side.  Her hair is hanging down in loose ringlets, and her tiny little face is carved in an unhinged scream of terror. To her credit, it’s deserved. This poor stone woman has been impaled on a stone tree stump, bent over backwards as if she fell onto it from a great height. The weirdest part to me, beyond the subject matter anyway, was how familiar she looked but I can’t quite pin who she looks like.

Truthfully the whole thing was beautifully sculpted by my untrained eye. Once I’m upstairs, I’ll call Mr. Shriner and see what he wants done with it but there’s Tony himself with my Stromboli. 

**Tuesday, July 9th, 6:41 am**

Hello Dear internet, I have returned. So I called Mr. Shriner, and he first informed me that it was common at one point for furniture makers to put secret cabinets in their work to hide valuables. Who knew? He also told me that the sculpture was probably from the previous owners and he didn’t have any attachment to it so I could sell it if I didn’t want it. Oddly enough, he didn’t want to look it over or have it appraised or anything, just told me to stick a tag on it for $150 and put it in the window to sell so that’s what we’ll do.

My stromboli was great btw, thanks for asking. 

I’m currently sitting in my apartment, drinking my coffee before I head downstairs. There’s a wicked storm outside, and I can hear the wind whipping around so today is going to be pretty slow. I kind of appreciate that though, I didn’t sleep great last night. I had nightmares about that statue, more specifically the woman herself. 

I am not new to nightmares, I’ve had them most my adult life. After I got sick, I gradually started having nightmares. It started once a week or so, then a few times a week, then nightly. Despite medication changes, therapist visits and at one point hypnosis, I still woke up screaming every night. That’s why I got Demeter actually, she’s kind of like an emotional support animal without the training. She’s a snuggler, and she’s pretty deaf so screams don’t bother her one bit when I wake up. She thinks she’s getting aggressively snuggled and I get to feel something real to remind me where I am. 

Anyway, back to the nightmare. So I’m in this big, empty building and I’m running down a hall. You know, the general “something big is chasing me” nightmare, but this time the hall ends at this little glass partition thingy protecting the edge of the floor. It keeps getting closer, and I can’t seem to slow down. I jerk to the side, hoping that if I turn I can keep running down a hall or something. Instead, I guess I overcorrected and spin myself around entirely so I’m looking down the hall I just came from, with my back pressed against the glass. I’m still running, but I’m being pressed back against the glass and i can hear it start to strain from the force I’m putting on it. I know I’m going to go through this glass and there’s nothing I can do to stop it so I look back over my shoulder to see what will inevitably cause my demise. One story down, despite being in a huge building, a rotted tree stump waits below to ram itself through me, just like that damn carving. When the glass finally shatters, I fall backwards onto the stump and wake at the exact moment I felt it pierce through my spine. 

It’s always loads of fun waking in a pool of sweat with the phantom feeling of pain right?  Once I came back to reality, I checked my alarm clock, debating if it was worth it to sleep or not. It wasn’t, so I decided to take that extra thirty minutes before I was supposed to wake to take a nice hot shower and actually make breakfast and here we are. 

Mr. Shriner’s nephew Ian will be here today to pick up the bank bag and I think I’m due for a visit from Rooter. He’s been making little puzzles out of old nails and they’ve been selling pretty well so he should be coming to collect. Demeter is very excited for her delivery and is currently yelling at me to go downstairs. I must obey my fuzzy overlord. 

**Tuesday, July 9th, 3:00 pm**

It’s hot as hell despite the raging storm outside  and this damn desk fan does nothing but blow its stupid little streamers at me. It’s mocking me, I’m sure of it. Anyway, Ian stopped in and asked how things were. I told him about the sculpture and he said, and I quote; “huh… anyway… bank bag?” I thought it deserved more fan fare than that but whatever. Demeter is happy. She’s rolling around the floor with her eyes as big as saucers. She always enjoys her stoned Tuesday afternoons. 

Rooter also came in today. He collected his check and dropped off another box of puzzles and a few more carvings. Exciting news for our little shop, he’s getting into woodburning! You heard it here first folks. He seemed excited about his new endeavor but he wasn’t entirely right. He said his daughter Sara has been sneaking out at night and he has no clue what to do about it. She doesn’t care about being grounded, and taking her car didn’t seem to stop her. 

“She turns eighteen next month, so what’s stopping her from just up and leaving in the middle of the night as soon as she’s old enough to?” He asks, his voice a little tight.

“She’s not going to leave in the middle of the night, she’s just being a rebellious teenager. She’ll settle down soon enough.” I tell him as I fill out his check. “Does she still hang out with those dinks with the camcorders?” 

Those dinks with the camcorders are the Brewer twins, Caleb and Kyle. They want to be directors or something and run around town with camcorders basically glued to their hands. To their credit, they have a couple cool short films on YouTube. I don’t understand how they upload the tapes though. Beyond my technological knowledge I guess. 

Rooter nods as he pockets the check and reaches down to pet Demeter. “She was in their last YouTube thing. The one that was filmed at the mill you know? I’m worried that validation is getting to her and she’s going to do something stupid. Anyway…” He turns and walks towards the door until that damn statue catches his eye. “Hey, Lola… what’s…” he nods his head to it, though his eyes never seem to leave it. 

“Not a clue… found it in a super secret cubbyhole and the ol’ man told me to sell it. Interested?” I lean on the counter to grab packing material, knowing a sale when I see one. Rooter’s eyes never leave the stone woman as he delicately sets her on the counter and pulls out his wallet. I ring him up and wrap up his new girl, sending him on his merry way. 

**Friday, July 12th, 10:30 am**

We closed the shop early today. Sara Rooter is missing and I’m going to help the search party. Here’s what I know.

Sara came home from school at 3 pm, showered, went to her room and didn’t come down for dinner. Rooter said they had argued that morning about the dinks and their newest film project and she was prone to hunger strikes when they argued.

He takes up her dinner none the less at around 10 pm and she’s gone. Her window is open, the storm screen was sitting in her closet, her safety ladder was unrolled and hanging out the window. All standard so far but here’s where it gets weird ok? 

Her phone was still on the charger. What teenager goes anywhere without their phone glued to their hand? So Rooter picks it up to see if maybe there’s an inkling of where she went and the thing is bricked. The screen just shows snow static. I didn’t know smartphones could even do that. Not only that, but her shoes and bag were left behind too. 

The police have organized search parties, one goes to the woods surrounding town, one goes to the junkyard outside of town, and one goes to the old mill.  

Now riddle me this Batman, maybe I don’t know enough about police procedures but if these are the most common places for a kid to run off to in this town, wouldn’t the police have looked it over already themselves instead of calling in the locals? I get we have a very small police force but this feels almost incompetent. Whatever. Maybe I watch too much tv. 

Before I forget, to my knowledge right now, no one has talked to The Dinks.

In other matters, I had that same nightmare last night. Usually they don’t repeat but this time I seen something as I fell backwards. I think whatever was chasing me was a ghost of some sort. It was a cloud of dense smoke, leaving a trail of ash behind as it lumbers after me. Maybe the mall has a spooky smoke ghost haunting it? Can you imagine that, the unopened mall being haunted by the ghost of a builder’s cigarette or something. 

**Saturday, July 13th 12:00 pm**

The shop is open today, and surprisingly busy so I’m going to post this update real quick while I choke down my lunch. You guessed it, it’s takeout from Tony’s.

We haven’t found Sara yet. 

Rooter is a mess as you’d expect. He lost his wife about a year ago to the big C, so the fear of losing Sara too is gutting him.

 I stopped by last night when the search party was over, and he looked rough. He was in need of a shower, a nap, and probably hadn’t brushed the fur off his teeth since she disappeared. The weirdest part about the visit was his inability to take his eyes off that statue he bought. He was just as captivated it as the day he took it from the shop. It looked off though, I can’t quite place how. 

I thought it was all white stone but the limbs seemed to be a very pale flesh color. Maybe the lighting in the shop made it look white. We have those super fluorescent eyesore lights that wash everything out. 

**Sunday, July 14th 9:13 am**

Still no sign of Sara. Rooter is still a mess. Demeter is acting weird but she’s a cat so that might just be her being a cat you know? She keeps staring at that cabinet the damned statue was in as if it’s gonna reach out to bite her. 

I will admit I’ve been neglecting my shop and apartment so today is a deep clean day for everything. I have the shop mostly clean but I’ve gotta stock shelves. Karen had decided to up her stock because somehow, cinnamon bark oil is going to help us in this time of crisis. I can almost see where she’s coming from. There’s been a lot of volunteers in town since Sara disappeared, and they have been wandering in when they take their breaks but I really doubt they’re going to buy your mlm bullshit Karen. We all know you’re in debt up to your eyeballs for this company. 

Once I finish cleaning, I plan on visiting Rooter again this evening. Maybe I’ll take him some food.

I had that dream once again last night. Everything was the same set up but this time the smoke had arms. Not tendrils of smoke or anything, full on, beefy biceped arms in the color of the smoke, reaching out for me. Or maybe to push me through the glass? Who knows. 

**Sunday, July 14th 10:08 pm**

I just got back from Rooter’s. I stopped at the deli and grab some sandwiches before I went over but he wasn’t exactly interested. He let me in without a word and wandered back to his chair in the living room to stare at that statue again. I swear to god it’s changed. I swear it was white stone when I found it. But now that woman is definitely a pale blonde. Everything else is still smooth white stone. She wasn’t a blonde right? 

Rooter looked at the sandwich and set it on his coffee table, then his eyes drifted back to the statue. I didn’t stay long, I figured he was probably sick of people dropping in, and I can’t drive well at night anyway. 

**Tuesday, July 16th 6:54 pm**

They finally located The Dinks. They had been out of state for a family funeral but they did say they heard from Sara that day. They said she was going to check out a location for their next film but they wouldn’t say much else. 

Mrs. Robichaux stopped by earlier today for a restock. She brought a little extra too, gave me a tin of her herbal tea blend. 

“That child is as good as cold…” she says as she takes a puff of her cigarette. Usually, I don’t let anyone smoke in the store but who am I to tell this eighty year old with five mysteriously dead husbands what to do? “Poor baby’s with her momma now.” 

“That’s a little presumptuous, isn’t it Mrs. Robichaux? She’s only been missing a few days.” I look up from my notepad, feeling a frown creep across my face. 

“She’s not missing baby. She’s dead. I’ve seen it.” She taps her temple with a crooked finger and ashes her cigarette into her open purse. This woman is an absolute loon. Not because of the grim statements, but the purse thing. I’ll never get over that. I guess it’s better than on my floor though. As I open my mouth to respond, Demeter arches up and hisses, bapping that old cabinet with as much force a three legged cat can muster before running for the store room. “She knows too… cats are always the connected ones.” 

**Wednesday, July 17th 2:14 am**

I had that nightmare again. The smoke with the arms is definitely pushing me off the ledge. When I woke up, I caught the faintest whiff of sulfur and old plant matter. You know that sickly sour, earthy smell when you find a potato you forgot in your pantry? That. I smelled that. Maybe Demeter was playing in the cupboard. She likes to steal onions, so what stops her from snagging a potato and hiding it, you know?

**Wednesday, July 17th 7:12 am** 

They found Sara Rooter’s body. 

I wish I had a better report for you. But they found her body this morning. Someone reported a light on at the mall around midnight. 

Remember how I told you the Shriner family had built one but never opened it? I’m pretty sure they were almost ready to open it, with stores and all but within a few weeks of the big day, the gas line at the mill blew and threw a wrench in that whole process. 

Anyway, the police get a call around midnight that there’s a light on at the mall and they promptly went up the hill to check it out. When they arrived, they found the poor kid’s body.

The mall was built with glass partitions on each of the three floors to protect shoppers from falling into the plant filled atrium. In the center of the grand entrance, is a big garden bed thing, that has somehow kept itself alive all these years. I remember seeing a story about a terrarium that was sealed up in the 70s and hasn’t been opened since. Maybe it works like that. 

Sara’s body was found impaled through the back on the remnants of a tree stump in the center of the atrium, surrounded by glass from the floor above. 

The police are still there, investigating the scene but bad gas travels fast in a small town so I’m sure someone will come in tomorrow afternoon with everything anyone will know, whether it’s real or pure rumor. 

**Friday, July 19th, 10:34 pm**

I went to see Rooter after work today. He opened the door for me as soon as he seen me pull into the driveway and actually spoke this time but he sounded so… hollow I guess? I don’t blame him. He just lost his daughter in a horrid accident and his wife to cancer within years of each other. 

“You can ask, you know.” He mutters as he lowers himself into his chair, his arms shaking under his weight. 

“Rooter… I’m not here to-“ I trailed off when I noticed that goddamn statue in the corner. What I swear to god was once a white stone sculpture, is now painted in thin layers of colored lacquer. Her skin is still pale, and she’s still blonde but now there’s a rosiness to her cheeks that I know was never there before. 

“Ain’t she beautiful? She looks just like my Sara…” He follows my gaze, then looks back to me. Poor man… he looks like he’s aged ten years. He hasn’t shaved since she disappeared, and I think he’s lost weight. “They found her just like that you know? They said she was leaning on the… the partition up there… and fell from the second floor… but I don’t think she fell at all. That glass was shattered. Do you know how thick that glass was? A little thing like her wouldn’t have shattered it running at it as fast as her legs could carry here. I put the damn things in for God’s sake… didn’t know that did you?” 

I shake my head, though I’m not surprised. There’s not a lot of construction companies around here and the Shriners like to help the locals when they can. 

“Yeah… my first commercial job back in ‘00… I didn’t want to put the bid in but Alan Shriner basically begged me to… Anyway…  They let me see her before they took her away.” His eyes cloud over a little, drifting back to seeing her that last time. “She looked so scared, and she was so cold. They had her covered, but they moved it for me… she looked perfect beyond the… the…” His hand drifts over his chest. I nod so he’ll continue but push myself to my feet to find him something to eat. 

“When they brought the gurney in to take her away, they made me leave but I snuck back in. I went in through a fire entrance on the side and I watched them… M-move her from the second floor… The spot she fell from. I needed to see if the glass had maybe fallen from its bolts or something but they were still solid… she went through the glass.” I return with a couple pieces of toast and set them in front of him, then sit back down. 

“I’m so sorry Rooter…” I can’t seem to say anything else. 

“And this…” His voice wavers for a second before he scrunches his face up. He collects himself quickly and clears his throat, setting his hands in his lap. “I think someone pushed her… and I think they were hiding around in the mill before they did it… there was ash everywhere up there. Like someone cut a hole in a bag of it and drug the bag around to make a trail.” 

“You think someone…” I trail off, the idea taking the air from my lungs. Sara was just a kid. Sure, she got in trouble with The Dinks while she was filming, but nothing dangerous. Just normal teenage stuff. Why would someone kill her for that? 

Rooter nods as tears begin to roll down his scruffy cheeks. “Someone murdered my girl. I just know it.”  

I left shortly after that. He started to drink, and didn’t seem to want the company anymore. 

Demeter waited for me at the door as I got upstairs, and I think she knew something wasn’t right. She’s been up my tail, or more specifically across my shoulders the entire time I’ve been home. She makes an excellent scarf when she wants to be I guess. I’m going to shower and go to bed. Today has been painfully long and exhaustingly sad. ",1,1766965763.0,TheCrypticCompendium,0,1.0,False
1py6fx7,https://www.reddit.com/r/VELVETTECULT/comments/1py6fx7/the_vees_hypothetical_spinoff_season_eps_14/,The Vees - Hypothetical Spin-off Season (Eps 1-4),"Viv has made mention of the idea of a Vees spin-off. Obviously I'm sure her ideas are better than mine, but I nevertheless decided to write up a plan for an 8-episode season. And I'm probably only putting the first four episodes in this post for length reasons. 

The general theme is that the Vees bring out both the best and worst in each-other: They can work together to make each-other succeed, but they also encourage the worst instincts. Set maybe a year or two after Season 2, Vox has integrated into the tower itself to effectively become its AI. 

Sharing this with y'all first because while it's about them all, Velvette is probably the lead. She is, after all, the backbone of the Vees. 

Episode 1: Trust Me

Song 1: ""Lights, Camera, Action!"" - Standard Broadway style opening, similar to what ""Happy Day In Hell"" and ""Hazbin Guarantee/Trust Us"" was. Talks about how great and successful they are, establishes what each one brings to the table.

The song transitions into Angel Dust on the phone complaining that Val is making him do foot fetish stuff which he hates because ""I don't even have feet! I have these ugly pincer things, I'm a fucking spider!"" 

Val, while he's getting ready, makes a comment about how Angel used to be so much more cooperative, and Angel sarcastically says 'Wonder when that changed'. Val looks confused. 

Flashback to the late 2000s/Early 2010s. Valentino's studio is doing okay, but not at its high point. He soared to success in the '70s by being one of the first studios in hell to actually integrate plots into his stuff (think Debbie Does Dallas style), as well as his having a good visual instinct. He's also regularly appearing in his own films. Now, it's not doing as well - Other studios are doing stuff faster than he can. 

Enter Velvette, who proposes the idea of selling her love potions. She knows Val's saliva is an aphrodisiac and makes people more suggestable. She thinks she can refine it. 

To advertise this, they set up a reality TV style psuedo-documentary based on a month or so of work at his studio. Angel is known not to like doing foot stuff because of the spider thing, even though some people still want it. Val has, up to now, not insisted. That's not to say he's 'respectful' or anything, just that he's not doing things he thinks will make his stars not want to work with him, because he believes allowing a few red lines is worth them being more invested in the performance. 

Val asks Angel to do foot stuff, he won't, Val then doses him with the aphrodisiac. 

Song 2: ""Pure Magic"": Sung by Angel and presented as if he's talking about himself, but with the audience knowledge, he's actually speaking as the potions (Lines about how you'll do anything he wants, you can't resist him, because he's pure magic) intercut with shots of Angel and others in the studio downing the potions. 

Song ends in the modern day with Angel throwing an an empty bottle of the potion at Val, and getting on with the shoot. 

Episode 2: ""Trust Us"" 

(Throughout this, each of the Vees tells another to trust them, thus the motif)

Valentino is on the phone with a distributor in the Envy ring. They tell him that his brand is pretty much toxic right now. He gets angry and throws the phone at the window. Window manifests Vox’s face saying “Ow, I'm right here you know!” (Showing us he's the Tower, effectively). Vox tells him that it'll be fine, they're the Vees after all. 

This leads to a flashback, where we see Vel and Val hanging out at a coffee shop or something. Vel mentions that the waitress (Melissa) is hot. Val tells her to ask her out, Vel points out they're in public and if she gets rejected in public, it will tank her brand. Val offers to ask her out on Velvette’s behalf. Velvette asks how she knows he won't just ask Melissa out himself, Val tells her to “Trust Me.”

Vox gets thrown through the window, revealing this is during his fight with Alastor. Vox asks them to help him. This being how they met, Val isn't sure. Vox promises to distribute his movies, and that he can make Val’s studio the only game in town. They help out but it doesn't look like they'll win but Vel has an idea and says to “Trust Me.” If he tells people to text or email her, she can use that to repel Alastor. He does, she uses her phone to channel the messages into razor-sharp envelopes, and Al is forced to retreat. 

Song 1: “Unstoppable” - Vox explains his business plan to the other Vees, assuring them that together they'll be unstoppable. 

The song ends in the present again and they clearly feel stopped. Val explains that he can't put his stars on the lower rings, which means hellborn like Glitz and Glam are usurping him because they can make real appearances. Velvette enters, talking to Verosika on the phone - She won't be able to attend the biggest social event in hell, Bee’s annual Sinsmas party, for the third year in a row because she can’t leave the ring. She also throws the phone at the window. 

Vox reminds her he's right there, she says she knows, she did that because she's pissed at him. She tells him that she'd previously been able to get an exemption because Lucifer signed off on applications without really considering, but for SOME reason, he doesn't like them 

Song 2: “Unstoppable (Reprise)” - Valentino and Velvette complain that they feel they’ve hit an arbitrary glass ceiling by being the biggest names on Pride but unable to expand (I.e. they WOULD be unstoppable if they could go downring). Song ends with Vox saying he doesn't know what they're talking about, he's doing fine. Shark Assistant Guy (I shall call him Paperclip for now) shows him their off-ring sales numbers and he is naturally upset (Because Vox feeling silly is always good for a laugh) 

They bicker a bit, not too seriously, but clearly do blame Vox for why they can't get exceptions. 
Vox: “Come on, I only kidnapped him to power a weapon the one time!” 
Vel+Val: ....
Vox: “Okay now that I say that out loud, you have a point.”

Episode 3: “Just Us”

Rocky and Melissa are talking about her feeling like Velvette doesn't care. She likes her work, sure, but she feels like she doesn't have a girlfriend anymore, just a boss she can't avoid after work because they live together. Rocky gets called back by Val, and he's clearly exhausted. Angel calls over as well, saying he wants to get the shoot done. Rocky leaves. 

Song 1: “Melissa's Lament” - Melissa sings about how she feels alone and ignored by Velvette, even though she loves her and she thinks Velvette is overworking then both (Velvette and Melissa). Song ends with Vel calling Melissa over to help with a photoshoot. 

Scene transitions to 2018/2019 era, with the Vees at the height of their power. We see Melissa starting to have the same concerns then, and telling Vel she worries Velvette is spending too much time on work and isn't making time for her as a partner rather than an employee. Velvette admits she's right but says that she's the wardrobe department for Val and Vox, Melissa tells her to go bring that up to them. 

Velvette goes to Val and tells him the three of them need to have a meeting tonight. Val acknowledges, and he's talking to Rocky and Tiffany Titfucker. Rocky tells him that basically the whole studio is exhausted, because they're being expected to work at the pace of their most high-energy star, and that's Angel and he is pretty much insatiable. Val says he's not feeling the exhaustion, but Tiffany reminds him that that's probably because he doesn't appear onscreen anymore, he's always busy with the production. He only fucks anyone between takes or after they wrap for the day. He claims that's because with how lifeless they seem, he needs a whole day of shooting to get in the mood anyway. Tiff points out that if he only does it after a day of shooting, how would he even know what they'd be like if they weren't exhausted? 

He acknowledges the point, and says he'll let them pull back, but he has to talk to Vox and Vel, because that'll effect her reality show and his broadcast schedule. 

Velvette and Val go to talk to Vox. Vox is already talking to Paperclip. He tells them he'll be with them in a minute, and steps out to talk to Paperclip. Vox asks why there's been another production delay, Paperclip tells him that Vox keeps promising ridiculous advances and projects in unrealistic timeframes. Vox says it wasn't a problem before, Paperclip explains to him that when he says ‘Before,’ the last time he was actively involved in production was about 20 years ago now. Things are more complicated. 

Vox admits he may not fully know about modern tech and how much it can and can't do, but he just hasn't had time to catch up. Much as he loves the tech, he promised Valentino and Velvette new UHD cameras for the reality show so there's no time for him to get dug in like he wants.  Paperclip tells him he'll try to get them ready but suggests Vox ask if they can delay the season. Vox agrees to. 

They then have the meeting, each of them planning on deciding to slow things down. However, whenever one brings up an issue, the others come up with ways to ignore it. Val’s workers feel tired? Velvette will make the aphrodisiac more potent. Melissa is lonely? Vox will hypnotize her into not minding. Vox’s people can’t do the work fast enough? Val will send his down to help when they're not actively shooting by using the love potion to make them want to impress him. 

Song 2: “Pyramid Scheme” - Having talked each-other into ignoring the issues, the Vees sing about how the three of them and their combined project is all that matters. 

Ends with Rocky, Melissa, Tiffany, and Paperclip watching the three of them laughing, they're disappointed. 

Episode 4: “Consequential Drift” 

Episode opens with Charlie nervously looking jewelry at a fashion boutique. Velvette asks her what she's doing here. Charlie is surprised and asks if she’s shopping here too. Velvette points at the signage around the store making it very clear that she owns it. 

Charlie realizes that was a very silly question. Vel asks what she wants (Throughout this, Vel is being moderately aggressive/suspicious in a ‘Why would she even be here’ way). Charlie explains that she wants to propose to Vaggi. Velvette tells her she's in the wrong section, and shows her engagement rings. 

Song 1: “Perfect Night” - Velvette offers to help Charlie not only with the proposal, but to organize the whole wedding pro-bono as an apology for their conflicts. This is about 70% her wanting to get back in the Morningstar family's good graces, 20% her wanting to be at at least one big social event this year, and 10% her just liking arranging big events. 

Charlie is thrilled by this. She tries to figure out a way to repay them. Vox turns things down, in a large part because not doing it for free would make the whole PR aspect useless. Ultimately, Charlie settles on getting Valentino permission to do a publicity tour on the lower rings. 

Song 2: “Down There” (formally stylized with up crossed out and ‘Down’ inserted) Follows the same tune as “Up There” from Hazbin Season 2, but this time they're fantasizing about expanding their business to lower rings. 

Val, Rocky, Angel, and Tiffany get ready for the publicity tour. Velvette and Melissa move into a suite at the hotel to help plan the wedding, leaving Vox at the Tower.

So anyways the whole rest of that I didn’t feel good I was super on edge I barley ate anything I was just very scared but I felt fine for the most part just very anxious so I go to sleep that night and I woke up at 3 am with a stabbing headache behind my left eye and it went away after 30 mins or so and it scared the shit out of me to the point of me sitting on the toilet for a hour with pure diarrhea. I woke up on Christmas Eve and I felt horrible I felt very nervous the whole day I felt like my nervous system was wrecked I barley ate this day at all and I noticed that my head had a lotttt of pressure in it like it didn’t hurt or anything but my nose bridge area and forehead felt like it was gonna pop no dizziness or pain just a very weird sensation and yet again I goggled my symptoms and made myself thing I have a brain tumor which was the biggest mistake yet it made me freak out and made everything way worse I basically felt like my life was over.



So for the past couple days my head pressure has been meh it got better the less I’ve been stressing it goes away completely when I’m busy and it comes back when I am thinking about it I’m not super stressed about it because my mom has horrible anxiety and takes many meds for it so she said it’s normal because it was my first panic attack and my body is like in fight or flight mode any loud noise I hear my body jumps into fight mode I’ve also been very very tense my shoulders and neck are very tense which I don’t think is helping the tension.

I’ve summed it up basically to tension from anxiety but I was wondering if anyone else had any type of problem like this it’s just weird to me because before this I’ve never had anxiety until one weird moment and now it feels like this feeling in my head is never going to pass 😕


I could be wrong but I feel like it’s not anytbing serious due to stupid stuff like being busy or background noise in my house making it go away for the most part  ",1,1766965522.0,Anxiety,3,1.0,False

A buddy of mine said some good things about Reddit, so I figured I’d give it a shot! I've been traveling across the country (working remotely) and have been having a blast. It’s definitely had its high and lows, and I've met a bunch of different folks along the way -- but finding those lasting connections is obviously a little tough with this lifestyle. Hence why I'm here on Reddit. I put the location tag as US, since I'm not really restricted on location.

Here's a bit about me:

* I'm 40, male, and work in the medical field.
* I’ve been traveling full-time since last summer. I started on the east coast (NE), made my way through the Ozarks, and now I’m slowly meandering west.
* I love cooking, especially when I can do it outside. My go-to is a cast-iron skillet breakfast hash with whatever’s on hand -- potatoes, eggs, peppers. Hot sauce is a must, let's be real, haha.
* I'm a big reader. Right now it’s a mix of Steinbeck, some travel essays, and a book on neuroscience I like to pretend I understand.
* I used to be a runner, but now I’m more of a ""slow hiker who stops for photos and snacks"" if you get what I mean.
* I grew up near the ocean. I'm not afraid to laugh at myself, like the time I accidentally locked my keys (and shoes) inside the van at a rest stop in the middle of nowhere. Hey, at least it made for a fun story, right?

Throwaway account for obvious reasons. 

I am a final year at a top RG (think LSE/UCL/Warwick/Bristol) studying Economics. I completed an IB summer in my penultimate year and received a return offer. IB didn't quite click, but I guess it was fine. 

Something just didn't feel right about the industry - mainly the amount of modelling work. To be fair, I haven't met a person that likes it. But everyone seemed to just get on with the job. It wasn't a coverage/industry issue as I did two rotations at the bank - both were equally modelling heavy.

After exploring my options, I came across corporate law and liked the idea of it. This cycle I completed a winter vac scheme at a US firm (think Gibson/Cleary/W&C/Dechert) and received a TC. I liked the job but wasn't quite given ""real"" work unlike the IB summer. 

I guess it was mostly fine and people at the firm were really nice. I did enjoy the work. However, a lot of it were coffees and 5 PM finishes so I'm not sure how realistic the experience was. 

Adding to the equation, there is also a PE firm opportunity (MM/UMM) and the possibility to complete an MBA in Continental Europe. I can also try to pivot to other areas of finance/law/buyside or try consulting if I do the MBA.

What do I do? I know I am really fortunate to be in this place. However, a lot of it was genuinely luck. I am absolutely clueless about how to decide and what metrics/criteria to use. 

Is it a wise idea to pick the most prestigious option at this point? ",0,1766965350.0,uklaw,1,0.4,False

A buddy of mine said some good things about Reddit, so I figured I’d give it a shot! I've been traveling across the country (working remotely) and have been having a blast. It’s definitely had its high and lows, and I've met a bunch of different folks along the way -- but finding those lasting connections is obviously a little tough with this lifestyle.

* I’ve been traveling full-time since last summer. I started on the east coast (NE), made my way through the Ozarks, and now I’m slowly meandering west.
* I love cooking, especially when I can do it outside. My go-to is a cast-iron skillet breakfast hash with whatever’s on hand -- potatoes, eggs, peppers. Hot sauce is a must, let's be real, haha.
* I'm a big reader. Right now it’s a mix of Steinbeck, some travel essays, and a book on neuroscience I like to pretend I understand.
* I used to be a runner, but now I’m more of a ""slow hiker who stops for photos and snacks"" if you get what I mean.
* I grew up near the ocean. I'm not afraid to laugh at myself, like the time I accidentally locked my keys (and shoes) inside the van at a rest stop in the middle of nowhere. Hey, at least it made for a fun story, right?

The problem is the coffee liqueur.  The go-to choice in the sub seems to be Mr. Black.  In the book the esteemed Mr Cate specifies Bittermens.  Sadly, neither are available here. 

So - questions:

What’s Mr Black like?  Is it just easy to get, or is it that good that it’s the de facto choice?

Bittermens … this is new to me. Regional?  Hard to get?

Finally, where would you turn as an acceptable substitute?  The choices here are limited to the dreaded Tia Maria and Kaluha, along with an interesting-looking offering from  Tromba (it’s tequila-based, however, and I wonder if that gets into the “too busy” realm).  That’s it.  Three selections unless mode from afar. 

EDIT:  It MIGHT be possible to get either “The Barista” or an offering from Giffard, if anyone has experience with either.

Seriously though; a couple days ago I was lost in thought wondering if chasing some grass is greener shit out there really was the answer, when those thoughts were interrupted by KEXP playing [Chicago by Roy Ayers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWUOyLLIufU)*.* I mean...*""Chicago, where can I go, What you gonna do in Chicago? Tryin be me, Tryin be free""*

I'm not a spiritual person but CMON MAN.

Anyway. My lease is up at the end of Feb. My plan is to fly out there over MLK weekend, try and view some apartments, check out neighborhoods and hopefully sign a place to start last week of Feb/1st of March and make the move.

**That leads me to...**

*  **Neighborhoods**: I've checked out the cliche guide but let me get more specific thoughts.
   * **Vibe:** Thinking not too corpo/not too hip. More single Millenials than single Gen-Z if possible. Like people with jobs who like culture and aren't hyper-materialistic.
   * **Walkable but can have a car:** I'll be bringing my car (its AWD don't worry). I prefer somewhere I can go a week without driving but it's also not a bitch to have your car there. I don't *refuse* to pay for parking but I've also never needed to in Seattle, ( I can, parallel park on a 20 grade hill with no cameras, your parking situation doesn't scare me, but I also don't want my shit broken into)
   * **Near Shit To Do But Not IN IT:** I like small music venues (wicker park?) actual parks, running trails, dive bars, coffee shops or third spaces I can work from (I'm remote), generally close to metro stuff.
   * **Probably not a skyrise:** I mean i don't care, but my cat would get so bored with no people to spy on and *HE* prefers easy access to the street for harness walks.
   * **Cost:** ehhh i mean. 1800-1850 is probably my max for now. 1BR/Cat Friendly/Washer in-unit is the hope. I'm finding listings that seem to meet the criteria, more about choosing the right neighborhood with the right listing.

**Other Questions/Tips/Advice/Warnings:**

* **car stuff:** anything i'm not aware of? stuff I'll have to pay for when i get there? just accept my car will rust to a heap sooner than not? 
* **stupid transplant stuff you wish we'd learn:** i dont know just like shit you hate about transplants that you wish they would learn better?
* **Service Opps:** speaking of which - a common gripe about the Amazombies moving to Seattle is that they do nothing to participate in the community or engage in civic duty - other than voting against our wishes. I don't want to do that, good suggestions for service orgs that will connect me with community?
* **Community/Friends:** Yeah I know everyone moving there from Seattle sounds like traumatized war vets complaining about the Seattle freeze and breaking down crying the first time one of you smiles and waves at us but - suggestions for assimilating into the culture, finding community, do/donts, what has worked for you?
   * I'm a dabbler in hobbies and like to do just about everything, so i like to hear what's worked for other people without also sounding desperate if you know what i mean.
* **Other shit/Warnings/Things you wish you had known/done:** I mean i'm not afraid of the cold, im built like a bear and lived in Utah, a little wind chill doesn't scare me. But what should scare me?
* **dating:** will my inability to grow a good mustache be a complete game killer or does my great hair make up for that?

  
Thanks everyone! looking forward to making a 'fuck you Seattle' post on my instagram in 6 months after this turns out to be the best decision i've ever made.

I was on a work trip this weekend. After checking out of the hotel, I went to my car in a parking deck and had to use the stairs due to elevator issues. When I attempted to start the car, I got a failed start test on the first blow. I suspect it may have been residual mouth alcohol (vanilla coffee or cough medicine earlier), but I had no water available.

I did not start the car. I walked back down the stairs into the hotel to get water and ended up walking about three blocks to meet a customer for lunch instead.

The only thing I noticed on the device was a “5-minute retest” prompt. I’m using an Alcolock unit.

When I returned later, the device displayed “Immediate Recall 00.” I later learned this may correspond to a required retest that I didn’t complete at the time. Again, the car was never started.

For background:
I don’t drink anymore and haven’t purchased or consumed alcohol since 2021 (last DUI).
I’m in a 3-year interlock program and was granted early reinstatement from a 4-year suspension.
The only prior issues I’ve had were occasional “failed to test on arrival” notices in the past, and one rolling test many months ago that initially failed but passed immediately on the confirmation blow.

I previously had Monitech, which had unrelated electrical quirks in my BMW. I switched to Alcolock in February and haven’t had issues until now.

Additional context: after lunch around 4 hours later, I drove about 3 hours home. During that drive my start test passed and my very first rolling test failed, so I swapped the mouthpiece out and passed the retest no problem, I had a rolling test that initially failed very first one after starting the car... but passed immediately on the required rolling retest. Alcolock support indicated that resolved rolling retests are typically treated as contamination (e.g., mouthpiece issues).


My question:
In North Carolina, is a failed start test followed by not completing the immediate retest — when the vehicle was never started or driven — considered a license-revocable violation? Or is this more likely an administrative recall, since NC requires interlock providers to report any readings over 0.02 even if there’s no operation?

This has me pretty anxious, so any insight from people familiar with NC interlock enforcement would be appreciated.

1py65iy,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1py65iy,Tom Holland repair complete? (Mini rant about detents),"So i managed to remove the shoulder. It took heating water in the micro in a coffee cup for about two minutes then submerging tom for about a minute to pop the shoulder out. Did it for the broken figure the donor for the good arm. 

Now that the figure cooled down, his legs still have some resistance so I may heat and remove them again and try to further smooth the ball joints. May also try taking out more plastic ahead of and behind the neck joint. 

But for now he is back on two feet. Following images are before and some process images. 

So as you can see Hasbro has used these kind of hexagonal balls with ""detents"". 

They did the same thing for the shoulder joint. These flattened surfaces essentially act as an arbitrary limiter. 

One theory I have seen is this is to prolong the life of the figure. The problem though is if it leads to the figure breaking due to the limiter coupled with gummy plastic? Why do it to begin with? The issue I dont feel is the drop down hips specifically. Rather when you have those limiters; it creates resistance and puts stress on the peg. And the Holland Spidey is somewhat notorious for not only snapped hips, but snapped arms as well. Your shoulder doesnt have a limiter. If your hand is down at your side you can raise your arm 180 degrees with no limitation. 

Fortunately it looks like 2099 has the drop down hips but has more of a golf ball. 

That said, I wouldn't be surprised if Hasbro decides to rerelease this final swing Spidey as they are with Andrew and different colorway.

Here's my review:

First the good - the staff were great. The public spaces were clean and well maintained. The room was clean and main bed was comfortable. Our 7yo daughter loved the kids program, and the staff there were very good.

The rest was, well; enough that I would be hard pressed to try any other NCL offerings.

First off, we did a balcony room with the beverage package, wifi, and 3 specialty dinners. The room was smaller than Princess balcony rooms; but the real issue was the fold out couch-bed was so hard even my 7yo couldn't sleep on it comfortably!

The whole perception once you get on board is a nickel & dime approach to everything. We had the beverage package; but the only coffee option readily available was Starbucks and NOT INCLUDED! That's another upcharge per person per day.

The base wifi is MEASURED IN MINUTES??? WTF is it 1998? Upgrading to ""the fastest internet at sea"" or the streaming video package was a joke. I've been on a larger, fuller Princess ship and streamed shows to my devices without issue. NCL's internet (also provided by Starlink) struggled the entire time. Hard to watch anything, hard to get things to download to watch later.

Water - access to water bottle filling stations COST EXTRA. It was included in our beverage plan, but it's an upcharge if you didn't get the plan. Especially notable to me was the fitness room had a single water fountain with placards not to fill water bottles.

Food - the food was TERRIBLE. I was missing my Crown Grill steaks! Our first specialty dinner was Brazilian style churrassco. The beef was grey and ""sludgy"" and terribly seasoned. It was served either under or over cooked - but regardless of cooking temp it was disgusting. We did a Teppenyaki (Hibachi style) Japanese dinner - I watched them bring out the beef that looked the same and ordered seafood instead. I eat Hibachi style at home in the South USA on a regular basis. I've never had fresh cooked fried rice that was inedible. I was picking around my plate to find something to eat. Our last specialty meal was ""East meets west"" - Asian fusion. The appetizers were actually decent, but the main courses again were terrible. On Princess ships we usually enjoy the buffet at breakfast and lunch. The buffet here was firstly off tiny for the number of passengers on board; but more importantly the food quality was just terrible. Breakfast had good bacon and the omelette stations were nice, but a lot of the other food was low grade cafeteria food. Same for the other meals. Proteins were consistently disgusting. They might have one station with a fresh pig/turkey/lamb etc that was decent but then most of the other food was terrible. I'm also used to Princess having a really nice selection of desserts and pastries. The dessert table at the buffet was filled with picture perfect desserts that tasted like cardboard. We tried the pool side grill and ""Cadillac diner"" as well and the burgers and dogs were the cheapest, grossest style I've seen served in a while.

Excursions felt to us pretty steep compared to Princess in Alaska and the Caribbean. It seemed most options were over $200pp; even for a simple snorkel excursion. We rented a car with Turo at each port and did our own thing.

I’ve spent weeks researching what might be a good replacement, and landed on the Profitec Move and the Libra AP. The main thing I’m looking for is something my wife can use without a ton of manual work, but still have the freedom for me experiment and try new settings and tweaks. It looks like the Move will give her the “wake up and push a button” workflow she’s used to, and with the grind by weight dosing on the Libra it won’t add much to her routine.

We mostly use the same medium roast coffee from a local roaster, and she enjoys milk drinks, while I prefer Americanos.

Since we host a bit, the BBE’s steam was a bit of a problem, which is why I was  thinking about getting a dual boiler instead of the HX machines.

I’m now seeing overflow with the portafilter which I didn’t notice before with previous beans. The double shots are also not coming out anywhere close to a 1:2 ratio.

I found that 18g of this new bag of beans is over filling the basket a bit (as evidenced with the razor tool) so I lowered the dosage below 18g. The espresso tastes good to me though. I’m not getting bitterness or sour that I sometimes got with prior beans before I fully dialed them in. 

The biggest change (besides the beans) since the previous bags is I’ve now got a funnel, WDT tool, and a self-leveling tamper (all from Normcore). The tamper has the default spring with was rated to 25lbs. I think.

**DO NOT FRET CHILDREN**, do not stagger, for as I and other brave believers have brought you salvation to heal your wounds, to cure your fear. (I have gone clinically insane, hello Joyce s1)

Warning: it’s a long read with many under points, please take your time and process(let me cook)

**SIDE NOTES:**

1. English is not my first language; I apologize for any mistakes regarding grammar etc beforehand.

2. I have brainstormed all of this with my friend after watching vol2 (I watched it at the time it came out) and although I have seen many similar theories/presumptions and posts on here, I did not/ have not intended of stealing anything from others and if I do include many points which may seem similar to other posts THIS IS out of coincidence. SO CREDITS GO OUT TO EVERYONE! I am not the only person to think of this for the first time or whatever, but I have used my brainstorm notes, that I have written down before going on social media, solely. I want this to be clear because I view this as important. 

3. MY friend that helped me with this theory and brainstormed with me: [chocolatewithberries](https://www.reddit.com/user/chocolatewithberries/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)  and her post about the theory we made (IMPORTANT HERE): [**will is a unreliable narrator and how his coming out could parallel mike getting vecna'd (theory?)**](https://www.reddit.com/r/byler/comments/1pwn1wb/will_is_an_unreliable_narrator_and_how_his_coming/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

4. **THIS post is focused on Will’s come out** and how the doubt that it has caused for many is understandable, but not necessarily plausible after going through it all once more slowly

5. These are only theories and presumptions, if it’s confusing or doesn’t make sense, pls just throw a rock at me :D

**I need to walk you through Will’s coming out before I can start with the direct evidence for Byler (“Tammy “ etc.)**

* **Will’s come out in steps (how I perceived it from his pov)**

To start this off, how I understand it, there are two reasons/motives of his coming out and a important person (mentioned later)

1. Will starts talking with Joyce in the Radio station with the intention to come out to her after…

\- Vecna trying to invade his mind and showing him a vision

\- He had a talk with Robin about her come out and Steve as ally

\- Max and he talked shortly beforehand about them both feeling useless and his face being in the circle of Dustin’s drawing

**IMPORTANT THEORY: (Theory for this from my friend:** [**possible foreshadowing? - abyss and will**](https://www.reddit.com/r/StrangerThings/s/w7MmcOgO7P) **and another post I found after writing:** [**will's coming out as self eulogy**](https://www.reddit.com/r/byler/s/3JNBjv0YA8)**)**

2. He talks to her about what happened in the upside down before El could rescue him: Vecna tried to get into his head; Will used the tactic of focusing on happy memories with his friends and family. That has worked out for many in the past (himself, El and Max), but this time it didn’t, because Vecna had found a weakness/ a loophole you could say, in these positive memories of his. That loophole is Mike, particularly his feelings/sexuality for him. Although this is also about his family and other friends ( their reaction to his sexuality), it's clear that he is in the main focus.

* **Why Mike and why has Vecna only now used this against him?**

These feelings have gradually built up and especially in season 4 this was thematized with Will discovering himself as gay and officially acknowledging his crush on Mike. In season 5, Robin is his mentor as a queer, older person, who serves as a role model. They talk and bond a lot about her experiences, her relationship and how coming out has helped her get to be together with Vickie. Asides from the signs, Robin has told Will about, that definitely exist and have Will feeling hopeful, I cant help but imagine how he still has very negative emotions (worry, fear, anxiety, hesitance) when it comes to talking about his feelings to anyone else in the party and coming out and what effect that would have not on everyone but especially Mike). These emotions were definitely there in his happy memories, surrounding his moments with Mike and the team as a sort of unresolved background problem lingering there – a loophole and therefore weakness – negative feelings for Vecna to get into his head.

3. Succeeding, Vecna showed Will his fears coming true – an alternative version of the coming out he had in ep7 but gone badly = rejection, disappointment (at least that’s how I understood it when he was talking about it)

**REASONS/MOTIVES – IMPORTANT for understanding my next points**

**1****^(st)** **Reason**: Will knows his fear/worries about his feelings and other’s feelings are a weakness Vecna can use against him AS LONG as he doesn’t face it. Not only does he think about himself (he’s being smart here) but knows it’s going to be impractical for their fight and mission ahead (THE SAFETY OF ALL THE PARTY IS AT STAKE HERE and it matters to him- it’s important) BASICALLY: Will wants everyone to know before Vecna can use any person of the party against him as a form of emotional manipulation ( like Vecna did to Max with Lukas in s4 in the attic) HE now knows their true feelings about him and this can’t be used against him anymore

**2****^(nd)** **Reason**: After Vecna showing him his fears coming true, he wants to know if that is actually true – he wants his friend’s and family’s reassurance and confirmation of their unconditional love for him 

* the person to also motivate/guide him there is **Robin** after telling him about Steve and how this lead to her being brave enough to confess to Vickie (“It’s easier to tell somebody”)

**CONCLUSION SO FAR:** Will has been impacted by these conversations and encounters, but still wants to tell Joyce about his sexuality out of free will – his decision with the 2^(nd) motive

4. However, Mike (lover) comes into the picture/interrupts – reminds Will about the timing / the mission and **the party** altogether (the **1****^(st)** **motive** is important here and leads to his decision about getting the whole party here, **not just** his close friends and family) 

**SUMMARY**: SO, the whole party’s there because the timing -> MISSION/FIGHT which summons the 1^(st) reason/motive, but also because he still has his 2^(nd) reason which is important for all the people he’s close with

**OVERVIEW- people who were (assumingly) all there and why**

**Family:** *Joyce*\- his mother, has always been supportive, *Jonathan*\- brother, in past seasons he has shown how he is supportive and already knows he’s gay in season 4

**Really close friends:** *Lukas & Dustin* – have both been bullied and defended Will from homophobic bullies (s1) both are outcasts and love him unconditionally, *Mike* (as both his lover and best friend) – has also been bullied and was the one who stood up for Will the most in s1 when many called him homophobic slurs – their bond is so strong no matter what (“crazy together”)

**Friends:** *Max* – friend since s2 - has experienced abuse by her homophobic racist brother **(“I don’t want to be like him, ever”)** is also an outsider, *El*\- sees Will not only as a friend but as family – loves him unconditionally and has been an outsider her whole life as well (“I don’t belong, anywhere”), *Robin* – Will’s mentor, queer role model and friend – obviously supports him

*Vickie*\- Robin’s girlfriend - supportive

*Steve*\- has been taking care of all of the kids (Dustin, Mike, Lukas and Will) and is an ally

*Nancy* – Mike’s sister - has made it sure she doesn’t want to continue her parent’s traditional mindset & Will has been living with her for some time now – they have established a family-like bond

*Murray* – outsider of society “crazy conspiracist reporter” - intuition for people’s feelings, brings people together – has probably known about Will’s sexuality/feelings (and Mike) for some time now

*Kali/8* – fights for outsiders/outcasts and firmly supports minorities, maybe there’s another reason for here being there as well? (im not sure)

*Jim* – has cared for Will since season 1 like a father, has saved him multiple times, ex-cop          -> no further explanation

CONCLUSION:  all of these people are in some way/form outcasts from law and society – Chekov’s gun as reasoning – everything/one has a role here

The moment you’ve been waiting for: **BYLER PART in WILL’S COME OUT**

OKAY HEAR ME OUT. (ALSO, about anything I presume I am gonna be very careful about expressing because this is all an interpretation/assumption)

I KNOW A LOT of people immediately thought it was over for byler not only before the coming out, but also after Will babbling about Mike being his Tammy and how Mike had no 'real' reaction even though it was confirmed later on he knew Will was talking about him as his crush.

The Tammy part rlly confused me as well AT FIRST but I think…

\->.. Will doesn't know after all if Mike likes him in that way for sure, like said many times, we have never heard or seen anything from his pov (POV=MISSING PIECE), and in that case I think he tips on him being straight despite of the signs of attraction they have clearly been initiating (more of that later on, let me cook)

\->.. Will mistakes their relationship because of said point above, there’s miscommunication in between them which is the major thing blocking them **(heteronormativity)**

\- You can really clearly see this from Will's side when he tries to fix/push Mike into El's direction in season 4. This is him trying to convince/gaslight himself Mike is not gay (and also partly himself) At this time he was still trying to figure out and fight his doubts about his own sexuality, which is very hard in the **8Os without any representation, support from the outer world or acceptance or even the thematization of gayness**. I could go on about Will, but Mike as a person who is, now in s5vol2 still in the closet and grew up not only experiencing homophobia through bullying like Will but also through his very traditional and conservative family and small-town environment, is also pressured by society’s expectations of being as normal as possible. So, this miscommunication as a wall between them is **NOT one-sided**. Let’s not forget Will's homophobic father as well.

IN general, the **situation (politically, time and place wise)** is ONCE AGAIN SAID VERY IMPORTANT HERE.

\->.. Mike could be/is both Vicky and Tammy (to Will – he can’t see it yet)

**WHY TAMMY:** Not only does Will clearly doubt or think Mike doesn’t like him back in some way, because that's how we too saw Mike's reaction or at least that’s how many interpreted it to be. (Added note: There are alr many Bylers that have analysed his micro facial reactions and concluded he may have almost had teary eyes and has nodded in agreement to what Will was saying.)

**SO, to conclude**, Will could see or sees Mike as an unreciprocated love, that’s what Robin's relationship with Tammy and Will's - Mike's could have in common (the only thing they could have in common) -> Reason why Will maybe used “Tammy”

 

**WHY VICKIE:** Mike could definitely also be Vickie in that sense. Even though Robin and Vickie haven't rlly been ""friends"" before they got together (meant they dent have an all too similar relationship like Will-Mike) Will probably sees the chance of a reciprocated, happy relationship and a good ending for him and Mike in Robin's experiences when she's talking about her relationship with Vickie. Not only this, but also because of the signs Robin talks about being clearly there and the snowball that has been building up during their many years of being special friends. And Mike and Will could definitely have this ending, could definitely end up together. And we can see Will having these hopes as well, the feeling of him being perhaps right about their relationship: what it really is.

 

 **Another PRESUMPTION about Will's USAGE OF ""TAMMY""** : Since Will used very similar phrases to Robin, he has maybe been projecting her personal experiences incorrectly onto himself/ has misunderstood and misused “Tammy” partly due to his own missing experience and relationship knowledge and his doubt of Mike's sexuality.

\->ROBIN being the only gay person/the only real role model he knows in the whole fricking town and also anywhere ever in a personal sense HE THEREFORE feels bound to her, trusts and looks up to her. Perhaps he takes her advice very literal when she’s talking about her own  experiences of having a crush. Think about it. He has never had multiple crushes before, only Mike and he basically doesn't know anything about having a gay relationship, because the true nature of his and Mike’s relationship is very suppressed and still very strong to ""just being friends""/not talking about their feelings/not openly questioning their relationship and sexuality

**MIKE KNOWS ABOUT HIM BEING WILL’S CRUSH**

This was confirmed by the Duffer brothers and for many, this made it even worse, not just because of how badly this was communicated through the writing (very unobvious), but also **how Mike’s reaction** and no conversation afterwards made it **seem utterly unreciprocated**. I think the exact opposite. **WHY?**

**-> Mike’s emotions**

\- teary/lightly misty eyes

\- nodded and smiled during Will’s speech

\- looked at Will the entire time

\- DIDN’T HUG HIM IMMEDIATELY because he was connecting the dots using not only the painting of Will from s4 (means if it has alr been used for Mike to figure out Will meant him as his crush, they ARE somehow going to reference/talk about this next episode) but everything else that has been going on in their friendship since it started -> therefore he looked kinda zoned out/stunned

**No Mike – Will conversation afterwards?**

This has a few reasons I presume (some plausible some less...)

The coming out was very spontaneously *squeezed* in you could say, in the 15 last minutes of volume 2 that is. Afterwards, you could see the party starting the execution of their final plan on fighting Vecna, heading into the upside down.

\-**Lack of time:** There hasn’t really been **time** for Mike and Will to talk alone, there was **barely time for the coming out** but it had to be done before they headed out to fight Vecna. So, they didn’t have the chance to talk (just the both of them). That’s why the coming out felt impersonal for many viewers, it had to be that many people way because of them having to go and execute their plan, but also in order to make it impossible for Mike and Will to be alone.

\- **WHY in the last 15 mins?**

The Duffer brothers obviously love a good cliffhanger, resolving them always in the next episode to make people nervous/curious and to get them speculating/conspiring – they are testing us. The duffer brothers made it confusing, creating lots of questions, doubts and anxieties on purpose. They know the fandom; they want to build tension and suspense like they always do.

 They want to create strong and maybe also negative emotions. They want to hear theories from people who are really anxious now BECAUSE there’s not enough time for everything to fit in and stuff - and it obviously works because there’s lots of pressure on us and expectations. What, HOW, when? (maybe they are sadists in that sense lol)

In general, for the last episode, they have guaranteed that they will resolve all plots and all dots will be connected. I trust that will happen, since it would make NO sense if Mike and Will wouldn’t talk in some way about the painting/the coming out after it’s been confirmed Mike knows about Will’s crush being him.

 

**ANOTHER WAY BYLER COULD HAPPEN?**

I didn't have much byler doubt after volume 2, I knew volume 3 was gonna resolve everything and especially after brainstorming with my friend/going through everything, we are both sure. Not only that, but my friend has also created a plausible theory about Byler happening in the finale fight in the ABYSS against Vecna:

**SUMMARY OF THEORY** ( whole theory here: [will is an unreliable narrator and how his coming out could parallel mike getting vecna'd (theory?)](https://www.reddit.com/r/byler/comments/1pwn1wb/will_is_an_unreliable_narrator_and_how_his_coming/) )

**Mike**: not only Will's weakness, but also Jane's. (Even if you don't ship Mileven, you have to agree their bond is still strong)

\---> Final theory: Vecna will target Mike using his internalised homophobia. He will get into Mike's mind using this fear/insecurity to hurt/attempt to kill him to scare/distract Will and Jane at the same time. Since Mike is really important to both of them Vecna could easily distract Will and Jane with one blow. Also: maybe he already has been watching Mike? I've seen people already talk about this, how Mike drinks lots of coffee and just generally zones out a lot. This would explain his numbness/emotionless behaviour a bit.

\- MIKE DOESN'T know/expect Vecna’s manipulation tactic (using people's fears/insecurities against them) and  he's never been targeted before (not like ALL the other Wheeler's) - we never see Mike's POV because it would spoil his feelings for Will and they might plan on revealing these when Mike is targeted by Vecna is episode 8.

 \- The Sequence of Vecna showing Will a bad hallucination in the upside down is not revealed to us although this is very important UNLESS that's the whole point. If we assume Will is an unreliable narrator this could be a plot twist in some way.

Thanks for reading! I hope I could somehow provide some clarity (if there is even any anymore) <3 (IM LOSING IT)",26,1766964153.0,byler,3,0.82,False

My Nana is in her late eighties, and while she still gets around really well for her ages, her house has fallen into a state of disarray. I came down to visit her a few days before Christmas to help her make food and wrap presents and get the house ready. The place was quite honestly awful. It obviously had not been vacuumed in several weeks, I couldn’t even see the kitchen counters or the table top, and the dishes and trash were overflowing. The bathroom was unimaginable, mold in the shower, poop smudges on the toilet seat, and the sink had a coat of grime. The whole place was a mess. It’s always bad when I get down here, but it was really awful this time. So, just like I do, I deep clean everything. I vacuum the dog treat crumbles out of in between the couch cushions, scrub the toothpaste globs out of the sink, and vacuum enough to fill up multiple canisters. 

Now my uncle is in his early fifties, and he lives in the only bedroom in the house. Because of this, my Nana sleeps in a recliner in the living room, or occasionally on the couch when she her back gets bad enough and she needs to stretch out. He was married to a woman we will call Nancy. They had two kids, and outwardly they seemed relatively happy. However, she always looked tired, like her hair needed washing, and she wore baggy house clothes whenever I saw her. When they divorced, and she found her new now husband, she transformed. She now has beautiful brown hair with blond highlights that she keeps curled in an adorable bob. She wears makeup, her skin seems to be glowing, and she wears pretty outfits. I’m not saying that wearing makeup and pretty outfits is what makes a woman happy, but her energy has also shifted. She and her husband obviously love each other so much, she is always smiling and laughing. And what’s also obvious now is how unhappy she was in her previous marriage. 

After they divorced my uncle who we will call John moved back in with my Nana. He goes to work about once every three days, he stays up til two or three, and sleeps until anywhere from eleven to two. She tries to get me and anyone else who is in the house to stay quiet so he can sleep in the mornings, even though he isn’t quiet at all when he’s stomping around in the middle of night. He eats my nana’s food, has two out of three shelves in the kitchen cabinet dedicated to his stuff, he uses her water her electricity all of it. When he moved in, he dumped all of his stuff in a room in the back of the house and hasn’t done anything with it for three years. Speaking of he just came in the living room and woke her up from her afternoon nap to ask what’s for dinner, which he does every single day. She tells me he pays her rent, but… still. He has his own coffee maker since he doesn’t like her coffee. He doesn’t put the lid down in the bathroom. He makes messes and doesn’t clean up. And he doesn’t do ANYTHING TO HELP HER. 

Also, he is mean. So grumpy. He snaps at her, gets really irritated at small things, and sometimes downright ignores people when they try to talk to him or ask him questions. Like literally sits there like he doesn’t hear them. When she asks him questions or says anything to her he will respond in a gruff and rude way. He has yelled at her a few times too. 

Last of all, he is gross. He is pretty overweight, is balding, smells of booze and sweat and something tangy or sour. His room is gross, with food in his bed and an inch of dust on everything. The hairbrush he uses is caked in scalp skin and his toothbrush isn’t white anymore, it’s brown. Like his teeth. He has big bulging eyes and very long toenails. He can also be heard coughing and clearing his through and hacking up goo which I can only imagine he swallows about once every ten seconds (I have spent time counting yes). It’s like when you brush your teeth in the morning and hack and cough when you brush the back of your tongue. It’s sooo gross. 

Overall I hate him, he is gross and mean and takes advantage of my Nana’s kindness and sympathy. She says he is depressed, which he probably is, but I think he is what he is. A fifty something year old man living with his mom with no independence or goal of moving out, who works just enough to pay what little rent he pays her, who is mean and gross and incompetent.

I'm redoing my living room from the ground up, and am approaching this thoughtfully, so I'd love some help from this group of gurus!

I have a massive 14x10 Karastan rug that's *incredibly* colorful, and it will be the rug in my living room. I'm kind of stuck on how to style the rest of the room since the rug is a loud(ish) anchor piece. This isn't where I got it, but [here's a link to the same rug with close-ups](https://thenuvestore.com/products/karastan-rug-8-8-x-10-6-multicolor-panel-kirman-rug-717-original-700-series-wool) so you can see all the different colors in it.

I love color in general, so I don't want **everything** to default to leather/neutral/muted. My general style is vintage-inspired/heirloom pieces, modern eclectic-ish. (If it helps, the rest of my home is 90% from Schoolhouse; I basically raided their website during their 60% off sale!)

Here's a photo of the few pieces I do have for my living room:

* Shelves that will be used as my media center (will have a mounted tv above it)
* Mirror
* Hooks
* Wireless lamp to go on the top shelf of my media center

[Living room pieces I have so far](https://preview.redd.it/n2ifewro21ag1.png?width=2026&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e896dab5f219ae8b77cc317c996aed32735b478)

Also, not sure if it matters, but my walls are white and my floor is dark hardwood.

Basically, I'm looking for thoughts on the following:

* What should I do as my couch and side table? I'm eyeing the Albany Park Kova Pillow Couch in the blue velvet, but I don't know if that will weigh down the room.
* What should I look for in an accent chair? I feel pretty good aiming for a leather chair here as the sole/one of the few leather pieces; I think it'll help have different textures in the space.
* Any coffee table or (better) lamp ideas?
* Anything else that comes to mind when thinking of an approach to color/texture/styling around a loud rug!

Thank you so much in advance for any thoughts!",1,1766963932.0,interiordesignideas,0,1.0,False
1py5pe5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1py5pe5,Why creating an AI model is the simplest and best R/R side hustle you can try in 2026 and how to exactly do it!,"One of the best ways to make [money online is selling](https://theaimodelmethod.online/). Whether your selling leads, programs or content, the residuals that come in make the difference when your away from keyboard.

[Ai model side hustle content](https://theaimodelmethod.online/), fits perfectly into this, and one of the reasons why it's so scalable. You are selling content whilst your asleep. True, chatting makes the most money.. But with fanvue you always have PPV content ready to sell to new subscribers. And you can outsource chatting later to have 24/7 coverage.

How you earn money;  
\- Subscriber renewals after a free trial with card entry, $4.99 a month - 6 month discount say $40..  
\- PPV content in creator feed to buy whenever, depending what media it is, $20-$100 (videos)  
\- PPV scenario content or ad-hoc images when chatting, upto $300-500 (heavily depends if chatting to a whale)

Now I want to revisit the key thing i see people failing at i mentioned [in an earlier post](https://www.reddit.com/r/HustlersUniversity/comments/1ppcegi/ai_model_content_you_should_be_looking_to_copy_to/), it's important so have a look if your serious about creating an AI model.

For social media content that grows, and for content that sells. COPY AN EXISTING ONLYFANS MODEL who is successful.  
Download of bunch of images of hers, reverse engineer the prompts you need for images with [https://huggingface.co/spaces/fancyfeast/joy-caption-alpha-two](https://huggingface.co/spaces/fancyfeast/joy-caption-alpha-two)

Create your own versions with YOUR MODEL, copy the captions, and upload / sell on fanvue.

You are copying what is trending for socials at least, it will work. Not generic vanilla AI poses holding a cup of coffee etc..

Now content creation.

For SFW content, use Seedream on higgsfield, find HD images of a real woman whose niche you want as a reference image, create **your own** AI version in seedream with these reference images.

I have covered the process in detail for free here [https://www.reddit.com/r/HustlersUniversity/comments/1pgyt6a/full\_free\_content\_creation\_guide\_for\_the\_ai\_model/](https://www.reddit.com/r/HustlersUniversity/comments/1pgyt6a/full_free_content_creation_guide_for_the_ai_model/)

For NSFW content, i use [mimicpc.com](http://mimicpc.com/) for a online server with auto1111 installed, i download loras from [civit.ai](http://civit.ai/) that are specifically trained for NSFW content.

I produce images from reverse engineered prompts from OF model nsfw content, make sure my models body shape was prompted in, so i have my own models version of the same images, i then faceswap my AI models face in.

After this produce videos on Wan or Kling.

In terms of process, thats it!

My guide has all the prompts and shortcuts, and detailed loras for near perfect image production you need [https://theaimodelmethod.online/](https://theaimodelmethod.online/)

A few things were obvious.  There are many great roasters out there.  Most of them are pretty hit-or-miss.  I have had great bags from roasters I had never heard of and consistently mediocre beans from famous or hyped brands.  I am not even going to do honorable mentions since they are so numerous.   Without further ado:

1. Might as well start with the obvious.  I drank more Glitch than anything else, and they were extraordinary across the board.  They are extremely hyped, sometimes a bit precious, and expensive, but in my opinion, they delivered on everything.  Enough said.
2. Peoples Possession.  Their brand is hyperbolic, with epilepsy-inducing graphics on their website (no, seriously), but again, their coffee delivers.  I had consistently great bags of interesting coffee from this roaster.  
3. Inugami Coffee.  ""Cinderella story, out of nowhere, former greenskeeper, now about to become the Masters champion. It looks like a mirac- it's in the hole! It's in the hole!"" - Carl Spackler.  Seriously though.  Home roaster from Phoenix, Arizona.  Produced some of my favorite coffees of this year.  The Django was amazing in every way. I brewed it as everything from pour-overs to espressos, to Cuban coffee in a moka pot.  I only tried a few bags, but they were all extremely interesting and tasty.  I am going to drink a lot more in 2026.
