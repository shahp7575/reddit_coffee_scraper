1it0iwa,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1it0iwa/looking_for_espresso_coffee_grinder_advice_250/,Looking for espresso coffee grinder advice [£250],"Hey guys,

I'm struggling to find something that fits my needs. I am looking for a coffee grinder that is capable of fine grinds so that I can use my unpressurised basket in my Sage Bambino.

The requirements I have are,

'Cheap' as possible
If manual grinder - can be any colour
If electric grinder - must be stainless or brushed steel to match the Bambino

I was looking at the Sage Smart Grinder Pro but then I was reading that it's considered quite poor for the price and that a Baratza Encore ESP is better for the price (but is not silver stainless or brushed steel so doesnt match the requirements)

Thanks for your help in advance, i am willing to use no-name brands for grinders if there's something interesting in that department (like something from aliexpress)",1,1739952822.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

My time is usually spent as follows: photography, podcasts, history, comedy, art movements, movies, culture, music, traveling, science, coffee, languages, books, or we could just talk about the weather and many more topics so please reach out!

If none of these topics are your thing and your interests are completely different, I’d still love to hear from you. Penpaling is a creative exchange, and I enjoy learning about perspectives and pursuits outside my own world.

It’d be great to message here first and if we pass the vibe check, we could move to e-letters via email or go the classic route with snail mail.  I’d love to include prints of photographs I’ve taken, especially from my travels (think of them as postcards) in future snail mail.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

1it0gcl,https://www.reddit.com/r/MedicalCannabis_NI/comments/1it0gcl/7_strategies_to_destress_your_life/,7 Strategies to De-Stress Your Life,"Stress is part of what comes with being a human, but for some, stress builds up and becomes an everyday occurrence that is tough to run from. Responsibilities with family, work, and relationships tend to pile up fast, leaving us overwhelmed and overworked.

There are a number of factors that have the ability to impact stress levels, and a lot of it will feel out of your control, but there are some time-tested methods for combatting that stress. In this article, we’re going to share 7 strategies to help you de-stress, slow down, and feel your best.

 

# Diet



Maintaining a healthy, balanced diet is one of the more overlooked aspects of stress management. A fast-food or ultra-processed diet is [detrimental to our health](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8103503/) and mental well-being. The trans fats and other additives in these foods cause inflammation, which puts direct stress on our digestive system that spreads throughout our bodies. These highly processed, high calorie meals also make it difficult for our bodies to manage energy levels and get a good night sleep, which will impact stress levels.

On the other hand, a diet that is balanced and healthy will support the immune system, restore damaged cells and regulate cortisol levels. For this kind of nourishment, turn to vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and sustainably sourced meat and fish.

 

# Cannabis



The science is on our side. THC is the psychoactive compound that give us the feeling of being ‘high’, but it is also shown to lower stress levels in small doses. But the real shining star is CBD, which has been [scientifically proven](https://www.jeffersonhealth.org/your-health/living-well/is-cannabis-a-remedy-for-anxiety) to have positive effect on stress. 





# Activity



Simply moving your body is one of the oldest stress-reducing tricks in the book. This time-tested strategy works wonders, regardless of the type of exercise you choose. You don’t need to be an athlete – walking, yoga, biking, or aerobics will all do the trick. But why is exercise so effective at diffusing stress?

The name of the game is endorphins. When you move your body, your brain releases neurotransmitters that make you feel good. This is what people are talking about when they refer to a “runner’s high”, but this same feeling can be experienced at a lower level from just doing any exercise – you don’t need to run 20km.

Aside from the endorphin-pumping activity going on in the brain, exercise will physically de-stress your body. Everything from your heart, muscles, and immune system will benefit from a little exercise-induced heavier breathing.

 

# Caffeine



Caffeine is a magical substance that millions of Canadians rely on every day just to get out of bed and become productive. At low doses, [drinking coffee is totally fine](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/caffeine/art-20045678) and can provide you with that boost you’re looking for. The performance enhancing benefits have been confirmed in numerous studies, but caffeine doesn’t agree with everyone’s system the same way.

Caffeine stimulates the central nervous system, which can lead to alertness and focus, but also irritability and anxiousness. It affects everyone differently. Some will get the mood-boosting benefits with no side effects, and others will start to feel extremely anxious or even more sleepy. You can [dive into the science](https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/feb/15/the-truth-about-caffeine-how-coffee-really-affects-our-bodies) for a better explanation, but it’s generally advised to limit your intake to 4 cups of coffee per day.

 

# Friends & Family



Quality time spent with friends and family can have a huge impact on our stress levels. Of course this could be a stressful situation depending on who you’re spending time with, but in general, spending time with people you love has the power to lift your mood. After engaging with people you care about, the stress of the day seems to dissipate and become less significant.

Over the years, studies have confirmed that social activity and hanging out with people you love is good for your well-being. On average, people with strong social connections are [happier, healthier, and live longer](https://hsph.harvard.edu/health-happiness/news/from-loneliness-to-social-connection-lessons-from-research-and-a-global-pandemic/). Part of the reason is because quality social time prompts your body to produce endorphins similar to going for a run, while lowering feelings of loneliness and anxiety. We need people in our lives to maintain our well-being.

 

# Phone



If you’re feeling over-stressed, something to keep in mind is your phone. Having you been staring at it for the better part of your day? And how does it make you feel when you do look at it? In most scenarios, this screen time doesn’t evoke positive feelings.

While the smart phone has been an incredible invention allowing people to dramatically increase productivity and connectivity, the technology comes with its drawbacks. In numerous studies, it has been concluded that increased use of the phone – particularly harmful activities like social media – tend to [increase levels of stress and anxiety](https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-022-04419-8).

At the very least, make an effort to be more mindful of your phone use. Start by recognizing when and how it makes you feel more stressed, and work towards minimizing your time or reducing unproductive activities on your phone.

 

# Nature



According to the [Canadian Psychological Association](https://cpa.ca/psychology-works-fact-sheet-benefits-of-nature-exposure/), exposure to nature has the ability to enhance your mental health, cope with stress, and maintain a positive outlook. Even just a few minutes spent in nature can reduce feelings of stress, boost attention, and improve mood. In addition, as we spend more time with nature, we start to become more connected with nature. This bond encourages people to not only take better care of their environment, but themselves as well.

For many people these days, much of life is spent removed from nature. Perched up in apartment buildings and commuting to and from office buildings, nature isn’t so easy to come by. Luckily, the Lower Mainland is a great place to be for access to nature. There are countless parks and forest trails, plus just a short drive will take you to the ocean or into the mountains.

1it0erl,https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkred/comments/1it0erl/miami_dades_last_days/,Miami Dade's last Days....,"**Before you begin: I used this scenario as a side trek style adventure for my players. It can easily be scaled to fit any party size. It might be important to note to players that the mission starts at a gentlemen's club, and tackles sensitive issues like abuse, and drug trafficking. I set this mission in 2045 and the Voodoo Boyz are still a gang to concern your players with, but they aren't the heavy hitters on the Night City scene they once was.** 



Located in the Rancho Cornado District, the Pink Champagne Lounge has had a a few owners. The last was a mid level corporate named Diedre Clawson who was killed while on an op for the Rocklin Augmentic Corporation. She passed the establishment to her lover Clint Walker. When Walker took over he wanted to stop the stripping and make it a country and western music bar. He quickly came to realize not only would it put some people out of work, it would likely bankrupt him. Since he has taken over the club, he has cleaned the place up a lot. Many simple things like teaching his bouncers to spot trouble brewing, and cutting off customers who have overindulged. 



These few steps have made the business more profitable and safer for the customers, making this a place frequented by college students, beavers, and low level execs. Burly fellows from his nomad pack fill out the security staff, while dancers and waitressing staff come from multiple walks of life. The PCs are called the the club to talk to Walker about a problem he needs solved.



*PC Question: Why wouldn't Walker handle this issue himself, or put his nomad crew on it. Quite simply he's a business owner and payback could blow back on his club or his family. It's also fair to say that nomads have a fairly particular skillset and as a general rule investigations isn't top of their list.* 



{Walker is a muscular, thirty something year old man, wearing armored Jeans, a sleeveless flannel shirt, and a cowboy hat. He is a good looking fellow with strapping biceps, but he has a bit of an attitude. He tends to mix sarcasm in with regular speech, and can say the most outlandish shit with a straight face to make the players guess if he's serious. When it comes to the PCs he's gonna like the one that have an acid wit like his.} 



Walker: ""I keep telling these girls not to fall for the hook. Most of the time it's the heartbreak of their prince charming not calling. This time a fucker knocked the piss of her. This guy...from what she said was having issues getting his little soldier to march. She tried but he just punched her, kicked her, and left her naked on the motel room floor."" He scoffs and shakes his head. ""Then he walks out, gets into his car with his bodyguards, and away he rides. I want this fucker to pay, but frankly all I have is a name, and it's a street name no doubt. Miami Dade. Can't make this shit up. I'll pay you each 250eb to put something on his ass that Ajax won't take off.""



*{He is trying to play fixer with the characters but doesn't exactly know what the going rate is for a beatdown. His maximum is 500eb each, but can sweeten the deal with a night of free drinks, a meal, and letting the staff know the players deserve the heroes treatment. He is also fairly ambiguous with the job. Making the corporate pay could be anything from a beating to wetwork, as long as he never darkens the door of his club again, he doesn't care.}*



Tracking Miami Dade is a little bit tricky as he's so under the radar very few people have heard of him. A library search would find a few corporates named Dade in their employ {DV 15}. A streetwise of DV 13 is the players best bet. A good fixer will know who to ask and working girls are the source of good intel. Miami Dade is known to some working girls in the University and Little Europe Districts. None of them know where he lives, but a few know he works for Continental Brands. Some say he's the party man of the year with drugs and a nice attitude. Other's say he's a crash course in sexual frustration and potentially violent. They ALL say he likes to take his girls to Dilly's in New Westbrook. 



\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



N.A.K.E.D. Compound



Cops can find out there was an assault involving a man named Dade several months back and there was an arrest. A small time Ganger named Topshot. His 'gang' in Little Europe is called Naked. {Nuclear Assault Kompetition Elimination Division} His gang is not really a gang at all, but a large group of kids who play the wargame Nuclear Assault competitively against one another. They drink a lot of Smash, eat junk food, and play games. Topshot is a 19 year old netrunner named Lawrence Pinciotti and he acts much cooler than he actually is. Despite the gamer crews obvious lack of criminal skills and tendancies towards violence except on a screen, there are plenty of guns around. Standard firearms with custom game skins in camo, character motif, and so on. 



At one time this place was an auto shop, but now boarded up and abandoned. The perimeter is surrounded by a 12 foot high fence, and this fence is bolstered with tin roofing material that will make it more difficult to crime. Even though it looks closed up teenage boys are going in. From 12 to 16 in school age making their way inside and the gate closed behind them. Knocking on the door will get a slot opened. ""Who are you?"" The kid at the gate will fuck with the players a bit before telling them they are too old to hang out and fuck off elsewhere. Getting inside will require some finagling. An offer to buy some Smash, some girlie magazines or showing some boobs. Once inside the scenery changes. Christmas lights are strung up everywhere and a couple of large tv sets are hooked back to back. A pair of kids are playing the game, which is basically a first person shooter on a timer. Both players are trying to get through the others defenses to a safe bunker before a nuke goes off. Mines, barricades, vehicles, and troops hamper your every step until the end. As they play you notice an older kid sitting on a raised dias on a wicker chair throne. Cans of smash are tied to it, and he is wearing mirrorshades and holding a tiki torch. He like everyone else is caught up in the match and the current leaderboard. You also notice a couple kids keeping an eye on a forge and wearing protective gear. 

  
*{They are melting down aluminum cans to make competition medals}*



Topshot will listen to what the players have to say, and every eye will be on them as they speak to him. Every kid in this makeshift compound is ready for shit to pop off and if the players mention Dade he smiles. ""So you all are after him? Let's step into my office. EVERYONE continue the tournament."" He leads them inside the shop which has been converted into some private living quarters. There is room inside to continue the games, but outside is a bit more space. inside he drops the fascade of all powerful lord of the flies. ""Fuck that dude man...bout six months ago he tried to cruise my little sister thinking she was on the stroll...I happened to be around and gave him a good beating. Got busted...let out...next thing I know the dude has a couple heavies with him from the Voodoo Boyz. That crew has a cook they recruited from Mexico...some super chemist. The Haitians at the moment are outgunned, but they are the real deal Voodoo wise. Oh Dade...yeah those heavies was looking for me a minute but gave up. Anyhow Dade works for Continental brands. A fucking low level accountant, I hacked the place and cracked it like an egg and set up a backdoor to get back in. He lives in a mid range apartment about a block from his office...and nowdays he's thick with those Voodoo Boyz."" He pauses and shrugs. ""I know he takes girls to Dilly's in New Westbrook...cheap rooms...clean...a no tell motel.""



\----------------------------------------------------------------------------



Dilly's is exactly how Topshot described it. A no tell motel that is a nationwide chain with a condom hat wearing pickle mascot. If you think it sounds ridiculous hearing the description, it's nothing compared to stepping inside. The room is dim with neon purple and pink lights all over. Somewhat clean clips from the hotels available porn selection is playing on a nearby television. There is not only a coffee bar but a Smash machine in the lobby where a beer can be vended with the slide of a credstick. Aside from the suggestive signage posted in the lobby featuring Dilly, there are signs advising cameras are in operation 24/7 as well as another advertising 24 hour housekeeping on staff. 



Many of the front desk staff at Dilly's belong to one of two allied gangs in the area. The Street Queens and the Boychics. Both are very LGBT friendly however they are two different gangs with different policies on accepting members. Aside from membership they are loyal to the defense of one another in New Westbrook, and will posse up together to handle issues in other districts if needed. 



As much as the staff would like to help, they are held to a privacy policy that could get them fired if they give information on the clock. Off the clock or on break one of them might break loose a little information with some friendly banter or flirting. {A player could join either of the gangs if they were inclined and fell within guidelines, but these two gangs both value allies of all types.} Good friends to have as it often takes people who know the street to have that valuable street intel. 



\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------



The Boychics are a Night City gang that is staffed with members of the LGBTQ lifestyle beyond Gay and Lesbian. Trans make up the biggest portion of the gang with others also filling the ranks. The gang is small and based out of New Westbrook. When they do take action it's general a violent one against someone who hurt someone from their community. They are allied and share territory with the Street Queens in New Westbrook. 



\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------



The following information could be gained from any number of street sources. A fixer with the right payment. A gang member who wants to see the Voodoo Boyz get a bloody nose. A Corpo could also pay his street contacts for the information. Either way the scheme is uncovered and it's alot of money. So much so it's no wonder the Haitians are losing the street war with the Voodoo Boyz. This is just one of many new drugs popping up on the streets and it's curious how they have become such distributions juggernauts in the past few months. 



Continental Brands has an office in Little Europe as well as a warehouse. The factory ships goods to Vancouver Canada as well as Alaska. Food and cereal products mostly. Dade is an accountant but has a wide range of power in the company. All access to areas for inspections and excetera. The man known as Miami Dade is double dipping. Making a salary from Continental Brands is just play money for him. The real payoff is him taking a few friends into the warehouse after hours, and packing a few marked crates with drugs for a fixer in Vancouver. His team consists of a netrunner who hides the packing process, and a man at the other end that gets the product to buyer. The money is deposited in his Worldbank account prior to the switch, and he pays the Voodoo Boys. 



\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Continental Brands Warehouse Battle



The Voodoo Boyz have a lot invested into their drug trade. So much so they have insurance policies where they count. Miami Dade's two bodyguards are full members of the Voodoo Boyz who's job it is to keep him out of trouble and useful. Since Dade's addiction has taken hold things are getting worse. The pair are reporting his erratic behavior to their boss Prince Jimi who is hoping he can keep the corpo under control until they find a way to replace him, and is completely oblivious to the fact that a crew has been hired to make an example of him. 



Jimi rolls deep with several of his gang to pack his drugs for shipping. Each is armed with pistols, rippers, and subguns and in several SUVs. {They also have lots of gonja around so whoopee} The players could handle this any number of ways. They could set the Haitians on the Voodoo Boyz at the drop, which will be dramatic and weaken the Voodoo Boyz on site. They could attempt to negotiate transport of the drug to Canada, cutting out the corporate and making him useless to the gang. Of course the pack would need some payment. {His behavior is out of control they want a replacement} A corpo with connections could also make the same deal, but it would be an under the table kindof thing that would get them in trouble if discovered. They could also go for the tried and true, guns blazing, kill em all approach. 



For the combat option one Voodoo Boyz ganger outside per party member. Inside the building Prince Jimi, Johnnie 2 Smokes, Skids, and Miami Dade. The building security guard is either off property getting lunch, paid for by the gang and Dade, or whatever.



Once the firefight pops off the men inside can either make a break for it, or lay in wait for whomever comes in. 

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GM ONLY 



Can we kill all the Voodoo Boyz and take the dope? SURE!!! Money Shot is a drug that's gonna stand out in Night City. Anyone who tries to move it will eventually get the attention of the Voodoo Boyz and likely be gunned down or much worse.



The corpos apartment? Glad you asked. The players could get into the conapt apartments Dade lives in. Inside his place they won't find much in the way of cash, but he has expensive tastes in Wine and a large nude painting of (insert your games favorite female celeb here} that was put to canvas BEFORE she hit it big. Can easily be moved for 7000 eb. A fixer could put some feelers out and get up 2d10x1000 + 7000 eb for it. {Max 27000 eb} This could be an adventure in and of itself as a sort of mini hiest. 







\------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Money Shot

Type: Recreational Drug  {Increase Body by +1, Endurance+2} 

Difficulty: 12 

Duration: 1d2 Hours 

Street Value: 100 eb minimum each 

Consumption:  Inhaled



While the drug has a Rave feel and a pornographic name the packaging is important. It is given out as a rolled up, FAKE euro with the powder inside. You peel open one side of the bill, a toot for each nostril, and it's partytime. The party crowd loves it, allowing them to party longer, and harder than they ever could normally. 



Side Effects: Increases Body by +1 and Endurance checks by +2. This drug could in fact be used as a combat drug with the benefits listed, however the other effect is a raised libido that the user feels the urge to satisfy. This effect lasts as long as the effects of the drug. 



Secondary side effects: Failure of an addiction save {DV 12} results in -1 body and impotence. A med tech can negate the effects of addiction with treatment and medicinal therapy. This would be due to several doses of the drug being taken in a 24 hour period. (2 or more with difficulty increasing per dose} Continued dosing could lead to the necessity of a Mr. Studd or Midnight Lady.

1it0eoo,https://www.reddit.com/r/cuck_femdom_tales/comments/1it0eoo/university_life_chapter_00_prologue/,University Life - Chapter 00 Prologue,"The city buzzed with life, its streets alive with the hum of traffic, the chatter of students, and the occasional blare of a distant siren. Somewhere in the heart of it all, in a small, cluttered apartment overlooking a narrow alley, David sat hunched over his desk. The glow of his computer screen illuminated his face, casting shadows across the room. His fingers danced across the keyboard, commanding armies, building empires, and escaping into worlds far removed from his own. Gaming had always been his refuge, his sanctuary. It was where he felt most in control, most at ease.

Across the room, Emma lounged on the couch, her phone pressed to her ear. Her laughter rang out, bright and melodic, filling the space with an energy that David could never quite replicate. She was the sun to his moon—radiant, magnetic, and impossible to ignore. Even now, as she chatted animatedly with one of her many friends, David found himself glancing over, his attention drifting from the screen to her. She was wearing one of his hoodies, the sleeves rolled up to her elbows, her hair tied up in a messy bun. She looked effortlessly beautiful, as always.

""Wait, wait, tell me again what he said!"" Emma exclaimed, her voice rising in excitement. She kicked her feet up on the coffee table, knocking over an empty soda can in the process. David didn’t even flinch. He was used to her chaos, her whirlwind presence. He quietly got up, picked up the can, and placed it in the recycling bin before returning to his desk.

Their friendship was an odd one, to say the least. They had known each other since they were children, their lives intertwined from the moment they met in kindergarten. David had always been the quiet one, the boy who preferred the company of books and video games to people. Emma, on the other hand, was a force of nature. Even as a child, she had been outgoing and confident, the kind of girl who could make friends with anyone. While David spent his recesses sitting under a tree, lost in his thoughts, Emma was the center of attention, leading games and laughing louder than anyone else.

Somehow, despite their differences, they had clicked. David had always been content to follow her lead, to bask in her glow without demanding anything in return. And Emma? She had always appreciated his quiet loyalty, his unwavering presence. Over the years, their bond had only grown stronger, surviving the awkwardness of adolescence, the pressures of high school, and now, the challenges of university life.

 

\---- Flashback: The Group Project -----

It was their final year of high school, and the air was thick with the stress of impending exams. David and Emma had been paired together for a history project, a detailed presentation on the French Revolution. They were sitting in the school library, books and papers spread out across the table. Emma was scrolling through her phone, her fingers flying across the screen as she texted her latest boyfriend. David, meanwhile, was diligently taking notes, his handwriting neat and precise.

""David, you’re a lifesaver,"" Emma said suddenly, looking up from her phone. ""I have no idea how you manage to make this stuff so interesting.""

He shrugged, a faint blush creeping up his neck. ""It’s just… reading. You could do it too if you tried.""

She laughed, tossing her phone onto the table. ""Yeah, but why bother when I have you?"" She leaned over, peering at his notes. ""You’re like a walking encyclopedia. Seriously, how do you remember all this stuff?""

""I don’t know,"" he mumbled, his eyes fixed on the paper in front of him. ""I just… like learning, I guess.""

Emma smiled, reaching out to ruffle his hair. ""You’re such a nerd. But I love it.""

David’s heart skipped a beat at her words, though he tried not to show it. He had always had feelings for Emma, though he knew better than to act on them. She was his best friend, and he wasn’t about to risk losing her over something as foolish as unrequited love.

 

\----- Present Day: The Comfort Zone -----

Back in the apartment, Emma hung up the phone and sighed dramatically, flopping back against the couch cushions. ""Ugh, I can’t believe he ghosted me. Can you believe that? After everything I did for him!""

David swiveled his chair to face her, his expression sympathetic. ""I’m sorry, Emma. You deserve better.""

She groaned, covering her face with her hands. ""Why do I always pick the worst guys? I mean, what’s wrong with me?""

""Nothing’s wrong with you,"" David said quickly. ""You’re amazing. He’s the one who’s an idiot.""

Emma peeked at him through her fingers, a small smile tugging at her lips. ""You always know what to say, don’t you?""

He shrugged, looking down at his hands. ""I just… don’t like seeing you upset.""

She sat up, scooting closer to him. ""You’re too good to me, David. Seriously, what would I do without you?""

He didn’t answer, though the question lingered in the air between them. Emma leaned her head on his shoulder, her presence warm and comforting. For a moment, David allowed himself to imagine a world where she felt the same way he did. But then she pulled away, her phone buzzing with a new message, and the moment was gone.",1,1739952297.0,cuck_femdom_tales,0,1.0,False

As the KRW continues to fall, and all the rest of the economic issues (aging population, low birthrate, etc)... are we headed toward becoming Japan... or worse?

My feeling is that probably worse off because Koreans rely on the chaebols and their conglomerates which are still stuck on big, heavy industry business and their hierarchical structure. Companies like Samsung has missed the boat on AI and chips to support the AI boom, and misses like this, along with China becoming more self reliant and needing less and less imports from Korea, along with aging population and low fertility rate is going to stagnate the economy for decades to come. The entire country hoping that these conglomerates will do well, and somehow we will reestablish higher volume exports with China, is well, wishful thinking.

Korea needs to learn from the US (and Japan) and promote and encourage immigration of diverse groups of people and offer incentives to highly skilled workers in the tech industry. Immigrants in the US account for a large percentage of startups, and to new innovations. Korea's mentality of doing it the Korea way by Koreans, learning it on their own, and discourage the participation by foreigners with their diverse sets of skills to offer to Korea's economy is self destructive. Korea's education system is still geared for working with the large conglomerates in Korea, and offer little to no chance of encouraging the growth of startups and new innovative businesses that are also global focused (not limited to Korea). And yes, accepting more foreigners will be politically unpopular and they probably won't move to take any drastic actions.

The other thing is for the government to loosen financial support for startups, as well as creating an environment for young people to be able to take a chance, especially in tech and disruptive technologies. They need to discourage financial support for things like opening a coffee store, or some food place, which seems to be the only thing that the current workforce finds as a viable option (with a very high failure rate, and debt burden), and in the interest of unions and interest groups that are more politically viable. Suppressing disruptive companies like Tada (Korea's Uber) for the sake of unions and old folks, isn't going to help this economy get better.

What are your thoughts? What does Korea need to do to not become a stagnant economy like Japan? Are you thinking about elsewhere to live and work already?",1,1739952168.0,KoreaForEveryone,0,1.0,False

1it09ji,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoberAndHateIt/comments/1it09ji/that_good_ole_sweet_spot/,that good ole sweet spot,"Up until two years ago I used to be pretty known on certain alcohol-related subs here on Reddit as the crazy CA chick that travels the world (97 countries physically but mentally like.. 7) on her father's allowance; substance abuse and mental health issues turning this whole trip into a global dumpster fire aka my personal, little suicide mission - basically just me on the desperate hunt for a beautiful place that makes this shitty ass life somehow worth living (or a chilled beach to drink myself to death at, didn't really matter to me towards the end).

Funny thing is, I remember the process of drunkenly writing these wannabe-bukowski-style posts as if it's been yesterday - it's always been my favorite time and activity of the day; always following the same pattern. 

The Fear would jerk me awake early mornings before sunrise and I would start the day by cursing God for having the audacity to do this shit to me again (that not letting me finally die in my sleep shit to be specific). 
The beat of my racing heart echoing in my eardrums, panic gripping my throat and choking off my breath while those familiar full body tremors loosen it's grip just enough so that I'm able to quickly grab the vodka bottle besides my bed without either suffocating or vomiting all over the damn place. 

I can still feel the burn in my throat if I close my eyes and focus hard enough, but the one sensation that feels so distant - as if those years of crippling decay have merely been a sick sad fever dream - is this distinct warmth that starts to spread from your stomach through every last cell in your body, cradling you in it's holy embrace like the hurt, little child you truly are deep on the inside. Telling you it's gonna be alright, that there's no need to be scared any longer.

*Rest my child, you're home now.*

Of course we know that a single swig from the bottle won't get the job done, but it will sure make your lizard brain crave this feeling of sweet liberation to the point of giving you the superhuman strength needed to heave those heavy bones out of bed. Those poor, ancient bones carrying the weight of the whole world in their marrow. Carrying you to the fridge on wobbly legs while your fingertips are tracing the wall beside you since you know you will lose balance. Your whole life has been a progressive loss of balance. 

Focussing your blurry vision on the floor in front of you while trying to maneuver your rigid body through the piles of trash without collision. Like the damn titanic, you were bound to sink the moment you decided to take up this journey, lured by delusion and promises of sweet nothingness. Listening to the sirens while sinking deeep deeep down towards rockbottom, but there won't be anything glorious about it; nothing worth writing a movie about. 

No orchestra playing, no beauty in the tragedy, no drawings of French girls. 

Just the old 80s radio in your head, playing the same damn jazz songs on repeat once you cross that WD threshold. And filth. Maybe some rotten French fries you attempted to shove down your raw throat after you went another 3 days without eating before becoming aware of the fact that the electrolyte imbalance slowly taking over your weak body will kill you if you don't order some fucking McDonald's with your next liquor delivery.

You open the fridge and grab that beer, begging your numb fingers not to let it drop. Don't let it drop. It's glass. DON'T FUCKING LET IT DROP GOD DAMN IT YOU USELESS PIECE OF SHIT I'M BEGGING YOU YOU NEED IT AND THERE WILL BE GLASS SHARDS EVERYWHERE. 

Glass shards like the ones that line the inside of my skin every morning, crunching against eachother and tearing me apart from the inside as soon as my ribcage expands upon taking in that first, painful concious breath. Glass shards like the ones my heart is made of. It shattered a long time ago and I tried to fix it and put it back together and make it pretty and as whole as it used to be but that's all it is - a fragile construction that cuts the fingertips of everyone that tries to touch it, a subtle smile on my face everytime I see them jerk back in shock once it draws blood. Better leave now my dear - you haven't seen shit. Try touch my soul and it'll fucking make you bleed dry before you can say your last prayer.

Well, they always say *the cracks is how the light shines in* but I never asked for no fucking light, I don't want to see or be seen. I just want to sit here in this eternal darkness that has been following me like a fucking reverse halo ever since I entered this godforsaken shithole of a world and weep and drink and hurt and cause hurt and blood to be shed until this darkness finally decides to embrace me as a whole and take me home. *I'm fucking begging you, I never belonged here in first place.*

..not once in my CA carreer have I dropped that first morning beer though. Funny how the survival instinct still functions even after years of attempting to drown those last brain cells enabling you to *somehow* exist in this world. Those trembling, sad excuses of hands would even manage to pop the lid with a lighter every damn time. Chairs to a decade of muscle memory due to daily exercise I guess, I can still recall feeling like the sickest fuck walking planet earth when this older skater boy I had a crush on taught me this highly valuable skill at the age of 14. Good ole times.

I would always chugg the first beers in record time while chain smoking cigarettes until I felt the muscles in my body slowly start to relax while the grip on my cigarette simultaneously tightened to the point of me not dropping it into my lap every 5 seconds (always a funny game trying to pick up a lit ciggie before it burns the 383th hole into your grimy pants with fingers feeling like raw hotdog-sausages). 

But once I hit this sweet spot about half an hour after waking up? This sweet spot where the brain fog starts to subside but you're not yet drunk enough to reach the oblivious stage where those grey cells completely shut off again? This sweet spot between withdrawals and stupor where everything is just OK and there are no more worries and no pain and you wish this moment would just be there forever before it slips through your fingers with the next sip like literally everything beautiful you ever desperately tried to hold onto? 

Those calm, serene moments I used to experience around said sweet spot were my time to shine. I would just sit in the safety of my self-constructed castle of misery and liquor bottles and write. Pour my rotten soul out and try turn this pain into something beautiful like all those fucked up poets that touched the souls of so many people through their art. I knew I would never be one of them and that my so-called art would eventually die with me. Insignificant. Like it never existed. 

*Did it, though? Does it? Do I?*

At that stage, I stopped being aware of what was real, but it didn't matter because this has been the only way in my life to actually create something instead of just destroying shit. Destruction has been the foundation of everything I ever knew and there I sat in midst of the ruins of my existence, still wondering why everything I touch kept falling to pieces right in front of my empty eyes, my thousand yard stare resting on this all-encompassing nothingness.

Well, I'm over almost 2 years sober now. Meanwhile.. life is good. I'm good. Happy. Happy?

Sometimes, when I sit on my balcony in the morning to drink my coffee and just watch the birds in silence; I'm so happy about this new-found tranquility that I could literally shed a tear.

And sometimes, just sometimes, when I sit on my balcony in the morning to drink my coffee, I wish it would be this magic 3rd bottle of beer instead because no level of ohm shanti shanti and love and peace and harmony will ever be able to make me feel like that *good ole sweet spot*.",2,1739951702.0,SoberAndHateIt,0,1.0,False

1it07ti,https://www.reddit.com/r/CarnivalCruiseFans/comments/1it07ti/carnival_firenze_in_winter/,Carnival Firenze in winter,"Better late than never. I sailed Carnival Firenze Jan 9th, 2025. It was a 4 day Ensenada cruise with a stop in Catalina and one sea day. I traveled with my (34f) husband (39m), and my 13 year old stepdaughter. No excursion booked. We had a balcony on the 6 aft. 

Prior to the trip we bought Faster To The Fun, the pixel 5 picture package, and a 6 inch cake to be delivered to the room on sail day. 

Embarking: We arrived at the docks at 8am because we are early to everything. Parking was easy, we got up front, the porters were ready for our bags, then we waited around and took pictures. FTTF let us check in with the platinum and diamond guest. 

Dr** dog warning. There are working k9. We were lined up, told to put our stuff we had on us in front of us, and the dogs did their walk. My luggage was hit, I was not smuggling anything in. I do wonder if they hit on my adhd medicine. After a quick and respectful search we went to the waiting area. Once on board we put our stuff outside our room door until rooms were ready (another FTTF perk.) 

We used the hub app to communicate and my daughter was able to add friends she met in kids club so they could talk and arrange meetups. 

We had speciality dining at 555 reservations at 5:30. We picked the first night for the free bottle of wine, but missed the sail away party due to it starting late because people didn’t muster drill. The food was resplendent even for my two picky eaters. Most the day and night was spent exploring the ship. 

Oh the cake? It was delivered and waiting when we first came in the room. The chocolate cake was rich but not too rich. 6 inches is a lot of cake for 3 people. We gave the rest to the drunk neighbors fighting in the hall hoping it would stop the yelling and keep the peace. The more sober of the young gentlemen was very appreciative. The screaming continued, the cake was thrown all over the hall walls and floor, and there was and angry mom who was whisper-yelling at her boys who took the drink package too hard night one to clean it up or else sometime around 2am. 10/10 best $15 entertainment ever. (They were cousins or brother fighting because one bet against the other in the casino, I’m assuming craps.)

Day 2- Used room service as a wake up call with coffee, cocoa,  and pastries. Catalina island. FTTF tender perk didn’t matter much because we were in line bright and early and everyone was sleeping in. The island is small, walkable, and shops slowly open. By 11/12 most shops, bars and eateries were open. We walked around, shopped, and enjoyed a tall can on the beach before going back to the ship for lunch. Lido deck pizza is amazing and I still dream of it, but the tacos were good too. We played games with friends, my fam enjoyed the slides and splash pad, explored the ship more, watched the amazing masquerade and captains toast, and then headed to supper in the mdr. It took 2 hours to complete the meal which is a little long for me, but the food was great. I had the prime rib, next time I’d skip the sauce which was terrible. The strawberry chia seed soup was a surprising favorite. Late night we clubbed while the 13 year old met up with friends. It got stuffy but the vibe was amazing.

Day three- Ensenada was beautiful from the balcony pulling into port. Debarking was quick. The photography op people are a lot less forgiving about personal cameras here. We walked past the fish market and down a few blocks to the main shopping street. We had a blast haggling, ate some of the best tacos ever from a stand, had some wild shots at Papas & Beer, and I got my nose pierced at a very clean shop. Back on the ship we watched pier runners, did the ropes course a ton, went to supper in the mdr, and then went to deal or no deal. Super fun to interact. If you’re a person who likes to yell and participate I recommend you sit front next to the big button. You become a little team with the guest on stage. The water was choppy for the rest of the trip and that the moment I hit the dance floor a wave of nausea took over. Cold water on my wrists and some Dramamine helped me make it back to the cabin to sleep. 

Day 4- I went to breakfast with the fam in the mdr and had 12 hour French toast (now discontinued) and I could already tell that 5 days of insomnia, cruise bacteria, and overstimulation was hitting me all at once. I slept the day away while my family enjoyed some daddy-daughter time doing the ropes course, mini golf, and they even made it onto the kids vs parent show. I made it out to the mdr despite the sea sickness, the main course was placed in front of me and I saw green. I excused my sea-sick self for the rest of the evening. At least I got everyone to try frog legs. 

Day five- debarking- with FTTF we were off the boat and in the car by 8 am. We chose to carry our luggage off to not deal with finding our luggage. They had pastries, coffee, and juice while we waited. Seamless, fast, and traffic was a non-issue. 

My biggest complaints would be 
There’s no way to password protect purchases. You can set spending limits but not passwords or codes for spending. We watched our spending account like hawks and 3 times we were charged for drinks we didn’t order. A quick trip to guest services refunded each one, but still a pain they don’t verify signers or id for purchase in any way. 

The elevators. You need to push the floor number you’re going to for every person. So 3 people going to deck 10, push 10 thrice. People ignoring this or not knowing meant the elevator couldn’t do elevator math like it was built to do for the most efficient running. 

For my first cruise ever I feel like 4 days was great. Long enough to feel like a mini vacation not a weekend getaway, short enough that if I hated it I wouldn’t have to suffer a long itinerary. We will be booking Firenze again for this June. Meanwhile, I have 8 days until I sail on Radiance.

Let me start with one of the, in my opinion, best Zombie Novels ever!!!

""Day by Day: Armageddon"" by American Author J.L. Bourne is a Novel first released in 2004, and the first Part of a Trilogy of Novels (technically quadrology, since there is also a Short Story that works as a sort of Spin-Off to the story).
We follow an unnamed Protagonist who decided on January first to write a Diary. But than news about a suspicious Virus with possible origins in China forces the World into a global Lockdown.

We as readers than experience the story through the entries of said diary.
This also.means that some days are described shorter, some are longer and more detailed.

The really interesting thing about this is that the physical copies are also designed like an actual Diary, meaning there are crossed out lines, coffee and blood stains on the pages, documents we find along the way are ""pinned"" in the diary.

I first came across this story during one of the earliest Lockdowns of the Covid Pandemic and therefore was super horrified hearing about a Zombie stories with a Virus of possible Chinese origins that was published 16 years before Covid-19.

Definitely a 10/10 read.",1,1739951464.0,thewalkingdeadcomic,0,1.0,False
1it06hy,https://www.reddit.com/r/redscarepod/comments/1it06hy/please_dont_tell_my_mother/,Please don’t tell my mother,"My stale mind is disgusting and boring and an imposition to me, so I feel that I must dish upon you this weight that I’m too feeble to bear myself. I ‘need to talk’ — when I say that I hear echoes of Henry Francis mocking Betty for ‘needing’ a drink i.e. grow up, shut up, be continent — because I just realised that I’m deeply scared that nobody would come to my funeral if I wait much longer to die.

I feel this, and question myself before I’ve even felt it through. Would it be a bad thing if I had nobody to remember or miss me? It happens to us all eventually. Just shades, degrees between all who have ever lived and myself. I’m really struggling with my self-esteem, in every aspect. I can’t sleep. I’m listening to country music. I never understood the “everything but country” types. I wish I could feel country music. Wishing drives me mad. Earlier today, I wished there was someplace holy, truly holy to me, that I could yearn to visit. Part of how ignoble and flat my life feels to me right now is a result of my absolute lack of belief in anything. I have no conviction. Persuasion, slights of rhetoric, are always at hand to dissuade me. Nothing seems worthy even to feign faith in. 

What is good? What is bad? I want the chance to learn it all again, to relish in the discovery of it all for the first time. Is it real? Is it true? What does it mean? Is belief a choice? Do we perform it? Do we only perform it when we are faced with an act that requires belief or an act that demonstrates our disbelief? Perhaps no belief really exists until it is tested. I want ever more extraordinary leaps of faith, to really hold my hand to the flame or my proverbial son to the proverbial slaughter. It’s never enough.  I’m scared that I only ever act on earthly knowledge, that of experience, things seen, so believed. Pattern recognition, the lesser risk, even when I want to lose it all just to want to keep it. 

I want to floss my brain, as in go between the plaques and kinks of all this grey that I feel less and less in control of. I’m thinking about almost everything that I have ever perceived to have happened. I just want to feel better, but I’m suspicious of even that pursuit. I find it repulsive when I try to soothe myself with hopes I once had for a life worth savouring. I second guess. Why is it bad to feel the way that I am feeling? Yes it’s childishly contrarian to ask ‘why’ every evil is evil, and to question whether everything good is an illusion. There is no North Star to tie it all together, no meaning at all. Perhaps I could surrender, or wake up to take my perspective for granted and express the narcissism I sense doubtless roars in me. 

I wish I had something I wanted to do, right now, that I could divorce from my hunger for recognition. Why should I be recognised, remembered, I over any other? I used to think that the way out is by doing something, anything, but all I can muster is my 9-5 and the most pressing chore. Should I kill myself, or make a cup of coffee? I’ve made a coffee today, and had it with no delight. 

Of course I have all the time in the world to wallow in self-consciousness and anger. I don’t know what to do now, next, ever. I’m not good enough, finished enough, to die yet; I can’t live without the terror of sensing that I never will be. 

Why do I delay in ending it? I’m gambling my days in the hopes that I can turn it around, that I’ll feel - one day, even if for the briefest moment - that I’ve justified myself. I will make my worst fear come true, and crystallise my irrelevance, as soon as I go. But the longer I wait, the more banal it gets, the more ordinary and typical my death. There’ll be more that could’ve done but did not do. The more time passes, the more sporadic my achievement in comparison. Self-denial feels like nothing. Drugs do not penetrate. There is no confession left to make. 

Some would say my life is just about to turn around and change beyond recognition. I’m on the precipice of having my foot firmly in the door of security (how I wish I was rather on the verge of Making It). Yet this too alienates me. The cymbals are crashing, announcing the end of an Age which I barely experienced in my haze of self-hatred, all the while understanding and learning nothing from it in my naked egotism. I spent too long aspiring for greatness, significance, consequence (or, failing that, to know all about it). All I know now is that I fall laughably short. I never even tried, I still don’t know how, and I haven’t even come to understand why all that is what I want. How grotesque, how plain, how fucking stupid of me. 

It doesn’t help that I’m a woman. It infuriates me that incels complain that women have inherent value while men have to prove their worth. I fight like a dog to feel worthy and yet nothing’s ever paid (translation: I’ve never had reason to externalise my misplaced sense of exception or superiority…).

I had some academic success, some flashes of insight, once upon a time. Better still, I’ve been told that a boy had a crush on me once. We were children, 11 years old or so, and I had no idea. I wish I’d felt it — I’d take having been the object of childish shyness, now beyond all hope of a teenage dream or a mutual first love. He’s made his mark on our time (he’s online, discussed in print, and his work has infected discourse even here - [this part of me is all woman, saying things that lend me intrigue I haven’t earned myself]). He, with so much in common with me, who looks so much like I do. I envy him.

I dream about all consuming love sometimes, one where I’m fixated upon. I want to hope that someone might make me a playlist someday, or won’t be able to sleep because they’re anxious to please me, attract me, catch me before I slip away. I want someone to yearn with as much futility as I have, to hate with my same zeal the feelings that obsession engenders, only to succumb anyway. I fear that I’ll always want to compete, to out-do even my beloved, just so I know that there may be even better somewhere, that whatever it is isn’t It, that there’s more to me. Me, me, me. Why can’t I just be nice if I can’t be worthy? Why can’t I be lovely, warm, open, hopeful, devoted, loved because I’m average and unexceptional and not in spite of it? I’m not nice at all. I want to spurn someone, perhaps one man who would see a ‘pilgrim soul’ in me, this transience, this restlessness, and who’d love me anyway. In turn I would intentionally destroy it, him, me.

Perhaps somewhere along the way I might yet have my head flushed in a toilet or be spat on. That slime on this surface would prove that I was here, I elicited more than indifference. 

Sometimes I think motherhood will prove to be the best thing I ever do, and then I think of the children. Will I pass on the unnerving genetics I’ve discovered in more and more of my family as I’ve met them? I feel like everything about me, and these other freaks who are my blood, scream that there’s something very, very wrong at hand. Say they evade that twisted inheritance. Will I envy them then for their possibility, and pity them for their impending assimilation into this void I sense all around me?

Spare me the appeal to ‘do something for someone else for once’ — I do, habitually, ostensibly seeking nothing except to make the friction go away between me and whoever it is that needs something, or would feel better with something that I can do for them. It pains me that I feel this friction. I loathe myself when I recognize that I do in fact have my hand out as I give. I’m looking for unconditionality in my relationships, perhaps because I’m so incapable of it myself that it feels like a gift that I would like to deserve. So I feel around for the condition in the dark, whatever boundary which will make the truth of whatever relationship apparent to me. How much can they take? How much can I take? I’ve come close to destroying my relationship a few times, and backed out at the very last chance every time for two appalling reasons: 1. I was displeased with how unsurprised my boyfriend appeared with the prospect, and 2. because I haven’t been beautiful or brutal enough for it to be the love of his life/BPD/manic pixie/ and as such would fade from his life without tension. Too easy, as I am with everything. Too accommodating, never demanding what I want to demand, never having learned how to be so pathetic. I just want to be worth something to him, and to know it without doubt. That is my undoing. Things of value simply are. 

Maybe all I need is fun, something to take my breath away. I can’t remember the last time I felt that. I cannot imagine it, so it can’t be real. I’m not going to kill myself, but I’m burdened by the fact that this means I never should. The time for killing myself is up. All that is left is to endure, perhaps even accept. There’s something consoling about my mediocrity being so common. Perhaps I am less alone than the giants I’ve longed to resemble. They tread paths never before traversed, all by themselves in glorious distinction. I’m not made of that stuff, I can’t be, or I’d know it by now, right? I have company, I am not alone.

3 or so years ago I started noticing a weird pressure behind my lower right rib. It would come and go but stayed pretty constant. I had went from a bad american diet to a clean primal diet a year or so before so thought it was just gas or something from my diet.

The pressure has always been there since, sometimes i might not notice it for a day or so but pretty much has been constant.

The last year ive been having alot of stomach issues, stomach pains, loose but regular stool, stomach gurgling, stomach making weird high pitched noises. Also been having joint pains that ive never had before.

Ive tried gluten free diets, keto, primal, carnivore.... I still eat pretty clean. I only drink water and coffee mostly yet the constant pressure and discomfort is there, right under my right rib. Ive started taking L Reuteri probiotics to see if it would help because the discomfort seems more noticeable lately and sometimes is a dull ache feeling. 

Im now wondering if it could be gallbladder stones so ordered some stone breaker tabs from amazon that seem to have miracle reviews, and plan to try a gallbladder cleanse.

Sadly I dont have health insurance or I would of went to the dr by now. I make pretty good money but the insurance offered is horrible.

Chapter 1

Life Stages of Psilocybe subaeruginosa & Ideal Conditions for Each Stage (Accelerated Timeline)

1. Spore Germination (0–7 days)

Substrate: Nutrient-rich agar or grain (e.g., brown rice flour, rye, or liquid culture).

Temperature: 20–24°C (68–75°F) for rapid germination.

Humidity: High (~90%).

Oxygen: Limited; minimal fresh air exchange (FAE).

Light: Dark or very dim indirect light.


2. Mycelial Colonization (2–6 weeks)

Substrate: Wood-based material (hardwood chips, sawdust, or mulch).

Temperature: 20–24°C (68–75°F) for optimal mycelial growth.

Humidity: 80–90% to prevent substrate drying.

Oxygen: Low; minimal fresh air exchange to promote colonization.

Light: Not required, but indirect exposure may help signal development.


3. Pre-Fruiting (3–7 days, post-colonization)

Substrate: Fully colonized wood chips/mulch.

Temperature: Gradually lower to 10–15°C (50–59°F).

Humidity: 90%+; maintain high moisture in the substrate.

Oxygen: Increase fresh air exchange (FAE) to signal fruiting.

Light: 12-hour light/dark cycle with indirect daylight or low-intensity LEDs.

Trigger: Simulate rain event (heavy misting or watering) before cold shock.


4. Fruiting Initiation (Triggered by cold shock + moisture)

Substrate: Moist, fully colonized wood chips.

Temperature: Cold shock (4–10°C / 39–50°F) for 24–72 hours.

Humidity: 90–95%, preventing drying out.

Oxygen: High; frequent fresh air exchange (e.g., open-air or slight airflow).

Light: Indirect natural light (e.g., shade or LED grow lights).

Trigger: Rain event first, followed by a cold snap or frost.


5. Fruiting & Maturation (7–21 days)

Temperature: 10–15°C (50–59°F).

Humidity: 85–95%; misting as needed.

Oxygen: High; good fresh air exchange is critical to prevent contamination.

Light: Indirect daylight or cool white LED (~12 hours/day).

Substrate: Keep moist but not waterlogged.


6. Spore Release & Lifecycle Reset

Mushrooms mature and drop spores onto the substrate, restarting the cycle.

Harvest before full spore release for peak potency.


Optimized Timeline

Colonization: 2–6 weeks

Pre-Fruiting: 3–7 days (down from 8–12 weeks)

Fruiting & Maturation: 7–21 days


By simulating rain, cold shock, and fresh air exchange earlier, fruiting can be significantly accelerated compared to natural outdoor conditions.



Chapter 2
Optimal Substrate Mix for Psilocybe subaeruginosa

This mix closely mimics the mushroom's natural environment while optimizing for indoor or controlled cultivation.

Best Substrate Formula (by volume)

1. 50% Hardwood Chips – Eucalyptus, pine, beech, or oak (aged & partially decomposed preferred)


2. 30% Hardwood Sawdust – Fine sawdust for better mycelial spread


3. 10% Shredded Straw or Pine Needles – Provides structure and aeration


4. 5–10% Gypsum & Bran Mix – Enhances nutrients and mycelial strength

Gypsum (~5%) (Calcium sulfate) – Improves mycelium health

Bran (~5%) (Wheat or oat) – Optional nutrient boost but increases contamination risk




Preparation Steps:

1. Pasteurize the substrate (65–80°C for 1–2 hours) to eliminate contaminants.


2. Drain & cool before inoculating with fully colonized grain spawn.


3. Layer or mix spawn into the substrate for even colonization.



Alternative Additions (Optional)

Alder chips – Excellent for long-term fruiting beds.

Maple or willow bark – Adds variety to lignin sources.


This mix provides ideal water retention, aeration, and nutrition while supporting strong mycelial growth and reliable fruiting.

Freshly chipped wood contains:

1. Natural antifungal compounds (e.g., tannins, resins, lignin inhibitors) – These chemicals protect trees but can slow or inhibit fungal colonization.


2. Competing bacteria & mold spores – Fresh wood supports high bacterial and mold activity, which can outcompete mushroom mycelium.


3. Excess moisture from fresh cuts – Woodchips fresh from a chipper may trap water, leading to anaerobic conditions and contamination.



Aging allows: ✔ Breakdown of antifungal compounds (makes wood more accessible to mycelium).
✔ Development of beneficial fungi & bacteria (which help suppress contaminants).
✔ Better moisture balance (aged chips absorb and hold water more effectively).

🔹 How Long to Age Woodchips?

🔹 Best Practices for Aging Woodchips

1. Pile the Woodchips in a Shaded, Damp Area

Avoid direct sun to prevent excessive drying.

Keep them in a loose, well-ventilated mound (not compacted).



2. Soak the Chips Every 2–4 Weeks

Moisture helps speed up decomposition and breaks down antifungal compounds.

If natural rain isn’t enough, hose them down occasionally.



3. Mix in Some Older Woodchips or Soil

This introduces beneficial fungi and bacteria to kickstart decomposition.

Woodchips that have already been colonized by mycelium will work even better.



4. Check for Signs of Proper Aging

Smell: Should have a mild earthy or forest-like scent (not sour or rotten).

Color: Should darken slightly and feel softer compared to fresh wood.

Fungal Activity: Some white or blue-green fungal growth may appear (this is good!).





---

🔹 Alternative Methods to Speed Up Aging

If you need to use fresh woodchips sooner, you can: ✅ Partially Pasteurize Them – Heat to 65–80°C (149–176°F) for 1–2 hours to kill contaminants but leave useful microbes intact.
✅ Ferment the Chips in Water – Soaking them in water for 2–4 weeks breaks down antifungal compounds faster.
✅ Compost for 1–2 Months – Mix woodchips with nitrogen-rich material (e.g., straw or coffee grounds) to accelerate decomposition.

How to Pasteurize Substrate for Psilocybe subaeruginosa Cultivation

Pasteurization is the process of heating the substrate to 65–80°C (149–176°F) for 1–2 hours to eliminate most contaminants while keeping beneficial microbes intact. This is better than full sterilization for wood-based substrates, as it reduces contamination risk without making the substrate overly vulnerable.


---

Pasteurization Methods

1. Hot Water Bath Method (Best for Large Batches)

What You Need:

A large pot, drum, or cooler

Thermometer (must stay within 65–80°C)

A mesh bag (e.g., pillowcase) to hold substrate

A weight (brick, stone) to keep the substrate submerged


Steps:

1. Fill a large pot or insulated container with hot water (70–80°C / 158–176°F).


2. Place the substrate (hardwood chips, sawdust, straw, etc.) in a mesh bag or pillowcase.


3. Submerge the bag completely in the hot water, using a weight to keep it down.


4. Keep the temperature steady at 65–80°C for 60–90 minutes.

DO NOT exceed 80°C, or beneficial microbes will be killed.



5. Remove the bag and let it drain and cool to room temperature before inoculation.




---

2. Steam Pasteurization (Best for Indoor Setup)

What You Need:

A large pot with a lid

A metal rack or steamer basket

Water (to generate steam)

Thermometer


Steps:

1. Place a small rack or steamer basket inside a large pot.


2. Add water to the bottom (not touching the substrate).


3. Place the substrate in a breathable bag (pillowcase or nylon mesh bag) on top of the rack.


4. Cover the pot and bring the water to a simmer (~70°C).


5. Let the steam heat the substrate for 90 minutes at 65–80°C.


6. Allow the substrate to cool to room temperature before inoculating.




---

3. Oven Pasteurization (Best for Sawdust or Small Batches)

What You Need:

A large oven-safe bag or covered tray

Thermometer

Oven


Steps:

1. Preheat oven to 80°C (176°F).


2. Spread moist substrate in an oven bag or deep baking tray.


3. Cover with foil or oven-safe plastic wrap to retain moisture.


4. Heat for 90 minutes at 65–80°C.


5. Let it cool completely before use.




---

After Pasteurization:

Drain excess water (substrate should be damp, not dripping).

Cool to room temperature before inoculation.

Use immediately or within a few days to prevent contamination.


---

When You Do Not Need to Pasteurize

✅ If using hardwood chips or aged mulch

P. subaeruginosa thrives on partially decomposed hardwood chips.

The natural microbial balance in aged wood helps suppress contamination.


✅ If growing outdoors

Outdoor conditions provide fresh air exchange (FAE), reducing the risk of anaerobic contamination.

Natural competitors like beneficial fungi and bacteria prevent mold outbreaks.


✅ If using properly aged & decomposed wood

Aged, pre-colonized woodchips already contain beneficial microbes, making pasteurization unnecessary.



---

When Pasteurization Is Recommended

⚠ If growing indoors

Indoor environments trap contaminants, making pasteurization useful for reducing mold risk.


⚠ If using a mix with grain, straw, or manure

If you’re adding straw, coir, bran, or other organic materials, pasteurization helps eliminate competing fungi & bacteria.

Wood alone is low in nutrients, but non-woody additions introduce contamination risks.


⚠ If using fresh (un-aged) woodchips

Freshly chipped wood may contain molds, bacteria, or competing fungi that can outcompete P. subaeruginosa.

If you must use fresh chips, pasteurizing (65–80°C for 1–2 hours) reduces contamination risks.



---

Best Approach: Aging vs. Pasteurization

Instead of pasteurizing, you can simply age your wood substrate by:

1. Letting hardwood chips sit outside for 2–3 months in a shaded, damp environment.


2. Periodically soaking them in water to encourage microbial breakdown.


3. Using chips that have already started decomposing—these naturally favor P. subaeruginosa.




---

Final Verdict

Outdoor grow? → No pasteurization needed.

Indoor grow? → Pasteurization helps reduce contamination risks.

Fresh woodchips? → Pasteurization is recommended unless aged properly.

Using straw, bran, or non-woody additives? → Pasteurize to avoid contamination.




Chapter 3
How to Spawn Psilocybe subaeruginosa Mycelium to Bulk Substrate

Once your wood-based substrate has been pasteurized and cooled, it’s time to spawn the mycelium. This involves mixing fully colonized grain spawn into the bulk substrate to allow the mycelium to take over.


---

Step 1: Prepare Your Spawn

✅ Grain Spawn Options:

Best: Rye, millet, or wild bird seed

Alternative: Brown rice, whole oats, or popcorn

Colonization Time: 2–4 weeks at 20–24°C (68–75°F)


Your grain spawn should be fully white with mycelium before use.


---

Step 2: Layer or Mix Spawn with Bulk Substrate

✅ Ideal Bulk Substrate:

50% Hardwood chips (Eucalyptus, pine, oak, or beech)

30% Hardwood sawdust (Fine particles for fast colonization)

10% Straw or pine needles (For aeration)

5–10% Gypsum & Bran mix (Optional for nutrient boost)


Methods of Spawning:

1. Layering Method (Preferred for Outdoors or Large Beds)

Add a thin layer of substrate to your container or grow bed.

Sprinkle a thin layer of grain spawn evenly on top.

Repeat the layers until all spawn and substrate are used.

Finish with a final top layer of substrate to protect mycelium.



2. Mixing Method (Faster for Colonization)

Mix grain spawn evenly into the bulk substrate.

Ensure mycelium is distributed throughout for faster takeover.

Gently press down the substrate to remove large air pockets.





---

Step 3: Incubation & Colonization

✅ Ideal Conditions for Mycelium Growth:

Temperature: 20–24°C (68–75°F)

Humidity: 80–90%

Airflow: Minimal fresh air exchange (to avoid contamination)

Light: Darkness or very dim indirect light


✅ Time Required:

Colonization of substrate: 2–6 weeks

Check weekly; if the substrate turns fully white, it's ready for fruiting.



---

Step 4: Preparing for Fruiting (Triggering Pinning)

✅ When the substrate is fully colonized, initiate fruiting:

1. Simulate rain by misting heavily for 1–3 days.


2. Cold shock: Lower temperature to 4–10°C (39–50°F) for 24–72 hours.


3. Increase fresh air exchange (open vents, mist lightly).


4. Provide indirect light (12 hours/day).



✅ Fruiting Conditions:

Temperature: 10–15°C (50–59°F)

Humidity: 90–95%

Fresh Air Exchange (FAE): High

Time to Mushrooms: Pins appear within 7–14 days



---

Step 5: Harvest & Maintenance

✅ Harvest Timing:

When caps begin to flatten but before spore release.

Twist and pull gently to avoid disturbing the substrate.


✅ After First Flush:

Mist substrate lightly to maintain humidity.

Wait 7–14 days for a second flush.

Can produce multiple flushes over several months.



---

Final Notes

Patience is key: Fruiting takes longer than Psilocybe cubensis but produces potent mushrooms.

Avoid overwatering: Mushrooms need high humidity but not waterlogged conditions.

Maintain airflow: Prevents contamination and encourages fruiting.




Chapter 4

Step-by-Step Guide to Setting Up an Outdoor P. subaeruginosa Woodchip Bed

1. Select the Perfect Location

✅ Find a sheltered, shaded area (forests, under trees, near logs).
✅ Flat or slightly sloped terrain prevents excessive runoff.
✅ Moist but well-draining soil—avoid areas that stay waterlogged.


---

2. Prepare the Base Layer (Cardboard)

✅ Lay down a thick layer of corrugated cardboard (2+ layers).
✅ This acts as a weed barrier and helps retain moisture.
✅ Pre-soak the cardboard for better decomposition & easier colonization.


---

3. Build the Mushroom Bed (Substrate + Spawn)

✅ Substrate Mix (by volume):

70% Hardwood chips (aged eucalyptus, pine, beech, or oak)

20% Hardwood sawdust (fine particles for fast mycelial spread)

10% Straw or pine needles (optional for aeration & structure)


✅ Spawn Mixing:

Use fully colonized grain spawn (rye, millet, or wild bird seed).

Mix spawn evenly throughout the woodchips rather than layering—this speeds up colonization.

If using stem butts or live mycelium, mix them in the top 5 cm (2 inches) of the bed.


✅ Mound Formation:

Pile the substrate & spawn mixture into a mound (15–30 cm / 6–12 inches high).

Taper the edges to prevent drying and wind exposure.



---

4. Top Layer for Protection (Cardboard & Mulch Cover)

✅ Cover the mound with another layer of wet cardboard to:

Prevent drying out.

Block contamination (competing fungi or mold).

Keep it dark, allowing the mycelium to establish.


✅ Optionally, add a thin layer of pine needles or wood mulch over the top cardboard for extra protection.


---

5. Watering & Moisture Management

✅ Initial Soaking:

Wet down the entire bed until at field capacity (moist but not pooling water).

Let excess water drain before sealing with top cardboard.


✅ Ongoing Maintenance:

Check moisture weekly and water if needed, especially in hot or dry weather.

The goal is consistently moist but never soaking wet.



---

6. Fruiting Trigger (Winter Prep)

✅ When winter arrives (first frost or temperature drop to ~10°C / 50°F):

Remove the top layer of cardboard to allow fresh air exposure.

Ensure the bed stays humid but gets fresh air.

If rainfall is low, lightly mist or water to simulate seasonal rains.

Mushrooms should start pinning within 2–4 weeks of consistent cold exposure.



---

Estimated Timeline

✅ Once the mycelium fully colonizes the woodchips, the bed can keep producing for multiple years if maintained with occasional fresh woodchip additions.


---

Final Tweaks for Maximum Success

✔ Use aged hardwood chips for faster colonization.
✔ Avoid overwatering—slightly drier is better than overly wet.
✔ Expect bigger flushes each year as the mycelium matures.
✔ Optionally, cover the bed with a thin pine needle mulch in summer to prevent drying.



Chapter 5
How to Expand and Sustain a Psilocybe subaeruginosa Woodchip Bed for Years

Once your Psilocybe subaeruginosa bed starts producing, you can extend its lifespan indefinitely by periodically adding fresh woodchips and expanding the colonized area. This keeps the mycelium healthy, prevents substrate depletion, and ensures massive flushes year after year.


---

1. Annual Woodchip Renewal (Top-Dressing Method)

✅ Why?

P. subaeruginosa consumes the wood over time.

Adding fresh woodchips replenishes nutrients and extends the bed’s lifespan.


✅ How?

Every autumn or early winter, before fruiting starts:

1. Remove any old, decomposed woodchips (but leave mycelium intact).


2. Layer 2–4 cm (1–2 inches) of fresh hardwood chips over the bed.


3. Mist or lightly water to keep the mycelium hydrated.




✅ Best Wood Types for Renewal:

Aged eucalyptus, pine, oak, beech, alder, or mixed hardwood mulch.

Avoid: Freshly cut chips with strong resins (can slow colonization).



---

2. Expanding the Bed (Mycelium Leapfrog Method)

✅ Why?

Mycelium naturally spreads outward over time.

You can intentionally expand the bed by adding fresh substrate nearby.


✅ How?

1. Choose an adjacent area (1–2 meters away) and lay down new wet cardboard.


2. Mix a fresh batch of woodchips & sawdust (same ratio as the original bed).


3. Take chunks of mycelium from the original bed and mix them into the new area.


4. Cover with a light layer of mulch or straw to protect it.


5. Keep it moist and let the mycelium spread naturally.



✅ Timing:

Start expanding after the first fruiting season (spring).

By next winter, the expanded area should be ready to fruit.



---

3. Creating Satellite Beds (Natural Spread)

✅ How?

Once your mushrooms start producing, collect spore-laden woodchips from mature flushes.

Scatter these chips in new locations (ideally under trees, in shaded mulched areas).

Over time, new colonies will form naturally.


✅ Bonus Tip:

If you have access to a chainsaw or woodchipper, you can create custom aged woodchips by chipping small logs and aging them before adding them to the beds.



---

4. Using Stem Butts to Start New Beds

✅ Why?

Instead of relying on grain spawn, you can clone your existing mushrooms using stem butts.


✅ How?

1. Take the base of a fresh mushroom (stem butt with mycelium).


2. Place it between layers of wet cardboard for 1–2 weeks.


3. Once mycelium spreads, transfer the colonized cardboard to fresh woodchips or mulch.


4. Keep it moist, and the mycelium will establish a new colony.



✅ Best Time to Do This:

Immediately after harvesting a flush (fall to winter).



---

5. Protecting the Bed in Off-Seasons

✅ Spring & Summer Protection:

Cover with a thin mulch of pine needles or straw to prevent drying.

Water lightly during long dry spells (but avoid overwatering).


✅ Winter Fruiting Management:

Once the first frost hits, remove excess debris to allow fresh air exchange.

Keep an eye out for early pinning and mist lightly if conditions are dry.



---

Long-Term Maintenance Schedule


---

Final Thoughts

By adding woodchips every year, your P. subaeruginosa bed can last indefinitely.

Expanding the bed naturally (with leapfrogging or satellite beds) increases long-term yield.

Using stem butts or spores helps spread mushrooms to new areas, ensuring sustainable growth.




Chapter 6
Optimal Grain Spawn Amount
✅ Recommended spawn-to-substrate ratio: 1:10 to 1:5 (grain spawn : bulk substrate)
✅ For 1 cubic yard (≈200L) of wood chips:
Minimum spawn: 5–10 liters (≈2.5–5 kg or 5–10 quarts) of millet seed grain
Faster colonization: 20 liters (≈10 kg or 20 quarts) of grain spawn
✅ Breakdown by ratio:
Spawn-to-Substrate Ratio
Millet Spawn Needed
Colonization Speed
1:10 (Slowest, but works)
5 liters (5 quarts / ~2.5 kg)
2–4 months
1:7 (Balanced, efficient)
7–10 liters (7–10 quarts / ~3.5–5 kg)
1.5–3 months
1:5 (Fastest colonization)
15–20 liters (15–20 quarts / ~7.5–10 kg)
1–2 months


Best Approach for Large-Scale Colonization
Start with a smaller ""Mother Bed""
Instead of dumping all your grain spawn into the cubic yard at once, start by colonizing 20–40 liters (5–10 gallons) of wood chips in a separate container.
Once it’s fully colonized, use that as “spawn” to inoculate the full cubic yard (this reduces grain spawn waste and risk of contamination).
Layer the grain spawn evenly
Instead of dumping it all on top, mix it throughout the substrate in layers (spawn → wood chips → spawn → wood chips).
The top 10 cm (4 inches) should have less spawn to reduce contamination risk from open air exposure.
Keep it moist, but not soaked
Aged wood chips should be field capacity moist—squeeze a handful and it should be damp but not dripping.
Mist or lightly water if the bed dries out.
Check after 4–6 weeks
If the bed is partially colonized but slow, mix in another round of fresh spawn to boost mycelial growth.

Final Answer

For 1 cubic yard (≈200 liters) of aged wood chips, you need:

5–10 liters (5–10 quarts) of millet spawn for slow colonization (2–4 months).

10–15 liters (10–15 quarts) for balanced colonization (1.5–3 months).

15–20 liters (15–20 quarts) for rapid colonization (1–2 months).



Chapter 7
Growing Psilocybe subaeruginosa Indoors in Artificial Conditions

While Psilocybe subaeruginosa is naturally an outdoor wood-loving species, it can be cultivated indoors under controlled conditions. However, indoor growth requires replicating the cool, humid, and lignin-rich environment that P. subaeruginosa thrives in. This chapter will cover the best methods for growing this species indoors, including substrate preparation, fruiting chamber setup, and troubleshooting.

1. Challenges of Indoor Cultivation
Before attempting indoor cultivation, it’s important to understand the main challenges: ✅ P. subaeruginosa prefers wood-based substrates, not grain or compost.
✅ It requires cold temperatures (~10–15°C) to fruit, unlike P. cubensis which thrives at room temperature.
✅ Slower colonization & fruiting times (can take months instead of weeks).
✅ High humidity & fresh air exchange (FAE) are crucial to avoid contamination and ensure proper pinning.




---

2. Choosing the Right Growing Method
The best indoor methods for P. subaeruginosa mimic outdoor conditions as closely as possible. Here are the two most effective setups:
✅ Method 1: Indoor Fruiting Chamber (Best for Small Batches)
✅ Method 2: Modified Greenhouse or Tent Setup (Best for Large-Scale)




---

3. Preparing the Indoor Substrate
Unlike P. cubensis, which grows well on grain-based substrates, P. subaeruginosa requires a wood-based substrate. The following mix is optimized for indoor colonization and fruiting.
Indoor Bulk Substrate Recipe
✅ Pasteurization is recommended (65–80°C for 1–2 hours) to kill off contaminants.
✅ Moisture content: The substrate should be field capacity moist—it should release a few drops of water when squeezed but not be dripping.




---

4. Inoculating & Colonizing the Substrate
✅ Step 1: Prepare Spawn
Use millet, rye, or wild bird seed spawn colonized with P. subaeruginosa mycelium.
Grain spawn should be fully white and healthy before use.
✅ Step 2: Mix Spawn with Substrate
Use a 1:5 spawn-to-substrate ratio for efficient colonization.
Mix evenly in a container, making sure the mycelium is distributed throughout.
✅ Step 3: Colonization Conditions
Temperature: 20–24°C (68–75°F)
Humidity: 80–90%
Light: Darkness or very dim indirect light
Fresh Air Exchange (FAE): Minimal (too much air exchange can introduce contaminants)
✅ Time to Full Colonization: 4–8 weeks
Once the substrate is fully colonized, it’s time to initiate fruiting.




---

5. Setting Up an Indoor Fruiting Chamber
To replicate the cool, humid conditions needed for fruiting, use a monotub, humidity-controlled tent, or automated fruiting chamber.
✅ Fruiting Chamber Setup (Monotub or Tent) | Parameter | Ideal Range | |------------|------------| | Temperature | 10–15°C (50–59°F) | | Humidity | 90–95% | | Fresh Air Exchange (FAE) | Moderate to high (ventilation required) | | Light Cycle | 12 hours indirect light, 12 hours dark |
How to Trigger Fruiting
Cold Shock: Lower temp to 4–10°C (39–50°F) for 24–72 hours.
Simulate Rain: Mist the substrate lightly for 2–3 days.
Increase FAE: Open vents or use small fans on a low setting.
Provide Indirect Light: Use LEDs or ambient daylight (not direct sunlight).
Pins should start forming 7–21 days after cold shock, depending on conditions.




---

6. Harvesting & Maintaining the Fruiting Chamber
✅ Harvesting:
Pick mushrooms when the caps begin to flatten but before they release spores.
Twist and pull gently to avoid damaging the substrate.
✅ Maintaining for Multiple Flushes:
Lightly mist after each flush to retain moisture.
Wait 7–14 days for the next flush.
The substrate can continue producing for 2–5 flushes before needing replenishment.




---

7. Troubleshooting Common Issues




---

8. Thoughts on Indoor Cultivation
✅ Growing P. subaeruginosa indoors requires more patience than P. cubensis but can be done successfully with the right conditions.
✅ A monotub or modified tent setup can effectively replicate cool, humid, and well-ventilated outdoor conditions.
✅ If conditions are maintained properly, an indoor bed can produce multiple flushes over several months.


Chapter 8
Complete List of Psilocybe subaeruginosa Pinning Triggers

To initiate primordia (pin) formation, P. subaeruginosa requires a combination of environmental changes that mimic its natural outdoor fruiting conditions in autumn.

🌡️ 1. Cold Shock (Most Critical)

✅ Temperature Drop to 4–10°C (39–50°F) for 24–72 hours

Mimics seasonal shifts where P. subaeruginosa begins fruiting after the first frost.

Sudden temperature drops signal mycelium to switch from vegetative growth to reproductive mode.

How to Trigger:

Lower temperature in a fruiting chamber or move outdoor beds to a cold location.

After cold shock, maintain temperatures at 10–15°C (50–59°F) for sustained fruiting.




---

💦 2. Increased Humidity (~90–95%)

✅ Mycelium must experience sustained high humidity to form primordia.

Moisture keeps the mycelium hydrated and encourages knot formation.

How to Trigger:

Maintain 90–95% humidity using misting or humidifiers.

A casing layer (pine needles, straw, coir) can help retain moisture.




---

🌬️ 3. Fresh Air Exchange (FAE)

✅ High CO₂ during colonization → Drop in CO₂ signals pinning

P. subaeruginosa requires a shift from stagnant air (colonization) to fresh air (fruiting).

How to Trigger:

Increase fresh air exchange (4–6 air exchanges per day) by opening vents or using a low-speed fan.

Remove excess CO₂ that built up during colonization.




---

🌧️ 4. Simulated Rain Event

✅ Heavy misting for 2–3 days before cold shock mimics autumn rainfall.

P. subaeruginosa fruits heavily after rain in the wild.

How to Trigger:

Mist the substrate heavily for 2–3 days before cold shocking.

Avoid over-saturation—field capacity moisture is best.




---

💨 5. Evaporation of Surface Moisture (Microdroplets)

✅ Daily evaporation cycles help signal primordia formation.

P. subaeruginosa detects subtle moisture loss as a sign of changing weather conditions.

How to Trigger:

Lightly mist 2–3 times daily, ensuring microdroplets form on the mycelium.

Allow droplets to fully evaporate before misting again.

Use gentle airflow to assist evaporation without drying out the substrate.




---

☀️ 6. Indirect Light Exposure

✅ A 12-hour light/dark cycle helps initiate pinning.

While not as critical as temperature or humidity, light acts as a secondary signal for fruiting.

How to Trigger:

Use soft, indirect light (ambient daylight or LED grow lights).

12/12 light cycle (12 hours light, 12 hours dark).




---

🦠 7. Nutrient Depletion in Substrate

✅ Fruiting occurs when mycelium senses a drop in available nutrients.

Mycelium ""knows"" when it's time to reproduce and spread spores if the substrate is fully colonized and nutrients start running low.

How to Trigger:

Ensure substrate is 100% colonized before fruiting conditions are introduced.

Avoid adding excessive nutrients before primordia formation.




---

🔹 Summary of Pinning Triggers


---

🚀 Pro Tips for Faster Pinning

✅ Combine all pinning triggers together for best results—apply cold shock, increase FAE, maintain humidity, and regulate misting cycles.
✅ If pins don’t appear within 14 days, slightly increase FAE and lower temperature by 1–2°C.
✅ Be patient—P. subaeruginosa takes longer to pin than P. cubensis.

I was driving, but if you asked me how I did it, I wouldn’t be able to tell you—I don’t remember. When I arrived, my mother and sister were waiting for me. I walked straight to my room, feeling my soul splintering even more. His things were still here.

It was Tuesday. Three days had passed since everything fell apart. Three days without food, without sleep, without anything. My mind was consumed by thoughts of him, and no matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t stop thinking about how we met.

It all started on Wednesday, August 17th 2022, the same day I began a new job. By some strange twist of luck, fate, or pure coincidence, it was also the day we matched on a dating app. From the very first message, our conversation flowed effortlessly, as if we had known each other for years. We spent hours talking, and by Friday, August 19, I mentioned that I was leaving work early. He offered to give me a ride home, and I agreed, suggesting we meet at a coffee shop.

I chose that place because I love coffee, and it felt like a safe spot for an impromptu first date. I remember arriving, nerves creeping in as I messaged a friend, telling her I wasn’t dressed for a date and had no idea how to act. To calm myself, I ordered an iced coffee and found amusement in how they misspelled my name. I tried to focus on my Kindle, but my anxiety made it impossible to concentrate.

And then he arrived. The first thing that caught my attention was his eyes—the most beautiful eyes I had ever seen. I was so nervous that, without thinking, I offered him my coffee. He smiled and accepted, which made me laugh. In that moment, I knew—I had fallen in love at first sight.

We didn’t stay long at the coffee shop. Instead, we wandered around downtown Walnut Creek, with no real destination, assuming he would eventually drop me off near my house.

But somehow, our date ended in Sacramento that night. Was it reckless to leave with a stranger? Absolutely. Would I recommend it? Not at all. But do I regret it? Not for a second.

We walked through Old Sacramento, had dinner, and rode the Ferris wheel. In a burst of courage—or maybe foolishness—I kissed him. I wanted to know if it was just the adrenaline of the moment or if there was something real between us. To this day, I still feel the same way.

We got back to my house around one in the morning, and saying goodbye was so difficult that we simply said, see you later. And we did—because the very next day, we saw each other again. We spent the entire weekend together. From that Friday on, we were inseparable.

I I won’t pretend that everything was perfect. Like any couple, we had our struggles. But until a month ago, everything changed. Before we chose to stay together, now our paths are diverging. I don’t know if it was fate, coincidence, or sheer luck that brought us together that day, but that was our beginning. Now, I don’t know how to face the end.",1,1739950461.0,u_Real-Scar3599,0,1.0,False

Funny thing is, I remember the process of drunkenly writing these wannabe-bukowski-style posts as if it's been yesterday - it's always been my favorite time and activity of the day; always following the same pattern. 

The Fear would jerk me awake early mornings before sunrise and I would start the day by cursing God for having the audacity to do this shit to me again (that not letting me finally die in my sleep shit to be specific). 
The beat of my racing heart echoing in my eardrums, panic gripping my throat and choking off my breath while those familiar full body tremors loosen it's grip just enough so that I'm able to quickly grab the vodka bottle besides my bed without either suffocating or vomiting all over the damn place. 

I can still feel the burn in my throat if I close my eyes and focus hard enough, but the one sensation that feels so distant - as if those years of crippling decay have merely been a sick sad fever dream - is this distinct warmth that starts to spread from your stomach through every last cell in your body, cradling you in it's holy embrace like the hurt, little child you truly are deep on the inside. Telling you it's gonna be alright, that there's no need to be scared any longer.

*Rest my child, you're home now.*

Of course we know that a single swig from the bottle won't get the job done, but it will sure make your lizard brain crave this feeling of sweet liberation to the point of giving you the superhuman strength needed to heave those heavy bones out of bed. Those poor, ancient bones carrying the weight of the whole world in their marrow. Carrying you to the fridge on wobbly legs while your fingertips are tracing the wall beside you since you know you will lose balance. Your whole life has been a progressive loss of balance. 

Focussing your blurry vision on the floor in front of you while trying to maneuver your rigid body through the piles of trash without collision. Like the damn titanic, you were bound to sink the moment you decided to take up this journey, lured by delusion and promises of sweet nothingness. Listening to the sirens while sinking deeep deeep down towards rockbottom, but there won't be anything glorious about it; nothing worth writing a movie about. 

No orchestra playing, no beauty in the tragedy, no drawings of French girls. 

Just the old 80s radio in your head, playing the same damn jazz songs on repeat once you cross that WD threshold. And filth. Maybe some rotten French fries you attempted to shove down your raw throat after you went another 3 days without eating before becoming aware of the fact that the electrolyte imbalance slowly taking over your weak body will kill you if you don't order some fucking McDonald's with your next liquor delivery.

You open the fridge and grab that beer, begging your numb fingers not to let it drop. Don't let it drop. It's glass. DON'T FUCKING LET IT DROP GOD DAMN IT YOU USELESS PIECE OF SHIT I'M BEGGING YOU YOU NEED IT AND THERE WILL BE GLASS SHARDS EVERYWHERE. 

Glass shards like the ones that line the inside of my skin every morning, crunching against eachother and tearing me apart from the inside as soon as my ribcage expands upon taking in that first, painful concious breath. Glass shards like the ones my heart is made of. It shattered a long time ago and I tried to fix it and put it back together and make it pretty and as whole as it used to be but that's all it is - a fragile construction that cuts the fingertips of everyone that tries to touch it, a subtle smile on my face everytime I see them jerk back in shock once it draws blood. Better leave now my dear - you haven't seen shit. Try touch my soul and it'll fucking make you bleed dry before you can say your last prayer.

Well, they always say *the cracks is how the light shines in* but I never asked for no fucking light, I don't want to see or be seen. I just want to sit here in this eternal darkness that has been following me like a fucking reverse halo ever since I entered this godforsaken shithole of a world and weep and drink and hurt and cause hurt and blood to be shed until this darkness finally decides to embrace me as a whole and take me home. *I'm fucking begging you, I never belonged here in first place.*

..not once in my CA carreer have I dropped that first morning beer though. Funny how the survival instinct still functions even after years of attempting to drown those last brain cells enabling you to *somehow* exist in this world. Those trembling, sad excuses of hands would even manage to pop the lid with a lighter every damn time. Chairs to a decade of muscle memory due to daily exercise I guess, I can still recall feeling like the sickest fuck walking planet earth when this older skater boy I had a crush on taught me this highly valuable skill at the age of 14. Good ole times.

I would always chugg the first beers in record time while chain smoking cigarettes until I felt the muscles in my body slowly start to relax while the grip on my cigarette simultaneously tightened to the point of me not dropping it into my lap every 5 seconds (always a funny game trying to pick up a lit ciggie before it burns the 383th hole into your grimy pants with fingers feeling like raw hotdog-sausages). 

But once I hit this sweet spot about half an hour after waking up? This sweet spot where the brain fog starts to subside but you're not yet drunk enough to reach the oblivious stage where those grey cells completely shut off again? This sweet spot between withdrawals and stupor where everything is just OK and there are no more worries and no pain and you wish this moment would just be there forever before it slips through your fingers with the next sip like literally everything beautiful you ever desperately tried to hold onto? 

Those calm, serene moments I used to experience around said sweet spot were my time to shine. I would just sit in the safety of my self-constructed castle of misery and liquor bottles and write. Pour my rotten soul out and try turn this pain into something beautiful like all those fucked up poets that touched the souls of so many people through their art. I knew I would never be one of them and that my so-called art would eventually die with me. Insignificant. Like it never existed. 

*Did it, though? Does it? Do I?*

At that stage, I stopped being aware of what was real, but it didn't matter because this has been the only way in my life to actually create something instead of just destroying shit. Destruction has been the foundation of everything I ever knew and there I sat in midst of the ruins of my existence, still wondering why everything I touch kept falling to pieces right in front of my empty eyes, my thousand yard stare resting on this all-encompassing nothingness.

I always felt he was into me (he is divorced) but I pretended I don't see, as I was married. But he is a guy I have very much in common and now that I am divorced fully I thought I might hit him up.

The thing is, on February 15 or 16 he posted a IG story. I didn't see it because I usually don't watch anyone's stories. But now it bothers me. Just because he posted a story in proximity of Valentines, it means it MUST have been something related to a relationship? He doesn't post stories  very often, rather not regularly.

My friend (another friend) said it doesn't have to be related to anything special, as guy rarely do it anyway. and I should just hit him up.

It's been a month into fall. It has been a while since I've wrote, since it was summer time last time. But I'm here again.

And I have a big update on my life.

I'm married to Harvey.

Yeah, I can't believe it either. But I've never felt happier. Oh the future is bright. Just like how his eyes were on our wedding day. I even made the wedding dress myself. The way it swayed and twirled was as if the dress itself was swooning. 

People congratulated us. Even Marnie did. I was surprised, since she's close to Shane, but she must've understood what the situation was since I've briefly spoke about it with her. 

It was magicial. 

Every other morning I'm woken up with the smell of food, like it was a melody flowing through the air. I attempted to make Harvey coffee for him as a way of saying how much I appreciate for him to do something like this for me. But even he says he doesn't mind it. 

I have to admit, I'm not used to this. Someone caring for me this much. Making me breakfast, offering massages even and giving me small advice for the colder months. 

Sometimes he had to leave, but I didn't mind it. I visit him when I could as I worked on the farm. He was good with the kids. I didn't expect him to adjust to it so well. 

He's the right one for me after all.

I was also surprised to see him so worried for me after I came back to the mines, since winter was coming soon I needed to make as much money as possible. 

I often came back home with a few good scratches and wounds, some slime soaking through my clothes. And he took care of it for me, though while he did he was rambling about how worried he was, sighed then forgave me as he placed his lips on mine and set me to bed. 

But I don't think he can fix my sleep schedule. Which I'm fine with.

As time went on it felt almost stress-free, other than the anxiety everything falling apart again. Harvey often reassured me of that and most of the time, it helped. When it didn't, well, he made me food. 

I love him. And he loves me, too. He showed it. If it wasn't through words it was actions. 

For example, last night as I'm writing this, he made a fancy dinner for me by the fireplace. I think it was a certain pasta recipe with clams? I don't quite remember what it was, but it did taste heavenly. He looked so proud of himself and so happy, it made my heart swell. I'm happy it wasn't too late to be with him

After we finished, he insisted on washing the dishes. I felt bad that he had to do so much. I didn't want him to think that I didn't care. But he said he didn't mind it. 

Oh Yoba, this doctor has my stomach turning into knots and butterflies nipping at my insides. Good thing he's a doctor I suppose.",1,1739949935.0,StardewValley,0,1.0,False

It keeps us connected, entertained, and informed. But just like the real world, it has its dangers. Scammers, hackers, and data thieves are lurking, waiting for an opportunity. The good news? You can take simple steps to protect yourself and browse with confidence.

# 1. Lock Down Your Passwords

Think of your password as the key to your house. Would you use a flimsy key that anyone could duplicate? Nope. Use a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols, and never reuse passwords across multiple sites. A password manager can help keep things organized so you don’t have to remember them all.

# 2. Turn on Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

Imagine locking your door and adding a deadbolt—that’s what 2FA does for your online accounts. Even if someone steals your password, they’d still need a second verification step (like a code sent to your phone) to break in.

# 3. Think Before You Click

Phishing scams are getting sneakier. If you get an email that seems fishy (pun intended), double-check the sender’s address before clicking on anything. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.

# 4. Keep Your Tech Updated

You know those annoying software update notifications? They’re actually your best friend. Updates patch security holes that hackers exploit, so don’t ignore them—install them ASAP!

# 5. Watch Out for Public Wi-Fi

Free Wi-Fi at coffee shops and airports is super convenient, but it’s also an open invitation for hackers. Avoid logging into sensitive accounts on public networks, or use a VPN to encrypt your connection.

# 6. Be Careful of What You Share

Do you really need to post your location or personal details on social media? Oversharing can make you a target for identity theft or cyberstalking. Adjust your privacy settings and think twice before posting.

# 7. Check for Secure Websites

When shopping or entering sensitive info, look for ""https://"" in the URL (the ""s"" stands for secure). A little padlock icon next to the address bar is a good sign too.

# 8. Stay Informed and Stay Sharp

Cybercriminals are always coming up with new tricks. Stay ahead by keeping up with the latest security trends and educating yourself about online threats.

# Final Thoughts

The internet is an incredible tool, but it’s up to you to use it wisely. By taking these steps, you can enjoy all the benefits of the digital world without putting yourself at risk. Stay smart, stay secure, and happy browsing!

They don’t care what my friends advocate for and just won’t cooperate unless they have to.,"I blame Multnomah County for the increase we have experienced in property crime.  It is the County that has reduced its jail capacity by half over the last 20 years.  It is the County that does not staff even its paltry number of jail spaces to maximum capacity (there are currently 500 empty jail beds unstaffed at the jail).  It is the County that provides half of the funding to the DA’s office that currently brings forward fewer charging instruments per capita than any other district attorney in the state.  And it is the County that could even help fund defense lawyers to help reduce the back log in cases yet to be tried and place more Sheriff’s Deputies out in the community to augment the work of City Police.

I am tired of trying to micromanage county officials.  They don’t care what my friends advocate for and just won’t cooperate unless they have to.  Although it is likely not the role of the voters to micromanage their elected leaders, it is their right to expect outcomes and accountability.

County officials feign empathy when they hear of rampant crime but they are not willing to address what should be the primary function of government – to protect society.  The only way to make those who do not believe in addressing crime through appropriate policing, prosecution and consequences take action is to make our problems their problems.  That is what my Crime Victim Compensation proposal is designed to do.

[https://www.oregonlive.com/crime/2024/02/how-bad-is-downtown-portland-for-business-one-shop-owner-dealing-with-shoplifting-threats-knows-exactly-how-bad.html](https://www.oregonlive.com/crime/2024/02/how-bad-is-downtown-portland-for-business-one-shop-owner-dealing-with-shoplifting-threats-knows-exactly-how-bad.html)

This article highlights the people I want to help. The Accountability for Property Crime Initiative and Crime Victims Compensation Fund would help this fellow right away and place tremendous pressure on elected officials to reopen and expand jail space and others involved in the criminal justice system to get tougher on prosecuting property crime lest they lose funding.

If you or I are the victim of a car break-in, we are horribly inconvenienced.  But if a person who cleans offices for a living gets his car stolen, or if a person who works for minimum wage at a coffee shop loses her bicycle, the impact can be devastating.  Likewise, the shopkeeper who has to constantly address broken windows won’t be in business for long.

Here is what my proposal would do:

1. It would be a county charter amendment so it would take precedence over all other county ordinances and could not be changed without a vote of the people.
2. It would require the County to be the insurer for those who are victims of crime in Multnomah County and require payment of claims within 60 days up to a total of $2500.00 per occurrence until FBI crime statistics return to pre-pandemic levels.
3. It would require the County to create a crime victim’s compensation office and provide and evaluate claim forms similar to what a commercial insurer would require.
4. It would give claimants the same rights as those who file claims with commercial insurance companies have.
5. It would incentivize the County to pursue criminals to recover the payouts made to victims.
6. It would prohibit the County from raising taxes to finance the program which would practically require the county to cut other budgets in order to make due.

I believe the measure [would pass handily](https://multco.us/info/notice-initiative-multcoinit-13) because it would finally result in the County doing something to help the everyday citizen who is brave enough to live, work and do business in Multnomah County.  It would likely incent the county to reopen and expand its jail space and would also encourage prosecution of property crimes so criminals wouldn’t commit so many repeat crimes while awaiting trial.

It would initially threaten other county programs.  But which of us can really identify a county program that primarily benefits those who follow the rules, pay taxes and contribute to society?  So what if budgets for the Joint Office are cut and if funds that are currently wasted on the hundreds of non-profit organizations that are part of the homeless industrial complex are diminished?    At least money directed to the Crime Victim’s Compensation Fund will benefit the people we should really be supporting.  And at least the government will be telling those willing to take a chance on Portland’s recovery that we have their back.  And who knows?  Maybe insurance companies might be willing to reenter these markets knowing that the county will cover the first $2500 of each loss?

1iszqzo,https://www.reddit.com/r/PVCs/comments/1iszqzo/first_time_in_8_months_going_36_hours_without_a/,First time in 8 months going 36 hours without a PVC,"TLDR; The factors I think helped were as followed: I moved, I started taking a different brand of magnesium(from Pure to Qunol), and started taking nutritional yeast which has thiamin and folate, two supplements I hadn't been taking before. I think moving had the biggest impact though.

It's a really wild feeling. Maybe I did something right? I hope my story helps someone figure it out.

I think my PVCs came on due to environmental reasons. Things like changing my oil or painting my house would bring them on in the past. More recently I had PVCs after coming home from vacation. About a week or two later I started feeling them daily and I believed it was due to my hvac system. I stopped using the hvac and I didn't have pvcs for a week. What a glorious week that was. I couldn't just stop using my ac and heat forever, so I turned it back on to test the hypothesis and, yup, they came back, but this time, they didn't just go away when the AC was turned off.

I thought it could be a coolant leak. I thought it could be mold, so I hired hvac guys and mold guys. All of them said nothing was wrong. I even cleaned the AC coil.

You know how it is. When you're in this position you look at every variable and I tested other variables to get them to stop. I stopped drinking coffee and that did help significantly reduce the severity of the PVCs, but they didn't go away entirely. 

Nothing else was working. I was running my air purifiers, using the stove for my heat, etc, I knew I had to move.  I finally moved in late November and after a few weeks my eye stopped twitching (my left eye would randomly twitch starting with the PVCs). The PVCs were definitely lighter after moving, but it was hard to tell because I kept getting sick. When I'd get sick they either went away entirely or they were more persistent... light, but more persistent.

For maybe a month and a half now I've had warm sensations go through my arms. The doctors I talked to didn't think anything of it. As long as I'm not numb or tingly they didn't care. But about a week ago I was in the grocery store having PVCs and as I went up to stand in line I had a PVC, and immediately after I had that warm sensation. The sensation immediately shooed the feeling away... and I stopped having them for an hour or two afterwards. I have no idea why that is, but it was definitely a minor miracle for me.

The night before last I had to wake up super early so I only got 3.5 hours of sleep. By midday I realized I've had 0 PVCs. By the time I went to bed I was so excited and happy thinking I'd still had 0 PVCs. I don't want to jinx it, but I'm super excited about it.  So far so good. Today I still haven't had any.

Besides moving the following things have also changed recently.

Magnesium, I'd been taking magnesium for several months prior to my PVC onset. So I don't think switching brands did anything. The warm sensations were coming before I took a different brand of magneisum.

Nutritional yeast has definitely done something to me, but I'm not sure if it's doing something for the PVCs. Again, I started taking it weeks after I first noticed the warm sensations. I started taking it maybe 2 weeks ago, perhaps even less. I think I started taking it because I saw something about it for 
helping alleviate POTS symptoms. It couldn't hurt because I was lacking in thiamin and folate anyway. My first dose I ate a full tablespoon on a very empty stomach and within minutes I was almost doubled over in pain. It felt like my diaphragm was seizing up or something. My BP went to 90/140 and I had to sit down for a while. It went away after 5-10 minutes, but kind of a scary event.

I'm new to home espresso, and am looking to buy my first grinder! Whichever I buy, it would be paired with a used Bambino Plus that I just bought. Considering sk40 or df54, but open to other options if there's anything I've missed while researching in the price range. (Df64 and niche are a bit too high in price for me, but the 54 could work).

\- I'm in the US, max budget of around $300.   
\- I'd mainly be using the grinder for espresso, but would consider using it for french press, or maybe even drip coffee.  
\- I think I would prefer a shot with more body versus clarity (so, the conical sk40 is better maybe?), but I haven't tried them side by side so that's a guess lol.   
\- I also prefer drinks with plenty of cream (breve is my style), but I'm interested in plain shots too.   
\- And, I'd be single dosing, especially because I don't tend to go through coffee all that quickly at the moment. Even my freshest beans currently are about two months past the roast date, but since my espresso palate isn't developed, that might not make a huge deal to me lol.

Watch the video tutorial below:

[https://youtu.be/a2nTxH5KlA8](https://youtu.be/a2nTxH5KlA8) 

I was shocked when I tested Grok 3 against the ""best"" AI models on the market. What I discovered will change how you run your business forever.

Most entrepreneurs waste thousands on multiple AI subscriptions that do half the job. I've found the one tool that does it all - and it costs less than your weekly coffee budget.

# How Grok 3 Outperforms Every Other AI (Even ChatGPT)

When I first logged into Grok 3, I was skeptical. Another AI tool making big promises? But within minutes, I was building fully-functional games, cloning websites, and creating 100% human-passing content.

Here's what blew my mind: Grok 3's reasoning model outperforms every competitor by a massive margin. The data doesn't lie - it's crushing O3 Mini, O1, DeepSeek R1, and even Gemini 2 in math, science, and coding capabilities.

And it's only $16/month.

If you want to save hundreds of hours automating your business with AI strategies that actually work, check out my[ AI Profit Boardroom](https://go.juliangoldie.com/ai-profit-boardroom). We're building a community of entrepreneurs who are scaling their businesses with cutting-edge AI automation.

# Building Games From Scratch (With Zero Coding Experience)

The first test I ran was building a Flappy Bird clone. I have zero coding experience, but within minutes, Grok 3 generated complete HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.

The result? A fully-functional game with:

* Flying bird controlled by spacebar
* Moving obstacles
* Collision detection
* Scoring system

This wasn't just impressive - it was mind-blowing. The game worked perfectly on the first try.

# Cloning Websites In One Click

Next, I challenged Grok 3 to clone my website from a single screenshot.

The results were instant. It generated perfect HTML and CSS code that matched my original site almost exactly. This process would typically take a developer days and cost hundreds of dollars.

I did this with one prompt and zero technical skills.

If you're struggling with technical website challenges, I can help.[ Book a free SEO strategy session](https://go.juliangoldie.com/strategy-session) and I'll show you how to optimize your site for maximum traffic and conversions.

# Creating Undetectable AI Content That Converts

The most impressive test? Creating SEO-optimized content that passes as 100% human-written.

I gave Grok 3 a simple prompt (which you can get in my[ AI Profit Boardroom](https://www.skool.com/ai-profit-lab-7462/about)), and it generated a 1,000-word article that:

1. Reads naturally and conversationally
2. Scores 0% on AI detection tools
3. Includes strategic calls-to-action
4. Funnels readers to my landing pages

This content wasn't just ""good enough"" - it was better than what most professional writers deliver.

# Grok's Deep Research Feature (Better Than ChatGPT's)

ChatGPT charges $200/month for their deep research feature that takes 30 minutes to load.

Grok 3 includes a superior version in their $16/month package.

I tested it by asking for mind-blowing facts about Grok 3. Within seconds (not 30 minutes), it delivered fascinating insights:

* Grok 3 was trained on synthetic data
* It used the Colossus supercomputer (200,000+ GPUs)
* It can create entirely new game concepts on the spot
* ""Super Grok"" is coming soon with voice capabilities

This research feature alone is worth the subscription price.

# Image Generation That Beats DALL-E 3

I tested Grok 3's image generation against ChatGPT's DALL-E 3.

The difference was shocking. Grok produced ultra-realistic images instantly, while DALL-E 3 created cartoonish, unusable graphics.

Even more impressive - Grok can generate images of public figures and characters that other AI tools refuse to create.

These images are blog-ready and professional enough for marketing materials.

# Building Custom AI Tools Inside Grok

The final test pushed Grok 3 to its limits. Could it build a custom calculator tool?

With a single prompt, it generated a complete SEO cost calculator with:

* Custom interface
* Pop-up functionality
* Navigation menu
* Call-to-action
* Social media links

This tool worked perfectly from the first load. No debugging needed.

In my[ AI Profit Boardroom](https://go.juliangoldie.com/ai-profit-boardroom), I share dozens of prompts for building custom tools like this. These AI automation strategies have helped my clients save hundreds of hours and generate thousands in additional revenue.

# Quality Control Is Essential

One thing I've learned from testing dozens of AI tools is that quality control makes all the difference.

1iszj5x,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1iszj5x/i_think_someones_watching_me_outside_my_window/,I think someone’s watching me outside my window: Update 2,"Sorry for the late update, everyone, but last night was by far the scariest night I have ever experienced. Like last time, I will start from the beginning. 

Before I start, thank everyone who commented on how I should protect myself. 

For weapons, my boyfriend Anthony has an old shotgun from his grandfather. The downside is that I have never shot one before and can’t find any of my boyfriend’s shells. But I do have a metal softball bat! I did order a security camera on Amazon; they should come in tomorrow afternoon. 
I closed all my house curtains so no one could see inside. 

Here’s Todays update. The night I noticed the man in my yard, I called the police, and the officers came to my house. They looked around but didn’t see anything out of the ordinary. It’s been snowing in Utah, and they said if anyone were watching me, there would prints in the snow. They consoled me and said everything was alright and I was probably imagining things. One officer said, “You’re probably just feeling lonely and paranoid and seeing things that aren’t there.” 

I felt so dumb for even calling them. They didn’t find anything, which made me feel crazy. I really thought I saw someone. The last thing they told me was to call them if anything else happened, and they would get out to me when they could. Some help they were. 

I woke up this morning feeling unrested. I tossed and turned all night, and I couldn’t get to sleep. I just felt this sense of unease, like someone was standing outside my bedroom window. I hate feeling like this in my own home. 

Work was even worse. I work at a local coffee shop, and I just couldn’t focus. My whole shift, I just felt like I would see that man again. Anytime someone walked in with a hood on, it made my heart race. I messed up orders all day, giving people the wrong coffee or overcharging customers. My manager had to pull me off the register and have me just take inventory in the back. It was just one of those work days that you just want to go home and cry. 

When I got home around 7 p.m., all I could think about was taking a hot shower and curling up in bed. And that’s where it all started. While I was washing my hair, I heard a faint knocking. I jumped a bit but figured it was just my A/c kicking on. It always makes a loud knocking sound.

Then I heard it again. I paused and listened closer, and that’s when it happened. The sound became louder and more rapid. Someone was banging on my door so hard I thought it was going to bust down. I was so scared I almost fell out of the shower. I jumped out, threw on my robe, and grabbed my bat. 

Tears running down my face, I pressed up against my door and said, “LEAVE ME ALONE. I HAVE A GUN, AND I WILL USE IT!” But they just kept banging and kicking my door. 

Now I know what you all are going to say: I should have called the police right away. Unfortunately, I wasn’t thinking straight, and everything was happening so fast. Out of panic, I called the one person in the world who always kept me safe: Anthony. 

The phone dialed, and all I was thinking was, ""Pick up, pick up, pick up."" But there was no answer, but something strange did happen. In all the panic, for a split second, I thought I heard my boyfriend’s ringtone through the door…. But as soon as I heard it, his phone went to voicemail. Then, all of a sudden, the banging had stopped.

I was in hysterical and in tears. I thought that man would have busted my door and done god knows what to me. I called the police, and they came as soon as they could. They did the same thing, looked around, asked the neighbors if they saw anything, and looked for any clue on who it could have been. But nothing, just like the night before. They told me again if I was in any physical or immediate danger, to call them first, not my boyfriend. 

I shook my head, too tired and scared to talk anymore. I just wanted this all to be over. There was one thing I couldn’t shake…. Did I really hear my boyfriend’s ringtone? 

It couldn’t be that he was gone for work, and I would’ve noticed his car if he had returned. Could he be pecking me? If he is, that’s fucked, and I don’t think I can stay with someone that can be so cruel. 

I’m freaking out now, guys, and I don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t want to leave my home. Even if this man knows where I live, I still feel safer than if I were staying at a hotel. At least now my neighbors know to keep an eye out. If I were to get a hotel, I would truly be alone. 

It’s late, and I need to sleep. I’ll keep all of you updated if anything else happens.

1iszj2x,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1iszj2x/vent/,Vent,"Hello, 
Literally here for a vent. Last year I locked in hard and did the gastritis diet and after about 4-5 months I really felt healed. I also quit vaping which I know was contributing to it so badly. 

I started re introducing things after about 5 months - coffee, wine, mild curries, burgers, chips (all in moderation) etc and I’ve been totally fine! I’ve been happily eating like that for about 4 months!

Anyway just 2 weeks ago I got a new fitness app with a nutrition aspect to try and lose the 5kg I’ve put on since quitting vaping. I tried some of the recipes, I thought I was “healed” since it’s been so long with no flares and so I just followed their recipes without modification. After only 2 days on this diet I felt DISGUSTING. I started to flare :( it just got worse and worse and I had to completely stop the diet. It was full of whole foods etc but with heaps and heaps of nuts, fruits, apples, brocolli, capsicum , tomatoes etc etc 

I really thought I’d gotten past the gastritis and could eat whatever I want :( now I know that’s not the case and I need to be careful forever. I’ve now been in this flare for like 2 weeks and it’s so exhausting. I’m back doing the gastritis diet but I’m really struggling this time. It’s so so boring and annoying and time consuming and did I mention BORING? 
The bloating is horrible and I feel 5 month pregnant. And the constant pain. URGH.

This is lame.

1iszhek,https://www.reddit.com/r/findomsupportforum/comments/1iszhek/faqs_part_2/,FAQ's Part 2,"**Do I have to look like a supermodel to be successful?**

No! Beautiful, successful Domme's come in all shapes, sizes, and ages. There is a sub just waiting for a Domme that looks like you! Many subs love to worship older, curvy women; some love BBWs and SSBBWs, and these ladies are successful. Other subs love petite ladies, ladies with hairy

armpits, and tall, skinny ladies with gray hair and wrinkles.

**I've been looking for 2 weeks, why haven't I found one yet?**

Have patience; it takes time. Many new Findommes don't find a finsub for weeks or even months. Are you posting consistently on different platforms? Are you being creative with your posts? Are you sharing pictures? Remember, these don't have to be nudes. If you have been told you're not having any luck because you're not pretty enough or that you're just plain ugly, do not believe it. Those people are bullies and liars.

**Do I have to meet my finsub in person?**

No. Most interactions between Findommes and finsubs happen online, sometimes via text and Facetime, but often just by chatting on the platform they met on. An in-person meeting with a finsub is called a cash meet. If you choose to do this, please use common sense and have a safety plan.

Make sure you’ve gotten to know them a little and have built up a level of trust. Meet in a public place during the daytime, have a friend go with you, and if possible, have a male friend go with you and hang out in the background. Have the sub leave first and send you a photo of him at a location a few blocks away before you leave. That way, he won’t see your car and cannot follow you. Agree to an amount of cash he’s to give you beforehand. He can hand it to you in an envelope, or you can visit the ATM together.

**Should I tell my friends and family I’m a Findomme?**

That depends on you and how comfortable you are. Findomme is sex work, and some family members may not be comfortable with that information. I would tell at least one trusted friend.

**Should I charge a tribute for messaging me, and how much?**

Some Dommes require a tribute; it's up to you. Many Dommes do ask for a tribute to speak to avoid time wasters. Many Dommes set their tribute the same as a cup of coffee, about $15, some as high as $50. The average is $25.

**My finsub gave me his credit card, should I use it?**

No! Using a sub's credit card is not a good idea. Your finsub may regret it and report the card stolen and your fraud charges. The card could also be stolen.

**Should I approach a sub first?**

I have approached subs that I’ve noticed liking my posts or pictures; sometimes, they’re just shy. If you message first, don’t expect a tribute. Read their profile first, and ask if they’re into findom or serving a Domme.

**Do I need to file my taxes?**

Please file your taxes. Since rules are different everywhere, I can't give adequate advice, but an experienced accountant will be able to tell you how to file correctly.

**Why did my sub send and then block me?**

It happens, don’t take it personally. Sometimes, subs feel bad for spending money they shouldn’t. Sometimes, they feel guilty because they enjoyed something that society says they shouldn’t. Sometimes, they feel embarrassed because they overspent and didn’t want to ask for it back.",2,1739948419.0,findomsupportforum,0,1.0,False
1iszhb6,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1iszhb6/i_think_someones_watching_me_outside_my_window/,I think someone’s watching me outside my window: Update 2,"Sorry for the late update, everyone, but last night was by far the scariest night I have ever experienced. Like last time, I will start from the beginning. 

Before I start, thank everyone who commented on how I should protect myself. 

For weapons, my boyfriend Anthony has an old shotgun from his grandfather. The downside is that I have never shot one before and can’t find any of my boyfriend’s shells. But I do have a metal softball bat! I did order a security camera on Amazon; they should come in tomorrow afternoon. 
I closed all my house curtains so no one could see inside. 

Here’s Todays update. The night I noticed the man in my yard, I called the police, and the officers came to my house. They looked around but didn’t see anything out of the ordinary. It’s been snowing in Utah, and they said if anyone were watching me, there would prints in the snow. They consoled me and said everything was alright and I was probably imagining things. One officer said, “You’re probably just feeling lonely and paranoid and seeing things that aren’t there.” 

I felt so dumb for even calling them. They didn’t find anything, which made me feel crazy. I really thought I saw someone. The last thing they told me was to call them if anything else happened, and they would get out to me when they could. Some help they were. 

I woke up this morning feeling unrested. I tossed and turned all night, and I couldn’t get to sleep. I just felt this sense of unease, like someone was standing outside my bedroom window. I hate feeling like this in my own home. 

Work was even worse. I work at a local coffee shop, and I just couldn’t focus. My whole shift, I just felt like I would see that man again. Anytime someone walked in with a hood on, it made my heart race. I messed up orders all day, giving people the wrong coffee or overcharging customers. My manager had to pull me off the register and have me just take inventory in the back. It was just one of those work days that you just want to go home and cry. 

When I got home around 7 p.m., all I could think about was taking a hot shower and curling up in bed. And that’s where it all started. While I was washing my hair, I heard a faint knocking. I jumped a bit but figured it was just my A/c kicking on. It always makes a loud knocking sound.

Then I heard it again. I paused and listened closer, and that’s when it happened. The sound became louder and more rapid. Someone was banging on my door so hard I thought it was going to bust down. I was so scared I almost fell out of the shower. I jumped out, threw on my robe, and grabbed my bat. 

Tears running down my face, I pressed up against my door and said, “LEAVE ME ALONE. I HAVE A GUN, AND I WILL USE IT!” But they just kept banging and kicking my door. 

Now I know what you all are going to say: I should have called the police right away. Unfortunately, I wasn’t thinking straight, and everything was happening so fast. Out of panic, I called the one person in the world who always kept me safe: Anthony. 

The phone dialed, and all I was thinking was, ""Pick up, pick up, pick up."" But there was no answer, but something strange did happen. In all the panic, for a split second, I thought I heard my boyfriend’s ringtone through the door…. But as soon as I heard it, his phone went to voicemail. Then, all of a sudden, the banging had stopped.

I was in hysterical and in tears. I thought that man would have busted my door and done god knows what to me. I called the police, and they came as soon as they could. They did the same thing, looked around, asked the neighbors if they saw anything, and looked for any clue on who it could have been. But nothing, just like the night before. They told me again if I was in any physical or immediate danger, to call them first, not my boyfriend. 

I shook my head, too tired and scared to talk anymore. I just wanted this all to be over. There was one thing I couldn’t shake…. Did I really hear my boyfriend’s ringtone? 

It couldn’t be that he was gone for work, and I would’ve noticed his car if he had returned. Could he be pecking me? If he is, that’s fucked, and I don’t think I can stay with someone that can be so cruel. 

I’m freaking out now, guys, and I don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t want to leave my home. Even if this man knows where I live, I still feel safer than if I were staying at a hotel. At least now my neighbors know to keep an eye out. If I were to get a hotel, I would truly be alone.

We chatted a bit, and then he asked if we could exchange pics (we both had faceless profiles). I said that as I was new to the scene, I am a little hesitant. He said ok no problem, and we continued chatting.

Two days ago, at the morning, he messaged and asked if we could meet. I agreed, and he said that we could meet at evening. Initially, he asked if we could go to a coffee shop a little far away, but I requested him to be around my college campus. We don't study in the same college btw- he is a PhD student at a research laboratory located beside my college. 

At noon, I told him that we should exchange pictures now as we are meeting. He replied no need as I was hesitant initially. 

At 6:02 pm, we met outside our campus main gate. He saw me, and suddenly shows me an email and said that an urgent lecture has been scheduled which he has to attend. We just introduced our real names to each other, and a little about our background. And then left at 6:10 pm. He stayed for 8 minutes. 

And he ghosted me ever since. He hasn't blocked me on grindr, and I can see that he is online. But, there is no talk anymore. No message. 

All this has led to my confidence being totally destroyed. Am I that ugly? Am I so unattractive that he literally ran away seeing me? I am 23 years old and never been in a relationship, nor had a bf. To cope up with loneliness, l keep studying and studying as a distraction. But even after all this, at the end of the day, I feel very lonely. Those who see my pics on grindr block or ghost me. I see all the happy couples in the campus, and try to look away but can't all the time. Now only God can help me it seems.

## Key Features to Consider: A​ Deep Dive

Before diving into ⁢a direct bose qc⁤ 45 vs sony wh 1000xm4 showdown, let's outline the key features that define premium noise-canceling ⁤headphones.‍ This will provide a ⁢solid foundation for understanding the nuances of each ​model.

### Noise Cancelling: Silencing the World Around You

The‌ primary reason most‍ people invest in headphones like these is for effective noise ⁣cancellation. Both‍ the ‍Bose QC45 and Sony WH-1000XM4 utilize advanced active noise cancellation (ANC) technology to minimize ⁢distractions. How well do they perform in real-world‍ scenarios?

*   **Bose QC45:** Renowned for its exceptional noise cancelling capabilities, ⁤particularly in the mid-range⁣ frequencies. This makes it⁢ ideal for muting​ office⁤ chatter, ⁢airplane hums, ⁣and general​ background noise. The QC45 excels at‍ creating a consistent and comfortable sonic bubble, allowing you to focus on your audio.
*⁢   **Sony WH-1000XM4:** Offers a more​ adaptable noise ‍cancelling experience. Sony's headphones ‍use a complex algorithm that‌ learns your environment and adjusts the noise cancellation accordingly. While excellent some users find the sony's noise cancellation to⁣ be slightly more susceptible to wind noise than the Bose QC45. Based on ‍user reviews and expert testing,‍ the ‌Sony WH-1000XM4 does⁢ an‍ even⁤ better job of ⁤blocking out noise in‌ certain ​situations [3].

### Sound Quality: Immersing ⁣Yourself in ⁤Audio

Beyond‍ noise ⁢cancellation, sound quality is paramount. How do these headphones stack up in delivering rich, detailed audio?

*   **Bose QC45:** delivers a balanced⁢ and neutral sound signature. This ⁣means that no particular frequency range (bass, mids, or ‌highs) is overly emphasized. ​Listeners seeking⁤ accurate and natural sound reproduction‌ will appreciate the QC45's clarity. While some users find QC45 does not sound amazing, they don't sound bad [2].
*   **Sony WH-1000XM4:** Boasts a ‌more customizable sound profile. The Sony Headphones Connect app allows you to​ fine-tune the⁤ EQ settings to your personal preferences. Out of the box, the XM4 ⁤tends to have‍ a slightly‌ warmer sound signature with a hint of bass emphasis. Many consider Sony offering‍ a slightly better ⁤sound quality, however it depends on personal preferences [2].

### Comfort: Wearing Them for Hours

Comfort is crucial, especially for travel headphones or work from​ home headphones. A poorly designed ⁣pair can become unbearable after extended use.

*   **Bose QC45:** Prioritizes ⁢comfort with​ its lightweight design and​ plush ​earcups. The clamping force is gentle,making them suitable for long listening sessions.The QC45 is lighter (240g compared to 254g) which makes it more comfortable than​ the Sony WH-1000XM4 [1].
*   **Sony WH-1000XM4:** Also comfortable,but ​slightly heavier than ⁤the​ QC45.The earcups are well-padded and provide a secure fit. Some users ⁣may find the XM4's ⁣slightly tighter clamping force more fatiguing over extended periods.

### Battery Life: Powering Your Day

A long-lasting battery‌ is essential ⁤for travel,‍ commuting, or simply avoiding​ interruptions.

* ⁣  **Bose QC45:** Offers up to 24 hours of battery life with noise cancellation enabled. A swift 15-minute charge provides up to 3 hours⁣ of‍ playback.
*  ⁤ **Sony WH-1000XM4:** Provides up ⁢to 30 hours of battery life with noise cancellation enabled, or up to 38 hours with ANC turned off. A⁢ quick 10-minute ‌charge provides up to 5 ‍hours of playback. Sony ‌provides ‍marginally longer battery life than Bose [4].

### Bluetooth⁤ Connectivity: Staying Connected

Reliable Bluetooth connectivity is essential for a seamless listening experience. Both headphones support Bluetooth 5.0 for stable connections.

*   ⁤**Bose QC45:** offers simple and reliable Bluetooth pairing.Supports​ multipoint‍ pairing, allowing you to⁤ connect to two‌ devices together.
*⁢   **Sony WH-1000XM4:** Also features excellent Bluetooth connectivity and ⁣multipoint pairing.Sony's implementation of multipoint is slightly⁣ more ⁣sophisticated, allowing ​for seamless switching between devices.

### Call Quality: Clear Communication

clear call quality is critically ‌important for work calls or staying in touch with loved ones.*   **bose QC45:** Offers decent call quality, with microphones that effectively reduce background noise.
*   **Sony WH-1000XM4:** Generally provides superior call quality, thanks to ​its advanced⁤ microphone array and noise reduction⁢ algorithms.

### Voice Assistant ⁢Integration: ⁣Hands-Free⁢ Control

Voice assistant integration ⁤allows you to control your music, answer calls, and access information hands-free.

*   **Bose QC45:** ​Supports integration with Siri, ⁣Google Assistant, and Alexa.
*  ​ **Sony WH-1000XM4:** Also supports integration with‌ Siri, google Assistant, and⁣ Alexa.

### Other Key features:

*   ‍**Ambient Sound Mode:** Both headphones offer an ambient sound mode (also ⁢known as openness mode) that ​allows you to here ⁤your surroundings without removing the headphones.

1isz43j,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1isz43j/joe_k_part_1/,Joe K - Part 1,"The doorkeeper stood rigid in large coal-black leather boots, protruding like obsidian pillars from a long black coat, over which two giant arms and gloved hands were folded in a gesture as comfortable and relaxed as it was defensive, as if short, thin, weak Joe K could possibly be a threat to this human monolith - if it *was* human. The only anthropic evidence was the hint of two pale cheeks, flashing in and out of the shadow of his large-brimmed black Stetson, a small wart taking up residence on the southside. K could only presume the existence of a mouth hidden somewhere beneath the thick, black facial hair, and eyes hidden behind the large dark sunglasses that were unnecessary to say the least - there wasn't enough light in here for K to even guess at the dimensions of wherever *here* was. He didn't know where he was or how he'd got there. He didn't even know that such a state of affairs should be of some concern. In fact, his only concern was in gaining access to whatever was on the other side of that door. ""May I?""

""It's not your time."" Did the doorkeeper's lips move? K wasn't sure.

""When will it be my time?""

""Maybe in the future."" They moved then, didn't they?

""The future, right... um... could you be more specific?"" K focused his attention on those potential lips as if he was Moses trying to part the Red Sea, but this time the doorkeeper made no reply to K's enquiry, perhaps assuming the question was merely rhetorical... or was it too ambiguously worded? Maybe he should be more specific. ""When...?""

""The future""

""So we can rule out the past then?"" K immediately regretted resorting to sarcasm. He'd had enough experience of dealing with figures of authority to know that sarcasm was the least effective strategy one could employ, but there were no immediate reprisals. The doorkeeper remained as inanimate as ever and, when K began pacing around in the semi-darkness, politely offered him a wooden stool so he could rest his legs while he waited. So he rested his legs and waited.

After some time staring at the increasingly inviting light emanating from the open doorway, K's thoughts turned to the possibility of making a run for it. As big and strong and menacing as the doorkeeper appeared to be, he didn't look particularly fast on his feet. He'd even provided him with a potential weapon, light enough to swing and hard enough to cause his adversary some temporary inconvenience, at least. If he could just get close enough to catch him unawares, it could buy him enough time... ""I wouldn't advise it,"" the doorkeeper interrupted his thoughts. ""Mine is but a humble job, consisting of just one very simple task, but I happen to take it very seriously - as if it were a matter of life and death, you might say... not my life and death, of course. And don't let my physical appearance fool you, my reactions are lot faster than one would presume.""

""If you take it *that* seriously then perhaps you should lock the door. After all, I could just wait for you to fall asleep and...""

""Please refrain from making such vile insinuations. I have never fallen asleep, and I never will. That would be a dereliction of duty... as would closing the door - it must always remain open.""

And so it did. As the hours, days, months and years dragged on and raced by, K and the doorkeeper grew old before each others eyes, until their beard's were grey, their skin was wrinkled and their bones were bent and brittle. K's pleas became more forlorn and ritualistic over time, devoid of any expectation of success. Is it time? No. Is it time? No. All the questions he could think to ask the doorkeeper had been repeated a hundredfold without any variation in the answers, until, nearing death and lying on the floor, his failing eyesight straining into the abyss of his darkening tomb, a question sprang to his mind, as if from the abyss itself.

""How come, in all the years I've been waiting here, no one else has been through that door?""

""That would be a dereliction of duty.""

""You keep saying that, but duty to who?""

""To you, of course,"" said the doorkeeper. ""No one else can go through this door, it is just for you, and you alone.""

""For *me*? How can it exist just for me? That doesn't make sense... unless... this is a dream, isn't it?"" For the first time in all the years K had known him, there was the merest hint of a smile, probably nervous, possibly knowledgeable, encouragingly suggestive, but resistant to any further interpretation, in the twinge of his whiskers. Summoning energy from this revelation, K sat up and echoed the microscopic gesture back at him with explosive amplification. His bones no longer bent, his skin no longer wrinkled, his beard no longer grey, his eyes no longer blind, he was full of renewed energy and leapt to his feet, demanding - ""What does it mean?""

""What does what mean?""

""This dream, you big, ugly, obstinate metaphor. Dreams always mean something, everybody knows that, so what does it mean?

""There's no need to get personal,"" the doorkeeper suddenly got personable. ""And what are you asking me for, anyway? it's your dream. Maybe the door represents freedom and I'm the state imposing its bureaucratic rules on you. I am *the man* after all... too literal? Well, what if the freedom you seek is less political and more philosophical. Maybe I'm the personification of fate or destiny or something. Maybe I represent your cynical predisposition, stubbornly denying you access to the meaning of life, or maybe it's the awful truth that's behind that door and I'm your ego refusing to let you see the meaninglessness of your own existence... too deep? What if it's the door to everything you ever wanted in life - happiness, love, success, and I'm your own fear of failure stopping you from taking a chance because you're such a fucking coward?""

""I'm sorry I asked.""

""Look, maybe there's an allegory here and maybe there isn't. You dreamers are always looking for meaning. Maybe it's beyond that door... or - drum roll... maybe it *is* the door - whoa! big reveal.""

""Or maybe it's whatever I want it to be. Like you said, it's my dream, I can do what I want. If I want you to disappear, I just have to think it."" The doorkeeper disappeared, leaving the entrance unguarded. K walked towards the light, knowing that whatever was on the other side was whatever he wanted to put there, but by the time he got there, all he wanted to do was shut the door. The light beyond was extinguished and total darkness descended over him. From behind the closed door, he heard vague sounds of activity - movement, footsteps, mumbling. He opened his eyes and, in a semi-conscious daze, tried to make sense of what he could hear. It was coming from beyond his bedroom door but, unmistakably, inside his flat. He half-mumbled, half-dribbled some vague enunciation of exclamations and confused thoughts into his pillow.

As his brain swam into the deeper waters of full consciousness, the sounds acquired a more recognisable form. Kitchen cupboards opening, chinaware on the ceramic surface and draining board... was that the fridge? Male voices - ""Is that all you ever think about?""

""I skipped breakfast."" Drawers opening, cutlery, footsteps coming into the lounge, more drawers opening. The day finally dawned on K with the thought that his flat was being robbed.

There was no phone connected in his bedroom and he didn't own a mobile. Should he open his window and shout for help? ""No, 'fire',"" he whispered to himself, remembering that people don't react if you shout for help. How would the robbers react, though - fight or flight? He scanned his room in what he suspected to be a futile search for something to defend himself with. His radio? His bedside lamp? A belt? A hardback book? There wasn't much else around except clothes and more books, on shelves and in piles on the floor. Could he quietly remove some books from a detachable shelf, and use that? He couldn't remember if his shelves even were detachable and it would hardly have done him much good, anyway, there were at least two voices that he could make out, they weren't exactly being very discrete about it. Wait, did they even know he was in here? He decided that the safest thing to do was to hide under the bed, pray to providence that they didn't find him, and wait for them to go away. What did he have to steal anyway, that the insurance wouldn't cover? His books? It seemed unlikely they'd be interested in them?

Just as he was wrapping himself up in his duvet and quietly manoeuvring the human-fabric hybrid onto the floor, the opening of the bedroom door startled him into falling the remaining distance. ""Good morning, sir... What on Earth are you doing? this is no time for fun and games. Hey! come and have a look at this, we've got a right joker here."" The tall, thin, young, black policeman was soon joined by his short, fat, old, white partner and they both laughed at the man lying on his back, by the side of his bed, partially concealed in a duvet, legs in the air and a curious combination of horror, confusion and relief written on his red face. At least he wasn't being robbed. He began to cling desperately to the hope that, whatever the cause of this untimely intrusion into his quiet life, it would probably all be cleared up fairly quickly.

""He looks like a giant insect in distress,"" said the short, fat, old, white policeman, discharging over the bedroom floor several small globules of extra-masticated, extra-mature cheddar. ""That's readers for you, they get all sorts of crazy ideas. Look, there's even *more* books in here, he must have thousands of them.""

""Thousands of books and no computer... that's interesting."" They swapped exaggerated expressions, as if to suggest to a non-existent television audience that the character half of them had already come to suspect, in spite of all the obvious evidence pointing elsewhere, did, after all, fit the profile.

""What's this all about?"" K assumed was a reasonable question to ask, as causally as he could manage, while de-quilting and standing up. So casual, it turned out, that he was completely ignored. He observed the policemen examining his books, paying particular attention to the covers and occasionally flicking through the pages, as he slipped on a pair of blue jeans and a grey t-shirt. The tall, thin, young, black policeman had a neck so long and thin that it even managed to look out of place on *his* torso, giving him the appearance of a child's bendy rubber toy. His bulging fisheyes were another aspect of his appearance that contrasted with his partner's, whose own eyes were so tiny and deep-set as to be almost hidden. Their uniforms, although standard attire, were a size too large and a size too small, as if in a Keystonesque concession towards homogeneity. They each wore a body-cam on their chests and a taser in their belts. Cautiously, and with due respect, K tried again - ""Excuse me, gentlemen, but could you tell me what this is all about, please?""

""Not our job, sir,"" said the short, fat, old, white policeman.

""Not our job, sir,"" said the tall, thin, young, black policeman.

""Well, what is your job?"" K blurted out, from behind his poorly constructed facade of civility. Suddenly they were both defensively and suspiciously staring at him, their hands resting on their tasers. ""Sorry, sorry... I don't mean to rude, gentlemen, I realise what your job title is, you don't have to remind me, it's just... I mean... in this particular instance... what...uh... is your job?""

""This is, sir,"" said the tall, thin, black policeman, holding up a book to emphasise the point.

""This is, sir,"" said the short, fat, white policeman, holding up another book to re-emphasise the same point. ""Look, we don't come around to your workplace, disturbing you, do we? What is your job, anyway, a fucking librarian?""

""I'm a cleaner. My name is Joe K. I can show you my identification.""

Entering his lounge was like walking onto a recently deserted battlefield, his books the dead soldiers of a brutal civil war between fiction and non-fiction. He half-expected to see Abraham Lincoln stood on the coffee table delivering the Gutenberg Address. Resisting the urge to help the wounded, he retrieved his Clean Knows ID from the sideboard and returned to the bedroom, where he proudly presented it to the police officers, as if it would magically put their minds, and manners, at ease. They both gave it a cursory glance and handed it back without a word. ""And may I be so bold as to ask you gentlemen to reciprocate?""

""Recipe cake?"" said the tall, thin, young, black policeman, his focus on something that had caught his attention in *The Savage Detectives*.

""A cleaner who reads,"" said the short, fat, old, white policeman, shaking his head at the I've-seen-it-all-now sheer absurdity of such a concept.

""Could you show me some identification, please? I believe it's within my rights."" They rolled their contrasting eyes and reluctantly complied with the request. The tall, thin, young, black policeman was Inspector Wire and the short, fat, old, white policeman was Inspector Womble. K thought he was finally taking a step in the right direction and was hoping to continue proceedings in a spirit of mutual cooperation. ""Thank you. Now, are you sure I can't be of any assistance? I'm sure, if you tell me what this is all about...""

""Not our job, sir"" said Inspector Womble.

""Not our job, sir"" said Inspector Wire.

""It's just, I think there must have been some kind of mistake.""

""Mistake, sir?"" said Inspector Wire.

""Mistake, sir?"" said Inspector Womble.

""I see... I suppose the police never make mistakes, right?""

""Oh, we make mistakes all the time, don't we Inspector Womble?""

""We sure do, Inspector Wire, all the time. Nobody's perfect.""

""It's just that there are procedures, you see sir? Now is not the time for correcting mistakes, these things have to be dealt with at the appropriate time.""

""Through the appropriate channels.""

""In the appropriate manner.""

""By the appropriate representatives. It's not...""

""Not your job, right?... Your job is to check my books, right?""

""We can conduct a preliminary investigation, yes,"" said Inspector Wire. ""But, all these books will have to be sent to the forensic lab for further analysis.""

""Forensic lab?... Further analysis? Wait, you think one of my books might be... a murder weapon? You think I...?"" K became light-headed and felt the urgent need to lie down, but the act achieved little more than the prevention of him passing out.

Thoughts were spinning wildly around his head for several minutes before he wrestled one into submission and queued the rest of them up into some vaguely manageable order. Why on Earth would anyone think I've murdered someone? it doesn't make any sense, I'm not capable of murder... What am I talking about? everyone's capable of murder, given the right set of circumstances, isn't that what they say? What else do they say? means, motive and opportunity. Let's be objective about this - who *could* I have murdered? And why? He thought of his friends and family, but opportunity alone made family an easy possibility to dismiss, and for anyone for who he was still close enough to be considered a friend to, motive was unthinkable. He thought of his regular clients, the people whose houses he cleaned. The Montgomery's? Quinn and Richard? Mrs Henry? There was motive *and* opportunity with Mrs Henry. She always tries to pay him out of that stash she's got hidden in a biscuit tin, before he reminds her of the direct debit she's got set up with Clean Knows. Then he reminds her what a direct debit is. Then he reminds her that he's not her nephew, the chef who comes around to cook for her sometimes - none of that overpriced rubbish he cooks in that fancy restaurant, mind, she won't eat any of that, but he's a good lad, he's the only one who still comes around to see her. ""Shit!"" said K. ""Did he bludgeon his poor, defenceless aunt to death with a thick hardback for her life savings?"" This croaked utterance revealing how dry his throat had become, he slowly got up and headed to the kitchen.

""Don't go thinking about making a run for it,"" said Inspector Womble, tapping the taser in his belt. ""My pursuing days might be behind me but, the last time I checked Wikipedia, electricity still travels at the speed of light.""

K picked a glass from the smorgasbord of glasses, cups, plates, cutlery and utensils spread across his kitchen surfaces like a contemporary art installation, and turned on the tap. The first glass he instinctively poured over his head and he drank the second while surveying the former contents of his cupboards. Were all these items now considered potential murder weapons, soon to be taken to the lab for forensic analysis? He wondered if offering the inspectors coffee made him look more or less guilty. Then he wondered if wondering whether you looked more or less guilty made you look more or less guilty. He suspected that innocent suspects worry more than guilty suspects about whether they look more or less guilty. White with four sugars for Inspector Womble, straight black for Inspector Wire, the same as K took his.

On the couch, he stared at the blank TV screen and imagined himself portrayed in a courtroom drama, with Idris Elba playing the smooth-talking, hard-as-nails, lawyer tearing him to pieces and convincing the jury of his guilt in a gross miscarriage of justice that only becomes apparent years after he's been stabbed to death by Tom Hardy in the showers on D wing. They'll probably get one of the hobbits to play me, he thought, but not the main one. He was busy casting Olivia Colman as the journalist who relentlessly pursues the truth against all the odds, on behalf of nobody in particular, when Inspector Wire walked into the lounge and picked up K's coffee by mistake, not that it made any difference, except - ""Shouldn't you be wearing gloves?""

""What's that supposed to mean?""

""Nothing... it's just... you said my books were being sent for forensic analysis, aren't you worried about cross contamination or something?""

""Not... scientific analysis, you know... literary analysis.""

""*Literary*...? You think one of these books *inspired* me to commit a murder?""

""Murder?"" said Inspector Womble, joining them from the bedroom. ""Did I just hear a confession?""

""Did you just confess to a murder, sir?"" said Inspector Wire.

""No,"" said K.

""So, you haven't murdered anyone then, sir?"" said Inspector Womble.

""No!"" said K.

""Are you sure, sir?"" said Inspector Wire. ""Only, we wouldn't want to miss something like that, it's rather a big deal in our profession, isn't it Inspector Womble?""

""It sure is, Inspector Wire. I mean, if we missed something like that, we'd be getting stick down at the station for weeks, and you wouldn't want that, would you, sir?""

""Uh... no,"" said K.

""So, just to be clear, you definitely haven't murdered anyone?"" said Inspector Womble.

""No!""

""Not even a little accidental manslaughter?"" said Inspector Wire. ""It's nothing to be ashamed of, sir, it's a easy mistake to make, we've all done it.""

""You're taking the piss, aren't you? I'm not being arrested for murder, am I?""

""No, sir, you're not being arrested for murder,"" said Inspector Womble. ""Now, could I just ask you to fill in this brief questionnaire?"" He dropped a handheld computer onto K's lap, causing two consecutive knee-jerk reactions - a literal one of the instinctive genital protection variety, and a metaphorical one at the sight of the device. K avoided modern technology as much as he could and secretly longed for a return to the sweet inconvenience of the good old days, before the rise of the machines. He'd learnt to tolerate computers but that was as good as their relationship was ever going to get. The screen asked him how satisfied he was with the service provided today by Inspectors Wire and Womble from *Extremely Satisfied* to *Extremely Unsatisfied*, the beaming smiles of the friendly police officers looming over him. He was unable to stop his eyes drifting briefly over the mess in his flat before he clicked *Extremely Satisfied* and quickly worked his way through the rest of the form. The inspectors were *Extremely Respectful*, he felt *Sufficiently At Ease* with the process, it was conducted *Extremely Efficiently*, he felt *Completely Unthreatened,* there was *No Physical Contact* and he didn't have any additional comments or helpful suggestions for improving the service. He handed the device back to Inspector Womble, keen to bring the morning's unexpected, and increasingly bizarre, ordeal to its conclusion. ""Thank you, sir.""

""Drink up then, sir, it's time to go,"" said Inspector Wire, finishing his own coffee.

""Huh? Where are we going?""

""To the station, of course, you're being arrested.""

""*Arrested*? But he said...""

""You really should learn to pay attention, sir. He said you weren't being arrested for murder, he didn't say you weren't being arrested. Now, you're not going to give us any more trouble, are you? We've been very patient with you, so far, especially considering your astounding ignorance of the law and your generally uncooperative behaviour. You've been one of our most difficult clients in all the time we've been working together, which is what - six years?""

""Nearly seven. You've not been very hospitable, sir,"" Inspector Womble felt the need to point out as he dunked a digestive biscuit in his coffee. ""As your answers to the questionnaire prove, you've been having a great time, while this has been an *extremely* stressful experience for us, and your lack of empathy certainly hasn't helped matters. After all those endless questions, the least you can do is come quietly.""

""I will, I promise,"" said K. ""But, can I just ask one last question?"" The policemen exchanged a look, shrugged their shoulders, and waited. ""Can you just tell me what I *am* being arrested for?""

""Not our job, sir,"" said Inspector Wire.

I enjoy meeting people, I will have light conversations with my colleagues at work, and I have had friends in the past. I, however, do not like maintaining friendships or making a connections deeper than meeting up coffee a few times here and there. 

Growing up I was a little bit sheltered and had only a few friends. (I’m almost ashamed to say I was homeschooled from an early age until my teens.) I would see them at drama club once a week or I would hang out with that one only-child neighbor. I often felt isolated but at best I had my siblings to dream and imagine with. And for that I am grateful. 

As a teen I had my closest friend I met my first year of community college. We shared one class and we became close. We had a very nice friendship, very easy going, fun and light. We saw each other often and remained friends for about 4 years. We slowly started seeing less of each other as our work schedules ate up most of our time. I’m sad to say I don’t remember when or why we slowly stopped talking and eventually our friendship just faded like a distant, cloudy memory. We now only talk about once a year. Random messages here and there on socials. but that’s it. I was never in a friend group bigger than four. I felt strangely un-loyal if I had the opportunity to become friends with anyone other than her. That’s how I felt at least. 

I am now 25, happily married and I proudly claim my husband as my best friend. He is quite the opposite and has many friends. He went to much bigger schools and just lived polar opposite to my childhood. I don’t feel the need for a friend group or close friends other than my very own family. I feel good about that, at heart I am an extroverted introvert. ",3,1739946187.0,AITAH,4,1.0,False

We had some interest in each other last year. We didn’t go past a kiss, though. I ghosted him for basically half a year because I lost TWO jobs within a short time span and was overcome with devastation. During this period of ghosting, he reached out and arranged a date, but I cancelled due to extreme stress. I assumed he’d just lose interest in me at this point. He’s an attractive man who could easily find someone else.

After I got semi-over this career grievance, I reached out and he was still open to hanging out with me during his lunch break. Finally, we talked over coffee. We hugged and I gave him a little peck on the side of his neck before turning my back to go to work.

We didn’t see each other again for another two weeks. His birthday passed during this time, so I offered to take him out to dinner via text. When we met up again, he asked, “Hey, did you kiss me on the neck last time?” I giggled and said yes. He joked about it and then switched the subject, as if his curiosity was satisfied.

Maybe I just have a shit memory, but I was impressed that he could even remember without having mentioned it over text. Personally, I couldn’t have remembered something like that unless it gave me butterflies in my stomach. 

Is it presumptuous of me to interpret this as a chance that he still likes me? I’m nervous about this situationship because I thought I’d ruined whatever chemistry we used to have by ghosting him. ",3,1739946122.0,libra_astrology,3,1.0,False

If you want to talk: the 2a, freedom seeds, politics then let's sit and talk

I really don’t think he’s going to ask me leetcode, probably just talk about my paper and tell me to apply online, but still anyone has had any success into turning an informal coffee chat type zoom call into a research internship?

1isytce,https://www.reddit.com/r/ENFP/comments/1isytce/rant_isfj_coworker_keeps_backing_out_of/,Rant: ISFJ coworker keeps backing out of conversations he initiates himself,"I have a lovely, polite gentleman of a coworker. We always have lunch together. He is quite a bit older than me. We have a lot of overlapping interests and like to go beyond coffee table talk.

  
Thing is though. He keeps bringing up conversational items and then backing out when he realizes we might fundamentally disagree or that I would be bringing a different POV onboard.

  
He says Trump is turning US politics into a circus. I tell him I agree and that I think he's an active menace to democracy in US (this was before he was re-elected and I was a 100% correct on my assessment). He disagrees, vaguely gesturing that he ""does not think so"" and that he only meant that it ""looks"" like a circus. I start defending my point and he just keeps being vague, slowly shaking his head and smiling awkwardly.

  
And yesterday we were talking about a possible bonus at work. The specific company we work for is doing great. The greater concern is not and there are about to be lay-offs. We are not included, our whole company is not included.

  
He says that we won't probably get the bonus. I say that it would make sense, it's a hefty chunk of money, estimated to be about one month's of pay. He says that no, it's not a big amount of money and starts doing the slow head shaking and ghosting the conversation. I ask him: Well if it's not a large sum, why would they not just pay it? And would it not make sense to reward the company that's actually doing well? Not paying the bonus is a middle finger to the workers whose work is helping keep the mother company afloat.

  
Independently in about a second's time I arrive at the conclusion that it must be a solidarity issue, not a financial one. But he won't just meet me anywhere and won't even give it to me when I arrive at the point he didn't even make out loud! I feel like I am being manipulated during lunch hour lol. Like he won't acknowledge my opinion, not when we agree or when we disagree.

  
Full disclosure: I know what to do. I have started going ""uh-huh, well I'll be"" at him when I sense a conversational dead-end coming. He is a Si dominant, the dead-ends are not exactly difficult to prepare for lol. I am not looking for advice. I know he finds me aggressive and combative and I simply find him slow and stubborn. It still fucking sucks and makes me feel like a rug is pulled from underneath me every time it happens because my ISTJ mode activates and wants to investigate, only to be thrown out lol.
