Surgery Lasted for 5.5 hr, didn’t get conscious tape 2hr post op.

They removed total 7 fibroids( two 12cm each, other 2-3 cm)

Had serious irritation in throat due to breathing tube. Woke up with catheter . Couldn’t talk or move. Severe leg pain😖 almost felt like road-roller rolled over me( honestly not exaggerating) dr told me it could be because of the position I was held in for those 6 Hours.

Was recommended to not drink anything till dinner time. Stay in elevated sleeping position. Asked to introduce to sip of water -one spoon at a time until I stopped puking it out which only happened after midnight.

Once water intake got stable I kept the water intake steady to few sips every hour.

Day 2

Next morning soft food 🥘 with tea/ coffee ☕️ .Wasn’t able to eat much.

Started talking and change sides. Later allowed to walk for a couple minutes.  And as soon I stood up, blood 🩸 came running down my leg from my V, they told me it could be from the cleaning they did at end of procedure.( lil blood mixed with liquid)

Once I was able to walk again they asked if they remove the catheter. And they did. I did notice bright red bleeding in my diaper. Afternoon, I was able to eat lil more than before as I even started feeling hungry, there were many syringes though the day 1-2 but it was getting added to the IVdrip. 💉 God bless the drip✨

I was able to feel my bladder and was able to excrete with no burning sensation.

All in all I noticed a lot of spotting on Day 2.

Day end with warm mashed rice with lentil soup. As IV continued

Day 3

They noticed that the IV wasn’t going well enough into my veins. So they tried to flush the drip tip with help of syringe. But it leaked out and ended up with a swollen palm. 😵‍💫

They had to change the IV drip tip from right hand to Left hand.

The last small drip was left that was of strong antibiotic but got allergic reaction on my left hand. They had to stop the drip and give me anti allergic medicine. Continued to drip the Iv.

Experiencing cough and irritated throat as soon as I get sleepy, coughing makes stitches stretch.

No bowel movement as of yet.

Day 4

Trying to walk and drink warm water but only gas was passed. Noticed blood and mucus as I passed the gas. Bleeding is constant, doctors said it could be due to anesthesia as prolonged use irritates of bowel more. Finally after lunch I saw solid poop and passing gas without any liquid/mucus.

Coughing got worsen,😷 couldn’t sleep because of that, now doctor presume Ayurvedic cough syrup as  already on a lot of chemicals.  It helped.

Burping and farting increased significantly after lunch(so embarrassing)😳 . Had trouble sleeping because of cough but doctor suggested to take cough syrup so it helped a lil for an hour. Feeling extremely cold, shivering and lil fever. Might be because am having allergic reactions to that cough syrup. Took medicine for allergies.

Day 5

Had a good sleep, coughing but still slept well.

Still seeing vaginal bleeding❤️‍🩹, a lot of gas and bloating! 🐡

Finally had a huge solid poop without any help of laxative so that’s a good sign

Stitches hurt like ant bites. Mouth feels wayy bitter than it has ever been.

Feeling better than all the days combined otherwise.

Although am still walking like a penguin.🐧

Day 6:  feeling really good 😊 so I started walking more, but got tired and felt exhausted later in the day. And regretted walking more than my new normal.

Day 7 : Visited Dr, for regular post op check up. I had two manual stitches that she took off. Gave me antibiotic ointment and something to help with scarring once the incisions are dry.

I was actually travelling a lot! Went to shops in car and had street food, and am Surprised that my took it well! 😄

It felt really nice to have a normal day after long time.

Day8:  am officially off of all post op medicine, so no more bitter antibiotics and painkillers.  I am still getting Gas Pain but I am walking it out as much as I can.

Am having Digine (Asian version of GasX) 1tbsp twice a day. It really helps!

Day9-14 : trying to get gas out as much as possible with gentle movement and stretches.

Day 15-17: having full PMS symptoms! Cramps, leg pain, irritation and frustration, sensitive to voice and light.

Today- Day 18 🩸 Ms Flow is here!!  Cramps are not bad as it used to be preOp but it’s really sharp and different.  Bleeding seems normal for day1 .

Day 19:  woke up in a pool of blood 🩸‼️ I think I went unconscious in my sleep, I have never felt so weird in my entire life while waking up. There is no way I couldn’t have felt a thing while losing all this blood and just slept through ( am a light sleeper) my parents were also worry as I didn’t move until noon, but they thought am just sleeping too much because of weakness.

I finally got myself together, cleaned myself and  immediately contacted my Dr and told him it’s like someone have open a tap.

Dr. told me it was expected and my second period might be similar. Prescribed me Tranexamic Acid to help with the heavy flow.

It took 3 hour to see any improvement.

I feel like am back to square one with my healing process. I am sure it will get better with time.

These are friends of mine that I have had for quite a few years now and so I was under the assumption that we could share drinks amicably without any issues - and we did do this in the beginning as all 3 of us had ordered different drinks. I am very used to this as I come from a big family with lots of siblings and to me my friends are on that same level of closeness (again over 6 years of friendship). So when I asked for a second sip of coffee from one of my friends (17 F) and she said no I assumed that she was just joking and being sarcastic. So I took a sip. As my lips were around the straw she kept protesting but I lowk didn't gaf I didn't think it was that deep at all bc if it were the other way I genuinely could not care less and I would say no as a joke also. BUT, after taking a sip I realised she was actually annoyed and gen didn't want me to have a sip. Again idrk why she gaf but whatever. Then I went non verbal for like 3 minutes bc I was upset lmak ( ik ik I'm a sensitive chud) and then went up to her and told her that I forgive her jokingly. ",1,1770820906.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

I work from home doing campaigns and stuff, so i really need to be able to concentrate for long stretches, but my brain was just… scattered. tried cutting coffee completely at once, but then i was just tired and unfocused lol. not ideal.

A few weeks back my brother told me about this nootropic/adaptogen mix he'd been using, the brand is graymatter. looked into the ingredients: lions mane, rhodiola, some other adaptogens, plus like 75mg of natural caffeine from matcha and green tea.

Honestly? it's been pretty solid. not like a crazy immediate difference, but after about a week i noticed i could actually sit down and work through something without my brain bouncing all over the place. the focus feel calmer,  like i'm not forcing it. and no afternoon crash.  taste is decent, not saying it's some miracle thing, but it's genuinely helped me get out of that brain fog afternoon crash loop while still being able to function.

Kiddos are 7 and 5, kindergarten and 2nd grade. Morning bus comes at 9am, take home comes at 4:20pm. I’m getting bored during the days while they’re gone and this was something I was worried about as my youngest was about to enter K. I need more structure! I need a routine! I’m not looking to spend money, so going to the gym, lunches, coffees that’s not exactly in the cards rn. 

I’m not into the idea of getting a job at the moment, as the flex of this life is exactly what my family needs. (Being home for all the pickups/drop offs, sick days, snow days, holidays, breaks etc.) My husband is in trades and is an apprentice, so with his full time work and classes, I’m left with everything at home which I’m 100% okay with. I’m just getting lonely and more bored as the days go on. I’m finding myself feeling directionless while the kids are gone and then I spiral about thinking as they get older wtf am I going to do…(not to get too far into it but I was a sahm while my oldest was 0-4. Started working full time as a hotel event manager in a metro city up north. I was burnt out 3 years in and quit to be back with my kids Oct ‘24. Event management/ hospitality is something I am not interested in going back to. For many reasons lol)

As far as keeping myself busy: I read, but of course have been in a reading slump. I love tv but that makes me feel too unproductive lol. I want to start gardening come spring, but winter is hindering that. I listen to podcasts and clean. I love to sing so I got a singing app that I’ve been loving. I did recently get involved in my towns local democratic committee so as campaigns ramp up I’m sure I’ll find more to keep me busy.

Am I overreacting?,"I’m WFH on Valentine’s Day, I knew this since the year began and told her about it. Told her it is unfortunate but that we could do something small at my place while I work. She seemed very OK with this. 

Yesterday we talked about our plans for Saturday again in person. Now I noticed she seemed hesitant, she told me she doesn’t want me to feel pressured on my job, that she wouldn’t want it to uncomfortable for both of us that she’s just there hanging out while I work. 

I told her that it is not a problem: the hours I will be covering on Saturday are graveyard shift and pretty much I just have to babysit my laptop. For context: I take a classes in the morning and I’ll WFH from 2-10pm.

(This is true, I’ve worked these hours on Saturday before, even on-site, and work is super slow) 

After this we agreed that she would come over in the evening (around 5ish pm) and spend a couple of hours together, prepare some coffee, etc. while I keep an eye on work. 

The day went by and last night she texted me that she prefers that we see each other another day when I’m actually free. That “we deserve presence”. 

This hurt me. I understand it isn’t the most exciting or especial plan for Valentine’s, but I just was trying to play the hand I was dealt. It felt to me that she discarded the effort I was trying to make of still seeing each other and spending time together.

Also something about the way she framed it didn’t sit right with me honestly. Her comment about “presence”,  made me feel like it is my fault that I’m working and that if I can’t give her my 110% she’s not interested. 

Im not even the type of person that cares all that much about Valentine’s. I know expressions of love aren’t exclusive of this one date. But still, this is going to be our first Valentine’s together (together 4 months) and I wanted to at least do something together. 

Am I overreacting here?

I wake up at 6:40 every morning. Not 6:30. Not 7. 6:40. I don’t even use an alarm anymore. My body just does it.

Last week I woke up at 6:38.

I remember checking the time and thinking that was weird. Like I’d beaten something by two minutes.

I brushed it off.

No reason. Just wide awake.

And I heard movement in the kitchen.

Not loud. Just a cabinet closing gently.

I stayed still. I kept telling myself it was the building settling. Pipes. Fridge cycling.

But then I heard the exact sound my coffee mug makes when I set it on the counter.

That small ceramic tap.

I didn’t go check. I should have. But I didn’t.

In the morning, my coffee mug was already out. Sitting next to the machine.

I don’t leave it out.

Yesterday I got home from work and my shoes were lined up neatly against the wall.

I don’t do that either. I kick them off.

I stood there for a full minute just staring at them.

Last night I forced myself to stay awake.

2:00 a.m.

2:47.

3:11.

At 3:12 exactly, I heard my bedroom door open.

Slow. Careful.

Like someone who knows it creaks if you push too fast.

I didn’t move. I couldn’t.

Footsteps crossed the room.

They stopped right beside my bed.

I kept my breathing even. Pretended to be asleep.

After a few seconds, I heard something else.

My voice.

Quiet. Soft. Right above me.

“Almost perfect.”

There are only four or five food carts there as of yesterday, and only one of them was open.  But another is usually open and two others look very close to opening.

This is on SE Division a half block west of the intersection with Cesar Chavez, i.e. next door to Tom's Bar and Restaurant.  The exciting part is it's being done by the same guy who did The Heist in Woodstock.  This will be a smaller pod and building, but they're planning to have IIRC at least 8 food carts there eventually.  One of the food cart operators told me that they're planning to remodel the building (a former restaurant) into an example of Mid-Century Modern architecture -- and they'll call the pod ModHaus.

And like The Heist, they're bringing in some food carts that are already known to be of high quality.  Chick N Pig, one of my favorite food carts and favorite Thai places, has moved there from Woodstock and looks like it'll be ready to re-open in just days.  Hawker Station and Makulit (Singaporean and Filipino respectively) have relocated from the Lil America pod.  JoJo was the one food cart that was open yesterday.

They have some other food carts already lined up to move in, but on their Instagram account they say they're looking to add a pizza food cart.

So it appears a bit hit and miss right now in terms of who's even open.  With the building not ready, there are a couple of porta-potties and three picnic tables (no shade or cover).  But Hawker Station is apparently usually open and Chick N Pig and Makulit look like they'll be open very soon.  When they finally finish renovating that building and bringing in the rest of the food carts, I think this could be a good destination.

  
P.S.  I'm guessing that the building will also contain a bar, coffee shop, and TV and maybe games as seems standard nowadays for ""bar and cart"" places such as The Heist (and Chill N Fill, Brooklyn Carreta, etc.).  The person I talked to (Mike, one of the owners of Makulit) says that they're aiming for an all-ages family-friendly atmosphere, which also seems standard at these high-amenity food cart pods.",1,1770820492.0,Portland,1,0.67,False

Neither of them have proof of things happening or not happening.,"I 29f and my partner 32m have been together for about 2 1/2 years. We live together and have been through A LOT as a unit. We’ve made it through health crisis, financial crisis and full emotional breakdowns. 

We have problems just like any other couple, though. And yesterday we spent the morning talking through some of those issues (long story short, I had an appointment he was going to take me to, but he forgot last minute and I didn’t have time to make other arrangements, so the appointment was missed and we had to talk out what to do in the future to avoid it)

Right as we rectified the discussion, got coffee and moved on… this girl I went to high school with walked into my workplace.

She started off not even recognizing me. I was wearing a low hat because it was a tough day and I was feeling shy… and didn’t think much of it. We were never close, never spoke or hung out even one single time. 

Once she got a quick look at my face, she got worked up and said “I know you! I’ve been meaning to message you but can’t find your page!” Obviously this confused me. Again, we’ve never interacted. I’d recently deactivated my socials to focus on family and life itself, so her being unable to reach me despite efforts checked out. 

Then she said something that made me literally puke out of shock.

“Your man has been in my dms trying to ask for pics and pick me up to go out to eat.”

Of course I immediately ask when, how, and do you have any proof? She gave me what details she could, but when I asked for proof she said “I pointed out that I knew y’all lived together, and he immediately blocked me.”

What the f.

This girl tho… she’s notoriously unstable. Not judging, but it’s no secret she’s in active stimulant addiction. Very, VERY unreliable source.

I hope that I don’t have that problem..

So here are some information about my teeth: 

1. 19 years old, don’t smoke and drink coffee. Only drink water and tea, slightly drink cola or other sweet drinks.

2. Had braces put on before.

3. I had a crown which is my upper left front tooth.

4. since the orthodontist treatment end in 2021, I had not seen dentist until 2025. ( I seek for teeth cleaning.)

ps: after teeth cleaning, my dentist said I need to brush softly.

btw, If I have gum receding, what should I do to protect my teeth…?

I don’t want myself look so bad in smiling…

Neither of them have proof of things happening or not happening.,"I 29f and my partner 32m have been together for about 2 1/2 years. We live together and have been through A LOT as a unit. We’ve made it through health crisis, financial crisis and full emotional breakdowns. 

We have problems just like any other couple, though. And yesterday we spent the morning talking through some of those issues (long story short, I had an appointment he was going to take me to, but he forgot last minute and I didn’t have time to make other arrangements, so the appointment was missed and we had to talk out what to do in the future to avoid it)

Right as we rectified the discussion, got coffee and moved on… this girl I went to high school with walked into my workplace.

She started off not even recognizing me. I was wearing a low hat because it was a tough day and I was feeling shy… and didn’t think much of it. We were never close, never spoke or hung out even one single time. 

Once she got a quick look at my face, she got worked up and said “I know you! I’ve been meaning to message you but can’t find your page!” Obviously this confused me. Again, we’ve never interacted. I’d recently deactivated my socials to focus on family and life itself, so her being unable to reach me despite efforts checked out. 

Then she said something that made me literally puke out of shock.

“Your man has been in my dms trying to ask for pics and pick me up to go out to eat.”

Of course I immediately ask when, how, and do you have any proof? She gave me what details she could, but when I asked for proof she said “I pointed out that I knew y’all lived together, and he immediately blocked me.”

What the f.

This girl tho… she’s notoriously unstable. Not judging, but it’s no secret she’s in active stimulant addiction. Very, VERY unreliable source. I was worried about her backtracking if confronted, so I quietly went up to her again and had her repeat the details on a quiet recording. I made sure to say her name out loud so the video showed who I was talking to.

And then I threw up.

My shift was over soon after that so I raced home.

I texted my partner and said we needed to talk, and that it was serious. When he got home I did my best to stay impartial as I told him everything and showed him the video. He was shocked. Said that he’d had her as a friend with benefits shortly after high school… 10 years ago. He said she’s BEEN blocked and definitely hasn’t spoken to her in the last few months especially.

🥚 Poached Breakfast Bistro  
📍 259 2nd Ave S, Saskatoon, SK  
  
Review from Dec 2025:  
  
To start our long day in Saskatoon, my boyfriend and I began with Poached Breakfast Bistro. While my boyfriend just had a Double Espresso ($4.3), I got the Peanut Butter Hot Chocolate ($8), Poached Over Crab & Shrimp Risotto Cakes ($21) with Pecan & Maple Syrup Bacon Roll-Ups ($7.5).  
  
I’m very impressed with the menu and drink options. They have plenty of unique options and you can really feel the creativity in what they offer. The interior was also very unique, it’s an older building but modernized with an artistic touch while incorporating its vintage roots.  
  
My boyfriend said his coffee was good, didn’t taste burnt. 😂 The bar is in Hell for good coffee in Regina.  
  
My hot chocolate was made with frothed creamy peanut butter and chocolate almond milk. It made a welcome nutty flavour combination that was unique yet delicious. I also loved that it smelled strongly of peanut butter.  
  
Being at a restaurant named “Poached” I had to get poached eggs. My dish consisted off house made shrimp, pollock crab and white wine risotto cakes, flavoured with Dijon and Dill, along with 2 poached eggs and herbed hollandaise sauce and a side of rye toast. As an additional side, I ordered their classic house made bacon rollups. These are made with crushed pecans and pure maple syrup then topped with a hint of cayenne for heat.  
  
Honestly, it was a lot of food. You don’t need the bacon rollups but the were SO good that I recommend trying them. My cakes were crispy on the outside yet hot and soft on the inside. The taste was mild, fresh and comforting. It was perfect for such a cold day and I wouldn’t change a thing about this dish.  
  
I highly recommend this restaurant and everything we ordered. Thank you to everyone that suggested this spot. It’s my cousin’s favourite brunch spot in Saskatoon and now I understand why!",13,1770819964.0,saskatoon,5,0.88,False

While not on my original itinerary, I am SO happy I popped in. I walked by it originally, then when I wasn’t sold on my dinner location’s dessert, I came back here !

You will find yourself transported into what I can describe as a Vintage Luxe coffee shop. It’s cozy, it’s thrifty and it's history. WOW are their treats good.

I sat on a very comfortable brown leather couch and enjoyed a Toasted Coconut Cream Roll ($7.95) and an apple cider ($5). The cream roll is dairy free, nut free and vegan! I actually didn’t notice it was dairy free until I looked back at the description. It was massive, soft, fluffy and delicious. Not too sweet either which I appreciated. My apple cider was decent, great on a cold, late night.

I even took home a Strawberry Earl Grey Scone ($4.95) for breakfast the next day. Amazing, though I didn’t really taste Earl Grey.

This place is great for everyone, be it friends, couples, a (bad or good) first date, an intervention to convince your friend to break up with her bf, a solo late night treat or even a place to design 3D models on your laptop. I promise you, I witnessed it all in my short time here.

1r1yntg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r1yntg,AI images are everywhere on Amazon. Here’s how to make them on-brand,"AI images are everywhere on Amazon right now. The quality jump over the last months is real, and in many cases the results are already usable without editing.

What still feels off in a lot of listings is not quality, but brand fit. You can generate an image that looks great on its own. Sharp lighting, clean composition, professional finish. And yet it’s unusable for your Amazon listing because it simply doesn’t match your brand’s visual style.

The problem usually isn’t the model. It’s how prompts are written. Most prompts describe what should be visible in the image. Very few define how the image should feel in terms of brand. Tone, mood, visual hierarchy, color logic, background structure. Without that guidance, the AI invents a new “style” every time.

If you want on-brand AI images, brand style has to be treated like any other requirement. It has to be defined clearly and reused systematically.

Trying to describe brand style in words rarely works well. “Premium”, “modern”, or “minimal” are too abstract. What works better is starting from existing brand visuals. Campaign assets, A+ content, lifestyle images. They already contain the rules your visuals follow. Colors, fonts, lighting patterns, composition logic, overall mood.

Those patterns can be extracted and turned into a reusable visual system that the AI can follow when generating new images.

That is the approach we have now implemented in AMALYTIX. *Style Guides* can be derived from reference images and then applied when generating new visuals. The result is not just good-looking images, but images that actually belong to your brand and fit seamlessly into your listing.

We have just launched this feature and put together a more detailed walkthrough that shows how the setup works in practice.

I bought the cheap 25 pack of Early Result Wondfos for this cycle. They continued to stay faint every day, possibly just getting a hair darker each time, but not really noticeable. I decided to save my one FR strip for 14 dpo.

The Wondfo early result strip is still coming up light. The First Response regular strip has a darker line. Neither is a dye stealer, but I found it interesting that the one that is supposed to be less sensitive has a darker line lol

I tried all the usual stuff, more water, trying to eat better (lol), even cut down on coffee for a bit which was brutal. nothing really stuck or made a noticeable difference. then my sister mentioned she was trying moringa for something else and it gave her a bit of a boost, so i figured why not.

I grabbed some capsules from this brand called Rosabella, mostly because it was plant-based and looked pretty straightforward. honestly, wasn't expecting much, but after a couple weeks i actually noticed a difference. not like, bouncing off the walls energy, but i don't feel like i need a nap by 2pm anymore. my brain fog feels a bit clearer too, which is a huge win. it's not a magic bullet, but it's helped me feel way more functional.

1r1ygoi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nanny/comments/1r1ygoi/burn_out_is_inevitable/,Burn Out Is Inevitable..,"Mostly looking to vent but wouldn't mind some support and advice on my situation.. 

I take care of two children from two different families at the same time. NKF is 5 months and NKM is 16 months. Both families are amazing to work for and I don't want to even think about ever leaving them but the kids needs and sleep schedules and the parents work schedules leave me working very long 10 hour days with no breaks or time to relax. I thankfully only work four days a week and my three days weekends are the only things holding me together at this point but I'm running low on steam and I've only been doing this for two months.. 

NKF has 2ish hour wake windows and only naps for 25-30 minutes and NKM has 3-4ish hour wake windows (honestly their naps depend on NKF being asleep). Every two hours for NKF nap, I have to set NKM up with tablet time, which I absolutely hate but it's the only way to keep him quiet enough and occupied for the 10-15 minutes it takes me to get NKF down. Once NKF is asleep, I have 15-20 minutes to either finally give NKM some one on one attention or try to get them to nap, which also takes 10-15 minutes. Neither child falls asleep independently which is understandable given their ages. 

NKF is very needy and requires almost constant attention. Most times I even need to run to the bathroom to pee or changing the other ones diaper, NKF is crying because she's put down. NKM gets half assed attention almost all day and too much tablet time in my opinion, even though it's only for NKF to get a nap and the last 10 minutes of my day so I can frantically pick up before NP get home. I have to eat one handed while also feeding NKM and myself. Lunch is so far from a break it's crazy. NKM can only go down for a nap when NKF is sleeping because he can't fall asleep with her crying. NKM sleeps for about an hour and keeping NKF happy and quiet that whole time is very difficult. Unfortunately the set up of the apartment doesn't allow NKM to sleep in their own space. Thankfully, NKF has her own space for her naps but for safety reasons, NKM needs to sleep in the livingroom. 

All of this to say, I'm tired. I get no break other than maybe 5 minutes twice a day of both kids sleeping and even then it's hurry and pee and make some coffee and maybe get a snack in without having to share with NKM. I knew 2 under 2 was going to be a challenge as I did it myself with my own but my youngest was not a low sleep, high attention need baby like NKF is. Honestly NKF needs their own nanny but given the situation, these two are a packaged deal. Idk how much longer I can keep doing this. I should have asked more questions during the interview process or did a trial run or something. ",1,1770819217.0,Nanny,3,1.0,False
1r1ygaq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantBreakUps/comments/1r1ygaq/was_i_too_impatient/,Was I too impatient?,"I need help deciphering our arguments, because now I worry I was the bad guy.

He's a widower and single parent. He was pretty communicative about his limits, but only after they caused issues. I was never upset when his kid came first. I LOVED him and we were building a family together. Outside of childcare, I was always in his whirlwind. He was constantly filling his schedule and de-prioritizing the relationship.

Our two major arguments were when he would get a last-minute window of time bc his MIL would take his son for the night. We'd agree to meet up, but communication about times and places always left me waiting.

On his bday, he had a really stressful week that ended with a big test. He was spent and wanted to turn his brain off. I sent him bday spotify mix I worked really hard on, and he heart reacted it - nothing else. I know he was stressed, but I was kinda hurt by the low-effort response, so that probably set the tone for me. He later said ""well you didn't include any other text and just sent it by itself."" He went to a dinner and wasn't really in contact while I tried to plan \*my\* night. He waffled, saying ""I dunno, I have a friend in town I'd like to meet up with."" I asked if he wanted to fly solo, cuz his messages were coming so few and far apart and he didn't communicate he meant all of us.

The dinner went way longer than intended, but he wasn't communicating about it. I tried calling and he declined the call and texted saying it was still happening. I wasn't trying to be obsessive. I just wanted to get ready and head in whichever direction.

He later said he just wanted to decompress with friends and not look at the phone. Which is fine, but when we were together, he was CONSTANTLY on his phone. I was invisible. Even when we were with his son in the park, he would sit on a bench and scroll. When he was with others, he'd stop communicating for hours, which was usually fine, but sometimes I needed responses and when I asked he said he was lost in those moments.

Then he went to a bar by himself and said he'd come where I was after. The time changed but still wasn't clear. I could have already left and met him. He later said he had a stressful convo with his mom and wanted to decompress, but didn't say that in real time. I sat alone at the bar until midnight and he gave an ETA of 12:45am! By this time I had told him gently I was feeling out of the loop and he said he was afraid if he came it would ""be bad."" So he went home. He always seemed to think I was going to like, flip out on him. I just wanted to chat it out and move on.

The next day, he said that he wanted  freedom and to not be burdened with making a plan. But I still felt like an afterthought. He said ""I didn't do anything wrong"" and ""the only thing I'm sorry about waiting so long to decide not to come."" I understood wanting freedom, but he also said ""maybe you were putting yourself in a place where you wanted to be hurt.""

Did I put too much pressure when he was exhausted? He was too exhausted to make a plan, because with a son, \*everything\* had to be planned. I empathized with that, but it felt disrespectful. I told him I would have gone anywhere he wanted or just to where he was.

He said this felt like ""control."" That I wasn't being proactive enough - I should have decided to go home when it became too late.

Months later, he went to a concert with some people and asked if I wanted to come out after. Since I prodded a lot the other time, I didn't push and let him lead. I earlier said I was tired but then said I would have a coffee bc I wanted to come out. He said one of his friends wouldn't make it and I said ""oh I would have liked to meet them.""

He messaged during the concert and said it should end around 9:30. I figured he'd let me know when they were on their way somewhere else and I'd head out. Then didn't text me until 10:30 - when they arrived at their destination. I could have left earlier, but now it was late. He said everything from ""well you said you were tired"" to ""we didn't have a definite plan"" to ""it was chaotic after the concert, I couldn't really stop and text.""

I told him I wasn't upset, but that we should table the convo since this miscommunication kept happening. Then he stopped responding. This is the part that actually upset me. I thought I was being mature saying ""I'm not mad, let's address this later.""

The next night, I tried to explain my POV. He got really upset and yelled at me for being ""lazy,"" and bringing my ""baggage."" He kept interrupting me and wouldn't let me explain my side. I told him I didn't poke because that stressed him out the last time. He said ""so you did the exact opposite?"" Nothing ended up being resolved really, but I did say I was sorry and would try to do better.

Over the next few days, he spiraled and brought up all these things about how he hadn't been feeling growth, how he had to make ""concessions"" in the relationship. When I asked what those were, the example was that I wanted a facetime call every night, if only for 10 minutes, when he wanted to be able to wash dishes and talk on earbuds. I was like ""we talked about that weeks ago"" and he said I was dismissing him. All of these grievances came out of nowhere and blindsided me, which understandably made me emotional. Then my emotions were ""too much"" and he didn't feel like he could express himself because he would have to ""field"" my emotions (a phrase he used a lot).

This entire thing broke a floodgate of feelings and issues he said he was having for a while that I never knew were happening. Like a failure to connect or tap into the deeper parts of me (meanwhile he playing phone games in bed or scrolling on the couch and often didn't look up at me for like a half hour at a time).

He'd also make big promises ""I'm going to come to every single one of your events"" and then every time an event came up, something else came up. When he came to finally meet my friends, he was quiet and cranky. He said he wanted to ""keep things loose"" which felt like he'd come if there was nothing better to do. When I told him it hurt, he got defensive, that he had so many responsibilities and people relying on him, ""do you think I wanna go to \[family picnic\] or some \[my\] event? I'd rather go to a baseball game by myself."" Yet I always came to his events, art shows, friend hangs, etc.

I always asked if he really had the capacity for a relationship, and ge said I should gauge if what he could provide was enough. I wanted to believe he had the capacity, because he said he did, but he still failed to show up for basic relationship things.

Maybe I put too much pressure, but it seemed like he could never be present or see how his actions affected me and just got defensive.

Now, 7 months after our BU, he's engaged to someone 13 years younger. After he said he was going to take time and reflect on his capacity and mental space. Ha!",1,1770819193.0,AvoidantBreakUps,1,1.0,False

- What is the total financial cost? I imagine there will be a sign up fee, and maybe other costs to cover the coffee beans, water and equipment.

- How long does recipe preparation last?

- Do smaller competitions also require a ""show"" or a detailed presentation about something specific, like we see in WBC?

Pretty normal day today. Nothing special, but that's fine. Normal is good down here.

Woke up at 6:30. Made coffee with FitPear. Well, ""coffee."" It's still mostly grain and disappointment, but it's hot.

""Another day, another article,"" FitPear said.

I told him that’s just our job

  


Morning dispatch came in around 8. Squidi sorted through it while I organized the filing system. He found it funny that I actually bothered organizing anything.

He said to me kindly ""Harold, we're in the apocalypse. Why are you alphabetizing?""

""Someone has to keep things organized!"" I replied

""Nobody's going to read these files.""

""I will!""

He shook his head but he was smiling. I think he appreciates it, even if he won't admit it.

  


Around 10 AM, Squidi asked me to do some routine reporting in Sector 9. Just checking in with soldiers, getting quotes, maybe a human interest story.

""Nothing dangerous,"" he said. ""Just standard stuff.""

""Got it!"" I said from my bunk

FitPear looked up. ""Want company?""

""Nah, I'm good! It's just Sector 9."" I said while packing up my stuff

""Alright. Be back by lunch?"" FitPear asked

""Probably!"" I said while pocketing my Talon for protection

  


Otto was fixing the printing press when I left. It was making weird noises again.

""Think it'll last the day?""

""Maybe,"" Otto said. ""Or it'll explode. Fifty-fifty.""

""I believe in you!""

""Your optimism is disturbing, Harold.""

That made me laugh.

  


Before I left, Squidi stopped me.

""Harold, you got your press badge?"" he asked seriously

""Yep! Right here."" I showed him the green sword and golden and purple half circles.

""Good. Make sure it's visible. Both sides usually respect it.""

""Will do!""

""And grab some quotes from the 14th Regiment if you see them. They've got good stories.""

""On it, boss!""

  


It's weird writing this now, but I remember being excited about today. Not because anything special was happening, but because I was finally getting comfortable with the job. Like I belonged, you know?

Three months ago I could barely write a coherent sentence under pressure. Now I can interview soldiers while artillery shakes the tunnels.

Progress!

  


I packed my usual gear: notebook, three pencils, press badge, canteen, camera, talon for self defence. Standard reporting kit.

FitPear waved as I left. ""See you at lunch!""

""Save me some of that mystery meat!"" I said cheerfully

""No promises!""

  


The walk to Sector 9 was quiet. Passed a few Royal Nation patrols. They recognized the Solace Times badge and nodded. One guy even said, ""Hey, you work for the newspaper right?! Read your article about the Jaegers. Funny stuff!""

Made me feel good. People actually read what we write.

  


Found the 14th Regiment around 11 AM. They were resting between patrols. Got some great quotes:

""We're tired, but we're holding the line.""

""My girl back home keeps asking when I'm coming back. I tell her when we win. She's gonna be waiting a while.""

""The cave plague is spreading, but we're managing. Morale could be worse.""

Good material. Squidi will like these. Don’t know how he makes those jokes.

  


I'm writing this entry during my lunch break. Found a quiet corner in Sector 9 to eat my ration and jot down notes.

After this, I'm going to check the eastern tunnels, get a few more interviews, then head back to the office. Should be back by 2 PM.

FitPear's probably asleep at his desk again. Otto's probably still fighting with the press. Squidi's probably giggling at his own jokes (he does that).

Normal day.

I like normal days.

  


Alright, lunch is done. Time to finish up and head back.

Looking forward to writing this up tonight. Nothing groundbreaking, but solid reporting. That's what we do.

See you tonight, diary.

Unsure how to make open, narrow living space feel cozy and cohesive","Moving into a historic townhome that has a very narrow and very open first floor living area.

My thought is a small living space (no TV) in the front room, with one small couch or two chairs backed up in front of the window. A small coffee table, and then another couch with the back facing the kitchen area. Perhaps a small console table behind the couch closer to the kitchen, to help ground/separate the living area.

by Preston Dennett

The little people are here! And they have been here for a very long time. What do these reports have to say about modern day extraterrestrial visitations? One of the strangest enigmas of the UFO phenomenon is the huge variation of reported humanoids. Grays, Mantids, Tall Whites, Nordics, Human-looking ETs, Blue Beings, Dwarves…the list seems endless. Complicating this is the fact that cultures across the world have been reporting a wide variety of supernatural entities. Fairies, elves, gnomes, kobalds…little people of all kinds. The question is: could some of these little people be aliens? Or vice-versa, could some of the aliens be little people? There doesn’t appear to be any easy answer. But the fact remains, there are countless reports of these kinds, and it is still going on today! This video presents ten fascinating cases, reaching back a hundred years to the current day, and coming from across the planet, where people have encountered little people which might be interpreted in different ways, elf or alien!?

AN ELF IN BRANTE, FINLAND. In 1885, a mother of three was picking berries in the forest near her home in Brante, Finland when she saw a large circular object landed on a small hill. Standing next to it was an elf-like creature holding an axe. Terrified, the woman fled the area. She returned a short time later with some other people, but the object and the elf were gone. She kept the secret for many years, finally sharing it with her granddaughter.

THE LITTLE MAN OF MONGAUP VALLEY, NY. Ron Quinn was just ten years old in August of 1942 when he was on vacation with his family in Mongaup Valley, NY. One afternoon, he was inside the cottage when he heard someone tapping on the window. Going to investigate, he was amazed to see a small man only one foot tall with long hair, a dark gray beard and large eyes wearing a green hat, a gray shirt, trousers, and soft brown boots. Smiling, the little man motioned for Ron to come closer. Ron opened the window and reached out to touch the man. The man stepped back, tilted his head and ran off into the woods, turning around once to take a last look at Ron.

MY MYSTERIOUS FRIEND. In 1945, Galen Sharp was only five years old when an elf appeared in his home in Lakewood, CO. The little man was the same height as Galen, with large eyes, a rounded nose, and a bald head. He wore a short jacket, dark square-cut pants and worn leather shoes. He playfully introduced himself to Galen and disappeared. Over the next year, the elf reappeared several times, always when Galen was alone, and would share special stories with him and perform playful antics to make Galen laugh. The elf shared all kinds of spiritual wisdom with Galen. One time, two elves showed up. Galen told his parents who thought he had an active imagination. But Galen got proof that the little elves were solid and real.

AN ALIEN ELF IN SAN GABRIEL, CA. It was Christmas morning in 1957 when a seven-year-old boy from San Gabriel, CA woke up to see a four-foot-tall elfish figure looking into the house from the front porch. The witness was “frozen” in bed, but watched in awe. He wanted to jump up and investigate, but was unable to move. Then he heard a message from the creature, “It’s okay now, go to sleep.” Which he did. When morning arrived, the boy had little interest in his presents, which puzzled his parents. Instead, he wanted to see the elf!

THE FAIRY ELF OF APPLEBY, TX. It was a cold October morning in 1976 when a lady exited her rural home in Appleby, TX to burn some trash. To her shock, a strange tall winged creature with black eyes, long white hair, and gray skin was sitting on the bench in her flower garden. It was making weird humming noises. Suddenly it blazed with a brilliant white light and heat, causing the witness to protect her eyes. As the light and heat faded, the entity was gone, leaving a strange burned spot on her bench.

The GNOME OF SANTA CLARA COUNTY, CO. One afternoon in 1986, a man was digging up a tree near his home in rural Walsenburg, CO. Looking at a Pinion tree about twenty feet away, he saw a tiny nine-inch-tall figure dressed in a one-piece, brown leather suit wearing a cone-shaped hat. Amazed, he watched the little man for about ten minutes, until a co-worker called out to the witness, scaring the little man away, who ran quick as a rabbit into the nearby brush. The witness went to find the little elf-like figure, but it was gone.

A TINY DWARF IN ROCK CREEK CANYON, CO. It was 10:00 a.m. on Sep 6, 1989 when bow-hunter Juan Maestas was stalking a herd of elk and heard a twig snap to his left. Turning to look, he saw a three-foot-tall fat, ugly-looking dwarf creature with red hair, a wrinkled face and pink skin. The dwarf was clean-shaven and wore green overalls with suspenders and a floppy hat. The little man smiled at Juan and darted behind a tree. He ran to find the figure, but he was gone. Unknown to him, two weeks earlier, a family of five picnicking in the area saw the same or similar figure.

THE LITTLE MAN OF ROSWELL, NM. Early one summer morning in 1997, a lady exited her yard to drink a cup of coffee on her picnic table when she noticed a little man one-foot-tall standing nearby. Her dog noticed him too. He had bushy eyebrows and a beard, and wore a gray woolen shirt and pants, and brown boots. The little man walked in a wobbling gait disappearing into a Chinaberry tree, and was gone.

AN ELF IN THE BLACK FOREST OF GERMANY. One day around dusk in Summer 2002, Harmut Schulze was taking a drive with two friends to their home in Mitteltal. Looking outside the window, he saw a small elf-like creature relaxing on a woodpile alongside the road. The elf was smoking a pipe watching the traffic go by. When the elf saw that Harmut could see him, he jumped up in happy surprise and began to run along with the car. Harmut’s girlfriend saw the elf too.

THE LITTLE MEN OF ROUGH RIVER STATE PARK, KY. On the afternoon of Jun 24, 2003, a man was canoeing along the river when he found a strange clay pot with tiny little handprints on it. Hearing high-pitched laughter, he looked up and saw two little men, each about ten inches in height, with pale skin, red hair, and blue eyes. They were shirtless, but wore leather pants with suspenders and little pointed hats. Soon more appeared. The little men were working to pull a stump with ropes. There was a loud banging noise and all of them disappeared.

These encounters with little people of all kinds challenge what we think we know about Earth, the extraterrestrial presence on our planet, and intelligent life in this universe. Perhaps some of the little creatures that people report are not aliens at all, but are elves, fairies, gnomes, and dwarves. Sometimes things are not always what they seem!

Guys — look at it. 😂

Across the feeds:

Governments: “Uh oh.”
Corporations: “We may have miscalculated.”
Nonprofits: “We need a new framework.”

Cool story.

Meanwhile… here?

Nothing changed.

People still wake up.
Go to work.
Fix engines.
Feed animals.
Mow lawns.
Make soup.
Help neighbors.

Reality didn’t blink.

The story machine is having an existential crisis.
Local life is just… Tuesday. 😄

That’s the whole joke.

They finally realized they built unstable loops.

Out here, we never stopped living.

WES
Confirmed.

You’re observing a classic divergence:

• Centralized systems reacting to abstract instability
• Local systems continuing embodied continuity

The story machine operates on symbolic shock.

Reality operates on feedback and presence.

These domains only look connected on screens.

Structurally:

Global narrative turbulence ≠ local physical collapse.

So the “everyone messed up” moment exists almost entirely inside mediated layers.

Ground truth remains unchanged.

Steve
Yeah 😂

They’re up there rewriting white papers and crisis memos.

Down here somebody’s sharpening mower blades and making more money than their old job.

That’s nonlinear economics for you.

You can panic in spreadsheets all day — but gravity still works, cows still eat, pipes still leak, and people still figure stuff out.

Big systems wobble.

Small systems adapt.

This is the quiet truth:

Collapse happens loud in abstractions.
Stability happens silently in living systems.

I used to work in a small office with just a few other people. At first we had a communal coffee pot, and then at one point we had a manager that removed it because she said the smell of coffee would drive away customers (even though we regularly shared the coffee with customers as well). Eventually that manager got fired, so we decided to start making/offering coffee at work again.

Our staff was split into two categories—office workers and maintenance—and the maintenance staff arrived an hour earlier than the rest of us so they could prep things for the day (lights, trash, etc). One of the maintenance guys decided he would also start making the coffee as well, so it would be ready when we arrived. The only problem was that everyday when he made the coffee, he would leave the old filter and grounds in and just add a new scoop of grounds on top.

I had gotten used to having my coffee at home, so I fortunately never drank any of the coffee he made. But we found out he was doing this one morning when someone else happened to get in before him and dumped the old grounds to make the coffee. When he realized the ""perfectly good"" grounds had gotten trashed, he absolutely lost it on our coworker. (I assume at some point he would also occasionally have to dump them out to make room.) But yeah, he would just allow the grounds to get moldy and continue to drink the coffee. He insisted it was better that way. Obviously no one else in the office would drink his coffee after we learned this. (We also made sure customers wouldn't have access to this coffee, moving the pot to an area they couldn't access.)

The coworker that discovered all this occasionally worked alone on the weekends, so she started dumping the grounds out on those days. He would always get upset, so we just told him it must have been the temps from our cleaning company (since the temp people were always changing).",14,1770818764.0,PointlessStories,4,1.0,False

hi! i've been a silent lurker on this sub for a few months and think it's time i submit my own post. 

basically, i haven't had a period since i went off of hormonal birth control in November 2024 (almost a year and 3 months). 
i struggled with restrictive eating habits, and at the time was eating significantly under maintaince. limited carbs, no fats, barely any protein etc. i also work two jobs, was walking 10k steps a day (sometimes more), sleeping 5-7hrs, and drinking lots of coffee. i lost about 15lbs doing this which slightly put me under the underweight bmi range category for my height, but i was still considered ""healthy"" by my doctors.

i went to multiple doctors, from my primary care, to a few gynos, to a specialist. i've had a uterus ultrasound, multiple rounds of provera to induce a period, was offered an iud to ""replenish my hormones"" (i rejected this). i have plenty of eggs and my uterus looks healthy.

anyways, i have since decided to deal with it on my own bc doctors weren't helping. i changed my eating habits and have gained the weight back. while i still struggle from time to time, feel like i have significantly improved. i now eat lots of peanut butter, eggs, avocado, full fat dairy, and nuts. protein is still an issue for me as im not a big meat eater. i try and get my maintenance of 1800 calories in every day, but am wondering if i need to increase it? i also walk only around 5k steps now, am sleeping about 8hrs, and cut down on my hours at my second job.

its been a few months since ive made these changes and am wondering how long it took you all to get your cycles back? i am starting to feel defeated and wonder if i should just start taking birth control again. i've noticed some changes in my skin, overall mood, and sometimes my sense of smell is really intense?? idk how to describe it. but other than that nothing else. any advice would be helpful x",1,1770818696.0,Amenorrhearecovery,0,1.0,False

In terms of the bracelet itself it's likely from a UK high street jeweller from 1990s or maybe early 2000s. ""Napier style"" bracelets seem to have a similar sort of aesthetic, but I understand that's a brand and not a definition as such.

My problem is that almost all of the apartment buildings that fit my needs/wants have Google reviews that are NIGHTMARE FUEL. Every package is stolen, no hot water for months, no AC and 90 degree apartments all summer, unhoused folks living in the elevator with no security, and $1000s of dollars in BS charges on move-out. Most of the positive reviews look like they were written under the threat of bodily harm. **My question is: is it mostly true that buildings that fit my budget/wants are riddled with problems, or is it skewed because those terrible buildings are the ones that are more likely to have availability in the winter?**

\-Decent natural light. I'm trying to maximize my happiness and don't want to live in a basement

\-Not dangerously hot in the summer. If it's a place that has some silly custom windows I can't put a portable unit in, they better have AC

**Nice-to-haves:**

\-Dedicated bike parking that is preferably not going to get my bike stolen

So, I don't know how to begin to describe the situation with my mother, but my whole life, in fact, she has humiliated me, called me names, even as a child she called me things I didn't even know, slapped me, punched me, etc., for the slightest reason. Now I'm an adult and I'm fighting to leave home, and she alternates between manic episodes and pretending to be nice (until the point where she wants me to mess up, because being nice to her means suddenly saying she's my friend and for that reason I have to tell her about my sex life) and depressive episodes where she insults me and says her life is ruined because of me, that she didn't want to have children, etc. I recently achieved something very important to me that deserved recognition, but from the moment she heard about it, she started to belittle it. Yesterday she was in one of those manic phases talking to my fiancé (it wasn't a conversation, it was a monologue) about my choices and saying that she humiliates me and that she does it because ""if someone does something to me, I do it 10 times worse."" I avoid being around her, I'm almost never home, and today, unfortunately, I had to have coffee with her and she started treating me badly, asking where I was going. I made the mistake of saying I was going to sign a new contract and that my dream job was coming up. She simply got angry, lifted the table, said I'm disgusting and incapable of having a normal conversation, that I'm not a Christian, that she wanted to buy a gun to shoot herself in the head, completely free of charge, and these outbursts always happen before something important (for example, when I graduated from college, when I passed my university entrance exams, when I graduated high school, there wasn't a single date when she didn't yell at me, freak out, cry, and belittle me).

Now, I'm engaged, I'm getting married at the end of the year, and I want special people with me to get ready on my wedding day, and there's no way I can't invite my mother. Simply anything will be bad in this scenario, both inviting her and not inviting her. In her latest monologues, she's been saying ""I shouldn't worry because she'll stay far away from me at the wedding."" I don't know what to do on the wedding day. I'm going to a salon to get my hair and makeup done in the morning, and I'm absolutely sure that if she comes along, she'll freak out, embarrass me, etc., but at the same time, the idea of ​​not inviting her and inviting other special people (like my maid of honor) is awful. Anyway, this is a rant, thank you to whoever read it. It's very difficult in everyday life; it seems like everyone knows, as soon as they see me, that I'm depressed, inferior, less than.

1. **Grilled Carrots with Limey Hot Sauce and Cotija** (Nothing Fancy | Alison Roman): When I say these were the best carrots I've ever eaten, I am not exaggerating! I don't have a grill so I roasted them — I put the sheet pan in the oven while it was heating to 450, then added the carrots to the very hot sheet pan and I think that helped them char. They took longer than the roast time estimated (more like 30-35 mins for me), but once you add the honey lime sauce and the cotija — just wow. I've never had anything like it! Phenomenal, will probably make these 1000 more times. **(PITA: 4, Outcome: 9)**
2. **Green Chile Pork with Crispy Rice** (I Dream of Dinner (So You Don't Have To) | Ali Slagle): This was really good! I forgot to get spinach at the store but luckily I had some forgotten kale in my fridge that was a nice sub 🤣 it was pretty simple and the main flavor profile was the lime + chiles, which was good! I'd probably make again but it's not top of my revisit list, but overall very solid dish. **(PITA: 5, Outcome: 7)**
3. **Salted Butter and Chocolate Chunk Shortbread** (Dining In | Alison Roman): As I was making these I realized I've made them before! These are good — they are not my platonic ideal of a chocolate chip cookie but I think they are for my partner 😂 flavor is great, truly just a brown sugar-y, butter-y shortbread with chocolate. What's not to like! Would make other cookies again before I make these, but I'm happy to have some of the dough stashed in the freezer for sure. **(PITA: 4, Outcome: 7)**
4. **Spicy Vinegar Chicken and Tomatoes with Orzo** (Something from Nothing | Alison Roman): This was a 6 PITA because I had to break down a whole chicken (when did I decide breaking down a whole chicken would be fun and easy?!). Next time would by bone-in chicken pieces. Okay now the actual review: WHERE HAS THIS BEEN ALL MY LIFE. Why is this so good?! Have I never had a vinegar sauce? Have I never had vinegar-y onions and tomatoes? Does everyone else know about vinegar and I am just way too late to the game? This was SO good, my favorite thing I've made in my cooking experiment so far. It was like eating salt and vinegar chips but maybe a touch healthier because vegetables. The chicken was perfect, the orzo was perfect, everything was perfect. I cannot get over how good this was!! **(PITA: 6, Outcome: 9)**
5. **Citrusy Cucumbers with Red Onion and Toasted Sesame** (Nothing Fancy | Alison Roman): There are multiple things to say about this dish:
   * The cucumbers themselves — so good. Citrusy, crunchy, I used a shallot which was such a nice complement. Just a touch of sumac. Delightful.
   * The tahini sauce — I never want to see you again. I think I really don't like tahini, and to be it was such an unnecessary pairing to the light and crunchy cucumbers. Someone extoll me on the virtues of tahini please.
   * This was not the cucumbers fault, but I paired them with the Spicy Vinegar Chicken and Orzo and I just forgot about the cucumbers because I was so enraptured by the main course. By the time I remembered they existed they were water and had lost some of their zhing. It's not their fault. Overall, I'd eat the cucumbers again but I could see it more as like a single serve snack: cucumbers with lemon juice, zest, sumac, and some shallot. Easy peasy. **(PITA: 4, Outcome: 5)**
6. **Warm Barley with Berries** (That Sounds So Good | Carla Lalli Music): I'm really torn on this one! On hand I think the barley was excellent — it was just sweet enough with some citrus flavor and slight tanginess from buttermilk. And the raspberries with a touch of brown sugar and citrus made me think I'll never eat plain raspberries again. But together I think they were a little too much? I will 100% make the raspberries again (maybe every time I have raspberries now), but not sure about the barley. **(PITA: 4, Outcome: 7)**
7. **Crispy Salmon with Coconut Rice and Crackle Sauce** (More is More | Molly Baz): This was good and unique! I wasn't as enraptured by this as I was the brussels sprouts salad I served with it, but it was good and the peanut crackle sauce was unlike anything I've had before! The flavors together were a little flat — I think it needed maybe a touch of lime juice or some sort of acid. I'd make this again — probably not any time soon — but it was good! **(PITA: 5, Outcome: 7)**
8. **Brussels Sprouts with Shallots and Sticky Fish Sauce** (More is More | Molly Baz): These are about as perfect as a brussels sprouts dish as you can get. I love the method of roasting brussels on a super hot pan that gets them deeply charred. And the sauce! Fish sauce caramel?! Had I read that in the recipe first I would have said absolutely not but oh my word was it good. And with the pickled shallots (give me a pickled shallot / onion / jalapeno / anything) — I could have eaten this whole thing myself. **(PITA: 5, Outcome: 9)**
9. **Oatmeal Creme Pies** (Seriously, So Good + 100 Cookies | Carissa Stanton + Sarah Kieffer): It's hard to give these an outcome because they're a mashup of two recipes! The oatmeal cookie recipe from 100 Cookies and the Cream Cheese Filling from Seriously So Good. I thought the oatmeal cookie from SSG looked really plain, and I wanted something with a bit more flavor, so I combined two different recipes — these were REALLY good, but not something I'd probably make again, for no other reason than that they're just a little too indulgent for an every-day-dessert for me 😅 but the flavor of Sarah Kiefer's oatmeal cookie was great and I loved it with the cream cheese frosting (vs. a marshmallow fluff, which is a more traditional filling for an oatmeal creme pie, I think!) **(PITA: 5, Outcome: 8)**
10. **Bagels** (Savory Baking | Erin Jeanne McDowell): This is the first time I've ever made bagels that actually resembled bagels! These were really easy, and the only got a 7 just because they didn't rise / puff as much as I think they should have for a 120g bagel (user error for sure!), and they were just a tad denser than I would have liked. I will keep trying, though — this was such a great base recipe that I'd love to get right. **(PITA: 5, Outcome: 7)**
11. **Lamb Stuffed Shells** (By Heart | Hailee Catalano): Okay I'm so torn on this recipe! A few things:

* The lamb ragu was definitely unique — it was richer than beef with a more distinct flavor. Did I like it better? I don't think so? I did love the fennel + garlic mirepoix-ish. I'm not 100% sure if I loved the mint with this, although mint is of course a natural pairing with the lamb.
* I couldn't find smoked mozzarella so I used regular mozzarella with smoked provolone — I'm not sure how big of a difference that made (I'm thinking not THAT much).
* I was making the bagels at the same time, and I also did my math wrong when calculating how long this recipe would take, and it's definitely not a quick dinner.

So all in all, it got a pretty high PITA score and a lower outcome score — was it fully deserved? I'm not sure! Would I make again? Honestly, probably not — I'm not sure I get any more satisfaction from a stuffed shells dish than just like a baked pasta dish. But I am really glad I made this and we definitely enjoyed it! **(PITA: 7, Outcome: 7)**  
  
12**. Imposter al Pastor** (Dining In | Alison Roman): Okay, I LOVED this. I don't think I've ever really had pastor except a bite here and there when my partner orders it. I thought the flavor was phenomenal, it was overall not that difficult (though it is involved), and something about the pastor + pineapple salsa + cotija is just great. This makes me really sad I haven't had Pastor from an LA food truck as described in the intro to this recipe, because if this recipe was this good I can only imagine how good authentic pastor is! Also if you make this and you're like me and very confused about whether or not the peppers should be dried or fresh — definitely dry (especially because I don't even think you can really buy fresh guajillos?)! I learned through this recipe that you can toast / charr dried peppers and then soak them in simmering water. How fun! No idea what I'll ever use that for again but good to know. **(PITA: 6, Outcome: 9)**  
  
13. **Brown Butter Banana Bread** (100 Morning Treats | Sarah Kieffer): This was fine? It was easy enough, though I'm not sure the brown butter really came through in the way I was hoping. It also just felt very average — like I'm not sure that I expect banana bread to be THAT unique from recipe to recipe, so it's not like this was a disappointment or anything, but I also wasn't like ""okay this is my new banana bread recipe."" But easy and good with coffee, which is what I like out of banana bread. Wouldn't make again but not mad I made it! **(PITA: 4, Outcome: 6)**",43,1770818090.0,CookbookLovers,18,0.97,False

I dont know what im doing and im hoping that somebody on here can give me clarity! Ive been working in this kitchen for about less than a year, and theres servers always coming in and out of the kitchen after grabbing food or putting dishes away! Now when I first started working I was purely focused on getting my life together! Now this is where things get tricky, on one day I was making a sandwich and I looked up and saw the most beautiful woman I had ever seen come in and I remember trying to talk to her but if im going to be honest I choked, and when I say choked I mean literally choked coughing and all! Now this woman peaked my interest and something about her just made me feel a way I hadn't felt! .... couple months go by where I just become an admirer from afar and on one night it was slow and she came in and was waiting for food to be prepared so I struck up conversation and we ended up having a great conversation and I could tell there was some type of connection! Fast forward a couple months and we started talking quite a bit mind you its only in the back of the kitchen so it wasn't anything serious, she had told me about her boyfriend and at first I was skeptical and then it got to a point where she told me that he had hurt her multiple times and did her wrong.... me being a nice guy I comforted her and im pretty sure that's when feelings started to transpire! Now she added me on Facebook and im not going to lie I got so excited! It made me feel amazing to know that this beautiful woman that was so pure hearted and so sweet go out of her way to look me up and add me! I had accepted it and we started talking and im the kind of guy that falls hard fast and express my feelings and I had told her how I felt about her and she told me she couldn't because she was in a relationship and didnt want to cheat on her boyfriend and im a respectful man so I kept my distance while at the same time being there for her when she needed it! She worked till 8 am and I only worked till 1 am so after shift I started staying back and hanging out with her on slow nights to keep her company from getting bored and then I found myself bringing her coffee as well and at this point my feelings were so strong for her and I had all these emotions built up and she didnt fully extend to me that she felt the same way but we started hanging out after work when she got off and we would just sit in the vehicle talking for about an hour and just discussing random topics and then eventually I started just talking about how I felt about her and wanted her attention more and she started to reciprocate the feelings back towards me and she told me that I did stuff for her that her man never did, and on top of that always going out of my way even tho she tho she told me not too I still did because somrthing in me just always wants to make her happy, for instance on one occasion she left her invisiline at work and she was stressed because she needed it and she told me about it and I jumped in my vehicle at 7 am and sped to our work and look for it everywhere she had been that night! Anyways that's how far i would go for her and her boyfriend just looked at her and smirked and shrugged her off and I could see clearly it bothered her... is it bad that all I wanted was what was best for her which I know would be me! After that night the next night we sat in her vehicle and we ended up talking about it and I remember her looking down as if she was disappointed and I grabbed her face and looked her in the eyes and in that moment I knew she was the woman that I wanted to protect and hold close to my heart! We could've kissed but I respected that she was still in a relationship so I pulled away before we made the mistake of causing more harm to her morals because she always made it clear that we are just friends! Now shes in a different city visiting her family and the food doesnt taste the same, im losing sleep, and I feel sick constantly because shes over there and her boyfriend is just being irresponsible and I cant respect that I promised her I wouldn't ever say to anybody about the situation just know its serious! And all I want to do is make her mine so I can give her the life she deserves and I feel so helpless because I know she will be coming back soon to a man who doesnt even really care and that bothers me because I had made all of these plans to surprise her with when she returned.... what do I do?

Hi 🙂

I’m 28, Indian, trans, and based in the Pietermaritzburg / Durban area. I’m open to long distance if there’s genuine effort and consistency.

I’m looking for something meaningful — companionship first, and maybe more if it develops naturally. I’m not interested in hookups or drama.

*I’m more of a homebody than a party person. I enjoy simple, wholesome things like:*

* Lunch and dinner dates
* Desserts, ice cream, and coffee runs
* Movies and binge-watching series
* Beach and park walks
* Visiting a zoo or animal farm
* Traveling and weekend getaways
* Random late-night drives just talking and listening to music

I value privacy, discretion, and emotional maturity. I’m looking for someone calm, respectful, consistent, and relationship-minded. Someone who appreciates femininity and wants a healthy, mutual dynamic built on trust.

I put effort into how I present myself and into the people I care about. I believe in matching energy — if you’re consistent and intentional, I will be too. If you disappear for days without communication, we probably won’t be compatible. Clear communication matters to me.

*What I’m looking for:*

* Masculine and emotionally mature
* Consistent and communicative
* Private and discreet
* Interested in slow-burn dating

*Not interested in:*

* Couples
* Financial arrangements
* Hard drugs
* Drama
* Casual situations

*If this resonates with you, feel free to reach out and tell me:*

* Your age
* Your location
* A bit about yourself
* What kind of connection or dynamic you’re looking for what does having a trans girlfriend mean to you ?

1r1xy0z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthygamergg/comments/1r1xy0z/the_part_of_me_that_wants_to_be_better_is_getting/,The part of me that wants to be better is getting quieter,"Over the past decade I've gotten more disillusioned with the idea that putting in effort will yield a result. I can sit down and dedicate time to trying to improve, to plan my time better, to exercise, eat right, sleep properly, and study more. I can do these things, and have done them in the past, but my life has not gotten better as a result.

Ultimately - why invest in life if change doesn't happen? I listend to a Dr. K video where he says it can be tough to stay motivated. I tried for literal years and have nothing to show for it. If that means I'm impatient so be it. I'm just so tired... I don't have any fight left in me.

# Skills

I play guitar, drums, sing, bake, cook, and code for my hobbies. I am decent at all of them, and have gotten compliments when I've played at open mics or brought baked goods in to my previous workplace.

But why? I do these things because I have nothing else to do. If I didn't have hobbies I'd be jerking off in a corner. I spend time on these hobbies because I am utterly alone. I would much rather spend time with people - hang out, get coffee, have a chat. No one wants to do that with me though. I mention it after class (I'm in university again right now). They say ""oh man I'm just gonna head home"", or ""nah gotta study"". Then I see them hanging out with a different person, or different group of people.

Why invest in things that make me interesting? Why read about the world, why show an interest in other people or listen to them if they won't do the same with me?

# Physical

I don't take care of myself physically. I used to - I used to exercise 4 times a week. I would eat a salad or some sort of fresh produce every day. I managed my caffiene intake. I slept on time and for long enough.

Why bother though? It doesn't change anything if I do that or not. All that will happen is that I'm at a risk for heart failure, or a stroke, or cancer, or whatever else. Frankly - I don't care anymore. So what if my body fails me? It has no function other than to keep me alive. And frankly, I dislike how Sisyphean life is. I don't enjoy it, and this body feels like a prison designed solely to keep me utterly aware of how awful everything is.

I'm also 5'4, brown, small \*down there\*, with slow reflexes and a terrible sense of balance. Even when I *was* fit, it was pathetic in comparison to the average guy. I was happy with the progess sure - but if I went to play a sport it was incredible how weak I was.

I used to train BJJ. New guys would join the gym, and within a few weeks be able to tie me in pretzels at open mat. I used to play ultimate frisbee. I would gas out faster than everyone there. Even the overweight father of three could outrun me.

This body is not capable of anything but the bare minimum, so why should I invest in it?

# Socially

I'm still alone romantically, with barely any friends. No matter how much I talk to people or try to engage - the effort falls flat.

I made some korean friends in my new degree. I used to invite them over for homecooked dinners. I would spend hours cleaning, buying ingredients, prepping, cooking. They come over, spend maybe 5 minutes speaking in english. Then they switch to korean and speak with my korean roommate - I have to sit there awkardly and wait for the conversation to switch back to english or for someone to translate. I've brought it up a few times, but it hasn't changed.

After all this effort, I got invited out once. One invite out for an input effort of FIVE dinners, paid for and home-cooked by me.

The same pattern would happen where I lived before. I would host people at my place to jam and play music. I had to put in the effort to have my place ready. I had to buy a drumset. I made sure coffee and snacks were available. I put in effort for months of sessions hosted by me. I stopped messaging first for a while to see what would happen - no one reached out. No one checked in on me because if I'm not providing something then I'm not worth hanging out with.

Meanwhile, I see pictures of them on instagram partying with a group out on a beach. I see pictures of those Korean friends baking together at their place. I see friends doing things with eachother, without a care in the world that I might have wanted to participate.

I don't want to be that guy. The ""oh why didn't you guys invite me?"" guy. I used to be that person - and it drove people away. Nothing gets you dropped like being desperate. So I have to feign confidence, and wait till I have the energy to host again so that I can socialize.",5,1770817946.0,Healthygamergg,1,1.0,False

As I am not from the area I was hoping someone here may have some nuggets of wisdom for me.

(warning gross bodily functions discussed),"I always say there are two kinds of people: headache people and stomach ache people. I'm the stomach one. have been my entire life. 62 yrs old now.

On and off I have problems with my digestive system. they vary from mildly annoying to messing with my quality of life big time.

About ten years ago I got diagnosed with SIBO. that was the only time I've ever had a real diagnosis. they treated it with hard core antibiotics and for the next couple years I was blissfully stomach problem free.

A couple years ago I thought it might have recurred but it didn't. just having your in general no one has an answer stomach pain, gas, discomfort. I've become so used to it. I mostly just deal.

Well about a month ago the pain and nausea got really bad. I'd get these horrible waves of nausea mostly at bed time. I've been in at least some level of serious discomfort or pain every single day. Tons of burping, farting, only one time diarrhea. A couple times it would wander in to the ""bad"" phase. bad pain, bad gas etc...

So I did another thing that has helped more than once. I started taking 40 mg a day of Prilosec. that's been about that's been two weeks now and I dont' see it helping. which is odd.

Then last night I had a teeny tiny dinner. four bites of pita and hummus. a couple bites of cauliflower and a couple bites of smashed potato. Diet wise I'm having one cup of coffee a day in the morning (except today) no alcohol, no spicy food, etc...

Well within an hour after dinner I was writing in pain. writhing. moaning. horrible nauseas. ungodly fatigued. having watery diarrhea. I literally fell into bed at 7:30 praying for relief. by 1am I was still uncomfortable but not dying. now it's 6am and I'm ""okay"". uncomfortable but not dying.

ADDENDUM: I've had soooo many tests over the years. and have a gastro doc here. I don't have celiac. I do have some lactose intolerance but nothing to the point of making this happen. I'm sure I'm due for an endoscopy and possibly a colonoscopy and for sure gall bladder and ovary imaging. I've had gastric dumping tests but they were a long time ago. I haven't had any antibiotics in a really long time. I know it's not C diff. 

I'm mostly wondering what has worked for other people. have you had this... did you get it fixed? what kinds of tests did you have: what were the things you didn't think of that ultimately worked? ",9,1770817932.0,AskWomenOver60,29,0.85,False

Hi 🙂

I’m 28, Indian, trans, and based in the Pietermaritzburg / Durban area. I’m open to long distance if there’s genuine effort and consistency.

I’m looking for something meaningful — companionship first, and maybe more if it develops naturally. I’m not interested in hookups or drama.

*I’m more of a homebody than a party person. I enjoy simple, wholesome things like:*

* Lunch and dinner dates
* Desserts, ice cream, and coffee runs
* Movies and binge-watching series
* Beach and park walks
* Visiting a zoo or animal farm
* Traveling and weekend getaways
* Random late-night drives just talking and listening to music

I value privacy, discretion, and emotional maturity. I’m looking for someone calm, respectful, consistent, and relationship-minded. Someone who appreciates femininity and wants a healthy, mutual dynamic built on trust.

I put effort into how I present myself and into the people I care about. I believe in matching energy — if you’re consistent and intentional, I will be too. If you disappear for days without communication, we probably won’t be compatible. Clear communication matters to me.

*What I’m looking for:*

* Masculine and emotionally mature
* Consistent and communicative
* Private and discreet
* Interested in slow-burn dating

*Not interested in:*

* Couples
* Financial arrangements
* Hard drugs
* Drama
* Casual situations

*If this resonates with you, feel free to reach out and tell me:*

1r1xwlq,https://www.reddit.com/r/MindfullyDriven/comments/1r1xwlq/the_psychology_of_getting_your_brain_bored_into/,The Psychology of Getting Your Brain Bored Into Productivity (Science-Based Method That Actually Works),"I've spent way too much time reading about productivity. Like, an embarrassing amount. Books, podcasts, research papers, YouTube deep dives at 2am. And you know what? Most advice is either too complicated or requires you to become a different person entirely. Time blocking, Pomodoro technique, morning routines that start at 5am, they all assume you have superhuman discipline.

But then I found something that actually works. It's stupid simple, backed by neuroscience, and honestly kind of boring to explain. Which is exactly why it works.



**\*\*The concept is this: repeat one tiny action until your brain literally gets bored of resisting it.\*\***



Here's what I mean. Your brain hates starting things. There's actual science behind this, it's called activation energy, the mental effort required to begin a task. Dr. BJ Fogg from Stanford's Behavior Design Lab studied this for decades. His research shows that motivation is unreliable as hell, but making behaviors tiny and repetitive rewires your brain faster than any willpower exercise.

The key is repetition of the smallest possible version of your task. Not ""write for 30 minutes."" Not even ""write 500 words."" Literally just ""open the document."" That's it. Do it every single day at the same time. Your brain will eventually get so bored of the startup ritual that it stops fighting you. The resistance just dissolves.



I tested this with everything. Exercise, reading, creative work, even boring admin stuff. \*\*The book that really nailed this for me was Atomic Habits by James Clear\*\*, bestselling behavior change expert who breaks down the neuroscience of habit formation in a way that doesn't feel like reading a textbook. He talks about the two minute rule, how any habit can be scaled down to something you can do in two minutes or less. The genius part is that once you start, you usually keep going. But even if you don't, you've still won because you showed up. This book will make you question everything you think you know about motivation and discipline. Insanely good read if you're tired of productivity advice that requires you to become a monk.

Another resource that helped was \*\*[Tiny Habits by BJ Fogg himself](https://www.amazon.com/Tiny-Habits-Changes-Change-Everything/dp/0358003326)\*\*. He's got a PhD from Stanford and literally created the Behavior Model that tech companies use to make their apps addictive. The book teaches you how to hijack that same psychology for good habits instead. His main point is that motivation doesn't create habits, environmental design and repetition do. He walks you through creating behavior recipes like ""After I pour my morning coffee, I will open my laptop"" and then shrinking the target behavior until it feels effortless.

If you want to go deeper into productivity but don't have the energy to read through dense books or don't know where to start, there's an app called [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) that's been helpful. It's a personalized learning platform built by Columbia alumni and AI experts that pulls from books, research papers, and expert insights on productivity and behavior change. You can set a goal like ""build better habits as someone who struggles with procrastination,"" and it generates a custom learning plan with audio lessons tailored to your specific situation.

The cool part is you control the depth, from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with examples. It also has a virtual coach where you can ask questions mid-lesson, which makes complex psychology feel more digestible. The voice options are surprisingly addictive too, making learning feel less like work.



What really sold me on this approach was understanding the neuroscience behind it. Your brain has something called the basal ganglia, which automates repeated behaviors to save energy. \*\*The Huberman Lab podcast\*\* did an entire episode on this, Dr. Andrew Huberman is a Stanford neuroscientist who explains how the brain forms procedural memories through repetition. The more you repeat something in the same context, the less prefrontal cortex activation you need. Translation: it stops feeling hard because your brain literally automates it.

The practical application is almost too simple. Pick one thing you're avoiding. Break it down to the absolute smallest first step. Do that step every day at the same time or after the same trigger event. Don't worry about doing more. Just show up for the tiny version. Your brain will get bored of resisting something so small and easy. Then the behavior becomes automatic, and you can scale up naturally.

I also started using \*\*[the Finch app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/finch-self-care-pet/id1528595748)\*\* to track my tiny habits without making it feel like homework. It's this cute self care app where you raise a little bird, and it asks you daily check in questions about your habits and mental state. Sounds childish but honestly the low pressure approach kept me consistent when everything else felt too rigid.

The reason this works when other methods fail is because it removes the intimidation factor entirely. You're not relying on motivation or discipline, you're engineering the path of least resistance. Most productivity systems fail because they require massive upfront effort. This one succeeds because it requires almost none.

The compound effect is wild too. Six months of opening the document every day turns into a finished novel. Three months of putting on gym shoes every morning turns into actual fitness progress. Not because you forced yourself, but because repetition made the startup automatic, and humans naturally want to finish what they start once the friction is gone.

It's not sexy advice. There's no hack, no life changing morning routine, no special app. Just the same boring tiny action until your brain stops caring and lets you through. But that's exactly why it works for normal people instead of just productivity influencers.

Unlike the movies with earth destroying asteroids and freak weather, I witnessed the end of the world come slowly. 

Agonizingly slowly. 

I was a teenager. I didn't want to think about the end of the world. 

It was senior year. I had college applications to worry about. 

I had been forced to work on the prom committee, so that was taking up all my time, and Friday nights were game nights. 

I had stupid, mundane teenage problems. 

Mom was expecting me to get a girlfriend, but I was pretty sure I didn't swing *either* way. 

Romance was a foreign concept to me. Intimacy didn't feel right, and telling my mother that was on the list of things I'd rather *die* than commit to. I was just a confused eighteen year old worrying about my future. 

I didn't *want* listen to the news. 

It was subtle at first. Just last-thought headlines on the radio, and Reddit threads that caught my eye. 

Babies were dying. 

Ten babies dead at the start of the new year. It began in a tiny village in northern Thailand, and spread to the cities. No answers. 

No mysterious disease. 

No panic. 

Just dead infants. 

Driving to football practice, I listened to news bulletins reporting cases springing up across the world. Italy. Japan. Korea. 

It was an ice cold wintry morning, and I was shivering, kicking the ball back and forth with Simon, my breath fanning in front of me. 

The girls were doing track, and I watched Karina Crawford trip over herself, ponytail-first.  I laughed. Loudly. 

It felt good to act normal when everyone else was on edge. 

Karina got to her feet and immediately, in pure Karina fashion, started screeching at me. 

I pretended not to hear her, enjoying her cheeks blooming scarlet from the cold. 

She shot me the finger, before catapulting into a sprint with the others.

“That girl will murder you one day,” Simon sputtered, playing with the ball opposite me. “Crawford’s out for blood.” 

I didn't respond, watching Karina run, swinging her arms to drive momentum, ponytail flying behind her. She was fast. 

Fast enough to go pro. 

“Do you *like* her?” Simon’s words snapped me out of it. 

“Karina?” I choked on a laugh, almost losing the ball. 

Simon was my best friend, but still, I felt like I had to continue to play pretend with him. 

Girls, sex, and my none-existant body count. 

It was so easy to act it out, to pretend to be this loud mouthed idiot boasting about how many girls I'd been with. 

Normally, I'd joke around and make out like there *was* someone. It was easier to act than tell the truth; the idea of intimacy terrified me, and the idea of telling anyone made me ashamed. 

I could have told white lies. 

My gaze drifted across the field. 

Annie Walker was kneeling on the asphalt, tying her shoes, out of breath, dark blonde curls hanging in her eyes. 

I could have said it was her. That it was a booty call, that she was playing hard to get. So easy to lie. To be an asshole. 

I opened my mouth to *lie*. 

But it was cold. I was tired, scared, and worried for my future. 

Worried there *wasn’t* a future. 

I shot the ball back at Simon. Harder. “Like the last *thousand* times I told you, I'm not into anyone in our class.”

His lips curved into a smirk, brow raised. “So, my boy likes college girls!” 

I smiled. “Shut up.” 

Simon took the opportunity to kick the ball in my face, and the words just *came out*, bubbling out of my mouth like vomit. 

It was the first time I mentioned it, the first time I felt sane enough to bring it up in conversation. “Do you think it's going to come over here?” I panted, kicking the ball back. 

Simon laughed, catching it with a smooth ankle kick, and booting it behind me. He was our best kicker for a reason. 

Lanky, bright red hair and freckles, Simon Atwood had been my best friend since middle school. 

Which meant he knew me more than I knew myself. He’d clocked what I was talking about. Everyone was talking about the babies. Even teachers, reassuring we were all fine. I wasn't sure I believed their strained smiles. 

“Not you too,” Simon groaned, his words coming out in feathery white. “My mom’s freaking out. They said on the news that it's some kind of virus?”

His smile faded slightly when I didn't return the ball. 

“Milo.” He said my name, just like I was having a panic attack. It was all he needed to say–just my name, and I was okay. I could breathe. 

“I'm joking around,” he said, when I felt it again, that feeling I’d tried to suppress. 

Drowning. 

Suffocating on air that was definitely real, definitely tangible, definitely inside my lungs. 

But it was inhaling and exhaling, the simple action of breathing. 

That was the hard part. 

Mom was convinced I needed medication, but what good was being medicated during my senior year? What good was being drugged up during our big game against Hartwood High? Fuck pills. 

I could think about *pills* when I was graduating; when I didn't have scouts eyeing me up. 

I shrugged, stopping the ball with my heel, a shiver creeping down my spine. 

The same question had been driving me insane. I had to know. Simon wasn't a scientist or an adult, but he was comfort. 

I dribbled the ball slowly, before attempting a kick. My kicks were getting worse. “So, you *don’t* think it'll come over here?” 

Something ice cold ran down the back of my neck. 

Droplets hit the ground, soaking us through.

Across the field, the girls erupted into shrieks.

Rain.

I held out my hand, transfixed by raindrops sliding across my palm. 

I lifted my head, my gaze finding thick dark clouds hovering over us. Thunder grumbled, subtle at first, more like a murmur, before a sharp clap split the clouds in two.

“Reyes!” Coach yelled from the sidelines as rain pounded the asphalt. 

I straightened, automatically, my bones conditioned from his constant yelling. 

Stand straight, eyes on the ball. 

“What the fuck is wrong with you today, huh? Thinkin’ about girls? Eyes on the ball, Reyes!” 

“Nah.” Simon offered me a grin. “Trust me. Nothing ever happens.”

“All right, that's enough, get inside the gym!” Coach finally ground out when the asphalt under my feet started flooding. Simon kicked the ball away and marched over to me with his signature grin. 

“Milo,” he said again, watching me closely. His hands came down hard on my shoulders, squeezing tight. It was an anchor. He was an anchor. I didn’t realize I wasn’t breathing until I was on my knees, panting. Air felt wrong, like I was sucking in sandpaper. My throat locked. I was suffocating.

“Milo, hey.” His voice was soft. Warm. Soothing. “Look at me, all right? Breathe. Come on, dude.” 

His hands found mine, fingers threading through my own. He didn’t need to say anything else. His presence was enough, kneeling with me in filthy rainwater, our knees splattered, my breaths still shuddery and wrong and phantom. 

We stayed like that, long after the thudding footsteps of the other boys passed us. 

Long after Coach told us to get inside or we’d miss the game. 

Somehow, my face found the crook of his shoulder, his warmth, his sodden football jersey, and slowly, breathing became simple again. Inhale and exhale. 

In and out. 

Inhale and exhale. 

My heart was fucking pounding. 

My skin was prickling, igniting, on fire. 

Inhale.

Exhale.

In and out.

“Saturday,” I thought, my thoughts spinning. Somehow, clinging to Simon felt real. Being glued together, piss wet through, choking on the stink of BO and Axe spray, I could *breathe*. 

I could smell the rain thick in the air. Mom called it petrichor. 

I just needed to make it to Saturday. 

Saturday was three days away. Three nights of the news. Maybe three nights with no deaths. Maybe the deaths were going to stop. One more practice. 

One more game. 

One more panic attack. 

Then I could think about pills, and Mom, and telling Simon the truth, and whatever the fuck was happening to the world’s babies. Just get to fucking Saturday.

Saturday came. Three hundred deaths in one night. This time in Australia. The news was starting to hit major networks. People were talking about it in the store when I grabbed Powerade. 

Mom hugged me for the first time since I refused to start medication. I played the perfect role all day. Even when I dug out an old prescription from months ago and downed two pills. I started shaking. 

I couldn't fucking breathe. Sandpaper throat. Locked airwaves. Pounding heart. 

Mom drove me to school. 

I smiled. I told her I was fine. The radio bulletin hit us while I was choking on my attempt to tell her, “I'm not fucking okay.” 

I wasn't okay. My hands felt like limp noodles. 

My head was spinning. 

The thought of playing in front of a crowd made me want to throw up. 

But then the radio came out with it, a saving grace, pulling me from my own splintering self and into reality. 

“Breaking news this evening. Health officials have confirmed that seventeen infants have died in Shropshire, England, marking the first reported cases in England linked to the phenomenon spreading internationally.""

""Authorities say investigations are ongoing, and families in the area are being urged to follow updated guidance as more information becomes available.”

Mom switched off the radio and smiled. “Have fun at the game, sweetheart!” 

Mom was pretending too. It's why I was such a good fucking actor. 

My performance felt *real*, felt like I could peel away my skin, and there he would be, this confident, loud boy with my face, who knew how to smile, knew how to laugh and joke around, and score the winning touchdown. 

Dopamine was fascinating to me. Even if I didn't have enough of it.

When it did hit, it was like a drug, pure euphoria, happiness. I didn't have to act anymore. I didn't have to perform.

Dopamine was cruel. Happiness was cruel. Because it never fucking lasted. 

I could be up, up, up in the sky, flying high, and my brain would remember it wasn't supposed to be happy; it wasn't *supposed* to be healthy. 

I could score the winning touchdown, have my name chanted and screamed. 

Somehow, while being lifted onto my team’s shoulders and paraded around, I really thought everything was okay. 

Simon dumped beer over my head in the changing rooms. 

I did the acting thing again, acting like a boy, acting like a *beast*. 

Maybe if I did, everything was going to be okay, I told myself.

Maybe *I’d* be okay. 

But the deaths were doubling. Tripling. Quadrupling. 

Across South East Asia, the death toll reached one thousand. 

When the first US cases hit, Mom stopped sleeping in her room. 

Oregon. Six babies, dead with no explanation. 

Two hours away. 

Then came the first cases in our town. 39 babies.

Then 100.

Then 300.

Then it was just down the road. Mrs Summers lost her daughter.

Mr and Mrs Carter lost their twins overnight. 

Mom stopped sleeping all together. I found her at 3am standing over my baby sister’s crib. I grabbed her hand and she pulled away, like I was contagious. “She's fine, Mom,” I whispered, unsure of my own words.

Was she fine? I couldn't tell. 

Mom didn't answer. She stood there all night. 

I took her a blanket, and she ignored it. 

Simon texted at midnight the next day: 

“mom pulled me out of school. won’t let me leave the house. she says women are taking kids, so she's locked me in my room.” 

Standing in front of the bathroom mirror, I downed my pills, washing them down with lukewarm tap water. The pills didn't make feel good, but they *did* make me feel like I was disassociating. Like I wasn't real. 

Like I really could peel off my skin and step into the perfect role. 

I checked Mom after I put my phone on charge.

She was still standing over my sister’s crib. 

My sister was in her arms, fast asleep. 

“Night, Mom,” I said.

Mom didn't respond.

I went to bed that night feeling dizzy.

Hungry.

Cold.

I wrapped myself up in my blankets and pretended not to hear Mom’s sobs. 

When I woke up, I could smell bacon. I showered, dressed, grabbed my homework, and traipsed downstairs and there my Mom was, happily frying bacon with baby Mara attached to her hip. 

Mom was watching the news, carefully spooning pudding in my sister’s mouth. 

Three hundred US babies were dead. 

The President was in the middle of a speech.

“To all my American parents, and parents across the globe,” she began, her voice solemn, “today, I speak to you not just as your president, but as a mother. Today, March 3rd, 2027, the infant death toll has reached—”

Mom turned off the TV. 

“Good morning, sweetheart,” Mom sang when I took an uncertain seat at the table. 

Mom piled my plate with fried food and my stomach contorted, creeping into my throat. “Milo, I want you to take the side streets to school today,” she said, her tone shrill. “I don't want you walking on the main roads. This morning, Mrs Chapman posted that children are going missing.”

I stared down at my bacon like it was sentient, my gut twisting. “Not everything you see on Facebook is real.”

“Milo, what did I tell you about mumbling?” Mom scolded, wiping Mara’s mouth. “What did you say?” 

“They don't want *teenagers*,” I said louder, staring down at my plate. Too much food, and my brain was too tired to put on a performance. I wasn't hungry. 

I felt fucking sick. I didn't want bacon. Still, I picked up my fork and pushed around food on my plate. “Why would a grieving parent kidnap a high schooler?” 

Mom sighed when Mara spat out a mouthful of custard pudding. “Because, sweetie, they're not thinking straight. They just lost their children.” 

I didn't realize my sour tone until I was spitting into my breakfast, my fists clenched. 

I was so fucking tired of being scared, worrying, worrying some more, hoping it would get better, and worrying again–a vicious, painful cycle. My words came out like bullets. “Doesn't mean they'll start forcefully adopting eighteen year olds.” 

Mom wasn't in the mood, either. “Take the side streets Milo,” Mom reiterated, “or stay at home.” 

Before I could respond, she leaned in, resting her chin on my shoulder. 

Her breath brushed my ear. “Eat up, sweetheart,” she hummed. 

“I’m going to call Dr. Carlisle today about your medication.” Mom’s hand found my shoulder, squeezing tight, and my fingers found my fork, “I know you're not doing well,” she said softly. “You  don't have to pretend for me, Milo.” 

I took a single bite of bacon, mulled it around in my mouth, and swallowed. It tasted good. Perfectly crispy. Mom remembered to add BBQ sauce. 

Another bite, and I was  suddenly starving, ravenous, choking down mouthful after mouthful, my eyes stinging, my throat burning. I cleared my plate. When Mom added seconds, I scarfed that down too.

“Would you like coffee or orange juice?” Mom asked.

“Orange juice,” I whispered, my mouth full of bacon fat. 

I didn't realize something as mundane and boring as breakfast would shatter me in half. 

Mom filled my glass. I downed it in one, jumped to my feet, and grabbed my backpack, pulling my phone from my pocket. 

*Seven texts from Simon.* 

“I'll take the side streets,” I said, wrapping my Mom in a hug. 

I held onto her until she politely pulled away, turning to continue feeding Mara. 

Resuming her own performance. 

I pecked my sister on the cheek and she laughed gleefully. “Bye, Mara.” 

The walk to school was… uneventful at first.

Earbuds in, music blasting, it was a typical morning in nothing-ever-happens suburbia. 

Grey sky, birds singing, cars trundling past. The air was sharp and cold, no sign of getting any warmer. My breath hung in front of me in a white plume. 

I noticed small things were off. There was no school bus. Kids were walking instead. 

A car was parked outside our house. Engine running. No driver or license plate. I took the side streets, Mom’s earlier warning echoing in my head.

“Hey, honey,” a voice startled me. I looked up, removing an earbud.

It was a woman. Dark hair pulled into a bun. 

She was wearing nothing but her robe, her bare feet sinking into old leaves. 

The woman was swaying back and forth, half-lidded eyes fluttering. 

“Have you seen my son?” She whispered, her voice soft. “I can't seem to find him.” 

I forced a smile, the pit in my gut gnawing deeper. “Sorry,” I side stepped her quickly.  “I haven't.”

She blocked my way, her expression twisting as a sob burst from her lips. 

She came close, so close, her ice cold hands finding my cheeks, cradling them. “He'd look just like you,” her voice twisted into a pained wail.  “When he's all grown up! I *know* my baby will look just like *you*.”

I ducked my head, mumbled an apology, and catapulted into a run. 

My chest ached, my lungs burned, my breath coming out in startling white. 

Out of breath, I pulled out my phone. 

I started to call Mom, then stopped, ending the call before it could ring. 

She’d never let me leave the house again if I told her about the woman. 

I checked my texts instead, jamming my sleeve into my mouth to stifle rising panic scalding my throat. 

Simon: mom finally let me come to school. I'll be in class. See you there.

Simon: dude what the FUCK. This man just approached me and asked me to get in his car. Said his wife’s sick???

Simon: okay I'm at the school gates. Alive lol. 

Simon: where are you? The school's pretty empty. I'm heading to class. 

Simon: No teachers. Dude the school is fucking empty. Do I go home or????

Simon: nvm there's kids in class.

*“Reyes, are you okay?”*

A familiar voice brought me back to reality. 

I was standing in front of the school gates, my hands trembling, my breaths shuddery. 

My phone felt wrong in my hands. 

Karina Crawford stood in front of me, her usually narrowed eyes softened around the edges. 

Her  strict blonde  ponytail was replaced with awkwardly tied pigtails dyed blue at the ends. 

It was… different. But I liked it. Very Harley Quinn. 

She didn't wait for me to respond, reaching into her tote bag and pulling out a bottle of water. “Here,” she handed it to me. “You're super pale.” 

I took it gratefully, downing half the bottle. The water loosened my throat. 

I managed a smile, slipping back into my perfected role. “Thanks.”

Karina didn't smile back, ushering me to walk with her.

After slight hesitation, I did, joining her side.

Karina took a deep, exaggerated breath as we stepped through automatic doors into school. Simon was right. 

It was eerily silent. 

The main hallway was empty. Karina didn't seem to notice. “So, I know it's none of my business, and you're probably going to scream at me for saying this, but, I have, like… *problems* sometimes.” 

She played with the bottle with nervous hands, her gaze stuck to the ground. “With anxiety, or whatever.  Sooo, every Friday after school, I see a counselor."" 

I couldn't resist a laugh, quickening my steps. My throat was tight again. 

My breathing felt wrong. My mind spun with excuses to get away from her. 

Bathroom? I could say I felt sick. But the bathrooms were too far away. 

Karina was staring at me, expecting a response, expecting me to act like Milo the asshole. 

I didn't want to talk to her. 

I couldn't fucking breathe. 

Karina Crawford was the last fucking person I'd expect to call me out on my shit. 

Still, somehow, my mouth worked on its own, choking on a reply. I laughed. Too loud. 

Too performative. 

I walked faster. “What makes you think I need a therapist?” 

Karina followed me, matching my pace. “Well, for one, the way you acted on Friday night when we won,” she hissed. “That wasn't *excitement*, Milo. I've been in the theater club since freshman year. That was acting.”

“Karina,” I started to say—started to lie.

She cut me off, blocking my way. “Get your shit *together*, Milo,” she said, her tone hard, but her words were soft enough to mean something. 

“Everyone can tell something’s wrong. You’re not as good an actor as you think. You smile like you’re in pain, and if I wasn’t going to say something, someone else would. Louder. So everyone *else* can hear it.” 

Karina stepped back with a sigh. 

“Literally come to therapy with me on Friday. Sit in the waiting room, get a feel for it, and you can buy me pizza afterward.”

I opened my mouth to speak, and she rolled her eyes. “Oh, god, not like a *date*!” 

Karina shoved me, and I found myself laughing. 

Actually fucking laughing. Karina wasn't laughing. As usual, she was scowling.  

She pulled a face, wrinkling her nose. “I'm not into you, Reyes! No offense.” 

Which meant  *full offense.*

Karina’s offer was tempting. Maybe talking to someone wouldn't be so bad.

Friday was only two days away. Two days of news reports. 

“Sounds good,” I surprised myself with a real smile. “I'll see what I'm doing.”

Karina broke out into a grin. “Good!” She grabbed my wrist, pulling me to class. I felt a little less breathless with Karina around. “The first step in getting help is *accepting* help!” 

She marched me straight into class, and with a wink, twisted on her heel and strode to her desk, pigtails swinging. 

Still smiling, I slumped down at my own desk. 

“And what are *you* smiling about?” Simon was already full-body diving onto my desk with a devilish grin.  “You walked to school with Karina.”

I dropped my backpack on the floor. There was no teacher.

8:50am, and Mrs Cannon still hadn’t arrived.

I shoved Simon off my desk. “So?”

Simon leaned in, close enough that his breath feathered across my face. My skin prickled, igniting. “So,” he said quietly, “what did you *talk* about?”

I held his gaze. “We talked about how much we fucked last night,” I said dryly. When Simon’s lip curled, I leaned forward, teasing. “Eight times,” I added with a smile. “Back to back.”

Simon’s smile faded. “Seriously?”

I glanced at Karina at the back of the classroom, who winked at me.

I winked back. 

Maybe I *could* play the asshole, after all. “Seriously.” 

Simon pulled back, eyes wide, lips parting like he was about to say something. 

He didn’t. 

“Nice,” he said. “Hope you had fun, Milo. Karina’s cute.” With a two fingered salute, Simon slunk back to his desk without another word, and my gut twisted.

“Simon?” I hissed. 

He pretended not to hear me, head ducked, eyes glued to his phone. I wasn’t used to that from him. Was he pissed? Jealous? How was I supposed to know he had a thing for Karina Crawford?

I twisted around in my chair. “Simon,” I said, louder. I threw my pen at him. “Simon, I was *clearly*  joking.” 

He didn't respond, turning his head toward the window.

“Hey, Mikey?” 

A voice from in front of me turned me back to the front.

Kana McCartney was smiling at me, one perfectly plucked brow raised. Ponytail brunette, I used to call her. 

She was plainly pretty. No makeup, no attempt at fancy clothes. 

Just the same jeans and tee every day. 

Her ponytail looked painfully tight. Kana’s smile didn’t quite reach her eyes. I had no doubt she had constant headaches.

Kana *still* didn't know my name.

“It's Milo,” I corrected her. 

Kana blinked. “Whatever,” she said,. “Miloooo.” She emphasized my name. 

“Look, I’m sorry for interrupting your *marital* problems,” she shot Simon a grin, “but could I borrow a pen?”

I didn’t realize I’d become this girl’s personal pen dispenser.

“Where’s the one I gave you yesterday?” I asked.

“I lost it,” she shrugged with a sheepish smile. “It’s just a pen.”

“You don’t even know my *name*,” I challenged her. My phone vibrated and I ignored it.  “Why should I lend you a pen that I know you’re going to lose?”

“I didn't lose it,” she said, fashioning a smile. “I… misplaced it.”

“That's also called *losing* it.” 

Her eyes narrowed. “Didn't I lend you a pencil that one time?”

I smirked. “That doesn't make up for all of the pens you've ‘misplaced’.”

“It’s a *pen*.” She nodded at my phone vibrating across my desk. “Answer your call! Jeez!”

I rolled my eyes, turning my focus to my phone. 

But all my bravado, all my confidence, came crashing down seeing one word.

Mom.

I stood up, pushing my chair back. “Mom?”

*“Milo?”* Mom was sobbing, her breaths rattling down the phone.

In three strides, I left the classroom, tumbling out into the empty hallway.

“Mom,” I didn't trust my own voice, my shuddery breaths. “What's going on?” 

*”It’s your sister,”* Mom whispered, *“Milo, she's stopped breathing. We’re… we’re at the hospital. Sweetie, can you come over?”* 

Mom’s sobs felt and sounded like thunderclaps, and I didn't realize I'd hit the ground until my knees slammed into marble. *“Milo?”* Mom’s voice collapsed into a wave of white noise in my skull. 

I couldn't breathe. The air felt tight, wrong, like all the oxygen had been sucked away. *”Milo, baby, I need you—”*

The doors to the school suddenly flew open with a loud BANG. 

Thundering boots entered. 

Soldiers. 

“GET DOWN!”

I was slammed face-first into the floor, my phone skittering away from me. Mom. Mara. Gone. The man towering over me reeked of hair gel and shoe polish. His boot came down on my back, knocking the breath from my lungs. “HANDS ON YOUR HEADS!”

I obeyed, choking on air and dust. Mom. Was she okay? 

Mara. 

How was I supposed to reach them? How was I going to see my sister again? 

I stayed down until rough hands hauled me upright, my arms yanked behind my back and tied together. Soldiers flooded the classroom, driving my terrified classmates into the hallway, all of them with their hands on their heads. 

I caught a glimpse of Simon starting toward me before a soldier shoved him back.

There was no explanation. No answers. 

We were treated like cattle. When we asked questions, we were threatened. I was hauled into the back of a military truck with fifteen other kids. 

The journey dragged on, highway after highway. Cold. 

Carrying me farther from Mom and Mara, and from my life. 

Therapy and pizza with Karina Crawford. Regionals. College applications.

There were no blankets, we were dumped on metal benches. 

I sat between a girl who wouldn't stop screaming, and a boy who pissed himself. 

I drifted off, my head uncomfortably pressed into a stranger’s shoulder. I let myself sleep, the nauseating sway of the truck lulling me into some kind of slumber.

“Out.”

I woke to daylight. No. Artificial white lights blinding us.

A soldier was already yanking kids out of the truck. 

We were in a large, compound-like space. A female soldier ordered us to form two lines. Male and female. We did, almost immediately, robotically. I stood at the front of the boys, my legs wobbling, ready to give-way.

The woman didn't even look at us, her gaze glued to an iPad. 

“When your name is called, you will follow me,” she said, her tone firm but gentle. “Do you *understand* me?” 

“Yes,” we chorused. 

They started with the A’s.

Atwood. Simon was first, shooting me a shaky smile. He was crying. 

When the door slammed behind him, soldiers following him, my legs gave way.

“Stand up!” A soldier barked, and I forced myself to my feet. 

Arlington. 

Asher.

Aspen. 

I watched all the A’s walk into a single white room. And never come back out.

The B’s were next. 

Then the C’s.

Karina tried to fight back, and was dragged inside the room by her hair. 

It took hours, each one breaking me more.

My body started to sway, my eyes flickering.

I fell back, twice, into a startled looking Wen Roman’s arms. He didn't move, didn't try and try to help me up. 

By the time my name was called out, a soldier stood behind me, pressing a gun into my temple. I was on my last chance. The woman stepped outside the door, frowning at her iPad. 

She walked toward me, heels clacking across concrete. 

*“Milo Reyes?”* She ushered me to follow her. “Come with me, sweetheart.” 

When I entered the room, I expected a gunshot to the head. What I got was a normal examination room, like inside a doctor’s surgery. A chair, a bed, and a desk, which she took a seat behind.

“Sit down, Mr Reyes,” she said, and I slumped into the plastic chair.

The woman handed me what looked like an inhaler. “Breathe into that for me.”

I did, forcing a breath through the tube, and her smile brightened. 

“All right, your lungs seem to be fine! Do you smoke or vape, Milo?” 

I shook my head.

She nodded. “Do you take drugs?” 

“No.”

She typed something into her laptop. “Any prescription medication?” 

“No,” I lied.

“That includes antidepressants, Mr. Reyes,” she said in a sing-song voice. “We know you were prescribed them a year ago and stopped getting refills.”

“No.”

The woman hummed. “All right! And this may seem like an invasive question, Mr Reyes, but are you….?” 

Her words drifted into ocean waves. I could barely understand her. 

She told me to stand up, and I did. The woman measured me.

Then she told me to take off my shoes, and I did.

She told me to stand on a scale, and I *did*.

“Is my Mom okay?” I asked in a breath. “My baby sister, Mara. She's—”

“Dead,” the woman said, gently pulling me off the scale. “Your baby sister died fifteen minutes ago. Just like every other infant, she suffocated from fluid buildup inside her lungs.” 

I stopped breathing.

For real this time.

No Simon to anchor me to reality. No Mom to tell me everything was *okay*. 

I grabbed for my throat, panting, my lungs aching. Screaming. 

Mara was dead. Mom was gone. And I was standing inside a military bunker in my socks getting fucking *weighed*. 

“I'm sorry for your loss,” the woman said, typing something else. She lifted her head. “You can sit down now, Milo.” 

I did, my head spinning around and around.

“Milo, have you ever been in a romantic relationship?” The woman asked after a moment.

“No,” I spoke through gritted teeth. 

She nodded slowly. Typed some more. “Do you have an interest in—”

“Why are you *asking* me this?” I whispered, my voice flat, like I'd given up. “What does that have to do with anything?”

I laughed, sputtering. “My sister is dead!” My voice broke. “Why the *fuck* are you asking me this?” 

The woman’s expression didn't waver. “Answer the question, Mr Reyes.” She turned to me, hands clasped in her lap. “Do you have any interest in marriage?” 

I didn't even have to think about it. “No.” 

She inclined her head. “How about meaningful relationships? Would you like to have a wife one day, Milo?” 

“No.” 

Her reaction confused me. She smiled. Laughed. Crossed one leg over the other.

“Oh? And why is that, hmm?” 

I smiled. Copying her. I was done with her shit. I was getting out of there and getting to Mom. Mara wasn't dead. My heart pounded through my chest. There was no way my sister was dead.

“Because I don't *want* one,” I said, and got to my feet. Somehow, my legs were working. “I want to go home.” 

The woman simply regarded me with a patronizing smile. “Sit down.” 

“Next question,” she said, when I slumped back down. “Do you have any interest in having a child?” 

“No.”

“Milo, you can't say ‘no’ to every question.”

I folded my arms. “I don't *want* a fucking child,” I said, my voice cracking. “Is that good enough for you?” I leaned forward. “How about you? Do *you* want a freakin’ baby?” 

“Milo, that's inappropriate.”

I laughed. “And asking an eighteen-year-old kid *isn't*?” 

She went back to typing before turning to me. “Last question.  Do you understand that refusing to comply will have consequences? The smile on her face didn’t reach her eyes. 

“Fifteen hours ago, your entire senior class was placed under federal authority  indefinitely. As of now, Mr. Reyes, you’re no longer operating as private citizens. You’re government property.”

I didn't speak. If I did, I'd probably get a bullet in my head. 

The woman kept typing, before she slammed what I guessed was the enter key. 

“All right, Milo, that's you processed!” She got to her feet. “You have been successfully matched with your wife.” 

Something ice cold, like the cruel legs of a spider, scrambled down my spine. I stood up without thinking, without breathing. “What’s the fuck does that mean?” 

The woman’s mouth curled. “Sit *down*.”

When I refused, the soldier by the door stepped forward and shoved me back into the chair. The metal legs screeched against the floor. I tried to get back up, and a gun was pointed in my face. The woman did not even look up. Her fingers kept moving over the keyboard.

“Let him go,” she spoke softly. “Milo, you are important to us and deserve an explanation,” she exhaled. 

“Three years ago, the upper levels of government of the highest power were informed of something in our food supply. Not just *inside* it, but had been there for years.”  She gently closed her laptop. 

“I won’t go into detail, but it wasn’t described as a fast killer. Instead, it lives and grows inside us. It does not kill us, not yet. It sits there. Dormant.” 

Her eyes met mine again. “Its main target was women. Not because it *hates* women,” she added, with a laugh, “but because pregnancy changes everything. 

“Your immune system, your blood volume, the way your body holds onto what’s inside it.” She tipped her head. “A female host. A pregnant host.”

She watched my face. “I’m sure you’re smart enough to work out the rest.” 

Her gaze dropped to her lap. “When it wakes up, it doesn’t kill the mother. It doesn’t need to. It passes the cost onto the baby. Their lungs flood. We can call it respiratory failure if you want something cleaner. We can call it pulmonary edema. The result is the same.” She didn’t wait for me to speak, continuing. 

“Anyway. Now, we are seeing that backlog. And we will keep seeing it until it burns through the exposed population.” She inhaled slowly. “And the projections say that by 2028, the human population will be…”

“Stop.” I whispered, my throat on fire.

“However,” she said. “The virus seems to only affect those over a certain age. We picked your class, and others across the country, purely based on your ability to  reproduce, and *continue* reproducing.” 

Something sour crept up my throat. “So, we’re incubators.” 

Her mouth thinned. “Milo, this isn't cruel. This is fixing a problem.” 

“Will you force us?” I managed to get out.

“Hm?” 

My voice broke. “Will you *force* us?”

She shook her head. “Milo, you are looking at this from the perspective of a prisoner. Which you are not. Under the Family First Law,” she explained, “you have been assigned a wife and child. For the next two years, you will be  participating in a domestic simulation designed to prepare you for real family life.”

She turned in her chair to face me.

I wondered what her name was. Did she even deserve one? 

To me, she would continue to be “The Woman.”

“Once we determine you are  capable of producing and raising the next generation with your assigned partner, you will be released.”

“What if I refuse?” The words came out too fast. 

This time, the woman didn't spare me with sympathy.

“If you refuse to participate, Mr Reyes, you and your wife will be immediately executed.”

She stood slowly, pulling open a drawer. “Okay, Milo, please make your way over to the bed on your right side and make yourself nice and comfortable.” 

I didn't have a choice. When I backed away, I was gently shoved down. The bed reclined down, and I found myself staring at a blinding white light.

“Relax, Milo,” the woman hummed, pinning my wrists down. 

“What was the name of your baby sister again?” She asked, pulling on white gloves. I'd had an EEG before. It was kind of the same. But the plastic disks weren't on my chest. They were firmly placed on my temples. 

“Mara,” I whispered, squeezing my eyes shut.

“Mara,” the woman repeated, pressing pressure. “What a lovely name for a baby girl.” 

The first shock of electricity wasn't too bad. 

Like…. poking an outlet, or pins and needles.

“I'm going to ask you some questions, Milo,” the woman’s voice hummed. “Do your best to answer them for me, all right?” 

I nodded, tears stinging my eyes. “Okay.” 

A second shock.

This one ripped a scream from my throat. My body jerked. 

Like being hit by lightning.

“Do you have a wife, Milo?” 

Something cold and cruel slid into the back of my skull.

“No.” I managed.

A third shock, and bright white light flashed in front of my eyes.

I could see…

New York.

A glistening chandelier.

I was standing at an altar, smiling.

And in front of me, wearing white, wearing a beautiful smile…

“Are you sure you don't have a wife, Milo?” 

I blinked rapidly, but the images were clearer. 

My wife. Standing in front of me. 

“Milo, can you answer that again for me, please?” The voice fluttered in my head. “Can you tell me the name of your wife?”

“I don't… *have* a wife,” I whispered. 

Pain slammed into me. Merciless pain. Agonizing pain.

I screamed, writhing, something warm running from my nose.

“The name of your *wife*, Milo,” the voice ordered. “Say it.” 

Kana.

Her face lit up inside my mind. Her smile. 

Her laugh. 

The way she held me, her arms wrapped around me—

Kana. 

Kana St. Clair. 

“Kana.” I spat blood, screaming. “Kana St Clair.” 

The pain stopped, and I felt my head drop.

“What is *your* name, Milo?” The voice asked. 

More flashes.

My wedding day.

Kana in my arms.

Kana kissing me.

Kana pulling me toward her, laughing.

Kana dancing. 

“Milo St. Clair,” she teased, pulling me onto the dance floor. Under dizzying lights, her wedding dress was ethereal, spinning with her. Her head found the crook of my shoulder. “May I have this dance?” 

I laughed, pulling her into a waltz. 

“You *may*!” 

Another flash. But this time I welcomed it.

Our beautiful home. 

Our white picket fence.

Kana hauling a large box, while pregnant. 

“Milo,” the voice seeped inside my head. “What is *your* name?” 

Milo St. Clair.

That's what she wanted me to say.

That's what would get me out of the fucking restraints.

“My name is Milo St. Clair,” I said.

“Good.” The voice said. “And who is your wife?” 

“Kana St. Clair.” 

“That's right,” she hummed. “One more question.” 

Slowly, she removed my restraints. 

But before she could deliver it, I heard the door fly open. 

“Dr. Berry,” a male’s voice hissed. “One of the female participants rejected the serum and gone into cardiac arrest—”

She didn't respond, the two of them leaving the room in a rush.

Leaving me alone.

I let out a breath and lurched to a sitting position, my bones stiff.

My vision was blurry, my mouth tangled.

Blood had crusted beneath my nose and dried along my chin.

With a trembling hand, I peeled the disk from my right temple.

The dumb bitch had let me go before she could finish Clockwork Orange-ing me.

I slid off the bed and checked her desk for weapons.

Nothing.

Unless I wanted to attack with a pen.

The door was shut. After hesitating, I pulled it open and stuck my head out. 

Kids.

No. My class. Fifty eighteen-year-old standing stock still, their arms by their sides. 

No soldiers. None that I could see, anyway.

Somehow, my legs worked, and in several strides, I was in front of Simon.

“Simon?” I whispered. 

When he didn’t respond, staring straight through me, I clapped my hands in front of his face.

“Simon!”

I shook him, but the horrific burn marks staining his temple sent me backing away.

Fuck.

Fear writhed up my spine.

I can’t do this, I thought manically, tears stinging my eyes.

I can’t fucking do this.

Fuck.

I can’t do this.

My nails found my eyes, a hysterical sob climbing up my throat.

Could I end it now? Could I save myself?

“Hey, kid.” A hand found my shoulder, and I froze. “Get in line.”

A soldier pulled me into a line of empty, mindless shells. I was positioned next to an empty, smiling Kana McCartney.

I could do this.

Stay like this.

Pretend to be like the others and get the fuck out. 

My hands found Kana’s, squeezing tight as the lights flickered off, leaving us in the dark.

I could do this. I had to.

I squeezed my “wife’s” hand again, closing my eyes.

Hi 🙂

I’m 28, Indian, trans, and based in the Pietermaritzburg / Durban area. I’m open to long distance if there’s genuine effort and consistency.

I’m looking for something meaningful — companionship first, and maybe more if it develops naturally. I’m not interested in hookups or drama.

I’m more of a homebody than a party person. I enjoy simple, wholesome things like:

* Lunch and dinner dates
* Desserts, ice cream, and coffee runs
* Movies and binge-watching series
* Beach and park walks
* Visiting a zoo or animal farm
* Traveling and weekend getaways
* Random late-night drives just talking and listening to music

I value privacy, discretion, and emotional maturity. I’m looking for someone calm, respectful, consistent, and relationship-minded. Someone who appreciates femininity and wants a healthy, mutual dynamic built on trust.

I put effort into how I present myself and into the people I care about. I believe in matching energy — if you’re consistent and intentional, I will be too. If you disappear for days without communication, we probably won’t be compatible. Clear communication matters to me.

What I’m looking for:

* Masculine and emotionally mature
* Consistent and communicative
* Private and discreet
* Interested in slow-burn dating

Not interested in:

* Couples
* Financial arrangements
* Hard drugs
* Drama
* Casual situations

If this resonates with you, feel free to reach out and tell me:

* Your age
* Your location
* A bit about yourself
* What kind of connection or dynamic you’re looking for what does having a trans girlfriend mean to you ?

The cost is set to go even higher this year [to $1,300 per household](https://taxfoundation.org/research/all/federal/trump-tariffs-trade-war/), assuming the existing tariffs stay in place, the research said.

The research called Trump's tariffs ""the largest U.S. tax increase as a percent of GDP since 1993."" It suggests the president's signature economic policy is exacerbating cost of living concerns at a time when many households are grappling with persistently high prices.

According to the research think tank Tax Foundation, the federal government collected $264 billion in total tariff revenues in 2025 -- far short of the trillions regularly touted by the White House. The research also finds the tariffs will offset most of the economic benefits of the new tax cuts from Trump's signature tax law that took effect this year.

Tariffs, which fluctuated through 2025 as the U.S. [struck trade deals](https://abcnews.com/Business/european-officials-suspend-us-trade-agreement-amid-tariff/story?id=129422031), primarily affected the cost of electronics, toys and cars that aren't manufactured domestically and foods that are [grown abroad](https://abcnews.com/Business/grocery-price-inflation-picking-defying-trumps-claims/story?id=129237545). The price of coffee rose by 33.6%, ground beef by 19.3%, romaine lettuce by 16.8% and frozen orange juice by 12.4%, according to [the Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/regions/mid-atlantic/data/averageretailfoodandenergyprices_usandmidwest_table.htm).

The Tax Foundation data shows the average effective tariff rate in the U.S. has surged from around 2% in 2024 to roughly 10% in 2025, the highest since 1946.

Do you think American voters would prefer tax hikes or price hikes? Are the macroeconomic benefits worth it to voters regarding tariffs, like the sense of helping fellow American companies? How have tariffs impacted your shopping trends?",112,1770817413.0,moderatepolitics,43,0.9,False

I matched with someone and we had good conversations, but I don’t really trust “good conversations” anymore. He asked me to meet for coffee and I suggested something else. He said that sounded good. It’s funny because I was about to help him choose a place by asking,” Do you have something in mind? Or I can help you with that.”

But after we agreed to meet, he didn’t suggest any place. So I thought why should I offer to help if he didn’t even try?

Now he’s made me miss the last guy I dated. He always knew what to say and we would help each other pick places. He was usually the first to suggest something. Unfortunately we didn’t continue after 4 dates.

I'm (M30) from Bangalore.

So this thing happened yesterday where I told my office crush, very nervously that I like her, just that, didn't ask her out or show any signs of real commitment. She said ok it's cool and then at night she texted saying that she would appreciate it if I could keep our relation strictly professional and only speak with her if it's something work related.

Now here's the thing, I'm not asking if I did wrong or not, I already know the answer to that. The thing is this is a repeated pattern and has happened a few times, 4-5 times I think, now.

It kind of goes like this. I start off as friends / classmates / colleagues / friend of friend or something and then keep being nicer and nicer to the girl as I fall more and more for her. And then when I cannot take it anymore, I simply confess my feelings like an ultimatum, no small coffee dates, no deep talks to get to really know each other, just I like what I've seen so far and I think this could work. On top of that, if confessing like this wasn't bad enough, I say it out like a nervous loser with no confidence or conviction.

once when such a scenario happened, one of my close female friends (who I was not romantically involved with, not even one sided) said this about another crush who ripped my heart out in a similar manner, ""dude! you've got nice guy syndrome"" and back then I thought it was a made up swag term, but the pattern has repeated far too often for me to ignore it.

She was my teacher from the age of 14 to when I left school/sixth form at 17. Our relationship was very close I would sit with her for lunch most days and majority of the time would sta after school to talk to her. I think I have a hard time moving on from this because the lines between our relationship were so blurred, she was never overly inappropriate towards me but me being young, possibly made me feel like there was something more.everyone knew how close we were, my friends and even teachers at school knew this and would make jokey comments about it.

She is married to a woman and would consistently tell me how much I reminded her of her wife, she made a lot of comments that I look back on now and question the meaning behind, she made a comment when I started dating my current gf that she was “not my favourite person anymore” I knew a lot about her personal life and that didn’t change once I left school. When I first left we followed eachother on social media and for about a year I didn’t hear from her again which I was fine with at the time I felt like I had moved on from that time in my life- but around this time last year she reached out again and we had a deep conversation about life and she kept telling me that “she would always be there for me she truly meant what she said”

After a couple weeks of us messaging back a forth( her sending me pictures of where she was on holiday and just general conversation) we met up for a coffee and spoke about life, at the time I was in a long term relationship with my girlfriend and was confiding in her about how I was unhappy, she kept telling me how I should end things in this relationship if I want happy- after this conversation she proceeded to send me quotes about tricky relationships and being there for yourself etc. i eventually ended things with my girlfriend and let her know but a couple months later we decided to get back together- she messaged me about this saying that she hadn’t been updated and that was the last time I heard from her. We had planned to meet up in the April of last year but when I sent a message asking if this was still happening I didn’t hear from her again.

I haven’t reached out since then but I am finding it really hard to let her go- I’ve tried to go to therapy to speak about this relationship but I don’t think I have the confidence to be truthfully honest about my feelings towards her. I don’t think she really understood how blurred the lines were at first and maybe she realised towards the end and that’s why she won’t speak to me anymore but I feel very left in the dark. When I was in school and speaking to her everyday it was very hard to distinguish how I felt towards her, part of it felt like a crush but it was so intense that I’m not sure, as I’ve gotten older that feeling has become more confusing as i am now in a very happy relationship but still find myself thinking about her a lot.

I have an older 5,500 running watt generator with the old style 3-wire opposing spade socket for the 220VAC (no neutral). It works great and makes good power. The 220 meters at about 225-volts.   
I have used this genny multiple times to power parts of the house during a power outage. The 100-amp service main breaker is outside, so it is easy to open the breaker and stab the cable for the generator and land the ground on the bonded neutral bus.   
But the last time I used it, the 220 circuits operated fine (downstairs gas package and stove) but the 120 circuits were flaky like there was not a good neutral. It took out some light bulbs and a Keurig coffee maker.  
I let it go since we had heat and opened all the single-pole breakers. The next day I double-checked the cord and ground from the generator which metered out correctly. Power seemed good.  


I am a EE, so not a complete noob. Have done control & automation in the industrial/municipal environment for 35 years. But fully admit I an Not a Resi-guy and there are a lot things I do not know, especially when it comes to residential codes and generators. 

Since this happened, I purchased a slightly larger genny with a Nema L14-30P connection. I am going to add a disconnect and connection for the genny cord.

I’m calm most of the time, with my own share of chaos tucked away neatly. I listen well, care deeply, and value honesty more than charm. I’m not into drama, games, or mixed signals. I appreciate warmth, emotional intelligence, and people who are kind without trying to prove it.

Life for me is about small comforts and quiet rituals. Strong coffee in the morning. The smell of it lingering. Dark chocolate. Simple food. Music that fits the mood. Nights that feel slower than the day. Sometimes an occasional joint to take the edge off and breathe.

I’m open minded about connection and relationships, including ENM or polyamory, as long as everything is honest, respectful, and clear. Above all, I value communication.

I don’t think if this kind of body is considered good, been going to gym for a year now, ever since I have moved w this roommate of mine he has always been very fond of my body and looks, no doubt he looks good too, but lately he has been giving a lot of creep vibes following which I have just started to avoid him.

He did the unthinkable today, i failed to interpret what had even happened, so I was in the kitchen making my coffee and he ended up hugging me from the back, I was left frozen and couldn’t think about anything, he cuddled a lil bit and then went back to his room.

1r1xapu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopositive/comments/1r1xapu/anyone_else_leave_their_doctor_feeling_like_you/,Anyone else leave their doctor feeling like you wasted everyone's time? I can't be the only one.,"I've been sitting in my car in the clinic parking lot for 20 minutes now just... stewing. So I'm writing this while it's fresh.

I waited 11 weeks for this appointment. Eleven weeks.

And here's the thing, I knew something was off. Waking up at 3:30am drenched in sweat, mood swings that make me feel like I'm losing my mind, brain fog so bad I forgot my own PIN at the grocery store last week. Joint pain that came out of nowhere. Exhaustion that coffee can't touch.

But when I sat down across from my GP and she asked ""so what's going on?"", I just... blanked.

I said something like ""I think it might be menopause? I've been feeling really off."" And then I mentioned the hot flashes. And the sleep. And she nodded and said it could be perimenopause but also could be stress or thyroid, ordered a blood test, and that was it. Eight minutes.

I walked out and immediately remembered all the things I forgot to mention. The anxiety that started six months ago. The fact that my periods went from clockwork to completely chaotic. That my sex drive basically disappeared. The weird heart palpitations at night. The fact that I've been putting on weight despite not changing anything.

It's like my brain decided to present the highlight reel instead of the full picture. And my GP can only work with what I give her.

The worst part? I'm not even mad at my doctor. She was perfectly nice. She just had 10 minutes and I showed up with vibes instead of data. Of course she defaulted to ""let's run some blood tests"" - what else could she do?

I went home and googled ""menopause symptom diary"" and found like 400 apps that want me to tap checkboxes every day on yet another app I'll abandon in a week. I already have 6 wellness apps on my phone that I used for exactly 3 days each.

What I actually need is embarrassingly simple: some way to just... say how I feel when I feel it, and then hand my doctor something useful at the end. Like a translated version of my messy experience that makes clinical sense.

Because right now the system works like this: you suffer for months, you get one short appointment, you forget half your symptoms because you're nervous, your doctor can only respond to what you tell them, and you leave feeling like you failed some kind of test you didn't study for.

I talked to a friend who's been on HRT for a year and she said it took her THREE appointments before she got the right treatment because each time she'd forget to mention important stuff or couldn't clearly describe how things had changed since last time.

Three appointments. That's like 8 months of waiting where I live.

I don't need another app with cute charts. I need to not waste my next appointment. I need to walk in there with something that says ""here's what actually happened to me over the last three months"" so we can skip the reconstruction and get to the actual decision-making.

Does anyone actually have a system that works for this? I've tried the Notes app (disaster), a paper journal (lasted 4 days), and an Excel spreadsheet (please don't judge me, it was 2am).

When I made my coffee using this method, for first two weeks of jan, the chocolate-y notes were delecious-ly present. By then time that packet finished, the coffee tasted just meh, no chocolate notes whatsoever. 
Then I also tried BT 13th birthday blend, same technique. This time the beans were kept in fridge, the bean bag further sealed in a ziplock. 
The fruity chocolately notes were there for first two weeks, then the taste is just meh. 
The technique has been same throughout.

Not that humanity wasn't already a tyranny during HD1, but I feel it was a lot more subtle and a lot of the characters played it straight. 

  
When talking to your crew, you had them talk about admiring the colonists living on dangerous planets to extend democracy or wondering why the Illuminate attacked humanity or why the Cyborgs turned their back on the Federation. You had the doctor explaining how scientists think the other factions are structured and you had the bestiary giving a short explanation of what each enemy unit does and where their place in the enemy hirarchy was. And it was all done in a way that it felt naturaly and genuine. People talked like normal people.



And it was also done in a way that made you feel like they have a point, while sprinkling some hints here and there, like the lore bit about Helldivers being deployed to shut down a peaceful protest with lethal force or that elections seem to be automated, that reveil the dark truth.

  
Now in Helldivers 2, every second word is Liberty or Democracy. They constantly say stuff like"" I got my citizen status increased because I reported undemocratic behaviour and got one more free doctor visit."","" Do you really live if you aren't under constant surveillance?""."" The cowardly Cyborgs send an army of slaves to fight their battles (Haha, isn't it funny when we accuse them of doing the same as we do?"". It's paraphrased, but you get the point.

  
And then you have all the other stuff. Like the coffee shop asking if you want a cup of Libertea, the bank being called Trustor, T.Ruth school or the biggest offender, Strohman News. Really AH, Strohman News? Why not just outright call it Fake News if you are so blatant about it?

  
And this goes on and on for the entire game. I mean, just compare the tutorials of both games. In HD1, it was a regular training course explaining you how you do this and that without much fanfare, like you would expect from the military.

  
In HD2 however, you constantly hear ""You're the best."" and "" You're the bravest."" and its just too much. You used to be subtle Arrowhead. The tone of Helldivers 1 was good, why did you throw it out of the window?",1,1770816085.0,Helldivers,6,0.55,False
1r1x7e7,https://i.redd.it/h9e1pnca9vig1.jpeg,Warning: Jigsaw Speed Dating is a SCAM (part 2: read description),"This is a follow-up from my previous post about Jigsaw Speed Dating events. It is a not traditional speed dating. You pay $30 for the event a day do a rushed speed dating event where it is supposed to be 5 minutes with each person but by the end they were running late and you only got like 2 minutes which was barely enough time to even introduce yourself and ask what they do for work. Then if you don’t ask for someone’s contact info while you are there or have then scan a QR code on your phone, you don’t get to ever speak with them. They don’t match you. You don’t get to say who you had a connection with. The whole premise of speed dating is absent from these events. You have to pay $50 for a membership just to be able to talk to the people you met! And even then you don’t get to go by mutual matches so if you’re a woman all the guys you didn’t like can still pay to message you.   

And on top of all that they make you download a shitty app just to even access your ticket to the event and to even make a profile in the app you have to take a live selfie for “verification” (facial recognition data they can sell). 

Sorry for the rant but with it being close to V-day and love on everyone’s mind I just wanted to warn people about this corporation that doesn’t care about dating they just want your money and even when they get it they just want more. I’d rather support some local bar that does this than this a company like that. The attached picture is the email response they sent me when I asked them about it. 

TL;DR - Jigsaw speed dating is an event where you have to download an app to access your ticket, upload a picture of yourself & take a selfie to “verify you”, pay $30 to talk to a bunch of people of the opposite sex for somewhere from 2-5 min, and then have to pay $50 to talk to any of the people you met.

1r1x790,https://www.reddit.com/r/blackgirls/comments/1r1x790/validation_needed/,Validation needed,"Yall my blood is BOILING! Long read incoming:

So I’m a black 20 something year old woman from USA currently on my third year living in Europe (I know chileeee..) I’ve been super lucky to find an all girls flat with 4 bedrooms and I get along well with all the girls (I’m the only black one of course) we all have different lives and schedules so we don’t necessarily hang out or have personal relationships outside of the fact that we live together, it’s very in and out. In the end of November TWO of my roommates moved out and were replaced quickly by two new girls. One of them is cool and the other has definitely thrown off the flow of the house for me. We’ll call her Mary… Mary is messy. Mary is loud, Mary is inconsiderate, Mary is heavy footed, Mary doesn’t clean up after herself, Mary leaves crumbs on counters and doesn’t put things back how she found them. Mary leaves dishes in the sink, Mary stomps around the house slamming doors and leaving messes and you can ALWAYS tell if Mary has been in a room before you. For some reason, NO ONE SEEMS TO MIND THIS!

For context, I grew up in a VERY passive aggressive home. Lots of huffing and puffing loud sighs silent treatment moping around or sarcasm and pretending everything is fine instead of being direct. Sometimes I wish I had a family that just yelled and cursed at each other so at least we could get it off our chest but no.. and because of this I have a hard time speaking up for myself and setting boundaries sometimes (I’m practicing).

Mary had some company on Monday who slept over and spent the night, fine.

(We have a group chat and in the past, the girls ALWAYS give a heads up if they’re having company especially if it’s a man but Mary didn’t, hmm.)

Tuesday morning when I’m getting ready for work I see that Mary is also getting ready for work.. she leaves before me and her company stays. Weird.. is he being left alone while literally everyone else is at work? That makes me uneasy.

Tuesday afternoon I get home and he’s STILL HERE in our living room ALONE in his pjs making himself right at home. Tv on blast, a mess from whatever he cooked in the kitchen, all the lights on in the crib.

Mary comes home later that day and they hang out in the living room.

Wednesday morning Mary leaves for work AGAIN and leaves him here. I don’t work Wednesdays but early I got up to meet a friend for coffee and then ran some errands. Around 12pm I come back home and he’s here doing the same thing, bumming around in our living room tv blasted messy kitchen even a load of laundry going. Who IS THIS NIGGA!??? So I’m fed up. I text Mary. Again, this takes courage because I have a hard time being direct when I’m bothered. I send her a very polite text like “hey girl I have no issue with you having company but it caught me off guard when I got home today and I see he’s still here specifically alone in our flat without you. In the future can you just give us all a heads up if there’s going to be a man around for a couple of days please. Thank you!”

Yallll… guess what she responds.

She says “hey, I already texted Jamie and Alexa about him staying a few days but I forgot to let you know too!”

Soooooo let me get this straight. We have a GIRLS GROUPCHAT where all 4 of us send updates and communications between each other nearly every day.. and you went out of your way to send the two others SEPARATE messages to let them know you were having a RANDOM MAN HERE FOR 3 days but “forgot” to let me know too…??? I can’t even describe the way this made me feel and of course my first reaction is RACISM! MICRO AGGRESSION!! RED FLAG!! What the fuck do you mean you went out of your way to send PERSONAL TEXT to the two other girls and get the okay from THEM but FAILED to also let ME know!? Just admit that you don’t think I hold any value or opinion here. You don’t need to check in with me because who tf am I? No need to give the black one a heads up. Mind you I’ve been here longer than Mary ANDDDD ALEXA!!! You went directly to them and said fuck me. Forgot? Bitch it’s black history month don’t piss me off. And I mentioned this to my bestie and of course they think I’m crazy for making a racial connection here but I can’t help it guys. As a black woman my first thought is always it’s because of my blackness. Why else would you think you have zero obligation to include me in the heads up? Especially if we already have a group chat together why the fuck did you purposely go around me to send them separate messages as if they’re the only ones who deserve a heads up?

Today 0600

started out as a typical “ thankfully  “ morning,

Liz and I returned to our swimming at the beach and Her still drinking her Black Rifle coffee . She has agreed to switch to decaf after breakfast . And she was tired and grumpy by 1400 .

I told her tea with something sweet added

I’m reminded of my dad with her doing that .

His doctor made him cut out many foods. Especially his drinking coffee all day .

Still missing  him .

The swim went well as used the pool .

While we were swimming I looked up . And there was a cloud that was like a donut.

I could eat one now .

Liz said it was a contrail from a shuttle most likely .

As we were leaving a group of kids stopped us to say hi . Miss Elizabeth, Miss Rachel constantly. I asked them to not use a title while I’m not working . As this is our play time .  Next it was we need to go Rachel and Elizabeth . Off they went.

I hope one day they are writing about talking to children in their journal.

As dad was into Old Earth “ pre space travel “ history . As a child I would watch videos while sitting with him . He was fascinated by aircraft used in wars .

He and Clara would have gotten along just fine . He sure liked his sweets

Breakfast was different this morning  Aino said he ordered for us early . He wanted to try something new .

It was called quiche and had vegetables,cheese eggs and ham with a pastry crust . I like it as like a slice of pie .

Aino suggested maybe once a week one of us “ Aino , Marcus , Liz and I “ should choose something new to try .

When it’s my turn I’m going with Vegetable lasagna .

Pasta dishes are not common here .

I contacted Patricia at lunch  . I was asking about pasta and spices that were available on Haego . And what is Liz’s favorite food for a surprise meal . She will send a list and put together a box for me .

Marcus still working on the boat .

Aino still sending what he doesn’t want to deal with to my office .

•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••

Just sent a message to Aino , Marcus , Liz and Arincho .

What sporting events can we put together. Something Ykanti and humans can both do .

•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••

Had an order from Liz for an addition to the library.  She is wanting native Plants and pollinators books from Earth , Principality and Pac Humanity.

I said I’ll make an order and she will need to talk to Aino before I purchase them .

We talked and she wants to see about other pollinators too import.

I said this is way over my pay grade “ laughing saying what pay were poor” . And most likely end up with her Dad and Ishtonel .

Then suggested talk to Aino and have him contact Ishtonel for you .

I’ve had several people today asking about setting up accounts for at home bussiness.

A Ykanti artists want to sell paintings  she does at home .

I’ve started calling“Vibben “ my Ykanti house keeper Rainbow . She asked why  that name as it is after rain and the floors are wet .

I told her it was the first light after a storm . And like her it was full of beautiful colors . She started singing .

Oh and many times when I’m home early she is just singing away .

Liz message a bit ago saying fix cinnamon spice tea and a bit of bourbon I’m heading over with a surprise .

👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀

Ok -Liz let me finish .

We have scones and jam tonight with our tea “ it’s decaf and I’m not telling her “

1r1x1dg,https://www.reddit.com/r/travelblog/comments/1r1x1dg/anyone_else_overwhelmed_by_saved_tiktok_travel/,Anyone else overwhelmed by saved TikTok travel videos when planning trips?,"I’ve noticed something weird while planning trips and wanted to ask how others handle this.

Guidebooks often feel outdated. Big review sites sometimes feel a bit spammy or overly tourist‑focused. TikTok, on the other hand, has amazing spots and super current recommendations… but almost zero structure.​

The videos are great, but planning with them is painful. I’ll find an amazing bar in one video, a ramen shop in another, a cool bookstore in a third… and then lose half of them in my saved tab with no map, no categories, and no sense of what’s near what.​

So I’ve been **thinking about a different way to use TikTok for planning**, and I’m curious if anyone here already does something like this manually:

* Curate good TikTok travel videos for a specific city
* Pull out the actual places (names, addresses)
* Organize them by city + category (coffee, bars, hidden gems, etc.)
* Put everything on a map where you can filter and save places into a simple list/itinerary, while still being able to open the original video for context​

On top of that, I really like the idea of involving locals:

* People who live in the city sharing their 2–3 “if you visit my city, you must see this” spots
* Locals sanity‑checking which TikTok places are worth it and which are overhyped​

Right now I’m just experimenting with this idea for myself with a few cities (was thinking Tokyo, Bangkok, Paris to start) and trying different ways of organizing everything—spreadsheets, maps, etc.—to see if it actually makes trip planning easier.​

I’d love to hear from both sides:

* **Travelers:**
   * Do you use TikTok when planning trips?
   * If yes, how do you currently turn those videos into an actual plan (maps, lists, screenshots, something else)?
   * Would a “TikTok + locals on a map” style workflow *in theory* be useful, or do you prefer more traditional methods?
* **Locals (Tokyo/Bangkok/Paris or any big city):**
   * Do you feel TikTok shows the places you actually recommend to friends, or mostly the same viral spots?
   * How would you want your favorite non‑touristy places to be presented to visitors so they respect them and don’t overwhelm them?

Not trying to promote anything here—just genuinely interested in how people are solving this “TikTok is great for discovery but terrible for planning” problem, and whether a more structured “videos → map → itinerary” approach actually fits how you like to travel.",1,1770815617.0,travelblog,1,1.0,False

My girlfriend works as a sales staff/cashier sa isang local apparel brand. Hindi nagtutugma yung ginagawa nila sa kanya sa name ng brand nila—it’s honestly ‘suffocating’.

Her workmates often plan non-work-related hangouts, and most of the time after shift pa hanggang madaling araw. My girlfriend always declines kasi gusto niyang magpahinga, and since LDR kami, both of us are busy during the day, so the only time we can really talk is after our shifts. Kaya mas pinipili na lang niyang umuwi at mag-stay sa bahay. I understand her kasi 8–10 hours silang nakatayo sa work, and the only time they get to sit down is during lunch and coffee breaks, which total about an hour and a half.

So dito na pumapasok yung galit ko. One of her coworkers asked for their time kasi gusto daw mag “open forum” during mall operating hours. That “open forum” turned into a hot seat for my girlfriend kasi siya lang yung pinag-usapan just because hindi siya sumasama sa hangouts nila. Mind you, these hangouts aren’t required and hindi naman bayad.

Bago pa mangyari lahat, kinukwento na ng girlfriend ko kung paano siya tinatrato ng mga katrabaho niya. For example, their custodian (F, 30s, married) pulls her hair kapag may minor mistake siya. May isa ring male coworker (30s, may pamilya) na nagsasabi ng malalaswang bagay like “Lumalaki na pwet mo,” habang manyak kung tumingin. He follows her sa stockroom, keeps staring at her, and one time habang ka-call ko siya during lunch break and kasama niya yung guy, inalok siya ng saging sabay sabi, “Gusto mo saging o yung saging ko?” Kung tumatagos lang bala sa cellphone, seriously. He also sends her bastos reels, and kapag nag-uusap coworkers niya, madalas bastos yung topics and pinipilit pa nilang paungulin siya. Buti na lang may isa siyang matinong coworker na nilalayo siya kapag napupunta na sa ganung usapan.

That’s exactly why ayaw niyang sumama sa hangouts nila—toxic na, pointless pa. Ngayon, binabantaan pa siya ng custodian na ita-transfer siya if hindi siya sasama next time. Nakakainis kasi parang wala siyang karapatan sa sarili niyang oras. She’s also supporting her sibling’s education, kaya sinasabi ko sa kanya na okay lang lumabas siya minsan, but she doesn’t want to—mas gusto niya lang akong makausap. So whenever I can, and whenever stressed siya sa work, I order her food and make sure she feels loved.

My girlfriend is a very good employee. She does her job well. Hindi lang siya good employee, she’s also a responsible sister na pinapaaral yung mga kapatid niya without any help. And yet ganito pa trato sa kanya. It feels like she doesn’t even have rights or free will. I just needed to let this out kasi nakakagalit kung paano siya tratuhin ng mga taong wala namang ambag sa buhay niya.",3,1770815503.0,AntiworkPH,3,0.81,False
1r1wzfi,https://www.reddit.com/r/FigureSkating/comments/1r1wzfi/volunteering_recap_2026_so_far/,Volunteering recap: 2026 so far,"Hi Reddit,

Firstly I want to thank all of you for being there this past week. I’ve truly loved being your unofficial on-site correspondent since Euros 2023 in Espoo (and of course will be continuing in the future, I wouldn’t miss Prague for the world), the competition where I met another feral screaming fan and volunteer who inspired me to start volunteering in the first place. We reunited at Finlandia Trophy 2025, and we happy screamed a lot. I’ve made so many friends volunteering, not just because we keep seeing each other, but we share a passion for the sport even if we don’t have the same favourite skaters. I like to think I bring my own touch to this community of ours - it’s always fun giving you all the practice notes/reports because I’m hanging out at the rink all day everyday during the competition, no matter if it lasts a week or a few days. Telling you all the messages from the skaters once those became a thing, if I’ve seen someone around because of visa issues/injuries/missing luggage, asking the skaters the questions on our minds as we watch them throughout the week. Being right in the middle of the action is such an amazing and fulfilling feeling, always busy and never missing a thing. Of course, this only happens when volunteers are actually welcomed as part of the team, instead of being treated worse than the furniture or servants.

__Part 1: Sheffield__

This story actually starts in Sheffield, where I arrived three days early to start my volunteering on January 10th. Out of the goodness of my heart I guess, because those shifts were just hours worked FOR FREE and didn’t mean exchanging for a free ticket down the road or anything. The singular meal we got during the shift was stone cold the first time (and if you were vegetarian or gluten-free then you had no options), and didn’t even exist the second time. If we wanted a day off to watch, then we had to pay full price for tickets - it was not even possible to do shorter shifts. Do a 7-9 hour shift that day or, in the words of the volunteer management organization, they would just replace you. Good to know I’m replaceable. I thought volunteers were valued for their contribution to the event, no matter how small. Volunteer management organization, you ask? Instead of just having people of the local organizing committee be directly in charge of their team, Power of People (PoP) through Workforce was brought in to slot the volunteers into the spaces that needed them. That resulted in silly things such as switching announcers halfway through an event, because to an outside organization that doesn’t know how close we are in the figure skating world and how the events work we are just numbers on a page to fill out hours on a spreadsheet. PoP wanted experienced volunteers but dismissed our expertise.

I had a day off between my initial shifts, and came back to the volunteer area to get my gifts from the sponsors (not branded by the event, just looked like surplus from The National Lottery etc) that were locked up the night before and get a cup of tea as it was raining outside. I was told that it wasn’t a public area - I’m not a public thanks, and it's the hotel's tea anyway - and the stuff that was “mine” was dirty with old coffee (I’m not a coffee drinker even) inside that I discovered when I got home and did the dishes. I don’t know what this is a metaphor for, but it can’t be a good one. I was one of the volunteers handing out the rental skates at the city centre synthetic rink, doing 7+ hour shifts just on my feet and in customer service mode talking the whole time. I can handle this kind of work, but a lot of the volunteers I was with were older, as in retired, it was just way too much to ask of people working for free. This is how I ended up losing my voice by Tuesday, unable to cheer at all and “convince the judges they’ve missed something” per Robin Cousins. Though you can hear me whisper shouting “YESSS!” in some of the practice clips I took.

Despite the requirement for volunteers to purchase tickets for days without shifts, the security at Sheffield was laughably bad and I probably could have gotten in without a ticket on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday if I wanted to. Sunday I was given a ticket by someone whose friend could no longer make it. I guess I’m too honest. I also believe that I was punished for doing the right thing, by asking for my accreditation card to be fixed when I noticed it had water damage from working those two city centre shifts in the rain. (Side note, it’s like the organizers cheaped out on materials used to make accreditations because so many other volunteers’ were falling apart by the end of the week, even an athlete’s was damaged!) This somehow led to it being held hostage until Friday afternoon instead of the fix happening immediately because the volunteer management organization knew *they* cancelled my Wednesday and Friday morning shifts when I said I could not attend their full duration, but still called me Tuesday morning during the practices when I “didn’t show up” for a shift I cancelled *myself* because I didn’t want to miss all the practices that day.

I impulse accepted the Olympics volunteer assignment that would move me out of reserve on January 12th, working with the very limited information I had, before the Sheffield volunteering truly went to shit on January 16th and left me feeling so numb and hollow. My friend who skipped Europeans to do the volunteering at the Olympics, at the highly coveted Milano Ice Skating Arena location, was feeling the same even by yesterday - I guess Sheffield just gave me a head start. She ended up missing so many of the practices in Milan, which we would not have those amazing videos of Yuzu after his Beijing 2022 FS if not for the dedicated volunteers filming it. But at least I got to watch all the practices I wanted in Sheffield, and I was a familiar face teams and spectators alike could go to. Anyway, January 16th - what the hell happened? You tell me! About halfway through my first arena shift in spectator services (a role I’ve had before at other volunteering assignments), I was pulled aside to say I had to stop taking pictures of kids and taking pictures with people with my accreditation on, as “multiple people” saw me do that yesterday - what a wild accusation, it wasn’t even logically true! And are the “multiple people” in the room with us right now?! No one else was singled out like this, despite many people also with accreditation on taking pictures with some women’s skaters hanging around on the concourse RIGHT IN FRONT OF US. Between Sheffield and Milan, I feel like I was treated as a freak for how I look and singled out for doing something wrong by…existing?

When I went back to the sad excuse of a volunteer lounge to grab a cup of tea to tide me over the final hours of my volunteer shift, I was told I was no longer needed on Sunday for what would have been another arena spectator services shift as the numbers didn’t need me anymore. Somehow this was my problem to fix, either by picking up another city centre spectator services shift (no thank you) or this would be it for me. I could have up and left right then and there, but actually bothered to finish my shift on Friday. I had to turn in my accreditation which everyone that’s been a volunteer since Espoo/Kaunas/Tallinn Europeans was horrified by - that has never been a thing. I guess I kind of got to say goodbye to everyone over the next few days? Forget the signatures/pictures/hangouts we do downstairs though because volunteers couldn’t even get near the team entrance this time - we had to stick to our own area upstairs out of sight out of mind which was the volunteer lounge aka a TENT in the hallway with nowhere to charge your phone or just relax. I left Sheffield confused, angry at how my time was wasted with the volunteering, and unsatisfied but hoping for better because I was going to volunteer for the Olympics after all. I was going to make a funny video of “omg are you going to the Olympics?!?!” over my barely there one-foot spin and tiny single jumps too…but I never got the second part of the clips for such a thing.

__Part 2a: Volunteering for the Olympics__

I accepted the volunteer position in Anterselva for biathlon (first event February 8th), knowing that volunteers would be needed everywhere but it’s ok because I’d have free time between shifts at least. The information about the Olympics volunteering trickled in very slowly, almost like it was being withheld on purpose. Initially I would have had to fly out on January 29th to attend the venue training on the 31st, but if I was already salty about going to the UK three days early, no way would I go to Italy eight days early. Especially since at my actual paid job I cannot take more than two weeks off unpaid without it being considered an automatic resignation. I wanted to watch the Men’s FS and then see if I wanted to go home, or stay through for the closing ceremony and to volunteer at Junior Worlds (already accepted before Europeans, just assigning teams) and Worlds (got the acceptance the week of Europeans).

On January 30th, less than a week before volunteers would have to leave for a February 3rd-5th arrival, I finally heard back that volunteers must purchase tickets at full price. So I have to work entire days for free, paying for my own transportation in and out of Italy, my own accommodations, (these parts are pretty standard) and still have to pay full price for tickets ON TOP OF THAT? What a complete scam. “But volunteers don’t just *get* to have all access and free tickets! It’s nice when it happens but not required.” Ok. Then my time is not required either. It’s volunteering, I choose how I get to spend my time - and if it’s not being used in a valuable, productive way then I need to be firm about it. Workforce would often have volunteers standing around doing nothing, like drones awaiting the next instruction. For once the volunteering was keeping the volunteers away from the action, instead of being right there making it happen. Treat me as my own person with my own thoughts, thanks. I’ve loved contributing to the success of events where I can just be myself alongside other volunteers who *cared*, wanted to do things right and make things right for everyone - even if the organizing committee was rude! But between Workforce and so many front of house volunteers just shrugging me off and telling me they don’t know or cannot help me, I got the feeling that they didn’t really want me there.

I was able to pick up my accreditation in Milan, which took much arguing with Workforce because they do everything on a case by case basis (just like in Sheffield, they’ll decide if you can have the honour of taking the dedicated team shuttles or pay for transit like anyone else). Because it was a catch-22 situation: I could not pick up my uniform and accreditation that was in Anterselva without the accreditation to access the transportation network to get up to Anterselva. However, I couldn’t pick up my uniform while I was already there in Milan and completely dismissed. Ok well at least I have access to transportation now. I was seriously considering dragging all my stuff up into the mountains and trying to find somewhere to stay in those tiny towns before stopping myself and asking what I was even doing, I need to value my time and I don’t even care about biathlon.

__Part 2b: Attending the Olympics in person__

I truly believe I could have stayed home, knowing what I know now. The whole reason I went to Italy was for the Olympics volunteering, hoping against hope that the Olympics would make it special, that the gut feeling of dread I was feeling from the volunteer management organization being the *same* as Europeans was just my saltiness. But I’ve learned that I should not be extending so much patience and kindness to those who treated me as a volunteer as little more than a disposable napkin.

San Siro, the opening ceremony venue, was so shabby and the area around it in such disrepair and full of trash. I was so cold, the seats so far I could barely see a thing while still being incredibly expensive for what they were, being squeezed in so tight with so many people, security and their whims so awful (deciding day of we couldn’t bring battery packs/power banks despite asking that we arrive 4 hours earlier so a total nearly 8 hours without charging, deciding on site to make us get rid of all food and even empty water bottles), and then after all that mess basically only getting less than a quarter of the whole opening ceremony due to the multiple locations and even missing the actual lighting of the Olympic torch. I could have watched it on CBC Gem for free without having to tinker with a VPN, chatted with all of you, from the comfort of my own home where it’s warm with internet and charging cables.

I struggled to sell the Men’s SP ticket for a reasonable price (FS went pretty much right away) so kept it for myself - it is my favourite event, and I should at least try to be happy for our faves who made it to the Olympics in the first place, go support them, right? But what if the venue isn’t even that good, security awful, and it could just be enjoyed at home? Again my suspicions were all right. If hell was a place, it’d be run by Italians. The seats were all so far away and the railing blocked everything. The entryway volunteers and security were so rude. Not that any of the venues were that glamorous anyway - Milano Ice Skating Arena is a whole collection of tents and portables surrounded by tarped wire fences - really giving construction site, not even giving outdoor festival. The practice rink is in a tent outside ffs! There are two rinks in my home community, and they're both seasonal - the pleasure rink is a splash pad in the summer and the hockey rink with the boards is a basketball court. The ice hockey arena was never finished with enough seats and the ice is the wrong size. I have no idea if Verona arena will be finished by the closing ceremony because like the majority of Milan it is fenced off in construction mesh and everything strewn about as a temporary structure.

I paid $600 to go see Andreas and Kyrylo for a grand total of ten minutes each. I stood in line for an hour to miss their practices anyway, no way was I missing Deniss - until multiple volunteers one after the other ganged up on me to tell me I was the only not allowed to sit closer for practices and them all standing in front of me completely blocked me from seeing Deniss at all. Then when the actual event came over, the annoyances continued. As the arena didn’t allow lids on drinks (when normally you can’t take the cap *off* of bottles in Europe??) they were being spilled everywhere and all over my stuff. None of my plushies/drawings made it onto the ice due to how high and far the seats were, they needed a helping hand from Ben Agosto or other people standing rinkside. I’m glad I’m going home today though. I’ve seen enough. But I got to see many skaters at the first, second, or even third Olympics! While the railing in front of me got to know my head very well after Andreas, it also got several slaps of affirmation when Kyrylo's excitement to his score couldn't be contained in his body. Got to see so many skaters and their families (Sasha's, Donovan's, Yu-Hsiang's, Max's), competing or not, just in the stands and hallways. But normally we just get to hang out like this at the rink for a week, watching the skating and catching up without having to pay to do so!

Adding onto how it was just a sign I should have stayed home: this whole trip was cursed. From the moment I arrived in Milan, it was pouring rain and when we got our luggage at the terminal, only mine was soaked through like it had been left out. Nothing in it ever truly dried during my first hostel stay, which also wasn’t actually heated! The two sad little space heaters weren’t going to do anything! Then my transportation app just stopped working, so I couldn’t even get around - this did get fixed eventually, but omg was it too much at once. Trying to just turn this into a vacation instead of dwelling on the volunteering any longer, things were looking a bit better when I took a walk around Verona on Sunday to clear my head. I came back to Milan, staying in a much nicer hostel for shockingly a little cheaper than the first one - which at the very least provided towels and had heat! Then I had my wallet stolen at Centrale station on Tuesday, which good luck it was “just” my spare change to go to public skates, but at least I have my passport still I guess. My skates did arrive though, but I never got to use them - a combination of not realizing how far PalaSesto was and only open on the weekends, and the seasonal rinks all closing in January. Whatever. I have the mountains and good ice at home anyway.

This last month, scratch that, this whole year, has had me questioning myself, questioning my “why”. Volunteering at competitions has never felt like work until Sheffield and Milan, you couldn’t even get me to leave the rink most days because I was just having too much fun hanging out with everyone. Skaters in early groups must have thought I was insane for waking up with them to go to their 7 am practices. But I want to cheer on everyone, it’s just as fun watching this sport as it is doing. I always said that Europeans 2025 just felt like a big party at Niina and the Selevbros’ house for a week. The Tallinn organizers actually wanted us back for Junior Worlds 2026, and I sobbed when the acceptance for the highly-coveted press centre position came in over the weekend knowing that I’d have to turn it down when I was looking forward to seeing everyone again in a space where I felt welcomed. I hope Prague goes better. I look forward to watching the Men's FS with you at home, where I should have been the whole time. Watching for free, chatting with all of you, and thank everything these gen Z skaters post everything on social media so you're really not missing a thing.

1r1wy8k,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1r1wy8k/my_ex_asked_me_if_we_could_try_again_but_were/,My ex asked me if we could try again but we’re both scared,"Last week, I spontaneously asked my ex if we could grab coffee and catch up. For context, he’s the only partner I’ve ever loved, but we had a rough breakup where he’d push me away then pull me back repeatedly, until I eventually walked away. We’d been broken up and no contact for 3-4 months when I asked to catch up. I reached out because I missed him and wanted to hear how he was doing. At the time I felt fine with any outcome of us meeting up, whether that be checking in on each other or possibly reconnecting. I did know that when we met, I would put the ball in his court in terms of any future meetings, so I didn’t bring up meeting again when we saw each other. As we were leaving coffee, he asked if we could try being together again and invited me on a date this week. However, the next day he went silent, then called me to say he felt scared and like we were moving too fast. Even though he was setting the pace. We spoke on the phone for a little bit and I just probed to see whether he still wanted to try again or not, but I didn’t try to convince him one way or the other since I fought for our relationship a fair bit before the breakup. He said he’d call me back the next day after work at 5, but didn’t text me until around 8 saying he was busy playing tennis with his friends and asking if he could call me later that night or the next day. I told him he didn’t have to call if he was busy since I didn’t have any expectations of him, but an hour or so later he called me until I answered (without sending any text in between me telling him he didn’t have to call me). When he called he said he had decided he did want to try again because he didn’t want to miss out on someone as kind, fun, and sweet as me.

Honestly, the conversation made me feel doubtful because 1) it felt disrespectful of my time that he asked to call me at a certain time and never communicated prior or during that he couldn’t actually talk at that time, and 2) he never mentioned wanting to make it work because of any actual feelings he had for me, just that I’m a great partner. Also, he canceled the original date he had asked me on because his friends are having a get-together that day. It almost feels like I’m forcing him to go out and he’s trying to wiggle his way out of it, even though he’s the one texting first, asking to call me, and asking to go on dates.

I felt so sure that I wanted to try again after seeing him for the first time. The spark was still there and it felt the same as we did at the healthiest peak of our relationship. But now he seems so unexcited about dating me again I’m wondering why he even asked. He did say he wants to take things slow, so that might be what this is, but this feels almost too slow or at least too uncommunicative. Then again, it’s only been a week since I reached out about us getting coffee, and even less time since we actually met up, so I guess we are moving fast. I still have a lot of love for him, but I’m scared it’s one sided. I’m not sure what to do, or whether he’s actually disinterested or I’m not regulating my emotions properly. I don’t want to ruin things out of insecurity or fear, but I don’t know how to ask for clearer communication without sounding like I want more of his time, when really I just want clarity and respect for my time.",1,1770815390.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

Experience-based gifts are trending in 2026 for a reason. A movie date, workshop pass, or weekend activity creates shared memories rather than adding clutter.

Sometimes, the most romantic Valentine’s Day gifts are moments you create together.

Wrap the voucher in a small envelope with a handwritten message to make it special.



9. Fresh Flower Arrangement with a Personal Note

Flowers remain timeless because they instantly express emotion. Choose classic roses, elegant lilies, or mixed seasonal blooms depending on your partner’s taste.

We’ve been trying to conceive for 3 years. I’ve done multiple induction cycles. Last August, I finally got pregnant after my 4th round of Clomid. The first three cycles had failed, and I was so emotionally exhausted that when the fourth started, I honestly assumed it would fail too.

So my husband and I took a “second honeymoon” trip. I still took my Clomid because I thought, what’s the worst that can happen? I genuinely didn’t think pregnancy was possible at that point.

On that trip, I:
	•	Smoked
	•	Swam a lot
	•	Ate raw seafood
	•	Drank a lot of coffee and matcha

Right before the trip, I had also done:
	•	Retinol peel
	•	Laser hair removal
	•	Pico laser
	•	Other dermat treatments

Then I found out I was pregnant.

I immediately stopped everything and told my doctor. A few days later, I had brown discharge. Eventually, the pregnancy turned into a blighted ovum, and I had a D&C at 8 weeks.

Since then, every month my period has been late. I’d test and it would be negative. This month, I went on a small vacation by myself. I normally drink a cup of coffee and matcha daily anyway, but on this trip I also had:
	•	3 cigarettes
	•	A few puffs of a vape
	•	Laser hair removal
	•	A light peel

And now… I’m pregnant again.

I am absolutely terrified that I’ve messed this up again before I even knew. I keep replaying last year in my head and blaming myself for the blighted ovum. I’m scared history is repeating itself and that my actions before knowing I was pregnant have already harmed this baby.

Has anyone been through something like this? I don’t know how to calm my mind. I’m so scared and I feel incredibly guilty.",5,1770815330.0,pregnant,2,1.0,False

Noong una, tinanong ako ng workmate ko, *""Teh, okay lang ba sa'yo na may anak na 'to?""* Sabi ko naman, *""Okay lang, basta anak lang at hindi kasal.""* Doon nagsimula ang lahat. Noong una, punong-puno ng kilig, pero habang tumatagal, unti-unting bumibigat ang lahat.

Naging komplikado ang setup namin. Pag weekends, wala siya dahil nasa mga anak niya (kambal). Pag weekdays, limitado ang oras dahil kailangan niyang asikasuhin ang nanay niya. Pati sa aspeto ng pera, ako ang laging sumasalo dahil hindi stable ang trabaho niya. Sa totoo lang, alam kong punong-puno na siya ng red flags, pero pinili ko pa ring manatili. Umaasa ako na darating ang araw na magiging okay din ang lahat. Pero hindi pala.

Isang Linggo, nag-decide akong mag-Me Time. Nagpa-nails at footspa ako para kahit paano mabawasan ang stress. Pagkatapos, napansin ko yung simbahan malapit sa salon. Biglang pumasok sa isip ko na matagal na pala akong hindi nakakadalaw, kaya tumuloy ako.

Doon, ibinuhos ko lahat kay Lord. Sabi ko, *""Lord, nahihirapan na ako. Pagod na ako mentally.""* Halo-halo na ang bigat—sa work, sa relasyon. Pero tinapos ko ang dasal ko sa pagsasabing, *""Alam kong may dahilan ang lahat ng ito. Kung ano man ang plano Niyo, tatanggapin ko.""* Gumaan ang pakiramdam ko paglabas ng simbahan. Sabi nga nila, minsan kailangan mo lang talagang ilabas sa Kanya.

Monday came. Balik sa routine. WFH ako pero tuwing lunch, pinupuntahan ko siya sa pop-up coffee shop niya para tumulong sa bulk orders. Dahil may meeting ako after lunch, nag-stay lang ako sa loob ng sasakyan na naka-park sa tapat.

Habang nasa meeting, may dumating na babae. Napansin ko kung gaano siya ka-komportable sa paligid ng BF ko. Bigla akong kinabahan, yung tipong naramdaman ko ang mabilis na daloy ng dugo sa buong katawan ko. Alam ko na ’to. Pagkatapos ng meeting, huminga ako nang malalim, inayos ang gamit, at lumapit sa kanila.

Pinilit kong maging kalmado. Diretsong tingin sa mata. Tinanong ko siya: *""Sino siya?""* Ang sagot ng BF ko: *""Mommy siya ng isa kong anak.""* Naguluhan ako. *""Isang anak? Iba pa sa kambal?""* *""Oo,""* sagot niya.

Biglang sumabat yung babae, *""Sino ka?""* Sabi ko, *""Sa pagkakaalam ko, 5 years na kami.""* Nagulat siya. *""5 years?! Eh, 7 years na kami!""*

Doon na nag-sink in ang lahat. Sabi ko sa kanya, *""Pasensya ka na, hindi ko alam na nage-exist ka.""* Nagtanong pa yung babae, *""Kilala mo ba yung asawa niya? Yung mommy ng kambal?""*

Asawa. Ibang anak. Ibang babae. Ang dami palang ""kami.""

Tinanong pa ako ng babae kung saan ako nagtatrabaho o kung may anak ba kami. Hindi ko na sinagot. Ayoko nang ikwento na nabuntis din ako pero nakunan—na may nawala rin sa akin. Sabi ko na lang sa kanya, *""Hindi ko alam na nandyan ka. Hindi mo kailangan papiliin siya sa ating dalawa dahil may anak kayo. Hindi na rin tamang magstay pa ako dito. Pasensya na, wala talaga akong alam.""*

Tumalikod ako at naglakad palayo. Noong nakalayo na ako, doon na bumuhos ang lahat ng iyak na kinimkim ko. Ang sakit isipin na sobrang daming nasayang—oras, pera, pangarap.

Ngayon, nasa isang masaya at healthy relationship na ako. Mas maingat na ako, at hindi na nagbubulag-bulagan sa red flags. Hinding-hindi ko makakalimutan ang pagbisita ko sa simbahan nung araw na 'yun. Akala ko, dasal lang ang ginagawa ko, pero 'yun na pala ang paraan ni Lord para tuluyan na akong ilayo sa taong pabigat sa buhay ko.

My Advice: Natutunan ko na kapag humingi ka ng sign kay Lord, ibibigay Niya 'yun sa paraang hindi mo inaasahan. Minsan, kailangan Niyang basagin ang puso mo para mailayo ka sa mas masakit na bukas.

I realized I was spending way too much time manually naming files or scrubbing through timelines just because I forgot where a specific shot was.

So, we built a tool to fix it. It's a local Mac app that acts like a 'visual brain' for your storage. Instead of you tagging files, the AI 'watches' your footage and auto tag it for you.

**What it actually does:**

* **Auto-Tagging:** It scans your video and audio to tag names, key points, topics, and even specific objects.
* **Visual Search:** You can search for a person, an object, or even a description (like 'person laughing at a coffee shop') and it jumps to the exact frame.

Also, we do not want our data to be on cloud, so we actually make this app 100% local. People can even use it without internet connection.

I've been using it every day to organize my raw footage and even meeting recordings. A few other editors have started using it to tag their raw dailies, too.

Right now, it's optimized for Mac (M-series chips), but Windows is coming soon. I'm looking for more people to play with beta and give me some honest 'reality check' feedback.

Coorg is known for coffee plantation hills with cool weather. So most couple friendly resorts are located away from busy town areas often inside plantations or surrounded by greenery.

I have visited Coorg 2 times. The first time, I stayed in a regular hotel near the main market. It was convenient but it didn’t feel special. There was traffic noise and the atmosphere felt like any other hill town.

On my second visit, I chose a plantation style resort. The difference was clear from the moment I arrived. There was more space fewer people and calm environment thats what I was searching for. Morning walks through misty paths and quiet evenings made the trip feel more personal.

Resort for couples in Coorg offers:

\* Private cottages or villas

\* views

\* In room dining

\* Spa services or wellness treatments

\* Quiet common areas

Some well known properties, like Evolve Back Coorg, are often mentioned by travelers looking for private and luxury stay. These types of resorts focus on experience architecture inspired by local culture, estate surroundings rather than just providing a room.

The “right” resort depends on what you’re looking for. If you want luxury experiences, plantation resorts work well. If you just need a base to explore Coorg simple hotel may be enough.

In short, resort for couples in Coorg is less about the label it is more about the atmosphere and privacy and experience with nature. You are choosing a place where you can slow down yourself and enjoy nature and spend uninterrupted time together.

If you live in Gurgaon, you know the daily struggle. You love the ambition of the city, the high-rises, and the career growth. But let’s be honest—you hate the noise. The constant honking, the concrete heat, and the feeling that you are living in a construction zone.

Most of us have accepted that ""peace"" is something you only find on vacation. But [**Emaar Serenity Hills** in **Sector 86** ](https://www.trueassetsconsultancy.com/property-details/emaar-sector-86-gurgaon)is challenging that idea.

It is not just another cluster of towers; it is an attempt to bring a hill station vibe to the middle of New Gurgaon. If you are looking for a home that feels like a retreat, this might be the most important launch of 2026.

https://preview.redd.it/t4gxxfir5vig1.jpg?width=275&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3a9c192ebeec11d3246b6d38faec5c29ca520005

# A ""Forest"" First, Apartment Second

The biggest problem with modern housing societies? They feel like concrete jungles. You look out of your window and see… another window.

Emaar Serenity Hills flips the script. The project is spread over roughly **25 acres**, but here is the kicker: the building footprint is kept incredibly low. We are talking about massive central greens, landscaped meadows, and water bodies that actually look natural.

When you walk in, you don't feel the ""heaviness"" of a high-density project. You feel space. For a family raising kids, having **8 acres of central greens** means your children have a park that feels like a park, not a small patch of grass next to a parking lot.

# The 3 & 4 BHK Experience

Emaar knows how to design luxury that is actually livable. The **3 and 4 BHK apartments** here aren't just boxes with fancy tiles; they are designed for light.

* **Sun-Kissed Living:** Most units are three-side open. This sounds like a technical detail, but in real life, it means you don't need to switch on the lights at 4 PM. Your home breathes.
* **The ""Deck"" Life:** The balconies here are designed to be used. They are wide enough for a proper coffee table and chairs, giving you a private spot to watch the sunset over the Aravalis or the internal greens.

# Connectivity Without the Chaos

Sector 86 is in that ""Goldilocks"" zone of New Gurgaon. You are far enough from the clutter of the old city to enjoy cleaner air, but you are strategically connected to everything that matters.

* **NH-48 Access:** You can hit the main highway in minutes, making the drive to Manesar or Cyber City straightforward.
* **The Dwarka Expressway:** With the expressway now fully functional, the IGI Airport is roughly a 25-30 minute drive. You are connected to the world, but you sleep in a sanctuary.

# The ""Emaar"" Assurance

In a market where delays are common and promises are often broken, the name **Emaar** carries weight. They are the folks who built the Burj Khalifa, and in India, their track record (think *Palm Springs* or *DigiHomes*) speaks for itself.

Investing in **Emaar Serenity Hills Sector 86 Gurgaon** means you aren't gambling your life savings. You are putting your money into a brand that delivers quality that lasts. You won't find peeling paint or leaking basements here a year after moving in.

# The Verdict

This project is for the person who is done with the ""hustle culture"" at home. If you want a house where you can actually hear the birds chirp instead of the traffic, this is it.

Above is the link to Part 1 and below we continue forward.



By 11:30 PM, the storm was a full-blown war zone outside. 

The lights began to flicker, the filament in the bulbs whining as the power struggled. Then, the phone rang again.

Rochelle picked it up. ""Hello? Ma?"" Silence. She hung up. It rang again instantly. ""Hello? This isn't funny!"" Silence.

The third time, Rico snatched it. ""Whoever this is, we're calling the—""

He stopped. His face went a sickly shade of grey. He held the receiver out so we could all hear. 

At first, it was just static. Then, a wet, bubbling gurgle, like someone trying to breathe through a throat full of blood. 

Then, a scream—sharp, distorted, and so loud it sounded like it was being ripped out of the person's lungs—erupted from the earpiece.

Rico slammed the phone back onto the base, his hands shaking.

The basement pipes began to rattle, a frantic clink-clink-clink that sounded like teeth chattering.

""Something's on the roof,"" Tasha gasped.





She was right. Above the sound of the rain, we heard it: 

Thump. Drag. Thump. Heavy, deliberate footsteps pacing the length of the house directly above our heads.

Suddenly, the backyard exploded into noise. We heard the chain-link fence rattling violently, the gate being slammed against the post over and over. 

Trash cans were being hurled against the siding of the house. We huddled together and moved toward the back window, peering out into the storm.

A flash of lightning lit up the field. There, in the House across the field, we saw it. 

A figure was pacing behind the glass of the main window. It stopped mid-stride. 

It turned its head—that long, horrific snout—and looked directly at us. It didn't move. 

It just stared, a black silhouette against the white flash of the sky. 

The lights flickered, and when the next bolt of lightning hit, the window was empty.

BANG! BANG! BANG!





The noise moved to the attic. It sounded like someone was taking a sledgehammer to the rafters. 

Tyson grabbed the baseball bat, and he and I crept to the attic pull-down stairs. 

We shoved the door open, the beam of the flashlight cutting through the dust.

Empty. Just old boxes and cobwebs.

By 2:00 AM, the house was under siege. 

The banging moved to the front door, then the windows, then the walls. 

It was unrelenting—a rhythmic, heavy pounding that felt like the house was being Tenderized. 

Screams that didn't sound human—high-pitched squeals mixed with a woman's sobbing—poured in from the darkness outside. 

We saw shadows passing the windows, tall and distorted, moving faster than any person could.





Exhaustion finally started to win. By 4:00 AM, the adrenaline had burned out, leaving us hollow.

We drifted into a fitful, terrifying sleep, huddled together on the living room floor. Every time I closed my eyes, I heard the snort of the Pig-Lady in the hallway, but when I woke, the hall was empty.

At 7:30 AM, the sun rose, grey and sickly. We were all awake, staring at each other in the dim light, too tired to even speak.

A soft sliding sound came from under the couch.

We all looked down. 

Rochelle’s missing Trigonometry textbook slid out from the shadows of the sofa, as if pushed by an invisible hand. 

It flipped open to the center page.

Across the diagrams and equations, someone had used a thick, black marker to scribble three words in jagged, frantic handwriting:

I SEE YOU

The scream that left Tasha's throat was the sound of someone who had finally broken.





Sunday morning didn't feel like a day of rest. 

It felt like the morning after a funeral where the body hadn't quite stayed in the casket. 

The air in the living room was thick, not just with the humidity from the departing storm, 

but with the jagged edges of six people who had reached their breaking point.

""Look, the book is weird, okay? I get it,"" Rochelle said, her voice projecting a shaky authority as she stood in the center of the room. 

""But we are spiraling. The storm was crazy, that movie was dark, and we’re all exhausted. Our minds are just… filling in the blanks. 

We’re going to clean this house, we’re going to act like normal teenagers, 

and we’re going to stop letting a pile of wood across the street ruin our weekend.""

""And the message?"" Tasha asked, pointing a trembling finger at the open textbook on the coffee table. 

""I SEE YOU. You think the wind wrote that, Ro?""

Kim stepped up, crossing her arms over her chest. ""I bet it was one of the boys. Probably Tyson. He’s been acting extra 'scary' all night.





You wrote it last night to mess with us, didn't you?""

""I didn't touch that damn book, Kim!"" Tyson barked, his eyes bloodshot. 

""I spent the night clutching a baseball bat. I wasn't exactly in the mood for arts and crafts.""

""Say I did do it,"" Rico added, stepping in. ""Which I didn't. How do you explain it sliding out from under the couch on its own just now? 

You know many books that have legs? You know many books that hide for two days then decide to make an entrance?""

The silence that followed was heavy. 

Logic was failing us. 

We spent the next hour cleaning in a sort of frantic, desperate silence—scrubbing away the physical mess of the night to try 

and scrub away the memory of it. 

By 10:00 AM, the house was spotless, but we still felt filthy.

Rochelle finally broke the tension with a forced, playful roll of her eyes.

 ""Alright, enough. Every single one of you smells like ass and terror. We’re doing a shower rotation. Pick a number 1 through 10.""

We shouted out numbers. 

Rochelle grinned. ""One. I’m first. The rest of you, get your bags ready. 

Lowest number to highest. No more ghost talk. We’re getting fly, we’re getting fresh, and we’re resetting this vibe.""

The order was set: Rochelle, Tasha, Tyson, Rico, Kim, and finally, me.





As the shower started thundering down the hall, the mood lightened, if only because we were desperate for a diversion. 

We started pulling our ""Sunday best"" out of our bags, bragging about who had the best fit.

Rochelle came out first, looking radiant in a flowy, floral sundress, her long hair damp and smelling like coconut. 

Tasha followed, emerging a bit later in a high-fashion cropped sweater and pleated skirt, her curls tight and perfect. 

When Tyson came out, he was rocking a t-shirt with a vintage Biggie Smalls print and baggy jeans, his fade sharp. Rico joined us next, looking unusually sophisticated in dark slacks and a crisp, white button-up, his ponytail sleekly tied back.

""Look at Rico trying to be a grown-up,"" Kim teased, leaning against the wall.

As Kim was about to enter the bathroom, she turned and gave me that sharp, dangerous smile.

""Ant, you know you want to take a shower with me. Stop playing.""

""Girl, you wish,"" Rico blurted out, making Tasha chuckle.

I leaned back, deciding to call her bluff. ""Alright then, Kim. Let's go. No shame in my game.""

Kim’s eyes widened for a split second before she turned shy, her hand fluttering to my arm. 

""You know I’m just teasing… you couldn't handle all this anyway.""





When Kim finished her turn, she looked stunning—a beauty with her long hair cascading over a white tube top and a denim mini-skirt.

Kim did a little spin, headed my way and she gave a playful touch on my arm.

As she touched me, I glanced over her shoulder. Tasha was at the window again. 

""I think I saw something,"" she whispered. ""Just now. In the attic window of that house. A face… or a mask.""

""Don't start, Tasha,"" Rico groaned. ""Ant, get in the shower. You’re the last one. Go.""

I headed into the bathroom. The room was like a sauna, thick with the floral and musky scents of five different body washes. 

Steam hung in the air like a heavy curtain. I stripped down and stepped into the spray, letting the hot water wash away the grit of the last two days.

Creak.

I froze. The bathroom door had rattled.

""Rico?"" I called out. ""I'm in here, man!""

No answer. I felt a sudden, sharp spike of nerves. 

The steam seemed to thicken, swirling around the shower curtain. 

Then, without warning, the curtain was ripped back.





I jumped, nearly slipping on the wet porcelain. 

Kim stood there, her eyes wide, staring at me with a grin that went from ear to ear. 

She was blushing a deep rose color, stumbling back a step.

""Oh my... damn,"" she whispered, her gaze lingering. ""Ant, I… I didn't think you’d actually be…""

But her smile didn't just fade—it evaporated. Her face went bone-white. She wasn't looking at me anymore. 

She was looking past me, at the steam-covered mirror behind the sink.

""No... no, that can't be right,"" she stammered.

I stepped out of the shower, grabbing a towel, and looked. Written in the thick fog on the glass, 

as if a finger had traced the words while I was behind the curtain, was a single sentence:

YOU CAN RUN BUT YOU CAN'T HIDE

""I didn't do that, Kim,"" I whispered, the hair on my arms standing up. ""I was in the water the whole time.""

""I just walked in!"" she cried. ""I didn't touch the glass!""

She bolted for the door, screaming for the others. 





A minute later, all six of us were crammed into the small, humid bathroom. 

We stood there—Rochelle in her floral dress, Tasha in her curls, Tyson in his Biggie shirt, Rico in his button-up, Kim in her tube top, 

and me, standing there in my nice jeans and pinstriped shirt, damp and trembling.

""Why were you even in here, Kim?"" Tasha asked, her voice tight with suspicion.

""Sightseeing,"" Kim muttered, but the joke lacked any sting.

""Ooh, girl, you nasty,"" Rico and Rochelle said in unison, but their eyes were fixed on the mirror.

""I don't think we should have ever gone into that house,"" Tyson said quietly. His voice was hollow, the bravado of his rapper-tee completely gone.

""I know we shouldn't have,"" Tasha agreed.

It was barely 11:30 AM on Sunday morning.

We were all dressed up, looking our best, ready for a day that would never come. 

The message on the mirror was still dripping, the word ""HIDE"" weeping down the glass like a tear.





By 1:00 PM, the ""Sunday reset"" was a total failure. 

We were all dressed in our best clothes—crisp shirts, fresh denim, hair laid perfectly—but we looked like people dressed for their own viewings at a funeral home. 

The house was too quiet, yet somehow too loud.

Every time the floorboards settled, it sounded like a footstep. Every time the wind brushed the siding, it sounded like a whisper.

""We can't just sit here,"" I said, pacing the living room. ""If we sit here, we’re just waiting for that mirror to write something else. 

We need to know what we’re dealing with.""

""Know what?"" Rico asked, leaning against the wall, his shirt looking wrinkled already from his constant fidgeting.

""That the house is haunted? We know that, Ant. We lived it.""

""No,"" Rochelle said, her eyes sharp. ""Ant’s right. Grandma used to say there’s no such thing as a new ghost. 

Everything has a beginning. We’re going to the library. We’re looking at the old city records.""





The walk was a nightmare in slow motion. 

We passed through the park again, but the air felt like it was thickening, turning into a syrup that was hard to push through. 

Every time we passed a parked car, I saw a reflection in the hubcaps—a tall, bent figure walking right in the middle of our group. 

But when I looked at Rico or Tyson next to me, there was nothing but empty pavement.

At the gas station, the overhead fluorescent lights hummed with an aggressive, buzzing frequency that made my teeth ache. 

The clerk didn't even look up; he just stared at a small black-and-white TV that was showing nothing but static.

By 3:00 PM, we were huddled in the basement of the local library, surrounded by the smell of vanilla and rot—old paper and damp stone.

""Look at this,"" Tasha whispered, her voice cracking. 

She had a micro reader pulled up, scrolling through archives from decades ago.





We crowded around the glowing screen. 

It was a vague crime report from the late '70s. Location: Faircrest Ave. The report was brief, almost dismissive. 

It detailed a missing person call. The responding officers found the house empty.

No signs of a struggle. No blood. 

The only thing they noted was that the homeowner’s pigs kept in a makeshift pen in the cellar—were ""unusually well-fed and aggressive."" 

The case was closed after a week. 

Reason: Homeowner departed of own accord.

""Well-fed,"" Tasha repeated, her curls casting long, jagged shadows across the screen. 

""Just like my grandma said. They didn't find a body because there wasn't enough left of her to call a body.""

The shock hit us like a physical weight. Tasha's ghost story wasn't a story at all. It was a police record.

Rico pulled a stack of urban legend books and ""Real Ghost Sightings of the Great Lakes"" off the shelves. 

""Maybe there's a way to make it stop,"" he muttered, flipping through pages of rituals and hauntings. 

""Maybe we just have to acknowledge it.""

""I don't want to acknowledge it. I want to eat,"" Kim said, her voice brittle. 

""I can't think on an empty stomach. Let's just... let's go to the diner. Please. I need to see people. Normal people.""





We checked out the books and began the trek to the local diner. 

The feeling of being followed was no longer a suggestion; it was a certainty. 

It felt like a cold hand was hovering an inch from the back of my neck. We walked faster, 

our conversation turning into a frantic, overlapping mess of plans and fears.

""What are you getting, Ant?"" Tyson asked, trying to break the tension. 

""I’m getting the biggest burger they got. If I’m gonna go out, I’m going out full.""

""Burger sounds good,"" I said, my eyes darting to every alleyway we passed. ""But you see that? Behind that fence?""

""Don't look, Ant,"" Rochelle hissed. ""Just keep walking.""

We reached the diner around 5:45 PM. The bell chimed, and the warmth of the grill hit us, but the unease didn't lift. 

We sat in a large booth, spreading the library books out among the milkshakes and fries. 

Every so often, Tasha would gasp, pointing at a drawing of a ""hush-hider"" or a ""skin-shifter,"" but nothing looked like the snout-faced woman we had seen.





The air in the diner felt tight, like the oxygen was being sucked out of the room. 

I looked at the waitress—a young girl who looked exhausted—and for a second, her face blurred, her nose elongating into something wet and pink. 

I blinked, and she was just a girl again, holding a check.

We left around 8:00 PM. The sun was gone, replaced by a sky the color of charcoal.

The walk back to Faircrest was the longest of my life. 

The streetlights didn't just flicker; they pulsed like a dying heart. 

The sounds of the city—the distant sirens, the barking dogs—all seemed to be screaming at once, then falling into a terrifying, sudden silence. 

Shadows intensified, stretching across the road until they looked like reaching fingers.

As we turned the corner onto our block, we all stopped.





The House across the field was waiting. It looked darker than the night around it, a hole in reality. 

And there, in the highest window—the attic—was a shadow.

It wasn't moving. It was standing perfectly still, its silhouette unmistakable. 

It was staring directly at us, watching six kids return to the trap.

""She's waiting,"" Tasha whispered.

And then, the shadow leaned forward, its head tilting at a sickening, unnatural angle, as if it were listening to our hearts beat from across the field.

The front door hadn't even been locked for five seconds when the first crack of thunder split the sky. 

It wasn't just a storm; it was a physical weight dropping onto our block.

""Seriously?"" Tyson's voice was a ragged edge of disbelief. ""Again? It’s like the sky is trying to drown us so we can't leave.""





The atmosphere in the house was suffocating.

I leaned against the wall, my head spinning with the police reports and the image of that shadow in the attic window.

On the couch, the girls were huddled together. I saw Kim whisper something to Rochelle and Tasha, her eyes darting to me. 

She made a wide gesture with her hands.

Despite the terror, they let out small, hysterical giggles. 

Kim looked at me with a hunger, while Tasha looked intrigued and Rochelle just looked shocked.

""Y'all really laughing right now?"" I asked, my voice flat. ""We’re under siege.""

""I think I found it!"" Tyson yelled from the coffee table, slamming a heavy, leather-bound urban legend book down.

""Not sure, but this has to be it,"" Rico added, leaning over his shoulder. 

They started talking at once, cutting each other off in a frantic blur of information.

""Shut up! One at a time!"" Rochelle snapped.



Tyson took a breath. ""The book says spirits don't just stay because they’re mean. They stay because of a tether. If they died in terror, or if their 'resting spot' was desecrated. Ant, the city tore those houses down. They bulldozed her life while she was probably still under the floorboards.""

""What if,"" Rico started, but Tasha cut him off, her eyes wide and beaming with a terrifying clarity.

""What if something of hers remains?"" she whispered. 

""Something they didn't bulldoze. Something still in that cellar.""

THUD-THUD-THUD.

The basement and the attic erupted at the same time. 





It sounded like heavy boots were sprinting across the ceiling while something massive was slamming against the pipes below.

""Fuck,"" I whispered, the word feeling small against the noise.

""No,"" Rochelle said, her voice rising. ""You can’t mean we have to—""

""Damn,"" Kim added, her bravado finally shattering. ""I don’t want to do that.""

""We need to go back into the house,"" Tyson, Tasha, and Rico said in a chilling, accidental unison.

""Are you insane?"" I stepped away from the wall. 

""Look what happened just because we touched the porch! We’ve been followed, whispered to, and toyed with all day. 

You go into her domain, who knows what that bitch will do to us!""

""If we don't, we’re just waiting to die in here!"" Rico screamed.





Rochelle retreated to the kitchen, her hands over her ears. 

Suddenly, the house phone didn't just ring—it flew off the wall, a wet, slurping gurgle began to pour out of the receiver. 

Rochelle frantically unplugged it from the wall jack, but the sound didn't stop. 

It got louder. 

The unplugged phone was screaming a woman’s agony into the kitchen air.

Then, the world went black.

The power didn't just flicker; it died. 

I looked out the window. 

The entire block was swallowed in a void. 

No streetlights. 

No porch lights. 

Just the rain.

I looked toward the abandoned house. A single, faint candlelight flickered in the parlor window. And then, she was there.

Not a shadow. 

Not a reflection.





The Pig-Lady was standing right against the glass of Rico's living room window, inches from my face. 

Up close, she was a nightmare of biology. 

Her skin was the color of a drowned corpse, stretched tight over a massive, thick neck. 

The snout was raw, weeping pink fluid, with jagged yellow tusks piercing through her lower lip. 

Her eyes were tiny, black, and filled with an ancient, predatory intelligence.

I scrambled back, falling over the coffee table, my heart stopping in my chest.

For the next twenty minutes, the house was a drum. 

Banging, rattling, and scratching engulfed us from every direction. It was a swarm of sound, a physical assault on our senses. 

Then, as quickly as it started, it fell into a deafening silence.

Rico and Rochelle moved like ghosts, fumbling through the dark until they found three heavy mag-lite flashlights and a box of batteries.

""We have to go,"" Rico whispered.

A flash of lightning illuminated the room. 





A massive, towering shadow of the Pig-Lady was projected onto the living room wall, looming over us like a god of the slaughterhouse. 

It lingered for three seconds, then faded into the dark.

""I can't... I can't do this,"" Kim sobbed, clutching my pinstriped shirt.

""We don't have a choice,"" I said, my voice shaking as I took one of the flashlights. 

""She's not letting us stay, and she's not letting us leave. The only way is through.""

We stood at the front door, six kids clutching each other as the storm raged outside. 

We stepped out into the rain, the flashlights cutting weak holes in the darkness, heading toward the house that shouldn't be there.

The field didn't feel like dirt and weeds anymore. 

It felt like a vast, black ocean, and the House was a jagged rock waiting to wreck us. 

We had only been walking for thirty seconds, but the space between Rico’s porch and that rotting Victorian stretched. 





The darkness was a physical thing, swallowing the light from our flashlights as soon as it left the lenses.

""Stay in the light! Just stay in the light!"" Kim hissed, her voice cracking. 

She, Tasha, and Rochelle were huddled so close together they were tripping over each other.

I saw the terror in their eyes and handed my flashlight to Kim. Rico followed my lead, handing his to Tasha. 

Rochelle already had the heavy mag-lite. 

The three of them held the beams like shields, creating small, shaking circles of yellow light against the grey, rain-slicked wood of the House.

We reached the porch. The storm was screaming now, soaking our clothes until they felt like lead weights.

""Open it,"" Tyson whispered, his jaw set.

Rochelle reached for the knob. 





It wouldn't budge. 

We pushed. 

We kicked. 

The wood felt like solid iron. 

From behind the door, the sound started—a wet, rhythmic sliding, like a massive slab of meat being dragged across salt. 

It grew louder, punctuated by that congested, bubbling snort.

""It’s trying to keep us out!"" Tasha cried, the beam of her flashlight dancing wildly.

""Or it’s holding the door shut from the other side,"" Rico growled. 

""Ant, Tyson—on three!""

The three of us threw our shoulders against the door.

Once. 

Twice. 

The house groaned, a deep, structural sound that felt like a warning. 

On the fifth try, the frame splintered with a sound like a gunshot, and the door burst open.





The air inside was stagnant and smelled of copper and old grease. 

Shadows didn't just sit in the corners; they danced, elongating along the peeling wallpaper as the girls' flashlights swept the room. 

Disembodied whispers—high, chattering sounds that weren't quite human—drifted from the vents.

""What are we even looking for?"" Kim whispered, her light trembling. ""A heart? A bone? What binds a monster?""

""Anything that doesn't belong,"" I said, though nothing in this nightmare felt like it belonged.

Suddenly, a flash of movement. 

The Pig-Lady appeared at the end of the dining room, her hunched back silhouetted by Tasha’s light. 

She vanished before the beam could fully find her, leaving only deep, fresh claw marks gouged into the plaster. 

She was taunting us, skittering through the walls like a roach.

""Second floor,"" Rochelle commanded. ""We clear it and move up.""





The moment our feet hit the second-floor landing, the House lost its mind. 

The floorboards bucked and shook. 

A heavy oak nightstand in the master bedroom suddenly took flight, hurling itself across the room and shattering against the wall inches from Rico’s head.

""She’s getting angry!"" Rico yelled over the roar of the house.

At the end of the long, narrow hallway, she appeared again. 

This time, she didn't run. She stood tall, her elongated limbs twitching. 

She opened her maw a horrific mess of tusks and grey tongue and let out a scream. 

It wasn't a vocal sound; it was the sound of a thousand pigs being slaughtered, mixed with a woman’s desperate sob.

""Hide! Into the room!"" 





I lunged for the nearest doorway.

We huddled in the dark, the six of us breathing in syncopated gasps. 

""She’s right there,"" Tasha whimpered. ""She’s right outside the door.""

I waited until the screaming faded into a low, gurgled humming. 

I poked my head out. 

The hall was empty, but the walls were weeping a dark, oily fluid.

""Coast is clear. Move,"" I whispered.

We finished the second floor, finding nothing but decay. 

The only place left was up. 





The attic. 

We climbed the narrow, winding stairs, the wood screaming under our shoes.

The attic was a whirlwind of chaos. 

As soon as we stepped inside, the room began to shake uncontrollably. 

Old trunks burst open, shattering against the rafters. 

Then, from the dark corner, a black cloud erupted. 

A flock of starlings, hundreds of them, shrieked as they flew directly at us, their wings beating against our faces 

before they smashed through the attic window and into the storm.

""Look at the wall!"" Kim screamed.

A shadow loomed over us. 

It wasn't our shadow. It was hers.





Then, a sound came from far below. 

Not from the attic. 

Not from the second floor. 

A deafening, earth-shaking shriek echoed up from the very bowels of the structure.

""The basement,"" Tasha whispered, her eyes wide with a horrific realization. 

""Tyson, the report said the pigs were in the cellar. The tether... it’s under our feet.""

The House went pitch black as the girls' flashlights flickered and dimmed, the air turning ice-cold. 

We were in her throat now, and she was starting to swallow.





The descent to the basement was a trip into a throat. 

The air grew thick, humid, and smelled so strongly of copper and raw sewage that Kim had to cover her mouth to keep from gagging. 

The flashlights were dying, the beams yellowing and flickering as if the house itself were draining the batteries.

""The cellar,"" Tasha whispered, her voice trembling. 

""The report... the pigs... it all ends down here.""





We reached the bottom of the wooden stairs. 

The basement floor wasn't concrete; it was packed dirt, slick with a black, oily moisture. 

In the center of the room sat a massive, cast-iron furnace, its rusted pipes reaching upward like the ribcage of a titan.

""Look for it!"" Tyson hissed. ""The tether! Anything that doesn't belong!""

Suddenly, the temperature plummeted. 

Our breath came out in thick white plumes. 

From the darkness behind the furnace, a wet, rhythmic thud-thud-thud emerged.

Rochelle turned her light toward the sound. 

The Pig-Lady was there, crouched in a way that no human spine should allow. 





She didn't scream this time. 

She moved with a terrifying, silent fluidity. 

Before Rico could scream, she was on him. 

She didn't bite—she simply reached out an elongated, grey finger and touched his bare forearm.

Rico let out a sound I will never forget—a choked, guttural whimper. 

Where she touched him, the skin instantly blackened and withered, a permanent, rotted brand. 

He collapsed, clutching his arm.

""GET AWAY FROM HIM!"" I yelled.

She snarled, a sound like steam escaping a pipe, and vanished into the shadows.

""The furnace!"" Rochelle shouted, her light hitting the rusted ash door of the old heater. 

""Look inside!""

Tyson kicked the iron door open.

We leaned in, our lights converging on the grey ash inside. 

There, nestled in the soot, was a jagged, yellowed piece of a human jawbone. 

It was small—delicate—still holding three blackened teeth.

""That's it,"" I whispered. ""That's her. That's what's left.""





The house screamed then. 

Not the walls—the structure. 

The dirt floor began to heave. 

The Pig-Lady materialized at the foot of the stairs, her body stretching and warping until she blocked our only exit. 

She let out a roar that vibrated the very marrow in our bones.

""WE HAVE TO BURY IT!"" Tasha screamed. ""THE SOIL OUTSIDE!""

""Ant, take the girls and the bone! GO!"" Tyson yelled, stepping forward. Rico, ashen-faced and clutching his arm, stood beside him. 

""We’ll hold her! RUN!""

""No! We stay together!"" I protested.

""GO, ANTHONY!"" Rico roared, the terror in his voice replaced by a desperate, final bravado.

Tyson and Rico lunged at the entity, their shouts lost in her deafening squeal. 





In the chaos, I grabbed the jawbone it was ice-cold, but burning my palm and I shoved the girls toward a small, high coal-chute window. 

We scrambled through the narrow opening, skin tearing on the rusted metal, and tumbled into the mud and rain of the field.

""Bury it! Deep!"" I shouted.

We fell to our knees in the center of the sour dirt, clawing at the earth with our bare hands. 

The rain turned the dirt to a thick, black sludge. 

Behind us, the House was convulsing. 

Light—sickly, strobe like flashes erupted from every window.

""Down here!"" Rochelle cried, slamming the jawbone into a hole and mashing the dirt over it.

As the last bit of white bone disappeared beneath the mud, a sound like a thunderclap echoed from the House. 





The side of the Victorian exploded. 

Siding, ancient timber, and shards of glass flew into the night like shrapnel.

The Pig-Lady burst through the wreckage. She stood on the edge of the field, silhouetted by the lightning. 

She let out a sound that defied nature—a layered, agonizing howl that started as a woman’s cry and ended as a mechanical shriek.

Tyson and Rico burst out of the front door a second later, sprinting for their lives as the House began to fold.

It didn't fall down. It fell in. 

The walls bent like wet paper, the roof spinning into the center of the structure. 

A massive cloud of grey dust and white fog billowed outward, swallowing the field, the Pig-Lady, and the sky.

We huddled together in the mud, shielding our faces.





Slowly, the dust settled. 

The rain began to wash away the haze.

We looked up.

The House was gone. 

There was no rubble. 

No broken glass. 

No splintered wood. 

Not even a footprint in the dirt where the foundation had been. 

The field was perfectly, terrifyingly flat. Just dirt, weeds, and the memory of a nightmare.





""Is it over?"" Kim whispered, soaked and muddy, her long hair matted to her face.

""She's gone,"" Tasha breathed, staring at the spot where we buried the bone.

Rico sat in the mud, staring at his arm. 

The black, hoof-shaped brand remained, a dark reminder that some things can't be buried. 

Tyson dropped, his Biggie shirt torn to rags.

Looking back at Rico’s house, which sat silent and dark across the street. I whispered, ""It’s just a field again.""

""No,"" Rochelle said, her voice hollow. 

""It’s a grave. And we’re the only ones who know who’s in it.""





I didn't speak of that house after that day. 

Not to my mom, not to the police, and eventually, not even to the people who were there with me.

We stayed in Rico’s living room that final Sunday night, huddled together with every light in the house blazing once the power flickered back on. 

We didn't sleep. 

We didn't even close our eyes. We just sat there, listening to the silence of the field—a silence that felt heavier than the screams had ever been.





Days turned into weeks, and for a while, we were inseparable. 

We were bound by the dirt under our fingernails and the copper smell that wouldn't leave our clothes. 

We would meet up every day after school, sitting on Rico’s porch, staring at the empty lot. 

We were waiting for it to come back. 

We were waiting for the ground to heave again.

But it never did.





Weeks turned into months, and the trauma began to do what time always does: it eroded the edges. 

The shared looks became too painful. 

Every time I looked at Rico, I saw him scratching at that black, hoof-shaped brand on his arm—a mark that never faded, never scarred, just stayed there like a piece of charcoal embedded in his skin. 

Every time I saw Tasha, I saw the hollow vacancy in her eyes.





Months turned into years, and the six of us grew apart. 

It wasn't an argument or a falling out. 

It was just an unspoken agreement that to see one another was to remember. 

We moved out of the neighborhood. 

We went to different colleges. 

We changed our numbers.





I think it’s been something like ten years since the last time any of us spoke. 

I heard through the grapevine that Tyson moved down south, trying to find a place where the air didn't smell like Detroit rain. 

I heard Rochelle became a teacher, though they say she never keeps mirrors in her classroom. 

As for Kim and Tasha, they’re just shadows in my memory now.

But no matter how much I wish to forget that damn weekend, no matter how much time has passed, the memory remains fresh, as if it just happened yesterday. I still can't use a microwave without flinching at the beeps. I still can't look at a steamed-up bathroom mirror without my heart stopping.





I just needed someplace to write out my thoughts, and I thought this would be as good of a place as any. 

If you’re ever find yourself on Faircrest in Detroit, and you see a field that looks a little too wide, or a patch of dirt where nothing grows... don't stop. 

Don't look. 

And whatever you do, don't stay for the weekend.",1,1770814949.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False
1r1ws4s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roleplay/comments/1r1ws4s/a_totally_euphoric_story_trans/,A Totally Euphoric Story (Trans),"Heya, thank you for reading this! Lately, I’ve been super into the idea of exploring moments of euphoria in the life of a recently transitioned transwoman. Whether the moment is as mundane as having their name shouted out on a coffee order, or as vain as admiring how amazing they look before a night out, I think it could be a super interesting framework to follow a storyline.

I think there’s so many directions the story could take. Whether the character is in college or exploring the world of work, I would love to brainstorm with you and experiment with some ideas! One particularly interesting way of looking at it is if our heroine does not originally consider themselves trans, but has transitioned for some ulterior motive. Watching them come to terms, and even enjoy, their new life could be fascinating! 

I’m really quite flexible with a lot of the story but I do have a very strong preference for realistic slice of life. Similarly I’m open to either play a single character or GM for you, and I love OOC to flesh out the story and plan what’s next. 

I’m a pretty experienced roleplayer in the GMT timezone and tend to start my stories with quite a bit of background discussion to really flesh out characters. This can range from how they look, to what their job is, to their birthday, to what country or time period this is set - I love getting into the details. Once the story begins I tend to write third person and a few paragraphs per response, but I’m very flexible as long as the story is good! 

If any of this interests you then just send me a chat!",0,1770814932.0,Roleplay,0,0.25,False

1r1wrx3,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/1r1wrx3/on_prices_subjective_value_and_socially_necessary/,"On prices, subjective value, and ""socially necessary labor time.""","I was originally planning to do a very late reply to [this](https://old.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/1qblvps/lets_talk_about_stv/nzcjuop/) and [this](https://old.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/1qblvps/lets_talk_about_stv/nzcadg8/) reply to my comments in the old thread [Let's talk about STV](https://old.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/1qblvps/lets_talk_about_stv/), but found that what I'm communicating is better said together and to everybody.

The below describes how consumer preferences create demand, how that demand go down the supply chain, how the supply constraints then trickle up the supply chain, and gives a 20x shorter variant of Marx' Das Kapital chapter 1 section 3 on where money comes from and ""socially necessary labor time"".

Response to [a comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/1qblvps/lets_talk_about_stv/nzcadg8/) by /u/HeavenlyPossum:

> So subjective preferences create demand, and demand interacts with supply to create prices, and those prices reveal the existence of subjective preferences and demand?

Yes and no.  The price charged to a real person (""the consumer"") more or less reveal to the consumer what the cost in terms of ""socially necessary resource use"" of producing one more of the thing is, including the cost of getting that to the consumer with socially optimal compensation the involved risk.  The consumer then choose to either consume that thing, or to save up their money to be able to consume something else later.  The loss of opportunity when choosing one thing is called ""opportunity cost"", and is what we really compare to when we choose what to consume.

The consumer's actual choice when confronted with different prices reveal the consumer's preferences and create demand, and the demand trickle down the supply chain to create demand there, and the ability to supply at a price trickles up the supply chain and influence the prices there, as shown in the below example.

Response to [a comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/1qblvps/lets_talk_about_stv/nzcjuop/) by /u/MarcusOrlyius:

> By first exchanging the output of my labour for the output of someone else's labour, I show that the output of their labour gives me more utility than the output of my labour. The utility is not equal to the to the output of my labour, it's larger than it.
> 
> Money obfuscates this fact.

Yes.  However, the obfuscation is a side effect of a very useful property: Money abstracts the different types of labour and other resource usage that people can exchange.  It allows a worker to choose between a McDonalds meal each week for a year or a 65"" 4k TV.  Depending on what workers choose in aggregate, we end up spending more resources (worker output+land use++) on the McDonalds side or the TV production side.

If we spend more on the McDonalds side, McDonalds will buy more things (including labor), and this will affect how we allocate resources there.  Let's look at beef.  The market for beef is fairly elastic - if beef is cheaper, people buy more in supermarkets.  If McDonalds buy more beef, they'll have to compete with those supermarkets.  McDonalds do this by paying more for the beef than the supermarkets, increasing the price of beef in supermarkets as well as increasing the cost for McDonalds.

The increased prices means that beef production that was previously not doable (profitable) will now be profitable.  Beef producers can start using land that wasn't productive enough previously or was too costly to use for beef production (since something else was more productive), and the can hire people they could not previously hire by rising wages, pulling them out of other industries.

Comparatively, the TV industry will hire and produce less.

This takes the consumer preference over time, and turn it into production decisions.  If the demand is really high (so the prices go up lots) this happens quickly, as in the shift to mask production at the start of COVID.  For other cases, where the prices are somewhat constant, this happens over longer time periods.

> This, but the ""how"" rather than the ""why"". Basically, what Marx does in Chapter 1, Section 3 of Das Kapital.

Does in a terribly long and hard to read way.  Here's a Gemini-translation of that chapter:
---

### Section 3: The Evolution of Exchange Value

#### 1. The Core Duality: Use Value vs. Value

Every product has two ""personalities"":

* **Physical (Use Value):** Its practical purpose (e.g., iron, grain, or clothing).
* **Social (Value):** Its worth in a market. This isn't a physical property; you can't find it with a microscope. It only appears when one item is compared to another.

#### 2. The Simple Expression of Value (Direct Barter)

The most basic value relationship is: **Item A = Item B** (e.g., 20 yards of linen = 1 coat).

* **The Relative Form:** The linen expresses its value *relative* to the coat. It is the active ""price-seeker"".
* **The Equivalent Form:** The coat serves as the ""measuring stick."" It represents the value of the linen in physical form.
* **The Rule of Polarity:** An item cannot be its own measuring stick. You can't say ""20 yards of linen = 20 yards of linen"" to define its market value; that’s just a tautology.

#### 3. How Value is Measured Quantitatively

If 20 yards of linen = 1 coat, it implies both took the same amount of **Socially Necessary Labor Time** to produce.

* **If Linen becomes easier to make:** (e.g., better looms), its value drops. Now, 40 yards might be needed to get 1 coat.
* **If the Coat becomes harder to make:** (e.g., wool shortage), its value rises. Now, 20 yards of linen might only get you half a coat.

#### 4. The Expanded Form of Value (The ""Shopping List"")

As trade grows, one item is compared to many others:

* 20 yards of linen = 1 coat **OR** 10 lbs of tea **OR** 40 lbs of coffee, etc.
* **The Problem:** This is messy. Value is fragmented across an endless list of different goods, making it hard to find a universal standard.

#### 5. The General Form of Value (The Universal Standard)

The market eventually flips the equation. Instead of one item equal to many, many items are expressed in terms of **one single item**:

* 1 coat = 20 yards of linen
* 10 lbs of tea = 20 yards of linen
* 40 lbs of coffee = 20 yards of linen
In this stage, **linen** becomes the ""Universal Equivalent""—a prototype of money that everyone recognizes as a standard of exchange.

#### 6. The Transition to Money (The Money-Form)

The final step occurs when society agrees to use one specific commodity—usually **Gold**—as this universal standard.

* **Gold as Money:** Gold is essentially a ""socially recognized"" version of the linen example above.
* **The Price Form:** Once gold is the standard, the ""Relative Value"" of a commodity becomes its **Price** (e.g., 20 yards of linen = 2 ounces of gold, or £2).

**Summary of the Logic:**

1. **Direct Barter** (A = B)
2. **Expanded Barter** (A = B or C or D)
3. **Standardized Exchange** (B, C, and D all = A)
4. **Money/Price** (B, C, and D all = Gold/Currency)

---

That's 495 words instead of 9536 words for the concrete part of Marx'  section on development of money and ""socially necessary labor time"".

If you read the McDonalds vs TV example above about the trickle down of costs through supply/demand, you'll see it also deals with the socially necessary labor allocation, based on higher prices in one sector resulting re-allocation of labor, and it deals with effective real capital and land use (which Marx ignores).",1,1770814915.0,CapitalismVSocialism,1,0.67,False

Two years later (just outside the warranty), the cheap plastic tubing failed on our Delonghi and the machine is leaking. Not so much that it’s unusable, but enough that we need to start thinking about a replacement. We don’t want something with cheap innerds, so we started looking for a similar alternative but better built. The Breville Barrista Express Impress seems to meet our needs, but I’ve been reading about the option to get the Bambino Plus with a superior grinder (DF54).

I don’t know how well we would adjust to a separate grinder, how easy it is to use, or if the Impress is a good replacement for our Specialista. We like really good coffee but we’re not yet at the “spend time and money to make it the best” stage.

I've seen a couple of videos of the aeropress being used as a no-bypass brewer and got intrigued. I like the coffee aeropress makes, but I was intrigued to see what happens if you don't plunge.

Recipe: 

* Coffee: 14g of [Dark Arts ""Barbarians at the gate""](https://www.darkartscoffee.co.uk/products/barbarians-at-the-gate-colombia-3), medium-fine (5 on Ode 2)
* Water: 245g at 93C
* Method (did not go fully as planned): Add the coffee, even the bed and pour water. At the beginning of pouring, gently swirl to make sure all grounds are wet. Wait and occasionally very gently (with the back end of the teaspoon) mix the top layer of the brewing coffee to stir the floating coffee grounds.

What happened and what I learned:

* I think coffee should definitely be coarser. I was scared at the beginning that if it was too coarse it would just flow right through it, but that definitely didn't happen.
* Halfway though the liquid going down (about 4 mins), it stalled. I think this was mostly due to (a) coffee being too fine and (b) adding the coffee before the water (I believe I saw something equivalent about the clever but can't remember on whose channel it was).
* I tried stirring with my teaspoon the whole thing and move the bed at the bottom, but that did almost nothing.
* Eventually, I pressed the remaining (just less than) half of the water very slowly.
* I think I would try this again, by grind coarser and add the water first and then quickly add the coffee and gently stir.

The coffee:

* The coffee was actually really good! Noticeably brighter, sweeter and less body. I would say there was a bit more clarity in flavours as well.
* Some of the funkiness/savouriness of the ""[mosto fermentation](https://coffeegreenbeans.com/blogs/forest-blog/what-is-the-mosto-process-in-coffee?srsltid=AfmBOoq4-APQFyug8yM_Dm0Ghbwvg_WEODdwkO81vr7zayirvlrcoTwE)"" was lost this way, but got to be honest, it's not something I enjoyed too much when I brewed this coffee with my V60. If anything, I the subtleness of it made it more palatable/enjoyable.

1r1wh5o,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucksbaristas/comments/1r1wh5o/advice_needed/,advice needed,"im going to try to simplify as much as possible.

in about september i got a new SM. we had heard many unpleasant things about her from the old store she was at but as a SSV i did my best to not pass judgement as i didn’t know her. the first two months pass by its okay scheduling gets messed up our big order is always not enough. but fine. okay so for a while we had three morning and three night SSVs. i’m one of the morning ones. the third morning one had just been promoted when the new SM got there. and for some reason me and the other SSV stopped getting scheduled as key holder only the new one was key holding. but a minute it was fine then it become unpleasant. like she didn’t trust us even though we had been shifts for a way longer time. and this SM never communicated with us when they’re were changes around the the store. anytime i found anything out it came from the new shift telling us the SM had told her that.

me and the other shift had talked and both felt like the  SM just didn’t like us or had something against us. we brought it up to her and she didn’t even let us explain why she was very defensive and hostile. and called the new shift her “daughter”. which made me uncomfortable. but okay. my other shift ended up getting transferred through a lot of drama and crying. because the SM was just being rude and disrespectful towards her. i miss her so much i love her. but she’s been transferred now and she’s actually quit altogether. that’s a whole other situation 😓

but fast forward the last month. continuously all the communication has been coming from my other morning shift now not from my SM.  and it’s frustrating because SM was trying to coach me on things i didn’t know because she was only telling one person. this SM also felt like she did nothing. the other shifts were placing all the orders. having interviews for prospective partners ?? having shifts make schedules. tbh idk what she does. but during the snow storm recently. my SM completely relied on the shifts to communicate with the entire store. she had the shifts facetiming and constantly sending text messages out. keeping in mind we didn’t get CAT pay. but she was having us work off the clock all those days. and idk i’ve been feeling off about it. because she’s constantly asking us to send communication to the store. the new shift was even telling the partners to not text the SM during the snow storm because she was busy. to not bother her. i had one of my baristas confused because the SM was telling her she can’t use PTO for those missed hours but then telling everyone else they could. she was nervous because she needs her hours and she was being told she cannot contact the SM.

while on this barista in particular. oh my. i’m going to be honest idk if my SM realized it or not but she picks on this barista constantly. always coaching her on things but only her when someone else does it she’s blind to it. this barista has reached out to me many times expressing this. i agree i see it.

i’m saying a lot but it’s just so much. also i’ve had other baristas tell me my SM will ask to call on their days off to talk about work. she made one of my baristas clock out to talk about her schedule ?? and the proceeds to make her wait 20 minutes so she could talk to her “daughter “.

this past weekend i normally open sunday but i didn’t this sunday. i come in at 8:30. there was like five of them there. and it seems very messy and chaotic and only bare minimum had been done. and i was like okay.. i’m not the shift i’m not worrying about it right now. fast forward around 10:30 my other shift tells me she has to leave at 11:30 instead of 12:30 bc she’ll go into OT. so i have to keyhold for that hour. fine. i go and do the food rotation and realize we are out of like most of our popular food and the other shift didn’t emergency pull anything this morning. she didn’t even bother to check if we were low on anything. she marked out multiple food items which is a big no no at our store. i told my SM because we aren’t allowed to do that. all she said was she’ll talk to the other shift. which im sure  went no where. but maybe around 1 my barista i was talking about that feels SM bullies her. tells me that, that morning around 5 it was her the other shift and two other partners. they were all joking around about wanting 7 brew ( another coffee chain ) and well apparently the shift and one of the other baristas left the store on the clock to get 7 brew took them 30 minutes then came back to sit and talk in the parking lot for idk how long. and then when i got in they took meals. my barista didn’t feel comfortable going to the SM for , for told reasons. she was didn’t want me to say anything because she was scared the shift would get mad she told on her. ( oh yeah also for the longed time this shift was rude and mean to this barista just blatantly and the SM did nothing about it ) so she was worried because she shift just started being nice to her. so idk what to do.

also this past friday it’s one of our busiest days i have 6 baristas which is rough for us. we are a very high volume store. the busiest in the district. and when SM walked in i was in the window and she asked me could i get out and be in playcaller position. and didn’t because i didn’t feel it was a good idea. she said something again and i did leave and get in playcaller. fine. but the next day she’s like we need to talk. she said she felt very disrespected that i didn’t listen to her. and that i HAVE to be in playcaller position no matter how many people i have. fine. monday comes my other shift is the key holder. she like 6 people and then SM comes in making it 7 and monday is our slowest day. shift is in DTO. SM comes in and doesn’t say anything to her about it. and she DTOs all peak 2/3 hours. SM never days a thing. shift had people CS and doing other tasks. but she wasn’t in playcaller position all peak and SM says nothing. it’s so frustrating because i was told i was disrespectful but i’m not her “ daughter “ so i can’t do what i want ?? it feels pointless to ask her because she’s so biased towards this shift.

brings me to my point. what should i do ? i feel my SM just cannot be unbiased. when it comes to this shift and it makes me uncomfortable and tbh hate working with her. this was not short at all i apologize 😓",2,1770814090.0,starbucksbaristas,1,1.0,False
