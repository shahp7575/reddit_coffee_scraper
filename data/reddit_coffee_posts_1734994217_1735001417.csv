1hl1rlb,https://www.reddit.com/r/physicianassistant/comments/1hl1rlb/new_bonus_structure_offer/,New bonus structure offer,"I am a PA in a private practice surgical specialty with a bonus restructuring opportunity interested in hearing your thoughts and/or ideas on what I should ask/clarify/negotiate  prior to accepting the new offer. 

This offer would be that I would take home 25% of my quarterly profit after my expenses are accounted for. My expenses are my base pay of $11,250 monthly plus any recertification fee, DEA license, etc. Currently, this on average comes out to ~34k per quarter. In addition, if the partnering doctors buy something for the entire practice (coffee machine, office supplies, DME) it was verbalized to me I could now be responsible for some of those costs which I was not responsible for previously. 

For comparison, my current bonus structure is also quarterly but arbitrarily reduces my revenue to 35% of what it is and then my expenses (what I listed above) are subtracted from there. I am not responsible for the company wide purchases, only my salary and recert fees.  An important note is that I have never received a bonus to date in >1 year with this current bonus structure in place. 

Looking at the two most recent quarters. I made the company a profit of 45k in Q2 and 73k in Q3 after my expenses were accounted for and did not receive any amount extra in bonus. SO regardless, I feel inclined to accept the new offer. Thoughts?",2,1735000960.0,physicianassistant,1,1.0,False
1hl1qmh,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1hl1qmh/that_felt_like_a_mistake/,That felt like a mistake,"TLDR; I attempted to reconnect with the non-GC sibling & I was reminded why I went no-contact to begin with.

I became estranged from my family after my Covert Nmother triangulated me, the black sheep nearly a decade ago. 

I didn't know what was happening at the time, but I tried so hard to avoid playing into whatever was happening & keeping my relationships separate. It didn't matter, I ended up on the out with my immediate family & have been just about the entire time since.

There was a very brief period where I talked to my parents independently of my siblings, which included the golden child. However, I was eventually given an ultimatum from my parents who told me it was too difficult to maintain a relationship with me independent of my siblings. I asked if my GC sibling got this same ultimatum & the answer was ""No."" I asked why I was the only one getting this ultimatum & I was told it was because I don't have children. I told my parents that was unfortunate, but since that was the deciding factor, I'll let them know when I have kids.

My wife and I had our first two years ago and I sent a text to my dad to let him know, there was no reply. I sent an announcement, again no reply.

Flashforward and I reconnected with some other people in my family that my Nmother estranged. I met with my uncle, who I wasn't allowed to invite to my wedding due to a spat between him & my mother regarding the GC. Reconnecting with him led me to reconnect with some other family members & learn about narcisstic trends in my family. A few other family members reached out, and it encouraged me to reach out to my non-GC sibling. 

To my excitement, she replied! We met for coffee today.

I was excited to learn what my sibling had been up to for the last decade and for her to see who I've become.

Unfortunately the reunion turned into an investigation as to why I refused to apologize to the family for my apparent and obvious blatant rejection of them. I tried to tell my side of the story to this sibling, which was something I attempted to avoid years ago at a foolish attempt to not involve this sibling in the dispute and all I heard were the same arguments my nMom provided a decade ago when I was triangulated.

I told my sibling about the ultimatum where I was told to apologize to the GC or I'd lose my parents. I refused to respond to the ultimatum because to me, families shouldn't do that to one another. The ultimatum seemed to be news, but when I discussed the details, I was told that my parents didn't mean it like that.

My sibling then proceeded to tell me that both sides were being stubborn and waiting for the other to make the first move.

When I said I text my parents regarding my first born, as I promised I would, my sibling was sure the message was never received and that the birthing announcement was a slap in the face.

My sibling asked why I don't reach out and through tears I told her that my parents literally chose to not be in my life. Having two kids I could never imagine not being in their lives, and that a less than perfect relationship is still better than no relationship. They seemed to get it, OR it pushed them to be so uncomfortable that they changed the topic to our lives over the pasr decade.

Driving home from this meeting had me discouraged and worried. I called my uncle on the way home and warned him it didn't go well. I didn't discover until the end of the call that I was worried that despite their own estrangement, I thought my Nmom would call him and attempt to sever our rekindled relationship that I have come to treasure as a way to hurt us.

While we were on the phone, I saw my Dad called for one second and then disconnect. It has been a few hours and there have been no follow ups or messages of any kind from him. I love my dad, but being the enabler he is, I am incredinly hesitant to respond in any capacity.

I received a nice message from my sibling afterwards. It said they could have a relationship if I wanted, but I can't help having this sinking feeling in my gut that this was a mistake. I'm thriving since I left this family. I finished college, I have two beautiful children and at this point in my life, the drama that defined my adolescence is gone.

If we can share and reciprocate positive energy, perhaps we can create something steady and meaningful together.

And as somebody having to be onsite at 7am this doesn’t necessarily help me. But maybe it’ll help some and if you already know this then feel free to ignore it. Yesterday I learned that summit coffee at the grove arcade opens at 7am. If you can handle ordering from the curmudgeonly before their time people behind the counter than go on down and get your coffee fix before walking around town to see what else isn’t open that early. So despite my opinion on the taste of their coffee and the fact that they regular look at people like getting a 35% tip is an insult to their survival I’ll happily send people their way cos the more coffee places we have open early the better.

When I was a kid i gave Bugs pink irises and black eyelashes (the latter is a less noticeable but its above the eye). Since i was so young i do not remember what i used to color him. It might be a marker or a highlighter. I don’t know what the black is tho (high chance its sharpie D:). Also there are brown stains all over Bugs. I believe those might be Coca Cola/beer/coffee stains (also old and dried). The small Bugs Bunny also has those old stains.

I really don’t know how to clean that felt-y material that makes up Bugs eyes :(. I’m scared to touch them, because they’re already pretty old beat up plushies and i don’t wanna risk damaging them. Obviously, I can’t throw him in the washer, hes giant (and solid, hes not soft on the inside). I included the material stickers, I don’t know if it useful or not.

1hl1nex,https://www.reddit.com/r/LowellMA/comments/1hl1nex/shoutout_to_lowells_breakfast_sandwich_offerings/,Shoutout to Lowell’s breakfast sandwich offerings,"After transplanting here about 9 years ago I quickly became fascinated with the lore of the North Shore Roast Beef sandwich and while Lowell is accredited as adjacent at best, we do sling some amazing beef’s (looking at you Rizzo’s).

It recently occurred to me that I can’t get a bad breakfast sandwich in Lowell (so long as I steer clear of the national chains). It made me want to cast a spotlight on the great places we have right outside our doors. Without further ado I give you my top breakfast sandwiches of Lowell. 

#5. Heav’nly Donuts- The BARNYARD (on an everything bagel): the only reason why this isn’t higher on my list is that it would be considered “Greater Lowell” but it’s in spitting distance over the line in Methuen so I count it as ours. Really great sandwich featuring bacon, ham, and sausage with egg and cheese.

#4. Nibbāna- Forbidden (on an everything bagel): I love Nibbāna’s coffee but had no idea they had breakfast sandwiches until recently. It’s a pretty straightforward sandwich, leaving the ham off but featuring sausage and back with egg and cheese. I feel that it’s the cleanest sandwich on the list, not leaving you in a food coma for the rest of your morning.

#3. Arthur’s Paradise Diner- Triple Boott Mill: this sandwich coming in at number 3 on the list will probably be controversial to those in the know. Unquestionably it is the most unique on the list and I’d definitely put it as the most Lowell sandwich, the kind you hear tales of students cutting class to devour one. It has all the standard accoutrements with ham, bacon, and sausage with egg and cheese but the main differences from the rest of the sandwiches on this list is that Arthur’s adds home fries and puts it all on a toasted bulky roll. For me the sandwich is excellent but being picky about it the home fries are mostly like boiled potatoes where I’d prefer a little more crust and the bulky roll is a lot of bread. The combo of the 2 starches I feel mellows the flavor profile a bit. I have however found that adding a splash of James River BBQ sauce at home or hot sauce gives it the acid to take this sandwich over the top. Do not let the fact that this isn’t my number 1 choice steer you in any direction away from Arthur’s, you gotta have one.

#2. Top Donut- Meat Combo on a Croissant: same structure of 3 meats with egg and cheese as most of these sandwiches but I change it up at this spot with a croissant. The reason being is this sandwich is by far the greasiest on the list and the buttery croissant enhances that while doing a decent job at absorbing the grease. I will rarely opt for this sandwich simply because it’s a lot on a delicate morning stomach but it’s so damn good and the best cure for a hangover that I’ve found.

#1. Little Delights- The Lumber Jack: this sandwich does nothing to break the mold of 3 meats with egg and cheese but it does it so eloquently. In my opinion it’s the most complete sandwich on the list, surprisingly not greasy. But for me what really puts it over the top is the plain bagel that everything comes on. They are perfection, pillowy, great flavor, and barely the slightest hint of toasted but definitely warm. I could eat one everyday no problem, this is not a sandwich to sleep on!

Please note sit down spots are a blind spot for me since I generally order more traditional breakfast plates. I also have been told Brew’d Awakening serves an excellent breakfast sandwich but I always get the Abraham (lox, cream cheese, capers, onion and tomato on an everything bagel) because I can’t get a sandwich like that really anywhere else in Lowell. 

I am certain that I missed plenty of options out there so I’d love to hear any suggestions in the comments below!",10,1735000580.0,LowellMA,3,1.0,False

We exchanged smiles and small talk, but what struck me most wasn’t his looks it was the timing. He had just returned from a long trip, and I had just gotten out of a relationship. We both felt like we were standing at a crossroads, uncertain of what we wanted but open to seeing where the path might lead.

Our first date was effortless, like we had known each other for years. We laughed about everything and nothing, our conversations flowing like we had been waiting for this moment all along. It felt like life had brought us together at just the right time.

We didn’t rush into anything. We took our time, letting things unfold naturally, and in doing so, we discovered something neither of us expected connection. Deep, genuine connection. It was like every piece of our lives had been preparing us for this moment, for this person, for *this* timing.

We live in an apartment that i own. I have a full time job and I’m earning more than him. He works from home and earns also well but I’m slightly above him with my salary. We are sharing equally our finances like a husband and wife should. 

Well i am also a collector. I spend plenty of time going to flea markets at 5am 4 times a week. I collect, i restore and i also sell. eBay is my side hustle. Not only i enjoy collecting but im also earning some side money from there. I restore most of the “junk” and try to make a profit to grow my collection. 

My husband knew all of this because we dated for 7 years prior. I was very upfront and i told him that the money i make from my collection and from my flea market are the money I’m gonna invest into my collection and i wont be putting that into our household bills. It was fine. Till we got married. 

Then he started getting mad and angry whenever i buy something for my collection. He’s constantly checking whether i sold something on eBay and ask whats my statement on my eBay’s account. I have a separate debit card that i use for and from my eBay sales only and I’m not taking any money out from our monthly salaries. 

December was my busiest month so far with all the holidays and thankfully i was able to afford a piece for my collection that cost around 1300$ so i went for it. The thing is he still doesn’t know about it. Because i fear that he’d get mad. I know it’s my money and i know i have a right to spend on whatever i want but i still feel threatened and judged because of his upcoming reaction. 

Last month i was eyeing another piece i was missing to add to my collection and my mom offered to get it for me for Christmas, so she paid for the item, and my husband was very angry finding that out because he thought i could forward those money on getting us something else instead. Like a new coffee table or some kitchen utensils. 

We have no debts, its my apartment under my name that i got, he put his fair share into it by helping out renovating and everything, i cant complain, but it was 90% me. I put my whole salary into the bills and the groceries and whatever furniture we need, so i feel its not fair him controlling my side hustle. 

Recently whenever he hears the eBay notification that i have sold something is getting mad that i am making money, and is constantly putting up jokes saying “there it comes money from doing nothing.” Which is pretty annoying because i put tons of effort into my collection. I have started to turn off the notifications so he wont get jealous or cocky. Once in an argument he said that me earning more and doing eBay side hustle is gonna make him seem weak and it’s gonna make me more dominant. And the thing that hurt me the most was one night him jokingly saying “well i hope you don’t sell anything so you wouldn’t be spending those money on stupid things again…” ",3,1734999903.0,AmItheAsshole,14,1.0,False

The marketing photos on Sephora and Ulta’s websites painted a dreamscape—the perfume bottle laid in pink satin, fluffy marshmallows, delicate vanilla bean strands, glittery flowers, and coffee beans sprinkled throughout. I was super excited about the December 18th release.

But then, reality struck.

The moment I spritzed the YSL perfume on my wrist, my expectations took a nosedive. Instead of a sweet, gourmand scent, I got an unexpected citrus slap in the face. On **Fragrantica**, the main accord was listed as ""sweet,"" so I was ready for something cozy and sugary. But I hadn’t paid close enough attention to the **second main accord: citrus**. The top notes—**Green Mandarin, Pear, and Lemon**—were a far cry from the marshmallowy vibe I had envisioned. It was more like coffee beans on vacation in a citrus grove. I didn't even detect marshmallow. And while that may appeal to some, it wasn’t my vibe.

Disappointed but determined, I wandered over to the Kayali display. I remembered seeing a promo about their new marshmallow fragrance, **Kayali Yum | 81 Boujee Marshmallow**, and figured, why not? My expectations were low, but the moment I tested it, I knew I had to buy it.

This was everything I’d hoped the YSL perfume would be and more. It was exactly how it was described, boujee, sweet, and playful—like biting into a juicy strawberry marshmallow puff, with all the coziness of vanilla and a delicate fruity brightness to balance out the gourmand.

Later, I looked it up on **Fragrantica** and discovered why it felt so familiar. The **Kayali Yum | 81** shares some DNA with one of my longtime loves, **Glossier You** (the original formulation). For starters, the top note of Freesia in Kayali Yum echoes the Iris in Glossier You. Then there’s the **ambroxan** in the base, another key player in Glossier You. 

But what really sets Kayali Yum apart is its **strawberry note**, which feels brighter and juicier than anything I’ve encountered before. In my humble opinion, it even outshines Pflur’s **Strawberry Letter** in its execution.

All in all, Kayali Yum | 81 delivered on every marshmallow-laced fantasy the YSL perfume couldn’t. It’s like the scent equivalent of a warm hug—and now, it’s taken the main spot on my fragrance shelf. Again, this is just my opinion, please do not hate me :) thanks!",1,1734999791.0,fragrance,0,1.0,False

1hl1cfy,https://www.reddit.com/r/narcissisticparents/comments/1hl1cfy/does_it_get_better/,Does it get better??,"I’m a middle child in a household, and I’m currently accepted to colleges as an early graduate of HS, so I’m just waiting until this semester is over and I can leave. (Dw DMs are off so no creeps.) I have a substantial academic record so I think I will make it far in my education. Education and college truly is my way out as I am 16. My question is if life gets better. Everyone in my house, esp my mother, the abuser, tells me that life only gets worse. For context, she’s an alcoholic, burdened by generational trauma, encourages me to restrict, body shames me, verbally abuses me, physically abuses my little sister, and absolutely is delusional around me. She thinks I am this evil entity that hates her and wants to see her suffer. Apparently. 

There are so many instances I can name to describe her narcissism, but one that’s ingrained in me is when I was in 6th grade, 10 years old, and my mother was mad that I didn’t wake up my little sister after she was late because she didn’t set her alarm. At that age, I truly believe I was unable to be hateful or evil or anything. Right in front of the school in the morning, as I was opening the door, she backed up the car seat to where my legs were stuck between my car seat and hers, and I was trapped in the car. She locked the door. She started asking me what I thought I did wrong and I was so confused, asking her what she meant as I didn’t have a clue. I think she didn’t either. She said she would wait, then since I didn’t start crying, she started listing off scenarios of her dying, and when I didn’t cry at that, she told me to imagine being an orphan and both of my sisters being dead. When I cried, she brought her seat up and let me go. I walked into school crying, and I was so used to it by that time that I told my friends I was crying from laughter at a joke. 

She always waits until I cry to end an argument, even 6 years later. No apologies or whatever. And it’s the same. She really tries to keep me under her control but I don’t fall for it the way my sisters do, and that leads my entire family to be against me. My sister is an adult now, in college, and still asks for my mother’s permission to hang out with her boyfriend or buy something. It is a truly codependent dynamic and I watch in horror as my sisters ridicule me for being such a rebellious child when in reality I don’t want to box up this abuse and internalize it. That’s why I’m shooting for a psych degree, I want to understand my trauma and help other people understand it. 

Sorry for the rant, I’m just trying to help people get a feel of what I’m talking about. I’ve seen what life is. My family comes from a long line of sexual and domestic violence, on both sides. My father was an abuser to my mother. He has died. We now sit in a small suburban town, living a creepy dystopian life of my mother taking pictures of us smiling, when we literally do nothing but take pictures at a place, and then leaving to hear my mother scream and rage while drunk. I’ve been catcalled by men at 11, groped at school and the teacher who did it still works there. I understand how horrible everything is and yet being a functioning person out in this scary world seems like a better fate than being cooped up in my room, only communicating with my mother when she wants me to clean her messes, literally. I feel like Cinderella, but Prince Charming is affordable college and my sisters aren’t completely evil. But everything else is the same, lol. 

The worst part of my family is that now I’m worried I’m completely broken. My mom puts me on anti depressants, adhd medicine, anything she thinks will change my coldness. I feel like such a bad person because she tells me that I am making myself hate my family, and that I am making a victim of myself. And she might be right to an extent. Sometimes my family is completely normal, just watching a show and laughing. It seems the moment I am around my mother makes some cruel remark on how hateful and lazy I am. I stay in my room. Do my homework. I’m not allowed to volunteer, go to clubs, or hang out with friends anymore. She threatened to call the police when my friend started driving me to Secret Santa. (She gave me permission the previous day. This was today and I had to go back home.) 

But now I just wonder if I’m living in the past and I’ll be this mess of a human being when I leave this house, incapable and as unaware as she tells me I am. I’m suicidal, and I’m trying to hold it together but when the one person who loved you dies (my dad, ik he abused my mom but he never did to me) you feel so unloved that you stop looking as you cross the street. I have no one and nothing. My brother lives far away but he’s always busy and I can’t contact him often. But this can’t be it. It has to get better. I don’t want to revisit this dynamic of me and my mother in relationships in the future. God, I want this war to be over. I just want peace. I want to sip a coffee in a quiet country and never have to hear someone claim they know me better than I know myself, and that who I am is lazy and dramatic and a victimizer. I can’t stay in this environment forever. I hope there is hope. 

Sorry for the long rant. To anyone reading, I just needed a space where I probably was listened to. ",1,1734999632.0,narcissisticparents,0,1.0,False

Yesterday I received three letters, and two parcels.

One letter was from Wilfred.

One letter was from Mortimer.

One letter was from Gustav.

Both parcels from the Exchange. The first contained the supplies I had ordered. The second surprised me and contained an account number, a routing number, a driver’s license, a debit card, a credit card, an invoice, and two more jobs.

I accepted both jobs by wire and further requested part of payment be applied to cover the balance of the invoice and remainder be deposited into the new bank account.

I broke my fast. Black Coffee, three cigarettes, pastrami sandwich, dill pickle, side of fries.

I then returned to my room, read through my correspondence, and then finally began the task of working through the stack of time yellowed paperbacks that now sat behind the clock on the small bedside table.

I smoked and I sipped gin as I read. By the time I grew hungry for dinner I had completed the first book. It was good. Sometimes I feel like Isherwood. Sometimes I envy men like Isherwood. I have no idea how it will help me return to the Dark Forest.

The nighttime bartender was not working tonight. The was a different bartender. She is the other bartender. She is much better than the daytime bartender. Blue eyes, blonde hair, small. Her eyes look as if they have never truly seen anything worth seeing. She certainly can’t see me. She thinks my name is Samuel. It is not.

Dinner was several strong beers, fish and chips, extra vinegar. In the morning, I would consider Wilfred’s letter. That night I would eat and drink deeply.

After that, he proposed to meet each other before my flight(traveling hometown for the holidays), but I was hurt/anxious and delayed my message. We tried to talk over the phone, but he was available until midnight and I was sleeping by then.

 I have to say that before leaving (and the ghosting),  I left with my building admin a gift to send to him. I lost a bet, so I was paying it with that gift. But they ended up sending the gift yesterday —after 2 weeks of him ghosting me. 

And well, I woke up today with this message on my phone.

I... have no idea what to say... I was trying to move on since he didn't respond to any of my follow up messages. I really liked him, and was trying to understand his situation and how busy he was, so it did hurt me a lot when he ghosted me without a clear explanation. Even more when we talked about it in our last date, he even made me promise to never ghost him, block him or ignore him.  But, now...

The rain has returned.

Yesterday, I awoke early.

More black coffee. Three cigarettes. No breakfast.

Then I went to acquire items from Gustav’s list. I had to go to three different used bookshops to get all the written works. I also purchased my first computer today. It’s a laptop. When I returned, I realized it didn’t have a drive to play movies. The salesmen said it was top of the line and would run all the programs on the list which he helped me identify. He said I would need to purchase them online. He gave me a website address. I guess I’ll have to purchase the films online too. I don’t have a credit card. I don’t have a bank account. I’ll have to purchase one on the Exchange. I picked up a small desk today too. I still need a chair.

By the time I returned with my purchases and dropped them off, it was evening. I had finally gotten hungry enough to eat. Steak, eggs, baked potato with several gin and tonics. Plenty of cigarettes.

I decided to send a wire to the Exchange regarding a burner credit card. It will be a few days before it arrives.

Asked how long it would be possible to extend my stay for. Nightime bartender said that Wilfred had been by and had paid for me to stay for two more months. To my knowledge, he does not know the name I checked into the Inn under. To my knowledge, none of the Bookkeepers know my name, assumed or otherwise. Regardless, nighttime bartender seemed happy about the extension.

I imagine she can’t see me even with those intelligent eyes.

It is for the better.

Those who see rarely have what it takes to continue to look.

I imagine, with all these fools’ errands and purchases, that I must be beginning to lose sight of myself as well.

She told me she would be closing the bar at two.

I told her I was in room thirteen.

She arrived at half past the hour.

She departed in the morning.

1hl190t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Maplestory/comments/1hl190t/lets_talk_about_phantom/,Let's talk about Phantom,"Mastery 3/4 has dropped in KMS and has left a lot of the class discord hiding like Saddam Hussein and because of how downbad the phantom discord truly is, the lord guided me to make a post about probably one of the most copium inducing classes in GMS. Let me start this off by saying:

  
**ALL people in this game have a fundamental UNDERSTANDING of how Phantom is.** Public sentiment of this class has always been ""51/50"" or ""iframe out of green dotting"" but this is a gross understatement of this job's capability. Let's get this straight right now. Phantom is literally griefing your party in GMS. There's a reason phantoms go on the Twins stream for based Phantom takes. There's a reason why Phantom needs a minus 14 hat to solo xlot on release, ahead of EVERY class in being the best cheerleader in the GAME (obviously solo cheerleading capability isn't the only metric for the potential of a class, but it's like 99% of it). Why is Phantom always labeled as the worst class in the game? Why are you spewing facts? This class had a brief stint where it was overpowered on release, followed by DELETING the class and replacing it with this old man where the class only relies SUPERB tactics like FROZEN ORB bugs or STEALING YOUR 6TH PARTY MEMBERS SLOT. Phantom as a class has remained as one of the 50 classes in the game. They're a class in the game. Any slight buffs was a KMS dev accidentally spilling coffee and allowing Phantoms to steal benediction or something, well you know what? WE'RE OUTRAGED!

  
**Buffing PENOMBRE will fix Phantom. Buffing BLAISON will fix Phantom. Buffing RAPIER WIT will fix Phantom. BUFFING CARTE NOIR WILL ONLY GIVE US DAMAGE.** The following will attempt to demonstrate why this class is fundamentally FUNCTIONALl and desperately needs ANOTHER 6TH MASTERY. Other jobs (specifically pathfinders!) have no right to complain. We are the goats of the bottom. We have every right to spew out ""my class is done wallahi!"" because of the BLOOD SWEAT AND TEARS we go through opening up and reading ""job change already, nkalos legion champion mule easy boss!"" As if we're soloing nkalos anytime soon without at least 3 more final cuts, combo orbs and infinity back. But no more of that, let's make it a bulleted list of complaints.

**How do Phantoms continue to exist(what is existence)?**

I don't know how we exist. Phantom is... a class... and we uhh.. do something alright. None of this complicated different systems like we're Kalos or something. The majority of our damage is just us stealing from other classes, final cut... cross surge... I mean you guys got any more FD buffs we can steal? I'd consider us a strong contender for a 30 minute class if we could get -3 per line hats! Something something, press ace, rift, tempest (pray to heavens you just keep getting cd skips), repeat until our ""burst"" damage comparable to like.. 1/5th? of Irkallas Wraths damage. Hey, but we can boost mercedes damage by 10%, so we definitely have a better usage! We exist because we have copium at HEART!

**Do we ever get to eat?**

No. If there is a dart board that has every class in the game and if it's hit it gets buffed, our class is not even in the same dimensional plane as that dart board. You will starve and accept your little HEXA Carte Rose Finale, Carte Noir IV that expected to give us about 20-30%FD gave us not much and the greatest skill, Lmao Carte which we don't know if it's still bugged or not. If you remember that one gif of Mickey cutting the slice of bread, yeah we get less than that. Shout out to Wild Hunter and Blaze Wizard homies, we are truly that gif.

To summarize, this is a satirical post about the Pathfinder to cope with Nexon ever giving love to classes not named Night Walker or Mercedes. And even then, who knows, maybe then they'll create a ""Let's talk about Night Walker"" list. We feel for ya Pathfinders. I pray on the KMS summer patch ""AFTER"" or something that it'll finally be us hitting the illustrious pitch that is so hard to get, Nexon Love.

A big thankyou to @KenduMiazaki for creating the opportunity that is Kendu and creating it in a way that it provides all of us a chance of getting our faces melted next year.

Something here has been created that can be likened to a perfect storm. A community that found itself being built from the ground up, but one that can not be recreated elsewhere.

That then leads to a massive thank you to the community, especially those that are here every day running it up, knowing that thats the secret sauce to success.

We have known our goals and the kendu ethos “We do not gamble, we work” and have perpetuated this by instilling the values in to new community members, creating an infinitely scalable brand.

We have found ourselves with things such as the energy drinks, murals, coffee, billboards, tattoos, stickers and people even jumping out of planes. Thats the community who has done that. You.

We all play a role here in Kendu. We are all equally important within the story of running it up in the billions. We all know what it takes and that means hard hard work.

Kendu genuinely is the best bet there is in DeFi for 2025 - our community is simply unmatched in our methods. No TG is as alive as we are, no one does IRL like us, no one achieves the engagement we do - and thats entirely organically.

It is now our job to push even harder leading in to 2025, knowing that we are on the verge of the greatest alt season ever seen. Ethereum begins flying in Jan historically, ETHBTC begins climbing in Jan aswell.

It is important to enter 2025 with a new found hunger, knowing that all the work we put in will pay back in dividends by 1000x.

The Kendu name will be known globally, and it is up to you to determine how quickly that happens. 

There is no other Kendu and there never will be. People like @Ox_Josh @kojak797 and @KevinFinnerty00 and everyone else who has been crucial in the story, who been here since day dot running it up and bringing in new community members. There is everyone that isnt mentioned as well that is just as crucial in this story. The story of creating a decentralised perpetual organism. 

We all have unique skills and networks that we can all utilise to bring something special to Kendu.

May you all have a lovely Christmas and new years, spend time with your loved ones and enjoy the time. I hope the holidays are filled with Joy for all of you.

May we all find ourselves in drastically different positions come 2025, as this will be the year of Kendu.",10,1734999312.0,KenduInu_Ecosystem,2,1.0,False

So TLDR; MY bf's mother whom we live with broke my favorite coffee mug less than a month ago, but never told me, and when I realized it was missing, she said and quote ""it was so long ago I don't even remember when it happened. It had a chip in it so I threw it out."" 

Long Story-

I [27F] live with my bf [29M] and his mother [60'sF]. Today I had an amazing day and I had my favorite movie queued up on the tv after setting up my laptop and a new disc drive. I went to get some cookies and milk and searched the cabinets for my favorite mug. For some background- I wash all of my own cups by hand. One time, my MiL put a cup of mine (that she had gifted me, coincidentally) in the dishwasher. This nearly ruined its beautiful design, which had been printed on pretty cheaply, apparently. But it didn't matter if it was cheap, to me it was special. I did try using it again and washing it by hand, but more of the design came off, so I retired that particular mug and it's only for show now.

The mug that this post is about, likewise, was pretty cheap. I got it for $5 at Walmart during halloween time, and it was maybe nothing special to others, but to me it was unique. It had a relief/embossed design of two skulls from profile facing each other. It was otherwise plain, matte white finish, with a squarish handle. It was nice and wide, like a mug you could hold in two hands and be extra cozy.

I had an incredible day up until this point; I woke up, got to see two of my favorite clients at work (I am a nail technician), and even received a Christmas present from one of them! I got home in a great mood, and was planning to make a big breakfast-for-dinner later this evening. I should be cooking right now instead of typing this but I'm so angry I can't think about anything else. 

Anyway, I'm getting some peppermint oreos 'joe joes' from Trader Joe's, and I go to get my mug to use for milk to go with my cookies. Lo and behold, my favorite cup is missing, so I ask my MiL, who is getting ready to go drive around and look at XMas lights with her husband, where it is, or if she has seen it at all. She repkies rather innocently with ""Oh that one? It broke ages ago and I threw it out."" Well this is the first I'm hearing of this, so I ask her when and how it happened. She responds, in a rather annoyed tone, ""It had a big chip in it, [my name], I don't remember. I threw it out. I didn't know you had a 'cup thing.' Oh, wait, I did, because when I put that other cup in the dishwasher you were so upset about it."" So you admit that you knew this could be upsetting to me, yet you didn't think to tell me when it happened?? It's not a 'cup thing,' it's a 'respecting the belongings of other people' thing. Most likely, this cup was also damaged in the dishwasher, because she couldn't let me wash it by hand or be bothered to herself. (I would have done it, she doesn't have to wash my cups and I do not ask her to.)

At this point I'm frustrated with her because it couldn't have been 'ages ago' if I have a picture of it in my phone from mid-November. And I use it a lot more often than I take pictures of it, so it's not like I haven't used it in a month. I ask again, when did it happen? She says, this time trying to hurry out the door and sounding extra annoyed, ""I dont know, [my name], it was a long time ago, okay!"" She left with her husband and I am left to stew about this incident with zero answers or apologies.

For some extra context, my MiL has two identical mugs that she is obsessed with. She loves these mugs. If someone uses one of them, she always comments on it. I bet if it was one of her TWO identical mugs, she would be reacting stronger than I am about my UNIQUE mug. Before you ask, yes, I tried google image searching and all that to find the mug and see if it can be replaced. It cannot be replaced. I cannot find it anywhere. Reverse Image Search turns up a single blog post about someone finding these beautiful mugs at Walmart, and literally not a SINGLE other post or image or listing of the same mug mor ANYTHING similar. Only cheesy, halloweeny, cartoony skull mugs. 

If she'd told me WHEN it happened, I'd have been upset for a while and yes, saddened that I couldn't replace it, but she waited ages to tell me, not even telling me on her own but waiting until I was looking for it specifically.

Contributing factors to my anger include-
A- it did not belong to her
B- she did not tell me when it broke nor that it broke until I was looking for it
C- it cannot be replaced
D- it was the only one of its kind in the cabinet
E- if the roles were reversed, she would have another of her fave mug unbroken and still would have been pissed off
F- when I tried asking about it,she acted as if I were the one who was pissing her off
G- from her description of the chip, it could have been repaired pretty easily
H- even if I could never drink from the mug again, like my other retired mug, I would have kept it for sentimental purpose.
I- I was, until this incident, in a great mood from a great day

I didn't get the chance to see the damage to assess or possibly repair it. She either chose not to tell me or didn't bother because it didn't even register to her. It cannot be replaced.

Reasons I may be overreacting- It's a $5 cup, not some $30-40 Cracker Barrel/White Elm/Pottery Barn bougie cup. It's not handmade, and nobody gifted it to me. They might (MIGHT) release it again next Halloween.",0,1734999130.0,AmIOverreacting,1,0.5,False

----------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to maintaining a dazzling smile, many people often wonder, ""Can false teeth be whitened?"" This question is especially pertinent for those who wear dentures or have dental implants. Understanding what options are available can help you make a more informed decision about your oral health and appearance.

False teeth generally don't respond to whitening treatments like natural teeth do. Most whitening products are designed specifically for teeth made of enamel, while false teeth may be made from materials such as acrylic, porcelain, or resin. As a result, those materials typically do not react to whitening agents in the same way.

### Alternative Solutions for Brightening False Teeth

While traditional whitening methods might not be effective for false teeth, there are several alternatives that can help keep them looking fresh and bright:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Regular Cleaning:** Keeping your dentures or false teeth clean is essential. Use a soft-bristled brush and specialized denture cleaner to remove stains and food particles. Regular cleaning helps maintain their appearance and prevents discoloration.
- **Soaking Solutions:** Consider using soaking solutions designed for dentures. These can help remove stains and bacteria. Be sure to follow the instructions provided for the best results.
- **Consult Your Dentist:** Your dentist may offer services such as polishing or specialized cleaning techniques that can restore the shine to your false teeth.
- **Stay Away from Staining Foods:** Just as with natural teeth, certain foods and drinks can stain false teeth. Avoid beverages like coffee, tea, and red wine, as well as foods like berries and tomato sauce. Rinsing your mouth with water after consuming these items can help.

### Choosing the Right Materials

If you're looking to enhance your smile with false teeth, the material you choose can impact their appearance. Here’s a breakdown of common materials:

- **Acrylic:** This is a common material used in dentures. While they can be made to look natural, they can also stain over time.
- **Porcelain:** Porcelain false teeth tend to look more natural and resist staining better than acrylic. However, they can be more fragile and may require more maintenance.
- **Composite Resin:** This material offers a natural appearance and is less prone to staining, but like porcelain, it may require careful handling.

### Whitening Products to Avoid

If you’re thinking about whitening options, it’s crucial to know what not to use. Products designed for natural teeth often contain bleach or other harsh chemicals that can damage your false teeth. Here are some items to steer clear of:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Over-the-Counter Whitening Kits:** These typically include strong whitening ingredients that can be detrimental to false teeth.
- **Whitening Toothpastes:** Most whitening toothpastes contain abrasives or chemicals that aren't suitable for materials like acrylic or porcelain.

### Maintaining Your Smile with Confidence

Living with false teeth can sometimes cause concern over their appearance, but with proper care, you can maintain a bright smile. Here are some tips to keep in mind:

1. **Daily Care:** Brush your false teeth daily with a denture brush and cleaner.
2. **Regular Check-Ups:** Schedule regular visits to your dentist to assess the condition of your false teeth.
3. **Proper Storage:** When not in use, store your false teeth in a safe place, ideally in water or a soaking solution to prevent warping.

While false teeth may not be whitened in the traditional sense, there are effective ways to maintain their appearance and health. By adopting regular cleaning rituals, seeking professional advice, and being mindful of your diet, you can enjoy a beautiful, confident smile for years to come.

The Impact of Diet on the Appearance and Longevity of False Teeth
-----------------------------------------------------------------

For many individuals, false teeth, or dentures, become a vital part of daily life. These dental devices can significantly impact self-esteem and overall quality of life. However, just like natural teeth, the appearance and longevity of false teeth can be affected by various factors, with diet being one of the most crucial aspects to consider.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
Your diet not only affects your overall health but also plays a significant role in how false teeth look and last over time. When you wear dentures, it’s essential to choose foods that are gentle on the materials used to create them. Here’s how different dietary choices can impact your false teeth:

### Foods that May Cause Staining

- **Teas and Coffees:** Dark beverages like tea and coffee can stain dentures over time. If you enjoy these drinks, consider rinsing your mouth or cleaning your dentures afterward.
- **Red Wine:** This beverage is notorious for leaving stains on both natural and false teeth. Moderation is key if you want to maintain their bright appearance.
- **Berries:** Fruits like blueberries and blackberries, while healthy, can also contribute to staining if consumed excessively. Balance them with other foods.

### Foods That Are Safe for False Teeth

- **Soft Fruits:** Bananas, applesauce, and ripe peach slices are not only gentle on false teeth but also provide essential nutrients.
- **Vegetables:** Steamed or cooked vegetables like carrots and zucchini are a great source of vitamins and are typically denture-friendly.
- **Dairy Products:** Yogurt and soft cheeses can be beneficial due to their calcium content and are generally safe for dentures.

In addition to the choice of foods, it’s crucial to consider the texture and consistency of what you eat. Hard and crunchy foods can damage dentures, leading to cracks and poor fits, which can affect both appearance and comfort. Opt for softer, easier-to-chew foods to ensure durability.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### The Role of Hydration

Staying well-hydrated is equally essential for maintaining the appearance of false teeth. Dehydration can lead to dry mouth, which may affect the fit and comfort of dentures. Saliva plays a protective role, helping to wash away food particles and reduce the risk of bad breath. Therefore, drinking plenty of water can keep your mouth moist and your dentures looking clean.

### How Sugar Affects Your False Teeth

Although false teeth do not decay like natural teeth, dietary sugar can affect the gums and the supporting structures of your mouth. Consuming too many sugary foods can increase the risk of gum disease, which may lead to discomfort and issues with your dentures. It’s wise to limit sugar intake and encourage healthier snack choices.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Routine Maintenance to Enhance Longevity

Aside from diet, it's essential to maintain a regular cleaning routine for your false teeth. Brushing your dentures daily with a soft brush helps remove food particles and stains. Additionally, soaking them in a specialized cleansing solution can keep them fresh and prevent buildup.

Be sure to visit your dentist regularly too. They can assess how well your diet may be affecting the fit and appearance of your dentures. Adjustments may be required as your mouth changes over time.

### Final Thoughts

Your dietary choices play a crucial role in maintaining both the appearance and longevity of false teeth. By being mindful of what you consume and following a routine care regimen, you can enjoy a bright, lasting smile. Embrace a balanced diet filled with soft, nutrient-rich foods, and remember that good hydration and regular dental check-ups can also keep your dentures in great shape.

These strategies into your daily routine will not only enhance your oral health but will also allow you to enjoy the full benefits of your false teeth for years to come. Remember, a little extra care goes a long way!

### Conclusion

Finding a solution to enhance the brightness of false teeth can be a bit challenging, but it’s important to remember that it is possible to explore several options. While traditional whitening methods like those used for natural teeth aren’t effective for dentures or false teeth, specialized products are designed to clean and maintain their appearance. For instance, soaking your false teeth in denture cleaning solutions or using specific cleaning pastes can help keep them looking fresh and bright.

Additionally, your diet plays a crucial role in maintaining the condition of your false teeth. Certain foods and beverages can cause staining over time, so it’s wise to limit your intake of items like coffee, red wine, and dark-colored fruits. Instead, focus on a balanced diet that includes crunchy fruits and vegetables, which can help keep your mouth—and your false teeth—healthy.

Practicing good oral hygiene is essential, too. Regular cleaning and care of your false teeth will not only enhance their appearance but also extend their lifespan. Following your dentist's recommendations regarding cleaning routines and re-evaluation appointments can help you maintain both the health of your gums and the integrity of your false teeth.

I go to a Japanese course on weekends and asked her if she wanted to come by for a coffee after my course and she said she had another appointment. But I know that is just subtle rejection.

Sometimes girls do agree to hang out with me only to reject me after a while, and sometimes I'm flat out rejected like this.

I never want to speak to her again. I just went to work today and immersed myself in work while listening to music. From now on I really see no point in having meaningless conversations with people at work just to pass time if they don't have any time for me outside work. I don't want superficial relationships I want friends to hang out with or a romantic partner to take to a Christmas market, have vacations with, go to a movie, be silly together.

I hate my job because I can't find anyone who would like to spend time with me there. I hate going to a bar or coffee house alone, watching everyone laugh and speak together. But I'm not worthy of any of it. Also in this Japanese course in which as I elaborated way back in another post, this girl first hung out with me, went to a movie together, then rejected me (first said she said she wanted to get to know me better because I treated her so kindly) and now we just ignore each other, I just go there for the sake of enjoying the lessons and all.

No one thinks I'm worthy of this. I'm FA at 29 and even though all these attempts to get out, no one has ever allowed me to. Because no one, but no one thinks I'm worthy of any of these. I basically have no value. I can't stand my own friends having partners. All that gives me is pure resentment. I'll just start alienating myself from everyone because I'm fed up with being exposed to all that. It's always them and not me. I walk out in the street, see all these guys girls holding hands with, a lot of them are way uglier, shorter yet still have what I have been dying to have. I can accept that I'm not the best looking guy but I don't think I'm uglier than everyone else in relationships. I fail to understand how they can find their soulmates so easily. I can see people getting cheated on a lot but I'm fine with that as long as I experience a relationship for a while at least to show me that I'm of some value. ",2,1734997752.0,lonely,5,1.0,False

I say that as someone who lived in NYC for 4 years - I went out a good amount and definitely enjoyed the restaurant scene, but apart from some shows/museums/events, everything I did there on a regular basis really could have been done in most places, probably just with a lesser quality or energy level, albeit for less money too.

When I think about that as it applies to moving, I'm wondering if I am just a unique case or if other people are similar to this at all? For those of you who moved somewhere specifically for its standout features, how often do you genuinely take advantage of them? Do you regularly explore your city’s unique offerings, or does day-to-day life end up taking precedence most of the time?",11,1734996884.0,SameGrassButGreener,38,0.92,False

So long story short, my GF (now ex) left me because of the following reason :

So, three days ago I had a bit of a conflict with my girlfriend. It wasn't anything serious; she wanted to go out, but I didn’t feel like it. I was in a bit of a depression because I lost my job and had issues with za. Sometimes I was short on cash, needing a little more to buy some for myself. I would go to this guy who sold it, and I would wait with her until he brought it. Then we would drive to the same place, and sometimes we would go back to my place or hang out somewhere else.

Basically, I was selfish, and I admit that. I don’t want to drag her down; I had problems with myself because I didn’t have money to buy that stuff. She had just come back from work, and I asked her if she’d like to go out. She said no because she was tired and had a very important issue—her period was late. She has some problems with that; it’s not because she’s pregnant, but she has hormonal issues. I understand that.

When she texted that she didn’t want to go anywhere, especially not to buy that and then go back home, I got a bit angry (because I’m a foolish addict and was only thinking about that, of course, since my brain was fried from the stupid za). She said she could come over to watch something, and I told her she didn’t have to, thank you. The next day, she asked if we wanted to go out for coffee, and I said no, etc.

1hl0elu,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1hl0elu/my_last_night_dream/,My Last Night Dream,"Let me tell you about the dream I had last night.

The dream started in 1999, at the prestigious Harvard University, there was a Russian scientist so brilliant, his colleagues were probably low-key envious of him.

Petrovich, was the kind of genius whose brainpower could make you feel both inspired and slightly insecure.

But behind that brilliance was a story.

Tragedy knocked on Petrovich’s door at just nine years old.

His mother died of cancer. Now, most kids would probably cry, maybe eat some cookies to console themselves, and move on.

But not Petrovich. He sat in a corner after her burial, deep in thought, looking like a philosopher who had just cracked the meaning of life. Then, with the seriousness of a teacher giving final exam instructions, he said, “One day, I will cure cancer.”

And Petrovich meant it. From that day, he hit the books with the determination of a hungry lion. Nothing could distract him. Well, almost nothing.

At the of age 17, life delivered another punch.

His father died from a heart attack. Double orphaned, double devastated, but still, Petrovich refused to back down. Instead, he leveled up his ambition.

Why stop at curing cancer? Why not just cure everything? Malaria, diabetes, heartbreak, cancer, no disease would be safe. He decided to create a drug so powerful it could wipe out every sickness on Earth.

He even gave it a name: Faderul.

It was a bold plan, but bold plans have enemies.

Petrovich’s progress soon caught the attention of some very powerful people. The kind of people who sip overpriced coffee in boardrooms and make decisions that affect the rest of us.

One day, Petrovich got an “invitation.” Not the nice kind, with cake. This one came from men in powerful positions “You will stop this research, or else.”

Now, they didn’t specify what the “or else” was, but Petrovich wasn’t in the mood to find out. So, reluctantly, he stopped his project and went back to being just another brilliant academic.

Two years passed. He tried to move on, but the fire inside him refused to die. You can’t just forget a dream like that, can you?

Then, one rainy evening, something weird happened.

Petrovich’s car, a Toyota Corolla that looked like it had survived a war or two, broke down on his way home. As he struggled with an umbrella that clearly had trust issues, he noticed two men standing across the street.

These weren’t ordinary men. They were dressed in black suits so sharp they could slide a bread, and their shoes shined like they had never seen mud.

But here’s the thing: it was raining, yet these guys were as dry as if they had been standing under an invisible umbrella.

Petrovich’s instincts screamed, “Hold up, something’s not right here.”

But curiosity is a stubborn thing. Before he could make sense of it all, one of the men placed a briefcase on the ground. Without a word, they turned and disappeared. Not walked away. Disappeared. One second they were there, and the next, poof, gone.

Petrovich looked around. No witnesses. No cameras. Just him and the mysterious briefcase.

Now, any sensible person like me would have run away, but Petrovich? He had already survived so much. What’s one more mystery? With a deep breath, he opened it.

Inside was a simple note: “We MUST fund your project. Call 222-34.”

To be continued... or not. Depends on when I dream up the next part. But if Faderul ever becomes real, you heard it here first.",2,1734996680.0,story,0,1.0,False

I'm (26f) 5'7"" and right now I weigh 115 lbs. Around a month ago I was at 120lbs, but as mentioned, I don't eat much so that's where I'm at currently. This is the worst spell I've ever had and I don't know when it will go away. I've had more severe problems with my appetite over the past few years, and my lowest weight has been 110lbs, but it fluctuates. I don't have any diseases or illness contributing to my loss of appetite, it's all just a psychological response. I'm not diagnosed with any mental health issues and I'm not looking to be either. I'm not asking for help for the eating problem, I just want to know how well, and how long, someone like me could survive on 700ish calories a day, maybe not everyday. When would any health problems potentially occur, and can I still avoid them eating that amount or less. I eat fairly healthy when I do, but I don't eat much. Like an example would be: I'll eat a bowl of blueberries, and then 12 hrs later I'll eat some rice. I try to eat some protein when I can. I drink coffee, but I am bad about not drinking anything either. I do drink a glass of water with my medicine every day. I will take multivitamins too. 

I just want a clear answer on what exactly I could be looking at in terms of health problems now or later on. If I don't fix the eating can I do something else. I do get dizzy standing up but that's normal for me. I also sleep a lot but that's also normal for me. I haven't noticed anything else, but I live alone and rarely go anywhere so I don't have a good outside opinion either.

She has manic depressive disorder and my whole life I have been raised by her or her friends (when she was in psychiatric hospitals) because I don't have a father. (My father left my mother when he found out she was pregnant)

What I have to add is that my mom doesn't like her mom but I have a good relationship with my grandmother.

The thing is, I live in a different city than where I grew up, where I have loved ones and where I should celebrate Christmas. And my mom owns a house with several floors in that city. She lives on the second floor and on the second floor there is another apartment (a studio apartment) that my mom rents to my grandmother.(my grandmother has it as a summer residence, she goes there when she is on vacation) My boyfriend and I helped my mom finish the studio apartment... paint it, fix it up, doors, bathroom stuff, etc. Before the holidays I even asked her if we could come to the studio apartment, because we have to be with the cat (we have a kitten) and that if we couldn't sleep with the cat we would stay at home and come for a while on Christmas Eve. Of course, I also asked my grandmother who rents the place. They all agreed.

We brought cat, all the presents and personal stuff for the week. We slept there for like two days and then my mom came in and told us to sleep somewhere else, that her boyfriend was coming over (and she wanted privacy with so they could sleep together and we couldn't hear them or i dont know why else she would want us to leave the apartament) and she needed us to leave the whole floor alone. So I told her that she should have told me ahead of time that we had made arrangements and that if I knew she was going to kick us out again I would never help her finish the apartment and I told her she was being a viper. After that, she got really offended and forbade me to go get my stuff I had ready for Christmas. I had a terrible mental breakdown there and started crying real bad (even the neighbors came to see what was going on) after which my mom said I was crazy and hysterical and she canceled the Christmas party that 15 people were supposed to come to. I feel terrible that I ruined Christmas. I'm broken, I feel like she used me and she doesn't care how I feel. 

For context, when I was smaller and still living with her my mom routinely threw me out so she and her boyfriend could have sex at home. She didn't care at all that I had nowhere to go, she usually gave me some money to go for coffee or to entertain myself, but I needed entertain myself for maybe eight hours or more. What happened brought back memories for me.

Caffeine of course helps abort headaches if you catch them quick enough (hopefully) 

Caffeine is most quickly absorbed through the mouth and gums (coffee on the other hand taking around 5-15 minutes). Neuro Gum is becoming crazy popular online and from Shark Tank. Its essentially like a caffeine and Vitamin B6 and 12 gum. 

Of course sometimes that 5-15 minutes can be the difference maker between no headache and agony so im thinking (if it works) keep a pack of gum on you, if you feel a headache coming on, toss a piece or 2 in and maybe it can abort them.

In fact, given the Whirlpool insider deal, I figured I'd return it and go for a KF8.  I've now changed my mind and will likely be keeping it. Honestly, I still think the KF8 is probably better overall - but I don't feel like hauling the Bosch back to Costco.

My original complaint was that the milk was too lukewarm. Yeah, I know that is a frequent complaint here (I'm not a total noob!) for superautomatics.  But the problems seemed most extreme with the Bosch.  I also have a Philips 5400, and I've really been fine with the temp.  

I resolved the milk temp two ways.  The Costco Bosch has a cup warmer on the top.  I leave two cups on it at night, and when I get up in the morning, I turn on the coffee maker with Alexa (the Bosch has a really nice and usable app with an Alexa skill).  By the time I get upstairs, the bottoms of the cup are toasty warm - no it doesn't heat up the entire cup as glass doesn't transmit heat well, But the bottoms are warm enough to help heat the soy milk as it enters the cup.

The second solution is to pop the glass Bosch container in the microwave for a 30 sec before I make the coffee. 

Overall, I'm satisfied.  It makes great expresso, has a super easy interface and nice app, and it's easy to use. 

So, thumbs up from me IF you are willing to zap the milk container beforehand.  If that step seems annoying, I'd suggest you look elsewhere.  For me, the microwave is in between the frig and coffee maker and it's not even slightly annoying to just heat it first. 

At the price that is currently on Amazon, the Bosch is a terrible value though.  I would not recommend this unit at full price. 

PS the Bosch has no chute for ground coffee and has only one hopper.  If you want a cup of decaf at night (decaf = sex without orgasm as far as I am concerned, never go near the stuff), another reason to look elsewhere.

for the sake of anonymity, we are gonna call him Lucas.

so the story of lucas and i starts back in September of this year, the school musical. i was sat outside the audition room, preparing for my audition and beside me sat Lucas. we slightly knew each other - he was the year above me, but we had alot of mutual friends. we didnt speak much, just exchanged hellos and good lucks. 

fast forward a week and we get the cast list, neither of us got the roles we wanted but we each got a big character. out of no where, he had added me on snapchat. i added him back because we were gonna be together most days for the next  3 months. he messaged me “congrats on getting the role, i look forward to working with you :)”. i thanked him, congratulated him and that was that.

throughout the first 2 months of rehearsals, we spoke but lightly. once the last week came around was when we started properly talking to eachother. we would sit backstage in the dressing rooms together and talk for as long as we could before one of had to go on stage then we came right back and continued the conversation. thats when i noticed him truly for the first time. how pretty he was, how his hair had a perfect swoosh, how soft his hands were, how he made pinky promises as someone in their late teens and how kind he was.

every time that curtain closed to end the show, before leaving the stage then two of us would hug. he isnt a good hugger, he did that awkward sideways hug thing (to those who do that, stop.) but he was soft. he always held the hugs tho, oftrn for minutes.

moving to the last night, we closed the show and in my mind that was it. we would never soeak again, we had no reason too. while i was leaving the school we noticed eachother, i smiled, said goodbye and went on my way.  i was walking and talkinf to one of my friends when my hand gets clutched and he hugged me for the second time that night and he said “we may never speak again, but im glad i met you” and he left. that was it.

until about two days after we had closed the show i received a message from one the people in the show, inviting me to a campfire with the main cast members. i showed up later that night and see Lucas sitting by the fire, the flames illuminating his soft round features while he laughed with someone. he didnt notice me until i was sat on the log across him, talking to my friend. he yelled my name over the blaring music and stood up to come over and greet me. we greeted with a hug before sitting down beside eachother. we spoke for the entire time we were there. then we got sent to go get firewood from the store so we did. on the way there, he turned to me and said “can we never stop talking?” YES PLEASE?? 


we got the firewood and went hack to the group, continued talking rhen went home at about midnight. after that we decided to make the hangouts a weekly thing, but last thursday the weather didnt allow for that so we went to one of our friends house and did kareoke. we sar beside each other and once again, talked. at this point, people started making jokes that the two of us would be perfect together and he agreed and then, leaned his head on my shoulder for the rest of the day. was he joking? probably. did i melt internally? absolutely. 

after about an hour, the group decided that we all want pizza. so we split our money and i offered to go grab it from the pizza place across the road. i was halfway there when i hear distant running, i turn and see him running towards me, saying ye had nothing better ti do but go with me so off we went. we were walking when he said “yk how i said we would probably never talk again? im glad we did.” so, i basically died. later that nigjt, while i was lying in bed, i get a text from him, inviting me too hangout one on one in a cafe. OF COURSE??

we went out for coffee the next day, he payed (omgomgomgomg) and we had an amazing time. we have hung out a few times since with the group and have another coffee arranged for tomorrow and i don’t know if he considers it a date or not.

I have no idea, friends, lovers, haters, who knows. I'm a terrible flirt so apologies in advance.

I am an avid reader, my bookcase is full of books i've yet to read and a lot of I have read and cannot come to terms with giving away. If I am not reading I will likely be sat under a blanket somewhere in my house playing video games. As with most people on Reddit, I am indeed a huge nerd. I love to code & paint too! I am really just spraying my thoughts onto this right now, there is only so much you can say about yourself without writing a life story.

As for other things I like to do:

Stumble into things, I am very clumsy. Drink an ungodly amount of coffee, listen to music far too loud on my headphones, order too much food for myself and regret it later, pretend like I understand politics, suck at boardgames and sing karaoke.

happy to swap photos etc. just don't be super weird or uninterested in talking. I am also not picky about where you are from, so don't let that put you off :) hope to speak to you soon

She has manic depressive disorder and my whole life I have been raised by her or her friends (when she was in psychiatric hospitals) because I don't have a father. (My father left my mother when he found out she was pregnant)

What I have to add is that my mom doesn't like her mom but I have a good relationship with my grandmother.

The thing is, I live in a different city than where I grew up, where I have loved ones and where I should celebrate Christmas. And my mom owns a house with several floors in that city. She lives on the second floor and on the second floor there is another apartment (a studio apartment) that my mom rents to my grandmother.(my grandmother has it as a summer residence, she goes there when she is on vacation) My boyfriend and I helped my mom finish the studio apartment... paint it, fix it up, doors, bathroom stuff, etc. Before the holidays I even asked her if we could come to the studio apartment, because we have to be with the cat (we have a kitten) and that if we couldn't sleep with the cat we would stay at home and come for a while on Christmas Eve. Of course, I also asked my grandmother who rents the place. They all agreed.

We brought cat, all the presents and personal stuff for the week. We slept there for like two days and then my mom came in and told us to sleep somewhere else, that her boyfriend was coming over (and she wanted privacy with so they could sleep together and we couldn't hear them or i dont know why else she would want us to leave the apartament) and she needed us to leave the whole floor alone. So I told her that she should have told me ahead of time that we had made arrangements and that if I knew she was going to kick us out again I would never help her finish the apartment and I told her she was being a viper. After that, she got really offended and forbade me to go get my stuff I had ready for Christmas. I had a terrible mental breakdown there and started crying real bad (even the neighbors came to see what was going on) after which my mom said I was crazy and hysterical and she canceled the Christmas party that 15 people were supposed to come to. I feel terrible that I ruined Christmas. I'm broken, I feel like she used me and she doesn't care how I feel. 

For context, when I was smaller and still living with her my mom routinely threw me out so she and her boyfriend could have sex at home. She didn't care at all that I had nowhere to go, she usually gave me some money to go for coffee or to entertain myself, but I needed entertain myself for maybe eight hours or more. What happened brought back memories for me.

I'm curious what you guys do for quick energy? In my experience, coffee and meds don't give me energy they just help my brain focus. My friend was recently diagnosed, and her reaction to Adderall was much different from mine. It made me wonder if there is something I could take that would give me that kick of ""I can't sit still I have to go do stuff"" energy. 

That's probably the thing I've struggled with most, not being able to get up and go. Even when I know I really need to. The only thing I've found that will actually give me energy is a nap and a snack and that's not usually an option lol. But maybe I'm just not looking in the right direction.

I have been living with my parents after my last partner kicked me out (said I was useless for not making coffee) and living with them hasn’t been easy either as well as being a single mother. I have to move out of my parents home due to them selling the house and I CANNOT and WILL NOT surrender my dog because she is like another child to me. Ive made an appointment with my psychiatrist who knows about my depression and anxiety but she has also prescribed to me medication for ADHD and my depression. With that said, I don’t know if my psychiatrist will approve or not because we mostly just talk about my ADHD since I have a therapist but my therapist doesn’t have the certification to help with my ESA certification for my dog. What are some creditable sites that I can use just in case my therapist doesn’t approve my dog to be ESA certified? Do I have to renew this every year?

Basically I work in the same parking lot as a hobby lobby I work at one of the popular American coffee chains( I won’t say which one) but basically the lots are connected but the technical lot that actually belongs to my work is too small for my van and I see how the customers drive and parking in that lot is a quick way to either get hit(people speeding on their phones because the only spot available is right at the drive through exit) my boss is aware of the fact that we leave in our van and I guess she made the hobby lobby manager aware as well in case there was any reason that someone might report us, I’m literally only in that lot when I work but because I live in the van sometimes I end up running to another store grabbing something at my managers request at 2/3/4 am. Here is the problem about 4 times my husband has gotten the knock from a Karen she’s been in different cars but she’s always the same woman. The first time my husband explained to her that I work there and that I have permission to be parked there(not to even mention the fact that there are 5 constant vans in that lot including a Winnebago that had been there literally 10 years) however she knows that he’s epileptic and has now taken to harassing him threatening to have his service dog taken  the car towed call the police etc. this then stresses him out to the point that he has a seizure and then by the time he comes out of it and calls me and I run out she’s got. Today she caused a seizure so bad that I marched into hobby lobby because he said she claimed that she had the “manager” with her(she had a man in a blue vest or whatever)he had one of the worst episodes he’s had in a when he called me she had already left(he wasn’t sure how soon after the incident because she caused a bad seizure and when I got to the car she had left he was there sobbing holding onto his service dog) . Apparently she had told him animal control a tow truck and the police were coming. That’s when I went inside to talk to the manager at hobby lobby and found out that a she definitely didn’t have any manager with her because the manager was a woman and she said no male managers were even on shift but besides just that she had already had this woman try to report me and the manager told her that she was aware we were parked there and that if she continued to harass me that the police would be called. The manager suggested that next time I see the woman to call police for harassment the only issue? She’s never there when I’m there because I’m always working and when I’m not working she’s not there, I obviously told my husband so he’s kinda aware and that it hopefully helps him not have seizures but I’m fully confident she literally watches and waits for me to leave because she comes hours into my shift morning and night shifts alike and when I’m there because I tried to wait her out to confront her on my last off shift she doesn’t show. What do I even do? She always drives a different car and doesn’t stick around I don’t think the police can do anything if she’s not there when they arrive. ",8,1734995282.0,VanLife,31,0.72,False

I was excited by the chance to finally have dinner at Ron Gastrobar in Amsterdam after reading/watching several positive reviews of the restaurant.

This evening I finally got to visit this establishment and was quickly deflated by the poor service which became complete disappointment at the entire experience.

My wife and I each ordered the Blaauwdruk, which is the four-course “chef surprise me” menu.  This was a complete joke because three of the four courses came directly off the menu. The server told us when we ordered

So here is my thoughts on each course.

Starter course: the only non-menu item we got. It was a foie gras with a port glaze between slices of a brioche toast and an apple compote. The brioche toast reminded both of us of something that tasted like gingerbread and while it wasn’t terrible, it was not interesting either. This dish was at best…just okay. 

Entree #1: was smoked eel on a potato terrine with pepperoni and sorrel. This dish was just awful. The taste of black pepper was so overwhelming that I simply didn’t want to finish it. Both my wife and I didn’t finish because it was just too unpleasant to eat. This led to us getting Entree #2, which by this point we didn’t even want and tried to convince the server to please just bring us the next course, but that was not happening.

Entree #3: was salmon with ouzo in a buerre blanc foam. This was also a disappointment because the fish was undercooked. Both ends were cooked and the center was nearly raw.

Main: pheasant in pastry with blood sausage and sauerkraut. Another disappointing course. It would have benefited from some salt to help it with some flavor.

Dessert: Merengue with ice cream and amarena cherries. This was an okay dessert, but uninspired.

Overall the food ranged from simply disappointing to outright awful.

I would also add that to get through these four courses took 3 hours.  Simply unacceptable. A couple in line behind us at the coat check mentioned they only got 2 courses over a 3 hour stretch and were just done with the place.

We actually watched the manager chew out a couple different servers in front of us on different occasions. I can say nothing good about the experience.

Growing up in northern Ontario, trees were easy to find. But that abundance of choice meant a lot of time in the cold bush for my younger brother and I. We men would set out, usually in blowing snow, to some place Dad knew. The toboggan was on our station wagon's roof rack, ready for the tree. We drove with the heater full blast, AM radio warning folks winter weather. After about 30 minutes, we parked and soon I followed Dad on snowshoes, pulling the toboggan with my brother on it. Slave labor in deep snow. Dad looked at this tree, then that tree, and further along did so again. Eventually, the Chosen Tree was Found. Dad cut it and tied it to the toboggan then perched by brother on top for weight. Back to the car we went, breath in the air and following our tracks.

Frozen solid, I slogged and towed bro and tree with leaden feet. Finally: the car! Halleluiah! Dad tied the tree to the roof, stowed the toboggan inside and started the car for its very welcome heat. Dad asked me to open the plaid thermos he brought and pour him half a cup. I did, passing the steaming coffee to him. He drank and passed me the empty cap-cup with a wink and said ""You are old enough to have a coffee, lad."" I poured again and drank it, almost in one hot gulp. Kabang! The small amount of rum in the coffee hit slowly and my frozen feet and fingers began to pink up and thaw. ""Keep our secret and do not tell your mother about this."" said Dad. We drove the tree home and squeezed it into the living room. Decorating came after, but for now our Annual Christmas Tree Hunt was thankfully over as I warmed, cozy by the fireplace.

I posted previously on this sub, I can link in the comments if it would be helpful but will summarize here. 

I don’t think he or I (both late 30s-early 40s) were ready to be in a relationship at the time but we liked each other so much that it felt like the only option. Then it ended tenderly and with a lot of care and compassion for the other person, but it was very sad and I struggled to understand my feelings after. 

We took some space for a few months and 2 months ago he started slowly checking in and seeing how I was doing, eventually turned into him inviting me out for coffee or offering to bring over some takeout consistently every week. Progressively, we’ve been spending more time together as friends and it has been so nice. Then I had something difficult happen in my life and he was the one I wanted to call, and he’s been really supportive and has made me feel very emotionally safe with him. 

Lately things seemed to have gotten a little more flirty on both ends and I’m finding myself wanting to get closer to him. I’m starting to think that the crush is coming back, but because of our previous ending I have my guard up.

We haven’t really checked in yet but we are on the same page with just treating the friendship with care. But I can’t seem to help the way I feel around him! At this point, the connection feels special enough that I would rather see what’s there than avoid the pain of a breakup. 

I don’t have much experience moving slowly with someone that I’m super into, even though I have been working very hard to change that in general. But everything has gone a comfortable pace. He’s really been showing me how much he cares and I believe if/when there’s a right time to share feelings, I’ll know. 

But I could use some help keeping my head screwed on:

1. Could use some advice on taking things slow (especially for neurodivergent folks)

2. What might be some good things to communicate about or try if considering a second chance with someone?

The person that recorded it had to be standing the opposite direction from where she was running. There was a gap there between the buildings. Even if someone witnessed it and recorded it that was normal. Everything is recorded nowadays, Kimi thought. However, the question still remained, how did the recorder know Kimi and how did they get her contact information? She had been holding off on hunting lately with the nagging feeling of being watched. The video proved her feeling correct. Someone was watching and she couldn't afford to let them catch her in her ""extra curricular activities."" 

Kimi's phone suddenly rang. She looked down to find another unfamiliar number. She cautiously answered and was met with the kind, tenor voice of a man she had never spoken to before on the other end. 

""Hello am I speaking to Ms. Kimbrel Wayland?"" The man asked politely. 

""Who's asking?""

""Ah, yes, I'm Mr. Burgess... secretary to Mr. Scott.""

""Who the hell is Mr. Scott?"" Kimi asked standing
 up. 

""Before I tell you that I need to verify that I'm speaking with Ms. Kimbrel Wayland."" The man responded firmly. 

Kimi narrowed her eyes and steadied her breath. She wasn't sure what this was about but she needed to find out more.

""Yes, I'm Kimbrel. Now who is Mr. Scott and why are you calling me?"" She demanded. 

""Mr. Scott is the father of one of the young men you had the...um...run in with in the alley way."" The man said sheepishly. 

Kimi's anger began to rise as her cheeks flushed. She remembered Wyatt Scott's name under the video sent. 

""What do you want?"" She asked coldly. 

""Mr. Scott would like to meet you in person...He would like to apologize for his son's behavior and speak with you more about the issue. Will that be okay Ms. Wayland?"" The man asked politely. 

Kimi remained quiet, staring at herself in her mirror as her body shook in anger. 

Darien's body shook violently as he went over the call recordings between Armand Scott and his secretary Mr. Burgess. They were able to find out Kimi's full name as Wyatt had seen her first name on a name tag during one of the orientation events. Armand Scott had instructed Mr. Burgess to get a ""tech guy"" to find out who sent the video and to contact ""the girl."" He wanted the issue dealt with quietly and quickly. He owned a aerospace company and was about to enter into a series of contracts with the Department of Defense, which would bring in billions. He couldn't let anything interrupt his business. 

""They're going to bother Kimi!"" Darien yelled angrily in his room. 

Contracts huh? Darien thought. He also found out that Beck Ryan's father was a junior state senator and that Seth Asher's parents owned a few restaurants that were doing quite well. They had been notified of their son's behaviors and had been given the video. Darien now had access to all of their phones and various amounts of information. He leaned back in his chair and stared at his computer screen. Now it was a matter of when to use the information to pay them back for their misdeeds.

""Ms. Wayland? Are you still there?"" 

""Yes, I'm still here."" Kimi responded gritting her teeth. 

""Are you willing to meet Mr. Scott?""

""When and where?"" 

""Wonderful! Mr. Scott has an office in the city. We can send someone to pick you up tomorrow if you're free?""

""No, I'll come there myself."" Kimi responded firmly. 

""Understood...then I'll text you the address and time. Thank you for agreeing to meet Mr. Scott on such short notice. We'll see you tomorrow."" 

Kimi disconnected the call and sat her phone back on the bed. She felt a mixture of furiousness and nervousness. She would need to be careful, very careful. Tomorrow was a Sunday, a relatively slow but busy day. She wouldn't meet them anywhere secluded as this could be a trap. Her phone dinged and she snatched it up. An address was sent a long with the time of 9:00 a.m. Kimi quickly Googled the address and a large and tall office building with S Aerospace written in bold white letters above it's many windows appeared. It was located on a busy street surrounded by other businesses. 

Kimi pressed the website link and read up on the company. It was a small hub of a much larger company of the same name that developed aircrafts. Before Kimi could finish her research Nana knocked on her door softly. Kimi quickly sat her phone down and invited her in. 

""Hey Kimi, I just wanted to make sure you were still okay?"" Nana asked kindly. 

Kimi smiled awkwardly. The girls had been surprisedly supportive and kind. She wasn't a very sociable or open person, that was always Cameron but she was enjoying her time in the apartment so far. Kimi sat on her bed and rubbed her cheeks where the bruises were. 

""I'm okay...hey, I have to go check on something tomorrow. If...if I don't come back after a couple of hours, call the police."" Kimi said looking at Nana's worried face.

""Oh my God Kimi! What's going on?!"" Nana asked rushing over. 

*Sunday* 

Kimi stepped out of her Uber and stood in front of the large office building. Rain drops hit her stylish rain jacket making a soft pitter patter. She looked down at her phone, the time read 8:45 a.m. The street was surprisedly busy for an early Sunday morning. She was also surprised to see so many people working inside the building. She pulled on the large silver handle and walked inside. The inside was modern with glossy flooring. A rather large airplane display hung from the ceiling. Looking up Kimi could see multiple floors. 

""Ms. Wayland?"" A familiar voice spoke out grabbing Kimi's attention.

Kimi was met with the polite smile of a man that looked to be in his early 30s. His brown hair was combed neatly back. His eyes were light brown and bright. He wore a navy blue suit and brown tie with shoes that matched. He was of medium height and build and was classically attractive. Kimi stared at him up and down without speaking or smiling back. 

""I'm Mr. Burgess...we spoke yesterday on the phone.""

""Yes, I know who you are by your voice."" Kimi responded coldly. 

""Ah, I see...Well, your early, which is fine. Mr. Scott is in a meeting that will be over in a few minutes. Let me take you to his office so...""

""No, I don't feel comfortable talking in his office. I want to speak with him out in the open."" Kimi interjected gripping her purse strap tightly. 

""I understand, however, the subject is sensitive and...""

""I'm not discussing anything unless it's in the open. PERIOD."" Kimi insisted. 

Mr. Burgess looked at her with a bit of frustration but shook his head in agreement. 

""Okay, I'll let Mr. Scott know. Well, we have a coffee shop in here. I'll have you wait there...will that be okay?"" He asked remaining polite. 

""I'll follow you there."" Kimi responded. 

Kimi paid close attention to where they walked. She took mental note of each hallway and every exit just in case. Office workers holding coffee cups passed by and greeted them politely as they walked down a long corridor where the right wall was just windows looking out at the rainy day and traffic. The smell of freshly brewed coffee and pastries drifted into Kimi's nose as they approached glass double doors at the end of the corridor. Inside was a spacious and modern coffee shop with three baristas behind the counter. 

The glass display cases were filled with numerous pastries, bagels and sandwiches. Quite a few two and four person tables were scattered about the shop along with a few light gray faux leather, love seats with glass coffee tables in front of them. Large, circular columns stood tall throughout the large shop offering semi privacy to certain areas. Mr. Burgess led Kimi to a two person table that was away from the others by a window and slightly behind one of the large columns. He motioned for her to sit down with a smile, which she did. She looked around cautiously. 

""Ms. Wayland would you like something to drink or eat while we wait?"" Mr. Burgess asked.

""No, thank you. I'm fine."" Kimi responded looking around.

Mr. Burgess smiled again before excusing himself. He walked a distance away and made a phone call with his back turned to Kimi. He stayed that way for a few minutes until abruptly spinning around, instructing Kimi politely to remain there as he would step away briefly. He walked away briskly straighting his already straight brown tie. A few moments later he reappeared with a tall, older gentleman with a ridiculously expensive black suit and red tie on. An expensive watch rested on his wrist. He wore a solid gold wedding ring and another ring on the pinky of his opposite hand. Kimi instantly recognized the man as her attacker's father as they shared the same dirty blonde hair and pale gray eyes and naturally, punchable smug looks. This was Mr. Scott. 

He sat down in front of Kimi and gave a robotic smile before instructing Mr. Burgess to bring him a coffee and plain bagel with cream cheese. 

""Sorry, I had a meeting and didn't have time to eat breakfast... Would you like anything? You can get whatever you want."" Mr. Scott asked smiling at Kimi. 

""No thank you."" Kimi responded firmly.

""Are you sure? The coffee here is wonderful. The beans come all the way from Ethiopia and produce   magnificent and complex flavors. The food is great as well."" He explained enthusiastically.

""No, I'm fine."" 

Mr. Scott shook his head to dismiss Mr. Burgess. He peeked out of the large window briefly before meeting Kimi's eyes.

""Well, I can certainly see why my son took a liking to you Ms. Wayland. You're a beautiful young woman."" He said calmly.

Kimi felt disgust rise in her stomach at his words. 

""Why am I here?"" She asked directly. 

""Well, first I wanted to apologize for my son and his friend's behavior. They were out of line and what they did...what they did was wrong. I'm very sorry.""

""You're not the one that wronged me so why are you the one apologizing?"" Kimi asked.

Mr. Scott sat back in the chair and crossed his hand on the table. He made eye contact with Kimi. 

""Ms. Wayland my son has always been an idiot. He's spoiled...I blame his mother and maternal grandfather for that. He inherited his grandfather's ability to hit a ball with a stick and he's treated like gold for it. His mother, well, we lost three pregnancies before having Wyatt. To his mother he's her miracle baby. She gives him whatever he wants. It's made him quite entitled."" Mr. Scott explained. 

""I'm sorry, what does any of this have to do with me or what happened in the alley?"" Kimi retorted.

""I just want you to understand that I know what kind of person Wyatt is and that I'm not making excuses for his behavior. I would like us to find a equally beneficial solution to this issue Ms. Wayland."" Mr. Scott said leaning a bit across the table.

""Equally beneficial?"" Kimi asked confused. 

""Yes, you seem like the kind of young person that likes to get straight to the point so let me do that. How much will it take for you to forget this little incident?"" Mr. Scott asked calculatedly. 

Kimi sat back in her seat locking eyes with Mr. Scott. 

""You got to be fucking kidding me?"" She replied angrily.

1hkzvmt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Horror_stories/comments/1hkzvmt/tease_pt_8/,Tease Pt. 8,"Kimi nervously watched the video again paying attention to the angle at which it was shot. The person that recorded it had to be standing the opposite direction from where she was running. There was a gap there between the buildings. Even if someone witnessed it and recorded it that was normal. Everything is recorded nowadays, Kimi thought. However, the question still remained, how did the recorder know Kimi and how did they get her contact information? She had been holding off on hunting lately with the nagging feeling of being watched. The video proved her feeling correct. Someone was watching and she couldn't afford to let them catch her in her ""extra curricular activities."" 

Kimi's phone suddenly rang. She looked down to find another unfamiliar number. She cautiously answered and was met with the kind, tenor voice of a man she had never spoken to before on the other end. 

""Hello am I speaking to Ms. Kimbrel Wayland?"" The man asked politely. 

""Who's asking?""

""Ah, yes, I'm Mr. Burgess... secretary to Mr. Scott.""

""Who the hell is Mr. Scott?"" Kimi asked standing
 up. 

""Before I tell you that I need to verify that I'm speaking with Ms. Kimbrel Wayland."" The man responded firmly. 

Kimi narrowed her eyes and steadied her breath. She wasn't sure what this was about but she needed to find out more.

""Yes, I'm Kimbrel. Now who is Mr. Scott and why are you calling me?"" She demanded. 

""Mr. Scott is the father of one of the young men you had the...um...run in with in the alley way."" The man said sheepishly. 

Kimi's anger began to rise as her cheeks flushed. She remembered Wyatt Scott's name under the video sent. 

""What do you want?"" She asked coldly. 

""Mr. Scott would like to meet you in person...He would like to apologize for his son's behavior and speak with you more about the issue. Will that be okay Ms. Wayland?"" The man asked politely. 

Kimi remained quiet, staring at herself in her mirror as her body shook in anger. 

Darien's body shook violently as he went over the call recordings between Armand Scott and his secretary Mr. Burgess. They were able to find out Kimi's full name as Wyatt had seen her first name on a name tag during one of the orientation events. Armand Scott had instructed Mr. Burgess to get a ""tech guy"" to find out who sent the video and to contact ""the girl."" He wanted the issue dealt with quietly and quickly. He owned a aerospace company and was about to enter into a series of contracts with the Department of Defense, which would bring in billions. He couldn't let anything interrupt his business. 

""They're going to bother Kimi!"" Darien yelled angrily in his room. 

Contracts huh? Darien thought. He also found out that Beck Ryan's father was a junior state senator and that Seth Asher's parents owned a few restaurants that were doing quite well. They had been notified of their son's behaviors and had been given the video. Darien now had access to all of their phones and various amounts of information. He leaned back in his chair and stared at his computer screen. Now it was a matter of when to use the information to pay them back for their misdeeds.

""Ms. Wayland? Are you still there?"" 

""Yes, I'm still here."" Kimi responded gritting her teeth. 

""Are you willing to meet Mr. Scott?""

""When and where?"" 

""Wonderful! Mr. Scott has an office in the city. We can send someone to pick you up tomorrow if you're free?""

""No, I'll come there myself."" Kimi responded firmly. 

""Understood...then I'll text you the address and time. Thank you for agreeing to meet Mr. Scott on such short notice. We'll see you tomorrow."" 

Kimi disconnected the call and sat her phone back on the bed. She felt a mixture of furiousness and nervousness. She would need to be careful, very careful. Tomorrow was a Sunday, a relatively slow but busy day. She wouldn't meet them anywhere secluded as this could be a trap. Her phone dinged and she snatched it up. An address was sent a long with the time of 9:00 a.m. Kimi quickly Googled the address and a large and tall office building with S Aerospace written in bold white letters above it's many windows appeared. It was located on a busy street surrounded by other businesses. 

Kimi pressed the website link and read up on the company. It was a small hub of a much larger company of the same name that developed aircrafts. Before Kimi could finish her research Nana knocked on her door softly. Kimi quickly sat her phone down and invited her in. 

""Hey Kimi, I just wanted to make sure you were still okay?"" Nana asked kindly. 

Kimi smiled awkwardly. The girls had been surprisedly supportive and kind. She wasn't a very sociable or open person, that was always Cameron but she was enjoying her time in the apartment so far. Kimi sat on her bed and rubbed her cheeks where the bruises were. 

""I'm okay...hey, I have to go check on something tomorrow. If...if I don't come back after a couple of hours, call the police."" Kimi said looking at Nana's worried face.

""My dearest Drea,

My hope is that someday, it’s you who discovers this letter. Adrian can be impulsive and unpredictable, and I have no idea what he might do in the future.

Drea, my little spark, my strength—I wish I’d had more time to see you grow, to be there for you. You are my heart, my sunshine, and please, always remember that. There’s so much I want to say, but time has grown scarce; I can feel it slipping away. My health is failing quickly, and it’s not by accident.

You deserve to know, Drea, that the reason for my failing health is Vivian—your mother. I wanted so badly for our marriage to work, wanted to share everything with her. But she only cared about my fortune, and she’s gone to great lengths to secure it for herself.

My estate belongs solely to you and Adrian. I wanted to make this clear in a will, but I never expected time to run out this way. I’ve long suspected Vivian was tainting my drinks, but today, I’m certain. She brought me coffee not long ago, and there, faintly on the cup’s rim, were traces of a familiar poison. I could call the police or rush to the hospital, but instead, I choose to write to you now, hoping you find this someday, hidden here in your nursery.

If things go as I hope, David may look after you, maybe even adopt you, though he doesn’t know of you yet. If not, I pray Adrian finds you and keeps you safe. I believe you’ll grow into a remarkable woman, strong and resilient, Drea. Know that I loved you fiercely. Please tell Adrian that despite his anger over my choices, I’m deeply sorry and that I love him as well.

I love you both,

\~Emerson Grant""

The letter slipped from Drea’s trembling fingers, her legs giving way. Sorin quickly wrapped an arm around her shoulders, holding her upright as she crumpled into his side.

Tears blurred her vision, and through them, she looked up at Sorin, whose expression held a quiet grief. Though he was only a child back then, his affection for his uncle had been real.

She managed to choke out, “W-what does this mean?”

""Shh,"" Sorin soothed her, bending to pick up the letter and carefully slipping it into her book. “Not here, not now. Let’s get home, then we can talk.”

She nodded, her lips trembling as tears spilled over. Sorin gently wiped them away, wrapped an arm around her waist, and guided her out of the room. They descended the stairs quietly, moving toward the exit.

Just as they reached the door, her mother’s shrill voice called after them, “Leaving already? You haven’t stayed for lunch.”

Sorin’s jaw clenched tightly. Murderous woman, he thought, before turning to face her with a forced smile. “I’d rather have lunch alone with my wife. Thanks.” With that, he steered Drea out the door.

Once they were safely away, he pulled the car to a stop by the side of the road, dropping his head against the steering wheel. “Damn it, damn it, damn it.”

A soft touch settled over his hand, gripping the wheel tightly. Lifting his head, he found Drea’s gaze, shimmering with unshed tears as she tried to hold them back.

“D-do you… think this could really be true?” Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

He reached for the book and retrieved the letter, directing her gaze to its signature. “Look, he signed it. If we can track down some old documents he might’ve signed, we’ll have proof.” He paused, deep in thought. “Dad must have something lying around.” A loud groan escaped him as he pinched the bridge of his nose, tears gathering in his eyes. “Why did my uncle have to be so reckless? He could’ve at least confided in my father and asked for his help! Damn it!”

Drea intertwined her fingers with his, offering a comforting squeeze. “We… we don’t really know what was going on back then…”

A sob erupted from him. “I loved him so much, Drea. I don’t remember everything, but I know I did. To learn he met such a tragic end…”

Leaning forward, Drea rested her forehead against his bicep, weeping alongside him. He lowered his chin onto her head, tears streaming down his cheeks as they sought solace in one another’s embrace.

After several moments, he wiped his eyes and said, “Call Adrian. Tell him to meet us at home.”

Drea nodded as Sorin drove away. When they arrived, Adrian sat at the dining table, his head bowed and hands gripping his hair in despair, the letter sprawled before him.

Taking a seat beside him, Drea wrapped her arm around him, offering comfort while Sorin stood back, his mind racing as he contemplated their next steps. Grief could wait; justice for his uncle was their immediate priority, and Sorin vowed he wouldn’t rest until it was served.

Suddenly, Adrian shot up from his seat, his eyes bloodshot and wild. He pulled out his pistol from the holster at his waist, making Drea gasp softly in shock.

“That’s it! That woman is going to pay today. I’ve tolerated her long enough!” He growled, striding toward the door. Drea grasped his wrist, desperately trying to halt him.

“Adrian, no!”

1hkzu7j,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbyautistics/comments/1hkzu7j/on_relief_and_grief/,On relief and grief,"This year has been a strange, bittersweet collision of relief and grief—relief in finding connection and community through my online friends who do yoga, whom I know through Instagram, and grief in feeling misunderstood by my presumably autistic mother. It’s a constant dance between celebration and frustration, between what I’ve found for myself and what my mother struggles to see.

The yoga community has been a lifeline, a reminder that shared passions—no matter how unconventional—can bridge gaps that other relationships can’t. This year, I decided to take those connections offline, to meet the people behind the posts, to trade DMs for real conversations over coffee. I packed my bags with excitement and nerves, traveling miles to see people others would call strangers but whom I consider friends. The world might not understand this, and that’s okay. I’m not looking for their validation.

Yet, explaining these friendships to my mother brings a familiar ache. She doesn’t see what I see—the creativity, the joy, the shared experiences. When I talk about their hobbies, the love they pour into cooking or hiking or photography, she asks, “But how good are they? Do they make money or win awards?” It’s an exhausting kind of reductiveness, like I need to justify the worth of others to prove the worth of my own connections. I tried to explain, “Hobbies don’t have to be award-winning or profitable—they just have to bring joy.” I even looked up the definition to be sure. And while I know I’m right, the fact that I needed to look it up just to defend myself stung.

These interactions chip away at my trust, even as I keep extending invitations and hoping things will change. I invited her over recently, excited to spend time together. She packed her bag with things that screamed distrust—her own water bottles, her own massage ball—because she doesn’t trust my water, my equipment, my space. She complained about a smell, pinpointing one article of clothing, and I tried to soothe the situation by saying, “The window is open, there’s fresh air,” but it didn’t seem to matter.

Still, I kept trying. I mentioned how I went on a hike with a group, proud of myself for committing to something outside my comfort zone. Her questions felt practical on the surface—“Where did you go? How was the air quality?”—but they weren’t about me. She didn’t see the courage it took to go, to meet new people, to push past the fear that so many let stop them. That moment, that hat off to myself moment, was mine, and I’m holding it tightly, even if she can’t.

There’s relief in knowing I’ve found people who do see me—friends from yoga who celebrate small wins. And yet there’s grief in realizing that the person I wanted to celebrate with most can’t meet me where I am.

On a certain unforgettable day, I was lying in bed, staring at the ceiling, trying to make sense of the chaos inside me—caught between grief, bitterness, and the ache that consumed me. When I heard my brother knock on the door, I lifted the invisible weight pressing on my heart and rushed to open it.

 Looking at his face—the features that I love and memorize with my heart—I felt something unfamiliar, something beyond the emotions I had grown accustomed to. I can’t describe it, Stella, but whatever it was, it washed over me. Effortlessly, leaving little to no room for the pain I had felt just moments before. The words, ""Shall I make us some coffee?"" slipped from my mouth before I even realized what was happening. Because you know stella, whatever that feeling was, I welcomed it. I held onto it.

The idea of us drinking coffee together seemed strange to him. He smiled uncontrollably, his excitement reflecting the rarity of my offer, and I couldn’t have felt worse. I won’t lie, Stella—I was holding back tears. Had I been so distracted that I neglected the people I treasure most? To the point where they found it almost surreal that I sought to spend time with them? And shamefully, I—who claim to have so much love to give—had failed to properly give it to someone so precious, someone I almost consider a part of myself.


He told me about his day, his work overwhelming his innocent, boyish details as he sipped his coffee. Sitting across from him, I made mine just the way I like it—half milk, half coffee, and a dash of cinnamon. His humor was unmatched, drawing laughter from my drained being, naturally. No one ever makes me laugh the way he does. I wish I had told him that... but I didn’t.

You know, Stella, that day I didn't feel like I was lighting anyone's sky. But that coffee back then, tasted like the best thing in my life.

We’ve all been there, haven't we? Leaning in close to whisper something, only to be subtly recoiled from. Or worse, offered a mint. Bad breath, or halitosis as it's clinically known, can be a real confidence killer. But where does this often-embarrassing affliction originate? Many believe it’s solely a matter of oral hygiene, but could the source of the stench actually be lurking deeper – in the gut? That brings us to the central question: does bad breath come from the gut? Let's delve into this intriguing connection and uncover the truth.

Does Bad Breath Come From the Gut? Exploring the Gut-Mouth Connection
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Before we jump into the nitty-gritty, it's important to understand the usual suspects behind bad breath. Most often, it's the bacteria in our mouths feasting on food particles, releasing volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) that have a distinctly rotten-egg aroma. However, the gut, with its trillions of bacteria, plays a more significant role than you might think. Could an imbalance in this internal ecosystem be the hidden culprit behind your breath woes?

### The Usual Suspects: Oral Hygiene and Diet

Let’s not beat around the bush: poor oral hygiene is the leading cause of bad breath. Think about it – leftover food particles are like an all-you-can-eat buffet for odor-causing bacteria. Likewise, a dry mouth deprives your saliva of its cleansing power, allowing bacteria to flourish. And let's not forget about certain foods. Garlic, onions, and coffee are notorious for leaving their mark, so to speak. They contain compounds that are absorbed into the bloodstream and released through the lungs, contributing to bad breath.

### The Gut's Role in Halitosis: Beyond the Mouth

So, where does the gut fit into all of this? Well, picture this: your gut is a bustling metropolis of bacteria, both good and bad. When this ecosystem is in balance, everything runs smoothly. But when things get out of whack – perhaps due to a poor diet, stress, or illness – it can lead to an overgrowth of harmful bacteria. These bacteria produce foul-smelling gases, some of which can make their way into the bloodstream and be exhaled through the lungs, contributing to bad breath.

Does Bad Breath Come From the Gut? Unraveling the Science
---------------------------------------------------------

Now that we've established a possible link, let's dig a little deeper into the science. How exactly can gut health influence what’s coming out of our mouths? The answer lies in the complex interplay between our gut microbiome, our digestive system, and our respiratory system.

### Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO) and Bad Breath

SIBO is a condition characterized by an excessive amount of bacteria in the small intestine. Normally, the small intestine has relatively few bacteria compared to the colon. However, when bacteria migrate from the colon to the small intestine, it can lead to a variety of digestive issues, including, you guessed it, bad breath. These bacteria produce gases like hydrogen sulfide and methanethiol, which are notorious for their unpleasant odors.

### Helicobacter Pylori and its Connection to Halitosis

Another potential gut-related culprit is *Helicobacter pylori*, a bacterium that can infect the stomach lining. While primarily associated with stomach ulcers, *H. pylori* has also been linked to bad breath. Some studies suggest that *H. pylori* produces VSCs, contributing to that unwanted oral odor.

### Gut Dysbiosis: A Microbial Imbalance

Beyond specific conditions like SIBO and *H. pylori* infections, a general imbalance in the gut microbiome, known as dysbiosis, can also play a role. This imbalance can lead to increased production of VSCs and other foul-smelling compounds, which can manifest as bad breath.

Does Bad Breath Come From the Gut? Practical Steps for Fresher Breath
---------------------------------------------------------------------

So, what can you do if you suspect your gut is playing a role in your bad breath? The good news is that there are several steps you can take to address the issue.

1. **Improve your oral hygiene:** This is non-negotiable! Brush and floss regularly, and don’t forget to clean your tongue. Consider using a tongue scraper to remove bacteria and debris.
2. **Stay hydrated:** Drinking plenty of water helps wash away food particles and keeps your mouth moist, preventing bacterial growth.
3. **Eat a balanced diet:** Focus on whole foods, including fruits, vegetables, and lean protein. Limit processed foods, sugary drinks, and foods known to cause bad breath.
4. **Manage stress:** Stress can disrupt the gut microbiome, so finding healthy ways to manage stress, such as exercise, yoga, or meditation, can be beneficial.
5. **Consider probiotics:** Probiotics are live microorganisms that can help restore a healthy balance of bacteria in the gut.
6. **Consult a healthcare professional:** If you suspect you have SIBO, *H. pylori*, or another gut-related condition, it’s crucial to consult a doctor for diagnosis and treatment. Don't try to self-diagnose or self-treat!
7. **Keep a food journal:** Tracking your food intake can help identify any dietary triggers for your bad breath.
8. **Chew sugar-free gum:** Chewing gum stimulates saliva production, which helps wash away bacteria and debris.

Addressing the Root Cause: A Holistic Approach
----------------------------------------------

Remember, addressing bad breath isn't just about masking the odor, it’s about tackling the underlying cause. If you suspect a gut connection, taking a holistic approach that considers both oral and gut health is essential. Think of it this way: your mouth is like the front door to your overall health, and sometimes, the smell emanating from that doorway can offer clues about what's happening deeper inside.

### Beyond Mints and Mouthwash: Long-Term Solutions

While mints and mouthwash can provide temporary relief, they don't address the root cause of the problem. For lasting fresh breath, you need to address any underlying gut imbalances and adopt healthy lifestyle habits. It's like patching a leaky roof – you might temporarily stop the dripping, but unless you fix the underlying structural issue, the problem will persist.

Conclusion
----------

So, does bad breath come from the gut? While not the sole culprit, the gut undeniably plays a role in some cases. A healthy gut contributes to a healthy mouth, and vice versa. By addressing any underlying gut imbalances and maintaining good oral hygiene, you can achieve long-lasting fresh breath and boost your overall well-being. Don't just mask the problem, address the source. After all, wouldn't you rather have genuinely fresh breath than just a minty facade?

Maryland has crabs generally but that’s definitely not Frederick’s thing. It’s definitely not coffee or tea. I’m leaning towards there not being a best in class high quality thing that frederick has to offer, which is a bummer because those things always make great Christmas gifts!

 The olive downtown is pretty good, but not exceptional. Bake house is the best in frederick but definitely not best in Maryland.

Any ideas? What’s the best tangible item frederick has to offer that’s the best in the state at least?",4,1734994718.0,frederickmd,19,0.7,False

1hkzlez,https://www.reddit.com/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/1hkzlez/is_it_too_soon_dec_23_to_make_my_christmas/,Is it too soon (Dec 23) to make my Christmas dessert if I'm going to freeze it? And will my cookies get soggy? (Long),"So my Christmas dessert is kind of a tiramisu cheesecake. I'm using a no-bake cheesecake mix, and instead of graham cracker crumbs, I'm layering in coffee dipped nilla wafers but I'm worried they're going to get too soggy even in the freezer. I'd make it today and have it in the freezer ASAP.

So the idea is I'm going to do the cheesecake, nilla wafers, chocolate syrup, more cheesecake, nilla wafers, and then maybe do another layer of the three. Then flip it out (I'm doing it upside down in a loaf pan with Saran wrap and then flipping it out onto the serving tray), and top with additional chocolate syrup on Christmas.

I'm thinking about freezing it between layers so that the coffee freezes and doesn't fully soak into the nilla wafers, although I'm not soaking them, I'm just dipping them really quickly. Thoughts? 😅",0,1734994260.0,cookingforbeginners,0,0.25,False
1hkzlam,https://www.reddit.com/r/nespresso/comments/1hkzlam/so_likewhy_didnt_nespresso_just_take_their_ol_pod/,So like....why didn't Nespresso just take their OL pod and make it bigger if they wanted another capsule system instead of the VL?,"One of the chief complaints is that there's only like 5-6g of coffee in there, and a lot of people gotta use 2 pods. Which personally I don't mind, but I'm talking from a business perspective, why they didn't just make the ""OL but bigger"" instead of creating the VL.

As we know the VL doesn't use pressure (and is more akin to a fancy Keurig) so if you want ""more"" coffee you have to sacrifice the (in my opinion) better taste you get from OL.

This would've truly, I think, been an upgrade that a lot of people would've went for. And then all the ""omg its not real espresso cuz of the ratio"" people would've been silenced, and also the people who just want a ""regular"" sized cup of coffee would be happy too.

This is something I don't get. Instead they create the Vertuo which has some weird spinning gimmick, and doesn't have the same flavor profile as the original line since its not brewed under pressure.

Oddly enough I see L'or pretty much did what I just said (they took the nespresso pod and made it bigger and called it a 'coffee size pod') but I don't trust L'or to make a machine or pod with the same quality as Nespresso. Nespresso OL machines just keep running and running. L'or machines I don't think so much. Seems like a missed opportunity for Nespresso to make more money.",0,1734994250.0,nespresso,17,0.27,False
