It seems meant to be a story set in the same hyper hyper-toxic ☣️ community Mary and her boyfriend grew up in. With every song being a true love 💗 duet.

For unknown reasons, the town becomes haunted grounds.

In dreams/Unconscious writing, ghosts tend to have their spirit body quickly disintegrate. The haunted grounds heals them, allowing them to persist indefinitely.

=======

The lovers are brothers who grew up in an abusive household. They presumably became incestuous, due to becoming unhinged, due to the abuse.

Considering their upbringing, the 2 are actually pretty well adjusted. They get back to sanity was the abuse stops.

They both try and get non-incestuous relationships. However, they already fell in true love 💗. So they are drawn to each other like magnets.

They eventually end up getting back together.

=======

* 1 of the brothers murders their mother. Let's call him X.
* Let's call the other brother Y.

This is just before X is leaving on a flight to go to university 🎓.

X poisons ☠️ the mother. The opportunity for him is likely connected to the events leading to the town becoming haunted grounds.

Likely a supernatural entity was sympathetic and gave X untraceable poison.

Likely the same entity was responsible for killing their father. Though was unsure if they wanted their mother dead as well.

This was likely to test 🧪 the haunted grounds. Finding a victim they felt no guilt over killing.

Likely seeing if the haunted grounds were strong enough. Whether the stress of finding out your son murdered you and is in a sexual relationship with your other son is enough to disintegrate their mother's ghost.

If it is strong enough, the supernatural entity will presumably disintegrate the mother's ghost themselves.

X and Y previously discussed killing their mother, though Y was shocked that X actually did it. So passes out, when X tries to seduce him after killing their mother.

So X has to sleep alone on that night. Unlike how usually horny they are for each other when they are free of watchful eyes.

X misses his flight to stay with Y and make sure he is ok. Also, he needs to deal with the body of their mother.

The lovers presumably had rich parents. Even if they were abusive.

Plus, the same supernatural entity from earlier likely helped them with finances after their mother died. Likely taking the form of a male relative and using the cover story of wanting to have incestuous relations with the 2 as well. To explain why they were helping.

=======

X, Y, and presumably the supernatural entity who helped them have to deal with the mother's body.

They have to first undress her. She was wearing a blue dress.

They throw the dress into the ocean/a lake to get rid of it. Presumably after cutting it to ribbons. Since it would be suspicious the last clothes she had were still in the house.

X gets carried away dismembering their mother's body out of rage. Getting blood 🩸 on snow ❄️ from it splashing from the force of the hits.

=======

X goes to fly to uni.

X and Y have sex every time X is back home for the holidays.

They don't explicitly say they forgive each other for their reactions when X murdered their mother. Though they warm back into a loving relationship, mostly through sex.

Due to the first fast forward in Is it Over Now?, the lovers presumably make up pretty quickly. Presumably having sex when Y wakes up and every day until X goes to uni.

=======

X has an integrated master's degree. This is because it takes 4 years.

There are 3 years skipped in Is it Over Now? 300 is a thematic reference to the number of days in a year rounding to 300.

Then X goes to uni again till the next holidays in I Wish You Would. This means his course needs to be longer than 3 years.

And 4 years for the happy ending to be within the timeframe of I Wish You Would. I.e. there not to be a flash forward or another song for it instead.

=======

3 years after the mother's death, X is at home.

X calls Y.

Y cuts the call to investigate something. Y ends up mortally wounded.

X goes to him and tries to get him healed. They kiss and confess their love for each other openly, rather than covered by mock aggression like they usually do.

Y ends up dying from his wounds.

They reflect on how they never expected to have a last kiss. And to end up a lovey dovey couple, rather than mock aggressive with each other.

=======

X leaves to uni.

This is soon after Y dies. Presumably because he does not want to raise suspicion of their relationship being incestuous by showing how hard he takes it.

This upsets Y. Not because he holds it against X, but Y cannot confess his love to X if X is not in the haunted grounds.

X goes back home for the next holidays.

X and Y reunite. X is able to see and hear Y in ghost form.

They confess their love again. They presumably have psychic sex with a shared dream.

Happy 😆 ending.

=======

The story of this couple seems intended to make fun of the true love 💗 couple from Tim McGraw/Back to December/Mary's Song (Oh My My My)/Breathe/The Way I Loved You.

That these 2 somehow manage to have their act together more than them despite the:

* incest
* murder
* abusive household
* mental health problems from abusive household
* constantly openly insulting each other
* being mock aggressive with each other
* Being drug addicts. They suspect an arche-dream like afterlife; the arche-dream is consistently the default afterlife of dream, including drug visions. Also, why X can hear Y, since Y's information is not paradigm shifting.

They don't generate problems out of nowhere for themselves. And they actually manage to solve their problems before Y dies. Fixing their relationship.

Unlike Mary and her boyfriend.

=======

I like to think 1 of the brothers or Y's killer is the Mary's boyfriend from The Way I Loved You.

It would fit a message of love without a reason never being real.

 

# Is It Over?

 

**X**

 

Once the flight had flown (uh-huh)

 

**Y**

 

With the wilt of the rose (uh-huh)

 

**X**

 

I slept all alone (uh-huh)

 

**Y**

 

You still wouldn't go

 

**Unison**

\[the waiters will not suspect they are actually in an incestuous relationship, rather than single\]

 

Let's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later

I see your profile and your smile on unsuspecting waiters

 

**Unison**

 

I dream of your mouth before it called me a lying traitor

I search in every maiden's bed for something greater

 

**Unison**

 

Baby, was it over

When she laid dead on our couch?

Was it over when we unbuttoned her blouse?

 

**X**

 

""Come here, "" I whispered in your ear

 

**Y**

 

In my dream as I passed out, baby

 

**Unison**

 

Was it over then?

And is it over now?

 

**Y**

 

When you lost control (uh-huh)

 

**X**

 

Red blood, white snow (uh-huh)

 

**Y**

 

Blue dress on a boat (uh-huh)

 

**X**

 

My new girl is her clone

 

**Unison**

\[Y complains about X openly having many girlfriend\]

\[X complains about Y using the money openly, drawing suspicion\]

 

And did you think I didn't see you?

There were flashing lights

At least I had the decency

To keep my nights out of sight

 

**Unison**

\[emphasis on rumors for Y; on hips and thighs for X\]

 

Only rumors 'bout my hips and thighs

And my whispered sighs

 

**Unison**

 

Oh, Lord, I think about

Jumping off of very tall somethings

Just to see you come running

And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no

 

**Unison**

\[(no) in the single version a hint to change the lyric\]

 

Let's fast forward to three hundred awkward hook ups later

If he's got blue eyes, I will surmise that you probably fucked him later

 

**Unison**

 

You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor

We search in every model's bed for something greater

 

**Unison**

 

Baby, was it over

When we went down on our couch?

Was it over when no one found out?

 

**Y**

 

""Come here, "" I whispered in your ear

 

**X**

 

In my dream as I passed out, baby

 

**Unison**

 

Was it over then?

And is it over now?

 

**Unison**

 

Uh-huh

Uh-huh

 

**Unison**

 

Think I didn't see him?

There were flashing lights

 

**Y**

 

At least we had the decency

To keep our nights out of sight

Only rumors 'bout our hips and thighs

Oh, Lord, I think about

Jumping off of very tall somethings

Just to see you come running (running)

And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no

 

**Unison**

\[they don't explicitly say ""I love you"" to each other until Last Kiss\]

 

Let's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later

(Flashing lights) I was hoping you'd be there

And say the one thing (oh, Lord)

I've been wanting (oh, Lord)

But no

 

# Last Kiss

 

**Unison**

\[they will not tell most people, due to the incest\]

 

I still remember the look on your face

Lit through the darkness at 1:58

The words that you whispered for just us to know

You told me you loved me

So why did you go away?

 

**Unison**

 

Away

 

**Unison**

 

I do recall now the smell of the rain

 

**Y**

\[Y picks up X from the airport\]

 

Fresh on the pavement

 

**X**

 

I ran off the plane

 

**Unison**

 

That July ninth, the beat of your heart

It jumps through your shirt

I can still feel your arms

 

**X**

\[their clothes easily fit each other as they are both male ♂️ and have similar builds, especially since they are related\]

 

But now I'll go

Sit on the floor wearing your clothes

  
**Y**

 



All that I know is I don't know

How to be something you miss

 

**Unison**

\[always thought they would always have a sexual relationship\]

 

I never thought we'd have a last kiss

 

**Unison**

\[double entendre for being separated by death and being overtly loving, rather than mock aggressive\]

 

Never imagined we'd end like this

 

**Unison**

 

Your name, forever the name on my lips

 

**Y**

 

I do remember the swing of your step

The life of the party, you're showing off again

And I'd roll my eyes and then you'd pull me in

I'm not much for dancing, but for you, I did

 

**X**

 

Because I love your handshake, just like our father's

I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets

How you'd kiss me when I was in the middle of saying something

There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions

 

**X**

 

And I'll go

Sit on the floor wearing your clothes

 

 **Y**

 

All that I know is I don't know

How to be something you miss

 

**Unison**

 

I never thought we'd have a last kiss

 

Never imagined we'd end like this

 

Your name, forever the name on my lips

 

**Unison**

 

O-ooh-ooh

 

**X**

 

So I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep

 

**Y**

 

And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe

 

**Unison**

\[Y talks to the other ghosts\]

 

And I'll keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are

Hope it's nice where you are

 

**Unison**

 

And I hope the sun shines and it's a beautiful day

And something reminds you you wish you had stayed

You can plan for a change in the weather and time

But I never planned on you changing your mind

 

**X**

 

And I'll go

Sit on the floor wearing your clothes

 

 **Y**

 

All that I know is I don't know

How to be something you miss 

 

 

**Unison**

 

I never thought we'd have a last kiss

 



Never imagined we'd end like this

 



Your name, forever the name on my lips

 

**Unison**

 

Just like our last kiss

Forever the name on my lips

Forever the name on my lips

Just like our last

 

# I Wish You Would

 

This song seems heavily censored to not give away the lovers are incestuous. It is probably intended to have more varied lyrics, instead of so much repetition.

 

**X**

 

It's 2 A.M. in my car

Windows down, I pass my street

The memories start

 

**Unison**

 

You say it's in the past

And drive straight ahead

You think I'm gonna hate you now

 

**Unison**

 

'Cause you still don't know what I never said

I wish you would come back

# Ending Notes

 

With a murderer on the loose in the town, it seems possible Mary did not commit suicide. Her murder was just staged to convincingly look like one.

X and Y presumably help catch the murderer, since they remember what he looks like.

===========

Since X and Y seem like they are friends with a supernatural entity, it would be likely Y gains a corporeal body again with their help.

So the brothers can have corporeal sex again. Ironically with their bodies not being related anymore.

Thus, they can openly be a couple. With the public not knowing they used to be brothers.

And they can move outside the haunted grounds.",1,1730335668.0,u_Sarkhana,0,1.0,False
1gg29m5,https://www.reddit.com/r/RedDeer/comments/1gg29m5/worried_about_emily/,Worried about Emily ,"Emily lives in Mountview, not too far away from the Horton water Spheroid and I am worried for her safety. She's been acting weird lately. 

Full story - 

Emily wandered into Dose Coffee Riverfront on a rainy night, burdened by questions about life and death, only to find herself inexplicably drawn to a man named Emanuel sitting alone in a dim corner. His voice was calm yet haunting as he spoke of the unknown and whispered, “Meet me tomorrow at the Cronquist House for tea. I need to show you something.”

Curiosity got the best of her, and the next day, she found herself at the historic Cronquist House, where a table was mysteriously set for two. As she waited, she grew uneasy—the house felt unusually silent, as if the walls themselves were holding their breath. Just then, a lady entered in a house. “Looking for Emanuel?” she asked quietly.

Emily nodded, and the lady's expression darkened. “Emanuel Cronquist? He’s been gone for over a century. They say he appears to people… right before they disappear.” Emily’s heart pounded as she looked down at her teacup, the delicate porcelain etched with a chilling message she hadn’t seen before: “Welcome home.”

1gg291l,https://www.reddit.com/r/SameGrassButGreener/comments/1gg291l/25_f_looking_for_new_city/,25 F looking for new city ,"Might be a long shot but figured I'd post looking for ideas... I am a 25 year old female looking to move to a small-ish mountain town. To preface, I lived in Flagstaff, Arizona for seven years and absolutely LOVE it. It is my ideal town in pretty much all ways (minus the job market lacking). I would move back in a heartbeat, but I have lived in AZ my whole life and am trying to expand my horizon and not just stick with what is comfortable. There's gotta be more out there, right? 

So... I'm looking to move to a ""mountain town"" similar to Flagstaff. It doesn't NEED to be a mountain town, but I like that kind of ""vibe"" for lack of better description. Things important to me... seasons, for one thing. I love having all four seasons, and LOVE winter. I look forward to the cold and snow. I am also looking for somewhere with a primarily youngish demographic. Doesn't need to be all college kids by any means, but I loved that Flag had a nice mix of college kids, young professionals, families, etc. As mentioned, I am 25 so post grad but still semi young. I also am a lesbian, so LGBTQ friendly is pretty important to me.

I also work for Trader Joe's currently and have a pretty good set up with them, so looking for a city that has a TJ's so I can transfer. I do know this makes my options a little more limited.

Less important things but still want to mention- I love a good local brewery/ bar scene. Same with coffee shops. I don't care so much about restaurants- I'm not much of a foodie but that could be a plus when family comes to visit. They do love to eat. 

I also boulder and would love a town with an indoor bouldering gyms so I could climb year round (when winter doesn't permit for outdoor). I am also big into hiking, snowboarding, biking and most all outdoor recreation but I feel that is pretty much a given when looking to move to a mountain town. 

Let me know any ideas please! Cost of living isn't too big of a deal to me, which I know I am incredibly privileged in saying. As stated, I have a good gig with Trader Joe's and also work remotely as a private graphic designer for a company that pays me quite well, so I am pretty comfortable and only have myself and my dog to take care of. Also, I prefer living with roommates anyway and plan to find people to live with no matter where I move. I hate living alone lol, so that cuts housing costs anyway. 

Lastly, some places I had briefly looked at-

Asheville, NC

Salt Lake City, UT 

Fort Collins, CO 

Boise, Idaho 

Bellingham, WA 

Portland, ME

I recently completed jury duty here in Melbourne, and I thought I'd share my experience, as some of my questions weren't easily answered online. Plus, a few things seem to have changed since previous posts.

**The Jury Duty Summons**:

I received my summons in August, went to the Juries VIC portal, and accepted. After filling out my details, I was summoned to appear in early October.

**First Day of Jury Duty**:

I arrived at 8:30 AM and brought my Steam Deck to pass the time. The County Court’s waiting area is spacious and comfortable, with complimentary Arnotts cookies, tea, coffee, and a few vending machines with reasonably priced snacks. There’s even a pool table, though I didn’t see anyone use it.

At 10:30 AM, we were called to the main room, and jury numbers were read aloud. My number was called, and I joined a group of about 30 jurors who were led into a courtroom for empanelment.

**Empanelment Process**:

In the courtroom, we sat in the public section as the judge read out the case details. It was a criminal case, so the judge listed the charge, names of the accused, alleged victim, witnesses, and legal teams. Juror numbers were called, and each of us said either “Excuse” or “Present.” If you knew anyone involved in the case, you’d be excused. You could also request an excuse if you felt you couldn’t be unbiased. If so, you wrote down your reason, which was passed to the judge for consideration. Several jurors were excused this way.

Then, jurors were called to the back, one by one, and walked past the accused toward the jury box. During this, the accused could challenge up to three jurors without giving a reason. I was chosen without a challenge.

Once all 12 jurors were selected, the remaining jurors were dismissed, and the trial began with opening statements from the prosecution and defence. We were then dismissed for the day.

**The Jury Room**:

This room, located behind the courtroom, is where the jury gathers throughout the trial. It’s accessible from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM, and judge associates keep it stocked with snacks, tea, and coffee. There’s also a fridge, microwave, and hot and cold water. While in this room, you’re allowed to use your phone and other devices. We often waited there while the judge handled procedural matters with the legal teams, which sometimes took 10–20 minutes.

**The Jury**:

This part is always interesting since you don’t know who you’ll be working with. Our jury was mainly professionals aged from their mid-20s to mid-40s, plus a retiree who was a joy to speak with. We got along well, sharing personal stories and getting to know each other. After two days, we nominated a foreperson who’d served twice before and was skilled at guiding conversations. Everyone was respectful, and there were no strong personalities or wild theories. It made for a positive atmosphere.

**Deliberations**:

Once all testimony and evidence is given, you are sent back to deliberate to reach a verdict. This will always be the most emotional and heated time so having someone to help guide it, as our foreman did, really made a difference. We were back late most days and had to take an oath at the end of the day to state that we would not discuss it outside of the court room.

**The Final Day**:

After delivering our verdict, we had a final lunch and then debriefed at a nearby pub. We all got along so well that we started a WhatsApp group to stay in touch.

**Lunch**:

Lunch arrangements were a bit unclear at first. You need to bring your own lunch each day or buy it nearby, as meals aren’t provided, except during final deliberations when you can’t leave the room.

During deliberations, you are provided sandwiches and drinks. The sandwiches were actually quite good, and I quite enjoyed them. You can bring in food from home though if that is not up to your standard.

**Pay**:

Jurors are paid $40 per day for the first six days, including your first day even if you’re dismissed. After six days, it increases to $80 per day, paid every Thursday. I served for three weeks, and my work didn’t require reimbursement, which helped cover travel costs.

**My Overall Opinion**:

I’m big on civic duty, and this was my first jury duty experience. I enjoyed it and felt the importance of the process. If you get the chance to serve, I recommend doing it—it’s one of the rare times your opinion truly matters beyond yourself. Would I do it again? Absolutely. While I’m automatically excluded for three years, I might remove myself from the exclusion in a few months. Whether or not I’m ever called up again, I’d be glad to use this experience to help guide another jury.

I’ll update this post if I think of more, and feel free to ask any questions!",4,1730335211.0,melbourne,2,0.83,False

1gg1swu,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1gg1swu/help/,help,"I'm not sure this will work.

No one has seen a computer down here in a very long time, and we aren't sure the internet is really connected. It feels like a trick. Probably is. Maybe we will suffer for it, but we've decided it's worth it just in case this really gets on the internet, and maybe someone comes to help. If anyone can help.

If it *is* a trick, and you're reading this, whoever you are, you can go to hell.

All others, please read on. Please send the police to Astonberry, North Carolina, to Coombs, Kansas, to Caroline, Maine, and to anywhere else you might know where a person's gone missing and it just doesn't feel right. it isn't right.

My name is Helen Paris and I am from Astonberry. In December of 2023, I went to a dentist's appointment and never came back. The lady at the front desk directed me to the basement, and I went through a door that looked strange to me, looked like something I shouldn't go through, but I did, and now I'm here. If ever there was a warning to trust your gut, *I* am it.

Beyond the door was a labyrinth the likes of which I've only ever read about in Greek myths, except there is no minotaur (yet), and it's all purple. Yeah, purple. Floor to ceiling lavender tile, which some of the veterans here joke is the worst part, but it isn't. The worst part is the smell. 

Needless to say, back in 2023, I knew my dentist wasn't in the purple hellscape I'd wandered into, but when I tried to go back through the door I came through, it was locked. I walked for twenty or so minutes trying to find another exit, or a security guard, or really any other living thing, but the halls just kept winding and splitting and turning until I was thoroughly lost. The deeper I walked, the stronger the smell grew. The smell of dead leaves, like when you're outside on a crisp evening in the middle of fall. That burnt smell. I got the opposite of used to it- it was fine at first, even pleasant and normal, but now it only smells like dread.

I tried to call, but my phone had no signal. On Google Maps, it told me I was in Nairobi, then Finland, then Taiwan, then New York. In a matter of minutes, it died on me completely. That's when I got really afraid.

I decided to keep going right. I'm not sure why- I just thought if I chose a direction and stuck with it, maybe I'd get somewhere. I'm not sure how long it was until I got to the pool. You know the kind of warm, humid indoor pool your high school may have had? Where the chlorine is so thick in the air it makes your eyes burn? That was this room. I stopped in the doorway, my feet slipping on the water and my hair coming loose and frizzy in the humidity, and stared. At least, I thought, here was a sign of civilization.

But it was filthy. Looked like it hadn't been cleaned in years, and under the layer of grey scum that ran over the top, there were broad green leaves as wide as my forearm and bits of branches and bark, though not a single plant decorated the space. In fact, there was nothing in the room aside from the pool at all except for a line of yellow life-jackets propped perfectly against the left wall, and an enormous X smeared on the tiles at the far end in the same shade of sunflower yellow.

I crept a few, careful steps forward and bent to examine one of the leaves. As soon as my fingers broke the surface of the water, however, I saw a ripple just a few feet down and I scrambled away. The smell of dead foliage grew stronger. Something long and rough and black rose up from the depths, and the scream would have died in my throat along with the rest of me if I hadn't felt a hand clamp around my shoulder just then.

I yelled out in terror, but he was unmoved. He clamped his hand over my mouth and dragged me back as a massive, jet-black crocodile crawled out of the pool and hissed at me, exposing three or four rows of yellowing teeth. It must have been twenty feet long. I passed out, and Jacob carried me the rest of the way.

When I woke up, I was in what looked like a particularly disheveled office floor. I and a few others I did not recognize were sprawled out on air mattresses between rows of grey desks, and when I poked my head up, I saw the desks stretch out for thirty or forty more rows both in front of and behind me. Classical music droned out of the intercoms overhead, and all across the floor, loose papers and crumpled up sticky notes were scattered like a strange kind of carpet. Not one of the casually chatting people around me made any move to pick them up; if a paper got in the way, they simply slid it to the side or picked it up in an absent sort of way, maybe folded a corner and mouthed the words written on them, then tossed them aside.

What was written on them? 

Names. Thousands of names and dates and places. 

Evan Dollier, Chestnut Hill, Mass, 2014. 

Kayla Smith, San Francisco, 2009. 

Marina Randall, Chicago, 1996.

Prayers. 'Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I shall fear no evil, for thou art with me.' That was a common one.

Notes to loved ones. 'Mom, if you ever read this, I love you. I'm sorry. - Drew'

Some were just ramblings, like an open diary. 'I should have asked her to marry me when I had the chance.' 

But most had the same two words on them: help us.

I soon learned that everyone had a similar story as I did: they were going somewhere in an office building, searching for something mundane, when they got lead astray and wound up walking through an ominous door that didn't let them back out. They all wandered the lavender maze, sometimes for hours, until the lucky ones found this place, the office, or someone who could take them there. If they were *unlucky,* they found an 'X' place first. The pool. The barber shop. The theater. Usually, these unfortunate souls were then rescued by someone appointed to keep guard near these nightmare places for just that purpose, but sometimes it was their screams that alerted the others that a newcomer had arrived. Sometimes, it was too late to save them.

""This is a place that doesn't make much sense,"" Jacob told me on the first day. ""I'm sorry I can't give you a better explanation. There are only two things we know for sure: the office is safe, and it isn't good to be caught out in the halls or anywhere outside at midnight.""

Turns out, midnight is more of a concept than a time. The clocks infrequently scattered on the walls of the office and the halls were erratic. Sometimes they all began to move backwards; sometimes they jumped forward by several hours. Other times, they spun and spun like a wheel of fortune for random stretches until settling on a time that could be hours before or after the one it read originally. If it landed on midnight, it could stay there for minutes or for days, and terrible things always happen at midnight.

Gerrie, who was a physicist or something on the outside, built an hour glass out of empty coffee pots set to fill up every four hours, and this is how we keep the time. It's someone's job every day, in eight hour shifts. 'Midnight' comes whenever it chooses during these stretches- sometimes not for several days. Sometimes three times in one day. Gerrie is also working on an alarm system to go off when the clocks hit midnight, but every time she sets the device up on the clock, the intercoms start blasting a horrible, shrill noise that makes our ears bleed until she takes it off.

At midnight, the first thing that happens is the lights dim. It is a barely noticeable change, just enough for our eyes to have to adjust. 

Then, the intercom gradually goes quiet. All day and all night otherwise, it plays classical music non-stop. There is no pattern to the songs, but they always play. Except at midnight.

When it is completely silent, the whistling starts from outside the office. It is faint, and solo. Greensleeves. You know the song? That medieval tune they play at ren faires? It is always a single whistler, but no matter where we are in the halls or the office or the other rooms around the maze, we hear the same thing. If we are outside the office, however, the whistling will gradually get closer, and louder, and it will follow even when we run.

The smell gets stronger. If someone is caught outside, there may be screaming, then silence. We all huddle behind desks and cover our ears or pray or pretend to be asleep, until it is over. Nobody speaks.

Nobody knows who or what the Whistler is. There is no shortage of horrors in this place- the crocodiles in the pool, the man in the barbershop, the...*things* in the theater. This is different though; everyone is sure of that. The Whistler is somehow the key to it all, if there is a key and this isn't just hell.

Every day, a scouting party goes out with a map and tries to explore more of the labyrinth. It is getting harder the farther we go, because less and less people are willing to venture out to where they may not be able to make it back in time if the clock strikes midnight. Only a few of us go now, jotting down turns and passages on the bits of paper we've taped together to guide us, hoping to find a way out, or really anything.

There have been clues. Jacob, when he arrived two years ago, was headed to an indoor pool for lifeguard tryouts. Tom Dessek was going to a barber shop in 2014 when he got lost. Louise O'Malley, who I never got to meet, was supposedly trying to find a theater back in 1987. Three months after I arrived, on a scouting mission, we found a dentist's office with an empty chair and tray set out neatly with drills and scalpels.

This morning, we found the computer. It is the farthest we've ever been, and the clock on the screen says 11:38 so it could be midnight soon, or it could not, I don't know. There were a few normal apps on the bottom- Settings, Google, and Calendar.

In Settings, there were no options other than 'END' and 'MOTHER,' which we decided as a group were both unwise to select right now. 

In Calendar, every month was June, and the days were out of order and could range, from what we saw, as high as 209. 

So Google it was. We searched our names, found the missing posters and the articles. When we tried to access the contact information, the screen said 'ERROR' because we had no email. We commented some version of the story you are currently reading on many of the blogs, all of the Facebook pages, but we aren't sure they were actually uploaded. 

The room is empty other than the computer and the desk. As far as we know, no one who got lost here was ever searching for a computer, or an IT department, or a tech room. Strange because not everyone here has a connection to a room, but every room so far has had a connection to *someone.* Jacob says it might have been someone who never made it to the office, who died on their first day, or someone who died a long time ago. No way of knowing.

All this to say, please send help. Send it anywhere you can, for any reason that feels compelling to you. Trust your gut. Don't walk through strange doors. If you find yourself here, get to the office before midnight.",2,1730334337.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

There’s this former coworker of mine who I have had deep feelings for a year now. In my eyes he was the perfect guy and made me feel like no one else could. After I ended the job almost a year ago, I could never get rid of my feelings for him. All we did was hug and get along well, so I always thought he wants nothing from me. 
That’s when my heartbreak started, end of last year, when I left the job. I was crying like a baby. We had sporadically contact throughout this year until now. Every little message would brighten my day, week or month. Every day I thought about him, and even dreamt about him. I was going from high to a low almost every month. I was crying so much because of this man. Because everything he would text my hope would go up, that he maybe feel the same about me, but he didn’t.  I now know that.
Half a year ago he called me for the first time asking how I am. After that he never contacted me again. For the last 6 months again I was in deep sorrow. Almost no appetite, feeling depressed.. 

A week ago, I decided that this has to stop. I was brave and texted him if he wanted to get coffee with me sometime. He immediately agreed. 
For the last week I was the happiest I’ve been in all this year, just because I knew that I would see him again and hug him… all was so bright.

We met today. And I found he has a girlfriend now. 
I’m glad he mentioned it at very end pretty randomly actually. I immediately needed to get out of there. I felt my heart shatter into a million pieces for good.
I thought it was a date. How could I be so stupid.

We awkwardly said goodbye.

Now I’m left with this pit in my stomach. I can’t explain how worthless and stupid I feel for thinking someone like him could like me back. 

Since this has been in my head for a year now, it feels impossible to even think, I could get over this. I still felt this really strong pull towards him. I never had this with anyone. I fear that I was to late and let someone get away. 

I want him out of my life completely, even though he is still a good business contact of mine. I will probably delete his number. 

Also the worst thing: I don’t think he realized that I had a crush on him at all.

Does anyone have any advice? I’ve never experienced this kind of heartbreak before.

Anyway, when I first saw her I was immediately in love and I actually remember saying ""God please make this one happen, I hope she likes me"" because the first time I saw her she looked a lot older and I was physically attracted to her before even saying hi just like you would find someone attractive the first time before you knew them.



Anyway I went ahead and talked to her thinking she was at least 27-28 and we went out on a date (not exactly I invited her to a coffee) and the more we talked and time passed I learned two things:



1. She is the most honest, kindest, calmest person I have ever met. To this day I can not find a single thing I dislike, no even remotely. I can't explain in words how many great things she has and absolutely zero red flags. She was raised extremely right and I have never met anyone like her. She is externally and internally beautiful and I keep watching her pictures from the ones we took together just because her beauty makes my day better. All she wants to get married and have a family of her own which has been the single most important thing I too, wanted all my life.





2. In the time we took to talk know eachother and apart (it's a long distance relationship, I have travelled twice to my native country in the past 6 months and spent time for about a month in total) I have learned that I do love her, I value her but the thought of making love with her is not with me. It's strange because she is very beautiful but for some reason my mind has chosen to block all feelings of intimacy with her. The idea of having sex with her is like having sex with a relative or someone just too young to be in a relationship, like eating a fruit that isn't ripe, just unappealing. It just feels wrong and undesirable. I think this is because after initially I saw her the first and felt the physical attraction, then when we started talking I noticed that her thinking and mine were different. She didn't feel like a 25 anymore and felt like 15 so my desire for physical intimacy started dying and now I can tell I can't see her the same way. She didn't even seem like one of those annoying teens but someone too innocent, pure and vulnerable and the physical attraction I had towards her died. She became like someone I wanted good things to happen to her and not someone I wanted to even kiss. 



Btw she was raised strictly so she never had a bf and never even kissed. As I learned this I even started backing away because she seemed too young.



As I write this I seem to understand the answer to my question but at the same time how can I let go of a person as honest, kind, trustworthy, beautiful as her.



Anyway I don't know what to do. It seems like my mind is split on making a decision to choosing the best companion without necessarily being in love. It's a choice of: best woman Vs love





I feel so unlucky right now. The girl is so trustful I can tell you if someone I knew tomorrow told me he saw her cheating I would not believe him, because that's how trust worthy she is. But on the other hand I see her for someone too young to be in a relationship therefore I can not fall in love or have any desire for sexual intimacy.



Without digging deeper I told one of my relatives over lunch and other friend and they think I am nuts if I let her go away but I am afraid that is where I am heading.



Just sharing my thoughts to see if someone can make sense of this more than I do.

  
Just add one more detail, she is in love and does want to get married and I can see she is in love. But from my side that won't happen with what I feel right now. How can I marry someone I feel this way about?

Looking for a haunted friend for Halloween adventures 

Let’s haunt a pumpkin patch


I just want to feel something. I want something to write about. 

Dreamy pajamas and tasty coffee. Scary movies and soft puppies 

Sometimes I want to read the most miserable books and feel my heart sink to the floor

Would love to talk an adult about dumb things. Nostalgia, Americana, let’s time travel and time warp(the dance is cool too) and reminisce on places we only see in our dreams

Bare with me a moment things going nowhere 



troubled waters, these dogs are howling in the distance and my dogs are howling just in front of me and everyone’s afraid of the earthquakes we’ve been getting but it can’t be that bad can it?

I was here in 94 and and saw the freeways collapsed and the balconies smashed and the apartments sinking into the ground. 

California dreaming? I have the worst sleep. I take melatonin and I have the weirdest dreams. Always I’m in a bust station or a train station or moving though a casino like an ant on a sugar trail. 

Drunk as drunk on turpentine. 

But I found out Neruda is a piece of so maybe we don’t quote him tonight. 

My dog stepped on a bee and somehow they both lived. Well obviously rhe dog but I managed to get the bee to a hummingbird feeder and he drank up and then flew off. 

I’m afraid of those really blue nights I haven’t seen since I was sixteen coming home to an empty place and I’m outside waiting for that blue light to come but I don’t think it’s coming. 

Who needs coasts when you’re perfectly adrift?

What’s your favorite scary movie?

I want to be an urban legend. 
I want to be haunted. 

I want to live forever. 

My job. I make people feel pretty. And I make things that; with care, can last forever. 

Oh the lemon tree. The lemons are green still but so and when the pomegranates are out we’ll make pomegranate lemonade and listen to my favorite song; it’s called 


Hopelessly dreamy rainy day vibes with new socks and soft sheets and soft windows and soft sunshine. Wake up to turn out the lights. My fears are soft and so are my knees. These dreams have had their fun with me. 


I make art for a living. Dreamy sad moody nostalgic stuff for dreamy people with bad intentions. 



I want to feel my heart drop through my stomach. I want to feel something good or bad and I want something to write about. Let me turn you into literature and bad paintings. Let’s take Polaroids and hide them in library books. 

Collector of old books and Polaroid photos. Constant reader and dreamer. Following foxes down rabbit holes and making all the worst mistakes. 

I want to believe in ghosts but I’ve never seen proof of one. Someone said your hearts as big as your fist. 

Let’s be zombies. All braindead and ruled by instinct. 

I want to feel something. Tell me the sky is falling. Tell me the world is ending. 
Tell me something you can say today and never again. 

Come in from the rain and trade your wet socks for something new. 

I’ll read you old poems and tell you all about that time,
The one you dream about

Parents, unbeknownst to thy self, we killed by the same alien civilization that kidnapped you. Probing incident gone slightly awry, information long redacted. Growing up as the only human, but with other alien species also taken, you will be married to the daughter of the Reagent; ruler of 196.1 trillion species. Like many before you, you will be married into the family so when Earth is received by the Reagent, you will act as a royal liaison. You will never rule, your wife might. Family and friends will survive and be able to contact you. The universe is quite literally yours, how will you rule? Your children will be considered abominations, and will always be a secondclass citizen to your significant other.
2. **Hero of Legend.** You awake to a blackhole roughly .5m length, width... ... and depth? Not a true blackhole. For whatever reason you deem necessary, you reach into it. Gripping onto a pommel, you yank out a sword. Crimson purple, with red streaks that are almost veiny in perception, sword. The hilt is made of some off-base orange with only three wraps of Suchomimus leather. A basterd sword. Gripping the hilt, an image pops out in front of yourself. This is the Blade of Zgse-Nael. You may go any where, any place. No risk of dying, or getting suck in an impossible spot.\* You are immune to disease, you don't need to eat but can indulge. You'll speak every language and breath any atmosphere. The universe is your oyster but your mind cannot remember everything. You'll forget unless you remind yourself of events more than 500 years in the past. You can live in your own time.
3. **Sovereign Florida.** Your LLC just bought Florida from the U.S.A. government for 196.2 trillion dollars of daddy Dexter (this universe's Bezo). You legally own a state and become known as the first United Sovereign State. Congratulations. The state is quickly being eroded away and flooding, the entire population despises you and has a lynch flash mob ready to deploy. Also part of the deal is Massachusetts is included in the deal as being sold to Maine to reform the Commonwealth so Mass and Maine hate you and will send lobstermonster battalions in retaliation.
4. **Coffee with God.** As the name states, you get a coffee date with God. God of what? The creator of the simulation you are in. Some 19 year old in his parents basement made your universe in their version of a simulator. You enjoy a cup of coffee and discuss everything about his creation. You find out that he's indifferent to the people in the world he created. The creator is impressed you worked out the simulation, so in return when you ""reenter"" your world, you may have anything you want ever. You still live a life and die but money and health is a non-issue. No one will believe you. The creator also targets you to mess with in petty ways such as changing your engine oil to milk. Enough to be annoying but you have unlimited money, the creator never hurts you physically.

I have read up on [asexuality-handbook.com](http://asexuality-handbook.com) about those situations. It‘s the least I can do because I want to try to make this work. But at the same time I want to get this text out of my system. And maybe I am also looking for some understanding or reassurance or  whatever. I guess most of you here are ace and not allo so apologies if that kind of content isn‘t welcome here idk.

The title basically speaks for itself but if you want to hear my story, I will write it down here in long form.

I‘m a het-allosexual cis-male in my mid 20s. For the last 4 months or so I have been dating a wonderful cis-het woman in her late 20s. We got to know each other via friends and we vibed instantly. There just was something about our communication that clicked. The way our creative thoughts intermingled was something I had almost never experienced before. And when she told me she had feelings for me, I was incredibly happy.

The first weeks went by in a flash. Before we had sex for the first time, she told me that she hadn‘t made a lot of good experiences with sex before. I reassured her that we could take things slow and that I would be honored to help her in discovering what she liked. It seemed to work, we had sex once or twice a week, mostly initiated by her. I listened to her preferences and discoveries and she reassured me that she liked it. During that time she also told me that she had masturbated while thinking about me and that sexualized songs made her think of me. Naturally, I was flattered. She even bought some toys for herself besides the vibrator she already owned and fantasized with me about all the things we could try in bed. To me she seemed very enthusiastic. She even made plans to get an iud as extra protection to the condoms we were using.

Then after 6 weeks or so, we seemed to hit some kind of dry-spell. Of course we communicated about it. She told me that she didn‘t feel well emotionally and that this lowered her libido. Naturally, I respected that. Before we met she went to therapy for a year for depression, so I would never press her or disregard her mental health. She also reassured me that she would like to have more sex again once she felt better.

Hard skip to last night, she said she wanted to see me, so naturally I came over to her place. When I opened the door I saw her with tears in her eyes and she told me that she figured out that she is asexual. First thing I did was hug her, sit her down and drink some coffee she had made for the two of us. We talked for four hours or so. I‘ll try to sum up the conversation but I am a little blurry on the details. Apologies:

She said that she was sure that this is how she feels. She reassured me that she did enjoy the times we had sex so far just not in a sexual way but in a „kinda nice“ kind of way. I asked if that meant that she didn‘t want kids because previously she had told me that she did. She said that she still wanted to have children in the future. We talked a little about how we both saw sexuality as a whole. And of course I told her that I was confused since she seemed so enthusiastic about being sexual with me when our relationship began. To that she replied that she had been so extatic when our relationship began that it was part of her ecstasy.

We also talked about masturbation and how this tied in to bouth our sexualities. She does masturbate quite regularly. To her this is something she does simply to feel good. Something completely removed from sex. I explained that to me, I would always prefer sex over masturbation. That sex scratched an itch that masturbation couldn’t. She also told me that she feels this whole situation is unfair. That she would like to be sexually attracted to me but just is not able to. I replied to her that she wasn‘t any less valuable of a person or any less important to me because of her sexuality - which is true of course.

We talked a little longer, ate some dinner, cuddled a little and then I left. On the way home, I listened to music, cried and hugged my dog when I arrived.

Now to the part about how I feel about all of this. I am hurting. The last few hours I couldn‘t stop having my eyes tear up constantly.

In my previous relationship, my ex and I had a very similar libido, which felt great because sex would just come natural from cuddling or making out. But we didn’t match in character at all, which is why things didn’t work out. And at the beginning of my relationship with my current girlfriend, sexually, it felt just the same. I was happy because we seemed to match both on a level of character and on a level of sexuality. As I mentioned, I never had a relationship with whom I matched so perfectly on a character basis. Now this illusion of both aspects matching feels painful to me.

My girlfriend also said that she wouldn‘t rule out having sex in the future completely. In reply I offered her to not engage any sexual activity on my own initiative to not pressure her into it. But naturally I will at some point get an erection if we cuddle. Because I am sexually attracted to her. And I am afraid that I will get frustrated from this sooner or later without any kind of mechanism to vent this frustration other than talking. Of course, I can be sexual on my own. But as I said, masturbation is lacking for me compared to sex. I want to be intimate with my partner. That kind of intimacy is special for me. And now I will lose that maybe completely.

She said herself that this situation sucks. Naturally I won‘t ever demand of her that she have sex with me if she doesn‘t feel like it. At the same time this means that I have to surpress my sexuality in favor of her sexuality. At least that is the conclusion that this all seems to boild down to. So yea, I agree. It sucks. To be clear, she doesn‘t, of course. I don‘t like her any less because of it. I just didn‘t expect things to be so complicated all of a sudden.

Oh and since she is active on reddit: “Hi, in case you see this, I stand by what I said. That I want to give you time to explore your new identity and limits. That I don‘t like you any less because of this. And that I will try to work with this new kind of intimacy we will have from now on. I just needed to get all of those thoughts out of my head so I can talk to you in a structured manner. And yes, I also wanted to talk to some people who might have unique insight into this issue. And maybe find some solace in their repiles.“

It's been a few weeks since I've last been in touch, but by design, it's to not bombard you all with monotonous updates. Now, we've reached the stage of FPL Swiss where we start to figure out who can claim the Division titles, who can progress up their respective Tier, and who is staring down the barrel of Elimination.

As usual, all of this can still be found in the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fNW1MRZr7SMG84SAIdcY5tgbXJJ_hFdL8mUODUcjBUU/view?gid=1949867961#gid=1949867961).

**DIVISION 1**

u/EpiKnightz leads the way at the top of Tier 1 ahead of u/Vijaygarv, after they met back in GW7. A win for the leader will secure the Division title, but anything less, and the latter is waiting in the wings should they win themselves.

u/leosondek or u/Acrobatic_Employ_798 can still claim the title if the top two both lose, and given they face each other for that challenge, it'll be an interesting one to watch. If this scenario were to come about, that would put the loser in danger of being relegated.

u/soximent and u/StuartA19 are up against the top two and will need to get a win in order to remain in Division 1.

https://preview.redd.it/kyio340uyyxd1.png?width=1876&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6bd2ec0bfb604476fb79fcc56802661f44996ab

**DIVISION 2**

In Division 2, u/theseane is the favourite to take the title, and will only need a draw against u/_13characters to do so.

Should the latter take the win, they would need u/FanFareApp and u/Fooicus both to lose in order to win the title.

u/Justchillin1123 could really do with a win to avoid some H2H drama going against them, while u/JS794 is desperate for a win which should keep them up with favourable results elsewhere.

https://preview.redd.it/8s4a600uyyxd1.png?width=1874&format=png&auto=webp&s=e6cca8cc7d804cc64c7bd087f9eedd04d5dfc298

**DIVISION 3**

u/larsriedel leads u/Loosee123 at the top of Division 3. Anything less than a win for the former opens the door for others.

u/Keumars has the advantage should u/Loosee123 fail to grasp any opportunity but they need u/Name19389 to falter, otherwise this could all come down to a H2H battle.

Despite being bottom, u/StraightDifference75 technically has a better chance of survival given the current Overall Rank as there would likely be a 3-way H2H battle to survive relegation along with u/Dioulio and u/Keumars.

https://preview.redd.it/5ertg00uyyxd1.png?width=1878&format=png&auto=webp&s=cbfa808bbc2f4f7f979b44b2f1f70126ba3e0afb

**DIVISION 4**

This is an interesting one. All of the GW10 fixtures will each split a H2H tie-breaker (and likely create new ones). What this means is that we have u/Andrew643521 and u/JonnyTic facing off for the title.

If the latter loses, they will likely fall out of the promotion spots., depending on who wins between u/lolAdvantage and u/Zakedawn.

The loser of that matchup will be threatened with relegation along with one of u/Early_Damage and u/VillagerCorTree3.

https://preview.redd.it/5h6y900uyyxd1.png?width=1878&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb1f6be58c6f8f84b9581d1ade86194980cf06d4

**DIVISION 5**

Once again, it the top two who go H2H for the title in Division 5 with u/rdtalks holding the advantage. As long as they don't lose to u/ZAK5UMA, the title is theirs.

It doesn't look like anyone else has a chance to take the title, but the second promotion spot is still available, and would be very much desired given the bottom two are not just relegated, but are Eliminated completely from the FPL Swiss League

u/RealOronian and u/skotos2phos are in good stead to survive, while u/1ntrepid_ must win to survive, and even then it's not a guarantee. If u/Separate_Ad2919 were to also win, or even draw, that would go a long way to their own survival efforts.

https://preview.redd.it/xsjc500uyyxd1.png?width=1876&format=png&auto=webp&s=d040582365b4f4d571da0f954c256f879e130e1c

**DIVISION 6**

At the bottom of Tier 1, it's all about promotion for survival. If anyone this far down is to claim the overall title of FPL Swiss Champion in May, they will have to perform a feat not yet seen and earn themselves continuous promotions all the way through the season.

u/utham12 is a strong favourite to survive having already secured wins against other challengers, and a draw will be enough to seal the deal.

u/DukeManBearPig currently leads the H2H tie-breaker among the next four in the table, as they aim to claim the next promotion spot along with u/ThePersiflager, u/Topacali and u/CrazyFrogSY3.

By my calculations, u/thebrazenkaizen is Eliminated, as they can only match a record of 2x Wins, but a pair of those contenders face each other, meaning one of them will at least have a better record come the end of GW10. Even a H2H win over u/DukeManBearPig would only see them reach a height of 3rd in the table.

**DIVISION 1**

As it stands, it's the GW6 fixtures that separate the H2H tie-breakers. u/Long-Seaworthiness50 and u/QuantumParadox_27 are holding strong at the top of Tier 2. The latter is hoping for a slip-up elsewhere if they are to claim the opening title.

u/NoobyDoobyDoooo and u/CardozoSmash are waiting in the wings should both leaders lose, and it could well come down to Overall Rank that decides it all.

u/DiamondPalkia and u/Distinct_Pick6261 are both in trouble at the bottom, but it's not over yet for either, although the latter's only win so far is against the Division leader, whom they cannot catch.

https://preview.redd.it/vk6t101s8zxd1.png?width=1908&format=png&auto=webp&s=06fcaef4e0ea6b846138011b09fe65b1360b673d

**DIVISION 2**

u/sparrowhawk73 is our first guaranteed Division winner having progressed through Stage 1 with a 100% record under their belt.

u/FPLExpert is in a very strong position to earn promotion also.

u/pa_ra_dox and u/NielsRandomShirt both have an outside chance but need results to go their way.

Meanwhile, at the bottom, u/DrainMember1312 is in a must-win scenario, while u/rocknil is unfortunately guaranteed to be relegated down to Division 3.

https://preview.redd.it/dzkiiz0s8zxd1.png?width=1906&format=png&auto=webp&s=bcc7648723ac418a82b79a61147c5538b341b532

**DIVISION 3**

Division 3 also gives us a tight battle at the top, with anyone of five managers seeking promotion. We could well have a 5-way H2H conundrum to figure out, but u/Vegetable_Design8330 is the current favourite to take the title, as is veteran u/wo27 for promotion.

u/coolBballer and u/henkkaasd_ can both put their hat in the ring with a win each, while u/DoubleDeez21 aims to come from the depths of relegation to potentially earn promotion.

Unfortunately for u/Existing_Succotash95, relegation is confirmed after 4x Losses so far.

https://preview.redd.it/v8w8qy0s8zxd1.png?width=1908&format=png&auto=webp&s=7eeb900cefd6c0aacca85c23a8d79ee74c5735e4

**DIVISION 4**

u/FinnMundy7 is the clear leader and just needs to avoid defeat in GW10 and they are promoted as Division winner.

u/LiteratureCurious42 is staking a strong claim to join them in Division 3 with some favourable H2H wins so far.

u/sikingthegreat1 and u/bb53040 are both vying for that next promotion spot also, but relegation may be closer than they would be hoping for.

u/FaustRPeggi is in the red zone only by nature of H2H losses, but that could be irrelevant if they win and throw it all up in the air.

The only win so far for u/Significant_Bad4014 is against the u/LiteratureCurious42 in 2nd place, and they're also up against u/FinnMundy7 in GW10, making it very unlikely for promotion to be the end result, but a crucial win could be enough to save them from relegation if other results go their way.

https://preview.redd.it/ewd9dz0s8zxd1.png?width=1906&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae6534a6c3b8a1722cfa9ee1e3ad91d570fc293b

**DIVISION 5**

It's a tale-as-old-as-time scenario in Division 5, with two managers in pole position to survive.

u/IVIorgz holds the advantage over u/AugmentedMrHippo at the top.

u/newfountain22 and u/WEAluka play against each other with the victor hoping for a couple of slip-ups above them.

u/MemeWorksPictures also holds a crucial advantage over u/PhzyLicka should they both win and seek to avoid Elimination.

https://preview.redd.it/fusb801s8zxd1.png?width=1908&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc819e31f7a463ed10b968b798e359d918c6b769

**DIVISION 6**

Of the two Survival places available at the top of Division 6, there are three manager on equal standing, and u/BiLLer_17 will more than likely claim one of them with an already superior H2H record.

It gets exciting when we look just below the top spot as u/adstomko and u/soulblast300 face off against one another for the remaining place.

u/immchuckbass could provide an upset by beating u/BiLLer_17 in GW10, but a wider field of H2H battles would come into play for that to result in Promotion and Survival.

u/ShitActor and u/IzaYoke are both resigned to Elimination already, with the latter on 4x Losses at the bottom.

https://preview.redd.it/jtysuz0s8zxd1.png?width=1906&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc97e53f41b0ceba549e4fd5367151a6776e8d46

**DIVISION 1**

We have our first guaranteed Tier winner with u/pauld95 winning all four opening fixtures.

As for the rest, it's simply now a matter of avoiding relegation. Fortunately, for u/ShadowGallConcierge, u/Just7Callum and u/thepalegreenpants, only one of them may go down.

u/Mundanewisdom99 and u/Gilez_89, who both occupy the bottom two, play against each other. If it ends in a draw, both go down. If either wins, then a loser from the other matches will be at serious risk of relegation.

**DIVISION 2**

u/0ng0Gabl0g1an leads u/eglantinel at the top of Division 2 as both chase promotion to the top of Tier 3.

u/Gloomy-Strawberry808 is close behind, and a win would put them right in the hunt.

Elsewhere, it's another case of avoiding relegation, as none of u/the_Vegetabull, u/WaningCynicism or u/GamamJ44 can catch those already in the promotion spots. Crucially, a draw between the two former managers could be enough to secure either one of them a place in Division 2.

**DIVISION 3**

u/bubreadsreddit leads u/docvampirina at the top and favourites for promotion. All they need is a draw each.

u/This_is_so_not_right and u/DasHotShot are next in line, waiting for a chance should they snatch a win in GW10 themselves.

u/SneakyTina and u/TheJet-BlackWings will surely be fighting tooth and nail for much-needed wins to avoid relegation.

**DIVISION 4**

u/fusrohdab is in pole position to claim the Division 4 title, but they're not short of challengers awaiting a slip-up against bottom of the table u/mrg1607. A win for the latter might not be enough to grab a promotion spot, but it would certainly guarantee them survival.

u/macioman_00 leads the H2H race for the next promotion spot with u/_LilDuck hot on their tail.

u/appealtoreason00 and u/Midnightinaperfect have an outside chance of Promotion, but are closer to relegation.

**DIVISION 5**

u/No-Art1873 and u/m-bizant have done their best so far to lock up the promotion spots, but any slip-ups and they won't be short of managers waiting to take their place.

u/LUCANUMBER10 is one of those contenders, as is last season's Champion u/knoxvox, but Elimination is in sight should either of them fail to achieve what's required.

Both u/dedosii and u/YaT3N01 are in even more need of a win, or it's the end of the line for them.

https://preview.redd.it/pg3wo4msdzxd1.png?width=1894&format=png&auto=webp&s=63ba3b4f9d3246245f2a495a4405bb0550947084

**DIVISION 6**

u/BurnThemAll69 is top of the pile at the very foot of the FPL Swiss League system. A draw in GW10 will guarantee their survival at least through Stage 2.

u/fsagoalkeeper13, u/FPL_06, u/sockar101, and u/hansibit are all in the hunt for the final survival spot, and most likely, only one of them will be able to avoid Elimination.

u/Darkshit2 has a very small chance of surviving said Elimination, but they must win and hope for some very favourable results elsewhere.

https://preview.redd.it/3it8e4msdzxd1.png?width=1894&format=png&auto=webp&s=c8cc7930919b8c996c1d49d49739b1009bdb3bbb

That's it for the first round-up of the season. I'll be back next week with the final results of Stage 1 as well as the fixtures and tables ahead of Stage 2.

Best of luck to everyone.

2. Don’t bend over your baby will have cleft palette.

Yeah ok 🙄 I’ll just stand there and watch my dog suffer because of something I can’t do. 
3. This one really irritated me. Don’t leave your phone in your pocket or else the baby will get cancer.  I have it in my pocket for no more than 5-10mins at a time as I hate it being in my pocket.

We instantly clicked and have been doing everything together since we met. She lives in another city, but we see eachother every single day. Even if we can’t, we face time for hours on end. Lately I’ve been noticing she always asks for a favor back when I ask her for a favor. She always used to kind of do this, but it never clicked. It ranges. One thing she always does is split the costs evenly. She will ask the exact same cents back, even if she only paid 25 cents forward for me. I think it’s greedy but in a funny way and I don’t mind. But also when I ask her other things. For example I was feeling really bad about this situationship and she told me she would only come to support me if I got her a drink. Or when she helps me with my homework, she will ask if I will get her a coffee later. It’s small things, but it makes me wonder how much she does coming from the heart. She is also very stubborn so arguing is no use. Ever since I started noticing this pattern I can’t help but feel bad about it. This is the first time I have been this close with anyone and I hate the fact that I feel like I am being used. 

It’s also not like I don’t do her favors. I often go out of my way to bring her stuff she needs, food, printed stuff, other stuff she needs to lend. All this while she lives in another city. Other than that she is a great friend. We both like the same things and do lots of stuff together. She is the only person listening to my rants and gives good advice.

**Iliza Shlesinger**, **Taylor Tomlinson**, and **Whitney Cummings** sat in the cozy studio they’d set up in one of Havenbrook’s oldest buildings, which had once been a saloon. It was now a mix of exposed brick walls and modern recording equipment, perfect for their edgy, no-holds-barred podcast. They had been talking for hours about the insane happenings in Havenbrook. Their energy was high, and so were their opinions.

**Iliza**: ""Let’s be real here, people. This town has gone from quiet country charm to full-on soap opera, and we’re here for it.""

**Taylor**: ""Yeah, you’ve got bakeries burning down, mysterious notes, Andreja disappearing and reappearing like she’s Batman but, like, emotionally unavailable. And now Lady Hunter? Who even is that?""

**Whitney**: ""It’s like the plot of every Netflix true-crime series but with way hotter people. I mean, have you *seen* Rhea and Gal? That gym story? Whew.""

The three laughed, but their banter quickly turned into a deep dive into the events that had taken the town by storm.

# Iliza: ""But in all seriousness, we need to talk about what happened between Andreja and Alinity. I mean, I heard through the grapevine that Andreja practically stabbed her in the back, metaphorically and literally.""

**Whitney**: ""Not just stabbed in the back—stabbed her in the heart, emotionally. I saw Alinity at the market last week, and let me tell you, that girl’s been through it. Crying over fresh produce isn’t a good look for anyone.""

**Taylor**: ""Wait, did Andreja actually poison her or something? I heard Lady Hunter swooped in like a cowboy assassin with an antidote, which feels both weirdly out of place and totally on brand for this town.""

# Whitney: ""Speaking of Lady Hunter, can we talk about how Havenbrook apparently has bounty hunters now? Like, what even is going on? Is this real life or are we in a Tarantino movie?""

**Iliza**: ""I did some digging—well, by digging I mean I overheard someone at the gym—and Lady Hunter isn’t just here for fun. Apparently, she’s got a vendetta against Andreja for some job that went wrong. But the thing is, I don’t think Andreja's the only one in her crosshairs. Alinity’s somehow mixed up in this too.""

**Taylor**: ""Of course she is. She’s the center of the drama tornado. It’s like this town spins around her.""

# Whitney: ""And then you’ve got Cinna and Jenna trying to make things official. Have you seen Cinna lately? She’s been hanging out with Sonya from the Gangsta Girls.""

**Iliza**: ""Oh, Sonya’s the one with the voice that’s softer than a lullaby but could probably kill you with a look, right?""

**Taylor**: ""Yeah, her. And now Cinna’s getting all this 'relationship advice' from Sonya, which, I mean, good for her, but you know that’s gonna complicate things. Especially with Jenna still figuring out her own mess.""

# Whitney: ""Speaking of messes—Tatum and Michelle. Word is they had a blowout over who caused the bakery fire. Apparently, Michelle thinks it might have been sabotage, but Tatum’s just not having it.""

**Taylor**: ""What is this, a Hallmark movie with a murder subplot? Who sets bakeries on fire?""

**Iliza**: ""Apparently, someone in Havenbrook does. And let’s not forget the Gangsta Girls throwing millions into rebuilding the bakery. Like, who just hands over $5.6 million? Baddy and Jazzy are acting like it's pocket change.""

# Whitney: ""The Gangsta Girls have connections, clearly. And speaking of connections, how about Liv Morgan and Rihanna helping Lyra dig into the town’s secrets? I’m pretty sure they’re on to something big, but with all the distractions, no one’s paying attention.""

**Iliza**: ""Oh, I heard Lyra found something. Something to do with Andreja’s past. I think the Lady Hunter thing runs deeper than anyone realizes.""

# Taylor: ""Okay, last thing—what do we think about Rhea and Gal? Are they actually into each other, or is it just all gym sweat and competitiveness?""

**Iliza**: ""I think it’s definitely more than sweat. They’ve been sparring, but something’s brewing between them, and CG Maria definitely sees it.""

**Whitney**: ""I feel like the next time we see them in the gym, it’s either going to end in a kiss or a brawl. And honestly, I’d pay to see either.""

# The Town of Twists

As the podcast conversation raged on, the deep undercurrents of Havenbrook continued to bubble up. The town was a cauldron of secrets, and as the comedians discussed, each of its residents was navigating their own personal storm. While Lady Hunter’s arrival loomed large over Andreja and Alinity, other dynamics were in play, each of them adding to the chaos in ways even Lady Hunter couldn’t control.

# The Fallout Between Alinity and Andreja

Alinity had barely slept since the confrontation with Andreja. The poison Lady Hunter had cured was only part of the damage. Alinity’s heart felt like it had been shredded, her trust in Andreja hanging by a thread.

**Alinity**: ""Why did you do it?"" Her voice broke as she finally spoke to Andreja.

Andreja stood in the doorway, her posture rigid. She hadn’t expected Alinity to confront her so soon after Lady Hunter’s visit.

**Andreja**: ""I didn’t mean to hurt you, Alinity. I thought I was protecting you.""

Alinity’s laugh was bitter, filled with disbelief.

**Alinity**: ""Protecting me? By lying, by stabbing me—literally and emotionally? You didn’t protect me, Andreja. You broke me.""

Andreja’s expression wavered for the first time.

**Andreja**: ""I thought… I thought if you knew the truth, you’d leave me. I didn’t know how to stop this spiral.""

# Meanwhile, at Judy’s Place

Judy and **Jazzy** were finally winding down after a long night at **Shakira’s club**. They sat on the couch, half-eaten pizza slices on the coffee table.

**Judy**: ""You know, it’s nice to just relax. This town is crazy enough without us adding to it.""

Jazzy smiled, her arm resting lazily on the back of the couch.

**Jazzy**: ""You’re right, babe. But you know we’re probably going to get dragged into it, right? You don’t just show up in Havenbrook and stay on the sidelines.""

Judy laughed, nodding in agreement.

# Gal, Rhea, and CG Maria at the Gym

At the gym, **CG Maria** eyed **Rhea** and **Gal**, noticing the unspoken tension between them. She’d seen this before.

**CG Maria**: ""You two should just fight it out already. Or… you know… *not* fight it out.""

Rhea smirked, glancing at Gal.

**Rhea**: ""We’re fine.""

But Gal’s eyes betrayed her. She couldn’t deny the tension between them was more than just competitive. It was something deeper, something neither of them had fully acknowledged yet.

**Gal**: ""Maybe we’ll have to take this off the mats sometime.""

# Lyra, Liv, and Rihanna’s Breakthrough

**Lyra**, **Liv Morgan**, and **Rihanna** had been going through documents for hours, and finally, they hit something.

**Lyra**: ""This note… it mentions Lady Hunter, Andreja, and something called 'The List.'""

Liv frowned, leaning in to get a closer look.

**Liv**: ""What’s 'The List'? Is it some sort of hit list?""

**Rihanna**: ""Or a secret society? Either way, we need to dig deeper. This is just the beginning.""

# Cinna and Jenna’s Date Night

Elsewhere, **Cinna** and **Jenna** finally sat down together at a local café. The evening was soft, the air warm, and their connection undeniable. As they shared stories and laughed over coffee, Cinna knew it was time to take things to the next level.

**Cinna**: ""So… maybe we should stop tiptoeing around this and make it official?""

Jenna smiled, her eyes twinkling with excitement.

**Jenna**: ""I was hoping you’d say that.""

# Lady Hunter’s Promise

Back at Alinity’s, **Lady Hunter** lingered in the doorway as Andreja’s confession unraveled. Her voice was calm but carried weight.

**Lady Hunter**: ""Make it right, Andreja. Or I’ll be back, and next time, I won’t be so lenient.""

Andreja nodded, fear and guilt swirling in her chest. The battle wasn’t over—far from it.",1,1730332912.0,u_SilverEnd1208,0,1.0,False

I’m a muralist and recently moved to a new city where I only know my roommate, my partner, and a few of his friends. Working on it, but it’s a college town and the circles of late-20’s-early-30’s seem a little tighter than the last city I was in.

Sometimes I’m driving and I get the overwhelming urge to just grab a coffee, sit in a parking lot, and talk about something on my IG and see if other people relate to the feeling or observation. 90% of the time I don’t even post it because I can’t figure out how to word it without being extremely embarrassed. I dislike most aspects of social media. Generally it doesn’t make me feel good. But I keep coming back to this interaction aspect and wasting tons and tons of time. Even now I’m creating some kind of dialogue or conversation instead of doing the things I actually need to do. Part of me wants to just delete everything I wrote and try throwing my phone in the other room. I feel like this is an impulse battle I have almost every day. I deleted everything for a while but then I started missing job request DM’s. Downloaded it again and snaps right back.

Firstly, last year summer (out of no where!) I slowly started to develop lactose intolerance and it kept getting worse. I try to avoid dairy and only take lactaid when necessary, but sometimes it’s not very effective. 

On top of that, there are many other things which causes pain, discomfort, (and the need to use the bathroom almost every time).
- Mixing other foods with one another (even if eaten hours apart) doesn’t mix well
- Coffee and most foods don’t go well together, even if I have it hours apart (this specific thing has been an issue for a few years though)
- Coffee in general has started HURTING my stomach at times 
- Randomly spicy food will cause pain and discomfort
I literally have to plan out in my head what I am going to eat in a day, and if I just see as I go instead, I have to be so careful and avoid many things which isn’t easy especially if I’m not at home. 

BUT the weird thing is when I explained all of this to my gastroenterologist, he said it’s NOT IBS and I don’t need a colonoscopy.

I’ve been tested for celiac and h-pylori but both came back negative. I’ve had lots of other bloodwork done and everything is normal, including allergy testing.

My gastroenterologist prescribed me pills for possible acid issues? I will start taking those soon 1x/day after dinner and check back with him in January. 

I am also seeing a naturopath who gave me a probiotic to take before every meal which sort of helped.

Firstly, last year summer (out of no where!) I slowly started to develop lactose intolerance and it kept getting worse. I try to avoid dairy and only take lactaid when necessary, but sometimes it’s not very effective. 

On top of that, there are many other things which causes pain, discomfort, (and the need to use the bathroom almost every time).
- Mixing other foods with one another (even if eaten hours apart) doesn’t mix well
- Coffee and most foods don’t go well together, even if I have it hours apart (this specific thing has been an issue for a few years though)
- Coffee in general has started HURTING my stomach at times 
- Randomly spicy food will cause pain and discomfort
I literally have to plan out in my head what I am going to eat in a day, and if I just see as I go instead, I have to be so careful and avoid many things which isn’t easy especially if I’m not at home. 

BUT the weird thing is when I explained all of this to my gastroenterologist, he said it’s NOT IBS and I don’t need a colonoscopy.

I’ve been tested for celiac and h-pylori but both came back negative. I’ve had lots of other bloodwork done and everything is normal, including allergy testing.

My gastroenterologist prescribed me pills for possible acid issues? I will start taking those soon 1x/day after dinner and check back with him in January. 

I am also seeing a naturopath who gave me a probiotic to take before every meal which sort of helped. Now, a few months later he switched up the routine and he’s added 1 more pill and a powder to take each day to help fix the lining of my digestive tract (if that even is the issue), rather than to assist my stomach during every meal.

1gg19ao,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/1gg19ao/tips_for_a_first_time_literary_universe_builder/,"Tips for a first time ""Literary Universe"" builder? What are some pointers for making these stories all blend together?","So I have a ton of books already written, and since most of them aren't long enough to be trad published I just want to put everything out for free, and I have a plan to try to get some eyes on them if I'm lucky enough, but I'm just doing this for fun. The dream is too big, if it happens it happens, but I write because I love it. I already have a job.

1. I have a crime series that follows an LA criminal/young businessman (3 books so far, and will be doing book 4 for nanowrimo)

2. I have a collection of short stories, and ideas for more, that for sure take place in 1's universe, (Following minor characters from that series, for example, a girl is dating the guitarist of a band and he's a minor character, and I have a story about him and his band making a pact with the devil for super stardom)

This is where we get into this world having a supernatural bend to it, 

3. A series about a Demon Hunter academy, there is an acient secret order or demon hunters who study here (in South Carolina, so it's east coast and far removed from the LA down to earth criminal stuff)

4. A Buddy Cop series called ""The Occult Crimes Unit"" a task force for a major metropolitan city sees an uptick in ""Occult Crime"" (Human sacrifice, effagies, the church of satan vandalizing things, monsters, vampires ect)

5. Haven't written yet, but a historical fiction novel about a certain president, in which I will sneak in a few refrences to him being in the alternate history that i've created for this world.

And I'm workshopping ideas for other things I could throw into this pot.

All books will reference the same consumer products ""Red Apple Ciggerette"" style, the popular domestic beer brand, restaurant expy's (instead of star bucks there are ""Coffee Jamborees""). I have a fictional president who people will mention in passing (And you KNOW he'll get a political thriller eventually, probably involving the 2nd Korean war that starts at the end of LA story book 2) website expys for things like facebook and youtube. (Also this is fun, George Clooney is a Senator in this world, but I don't out right say it, just passing refrence to a ""Senator Clooney"")

Some core tenants of the world are the Knights Templar are extremely important to the lore. A secretive underground group that went into hiding and still exists today and is fighting against the increase in supernatural activity that the Demon Hunter academy is fighting, as well as the ""normal"" characters that are noticing, ""okay something weird is going on...""

I am a christian, so theres a lot of Christian theology in the books (Not preachy, it just assumes that yeah...christianity is real, the stories are real, more the lore of the world than me saying like YOU HAVE TO BE CHRISTIAN) Heven, hell, angles, demons, satan, Jesus is eventually coming back, and the big event I'm building too for maybe someday, years off, is a GIANT Avengers crossover that takes place in the battle of Armageddon. (I just think the US Millitary fighting an army of vampires werewolfs and zombies and demons would be really awesome but that's far future, not focusing on that now, but looking for places to kinda drop little tid bits that like..yeah something huge is coming)

So I feel like what I got to is keep these two halves separate for a time, have all the crazy moster demon stuff on the east coast and have just a little bit of it pushing into the west coast stories eventually (years on, writing them mostly as their own with just a few refrences that will gradually become more prominent) until I can do the BIG insane event with everyone. But I could use some tips about pitfalls I should avoid.

One of my favorite Indie Authors, (IDK what his reputation is, he might be thought of as terrible, but I LOVE his stuff and he's been a big influence on me) is a writer named Scott Sigler, I've been following him for years, and seeing that everything is kinda starting to come together has been awesome and I devour his books when they release faster than I do for any other author.

Around one and a half year ago i spilled a cup of coffee over my T480. Due to a lot of mixed luck, most of it landed in the keyboard and drained through it. I immediately turned it off, disconnected it from the charger, and removed the external battery. Around two minutes after this i remembered that it had an internal battery and disassembled it so i could disconnect it. After an entire day of drying i soaked it in 99% ethanol and let it dry again, but when i turned it on, the keyboard didn't work at all.

I bought a new (unofficial) keyboard afterwards, but it had a problem: sometimes, randomly or after applying a certain amount of pressure where the keyboard connector is, it would behave as if i was holding the FN key; pressing spacebar would toggle the backlight and pressing ESC would activate FnLock. The nub also behaves strangely, randomly insta-flicking through the screen and pressing random mouse buttons before stopping with the keyboard mouse buttons unresponsive. 

Further detail:

* I didn't test it with another keyboard (the only one i have is the caffeinated one) 
* The nub and the keyboard mouse buttons start working again after some time, or after suspending and waking up
* Sometimes the keyboard exits its sticky-fn mode when i nudge the connector, pressing lightly through the keyboard where the connector is located, or when propping it up within its slot in the case
* No other problems that look like liquid damage on the motherboard have appeared since then

Is this an off-brand keyboard problem, or is this a liquid-damage-in-the-motherboard problem? 

Absolutely NO problems have appeared since using this new keyboard, and i'm posting this mainly to try and prevent myself from sending my notebook to an expensive repair shop for a week to find out it's a keyboard problem or from buying a new keyboard to find out it's a liquid damage problem.",1,1730332670.0,thinkpad,0,1.0,False

Not all rules in relationships are inherently bad. ""I have a boundary that my partner can't murder someone"" - that's a perfectly fine rule. The problem with still calling them boundaries is that manipulative people have started using therapy speak to justify abusive behavior. 

Boundary - I will not watch horror movies
Rule - My partner is not allowed to watch horror movies 
Rule - My ""boundary"" is that I won't be in a relationship with someone who watches horror movies 

You can see a really clear example of this from Jonah Hill a few years ago:

""Plain and simple:
If you need:
-Surfing with men
-Boundaryless inappropriate friendships with men
-to model
-to post pictures of yourself in a bathing suit 
-to post sexual pictures
-friendships with women who are in unstable places and from your wild recent past beyond getting a lunch or coffee or something respectful
I am not the right partner for you. If these things bring you to a place of happiness I support it and there will be no hard feelings.

Under Niccol, who joined in September, Starbucks aims to speed up U.S. service by ensuring drinks are delivered in under four minutes, with about half of current orders meeting this target. The turnaround plan also includes bringing back condiment bars, eliminating fees for milk alternatives, reducing the menu, and addressing mobile order challenges.

Niccol’s strategy focuses initially on North America, with plans to assess operations in China—a market where sales fell 14% this quarter due to strong competition from local brands like Luckin Coffee. U.S. sales also dropped, down 6%, with a 10% decrease in customer traffic. To fund the turnaround, Starbucks will cut back on new cafe openings and renovations in fiscal 2025. The company reported net income of $909.3 million, or 80 cents per share, below expectations, with revenue at $9.07 billion, a 3% decline from last year.

I currently have 7 10/10 LORs. I am applying as a humanities major, most likely philosophy. 

LOR 1: PoliSci Prof. We’ve known each other for 2 years now, and have grabbed coffee a number of times. Knows my work, and was the first person to suggest publishing. He also adapted my papers to his class’s curriculum, as he really liked them. He also encouraged me to submit to The Philosophical Review, but that’s a long shot lol. 

LOR 2: Philosophy Prof. I’ve taken a number of classes with him, and he has loved my work. We talk nearly everyday, and have a good connection. He also adapted my papers to his curriculum.

LOR 3: History prof, former Stanford prof. Taken a number of classes with him, TA’d for him, and he is the faculty advisor for my club.

LOR 4: Psych prof. We talk nearly every week, and make very… questionable jokes together. 

LOR 5: CS prof. Not a CS major, but he went to MIT back in the 80’s and took Noam Chomsky’s class, and attended a few philosophy seminars (Derrida, etc). We don’t talk about STEM, but have spent hours talking about philo. 

LOR 6: My manager at my school’s tutoring center. I’ve worked there for 2 years, and tutor 3 subjects. Very lovely lady, and has helped me through a lot (gifted her with, what I think was, a very lovely note and a $50 coffee gift card for her help with my grievance case).

LOR 7: Manager at former internship. Wasn’t related to humanities, but designed a number of advertising slogans that helped expand.

I’m aware of the schools that limit LORs, so this concerns those who don’t. 

This is what I’m thinking:

Academic: 2, 3, 5
Professional: 6, 7
Personal: 1, 4

Would this be optimal? Should I allot the academic LORs to profs with whom I’ve taken the most classes? Would submitting all 7 make my application look fake? To note, I will have AAs in history, philosophy, and polisci, all with a 4.0. My cGPA is a 3.9.

1gg0y17,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialMoney/comments/1gg0y17/expense_pattern_analyzer_find_spending_patterns/,Expense Pattern Analyzer: Find Spending Patterns and Suggest Savings 💰,"## 💡 The Idea
Let's build an AI system that helps people understand and optimize their spending habits. By analyzing transaction data and uncovering hidden patterns, we can create a smart financial advisor that provides personalized savings recommendations. The key is going beyond simple categorization to deliver actionable insights that actually help users save money.

## 😫 Problem
Most people struggle to truly understand their spending patterns. Traditional budgeting apps simply categorize expenses and track totals, but they don't provide deeper insights into spending behaviors. During our research with users, we found that many people waste money on unused subscriptions, miss opportunities for bulk purchase savings, and fail to notice gradual price increases in their regular expenses.

The real challenge isn't tracking expenses - it's understanding them. While users have access to their transaction data, they lack the tools to extract meaningful insights and actionable recommendations from it. This is where AI can make a significant difference.

## ✨ Solution
Our system will combine transaction analysis with machine learning to create a comprehensive financial insights platform. Instead of just showing users what they spent, we'll help them understand why they spent it and how they could spend less.

The core of our solution revolves around pattern recognition. We'll analyze transaction histories to identify recurring payments, detect price trends, and spot unusual spending patterns. For example, the system might notice that a user's Netflix subscription increased by $3 last month, or that they could save money by switching their grocery shopping to a different day of the week.

Beyond pattern detection, we'll provide smart recommendations based on aggregated spending data. If we notice a user consistently buys coffee every morning, we might suggest a monthly subscription plan that could save them money. For business users, we might identify vendors who offer better bulk pricing or highlight seasonal spending patterns that could be optimized.

## 🎯 Target Users
Our platform will serve both individual and business users, but with different focuses. For individuals, we'll emphasize personal savings opportunities and lifestyle optimization. This includes young professionals looking to build wealth, families trying to manage household expenses, and freelancers dealing with irregular income patterns.

Business users will get more sophisticated analytics and team features. Small business owners can track vendor pricing trends and optimize bulk purchases. Financial advisors can use our insights to provide better guidance to their clients. The key is providing the right level of detail for each user type without overwhelming them.

## 💰 Monetization
We'll use a tiered pricing model that grows with our users' needs. The free tier will provide basic expense tracking and simple pattern detection, giving users a taste of what's possible. As users want more sophisticated insights, they can upgrade to premium features like advanced pattern detection, custom categories, and AI-powered recommendations.

For business users, we'll offer team access, custom reporting, and API access. This allows companies to integrate our insights into their existing financial workflows and systems. White-label options will be available for financial advisors and institutions who want to offer our technology under their own brand.

## 🛠️ Implementation Approach
From a technical perspective, we'll build this system in layers. The foundation is a robust data processing pipeline that can reliably import and normalize transaction data from various sources. We'll use bank APIs like Plaid for data access, and implement strong security measures to protect sensitive financial information.

The analysis engine will use a combination of statistical analysis and machine learning to identify patterns and generate recommendations. We'll start with basic pattern recognition for recurring payments and gradually add more sophisticated analysis capabilities. The recommendation engine will combine identified patterns with aggregated user data to suggest actionable savings opportunities.

For the user interface, we'll focus on clear visualization of insights rather than overwhelming users with raw data. The dashboard will highlight the most relevant patterns and highest-value savings opportunities. Mobile responsiveness is crucial since users often want to check their finances on the go.

## 🚀 Next Steps
The key to success is starting simple and iterating based on user feedback. Our MVP will focus on core pattern detection and basic recommendations. We can then gradually add more sophisticated analysis capabilities and custom features based on how users interact with the system.

Future enhancements might include predictive analytics for future spending, tax optimization suggestions, and integration with investment platforms. The goal is to create a comprehensive financial optimization platform that grows with our users' needs.

## 💭 Discussion Points
As we build this system, several important questions need to be considered. How do we balance privacy with personalization? What defines a ""good"" recommendation? How do we handle shared expenses and joint accounts? These challenges will shape our development decisions and ultimately determine the success of the platform.

Share your thoughts on these challenges and your experiences with similar systems. What features would you prioritize in the MVP? How would you approach the balance between simplicity and sophistication? Let's discuss in the comments below! 👇",1,1730331955.0,ArtificialMoney,0,1.0,False

Wondering if other people who were previously friendless have insight on how they've gained a few friends? I've tried joining in on things like group bike rides, game nights at popular coffee shops, but outside of those one off events, haven't been able to create friendships past the perfunctory small talk due to proximity.

I don't have friends so can't ask any to loop me in to friend hangouts or ask if they have friends who are looking for more friends too. I am usually the only one of me at work (Black, but also trans and queer, or out, if there are others who are just protecting their neck in less comfortable work places), and usually prefer to avoid friendships stemming from work anyway due to the way that can implode (being careful or less careful about info shared making its way to supervisors.)

I also occasionally post in Reddit meetup subs, on Lex (if you don't know, shittified queer micro-post twitter-like space) and queer facebook groups asking if anyone would like to attend certain events together or meet up for a coffee or bite to eat - always zero replies, or someone saying they'd like to rain check for another day, without any followup.

The \~\*broke\*\~ qualifier is important, because I can't afford things like fitness classes or classes for hobbies. I grabbed a free month of Class Pass for a promotion and did meet someone who wanted to hang out outside of the class we attended, but they're younger than me in a Noticeable Way, regarding our interactions (pop culture references going past both our heads, at different places in life, etc.)

I get that the inability to make or maintain friendships is a Me thing and I'm working on figuring out how to be more open and social in therapy, it just feels like the small steps I try to take are Extremely Fruitless, which has been incredibly frustrating.

Edit: I identify as a nonbinary trans person, within that, low femme/sometimes woman. It's very obviously \~\*\~not a hard and fast\*\~\*\~ way to navigate the space. Tried crossposting in r/bitcheswithtaste and the post was removed, presumably because I didn't specify that I do identify as a woman partially.

I went to Tims earlier, ordered my regular coffee and her latte but they ran out so I ended up leaving with only my coffee 

I get home she opens the door, sees my coffee and immediately goes back to the kitchen before I have time to say that they didn’t have her latte. I heard her talk to my sister and then she went in her room and banged her door shut

So I go in the kitchen confused and I ask my sister why she was mad. My sister was being super weird and kept dodging my question 

So I went to my mom’s room and asked her directly. She starts yelling at me and saying she couldn’t believe I didn’t get her a coffee blabla. So I tell her that I tried but they didn’t have any and that she’s acting like a child

Well I guess that set her off cause next thing she’s full on screaming at me telling me I couldve gotten her a regular coffee or texted to ask if she wanted anything else 

I was like you literally went the other day and didn’t get me anything yet you didn’t see me acting this way???? She answered “Im your mother that’s different blablabla”

Just kept on yelling at me saying that if i’m not happy I can move out, that she’ll get a smaller apartment for only her and my sister as it’ll cost less.

1gg0rag,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1gg0rag/i_need_some_perspective_whats_reasonable_whats_my/,I need some perspective - What's reasonable? What's my fault?,"Hi. I have long lurked here, and never had the courage to post. I have a long standing issue with my adult daughter that is making me crazy and damaging our relationship, but seems to not be that big of a deal to her? I think I need some perspective from a specifically ADHD-informed point of view. 

I have severe ADHD (diagnosed), as does my son (12M, diagnosed). My daughter (20F) believes she has ADHD, but is not diagnosed. I'm not disputing that it's likely, but she's definitely not hyperactive and has far fewer symptoms or issues than either her brother or myself. I feel like that sounds harsh, but I have trouble maintaining employment and cannot maintain relationships, and I struggle with a lot of basic tasks. She is quite able to manage her own life, maintain employment/relationships, and succeed in school/work. I do recognize that there are things that she does find difficult, and I've always tried to be supportive or find systems/approaches to help her.

We have one conflict that is enormous. She struggles to put anything away, as she seems not to understand what things are, or the concept of basic organization. So I've labelled everything and everywhere in my house. I've spent hours and hours on bins and receptacles to create specific places and immediate instruction on where things go. She completely ignores this. I have had hundreds of conversations with her about how this inattention affects me, what my expectations are in the home, and requested over and over that she work with me on a solution. She simply responds with the following - I don't know why \[I put the cordless drill behind the towels in the linen cupboard\]; I'm not really into home organization like you are; I have ADHD; I don't know; and similar verbal shrugs. 

When she was a teenager, I tried to breathe through the frustration, tried strategies, talked to my therapist... And her inattention just caused more and more damage to my life, up to and including a house fire. At this point, I've replaced so many expensive things that I find in bizarre locations later, and ultimately it's just years and years of stress and no accountability from her. 

The last straw was last week. I had noticed that some small appliances that I use on a semi-regular basis had vanished from their labelled spot in my kitchen. One being the vacuum sealer and associated supplies I use when I buy bulk meat and portion it for the freezer. So not having it meant that I had a panicky and busy night trying to figure out what to do with $500 worth of meat that I had just bought. I spent hours pulling the kitchen apart, looked everywhere I could think of. Some days later, I happened to mention that I had lost these things to my kiddo. She goes oh, and then heads to my **office** and pulls the sealer (and 3-4 other appliances) out of a top shelf that had contained nothing except the memorial boxes for our deceased pets. I mention this because I feel like there is zero chance that any human being could think ""ah yes, this is also where the vacuum sealer and the hand blender and the electric carving knife goes"". I just said WHY in this stunned voice and she shrugged and said ""I dunno, I get confused. It's my ADHD"". 

I want to be understanding and compassionate... but I also struggle with being organized and this is everyday and years of my life trying to figure out if the potting soil might be in the pantry with the pasta because she thought it was coffee. Or if all the forks are under the bathroom sink in the bin with the hair dryer. I'm exhausted. I feel out of control. I feel like I can't do anything with anything because I live in terror that something important will disappear. I feel like this behaviour is spiteful and purposeful and that makes me feel like a s\*\*t parent. I guess I need help finding the words to explain to her how this is impacting our relationship? She's in the process of moving out (I can't take it anymore) but I'm actively struggling to be her mom because of how little she seems to care about this issue. 

Also - she doesn't have this problem anywhere else. For years she worked at/managed a coffee shop, so I would try to relate things to work... Like, you know how you organize a prep fridge in a restaurant? That's how our home is going to work. This made not a iota of difference to the behaviour. And it's always just this shrug and I dunno, and I can't change because I have ADHD. 

I'm sorry for the rant - I know this might be a niche issue. I'm just hoping for advice on how I can see another side to what feels like rejection? I'd like to try to repair our relationship when not living together but I think her indifference has just caused me to feel anxious, sad, and resentful in general.

I (25F) flew home solo for the first time on Sunday. I got to the airport at 5:50am for my 7:45am flight (TSA didn’t open until 6). I take my anxiety meds and head on through, I decide to get a Starbucks drink to sip on while I wait at my gate and order something I’ve had before and know the ingredients of. It’s important to note that I have many food allergies and my drs are suspecting I may have MCAS ( mastcell activation syndrome) which is when immune cells create to much histamine in response to a trigger and cause allergic type symptoms with a range in severity. 

About 1/4 of the way through my drink at the gate my throat starts to get itchy, I shrug it off and continue to sip my drink and read my kindle. About halfway through my drink my throat is now  on fire and getting progressively  more itchy. I realize it’s likely my coffee and promptly toss it and buy a water. 

My flight boards a few minutes later and I had been looking around for someone that looked like they might have Benadryl (like a mom of youngish to teen kids maybe) because I know it’s about to be an uncomfortable flight. ( I usually have some but I had forgotten it for this 3 day trip) 

Heres where I made the biggest mistake, I’m new to all this and asked a flight attendant on the way on board if they had any. Not thinking much of it as if I were asking for an ibuprofen and she looks very nervously at me and told me they don’t and asked what seat I’m in to keep an eye on me. 

About 10 min later I see two officers board the flight followed by a flight attendant who asks that I step off the flight because they have EMS outside and they would like to have me looked at before I fly, just to be safe. I didn’t want to cause any trouble so I tell them no problem and they grab my overhead bag just in case.

They take me off of the terminal and Im met by three very nice looking firefighters/EMS who take my blood pressure which is very low and vitals and proceeded to tell me that my SPO2 is normal and that they would like to take me to the emergency room I politely declined because I just wanna go home, I’ve never had an anaphylactic reaction before and that all I need is some Benadryl. They tell me that I know my body and that they don’t think I need it right this second but they could give me Benadryl and Epi I need and say again that they would like to take me to the ER. I politely declined while trying to hold back tears as I realize that I’m probably not going to get a fly home right now. They then proceeded to tell me that they’re here If I need them.

The gate attendant, then proceeds to inform me that they spoke with their higher-ups and that I need to take an antihistamine and cannot fly for another 12 hours. It is now 8 AM which means that the next flight that I would be able to take would be 9:30 PM that night. I work at 7am the next day.

 I am by myself flying solo for the first time in my life, with terrible plane anxiety (ptsd induced claustrophobia) and a general dislike for public spaces. In a state that I do not live in and do not have any family in, I also don’t have the money to go back to a hotel room. Running on like three hours of sleep. I ended up getting super sick at the airport and have been out of work the past few days because of it. (Woohoo!)

To top it off I fly out of the country on Friday! 

Thought I would share as I’m able to laugh about it now and wanted to give a little PSA to those who are also new-ish to adulting, that telling someone your throat is itchy is a big deal and should not be done lightly! 

All good now, gonna go get some bougie IV fluid therapy tomorrow before my flight and my Dr is calling in an epi pen and steroids to have on hand while im out of the country just Incase!

I have close friends with whom I'm close but at my age (and with my disabilities) I find I've stopped meeting people in the *wild*. So that's what led me here! 
  I am energetic in communication & generally respond with questions or a lot of text (notice my exclamation points! 😅)
   While my interests are varied, I love discussing ANYthing I or a friend is truly passionate about.
    I was an english major in college and I like to read all the classics, love poetry and literature. I read non-fiction as well (science, history, criticism, politics, etc) I'm a big animal lover (one dog of my own, currently).  I'm vegan and recently gluten free(😢). As an autistic adhd-er I often prefer to wait and respond to ppl that approach me first.  
    I have a partner I love dearly with whom I live/ raise dog. 
   I like plants, love to be out in nature from walking the dog to longer hikes. I'm passionate about social justice and the environment. I like interior design. I used to smoke a lot of weed, and drink but have quit for the time being, for health reasons. I'm a big poetry lover. I'm a hobbyist poet and amateur painter (I will, semi-often, do other crafts such as knit/crochet or upcycle). I'm thinking of trying stained glass next. 
    I love coffee!
   Tbh, I don't feel the pressing need to have tons in common to get to know someone. Maybe that's because I've always been a little out there. Kinda crunchy, hippy type. It's great if we do share interests, but I think personalities that mesh are most important to me rn.      
    I'm a lot! So I'm probably looking for someone who won't  feel overwhelmed by my enthusiasm, more than anything. & If we are very different I will probably still enjoy a good chat :) I LOVE people and I'm endlessly curious when it comes to getting to know someone, asking lots of questions, etc. 
    I'm from originally Chicago but have since moved for financial reasons and bc I care for my elderly parents, which is much easier for me outside of the city. Like I said before, I'm disabled, have myriad health and mental illnesses, so some days I'm just out of commission!

It's been 10 years since we've seen each other and, even then, we couldn't look one another in the eye. I wish I knew how you felt when agreed to come work with me for a day but, then again, there are a lot of things I wish I knew and that I wish you knew too.

In my most recent dreams, I nearly get the chance to tell you these things and to hear them from you. We get so close, but the conversation never seems to be at the right time. I'm not blind to the fact that this is symbolic of so much of our time together. It was fragile and volatile because of your situation, but it was also full of a love that I don't think I've known since. I found my journal from that time and, though I was young, I was certain we were the right people but at the wrong time. And maybe that's okay, but I want you to know that I did love you. Even when I coyly avoided acknowledging it after you'd misheard me one day (I'd said something close, but not *those* three words).

I don't know that I'll ever see or talk to you again. I live thousands of miles away now and only come home once a year. I have no idea how to contact you and don't know that it would be best if I did anyway. I want you to know, though, that what happened was meaningful to me even though I pushed it as far away as possible when it all came tumbling down. I know you were in a difficult situation and I hope that things have eased for you. I hope that you found love either with her, in a new relationship, or with yourself. I've done a lot of my own work in the past few years and this has always been one loose end that I can't seem to let go of, so I'm hoping that putting this into the universe might help.

Maybe we'll pass one another on the street someday when I'm home. Maybe you'll be visiting one day and we'll end up in the same coffee shop. Maybe we'll never see each other again, but I want to thank you for seeing me in a way that I didn't know I could be seen before.

I’m at day 7 post-op (surgery was 10/23) as an adult (24F) and I seriously underestimated the pain that would come with this recovery. The pain is slowly improving but I was sorely mistaken to think I’d be back to college classes and work by now. Anyways, back to the main reason I’m posting… A new thing I’m noticing as I’m able to tolerate more foods is that my sense of taste and smell is way different than before surgery. Is this something anyone else has experienced or knows of? My doctor didn’t mention anything about this and I’m wondering if this is something temporary or if it is going to be something permanent I need to adjust to. Still can’t handle solid foods, but was able to manage some really finely ground meatloaf which was a lifesaver since I’ve been craving meats/proteins after eating only puddings, jellos, popsicles, and watery mashed potatoes for a whole week already. I also have had a really sensitive sense of smell since surgery. For example, I can smell my air freshener plug-in from the upstairs floor while I am downstairs, and it was previously very faint when I would be in the same room with it. I am also a huge coffee fan and keep whole bean espresso that I grind myself. For the first few days after surgery, I thought I was smelling a skunk or possibly marijuana from outside, then came to realize the smell was actually coming from my espresso. After I identified that it was indeed the espresso beans, I was able to pinpoint that they smell earthier than usual now and most things are very heightened in a similar way (sweets smell sweeter, the cats’ litter boxes have strong ammonia smell even though they’re cleaned daily, cleaning supplies smell more chemical-y than I remember).

Cassy navigated the bustling streets of Menthil, moving from the lower boroughs to the middle boroughs. As he crossed the street, a quaint little shop drew his attention: Amatherit Bakery. Its cozy exterior radiated warmth, and the irresistible aroma of freshly baked bread danced through the air, beckoning him inside.




He deftly sidestepped a bicycle-riding paperboy and stepped into the café. The moment he crossed the threshold, the rich scent of coffee and warm pastries enveloped him like a comforting embrace. The café was nearly full, but a small table near the hearth caught his eye. He settled into it, relishing the warmth of the fireplace that wrapped around him like a long-lost friend.




""Good morning! What'll ya have?"" chirped the waitress, her cheerful smile brightening the room.




""Three cups of espresso and a Royale, please,"" he replied, his voice blending into the cozy hum of conversation as he took a moment to absorb the lively atmosphere around him.




A familiar figure at a nearby table snagged his attention—Bella.




Dressed in a black jumper and beige pants, she sat before an impressive mountain of sweets: chocolate cake, creamed strawberries, and a crepe crowned with berries and cream. Lost in her indulgence, she glanced up and met his gaze for a brief moment before looking away, only to do a double take, disbelief flashing in her eyes.




Without a second thought, Cassy stood and approached, plopping down across from her. Bella's expression shifted to one of surprise, her protective instincts kicking in as she instinctively pushed her sugary treasure slightly away.




""Good morning, Bella,"" he said, leaning forward with a teasing grin.




""Maple?"" Bella blinked, confusion evident in her furrowed brow.




""Who else would it be?"" he replied, a playful smirk tugging at his lips. ""Where's your date? Surely you don't plan on devouring all of this yourself, right? ... Right?""




Cassy studied the silent Bella, half in disbelief. She couldn't be serious.




Narrowing her eyes, she feigned a hurt expression. ""What? Why can't I? Who are you to judge me, psychopath? Sometimes, in life, you just need to treat yourself, okay? How else can we survive in this dark world?"" She stuck her tongue out at him before continuing to munch on her crepe. ""Hmph!""




Just then, the waitress arrived, placing Cassy's order of three steaming cups of black espresso and a ham-and-cheese croissant before him.




Bella sipped her tea, her tone dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. ""So, you know there are two hunters after you—a priest and a scribe.""




""Is that so?"" Cassy raised an eyebrow, his casual demeanor barely masking the tightness in his chest. ""Thanks for the heads-up. They must not be thrilled that three of their agents have failed the mission.""




""Be careful, Maple. They're not like me or the others. Nest and Purity grew up in the organization, trained to kill since youth. Don't underestimate those psychos; they could give you a run for your money.""




Cassy gulped his coffee a little too quickly, a cough escaping him.




""Indeed concerning... Anyway, I didn't realize members of secret evil organizations led such calm lives. I guess it makes sense, then,"" he teased, lifting a cup to his lips, inhaling the rich aroma. If only caffeine could infuse some clarity into his day. ""If you don't mind, I'm going to 'treat myself.'"" He took a big bite of his croissant, the melted cheese perfectly mingling with the buttery pastry. ""Ahhh, I'm in heaven!"" he exclaimed, savoring the warmth that seeped down his throat. ""I'm alive again!""




Bella smirked at his display of satisfaction. ""Say, did you hit your head? You're so... normal today. What's going on? Did you get brain surgery?""




Cassy focused on his breakfast, deliberately ignoring her taunts, though a grin threatened to break through. He finished his food and drained his coffee, then pulled out eight copper pence, leaving it on the table. ""Yes, well, I'm like this most of the time. And no! Anyway, some of us have better things to do than sit around indulging in pastries. 'Til we meet again, Bella!""




He pushed his chair back and stood, casting one last lingering glance at the fireplace before turning to leave.




""Good riddance! Don't come back!"" Bella called after him, her voice mimicking an angry old woman scolding children.




Cassy chuckled to himself as he stepped outside, the warmth of the café still lingering in his mind. The crisp air invigorated him as he made his way through the bustling streets of Menthil, heading toward Anston Fine Cloths. The chilly wind nipped at him, and he pulled his coat tighter around himself as he navigated the lively market square. Merchants shouted their wares, their voices blending with laughter and the clinking of coins.




As he approached the tailor's shop, the elegant display in the window caught his eye. Tailored suits of various fabrics and colors hung neatly, each exuding a charm that only fine clothing could possess. Above the door, the sign read ""Anston Fine Cloths"" in ornate lettering, promising quality and sophistication.




Stepping inside, the warmth of the shop enveloped him like a comforting blanket. His gaze was immediately drawn to the salesman, a tall man clad in a vibrant red cashmere suit that seemed to glow with extravagance. Bloody hell, Cassy thought, that suit could blind a man!




""Good day! How can I assist you?"" the salesman's smooth voice flowed over him like honey.




""Uh, I'm looking for a suit,"" Cassy replied, feeling a bit out of place amidst the opulence.




""Certainly! We have a wide selection."" The salesman's eyes lit up as he gestured toward a row of suits. ""This one, for example, is twelve pounds.""




Cassy's eyebrows shot up in disbelief. ""Twelve pounds? Do you have anything cheaper?""




The man's expression faltered, hurt flickering across his features, but he quickly masked it. ""Of course! Right this way."" He led Cassy to another section of the shop, maintaining his professional demeanor.




""Here we have a linen suit. It's not tailored, but it should fit you."" The salesman presented a simple black suit, but Cassy frowned at it.




Not very warm, he mused, shivering at the thought of wearing such thin fabric in this cold weather.




Noticing his hesitation, the salesman quickly added, ""Ah, but next to it—this one here is wool. We should have one in the back that is your size. It's very popular around this time of year."" He pointed to a charcoal suit that looked both stylish and cozy.




Cassy examined the suit closely, running his fingers over the fabric. This one looks warm, he thought, nodding appreciatively. ""How much do these run for?"" he inquired.




The salesman looked him over, gauging his reaction. ""Four pounds as is, or six pounds if you'd like lifetime repair services.""




Six pounds? Bloody hell, I could eat for months on that! Cassy pondered, calculating the cost of his next meal. However, the warmth and durability of the wool suit were hard to resist.




""Alright, I'll take the wool suit, please,"" he decided, satisfaction swelling within him.




""Excellent choice!"" The salesman beamed, taking the suit and preparing it for him.




Reaching into his pocket to pay, Cassy pulled out two crisp five-pound bills that Captain had given him the night before. A wave of embarrassment washed over him as he realized how poorly he was dressed compared to the lavish surroundings.




""Ah, is there somewhere I can change?"" he asked, his cheeks slightly flushed.




The salesman chuckled, clearly amused. ""Of course! Right this way."" He led Cassy to a small fitting room at the back of the shop.




Once inside, Cassy quickly changed into the charcoal suit. He looked at himself in the mirror, taking in his reflection. His medium-length auburn hair fell like autumn leaves, framing his striking silver eyes. His strong jawline and subtly defined nose were now complemented by the sharp lines of the sports jacket and the warmth of the flocked coat.




""Well, I look absolutely dashing, if I don't say so myself!"" he exclaimed, a grin spreading across his face. ""Captain will certainly be pleased.""




With that thought, excitement bubbled within him. The day ahead seemed full of possibilities, and for the first time in a while, things felt like they were looking up.




Shortly thereafter, Cassy left the shop, stepping back into the brisk air, feeling a mix of exhilaration and relief.




The suit was a step toward a more refined version of himself—one that he hoped would help him navigate the complexities of life in Menthil. Two hunters, huh? A priest and a scribe... a dangerous combination. If they stick together, the scribe could unleash hell from behind the priest's protective barrier. Dogshit! Why can't these people just leave me alone?




Standing on the curb, he did something he never thought he would—he waved down a carriage. It was time for his official debut at Blackstone Solutions!

Lukewarm coffee and a Cinnapuck?? ,"I'm rarely up and about early enough for fast food breakfast but the other day I found myself running around town at 9am. I figured I'd treat myself to some breakfast and decided Wendy's bc I've only had it a few times and I wanted to try the Cinnabon pull apart thing. I get a couple sandwiches, large coffee and a Cinnabon. 

I get home, unwrap my sandwich, take a swig of coffee and to my dismay it's tepid, lukewarm, not hot at all. Whatever I eat my sandwiches and drink my mop water. Then I pull out my Cinnabon and while I'm not expecting it to be overflowing the container like the ad shows it should at least be able to touch the walls of the container. This lil puck of disappointment looked so sad with its glob of icing on top nothing oowey or gooey about it. I popped it into my thermonuclear reactor for a sec to melt the icing a little and while it was a bit more glazed and gooey it was still a disappointing stale excuse of a cinnamon role. 

So my questions to the Wendy's workers of the world, how can the hot coffee get so cold? Isn't it just brewed right into a warmer dispenser machine like at a gas station? Did they just microwave the cold brew for a sec? 

Also is it normal for the pull aparts to be that bad or was I just double unlucky?

I work for a woman with 2 children and a large family, many whom all work at the hotel. The children, let's call them Blondie and Bunhead, come into work 2 days a week. Here's the kicker: they get paid for 5. I can confirm this because I work the days that Bunhead works. She always comes in to cover my shift once my shift is over. I would also check their time sheets to confirm the rumors that they were in fact getting fake hours. It's true. Both Bunhead and Blondie had a total of maybe 16 hours a week, each. 

After figuring out they may get caught, Boss, Blondie and Bunhead have started filling in false hours on the time sheet. So now it looks like they were here 5 days, even though they weren't. 

My coworker and the breakfast chef, The Turtle, would also come in an hour early every week say, and two hours early every week night. This wouldn't bother me if a. Turtle kept his head in his own business or B. Turtle didn't expect me to have the coffee ready an hour before his scheduled time. Like, if you're not supposed to be here until 5, I shouldn't be snitched on for not having the coffee ready by 4. He's a huge snitch, he snitches on me if i ever fall asleep (which is rarely) even after my boss said it was ok to take short naps if we're slow. He snitched on me for having my boyfriend come in to drop something off. Yet he's allowed to come in and get paid for 5 extra hours each week? Just because he feels like it?

The last thing is that there are employees staying in the rooms illegally. ""Why is it illegal?"" 
Because with employees, they get to control the rate more, and allegedly they'll take the money under the table. Just the other day we sent a guest to a room that had an employee in it. When we were trying to figure out why we hadn't been notified of the rooms occupation, we were told by its occupant, the turtle man, that we ""aren't supposed to know if employees are staying in the rooms.""

After work is usually half a bagel or whatever is leftover from my breakfast. It’s only irritating because I eat every like 90 minutes.

My wife is a SAHM to our three kids (5,3,4 months) and is still very much feeling some postpartum issues. She still wakes up several times a night to nurse, the baby,  so she is definitely not getting as much sleep as she’d like. I am fortunate enough to be able to let her sleep until 10 AM most days (I let her sleep til she gets wakes up on the weekend. Often as late as noon) as I often work from home. I do everything around the house: I cook all the meals, clean all the dishes, usually give the kids their baths, do all the grocery shopping (where I take the kids with me to give her some alone time).  

My wife is still very much depressed and extremely insecure about the weight she has gained since having children.  Before kids, she definitely was in great shape as she did CrossFit and ate well, and she is always saying how she can’t wait to start losing weight once the baby sleeps a little bit better. I actually do understand where she’s coming from here.  We are definitely in a tough season. 

 This Christmas will be the first time that every single person in my family, including spouses and kids will be together.  We really aren’t sure when this will happen again. My sister asked if we’d want to all get “dolled up” for a family picture, and my wife almost lost it. She said she doesnt want to take the picture because everyone is going to think of how fat she is.  She’s not nearly as big as she thinks she is, but my family are all in great shape, as we stay active and limit crap. So she is even more insecure for this reason.  She sent me a screenshot of a conversation with her best friend explaining how she doesn’t want to be in the picture, and her friend (who is always a victim enabler) said my family is clearly overstepping my wife’s boundaries.  

Since this baby was born,  I have offered to meal prep for her, take over nighttime feedings, ( baby really doesn’t take a bottle, but I have offered to Rock him when he’s not actually nursing so she can go back to sleep) and she will not let me. I give her a minimum two hours a day to herself, which should be used for whatever she wants to do, but she rarely does anything that would actually help her.  She often says she wants to start working out, but she usually just sits on the couch (which she has done all day) and eats potato chips and drinks wine to help her with her stress.  I have often suggested going for walks during the day and for her alone time, as it will help her. She gets really frustrated with me when I suggest that. I have typically bit my tongue about this issue until Christmas picture came up.  The boundaries thing just opened up a box with me. Her friend is extremely unhappily married, and literally has nothing in life that my wife and I want. 

I am beyond frustrated, because all she does is sit inside all day.  My wife never even goes as far as the park with the kids. She never goes on walks, and there are days on end where she does not even see sunlight. She just sits inside and holds the baby. She usually only leaves the house once a week to take the girls to gymnastics, and that is after I have gotten them completely ready to go, made my wife coffee to go, and have to wake her up to drive them there as I work. I get really frustrated knowing all the efforts and offers I have made to help her, yet she is refusing to change anything. The fact that me, the working dad (yes I work from home, but I am also at least 50% of the time seeing customers) am the one who takes the kids to the park 9/10 times. 

I am not saying this  to complain about my wife. I am choosing to love her during this difficult time.  I also know that me doing all of the things to help her seems like enabling, but it’s only been like this the last few months with the baby. 
I am just curious what I could actually do to help her here. I know this is not my wife. This is a postpartum and sleepless version of my wife.  But a version I’m worried will never change. I have never really let this bother me, until she reached out to the victim, enabling friend who said that my family is overstepping their boundaries by wanting to take a photo together. I am surprised and proud of how well I actually didn’t lose my shit in that moment, but internally this is really messing with me. Obviously it’s about more than a he Christmas picture, but It’s been a few days, and I’m still frustrated just thinking about it.  I will do everything necessary before even considering leaving her, but this thought had never once hit me until now. I’m so fucking mad, but really think I need to get her some professional help (which she is too stubborn to seek at the moment). 

 Does anyone have any good suggestions on how I can help her take responsibility and stop living like she is?  Or is this just a post partum thing I need to be patient with?
I really want to believe that life is going to get better when she starts sleeping and  her hormones balance out, but I honestly have some serious doubts.  


TLDR: wife doesn’t seem to have desire to get help, despite all of my efforts to support her. ",1,1730330432.0,postpartumprogress,30,0.67,False

# Wall Street Upvotes Reddit

Reddit just scored its first profit ever, and Wall Street is buzzing.

The internet’s favorite forum reported Q3 revenue of $348.4 million, a 68% jump year-over-year that smashed expectations. Net income hit $29.9 million, a huge swing from last year’s $7.4 million loss. 

The big news sent Reddit shares soaring 42%, tripling its value since going public in March—a huge win for a platform known for everything from meme stocks to life hacks.

**The Ad Game and AI Boost**  
  
What’s fueling Reddit’s rise? A smarter ad strategy and a healthy dose of AI. New ad formats, video placements, and sports partnerships are finally converting Reddit’s huge traffic into ad dollars. 

Meanwhile, Reddit’s data has become gold in the AI world—Google and OpenAI now license Reddit’s data to train their AI models, helping drive “other revenue” up 547% to $33.2 million. CEO Steve Huffman credits these changes for turning Reddit into a profit machine.

**User Surge and Global Reach**  
  
The numbers show Reddit’s user base is growing, too. 

Daily active users jumped 47% year-over-year to 97.2 million, with a 70% spike in logged-out visitors. Reddit’s new AI-driven translation features are drawing international traffic by the millions, and Huffman plans to keep that momentum going by making it easier for visitors to create accounts. 

With Reddit posts also ranking higher in Google search results, its influence is clearly on the rise.

**More Than Just a Forum**  
  
From data licensing to international expansion, Reddit is no longer just the internet’s quirky corner—it’s a serious revenue contender. As its user base and ad revenue grow, Reddit’s steady pivot from niche to mainstream has turned it into a profitable force in social media. 

For a platform born from open-forum debates, that’s no small feat.

# Echelon Of Earnings

* 💻 **Microsoft** shares ticked down 3.60% post-earnings after reporting Q3 revenue of $65.6 billion, surpassing Wall Street's $64.5 billion estimate. Profits also beat, coming in at $3.30 per share. AI contributed 12 points to Azure’s 34% growth, though data center limitations held back further gains. Meanwhile, rising AI-driven demand in its Office products and Bing boosted search ad revenue by 19% ($MSFT). 
* 📱**Meta** shares slipped slightly 3.06% after Q3 results showed $40.6 billion in revenue, a 19% increase year-over-year, beating Wall Street’s $40.3 billion target. Reality Labs, Meta’s AI and augmented reality arm, reported a $4.4 billion loss, as Zuckerberg aims to keep AI investments rolling. The company’s ad-targeting improvements, however, bolstered engagement, even as Wall Street questions the returns on its AI and AR bets ($META). 
* 💊 **Eli Lilly** dropped 6.28% after its weight-loss drugs Zepbound and Mounjaro came up $900 million short of expectations, attributed to inventory issues. Q3 revenue was $11.4 billion, below analysts’ $12.2 billion projection, and full-year guidance was cut by $600 million. Despite supply-chain fixes, analysts worry about demand as compounded drugs gain ground, posing a potential risk to Lilly’s future sales ($LLY). 
* ☕ **Starbucks** is undergoing a major strategy shift under new CEO Brian Niccol, who aims to reverse a 7% drop in Q4 same-store sales. Shares are up slightly since his hire, but challenges remain as Niccol plans to simplify Starbucks’ menu and refine mobile ordering. Investors await insights on how Niccol will drive growth in key markets, especially China, where the chain faces a tough competitive landscape ($SBUX). 
* 📉 **Robinhood** sank 11.38% in after-hours after Q3 net revenue of $637 million fell below the expected $663.5 million. A costly customer promotion, which offset revenue by $27 million, impacted the bottom line despite robust user growth in new products like crypto and futures trading. The company aims to attract more mature investors with recent expansions but faces challenges in turning promotional spending into sustainable revenue ($HOOD).

PCE is the inflation metric everyone’s watching—especially the Fed. Core PCE, the central bank’s go-to gauge, could tip the scales toward rate cuts if tomorrow’s reading stays low. All eyes will be on the data as it rolls in.

Initial jobless claims offer a weekly pulse on the labor market, though recent hurricanes might muddy the numbers a bit. Thankfully, the latest figures have held steady, keeping any labor market jitters at bay..

Analysts expect a -$0.39 EPS on $1.02 billion in revenue. ($RBLX)

# After Market Close:

* **Apple** has slightly underperformed the market as investors fret over growth, especially in iPhone 16 sales.

# Echelon Of Earnings

* 💻 **Microsoft** shares ticked down 3.60% post-earnings after reporting Q3 revenue of $65.6 billion, surpassing Wall Street's $64.5 billion estimate. Profits also beat, coming in at $3.30 per share. AI contributed 12 points to Azure’s 34% growth, though data center limitations held back further gains. Meanwhile, rising AI-driven demand in its Office products and Bing boosted search ad revenue by 19% ($MSFT). 
* 📱**Meta** shares slipped slightly 3.06% after Q3 results showed $40.6 billion in revenue, a 19% increase year-over-year, beating Wall Street’s $40.3 billion target. Reality Labs, Meta’s AI and augmented reality arm, reported a $4.4 billion loss, as Zuckerberg aims to keep AI investments rolling. The company’s ad-targeting improvements, however, bolstered engagement, even as Wall Street questions the returns on its AI and AR bets ($META). 
* 💊 **Eli Lilly** dropped 6.28% after its weight-loss drugs Zepbound and Mounjaro came up $900 million short of expectations, attributed to inventory issues. Q3 revenue was $11.4 billion, below analysts’ $12.2 billion projection, and full-year guidance was cut by $600 million. Despite supply-chain fixes, analysts worry about demand as compounded drugs gain ground, posing a potential risk to Lilly’s future sales ($LLY). 
* ☕ **Starbucks** is undergoing a major strategy shift under new CEO Brian Niccol, who aims to reverse a 7% drop in Q4 same-store sales. Shares are up slightly since his hire, but challenges remain as Niccol plans to simplify Starbucks’ menu and refine mobile ordering. Investors await insights on how Niccol will drive growth in key markets, especially China, where the chain faces a tough competitive landscape ($SBUX). 
* 📉 **Robinhood** sank 11.38% in after-hours after Q3 net revenue of $637 million fell below the expected $663.5 million. A costly customer promotion, which offset revenue by $27 million, impacted the bottom line despite robust user growth in new products like crypto and futures trading. The company aims to attract more mature investors with recent expansions but faces challenges in turning promotional spending into sustainable revenue ($HOOD).

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

PCE is the inflation metric everyone’s watching—especially the Fed. Core PCE, the central bank’s go-to gauge, could tip the scales toward rate cuts if tomorrow’s reading stays low. All eyes will be on the data as it rolls in.

Initial jobless claims offer a weekly pulse on the labor market, though recent hurricanes might muddy the numbers a bit. Thankfully, the latest figures have held steady, keeping any labor market jitters at bay..

# Before Market Open:

* **Roblox** took a beating in late September after a harsh report from short-seller Hindenburg Research. If the company manages to counter these claims, it could become a prime buying opportunity, given its rapid growth, strong cash reserves, and a young, expanding user base. Analysts expect a -$0.39 EPS on $1.02 billion in revenue. ($RBLX)

# After Market Close:

* **Apple** has slightly underperformed the market as investors fret over growth, especially in iPhone 16 sales. With demand dipping in China’s sluggish economy, Apple is ramping up its game with new AI software and fresh Mac hardware. CEO Tim Cook will be looking to reassure shareholders with a solid plan for future growth. Consensus: $1.60 EPS, $94.41 billion in revenue. ($AAPL) 
* **Amazon** still rules online retail, but all eyes are on its cloud segment, AWS, now a major revenue machine. With heavy investments in AI, AWS is primed for growth, though costs are a concern. Investors will be watching for signs that CEO Andy Jassy’s investments are paying off, especially as consumer spending slows. Consensus: $1.14 EPS, $157.14 billion in revenue.

Thought I'd share my experience with 12.5mg (and hopefully not jinx myself here).

SW:284lbs CW:223lbs Lost:61lbs

I've been on M for 6 months now! Finished my first 12.5mg pen in Oct, the two weeks was full of fatigue but my 3rd and 4th week has been pretty good! I have more energy and I feel better. Also surprising because I had my period in the 4th week and on 10mg I was so floored and the cramps were horrible but with 12.5mg I felt absolutely fine! 

Overall my nausea hasn't been as overwhelming as the other doses, I've not had much tummy or sick troubles and constipation is at bay. I've decided to stick to 12.5mg for the foreseeable future as long as I'm still feeling the right effects.

I've tried several ways of eating e.g 3 times a day etc, but what works for me is coffee for breakfast, my clear whey drink for lunch and a proper meal for dinner. I love the way my brain works now. I went to the shop earlier, felt like having some frozen desserts but thought ""I won't be able to finish a full sized one so I'll just buy the mini ones so I can still enjoy myself"". The old me would have thought ""no, I'm gonna buy the full sized one and eat a full plate as well"". 

On an unrelated note, I also dug out some clothes that I've kept hidden for the last 8 years because I couldn't fit in them, but to my surprise, some of them are actually loose! 

Anyway, thought I'd share my two bits just to say 12.5mg wasn't a scary experience for me 😊

Not sure if I made a good impression. On the first day of arrival, they weren’t expecting me. I was slightly disheartened as this is my first legal working experience. I had little to no communication from the firm but simply was told the name of the solicitor, the week starting and duration and the forms address. On the monday, they set me up with a few case files and that’s all I did during the week. Despite every day I asked if there is anything they would like me to do - make teas or coffees, whatever it was I wouldn’t have minded. I appreciate they’re doing me a favour. 

What typically is expected out of a vacation scheme? 

People I have spoken to have had mixed reviews. I wasn’t expecting a full on legal experience, maybe hoping to shadow a solicitor for a few hours (even if it was for two hours on the tuesday for example). I felt like a burden more than anything. I expressed myself as being helpful asking if there’s anything they would like for me to do - knowing full well I am not qualified but thought it was polite anyway. 

I feel as though I have made a bad impression with the firm, they appeared almost reluctant to acknowledge me, which is fair enough I’m there to be a fly on the wall - seen but not heared. I remained smiley and polite, but I couldn’t help but feel I should have just gone home. I was placed in a corner with a computer and left to my own devices. I have gained a few legal skills, but for my first legal experience. 

is this what all firms/VS are like? Or did I have bad experience?

1gg09sl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anticonsumption/comments/1gg09sl/sustainability_in_coffee/,Sustainability in coffee ,"Hello,

I hope I have come to the right place! I’m starting a small coffee roasting company focused on genuine sustainability, and I’m looking for advice on avoiding greenwashing in a world rife with it.

I’ve looked into a lot of different options but would still like to hear thoughts and suggestions from a community with a shared interest in anticonsumptionism and environmental impact. There is a lot of things I yet don't know, and there will always be room for improvement. 😊

Here are some of my key considerations:

1. I unfortunately haven’t figured out an alternative option for plastic bags. The bag must be airtight, and a zipper is a good solution. For bagging purposes, a one-way valve is quite important as well, though not strictly necessary. The bags I have thought of are made of mono material and also CO₂-compensated by the manufacturer. It's important to remember, a bag consisting of multiple different materials will make its recyclability much more challenging. 

Of course, there will be an option to refill a bag or use a container! 

2. I roast my coffee with an electric roaster that runs on green energy and is therefore CO₂-neutral.

3.1. Initially, I wanted to get in touch with micro coffee lots to be able to get to know the farmers and their practices thoroughly, as well as pay a fair amount, making sure the money goes to the farmers and not just the management. I am not sure this would be the best option for the environment because of individually shipped smaller orders of raw coffee. 

3.2. Working with a larger, ethical and sustainable sourcer could be less burdensome towards the environment. Larger order quantities and consolidated shipping potentiallu reduce the overall carbon footprint. It’s essential, though, to ensure that the sourcer is transparent, sustainable, ethical, and fair in their sourcing practices. The warehouse for the imported coffee would be located significantly closer to me than the nearest farms. 

4. For the average coffee, the majority, over 50%, of its carbon emissions come from synthetic fertilizers used on farms. Choosing shade-grown, organic coffee not only dramatically lowers environmental impact but may also helps the farm act as a carbon sink, as tree cover sequesters CO₂ and promotes biodiversity. 

5. I recycle all my produced waste that is recyclable, and the byproducts, such as coffee grounds and chaff, can be composted. I am also committed to compensating for all the CO₂ emissions I produce, ensuring that my operations are as carbon-neutral as possible.

This is a very small (passion) project, keep that in mind. I'd love to discuss this with you if you have any ideas or questions. Please also let me know where I'm not doing well. I will try my best in doing a good thing! Thank you for reading. 🙂",12,1730330140.0,Anticonsumption,4,0.88,False

She’s been sending mixed signals. For reference: 

- She’s quite introverted and shy. We met four times so far and still I often find myself doing most of the talking. She doesn’t do much to keep the conversation going. She also never texts first, but she responds to my texts in a timely manner 

- I’ve escalated by giving her hugs when I see her and she allows me to. So I’ve broken the touch barrier, but she doesn’t initiate anything physically 

- She’ll agree to see me most of times I propose to hang out. If she can’t make it then she’ll offer an alternate time instead of just flaking on me 

- Her eye contact is good, and I noticed that she fidgets quite a bit with her phone and touches her hair 

If it’s relevant, she comes from a more traditional family as we’re both Indian Canadian, so idk if she’s experienced with dating or talking stages. Regardless, on our fourth hangout today, I officially asked her out to go get coffee sometime and she said yes. So idk where she stands. Is this just about her having to send more time with me? Or is she just hanging out with me to “be nice”?

I want to talk to her more, but always get so nervous to do so and feel like it's not the right time or that I would be intruding. I don't want to keep waiting before it's too late and she becomes taken. Whenever I got into the library, I do notice that she sits a certain table pretty consistently, but I think she sits with her friends.

#History:

Felix was born im Luzern, Switzerland to a very busy father who never had much time for him. he never really had friends because most people found him weird, except for the boy living mext door named Liam. 

they stuck together until Liam had to move away when they were 13. they could only keep in contact online and Felix never made irl friends again after that.


#Present Day:

Felix could feel his skin *crawl*. seriously, what kind of an evil peraon invented airplanes? sitting in one place for 9 hours was bad enough but squished in between a window and some stranger was worse.

Now, he had finally collected his luggage when some asshole guy bumped into him and spilled coffee all over his shirt so he had to change into one of those god-awful ""I love NYC"" shirts. 

at least he found the strange guy picking him up fairly fast. the dude had eyes *all* over his body, which was kind of freacky but who was Felix to judge? he didn't make much conversation on the ride and thought over his current situation. maybe camp would be better than home? well, the standard for that wasn't that high.

When they finally arrived at Camp Half-Blood and a satyr began leading him around, Felix only half-listened. he needed a shower and a change of clothes right then because the crawling feeling was still there and if it didn't stop, he would lose it. 

After a well-needed shower, he was just sitting in front of the Clio cabin with his nose half-buried in 'The Odessey' and half people-watching.",1,1730329793.0,CampHalfBloodRP,0,1.0,False

Mother went to be early again so I had plenty of time to write. Sadly, I couldn't quite reach the heights of the night before. I wrote 436 words.

All week I'd been idly describing her in my head but the moment I reached her intro, the words like an untrained wolf wouldn't come to me no matter how much I called. Sometimes that's just how it goes. Hopefully, it comes to me tonight. I do like all the words I did manage to write, a lot of it about one of the main characters thoughts and perspectives. I can say I did a good job of that at least.

Anyway, as for today, it was surprisingly warm. If not for the leaves littering the ground and the overcast clouds you could mistake it for a spring day, even early summer. We cut down the last of the pepper plants, brought a few in, and even harvested some peppers I missed and some tomatoes from the neighbours plant. A lot of work ,but we are nearly ready for winter. The bugs were brutal. Ladybugs all over the place, swarming into the house every time you open the door. Several flew into my shirt and it took a lot of effort to get them out without crushing them. And then's theres the tiny bastards that bite from whom I have no other name.

It is garbage night, so we will have to deal with that. The brown bags are ready, we emptied all the halloween candy into buckets so we can throw out the boxes. There is a little more to be done but for now I can relax. The next saga for Epic the musical is dropping in two hours so I will certainly enjoy watching that with my evening coffee. After all that, I'll be back to writing. Here's hoping my descriptive words are a little more well-behaved tonight.

Since I got covid 1 year ago I have had chronic and somewhat debilitating sinus issues that never went away. I visited several doctors including 2 ENT's (who either gave steroids or recommended surgery) and several alternative care practitioners including 3 acupuncturists. 

Steroids helped but I don't think it's ideal to be on them indefinitely and the symptoms came straight back when I stopped. 

I was afraid that the surgery route wasn't addressing the rout cause and possibly wouldn't work permanantely so I wanted to try other methods.

I tried EVERYTHING to relieve my symptoms which would wake me up in the middle of the night and made for miserable mornings: blowing my nose and sneezing for several hours, brain fog, fatigue, etc. Humidifier, nasal rinse, steam, massage, hot compress, vocal exercise. I tried nasal probiotics and kimchi in case it was fungal (although I had a CAT Scan where that probably would have shown up).  I tried a keto diet, Whole 30 and even did a 72 hour water fast. Nothing helped. 

A couple weeks ago I stumbled on a thread about MCAS (Mast Cell Activation Syndrome) that can be caused by covid and it felt like it might be an answer for me. Although I don't have any other symptoms besides extremely swollen turbinates and stuffed up nose, it did seem like a possibility I had this. So I cut out my regular tea and coffee, avoided walnuts, eggs, banana and avocado which I was eating daily and took an antihistamine and the next morning to my surprise I woke up for the first time in a year without having to blow my nose! I had even had a glass of warm milk and honey the night before (I had avoided dairy for months). 

I also started taking immune boosting supplements. 

I've been on this diet for a week and aside from a few hiccups (like drinking bone broth which I didn't realize was high histamine) I am feeling so much better. I'm still not 100% but I've been able to rest through the night without waking in horrible sinus pain and pressure and the mornings don't require 1 hour of blowing my nose before I'm human. In fact the mucus is like 10% of what it was.

1gfzwaa,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gfzwaa/iatah_for_being_jealous_over_a_girl_that_have/,IATAH for being jealous over a girl that have nothing with me?,"For some context, lets start with presentations, i (19)M and Her (22)F, been sticking together for 8 months now. But i have a little bit of contextualization to tell about how we endedup in the situation we are in now.

It was the start of the year (2024), and i work at a small town credit cooperative that have somo support for the local university, hoping to start a new socialization life, realizing that i'm very bad at communicating, hoped that this social experience would help me increase my social skills. So i went and made my way into the university. Worst mistake of my life. When i first got in i was already doing another college degree, so when i get in the university i was already in the third semester of the course. Meaning by that, considering a small town (60.000 habitants) i was in the same class of some ""friends"" of my best friends, they knew each others and had some talk while in highschool. I sat alone hoping no one was looking for any talk with me, letting behind all my feelings of better social skills, until, lets call him Aug. Aug used to chat a little with my best friend and call me to sit with his friends, Laf(20), Louis(19) and her ""A""(22). 

There i met ""A"", a weird like girl, not weird in a way that she is crazy, but weird in a way that you cant get some details unnoticed, like her two sided blue striped hair, and her dirty coffee like yellow shoes with a black sundress that would make any man go crazy. Anyway, at the time i was not hoping for nothing, taking in consideration that i was only for studying and trying to get better at my skills.

The group received me pretty well, at the end we are all nerds that talked about souls like game, minecraft, stardew valley and all this geek stuff. We got along very well. But i got along a little bit too much with ""A"".

One day she was complaining about her notebook being too slow, being the IT guy and ready to learn new things, i got the job. I saw that as a opportunity to get better at the physical part of my job, considering i was pretty decent at the logical problems i had to solve as IT.

I got completely destroyed by the notebook and had to run for my older brothers help. He manage to kind solve the problem but i gave her back completely well. I failed and as a man. I was personally give her back the notebook and sadly say that i didn't manage to make it well. She said that all that counted was my effort and gave me 2 chocolate truffles. I was sad, but hey i got reward!!

After that, things went kind good, we start to talk a lot, and realized that we had a lot in common not only childhood experiences, but all kinds of habits and musical and anime taste. I was liking her, but knew i was just a pretty good friend, like someone to talk about all kinds of stuff. She was also in the the time really liking a guy lets him Ed(22)M, he was the kind of selfish, good talk guy. She was friends with him in her childhood, but ended up going out with him. I'm the time she get pretty messed up by him. He would say things like, ""you are to fat, should lose some weight"" and ""Your hair it's too big you should cut it"" or ""Look this guy, its talking to you just to fuck you"" and things like that. She was never really good of her head, she took a lot of black stripe medicaments and started to like and get obsessed with him. Would always ask me on why doesn't he like me, or why would he not want to be with her and stuff like that. It was pretty fucked up. Some time passed, she kept  in this kind of 'transe' about him.

Sometime gets by, we get more and more talkative by the day. And, in her birthday. I gave her some chocolates and some candies, i remember leaving my shift ate 10PM because i knew she would be close by my job (small city stuff), she work just around 5 minutes from me. She said me later on that got really surprised from my gift, and that Ed didn't gave her not even congrats on her birthday. I stayed util 2 PM talking and saying stuff like, ""He's just prob busy"" or ""He is crazy not liking someone like you"" and so in the instagram DM she started a auto erased chat (that kind that vanishes when you see the message) making a joke about me being virgin lips witch was not true but i kind entered the joke and said like ""yeah i'm (crying emoji"" and then she replied with a ""wanna lose it then""? and went sleep.

That night i thought really hard about what was said, but let it go. I didn't want any kind of stuffy like that with her, just seeing her as a pretty cool person to talk.

Time gets by, our university make a game tournament in the center of the city, i went all in group and had some fun, that day she painted her hair all purple. I was embarrassed, purple is my favorite color, i had never seen most beautiful girl in my life. Early that day i had send her a video about ""When girls really want a guy."" And its a 50 seconds long video of a girl just staring the eyes wide open to the camera. She did the exact same thing to me for 30 seconds or so in the middle of the crowd. I was first scared, but then realized about the video and got like, oh no. Right here i think it was my first mistake. I had a friend at the time, that was also in the tournament. And he was pretty close from Ed. This friend said, that Ed was actually a fucker and really just wanted to use her and would go for her just to fuck and leave. Then i spoke to him that she's been acting kind flirt in my Dm's, not only the kinds i said here, but saying stuffs like ""I must be your kind of girl, because you like the girls that act a little crazy"" and this kind of stupid stuff. My friend, said to me take care of her, and not lek Ed do the things he wanted. I was like right, i think that's its a universal signal for doing something right, i think i got things to make her happy. I can be the guy that will make this girl happy im on it. 

  
But now i kind need to stop the story and talk about how my head worked that time.

I work for this credit cooperative, and my boss, was a pretty know professor in the university. He make my head into it, because he thought i had a lot of potencial to learn new stuff there. So in october 2023 ( i hate remembering even the that), was the first time i saw her. The university had this like ""workshops"" that they get some profissional in the area to talk about something, my boss willing to make me feel confortable at going to the university send me to watch the workshop about network management. She was there, saw her for the first time there. she doesn't even remember it, but i do. Remember about how she messed all the cables, and i went to help her, how she had a beautiful sundress that day, and her smile when it worked it was very... Cool i guess.

The next Workshop was the next day, she was there too, i didn't talk to her, and stood listening to her talking about her calcifer tatoo (Howl's moving castle) and how i thought that no fucking way a girl this cool would like me, and got back to my business in class.

Fast forward to December, when i was late night walking in the center of the city and i saw her dressed as a Elf in a christmas parede and started to laugh like really loud, she looked me dead in the eye., I couldn't hide my face.  
I'm just saying all this stuff, because i kind knew i was meet her in the university, didn't thought much of it until my friend tell me to give her a good love experience make me thought in the time that it was some kind of universal signal saying to me that i had to try with her. And not that, but just working in the cooperative i do was pretty much timing ( My mother posted a pic of my in my first day at a market shift and a friend of her send me to make the interview in the cooperative).  
So all the things that i did and happened to me, kind leaded me to meet her in that specific time. At least was that what i thought in the time.

  
Getting back, after this, i started to get a little flirt, having in mind that she ditch Ed and tried to move on her own. And for my surprise, she actually responded very well, and even flirted back.. So i was happy and shocked, never thought that something like that would ever happen to me, and make me get pretty happy with it. But i kept it the idea of taking things slow.

She started to going out with a guy, that lives in a neighbor city. He was a friend from the group that started university there and move on. I was fine with it, didn't had any big feelings for her and we decided that we would meet this guy in a party at his city, where he was going. At that time Laf the friend of the group was getting a lot of tries from lets call her LAU (20)F, he was pretty happy with it, we even had a inside joke about her ""liking star wars"", because one day he was all happy in the class because she said that liked it, and it was just a hint that ""A"" said to her that would make him want her. So we went, Me, ""A"", Laf, LAU, Louis, Fab (another friends) and this other city guy lets call him ""V"" for now on.  
Getting there we start to drink and get all drunk, she kissed ""V"" and LAU tried to kiss Laf, but he reject her all night ( later on this will make sense). At some point of the night ""A"" tried to kiss me. I even have a foto of the moment she raised her feet to reach me. I gently put her down, because i thought it was not right to do anything to her while she as with ""V"".

After that the hell actually starts.  
We kept contact after the party, because well, we still talked very well and had some really good conversations, i was still kind flirt, be now she as all into it. So much, that at some point, i make a joke about man getting titties is all hes need. And she send me a one visualisation pic of her eyes ( i love her eyes and she knew that because of the lil flirts) saying you think it was titties right? And i really thought it was, but i kept it funny and send back stuffs like ""OMG I CANT BELIEVE YOU REALLY THEM TO ME"" ""LOL I LIKET IT"" and ""I DINDT REALLY TOUGHT YOU WOULD SEND EM"" them she got desperate and i said it was all jokes that she actually send it right and bla bla bla, but them BOOM she actually hit me her nude pics. And for most because of HONRY TEENAGER it was like, wow, this shit is good. For now on, we kept trading pics and she kept sending hot pics and hot comments all of the sudden.

I thought that she had parted with ""V"" and now we would actually had something. Until some months later, we kept messages, talking about everything and all the stuff we had in comumn and i heard that ""V"" was staying the weekend in her house, because Louis is Bi and the used to kept chatting about boys and stuff ( He always wanted to fuck ""V""). I get really sad, because i thought that, even we being slow and all. she would not had with any other guys, guess i was wrong. Laf was also very sad, he didn't talk to her all week in university.

Well here is the part that i regret the most. I had some really serious talk with her some week later ( we still talk a lot and kept messaging hot stuff with eachother). See by know the story is being telling from my vision, my old vision, not knowing all the stuff i know about all this cases know. I think it will all make sense in the future. But for now lets keep straight, i talked to her for hours, and she said that she really likes me, but didn't want any kind of relashionship YET because of ED, i was very jeaolous because she make out with V and i thought i was not that close from her, she said that it was not it and we should keep chating about all this stuff and if for me it was ok, it was. But get very clear in the ""not ready YET"", this phrase will hang me for the rest of the history.

we kept hot texting for 1 month.

And for the sake of the history i gotta tell that i'm not a good person, and i actually would ask her a lot about ""V"" and all the stuff she was making with him, for register thats not good, not really manly of me. I was insecure and scare, because see, i think i fall in love with her in the moment we had to make a class work, it was to create a game. I get in call for like 5 hours in discord, and talk about litelly everthing, she kept saying that didn't believe that we had so much in common and we make a spotify match (95%!!) and a jam to kept listening while we would sprite the game off. This was like 2 months from August the month. So even if its not cool for my part, i actually was pretty Jeolous of ""V"" for having 'more' for her than me, even we had nothing solid in the time, not even kissed yet. And i don't liked in the time to feel the way i fell, August the friend, was close from her and said to me that she really wanted something serious with ""V"", what make me wounder and argue with her in the time about what she wanted with me. Because the ""no wanting a relashionship YET"" really made me think that she dind't want any stuff with no one, and there was her, crying to August about how much she wanted him to like her and that stuff. I was pretty mad and get very sad, we talk it out with her saying that Laf was liking her and that i was the closer person to her in the moment. Today, i realise that, probably was actually that, but in the time and didn't think that way.

Until we reach August. Where i finally get to go to her house alone. We make the excuse to make a cake she was pretty, using that classic sundress, no panties, and was willing for me to actually make out with her, we did the cake and she start to had an anxiety crises, because her ex, lets call him ""Marc"" was texting her asking what's she was doing and if he could come. She had the crises because he as pretty much toxic, not letting her using the clothes she likes and even talk to other guys, or go out with her friends (bad guy) he even would follow her everywhere after they breakup, pretty fucked things. Whatever she declined, but i didn't do anything with her, and called my mother to get me in her house. When the car reaches and i was going to the door to leave, she kissed me. It was great, in not a really into phisycal touch guy, but damn that shit hit me like a train...

After that she keeping teasing me and calling me virgem, because i didn't do anything to her that day and she had do kiss me, and kept saying how i kissed ""slow and very well"", and i kept saying you had an anxiety crises what was i supposed to do, she said that she always had it want that i was a virgem and scary boy. From this on, i was full in love. Was visiting her all days in the job, giving her stuff and all this lover boy crap.

I remember some talks about this month, but one i cant let go. One day we went to Laf house and found some used condoms and we kept teasing him about it, because he was de definition of virgem and all stuffs. My mom give her a ride, getting home she replied to me how she was having ""gay feelings"" about me treating my mom well, and how it makes turned on. Than we traded pics.

So in the end of August we start to get distant, and i ask her why? She said that needed time and i agree with it, until a whole month were i basicaly did nothing and only had small chats make that make me wonder why? August told me that she tried to get very serious with ""V"" and he said he didnt want nothing with her in the start of August (the month). That killed me, my anxiety really kicked in, and i thought, well i'm fucked. Fallen in love with someone that don't want nothing with me. I went her dm's saying all kinds of stuff, like why would you kiss me and say all kinds of stuff to me like why, and she replied that she was confused and want something with him but in a way that she knew he don't give a fuck so she won't have a big maintence over him etc etc. We talked a lot that night. I even remember she saying that he was basically nothing to her. Two one week later in the end of August, we make out. It was great. I didn't actually ""penetrated"" her, but i maded her cum, and she said i was the second person in her life to do it, and that she was really impressionated by it. The next three days, was me and her only talking about how great it was and when we would make again and them, boom, vanished. She start to ignore me, or being less responsive, and i thought ok thats fine shes just not in the mood. During all September i kept asking if she was fine, and why was she moving me away, she kept saying that she dindt want nothing sexual with nobody now it was matter of time until she get back into the mood, and I COMPLETELY understands that. I ceased all hot talk, but of course always asking with she was fine until one day the HORNY me replied, as usual she put me back and said i don't want to talk sexually with nobody for now. I said fine and moved on.

In university Laf was all happy for receving a boob pic. I asked him if i could see the woman, just to not hit on her by accident (small town), he said no. That would make a big climate in the group. There. I knew, i got close to him and said. ""Dude i think i know who it is"", is it ""A""?  
He confirms. And i say to him, bro, not wanting to say something to fuck with you or anything, but i'm kind with her too. He cried a lot that, later i found it was just scene.

Turns out they are 'hanging out' since the party in the other City, just like me. But he kept hitting on her until her tried something with him. At the time they only kissed. And she only kissed him in the a day where they two where running, she found ED in the street and had a crises, kissed him and LATER ON HE WENT HOME , SHE STARTED TO MESSAGE HOT STUFF TO ME, i was MAD, REALLY MAD after Laf tould me that was the first and only time they kissed.

Stop talking to her for weeks, During all September. One day she calls me to resolve.

Turns out, she, Laf and Louis, had some kind of 3 way kiss, because Loius had just ended his relashionship and Laf was really into her. Now we enter in other stuff, Louis is friends with Laf for years, he really likes Laf, but knows he does not back. Laf sayed he would kiss Louis if she Kisses him. They did it. Louis even gives Laf a BJ.

From this on was when she start to avoid sexualy in september. Well it all ended, she telled me so much stuff when we talked in the of setember

She sai stuff like, i was with ""V"" becausa was easy, and Laf dosent mean nothing to me. And the words i still remember. I will NEVER make out with any of you guys again.

That broken me, i knew she dosent wanted a relashionship, but this stands we had, was the closest thing i could have with her YET, saying that really maked me sad.

We didnt resolve nothing

i avoided her for one week, after that talk. We didnt really make it in a way that we bouth would be happy.

I eventually talk it out in dms and personally, we agreed that we dont know what we are, but she likes to speak to me, and that she would make a lot of things to had me back in her life. She said that she was not more making nothing with Laf and that would not. It was a lie. i figure out recently too.

Well, we finally reach october, nowdays. We start talk again, and start to message hot stuff again, after i had  A LOT OF BREAKDOWNS i got back go her. I hate it. Its impossible to avoid her. And well 26 october, i knew she was still flirting with Laf and Me, we went to LAu place and played some drink games, i was with her all night and start to teasing her, silly hands all that. UNTIL

LAF STARTED TO DISPUT HER WITH ME, she endend up just being far from us. I get mad

28 octber i went into her house, and the make out. In the end i remembered that laf spoke in the drink game that he fucked with her, later on she tell me it was a lie, see he was actyually virgem, and couldn't make it get hard and start almost crying, this was 3 before she said that was not making nothing with him, and would not.

Well in the end today i fucked up. After the drink party me and laf agreed to tell each others when we would hit on her for we not have any disput.

Today we dont have class and i tould me and her could make it out, so i asked laf if he had the same idea and he answered me in the most jerk way possible. E started to saying to her, seeing that she dindt want to do nothing with me today that if she was unconfortable with me she could say and i would stop.

Laf tould her that i asked him that, and know she is kind pissed with me.

In the end i only did this because i was insecure. I like her, really much. But i cant keep on doing this stuff. I feel bad for acting like a jerk, but my insecurity dont allow me to really be confident with anything. I Figure that only being pacient would lead me to better resumes of the story, but how can i go on with this? Should i leave her before we destroy eachothers, should i try to be the one? 

I dont really know. We bouth are pretty ""toxic"" with each other, she ask me about girls i talk and all, but how can i move on such a big love i feel for her, and how can i, we bascically in the same place for 4 hour all days of the week...

I dont know what to do

Now probably she is talking with Laf, and it kills me. I really should find a   


    psychologist.

1gfzuj9,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1gfzuj9/think_im_too_naive_for_dating_apps/,Think I’m too naive for dating apps,"

I’m someone who rarely uses dating apps for just fun. Don’t get me wrong, I do and I do go on meets, but I am trying to find something a bit more like a relationship than just fuck.

I just don’t understand guys intentions and think I’m just a bit naive, wish I could just move on and forget something but I feel such an urge to just go back to a guy on some things.

My example is I was chatting to someone older than me. I popped up to him, just said he was good looking, he said it back, we spoke about ourselves and got on, exchanged numbers and spoke more then went about our day.

The next day, he messaged me on the app, we spoke more again, he suggested we meet up for a coffee or something. We didn’t really mention sex much when talking, but he did suggest to meet up for a chat and date almost so I was good with that.

The next day, I messaged him and it was like a light switch. Blunt,not overly chatty. He’d reply, but not really continue the convo. I thought about post nut clarity but then thought, he didn’t even have any nudes from me, we didn’t talk much about sex, and he’s now making excuses to meet, after he was the one that suggested it and said he’ll check when he’s free and he was the one that messaged me starting a convo the next day.

I sent another message a couple of days later asking if he was still up for meeting at all and he can tell me if not. 
He told me what he liked about me, found me attractive but was now worried about age and how we lived an hour from each other. 
I guess me being hopeful took “worried” as there’s still a possibility and I also thought - this isn’t binding, we could just meet as friends that may get together for some fun. I told him I can accom. 

I sent messages the next couple of days and again, got replies, but not really continuing the conversation.

I guess I’m a bit too innocent for this game but I just want to know what went wrong? What happened? 
I left it and the couple of weeks later saw he was online, so sent a message just asking how he was. Again, he replied, didn’t ask me back how I was, I replied, he replied, and then he just made himself appear offline (which you can tell).

I just thought, seriously? Could have just not replied or even blocked me. Id get the picture then. I feel like messaging and just asking what changed, did he really just shoot a load over a pleasant chat and decide “not for me”. I don’t understand how guys can just fall off like that.

I know I should just let it go and don’t know why I care about someone I hardly know being blunt with me but I just feel like sending one final message saying something like “not sure what happened, you don’t even seem keen to chat as potential friends when you were so lovely before and keen to know about me. you’ve got my number if you want to contact me or just block me and I’ll get the clear picture”.

I know comments will just tell me to just forget it but for some reason it’s really stuck with me. Like I said, maybe I’m too naive.",0,1730329002.0,askgaybros,2,0.5,False

The Fine Art of Chasing Milliseconds.,"Welcome to my self published masterpiece “The Fine Art of Chasing Milliseconds” there’s not TLDR, so buckle up buckaroo and read on if you want to become a professional chair. 



**What’s Actually New?**

Today’s update brought some netcode and tick rate tweaks that have noticeably shifted TTK values. I’ve played one game and it’s already felt smoother with less kill trading. 

**Pre patch (I think introduced in Season 2)**, the firing range was giving us fixed values like **0.37 and 0.43 seconds** for TTK, locking us into just those intervals. 

**Post patch**, we’re now seeing **more precise values** like **0.35, 0.36, 0.38, 0.40 and 0.41 seconds and so on**. This added level of precision gives weapons a bit more variability and might make certain setups feel smoother or more consistent in close range encounters. 

Clearly, we’ve entered a new dimension of decimal points (or what was around in Season 1). And while milliseconds aren’t the end all, it’s just enough variation to give certain setups an edge. 

Let’s break it down. These are firing range tests and not from the massive spreadsheet I've made for every automatic weapon that's up to cells AG1...



**ACR**

* **Base TTK**: \~0.41 seconds
* **With Rapid Fire**: 0.40 to 0.41 seconds
* **With Muzzle Booster**: 0.41, occasionally 0.40



**AK-47**

* **Base TTK**: 0.43 seconds
* **With Rapid Fire**: 0.41 seconds
* **With Muzzle Booster**: 0.43 seconds, occasionally 0.41



**MDR**

* **Base TTK**: 0.40 seconds
* **With Rapid Fire**: 0.38 seconds
* **With Muzzle Booster**: 0.38/0.30 50/50
* **With Heavy Barrel**: 0.36 seconds



**LVOA**

* **Base TTK:** 0.38/0.40 seconds 50/50
* **With Rapid Fire**: 0.38 seconds (40% 0.40 seconds)
* **With Muzzle Booster and Lightweight Barrel**: 0.38 seconds sometimes 0.36 seconds



**M4A1**

* **Base TTK:** 0.41/0.43 seconds 50/50
* **With Rapid Fire**: 0.40 seconds (40% 0.41 seconds)
* **With Muzzle Booster and Lightweight Barrel**: 0.40 to 0.41 seconds (60% 0.41 seconds)



**M16A4**

* **Base TTK**: 0.41 seconds - 0.43 seconds
* **With Rapid Fire**: 0.41 seconds - 0.43 seconds
* **With Muzzle Booster**: 0.41 seconds - 0.45 seconds
* **With Heavy Barrel**: 0.36 to 0.38 seconds but chance of 4 bullet burst for 0.18/0.21 seconds 10-20% of the time



**TLDR: What’s the New META?**

Alright, look… I said there wouldn’t be a TLDR because we’re all supposed to go out and “feel” the guns but here it is anyway because I’m a sucker for irony.

First off, the MDR with Heavy Barrel is king. Yep, that 0.36 TTK is no joke, so slap on a red dot and hold on for dear life because the recoil’s going to kick harder than your morning coffee. This thing shreds, no warm up required.

ACR and AK-47? Old faithfuls, as always. They’re here to get the job done without giving you a heart attack. Meanwhile, the LVOA and M4A1 are there for consistency, solid, reliable and not trying to reinvent the wheel.

And about those 0.01 seconds for attachments. Do they matter? Nah, not really. 

Ubisoft blessed us with some extra precision, so we might as well enjoy it. Go, test your setups (or copy mine) and find the one that makes you feel just a little bit invincible.

Looking for advice","I was accepted for the MBA program at Glasgow, Edinburgh and Durham for their respective 25/26 cohort. I am 36 years young already with a bachelors degree from CSU in the US as well as a Master of Accountancy from the University of Denver. 

I have already looked at the rankings for the programs I have been accepted to and from an international perspective it looks as though it’s:

1. Durham
2. Edinburgh 
3. Glasgow

I’m not concerned with the price of the program but more the overall experience and living in the UK afterwards, most specifically Scotland. This leaves me with a difficult decision on the university to choose as a result. Other background information is that I love historical places, live music as I left high school and played guitar in an alternative rock band, love coffee and dogs as well. 

Please give me your opinion as to which university you think would be in my best interest with my overall objectives!",1,1730328928.0,ukeducation,0,1.0,False

I have had several religious friends do similar ministry work ""full-time,"" which always only amounts to them grabbing coffee with college kids 3x a week to try to convert them, and calling it ""college ministry."" To reiterate, they are not ""serving the city"" by doing any tangible volunteer work, their whole ministry is solely based on evangelism. They also never specify what donations go towards, either... probably because it's just covering their rent so they don't have to get a real paying job.

The absolute delusion and nerve to ask someone you have not talked to in years to just give you free money so you can vibe is just something else!

I haven't responded yet because I don't know what to say. I will not be giving her any money, and I'm not a religious person anymore so prayers aren't really my thing either. I hate to completely burn a bridge, but also wtf.",82,1730328810.0,exchristian,27,1.0,False
