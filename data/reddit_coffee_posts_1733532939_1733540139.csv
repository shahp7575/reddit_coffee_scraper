I (21M) am in college now, this is my third year. For context, I did theatre in high school and to be honest it was a pretty bad experience for me looking back (as was high school as a whole), full of hierarchy and a fair amount of bullying as well.

Anyway, I have pretty much stopped talking to anyone I went to high school with. Nothing in specific happened but I just got new friends at college and got closer to them.

So basically my neighbor Anna and her boyfriend Carson did theatre with me in high school for the time we are at school together (they are two years younger than me). Both of them go to my university now—and I’ll still talk to both of them, as I grew up with Anna and Carson is a pretty sweet guy.

Long story short, we met up a few weeks ago for coffee. Carson said he was going back to the high school (our hometown is like an hour ish drive from school) to see the November theatre production. He asked if I was gonna go see it too, and I kinda scoffed and said “Hell no,” and laughing a bit said “I did not peak in high school, I am not going back there”. Carson looked all upset and got quiet for the rest of our time at the coffee shop.

It’s been a few weeks and I’ve seen Anna once or twice but not Carson. I’m debating whether or not I was wrong for what I said, but I do have to say I’m glad I didn’t peak in high school lmao. Still, I don’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings.

TLDR

Short story is, my partner became addicted to gambling, I found out after she had lost £75k over a couple of years sports betting. Our annual income was about half that, no savings, so this all went on as debt. Loans, credit cards. She looks after our finances, and continued to do so, afterwards. Did it again a few years later, this time with leveraged crypto trading, lost another 75k in under a year. To say this has put a strain on our relationship would be an understatement. We are now all but broken up, still living together, but I was hoping she was going to take steps to solve her issues, and so we could work on ours for the betterment of us and our kids and their future, but instead I have found that she is labelling me as a domestic abuser and getting confirmation left right and center from gambling addiction forums and a counsellor.

I'm shaking writing this, I just can't believe it. I mean I can, but I can't. What can I do?

Long story is, our relationship was always a bit up and down. She seemed to have issues with low self esteem. This is what she described as her problem early on as to why we kept falling out. She'd do things like flirt with other men in front of me to make me jealous because she felt I was losing interest sexually. Her plan was I would fight for her. Instead I was disgusted with her and very upset. At the time I walked away. Then when we were alone I asked what that was about, and she said I had imagined it. She had her arm round the guys waist ffs. Maybe a week later, could be longer as I can't remember how it came back up, maybe it was a week long rocky patch, but she apologised and explained why she did it.

There have been various instances like this, sometimes her apologising soon after, sometimes weeks or even years later after having me believe it was in my head. One particular event that messed me up for a good while was her rape story. One drunken evening she was telling me a story of how she was on a night out with some girl friends and they ended up back at a flat with bunch of guys. One of the girls wanting to get it on with one of the guys and then others pairing off. I asked if she did anything with anyone. She said no. She said one guy was coming on to her, but she just fell asleep on the sofa. She woke up to him walking off pulling off a condom. I was dumbstruck... To me this sounded like rape, possibly even date rape given how suddenly murky she said it all was, and I said so. Not a lot more was said, but after that I really beat myself up thinking that I had just broken it to her that she was raped and she had never put that together herself. She was happily ignorant and then I opened my stupid mouth! She'd just found out that 20 years ago she was raped, and I broke it to her. Horrible. Years later she told me that story again. Except it changed, almost like she had forgotten about the rape angle. I didn't think much of it, I didn't want to, but years later, again it had changed. She's completely forgotten about him walking off removing the condom, she's changed it to we had sex, but I didn't really want to and just wanted it to end. While this is sad and all, I was broken by this. I had silently given myself so much shit for a decade over the idea that I had broken it to her that she was raped. All these years, and she had just let me.

The fact of the matter is, I think the gambling, while an illness, is actually a symptom of something else, something she is not dealing with. She has said low self esteem and I have spent years trying to find ways to help her. She stopped driving, so we bought another car just to be hers. The most expensive car in the household. It sat for about 2 years, but eventually she started driving it. I tried to encourage her to drive, by saying lets go for a short drive but she would always put it off and then started reacting angrily as if I was trying to stress her out by mentioning it. So I stopped mentioning it. We still talked about it now and then when she'd bring up that she needed to get driving, but just left it with her.

We had a son, which took her away from our business which we started together. She felt that the business was my baby, something to be proud of and she had nothing, her words. I was gutted she felt that way as it was always our creation and I told her all the ways it was hers and how it would never have happened without her. She seemed to appreciate this. I also tried to find more ways for her to be involved. She ended up doing all the admin which she wanted so now I was just a workshop monkey. I was drawing up plans to make a child safe office/play area so that we could work together at the workshop again. She never showed any interest so it never happened. We were both pretty depressed about money. Our designs had been copied by a larger competitor, so we always struggled while they made millions. We saw them buy a £900k house, an Aston Martin, a convertible BMW for her, posh holidays. Hard not to feel dead inside, irony aside. I was working my arse off in the workshop, but she complained that we needed more sales, we were not making money. I couldn't understand it, with the amount of work I was doing, it didn't add up. She took my confusion as an attack, same old story. Low self esteem, takes everything as an attack. Sure I was looking to her for answers, she does our books, she does all our finances, I didn't even know my online banking details at the time, she did it all, but I didn't mean it as an attack. This is how it would always go, she'd get defensive and start accusing me of attacking her. As soon as that happens I have to be very careful, it is incredibly frustrating, but if I bite then she wins, I am the angry bad guy. Same again the following year, now I'm really smelling a rat, where the hell is all the money.

We had been through a short phase of gambling together. First just silly bets on Eurovision, then we discovered arbitrage. Quickly learned we couldn't make much from that, and bookies banned us for our strange betting. We didn't bet much, and gave up pretty quick. She had a go with tennis betting, because after being home so much with the tennis in the background, she felt she knew her stuff. We agreed a couple of hundred could be her pot to experiment with, once it's gone it's gone. She told me she was making small gains and felt really confident in her knowledge. At the time I told her she should try trading bitcoin. Secretly this is what I wanted to be doing but never had the disposable income to put some into bitcoin. Instead I had watched it all the way from £10 and did nothing. Definitely could have afforded to lose £20 back then, just about. Wish I had taken the punt. Anyway, a month later I said ""you still got your pot?"" She said not much and that she had given up on it. I agreed this was for the best. Actually relieved.



Fast forward a year, turns out she never stopped, and after 2 years, she was losing £500 a day on average. When I first found out I was in shock. I asked her about it, she tried to deny it, but she had left her laptop open and I could see the daily £500 deposits. She broke down, a horrible deep crying noise. It's horrible to say, but part of me misses that crying sound. It's perhaps the last time I ever thought she was truly sorry. All I could say is ""what have you done?"" with my face in my hands. Eventually I came to my senses enough to ask how much? She told me everything would be fine, she will do what ever it takes to make it right. She will get a job to pay it off, it was just a £10k loan she had through her mum, she had only lost 10, maybe 15k. Then a bit later, maybe £20k, but definitely no more than that. I genuinely think she believed this 'final answer'. At the time, we had a house, 70K down, 200k mortgage, interest only. Renewal coming up in a year. I thought shit we're going to lose the house. Worse than that, I thought we were done, and she was going to take my son, so I was losing him. I decided I needed to see everything, all accounts, gambling, banks, emails, everything. I drove to work to go through it all alone and found that it was £75k over 2 years. Mostly in the 2nd year. Looking at the deposits I got angrier and angrier, then the relentless, hopeless £500 deposits going in bang, again, and again, I could feel her desperation and I felt so sad for her going through all that alone. Very angry for doing this to us, and for making me feel like I wasn't doing enough at work. All the fallouts where I knew something was off, but she would convince me it was in my head or she would just apologise and blame low self esteem or just being low or something. And angry looking at the times involved. She had been gambling while I had my head in her lap of an evening. Gambling all day long when she said she wanted to be at home for our son. I had been suspicious that he seemed desperate for attention when I got home from work, even though he should have had it most of the day. I'm not sure I ever brought this up. No way I could have manoeuvred that minefield, but it all made sense now. Still I was gutted for her at the same time, and this was the emotion that made my mind up, and I decided I would go home and support her. My words were, you have a sickness, but I am an ""in sickness and health kinda guy, we will get through this"".



I came up with a plan which involved refinancing a load of bad debt. I think I got 30 or 40k in loans. Not great interest, but better than the credit cards she had. We would cut back and live cheap, worst case scenario we would lose the house or look into bankruptcy type solutions. Looking back, she should have done that. Probably could have saved the house and avoided dragging me quite so far down with her and potentially condemning our family to poverty for generations.



She struggled with the guilt and the crushingly low self worth, understandably, but I tried to be there for her. I reasoned that it wasn't all her fault. We had started that gambling journey together, and she had continued as a means of escape. I had been escaping too, to work, or phases of time waster games in the evenings and weekends, or even at work. What damage have I done to the business? Perhaps more than her gambling? I thought I could try and share the burden, the responsibility. She said she did the gambling because she wanted to win big and be the great hero, like, ""surprise, look what I did!"" I get it, but oh my god. I tried to be there for her, but we did still fall out. Sometimes I could just get up in the morning and I was in the dog house, which means, her grumpy and giving me silent treatment. When I'd eventually cave and ask what I had done, she'd say I was being off with her, but I literally hadn't seen her that day. Did I say good morning wrong? Was it earlier, did I say good night wrong? I'd ask this sometimes in frustration and she would twist it and say I had been this way for days.

I'm not perfect, I do get low, especially now, but sometimes I'd be tearing my hair out trying to work out what I have done wrong. Why the egg shells? So sometimes I would avoid her, escape into timewaster games, read a book, whatever. I was certainly depressed. I have suffered depression most my life, these days without medication. I don't have any friends or family as I don't keep in touch (I find it stressful) and they give up. With her I learned to let her know if I was low so that she knows me being introvert is not her its me and I'd make extra effort to let her know what I was thinking, but usually it was just a mess of obsessive hopelessness thoughts and memories that seems counter productive to share. When I have shared she is sometimes part of the thoughts, often really, as the obsessive thoughts span decades. A cycle I am constantly working to break. But she would take this as an attack, not necessarily using it against me at the time, but later she would accuse me of silently hating her. This is hurtful in itself as it is using my sharing against me. I was not hating her, I was just processing it all, not just what she has done, but what I have done, or not done, actually mostly how shit I am, what our business competitors have done, how rude our customers are, how the whole world seems to be against us blah blah blah self pity, pull yourself together. Easier said than done.

After strops, she would sometimes apologise days later saying it was pmt, or she was low. But I swear sometimes it was like 2weeks either side of her period I was the enemy. I was brought up never to mention pmt, but she brought it up so I thought, well, maybe that's actually it all these years?? The real problem is, when she gets this way, she is the opposite of low self esteem. Good for her feeling up, but she is so sure of herself, so sure that I am a bastard, she starts throwing all sorts at me from nowhere like I don't appreciate her or what she does around the house or for the kids. When she starts feeling sorry for herself and taking it out on me I get really wound up. I have spent years trying to help her feel better about herself. She does do more internal chores around the house and the kids than me, but not all and certainly not unappreciated. I would make a conscious effort to let it be known how awesome she was, and I can actually be a bit hard on the kids (we have 2 now) as they can sound a bit spoilt at times and take her for granted, so I try to get them to do more and respect how much their mummy does for them, they're only young though so nothing drastic, but it just really infuriates me when she basically throws everything I've done back at me as if it never happened and I am in fact the opposite, or that the things I have done, are in fact abusive.

Then I get resentful. How dare she be this way when I have stood by her, and for us, after what she has put me through and we are still going through. She expects me to forget. How can I forget when we are still 100k in debt!!?? I resent being treated like this, even when I am to blame, like, heaven forbid, I am actually grumpy one morning and fail to hide it well enough. Damn, can't I have some slack. Have I not earned a bit of slack given the country mile of slack and understanding I have given? To explain my anger I explain the source of my resentment, this is where I remind her of all the shit she has put me through and the damage she has done to this family. I believe forgiveness takes time, and although many hurts have been healing, when she suddenly sees herself as all perfect and me the bad guy, I feel like the only way of snapping her out of it is in my incredulity. She says things like, oh will you never get over that. It takes a while to get over a 75k debt... We ended up needing more loans due to the money she had taken out of the business cash flow. Then she does it again, we had already lost our house. I worked myself to the bone to sell it. Her too, it was part of my rescue plan, and we turned our £70k deposit into £200k. We had to move to rented, and move the business. A huge undertaking on top of completely redecorating the house inside and out. But we did it. Lost all our staff, but did it. I wanted to invest a portion in bitcoin now that we finally had some money. We still had a lot of debt, but most of it now on very low interest, lower than inflation so not worth paying off.



We got carried away with bitcoin. Invested 100K, was only supposed to be 20k. The plan was to hold it for 5 years then take profit, but it started exploding immediately which caused us to get carried away buying instead of selling. Stupid, but it didn't change the plan. It just meant we were more leveraged than we wanted to be. We just needed to play it safe, push the business, and we could still afford to lose it all if the worst happened. Just don't do anything stupid. We had a great year in the business. Made 70k, but I saw no money. It's expensive here she tells me. The move was expensive. The move was a hell of a lot of hard work on my part, but not expensive. She's done it again. 75k gone again.



I blame myself to a large extent because I should never have allowed my finances to be so controlled by anyone else. I just saw us as a unit. She is an extension of me, and I her, so why not. When she turns on me, she treats me like I am some sort of monster, and I struggle to find where it comes from. When I push for answers she says it is not like that at all, I am imagining it, she loves me, she says she's just messed up. I said I would take control of finances after the first time, and have access to her emails etc so this could not happen again. She was fine with this, but I wasn't and so buried my head in the sand. I did have access, but she still controlled it all, paying bills home and business, doing accounts. Part of me was afraid to take control because, especially after the second time, I was having a real identity crisis. I still am to be honest. I don't know who I am. I feel like a complete loser and waste of space. On the other hand I feel like I have been awesome, not perfect, I've been angry, even physical once when I physically threw her out the house when I found she had paid for some online gambling game. She had argued that it was a treat for selling something, and I couldn't believe how cavalier she was about it, but she stuck to her guns. Completely unapologetic or aware of the distress this was causing me and would cause me going forward, or the damage it had done to the years she had been gambling free and the trust between us. The trust and wounds were no where near healed but this just tore them right back open and then some. All because of a £15 scratch card type game. That's not what it was but it was something like that I forget. I lost it and said I want you gone. She spat back with venom like I was a monster and swearing at me calling me all sorts. I've never hit a woman, but I have dreamt of beating her to a pulp after the second 75k. I woke up in shock, I had dreamt of doing this to others, but never a woman, and the one you love! I was horrified at what this might mean. I was in a bad place identity wise. Still am. What if I am a monster? I can't control the finances, that would be financial abuse then I definitely would be an abuser on paper. Even though this is common in couples where one is an addict.

I threw her out, not to the ground or anything as violent as that, but it was still physical. I am in conflict with myself. On one hand I am ashamed, I want to always keep my cool and handle things coolly and certainly without violence to a woman. On the other hand, I honestly feel like she is the abuser. If the roles were reversed, me the woman, her the man, I would have been cheering me on if it were a scene in a film. I let her back in about 10mins later though. So not very well thought out, but I remain conflicted as to whether I was on the right track in a way. I do wish she was gone. I wish she was here and happy most of all, but as she is... I can't get my head around it. So hateful.

Her treating me like an abuser whenever she wanted her pound of flesh gave me a complex, made me question, am I abusive? She has thrown everything I have ever done, to make her feel better about herself, back at me as if that was actually me being abusive.

I was very low this year. We have moved again, still renting, still massively in debt, about 100k. But we somehow managed to keep 2 bitcoin. It was 8, but due to the unexpected leverage she caused, we have had to sell at the worst times to make ends meet. On paper we could be debt free now, I think perhaps this is partly why she is behaving the way she is now. She feels completely absolved, but in my head, we could be millionaires if it weren't for the huge burden of the debts she created over the past 7years. We could still have 8 bitcoin. Perhaps even more. But perhaps none at all because without the events that led up to us having to sell the house, we would probably not have bought any.

We moved about a year ago. We hated where we were. Her Mum lived with us all along and died last year. Last year was hellish, on top of everything else, and we were about to go bankrupt. She praised me for my support during her Mum's illness, now she calls me an abuser. A place came up for rent, an amazing place, in Scotland, where we dreamed of one day living. A dream we had buried because her Mum hated the idea of being remote, something we dreamed of (but now she complains about being remote and blames me for it as if I have forced this on her). With her Mum gone, and this opportunity, we grabbed it. A hellish amount of work to achieve but again we did it. We have been burned out this year. Our business turnover has died. I have fallen into a deep low feeling utterly powerless to fix it and feeling a complete waste of space. Falling back on escaping. Drinking in the evenings, gaming in the day. Not always, I would have phases of productivity, but never seeing things through. New products all but complete. I still took the kids walking up mountains and camping and fishing and panning for gold. But the past few months I have been in a very bad way. Complete escape. Products should have been online months ago. Too late in the year now to expect anything. Feeling hopeless because as soon as I put the designs online they will be copied and so we have a very short space of time to make money and I am just so damn tired. I've pulled us out of this hole before only to be thrown back in deeper.

This low was different to big ones of the past. This one I saw, and I spoke about. She was understanding. I was careful how I worded things. Yes I blame her for our situation, but not entirely, and that was not the entirety of my low. It was everything, always is. It was mostly my own lack of self worth. I'm 40years old, degree in engineering, phd drop out, and a fucking idiot with nothing to show for it and nothing left in the tank to do anything about it.

I changed. I decided my brain is chemically imbalanced. I am not getting joy from things that should bring me joy. So I have been trying to remove stimulants from my daily routines. The main ones, no more vaping, no more drinking, no more gaming. I honestly believe the stimulants have damaged me and only hope I will heal. I have since stopped coffee and tea too. The escaping is the hardest to quit. Even this writing is an escape. I'm not there yet.

Initially I was in a bad way. Mainly from the vaping I think. Really spaced out and vacant. I explained what I was doing to her and why I was so vacant. She was being really egg shelly. Typical timing. I've tried to make similar changes in the past, but it never stuck, but I don't know why my trying would piss her off. This was really bad timing because I was at my turning point, I had to make a change. Now she wants egg shells.



I had been tapering off the vaping for a couple of days, and today was my last puff. We got out of bed, she got up first and had a bath, I got out when I heard her get out the bath. I came downstairs said morning, and she answered with a distressed look ""is everything alright??"" I was a bit taken aback, no idea where this was coming from, I said ""yeah, of course why wouldn't it be?"" She said she feels a bit on edge and I said ""but we've just got up?"" and immediately ""everything's fine, sorry, I've just woken up"". I'm terrified, I've been here all too many times before. I hide in the living room, counting down the hours until we have to go to work. She remains short and stompy. At some point I have my last puff of the vape. Crazy the effect it has on my mentality. My heart was very slow, I felt like I needed to hibernate. Then bam, I'm back. So glad I was getting off this crap. By the time we were at work I was very spaced out. Getting stuff done, but standing around a lot looking lost. We took a break together and I was silent. I knew she'd be obsessing over what I was thinking so I broke the silence with ""will be glad when I'm off this"" nodding at her vape. I didn't mean to knock her for still vaping or anything like that. I was just trying to reassure her that this is all I was going through, as I had already explained. I had already told her this is what I was doing and this was how it was affecting me.

She got up and kinda bitchily said, ""right back to work is it."" We had been sat for about 20 seconds. Normally we could drag a break out for 20 minutes! I was like, ""sure"". But then we were working together and she was slamming things about and I just snapped at her, ""look, I'm sorry, but I'm really struggling with this right now and I can't be doing with your shit"". I know it was harsh, but I was struggling to make sense of anything, I could barely deal with my own shit let alone whatever her problem was and I just had to push through this.

She of course continued to have me well and truly in the dog house, now apparently in the right all along, she felt more confident than ever. I just had to ignore it and push through. She eventually let me have it though a couple of days later after much passive aggressiveness. I think it started with her demanding we talk about what happened in the workshop, and I agreed we needed to talk about it as I had told her what I was going through, I couldn't have been more open about it. I was anxious that she was off and worried she she had the wrong idea of what I was thinking. I made it clear multiple times that I was just coming off the vaping and it was messing me up, I'm just a bit spaced and can't think straight. But now I was concerned as to why she has chosen this time in particular to make things difficult.

I was coming out of a very deep low, making massive changes, and she seems to have taken this as an attack. She belittled my changes saying wow you've quit vaping for 2 days and said ""well I have a few things to say about you"" spat with venom. Here it is, I am the monster again. What the hell have I done now. I don't appreciate her. ""I have been a stain on the sofa this year while she has held our family together and the business, and I don't appreciate any of it. She is ashamed of me, she keeps the kids away from me because she is ashamed for them to see me the way I am""

And the cycle repeats. Incredulity and resentment. I have not been completely useless this year. We have both been wrecks due to the burn out which we have both been vocal about, sharing and supporting each other and reassuring each other that we just need the break.  She is just as guilty as me at escaping, and in all the same ways. She does still do more of the housework and kids meals, washing etc. But this is something I am not allowed to do. I try to do things like cook, clean, and want to do the washing, but she gets very defensive about any of it. It's 'her' kitchen. When I do it she takes it as an attack, as if I am criticising her, saying that when she does it, it's not good enough. We home school our children. I was excited to be the maths and science guy, but I am not allowed to participate, I'm treated like I'm interfering or not welcome. The kids had a present from the Grandpa so I suggested we write a thank you letter together, and she took this as an attack that she is not doing enough writing with them. It doesn't matter how much I explain this is not the case or how many times, this is how it is stored in her memory.

I have always been appreciative, but even my trying to help is taken as the opposite of appreciation and an attack. If I do it without asking it is an attack and an infringement on her. If I ask ""can I help?"" The answer is always no. When I bring it up in conversation, she says she prefers it this way as it makes her feel useful and she likes to make us happy. But then when she is not being friendly and saying she is unappreciated, I say these things like I always offer to help, and her response is that I shouldn't offer I should just do it. But that fails as already pointed out, she take it as an attack.

My response to this was that I no longer wanted her to do anything for me. I thought this might help us heal. Not as a long term solution. It back fired pretty quick. My answer to people who feel unappreciated is just stop doing it then. She won't stop, and I was in no position to tell her to do anything, so I did it for her. A couple of days later I asked her where the new box of bin bags were. I suspected they were in one of the cupboards right next to me. She was on the other side of the house. She came all the way over, bent on hands and knees and got the box out of the cupboard right in front of me. I uncomfortably said, you can just tell me which cupboard. I sounded annoyed. I was annoyed. I've always found this habit of hers annoying, but right now I was also annoyed at myself for asking. I asked without thinking, I should have just bloody looked in every cupboard like I normally would to avoid just this. Normally I wouldn't have been actually annoyed though, I would have been more like ""there's no need to come over, just tell me"" ""oh no it's fine"" blah blah blah. This time I was annoyed so felt I should explain myself.

Since falling out with me this time, she had decided to sleep in the spare room. I was very happy with this, because usually she would give me the silent treatment and I would not want to go to bed so would end up sleeping on the sofa or the spare room myself. Feeling very hard done by, not sleeping in your own bed having done nothing apparently.

She had apologised for the way she had behaved on that day in the workshop and afterwards. Not very convincingly, she had said she just thought I was being off, and she over reacted and didn't mean any of it, or not the way it came out. None of which made a lot of sense, but whatever, at least she's talking. Things had seemed to be getting friendlier up until this ridiculous cupboard incident. I went to explain why I reacted the way I did. Quite nervously I fumbled with ""I think this might be a problem"", trying to make light of it, ""I don't want you to do stuff for me, because you don't appreciate me appreciating you, and now this you aren't getting appreciated at all..."" She just cut me off with ""yeah yeah yeah I get it."", I walked off but I didn't feel she got it, I was trying to turn it friendly but she was very stressed. I went back to try and explain, and this time she said ""yeah ok stop rubbing it in"". Well this triggered my anger. I was not trying to rub anything in I was trying to do the opposite and yet here we are again with my trying to sooth a situation being yet another attack. This then escalated in to her repeating everything she had said before, so definitely was a ""sorry not sorry"". I'm left with thinking she hates me, really dislikes me, to which she still says nonsense.

A week or two later she has flipped back and forth between giving me the cold shoulder and being friendly. She has accused me of completely shutting her out in an abusive way. Me not wanting her to cook for me is abusive. Me doing my own washing is abusive. She now has her own living room, but me hoovering ours is abusive.

She gets the kids to come and get in bed with her in the mornings, and play on their computers in her sitting room. She still feeds them more than me but I manage to get a few meals in here and there. She has monopolised the kids, which I see as not just abusive to me, but them. She is making me out to be a monster, and what will they think in years to come. She is lovely mummy. I am grumpy daddy. We do have a lot of fun me and the kids, but very sporadic. Better lately now that I am no longer hiding.

She flips to sobbing and wanting to know what do do. I have told her that I am worn out by it all. We have been here so many times and I think that she needs to figure out what the problem is, because I am over it. I flip between seeing hope, and seeing none for us. I want to take the kids away and live happily ever after. I want us all to be there, but I am now almost certain there can be no we, with me and her. If there can be, then she needs to prove it. This continues for weeks, eventually I suggest she speak to a counselor or something. This is where it gets really maddening.



She goes on gamcare, chats with a councillor. They tell her she is being abused and that I sound like a bully. She throws this at me as an attack and says yes I am a bully, and always have been. ""always"". The cycle repeats. I'm shocked. I've seen a couple of counsellors in my time and none have immediately pressed the red button on your relationship with your family. Actually the opposite. I told her this saying I find it highly suspect. She says that's me ""gaslighting"".

This hostility continued, and then she was sobbing again about a week later, saying it wasn't a councillor it was just a chat room, and actually they are all a bit self congratulating in there. I suggested she speak to an actual councillor. I meant NHS, but she went and found one online. I was a bit suspect but she said they have qualifications and have to be registered etc, so ok, I felt hopeful. She is taking steps, we both seemed more positive. She has a 45min call with the counsellor, we cuddle before her call, I just tell her to just talk, just let it out. I take the kids out for a couple of hours. When I get back I ask if she wants to talk about it. She is cold and says confidently, mmm, no, not yet. And that's the end of that. Whatever bridge we were building now seems like it may have been a figment of my imagination.

I ask a bit later, did she give you any advice or anything, she tells me she has another call booked and has some exercise sheets to go through. She says it will help gather her thoughts.

Today she randomly said she was going out for some air. This is very strange, not something she has ever done. But whatever. After an hour it was getting dark and sleeting, wind picking up and forecast 90miles an hour. The kids are worried, where is mummy. The lad goes out looking for her in the garden. I get worried thinking she might have topped herself so I start looking. We have a lot of outbuildings we work from so I went round them all. The lad comes along just as I am finishing, I don't know what to tell him. I go and look at her computer to see if there is any kind of clue and there it is.

The counsellor has told her she sounds like shes in a seriously abusive relationship. My partner is now looking at traintickets 600miles south to her aunt. I'm now thinking has she run off? I look at her history and I see she has spoken to her aunt, I pull it up, it's email, I feel uncomfortable but here I am. Just skimmed it but looks like her aunty is sold, telling her to call, and can do secret message to get her to call or something as if I stop her from making calls?? I don't even have a mobile phone, she has 2 of them!!

So she had gone out to make a call. I tried to call her on the other mobile, engaged. Text her to say we were worried. Had a look at the message thread with this counsellor and it's just unbelievable. She has lost contact with her cousins and blames me for it. She says it's because I used to get drunk and loud when they came over. We all did! it was a new years piss up!! One year I bought her a karoke set for xmas. We were all loud. They just stopped coming. Personally I thought it was because of the mum living with us. She was very rude to them. But I was always telling her to call them or write to them, she just said no, if that's the way they want it, so be it. But now that's all me?? I have no friends or family either, do I blame her?? Maybe I should. She at least still has her dad.

When we met, we were singing along to something and I joked that she was using too much vibrato. The joke was, I sounded like a smart ass prick. She didn't find it funny, and it has come up years later and I have had to explain myself that I was just messing about. But now, she has told the counsellor that she used to do a lot of singing and now doesn't sing anymore because I have belittled her. It was a stupid joke 20 years ago!!! She makes it sound like I have ruined her singing career?? She sings to our daughter every other night!? (We take it in turns taking them to bed)

We were panning in a stream a few months back. She fell over. Actually what happened was, I thought she was falling so sort of moved to grab her, but then stopped because she just sat on the bank so I thought oh, she was just sitting down. So I looked away as if nothing had happened. Then she said, well aren't you going to help me? I was like what, and then it dawned on me, oh, she had fallen and was now sitting not so comfortably so I immediately helped her up and laughed apologetically saying sorry I thought your were just sitting down. She has told the counsellor that I watched her fall over in a river and then looked at her in disgust and then looked around in case anyone saw!

Stories like this go on, how I am ashamed to be seen out with her. We go out together all the time. We go everywhere together! I took her out for a meal on her birthday, and another time recently just for the hell of it. Not as often as I'd like but we are almost bankrupt ffs!!! Apparently I hate it when she cries in public because I worry what people will think of me. Well yeah, that's true. I'm not sure it has ever happened, but yeah, if she were randomly to start crying in public, I would feel uncomfortable. Does that make me a monster? I would want to comfort her, and yeah would probably feel a bit self conscious.

These are the things she has said to the counsellor. In 45 minutes she has come back a serious abuse victim. What does this mean???? Am I going to lose my kids? Am I going to be labelled a domestic abuser!!? What can I do. Everything I have done is being twisted against as me being abusive. Seriously head fucked now.

I assumed she would take the kids, I don't think she would leave any other way and I have sort of come to terms with that. I would have them in a heart beat. I think if I tried to keep custody she might kill herself, while if she took them I will have more time to earn money to support them and still be there for them, and they will still have a loving mother. But now she is making me out to be a monster. Is it true?? Am I this bully?? The past few years, the more she played victim, the more I have started to wonder if I am actually a victim. I have felt like a victim, but shrugged it off as self pity. I have felt like I was just staying for the kids, fake it to make it. Actually I have been flogging a dead horse trying to keep this relationship alive. I have fallen many times in the process. I'm spent, and I've decided the kids would be better off growing up not experiencing our loveless relationship and me in this emotionally numb and spent state. If we have to go our separate ways, so be it. But why like this? I've asked her why is she doing this? Her answer is, you wanted me to go to a counsellor, now that's not good enough, I'm just doing this for me, almost smarmily, while I am in bits asking her why. Why is this happening. I'm not a big crier, I'm a fairly big guy, and macho enough to feel completely pathetic now.

This is the group I attempted to buy from.

[Neatly Used Coffee Espresso Machine | Groups | Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/540012408310498) [https://www.facebook.com/groups/540012408310498](https://www.facebook.com/groups/540012408310498)

It is a public group with 1.8k members claiming to sell mostly used La Marzocco espresso machines and Niche Zero grinders. 99% of the time the admin is the seller. Most of her posts start off like this: ""Available! Available! Available!@ affordable price. Comes with complete accessories.!"" There are a couple of genuine-LOOKING posts about machines bought off this site so I paid for a used NZ grinder on Nov 24 (Sunday) based on firm assurance from admin/seller that it would be shipped the following Tuesday, Nov 26. I paid $330 + half of the shipping cost, being $45 = $375 in total.

It is now Dec 6 (Friday) and after two full working weeks, the grinder has NOT EVEN BEEN SHIPPED. NO EXPLANATION WHATSOEVER has been given to me about this failure despite MULTIPLE ENQUIRIES on my part.

After MANY attempts at trying to get an update about what is going on, it turns out the admin is NOT even the seller. She is just a middle party with NO CONTROL over the actual shipping of the product I have paid for. This was not indicated in any way in any of her posts.

The admin also assured me on multiple occasions that I will receive a refund if nothing ever gets sent out. She has FAILED to provide a refund and is now UNRESPONSIVE. I am now out of pocket by $375 and no grinder in sight.

I have reported this group and the admin to Facebook and to the Internet Crime Complaint Center. The admin has also very conveniently blocked me from this group - in fact, she did this very early on, when the grinder didn't get shipped on Nov 26. No doubt she knew from the beginning that I would receive nothing for my money.

I would warn anyone not to be as stupid as I have been in buying something they haven't seen from Facebook. I am so upset since NZ is expensive and I just wanted to get a reasonably priced used product. I ended up wasting money and will not be able to get a new grinder for a very long time now.

This is what the group looks like now. I am aware that the admin has changed the name of the group a couple of times, but usually the words ""used coffee/espresso machine"" are part of the group name, so watch out for name changes too.",1,1733539631.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

I am in the US. Only machine I’ve owned in the past is a Keurig k-pod system several years ago. It somehow got infested with ants and I’ve been traumatized of machines ever since, but I don’t think that will be a problem with these machines (or at least I hope!!)

Some requirements: 

•Fully automatic with milk frother 

•$750 MAX - ideally in the $400-700 range!

•Compact size due to limited kitchen space 

•Easy to use for a newbie like me

•Some kind of setting for cold/iced coffee would be ideal, but not necessary 

•Brand with good warranty and customer service so I’m not screwed over if it breaks quickly 

I’m probably the only person in my household who will use it, so I’m looking for one that can just get my daily cup with no hassle or heavy maintenance. Any recommendations or advice for purchasing would be super helpful :) Thanks! ",2,1733539425.0,superautomatic,1,1.0,False

Well anyways as the days go on I started feeling nauseous out of nowhere and that feeling has not left my body at all. I threw up 3 times the other day after drinking coffee which is weird because I've been a coffee drinker my whole life. That was two days ago I threw up and since then I've been having THE WORST stomach pain ever and diarrhea. So now I'm dealing with congestion, throwing up, fatigue, stomach pain/diarrhea and headaches. I've also been having low grade fevers that have been 99.7-99.9 but then they go down. I just feel weird. I know I don't have a cold or the flu because I've had those a lot in my life and this feels nothing like that. I just lost my medicade so I'm debating on if I should wait to see my Dr next month for our appointment or just go to the ER. Money is tight but I feel worse every day.

 These feelings come in waves, one hour I'm fine and the next I feel like I'm hit by a train. I even took a pregnancy test but it said I was negative.",2,1733538751.0,Advice,1,0.75,False

So help me. 

1. I don’t want to move baby back to crib because I’m worried now about him being sick again and choking. 

2. Is he going to be ok sleeping next to me? I’ve removed the duvet and pillows. Issue is he is a front sleeper and it’s a softer mattress.

1h8ihg9,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationshipadvice/comments/1h8ihg9/how_can_i_better_support_my_partner_without/,How can I better support my partner without hurting their feelings?,"Hi, please don't mind the grammatical errors im venting a bit 

I (23 F) have been dating my partner (21) for about year or so and our relationship has been going pretty well so far with just a few bumps along the way. They're a great partner, very caring, giving, attentive, and overall loving person. My only issue is that im having a hard time comforting them in a positive and honest way and giving constructive advice without coming across as a total bitch to them. The main issue is as of the last 3-4 months my partner has been going through some emotional difficulties with their job and has been venting to me about it a lot, especially as of late. to give some background, I understand that working full time can be difficult and draining and they're on their feet all day and get very tired, however, it gets to a point where its no longer venting struggles but constantly whining about every aspect of this job. They work in fast food and on a daily basis when we speak its complaining about how their co worker is always talking, and how the co worker is weird, and how their schedule is getting switched around, and how the dishes from the previous shift never get done, and how they're the only one carrying their weight around there, and that they don't get paid enough for what they do and its these same things day in and day out without a miss. And this is a job they've quit twice and went back to for no reason aside from not liking the other jobs that they got (which had better pay) before going back because they knew the company would take them back. this particular instance, my partner was being very short and clipped and not engaging in conversation and I had asked them what was wrong. They started spiraling and said that they're at a dead end job and have been searching for a new one for weeks and that they're lonely and sad and hate their life and hate being bossed around and tired of other not doing what their asked, and no one cares about them, that they're broke and stressed about money, and no one will help them and that they have to fix everything themselves and just a bunch of other things. I told them that I understand they're upset and and are trying to find a way out of it and try to be comforting and give words of encouragement like they will find something and things are going to be ok and validate their emotions, but what I truly wanted to say was 

\-you are not legally required to slave away there. You can get up and leave and they’d hire someone else. It is not that serious. Youre a grown adult. A privileged grown adult. And you’ve refused help at every chance you’ve received so what is the problem. Truly? like honestly get a fucking grip. Youre not gonna go starving or homeless if you left today. Youre not going to go into mountains of debt. Youre not going to loose all of your belonging. So really tell me what is the problem. Because it all just sound like youre whining about having to wash dishes with an annoying old guy you don’t like and that is gonna be the end of the world for you? i love you  but you need to wake up and smell the fucking coffee because what is so hard about your life with a roof over your head and a bed to sleep in that is making you feel like the entire world and then some is against you.- 

granted I only typed that out out of a just being fed up, **I did not say this to them** and im really trying to find a different way to constructively give them advice and be supportive but they don't pay any bills aside from their car payment and that's literally it. they have no financial obligation, they're not in school, they have a social life, and a partner, and still live with their parents who pay for everything aside from the car payment and their parents are extremely well off and I honestly have little sympathy for them in this situation and this is like the third time they've spiraled out and im unsure of how to handle this again. I don't want to feel resentment for them or invalidate their mental struggles with this but like what do I do. So please let me know if im just an awful partner for thinking this way and if there are things I can do to mediate this feeling. I just feel like a bad partner for not being able to help them feel batter but also I don't want to be dishonest about things like this. sorry this was so long but thank you for reading and any advice is welcome.",1,1733538642.0,relationshipadvice,1,1.0,False

Anyway, I have a general question about my grinder I purchased - the Normcore v2 38mm ran me just shy of $100CAD on the Black Friday sales. Seems high quality and fairly consistent, but as someone who has never really played with coarser grind settings, and my espresso grinder really being dialled in for my espressos, I have nothing to compare it to.

People seem to like it, with not much negative points, other than consistency suffers a slight bit in the extremely coarse settings.

I have some nice coffee that I think would go well with pourover (El Paraiso Lychee Castillo), but am wondering if the grinder would be an issue.

I like a sweeter cup, and the grinder would only be used for v60. I have different filter papers, a Hario switch, and plenty of toys to experiment with, but unfortunately my counter space would not support another bigger grinder, as such I’m stuck with a handheld grinder.

So basically - would stepping up to a higher end grinder (I’d say my budget would be around the $250 mark CAD tops) yield significant and noticeable improvements, or is it significantly diminished returns for me?

### Background
Hello again, Runnit.

When last I left you, I had just set a five-minute PR in the [2022 Seattle Half Marathon](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/z5mu1v/seattle_half_marathon_race_report/). I was riding high, thinking I'd had a massive breakthrough, and daydreaming of maybe, with a couple of years of hard work, BQing in 2025ish.

Let's just say I was, in hindsight, pretty ambitious.

Things got off to a good start in 2023, with a PR in the Cherry Blossom Half that March. It was only six seconds, but on a much tougher course. With that in the bank, I set my next goal: Redeeming myself for the hobbly finish to the 2021 Seattle Marathon. I knew that, if my knees just held together, I could sub-4:00 it for sure.

Nervous about my knees, I spent summer 2023 doing a practice training block for the marathon, and everything went well. I picked up speed on my shorter runs, held together on my long runs (peaking at 22 miles), and my VO2 max topped 53. When September rolled around and it was time to start the real training block, I was as confident as ever.

Did Icarus say the same thing?

The real training block is where things fell apart, with my left IT band developing issues around peak mileage. I tried a compression sleeve and KT tape, but by race day, I knew I was cooked. I showed up for the race anyway, and gave myself permission to quit whenever the pain got too bad. It was a tale of four quarters: The first quarter of the race, I felt okay. The second, I started feeling it. The third, I noticeably slowed. And the fourth, well, never happened. I walked off the course at mile 20.6, when I couldn't keep up with the 4:10 pacers and thought to myself, ""I know what hobbling to the finish of a race feels like, and don't need to do it again.""

The fun thing was, I quit on the inner loop of Green Lake, meaning I had to walk across the outer loop to call an Uber. Let me tell you: If you've never walked through a pack of runners five miles behind you to DNF a race, it's an experience. Still, I considered getting over my stubbornness a moment of personal growth. When I got home, I took off my race bib, stuck it to my fridge—as opposed to the closet shoebox where all my other bibs and medals live—and vowed vengeance in 2024.

### Training
My first run back after last year's DNF was a coffee run at Fleet Feet in Ballard two weeks after the race, and I was reminded how much fun it could be to run with friends instead of being on my own little island. So I started to re-engage with the local community after a couple of years away, and got sucked into things. I ran the St. Patricks Day Dash 5k, PRing by 90 seconds in the process, and then the Cherry Blossom Half (1:37:29, missed my PR by 11 seconds) and celebrated the return of the Top Pot Doughnut Dash 5k (which was the first 5k I ever ran, back in 2011). Then, it was time to get to work.

This summer was all about bulk. I started showing up for more group runs than ever, including quite a few no-drop WWTBC runs that made me slow way down from my usual pace. Some friends and I even got in the habit of running to those runs—there's nothing like running five miles each way to an easy three-mile run to develop a reputation. In mid-July, I even set a weekly mileage PR, at 51.42, though Strava said my Relative Effort was only 60% of when I'd done 50.9 in a week a year earlier.

And yet, my knee. Those two weeks off post-DNF had gotten it back to 95%, but by the summer, it still wasn't any better, and I was once again worried about whether it would hold up. So I took the last week of August off from running, a little reset before Fleet Feet training started. The rest didn't help, which made me wonder if part of the problem was how I sit at my desk, so I made a doctor's appointment and kept moving forward.

Fleet Feet training started August 31st, my first time in the program since early 2022, and I resolved to stick with the plan. That lasted only a few days, before I wound up with a scheduling conflict for half the Wednesday workouts, and I quickly moved back to half-improvising. Meanwhile, my doctor gave me a referral to PT, which started in mid-September.

But first, the Orca Half! A race days before my birthday, where I can see my apartment from the finish line. I roped a group of friends into running it as well—I called us 🐳 Team Six—and as race day approached, I had no real game plan. Push for a PR on a fairly generous course? Take it easy and not aggravate my knee? I still hadn't decided when I arrived at the start line on race day, so I figured I'd run the first chunk of the race (including the one hill) by feel, decide around mile four instead. When decision time came, I was at 7:37/mile, and while I thought I might be able to push and get to a PR, I felt it wasn't worth it. In the end, I finished at 1:39:05—almost two minutes shy of a PR, but good enough for third in my age group, my first ever award.

From then, it was time to lock in. Do my PT three times a week, make as many workouts as possible, hit the hard runs hard and take the easy runs easy, at least by my standards. ""Race pace"" workouts created cognitive dissonance in my brain, the gap between my half-marathon pace (7:30ish/mile) and my marathon goal (9:00/mile) confusing me. Every time, I erred on the hard side.

Still, I had a lot of worries. The longest run of the training program was only 18 miles, and given both of my previous marathons were sunk past that point, doubts reigned. I felt under-trained relative to past races, but considering the overtraining injuries both times, maybe that was a good thing? Or was it? My left knee felt better from all the PT, but my hip and hamstring were barking now, too.

The two weeks before the race, my friends all kept assuring me I had it in the bag, but the more they said that, the less confident I felt. My girlfriend and I had a long conversation one night about all of my doubts, and I told her that I was worried I'd seriously injure myself on this one. She reminded me that I didn't have to run this race, but I felt like after over a year focused on this, I was pot-committed. Either I'd take this race down, or it would take me down.

### Pre-Race
It's a mile walk from my apartment to the start line, so I woke up at 5am, downed a protein bar and a glass of water, and put on all the gear I'd laid out the night before. As I was getting ready to leave the apartment at 6am, I felt zipper on my shorts' cell phone pocket start to break, so I quickly changed into a fresh pair. Was this the one thing that would go wrong today, or an omen?

At Seattle Center, I met up with my girlfriend and our friends from the training program, where I once again assert that this is a horrible idea on my part and I'm probably doomed. I hand my girlfriend a bottle of Gatorlyte and a protein bar for post-race, then dashed to the bathroom while our friends went on a warmup jog. On the walk back, I downed half a 5-Hour Energy and a GU Stroopwafel, and the girlfriend walked with me to near the finish line as I shook with anxiety. I passed her my jacket, kissed her goodbye, queued up [my race playlist](https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/seattle-marathon-2024/pl.u-JP6KJIKGmeP), and got in the corral.

Just not far enough in.

### Race
***Miles 1-4***

When the race begins, I'm stuck way back in the corral, somewhere between the 5:30 and 6:00 pacers, well behind the 3:50 crew I planned on running with. Part of me wants to take my time catching up with them, but I know I won't feel settled until I find them, so I decide to push it.

As I cross the start line, I tap my right headphone, and The Killers' ""[Somebody Told Me](https://youtu.be/Y5fBdpreJiU?si=_RRaaRZ-KUAcDIdN)"" kicks in. This playlist is a work of goddamn art, a conceptual piece that struck me like lightning when I was working on my Orca Half playlist months ago. You see, half marathons are easy for me at this point, but marathons feel impossible. So, I decided to not make a marathon playlist, but rather, two half-marathon playlists: Scrapping my rule of ""no repeating artists within a list"", I made sure every artist repeated, in sequence, with no two tracks from the same album. Side A, Side B.

It sounds easy, but I quickly realized that every time I moved one song, I'd have to move its mirror as well. Things quickly got so complicated that I made a [spreadsheet](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/70cc1qsyqh0aejsl7eeh5/Race-Playlist-Spreadsheet.png?rlkey=430v4xpigfm4zvgvk1utcoje5&st=74pzdt0p&dl=0).

So, anyway, Brandon Flowers requests that I ""pace yourself for me"" as I blow up my race strategy right from the start, and weave my way through slower runners and monorail pylons on 5th Ave, trying to find the pacers I'm counting on. I spot them about a mile in, but I don't catch up until we're about to turn into the I-5 Express Lanes, roughly 1.5 miles (or three tracks) in. As Frightened Rabbit's Scott Hutchinson begins speculating about what happens when our ""[Heads Roll Off](https://youtu.be/nBcbDS5AGnk?si=aFVssRcgi7OyXgvk)"", I shift gears and coast into the dark.

A mile or so later, we re-emerge from the tunnel into the early moments of daylight. Just ahead of me, the 3:50 pacers. Just behind, the 3:55 ones? I briefly wonder whether my guys were slow or those guys are fast, but conclude it's out of my control. Besides, I have at least a minute banked from booking it to catch up with my pacers, so I'm really running at more like a 3:49. I'm where I need to be, no longer ""[Burning Down the House](https://youtu.be/_3eC35LoF4U?si=8u03ZXjipstFgDz7)"". Like the song currently resonating in my earholes, this is all a ""[Jigsaw Falling Into Place](https://youtu.be/GoLJJRIWCLU?si=no34D_uVgsxK9F8U)""

I hit the second aid station around the 3.5-mile mark, and down my first GU (Roctane Sea Salt Chocolate) a minute or two later. My plan for the race is to hit alternating aid stations, for water or Nuun, with GUs at miles 4, 8, 15, 18, and 22, with a Maurten 100 at mile 12, and a mini Japanese KitKat at the spot where I DNFed last year, as a treat.

This will not last.

***Miles 4-8***

Coming off the Express Lanes a little after mile five, I get a little ahead of my pacers, then spot my first friendly face of the course: My girlfriend's ex-husband, who's working the third aid station. (It's fine, we're cool, stop worrying, I said he's a friendly face.) I skip the station, and he's too busy grabbing cups to see me zoom by. A few minutes later, I see another pack of friendly faces: Some of the gals from the Fleet Feet program, who are, by sheer coincidence, cheering for folks across the street from my freshman year dorm at UW. I wave as I go by, and notice my mouth feels dry. I begin to reassess my hydration strategy in real time.

The course winds through the UW, up and around Drumheller Fountain, as we come down Rainier Vista, I grab both a Nuun and a water from the fourth aid station. I down them both, followed by another GU, and as we go up and over the bridge to the Husky Stadium light rail station, I self-assess.

This was the spot where I felt the first signs of my knee getting worse last year, as though it was nudging me towards the train: ""Hey, body, we could be home in like ten minutes. You know, if you want to.""

Last year, the pain jumped to a 4/10 around here, and only got worse. In this moment, my knee, hip, and hamstring are all feeling like 2s. I question whether they can hold on. The Beths remind me that ""[Future Me Hates Me](https://youtu.be/8ogCRFOUoZM?si=9EJ6Oe8Ivp2SRA-b),"" but maybe, just maybe, my leg can [Three Stooges Syndrome](https://youtu.be/gmBj8r1-fDo?si=uTuqt2eCZRoDvdyj) this race.

***Miles 8-14***

The course continues, across the cut, through the Arboretum, and up into Interlaken. This is where the 3:40 pacers dropped me last year, and this is where the 3:50 pacers get back ahead of me, after I'd (barely) led them the last few miles. As I try not to worry about it, I spot a convenient distraction: A new nemesis.

Just steps of me, I spot a man wearing white arm sleeves and an off-white tank top reading ""Optimistic Runners"" on the back. I am renowned for running in all black, especially so on race day (the only time I run in all-black Goodrs), and my pessimism is legendary.

I do not know this man. I do not wish him ill. But now, only moments after I've become aware of his existence, I do wish to destroy him.

This man does not know I exist, and his ""[Sweetness](https://youtu.be/ROatPGGMvXg?si=O6pmkv0c19VaoJjM)"" will not be concerned with me.

Onward, we all continue. I find a trash can, and empty my trash pocket, realizing a moment too late that I've thrown out the wrapper for the piece of gum I'm still chewing. I spent a good half a mile debating what to do about it, but as LCD Soundsystem's ""[All My Friends](https://youtu.be/aygY5OqMuKE?si=bRyjSjHE7tGHPwo5)"" kicks in—the first track of the usual ""epic midsection"" of races, which bumped slightly ahead in the mix to accommodate this playlist's concept—I realize I need to decide so I can take my Maurten. I throw the gum I'm chewing in a planter as I run past, and hope the cops blocking cross streets won't take this as a provocation.

The University Bridge. The Burke-Gilman. Gasworks. Back onto the Burke. I've gone from planning on hitting alternating aid stations to getting two cups at every single one and still feeling thirsty. My leg keeps getting grumpier, but at an acceptable rate. Then, the playlist flips.

***Miles 14-18***

When I said goodbye to my girlfriend pre-race, she said she'd be waiting for me right outside her office, at mile 14. ""Side B,"" she said, having heard me ramble about the playlist more than anyone else.

""Maybe the tail end of Side A, if all goes right?"" I replied. ""I gave the playlist some slack.""

It was true—the playlist was timed for a sub-3:57:41 finish, and I planned on running with the 3:50 crowd. But I'm not as far ahead as I thought I might be when I spot her through my sweat-smudged Goodrs and give her a wave. I'm seconds into Side B, somehow both ahead and behind.

Karen O insists I'm a ""[Zero](https://youtu.be/pmGNo8RL5kM?si=HV1U9TnmXgsKLBNV)"" as I keep moving, and as the course takes a steep uphill towards and onto Aurora, Shirley Manson encourages me to ""[Push It](https://youtu.be/Pmd3UiNfNkA?si=boogCl3_1xEvyOq8)"".

As we approach 39th and Aurora, I keep an eye out for my friend Gus, who's supposed to be a course marshal at that intersection. A mutual friend has been joking for two weeks now that Gus will tase me when I pass, but I plan on waving to him anyway. Shockingly, when I spot him, I see a man-shaped crumple at his feet, and Gus is on the phone. I wave at Gus, and he yells words of encouragement despite the phone call.

(The next day, at a post-race party, Gus will tell all of us that said crumple was a 23-year-old man running the half marathon who'd had a cardiac arrest. Gus called for help, medics got there quickly, and the man is expected to be fine. Gus is the real hero of this race report.)

At mile 16, as we reach Green Lake, I pocket my gloves. I'm still with the pacers. The Joy Formidable is singing ""[Cradle](https://youtu.be/W66yhfMb4d0?si=4ev6Kaf1gwRd3Fme)"" to me, and ten miles from freedom, all I want to see is the end of this.

***Miles 18-22***

As I mentioned earlier, this playlist was a real struggle to curate, but one thing that helped it come into focus was the realization that a song by my friends' band, the Smokey Brights, ""[Sad Boy Song #39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c51Z8tLpGB0)"", was begging for that numbered slot in the ultimately 58-track playlist. (Not counting the bonus, filler songs that were there to keep me going if I missed my goal.)

On the walk to the race this morning, I realized that, if all went well, this song would be hitting right around a) the moment when I'll have run farther than I did this whole training block, which also happens to be b) the point where I've historically fallen apart. I made a mental note to check in with myself when it came on, and here it is. I'm doing okay, I think?

I'm still double-fisting at each aid station. The pacers pull ahead of me at each one, about ten seconds in front, but then I close the gap, and then rinse and repeat. If I were an optimist, I'd say I can see the ""[Other Side](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3PbFlfurME)"", but, well, we already discussed that like ten miles ago. That guy's still here.

Around mile twenty, one of the four(!) pacers—the two from the first half just kept on going with us, even as their supposed replacements kept over—strikes up a conversation with another runner out of nowhere. I want to scream at them—SOME OF US ARE IN ZONE 4 HERE!—but keep it together. As I pass last years DNF spot, I gulp down the mini KitKat (a suggestion from a friend who said he always likes to have a treat during the home stretch of a race), and get an encouraging text from my girlfriend that I swipe away on my watch. She's trying to be supportive, making sure I know where I'm at. I'm already keenly aware.

And so, we finish the second loop of Green Lake, and swing back onto Aurora. On the uphill, the pacers start to get ahead of me, and I lose sight of my nemesis, too, and I wonder if this hill will be ""[The Only Heartbreaker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmXFF_whkVk)"".

***Miles 22-26.2***

I'm definitely losing steam. My left leg issues are starting to ratchet up, my right knee is feeling funky, my biceps—where my long-sleeved shirt is bunching since I pulled it above my elbows forever ago—are going numb, and my mouth definitely doesn't taste like it's supposed to. But I'm still moving. Less fast than before, but still reasonably fast. And there's time on the clock.

I take my last GU (not counting the spare) just after mile 22, and power forward as best I can. At the Aurora Bridge, I finally give in, and walk for a bit, keeping an eye on my watch and swearing I'll get back into a run once my heart rate drops below 140. It gets there, and then when I reach the next street light—no, the next one; okay, the one after that—I return to a run. When the last aid station comes into view, I slow to a walk again, down two Nuuns and a water, and check my watch. I have half an hour to go two miles. I'm feeling sick, but not *that* sick.

I've got this! *I've got this?!*

""[I Know the End](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJ9-xN6dCW4)"", but I'm ""[Losing My Edge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjDMdSwefk)"", and the kids are coming up from behind. One more brief walk, just for a few seconds, and then back into gear.

Down Aurora. Hang a right. Another, and there's the 26 marker, and ""This is nothing like it was in my room, in my best clothes...""

I start feeling so overwhelmed I worry I'm not going to make it the last 0.2. I remember my mentor the first time I did the Fleet Feet program, who puked twice between mile 13 and the finish line of a half, and missed her goal time by something like five seconds, and wonder what fate awaits me at this last left turn and ""I'm the new blue blood, I'm the great white hope..."" and a gentle curve and a turf field and the announcer saying my name and those clocks say 3:52:XX and ""I won't fuck us over, I'm [Mr. November](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxWQMyoYJBU)"" and I'm across the line, still breathing, still upright.

### Post-race
I tap both earbuds, stopping mid-song and deeply mid-daze. A race medal finds its way in my hands and around my neck, and I stumble through the finisher area—thoroughly inundated with non-participants—in search of a space blanket, two bottles of water, and some snacks. I find the first two, at least. And then, the portapotties. At the start of the race, I was sure I'd have to pee at some point, but once the race began, I felt like any pit stop might make everything lock up, like it did three years ago. I wasn't going to risk it.

When I emerge from the portapotty, I'm swarmed by eight or so friends, all seeking fist-bumps and offering congratulations, and one of whom accuses me of sandbagging expectations the last few weeks. But by the time the bumps are all exchanged, they can tell I'm not right, and ask what I need. I say my girlfriend has my Gatorlyte—except I use her name—and she appears seconds later, and we walk off together to find somewhere I can sit or lie down or whatever. I'm pretty sure this is how about half of those folks learned we're dating.

We find a spot in the first row of Memorial Stadium's bleachers, sit down, and I manage a few sips of Gatorlyte before I bend over and start to break down from some combination of pain and emotion and relief for somewhere between five minutes and the five years that it feels like this race took off my life. Once I've returned to being mildly functional, she tells me I came in at 3:51:07, and we walk—well, she walks and I hobble—off towards the monorail that'll get me within crawling distance of home.

Once I'm back in my apartment, I rip last year's race bib off the fridge in a moment of celebration, and soon after, life slowly returns to my body. The girlfriend makes me cinnamon rolls from scratch, and I thank her profusely for everything, especially the shoes from the future that I ran the race in, which she snagged for me. When I mention I finished the race to the tune of ""Mr. November"", she asks me to play it, since she loves that song, and then I play her the playlist's next and final track: Los Campesinos' ""[Avocado, Baby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-M_m1I1uKU)"", the cacophonous banger I always put at the end of my race playlists, the song that marks my goal time, the song I didn't even make it to today.

The next night, we go to happy hour, then we walk—well, she walks, and I limp—three blocks to the Medal Monday celebration our training group put on. She's wearing her Chicago medal, and I'm wearing my Orca Half and Seattle Marathon ones, and a few more people pick up on the fact that there's something going on here.

At some point in the night, I suggest we make a sacred pledge between us: No marathons in 2025. (In this moment, I forget I've already entered the Chicago lottery.) She's already made such a vow with a close friend, but allows me to join the pact.

I've got a few races on the calendar for next year, but for the first time in five years, I have no real running goals. It's time to have some fun with this whole thing again.

Oh, and get that tattoo I just earned. But that might be a different post, another time.

The last two weeks is when my symptoms started. It started with chronic congestion/headaches and feeling extremely tired all of a sudden. I chalked it up to the season changing because I didn't really feel ""sick"" like I had the cold or flu. I just felt ""off"". Well this continued on and every day I've become more and more tired to the point where I sometimes can't even do anything because I feel so weak and dizzy. This is very unusual for me because I'm usually a very energetic person who's always doing something and I hate feeling tired and I HATE taking naps. 

Well anyways as the days go on I started feeling nauseous out of nowhere and that feeling has not left my body at all. I threw up 3 times the other day after drinking coffee which is weird because I've been a coffee drinker my whole life. That was two days ago I threw up and since then I've been having THE WORST stomach pain ever and diarrhea. So now I'm dealing with congestion, throwing up, fatigue, stomach pain/diarrhea and headaches. I've also been having low grade fevers that have been 99.7-99.9 but then they go down. I just feel weird. I know I don't have a cold or the flu because I've had those a lot in my life and this feels nothing like that. I just lost my medicade so I'm debating on if I should wait to see my Dr next month for our appointment or just go to the ER. Money is tight but I feel worse every day.

 These feelings come in waves, one hour I'm fine and the next I feel like I'm hit by a train. I even took a pregnancy test but it said I was negative.",1,1733538412.0,AskDocs,2,1.0,False

1h8icvm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Athens/comments/1h8icvm/i_asked_chatgpt_to_roast_the_neighborhoods_of/,I asked ChatGPT to roast the neighborhoods of Athens,"Alright, let's dive into the neighborhoods of Athens, GA:

1. **Five Points**: Oh, Five Points. It's like the ""uptown"" of Athens, except it’s got all the charm of a college kid's Instagram feed—nice, but only real for about two weeks out of the year when the fall leaves hit just right. Otherwise, it’s a sea of overpriced homes and trendy coffee shops, where the only thing more pretentious than the barista’s apron is the size of the houses that were built way too close together.

2. **Normaltown**: Welcome to Normaltown, where the streets are as narrow as your chances of finding a parking spot. It's quirky, but in that ""I'm trying too hard to be an old-school neighborhood while still pretending to have progressive ideals"" kind of way. Sure, you can find some good dive bars, but get ready to pay for a $12 cocktail that tastes like a high school chemistry experiment.

3. **Boulevard**: Boulevard's where you go if you want a taste of Athens' more ""real"" side—though it’s more ""real"" in the sense that you might find a good deal on an old house, but it comes with some equally real neighbors who will be happy to remind you of their opinions on the local school system. It’s the neighborhood that can’t decide whether it’s hipster heaven or just a hot mess of aging houses and random roadside attractions.

4. **Pinecrest**: Pinecrest feels like the ""just outside of Athens"" spot where people who don't quite want to live in the city, but still want to say they do, end up. It's like the suburbia of your college town dreams, except it’s missing that nice, shiny charm. It's got that ""my parents bought me my first car, and I’m going to be stuck here for years after graduation"" vibe.

5. **East Athens**: If you're into the thrill of driving through neighborhoods where you’re not sure if you’re in Athens or a post-apocalyptic movie set, East Athens is calling your name. Great potential for a future in real estate speculation, though current listings might make you rethink your decision-making skills. But hey, the rent is cheap, and you might even get a glimpse of the ""real"" Athens experience — if you can find it behind all the unfinished roads and empty lots.

6. **West Athens**: West Athens sounds nice in theory, but unless you're into questionable fast food chains and the type of place where the cars parked on the street give off a ""you better lock your doors"" kind of vibe, you might want to reconsider. It's a place where everyone's just trying to get by, but the fact that you have to cross five traffic lights to get to anything remotely ""cool"" will leave you second-guessing your decision to be an adventurer.

7. **University Heights**: Ah, University Heights—where students go to get their fix of textbook-inspired ""adulting."" The houses look like a 90s sitcom set, and the ""neighborhood pride"" comes in the form of a six-week stretch of manicured lawns before finals hit. It's not quite as picturesque as it thinks it is, but it definitely has the whole “we’re so chill, we’ll party until 2 a.m.” thing down.

8. **Tallassee**: Tallassee feels like the place where people went to hide from the rest of the world, but then realized it’s only five minutes from everything they actually want to do. There’s potential for a cool, secluded vibe if you ignore the strange mix of poorly maintained yards and awkwardly empty properties. If you're into an oddly quiet, almost haunting experience, this is the spot.

So there you have it: Athens’ neighborhoods, where the charm often comes with an asterisk and a ""you probably won't find parking"" disclaimer.",0,1733538219.0,Athens,3,0.31,False

I’m looking to upgrade my grinder and I’ve decided on the DF54. Upon my search I saw MiiCoffee ($229) and Turin ($215) sell it (both on backorder). Is buying from one site over the other better? Does one have better customer service over the other? Any good or bad experiences you have experienced with either site? ",0,1733537184.0,espresso,1,0.5,False

I don't think I can donate expired goods around here. I don't really care about expiration dates myself but I'd like to use it up, and I don't really care for the way it tastes as a drink (it tastes like corn on the cob). 

# Here are the ingredients: SUGAR, DRIED GLUCOSE SYRUP (FROM WHEAT OR CORN), MALTODEXTRIN, NONFAT MILK, MEDIUM CHAIN TRIGLYCERIDES (PALM), INSTANT COFFEE, CONTAINS LESS THAN 2% OF MODIFIED FOOD STARCH, ARTIFICIAL AND NATURAL FLAVOR, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, CORN STARCH, SILICON DIOXIDE, CALCIUM PHOSPHATE, XANTHAN GUM, TRICALCIUM PHOSPHATE, LACTOSE, SALT, ACESULFAME POTASSIUM, ASPARTAME†. <b>†PHENYLKETONURICS: CONTAINS PHENYLALANINE.

Does anyone have any ideas for how to incorporate this into a recipe for cookies, muffins, or some kind of baked goods? It seems like it's mostly just sugar, so I was wondering if I could replace sugar with it in a recipe?

1h8i0ki,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPN_Connect/comments/1h8i0ki/expressvpn_a_leading_vpn_service_for_privacy_and/,ExpressVPN: A Leading VPN Service for Privacy and Security,"In a world where internet privacy and security are more critical than ever, ExpressVPN stands out as one of the most trusted VPN services. Offering high-speed connections, strong encryption, and a strict no-logs policy, ExpressVPN is designed to protect your online activities, keep your data private, and help you access geo-restricted content. Whether you're browsing the web, streaming your favorite shows, or working on public Wi-Fi, ExpressVPN provides the tools you need to stay secure and anonymous. In this post, we’ll explore what ExpressVPN is, its key features, benefits, and how it can improve your online security.

1. What is ExpressVPN?

ExpressVPN is a Virtual Private Network (VPN) service that encrypts your internet connection and routes your traffic through remote servers. This provides a secure, private internet connection by hiding your real IP address and making your data unreadable to anyone trying to intercept it. ExpressVPN is known for its high-speed performance, strong security features, and ease of use. The service operates servers in over 90 countries and supports a wide range of devices, ensuring privacy, security, and unrestricted access to content no matter where you are.

2. Key Features of ExpressVPN

1. Strong Encryption and Security

AES-256 Encryption: ExpressVPN uses AES-256-bit encryption, which is one of the most secure encryption standards available. This ensures that your data is encrypted and protected from hackers, government surveillance, and cybercriminals.

OpenVPN, IKEv2, and Lightway Protocol: ExpressVPN supports several VPN protocols, including OpenVPN, IKEv2/IPSec, and its own Lightway protocol, which is designed to offer high-speed performance with strong security.

Kill Switch: The Network Lock (Kill Switch) feature automatically disconnects your device from the internet if the VPN connection is lost, preventing any exposure of your real IP address.

No Logs Policy: ExpressVPN has a strict no-logs policy, meaning it does not collect or store any information about your online activities. This ensures that your browsing history, metadata, and personal data are never recorded or shared.

2. High-Speed Servers

Over 3,000 Servers in 94 Countries: ExpressVPN has an extensive network of over 3,000 servers in 94 countries, offering users plenty of options for bypassing geo-restrictions and accessing content from different regions.

Fast Speeds for Streaming and Gaming: Known for its impressive speeds, ExpressVPN ensures that you can stream HD or 4K content without buffering and engage in online gaming with minimal lag.

3. Privacy and Anonymity

IP Address Masking: ExpressVPN masks your real IP address and assigns you a new IP from its server network, which helps maintain your anonymity while browsing the web.

Split Tunneling: With split tunneling, you can choose which apps or websites use the VPN and which ones don’t. This can improve connection speeds for activities that don’t require encryption while keeping sensitive activities secure.

TrustedServer Technology: ExpressVPN uses RAM-only servers, which means that no data is ever written to a physical hard drive, further enhancing privacy and security. This also means that servers are wiped clean every time they are rebooted, ensuring that no data can be stored.

4. Easy-to-Use Apps

Cross-Platform Support: ExpressVPN is compatible with a wide range of devices, including Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, Linux, routers, and more. It also supports extensions for browsers like Chrome and Firefox.

User-Friendly Interface: ExpressVPN’s apps are easy to use, even for beginners. With a single click, you can connect to a server, choose a location, and start browsing securely. The app’s intuitive design makes it simple to manage your VPN connection.

5. Streaming and Torrenting

Unblock Geo-Restricted Content: ExpressVPN allows you to bypass geo-restrictions on popular streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, BBC iPlayer, Disney+, and more. Simply connect to a server in a supported country, and access the content available in that region.

P2P Support: ExpressVPN supports P2P file sharing and torrenting on many of its servers, ensuring fast and secure downloads with strong encryption.

3. Benefits of Using ExpressVPN

1. Enhanced Online Privacy

By masking your real IP address and encrypting your internet connection, ExpressVPN ensures that your online activities are private. This is especially important when using public Wi-Fi networks, where hackers can easily intercept unencrypted data.

2. Security on Public Wi-Fi

Public Wi-Fi networks (such as those in coffee shops, airports, or hotels) are often not secure, making them a target for cybercriminals. With ExpressVPN, your internet connection is encrypted, protecting your personal data from hackers and eavesdroppers.

3. Access Geo-Restricted Content

ExpressVPN allows you to access content that is restricted or blocked in your country by changing your virtual location. Whether it's Netflix, Hulu, or other region-locked services, ExpressVPN can help you bypass these restrictions.

4. Avoid Online Tracking

ExpressVPN helps prevent websites from tracking your online behavior and collecting personal data. By hiding your real IP address, you can browse the web anonymously and avoid targeted ads and trackers.

5. Streaming and Gaming Performance

ExpressVPN offers high-speed servers with low latency, which is ideal for streaming HD/4K videos or gaming online. With unlimited bandwidth, you can enjoy content without buffering or connection drops.

4. How to Use ExpressVPN

Using ExpressVPN is simple and quick. Here’s a basic guide:

Sign Up: Visit the ExpressVPN website and choose a subscription plan. You can select from monthly, 6-month, or 12-month plans, with a 30-day money-back guarantee.

Download and Install: After purchasing, download the ExpressVPN app for your device (Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, etc.). The installation process is fast and easy.

Log In: Once the app is installed, log in using your ExpressVPN account credentials.

Connect to a Server: Open the app and select a server location from the map or server list. ExpressVPN will automatically connect you to the best server, or you can manually choose a location based on your needs.

Start Browsing Securely: After the connection is established, your internet traffic is encrypted, and your online activities are protected. You can now browse the web, stream content, or download files securely.

5. Pricing Plans

ExpressVPN offers several subscription options:

1-Month Plan: The monthly plan is flexible, ideal for short-term use but comes at a higher cost per month.

6-Month Plan: The 6-month plan offers a moderate discount compared to the monthly option.

12-Month Plan: The 12-month plan offers the best value, with a significant discount on the monthly cost.

30-Day Money-Back Guarantee: ExpressVPN offers a 30-day money-back guarantee, allowing you to try the service risk-free and get a full refund if you're not satisfied.

","I'll be in Vancouver for a business trip from December 10 to 13 and I'm looking to meet someone for a coffee and maybe cuddles and watch a movie together. I'm a 30-year-old professional 5'11"" with a normal build.

A bit about me: I'm open-minded and respectful. I'm looking for someone with a similar mindset. I am 5’11’’, clean shaven with full hair. I do not have any preference for race, and would love to meet a great woman of any race.I enjoy a good laugh and love to have fun. I'm looking for someone who can make me smile and enjoy a good time. I am also a cuddler. When we meet, we can cuddle and watch a movie together and take it from there. I can meet during the day as well. I am flexible in my schedule.

I can host at my hotel or come to your place, whatever you're comfortable with. To ensure we're both at ease, I'd like to verify by voice and video call first, and maybe meet at a public place beforehand. I very much appreciate discretion. If you're interested, please send me a message telling me a bit about yourself. I am open to swap pictures early to see if we have physical attraction. Would love to build a connection online before we meet in person. It doesn’t matter if you are single, married or in a relationship. I just want us to have a good time. Let's make this business trip a bit more fun!

I'm watching Nancy Grace about the Kobayashi case and they mentioned the possibility of Hannah being involved in this Twin Flames Universe cult and so I just watched a whole video on a YT channel named Coffee and Cults and honestly...it really could be because of the texts she sent 

1. She said she got scammed for her ""funds"" for a person she thought she loved: 
- Twin Flames usually prays upon people who feel lonely (those who recently broke up with their partners or who have felt rejected by someone they love) 
- People who follow this cult are ""assigned"" their ""twin flame"" (like a soul mate by much more intense) by the two leaders of this cult. They are told that they must do ANYTHING to get together with this person... encouraging them to shun their family and friends, move away and leave their jobs (and even some have even stalked their supposed twin flame and have gotten criminally charged because that person might already be married or not interested) 
-This cult basically has pushes people to buy their courses, pay for their seminars and pay for unnecessary services in order for people to gain a better understanding of how to be find and be with this twin flamebod theirs. 
- they pray upon people who are very much into esoteric and new agey practices and I've noticed Hannah seemed to be into the kind of us through her pictures and even the fact that she went to get a palm reading. 

Do you guys think this is a possibility? What if she decided to go meet her twin flame who was in LA or in Mexico?

Its downtown? Cute, but it’s almost like they tried too hard to be quirky with a side of small-town charm. The farmers' market is the highlight of the weekend, where you can pick up your artisanal soap and handwoven basket made from organic materials grown 10 miles away by someone who may or may not have been a philosophy major.

And let’s not forget the university. UC Davis is the pride of the city, where students enthusiastically discuss the implications of climate change while simultaneously buying $8 coffee from a local shop that definitely uses more paper cups than it would like to admit. The town's ideal Saturday: biking to a yoga class, then meeting friends for kombucha and avocado toast before deciding to take the rest of the day to have an “ethereal” conversation about the future of the planet.

Oh, and the heat. Let’s talk about that. The city is boiling in the summer, but don’t worry, everyone just talks about how they “embrace” it.

I recently moved to LA and spent the last few months exploring this incredible city. I thought I'd share my favorite spots and some hidden gems I've discovered along the way.

First off, let me tell you - Los Angeles is HUGE. There's so much more to see than just Hollywood and Beverly Hills. I've found that the best way to really experience LA is to mix tourist spots with local favorites.

The beaches here are amazing. Santa Monica Pier is touristy but totally worth it - the sunset views are unreal. Venice Beach is perfect for people-watching and checking out the street performers. If you want something more chill, head to Manhattan Beach or Malibu.

Downtown LA has really transformed recently. The Arts District is super cool with awesome murals and hip coffee shops. Grand Central Market is food heaven - try the eggs at Eggslut (yes, that's really its name!). The Broad museum is free but book ahead online.

Griffith Observatory is a must-visit. The views of the city are insane, especially at sunset. Plus, you can see the Hollywood Sign from here. Speaking of which, avoid those sketchy Hollywood Boulevard tours - I found this awesome service that offers legit guided tours: https://athometouch.com/losangeles

For nature lovers, Runyon Canyon has great hiking trails. If you're feeling adventurous, try Topanga State Park. The views are worth the climb!

Little Tokyo and Koreatown are food paradises. Get ramen at Daikokuya (prepare to wait in line) or Korean BBQ at Parks BBQ. The Grove is perfect for shopping and celebrity spotting.

Universal Studios is obviously popular, but if you're into theme parks, don't skip it. Get the express pass if you can - totally worth avoiding those long lines.

Pro tip: Many of these places offer guided tours with insider access. I've used https://athometouch.com/losangeles several times and they really know their stuff. You get way more out of the experience with a knowledgeable guide.

Traffic here is no joke, so plan your day around it. Try to hit spots in the same area together. Don't try to do Hollywood and Santa Monica on the same day unless you enjoy sitting in traffic for hours.

Remember to bring sunscreen and water - the LA sun is intense year-round. Also, always check parking situations beforehand. Some spots can be tricky.

Happy exploring, folks! Feel free to ask any questions in the comments. I'm still discovering new places myself and love hearing local recommendations!

For now, I’m responsible for the groceries while my dad pays the rent & utility bills.

I get to hang out with my friends on weekends. Inuman, iced coffee everyday, overnight stays, and so on. Last inuman, sa aming lima na nakinabang, only 2 of us in the group paid for the 2-night hotel stay, drinks, and food. The other three had excuses para sagutin muna raw namin sila.

Now, the two of us are struggling. Hindi sila masingil kasi wala na raw. I get it. One of us has a kid, and she had to bring him to his pedia for a check-up. The other two (B & G) paid some debts. Pero napabayaan ko yung personal expenses ko, which is my fault cause my math was not mathing. 😭

Because of that, I didn’t get to pay my GLoan & it doubled the amount. I never used GLoan btw, but my friend “G” persuaded me, promising na he’ll pay it. He paid on time for the first month naman. I just didn’t expect na yug 6k na loan, magiging 8k because of the interest, payable for 9 months. So yeah, now everyday, the penalty adds up.

The mom friend also borrowed to me 2 weeks ago— 3k muna. She said she’ll just add 500Php within the week. But she ended up asking for another 2k, 2 days after. Until now, wala pa rin akong nakukuha.

Buti na lang nakapagbayad na ako sa review center right before that night we stayed at the hotel. 

Anyway, now, for two nights, I haven’t been eating midnight lunch sa office. Ayoko manumbat or something, pero buti pa sila nakakakain pa rin during breaks. I also skipepd buying iced coffee last night— it broke my heart a little kasi it’s the first time. Literal na 148Php na lang natira sakin. Pamasahe na lang for the week til our next payday. 

I couldn’t even buy my meds for my anti-anxiety for over a week now, so I’m having my headache for the 5th day already.

I realized na after ko ma-collect lahat ng debts— totalling to around 8k lang naman, hindi na ako magpapahiram kahit sa friends talaga. I hate getting financial problems, ayoko sumama loob sa friends ko. 

Naiintindihan ko naman na may pangangailangan din sila, and I do want to help as much as I can. But it sucks that some can’t pay on time as they have promised.",6,1733536194.0,OffMyChestPH,3,1.0,False
1h8hpkj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fibroids/comments/1h8hpkj/my_story_12_days_post_surgery/,My Story - 12 Days Post Surgery,"Hi everyone,

Firstly, a huge thanks to all the women on this page. I still to this day haven’t met anyone else that has had fibroids and it has been so challenging navigating this feeling so isolated. You all provided me with so much comfort! You helped me make sure I was making the right decision for me, my body, and my fertility journey. Without you I would have gone down a depressive spiral not knowing what to expect with my own myomectomy. I'm so grateful to have read all your stories and advice. Thank you! 

*This is my story…* 

I'm 36 and based in Australia. I found out I had a fibroid(s) while I was pregnant earlier this year at my 7 week scan (February). Everything was fine until I miscarried at 12 weeks (April). All the doctors in hospital told me I should just start trying again when I was ready and that nothing was abnormal after I had my D&C. 

This advice didn’t sit well with me because of my age and the grief of loosing a baby and never wanting to go through that again. I have a fabulous GP and she referred me to a fertility specialist. He gave me and my husband a ton of tests to pinpoint exactly what might have gone wrong with the pregnancy and where we needed to go from there (June). 

Hubby totally fine (of course!) but he confirmed I had 2 fibroids: one 8cm subsersoal and one tiny pedunculated submocosal as well as a quite low egg count. The plan was to get these bad boys out of me but the wait was long and surgery was scheduled for 25th of November. In the meantime, we did a round of IVF (worst pain of my life after that egg retrieval!) and managed to get 2 embryos. 

The day before I had to be on a liquid diet and take prep to clear my bowels the night before. That day I had: black coffee, Gatorade, beef broth, strained chicken noodle soup and jello. Took the first sachet of prep at 3pm and didn’t have a BM until nearly 6pm. Then the second sachet at 9pm. I nearly shat myself that night in bed! What a joy. But it wasn’t as awful as I had imagined. 

Day of my operation - I couldn’t have anything to eat or drink from 7:30am so got up early to have a black coffee and some Gatorade. I did my last Pilates workout at home, stretched my body for nearly an hour and lifted some weights to feel strong one last time. I had a super long shower and shaved my legs. No scented shampoos/body wash or any lotions allowed on my body. 

My husband and mother drove me to the hospital for check-in at 11:30am. I was wicked away almost immediately so good-byes were very brief. I wish I had know I couldn’t bring someone through with me. I brought a book which was helpful to keep my mind off it all and prevent me from doom scrolling. 

I checked in with a nurse and she weighed me, checked blood pressure, and confirmed one last pregnancy test. (Hard to pee after not drinking much) I got changed into the hospital clothes and compression socks.  I then waited in a comfy recliner where the pharmacist and anaesthetist came to chat with me. Then I was taken to my comfy rolly bed where they got the IV needle in my arm and whisked me off to the operating theatre. Surgery was scheduled for 1:30pm. I met with my surgeon who confirmed what we were doing and I was out like a light. 

Surgery lasted just under 3 hours. They performed a laparoscopic myomectomy with a bikini cut and a dye study. While they were in there he also found I had endometriosis and a lot of scar tissue from having appendicitis! Got rid of all of that as well. Dye study was to check my fallopian tubes and they’re all clear. 

I woke up in the large waiting area super groggy and my entire body shaking. They were able to give me something right away to get that to stop and ease the pain as it was quite bad! I opted for a private room (so so thankful for this) and they whisked me there once I was ready (my husband said that was nearly 2 hours after the surgery was over) where I got to see my husband and mom which was so comforting. They placed a catheter in me during surgery so I didn’t need to worry about getting up to pee until the next morning. Husband and mom fed me a bit of soup and a bread roll with butter as I was pretty hungry. Throat was sore from being intubated and difficult to speak for the first night. I was hooked up to the pain meds and basically was just knocked out in a nice blissful state that whole evening and slept through the night aside from nurses coming to check on my vitals every couple hours. I did experience some gas pain in my shoulders like I had read in other women’s accounts. This was alleviated with hot packs. 

The next morning in hospital my surgeon checked in on me bright and early. He checked my pain levels, incision sights and confined we could take out the catheter later that morning. So that was taken out (again worked it up in my head to be way worse than it actually was) it just felt like a slight burning sensation that went away within a few minutes. Then it was time to get up first time lost-surgery. I had a nurse there to help me thankfully as I didn’t think I could do it. She got me standing and doing a few standing marches and then walked to a chair in the room and sat back down while she changed the sheets on my bed. I was super nauseous doing this and they gave me some antinausea medication which kicked in immediately. I didn’t manage to get up for a walk down the hall until much later in the day. I had to keep trying to urinate which was so hard! My poor bladder was really struggling and was holding on to a lot of urine. They measured the amount I was passing every time and used an ultrasound machine to see how much was left in my bladder. 400-600mls was still there the entire day and night. A nurse convinced me to take a shower, which felt like a big milestone being able to shower alone. I didn’t wash my hair, but feeling fresh and using clean towels was a really nice ritual giving me some semblance of normality. 

Morning of Day 3 my surgeon was furious the catheter hadn’t been reinserted and made the nurses do so immediately to alleviate the pressure in my belly and prevent an infection.. This ment spending a 3rd night in hospital… I was pretty defeated by this point as I really did want to go home. This wasn’t super fun being awake for the inserting of the catheter, but honestly it wasn’t bad at all. The worst part was just having to walk around the hospital carrying a catheter around. I spent the day getting up to do lots of laps of the hospital ward and also managed to have my first coffee. Took another shower and enjoyed visits from my family. 

My appetite was pretty good the entire time in hospital. The food was excellent! They served me 3 main meals a day which I ordered on a sheet of paper the day before. They also had tea service twice a day so I had peppermint tea and usually a nice cake or cookie. Breakfasts I usually had a banana and some yoghurt. Lunch was sandwiches, soups, and spaghetti bolognaise. Dinners were steamed fish, chicken bake, and more hearty soups. My nurses have stressed the importance of protein to heal, so I made sure I had some in every meal while in hospital. 

Day 4 started early with a visit from my surgeon and instructions on how to get the all clear to go home. The catheter was taken out and I had to make sure that every time I went pee there was less than 150ml left in my bladder. This was monitored throughout the day and I was finally cleared to go home at 3:30pm. My husband came to pick me up and collect my things. I had a pillow in the car to put over my belly to protect it from the seatbelt which was super helpful. The ride home was quite uncomfortable but I managed. At home I’ve got a recliner chair that has been my favorite place to sit. The worst part about going home was getting in bed that first night. I had a wedge pillow and my husband to help me, but it was hard and painful. This action triggered a flair up of the gas pain in my shoulder and an absolute meltdown. Thankfully a bit of melatonin knocked me out and helped me sleep through the night. 

I’m now 12 days post-op and feeling good! I’m just taking ibuprofen and Nurofen for inflammation and a tiny bit of pain. I had to keep wearing the compression socks for a week after I got home, hubby had to help get these on and off. I took a stool softener in hospital and they sent me home with a bunch. I continued taking this until about day 10 post. I had my first BM the morning after arriving home and have continued every morning since. I’m off the hospital ones and everynight am just taking a Coloxyl with senna. I’m enjoying walking around the neighborhood and shopping centres (although still very slow and quite winded!) and rides in the car with my pillow are just fine. I’m not allowed to lift anything heavier than my dinner plate, bend, reach, lift for a total of 6 weeks. My incision sights aren’t giving me any grief thankfully and I’ve managed to sleep on my side the past few nights. I live in long flowy dresses, a bralette, big stretchy undies (Chantelle soft stretch seamless briefs), and slip on shoes (crocs and birkenstocks).  I’m sleeping in the big nighties and keeping my routine very simple. My appetite is great, I’m glad I didn’t stock up on too much soup as I would have gone insane. I’m enjoying going out for meals and coffees with friends. I got a facial yesterday and am heading for a pedi today! Trying to find nice things to do to keep me occupied during this quiet time. As hopefully next time I'm in this position I'll have a brand new baby!

I’m lucky I had medical leave from my work to recover. My job is very physical and have a total of 9 weeks off. (combined medical leave with my work’s annual 6 week holiday) I’ve got my post op appointment 6 weeks post and hoping I’ll be cleared to bend again!

*Overall takeaway - I didn’t need to freak out and it was way less painful than I expected. Accept needing help for 6-weeks post op.*

* Noise canceling headphones 
* Sleep app (calm or headspace) with white noise and sleep stories 
* Book
* Oversized nightie/shirt dress

* Melatonin
* Easy to prepare meals when hubby is at work (grilled cheese, hummus & veg, yoghurt and fruit) 
* Lots of TV shows
* Books
* Car Pillow (just a normal pillow, didn’t buy anything special)
* All my clothes in my closet where I can reach without bending

1h8hog2,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlinePsychic/comments/1h8hog2/has_a_psychic_reading_ever_come_true_for_you/,Has a Psychic Reading Ever Come True for You?,"A few years ago, I hit a rough patch in my life—classic mid-20s confusion. My career was stagnant, my love life nonexistent, and I felt like I was running in circles. One afternoon, a friend convinced me to see a psychic she’d been raving about. I was skeptical but also intrigued. ""What’s the worst that could happen?"" I thought. 🤷‍♀️

The psychic was this warm, quirky woman with a tiny storefront filled with crystals and the smell of sage. After a brief introduction, she dove straight in without asking me anything. *“You’re in a crossroads in life,”* she said. Obvious, right? But then she got specific.

She told me: *“You’ve been offered a change at work—a different path entirely—but you’re hesitating because you don’t think it fits your plan.”* 🛑 Okay, now she had my attention. I hadn’t told anyone, but just two days earlier, my boss had offered me a position in a completely different department. I was unsure about it because it felt risky.

Then came the kicker. She said, *“If you take it, you’ll meet someone who will change your personal life too. Tall, glasses, very outdoorsy.”* She added with a smile, *“You’ll recognize them because they’ll talk about coffee within the first five minutes.”* ☕ I honestly laughed out loud at how specific it was.

Fast forward a month. I reluctantly took the job, figuring, “Why not?” Sure enough, during a team-building hike (outdoorsy!), I was introduced to a new colleague. Tall, glasses, the works. Within minutes, he was debating the best way to brew coffee. I nearly dropped my water bottle. 😳

We’ve now been dating for three years, and it’s the most grounded, supportive relationship I’ve ever been in. On top of that, the job move turned out to be the best decision for my career—I’ve been promoted twice since then.

Do I think every psychic can pull off something this spot-on? Probably not. But this experience taught me to keep an open mind. Sometimes, what feels like chance or intuition might be a little nudge from the universe—or someone who’s really tuned in to it. ✨

So, if you’ve had your doubts about psychics, I get it. But every once in a while, you hear or experience something that’s just too uncanny to ignore. Whether it’s fate, intuition, or something mystical, I’m grateful for the guidance that day. 🌟",1,1733536090.0,OnlinePsychic,0,1.0,False

At first, the question seemed dumb... but the term ""smart"" applies to a lot of different ways of thinking. In short terms; Yes, you need more than just skill to climb your way up the fixer ladder.

""Well, let me ask you this, Hod. Define the word *smart* in such context.""

The short but sweet twig of a woman paused, as if she was gathering her thoughts before she gave her answer. ""Well, I've talked with Roland a lot, and we've been discussing the ongoings of a fixer ever since we were cast into the outskirts."" She stopped for a moment. ""Hearing your own stories and comparing them with his, its evident that you are as strong and as cunning as the city-folk say... but speaking with you two normally has, erm... its clear you two think differently.""

I nodded my head, and sat down on the coffee table in my own floor. I grabbed a pack of cigarettes and a lighter, and after a few huffs of tobacco, I spoke. ""Correct me if I'm wrong, but what you're asking is if the **mindset** of a fixer determines a fixer's strength?""

Hod sheepishly nodded her head in response. ""Alright, that's tough to answer. A lot of fixers have really self-destructive mindsets, yet they've risen to Grade 1, or even Color status. So, let me tell you something that happened recently, and before I do... **you didn't hear it from me if Angela comes a-knocking.**""

I sat back, and gathered my thoughts, before leaning forward. I began to recount the event, picturing it in my mind with a perfect clarity.

""One day, I was observing the outskirts and the city from my library balcony. It was early in the morning, and I had gone out there to have a cigarette, with my only comapny being Binah. She made the decision to come and join me, not to smoke, but to simply be present alongside myself. The former arbiter slyly grinned at me, as she normally did. I was the one who defeated her in L. Corp, so she often teased me. Even now, I have to put up with it, as Angela would have our heads if I fly off the rails...""

""Unexpectedly though, Roland, Angela's friend and a former color fixer, had come to join us.""

""Now, it had only been a few days since we had been expunged, and due to this, we have not been able to get proper rest. Not that we needed it too much, but Roland needed it the most.""

""Roland staggered in, dreary eyed and clearly half asleep. The words 'I am not a morning person' had been written all over him, as he shambled into the overlook like a zombie, gnawing on a poorly put-together bagel. He waltzed up to an open space adjacent to me and he rested his arms on the wooden border, squinting his eyes. It became clear that the sun was beaming directly onto his face, ruining both his breakfast and his slow awakening.""

""He sat there, nibbling on that bagel like a rodent, as the sun made him look like he was covered in reflective white chalk. He looked as though he was trying to remember how to be alive. It was agonizing to watch, even for a color fixer like me. Binah was doing her best not to choke on laughter, as she would have spit her black tea everywhere if she cracked.""

""Suddenly, Roland finished chewing. The barely-conscious color fixer clicked his tongue, and he called upon The Light for a moment and pressed his finger to his ear, as if he was using an earpiece to dial someone. In a horrendous, garbled morning voice, the pale fixer spoke. 'Yeah, its Roland. Could you rotate the library a bit? Yeah. 15 degrees clockwise. Thanks.' And then, the light in his fingertips faded.""

""There was a noticeable and audible rumbling beneath us and the entire library shifted. The City in the distance moved eastward ever so slightly and the sun changed position. The light of the blazing orb in the sky shifted off of Roland's face and onto the wall behind him. Then, he blinked a few times and took another bite out of his bagel.""

""Both Binah and I realized what he had just done. It was as if the pin of a grenade just hit the floor, and we were waiting for it to explode. For the first time in a long time, both Binah and myself looked completely dumbfounded, starstruck by the beauty of what we just witnessed. It was overwhelming the two of us, and looking back, it still is.""

I was going to have Hod guess what that was, but she was lost in my story. She stood there, waiting for me to continue.

""*sigh* alright... The color made a simple request of Angela, our director to adjust the rotation of the library by about 15 degress clockwise. It was just enough so that the sun would be moved off of his face and onto the wall behind him.""


""I want to emphasize this. Roland had just moved a ***billion-tonne*** spire of heartwood and knowledge, for the sole purpose of getting ***the sun out of his eyes*** so he could **properly** enjoy his **bagel**.""

""Both Binah and myself were in awe. Roland slowly picked up his bagel, and we waited with baited breath.""

""Now, normally I refrain from complimenting someone for anything at all, but in that very moment I was equally appalled at the thought of his genius escaping him, and intrigued by the way he used that very same genius for such trivial purposes. Binah, was, and to some extent still is, equally fascinated and horrified. We came to realize that Roland may never be able to appreciate that eureka moment born of both his own practical thinking and unbridled laziness.""

""Between bites, the color noticed that we were staring at him, completely blown away. We also looked rather silly. Instead of questioning or speaking with us, he simply... paused. He then shot us a subtle grin, before he returned to gnawing on his bagel.""

Hod stood there, patiently awaiting my answer.

""In summary, a fixer's mindset and line of thinking does play a part in their strength, but more importantly, their career. Credit for anything Roland has done is... long overdue, no matter what we think of him. So, yes. A fixer's mindset is a vital component that influences their career.""

Hod smiled for a moment. ""That was some... incredible story telling, Gebura. You should join my book club in the Floor of Litera-""

In a different space had done a feature wall in Benjamin Moore Supernova which is about an LRV of 10 or so, with like a Manchester tan kind of beige on the other walls and it worked really well.

But then was wondering about the north light and how dark it's going to be and if something like Benjamin Moore Swiss Coffee or White Dove would be a better choice and then a feature wall that was not quite as dark for the back because it does need something otherwise it's going to feel super institutional, I think.

Or do the whole place in LRV 10 paint with white trim instead?

1h8h8fu,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1h8h8fu/would_you_want_an_honest_reason_for_getting/,Would you want an honest reason for getting friend-zoned?,"I’m (18F) in kind of a weird situation. I’ve been talking to someone (19M) for a few weeks now, and it’s definitely not platonic but it’s also definitely not anything serious. We talk basically everyday about random stuff and he asked me to go to a coffee shop with him this weekend. It’s not like we’ve ever explicitly flirted, like definitely nothing close to calling eachother attractive or saying that we like eachother, but also I feel like most college guys wouldn’t just talk to a girl everyday and ask her to coffee in a platonic way. He also asked me out once a few months ago and I said no then because I was going through a lot, so now that we’re talking again it definitely feels like there’s a non-platonic vibe. 

Recently, a friend from childhood confessed feelings for me. I liked him (19M) for a really long time but never really did anything about it, and I only stopped having a massive crush on him in the past few years as I’ve met other guys. We had very seperate lives. Like I put my feelings aside so much to the point where him and I could talk about other romantic interests to eachother. So he’s been out of my head for a while until recently we met again and he confessed. I guess I’m not as over him as I thought. Because now I really want to give this a try. 

My question is how I should proceed with the first guy? Would you rather be told directly “I think you’re amazing, but I want to give the other guy a chance.” Or would you rather get a vague “I just want to be friends.” ?",11,1733534702.0,AskMenAdvice,62,0.87,False

Jerry and Kramer are seated in their usual booth. Kramer is animatedly talking while Jerry sips his coffee, looking skeptical.


Kramer: I’m telling you, Jerry, haggling at the farmer’s market is an art form. You see a bunch of heirloom tomatoes? You don’t just pay for them. You engage. You make them feel like they’re getting a deal while you’re getting a deal. It’s a mutual exchange of satisfaction.


Jerry: (Dryly) It’s tomatoes, Kramer, not a hostage negotiation.


Kramer: Oh, but it is! You gotta show ‘em you’re serious, but you’re willing to walk. The secret is in the pause. You hold the tomato, you look them in the eye, and you say, “I don’t know... looks a little soft.”


Jerry: And then they tell you to get out of the way so someone else can buy it.


George enters, exasperated, and slides into the booth next to Jerry. He lets out a long sigh.


Jerry: (Glancing over) And here he is, the master of contentment.


George: (Ignoring him, launches into a rant) You know what the worst thing about dating a young, beautiful woman is?


Jerry: (Feigning curiosity) That it’s you who’s dating her?


George: No! It’s that she has a young, beautiful life! My girlfriend Lexie—she's stunning, Jerry. Perfect hair, perfect smile. And her apartment? Upper East Side, million-dollar view! And the bathroom? Oh, Jerry, the bathroom is like a sanctuary. It’s secluded, it’s private, it’s got the good toilet paper. I could live in there!


Jerry: Sounds like paradise. So what's the problem?


George: (Groaning) The brother, Jerry. Ronald. He lives there too. Ronald with his good deeds, his ethics, his endless supply of chipperness. He’s like a human sunrise! He’s always there, being good. I can’t set the mood! How am I supposed to relax when Mother Teresa’s male twin is making organic tea in the kitchen?


Kramer: (Nods sagely) He sounds like the kind of guy who’d pay full price at the farmer’s market. Take all the fun out of it.


George: (Pointing at Kramer) Exactly! That’s what he does! He takes the fun out of everything! The guy probably volunteers to pay extra just to help the struggling farmer. Meanwhile, I’m over here trying to get a bargain on my dignity!


Jerry: So let me get this straight. You’ve got a gorgeous girlfriend, a luxury apartment, and a private bathroom, but your only issue is her ethical brother?


George: (Nods vigorously) He’s too ethical, Jerry! He’s a walking guilt trip. I can’t compete with that. I’m a man, Jerry. I’m not built for goodness.



Jerry’s Apartment


Jerry is on the couch eating cereal when his phone rings. He picks it up.


Jerry: Hello?


George: Jerry! Big news! I’m at Lexie’s apartment. Alone. Finally! No Ronald!


Jerry: No Ronald? You mean the guy who brought you fresh-squeezed orange juice the last time you were there?


George: (Scoffs) Fresh-squeezed. What am I, a parched field hand? This guy, Jerry, he’s too good. Everything he does is good. He volunteers, he recycles—he even returns his shopping cart to the corral!


Jerry: (Sarcastically) The nerve of him. A true monster.


George: (Excitedly) But not tonight! He’s in Nicaragua on some humanitarian mission. Distributing food and supplies or whatever they do down there. And me? I’ve got the apartment. No Ronald. No interruptions about giving back to the world. Just me, Lexie, and this Upper East Side palace. I’m thinking music, dim lights, maybe I’ll even light a candle—


Suddenly, Lexie rushes in, crying and clutching her phone.


Lexie: Oh my God, George! It’s Ronald!


George: (Immediately panicking) Ronald? What, he’s back? Already?!


Lexie: No, no! He’s still in Nicaragua. He’s been kidnapped by a gang. They’re holding him for ransom!


Jerry: (On the phone, sarcastic) Nicaragua? Kidnapped? You see, George, this is why I don’t travel. Too many machetes.


George: (Whispering to Jerry) I gotta go. This sounds serious.


George hangs up and turns to Lexie.


George: So...what’s the plan here?


Lexie: (Frantically dialing her phone) I’m wiring the money right now! They want $5,000.


George: Five grand? That’s...a lot of money for Ronald. I mean, after all he's given back already...


Lexie: (Glares at him) George! This is my brother!


Lexie transfers the money, but her phone beeps with an error message.


Lexie: No, no, no! My bank froze my account! They’re asking for more money.


George: More money? (Growing uneasy) You already gave them five grand. What are they running there, a layaway program?


Lexie: George, can you help?


George: (Stammering) Me? Help? Oh, Lexie, I would, but you see, the thing is...if they didn’t let him go after five grand, what’s another few thousand gonna do? It’s basic economics.


Lexie: (Incredulous) Are you serious right now?! My brother is in danger!


George: (Awkwardly) Look, Ronald is a good man, but if you give them more, it just encourages them. It’s like feeding pigeons in the park.


Lexie bursts into tears and storms out, leaving George standing alone in the apartment.


Later Scene: Jerry’s Apartment


George bursts in, exasperated.


George: Can you believe this, Jerry? She wanted me to pay! I’m not an ATM!


Jerry: (Dryly) Well, you’re certainly not making any deposits into this relationship.


George: What was I supposed to do? Pay the ransom and just trust the foreign bad guys? At least write me a receipt so I can write it off my taxes...


Kramer: (Sliding in) Did I hear you say Lexie’s brother is being held for ransom? I’ve read about this. The key is to negotiate. Start low, make a counter-offer. You know, like haggling for fruit at the farmer’s market.


George: (Sarcastic) Oh great, thanks, Kramer. I'll call Lexie right now and tell her to pretend her brother is a five dollar orange.


Kramer starts pacing and miming hostage negotiations, while George collapses onto the couch in defeat.


Scene: George’s Apartment


George is sitting at his cluttered kitchen table, holding the phone to his ear. He’s visibly tense, his free hand gesturing wildly as he tries to keep his composure.


George: (Into the phone) They’re keeping him in a dog cage, you say? Of course, he’s family, we have to do everything we can... yeah, about that...


He pauses, his eyes darting around as he searches for the right words.


George: Well, have you tried... negotiating with them? Think of it like hagg— realizes mid-word No, no, no. Nervous laugh Forget I said that.


George’s face goes pale as Lexie explains more.


George: Uh huh. Uh huh. They threatened to do what?! Lexie, this is all a bit overwhelming, but you have to see this from a rational perspective—


Suddenly, from the other room, Estelle Costanza’s voice pierces through.


Estelle: GEORGE! Are you going to fix the remote or do I have to sit through commercials like an animal?!


George: (Covering the receiver, yelling back) Ma! I’m dealing with something over here!


He hears a click on the line and looks down at the phone, panicked.


George: Hello? Lexie? Lexie?!


He pulls the phone away from his ear and stares at it, defeated.


George: (Muttering to himself) The guy’s in a dog cage, and now I’m in the doghouse.


He slumps back in his chair, exasperated, as Estelle’s voice continues to shout from the other room.


Estelle: GEORGE, I’M MISSING MY STORIES!


George closes his eyes and rubs his temples.


George: Sighs I should’ve just paid the ransom...


Scene: Jerry's Apartment


Jerry, Elaine, and Kramer are watching TV. George is sitting tensely, fidgeting with his hands. The TV suddenly cuts to a “Breaking News” segment.


News Anchor (V.O.): We interrupt your program with breaking news. Ronald Whitman, a local philanthropist who was held hostage in Nicaragua, has just landed safely at JFK Airport.


The cast sits up straight, their attention locked on the screen. George’s eyes dart nervously.


Reporter (V.O.): The exchange was set to go smoothly, but sources say the ransom payment was delayed unexpectedly.


George starts to squirm in his seat.


Reporter (V.O.): During the delay, Whitman reportedly endured hours of unnecessary torture while his sister desperately scrambled to locate more funds.


George winces and mutters to himself.


George: “Unnecessary torture.” Is there a necessary kind?


The screen shows a clip of Ronald disembarking a plane, looking battered but stoic. Lexie is there, hugging him tightly.


The cast stares at George.


Elaine: (Pointing to the screen) Wow. Look at him, George. That could’ve been avoided.


Kramer: (Shaking his head) Hours of torture, man. That’s rough. I mean, one hour of torture, maybe. But hours? Forget it.


George grabs his coat, standing up quickly.


Jerry: (Raising an eyebrow) You’re not going over there, are you?


George: (Deadpan, eyes wide) Jerry, if you saw this apartment, you would understand. I might be able to save this relationship... and that bathroom.


George heads for the door, pulling it open and stepping out in a hurry.


Jerry, Elaine, and Kramer exchange looks.


Jerry: Well, at least he’s consistent.


Elaine: Yeah. Consistently terrible.


Kramer nods thoughtfully.


Kramer: But I gotta admit, I’d probably check out the apartment too.

We're visiting family in Cali for the weekend and we'll leave here to head home on Monday, so more time on the train than visiting!

We got a roomette for both ways.

The good:
- ""Security"" is a breeze in that there is none. We got in line, scanned our ticket, and walked on the train.
- We felt the room had plenty of space. We worked remotely as much as we could, given the signal (more on that later)
- Room was quiet and we barely ever heard anyone nearby, unless they were moving through the hallway.
- We had personal items in the room and our carry on were a few steps away in the hallway which was super convenient.
- Our attendant was very nice and attentive
- An unexpected delight was the ""forced socialization"" during meals. The attendants always assigned multiple parties at one table and it was a fantastic way to meet people. I think this was my favorite part. It's almost like a bread in breakfast type vibe.
- We were 30 mins early to Sac!

The meh/bad:
- We read a lot of reviews saying the food was surprisingly good but I did not feel that was the case, and I'm very forgiving when it comes to this. It was pretty much cafeteria food. Felt like a lot of items had been sitting around heating up and then plopped on a plate. They also frequently ran out of things (ex: coffee at breakfast??)
- Diner attendants were borderline awful. No politeness, rushed us around, and poor communication. This was the worst part IMO. 
- We were 2-3 cars back from the engines and could hear the horns pretty well. It didn't necessarily keep us up at night but it didn't help us fall asleep.
- Sleep in general was just okay. Not good but not terrible. Woke up a few times in the night but I didn't expect deep, amazing sleep anyways.
- I think this is well known but signal was hit or miss, but better than I expected. Outside of Denver to somewhere outside of Glenwood Springs was the worst. Some spottiness through the mountains in Cali too. But I had a few hours each day with good 5G service to do a little work.

Overall, we are very pleased and expect to do a trip by train at least once a year from here on. We feel that it's like voting with our dollars - we want this to become more mainstream with better service and options.

I’ve been quietly working on something special—a coffee table book that captures Downtown Frederick in its most magical moments. From the first blooms of spring to summer’s golden light, autumn’s bold colors, and the serene beauty of snow-covered streets, each page is a tribute to the place we call home.

Every detail in this book was carefully chosen, and hours were spent crafting a story for each season that celebrates Frederick's unique charm. It’s more than a collection of photos—it’s a love letter to the city and its ever-changing beauty.

1h8gwxs,https://www.reddit.com/r/ConsultantDoctorsUK/comments/1h8gwxs/residents_my_arse/,Residents my arse ,"I struggle to call the new junior doctors ""residents."" I'm often in the hospital before them and leave long after they're gone. They don't know the patients, and many will exception report for staying five minutes late, despite arriving 30 minutes late, coffee in hand.

When did this all change? When did consultants essentially become the juniors?

Hospitals are now employing locally employed doctors (LEDs) in droves. Many of them are excellent academics but have no NHS experience. They often require extended shadowing and significant hand-holding throughout their tenure. And yet, someone blindly signs their CREST form, and they move on to training.

**What about the pay?**

In the US, resident doctors earn the following (based on a quick search):

|Residency Year|Average Salary (USD)|Average Salary (GBP)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Year 1|$56,150|£44,045|
|Year 2|$58,290|£45,722|
|Year 3|$60,634|£47,548|
|Year 4|$63,634|£49,897|

We all know the gruelling work schedules US residents endure—they're ""residents"" in every sense of the word.

Now, let’s compare that to the UK. Most locally employed doctors are still on the old contracts because trusts haven’t bothered to transition them. Many SHOs are on the MN35 pay scale with 1:4 weekends, which gives them 50% banding. With this setup, an SHO doing a 1:4 weekend can earn banded pay as follows:

|Grade Code|Pay Point 1|Pay Point 2|Pay Point 3|Pay Point 4|Pay Point 5|Pay Point 6|Pay Point 7|Pay Point 8|Pay Point 9|Pay Point 10|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|MN13|£48,123|£50,904|£53,685||||||||
|MN15|£58,833|£62,448|£66,061.50||||||||
|MN39|£62,625|£66,238.50|£71,286|£74,338.50|£78,019.50|£81,702|||||
|MN35|£62,625|£66,238.50|£71,286|£74,338.50|£78,019.50|£81,702|||||
|MN37|£62,625|£66,238.50|£71,286|£74,338.50|£78,019.50|£81,702|£85,384.50|£89,065.50|£92,749.50|£96,432|

This table includes banding. Now think about this—some SHOs are earning close to £82,000 annually. Some registrars are nearing £100,000. Many LEDs negotiate to start at Pay Point 9 or 10 due to years of experience, walking straight into salaries only a few thousand pounds shy of a new consultant.

I’m genuinely exhausted and increasingly bitter watching these part-time doctors, now demanding to be called ""residents."" I would rather choke on my own words than follow that trend.

1h8gw3b,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewWest/comments/1h8gw3b/approached_randomly/,Approached Randomly,"A few months ago, I was approached by two women, probably between 23–28 years old. This happened near Safeway in downtown. I’m not sure how we got into discussing religion, but one of them asked for my number to grab coffee. They originally approached me to ask where I got my tote bag from. However, my tote was pretty gross-looking, and it was really dark out, so I was a little suspicious. Still, I gave them the benefit of the doubt since I didn’t feel scared, and there were lots of people walking nearby.

The second time, it happened inside Safeway. It started the same way—only one girl and she asked about my outfit, then claimed she felt like she had seen me somewhere before. She asked about religion and then asked for my number to attend some Christian-related show.

Has this been happening to anyone else?

Side note: I am religious, but not the kind that randomly approaches ppl and asks about ppl’s faith lol. To each their own. No one should feel pressured to join anything. ",3,1733533657.0,NewWest,10,0.8,False

1h8guhx,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1h8guhx/can_i_still_clutch_this/,Can I still clutch this?,"Aight, I met a very cute girl at evening dance class, 5 weeks later I realized she was probably interested, but not giving me super clear signals, cause she is more of the shy/demure type. Now, last week we had our LAST DANCE lesson. So, game ON right? So after the last class, I said bye to everyone, nice to meet you folks, yada yada... She kinda makes herself available in the hallway for me to ""board the ship"" so to speak. Chit chat, chit chat for 5 mins... And what do I do!?  I ended up chickening out because she seemed ready to get in her car and drive away (granted it was 37 degrees out). So we exchanged pleasant goodbyes and I said ""see you around"".  I almost immediately regret it. Now a day later I am racking my brain to see if there is any way for me to clutch this. My brainstorm yielded these options... Which one sounds best to the wise reddit community? 

1. I happened to remember where she said she works, searched online and found her work email, should I drop her a polite note there and give her my info? Is that TOO creepy? 
2. Said search also revealed her LinkedIn profile, should I befriend and drop a note there? Is that LESS creepy?
3. Our dance teacher is a riot and very nice... Should I ask her to pass along my contact info to her? Community college rules might prevent her from helping me, and would this approach be ANY less creepy?
4. More googling revealed her address, which matches the rough location she alluded to in past conversations. Should I try to hang out at nearby coffee shops and see if I get lucky. She works from home and I bet she might like to work at some of them sometimes. 

Or are there other much better ideas out there that I haven't thought of yet?  Or maybe I just missed my chance, and now I need to make peace and let it go?",1,1733533517.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False
1h8gu5c,https://www.reddit.com/r/HelpMeFind/comments/1h8gu5c/bean_bag_coffee_cup_tray_for_armchair/,Bean bag coffee cup tray for armchair.,"I thought this would be an easy one to find but apparently not. My Google-fu is rusty.

It's a tray for cups or small plates, top is solid but the bottom is a bean bang which allows the tray to sit on any type of armchair arm and adjust to the angle etc. 

Can't remember where we got this one, but looking to buy a new one for Christmas. 

It does not have to be the exact same model, but should have a bean bag base and fit on a sofa arm (not a laptop tray size).

Any UK or Japan online shop or major offline shop that is in every city is fine.

1h8gsko,https://www.reddit.com/r/marriageadvice/comments/1h8gsko/husbands_bad_attitude/,Husband's bad attitude ,"My husband often comes home from work in a bad mood. I understand he has long work days (he leaves the house at 7 am and comes home around 6 pm), while I mostly work from home. Now, don't be mistaken - I do a lot while I'm home. I work a lot, but I also am running errands, keeping the house in order, taking care of our dog, and just daily household tasks. Sometimes I think because I've been 'home', that he believes my fatigue doesn't hold a candle to *his* fatigue. Tonight was another bad mood and I'm having trouble dealing with it. I didn't sleep much last night and spend a good chunk of the day visiting his sister in the hospital after she just had her baby, running errands for Christmas, and ended up getting home just as he was getting home. I feel awful today with the lack of sleep and being on different medications for infertility stuff. When he walked in, I could sense his energy was off. He kissed me hello, but barely said anything. I showed him a couple things I got for our new nephew at the store today and he was very short. I finally said, 'I'm guessing you didn't have a good day at work today?' I waited for a minute, and got no response. Sometimes, he will just ignore me if he doesn't feel like answering me, which drives me insane. I asked, 'did you hear me?' He snapped, 'Can I just be HOME!?'

I haven't said another word to him since. That was 2 hours ago. 

How do I combat this? This is not unusual. He is often in a bad mood when he comes home from work. But what he doesn't realize is that I'm nauseous, have had a bad headache, running on little sleep, all because I'm pumping my body with fertility meds for **US** and I feel like that doesn't get acknowledged at all. It really upsets me. It feels like he is aloud to be tired, and grumpy and snippy because of his long work day, but yet he has no clue what I'm going through, or what I've been putting my body through, for us. 

Now, tomorrow is Saturday. He will most likely be in a great mood (same for Sunday) because he is off. His mood will be drastically different. And I will still have a chip on my shoulder, because he won't apologize and I will still feel resentful tomorrow because he will most likely make breakfast or grab me coffee in the morning, and that's his way of 'making amends', but the attitude problem will go unspoken about. And the day will move along. And I will fester.   

I have brought up this issue in the past many times before. It is rare that he will apologize. He will only justify. ""Well, YOU were asking me a bunch of questions"", or ""YOU knew I didn't have a good day, why didn't you give me space!?"" and he will somehow remind me that he snapped because of something I did and I should understand why. 

It is a circle of an argument that we have. What can I try differently here? Because I'm really checked out right now and do not even want to be near him right now. I need to get my point across that his little attitude is not okay with me and he needs to put his big boy panties on and leave his work at work and not bring it home and take it out on me.

\*If I don't say anything the rest of the night, and continue to hold my ground of not speaking, he will just go to bed later, kiss me goodnight, and then in the morning he will bring me a coffee or something and be sweet as pie and the day will just continue with nothing else said.

Any advice would be helpful.

*I’m walking down the dark street, a flashlight in my hand. There is something on the path! It growls at me, except it’s not a growl. I turn around and run, the Mountain Cat behind me. No not a Mountian Cat, something else. It strikes at me. My back explodes with pain! There is blood. Too much blood.*  
*Bzzipp!*  
*What was that? Everything is suddenly so bright. I’m held down tightly. I’m crying. A needle pricks my neck. A pale hand is wrapped around my wrist, red liquid oozing out of it. Three-colored eyes stare into my soul.*

I jolt awake with a scream. For a moment I’m disoriented. Where am I? Am I back there? Where is *there*?

""Shaviit!""

Mom?

Arms gently wrap around me, as I’m pulled against a chest. Yes, that’s Mom. I’m at home. Safe. I wrap my arms around her, hugging her tightly ""Mom?""  
""Yes, Baby."", she strokes my hair, ""Mom’s here. Don’t worry.""  
The sight tugging of the healing scars on my back returns. It’s grounding in a strange way.  
""Is everything okay?"", Dad appears in the doorway to my bedroom, and my older brother Tharviik stands beside him. Dad has turned on the lights in the hallway, so I can now see them more clearly. They both look worried. And tired. So incredibly tired. A pang of guilt shoots through me. For weeks I’ve been keeping them up with my night terrors. Ever since I was attacked by that Mountain Cat, *because it has been a Mountain Cat, and not something else,* I’ve had these nightmares basically every day. Every night I wake up screaming. And every night my family wakes with me. I don’t want to wake them, but I can’t help it. I cling to Mom even tighter, ""I’m sorry."", I mumble. Mom lets out a heavy sigh. ""Oh, sweetie.""  
Dad comes into the room proper and sits down on my bed. ""You have nothing to apologize for."", he says while rubbing circles on my back. They both try to sound calm and confident, but I can see the underlying worry on their faces. ""How about you sleep in our bed tonight?"", Mom offers, like every night for the past two weeks. I nod, despite myself feeling even more guilty for doing so. I grab my blanket and follow them down the hallway, Mom still holding me close.

The nightmare has already faded from my mind, leaving only the lingering shock behind. And the odd sensation that there is more to this, something important. It feels like something is gnawing at the back of my mind, a memory that should be there, that *is* there, just outside of my reach. But I can’t recall it, no matter how hard I try.

I hate this feeling.

\*\*\*

""Shaviit! Tharviik! Dinner is ready!"" Mom calls from the kitchen. I slide off the couch putting my comic book aside. It’s a new one *The Monster from Another World*. I can’t read *Invasion of the Puppet Makers* anymore. I don’t know why, but every time I try, I can feel a chill traveling up my spine. *~~And there’s the image of the hand on my arm again.~~* *No! What was I thinking again?*  
Normally it would have been my job to set the table, but for the last two weeks, I didn’t have to do anything really. That's the big upside to being attacked by a wild animal and going missing, I’m pretty much out of all my chores right now. The strange thing about the ‚going missing‘ part is, that I’ve apparently been gone for nearly 36 hours! From what I’ve been told, after I hadn’t come home from what should have been a forty-minute walk at most, Mom had started to worry. Dad only learned of this the next morning, when he came home from his night shift only to find Mom in a near manic state, asking him, if I had ever arrived at the quarry. Apparently about two hours after I left, there had been an official warning of a Mountian Cat sighting in the area, and all quarry workers had been advised to take a different, longer route home, so nobody had come by the gravel path until a search party went out to look for me in the morning. The search party eventually found the soup container, the broken flashlight, and what they called 'a concerning amount of blood', even though it could not have been that bad. The wounds on my back are not deep enough for that. *Not as deep as they should have been.*  
*And there‘s one less cut than there should have been for a typical Mountian Cat.*  
Since there hadn’t been any sign of me, the search party had been forced to turn around by dusk. The traps that had been set for the Mountian Cat overnight also yielded no results, so the police cataloged me as ‚most likely dead‘. The policeman I had seen the morning I returned home was apparently in the middle of bringing the news to my family, when Tharviik spotted Avaatli, carrying me in his arms. Avaatli later stated that he had found me in the shrubbery of a cliffside about 160 feet away from the path. My entire family has occasionally been raving about the incompetence of the police and its search party for overlooking that cliffside.  
*It is very strange that they haven’t found me, the Mountian shrubbery isn’t that thick.*  
And the strangest thing about this is, that I can’t remember anything! I’m essentially missing 36 hours! As much as I try to recall it, I can only come up with the memory of the attack itself, which is very fuzzy already, and the next thing I remember clearly is waking up in Avaatli’s arms.

*~~There is bright light on shining metal. A needle is forced into my neck.~~*

*Huh?*

Right. Dinner!

I slide off the couch and make my way into the kitchen. On the dinner table sits a pod with stew, from the smell alone I know that it’s my favorite. I sit down on my chair at the table, since I disappeared Dad always takes the day shifts. There are five places sat at the table. Wait five? ""Mom? Why are there five plates?"", I ask. Mom pulls another pod from the stove. ""Avaatli comes over for dinner."", she answers cheerily.  
*Avaatli. Great.*  
That’s one of the downsides to this situation. Since it was Avaatli that saved my life, my family is beyond thankful to him. And since food is this family’s love language that means that Avaatli is constantly invited to dinner. I know I should be thankful. I *am* thankful! But Avaatli just creeps me out! His stilted speech, his stiff walk, his strange mannerisms, all that is just off! He creeps me out and I can’t change that!

I can hear the front door open. Dad’s voice echoes through the house, ""I’m home!"", he calls. I jump up from my chair and rush into the hallway to greet him. When I come in, Tharvik has already shuffled down the stairs. Being 15 now, he’s no longer one for hugs and kisses, but he lets Dad ruffle his hair. Dad turns his attention to me, ""Shaviit."", he says, as he bends down to hug me, a little tighter than he did before, and kisses the top of my head, his lips lingering for a second. He’s done this since I disappeared. I hug him back, then I notice the man standing behind him. Avaatli. He smiles at me, still a little too tightly. ""Hello, Shaviit. How are you feeling? Better I hope?""  
I cling to Dad, nodding as an answer. Dad looks down at me, shaking his head slightly, while he runs a hand through my hair. At that moment, Mom sticks her head through the kitchen door, smiling, ""Hello, Avaatli!""  
Avaatli bows his head slightly. *Strange.*  
""Good evening, Malishia."", again so stilted.  
Dad strokes my hair, smiling, ""Well let’s get eating. I heard Mom made your favorite.""  
I shake my head. Avaatli saved my life. *I think?* I don’t need to be afraid of him.

Dinner is delicious, as always. I love Mom’s cooking, especially her stew. Dad and Tharviik also dig in, only Avaatli picks at his food, avoiding the meat and at least one vegetable.  
*Rude! He clearly has no taste.*  
After dinner, we migrated into the living room, where we are now sitting around the small coffee table. The conversation jumps from one topic to the next. Mom occasionally rustles around getting some drinks and snacks. I don’t really pay attention to the conversation, reading my comic instead. Usually, I would not have gotten away with this, but I’ve not been scolded for it in the last two weeks. Plus this way I don’t have to pay as much attention to Avaatli.  
""What are you reading there, Shaviit?""  
*Unless Avaatli pays attention to me.*  
I look up at him from my preferred reading spot on the floor. Avaatli is staring at me, scrunching his face up in a strange way. For a moment I stare back. *He saved your life,* I tell myself. Reluctantly I give him my comic. Somehow, this feels like a bad idea. Avaatli looks at my comic with a strange frown on his face, then he smiles at me with his lips pressed to his teeth. ""You really like stories of alien invasion, do you not? Why is that, I wonder?""  
I don’t answer. Why does he phrase it like that? That sounds like he’s interrogating me.  
""Shaviit just loves space."", Dad finally answers for me, after a moment of awkward silence. ""Since he was little he soaked up anything he could find about it.""  
Mom chuckles, ""That’s right. And since they announced the plan for the moon landing even more so.""  
Avaatli continues to smile and stare. *Why doesn’t he blink?* ""I see."", he says, before handing the comic back to me. As I take it from him, I notice something on the back of his hand, a clean-cut scar runs across it. I stare at it. His fingers are tapping the edge of the comic in a strange rhythm.

*I grap a scalpel in panic. I swing it. There is a shout of pain. Red liquid oozes from a pale hand. I’m pinned in an iron grip, pale fingers tapp a strange rhythm.*

My head starts to swirl. The room is spinning and I suddenly feel very dizzy. I feel like I’m about to throw up. I think my head is about to explode. *What is this?* I press both of my hands to my ears in a feeble attempt to stop the ringing. I start to sway. I am vaguely aware of my family calling my name, someone catches my arm, stabilizing me. With some effort, I manage to look up, expecting Mom or Dad, but instead, I’m looking straight at Avaatli. He’s standing behind me, staring down at me, with his strange, unmoving eyes. His hand is on my arm.

*A pale hand clutches my wrist. I look up and see a pair of bright three-colored eyes staring at me.*

*No! Nonononono!*

*Something is wrong here! Something is wrong with him!*

*~~Something is messing with my mind!~~*

My breath quickens. Someone shouts my name. I think I throw up.  
Then I pass out.

\*\*\*

I jolt up. Cold sweat drenches my pajamas. I’m in my bedroom, my comic books are strewn across the floor, a rocked model hangs from the ceiling, and the poster of four planets of our solar system hangs from the wall. The room itself is dark. The door is left ajar, so some light from the hallway comes into the room.  
What happened? Weren’t we having dinner?  
I slide out of my bed. My body feels sore. I shuffle into the hallway, where I can hear voices from downstairs.

""I’m so sorry, Avaatli."", that's Dad, ""I don’t know what happened. He has night terrors, I know that, but this-,"" there’s a pause, ""This is new."" Dad sounds worried.

*Night terrors.* They’re talking about me!

I can hear someone sobbing, ""Oh, my poor Baby!"", Mom?

*What happened?* I try to remember, but I come up empty. Downstairs I can hear Dad trying to comfort Mom. Avaatli’s familiar voice echoes through the hallway. He’s talking to Dad, ""It is fine, Tavliir. I understand. Shaviit has been through a lot. Perhaps he needs more rest?""  
Mom is still sobbing. I feel guilty for making her cry.

""Shaviit!"", my brother's voice startles me. Tharviik stands in the hallway. I can hear steps downstairs. My parents and Avaatli now stand at the bottom of the stairs. Mom hastily dries her eyes with the hem of her apron, before she comes up the stairs, and pulls me into a hug. ""How are you feeling, Baby?"", she asks, while gently creasing the sides of my face. She smiles at me, but I can see sadness in her eyes. I don’t know what to do, so I just hug her tightly, pressing my face into her apron. ""Better."", I mumble. Mom kisses the top of my head, ""That’s good."" Tharviik approaches us, suggesting that I move into the living room, before helping me down the stairs. Dad and Avaatli are still standing in the hallway. Dad gently ruffles my hair, while Avaatli gives me one of his offputting smiles. ""Shaviit, I am glad you are feeling better."", he says. He has his hands behind his back, keeping them out of my sight. I nod in acknowledgment, then I turn to my Dad. ""What happened?"", I ask. Dad looks at me with concern, ""You don’t remember?"" I shake my head.  
""You suddenly got dizzy."", Tharviik informs me, ""Then you threw up on Avaatli, before you passed out.""  
*Oh*. *Oh!* Now I notice, that Avaatli wears a different shirt. I think it belongs to Dad. Blood rushes to my ears in embarrassment. Creepy or not, that couldn’t have been nice. I quickly look away from Avaatli. He continues to smile at me, ""Do not worry, Shaviit. You have been under a lot of pressure lately. I do not blame you. Clothing can be washed."", Avaatli then turns his attention back to my Dad, ""Thank you for the shirt, Tavliir. I will return it to you soon, but I think I will gather my things and leave. Your family needs some alone time."" Avaatli begins gathering his things, including a paper shopping bag which I assume holds the now-ruined shirt. I’m glad he’s leaving. I feel a little bit guilty about it. Logically, Avaatli never did anything to me, but still, he just feels off to me and I can’t change that.

*~~And there are these flashbacks.~~*  
*What?*

Mom turns from me to Avaatli, reaching for the paper bag, ""Let me wash that for you. It’s the least I can do.""  
Avaatli pretty much rips the bag away from her, quickly placing it behind his back. Mom stares at him in confusion. Avaatli smiles at her, somehow even more tense than before, which I would have sworn was impossible.  
""I thank you for the offer, Malishia, but that will not be necessary."" Avaatli quickly gathers the rest of his things, suddenly very hectic. He quickly grabs his coat, says goodbye, and disappears out the door, leaving my still-confused family in the hallway.  
""That was odd."", Mom says.

*See! I told you!*

""Must be the bachelor lifestyle."", Dad says with a chuckle. Mom nods, ""You’re probably right.""

*Oh, come on!*

I’m not given much time to fume over my family's obliviousness, because as soon as Avaatli leaves, I become the sole center of their attention. I’m ushered into the living room and soon find myself on the Couch, bundled up in a blanket, a mug with warm fruit juice in my hands. Dad then announces a big surprise for the family. He drags Tharviik off to help him and they soon reappear, pushing a newly brought Television set into the room, much to my genuine excitement. And so I spend the rest of the evening on the Couch, sandwiched between my Mom and my brother, sipping warm fruit juice and watching a talk show.

\*\*\*

I’m bussing with excitement, checking the clock on the wall for the hundredth time. Today is the day! Today our astronauts will land on the moon! It’s the only thing everybody at school has been talking about for days. No one can concentrate today and our teacher has clearly given up on getting anything done. We basically jump out of our seats as soon as the bell rings. The rocket had launched about three days ago and would land on the moon at roughly 5 in the afternoon. So in nearly an hour. It’s already getting dark outside, as I hurry back home. I don’t want to be outside in the dark. Not anymore.

I bust through the front door as soon as I get home. ""I’m home!""  
Mom and Dad stick their heads into the hallway. They seem to relax slightly when they see me. They also no longer like it when I‘m outside after dark, the first week after I was back in school Mom even brought me to school and picked me up afterward, which was super embarrassing. I know that my parents invited Avaatli to watch the moon landing with us, but he declined, which I’m secretly glad about.

""Hey hurry up, it’s starting!"", Tharviik shouts from the living room. I sprint into the living room, Mom and Dad close behind me, Tharviik is already sitting on the couch. On the TV is the image of a control room, a couple of people sitting at workstations talking in codewords with the rocket‘s crew. The screen then changes, showing the inside of the landing sphere. I can’t believe it! I get to witness the first people landing on the moon! I’ve spent weeks reading and watching everything I could about the moon landing, its process, the rocket, the landing sphere, everything!  
The astronauts are now talking. They’ve completed the landing and are now getting ready to exit the landing sphere. I watch in awe as the first astronaut climbs onto the outer ladder, describing the surface as covered in fine sand. I get more and more jittery as I watch the first man ever step off the ladder and place his foot onto the surface of the main moon!  
""A small jump for one man, but a great leap for all of Naiila!"", he says it. And I couldn’t agree more!  
For the next two hours, we watch as the three men jump around the moon, using the low gravity for great leaps and flips! I’m completely and utterly mesmerized. I still can’t believe it! There are people on the moon!  
The astronauts have only one camera, which they have to carry around with them, so what we see is very limited, but still absolutely incredible!

""I want to become an astronaut!"", I announce to my family. Dad chuckles and ruffles my hair. ""Then you better pay attention in school, because astronauts need to finish university.""  
""Yeah."", Tharviik interrupts, ""And you need to be good at sport.""  
""I know that!"", I shout. I’ve read all about becoming an astronaut, after all! Mom smiles gently at me, ""Of course you do. And I’m sure you can become an astronaut if you only work hard enough.""  
I grin at her, before turning my attention back to the screen, watching the broadcast in amazement. For a second there’s something in the corner of the screen, somewhere in the darkness of space. I could swear, that I saw something bright, blinking up for just a split second. Then it’s gone. *Strange.* Perhaps it’s a star? Or something’s messing with the camera slightly? The moon is pretty far away after all. It can’t be easy to broadcast videos from the moon back to the planet. That must be it.  
I settle back down, continuing to watch in awe, as the first people ever move around outside of our planet and imagining myself in their place.

After the broadcast, I’m sent to bed. Theoretically, anyways. In reality, I babble for nearly another hour about the moon landing, the rocket, the moon itself, the solar system, and anything else related to space I can think of. When Mom and Dad finally manages to wrestle me into bed, I fall asleep fast, for the first time since the incident on the path to the quarry dreaming about my future as an astronaut.

\*\*\*

A loud crash jolts me awake. I look around confused, before sneaking into the hallway. I stick my head out of my bedroom door, to see my family awake as well. My brother stands in the hallway, looking around sleepily, Mom and Dad also appear at their door. ""What was that?"", I ask.  
""I don’t know."", Mom answers.  
Another crash sounds downstairs. I jump, startled. Tharviik also finally seems to wake up properly. I run to him, hugging him in fear. Dad disappears back into his and Mom’s bedroom, only to quickly return with his pickaxe. ""Wait here."", he whispers, before sneaking down the stairs. Mom motions for Tharviik and me to come to her. We obey without question, letting her pull us back into our parent's bedroom, ready to slam the door shut at any moment.  
We stand there, waiting with bated breath, listening for the smallest sound.

The creaking that we hear doesn’t come from downstairs. It sounds like it's coming from the room behind us!

We spin around, Mom pulling Tharviik and me close, peering into the bedroom. A small sliver of light falls through the drawn-shut curtains. I strain my eyes, trying to see anything unusual.

Then anything happens so fast!

The window bursts with a loud shattering sound! Something falls into the room. It’s tall. Four sturdy legs unfold, as the creature grows taller, nearly hitting the ceiling. Its entire body seems to be covered in black scales, as sharp claws gleam in the moonlight. My body goes rigid.

*I’ve seen this before!*

*Something is on the path! I first think it’s a mountain cat, but it’s not! It makes a strange growl!*

*Oh No! Nononononono!*

I scream! I think Tharviik does too. Mom reacts! She grabs us both, pulling us into the hallway, slamming the bedroom door shut, before dragging us down the stairs!  
""Tavliir!"", she shouts, calling for Dad, while running for the door.  
We don’t make it that far.  
Before we can reach the door, there’s another crash from the kitchen! Dad stumbles into the hallway. He still clutches his pickaxe in both his hands. On his left arm, I can see claw marks, thick, blue blood oozes out of them! Dad backs up into the hallway, as another creature follows him, blocking the doorway and with it the main light source.  
Still, I can now see a massive tail dragging across the floor. Its head, shaped like a lizard's, needs to bend down in order to move through the hallway. It growls as it moves towards us.

From upstairs comes another growl. Mom pushes Tharviik and me into the living room, the only way, that isn’t blocked by a monster. Dad follows us, placing himself between us and the monsters in the hallway. ""The window!"", he whispers, ""Quick!""  
I turn around, only to see a third creature through the window. It’s still outside the house. It doesn’t seem to be in a hurry, just waiting, cutting off our only possible escape route. Mom quickly shows me and Tharviik behind her. We’re now sandwiched between Mom and Dad.  
""What is that?!"", Tharviik shouts, while I’m just frozen in horror.  
These are the monsters from my nightmares! How are they here? How are they *real*?  
Mom’s trembling, I notice. As is Dad.

*We’re going to die!*

The thought crosses my mind before I can stop it. I can feel tears running down my cheeks. I cling to Mom’s nightgown tightly. *I don’t want to die!*  
The monster from the kitchen now enters the living room, slowly making its way towards us. I now notice a pair of piercing, yellow eyes. They fixate on me. Cold terror surges through me! I feel the murderous intent coming from the creature.

*I don’t want to die!*

*Bzzipp!*

*Huh?*

The monster in the doorway suddenly throws its head back with a bone-shaking screech. It starts turning around, but before it can finish the movement the sound comes again.  
*I know that sound!*  
The monster's head explodes. Slimy, green goo splatters across the living room floor. I can hear the window shattering, as the other creature jumps into our house with a loud shriek! It dashes through the room, completely ignoring us in favor of charging at the door. It doesn’t get far. Again the strange sound can be heard and again the monster drops, accompanied by a shower of green goo.

My family is still huddled on the floor. I’m trying to process what's happening, why this feels so familiar, as a new shape appears in the door. A very familiar shape.  
""Avaatli?!"", Dad calls out in a mixture of relief and confusion, slowly lowering his pickaxe. Avaatli stares at us, looking somehow sad.  
""Tavliir, I-"", he doesn’t get to finish that sentence as the third monster comes crashing down the stairs. It stops at the entrance to the living room, staring at the dead bodies of his companions, before fixating his yellow eyes on Avaatli, who spun around as soon as he heard the noise. It raises its nose slightly, sniffing the air, before growling low. This growl sounds different than the others.

*""Terrrraann!""*

*Is that a word?*

Avaatli faces the monster. His back is turned towards us, so I can’t see his expression, but his body language alone is enough to frighten me. He doesn’t feel like a person anymore, he feels like a wild predator, staring down its prey. He moves his hand slowly, lifting a weapon I only now notice, pointing it at the monster. It’s a gun, I think? It looks strange.  
Avaatli and the monster stare at each other for what feels like an eternity. Then the creature charges! It raises two of his clawed arms, attempting to strike at Avaatli. But Avaatli is faster. Way faster. *Impossibly fast!* He jumps out of the way of the strikes, the claws not even scratching him, then he fires his weapon twice, and the monster drops to the floor, unmoving.  
The entire thing took probably less than a second. For a moment Avaatli’s gaze lingers on the monster. I can now see his face. His eyes are cold, his expression unmoving, even by his standards. He looks like he feels nothing. A suffocating silence fills the room.

""Avaatli. What- what did you do?"", my Dad finally whispers.

Avaatli joilts, as if being startled by his voice. He finally looks away from the monster and back at my family. Emotions return to his face, so many I can’t possibly decipher them.  
He makes his way across the room, holding a hand out to my Dad.

""There are more on the way. You have to leave. Now!""

\*\*\*

I stumble through the dark. My feet are slipping on the uneven mountain grounds, as we run. Mom is clutching my hand so tightly, that it’s almost painful. My brother, Tharviik, is running beside me, also being dragged along by Mom, Dad is right beside her, his pickaxe still in his hand.

I still haven’t processed, what we are running from. The monsters from my nightmares are real! I still can’t believe it!  
*Except I can. Because I have seen them before.*  
My gaze drifts to Dad’s colleague, Avaatli. He’s still holding the strange gun, which he used to kill the monsters, that had invaded our home. Avaatli saved us.  
*Or he’s our doom.*  
He’s running a good distance ahead of us. He doesn’t seem tired, while we can barely keep up with him.

""Avaatli wait!"", Dad finaly shouts. Avaatli stops, turning around to us. Dad halts for a moment, catching his breath. As a quarry worker, Dad isn’t an unathletic man, but Avaatli's persistent speed is nearly otherworldly. *And I'm slowly growing a terrifying suspicion as to why that is.* Avaatli stares at my Dad in his creepy fashion.    
""What’s going on?"", Dad demands.  
""I will explain later."", Avaatli says, looking somewhat sad, and perhaps a bit guilty. ""Come we are almost there.""  
Avaatli turns back around and continues running. And we follow. What other choice do we have?

After a while, we finally reach a small hut. It is truly ridiculously small and poor. Avaatli pushes the door open, motioning for us to get inside. The inside of the hut is literally just one, sparsely furnished room, a stove, a table with a single chair, and a bed, that's it. I wouldn’t even call this a hut, this is a barrack. ""*This* is where you live?"", Mom asks in slight horror. Avaatli doesn’t answer. He closes the door behind us, positioning himself in front of it. His gaze fixates on my family, a strange expression on his face. A shiver runs up my spine. *He blocks the only way out.* Something is wrong. I suddenly feel trapped. I feel in danger! I tuck at Mom’s nightgown, ""Mom?"", I whisper, trying to get her attention. My eyes never leave Avaatli. Avaatli’s expression shifts. *Is it guilt? Oh no!*

""I am so sorry for this, please forgive me.""

A strange gas suddenly fills the room, quickly. Too quickly! I start coughing. Next to me, Tharviik hits the ground, unmoving! Mom screams in terror, then she too drops to the ground! Dad braces himself against the wall, glaring at his so-called friend, ""Why?"", he manages between coughs, then he also drops!  
I fall to my knees. My body quickly loses its strength. My head goes fuzzy.

I know this feeling!

*A pale arm holds me pinned. A needle pricks my neck. I go limp and my head becomes fuzzy. A voice echoes through my mind. ""It pains me to do this. But for you, it is best to think of all this as nothing but a dream.""*

""I am sorry. I truly am, but you do not leave me a choice.""

With much effort, I look up at Avaatli. The gas seems to stop a short distance in front of him. ""You."", I rasp, staring at his guilt-felt face. ""Puppet Maker!""
