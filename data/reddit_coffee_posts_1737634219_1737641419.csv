**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop. So click on one of the links above so you can get your very own copy of “MomPreneurs”, a very serious well thought out business guide for moms.*  ",1,1737640898.0,OOALMarketing,0,1.0,False

I am at my wits end.,"We moved to a new state for a job opportunity for my husband about 2.5 years ago. It was/is a great opportunity in terms of a substantially larger income. Of note, we hate it here, however that's another story and my husband is adamant we are here and that's final. 
I work full time, remotely, which allows flexibility in terms of caring for the house, kids, etc as well. I do not make near what he does. 
Here is the issue. My husband is obsessed with his job. Admittedly obsessed. He works mainly from home, in his basement office, and will be down there from morning until night. Then go back down until sometimes 11-12 o'clock at night once the kids go to bed. 
He admits he is scared of failing, that he is basically obsessed with money, and told me work comes first before everything and is the priority. 
He does the bare minimum, and tells me hire help if I can't keep up. He says he feels like he does a good job bc he shows up to the kids games/recitals etc. 
we get into heated arguments about it. 
He tells me he's done talking about it, yells at me when I bring it up and just says ""I work a lot. That's it.""
He stonewalls me constantly. 
When I try and support - bring meals downstairs, bring coffee etc, sometimes he'll get mad and say ""I'm fine. I didn't ask for it""
Typing this I sound like some submissive wife- I swear that's not the case. 
I'm unhappy. I worry about him. 
We have no friends or support here. 
He's lost interest in all his hobbies. 
He does nothing but work, sleep, and do kids stuff as needed. 
He's irritable and I am constantly walking on eggshells. 
The ironic part is I was offered a very good job back where we came from, and he has squashed that too, saying there is nothing there for him there and what would he do. 
I'm lonely and feeling like I don't even know what to do. 
I walk around just keeping the peace and pacifying everything, so he can't say I'm nagging about overworking. 

I'm at a loss. I'm depleted. I'm spent. And I have no idea what to do. 

He won't talk, won't see therapy, will not entertain any conversation about his work habits without screaming at me. 
WTH do I do from here. 

Tl;dr: husband overworks, is obsessed with his job, is angry and irritable, in a place with hate to top it off. He tells me this is it, and told me nothing will change. ",2,1737640815.0,marriageadvice,1,1.0,False

I was always there for her. When she needed help around the house, I stepped in without a second thought. I made her coffee every morning, listened to her talk about her day, and planned little surprises to see her smile. She was my partner, my best friend, and the center of my world.

But she betrayed me.

I don’t even know how it started. Maybe it was the way she’d turn her phone away when I walked into the room. Or how she suddenly had ""late nights"" at work. I trusted her, but something felt off. Eventually, I couldn’t ignore the signs.

I confronted her. She didn’t deny it. She admitted everything with barely a trace of guilt. I don’t know what hurt more—her words or the emptiness in her eyes as she said them.

Still, I tried to move forward. I told her we could rebuild, that my love for her was strong enough to weather the storm. But she didn’t want that. She had already made her choice, and it wasn’t me.

Now here we are. I’m sitting in our living room, staring at the remnants of the life we built together. The silence in the house is deafening, but at least Catheline is here, sitting across the room.

""You didn’t deserve me,"" I say softly, staring at her. She doesn’t respond, of course. She hasn’t said a word all evening.

I get up and walk over to her, my voice trembling. ""I gave you everything, Catheline. My love, my time, my heart. And you threw it all away.""

I kneel beside her, looking into her lifeless eyes. It’s strange how still she is now, how quiet. A part of me thought I’d feel better, but the weight in my chest hasn’t lifted.

I sigh, leaning back. ""It doesn’t matter now,"" I whisper. ""None of it matters anymore.""

As I sit there in the silence, I realize this house feels less like a home and more like a tomb. I close my eyes, ready to end it all.

Maybe then, I’ll finally have peace.

1i83pox,https://www.reddit.com/r/vuejs/comments/1i83pox/bike_shedding_question_for_those_who_use_element/,[Bike Shedding] Question for those who use Element+ UI framework...,"## Background (You can skip this)

Vue allows us the flexibility to use <PascalCase /> components or <kebab-case /> components in templates. There are cases where kebab-case is required for writing in-DOM templates because HTML is case insensitive. The Vue project I work on does not use/need in-DOM templates, so this distinction isn't really relevant to me.

I also work on a Mac, which uses a case-insensitive file system by default, which can rarely lead to issues when using version control systems like Git when moving and/or renaming files, etc. I've been bitten by this once or twice in the past, but that's over many years of dev work, so it's really not an issue to worry about too much (and there are fixes/workarounds for when it does pop up).

So, objectively, there isn't much reason for me to prefer one style over another. On the other hand, there are two *weak* (""just in case"") reasons to prefer kebab-case, so that's what I did in my first Vue project.

However, it *appears* to me that almost everyone else uses PascalCase for components, so I thought that for this next project I would go ahead and be like the cool kids and just use PascalCase.

## Actual Question(s)

We're using Element+ for our UI framework. All of the examples for the Element+ (e.g., https://element-plus.org/en-US/guide/quickstart.html) use kebab-case. If you use Element+ (or not- I guess it doesn't really matter), here are some questions for you:

1. Do you use kebab-case or PascalCase for your components?
2. Do you use kebab-case or PascalCase when referring to Element+ components in your templates?
3. If your answers to 1 and 2 are *different*, what is your reasoning/convention/philosophy?

I ask this because the Vue style guide(s) I've read have made the argument that PascalCase is preferable for custom components because it's easy to scan a Vue template and distinguish native HTML elements from our custom components. So, I had a thought that it might make some amount of sense to use kebab-case for the framework components while also using PascalCase for our custom components, for basically that same reason. The difference is that the lowercase/kebab-case components are not *only* native HTML elements, but it instead helps us distinguish ""things that are not our code"" and ""things that *are* our code"".

We are very used to going to all-inclusive resorts, so my mind is reeling right now with all of the costs we are still going to incur on an Alaskan Solstice cruise in June. When we hear “all-inclusive” we really expect to have everything included. 

Clearly, we are new to cruising, and I’m trying to figure out where we can avoid more costs. We gave our travel agent a budget, and the cruise itself was barely in that budget, then we had to add on airfare, plus expensive hotels before and after the cruise. 

We are used to paying for excursions, but holy cow! They’re hella expensive! And when she said food was included, I didn’t know that that only meant to certain restaurants, and that we’d have to pay to go to most of them on board. We have a standard drink package, but it looks like we will have to avoid premium alcohols and wines to avoid additional charges? 

Something else I’m unclear about… we are in aqua class. I see that we can get complimentary continental breakfast thru room service, but will we get charged a service fee each time? We like to get coffee delivered each morning while we get ready for the day. Walking like zombies with bed hair to a location to get it and take back to the room isn’t being thoughtful to fellow travelers, but I’d prefer to have to do that over a surprise $12 fee each day. 

I see we have access to Blu restaurant, but we’d still pay for each meal there, correct?

In a way that means more than just you;  
A way that tells stories,  
Of silly futures passed  
And let me hold you close to me  
When I hold nothing but your heart.

I wish to call to you  
And watch your eyes search the crowd,  
To see the softness in your gaze and the sigh in your breath,  
And watch you fall in love with me like the very first time.  
To take my hand and keep me close,  
As if the rest of the world could not exist  
Living simply in the way you look at me,  
Living somewhere I feel loved.

I wish to whisper your presence  
And feel your warmth on my skin,  
Listening as hearts flutter and laugh,  
Dancing on sweet tension  
Living on gazed desires  
That murmur, “God, I love her.”

I wish to echo your existence  
In all the little things,  
To remember your favourite colours as I wander past them,  
Or pick the flowers on the road I know you love,  
To make my coffee the way you taught me  
And live a life where I become you  
And you become me.

I wish to speak of who you are  
And see myself in the process.  
To reflect on how you’ve grown around me  
And taken me in as a trait of your own,  
Something of a strength, desire or fair quality  
That you are proud to embody,  
To see you enjoy the shared perspective  
And to realise that we share a joy together

One day, I wish to say your name  
And know that you are there,  
With me  
Waiting on nothing but the world,  
Waiting on nothing to say my name back.

1i83jcf,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1i83jcf/hm_the_tale_of_verona/,[HM] THE TALE OF VERONA,"It was a sunny afternoon in the bustling town of Verona, where Juliet sat under the shade of a banyan tree, lost in her thoughts. Majnu, her longtime admirer, had been mustering the courage to ask her out for weeks. Today was the day. He approached her, his heart pounding like a drum.

""Juliet,"" Majnu began, his voice trembling slightly, ""I’ve really enjoyed getting to know you. Would you like to grab coffee sometime?""

But before Juliet could respond, something unexpected happened. Majnu, overcome with nervous energy, let out a loud, involuntary bark like a pure 100% stray dog. Juliet’s eyes widened in shock, and she instinctively started crying. ""What was that?!"" she exclaimed, her voice shaking.

Majnu froze, his face turning red. ""I—I don’t know why I did that,"" he stammered. ""I’m so sorry!""

Before either of them could process what had just happened, Juliet, in a fit of frustration and confusion, began thumping her chest like a gorilla. She grabbed Majnu’s shirt, her emotions spiraling out of control. Majnu stood there, stunned, unsure of what to do.

Just as things couldn’t get any stranger, a monkey swung down from the tree above them. It landed between the two, looked at them with DISDAIN, and delivered a swift slap to each of their faces. Then, as quickly as it had appeared, the monkey climbed back up the tree, perched on a branch, and screamed, ""What, man, what?!""

Juliet and Majnu stared at each other, their faces a mix of shock and disbelief. Then, almost simultaneously, they both flipped the monkey the middle finger and scratched their butts in defiance. The monkey screeched and disappeared into the foliage, leaving them alone once more.

For a moment, there was silence. Then, Juliet’s shock turned to disgust. ""What is wrong with you?!"" she shouted, her voice dripping with frustration. ""First you bark like a dog, then you let a monkey slap us, and now you’re scratching your butt like some kind of caveman?!""

Majnu, feeling attacked and embarrassed, retaliated in the only way he knew how. He let out another loud, defiant bark, this time on purpose. ""Woof! Woof!"" he barked, his face red with a mix of anger and humiliation(narrator:mind that Juliet also scratched her butt like a caveman, WHAT A HYPOCRITE).

Juliet stared at him, her mouth agape. ""Are you serious right now?!"" she yelled. ""You’re barking at me? What are you, a literal dog?!""

The tension between them was palpable. But then, something unexpected happened. Juliet, despite her anger, couldn’t help but notice how ridiculous the whole situation was. Her stern expression cracked, and a small giggle escaped her lips. Majnu, seeing her laugh, couldn’t help but chuckle too.

Before they knew it, they were both laughing uncontrollably, the absurdity of the moment washing away their anger. Majnu, emboldened by the laughter, took Juliet’s hand. ""Juliet,"" he said, his voice steady now, ""I know this isn’t how I planned it, but I really care about you. Will you marry me?""

Juliet’s eyes widened again, but this time with joy. Overcome with emotion, she let out a small, unexpected fart. She froze, mortified, but Majnu just grinned. ""Well, that’s one way to say yes,"" he joked.

Juliet blushed, then laughed again. She threw her arms around Majnu and hugged him tightly. ""Yes, Majnu, I’ll marry you,"" she said, her voice muffled against his shoulder.

As they stood there, wrapped in each other’s arms, the monkey reappeared in the tree above them. It let out a final, approving screech and shouted ""Have some dignity!"" before being made uncomfortable as Juliet pointed out his scandalous past with the King of Verona, disappearing into the leaves. Juliet and Majnu looked up, then at each other, and burst into laughter once more.

From that day on, their love story became the stuff of legend in Verona. And whenever they told the tale of how they got engaged, they always made sure to include the part about the barking, the monkey, and the fart—because, after all, it was the chaos that brought them together.

The End.

I'll start out describing the landscape I'm in. I walk down some creaking wooden stairs in a desert like area. The stairs belong to a house but there is no home there. Some of my family are sitting in front of me. In the center of them is a hole in the ground that seemed to get smaller as I walked towards it. I had a baby  in my arms. I believe it was my son, (I don't have kids). My aunt, who is sitting at the edge of the hole that is now about 5-6 foot in diameter puts her arms out asking to hold the baby.her son, about 8 years old is sitting between her legs. I hand her the baby and her son slips a little almost falling into the hole, but is caught by my aunts legs squeezing around him. Now, at the bottom of the hole is the end of a lake about 600ft down. I go to help her son and she just let's go. As he falls we watch as he lands in the shallow water, going limp. I scream to my cousin, through ingredients him my keys to start my car. (My cousin and I don't talk to each other in real life anymore). He catches my keys, and we both start running towards my car. He gets there first and I arrive soon after. My car gradually goes from my piece of shit suzuki to a nice camaro He is removing my driver side tires because they've gone flat. I ask him what the fuck is he doing. He explains that the tires were flat when he got there. Lying on his back h÷ looks at me and tells me he I'd glad myvtires are flat. I ask why and he says because you messed up my nice car. (I wrecked his brother's car, it wasn't my fault, his brother was in jail, he was giving him the car, there was gap insurance on the car and he was happy I wrecked it because he was behind on payments). He stood up and I was walking away, a house that wasn't there before appears in front of me. I start walking through door after door slamming them as hard as I can in anger as my cousin follows and does the same. The house vanishes and I turn and yell at him, ""You know it wasn't my fault."" He swings at me but he Is 10ft from me. His fist connects with my face as his arm stretches to reach me. I do the same,  and we both stand there trading a few punches. It's as if we're hitting each other with otherworldly power but neither of us are fazed by it. I wrap my arm around him two or three times pulling him in. I punch him in the face about 5vtimes as I asked ""what are you going to do about it bitch, I'm punching you in the face."" With blood all over his face he looks at me and smiles with a evil grin. I wake up, and go get coffee remembering the strange dream I just had. This is the first dream I've had where I got into a fight. I searched up why my fight was unrealistic but all I found were people saying that they were weak, and couldn't through a proper punch, and yet my cousin and I fought with otherworldly power. I might even be able to say I won the fight. 

If you read through all of that could anyone that knows more about dreams tell me what my dream might mean, or why my fightvwas so unrealistic. Lastly, why did we both forget about our 8 year old cousin that fell 600ft into a shallow lake.

Hi internet stranger ! I’m just a girl (cue the song ) . I’m hoping to meet a dumbass who is into dumbassery just as much as I am .

I have adhd and because of that I have a new hobby or interest each week . I like reading watching the most random shit on YouTube , baking , walking , making a million playlists that I’ll never listen to again and adding them to my iPod for optimal vibes  and journaling. I speak 3 languages and am learning a 4th ! I love dogs 100% but cats 101% .that’s about it nothing special .

- someone that you can annoy at any time of  the day 
- someone to have coffee dates with virtually

I came out a couple of years ago in my 30s as a bisexual man and since then have been supported by my (also bisexual) partner to find ways to express myself more authentically than I had before. Prior to this, I think I purposefully kept my inner self hidden for years and mostly dressed well but basic, complaining for most of my life about how much I find men’s clothes boring and wished they were as interesting as women’s. I recently started painting my nails and wearing some light make up (mostly eye liner/mascara) and my partner has been great at helping me pick out a new wardrobe from both men’s and women’s sections including some skirts, blouses, and even a dress - I’ve also started wearing some of her jumpers and jeans. I don’t wear the obviously feminine clothes out often but my partner has noticed I look so much more comfortable and confident since expressing myself more. Sexually, we both express a mix of masculine and feminine energy and I have never felt so close to someone before because of it. She is the first person I’ve truly felt like I can be vulnerable with when it comes to sex.

Up until recently, I never thought of myself as anything other than a man who was now happy to challenge my gender’s stereotypes. I was out for coffee a few months ago with a friend of mine who was ranting about men being trash and my partner said “what about XXXXX? There are some good men out there” to which she replied “yeah, but… I dunno, he’s different”. It’s stuck with me since, and at first I was annoyed because it felt like she was invalidating my gender by ignoring the fact that I was a man to make a point but recently I’ve wondered if there was something else to it and I’ve started to recall a number of things from my formative years. As a teenager I wore long hair, with eye liner and nail polish and became fascinated with music subcultures where men were often mistaken for women due to their outfits and makeup - I wanted to be them. I shaved my legs and even wore a skirt to school once. I always crossed my legs and hung out with the girls, and hated sports. I thought I was a trans girl for a while and at one point used the online name “Aida”, chosen because one translation for it from Japanese is “between”. Plenty of people thought I was gay because I wasn’t entirely masculine - I wondered it myself for a while but I was attracted to women so I shrugged off the idea of being anything other than straight (“everyone’s a little bi”, I thought). I was influenced by goth music and wrote any outward expression I had off as just being stylish for me at the time.

By the time I was 20, I cut my hair, started growing a beard and trying to live a more heteronormative life. Despite trying to find more men to be around, I always found it difficult to relate to them (I live in the UK where just not being a fan of football is enough for someone to question your manhood) and ended up continuing to make more friends who were either women or queer.

15 years later I am where I am now, finding ways to express myself again. I shaved my beard off for the first time in a decade and wondered to myself why I kept it for so long and a thought came to me that I’ve never shaken off: was it a way for me to show my masculinity to the world when I was trying to be normative because I struggled to feel masculine otherwise? That was the moment where I started to question my gender.

Despite the above, I don’t feel any real body dysmorphia. I am quite happy with my genitalia, and my body as a whole (though who doesn’t have minor things they want to change). I have always been incredibly slim though to the point where women have commented in the past that they are jealous of my legs etc. I know that I am not a woman, and I don’t mind being referred to as he/him or as a man, so it’s making me question whether I am possibly non-binary or just a non-conforming man. That being said, I’m wondering if being referred to as a man is just a comfort thing - after all, I was happy to be referred to as straight for a long time despite having lots of bicuriosity, it’s just what I’m used to.

Is there a difference, really? If the world got rid of gender roles and expectations entirely, would there even be binary genders to feel separated from?",2,1737639361.0,NonBinary,2,1.0,False

But with so many designs, materials, and placements to consider, how do you choose the right one for your space? This guide will walk you through the essential steps to find the perfect pendant light that complements your style and needs.

**Step 1: Understand the Purpose of Your Pendant Light**

The first step in selecting a pendant light is to identify its purpose. Are you looking for task lighting over a workspace, ambient lighting for a cozy vibe, or an accent piece to make a statement? For instance:

* **Task Lighting:** Perfect for kitchens and dining areas. Opt for focused [hanging lights in Dubai](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/lighting/pendant-lights), such as [black pendant light](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/lighting/pendant-lights), to illuminate countertops and dining tables.
* **Ambient Lighting:** Adds warmth and depth to living rooms or bedrooms. A pendant light with a diffused glow can be paired with other lighting elements like [floor lamps in Dubai](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/lighting/floor-lamps) for a layered effect.
* **Decorative Lighting:** Acts as a statement piece. Intricately designed pendant lights, such as those with geometric patterns or natural materials, can serve as focal points in your decor.

**Step 2: Choose the Right Style**

Pendant lights come in various styles, from minimalist and industrial to bohemian and traditional. Select a style that complements your existing decor while adding a unique touch.

* **Modern Spaces:** Sleek metal or glass pendant lights with clean lines are ideal.
* **Bohemian Chic:** Rattan pendant lights bring warmth and texture to any room, adding an earthy charm.
* **Classic Elegance:** Go for pendant lights with intricate detailing or vintage-inspired designs.

**Step 3: Consider the Material**

The material of the pendant light significantly impacts its appearance and durability. Some popular options include:

* **Rattan:** Adds an organic, natural feel to the space, perfect for boho or coastal interiors.
* **Metal:** Offers a modern and industrial aesthetic, great for kitchens and dining areas.
* **Glass:** Provides a timeless and elegant look while enhancing light diffusion.

**Step 4: Find the Perfect Placement**

Proper placement ensures that your pendant lights not only look great but also serve their function. Here are some tips for different areas:

* **Kitchen:** Hang pendant lights above the kitchen island or dining table at a height of 30-36 inches from the surface. This provides sufficient lighting for meal prep and dining while maintaining a balanced look.
* **Living Room:** Place a statement pendant light in the center of the room or above a coffee table to anchor the space.
* **Bedroom:** Use pendant lights as bedside lighting for a modern alternative to table lamps.

**Step 5: Choose the Right Size and Scale**

The size of your pendant light should align with the scale of your room and furniture. A small rattan pendant light works beautifully in compact spaces, while larger rooms may require multiple pendant lights or a grander fixture.

* **Small Spaces:** Opt for a single, understated pendant light to avoid overwhelming the room.
* **Large Spaces:** Use multiple hanging lights for the kitchen or cluster them for a dramatic effect.

**Step 6: Match with Other Lighting Elements**

To create a cohesive look, coordinate your pendant lights with other lighting fixtures in the room. For instance, pair your pendant lights with stylish floor lamps in Dubai to achieve a harmonious lighting scheme that balances function and aesthetics.

**Final Thoughts**

Choosing the right pendant light involves balancing style, function, and placement. Whether you’re leaning towards a rattan pendant light for a boho-chic vibe or sleek hanging lights for the kitchen, take the time to consider your space’s unique needs. With the perfect pendant light, you can transform any room into a well-lit and inviting space.

1i83a4e,https://www.reddit.com/r/MCAS/comments/1i83a4e/ate_a_yogurt_last_night_and_still_havent_slept/,Ate a Yogurt last night and still haven’t slept. Currently experiencing Insomnia and  anxiety,"My throat hasn’t tightened up and no shortness of breath but I’m having trouble remembering my thoughts and am sensitive to noise and light. 

Last night I went for milk and mozzarella, seemed okay, then I applied unscented deodorant, seemed okay again, but then I ate a yogurt cause I convinced my self that my MCAS was related to COVID and that it was temporary and for the first four hours I believed it. I was ecstatic, I was planning for my coffee the next day and looking forward to a future beer. But then I noticed I wasn’t getting sleepy. This is one of the most horrible feelings you can have.

I am undiagnosed MCAS/SFN but doctors seem to think it’s heading that way. 

I can’t afford an MCAS specialist. My skin biopsy is next week. And it really seems that I’m going to have to be on low histamine diet for the rest of my life. 

I also now have to figure out if it was four items that triggered me or just the yogurt, and the deodorant as well. 

I took a Zyrtec and two Pepcids. 

This is a horrible feeling. I really am hoping that this is some post viral stuff that will go away within the 18 month window, but life is so incredibly hard right now. I regret trying all those things at once and now I’m just trying to get through the day without things going out of control. 

This is surreal. This entire saga. Sometimes k can’t believe it. I do think I May have mold toxicity because I had to vacate the apartment that this all started in because I could no longer breathe there. ",1,1737638732.0,MCAS,9,1.0,False

Am I (24F) being gaslit?,"My current boyfriend and I have been together for around two years. Today, while he was next to me, I checked his Instagram (he saw it and was with me) and found a long list of women he used to flirt with. Most of this flirting happened before we got together, but some took place after we started dating. I don't mind him having a past, but I found it concerning that he kept this large old list on Instagram and has many of them saved in his contacts. He says these women are not important to his life, but it seems they are important enough for him to keep these old chats.

I told him that he is clearly keeping them for a reason. We’ve had similar discussions before, and while he unfollowed several women, it seems that the ones he kept are those he still has contact with, according to him. My boyfriend and I study the same subject, and a lot of these women are in the same courses as him. It makes me really uncomfortable knowing he has a past with many of them and that I was kept in the dark until now — they knew, but I had no idea.

I should also mention that in one of his chats, he went out for coffee with one of these girls during a time when we were having an argument. He purposely didn’t tell me about it. I feel that even if he’s not cheating on me, keeping these connections with these women feels like he has something to fall back on in case anything happens between us.

He insists that these women are not relevant to his life. There’s one girl who sent him ""funny"" Valentine’s Day content on Instagram last year while we were together. He liked it, which he says means he wasn’t giving her attention. I find that really inappropriate. Even if I were single, I would never send that kind of stuff to a guy in a relationship, especially on Valentine’s Day. His view is that he didn’t think it would be an issue.

Can he be trusted? Is this borderline cheating?

**Here’s what I kept asking myself:**  
- “Why do visitors bounce faster than a dropped Zoom call?”  
- “How do I turn ‘just browsing’ into ‘TAKE MY MONEY’?”  
- “Is hiring a sales team my only option? (Spoiler: $$$)”  

So I built **Kaufy**

[Kaufy](https://kaufy.tech) is an AI-powered sales agent that seamlessly integrates into websites(with just a simple code snippete ), engaging visitors in human-like voice and text conversations to boost sales and customer satisfaction.

**Here’s how it works:**  
Imagine your website is a bakery. People walk in, smell the croissants, but leave without buying. Now, picture a friendly baker (Kaufy) who:  

1. **ENGAGE**  
   *""Hi there! Looking for something sweet or need help deciding?""*  
   Kaufy greets visitors instantly, just like a friendly baker welcoming customers.  

2. **UNDERSTAND**  
   *""Are you gluten-free? Craving chocolate or fruit?""*  
   It asks questions to figure out their needs, like a baker learning your preferences.  

3. **PERSONALIZE**  
   *""Our gluten-free almond croissant just came out of the oven—want to try a slice?""*  
   Tailors recommendations like a baker suggesting fresh, relevant options.  

4. **CONVERT**  
   *""First-time visitors get 10% off! Grab it before the next batch sells out.""*  
   Nudges them to buy, like a baker offering a limited-time deal.  

5. **DELIGHT**  
   *""Here’s a free cookie for later—thanks for stopping by!""*  
   Surprises them post-purchase, like a baker tossing in a bonus treat.  

 
- Matches the **customer journey** (curiosity → trust → sale → loyalty).  

**Kaufy does this 24/7** – no coffee breaks, no payroll. It uses voice *and* chat to turn “meh” visitors into paying customers.

Its like having your most persuasive salesperson working tirelessly around
the clock, ensuring no opportunity is missed and every interaction is optimized for success.

So Do your visitors leave quickly? , Do you struggle to capture leads ?, Do you want high conversion rates , Do you need Customer Engagement?, Do you want to boost sales ? 

If any of the question answer yes u definitely need kaufy on your website

Whether you're looking to upgrade, downsize, or simply liquidate an asset, implementing proven techniques can help you maximize your real estate potential while ensuring a smooth and speedy transaction. Here are some top tips to help you sell your property quickly and efficiently.

# 1. Price It Right from the Start

The first and most important factor in selling property quickly is setting the right price. Overpricing can deter buyers, while underpricing can leave you with less value than your property deserves. Striking the right balance is key.

**Why It Works:**

* Attracts serious buyers who are willing to make quick decisions.
* Creates competitive interest, which can even lead to multiple offers.

**Tip:** Research comparable properties in your area to understand market trends and set a competitive, realistic price.

# 2. Enhance Curb Appeal

First impressions matter, and the exterior of your property is the first thing potential buyers see. A well-maintained, attractive property exterior can significantly increase buyer interest.

**How to Enhance Curb Appeal:**

* Clean the driveway, mow the lawn, and trim bushes.
* Add simple touches like fresh flowers, a clean front door, or new outdoor lighting.
* Repair any visible damages, such as cracks in the pavement or peeling paint.

**Tip:** Think like a buyer—drive by your property and assess what could be improved to make it more inviting.

# 3. Stage the Interior for Success

Staging your home allows potential buyers to envision themselves living in the space. A well-staged property highlights its best features and creates an emotional connection with buyers.

**Staging Tips:**

* Declutter and depersonalize the space by removing family photos and excessive decorations.
* Rearrange furniture to create an open, airy layout.
* Use neutral colors and simple décor to appeal to a broad audience.

**Tip:** Natural light can make a huge difference—open curtains and blinds during showings to brighten up the space.

# 4. Leverage High-Quality Photography and Marketing

Most buyers start their property search online, making professional photography and effective marketing essential. Great visuals can attract more interest and increase the chances of a quick sale.

**What to Do:**

* Hire a professional photographer to showcase your property in the best light.
* Write a compelling listing description that highlights key features and unique selling points.
* Use multiple platforms to advertise, including online property portals and social media.

**Tip:** Include photos of both the interior and exterior, along with shots of nearby amenities or scenic views.

# 5. Be Flexible with Showings

Availability is crucial when selling a property quickly. Being flexible and accommodating with showings allows more potential buyers to view the property, increasing the likelihood of a fast sale.

**Why It Matters:**

* Buyers often have tight schedules, so accommodating them can leave a positive impression.
* More showings mean more chances of receiving an offer quickly.

**Tip:** Consider holding open houses or offering virtual tours for buyers who may not be able to visit in person.

# 6. Highlight the Property’s Unique Features

Emphasize what makes your property stand out, whether it’s a spacious backyard, modern kitchen, or proximity to desirable locations. Buyers are more likely to act quickly when they see unique value.

**How to Highlight Features:**

* Include these details in your listing and during showings.
* Use storytelling to help buyers imagine living in the space (e.g., “Enjoy morning coffee on the sunlit patio”).

**Tip:** Showcase upgrades or renovations that have been made, such as new appliances or energy-efficient windows.

# 7. Work with Local Experts

If you’re looking to sell quickly, working with local real estate experts or advisors can streamline the process. They bring market knowledge, pricing expertise, and access to a network of buyers.

**Benefits:**

* Access to buyers already looking in your area.
* Professional negotiation skills to secure the best deal quickly.

**Tip:** Look for professionals with a strong track record in selling properties quickly.

# Conclusion

Selling property fast doesn’t have to be a stressful experience. By pricing your property correctly, enhancing its appeal, and leveraging effective marketing strategies, you can attract serious buyers and close the deal in no time.

Stick Analyzer is a specialized program for testing and analyzing gamepad stick resolution. Its main purpose is to determine the real resolution of sticks and compare it with programmatic motion interpolation.

*Disclosure: Hi, I'm Johnny Punch (u/JohnnyPunch), the developer of Stick Analyzer. This is a 100% free, open-source program with no ads, no paid features, and no commercial interests. I have no affiliations with any gamepad manufacturers or gaming companies. I created this program as a hobby project for the gaming community. If you'd like to support the development, you can* [*buy me a coffee*](https://ko-fi.com/gamepadla)*, but it's entirely optional and doesn't affect access to any features. All testing results and reviews are based on objective measurements.*

[Console program interface](https://preview.redd.it/2a4i85wepqee1.png?width=1503&format=png&auto=webp&s=79518ceb27b87e456cb66a1252df12f59b5314bd)

# What is Stick Resolution?

Stick resolution defines the number of unique positions a gamepad can register when moving the stick from center to edge. For example, the Machenike G1 Pro gamepad has a resolution of 0.0039, meaning it can register 256 different positions (calculation: 1/0.0039 ≈ 256.41 positions). This is similar to monitor resolution - more pixels mean clearer image. In gamepad sticks, higher resolution provides smoother and more precise control.

It's important to understand that not all gamepads have constant resolution. Some models may output values of 0.0078 (128 positions) or 0.0150 (66 positions), affecting the number of real stick positions. That's why tests on [Gamepadla.com](http://Gamepadla.com) use the Avg. Step Resolution parameter, which shows the average resolution value during stick movement.

# How to Use the Program?

[A guide to help you move the test stick correctly](https://preview.redd.it/o1uuv822rqee1.png?width=2022&format=png&auto=webp&s=029b637db4682dbee6e6328b5e2d44872c6066fe)

1. **Stick Selection**: The program allows testing left and right sticks separately.
2. **Calibration**:
   * A test window appears after launch
   * First, rotate the stick fully 3 times for calibration
   * This helps the program determine your gamepad's basic parameters
3. **Testing**:
   * A circular guide appears after calibration
   * Move the stick slowly in the direction indicated by the guide
   * Try to keep the pointer in the center of the guide circle
   * Small deviations from the guide are acceptable - smooth movement is key
   * Recommended to place the gamepad on a table and control the stick with both hands for maximum precision

# Results Analysis

After test completion, the program shows a graph with two lines and several important parameters:

* **Yellow line**: Programmatic stick movement
* **Blue line**: Physical stick movement
* Lines nearly matching indicates high stick quality and accurate movement transmission
* Line divergence indicates differences between physical movement and its programmatic interpretation, possibly showing interpolation or mechanical issues

[More data will be available in the program console](https://preview.redd.it/9v66pntprqee1.png?width=1734&format=png&auto=webp&s=eaba96d0aea24d739cb4945f07439c0fbcd7eee3)

# Key Parameters:

1. **Program Points**: Total positions registered by the program
   * Shows all movement points, including noise and tremor
2. **Analog Points**: Number of unique analog positions
   * Real stick positions after noise filtering
   * Difference between Program Points and Analog Points shows noise level
3. **Tremor**: Percentage of movement instability
   * High values may indicate mechanical problems or excessive sensitivity
   * Optimal value is below 15%
4. **Avg. Step Resolution**: Average step resolution
   * Shows average distance between unique stick positions
   * Lower value means higher precision

[An example of a bad gamepad that has a lot of tremor or motion interpolation](https://preview.redd.it/hry76wxfsqee1.png?width=1176&format=png&auto=webp&s=241d9875a9e10ff4cd6c40eda49fc3d525c25469)

# Practical Tips

* Perform the test calmly, without rushing
* Recommended to conduct 2-3 tests for most accurate results
* For significant tremor, check stick mechanics for damage or dirt

# Additional Information

125 unique stick positions are sufficient for comfortable gaming. Fewer positions can negatively impact control precision in games, especially genres requiring smooth movement - first-person shooters, racing simulators, and platformers. It can also lead to ""dead zones"" in control, where small stick movements aren't registered by the game.

# Download

You can test your gamepad right now! The program is portable, requires no installation or additional devices. Works with gamepads in any connection mode (USB, Bluetooth, wireless adapter).

I (29f) lost my dad in 2017 very suddenly. He did not have a will (MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A FREAKING WILL PEOPLE). My mom and her lawyer had signed the family home into my name without my knowledge, because my mom owes the government $300k in taxes for the business she and my dad had together. She was afraid the government was going to seize the house. My parents had taken out a mortgage back in 2012 by using the family home as collateral. My mom is now filing for bankruptcy, and the mortgage is part of it.

My mother is the kind of person who expects everyone to save her. As I’ve gotten older, I’ve come to realize the real person that she is. All she cares about now is smoking weed/cigarettes in the garage with her boyfriend (who is my cousin by the way.. My father’s sister’s son) and drinking coffee.

Here is where things get crazy complicated. My mom attempted to coerce me into taking out a $100,000 loan to pay off her mortgage and property tax arrears. She would then pay the loan off and figure out how much money I would owe HER. At first I was convinced to do it. After multiple arguments with my husband (33m), I called it off. My mom was PISSED. Accused me of fucking her over and ruining everything.

My adopted brother then offers to buy the family home. He wanted to make monthly payments and only give me $25k on a $500k plus home. I said no, and he retracted his offer after I told him I wanted at least $100k. The stress, agony and bullshit that my family has put me through these last 12 years was worth way more than $25k. My family started threatening me, calling me a thief and a coward, calling my husband a greedy bastard and told me I should relocate my family and that I deserve nothing. I’ve been harassed at work, and have almost had to call the police.

After consulting multiple lawyers, my mother has no legal ground to stand on. I am the legal owner of the property. We don’t have any sort of lease/rental agreement, so I can evict her whenever I want, and can put the house on the market whenever I want. Once it sells, all I have to do is make sure that the mortgage and property taxes are paid off, which I had intentions of paying anyways. I have gone no contact with my entire family. I have blocked them on all social media platforms, and I don’t respond to any phone calls or text messages from them.

My husband and I are in the process of getting our own house insurance on the property. We are then writing the eviction notice, and kicking them out. If they don’t go peacefully, we are making a court date to get the police involved to get them out. Then we will put the house on the market and we will keep every cent from the sale. We will pay off our debts, buy our own home, and put the rest into investments for our children’s future. Whatever happens to my mother, is her own problem now.

1i82vl5,https://www.reddit.com/r/dubai/comments/1i82vl5/are_there_affordable_accountants_in_this_country/,Are there affordable accountants in this country?,"Hi there! I wanna set up a business with a digital service for sale (think online products) and where each product will cost 3€ (so around 11.50 AED) per month. Hopefully in the first month I can get 1,000 customers and in the first year 5,000, meaning that in the first few months I will make around 11,500 AED per month.   
  
The problem is that when looking for accountants here in Dubai, they all say that they charge per transaction. The cheapest I found charges 34,000 AED per year (= 2,800 Aed per month) up if the business does 1,000 transactions month.   
  
To me, paying almost 3000 aed for an accountant when I am only making 11,000 per month seems like a lot. I appreciate accountants might be more expensive here but I also feel that then there would be no business where they make a lot of sales of a cheaper item such as bakeries or coffee shops.

openai is having a big outage right now, which made me free from my job. since i have some free time in my had, i thought of summarizing a recent report that i read which analyzed 2 trillion+ production llm tokens.

here's the key findings and summary (i will keep my scope limited to openai, you can find more thing on the report here -> portkey\[dot\]sh/report-llms)

here we go-

1. the most obvious insight that came to my mind as i was reading this report was openai's market share, we all know it is at a monopoly, but looking at this chart they are at 53.8% market share.

1. azure openai on the other hand actually faced a huge downfall compared to openai-> from 50% to a staggering 25% in production. i had no idea this could be the case

1. talking about performance (since we are all facing outage rn lol), here's what i found:

* openai gpt4 latency is \~3s while azure is at \~5s
* but the fun part is error rates:
   * azure fails at 1.4% (rate limits)
   * openai only fails 0.18%
   * that's like 12k more failures per million requests wtf

1. okay this is interesting - apparently gpt4-mini is the real mvp?? it's handling 78% of all openai production traffic. makes sense cause its cheaper and faster but damn, that's a lot
2. last thing i found interesting (might help during outages like this) - looks like some teams are using both openai and azure with fallbacks. they're getting:

* 30% better latency
* 40% fewer outages
* no vendor lock in

might pitch this to my team once services are back up lol

that's pretty much what i found interesting. back to my coffee break i guess. anyone else stuck because of the outage? what's your backup plan looking like?",1,1737637193.0,OpenAIDev,1,1.0,False

I’m trying to upload my previous stories here in hopes of helping the sub, but I’m gone for a week. Sorry for the hassle and sorry for the influx of posts!

—-

I grew up in a pretty typical family in suburbia: middle class family, a goofy dog, and an older sister with such grace and natural beauty - though I never would have had the maturity to admit that back then, my sister is a wonderful woman - with a penchant for tormenting her younger, awkward brother. Picturesque and nondescript. 

Being an edgy teenager, I pretended to loathe it. It was cool to look so spiteful, I guess, and clearly absolutely nobody could possibly understood me. High school came and went, junior college flew by too, and currently, I am enduring med school. Some things never changed though, at least in a fashion sense. I still wear band shirts from time to time, but I no longer paint the dark circles under my eyes with cheap eye liner, the stress and lack of sleep from school does that on its own. 

Though I had long since moved away, I was blessed to still be close to home, which allowed for occasional comfort and delicious meals. But those perks became fewer and farther between as I grew busier with school and life in general.

Empty nest syndrome hit the folks hard. Mom decided to return to work full time at the law firm to satiate idle hands, she landed two promotions in a few years. And dad retired to chase dreams and new hobbies. His pride and joy, a podcast of sorts geared at amateur radios and music, grew to some notoriety. Credit to dad: despite all his nerdiness, he pulled it off and it was reasonably entertaining. The two stayed busy but rarely took the time to indulge in true relaxation with each other. But the day finally came when they decided that such was long overdue.

Dad proudly waved the tickets for a 9 day cruise and resort in some tropical place before pleading with me to look after the house, the cat, and my dad’s baby: the show. They’d be gone a total of 12 days. There was some long lecture about how it needed diligent care to upkeep, and “please make sure the scheduled things uploaded.” He joked with some sincerity that I could play a few songs from my high school band’s days of glory, but realistically I knew he had long prepared his audience for his temporary hiatus.

My parents’ flight left in the afternoon, and I arrived in the morning just in time to watch Mom panic-pack and unpack at least three times to ensure nothing was forgotten. Dad shoved the keys to the house in my hands with one last reminder about “diligence,” and I politely nodded and wished them well and not to get too badly sunburned. As they waved their goodbyes, the clock struck 1:00 PM.

It dawned on me that I hadn’t been home in almost seven months, despite living only 20 minutes away. Now, the house almost seemed foreboding. The noisy and charming memories of childhood seemed stifled in the quiet cookie-cutter exterior of this freshly empty house. The dark wooden floors offered a hollow chord to my footsteps, and I damn near pissed myself when Spanky, a crotchety feline, jumped off the stairwell and darted down the basement stairs situated in the hallway. I cursed him under my breath as I recalled the cat was strictly forbidden from the basement because he had recently started pissing on things down there. 

During my previous visits, I had never bothered to see how my father remodeled the basement into his studio and household storage unit. It had always creeped me out as a child, and I guess that fear lingered, even in adulthood, because I just never went in there. I’d have to confront that fear for the next 12 days.

“Spankyyy” I peered my head into the dim stairwell and called to the cat, “come here Spanks. Good kitty, come here, you filthy fleabag.”

Entering the basement, dad had painted the floor with gray acrylic, and though it was painfully chilled for bare feet, it was easy to clean and kept everything tidy. Opposite the stairs, dad installed a small office to cut noise where his computers resided and the podcast played. It sat in a corner as a small, insulated box with one thick window to allow sight into the world beyond the cube. The rest of the basement was full of neatly arranged metal shelving full of unused household objects, seasonal decor, and Grandma’s belongings. Grandma had recently passed and my parents stored her stuff in the basement for later sorting that would likely never happen. 

She had an old tube television that she would hover over in her latter days, fixated to the point where she’d fail to acknowledge any living creature around her. No matter how it was adjusted, the TV never worked. Only salt and pepper danced across the screen. We realized her lucidity was in dire states when she became so obsessed with the television that she nearly starved her cat and herself (I should mention that the cat outlived her and is the same asshole prowling the basement at this moment). For whatever reason, the TV found a place on my father’s new shelves instead of the local dump. I reached to turn the knobs on the television but redirected my attention at the sound of something upstairs.

“Mike?” A voice called from above.

I had grown so absorbed in the cat that I had forgotten I invited Lyle over to study for an upcoming exam. I called him downstairs and we exchanged greetings. He was proud to display a thermos of warm whiskey-laced coffee and a six pack of beer, for studying, of course.

Lyle helped me extricate the cat - rather, it extricated itself as it bolted up the stairs with a ferocious hiss and we shut the door behind the beast. We opted to study in the office, enjoying the seclusion and lack of external distraction.

I’d had enough of the Krebs cycle and sighed deeply. Our brains had reached beyond the capacity to handle much more and we agreed it was time to call it a night. The clock flashed 9 PM and confirmed that thought. Lyle stood and stretched, exploring the shelving. His eyes locked on Grandma’s TV and he reached to touch the screen.

“Careful, Lyle, that thing might suck you in,” I joked. 

Lyle passed a confused look my way.

“Ah, it’s nothing. As a kid, my sister and I used to joke that that thing was possessed, and Grandma used to mutter that she saw otherworldly things through it.” I made spooky hands and sounds.

“Ha,” he muttered half heartily. “Listen, Mike... I better go.”

I glanced at him quizzically, “alright. Drive safe.” I presumed his sudden aversion was the consequence of a tired brain. As Lyle’s presence fully vanished, I opted to check on the show and throw up my own tidbit on a brief live episode. Dad had pumped up his followers that I would.

“Hello crew,” I spoke into the microphone, attempting to act like I had done this before. “This is... Mad Mike.” I paused, and the roll of my eyes was nearly audible as I reread the instructions to address myself as Mad Mike. “While James is off adventuring, he’s left me in charge of the place.” My voice cracked as I skimmed over the things Dad listed that I could talk about.

“Here’s a little spook for you to mull around your skulls in this evening hour. I grew up in this house, but we recently acquired my Grandma’s things in her passing, including the infamous haunted television from my childhood. What makes it haunted, I’m sure you ask? If you turn it on and look at it directly, the best you’ll get is a salt and pepper screen. However, if you see it in your peripheral, it shows flashes of harrowing images. Look back, and you’ll never fully see the images because they’ll be gone as strangely as they appeared in the corner of your eye. Or, at least that’s what we said as kids. So I gotta live with that thing for the next twelve days, and I’m going to try to discern those “ghost” images during my stay. Peace out, this is... Mad Mike.”


Walking up to the shelves, I saw the cold screen of the TV and contemplated what I was about to do. Carefully lifting it from its slumber, I brought it into the office and plugged it in. I held my fingers still on the knob, weighing the growing fear in my stomach one last time before I inevitably released some calamity of monsters free to this world.

*Click.*
	
I laughed with relief as not even the familiar salt and pepper danced across the screen. It was broken.


DAY ONE

In conjunction with the show, Dad and his friends had created a forum for his audience to talk. I think that was part of the success of the show, how interactive it was and how deeply it connected people from all over. I perused the forum subjects with particular interest on Current, and laughed to see “Mad Mike” mentioned several times. “Don’t get eaten by the sitcom demons” brought me a smile.

I typed out the comment, “Good morning folks, this is Mad Mike. I regret to inform you, though I’m secretly relieved, that the TV is broken. There will be no sitcom demons during my time here.” And with that, I pressed send, gathered my things, and set off for work and class.


I returned late in the evening. It was nice to be in such a homey place instead of my poor man’s overpriced studio. Spanky perched halfway up the stairs at her usual overlook, her tail twitching mildly in displeasure at my intrusion. I was surprised to learn that I was excited to check the show. I knew I had little part in it, but it brought my dad so much joy and I was happy to share that. 

My excitement was cut short, however. The sturdy basement door was ajar and I was certain, without doubt, I had shut it. I looked skeptically at Spanky, and as much as I would have liked to blame her, I knew that spastic cat was not capable of such a feat.

Nothing was amiss downstairs. I made my updates and checked the scheduled upload. I looked at the TV, quietly perched where I had left it in the office, still plugged in. Quickly, I turned it on but nothing had changed: it was still broken. I rolled my eyes, slightly disappointed with myself that I had honestly thought it could be any different. 

On. Off. On. Off. The repetition of the act enforced my empowered state of mind. And no matter how badly a sliver of me wanted something to happen just one time, the only thing that appeared was my reflection staring disapprovingly with the office doorway behind me. 

On. Off- a silhouette of a shadowed, gangly figure loomed in the doorway behind my own reflection. I shot like a rocket forward and around. But no one stood in the open doorway.

Off. And unplugged.


DAY TWO:

With the approach of morning, I gladly awoke from a troubled sleep. There was no way to explain what I had seen on the TV, but I chocked it up to nervous anticipation playing tricks on the mind.

To my delight, class had been canceled and I wasn’t scheduled for work today. Realistically, that meant a day to dedicate to studying. Given the event that took place the night before, I opted to study in the open air of the living room rather than the basement, but that proved challenging, as Spanky is legitimately a psychotic bitch. The cat made every effort to harass and break my morale, even bringing a live mouse as the final straw which she proudly dropped on my book, causing the creature to scurry across my workspace and me to throw my papers. I cursed the beast, gathered my things, and slammed the basement door behind me.

Entering the basement was a sober change of pace. Though I still lingered in my frustration, an unsettling sense of dread filled me as I surveyed the space. The TV sat dumbly where it had been left all night, so I reluctantly began my studies.
	
Transfixed on my studies, the TV suddenly turned on with a horrible buzz, black and white specks dancing over the screen. My heart slammed in my chest. I turned the knob to shut off the television, and stared in disbelief. Quickly, I checked the door beside me, relaxing only slightly when I found no intruder.

Still shaking and stupefied, I needed some form of human encouragement. 

“Hey guys,” I announced. “It’s Mike - Mad Mike.” I had quickly lost my suave. Dad would be disappointed, I needed to pull it together. “We uh, we’ve got a scheduled show just around the corner… But before that I thought it’d be fun to feed your imagination. Remember that old TV I told you about? Well, the dam - goshdarned thing just turned on by itself. Spooky stuff, folks,” I teased. “Spooky stuff,” the humor in my voice faded. “But like I said, we got a fine lineup- FUCK!”

The TV turned back on. I cringed realizing the the colossal fuck I had just dropped on Dad’s baby.

“Well ha!” I laughed nervously. “It uh... it’s back on! HA! Isn’t that the darnedest thing.” 

The fear was thick on my voice. “Uh... enjoy the show,” I exited the stream. 

To compliment the black and white blizzard across the screen, the horrible sound of static blared through its tiny speakers. Worse still, despite frantic efforts to shut it off, the television wouldn’t stop, even when unplugged.

I tried to ignore it, but my best efforts were futile. The static picked at every nerve, making study impossible and clouding my reason. When I left, I swear I could hear it other parts of the house. Hoping for some solution, I checked the forum:

“It must have a battery.”

“BRUUUH”

“Get that thing out of the house!” 

“Pussy!!!”

They offered no real resolution, but the TV was powered off now, and I guess it does make sense that there must be a battery somewhere in the device. At least I’ll tell myself that.


DAY THREE:

During the night, sleep came uneasily and stayed even less easily. Noises plagued the house and sounded eerily like footsteps, I woke cranky, exhausted, and with little time to waste before class. I rushed down the stairs towards the front door when I noticed that the basement door was, once again, wide open. 

Spanky must have known I didn’t have time to spare this morning and made a brilliant dash into the basement despite my efforts to grab her. With time ticking away, I ran down the basement stairs, cursing and praying for a quick removal. Spanky hid under the nearest shelf.

“Dammit, Spanky, I don’t have time for this. Get out of here.” I sneered. I heard her meow in mournful response.

“Come here. Come here, kitty.”

“Mrrrrrrow,” she wailed. 

“Spanky, please!”

She hissed savagely and scampered into the office.

“Spanky, if you get eaten, I will feel zero remorse. ... Spanky?”

“Mrow.” Followed by a deep, feline growl. I entered the room to find Spanky in the corner furthest from the television. Her tail flailed wildly and every hair on her body stood on end as she yowled at the TV.

I cooed at her in a desperate attempt to calm her. The TV was off. There was no haunting image, just a slightly skewed view of the room with me crouching towards an angry, senile cat. As I diverted my attention, the reflection on the TV moved in the corner of my eye, but looking back at it, it was the same image as before. I looked at the TV. What the hell was going on. 

Spanky took the chance to run out of the room and back upstairs. I was relieved that she chose to make this ordeal somewhat easier, and, my eyes still locked on the TV, I quickly grabbed it to place it back on the shelves.

“Hi, twerp,” it was the familiar voice of my sister, but still scared me half to death. “That was a better scare than I was expecting!”

“Funny,” I glared at her.

“Hey, ma and pa said you’d be here, and I just wuv you so much,”

“I don’t have time for this,” I said with half feigned frustration and full sincerity. “But… do you remember the stories we used to tell about this thing?” I gestured with my face at the TV.

“Oh gosh, those old ghost stories? I don’t know. Something about teeth on the screen and voices? You know grandma was a few screws loose in those days.” At that moment she noticed the look of concern on my face. “Hey, you alright?”

“Yeah. Yeah, It’s nothing. I have a stressful exam soon and now I’m going to be late for class today.”

Sister smiled sternly and hugged me ferociously before practically shoving me up the stairs, promising to lock up the house and deal with the cat. I thanked her and ran out the door.


DAY SIX:

The last two days went smoothly, and I was content to believe that the few weird episodes I had experienced were nothing to worry about. I was just stressed. All my woes must have been caused by an anxious mind. Not ghosts. Not a demonic TV. Just stress and exasperated by a vindictive cat. I vigorously scratched Spanky’s neck as she expressed a rare moment of affection. I’d certainly blame her for all of this, after her antics. 

Since seeing my sister, I hadn’t bothered to check dad’s podcast. Dad did set it up to run on it’s own, after all. But I thought perhaps I wasn’t being as diligent as I could be. So I made a point to hold my promise and check all his accounts when I got home later that evening.

Opening the forums revealed a medley of notifications and a handful of private messages. Most speculated that I was now dead, but one caught my attention and sent shivers down my spine:

“Have you seen it?”

I scowled at the message, contemplating my next move. Three familiar buttons danced suddenly danced across the screen as the sender prepared a new message:

“When you do, it’s too late. Get rid of it.”

Not if, but *when.* I didn’t bother to reply.

The message left such a sour taste in my mouth that I decided I’d rather play a movie upstairs and read my notes. Approaching the stairs, something caught my eye. I groaned as I scanned the room and realized it came from the direction of the television.

Its obsolete hulk sat quietly on the shelf. I thought perhaps the movement could be answered by Spanky because it was roughly the same color, but searching the area around the TV revealed no angry cat. I turned my eyes to the left side of the isle when I saw it again by the television. Woefully, as my eyes darted back to the TV, there was nothing to be seen, just a still, black screen. My pulse erupted. It was real. It wasn’t the nerves of college life. 

When we were kids, we never spent much time with grandma alone, and as she grew more insane she never left that television. We’d have dinner “with” her, but she’d just snap at us and take one or two bites of food off her TV tray table and stare and that damned box. She grew violent, flipping the tray and demanding answers from the television. 

The final straw, however, came after she chased me down and held my face against the glass screen while she screeched at me to tell her what I could see. I cried. I pissed myself. Dad pried her off of me, and Mom finally agreed with her sisters that it was time Grandma needed professional care. That was the end of our stories about the TV she coveted so greatly. 

We never saw anything, maybe that was because our minds just couldn’t quite grasp it or maybe it was because the TV was fully preoccupied with her. Nonetheless, I was now seeing what we had whispered as children. My eyes grew wide and my pupils dilated with adrenaline. 
	
“I could look away,” I thought. “I just have to keep my eyes locked on the other side of the isle, and then I’ll have an answer to this thing. It’ll be nothing. I won’t see anything. And I can kick myself, sure.”

It took every ounce of will to move my eyes to the other side, but in immediate response the TV flashed in the corner of my eye. My gut reaction made me look back at the screen, trying to see clearly what writhed in my peripheral. It offered only a mute reflection.

“Don’t look back dammit, fuck, why am I even doing this???” I asked myself out loud.

“Don’t. Look. Back. Keep focus.” I whispered to myself before my eyes darted to the other side. I was so focused that I couldn’t see the box of Christmas lights in front of my eyes as the images in my peripheral flashed like a morbid strobe. 

I couldn’t discern the images in any clarity. Light flickered unsteadily like a candle and something fleshy rotated perpetually. But the most disturbing was what appeared to be a set of horrid teeth: a horribly deformed maw with slobbery, bucked teeth. It gagged and its tongue wiggled out of its toothy gate like a bloated seal on a rocky shore. The entire image played in an uncomfortable orange hue, and those teeth... I could almost hear the thick-saliva-coated lips smacking together. My gaze slowly drifted back- the television burst on with a ferocious hiss of salt and pepper.

“You’re not even plugged in!?!?” I shoved it off the shelf and it fell dumbly to the floor, birthing a single, deep crack from top to bottom. The chaos on the screen stopped. I fled upstairs and slammed the basement door.

I grabbed liquor from the cabinet, and poured a generous glass, gulping it greedily.

“This can’t- there has be some kind of logical explanation.”

I rummaged through my coat’s pockets for the pack of cigs I was holding for a friend. I could count the number of times I had smoked, and very few of those times actually warranted the necessity, but this time it did. I grabbed the cig and ran outside, deeply and selfishly inhaling the warm, acrid smoke. I focused on breath and the sting in my lungs. 

The last time I enacted this ritual was during a meltdown early in my college life. I laughed at how trivial that event was in comparison to this... supernatural bullshit. Hell, this thing probably caused my grandma’s demise! It indirectly - maybe even directly - killed a person, drove her mad! Wait… was I mad? Was this a mental breakdown? Schizophrenia? No, no. Stop.

I threw the butt on the ground and drove my shoe into it. I exhaled, deeply, shoulders slouching and lungs wheezing, before opening the door.

The basement door was wide open and the television rested in front of it, pointed towards the front door. I shut the front door and opened it again, hoping the scene in the house would be different. But it wasn’t. I walked carefully towards it, refusing to take my eyes off of it lest the images return in sinister precision. I plucked the TV off the floor, holding it far from my person as if it were some filthy object, ran outside, and threw it in the trash for the garbage man.

Another shot of the went down with a sting in my throat. 


DAY SEVEN:

I sat against my bed on the floor all night. I kept the lights on, and every time I dared to doze I’d wake startled and terrified.

Throughout the night the noises in the house increased, except this time they were certainly the sounds of bare feet pacing the house. They prowled in an unsure gait. I heard a few things fall. Many times, Spanky even acknowledged the noises, and hissed one time when I thought the footsteps approached my bedroom door.

Her hiss reverberated into a deep growl and her hackles prickled erect when the footsteps returned to the door a second time. The final plap separated by the thin panels of the hollow core door. Quietly, I crept to the door to brace it, and, o my displeasure, I realized I could hear an indiscernible whisper on the other side as I grew closer. 

The speaker was so hushed it was impossible to make out what they were saying, but there was a cadence to the sound and a venom in its pitch. I placed my ear silently against the door to better hear it: the whispering stopped abruptly, replaced a moment later by the wet separation of gums and mouth. Chewing. Slapping. I could almost feel its hot breaths behind its messy jaw movements. Suddenly, the piercing sound of static caused me to reel awake.

The light of dawn was just starting to fill the sky. I was still on the floor, and Spanky blinked slowly towards me with her paws tucked under her chest when I flinched awake.

“Spanks, you had my back all night.” I warily smiled at her. “I won’t blame you after this week, I promise.”

I groggily lifted myself from the floor. Looking at the clock, I was already late for class. 

“All or nothing,” I sighed, embracing the opportunity to ditch and evaluate my potentially failing mental health. I only cared about coffee, maybe some Bailey’s in that coffee too.

Placing my hand on the doorknob, I paused. I had to leave the room at some point, and I begrudgingly pulled the door towards me, revealing the cracked, wretched TV patiently waiting for me on the other side.

“I guess it’s better to be late than not show up at all,” I thought.

I did everything I could to avoid home. Even though I attended class, I couldn’t take notes let alone actually learn anything. Throughout the entire lecture I kept seeing... things. But as soon as I looked over where it was, it’d be gone. At one point during class I watched a classmate silently ignite and burn alive. I refused to acknowledge it, sweating and trembling in my seat, but suddenly I could smell the burning flesh. I ran out of class to puke in the nearest trash can.

I went out for dinner with friends, but when they started to notice I was acting aloof, I left; there was no sense explaining what was going on as it’d be over in just a few days. I went to the bar and drank alone until closing. It was a dive bar, and while dive bars attract interesting people, everyone looked horrifically disfigured in my peripheral. In every corner lurked a tall shadow of a lanky, gray man until, once again, I looked that way only to see a well lit, empty space. 

The man next to me at the bar top clacked his disfigured jaws together, teeth protruding in all directions, and I looked at him in disgust only to see that his face was perfectly normal. I nervously gestured to my drink in an attempt to cover for myself, but he held his glare at me and told me to “get fucked.” I chugged the remaining half of my beer and left for home.

I parked my car in the driveway but I refused to go inside. I sat in my car for another hour before finally working up the courage to go inside and bee-line for my room, drunkenly stumbling up the stairs.

Exhaustion won.


DAY NINE:

3 AM. Every electronic device in the house turned suddenly on, screeching, buzzing, beeping all at once. I woke with a start, immediately on my feet. I tripped over the television, now resting foot of my bed. The black and white blizzard whirled over the screen, and I lifted it over and my head and chucked it down the stairs. 

Even after flying through the air, it still displayed the static screen and horrible buzz. I spent the next 37 minutes turning off everything in the house. Unlike the demon television, the other devices shut off. But the TV, freshly shattered, continued to play.

I ran downstairs towards the office but… stopped at the shelves. One shelf was newly emptied, and a chunk of meat rested on the shelves, slowly crawling in tight circles and groping like a wayward leech.

I bolted past the disembodied flesh into the office, logging in and searching for the ominous message I had ignored earlier.

“What do I do if I see it?” I typed frantically.

An hour passed without response. “I told you to get rid of it when you had the chance.”

“Gee, thanks. That’s so helpful.”

“...”

“No, no. Look, there’s so much going on right now. Forgive me, I don’t mean to be an
ass. But I need a serious answer on what to do.

“Well, have you seen it?’

“What’s it?”

“The man. Have you seen the gray man?”

“In the corner of my eye.”

“Then there’s a chance. Burn it.” 

A loud crash from the bathroom upstairs absorbed my attention. It was too loud to ignore and I didn’t want to be caught off guard and cornered in the basement. I approached the bathroom. I knocked on the door, hoping by some stupid chance a friend would reply.

I was no surgeon yet, but I opened the door with similar precision. Each click of its interior gears caused my heart to stall, each second dragging a perceived eternity. Before it was fully open, I groped for the light switch, illuminating the sacrilegious tomb in incandescent gloom. The light gave me the confidence to open the door fully, and I squinted in the yellow glow as if it were as bright as the Sun. 

I looked at my face. Something was wrong. I opened my mouth wide and all my teeth were yellowed, decayed and protruding. As I stared at my reflection, mouth agape, I could not control the rapid repetition of my jaw clacking open and shut, open and shut, open and shut, sending sticky tendrils of spit across the mirror. I slammed the light switch off and fell out of the bathroom.

I grabbed the TV. It had not moved from where I threw it earlier. From the kitchen, I grabbed the strongest proof bottle from the liquor cabinet and a cast iron pan... the best hammer I could improvise in a rush. I threw the television in the driveway and pulverized it with the pan. Plastic shrapnel scattered. I poured the potent liquor over the mess and threw a match on it. Slowly, the flames gained traction. I was relieved to watch it burn. Thick plumes of black smoke began to trail from its remains, and I caught a neighbor gawking. Glaring at the nosy neighbor, they immediately averted their gaze, shutting their blinds. I didn’t care.

I abruptly recalled that dad hid a handgun in a minimalist case velcroed under the couch. I wanted the assurance of brass and gunpowder, even if it was futile or unnecessary at this point. No time to waste, I flipped the couch and retrieved the 9 mm. Spanky perched nearby, uncomfortable at the disturbance. I grabbed her and pled for her cooperation. 

I ran downstairs with Spanky and the gun. I ensured that the basement door was shut and quickly passed through the storage area. There was no phantom slug meat, no possessed TV. Was it over?

I dragged Spanky into the office and shut the door behind me. I took the extra chair in the office and propped it against the door’s handle. I held my head in my hands for a long while before resuming. To my disbelief, the day had been spent, and the clock in the corner of the monitor displayed 11:47 PM.

“I destroyed it. I smashed it and I burned it.” I sent the stranger.

“Good.” He replied. “Anything since then?” 

“No.”

11:59 PM: I fell asleep with my face in my hands, elbow dragging out the letter N into the reply box.


DAY TEN:

I woke at 4:59 with a nauseous feeling in my gut. Resisting the urge to spew whatever meager stomach contents I had in my father’s office, I ran upstairs into the hallway bathroom, emptying the contents into the toilet. The foul taste of bile filled my mouth, and I drooled into the toilet, watching the strands of green-tinted spit slowly fall into the bowl.

I stood up and shifted to the right. I pitied my reflection. My eyes were sunken. My skin was pale. I was clearly exhausted. I opened the mirror’s medicine cabinet and rifled through the list of medication. I was searching desperately for ibuprofen and some sort of sleep aid, maybe a prescription muscle relaxant to boot. I was fortunate to find all three.

I slammed the mirror shut. The reflection revealed the doorway behind me with a gangly figure in the middle stepping forward. I threw the pills. Their delicate pings echoed in my ear as they collided and rolled down the porcelain, bouncing everywhere like a hypochondriac’s confetti. Whirling around, there was no one in the doorway, but I dared not risk it. I fled down the basement stairs, tripping near the middle.

While the fall was far from graceful, it could have been worse. I lay sprawled on the floor in a stupor. Groaning in agony, I sat upright slowly. I crawled into the office, slamming the door behind me and propping the chair against the door. Spanky hissed cruelly. The damn TV was on the table.


I video called the stranger over and over until he answered, “it didn’t work! It didn’t work!”

“What’s happening?”

“It’s here. I saw it. In the reflection. The TV is in here too. I don’t get it. I burned it! I
BURNED IT!!!”

“A reflection? It’s still a reflection. You haven’t seen it in pers-“

Spanky yowled. I looked in her direction. Her hair stood on end and her teeth were bared in ferocious display. My heart raced, but I followed her eyes’ path to the window.

Something loomed on the other side: a horrible figure leaned against the window. It propped its anorexic, pale body on the glass as, perhaps hoping it would break with little effort. Mouth agape, each breath left fog on the glass before it. The half-decayed jaw muscles propelled its mouth to close like a trap over and over again. Suddenly, it’s ghostly eyes rolled towards me, and through its white pupils I could tell that it was looking at me, watching me. It screeched. It pounded its fists on the glass and the static blared. 
	

Hours passed, the TV still twitching in static and illuminating enough of the room to let me know that there was movement on the other side of the glass. But that damn static sound. I wanted to cry… I did. I wept until my collar and sleeves were soggy. But that demon gave no remorse. It lingered in the dim light on the other side of the glass, approaching occasionally to watch me like a zoo display.

I stood up and stared down my foe. It stood at least a foot taller than me and predicted my every movement, mimicking me with startling accuracy. I held the gun to my head and it held its hand, fingers rolled in a mock revolver to its head and what remnants of its lips curled in a smirk. I mocked the sound of a gunshot and pulled the gun back in “ricochet.” It copied.

I held the gun to the window, challenging it. It glowered back now, furious at my defiance.

“I’ll shoot you,” I stammered, “square between the eyes!” 

Only that clear barrier of glass separated the monster’s forehead and the muzzle of my gun. It smashed its fists against the glass, shrieking once again as the window shook.

I let loose the single round, and another.

The glass did not crack and my ears rang. Violently, the window imploded, showering me in glass. Where the window formerly perched, a static TV screen had replaced it.

I could not... handle the sound... any longer.

“What do you see???” I replayed the memory of my grandmother screaming at me, spit flying from her mouth as she hissed through clenched teeth.


DAY ELEVEN:

“Yo, twerp!” Sister had used a spare key to open the front door. “I know you’re here somewhere... I see your car!” She cocked her head at the sight of pills strewn upon the floor by the half bath.

“Hey, dad called. He said there was something wrong with the podcast?” He said he was worried you had mucked it up? Where are you??? Dude, he said some weirdo was harassing him about you... twerp?” She was startled by Spanky who bolted from the jarred basement door, sliding on the floor in a panic.

Spanky ran past her feet under the kitchen table, leaving a trail of sticky, dark foot prints on the wooden floor. She ran her fingers across them to reveal a crimson stain across her fingers. The cat perched under the table, licking its paws. Hesitating but a moment, she grabbed the basement door and ran downstairs. It was dark, aside from the flickering light of a television. She flicked the light on.
	
“Michael?!? No...”

The open window offered no screen to the grisly mess of her brother. His head lulled backwards, throat slit and exposed by a brutal shard of glass still clutched in his hand. Sobbing, she pried at the barricaded door. As her efforts failed, she trembled as she dialed 911, pausing only but a moment when movement caught the corner of her eye.",2,1737637132.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

I’m trying to upload my previous stories here in hopes of helping the sub, but I’m gone for a week. Sorry for the hassle and sorry for the influx of posts!

—-

I grew up in a pretty typical family in suburbia: middle class family, a goofy dog, and an older sister with such grace and natural beauty - though I never would have had the maturity to admit that back then, my sister is a wonderful woman - with a penchant for tormenting her younger, awkward brother. Picturesque and nondescript. 

Being an edgy teenager, I pretended to loathe it. It was cool to look so spiteful, I guess, and clearly absolutely nobody could possibly understood me. High school came and went, junior college flew by too, and currently, I am enduring med school. Some things never changed though, at least in a fashion sense. I still wear band shirts from time to time, but I no longer paint the dark circles under my eyes with cheap eye liner, the stress and lack of sleep from school does that on its own. 

Though I had long since moved away, I was blessed to still be close to home, which allowed for occasional comfort and delicious meals. But those perks became fewer and farther between as I grew busier with school and life in general.

Empty nest syndrome hit the folks hard. Mom decided to return to work full time at the law firm to satiate idle hands, she landed two promotions in a few years. And dad retired to chase dreams and new hobbies. His pride and joy, a podcast of sorts geared at amateur radios and music, grew to some notoriety. Credit to dad: despite all his nerdiness, he pulled it off and it was reasonably entertaining. The two stayed busy but rarely took the time to indulge in true relaxation with each other. But the day finally came when they decided that such was long overdue.

Dad proudly waved the tickets for a 9 day cruise and resort in some tropical place before pleading with me to look after the house, the cat, and my dad’s baby: the show. They’d be gone a total of 12 days. There was some long lecture about how it needed diligent care to upkeep, and “please make sure the scheduled things uploaded.” He joked with some sincerity that I could play a few songs from my high school band’s days of glory, but realistically I knew he had long prepared his audience for his temporary hiatus.

My parents’ flight left in the afternoon, and I arrived in the morning just in time to watch Mom panic-pack and unpack at least three times to ensure nothing was forgotten. Dad shoved the keys to the house in my hands with one last reminder about “diligence,” and I politely nodded and wished them well and not to get too badly sunburned. As they waved their goodbyes, the clock struck 1:00 PM.

It dawned on me that I hadn’t been home in almost seven months, despite living only 20 minutes away. Now, the house almost seemed foreboding. The noisy and charming memories of childhood seemed stifled in the quiet cookie-cutter exterior of this freshly empty house. The dark wooden floors offered a hollow chord to my footsteps, and I damn near pissed myself when Spanky, a crotchety feline, jumped off the stairwell and darted down the basement stairs situated in the hallway. I cursed him under my breath as I recalled the cat was strictly forbidden from the basement because he had recently started pissing on things down there. 

During my previous visits, I had never bothered to see how my father remodeled the basement into his studio and household storage unit. It had always creeped me out as a child, and I guess that fear lingered, even in adulthood, because I just never went in there. I’d have to confront that fear for the next 12 days.

“Spankyyy” I peered my head into the dim stairwell and called to the cat, “come here Spanks. Good kitty, come here, you filthy fleabag.”

Entering the basement, dad had painted the floor with gray acrylic, and though it was painfully chilled for bare feet, it was easy to clean and kept everything tidy. Opposite the stairs, dad installed a small office to cut noise where his computers resided and the podcast played. It sat in a corner as a small, insulated box with one thick window to allow sight into the world beyond the cube. The rest of the basement was full of neatly arranged metal shelving full of unused household objects, seasonal decor, and Grandma’s belongings. Grandma had recently passed and my parents stored her stuff in the basement for later sorting that would likely never happen. 

She had an old tube television that she would hover over in her latter days, fixated to the point where she’d fail to acknowledge any living creature around her. No matter how it was adjusted, the TV never worked. Only salt and pepper danced across the screen. We realized her lucidity was in dire states when she became so obsessed with the television that she nearly starved her cat and herself (I should mention that the cat outlived her and is the same asshole prowling the basement at this moment). For whatever reason, the TV found a place on my father’s new shelves instead of the local dump. I reached to turn the knobs on the television but redirected my attention at the sound of something upstairs.

“Mike?” A voice called from above.

I had grown so absorbed in the cat that I had forgotten I invited Lyle over to study for an upcoming exam. I called him downstairs and we exchanged greetings. He was proud to display a thermos of warm whiskey-laced coffee and a six pack of beer, for studying, of course.

Lyle helped me extricate the cat - rather, it extricated itself as it bolted up the stairs with a ferocious hiss and we shut the door behind the beast. We opted to study in the office, enjoying the seclusion and lack of external distraction.

I’d had enough of the Krebs cycle and sighed deeply. Our brains had reached beyond the capacity to handle much more and we agreed it was time to call it a night. The clock flashed 9 PM and confirmed that thought. Lyle stood and stretched, exploring the shelving. His eyes locked on Grandma’s TV and he reached to touch the screen.

“Careful, Lyle, that thing might suck you in,” I joked. 

Lyle passed a confused look my way.

“Ah, it’s nothing. As a kid, my sister and I used to joke that that thing was possessed, and Grandma used to mutter that she saw otherworldly things through it.” I made spooky hands and sounds.

“Ha,” he muttered half heartily. “Listen, Mike... I better go.”

I glanced at him quizzically, “alright. Drive safe.” I presumed his sudden aversion was the consequence of a tired brain. As Lyle’s presence fully vanished, I opted to check on the show and throw up my own tidbit on a brief live episode. Dad had pumped up his followers that I would.

“Hello crew,” I spoke into the microphone, attempting to act like I had done this before. “This is... Mad Mike.” I paused, and the roll of my eyes was nearly audible as I reread the instructions to address myself as Mad Mike. “While James is off adventuring, he’s left me in charge of the place.” My voice cracked as I skimmed over the things Dad listed that I could talk about.

“Here’s a little spook for you to mull around your skulls in this evening hour. I grew up in this house, but we recently acquired my Grandma’s things in her passing, including the infamous haunted television from my childhood. What makes it haunted, I’m sure you ask? If you turn it on and look at it directly, the best you’ll get is a salt and pepper screen. However, if you see it in your peripheral, it shows flashes of harrowing images. Look back, and you’ll never fully see the images because they’ll be gone as strangely as they appeared in the corner of your eye. Or, at least that’s what we said as kids. So I gotta live with that thing for the next twelve days, and I’m going to try to discern those “ghost” images during my stay. Peace out, this is... Mad Mike.”


Walking up to the shelves, I saw the cold screen of the TV and contemplated what I was about to do. Carefully lifting it from its slumber, I brought it into the office and plugged it in. I held my fingers still on the knob, weighing the growing fear in my stomach one last time before I inevitably released some calamity of monsters free to this world.

*Click.*
	
I laughed with relief as not even the familiar salt and pepper danced across the screen. It was broken.


DAY ONE

In conjunction with the show, Dad and his friends had created a forum for his audience to talk. I think that was part of the success of the show, how interactive it was and how deeply it connected people from all over. I perused the forum subjects with particular interest on Current, and laughed to see “Mad Mike” mentioned several times. “Don’t get eaten by the sitcom demons” brought me a smile.

I typed out the comment, “Good morning folks, this is Mad Mike. I regret to inform you, though I’m secretly relieved, that the TV is broken. There will be no sitcom demons during my time here.” And with that, I pressed send, gathered my things, and set off for work and class.


I returned late in the evening. It was nice to be in such a homey place instead of my poor man’s overpriced studio. Spanky perched halfway up the stairs at her usual overlook, her tail twitching mildly in displeasure at my intrusion. I was surprised to learn that I was excited to check the show. I knew I had little part in it, but it brought my dad so much joy and I was happy to share that. 

My excitement was cut short, however. The sturdy basement door was ajar and I was certain, without doubt, I had shut it. I looked skeptically at Spanky, and as much as I would have liked to blame her, I knew that spastic cat was not capable of such a feat.

Nothing was amiss downstairs. I made my updates and checked the scheduled upload. I looked at the TV, quietly perched where I had left it in the office, still plugged in. Quickly, I turned it on but nothing had changed: it was still broken. I rolled my eyes, slightly disappointed with myself that I had honestly thought it could be any different. 

On. Off. On. Off. The repetition of the act enforced my empowered state of mind. And no matter how badly a sliver of me wanted something to happen just one time, the only thing that appeared was my reflection staring disapprovingly with the office doorway behind me. 

On. Off- a silhouette of a shadowed, gangly figure loomed in the doorway behind my own reflection. I shot like a rocket forward and around. But no one stood in the open doorway.

Off. And unplugged.


DAY TWO:

With the approach of morning, I gladly awoke from a troubled sleep. There was no way to explain what I had seen on the TV, but I chocked it up to nervous anticipation playing tricks on the mind.

To my delight, class had been canceled and I wasn’t scheduled for work today. Realistically, that meant a day to dedicate to studying. Given the event that took place the night before, I opted to study in the open air of the living room rather than the basement, but that proved challenging, as Spanky is legitimately a psychotic bitch. The cat made every effort to harass and break my morale, even bringing a live mouse as the final straw which she proudly dropped on my book, causing the creature to scurry across my workspace and me to throw my papers. I cursed the beast, gathered my things, and slammed the basement door behind me.

Entering the basement was a sober change of pace. Though I still lingered in my frustration, an unsettling sense of dread filled me as I surveyed the space. The TV sat dumbly where it had been left all night, so I reluctantly began my studies.
	
Transfixed on my studies, the TV suddenly turned on with a horrible buzz, black and white specks dancing over the screen. My heart slammed in my chest. I turned the knob to shut off the television, and stared in disbelief. Quickly, I checked the door beside me, relaxing only slightly when I found no intruder.

Still shaking and stupefied, I needed some form of human encouragement. 

“Hey guys,” I announced. “It’s Mike - Mad Mike.” I had quickly lost my suave. Dad would be disappointed, I needed to pull it together. “We uh, we’ve got a scheduled show just around the corner… But before that I thought it’d be fun to feed your imagination. Remember that old TV I told you about? Well, the dam - goshdarned thing just turned on by itself. Spooky stuff, folks,” I teased. “Spooky stuff,” the humor in my voice faded. “But like I said, we got a fine lineup- FUCK!”

The TV turned back on. I cringed realizing the the colossal fuck I had just dropped on Dad’s baby.

“Well ha!” I laughed nervously. “It uh... it’s back on! HA! Isn’t that the darnedest thing.” 

The fear was thick on my voice. “Uh... enjoy the show,” I exited the stream. 

To compliment the black and white blizzard across the screen, the horrible sound of static blared through its tiny speakers. Worse still, despite frantic efforts to shut it off, the television wouldn’t stop, even when unplugged.

I tried to ignore it, but my best efforts were futile. The static picked at every nerve, making study impossible and clouding my reason. When I left, I swear I could hear it other parts of the house. Hoping for some solution, I checked the forum:

“It must have a battery.”

“BRUUUH”

“Get that thing out of the house!” 

“Pussy!!!”

They offered no real resolution, but the TV was powered off now, and I guess it does make sense that there must be a battery somewhere in the device. At least I’ll tell myself that.


DAY THREE:

During the night, sleep came uneasily and stayed even less easily. Noises plagued the house and sounded eerily like footsteps, I woke cranky, exhausted, and with little time to waste before class. I rushed down the stairs towards the front door when I noticed that the basement door was, once again, wide open. 

Spanky must have known I didn’t have time to spare this morning and made a brilliant dash into the basement despite my efforts to grab her. With time ticking away, I ran down the basement stairs, cursing and praying for a quick removal. Spanky hid under the nearest shelf.

“Dammit, Spanky, I don’t have time for this. Get out of here.” I sneered. I heard her meow in mournful response.

“Come here. Come here, kitty.”

“Mrrrrrrow,” she wailed. 

“Spanky, please!”

She hissed savagely and scampered into the office.

“Spanky, if you get eaten, I will feel zero remorse. ... Spanky?”

“Mrow.” Followed by a deep, feline growl. I entered the room to find Spanky in the corner furthest from the television. Her tail flailed wildly and every hair on her body stood on end as she yowled at the TV.

I cooed at her in a desperate attempt to calm her. The TV was off. There was no haunting image, just a slightly skewed view of the room with me crouching towards an angry, senile cat. As I diverted my attention, the reflection on the TV moved in the corner of my eye, but looking back at it, it was the same image as before. I looked at the TV. What the hell was going on. 

Spanky took the chance to run out of the room and back upstairs. I was relieved that she chose to make this ordeal somewhat easier, and, my eyes still locked on the TV, I quickly grabbed it to place it back on the shelves.

“Hi, twerp,” it was the familiar voice of my sister, but still scared me half to death. “That was a better scare than I was expecting!”

“Funny,” I glared at her.

“Hey, ma and pa said you’d be here, and I just wuv you so much,”

“I don’t have time for this,” I said with half feigned frustration and full sincerity. “But… do you remember the stories we used to tell about this thing?” I gestured with my face at the TV.

“Oh gosh, those old ghost stories? I don’t know. Something about teeth on the screen and voices? You know grandma was a few screws loose in those days.” At that moment she noticed the look of concern on my face. “Hey, you alright?”

“Yeah. Yeah, It’s nothing. I have a stressful exam soon and now I’m going to be late for class today.”

Sister smiled sternly and hugged me ferociously before practically shoving me up the stairs, promising to lock up the house and deal with the cat. I thanked her and ran out the door.


DAY SIX:

The last two days went smoothly, and I was content to believe that the few weird episodes I had experienced were nothing to worry about. I was just stressed. All my woes must have been caused by an anxious mind. Not ghosts. Not a demonic TV. Just stress and exasperated by a vindictive cat. I vigorously scratched Spanky’s neck as she expressed a rare moment of affection. I’d certainly blame her for all of this, after her antics. 

Since seeing my sister, I hadn’t bothered to check dad’s podcast. Dad did set it up to run on it’s own, after all. But I thought perhaps I wasn’t being as diligent as I could be. So I made a point to hold my promise and check all his accounts when I got home later that evening.

Opening the forums revealed a medley of notifications and a handful of private messages. Most speculated that I was now dead, but one caught my attention and sent shivers down my spine:

“Have you seen it?”

I scowled at the message, contemplating my next move. Three familiar buttons danced suddenly danced across the screen as the sender prepared a new message:

“When you do, it’s too late. Get rid of it.”

Not if, but *when.* I didn’t bother to reply.

The message left such a sour taste in my mouth that I decided I’d rather play a movie upstairs and read my notes. Approaching the stairs, something caught my eye. I groaned as I scanned the room and realized it came from the direction of the television.

Its obsolete hulk sat quietly on the shelf. I thought perhaps the movement could be answered by Spanky because it was roughly the same color, but searching the area around the TV revealed no angry cat. I turned my eyes to the left side of the isle when I saw it again by the television. Woefully, as my eyes darted back to the TV, there was nothing to be seen, just a still, black screen. My pulse erupted. It was real. It wasn’t the nerves of college life. 

When we were kids, we never spent much time with grandma alone, and as she grew more insane she never left that television. We’d have dinner “with” her, but she’d just snap at us and take one or two bites of food off her TV tray table and stare and that damned box. She grew violent, flipping the tray and demanding answers from the television. 

The final straw, however, came after she chased me down and held my face against the glass screen while she screeched at me to tell her what I could see. I cried. I pissed myself. Dad pried her off of me, and Mom finally agreed with her sisters that it was time Grandma needed professional care. That was the end of our stories about the TV she coveted so greatly. 

We never saw anything, maybe that was because our minds just couldn’t quite grasp it or maybe it was because the TV was fully preoccupied with her. Nonetheless, I was now seeing what we had whispered as children. My eyes grew wide and my pupils dilated with adrenaline. 
	
“I could look away,” I thought. “I just have to keep my eyes locked on the other side of the isle, and then I’ll have an answer to this thing. It’ll be nothing. I won’t see anything. And I can kick myself, sure.”

It took every ounce of will to move my eyes to the other side, but in immediate response the TV flashed in the corner of my eye. My gut reaction made me look back at the screen, trying to see clearly what writhed in my peripheral. It offered only a mute reflection.

“Don’t look back dammit, fuck, why am I even doing this???” I asked myself out loud.

“Don’t. Look. Back. Keep focus.” I whispered to myself before my eyes darted to the other side. I was so focused that I couldn’t see the box of Christmas lights in front of my eyes as the images in my peripheral flashed like a morbid strobe. 

I couldn’t discern the images in any clarity. Light flickered unsteadily like a candle and something fleshy rotated perpetually. But the most disturbing was what appeared to be a set of horrid teeth: a horribly deformed maw with slobbery, bucked teeth. It gagged and its tongue wiggled out of its toothy gate like a bloated seal on a rocky shore. The entire image played in an uncomfortable orange hue, and those teeth... I could almost hear the thick-saliva-coated lips smacking together. My gaze slowly drifted back- the television burst on with a ferocious hiss of salt and pepper.

“You’re not even plugged in!?!?” I shoved it off the shelf and it fell dumbly to the floor, birthing a single, deep crack from top to bottom. The chaos on the screen stopped. I fled upstairs and slammed the basement door.

I grabbed liquor from the cabinet, and poured a generous glass, gulping it greedily.

“This can’t- there has be some kind of logical explanation.”

I rummaged through my coat’s pockets for the pack of cigs I was holding for a friend. I could count the number of times I had smoked, and very few of those times actually warranted the necessity, but this time it did. I grabbed the cig and ran outside, deeply and selfishly inhaling the warm, acrid smoke. I focused on breath and the sting in my lungs. 

The last time I enacted this ritual was during a meltdown early in my college life. I laughed at how trivial that event was in comparison to this... supernatural bullshit. Hell, this thing probably caused my grandma’s demise! It indirectly - maybe even directly - killed a person, drove her mad! Wait… was I mad? Was this a mental breakdown? Schizophrenia? No, no. Stop.

I threw the butt on the ground and drove my shoe into it. I exhaled, deeply, shoulders slouching and lungs wheezing, before opening the door.

The basement door was wide open and the television rested in front of it, pointed towards the front door. I shut the front door and opened it again, hoping the scene in the house would be different. But it wasn’t. I walked carefully towards it, refusing to take my eyes off of it lest the images return in sinister precision. I plucked the TV off the floor, holding it far from my person as if it were some filthy object, ran outside, and threw it in the trash for the garbage man.

Another shot of the went down with a sting in my throat. 


DAY SEVEN:

I sat against my bed on the floor all night. I kept the lights on, and every time I dared to doze I’d wake startled and terrified.

Throughout the night the noises in the house increased, except this time they were certainly the sounds of bare feet pacing the house. They prowled in an unsure gait. I heard a few things fall. Many times, Spanky even acknowledged the noises, and hissed one time when I thought the footsteps approached my bedroom door.

Her hiss reverberated into a deep growl and her hackles prickled erect when the footsteps returned to the door a second time. The final plap separated by the thin panels of the hollow core door. Quietly, I crept to the door to brace it, and, o my displeasure, I realized I could hear an indiscernible whisper on the other side as I grew closer. 

The speaker was so hushed it was impossible to make out what they were saying, but there was a cadence to the sound and a venom in its pitch. I placed my ear silently against the door to better hear it: the whispering stopped abruptly, replaced a moment later by the wet separation of gums and mouth. Chewing. Slapping. I could almost feel its hot breaths behind its messy jaw movements. Suddenly, the piercing sound of static caused me to reel awake.

The light of dawn was just starting to fill the sky. I was still on the floor, and Spanky blinked slowly towards me with her paws tucked under her chest when I flinched awake.

“Spanks, you had my back all night.” I warily smiled at her. “I won’t blame you after this week, I promise.”

I groggily lifted myself from the floor. Looking at the clock, I was already late for class. 

“All or nothing,” I sighed, embracing the opportunity to ditch and evaluate my potentially failing mental health. I only cared about coffee, maybe some Bailey’s in that coffee too.

Placing my hand on the doorknob, I paused. I had to leave the room at some point, and I begrudgingly pulled the door towards me, revealing the cracked, wretched TV patiently waiting for me on the other side.

“I guess it’s better to be late than not show up at all,” I thought.

I did everything I could to avoid home. Even though I attended class, I couldn’t take notes let alone actually learn anything. Throughout the entire lecture I kept seeing... things. But as soon as I looked over where it was, it’d be gone. At one point during class I watched a classmate silently ignite and burn alive. I refused to acknowledge it, sweating and trembling in my seat, but suddenly I could smell the burning flesh. I ran out of class to puke in the nearest trash can.

I went out for dinner with friends, but when they started to notice I was acting aloof, I left; there was no sense explaining what was going on as it’d be over in just a few days. I went to the bar and drank alone until closing. It was a dive bar, and while dive bars attract interesting people, everyone looked horrifically disfigured in my peripheral. In every corner lurked a tall shadow of a lanky, gray man until, once again, I looked that way only to see a well lit, empty space. 

The man next to me at the bar top clacked his disfigured jaws together, teeth protruding in all directions, and I looked at him in disgust only to see that his face was perfectly normal. I nervously gestured to my drink in an attempt to cover for myself, but he held his glare at me and told me to “get fucked.” I chugged the remaining half of my beer and left for home.

I parked my car in the driveway but I refused to go inside. I sat in my car for another hour before finally working up the courage to go inside and bee-line for my room, drunkenly stumbling up the stairs.

Exhaustion won.


DAY NINE:

3 AM. Every electronic device in the house turned suddenly on, screeching, buzzing, beeping all at once. I woke with a start, immediately on my feet. I tripped over the television, now resting foot of my bed. The black and white blizzard whirled over the screen, and I lifted it over and my head and chucked it down the stairs. 

Even after flying through the air, it still displayed the static screen and horrible buzz. I spent the next 37 minutes turning off everything in the house. Unlike the demon television, the other devices shut off. But the TV, freshly shattered, continued to play.

I ran downstairs towards the office but… stopped at the shelves. One shelf was newly emptied, and a chunk of meat rested on the shelves, slowly crawling in tight circles and groping like a wayward leech.

I bolted past the disembodied flesh into the office, logging in and searching for the ominous message I had ignored earlier.

“What do I do if I see it?” I typed frantically.

An hour passed without response. “I told you to get rid of it when you had the chance.”

“Gee, thanks. That’s so helpful.”

“...”

“No, no. Look, there’s so much going on right now. Forgive me, I don’t mean to be an
ass. But I need a serious answer on what to do.

“Well, have you seen it?’

“What’s it?”

“The man. Have you seen the gray man?”

“In the corner of my eye.”

“Then there’s a chance. Burn it.” 

A loud crash from the bathroom upstairs absorbed my attention. It was too loud to ignore and I didn’t want to be caught off guard and cornered in the basement. I approached the bathroom. I knocked on the door, hoping by some stupid chance a friend would reply.

I was no surgeon yet, but I opened the door with similar precision. Each click of its interior gears caused my heart to stall, each second dragging a perceived eternity. Before it was fully open, I groped for the light switch, illuminating the sacrilegious tomb in incandescent gloom. The light gave me the confidence to open the door fully, and I squinted in the yellow glow as if it were as bright as the Sun. 

I looked at my face. Something was wrong. I opened my mouth wide and all my teeth were yellowed, decayed and protruding. As I stared at my reflection, mouth agape, I could not control the rapid repetition of my jaw clacking open and shut, open and shut, open and shut, sending sticky tendrils of spit across the mirror. I slammed the light switch off and fell out of the bathroom.

I grabbed the TV. It had not moved from where I threw it earlier. From the kitchen, I grabbed the strongest proof bottle from the liquor cabinet and a cast iron pan... the best hammer I could improvise in a rush. I threw the television in the driveway and pulverized it with the pan. Plastic shrapnel scattered. I poured the potent liquor over the mess and threw a match on it. Slowly, the flames gained traction. I was relieved to watch it burn. Thick plumes of black smoke began to trail from its remains, and I caught a neighbor gawking. Glaring at the nosy neighbor, they immediately averted their gaze, shutting their blinds. I didn’t care.

I abruptly recalled that dad hid a handgun in a minimalist case velcroed under the couch. I wanted the assurance of brass and gunpowder, even if it was futile or unnecessary at this point. No time to waste, I flipped the couch and retrieved the 9 mm. Spanky perched nearby, uncomfortable at the disturbance. I grabbed her and pled for her cooperation. 

I ran downstairs with Spanky and the gun. I ensured that the basement door was shut and quickly passed through the storage area. There was no phantom slug meat, no possessed TV. Was it over?

I dragged Spanky into the office and shut the door behind me. I took the extra chair in the office and propped it against the door’s handle. I held my head in my hands for a long while before resuming. To my disbelief, the day had been spent, and the clock in the corner of the monitor displayed 11:47 PM.

“I destroyed it. I smashed it and I burned it.” I sent the stranger.

“Good.” He replied. “Anything since then?” 

“No.”

11:59 PM: I fell asleep with my face in my hands, elbow dragging out the letter N into the reply box.


DAY TEN:

I woke at 4:59 with a nauseous feeling in my gut. Resisting the urge to spew whatever meager stomach contents I had in my father’s office, I ran upstairs into the hallway bathroom, emptying the contents into the toilet. The foul taste of bile filled my mouth, and I drooled into the toilet, watching the strands of green-tinted spit slowly fall into the bowl.

I stood up and shifted to the right. I pitied my reflection. My eyes were sunken. My skin was pale. I was clearly exhausted. I opened the mirror’s medicine cabinet and rifled through the list of medication. I was searching desperately for ibuprofen and some sort of sleep aid, maybe a prescription muscle relaxant to boot. I was fortunate to find all three.

I slammed the mirror shut. The reflection revealed the doorway behind me with a gangly figure in the middle stepping forward. I threw the pills. Their delicate pings echoed in my ear as they collided and rolled down the porcelain, bouncing everywhere like a hypochondriac’s confetti. Whirling around, there was no one in the doorway, but I dared not risk it. I fled down the basement stairs, tripping near the middle.

While the fall was far from graceful, it could have been worse. I lay sprawled on the floor in a stupor. Groaning in agony, I sat upright slowly. I crawled into the office, slamming the door behind me and propping the chair against the door. Spanky hissed cruelly. The damn TV was on the table.


I video called the stranger over and over until he answered, “it didn’t work! It didn’t work!”

“What’s happening?”

“It’s here. I saw it. In the reflection. The TV is in here too. I don’t get it. I burned it! I
BURNED IT!!!”

“A reflection? It’s still a reflection. You haven’t seen it in pers-“

Spanky yowled. I looked in her direction. Her hair stood on end and her teeth were bared in ferocious display. My heart raced, but I followed her eyes’ path to the window.

Something loomed on the other side: a horrible figure leaned against the window. It propped its anorexic, pale body on the glass as, perhaps hoping it would break with little effort. Mouth agape, each breath left fog on the glass before it. The half-decayed jaw muscles propelled its mouth to close like a trap over and over again. Suddenly, it’s ghostly eyes rolled towards me, and through its white pupils I could tell that it was looking at me, watching me. It screeched. It pounded its fists on the glass and the static blared. 
	

Hours passed, the TV still twitching in static and illuminating enough of the room to let me know that there was movement on the other side of the glass. But that damn static sound. I wanted to cry… I did. I wept until my collar and sleeves were soggy. But that demon gave no remorse. It lingered in the dim light on the other side of the glass, approaching occasionally to watch me like a zoo display.

I stood up and stared down my foe. It stood at least a foot taller than me and predicted my every movement, mimicking me with startling accuracy. I held the gun to my head and it held its hand, fingers rolled in a mock revolver to its head and what remnants of its lips curled in a smirk. I mocked the sound of a gunshot and pulled the gun back in “ricochet.” It copied.

I held the gun to the window, challenging it. It glowered back now, furious at my defiance.

“I’ll shoot you,” I stammered, “square between the eyes!” 

Only that clear barrier of glass separated the monster’s forehead and the muzzle of my gun. It smashed its fists against the glass, shrieking once again as the window shook.

I let loose the single round, and another.

The glass did not crack and my ears rang. Violently, the window imploded, showering me in glass. Where the window formerly perched, a static TV screen had replaced it.

I could not... handle the sound... any longer.

“What do you see???” I replayed the memory of my grandmother screaming at me, spit flying from her mouth as she hissed through clenched teeth.


DAY ELEVEN:

“Yo, twerp!” Sister had used a spare key to open the front door. “I know you’re here somewhere... I see your car!” She cocked her head at the sight of pills strewn upon the floor by the half bath.

“Hey, dad called. He said there was something wrong with the podcast?” He said he was worried you had mucked it up? Where are you??? Dude, he said some weirdo was harassing him about you... twerp?” She was startled by Spanky who bolted from the jarred basement door, sliding on the floor in a panic.

Spanky ran past her feet under the kitchen table, leaving a trail of sticky, dark foot prints on the wooden floor. She ran her fingers across them to reveal a crimson stain across her fingers. The cat perched under the table, licking its paws. Hesitating but a moment, she grabbed the basement door and ran downstairs. It was dark, aside from the flickering light of a television. She flicked the light on.
	
“Michael?!? No...”

The open window offered no screen to the grisly mess of her brother. His head lulled backwards, throat slit and exposed by a brutal shard of glass still clutched in his hand. Sobbing, she pried at the barricaded door. As her efforts failed, she trembled as she dialed 911, pausing only but a moment when movement caught the corner of her eye.",1,1737637067.0,deepnightsociety,0,0.67,False

Will it get better?","Hi there, I'm sorry if I format this badly at all, I'm not used to posting on Reddit in general & I'm not sure if this is the right flair or even sub :').

As a bit of background I recently turned 19M, and throughout my childhood as far as I can remember I've had what I would describe as 'mild' social anxiety (in the sense that I'd never really had a panic attack before). I would avoid speaking/performing infront of others, crowded places, and had trouble in IRL social situations, though I've always been pretty social online and voice chatting has never been a problem. I could always mask this anxiety for the most part when needed and I've spent my entire childhood staring at screens and playing video games in my spare time instead of going outside so I never seeked help back then.

Coming up to more recently, I suddenly started feeling some majorly uncomfortable and frightening symptoms such as brain fog, insane fatigue all day, and what I would say are the beginnings of panic attacks before I can calm myself down/distract myself. It started around a month ago, where suddenly I had trouble thinking, I felt like my head was constantly blank, and it would cause alot of worry. I would also be yawning and extremely tired by 2-4pm every day (which I still am). I attempted to nap whenever this sleepiness happened but I would find myself laying in bed with my eyes closed for hours on end without being able to fall asleep. I immediately reduced all my caffeine intake and made my diet much better as a result of this, hoping that was the issue. I have gone from drinking a Monster energy drink every morning & exclusively pepsi/coke throughout the day to drinking one coffee in the morning and only water. This unfortunately has not really solved my issue, though I'm now making it to the night and getting 8-10 hours of sleep almost every day by powering through it.

Following around a week of this, I contacted my GP (a sort of doctor in the UK) with my symptoms who went on to check my thyroid etc in a blood test, which all came back normal. I continued to suffer with these symptoms alongside some new 'panic attack' problem I started having. I would be walking through a supermarket looking at things on the shelves and thinking to myself 'I should be getting ingredients for meals, what meals should I be getting? Why am I just aimlessly staring at things? Why am I not thinking/why is my head blank?' which immediately followed up with a lightheaded feeling, my heart/chest 'dropping', and my legs feeling weak. I started to walk quickly whilst leaning on the trolley, and tried my best to entirely focus on one item to the next until I could get out of there as fast as possible. It felt like I was on the edge of passing out, and even with intentional breathing, I would end up thinking to myself 'Why am I intentionally breathing? Oh yeah, the feeling I just had...' and it would rush back. I ended up getting out of the store and my girlfriend kept my mind occupied by yapping to me on the way home. This type of incident has happened 3 times in the past month, every time in a shop, and every time triggered by my own thoughts and worries about said thing happening again.

Since these events, I contacted the GP again, who this time referred me to CBT and encouraged me to improve my BMI (I'm overweight for my height but by no means immobile/extremely overweight) to aid my mental health. Alongside this they also booked me in for another blood test to check cortisol/testosterone, if I remember correctly, which is in around 3 weeks from now. I got the call for CBT after self referring and I am now on a \~5 month waiting list.

I can't think of a specific trigger that could've caused all of this. The closest I can think is at the end of the month prior to the symptoms beginning, I had tried a THC vape with my girlfriend and took too many puffs (being a non-cannabis consumer) and ended up in a '3-day bed ridden brain fog recovery session'. During that time I got very poor sleep, felt dizzy all the time, head spinning, would space out and experience the brain fog etc. This was absolutely terrifying for me but after a few days it cleared up and I seemed okay for the weeks to follow. I'm aware my current anxiety is likely caused by the fear of experiencing said anxiety, and it's a cycle that really sucks. But I also wonder if those terrible few days could have caused a heightening in my pre-existing 'mild' anxiety that was delayed and has only appeared recently. And again, maybe I'm making my current situation worse by relating it to those few days... who knows T\_T. I would also like to say that I do not drink alcohol, or do any sort of drugs, and I had only tried one of these vapes as a way of destressing from normal life things (moving out time, work, etc) which was admittedly very very stupid. I feel immense guilt already & while I appreciate any replies being honest, please don't lay into me too much for it :').

I've looked into all of this, and even resorted to going into details about all of these symptoms with an AI to 'soft diagnose' myself to give me some answers, and I think it really is just anxiety, and I'm doing it to myself. I would just like to know if anyone else here has had a similar experience, how they're doing with it, maybe experience with CBT relating to the experience? I'm not sure. I would just like some comfort in honest answers, and most of all I'd like to ask if I might ever be able to return to normal daily activities like shopping or work without fear of having a panic attack, or if I'm just going to have to endure the attacks and learn not be so drained, terrified, and debilitated by them in the moment.

So, I dunno if I'm doing something wrong, so I come to you with hopes of getting some advice.

My 6 months old dog has two issues and one is becoming an habit. He still pees inside and sometimes he does the number two as well. The other issue is, he still keeps eating his own poo...

For you to understand, when he does number two inside it's usually when I leave alone for a bit. Actually, he never doesn't in front of us, when inside. For example, I work remotely from home, so sometimes I leave the house to pick up some stuff, or just for an eat break downstairs at the coffee shop. It never takes more than 20 minutes. The other situation is sometimes, when we are all asleep during night time, he does it. Everytime he does it inside and we are not around, he eats it. I've never scolded him for doing it or eles. I just pick it up, clean everything. When he does outside, I give him compliments and a treat.

Today does exactly 1 month that he is with us. I take him outside 4 times a day for him to do his stuff, and to do some walks and play as well. I noticed that in terms of doing it outside he is improving, but I'm afraid that the poo eating is becoming an habit...

Did any of you went through something similar?
How long ir took you to fully potty train yours and how old was he/she when he become 100% potty trained?

Am I doing something wrong?

Also, his poo is soft,, most of the time, is it normal? 
He eats a premium quality food, for baby/junior dogs.

I ve been working a new job as a bartender since december and it's my first job of this kind. In the past I worked a part-time desk job so bartendering is a pretty new thing for me. I thought that I can manage the stress and the enviroment but I was wrong. 

For the first two weeks everything seemed to be normal and was going well but lately I feel like the lack of sleep and the stress starts getting to me. Besides that I feel like I have a pretty weird realtionship with the coworker that is supposed to teach me the things in the bar. When I work with them I feel anxious because I feel like everything I do is wrong and while at first they would try teaching me stuff now the only thing that I do is the work that nobody wants to do like washing the dishes, making the juices, carrying the goods in the attic and they rarely let me touch the coffee machine (I usually work morning shifts). They are always rushing me in doing work when there are barely any customer in the bar. For example I need to make a fresh juice for a client and I have to cut the oranges, wash them, squeeze them, etc. and it never takes me more than 1 minute and a half but they are always like ""quick, quick"". 

In the meantime I started to work with other coworkers and I am way more relaxed when I work with anyone else. They would let me make coffes, cocktails and so on.

The problem is that lately the anxiety at work started to hit outside of it. I have a hard time resting, I feel physicaly exhausted, I often wake up without having the energy to do another shift, and I feel like I have a nod in my throat a lot of times. Also I feel like I have a hard time hanging out in large groups, going out,  something that I used to do before now feels really draining and exhausting.

This article delves into how magnetic fields and their components—traditionally overlooked in engineering—can yield profound effects on energy systems and motion. By revisiting older theories and experimental setups, we can uncover the untapped potential of Ether field energy and its applications in plasma spark charging systems.

# Rediscovering Magnetic Pressure

Magnetic pressure refers to a fundamental component of magnetism that has been historically ignored. Early experiments by scientists showed that magnetic fields consist of three key properties: magnitude, vector direction, and pressure. However, modern engineering has largely disregarded the pressure component, focusing instead on magnitude and vector. This oversight has limited our ability to fully harness the potential of magnetic fields.

Recent experiments have demonstrated the significance of this pressure component. By using setups involving rotating magnetic fields, coils, and magnets, researchers have observed reactionless thrust and motion, which challenge traditional physics. For example, a rotating magnetic field with a vertical directional component can create imbalances that lead to observable movement in objects, such as coffee mugs or suspended steel balls.

# Practical Applications: From Coils to Homopolar Generators

Several experiments highlight the practical implications of harnessing magnetic pressure:

1. **Rotating Magnetic Fields:** By wrapping an iron cube or steel ball with magnetic coils and introducing phased currents, a rotating magnetic field can be created. This field generates a directional pressure component that results in physical movement. The setup has demonstrated effects such as moving suspended objects without physical contact.
2. **Magnetic Coil Systems:** Larger magnetic coil systems, such as 18-inch-diameter coils, can create significant magnetic pressure drops. These setups can manipulate electron orbits, resulting in controlled energy recirculation and thrust generation. When combined with homopolar generators, the magnetic field can be amplified, creating a low-pressure zone for propulsion.
3. **Caducus and Star Coils:** Coils designed in specific geometries, such as caducus coils, can emit directed magnetic pressure waves. These waves, resembling beams, have applications in energy transmission and manipulation.

# Implications for Plasma Spark Charging

The ability to manipulate magnetic pressure has direct implications for plasma spark charging systems. Plasma behaves like a viscous superfluid, responding to magnetic fields in ways that can be engineered for energy extraction and control. By creating sharp rise or fall times in magnetic fields (back EMF), it is possible to generate significant magnetic pressure changes, leading to efficient energy harvesting.

Experimental setups involving bifilar cone coils and segmented spinning discs have shown that these configurations can produce measurable current flow. For instance, counter-rotating discs with embedded magnetic segments can create a pressure imbalance, driving current through a connected circuit. This phenomenon suggests a new approach to plasma spark charging that leverages the Ether field’s intrinsic properties.

# The Biological Impact of Magnetic Pressure

Magnetic pressure waves also interact with biological systems. Experimental setups using square wave signals have reportedly caused adverse effects such as coughing, sneezing, and allergic reactions. In contrast, sine wave signals appear to have milder biological effects. This observation highlights the need for careful consideration of waveforms when developing technologies that utilize magnetic pressure.

# Reimagining Energy Systems

By integrating the concept of magnetic pressure into engineering, we open the door to groundbreaking advancements. Technologies that manipulate magnetic pressure can provide reactionless thrust, efficient energy recirculation, and innovative energy harvesting solutions. The potential applications range from propulsion systems to wireless energy transfer and beyond.

This exploration of Ether field energy and plasma spark charging underscores the importance of revisiting foundational principles of physics. By embracing the overlooked pressure component of magnetic fields, we can unlock new possibilities for energy systems and redefine the boundaries of technology.

I’m wanting to switch up my drink order from the usual. I always order a cold brew with soft top and add caramel drizzle to the top or a basic iced vanilla latte. 

I’m not into overly sweet drinks, more on the bitter side so I can actually taste the coffee. Vanilla, hazelnut or caramel are my go to’s.

I’m starting off this new year with a goal to meet some amazing new people—whether it’s for friendship, meaningful conversations, or maybe even something more if the connection is right.  

A little about me:  
- I’m passionate about staying active, exploring nature, and capturing moments through my camera—especially portraits. If you’re up for a hike or a photoshoot, I’m your guy!  
- I’m a curious soul who loves learning new things and sharing ideas. Whether it’s tech, art, or life in general, I’m always up for a good chat.  
- I’m easygoing, open-minded, and value genuine connections.  

What I’m looking for:  
- Someone around my age (but I’m flexible!) who’s kind, fun, and shares similar interests—or has cool hobbies I can learn about.  
- Friendships to start, but I’m open to seeing where things go if there’s a spark.  
- I’m based in Italy, but I’m totally cool with online friends too. If you’re nearby, even better—we can grab a coffee or explore somewhere new together.  

If you’re looking for someone to share laughs, deep conversations, or adventures with, feel free to send me a message! Tell me a little about yourself, your favorite hobby, or the last thing that made you smile. Looking forward to hearing from you! 😊  ",0,1737636166.0,r4r,1,0.33,False

Assalamuliykum. Hope everyone is well. My DMs have been flooded (astagfirullah by some weird questions too) but nonetheless thought I’d provide an update.

The day of my post my wife went to her parents house as she couldn’t face being alone. She did respect my space once I was firm on needing space. Did also get the house checked for more devices (way too expensive) and there wasn’t anything else. Yesterday we both took a day off as we needed to talk. Initially I asked if we could go for a drive but my wife said that means I’ll definitely break up with her. Apparently thats a cliche. I then suggested we go back home to talk and have lunch together which she agreed to.

We ate in silence for the most part and my wife was shaking throughout. My wife asked to speak first and explained her side. She said that throughout our marriage shes been insecure because her family said I’d never accept her because my “first choice” was studying medicine whereas she was in university for nursing. They said I’d want someone on my level as alhamdulilah I’m doing well in my career. She also saw a picture of the girl and she thinks she’s prettier. I explained she wasn’t even a first choice, I had just met her for a coffee once and didn’t feel a connection. I also said I’m extremely attracted to her, hence why I’m always affectionate with her.

She then said that her mother and sisters just told her to be wary of men because it’s in their nature not to be monogamous. They got in her head and she apologised for constantly bombarding me with questions and planting these devices. She said I can be in front of her every time she sees or speaks to them so I can trust shes not being influenced again. I told her this isn’t healthy not realistic. She also said I can cut her allowance and not buy her anything until shes won back my trust. I again said this isn’t healthy. 

She said she’s starting therapy on Saturday and that we should speak to an imam too, both great ideas I told her. I suggested that we still take space from each other but we can still call and we’ll set up a weekly date night. My wife asked if we can go back home, and that she’ll even stay on the floor. I said I want to work on moving back slowly, but I promise I still want her. I told her I’d even turn off my location since I know she’s been checking it, and that she has access to my phone but cant snoop through it which she agreed to. I also told her how disappointed I am in her family which she took accountability for. My wife was begging for forgiveness and once we hugged didn’t let go. We even spent a few more hours playing chess and watching a movie before I dropped her home.

I told my sister about the fight since I was back home but she said she’s still very sceptical. I am cautious too but I need to give her another chance because my wife gives me comfort in ways I’ve never felt before (stress too lol). When I have a bad day or when I’m upset because my grandmother is ill, shes my comfort. We both are very much in love but got things to work on. Please keep us both in your duas.",4,1737635743.0,MuslimMarriage,3,1.0,False

We are living in Graz city center near by 3 year, and city center is nice to live and we have everything in under our hand. But living in apartments are kind a boring in some point. And also people are not so friendly, they mostly stay on their corners. Also it become really crowded for us, and we decided to move outside of the city. And our next location is in Gralla, and we plan to live happily ever after. And I wonder how is the culture and neighborhood is in that area! We went there for little shopping and drink coffee and wein few time, we like the general atmosphere honestly. Just wonder, if anyone living there and have something to share, also all kind advise about surrounding. I’m also planning to go back to mountainbiking when we move.

1i82aiv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1i82aiv/i_have_add_and_doing_this_to_help/,I have add and doing this to help,"Last year, I happened into a stack in a Reddit thread and used it quite successfully. Many thanks to X5Dragon, the author, for sharing:

French maritime bark extract (100 mg twice a day with meals) and pycnogenol

-Alpha GPC (600 mg with food twice a day)

-500 mg of rhodiola rosea twice a day, without food

I also take 200 mg of L-theanine with my first cup of coffee. The root of astragalus (450 mg)

And with food, the following: -One thousand IU of vitamin D Vitamin K (100 microgrammes) The oil of fish (2,000 mg) -B-complex (multi; I'm not sure how much I can recall)

I frequently take one or two days off from these each week, not because I am so knowledgeable about cycling but more because I tend to forget. However, I appear to perform well. 

I take additional fish oil at night and a scoop of Moon Brew, a powdered sleep aid that has the following ingredients: zinc (22 mg), l-tryptophan (500 mg), l-theanine (150 mg), chamomile (500 mg), mag glycinate/taurate (72 mg), jujube seed, arborvitae seed, polygala root, reishi, and silk tree bark (all 250 mg). These are mostly from lifeextensions, ndepot and highstreetpharma.

Since I'm still learning stacks, I'd like to add something to help me stay motivated in the morning and during the day. I have quite significant ADHD, and when it's bad, I tend to get overwhelmed and anxious. Although the supports I'm receiving are helpful, I believe I could be doing more.

Any advice would be good",2,1737635488.0,Biohackers,1,1.0,False

1i8283r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Manchester_Social/comments/1i8283r/hi_im_raza/,Hi! I’m Raza,"Hi everyone, I’m Raza! As much as I hate to admit it, I’m 40—though thanks to a baby face, I wasn’t even allowed to buy super glue in B&Q last week! I consider myself lucky to have a busy but fulfilling career and a decent social circle here in Manchester, where I was born and raised (even though I worked around the UK for a while). That said, I’ve recently realized I’ve gotten too comfortable and want to start living life a bit more—meeting new people and trying new things.

Interests:

-I like to stay active: I hit the gym, use my Peloton, and enjoy playing sports socially. I’ve even been thinking of trying beginner Padel classes—any takers?
- I used to love video games as a kid and am considering getting back into them (though I’d probably only be good at retro stuff right now).
- I’m a big music fan with a varied taste but haven’t been to as many gigs as I’d like. Looking to change that!
- I enjoy TV and movies, but don’t get much time to watch. I’ve recently started dipping my toes into anime through Netflix, so I’d love some recommendations.
- I’m a fan of Manchester’s food and coffee scene, from hidden gems to upscale spots. Supporting new independent places is my thing.
- I’m always up for trying something new—so long as someone’s there to guide me through it!

I’d love to meet people from all walks of life—age, gender, race, etc., don’t matter to me. I truly believe the world thrives on differences. Early on in life, when I was moving around, I often found myself without much of a social circle, so I know how much a group like this can mean.",2,1737635266.0,Manchester_Social,2,0.67,False

Hey there! I'm looking for someone I can vibe with—whether it’s:

* Deep conversations
* Sweet, meaningful moments
* Something a little spicier (SFW, lambingan, or NSFW)

I’d love to find both emotional and physical connection, and I’m open to this being a one-time thing or something more regular depending on how we click. We can go on cute dates, chill and ""tambay"" lang, or just enjoy each other's company however we feel comfortable.

**A little about me:**

* Engineer working from home
* Loves books, podcasts, and movies (I can talk your ear off about my favorites!)
* Gamer on PC and mobile—always up for co-op games or some friendly competition
* Physically active—I’m into solo travel, running, gigs, hiking, sports, and discovering hidden coffee shops
* Slightly obsessed with finding hidden gems and underrated spots around the city

**What I’m looking for in you:**

* Between 23-29 years old
* Single and open to both SFW and NSFW conversations
* Has an active lifestyle or is planning to start one
* Not an apologist
* Short queens are a plus—bonus points if you’re chinita!

Journal of Frater XII of the Esoteric Order of the Other

October 21st, 1993

The hum of the Rust Bucket's engine is a constant, grating buzz against the drumming in my ears. This isn't the usual low thrum of road trip anticipation; it's the high-pitched whine of anxiety, a sound that's become far too familiar these past few days. The meds help, or are supposed to, but lately it's like trying to quell a forest fire with a garden hose.

I initiated the ruse this morning. The Bulletin Board System, bless its digital heart, allowed me to reach Soror XI with some carefully crafted prose. I framed my message as a desperate plea, a confession of impending mental collapse. \[Three-week sabbatical,\] I typed, my fingers clicking against the keyboard in a nervous rhythm. \[Need to…regroup. Reassess. My mind… it feels like a broken radio, tuning into too many frequencies at once.\] I threw in a few dramatic ellipses for good measure.

The truth, of course, is only partially there. Yes, I feel it, the familiar clawing at the edges of my sanity. But it's not the breakdown she imagines, at least not yet. It's the sheer weight of what I've been uncovering, the unnerving puzzle pieces that have been falling into place – or not falling into place – these past days. What I'm feeling is a pressing need to address the situation at hand.

Soror XI, bless her rigid, bureaucratic soul, bought it hook, line, and sinker. She responded immediately, her message a flurry of concern wrapped in her typical clipped tone. \[Jim,\] she wrote. \[Your request is approved. We will air re-runs of your broadcast to maintain the schedule. Focus on your well-being. Really. This time off will do you a world of good.\] That last part was almost gentle, which, coming from her, is practically a hug. A hug that made me feel like a scoundrel for lying- for using my mental illness to manipulate. But I needed this, needed the freedom to move without scrutiny. She's probably relieved, I think, that I seem to have finally dropped the line of questioning pertaining to the previous Saturday's broadcast.

Leaving Scrimbus was like shedding a skin. I packed my faithful Datsun with the usual gear – camera, recording equipment, my expensive laptop with satellite link – and threw in a couple of weeks' worth of supplies. I drove east first, heading towards Anson. I needed to see Manny, needed to have a closer look at those photos that sparked the initial alarm when he called me at four in the damned morning.

The meeting with Manny at the gas station where we first met was brief and tense. He handed me the envelope containing the photos without a word, his eyes darting around like he expected someone to emerge from the shadows. The images were more disturbing up close, particularly the ones on I-35 right outside Waxahachie. The blurred, indistinct symbols, the unnatural distortion of light; all of it reinforced my belief that this was tied into the anomalies that wormed their way into my show. He also had another photo, one of the figure I had seen on my live broadcast, but this one was much clearer, with the distinctive red robes and pointy capriote as plain as could be.

The drive towards Waxahachie felt wrong somehow, a feeling that seemed to gather like static electricity around me. I kept glancing in the rearview mirror, the red-tinted lenses of my spectacles distorting the road and the sky into something vaguely sinister. I stopped at a truck stop in Thurber about halfway, the kind with greasy burgers and stale coffee. I needed to eat and get gas (Hah! Fart joke. Don't judge. I need to find amusement where I can.). The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, a discordant harmony to the anxiety gnawing at my insides. I was just digging into my meal, having applied a generous amount of A1 sauce to my burger when a payphone on the wall next to the john began to ring.

It's for me again. I know it. I hesitated, a strange sense of dread prickling my skin. But the ringing persisted, insistent, and I found myself reaching for the receiver.

""Hello?"" My voice sounded tight, even to my own ears.

A frantic voice crackled on the other end, a voice I recognized immediately. ""Jim, it's Suzie! They're everywhere! NAORC, they're all over Santa Fe! They're like... like cockroaches, crawling all over the place! And... and... "" Her voice broke, a choked sob cutting through the static. ""This has never happened previously; they're everywhere!"" And then the line went dead. Previously, she said... like the unfolding events were a movie she'd seen many times before. Was she watching the director's cut this time?

I stood there, the phone receiver still pressed to my ear, the grease in my fries instantly congealed. New Mexico. NAORC. This wasn't some isolated incident; this was a coordinated movement, a deliberate breach, and Suzie had just confirmed what I feared all along: that this wasn't just about the 'Other' presence. It was something far bigger, something far more insidious. The NAORC were never this bold in the past, usually sticking to their cloak-and-dagger routine. They are tenuous allies to the EOTO, but their goals are, to say the least, sinister.

My heart hammered against my ribs, each beat a frantic drum against the rising tide of panic. I couldn't go to Waxahachie. Not now. I needed to see what was happening in Santa Fe. I needed to meet this mysterious Suzie. I slammed the receiver back into its cradle, my mind racing, calculating. I grabbed my things, my appetite suddenly gone. The greasy burger remained half-eaten on the table, a monument to my abruptly derailed plans.

I was back in the Rust Bucket within minutes, the engine roaring as I tore out of the parking lot, heading west. The road was a blur, the landscape flashing by in a dizzying rush. The anxiety was still there, but it was now laced with a cold, focused rage. My hand tightened around the steering wheel, the ouroboros ring on my right hand feeling like a burning brand. The EOTO had taken me in, given me purpose, and I'll be damned if all they've done for me has gone to waste, even if they secretly knew something was going down.

It was well past sunset when I crossed the state line. The sign read: ""Welcome to New Mexico, Land of Enchantment."" But there was no enchantment here, only a chilling sense of foreboding. As I drove onwards into the vast expanse of the New Mexico dark, I glanced in the rearview mirror. There, for just a fleeting second, was a glimpse of something that made my blood run cold; a red figure, robed and indistinct, standing at the edge of the darkness behind me, its very presence an echo of the chilling image from my broadcast. I could feel its gaze on me, and it sent a shiver down my spine. It could just be a trick of the dim lighting, or the exhaustion of the long drive. But I knew one thing, without a shadow of a doubt; I wasn't alone.

And whatever this 'thing' was, whatever its purpose, had followed me to New Mexico.",1,1737634648.0,stayawake,0,1.0,False

At the core of such a personality is an insatiable curiosity that refuses to be contained by conventional boundaries. Picture someone who walks into a room and immediately transforms the energy – not through loud proclamations, but through a subtle, magnetic presence that hints at deeper layers waiting to be explored. This is the essence of a truly remarkable individual.

Adventure isn't just about physical journeys; it's a state of mind. For the adventurous spirit, life is an ongoing exploration, a continuous process of pushing boundaries and challenging personal limits. It's about seeing the world not as a fixed landscape, but as an infinite canvas of possibilities. Think of those moments when you've stepped outside your comfort zone – maybe it was striking up a conversation with a stranger, learning a new skill, or taking a spontaneous trip to an unknown destination. That's the spirit of adventure.

Artistic sensibility adds another rich dimension to this personality. It's not about being a professional artist, but about seeing the world through a creative lens. Every experience becomes a potential masterpiece – the way light catches a coffee cup, the rhythm of a city street, the intricate dance of human interactions. An artistic personality finds beauty in the mundane, transforms ordinary moments into extraordinary experiences, and approaches life with the same creativity one might apply to painting or composing music.

Intelligence here isn't just about academic achievements or IQ scores. It's a dynamic intelligence that combines critical thinking, emotional depth, and adaptive creativity. This is the kind of intelligence that asks profound questions, connects seemingly unrelated ideas, and approaches challenges with both analytical precision and imaginative thinking. It's the ability to look at a problem and see not just obstacles, but opportunities for innovation and growth.

Creativity flows through this personality like an electric current. It's not confined to traditional artistic expressions but manifests in problem-solving, communication, and approach to life. Imagine someone who can turn a mundane work meeting into an engaging storytelling session, or transform a simple meal into a culinary adventure. Creativity is about seeing potential where others see limitations.

Drive is the engine that propels this extraordinary personality forward. It's not just ambition in the traditional sense, but a deep-seated passion for growth, learning, and making a meaningful impact. This isn't about relentless hustle, but about a genuine commitment to personal and collective progress. It's the difference between merely existing and truly living – between going through the motions and creating ripples of positive change.

Wit adds the sparkling layer of humor and intelligence. It's not about making jokes, but about a quick, sharp understanding of human nature that can turn any situation into an opportunity for insight and laughter. Wit is intelligence in its most playful form – the ability to see the humor in life's complexities, to lighten serious moments, and to connect with others through intelligent, nuanced communication.

These qualities don't exist in isolation. They interact, blend, and create a personality that is greater than the sum of its parts. It's like a sophisticated jazz ensemble, where each instrument (or quality) has its unique voice, but together they create something truly magical.

But here's the beautiful truth – this extraordinary personality isn't some unattainable ideal. It's a potential that exists within each of us. We all have the capacity to cultivate these qualities, to become more adventurous, more creative, more intelligent, more driven. It's about making conscious choices, embracing growth, and refusing to be limited by our current circumstances.

The journey isn't about perfection, but about continuous exploration. It's about being kind to yourself, embracing your unique quirks, and understanding that personal growth is a lifelong adventure. Some days you'll feel like you're firing on all cylinders, and other days you might feel stuck – and that's completely okay.

Ultimately, this extraordinary personality is about authenticity. It's about having the courage to be genuinely, unapologetically yourself – complex, evolving, sometimes messy, but always fascinating.

I’ve been suffering with severe digestive problems for over 2 years. Symptoms consisting of bloating, gas, diarrhea and constipation, malnutrition, anxiety and many more. I had legitimately tried everything. 4 different doctors, 5 different anti fungals and antibiotics. I spent over 1k in doctor visits, medication and supplements. Some supplements suppressed my symptoms, but none of them actually eliminated the problem all together. 

Once I could only eat egg whites and potatoes without feeling bloated to the point I felt like I was going to pop, I switched to a carnivore diet. Switched to eating beef, eggs, butter and bacon and within 3 days I noticed a SIGNIFICANT difference in my symptoms. About 75% of my symptoms were gone and for once I had some sort of relief. After about 3 months my symptoms slowly started to come back, so I knew I had to do something else. I tried more supplements and tried a 5 supplement protocol that I found on this Reddit page. 2 weeks into the protocol I felt great! But once the protocol was done my symptoms came back. I knew I needed to starve whatever was in my body. 

Came across a video on YouTube from Matthew Armstrong where he said he cured his digestive problems with a 12 day fast. It was the fastest video I had ever clicked on lol. I followed exactly what he did and did a bone broth fast (not technically a fast, but still starving the bad bacteria while repairing the gut lining). Video link below 

https://youtu.be/i7t8V_eY3LY?si=wLeDZSYq_QOJz9W5

I drank 32 ounces of store bought bone broth a day, (1 jar lasted me a day, would split it up into 3 portions). About 2 days into the bone broth fast, I began to have rashes 
all over my body, mostly my back and was extremely itchy. This meant that whatever was in my body was dying off rapidly. Instead of doing the 12 days, I ended my bone broth fast after 7 1/2 days, breaking it with 1 hard boiled egg with butter. Waited about 2 hours and had a cup of sauerkraut to add good bacteria back into my gut. A few hours later I had a bowl of vegetable soup ( BEFORE I COULDNT EAT ANY VEGETABLES WITHOUT BEING BLOATED AND IN PAIN FOR OVER 24 HOURS) and after eating the soup I had no bloating, no side effects, and felt great. This was the first time in over 2 years that I had ate something that would normally mess me up and had no problems. Complete game changer. 

I am happy to say that I am back to eating a keto diet consisting of animal based products with light fruit and veg and feel absolutely amazing. I did loose a little bit of fat and muscle during the fast but I’m okay, being that I had a good amount of muscle to start. 

If you want to do this, you first need to see if your in a position to do this. If you are severely malnourished to begin with, this might not be safe for you. Contact your doctor first to get the green light. first get carbs and sugars out of your diet. Next stop drinking coffee. This will help you with headaches during the fast. If you use vapes or smoke, STOP. The nicotine can throw off the PH level in your gut and you won’t make progress. ",3,1737634239.0,SIBO,0,0.8,False
