1gaq821,https://www.reddit.com/r/dutchbros/comments/1gaq821/tipping/,Tipping ,"Hey! I just wanted to share an experience I‚Äôve been having at my local DB lately. I start work at 6 am and have been stopping by Dutch right when they open at 5 am on my work days (about 3-4x a week) and the morning crew at this DB is particularly confrontational with tipping. When I go by this DB in the afternoon, they usually just hand me the iPad and let me fill it out without looking at it but lately the girls at the window have been saying ‚Äúdo you want to add a tip for the crew today?‚Äù And doing the iPad themselves after I pass on tipping. I was just wondering if you guys do this normally or if this is just a thing at my DB. I wanted to put it out there that it makes me feel a bit awkward if im in between paychecks and decide not to tip that dayüòÖ so I would probably advise yall to not do that if that‚Äôs something you do. Especially when my drink is already almost 7$ I rarely ever tip. I recently quit my job at starbucks where I worked for 3 years so I do believe in tipping baristas but in my mind my perspective was always if this person doesn‚Äôt tip someone else will and I never expected people to tip because it‚Äôs a coffee shop not a hair salon or a restaurant.

Casa de Luz equivalent (community center for wellness events)?,"Howdy! Any Austinites who could point me to a place in Portland that is similar to Casa de Luz? For those not familiar: Casa de Luz is a near magical place that is basically a community center for wellness/crunchy hippie shit - really, it‚Äôs more like a campus. It has several spaces for group classes and workshops, such as group breathwork, meditation, tantra, yoga, all kinds of misc other events along these lines. It has a Kava bar and a cacao/coffee shop and a juice bar. It has an apothecary. It also has a vegan restaurant that is partially run by volunteers. It‚Äôs amazing. What I really like and miss about it though is that it‚Äôs a great space for socializing with like-minded folks. People often hang out here between classes or just come to chill. I was really hoping to find something like this in Portland. Any leads? If not, suggestions on where I might find group breath work classes/sessions would be super appreciated. Thanks so much!

1gaq60b,https://www.reddit.com/r/workout/comments/1gaq60b/i_hate_how_some_people_have_assumed_they_know_the/,I hate how some people have assumed they know the most you could achieve naturally without bulking all the time,"I recently found a Facebook video I can't find now. In it this guy shows a really ripped dude, the guy wasn't a genetic freak or some mass monster. He just looked like an average sized dude who you happen could tell might take training seriously. He's like you will never look like this in your entire life unless you have dedication to this that and the other, mainly saying putting on a ton of weight. And it's not that I don't think that being bigger wouldn't make getting bigger easier, I'm talking about already having a ton of weight to spare. It's that he doubts that training itself can take you pretty far training alone, like it's not that if you gained maybe 15lb that it's the gained 15lb that's going to transform your body into a walking tank walking down the street people looking like oh that guy must be built different or something. It's more about the training also, not that gaining 15lb wouldn't help you along the way. But, that guy was straight up acting just like if you don't gain fat specifically no amount of being natural or training would make you look like the guy. 

That guy looked like he must have started out at an average 155lb, and yeah, he probably bulked gaining up to 15lb, maybe 170lb, and in the process he built up to 155lb in lean muscle, then cut down to look, well ripped but still average but with a little more muscle to that enough to say he's at least been making good progress. That guy looked like me, but I can admit, sure, he had a ton more muscle than me, but it's how he looked, like I could look like that, he just had more to make the overall roundness of muscle pop, you know. But I'm 125lb and looking very similar to that. 

Let me just say, it wasn't even that me comparing myself to what he was saying that peeved me off, I wasn't like frustrated enough to even be making a post on that. What pissed me off a little honestly was thinking back about my step dad, bro. 

My step dad, man. God, dude. Lol. 

This man was about 175lb-185lb, honestly I'm thinking 185. 6'4. This man was in his 40's already when I first met him. And you're likely thinking when you hear oh, 185lb, that means must be still quite a bit of fat, no, this man was like me, I swear to God man's been never on a bulk in his life still about 10% bf easy. And that was when I first met him when he was living in Louisiana taking CARE OF HIS FUCKING CHICKENS. 

Oh, bud. I'm only getting started on this man. 

He used to be a drag racer. He could do anything also, construction, this man has built entire buildings by himself, he basically built an entire school building while I was younger, and I swear to God he was still buildings buildings all the way up in 20 years I've known him until the day he could retire, he could still be doing it now. He could do electrician work, he could do welding work, he could do mechanic work. You name it. Like you walk into the kitchen he's  still sitting there holding morning coffee barely paying attention half asleep, and you ask him to describe how to build a car engine, sgmmmm, oh, boy... you can imagine he'll do it in his sleep too. I'm pretty sure he worked and only used being a mechanic as his side hobby his whole life. 

This man. Now if you're wanting to have 20in arms, you know that's something you're probably having to work out your  entire whole life to achieve and like it actually look like pure muscle. This man had his 20in arms easy, no contest. A tricep that looked nasty like the teeth of a chainsaw. Better obliques than me and I don't even see many people who say they take their training seriously who aren't on steroids having better obliques than me really even with me being 125lbs, this man had a obliques like they weren't rocky hills, they were like the rocky mountains of obliques. 

And here's the thing I haven't actually told you about yet. That man only had one leg üòÇ..... holly shit....lol...his whole life. Like you could imagine, what does an average man's leg usually weigh if he's that skinny and doesn't work out? You'd say, 20lb, maybe? He had a prosthetic, that leg was shriveled up like my arms, and the prosthetic probably would have weighed maybe 5lb if that. He was already at a 10lb disadvantage... 

Like, I just think about that now, and I just think, fuck that guy man who's saying you'll never look like this your entire life unless you gain all this fat turning into a blimp first. I'm not mad about it, but fuck that guy. That was just when I first met him and all the time I spent growing up with him, that man probably wasn't even at his heaviest in his entire life when I knew him. ",1,1729730633.0,workout,1,1.0,False

So, I (F, 22) have been on the ""plus-size journey"" for as long as I can remember (yep, even as a kid ‚Äì I was the chubby one rocking the snack packs). Over the past few years, I kind of settled into the ""this is just my life now"" mindset. Spoiler: Not the healthiest mindset, I know.

But since finally breaking free from a semi-toxic household and moving to a whole new state, I‚Äôm starting to see things with more of a long-term lens. And ya know what? I really want to change and I'm ready for it.

I currently juggle two jobs where I‚Äôm on my feet all day, walking, squatting, and getting those steps in. One of my jobs even involves a solid 20-30 minute walk. So, I think it‚Äôs safe to say my endurance isn‚Äôt too shabby. Last time I checked (about a year ago), I was 240 lbs ‚Äì praying I‚Äôm not still there but, fun fact, I don‚Äôt own a scale, so who knows?

Anywhooo... I need some home workout recommendations from y'all fitness gurus out there. I'm mainly trying to target the ol' belly (apron belly vibes here), arms, and back, and build even more endurance.

Also, diet tips, please! I know carbs are probably my frenemy, but do I need to cut them cold turkey, or can I just sneakily reduce them? I typically eat two meals a day (breakfast and dinner) with a couple of snacks in between. Breakfast is usually eggs with turkey bacon or eggs with cheese grits, and dinner is whatever my roommates and I decide to cook (usually something chicken or beef-based from Facebook or TikTok ‚Äì and let‚Äôs be real, probably not the healthiest).

Oh, and I haven‚Äôt touched soda or carbonated drinks for almost 3 years now (victory!), but I do enjoy water, tea, and way-too-sweet coffee for that much-needed energy boost.

Looking forward to hearing your tips! Thanks in advance!",1,1729730603.0,FatBitchFitness,0,1.0,False

1gaq4ga,https://www.reddit.com/r/SameGrassButGreener/comments/1gaq4ga/struggling_to_settle_somewhere/,Struggling to settle somewhere,"I (30F) moved to southeast Florida in early 2023 for a career/industry change. I now do communications for a major company in town and I‚Äôm not just burned out, I‚Äôm literally the charred bits at the bottom of the oven. I feel stuck because I don‚Äôt think I can get another job either locally or remote without taking a major pay cut or enduring even less work-life balance. The job situation has contributed to, though not entirely caused, my lackluster social life: I don‚Äôt have a real friend group ‚Äì my friends are fragmented between work and neighbors, and for a lot of them I‚Äôm an ancillary friend. I also don‚Äôt have a lot of time or energy to do things after work, like volunteer even once or twice a month. Dating has also been rough and I‚Äôm at the age where 1) I want my next boyfriend to be my life partner and 2) significant others are now a default base for your social life.

I have come to terms that I really need somewhere to settle down and plant roots. I‚Äôve moved throughout my 20s (more on that below) and I am craving stability. I really would like this to be my last major move solo.

Here is what I‚Äôm looking for: a place that‚Äôs lower cost of living (or at least easier to save money if I take a pay cut) with access either walking or driving (within 30 minutes) to a downtown or pedestrian area with coffee shops, restaurants, breweries/bars and some sort of cultural events. I‚Äôm okay with not being out past midnight lol. I also need access to nature ‚Äì either parks, conservation trails or the ocean. I‚Äôm looking for communities where there are at least pockets that value intellect and curiosity, but also still fun. I‚Äôd prefer to be East Coast or Eastern half of US, in a blue state or swing state near a blue metro/suburb. I want to get married, but don‚Äôt plan on having kids.

Here‚Äôs my location history based on my age, what I liked and disliked, and my willingness to go back on a scale 1-5.

0-18: Boston suburbs. A lot of my high school classmates still live in the area. I don‚Äôt really have an interest in coming back. 1/5

18-22: Central New York. College years. My college town was kinda eh but the surrounding area has some nice spots ‚Äì definitely some cute neighborhoods and nature trails. Winters are BRUTAL but I think it would be a little different as an adult with a car vs a college student walking around. 3/5

21 (summer): Dallas, Texas. I did an internship there. It was fun and cool to see where I almost went to college. Honestly didn‚Äôt mind the heat then, felt like it was less humid than Florida. Idk if the cost of living now would be much better and it‚Äôs more politically red than Florida imo. 3/5
 
22-25: Central Virginia. I think this is my favorite place I lived. I had a great group of friends and living in the mountains was very picturesque. I think for that period of my life, it felt a bit like extended college living near a college town. But I also had hopes to moving to a big city (move on that). I would definitely need a remote job if I moved back. The biggest drawback is that dating scene was small. 4/5

25-28: Washington, DC. I had dreamed about living in a big city for my career, and DC crushed those dreams. I moved halfway through COVID for a job and it was kinda dumb decision. I wished I moved later since we weren‚Äôt going into the office anyway and save more money. But besides that, while a lot of my friends from Virginia eventually moved here and I met friends of friends, I didn‚Äôt love living in this city. People are really transactional. Crime has gotten really bad where my friends and I lived. Dating was also rough ‚Äì quantity wasn‚Äôt an issue but quality is. 1/5

28-30: South Florida. I‚Äôve already said why I don‚Äôt like living here. I will say I do love the nature and being so close to the beach. 2/5",1,1729730507.0,SameGrassButGreener,0,1.0,False

I have no life, I can‚Äôt go anywhere without him unless my kids are at school so he knows I will come back, and he has actually started to go everywhere with me now even a coffee with my Mam he will tag along just to keep an eye on me. I haven‚Äôt visited a friend or relatives house for at least 4/5 years. I pray for my own freedom but he owns the house and everything basically. 


He has two cars he won‚Äôt drive because he‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt want to. I‚Äôve gotten a learner permit but he is so overbearing I can‚Äôt learn to drive from him he forces me out on to roads shouting and screaming at me while I‚Äôm crying in the car as I have no experience. I want to visit a citizens advice centre but I can‚Äôt even get away from him for a second to do so. He doesn‚Äôt go anywhere ever. He doesn‚Äôt work just stays at home supervising me. I can‚Äôt sleep without him coming to wake me up if I go to bed he will wake me up and ask me to go downstairs to chill with him even tho it‚Äôs really just to get sex from me. 


Every time I have tried to leave, if i manage to get out the door he follows me down the road making a scene but telling me to go back in the house because I‚Äôm the one embarrassing him when I‚Äôm just asking him to let me go for a walk. He is somewhat of a celebrity so holds this over me regularly. I have been suicidal and told him this also expressing to him I just want to visit my mam or go to a psychiatric hospital and he will talk me out of it by telling me I need to just listen to him and I‚Äôll ‚Äúlearn something‚Äù. He‚Äôs afraid I will go to police or get some assistance. He watches everything I do. 



My kids are getting older and are starting to get affected by the constant bad atmosphere. He has always been abusive, I have left him couple of times before but struggled in homeless shelters. Being placed in rooms next to drug addicts with paper thin walls who would be fighting physically at night time and loudly intimate the next while I‚Äôm trying to make noise to not let my very young kids hear them so due to these type of situations I came back. Even when I got a protection order he got one against me and I felt completely victim blamed. So I am afraid that could happen again. 


He has broken so many of my belongings, my phone, my childs Xbox that was really hard to pay for as a Christmas present. My other child‚Äôs phone. Smashed up my kids Lego violently after they just built it on Christmas morning and they were very young (under 6) because they got excited he ruins every Christmas and occasion for us. There is so much he has done not to mention the constant mental pressure he puts on me, I will be in the kitchen cooking dinner with my toddler at my legs, 2 older kids doing homework and he will make jokes about a woman‚Äôs work never being done in such an evil manner. 


I‚Äôm so anxious and nervous I cant look someone in the eye. He has called me the worst names imaginable, hit me, spit on me, belittled me infront of everyone we know that I have just started to shut down so much that I‚Äôm not jealous if he is texting other women I really don‚Äôt care. If he met someone else I would thank god for it. I dont have any savings, I have nothing. Every penny I get I spend on my kids he doesn‚Äôt buy them anything. He owns a lot of expensive things collecting jewellery, collectibles, expensive technology. 


He hates anyone who likes me that doesn‚Äôt come from his side. He won‚Äôt permit me to get a job outside of the house because he says we can‚Äôt afford the travel when he has two cars that he won‚Äôt drive or sell but I‚Äôm not skilled enough for remote work although I‚Äôm doing as many remote courses as I can. He has never bought the kids clothes, shoes and will buy them 1 ir two gifts for Xmas or bday everything else is left to me. He is so narcissistic I feel like it‚Äôs poisoning me. I had high colestorol and pre diabetes so I went vegan to reverse it and he decides to do it too so I am responsible for his whole diet being vegan and all of our meals when he doesn‚Äôt even need to be. 


I have been in domestic violence shelters twice before but he just smear campains me to everyone involved and I just feel so alone. I have to provide him with sex or he will be so toxic toward me and my kids for days after until he gets what he wants. He hates me, I truly believe that. 


I was in full blown labor that he put me in, argueing with me to give him oral sex because the pregnancy ruined his sex life and affected him because he can‚Äôt have sex when he‚Äôs ‚Äúa man‚Äù and should be able to, whenever he wants. 4 hours later my contractions were 4 mins apart so he let me call the ambulance (because he wouldn‚Äôt drive me to hospital) and they told me I was so close to childbirth I needed to sit on the floor and get prepared in case baby came there and then. I had my baby 1 hour after I got to hospital. He arrives at the hospital an hour after that telling me I should ask if I could go home. I had just given birth and I really just wanted to get a break from him but also felt guilty leaving my kids with him. While he is the one who put me into labor, I was 38weeks along and just really didn‚Äôt want to give him oral sex as he made me do every night because I wasn‚Äôt in the mood for the duration of pregnancy so he sat me down and verbally abused me from the kids bedtime till 3am when he finally believed I was in labor. 


Even after contractions got to 4 mins apart he was still angry about the sex thing and acting as if I was putting it on to get attention from him but I just wanted sleep, it was like he was jealous of me going into labor because I would get to interact with people who would treat me like a human. He actually made me lie in bed in the hopes the contractions would stop or something??


Nobody is emotionally safe from him! He ruins every event in my life. He will only mind the kids if I have doctors appointment example I had a cone biopsy done on my cervix due to abnormal cells and he minded the baby but sent his friend to pick me up so I could get home faster as I was having lunch with my Mam after so I had no time basically. 


I have a close relationship with my Mam she is my only friend. Yes, I don‚Äôt have 1 other friend. We have always loved Christmas since I was a kid. Myself, her and my sister matching pyjamas ect. I haven‚Äôt seen her for Christmas for 12 years. I cook Christmas dinner every year and eat it alone as he doesn‚Äôt like my dinners and my kids just retreat to their rooms away from him as he is so mean every Christmas. He makes us all stay home every Christmas and threatens the kids to take their presents away if they get a bit excited or raise their voice and sometimes will break their presents as I previously mentioned. 


I can‚Äôt, I really just can‚Äôt. I‚Äôm in bits literally. Some days I have dark dark thoughts. I try to understand his side considering I was a bit wild when I was younger and have had issues but i have stopped everything I don‚Äôt drink, socialise, go anywhere, do anything and haven‚Äôt for years, only look after him and the kids. I can‚Äôt. Please god help me. I‚Äôm suffering so bad. As I‚Äôm writing this he has came into the room and tried to wake the baby to get me out of bed. It‚Äôs so draining. I have expressed to him at least 20 times that I don‚Äôt love him anymore and don‚Äôt want to be with him and that I will seek legal advice if he doesn‚Äôt let me do what I want to do. He just forces me into a sometimes 10 hour long conversation of pure and utter manipulation and belittling until I get to a point where I‚Äôm so mentally exhausted I give in, and then he does this weird thing we‚Äôre he will make me say say sorry, like actually say the words I‚Äôm sorry. Then he‚Äôll say it not sincere enough. He‚Äôll say ‚ÄúI deserve an apology for this, I won‚Äôt be able to relax now until I know you‚Äôre gonna go back to being normal, take that look off your face and tell me you love me‚Äù. I‚Äôll be just looking at him like, ‚Äú you want me to fake love you‚Äù. And the answer is yes, but he‚Äôs so unhinged he actually is soothed from the ‚Äúfake apology and fake love‚Äù. 


I‚Äôll be walking around the house feeling suicidal pale as a ghost barely keeping it together and he‚Äôll be like, do you wanna come in and sit with me in the room? Where he will put on his shows about collectibles that I have no interest in and it pains me to watch them. 


I have had a couple of nervous breakdowns over the years where I have slapped him and completely freaked out shouting for help and crying but he has found a way to make me think I am abusive because of this, when I know it‚Äôs a fight or flight defence mechanism. But it has messed with my head and made me think I am at fault somehow or that he has something on me. He won‚Äôt allow me to get medical attention or any kind of assistance from the outside world. 


I‚Äôm scarred talking to any authority figure teachers guards or anyone really because I feel like they will blame me for staying so long but I really do want to go but I have NOWHERE. My Mam has a two bedroom very small house who she shares with my mentally disabled sister and Stepdad. They also have their own issues which means even if I went there it would be awful for them as my kids are big now well two of them are and I have a toddler.  


I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôm afraid he has the power to counteract anything I do, like no matter where I run to or who I tell he will fuck it up for me. I‚Äôm so scared to make a move. Please help? any advice would be appreciated.  ",2,1729729931.0,relationship_advice,0,1.0,False

She is very caring and attentive, we have many interests in common, we talk almost everyday and we laugh a lot when we are together. I really enjoy spending time with her and I know she likes me too.

However, there's one major thing holding me back: she never worked once in her life. She lives with her mom and she buys everything for her. She gives her money for food, cabs, coffee, college stuff, etc. She's buying expensive stuff all the time, for example we practice a sport in which you can buy decent starter gear for around $150, but she bought one that's worth $800 because ""my mom buys it for me"" (in my country that's more than a month's salary for most people, it's a lot of money). She is studying for a university degree but has about 2-3 years left to finish it and she won't start looking for a job until she's graduated.

I'm also studying but I have a full time job and it would never cross my mind to ask my parents to buy such expensive things for me. I feel like everytime she buys a gift or something for me it's actually her mom buying it. Aside from this I think we could be a good couple, but I don't know if I want to date someone who is in her 30s and can't buy her own stuff

The conversation kind of faded out and at first I thought he lost interest, but maybe it was also my fault, I can never tell. He is now very busy and travelling for work anyways, but it was a few weeks of never missing out a day of texting coming to a stop.

(door opens)

Well now. My divination spell said a stranger would be arriving at my door, but it didn‚Äôt say he‚Äôd be cute!

Come in, come in, let‚Äôs get you out of the cold. You must have traveled a long way, carrying all that equipment.

An adventurer, huh? That explains it. My, you must be tired.

Sit by the fire, won‚Äôt you? Rest a moment. I‚Äôll put the kettle on.

Coffee or tea?

Oh, I know what you‚Äôre here for. And I can give it to you. But not until you‚Äôre warmed up, hm?

Now, coffee or tea?

Of course. Make yourself comfortable, it‚Äôll be just a few minutes.

(drink pouring)

Now, tell me who has wronged you, and we‚Äôll see if I can‚Äôt help.

How did I know? \*chuckle\* No one comes to my door this late at night looking for a simple charm. And I‚Äôm the only witch for miles around that deals in curses.

You needn‚Äôt be shy about saying it. I have no shame in what I do.

Still you look at me so strangely. Did you expect someone selling dark magic to look different? A terrifying occultist, living in a haunted house? Or maybe an evil old hag, hexing children and eating frogs? \*chuckle\*

You needn‚Äôt flatter me, hon. I‚Äôm not going to bewitch you if you upset me.

Ah, I see. Others have warned you about me. \*sigh\* I wish I could say I was surprised.

My fellow witches‚Ä¶they mean well, truly. They see what I do as dangerous, and they want to protect people from that danger. It‚Äôs noble, in intention at least.

But gods, they can be naive. They think that light magic can only do good, and dark magic can only do bad, when the truth is so much more complicated. A knife can chop vegetables or carve wood just as well as it can slice a throat, do you understand? Tools are not good or evil, they simply do what we use them for.

And I‚Äôm a woman that understands certain‚Ä¶darker desires. Justice does not always come when we ask it to, does it? Sometimes we have to take things into our own hands. We have to punish those who deserve it.

Tell me, adventurer, do you deserve to be punished?

\*giggle\* I‚Äôm sorry, I can‚Äôt help it. Folk like you are so fun to tease.

But enough of my babbling. I‚Äôd like to help you, but you must know I don‚Äôt cast magic on a whim. If you want a curse, you‚Äôll need to explain why.

I know. Pain can be difficult to speak of when it‚Äôs still fresh. Take your time, and I‚Äôll listen. I promise you I‚Äôve heard worse.

A fellow adventurer? You must have spent a lot of time together. And she is the cause of your sorrow?

Mmm. Mhm.

Ah, heartbreak. She left you, then?

Oh my. She was with another? For how long?

Oh, I‚Äôm so sorry. That‚Äôs a terrible betrayal. To be lied to for so long‚Ä¶the realization must have been agony.

And she ran off to her other lover? Lived happily ever after, while you picked up the pieces?

She blamed you for the affair! Nonsense. I can see you‚Äôre a gentle soul, and we‚Äôve hardly even met. And you‚Äôre adorable! How could anyone say such a cruel thing to your sweet face?

Well, that‚Äôs quite the tale. And I can see the hurt in your eyes, even now. The rage. You‚Äôre being truthful, that‚Äôs clear to me.

I understand why you came to me now. Love is a sacred connection. To break it as your former lover did, so carelessly, so cruelly‚Ä¶it is a wicked act. One worthy of punishment.

Very well. I‚Äôll cast your curse. Let us ensure this woman learns her lesson, and may she think twice before harming someone again.

My price? Don‚Äôt worry about that just yet. Let‚Äôs make sure I can accomplish what you‚Äôre asking first.

Don‚Äôt worry. I would never ask for more than you are willing to give. \*laugh\* What, did you think I was going to request your firstborn, or something like that?

No, gold will do fine. If you don‚Äôt have that, well you‚Äôre an adventurer, aren‚Äôt you? I‚Äôm sure I could have you perform some service in exchange. But as I said, it can wait for now. Would you mind grabbing the green tome off that shelf for me? The one with the silver inlaid on the cover.

Thank you.

(page turning)

Let‚Äôs see‚Ä¶now, normally for a curse, especially a powerful one, we need something to direct our intent towards the victim. A lock of hair, a fingernail, an item of clothing. I don‚Äôt suppose you have anything like that?

I thought not. No need to worry. There‚Äôs another way. I just need to find the right ritual.

Mm. Mhm. Ah, here we are. A curse of binding. This is exactly what we need. And the wording‚Ä¶ ‚Äúto curse your greatest enemy‚Äù. Perfect.

Well, no time like the present. I‚Äôll prepare for the ritual if you‚Äôre ready.

Good, good. If I point out ingredients to you, would you be able to fetch them for me? I need to get the cauldron boiling.

(fire crackling)

Wonderful. And feel free to take a look at the page I have marked. See the details of the curse for yourself.

Ah, yes, my apologies. I forget that my shorthand is illegible to most. Don‚Äôt worry, I can explain. It‚Äôs a simple spell, but quite powerful. Essentially, it will bind your former lover to me. I‚Äôll have control over her psyche, to a certain extent. With a simple incantation I‚Äôll be able to cause her illness, or send her nightmares. I‚Äôll make her think of you each time she has a moment‚Äôs peace, so that she never forgets what she‚Äôs done to you.

What do you think? A suitable punishment, yes? Of course, its power will wane over the seasons, but if you think she hasn‚Äôt learned her lesson, we could reapply it.

Alright, the cauldron is boiling. I have everything I need. We can cast as soon as you‚Äôd like.

Oh yes, we. Without something from her, I will need you to guide me so the spell hits the correct target. It‚Äôs very specific about that‚Äîthis curse is designed to harm your greatest enemy, and no other.

I don‚Äôt suppose you have some other, horrible nemesis I should know about?

Good, good. Now, take my hand.

Don‚Äôt be nervous, I don‚Äôt bite.

Now, as I cast the spell, I need you to focus on her. On your greatest enemy. Recall the anger in her betrayal, the hurt. Let it flow out of you and go to her.

Don‚Äôt worry, you‚Äôre doing fine. Just close your eyes, and focus.

(magic sounds? Whatever feels right)

See? Not terrifying at all. No need for dramatic, flashy spellcasting when you have a mastery of the basics. Now all we need is a little test run. Shall we start with, say, a piercing headache? Should be easy.

(snap) And that should be it!

Hmm

That‚Äôs‚Ä¶odd. I didn‚Äôt feel anything. I should be able to sense a bond between us, no matter how far she is‚Ä¶

(snapping)

I don‚Äôt understand. That should have worked. Every detail was correct! I never fail in casting a spell, I‚Äî

‚ÄîAre you alright? You look as though you‚Äôre‚Ä¶in‚Ä¶pain‚Ä¶

Oh, no. No no no. Why is the curse attached to you? That doesn‚Äôt make any sense!

(Frantic page flipping)

We did everything right, there‚Äôs no reason for you to be the target of the binding. Right here, ‚Äúthe spell will land on your greatest enemy‚Äù! There‚Äôs no reason that would be you, unless‚Ä¶

Unless.

You blame yourself for it all, don‚Äôt you? Her lies got to your head.

I understand now. That‚Äôs what went wrong. The one you consider your greatest enemy isn‚Äôt her. It‚Äôs you.

Oh, hon. Oh, oh oh. I‚Äôm so sorry. Oh, come here, it‚Äôs alright.

Here, I should be able to get rid of that headache. (snap)

Better?

That‚Äôs one problem solved, at least. But‚Ä¶the curse still binds us. If I‚Äôm not careful, I‚Äôll hurt you without meaning to. One wrong word, and I could make you sick, or worse!

I‚Ä¶I‚Äôm sorry to say I‚Äôm much better at casting spells than breaking them. I have no idea how to free you without waiting months.

No, no, please don‚Äôt panic. Nothing bad will happen to you, I promise. I‚Äôm still in control here, and I wouldn‚Äôt dream of causing you more pain. I can be careful. And I promise I‚Äôll figure out a way to break this bond, I just need some time. In the meantime, I‚Äôm not letting you out of my sight.

Absolutely not. I won‚Äôt have you getting into any more trouble. This situation is my fault anyways, the least I can do is take care of you while I fix it. You‚Äôll stay here and let me feed and house you until you‚Äôre better.

I suppose it‚Äôs not all bad, anyways. I haven‚Äôt had another person around the house in a long time, much less a handsome boy like you. Perhaps we could be friends, once I fix my mistake.

You‚Äôre too kind. You ought to have more faith in yourself, you know? I can‚Äôt believe you really think any of your misfortunes are your fault. Poor thing.

Not to worry. I‚Äôll take care of you. Follow me, I have a spare room you can stay in. The gods know it‚Äôs late enough already.

I 24F recently got out of a 4 year relationship with my ex boyfriend 28M let's call him Chad (not his real name), Chad and I split up a couple of months  ago because we both fell out of love and over the next few weeks I was going through my breakup faze, crying, eating icecream, ranting and raving to  who I thought was a bestfriend 26F let's name her Shawna (not her real name)

A couple of weeks ago Shawna called me and asked to talk to me in person about something serious and that she wanted us to get some coffee, I said yes and we went to our favourite coffee shop and when we sat down she looked at me with teary eyes and confessed she slept with Chad for 2 years of the relationship and wanted to come clean because she knew Chad was a shithole. 

I gasped and asked her if she had any texts she could show of them messaging and she looked confused and that's when I confessed that I had known for a bit but didn't want to ruin my friendship with her because she was my ride or die. Shawna showed me her phone allowing me go through everything and I screenshotted and sent them to my phone and Shawna asked why I was sending them to myself, I told her that Chad's mother very catholic and against cheating and abuse to woman, Shawna knew what I had planned and smiled.

The next day I printed out EVERY screenshot I had of Chad cheating on me and photo evidence of Chad's abuse to me leaving me with bruises everywhere and posted them to Chad's mother with a letter saying that, I wished her all the best with her life and that she was free to call me at any time to chat but that she needed to put her son in the doghouse for being the reason I'm now in Therapy for being a people pleaser.

I spoke to Shawna yesterday morning and she said she was so sorry about the cheating and would understand if I didn't want to be her friend, I told her she lost my respect for her and I wouldn't forget right away but she is still my friend and I wouldn't lose her because of just a stupid mistake.

**The Good**

I received the 1L bottles of Glacial and Spring, and the bottles themselves are very nice. I will be reusing them for various purposes, to travel with water, make cold water in the refrigerator, whatever. 

I've had the opportunity to brew with both waters, and every cup has been excellent. Zero challenges making tasty cups across \~ 10 cups of coffee.

**The Neutral**

I typically brew with Seattle tap water that has been filtered through a dual-stage carbon filter. This is convenient and inexpensive because I can just turn on the filter tap and have water on demand. Comparing coffee from my filtered tap with the brew water, to be honest the differences are subtle at least to my palette. I haven't had a chance to triangle test, but I think the coffee made with brew water to be very slightly more vibrant than with my filtered tap.

I count myself fortunate that Seattle tap water is of good enough quality me, and don't plan to purchase brew water on an ongoing basis from anyone. I've also tried Third Wave Water, and did not find it to be transformative in some way at least for me.

""I am sorry, but I need to cancel my medical appointment... I can't have my medical condition block me from working as a soldier... etc etc"".

She told me to suck up to the high ups so that I can have good impression to them, regardless of my condition. 

Before I even went to the army, I had to do a online questionnaire done. There were questions such as ""are you feeling depressed?"" "" did you feel like you wanted to suicide?"" I chose based on how I felt, but my mother was glaring behind my back, telling me to choose everything as ""I am doing great"" because she thinks nothing good will come to me by showing my issues.

Since they combined multiple ingredients into one called the blend they artificially pushed sugar down the list. Good job guys! I just drank a ton of sugar.

On the last day when I actually had 3 20mg capsules somehow, I debated if it was worth trying 60 (3x20) because the idea of having 40mg then 20mg the next day felt a bit pointless.

It was basically a ""test"" to see if I was ok on a higher dose. Having only one day of 60mg before my prescription ran out was better than risking having a whole month of 60, only to have it be too much, or cause side effects that I didn't like, and then not having my regular lower dose to fall back on (my doctor is extremely difficult to get a reach of which is why I'm looking for a new doctor).

Luckily it was pretty clear sailing for the most part, except for about an hour in the morning (3-4 hours after taking it) where I started to feel a bit uncomfortable and anxious. I WAS driving in peak traffic so that could have been a factor, and after 2 hours I was back to ""normal""|

Fast forward to this month, I read that there was going to be a shortage of 40mg and 50mg so decided to see how 60mg would go and get ahead of any shortages (because that was a nightmare trying to find a chemist that had my dosage it in stock for half a year)

I try to take my meds at 7am, 8am at the latest because I want the effects to be ready by 9am and 10am feels a bit late.

Saturday and Sunday felt normal, no major changes except just more alertness and no real tiredness that I started to feel at 3pm on the previous dose.   
Monday was normal, except for the morning where I started to feel anxious, like I had too much coffee. That wore off after half an hour and then I was back to normal (I did have a weak coffee that morning half an hour before the anxiousness).

Tuesday and Wednesday were fine, no anxiety (had coffee on both days, but only weak).

Today at about 10am after doing the dishes, some organizing and cleaning, I started to feel anxious again, borderline panic. I did have 1 coffee in the morning with my wife so maybe it was that. Needed to sit down, drink some water, meditate, turn off the tv, needed to put the fan on, and sat there for about half an hour trying not to think about the feeling of tenseness, distracting my mind, only focusing on my breathing rather than my thinking, and about 20 minutes ago felt back to normal again. So this ""anxiety"" lasted maybe half an hour - 45 minutes. It kind of felt like I'd done too much without taking a break or having too much coffee.

I may have to just stop having my morning coffee (it's pretty weak, I mostly have it for taste) but wanted to see if others have had this? I'll see how I go the next week or 2 without coffee, that is after all the point of trying meds, and then speaking to the psychiatrist to see what they think and decide if we go back to 50mg. It just felt like 50mg wasn't quite enough without needing a few coffees through the day (4 a day to feel ""normal""). If this only an occasional thing then I can handle that, but it would be annoying if it's a regular common thing. I don't drink coffee throughout the day other than 1 in the morning on this dose, so my gut says it's just the coffee and that I don't need my morning coffee anymore.

I moved to the UK to pursue my masters and in hopes of changing both my industry (from Software to Banking) and geography. I finished my masters at a target school which is highly regarded within the sector but my degree is in Management and is not taken seriously. I have perfect grades in both my masters and undergraduate schools and have not laid idle for a moment in my life, with me always working on projects and building my skillset through courses and work experience. 

Coming to what I don‚Äôt have: 
I don‚Äôt have full time work experience and have only done internships and  freelancing in the past. None of my work experiences are in large firms (except for one but it‚Äôs more so focussed on consulting for a large firm retail). I don‚Äôt find myself applying for software roles anymore as I‚Äôve not worked on any recent projects and neither do I have the kind of coding expertise I once did. 

My visa situation:
I can take up the Graduate Visa which will allow me to work till December 2026 in the UK without sponsorship. I cannot apply for summer internship programmes which take up the majority of applications as I‚Äôm not a penultimate year student. I‚Äôve also noticed most of these internships convert into the graduate schemes which leaves little room for direct applicants. 

My strategy so far:
Knowing what I have and what I lack, I‚Äôve focused on roles with the best fit leveraging both my passion for banking and a certain level of expertise in coding. I have perfected my resume and cover letter templates as much as possible for the sector so I don‚Äôt lose out in the screening process.

At the very least, I hope it's entertaining.

Pre-Bar Studying:

I started studying for the exam full time 4 months before with Themis. From the early Contracts lessons, I felt pretty hopeless. I had no mental flowchart to understand the arc of the law. Themis also gave a quiz very early on, and taking that quiz was the first of many times I thought ""I am going to fail this exam"".

Because of my fear and frustration, I re-listened to the contracts lectures another 2 or 3 times on 1.5x or 2x the speed. There were times that I felt like I was absorbing the material that I was listening to, but it didn't feel like it was sticking. Looking back, the reviews probably did help, but I think what is actually more helpful is a spaced repetition pattern of learn, test, review and test again.

When I finally started to feel like I was understanding the basics of contracts after I think a week or 2, Themis started throwing more things at me and multiple things at once. This was another point in the process where I thought ""If this exam was only Contracts, maybe, MAYBE, I could pass. But I can't learn everything."" I stuck with it though, with the same pattern that I had done in Contracts of fear and feelings of failure, followed by a complete review and re-review of the audio. I also started to review my outlines again, especially the final review and MEE outlines since the lecture outlines are just a meandering series of stream of consciousness (sort of like this post).

I followed this pattern for weeks, and then Themis started throwing in MPTs. This was yet another ""I can't do all this"" moment. This was an entire skill I had to learn and master.

Over the course of months, I spent time in the jumbled Themis schedule trying desperately to stay on track. I did eventually have to take days off starting around the one month mark for my mental health, but then I'd remind myself that there wasn't much time. What really got to me during these months was the MEE practice. I felt like I knew absolutely nothing. However, one of the things I did do was I did the MEEs from memory from the beginning. No ""open book"". I would study the outline of the subject, then go into the MEE cold and try to answer using an IRAC structure. I also spent a lot of time reviewing the model MEE answers. This was eventually helpful because the MEEs have repeated themes, and one of the Themis model answers was particularly helpful for the exams. In fact, of anything Themis actually helps with, I would say it was the MEEs.

Eventually, Themis got to giving UWorld practice questions, and one of the things I immediately thought was ""I wish I had done these sooner"". As I mentioned - learn, test, review, test again. If I had done even 5 or 10 questions a day from the beginning when I was studying each subject, then doing them toward the end would have felt more like a review instead of a realization about how fucked for the exam I was.

At a certain point, and again something I wish I had done earlier, I also bought GoatBarPrep. I think Themis and Goat complemented each other nicely. Themis gave me the organized structure of the law, and Goat kept me from sinking into a deep depression and made studying funny. While his lessons are unhinged, there are specific instances of questions I read during reviewing his lectures that got me actual questions correct on the MBE. If Themis was the broad overview, Goat was the frying pan over the head saying ""If you see this scenario, pick this answer."" If I were reviewing for the bar again, and I had 6 months, I'd probably start reading the GOAT modules early on.

Toward the exam, I started to get really anxious. Every time I learned something new, it felt like I unlearned two things I had learned previously. Yet another time where I thought ""This is simply too much and I am going to fail."" But I was too deep in to quit. I did however start to take noticeably more mental health days. I once took 4 days off in a row out of pure exhaustion. 

Finally, finally toward the end, I could see areas of law starting to crystallize. Jurisdiction started making sense. Contracts made sense. Hell even Family Law made sense. Evidence maybe never did. I also started amplifying my practice exams. The last two weeks, I was doing around 50 questions on UWorld a day. I won't claim I went back and read ""even the right answers"" since I don't have whatever Hermione used to repeat her days in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, I did at least make an honest effort to review my wrong answers.

Looking back, as I said I wish I had started UWorld earlier and had done 5 to 10 questions a week per MBE subject until I had gotten through all the MBE subjects, and THEN started doing mixed tests of 50 at a time. I am grateful of the work I did doing the Themis MEE reviews and particularly reading the model answers. I wish I had read the GOAT modules earlier. I am glad I read and reread the final review outlines and MEE outlines on Themis. I am glad I spent time trying to at least learn the broad structures and the arcs of the law. And I am grateful I at least did half the recommended MPT practices, although the timing structure they give is unrealistic.

Exam Day 1:

I got to the exam center not knowing what to expect. On the subway ride, there were 2 very stressed out girls rapid fire listing rule statements. 

""Oh fuck I didn't remember that one"".

I'm glad I arrived as early as I did, because I forgot how Type A law students are. Everyone arrived early. I at least got in with enough time to get to my seat, get settled in, and have a panic attack.

First Session - the MPTs:

Who was it that said that everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face? Yea, that guy took the bar I'm pretty sure. 

Themis tells you to spend x amount of time reading, x amount of time outlining, and x amount of time writing, but on exam day you can forget about the time outlining. Not realistic. I do support their strategy to read the task, then laws and cases, then facts. This helped. But after you do that, it's pretty much time to start writing. I remember looking at the clock and thinking that it might be broken. How did reading take 40 minutes? Lesson to future takers: add in a few extra minutes to panic and have to talk yourself down.

As I started writing, I did feel it was possible to put something pretty organized together without outlining and just YOLOing directly since I had practiced some MPTs. One thing to note, this isn't the time to be a gunner and try to get a clerk position at SCOTUS. Hit the basic arguments. Then make it look pretty format and header wise. THEN go back through and see where the arguments can be super duper good.

I barely had enough time to finish both MPTs using the above strategy for each, and evenly splitting the time between each.

Session 2: The MEEs

After the MPTs I was actually feeling sort of ok. The MPTs were my most dreaded subject, and the bar was actually kind of ok testing them.

So imagine my surprise when I opened my MEE booklet when time was called to read an MEE designed by someone who has dedicated their life to destroying bar examinees and had apparently sworn an undying hatred toward us. I remember thinking ""What the actual fuck is this nonsense?"" Like seriously, the facts made no sense and seemed like someone got AI drunk. I couldn't tell if the test was smart and I was stupid, or vice versa. I did think how fucking badly I hated the whole bar exam at that point.

Ok, 5 minutes down, nothing written. I talked myself into getting going. And surprisingly, I remembered a sprinkle of a rule here. A sprinkle of a concept there. Was I making up what the rule was named? Absolutely. Was it at least ""minimum competency""? I sure fucking hoped so.

One thing that struck me at the end of the first MEE was that there were at least hints of what the bar examiners wanted. Themis had told me to work the facts more in my graded MEE review, and finally on exam day I sort of got what they meant. One of my law professors used to say: ""If you're weak on the facts, pound on the law. If you're weak on the law, pound on the facts. And if you're weak on both, pound on the table.""

Well I pounded on those fucking facts. You like that facts? 

Sorry.

Anyways, it's true. You can work the facts to back into a rule. And I did that.

After that, the majority of the MEEs were relatively straightforward. And by relatively I mean 2 of the 3 subparts of each them was a pretty straightforward rule statement and analysis. However, a few of them did one subpart where the psychopathic author of the first MEE decided to make a guest appearance. I remember being mad that they would test on such a small footnote area of the law for one of them. I guess torturing us with learning 80 different bodies of law wasn't enough.

I answered the MEEs very formulaically:

The issue is [restatement of the sub question].

The rule is [desperate attempt to correctly state a rule statement].

The rule is [met/not met] because [copy pasted facts (yes, actually do this)] followed by an actual analysis that surprisingly counts for very little of the writing.

Therefore/In conclusion, the rule is [met/not met] (yes I actually repeated the analysis and conclusion, these blend) and the issue is answered [thusly].

Very, very formulaic.

As mentioned, Themis does the best at getting you ready for the MEEs, particularly reading the model answers. Try to get a feel for the exact structure of the model answers. Don't get too caught up in Themis's unrealistic statements of the rule statements in them though. Your rule statements will be 69% crappier, but so will everyone's. Just try to focus on the structure of the answers of each subpart.

That doesn't mean you don't have to memorize rule statements. You do. There isn't a way around that, especially for the ""easy"" MEE topics. You can't just make everything up. But you can sort of make some things up in order to fill in where your knowledge isn't 100%. Also, if you don't know the rule, then yes, make something up and IRAC. I did and many others have. 

On exam day I felt like I did relatively well on 3 MEEs, sort of did the best I could on 2, and fuck the first one. 

GOAT always said ""On Day 1, just try to do well enough to stay in the game."" I can't say leaving the exam I felt totally confident I had done that, but I also didn't feel like I got an F. I remember on the subway ride home thinking ""There is at least a chance I got a 66% on those"", and trying to map out in my mind how an average score would work ""Ok if I got a 5,5,5,3,3, and 1, then that's almost an average score of 4.... ok then maybe I got a 6,5,5,3,3,1.... but what if I got a 3,3,3,3,3,1?"" and so on my conversation with myself went. Luckily I live in New York and no one was shocked by this behavior on the subway.

Exam Day 2 - The MBEs:

Before the exam, I had felt probably the best about the MBEs. I was averaging around a 70% on UWorld, which I actually didn't know what pretty good (protip: If you ask reddit if 70% is good, prepare to be called a douche). ""Whatever you do, however bad the exam feels, just make sure to come back on Day 2 and do the MBEs"".

Well, Day 2 I came back, earlier than Day 1, and fuck me if everyone else didn't also arrive earlier. I did have the thought that I'd study in line a little, and review some of the wrong UWorld questions, but I ended up behind someone who told me ""If we don't know it now we never will"", and I got too embarrassed. 

By Day 2, the other stressed out test takers, the security procedures, your seat, the clocks, it isn't all brand new. You're not a starry-eyed bar examinee. Instead, you are dead inside and running off a combined total of 6 hours of sleep between 2 nights but you didn't drink coffee in case it gave you diarrhea on the subway ride to the exam.

Same as Day 1, I got to my seat early, and since I could not for the life of me find a pencil sharpener the night before in my house, pulled out my 50 sharpened pencils and prayed to all of my dead relatives who I thought owed me favors that 50 would be enough to get me through the MBEs. Oh, also, you DO NOT have to bring your computer the second day. I got paranoid and brought mine. 

MBEs Session 1:

Now I'm staring at the clock and hearing the proctor count down to what feels like an event of me shitting myself. 5 minutes. 2 minutes. 30 seconds. Test starts and I open the book.

At least the questions felt familiar at first, but my strategy of feeling confident about 3 out of every 4 has turned into feeling grateful when I know the answer to 1 out of every 6. Seriously. Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck. This can't be real. I am guessing on wayyyyy too many of these. Like seriously. I studied just to come and guess? Fucking seriously? SERIOUSLY?!!!! 4 MONTHS OF MY LIFE GONE SO I CAN JUST DO WHAT I WOULD HAVE DONE IN THE DAMN FIRST PLACE WITHOUT STUDYING???

Ok, calm down. Breathe. Some of these look familiar. Yes I know that one. Ok I know that one too. Wait I know that one. Ok why are all the answers B? Like, they are all B??

This continued until I had gotten through the questions. Surprisingly, I ended up finishing the first round an hour early. I'm usually a go hand in the test I finish early and leave type of a person, but the bar seems as good a time as any to actually go back and review my questions. So now I'm flipping back though this damn book and checking my questions. And you know what? Maybe I did guess, but these answers aren't half bad. They may not be half good either, but actually reviewing them I feel like, ok, I had a reason for picking the choice I did.

I manage to get through all the questions and even end up changing a few. I know, I know, don't change them, but I am relatively satisfied with my choices.

MBEs Session 2:

Similar vibes to the first MBE. Again, why am I literally just guessing right now? Like this is just me here guessing. Also, some of these questions are written in what feels like Martian. Seriously I feel like the exam is now just a lab experiment, and I'm the lab rat. Maybe these are experimental questions. Maybe not. Keep guessing.

Toward the end of the second session, everything went blank in my mind. I lost myself and time and space no longer existed. I was one with the exam center. Ok snap out of it. Fucking focus. This is the exam. This IS the EXAM!

I managed to somehow finish my test, and I had 50 minutes left, so i also went back for a review. This time I ended up changing maybe 10 answers, and one I inexplicably marked completely wrong which was probably during the time I had achieved Nirvana. I felt a lot less confident about my answers.

Leaving the exam, I did exactly what you shouldn't do. I immediately started googling shit. I immediately started asking Chat GPT to train me on the law. I felt about 50/50 walking out. I remember thinking ""I could definitely see myself having failed that"". It was overall much more difficult than I was expecting.

I spent the next month hyper anxious and randomly recalling MBE questions and checking answers. Eventually, I have compiled a list of what I got right, wrong, and maybe. I do not recommend doing this. It didn't help.

I also started having bad nightmares. I didn't wake up in time for the exam. I got my score back and failed. They randomly lost my exam. Random dreams like this.

Waiting was excruciating. While this subreddit can be pretty damn funny sometimes, it also killed me to see people describe their exam experiences and their mindsets. I couldn't help trying to compare how I felt. I saw people who thought they passed and failed. I saw stories of people who felt confident about passing and passed. I saw very few stories of people who felt like me, felt they might have failed, and ended up passing. The more time that passed after the exam, the worse I felt. Anecdotally, people with similar experiences with me were coming on here and reporting that they didn't pass. It ate at me and I felt anxious having to tell people that I didn't pass. I tried to exercise and I drank more than I should have. 

Finally, we got to October, and the rest is the stuff of history, myth and legend. 

There were rumors of a mythical gray address bar, and rumors of NY BOLE telling people the address bar was going gray. There was infighting. There were memes. And there was a lot of self doubt. A lot. I was about 70/30 that I failed by this point.

The prophecy of the gray address bar was finally fulfilled, and that night I also learned of the NY Courts hack to see the exam results early based on error message tea leaves that turned out surprisingly to be true. 

Results came at 1 am, and based on the gray address bar and people literally registering early and getting an attorney ID, I woke up at 2 am and checked.

Final score:

UBE: 323

MBE: 159.5 (which i guess makes the essays a 163.5).

Hair and weight loss and blood pressure points added: A veritable fuck ton.

Memes posted: 15

I hope reading this experience helps future takers in some small way. 

This exam sucks. 

I have no idea why I did well and others didn't. This isn't a team sport sadly. I know I worked and studied harder for this than for anything I have ever done in my entire life, but I know that others also did and didn't quite get there this time.

I guess if I have one parting word of advice, it's to not beat yourself up too much, and not to obsess about things out of your control. Take the test seriously. Study hard. Study as hard as you can. And try to learn and internalize. But take pride in having made it this far.

If you passed and came back to read this: Congratulations!

And if you didn't pass, just remember: You didn't pass YET.

But one thing I realised only recently when my daughter pointed it out.  It had just never occurred to me.  So my brother bullied me throughout my childhood.  When I started to walk as a toddler, he pushed me over, delaying my walking.  I was his punching bag for most of my life.  When he killed himself last year after setting a building alight and trying to kill everyone in it, it was actually a relief.  (He didn't kill anyone or destroy the building).  Brother was a psycho.  So here is where it gets interesting.  A few years ago my mother mentioned that every time she went out and left me alone, she was terrified that she would come back and find me dead.  My daughter said to me but wasn't she an at-home mum - yes, so why did she need to leave me alone so often?  Coffee?  Mum has always loved to lunch with the ladies.  Why did she never take me with her for my safety?  Who would leave their child at home when their brother was diagnosed as a sociopath with no sense of empathy.  I took my kids everywhere with me.  Looking back, I'm staggered that it never dawned on me.  I'm sure if I were to ask her, she'd talk about the stress of parenting and needing a break etc.  My mother has a remarkable way of turning herself into the victim in every circumstance.

I still remember the very first novel I read was Andai Itu Takdirnya by Siti Rosmizah, which I borrowed from my mom when I was 9. Couldn't remember what comes next, but the next one I could remember was the original The Jungle Book by Rudyard Kipling. Heck my room is filled with a lot of books I wasted my money on and have yet to read the majority of them. 

So yeah, I've read more books than I could imagine.  Many were good, some were bad. However, these past couple of years really is a struck of luck as I think I've read some of the best ones in my many years of being a bookworm nerd. 3 Days of Happiness by Sugaru Miaki directly questions one's worth and the meaning in living. How do We Relationship? by Tamifull introduced a character that really spoke to me in a level I couldn't believe was possible. Wait for Me Yesterday in Spring by Mei Hachimoku set a new standard on how a character driven drama was supposed to be handled. Heck I became obsessed with Mei's works, so I binge all her books.

And alas, after 19 years. I think I've found the one. One that I'm sure gonna be stuck in my head till the day I die, it is The Mimosa Confessions.

With that lengthy intro out of the way, I was somewhat sceptical before I started reading it 2 days ago as I'm not a fan of otokonoko, crossdress or femboy. Usually in Japanese media, these are usually purely comedic, or/and fan-servicey. And that isn't my cup of coffee. After all I'm a himedanshi

However Mimosa Confessions is a different thing entirely. To call it crossdressing, or otokonoko, or yaoi is making it a disservice. It is just an honest and genuine story of someone trying to fit-in in a world where she couldn't belong, and some very very very messed up personal struggles. It isn't shy to address some really bleak issue that a lot of youngsters had faced, but are scared to confront, no matter if it's about gender or any other problems.

As expected of the Mei Hachimoku and like her other novels, the story handles each and every conflict, be it internal or external, spectacularly. She understands each character beyond what an author normally do, and she wrote them so that they could resonate with the readers. I even had to stop reading this evening to cool off as I realized my heart was hyperventilating and I was sweating bullets even tho the room I'm in have aircond. Heck, another teacher at my school asked me why I was frowning too hard while staring at my tab. Nah sis. I was just fully locked on and submerged myself within that other world called The Mimosa Confessions.

However, I found a half-empty bottle of my pumped milk in the fridge with a note from my husband (30M) saying he ‚Äúborrowed‚Äù some for his coffee.

1gap3nr,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1gap3nr/what_ive_learned_from_losing_11kg_in_5_months_and/,What I've learned from losing 11kg in 5 months (and gaining kilos of muscle in the process),"Hey all,

Today I reached my first goal of being below my pre-covid weight. Since March I've gone from 103kg to 92kg (next goal 85kg!), while adding a considerable amount of muscle in the process. So I thought I'd celebrate this by sharing what has worked for me and hopefully it helps someone achieve their own goals. 

**Diet**: I'll start with the hardest part and get it out of the way. Yes, you do have to be strict with your food there is no way around it that is healthy and sustainable. This is the most important thing and there are no shortcuts. I recall a day 2 months ago where I treated myself to a bowl of laksa, this one bowl added 2kg to my weight and completely undid a week of progress. Not only can eating these fatty foods undo your progress, it can also throw you back into bad eating habits. Just bite the bullet, be strong and say goodbye to pizza, ramen, chocolate, chips, burgers, and everything else you know is bad. If you don't, the chance is you will fail. 

I'll provide what I eat day to day as a 182cm, 33 year old male, as an example. With the changes in my eating patterns, I did not only want to lose weight, I wanted to be healthier and have a proper nutritional intake. I also wanted to gain some muscle (which helps with fat loss) so have a fairly high protein intake. 

**Breakfast** (don't skip it): Kellogs all bran high fibre cereal with honey, berries, milk & a Latte. This is a personal choice as I enjoy the high fibre and caffein (helps you poop which can be a challenge when your body goes through this process). Can reduce the calories further by opting for low fat milks and no milk in your coffee, but if you enjoy milk coffee like I do, it barely makes a difference (100 calories or so).  
**Lunch**: Anything healthy that can get me about 20-40g of protein. I often opt for 190 grams (2 small cans) of saltwater tuna in a salad if I can't be bothered with meal prep.   
**Dinner**: Chicken breast/Salmon/prawns, occasionally a steak. Always include mixed vegetables, primarily broccoli.  
**Snack**: High protein yogurt (in Australia we have YoPro which is fantastic, affordable and provides 20g protein per serve), or a protein shake. Fruit is also a great option if you don't require the protein. 

**Movement**: I'm keeping this separate to exercise (next) because this in itself is a lifestyle change. 'They' say sitting is the new cancer, and it's true, it messes your body up. Go for walks. Get physical hobbies. Walk to work. Walk to gym. Move around your office. Eat at your desk and walk on your breaks.   
**But I hate walking!**: Yes, so do I. The way I keep myself active is by using audiobooks. **I made myself a rule where I am only allowed to listen to my audiobooks or podcasts when I'm being active.** If I want to listen to a book I love, then I have to get my booty on the treadmill and walk for as long as I want to listen - this was honestly a masterstroke of a rule and got me from 2000 steps a day to 8000-12000 per day - again, as someone that hates walking - but really loves sci-fi audiobooks.  
  
**Exercise**: Separate from simply being active and moving, you need to do something that makes your body stronger. I opted for gym where I weight train 4 days a week because I wanted to look bigger and better, you can do whatever is right for you: Pilates, home video workouts, dancing, self-defence classes, buying two dumbbells and lifting them at home for 15mins a day. **Muscle helps your body burn fat**. If you are excessively overweight, it will also help to tone up your body and reduce the loose skin. Not to mention the overall health benefits this has for your body and longevity. Remember, it's not all about weight loss, it's also about being and staying healthier.  
  
**Knowledge and investments**: You need to learn and study what works so you can make informed decisions on your own. The internet is full of fads and garbage. Learn for yourself and rely on yourself. You don't need to bother with protein and supplements, really. Most supplements don't work, or have negative effects, and protein powder is hardly necessary for most people. The only investment I would urge you to make is a food scale so you get an understanding of what a correct portion looks like. Weighing your food and learning what a portion looks like is just so essential. It even helps you save money because you might come to realise that those huge chicken breasts your buying are TOO big and can be cut in half and divided into two meals. Other than that, research food, learn about calories, proteins and fats, trust me, this goes a LONG way. Here are some example to get you started from the dinners I prep:  
  
200g chicken breast: 330 calories, 62g protein, low fat  
200g salmon: 416 calories, 40g protein, high in healthy fats  
300g prawns: 297 calories, 72g protein, low in bad fats  
200g sirloin/porterhouse steak - 488 calories, 54g protein, low in bad fats (for a steak)  
   
And that's really it. Eat better, move more, train more, obtain knowledge, you've heard it all before and it's what works. Yes it's hard. Yes it requires a lot of sacrifice to lose weight. It takes time. But do yourself the favour and just get on with it. You'll be happier, healthier, it will add years to your life (if you're overweight), your body will feel better and you will thank yourself for doing it. You will be proud of yourself. I won't say good luck, because that has nothing to do with it. Be dedicated, be disciplined. You can f\*\*\*\*ng do it. ",2,1729727521.0,WeightLossAdvice,0,1.0,False

# GOG News

**Art:**

The first thing is more...'GOG-adjacent', I suppose. But I was so charmed coming across this game that I had to share it here.Reddit user u/udhay_eevee shared some screen-shots of his upcoming game, which he hopes will be (*eventually*, this is very much still 'in development') available on the GOG platform to buy:

&#x200B;

https://reddit.com/link/1gap3ki/video/85ts8rx5vkwd1/player

The game is being made with watercolors - painted onto textured watercolor paper and then scanned and cropped and cleaned up on procreate. Then imported into their gaming software.

I love the care and attention to this game, and how it blends hand-made art with gaming. It is *unique* and I'm so glad I found it here on Reddit. I have a handful of images to share here, which show off the style of it:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**JYDGE:**

Sadly GOG has seen a game delisted from their store: JYDGE.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cuo99x6vwkwd1.jpg?width=616&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8b8a13457494c51a7b0692dcd444c35e60e9d249

Known for taking some clear inspiration from the Judge Dredd universe (in the best way possible, mind you!), it has been available on the platform for seven whole years now, before its removal.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3sylae2wwkwd1.jpg?width=1580&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f97db7c7786c45dee9bc5da5adefdaf4ecc86b32

The good news is that it *will* be back on GOG, with a re-launch and a new name for the game. So, it stands to reason that the game was perhaps taken down for the name - being a little too 'on-the-nose' for the IP holders of Dredd.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**The Talos Principle II**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wyyai7qrxkwd1.jpg?width=619&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e34d5966590ec633d2337a8cb144be21054c7a7b

Finally, the first-person puzzler has released on GOG! It has launched with a 50% discount, so if you're interested in the DRM-free copy of the game, then...no better time to grab it!

The game released in November last year. Now on GOG you can not only get 50% off the base game, but you can also get:

&#x200B;

* 50% off the soundtrack

&#x200B;

* The 'Deluxe Edition' is 50% off

&#x200B;

* And The Talos Principle II: Road to Elysium Pack is 20% off currently

&#x200B;

And if you're unaware, GOG also provides 'newsletter discounts' to those subscribed to their email newsletter promotions, which can bring another (slight) discount for this title. The Talos Principle II sits at 'Overwhelmingly Positive' ratings on Steam, with 9,748 reviews. The downside for this is the rather insane download size - coming in at a 75 GB install size.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**GOG game covers:**

This one is...admittedly niche. But there is a rather lovely collection of people who just desperately miss physical media. They're so dedicated to the idea of owning their games (crazy right?) that they take their offline installers and burn them to a disk, or even a SD card. They then design, refine and print covers for these DVD's (or BluRays!) and display their favorite games.

&#x200B;

This might just be my favorite thing in gaming I've discovered recently. The dedication to their fav games and GOG's platform just has me frankly charmed.

I'll include a few here, because I really love them, but there are so, so, so many more out there. I love the GOG branding, the detail and effort everyone goes into making these 'just right', and then displaying them. Here's a few images:

[\(I'm still playing through Bioshock Remastered at the moment!\)](https://preview.redd.it/8zal3c6qzkwd1.jpg?width=1890&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b6fc22508f7ec833eb7453ef184d02c68fa28c7c)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**GOG Demos:**

If you didn't know, GOG also offers game demos. This is a part of gaming that seems to be dying out, or *far, far* more rare than it once was, so its nice to know that these still exist.

Rather than go into any detail (like I should, I suppose), I'll just leave some as bullet-points here so you can have a look if you're interested:

* [Forgotten 23 Demo](https://www.gog.com/en/game/forgotten_23_demo)
* [Symphonia Demo](https://www.gog.com/en/game/symphonia_demo)
* [Spirits of Baciu Prologue Demo](https://www.gog.com/en/game/spirits_of_baciu_prologue)
* [Ghost on The Shore Demo](https://www.gog.com/en/game/ghost_on_the_shore_demo)
* [An Amazing Wizard Demo](https://www.gog.com/en/game/an_amazing_wizard_demo)
* [JDM: Rise of the Scorpion Demo](https://www.gog.com/en/game/jdm_rise_of_the_scorpion)
* [Between Horizons Demo](https://www.gog.com/en/game/between_horizons_demo)

Yes yes, I know this is an annoying and sterile list of demo URL's, but there is such a wealth of them available on GOG, and the list is always changing. It might be nice if anyone here wants to 'try before I buy' - and its nice seeing the service on GOG :)

[If you are interested, check out the thread on the GOG Forum which is dedicated to demos - there is 24 pages of them here to look through!](https://www.gog.com/forum/general/the_list_of_demos_on_gogcom/page24)

**What is GOG?**

...just a video GOG shared on their Twitter some time ago, and I thought might be interesting, maybe even useful, for some people:

&#x200B;

https://reddit.com/link/1gap3ki/video/f19gfv80flwd1/player

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Resident Evil and GOG:**

There was a table/graphic shown on Resident Evil's official Twitter account which displayed where you can find the various Resident Evil games, and how to play them. It was nice to see GOG get a mention here, and as you know the *only* place you can find and play the original PC trilogy re-done for modern PCs is on GOG!

https://preview.redd.it/mwlch6p73lwd1.jpg?width=1002&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2e4afd884696710b95b71884346532c04a0121a1

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Deals on GOG:**

GOG is always running sales, but two *very, very* good deals right now are:

&#x200B;

Kingdom Come Deliverance, at 90% off the price ($3.99 USD)

https://preview.redd.it/xicsov1e3lwd1.jpg?width=1836&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4708c3505db595a3021e60df23b94f4644b47d78

Disco Elysium, at 80% off the price ($7.99 USD)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Fallout London:**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fc014sp15lwd1.jpg?width=920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d2054f78ca849cc34d3feeaef29daac022397c1b

A few things to note on Fallout 4 London, we've seen the offiical 1.02 patch release (which has brought a whole host of bug fixes and changes to the game):

""This update brings over a thousand fixes to the world of Fallout: London. From visual improvements, to bug fixes and quest fixes - you'll notice a massive difference right away.""

[A link to the 1.02 announcement video on YouTube can be found here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANhbGzvUVnQ)

&#x200B;

But they also announced a few hours ago that London has been redeemed 1 million times now on GOG! That's incredible news! Here is the video announcing this itself:

&#x200B;

https://reddit.com/link/1gap3ki/video/koztb8k25lwd1/player

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Caves of Qud:**

After seeing an update every week for...ever, Caves of Qud (which is currently in 'early access') has finally announced their upcoming 1.0 release!

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5eephggb9lwd1.jpg?width=817&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e32d14e676bf619f8fcc884acdcf7a3589ec11d9

The game has been in development for *over fifteen years now* and...that just strikes me as insanely impressive.

You can find more info here on their website: [https://www.cavesofqud.com](https://www.cavesofqud.com) and...for what it counts, congrats to the team for this huge milestone!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1&2 Remastered:**

Legends of making old games new again, Aspyr (though with varying degrees of goodness tbh) have announced that pre-order on GOG, but obv also on Steam and Epic.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# Epic Games News:

**EA Play is now live on the Epic Games Store.**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/uzcjwv30alwd1.jpg?width=1100&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5efb64e49dd2ac15025c31ad47d98fe29e4a8f0c

If you're invested in the Epic world, you can even try it for a month at a steep-steep discount. Or...buy the whole year, if you're so inclined. Nice regardless to see more growth and change on their platform though!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Epic Games Halloween sale:**

If you're interested in building your library up on Epic (to play through Heroic!), there's plenty of spooky deals that have gone live now. The best obviously is Alan Wake 2, which is a really big discount right now at 50% off

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v62bz55kalwd1.jpg?width=1100&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4d59ca6b5be7575752479d522fb8dbe18e185cf9

* Dead by Daylight (60% off)
* Dead Island 2 (30% off)
* Dying Light 2 (60% off)
* Alan Wake Remastered (75% off)
* GTA V (50% off)

And, obviously, far far more besides these.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**This week's free Epic title:**

To be given away on the 24th of October, we have Moving Out.

This title *was* already given away on Dec 28th, 2021, so perhaps there will be no game for you this week if you've already redeemed it. Still unsure whether this is the *only* title being given away this week, or whether there will be another, scarier one given also.

**Epic Games Interviews:**

There is two rather interesting interviews on the Epic site right now:

The first is with Sonic X Shadow Generations creative director, Takashi Lizuka, who is the creator of the Shadow character!

https://preview.redd.it/43njpeoqblwd1.jpg?width=1100&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=08c708b98da810290c422e91b013ec4956b4ab76

**Two brief Epic News snippets:**

&#x200B;

* [Horizon Zero Dawn will have Epic XP Achievements](https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered)
* Epic also is a part of the Fallout Day sale
* ""Just in time for Halloween!"" - No More Room in Hell 2 has launched into early access on Epic Games Store. A ""terrifying"" 8 player co-op action horror experience with permadeath, and one they say is "" an endlessly replayable zombie apocalypse"" 
* It is one more week until Red Dead Redemption (the first!) comes out on Epic Games Store

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# Final News?:

* GOG has turned 16 years old! It...did nothing for its 'birthday', but no one really expected it to, since it is an odd number for a storefront to celebrate.

&#x200B;

* Our member count here in the sub is growing, and (best of all to see!) we have comments and posts coming in now. It's *so* good to see this place (slowly) coming alive after stepping in to moderate here :)
* Welcome to all the new members here! I hope you enjoy your stay :)

&#x200B;

* I convinced one of the Heroic devs, Linguin, to join in here and accept moderator status. He is *not* super involved. I asked him more because it felt *right* to have a dev attached. To keep an eye on this place sometimes, and at least be attached.

&#x200B;

* I asked the Heroic Games Launcher team if there's anything to announce, and was told to remind you all that this week is (finally!) the Ubuntu Summit:
* [https://events.canonical.com/event/51](https://events.canonical.com/event/51)

I say all this to now sadly share, recently I was giving a lecture and out of no where a thought came through my mind ""no one knows what you're saying at all, and you've confused them. They don't understand a single word you're saying and youre making it worse"" and then a massive wave of anxiety came over me. My brain felt hot and light. I couldn't catch my breath to save my life. I knew that I was tanking publicly, and what's worse is that I could see it on everyone's faces. Even those who weren't paying attention now started paying attention to see what would happen next. This made it worse. I stopped, asked a colleague to take over, and left mid presentation. The material is basically elementary policies and procedures. Super boring, not complicated. 

The next couple months, even speaking in small groups to coworkers who I'm very friendly with, would send me into miniature episodes. My brain would do the same thing, my mind would go into absolute panic mode, I would feel in danger, and I had to stare at the ground just to say one sentence. 

Then when asked to present a big lecture again, I had the same thing happen which started it all. I was doing good but then I had the racing thought of ""You're all alone up here. No one can help you if you screw this up. You're alone"". And it nearly crippled me to the point of abandoning the room and sending someone else in. By the grace of God I made myself stay and finish it out. I told myself stay and finish this even if everyone thinks you're having a seizure or breakdown- you will finish this presentation no matter what. I got through it. Never returned fully to normal, but was passable as just a really really bad presenter. Same symptoms of embarrassment, can't catch my breathe, brain felt hot, etc. Even staring at the ground didn't help.

I feel like I've lost my talent, my gift, my charm... I don't know why this happened. I chalked up the first episode to strong coffee and the 10mg testosterone supplement (to boost energy levels) I was taking over the course of the month, all hitting at the worst time possible. But the 2nd large incident I've been free of supplements for 6 months now, and didn't have any coffee.

I just want to know how to go back to how I was before this happened. Maybe this is a learned response, such as a child isn't scared of something until they are told they should be scared of something and they cant shake it? How can I undo this, without the use of medicine? All my lectures are memorized to a T, not complicated, and boring. Is there anything that can be done? Maybe it's a sense of fearing rebuke? Not wanting to be vulnerable?

Thank you all for the help in advance. ",3,1729727196.0,PublicSpeaking,0,1.0,False

I lost a lot of weight, unintentionally, but have been living off coffee and a small meal for months due to being busy, exhausted and also having arfid(im neurodivergent). I know I will die if I stay in this condition. I'm **always** freezing and tired. I feel like I have to drag my body around when I move, like im my limbs are so heavy. My body hurts. I don't even like feel happy that I'm this thin. But I've spent years idolizing and fantasizing about being this size for years. I look sickly thin and like im dying. I hate it but a part of me wants to stay this size. I try to eat but I don't feel hungry often, its more like I feel faintish and agitated so I know I should eat something. I usually get disgusted/uninterested after a few bites and cant finish my food without feeling the need to puke. I know I need to gain weight, my health is awful. Even when I try it feels hopeless, like I gain nothing. I also have to walk a lot due to being in college and im worried I burn most of the calories I eat from that. I want to recover so badly, I want the full strength of my body. I don't want to see my hallowed cheeks and sunken eyes. Eating feels impossible, everything in life is starting to feel impossible due to how weak I am. I hate being picky, I hate feeling like im going to puke and cant finish a meal. I'm not trying to restrict, I eat whatever im craving, Im just trying to get any calories I can but I seem to only lose more weight and strength. I'm just worried that once I hopefully gain weight I will hate my body but its not like I love myself right now.

Everyone here talks about CAC.  Should I just ignore all this and get a CAC?  What the heck does one do to improve arterial thickness with no plaque?

But today we had another great conversation about bettering ourselves and how we had each been thinking about that and starting new habits. I walked out after we had finished chatting and as soon as I got to my car I realized it would‚Äôve felt totally fine to invite her to coffee, but I just got myself out of there as soon as we were done talking because I was relieved I wasn‚Äôt being completely weird. So I forced myself to get out of the car and go back!!! 

I asked her to coffee and she said yes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I texted her some times I‚Äôm free coming up I‚Äôm so excited I could barely get myself out of there a second time I was absolutely dead

I‚Äôm so relieved that I wasn‚Äôt imagining things and she‚Äôs at least open to being friends and getting to know each other better. Maybe things go well and there‚Äôs a chance for something else? Either way I‚Äôm so happy!

Yesterday, I took Ritalin on an empty stomach like my doctor instructed. I cut back my usual cup of coffee to half to help curb any anxiety or restlessness I might experience.....and boy, that was still far too little of a change to counteract the adverse stimulant effects.

I became super hyper and animated. My thinking was very clear, but I moved at a far too rapid pace. The physical discomfort I felt was the worst part. In addition to nausea, I simply felt on edge. Feeling the medication wear off later that day was a huge relief.

Today, I took the ritalin after breakfast to see if that would help and instead found that it didn't seem to have much of an effect except maybe fatigue. I had to keep drinking tea (I didn't risk more coffee than the 4 oz) throughout the day. I dosed myself at lunch again on an empty stomach only to have the same experience - mild fatigue.

My motivation was actually relatively degraded compared to usual at work. The consequences of not performing at maximum output just didn't seem as urgent. On one hand, I was glad to have a break from my typical anxiety. On the other, this was not the effect I expected at all.

So, I'm not sure what to think so far about the medication. I am going to try again on an empty stomach to see what happens.

If I continue to have the calming paradoxical reaction to the stimulant, I may just work with it. Perhaps I really do run on so much anxiety most days that I focus on stuff that doesn't actually matter. Perhaps this change of perspective will help me prioritize what I most care about.",2,1729726080.0,RitalinIR,0,1.0,False

I don't feel comfortable putting pictures of me up on Reddit as I don't want to be recognized, but I will be happy to share what I look like once we connect.

I promise, there are no surprises. No baldness, not majorly overweight, and probably a solid 6.

No point in lying, right?

I'm into all the standard needy polyam stuff, like TTRPGS, close-knit hangouts, cuddling, and animals. And, in case you're allergic, I have 3 huskies.

I'm a vocal, anarchist-leaning leftist who is interested in dismantling the patriarchy and ending white supremacy. I promise I'm not too serious all the time.

If there is anything else, I am an open book. Feel free to ask.

I'm looking for something meaningful, not purely sexual. If there is no connection when we meet for coffee, it's not going to go further. I'm at a point where I understand what I am looking for and know when it's there.

I'm open to women and trans-femme individuals. Not looking for a unicorn or to include my wife. Seeking a *real* relationship, not something superficial.

And, now that I've made it this far, I kind of like the idea of getting to know eachother before we see eachother, so let's try that.

Look forward to talking to you.

","It really hurt my feelings /s. For context, I‚Äôm a retired US veteran. My time in the service is a big part of what informs my leftist politics.

The comment was in relation to student campus protests for a ceasefire/ divestment of their university from Israeli firms. 

I was speaking in defense of the protestors when I got the comment about ‚Äúyou‚Äôll just be making my coffee in 10 years and looking for another ‚Äòmovement‚Äô‚Äù 

I found it extremely telling how liberals can so easily wish you a horrible life simply because you don‚Äôt agree with them. **especially on something so mild like supporting people‚Äôs right to protest** 
They do all this talk about wanting equality, improving the economy, wages, people‚Äôs standard of living, etc. etc. but disagree and they want you to suffer for life. 

Not only that but they assume everyone who doesn‚Äôt agree with them is young, uneducated and unable to socially and financially advance. Only young, spoiled, uneducated kids could support the protests. 

They can‚Äôt fathom that someone with far more experience than them, even someone who‚Äôs been on the side of Government, can disagree and support the protestors. 

It was funny to me, because meanwhile in reality, I‚Äôm a retired vet and I have a lot of privileges because of that. I don‚Äôt have to work much, I don‚Äôt own my home (but I‚Äôm fortunate to recently come into really great and extremely affordable housing that I accessed **through my community fk yea mutual aid**). 

I have healthcare, I‚Äôm studying agriculture (hands on and will be starting school soon) my tuition is covered. My bills for me, my partner, and our animals, are covered as long as I live a humble life, which I am more than happy to do. (Spend that gov college money to be a peasant farmer) I have access to job placement and training assistance. 

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm by no means wealthy, and have been more often than not living paycheck to paycheck. And truthfully, I paid for it in the physical injuries I‚Äôll deal with for a life time, and the mental health consequences. 

And a big part of why I‚Äôm living more comfortable recently is because I moved out of the city, into a small town, and spent a long time networking and building community until I could find a housing situation off market that is well bellow market rate. 

**even with the benefits I‚Äôve gained as a veteran, I would not be in the more comfortable position am now without the mutual aid I received from my community. Which ironically is a Muslim community** 
(I am Muslim. Muslims in the military, yes I know we all have our journeys) 

I say all this not to boast in anyway. But to say:

**A big part of why I am a leftist is because I got out of the military, began to access all my benefits, looked around and said, WHY THE FCK IS THIS NOT AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE?!** 

**I DONT FCKIN CARE IF YOU ARE LIBERAL OR CONSERVATIVE OR W.E THE FCK**

**as long as you are not actively seeking to cause harm to others**

**I want EVERYONE to have access to these services. AND MORE. I don‚Äôt care if they did drugs. I don‚Äôt care if they‚Äôre on the corner right now with a needle in their arm passed out. **

** I don‚Äôt care if you‚Äôre a ‚Äúfiscal conservative‚Äù or a racist (I do care fuck you) I still want you to have access to all those benefits. **

Because i believe with access to a system like that, we can raise up society as whole. We can all become educated (through diversity of thought, no one truth narrative bs here), we can all raise our standard of living. 

And through that we can hopefully reach a more equitable society that drops the hate formed through the capitalist class and build class solidarity and consciousness. Egalitarian dream yes, but that is the Fking point. Dream of something better, not keep choosing the lesser of two evils and cheerlead for the genocider with the lowest kill count. 

I‚Äôve never looked at someone who ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt work as hard as me‚Äù and thought ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt deserve what I have because I went through fkin hell for it.‚Äù 

I just wish that people could gain what I have and **more** without going through what I did.

The way liberalism affects people‚Äôs humanity vs leftism is jarring. 

Edit to say: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care if you‚Äôre racist etc etc‚Äù but if you do attempt to cause harm to others despite all community attempts, comrades know how to handle that. ",50,1729725214.0,leftist,20,0.87,False

It‚Äôs not unusual to find me deep inside a Spotify hole with my headphones on, hunting for new music and creating playlists. If you have any music suggestions, I'd love to hear them!

I love to draw/sketch/doodle and I‚Äôll ALWAYS be up for drawing something for the people I chat with. I thrive when someone gives me an idea and its also a great way to see what goes on in someone‚Äôs head üòä

In what very little spare time that I have, I like to go to the gym. I seen someone post recently that they were looking for someone to effectively be their gym friend. I quite like this idea and would happily do that with someone too. Routine advice, encouragement and just someone to keep each other company in-between sets.

I also like to sink some time into games. I have a backlog that I‚Äôm never ever going to get through.

I was born on July 14, 2011, I was like any normal baby, but the first major event would happen when I was around 3 years old, I was at my grandparents house. They had this coffee table with sharp edges. So there i was, on the couch and I fell off the couch and the Cornor of my head had hit the sharp edge of the coffee table. My head had split open, but thankfully my skull did not crack.
My uncle is considered a genius with his IQ, so he stitched my head, and I stood up, and walked away like nothing had happened.
And walked wasnt a typo, I walked at the age of around 3.

When I was 5 I went to elementary, I had a great time, but at the end of the year, our landlord had kicked us out of the house. Later when I was 6 I went to Anderson elementary in Allen Texas.
Elementarys have to from kindergarten to 6th grade in Allen Texas.
I was at Anderson until 5 grade.
Around when I was 7-8(1st grade) I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression. Rough story already. I know.
Later when I was 10(3rd grade)
I was diagnosed with AD-HD and it was covid year, my landlord lied in court and got us kicked out of our house. May I add it was Christmas time.
So later when I was 12 Anderson was shut down and turned into a preschool.
I switched to Olson elementary, Allen Texas. At the beginning of that year, a friend had let us move in with him since we didn't have permanent home, and could be confused homeless/ misplaced. Even though we were living in cheap hotels.
And 2023-2024 is the time we are living with our friend.we are still here.

But I'm smart, successful, and a happy.
Even though we are still in a rough situation with our finance.
I have a coin collection worth over 2,000$

Caffeine has been increasingly becoming an issue for me. It used to give me a nice buzz with some energy - but now it‚Äôs just pure adrenaline and anxiety. Really, really uncomfortable :/ 

I recently started talking abilify, so I‚Äôm wondering if caffeine is just too much for me now with this med having an activating factor to it.

I know there‚Äôs talk about caffeine being able to affect your lithium levels, so I wanted to see if anybody here safely stopped drinking coffee/caffeine while taking lithium. I think most of the research comes from significant/heavy caffeine use, but I‚Äôd rather be safe than sorry. My levels were 0.5 last I checked, so I feel like quitting wouldn‚Äôt be harmful on my end.

For FSU, I‚Äôm planning on transferring to hopefully in the fall after I do a semester at the community college near me.  For South Carolina, I‚Äôm also considering on attending in the fall. I'm the kind of person who is all about finding a library to study at. I'm all about cute coffee shops. Plus I live in Columbia, SC.  So I can easily commute and not have to worry about dorming, but would like to be independent and away from my parents lol. FSU is 6 hours away from me, and the guy I‚Äôm talking to goes there ( I used to live in Florida and we know each other from high school.) My main concern with FSU is the party life, as l'm not a huge party girl. l'm more of an introvert. But I do enjoy going out it just depends like what I‚Äôm doing. I‚Äôm also considering joining a sorority but I‚Äôm not 100% sure yet. ",0,1729723933.0,collegecompare,0,0.5,False

But my anxiety level is so high that period isn't happening. It's making me literally sick. 3 days late today. 
Those symptoms my body usually handles well are literally crushing me. I can do headache, I can do heartburn, I can do cramps. But the nausea? I hate it :( I have severe emetophobia and I am spiraling.
I eat because I'm hungry and on my second bite I feel like I'm about to throw up. So I put it down, deep breaths. It passes, and I keep eating a little. Until I get nauseous again after 15 minutes???
The crazy thing is, since I knew my period was gonna be influenced by my anxiety and panic this month, I've been taking care of my body and mental health, eating iron rich foods, healthy smoothies, I cut out coffee. I cut out sugar üò≠ this was 10 days ago. Been keeping All my supplements too... It's just my mind that is fucking me up. So many intrusive thoughts and anticipatory grief. I worried about my dad's health from the moment I wake up until I go to sleep. 
There are months were I'm drinking liters of coffee and eat food that don't really nurtures me and I feel just fine.
I just want it to stoppppp pleaseee I just need my period. I know I will feel immediately better once I got it. ",9,1729723866.0,Anxiety,3,1.0,False
