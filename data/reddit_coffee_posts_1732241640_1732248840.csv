I (25F) think I’ve found my soulmate. I’ve been going to the same gym since it opened about six months ago. Over time, I’ve gotten familiar with the regulars who go at the same time as me 6 a.m.

About two months ago, I started noticing a new guy around my age (23M). We’d exchange glances from afar, but it never went beyond that—not even a smile. Occasionally, I’d catch him looking at me through the mirrors, but whenever I glanced back, he’d quickly look away. This kept happening, and honestly, I started looking forward to going to the gym just to see him (not in a creepy way, I promise!).

One day, we crossed paths and locked eyes as we passed each other. It felt like he was looking straight into my soul, and for the first time in a long time, I felt butterflies in my stomach. I started joking with my friends about him, calling him my “gym husband,” even though he hadn’t shown any real interest in me.

Then after that intense eye contact, he began avoiding working out anywhere near me. I figured he either had a girlfriend or just wasn’t interested. But one day, I caught him blatantly looking at me in the mirror again, and I decided I had to talk to him.

Later during my workout, I noticed him walking outside to the gym’s outdoor area. He was all by himself, and something inside me just screamed, It’s now or never. I gave myself three minutes to build up the courage and, without really thinking about what I’d say, I got up and walked right up to him.

When he looked up and saw me, his eyes widened, and his face lit up. I was so nervous that I word-vomited something like, “Hi, I don’t want to be weird, but I’ve been seeing you here for a while, and I just wanted to say I think you’re really cute.”

To my surprise, he smiled from ear to ear and told me he’d been working up the courage to talk to me for months. He asked for my number, and we ended up planning a picnic date for that weekend.

The date was incredible. We talked for over five hours, just getting to know each other. We discovered we have so much in common: we share the same faith, we’re both athletes (he’s a football player and competes in jiu-jitsu, while I’m a competitive bodybuilder), and we have similar interests. We even came up with seven or eight date ideas that day alone.

Since then, I’ve been seeing him at the gym every day, and we’ve already gone on a country bar/rodeo date and a coffee date. He’s hilarious, and being with him feels so natural like I’ve known him forever. There’s never been an awkward moment between us.

He recently told me that he feels the same way. In fact, he confessed that the very day I approached him, he had been praying to God for a sign to give him the courage to talk to me. That’s why he had such a big reaction when he looked up and saw me standing there.

I know it’s only been a few weeks, but I can’t shake the feeling that he’s meant for me. I’ve never felt this connected to someone before, like I’ve known him in a past life. He’s everything I’ve been praying for.

Has anyone else ever experienced something like this? Is it normal to feel this way so quickly? I’m so confused but also so happy.",1,1732248614.0,TwoHotTakes,2,1.0,False

# Highlights of Best Buy Black Friday 2023 Deals

Best Buy had some good offers last year across electronics, appliances, and other popular items. Here’s a rundown of the best deals from 2023:

* **Apple AirPods Pro 2nd Gen**: These were marked down to $199 (was $249) at Best Buy. This was a pretty solid deal for anyone looking to grab Apple’s premium wireless earbuds.
* **LG 55” 4K UHD TV**: Best Buy had this TV for $379 (was $499) last year. The 55” LG models are a popular choice, and this was a good discount for a quality brand.
* **Samsung 70” QLED 4K TV**: This was discounted to $1,099 (was $1,399) at Best Buy. If you’re after a larger screen, this one was a solid deal.
* **Dyson V11 Cordless Vacuum**: Best Buy dropped the price to $399 (was $599), a significant discount for a high-end vacuum.
* **HP Pavilion Laptop**: This went for $249 (was $449) last year, and it was a great deal for anyone needing a budget-friendly laptop.
* **Ninja DualBrew Pro Coffee Maker**: Marked down to $149 (was $229), a solid deal for coffee lovers.

It’s safe to expect similar deals across these categories this year, but here’s what I’m predicting for Black Friday and Cyber Monday 2024.

# Best Buy Black Friday Deals 2024: What to Expect

Based on trends from 2023 and what we've seen in past years, here’s what I think we’ll see in the Best Buy Black Friday 2024 sale:

* **Laptops**: Budget laptops will likely be discounted to around $200-$350, with more premium models going for $600-$800. Brands like HP, Lenovo, and Acer are usually featured.
* **Smartphones**: Expect discounts on phones like the iPhone 14 and Samsung Galaxy S23, possibly with trade-in deals or bundles. Last year, the iPhone 13 was available for $399, so the 14 could be around the same price.
* **Televisions**: Best Buy is likely to offer discounts on 55” to 75” models, including popular brands like LG, Samsung, and TCL. The 55” models might drop to around $350-$450, with larger 70”+ models going for $900-$1,200.
* **Gaming Consoles**: The PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S are likely to be featured again this year, either bundled with games or discounted directly.
* **Smart Home Devices**: Google Nest and Amazon Echo devices often get price cuts, so expect smart speakers, cameras, and other accessories to be priced lower.
* **Headphones and Earbuds**: Brands like Sony, Bose, and Beats will likely be discounted, with deals on models like the Sony WH-1000XM5 or Beats Studio Buds.
* **Home Appliances**: Items like air fryers, vacuums, and coffee makers will probably be marked down again this year, similar to last year’s Ninja and Dyson deals.

1gwz0km,https://www.reddit.com/r/leanfire/comments/1gwz0km/im_frugal_af/,I’m Frugal AF,"I retired at 48, but “werk” in volunteering my time on various causes and am now 55 and am going to let some of these responsibilities go as well, my parents need more assistance at the end of their lives. 

I would love to hear feedback on our (husband [59] Lean/fire situation:

I bought our home 600k  in 2014, I refinanced when rates dropped to a 2.75 interest rate and threw another $200k into the mortgage to pay it down quickly. We’ve fixed up our home, (fire proofed best we can with Climate Emergency), new windows, roof, etc to make it sound/sustainable. We recycle grey water and capture rain for reuse (our water consumption is very low thus cheap.) we don’t heat with gas. No AC. 

We plan on paying off our home in 2025 ~ 12 mos. More

I have $500k in stocks $50k in bonds some miscellaneous company stock from previous employer and I don’t even know how to cash out (20k?) the public company has changed hands 

My car (a 14 yo Prius) is owned outright and it has 80,000 miles and it’s doing great

I purchased home solar system outright for energy (use space heaters in winter with this power), and the ROI has been met in 8 years

We bought a small pop up camper that we pull with a Subaru Outback (we’re still paying off at 0%) for vacation- we don’t crave foreign travel, we live on California coast. Taxes are about $14k now on home. 

Our home value looking at comps is valued at $1.45 mm (yes really) a good investment.

My husband’s 401k is currently at 2.5mm

His income is 180k. 

I want him to RE too. Our big hurdle is the healthcare situation as I am a Type 1 Diabetic in good health. We often wonder about medical tourism, and paying cash when time comes and we don’t have his company sponsorship of health plan. 

When his mother passes he will inherit her home currently valued at $550k and some investments from his parents. This is same with my parents. They own outright at $800k but I want my sister to have their home. 

I know this information is all over the place, but are there things I need to be doing to ensure we have enough to live out our lives meagerly?  We honestly live economically, no eating out, etc. no fancy hobbies, no alcohol 🍷, or coffee habits. The most expensive thing I am involved with is caring for my 3 pets ages 1.5, 8, and 16. We have no children.

We basically text everyday throughout the day and send each other reels, sometimes more than one and we both react and reply to each and every one of each others reels. As for texting goes, 90% of how we text each other seems flirty in the sense where we are always making each other laugh and sending a lot of emojies to each other. Nothing crazy like “🥰” but we heart each others messages and send stuff like this “😊🙃😌😋😂🤣🫣🥺” constantly. We don’t see each other very much in person anymore because of schedule conflicts but when we do it’s nothing but a great time, we are constantly laughing and enjoying each others presence. But we are both very busy so in person time isn’t much. Over Instagram stories we always heart each others post, at this point I’m sure she can’t possibly be talking to any other boy more than myself, I know her schedule and it’s very packed everyday. We have deep conversations and although I’m the one who always starts them, she engages in them when I bring it up. I’ve expressed certain things to her that I wouldn’t with someone normally and we have gone out to get coffee but nothing crazy. I’m thinking of expressing my need for clarity to her, but from what I’ve said, does it seem like we could be more or just really good friends? Btw I have strict boundaries of I can’t have female friends and I can only express my emotions to one person at a time. 
Another thing to note, she has mentioned quite a few times of how similar we are and it’s honestly weirdly true because we have a lot in common, sometimes suspiciously to much 😂. 

So let me know Reddit, am I being delusional of all the signs or am I being reasonable with my assumptions and going forth with asking for clarification is good for both of us.

I live in a *very* small town along the Hangzhou-Haining intercity line. Since I live in a small town, it's very difficult to meet new people - there's not much of a social life in this town. I can go to one of the two coffee shops, go to the market, or go to a restaurant. That's about it.

They commute from Haining every day. And as for locals, although I speak Chinese, or at least better than the average foreigner, I really haven't made what I would call friends.

Last school year, I lived in Jiangsu, Suzhou. I had made many friends through various groups including a reading club, a city walk group, and even an English Corner (I am a native speaker, but I was invited by the guy who runs the city walk group).

1gwyx7k,https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/comments/1gwyx7k/tijōn_new_orleans_perfume_class/,Tijōn New Orleans Perfume Class,"My family was in New Orleans for a few days last week, and while my mom and I were looking for things to do, she stumbled across information about Tijōn's perfume class in one of those New Orleans tourist magazines. My mom doesn’t wear fragrances although she does like the room and linen sprays I've bought for her in the past. Anyway, we ended up going to the class, and it was a great experience! I already want to go back and do it again.

My mom and I did the Mix and Match Class which is $99 (USD) per person. The Mix and Match Class lasts about 90 minutes and is offered at 10:30 AM, 1:00 PM, or 3:00 PM. We ended going with the 10:30 class. We got there about fifteen minutes early, which gave us time to look around the store. Along with fragrances in a variety of formats like perfumes, body cremes, lotions, and massage oils, they also offer soap and some really cute jewelry. They have tester bottles out and a funnel where the perfume has been sprayed in case you don't want to do a skin test. I didn't spray any testers because I didn't want to risk overexerting my sense of smell, but I did smell some of the funnels, and the fragrances were really nice. You get a 15% discount thanks to the class, so I got a really nice verbena, rose, and lavender soap, and my mom got a sturdy wine glass with the shop's name and location on it and a mint, citrus, and sea salt soap for my sister.

# The Class

The Mix and Match Class lets you make three fragrances, and you can choose one to take home. You can decide to get more than one to take home, but it's an extra cost. You get a lab coat to wear during the class, and you're sat a collection of tables in the back of the store. Along with the 300 and more options on the perfume organ, there are multiple stations in the back that have 40 of Tijōn's most popular accords/notes and a selection of base formulas that you use as a starting point for your fragrance. Your workstation is set up with three beakers and a booklet full of trivia, instructions, tips on what to add if you want a certain affect, a list of the base formulas and their notes, a page dispelling some perfume myths, and more. You also get a page where you note down what you chose so you can keep track of your fragrance's composition. They also have a little glass container of coffee beans to combat olfactory fatigue. The stations in the back are exactly the same, so you don't have to worry about not having a certain component. The base formulas range from frankincense and myrrh, a chypre, a tropical citrus, a jasmine fragrance, to a simple lime, basil, and musk set up. Once you've chosen your base formulas, you add each one to one of the three beakers at your seat.

The perfume organ has over 300 different notes and accords that range from the more typical vanilla, jasmine, rose, vetiver, patchouli, lavender, aquatic accord, leather, and bergamot to more uncommon options like pomegranate, smoked cedar, ocean rain, hyssop, plumeria, and many more. Since we're limited to three accords/notes plus the base, they also have options that are combinations of notes like vanilla lavender, pomegranate sweet orange, rose musk, red currant and thyme, and so on. I could have spent all day just smelling everything on the perfume organ, but we had limited time. All of the accords and notes I did smell were really nice and none of them smelled chemically.

Anyway, once you have your three fragrances, one of the instructors applies them on you for a skin test and sends you outside to see which one you like. I'm naturally indecisive and because of the time constraints, you're only really able to judge the fragrance from its top notes. That, of course, isn't something anyone really has control over, and it's not like they can change the molecular structure of a fragrance at will, but it's something to keep in mind. After you choose what fragrance you want a bottle of, you make the actual perfume. You get to choose the name (one to two word titles only) of your fragrance, and you write down the components you chose for your fragrance again. Then it gets bottled and labeled. Tijōn also keeps your fragrance's formula on record so you can reorder it as a perfume or in another format.

Along with your fragrance, you also get a glass of champagne or non-alcoholic champagne (they ask if you want alcohol or not) at the end, a 15% discount off of goods in the store, and a bag of goodies. The bag of goodies includes a 15ml bottle of perfume, a container of lip balm, and a bracelet. You also get to keep your booklet. Overall, it was a really fun and interesting experience. My mom was pleasantly surprised by how enjoyable it was. She said that she thought it might be pretentious, but it wasn't at all, and

The fragrance I ended up going with was hyssop, smoked cedar, and leather and their citrus, juniper berry, lily, sunflower, and white musk base. I actually screwed up the fragrance I was building that was going great, because I added an aquatic note because I forgot their was a sea kelp option, but that's on me.

# The Good

* The instructors (Dayton and Lauren) are informative, passionate, knowledgeable, helpful, patient, and friendly. They were happy to answer questions, give recommendations, and were just really fun and pleasant in general. One example of this is when Lauren noticed I hadn't completely filled up my perfume bottle (I underfilled it a little) and added the last remnants. Also, when I was a little overwhelmed by all the choices, Dayton took some time to recommend some options to me. (I owe Dayton my life for recommending the smoked cedar note, because it’s gorgeous.)
* The instructions are presented in a clear and straightforward way that makes things really accessible and easy to understand.
* There's a excellent variety of notes to choose from, and the components themselves are high quality.
* Did I mention the 15% discount and the free goodies?
* Tijōn keeps your formula on hand so you can reorder it if you want to.
* You have the option to take home more than one of the fragrances you make at an extra cost.
* Wearing a lab coat is fun. :D
* You get to name your fragrance and get it in a 55ml bottle with a cute label.
* I like that they have stations in the back with 40 of their most popular components because I think it would keep things from being too overwhelming for beginners.

# The Neutral AKA things that aren’t really in anyone’s control but are worth keeping in mind

* You don’t have enough time to get past the top notes (I heard some people got around this somehow by moving their arms really fast, but I don’t know if that helps) so the top notes heavily factor your decision.
* As far as I know, you have to build off a set base. The base formulas themselves come in a good variety and range, and they do offer one that’s just frankincense and myrrh.
* The other people taking the class were really nice and fun to talk to. I also liked smelling the fragrances people ended up choosing.
* Along with your base, you can only choose three notes/accords. This was enough for me, but it was painful deciding between oud and leather for one fragrance.
* It’s in a convenient location in the French Quarter. It’s close to good restaurants, shopping, and Tové, another perfume shop.

# The Bad

* I don’t know if this would be a good fit for someone who wants more freedom in composing their fragrance. You might be able to make your own base formula if you ask, but I can’t say that for sure.",1,1732247523.0,fragrance,0,0.99,False

1gwyqhp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gwyqhp,Received Legato v2 white (from Bambino) - Quick Review,"Finally received Legato v2 white today. I have been using a regular bambino, and I thought I would use it for many more years, especially after getting good results with running hot water with stock portafilter and warm up bottomless filter, etc. I got tired of doing all that to just make a cup of espresso. It’s such a nice feeling to just wait a few minutes to have both the machine and portafilter warmed up. Unfortunately the power button is digital, so I don’t think a smart plug would work. The temp goes up to 97c surprisingly quick, I believe it was about 3 minutes. Probably I will still wait for at least 10 minutes to heat the portafilter.  

I guess they updated the drip tray after complaints that it just sat there without being connected, but I need to figure out a way to add some sort of felt. The metal guide and metal drip tray makes nail on the chalkboard sound, and I can’t stand it. I wish it were just not connected at all like v1. The accessories seem okay, I may keep using the portafilter with spouts for now, but I ordered 58mm spring temper. The temper isn’t good, and it doesn’t fit very snug on the portafilter. The steam wand has 3 hole installed, and 2 hole tip came in separately. The white bottle is probably descale powder, but I may not be using it for a very long time since I use distilled water with bicarbonate. 

Made a light roast EA decaf which was always a challenge with Bambino since I put together in the evening. (I prefer medium to medium dark roast, but the local roaster refuses to make dark decaf. Any recommendations for CO2 decaf medium-dark roast?)

I tried the bloom, 5 seconds running and 10 seconds waiting (ended up exactly 17g in 35g out, forgot to adjust time for automatic button). Also manual mode without bloom, 17in 60g out, I think it was about 40 sec?. The manual mode tasted much better. It’s still a little acidic to my taste (I used to be a big tea drinker, and it feels rather like tea instead of coffee although maybe that’s what people like about light roast), but it’s still good light roast espresso that I couldn’t get from Bambino. I believe the manual mode is already doing some sort of blooming because the pressure gauge moved up to 9 very slowly. Maybe OVP is already set up to 9 Bar. 

The last two photos are unscientific method of checking temperature of the coffee. 170F from Legato and a little less than 100F from Bambino. Both right after brewing, and both cups are warmed. The blue cup for Bambino was heated with hot water, and the glass cup for Legato v2 was just sitting on top of the machine. I took these photos because I remember seeing someone posting coffee temp with Bambino. Since the blue cup is larger, the coffee lose heat faster, but it was heated up a lot more. It’s still quite a big difference.",0,1732246919.0,espresso,1,0.5,False

All I have under my belt is that I’m a math tutor in my college and I attend some clubs but I’m not a higher up member or anything. 

I want goals to work towards but I don’t really know what they should be…  I am gonna try aiming for an internship this summer and/or the next but that’s about all I can think of. 

What are some other reasonable goals and/or projects I can pursue? The projects I’m looking into require a lot of space(homebrewing) which is why I’m at a loss because I don’t have space to do it. I’ve always been interested in making good coffee and I love fragrances. Any expansion of that would be amazing if I could pursue it in a project way. Otherwise I’m not too picky(although my end goal is joining the food and fragrance industry)

I just feel like everyone around me is doing so much and I can’t just wait for inspiration to strike so I wanted advice about this.

1gwyl26,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gwyl26,Slime Senpai - Fall/Holiday Review,"Alright, Slime Reddit. You told me that really large slime shop’s slime was lower quality than smaller shops, and I rolled my eyes because I legitimately enjoyed my slime from large shops. I owned tons of slime from large shops, all of the textures; I made my own slime all the time and knew how to trouble shoot any issues. I thought I knew it all, and was convinced the idea of “high quality slime” and “low quality slime” was fully subjective - and, really, how different could one brand’s jelly, clear, or TNG be from another brand’s jelly, clear, or TNG? 

And then I bought a few slimes from Slime Senpai. And I understood. You were right, I was wrong. 

First, the order. I placed an order on restock night. I ordered Ugly Christmas Sweater (mini block and button bead), Pecan Glazed Donut (milky clear + perlite DIY clay), Honey Butter Rolls (TNG + DIY clay) and also wanted Cranberry Jelly (coated jelly), but I accidentally sent my order without adding it. So, I went back and placed a second order for Cranberry Jelly. I emailed asking if she could combine my order into one box to save on shipping, and received a quick reply confirming the adjustment. Super easy. All four slimes arrived at my house, in a box, together, less than a week from my order date. 

I also received a complimentary full-sized slime (which I believe is the base slime from Cozy Coffee Shop - TNG + pumice) and a small sample container of Sweet Potato Casserole (semi marshmallow floam). 

The first thing I noticed was the size of these slimes. The packages are a full oz larger than the ones I’ve received from larger shops, and that feels nice in grown adult hands! The clay kits obviously result in even much more slime when mixed together. 

Next, the textures. The slime really is just better. It is less sticky/tacky and more substantial-feeling in my hands - and I’m not just talking about size when I say that. It really does have a different feel, and it’s a lot more satisfying to play with. The Sweet Potato Casserole was lightly jiggly and could be stretched for days without inflating (so fun!), the clear base in Ugly Christmas Sweater and the TNG from Honey Butter Rolls give the most satisfying, snappy pops. I’m obsessed with the sizzles from the perlite in the Peacan Donut one; my only regret is that I wish it had more perlite! 

Finally, the scents. I wasn’t wild about the scents, but all of that is just personal preference and I may come around to some of them with more time. Honey butter rolls, cranberry jelly, and pecan donut were probably my favorites. Sweet potato casserole is the exact same scent as red fox fur from an October Peachybbies drop and I don’t like that one at all. Again, this is all just personal preference. Maybe I’m not a fall scent girl.

All-in-all, I’m rating the shop an easy 10/10, a must buy, despite the slight scent discordance from my preference. If you are an adult who uses slime to decompress and you want a really satisfying line-up of slimes, order from this shop. I can’t wait to order more! And I promise I won’t again roll my eyes when I see a post talking about slime quality. 😂",6,1732246433.0,Slime,3,1.0,False
1gwykt7,https://www.reddit.com/r/sandiego/comments/1gwykt7/whats_the_job_market_like_in_sd/,What’s the job market like in SD? ,"I’m 26F from the Midwest and have family that lives in San Diego. I’ve always wanted to move somewhere warm and my family offered to have me stay with them for free out there. Super grateful for. My only concern is the job market. I know in general it’s bad at the moment. I work in the photography and social media marketing space and was wondering how hard would it be to find a job once I’m out there? 

I’ve already tried applying to jobs while I’m here in the Midwest but I never get considered bc they always pick someone local instead. I had one good shot, did the interview, got a final interview, but they ended up going with someone local at the end of the day. 

So my plan is to just go out there, and find a job once I’m there. Even if I have to start at coffee shop or something I would. I’ve never been to San Diego before, and I’ve been looking for a fresh start somewhere new. Especially places that are warmer. Midwest winters are the worse and I can’t stand the cold. Just wanted to see what locals would have to say about the job market out there or any advice you could provide. Thanks! ",0,1732246412.0,sandiego,4,0.14,False

1gwygek,https://www.reddit.com/r/Udyrmains/comments/1gwygek/oktime_to_start_talking_udyr_midscope_update/,Ok...Time to start talking Udyr Midscope Update,"Been playing with my friends and...holy shit dude. Riot tried not to touch his R, in terms of damage, before doubling down and actually doing it, to then NOT REVERTING THE ALREADY POINTLESS E NERF? It feels like every single champ beats me early, and every champ can just win the later stages of the game through ganking, since ganks are IMPOSSIBLE TO PULL OFF now. 

It's so infuriating to see that there are champions in this game that are coddled, and never get to be bad for more than a patch. Meanwhile Udyr is viable for a couple and they immediately take him out to the pasture to shoot him. They did this when Oldyr Chemtech Deadmans phase rush was popular...

So now, a midscope update pitch. Partially a message to Riot feeling the need to listen to everyone who has NO CLUE how Udyr works, like its not their damn fault they keep allowing him on top of them. 

I frequent the sub daily and read while having some coffee, and I realize people don't like the fact that Udyr heavily relies on his awakenings, and neither do I. So I'm proposing a best of both worlds situation. To simply take the power out of his awakenings, and returning it to his stances, so he actually feels like a stance character, and not an abilities character. The awakenings should add a period or exclamation point to what we can do, not be the focal point of the champ. Also, we can keep E exactly the way it is riot fuck it. Just TAKE. OFF. THE. DECAYING. MS. 

He is a champion with NO DASHES. HE HAS ABSOLUTELY NO WAY TO GET ON TOP OF YOU OTHER THAN RUN AT YOU. FLASH IF HE HAS IT UP. THATS IT. LILLIA AND HECARIM HAVE THEIR OWN WAYS OF GETTING ON TOP OF YOU WITH PROLONGED MS BOOSTS. The fact that in order for me to get on top of a champ I have to blow my E awaken, to then do 0 damage and get bursted to death is SICKENING. Not to mention Q awakening blowing someone up is ENTIRELY situational. The cards need to align in your favor for it to work out. And god FORBID its a teamfight game. Your Q awaken is just useless. R used to have the utility, but they continually nerfed it until udyr was in the ground. So now we are stuck. 

I don't want to coin flip my usefulness on one ability awaken Riot. I pick one and then I'm useless until it's back up. Put more power into his base stances, take some power out of his awakenings to compensate. You've nerfed him, and his core items multiple times. Udyr is the only reason I even play your godforsaken game. Tighten up. 

  
TLDR: 

Give him Oldyr 1v1 potential again, make his base casts and base stats better. Q gets more damage, W gets more heals, R gets more damage, and a higher base slow. After the first 2 autos, they return to normal current udyr dmg, therefore still incentivizing stance juggling. 

Take the decaying MS off of E, or if you wont do that, revert it to pre nerf. 

To compensate the improvement to his base stats, nerf his awakening power relative to the power given to his base casts.

Q awaken less dmg, W less shield and lifesteal, E cc immunity lasts alot shorter, R slow and AOE either is slower, or does less damage, or both.

29F Ontario Canada 

2 years ago, I had my weight coming under control, I cut back my drinking, quit smoking, ate more healthy and stopped getting take out as frequently, got out of a bad relationship, moved out on my own, and I lost about 40lbs in just under a year. I felt great.

I haven't changed anything and if anything, drink even less alcohol, less coffee, increased my water intake, get out for more walks, do more activities, and pay attention to my overall health a lot better. I'm now up 60lbs since then.

Past year and a half or so, my health has been feeling like it has been declining. My gallbladder was removed to try and fix my indigestion, but it still persists. I've had an endoscope and a colonoscopy, both of which came back with a clean bill of health, other that mild chronic gastritis. 

Amylase and TSH came back normal, although t3, t4, and antibodies weren't included in the test. Any ""usual"" blood test always comes back normal too so nobody bothers to look any further.

I even went to the hospital not too long ago because I felt like someone tied a belt around my organs and was squeezing them as tight as possible. I couldnt stand, I was on the floor rolling in pain twice that night, it was the worst pain I have ever experienced. I called an ambulance to take me in. They ran some sort of blood work, saw nothing wrong, and sent me home. 

I have constant upper abdominal pain, face flushing and swelling for no reason, muscle weakness, appetite loss, my depression has gotten much worse, blood in my stool, yellow diarrhea, severe headaches that medication isn't helping, heavy brain fog and forgetfulness where I don't remember what I was talking about mid sentence,  constantly struggling to stay warm or to cool off between a couple degree differences, dizziness/loss of balance, easily winded taking a bag of groceries upstairs, difficulties waking up even after a full night of sleep, constantly waking up to pee through the night and struggling to go back to sleep, no signals of being hungry until I'm dizzy, faint, shaking, sweating, and nauseous. Fizzy sensations up the base of my skull that I can feel and hear (others can hear too), and maybe a couple of other things that I just can't think of right now.

I've been given migraine medication for the headaches. It has only helped the ones that were excruciating and debilitating and only enough to bring it down to a nagging pain. Usual daily head pain won't go away with OTC meds or migraine meds.

I've been given a rosacea gel to treat the face redness. The redness won't go away even with over a month of usage, and now it's actually causing my skin to flare up even worse and burn. I had to stop it, and now my face it back down to it's usual flushing.

I've been given Lansoprazol to treat the indigestion, and it helps for the most part, but I still upchuck a bit of stomach acid into my throat quite often.

I just want my energy back. I want to be my old self again. I'm so heart broken every time I hear to  eat better, be more active, just go to bed earlier. I am.. I'm doing my best, and I feel like I'm failing. I'm not winning this battle and I dont know what to do anymore. I just keep getting bigger, keep getting more pains, and I feel like I'm rotting from the inside out.

1gwxz6r,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gwxz6r/aitah_for_reporting_my_teacher_after_he_made/,AITAH for reporting my teacher after he made advances toward me?,"So, I’m in college and took this extra class that I thought would help with my major. It’s a small class, and the teacher, Mr. G (he’s in his 40s), seemed really cool at first. He’s one of those teachers who tries to be funny and act like he’s friends with everyone. At first, I didn’t think much of it it just seemed like his personality.

But a few weeks in, I started noticing that he gave me *way* more attention than the other students. He’d call on me in class even when I didn’t raise my hand, and he started making these little comments about me, like, “You have such a strong presence for someone your age” or “You’re going to go far, I can tell.” I didn’t know what to do, so I just sort of smiled and tried to keep things normal.

One day after class, he stopped me and said he thought I had a lot of potential and that he’d love to help me “figure out my next steps.” He suggested grabbing coffee to talk more, and I honestly thought it was about career advice, so I agreed.

But when we met, the conversation didn’t stay professional. He kept asking me personal questions, like if I was dating anyone, what kind of guys I’m into, and even joked, “I bet the guys around here don’t know how to handle someone like you.” I felt super awkward, but I didn’t know how to get out of it without making it weird. I left as soon as I could.

Then last week after class, he asked me to stay behind. He gave me this printed article he said would “inspire me” and started talking about how I’m “different from other students” and how he could help me achieve big things. While he was talking, he put his hand on my shoulder, and I froze.

Before I could step away, he leaned in and tried to kiss me. I was so shocked I just kind of blurted out, “What are you doing?” and pulled back. He looked flustered and mumbled something about “misreading the situation.” I grabbed my stuff and left.

I felt sick about it for days. I told my roommate, and she said I *had* to report him. I didn’t want to at first because I felt guilty like maybe I’d somehow led him on by agreeing to meet for coffee or not shutting down his compliments earlier. But after thinking about it, I knew what he did wasn’t okay, so I reported him to the administration.

Now, though, it feels like everyone in class is talking about me. Some people are saying I “blew things out of proportion” or that I “misunderstood” his intentions. A few even said I might’ve ruined his career over “just one mistake.” It’s gotten to the point where I dread going to class because I feel like everyone’s judging me.

So, now I’m questioning myself. Did I do the right thing? Or did I overreact and ruin someone’s life over something that wasn’t that serious?

What do you think? Am I the asshole?",139,1732244502.0,AITAH,72,0.97,False

I also needed to pick up a couple prescriptions so I headed there.  Stormi was in the front seat - I discovered that my sitting in the back with her keeps her from barking! 
My car has a cup holder in the door pocket, which is great for me having dogs that move around the car (I have a barrier now but I didn't used to). So, my cup is in the door pocket when I get to the pharmacy.  Go get my meds and come back to the car. While I'm inside I realized that it was past 5 p.m., so I could take my pills (which I'd brought along). Get in my seat, reach over to get my purse and I note that my cup is on the console, by the gear shift. The lid is laying slightly behind the cup. I think I'm imagining it, so I checked the door pocket.  Nope  - cup is not where I left it.  I lift a business card from the cup holder in the console, it's damp but not sopping wet. I threw it in the garbage and ask Stormi about the coffee while she nonchalantly looks out the passenger window.  
I started laughing hysterically,  and while I'm laughing she starts DRINKING the coffee she somehow poured into the console's cup holder! No remorse whatsoever for stealing mom's coffee!! Best part? No damage to the lid or cup. I wish I could have seen her moving the coffee cup... ",11,1732244424.0,greatpyrenees,1,1.0,False

*I worked Audit for two properties-one was in a seedy part of town and the other was in the heart of a College downtown area. My most memorable interactions usually occurred at the seedier hotel because it was located next to a* ***Motel*** *7****6*** *and known for being a drug hole.* 

*One night when I was working overnight cause my Audit didn't show up for their shift (I made a deal with my manager to have the following days off if I worked a double and she didn't have to come in). Everything was running smoothly for the first few hours as things wound down for the night. I didn't lock my front doors because I had planned to fix the barbecue areas' chairs quickly after my initial paperwork. Guy comes in looking around urgently before speed walking to the desk and asking for me to call the cops for him. I don't really push or ask questions so I call 911 and hand the phone over to him. He gives me some wild eyed look and takes the phone before crouching down so low that I couldn't see him just the phone cord. Okay-weird but I'll roll with it and go back to pulling up my school work to waste time on. He gets off the phone and speed walks out the hotel. 30 minutes down the road he comes back in practically out of breath telling me that there's a couple having* ***s e x*** *in the public restroom outside of Applebees. I tell him ' that's wild ' but don't elaborate because it's not like I work there. Not my problem.* 

   *Things get weird when he starts going into detail about how much of a* ***w h o r e*** *the woman is. How no self respecting woman would do that. How disgusting it was that they were doing it in public. Describing how he knows what their doing. Starts asking me if I would ever consider something as crazy as that or asking if I agree with him that she's a* ***s l u t*** *--> generally foul mouthing this woman and using very vulgar words. He also has a crazy look in his eye's that's really freaking me out. So I appease him and tell him he should confront them because I'm just trying to get him out my lobby so I can lock the front doors. He storms out with the plan to confront them-I scurry like a little rat to the door to lock it up before returning to my tasks.* 

*Roughly an hour passes I hear knocking on the glass doors. I investigate because I was making coffee in the kitchen area around the corner. It's the man from Applebees. I don't open the door but approach it and explain that I could not allow access to anyone who is not a guest or does not have a reservation with us. He's talking through the door ranting about the couple again and I apologize before addressing that I cannot open the door if he is not a guest with the hotel. He started pacing back and forth in front of the door between the front door and the door leading into the hotel (we had double doors so the middle part had carts and such) and disapearing into the night. I didn't hear from him again that night but I have 0 clues why he was so insistent that I would be the one to handle the situation???*",5,1732244125.0,TalesFromTheFrontDesk,4,0.78,False

I'm not sure about the best way to go about it.  I would assume I do a sanding and then stain the wood. However I'm worried that with sanding I'll damage some of the edges, and lose some of the nice straight lines. My friend that is more into woodworking suggesting I do a chemical removal of the finish, then do a light sanding, then stain, would that be the better option?
After staining I was considering putting on a polyurethane as this table gets a ton of use and liquid spilled all over it.

You’re at his “Venetian” VILLA, his grandma is ALIVE, he is VICTORIOUS, he is a possessed ASSASSIN with a heart of gold.

Why is this man not sneaking Rook out the back into the garden, whispering some sweet / spicy nothings, pinning them against the wall, and kissing Rook like they’re the air he needs to breathe. 🙏

Not sure if this is a Solasmance post, but like, I was deeply looking forward to something for my Rook that made me feel things. No one is the egg, but dark complex assassin could have been a nice distraction.

So first off I guess with just 16.5g coffee coming out (from the single shot button), I probably should've done the custom shot until 19g of coffee came out.. But any advice would be greatly appreciated. 

It didn't taste great as an espresso, I think was sour? (but I honestly struggle to tell the difference between a sour and a bitter espresso..)

New York City has an undeniable charm, no matter the weather. While sunny days might draw crowds to its parks and rooftops, there’s something magical about experiencing Manhattan on a rainy day. The streets glisten, the city slows down (just a little), and every corner feels cinematic. This is especially true in Chelsea, one of NYC’s most dynamic neighborhoods. Join me on a journey through this iconic area — a walking tour that uncovers the beauty, energy, and surprises of New York, rain and all.

https://preview.redd.it/hjfh8g8v8d2e1.jpg?width=3840&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a9f8cec954817ecb379d87db7151384cc13ae820

The Start: Chelsea Market

Our journey begins at Chelsea Market, a historic space that perfectly blends old-world charm with modern NYC vibes. Located in the heart of Manhattan’s Chelsea neighborhood, this former Nabisco factory has become a foodie paradise.

Walking into the market on a rainy day feels like stepping into a warm, bustling cocoon. The sounds of sizzling food, clinking glasses, and soft chatter echo through its industrial-chic halls. Vendors offer everything from artisanal pastries to fresh seafood — it’s a sensory overload in the best way.

A Coffee Lover’s Dream: Starbucks Reserve Roastery

Just a short walk away, I arrive at the Starbucks Reserve Roastery — a must-visit destination for coffee enthusiasts. This isn’t your average Starbucks; it’s an immersive coffee experience.

The Meatpacking District: Grit Meets Glamour

Leaving the Roastery, I head into the Meatpacking District, a neighborhood that embodies the perfect mix of grit and glamour. The cobblestone streets glisten in the rain, reflecting the glow of streetlights and boutique storefronts.

This area, once home to meatpacking plants, has transformed into a vibrant hub of high-end fashion, art galleries, and trendy restaurants. Even in the rain, the energy is palpable. Locals and tourists alike wander the streets, umbrellas in hand, as if the weather is just another accessory to their NYC experience.

The final stop on this rainy day adventure is the incredible Little Island, a man-made park that seems to float above the Hudson River.

https://preview.redd.it/jyhitkl09d2e1.jpg?width=3840&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8cc6e7e8e9862fab707c4377192eddef04d0e016

As I walk across the bridge to this architectural marvel, I’m greeted by lush greenery, winding paths, and breathtaking views of the Manhattan skyline — even with the clouds hanging low. The rain adds a serene touch, making the park feel like an urban oasis.

Explore the vibrant streets of Chelsea on a rainy day, and you’ll see why New York City truly is the city that never sleeps — even when the clouds roll in.

Two of these friends are from highschool and one of them is a friend that one of the highschool friends made that I'm now friends with if that makes sense. Friend 1, A, is becoming obsessed with weed. It's college, that stuff is everywhere, but she's CONSTANTLY high. Now, I know I can't say anything, cuz live your life I can't tell you what to do, but it's getting obsessive. She's had everyone else try it and the others do it occasionally but she's going crazy with it. She's the most chill and not really a problem. The problem is that she influenced Friend 2, G, into buying drugs. They were talking about it at lunch and G wanted to buy a vape. I went off, saying that nicotine is bad. G is also autistic and I can tell he's doing it to fit in. He got mad at me and said that it's his money but I don't want to be around someone that vapes. Different topic, Friend 3, J, is obsessed with finding a boyfriend. Shes on every dating app ever and is talking to a guy, V, who she really likes and has been talking to for 6 weeks but she wants him now and he's still in highschool so it's not working. He's dedicated to her but neither of them have a car and he's 30 mins away. She just hooked up with this OTHER GUY while V and her are ""not dating"" but still calling each other ""baby""???? I told her she made a bad decision and she got mad but we're chill now. My friends are making bad decisions and turning into people I don't want to hang out with. Here's the big problem, I don't know how to make friends. I've tried. I don't get it and it never works out. 

TLDR: one friend, A, is smoking weed and influenced another friend, G, into buying a vape. Friend J is ""cheating"" but not cheating on a boy with a different boy and I'm starting not to like their behavior but I don't know how to make friends. Help?

If someone could give me advice on making friends in college that would be great. I've tried asking them out for lunch or coffee and they always say they're busy or they have other people to go with. I live on campus. Thank you to anyone who helps 🙏",1,1732243343.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

I found exactly what was causing my reflux.,"So I’ve been having reflux for quite a while, 1-2 years or so. It started when I got to the ER for chest pain and was prescribed PPI.

I didn’t want to stay on PPI my whole life, so I tried everything: Pepcid, Tums, elimination diet… I removed beer, dairy, tomatoes, chocolate, sweets, well… everything.

I got tired of trying things with no results so I decided to cut the most difficult of them all: caffeine. And it worked. Before that, I replaced coffee for matcha, then replaced matcha for green tea or for some energy drinks but they all caused reflux because of one thing: caffeine.
I just cut caffeine for 4 days, stopped PPI and I got absolutely no reflux symptoms.

I’m not a healthcare professionnal, so I don’t advise you to go off PPI without consulting your doctor first, but honestly, if you’re a caffeine consumer, you should try completely going off caffeine. Not just reducing it.

We live in Ontario, Canada, I am using Canadian dollars. I am at a limbs end here, I have spent countless hours researching now and I’m not finding answers to every question. I am nowhere near an expert, I have only been at the searching game for a couple days, but I believe I’ve gotten a sound understanding of the difference in the bigger features every machine offers. I’ve visited stores, seen demos, watched reviews, but none of my effort seems to have led anywhere.

The primary reason all of my suggestions were shut down come to bar pressure. I understand it comes to individuals preferences, that averaging at 9 is ideal for a wide variety of people, but I keep hearing quite insistently from my family’s one complainer that “anything below 18 bar is water” and I’m rather upset by this- every machine I have found that promises as much flexibility, reliability, etc- works with (as advertised) 15 bar. This is the Breville Bambino plus, Breville Barista Express Impress, Rancilio Silvia pro x, and a handful of options that I did not get the chance to even get the name of as they advertise 9 as the default bar. I cannot express how adamant he is over the bar pressure, I am exhausted from hearing all of my suggestions shut down. I would love to have that particular idea explained to me, why some people like my one family member search for this higher pressure, especially how it would work with our preferred dark roast coffees. I want to get one machine that can keep up with all my family members’ individual preferences.

Secondly, I am fairly confident that we will be moving forward with the Breville Bambino plus because of the cost and features it offers. If the bar pressure truly has anything to do with the quality of coffee that comes out, what alternatives are there that can cater to as many differences in my family members preferences?

… Is there a machine (even if it’s of higher cost) that does not use plastic tubing but still offers the range in features and reliance I’m looking for? Im still okay with the Bambino pro, but.. I can’t find anything else.

I am also aware I have likely worded things in a weird way, I do not know much of the terminology and only loosely explained things that were hour long  conversations. I need someone who knows what’s up with these specific topics, hearing a few more options, opinions, and facts that fit our needs and can explain why we would need specific features would also be great.

Most dealers have a cute trick on getting around this by putting a photo of the vehicle's GPS system in the listing. For example this BMW listing shows the vehicle sitting on Wecker Rd near Secam St.

For the past 6 months, I've been dealing with this frustrating pattern where I wake up almost exactly at 3AM every single night. No matter what time I go to bed - 9PM, 11PM, midnight - I'm up at 3AM like clockwork.

The weird part is I don't feel anxious or stressed when I wake up. I just... wake up. And then it takes me 1-2 hours to fall back asleep. By the time my alarm goes off at 7AM, I feel like I've barely slept. I'm starting to dread going to bed because I know what's coming.

During the day, I'm struggling to focus at my office job, I've started drinking way too much coffee, and my workout routine has gone downhill because I'm too exhausted to hit the gym. I've tried cutting out screens before bed, keeping the room cold, using a white noise machine, and even melatonin which just makes me groggy.

Does anyone else deal with this consistent middle-of-the-night waking? Could it be related to cortisol or blood sugar? I know I should probably see a sleep specialist, but wanted to check here first to see if anyone has experienced something similar or has suggestions I haven't tried yet.

About a year ago, I was at a mutual friend’s party when I met Liam. He’s that kind of guy who looks like he just stepped out of a romance novel—tall, dark, and absolutely gorgeous. We clicked instantly. He was funny, confident, and seemed so genuinely interested in me. One thing led to another, and we started seeing each other casually. It was fun and exciting, but it always felt like there was something missing. I couldn’t put my finger on it at the time.

A few months later, I met Sophie. She was this insanely captivating, effortlessly cool woman I ran into at a coffee shop. We started chatting over lattes, and there was this energy between us I’d never felt before. It was magnetic. What started as casual meetups turned into something I couldn’t ignore. Before I knew it, I was head over heels for her.

For the first time, I felt seen. She was soft where Liam was bold, deep where Liam was fun. I didn’t know how to process it at first because I had never felt this way about a woman before, but I couldn’t deny it. So, I made a tough choice: I broke things off with Liam and threw myself into a relationship with Sophie.

Here’s where things get even messier. Just a few months into being with Sophie, I got accepted into a program to study abroad in Germany. It was a dream opportunity I couldn’t pass up, even though it meant leaving Sophie behind. She told me she’d wait for me, and I promised to stay in touch.

When I got to Germany, I focused on my studies… but then I met Jonas. He’s this ridiculously handsome German guy—like a literal movie star. He was charming, attentive, and made it clear he was into me from the start. At first, I tried to resist because I was still in love with Sophie, but eventually, I gave in.

Jonas and I had this whirlwind romance that felt completely unreal. We were inseparable. But in the back of my mind, I couldn’t stop thinking about Sophie. I stayed in touch with her, texting and FaceTiming constantly. She didn’t know about Jonas, and I didn’t have the heart to tell her.

After finishing my program, I came back to the U.S., hoping to figure out my feelings. Sophie was thrilled to have me back, and everything with her felt so natural and right. But here’s the kicker: I’m still in contact with Jonas. We text almost every day, and I know he’s still into me. To make things worse (or more complicated?), I just found out I might be pregnant. I haven’t told anyone yet, not even Sophie or Jonas, because I have no idea what to do.

If I am pregnant, I’m almost certain Jonas is the father. But I’m still in love with Sophie, and I don’t want to lose her. I feel like I’m living two lives—one with this amazing woman who makes me feel whole and another with a man who swept me off my feet in a way I didn’t expect.

So now, I’m stuck. Do I tell Sophie everything and risk losing her? Do I cut off Jonas and raise this potential baby alone? Do I come clean to everyone and just let the chips fall where they may? I feel like I’m standing on the edge of a cliff, and no matter what choice I make, I’m going to fall.

Has anyone been in a situation like this? How do you choose between two completely different kinds of love? And what the hell do I do if there’s a baby in the picture?",0,1732241838.0,story,0,0.5,False

Hi, Hello, Hey. Hope your evening is going well! I know you’ve been waiting for a post that isn’t like the rest of them so I’ll try to do my best. 

I’m using bullet points on my post because this kinda is like a resume, don’t you think?

• I spend most of my early mornings drinking coffee outside to brace for my day. 

• My career is a pretty hectic one that takes a lot of critical thinking and understanding complex situations. 

• Because of my career, I’m a pretty simple man on my days off. I enjoy my own company, the ability to appreciate quiet and the outdoors. 

• Most days if I’m not at work, you can find me in the gym or close to a pond fishing. 

• I have some pretty hot takes, the first being that socks absolutely do not belong in bed. Argue your point with me if you will. 

• Craft beer is delicious and I try to find a cool little brewery in every small town I go in. 

• Because of my love for craft beer, see my previous statement about the gym. 

• My love language is 100% making fun of you. If you can’t take it or are gonna take it personal, I’m not the guy for you. 

Let’s be friends, huh? Talk soon!",1,1732241706.0,R4R30Plus,0,1.0,False
