# SynaBoost Reviews

# How Does SynaBoost Work?

SynaBoost uses its herbal ingredients to enhance brain health and memory. These ingredients have unique benefits to offer, and as a combination, they work and fix six areas determining your brain performance.

These areas include reasoning, focus, memory building, accuracy analysis, learning, and concentration. These effects do not just magically show up after you start taking the supplement. It is a slow and gradual process that could take months. In addition to these, the SynaBoost pills can work on your mood and stress levels, making them better.

These benefits take a slow pace but become much more prominent after a consistent usage of months. The most likable part here is that these effects do not vanish when you stop taking SynaBoost, which is a common thing with most supplements and medicines. 

This formula works to heal the damage from inside, and not just the symptoms. That is why its results have a deep and long impact. No matter if you stop using the supplement after a few months, the results will still be there, making your life easier.

SynaBoost is a cognitive booster that promotes brain wellness. It improves thinking, focus, and memory with the help of its natural ingredients. People who are experiencing brain fog, forgetfulness, and concentration issues can start taking this supplement and see their cognitive health improving within months. 

Natural cognitive boosters have been popularized lately, and there are plenty of them available in the market. SynaBoost is a new addition to them, but it has achieved a very high customer rating within a short time, showing its amazing success rate. 

Here is everything that you must know about SynaBoost.



# SynaBoost Reviews

As mentioned before, SynaBoost is an advanced cognition enhancing formula made with plant-based ingredients. It makes your cognitive functions better, and as a result, you are able to perform better in brainy tasks such as thinking, analyzing, problem-solving, focusing, memory building, etc.

It can be used in routine, like a multivitamin, and could take a few weeks to show its results. There are no complexities involved in this product, and regular use of it can save you from age-related cognition loss in the long run.

# How Does SynaBoost Work?

SynaBoost uses its herbal ingredients to enhance brain health and memory. These ingredients have unique benefits to offer, and as a combination, they work and fix six areas determining your brain performance.

These areas include reasoning, focus, memory building, accuracy analysis, learning, and concentration. These effects do not just magically show up after you start taking the supplement. It is a slow and gradual process that could take months. In addition to these, the SynaBoost pills can work on your mood and stress levels, making them better.

These benefits take a slow pace but become much more prominent after a consistent usage of months. The most likable part here is that these effects do not vanish when you stop taking SynaBoost, which is a common thing with most supplements and medicines. 

This formula works to heal the damage from inside, and not just the symptoms. That is why its results have a deep and long impact. No matter if you stop using the supplement after a few months, the results will still be there, making your life easier.

# SynaBoost Ingredients

The ingredients of SynaBoost are shared on the official website. If you are concerned about them, take a look and see if this product is any good. 

Unlike other companies that are ruining after profits only, SynaBoost has nothing to hide. In fact, it takes pride in this formulation and makes it available to common people. You can even compare these ingredients with other cognitive boosters to see what makes this one better.

Following is the list of SynaBoost ingredients and their benefits for the brain and body.

**Green Coffee Bean**

Green coffee beans are loaded with caffeine, which has a natural stimulatory and energy boosting effect. It is in a safe amount so that the users actually receive the benefits and not just a jittery feeling. Caffeine also improves digestion and triggers a natural weight loss in the body, which are just additional benefits of  SynaBoost pills. 

**Theobromine**

It works on boosting energy and building focus by enhancing motor learning in the brain. Its neuroprotective effects can prevent neuronal damage and prevent the previous damage from worsening.

**Rhodiola** Root

Rhodiola root has an antioxidant effect on the body as it lowers oxidative stress, reducing its damage. Quercetin in rhodiola reduces inflammation and also enhances the bioavailability of nutrients in the body. Traditionally, it has been used to enhance cognitive functions, mainly attention span, brain performance, and memory.

**Rice Flour**

Rice is a famous dietary staple, but not many people know that glutinous rice has medicinal benefits, too. The rice flour improves brain flow in the body and brain, controls blood pressure, and lowers lipid levels. It also has a calming effect on the brain by controlling stress levels and reducing impulsive thoughts. 

**L-Tyrosine**

L-tyrosine is an amino acid that expands the natural learning markers. It also saves from degeneration of the brain, causing memory loss, especially in old age. Other benefits include hormonal support due to its helpful role in the pituitary, thyroid, and adrenal glands.

# [Click Here To Visit – “OFFICIAL WEBSITE](https://shorturl.at/uttMm)”✅_

**Bacopa Monnieri**

Bacopa has been a famous name in traditional medicine for many reasons, one of which is its role in cognition. It enhances memory and shortens the attention span and processing of information. It also calms the brain, making stress manageable and less damaging for the body.

**Huperzia Serrata**

Huperzia has many benefits to offer, but its action on neurons is remarkable. T enhances the levels of acetylcholine and makes learning, thinking, and remembering information easier. Further, it lowers the risk of dementia and Alzheimer’s in old age.

**Magnesium Stearate**

The last ingredient in this list is magnesium stearate, which acts as a protective barrier for the brain. It prevents damage and injuries, causing a permanent effect. Its benefits include making lifelong memories, helping the brain to think clearly, and removing brain fog.



# Dosage Guidelines

SynaBoost is an easy-to-use capsule that can be swallowed with water. There are 30 pills inside, making 30 doses, so the daily intake should be no more than one capsule. This one capsule is enough to bring the changes in your brain health that you desire. So, there is no need to overdose. 

There is no fixed time to take this supplement, and it can be taken at any hour of the day. For your own convenience, it is better to set a time every day so that the daily dose is never missed. Most people like to take it early in the morning so that they do not miss it if they have a busy day ahead.

It should preferably be used with a large meal. Do not take it in the morning if you are not a breakfast person; instead, take it after any big meal of the day. Never take it with alcohol, only water or juices are the recommended choices to be taken with it. 

If you are already on a medicine or using a supplement, make sure it is not taken with SynaBoost. Or there is a chance of experiencing a cross-reaction with the ingredients. Thus, take one supplement at a time.

SynaBoost is a cognitive booster that promotes brain wellness. It improves thinking, focus, and memory with the help of its natural ingredients. People who are experiencing brain fog, forgetfulness, and concentration issues can start taking this supplement and see their cognitive health improving within months. 

Natural cognitive boosters have been popularized lately, and there are plenty of them available in the market. SynaBoost is a new addition to them, but it has achieved a very high customer rating within a short time, showing its amazing success rate. 

Here is everything that you must know about SynaBoost.



# SynaBoost Reviews

As mentioned before, SynaBoost is an advanced cognition enhancing formula made with plant-based ingredients. It makes your cognitive functions better, and as a result, you are able to perform better in brainy tasks such as thinking, analyzing, problem-solving, focusing, memory building, etc.

It can be used in routine, like a multivitamin, and could take a few weeks to show its results. There are no complexities involved in this product, and regular use of it can save you from age-related cognition loss in the long run.

# How Does SynaBoost Work?

SynaBoost uses its herbal ingredients to enhance brain health and memory. These ingredients have unique benefits to offer, and as a combination, they work and fix six areas determining your brain performance.

These areas include reasoning, focus, memory building, accuracy analysis, learning, and concentration. These effects do not just magically show up after you start taking the supplement. It is a slow and gradual process that could take months. In addition to these, the SynaBoost pills can work on your mood and stress levels, making them better.

These benefits take a slow pace but become much more prominent after a consistent usage of months. The most likable part here is that these effects do not vanish when you stop taking SynaBoost, which is a common thing with most supplements and medicines. 

This formula works to heal the damage from inside, and not just the symptoms. That is why its results have a deep and long impact. No matter if you stop using the supplement after a few months, the results will still be there, making your life easier.

# SynaBoost Ingredients

The ingredients of SynaBoost are shared on the official website. If you are concerned about them, take a look and see if this product is any good. 

Unlike other companies that are ruining after profits only, SynaBoost has nothing to hide. In fact, it takes pride in this formulation and makes it available to common people. You can even compare these ingredients with other cognitive boosters to see what makes this one better.

Following is the list of SynaBoost ingredients and their benefits for the brain and body.

**Green Coffee Bean**

Green coffee beans are loaded with caffeine, which has a natural stimulatory and energy boosting effect. It is in a safe amount so that the users actually receive the benefits and not just a jittery feeling. Caffeine also improves digestion and triggers a natural weight loss in the body, which are just additional benefits of  SynaBoost pills. 

**Theobromine**

It works on boosting energy and building focus by enhancing motor learning in the brain. Its neuroprotective effects can prevent neuronal damage and prevent the previous damage from worsening.

**Rhodiola** Root

Rhodiola root has an antioxidant effect on the body as it lowers oxidative stress, reducing its damage. Quercetin in rhodiola reduces inflammation and also enhances the bioavailability of nutrients in the body. Traditionally, it has been used to enhance cognitive functions, mainly attention span, brain performance, and memory.

**Rice Flour**

Rice is a famous dietary staple, but not many people know that glutinous rice has medicinal benefits, too. The rice flour improves brain flow in the body and brain, controls blood pressure, and lowers lipid levels. It also has a calming effect on the brain by controlling stress levels and reducing impulsive thoughts. 

**L-Tyrosine**

L-tyrosine is an amino acid that expands the natural learning markers. It also saves from degeneration of the brain, causing memory loss, especially in old age. Other benefits include hormonal support due to its helpful role in the pituitary, thyroid, and adrenal glands.

# [Click Here To Visit – “OFFICIAL WEBSITE](https://shorturl.at/uttMm)”✅_

**Bacopa Monnieri**

Bacopa has been a famous name in traditional medicine for many reasons, one of which is its role in cognition. It enhances memory and shortens the attention span and processing of information. It also calms the brain, making stress manageable and less damaging for the body.

**Huperzia Serrata**

Huperzia has many benefits to offer, but its action on neurons is remarkable. T enhances the levels of acetylcholine and makes learning, thinking, and remembering information easier. Further, it lowers the risk of dementia and Alzheimer’s in old age.

**Magnesium Stearate**

The last ingredient in this list is magnesium stearate, which acts as a protective barrier for the brain. It prevents damage and injuries, causing a permanent effect. Its benefits include making lifelong memories, helping the brain to think clearly, and removing brain fog.



# Dosage Guidelines

SynaBoost is an easy-to-use capsule that can be swallowed with water. There are 30 pills inside, making 30 doses, so the daily intake should be no more than one capsule. This one capsule is enough to bring the changes in your brain health that you desire. So, there is no need to overdose. 

There is no fixed time to take this supplement, and it can be taken at any hour of the day. For your own convenience, it is better to set a time every day so that the daily dose is never missed. Most people like to take it early in the morning so that they do not miss it if they have a busy day ahead.

It should preferably be used with a large meal. Do not take it in the morning if you are not a breakfast person; instead, take it after any big meal of the day. Never take it with alcohol, only water or juices are the recommended choices to be taken with it. 

If you are already on a medicine or using a supplement, make sure it is not taken with SynaBoost. Or there is a chance of experiencing a cross-reaction with the ingredients. Thus, take one supplement at a time.

# Risks And Safety

SynaBoost is a plant-based Hula; therefore, it has a lower side risk than its chemical alternatives. Since this is an over-the-counter product, you would not require any prescription for it. But, it does not mean that you can ignore the guidelines and dosage while using it. The purpose of taking the supplement is to improve your intelligence, focus, strength, and energy. Using it in the wrong way or changing its dosage can alter these results completely, defying the purpose of using it.

There are no harmful chemicals, toxins, fillers, or allergens inside; therefore, it has no damaging effect on the body and brain. No customers have reported any side effects, showing that there are none. It is safe for everyone who needs a little brain boosting effect.

Only adult customers can use it as it is not a child-friendly product. Also, if you are pregnant or breastfeeding, using a supplement without your doctor’s supervision is not recommended. If you are experiencing any unusual changes in your body caused by SynaBoost, stop taking it and contact your nearest healthcare provider.

since my teenage years, worked on it a lot over years. Not drinking alcohol really, no smoking, even stopped drinking coffee to avoid. I’m quite healthy going to the gym, eating healthy, taking vitamins. So keep my panic attacks under control. After years first time, I had a panic attack at work. I had a discussion with my senior coach, about the workload, told her since 2 weeks I am struggling so much and I do not have enough time to complete all the tasks, but she kept told me things needed to done, I told her that I was aware but workload was intense. However, we ended the call, I tried to focus on work but lost it for a moment, all of a sudden thought about people having heart attacks at work place due to stress. Then boom, I triggered my own gun. I tried to go to the restroom, tried to calm there a bit. Went back to the desk, I just felt like couldn’t breathe at all, quickly informed team I am having panic attack at the moment have to get some air and left the office, I was about to explode. Went to the bathroom, cried 15 mins out of breathe, tried to calm down went outside for a calming tea.

And went back to the office (only to entrance to sit there) My manager called me, he was worried about me, and told me others as well. I told him that I was sorry I didn’t want to leave the desk this way. Tried to explain myself but my body was still under too much tension, I was losing words while speaking, couldn’t even complete a sentence. I feel embarrassed to having to had this.

Not sure how will I look to managers maybe I can’t handle stress well which I normally do but this week was madness. ",1,1728994558.0,Career,0,1.0,False

1g466mt,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g466mt,Thursday Boot Co. Black Label - Challengers in Black Teacore Horserump from Maryam Tannery ,"**INTRO**

These are Thursday's take on the PNW boot and I finally got them in yesterday!! I had some shipping delays just like a lot of others with this release but luckily my pair found their way home! I placed my order the morning of the 26th on release but didn't get a proper shipping update until the 10th I believe and that was after some back and forth with customer service. In the end it all worked out and I'm more than pleased with my purchase. These are GORGEOUS boots!!! 

**LEATHER**

I ordered my challengers in the teacore horse rump from Maryam to match my teacore jeans from pure blue japan. The leather is a beautiful oily black over a clean veg tan with slight texture from the grain. No calipers so I can't give a perfect measurement.. But with my tape measure I was able get about 3mm thickness on most parts of the leather. Some spots closer to 2.5mm and some spots closer to 4mm. This is some burly shit. The leather heel stack and welt are dyed and burnished a dark coffee brown for an almost tonal look. One thing I think is cool about the leather is that in direct sunlight they have slight brown tint to them. I'm a big fan of the black/brown combo. They also come with a set of long leather laces, teacore dyed to match, and 2 seperate sets of cord laces (short/long). I can't wait to see how these patina! 

**FIT**

I ordered these in the same size as my 2017 Captains, size 11D. Oh boy, these fit like a dream! Just perfect right out of the box. Foot slid in with little resistance, heel locked in nicely, and toes can wiggle, I'm a happy camper. The full leather and cork insole/shank/midsole is stiff at first but it feels like it should have some give and mold to my foot properly. The chunky lug sole doesn't help with the stiffness but I'm loving how rugged they are. Definitely not a fashion boot. I'm also loving the tall logger heel, helps me feel balanced and stable in my step. The vamp around the forefoot is probably the snuggest part of the boot but I have a high instep so this not unusual for me. Overall I'm so psyched on my pair! Excited to put these to work!

I (22F) have been with my (21M) boyfriend for over a year now, and for the most part everything has been amazing, but recently I have felt as though I’m no longer a priority.

Last year when we were both in college, I was an incredibly busy person. I was in a sport, Greek life, student senate, theatre, I ran a building for reslife, worked another campus job, and student taught. Despite me having all of these things going on, I would tell him about a meeting, event, or rehearsal time, and he’d remember after being told once. He also used to randomly surprise me with flowers, and a coffee which he no longer does.

He is in his last stretch of college, and I now work as a teacher. We are in the same town, so we see each other quite regularly. Starting in August, it has seemed as though something has shifted.

He no longer remembers dates and times the way he did last year, and I haven’t been surprised with flowers since July. (He did get me flowers on my first day of school in August, but it wasn’t a super big surprise, because he forgot when my first day was, and I was super upset so that was his way of apologizing.)

When I originally posted this someone mentioned how he could have ADHD. It’s super possible that he does, and he is trying to go get tested. I personally have ADHD, my brother has it, and I also specialize in teaching students who have ADHD skills and strategies for the classroom. When my boyfriend started forgetting dates and times in August, I started texting the information and verbally telling him.

I even found an interactive calendar that sends reminders of events. For awhile he wasn’t using it, but we sat down yesterday and really honed in on the importance of it, as recent events have left me feeling hurt.

For example, last week was parent teacher conferences. I told him at the beginning of the week that I had them Thursday and Friday. I texted him the dates and times, and even called him about it Thursday morning to remind him. Thursdays conferences were alll day until 8:30, and I made sure to make it very clear that I would be unavailable until 8:30. He still forgot, and CALLED ME DURING A CONFERENCE at 3:45. My phone was on DND, so he had to double call. He didn’t even text me first to check. He just forgot what I was doing, although it was in writing and verbally said to him. He even texted me at 6:30 asking what I was doing, as if I didn’t text him earlier saying I was in conferences until 8:30. He forgot the next day too when I would be getting off, but that was less of an issue. The bigger issue of Friday was when I was off, and I told him I was wanting to get my nails done, so he told me to set the appointment, and he’d take me. (I cannot drive due to having low vision). As soon as I set the appointment, I texted him the time and took a quick nap. When I woke up it was 30 minutes until my appointment, and he hasn’t answered, so I called him twice, texted him a few times and I got no response. I cancelled the appointment so I wasn’t taking anyone’s spot, and I texted him about cancelling the appointment. 20 minutes after the appointment would have started, he texted me saying he would have taken me had I not cancelled. In that same text he said he just woke up. I get napping, but telling someone you’re gonna do something, and not being responsible enough to set an alarm is incredibly immature in my opinion.

Every time he does something that I feel reflects disinterest, or lack of effort I talk to him about it. I always explain how I feel hurt, and ask him if there is anything I need to know, or do to make things easier.

I do not feel I need to practically beg my boyfriend to remember dates and times, as well as constantly remind him that his actions are hurting me, when they are repeatedly occurring. The examples I gave are only recent. This has been happening for three months straight.

Would I be the asshole if I ended things because of this? How should I proceed?

I do love him, and I can’t imagine my if without him, but I also don’t want to be with someone who is consistently putting less effort than before, and disregarding my time.

I set out to do 48-hours minimum and 72-hours maximum and started it at 1:30 pm on Sunday with a final meal of 3 eggs and steak followed by a pint of ice cream. 

**Approach.** I made sure to buy mineral water and soda water. I added some pink himalayan salt for electrolytes. I also drank black coffee on the morning of Day 2 and Day 3. The general consensus online seems to be that black coffee doesn't break your fast. 

**Day 1 and 2 (first 30 hours).** My major meals are normally at 6:30 pm for dinner and 1 pm for lunch. So around these times corresponded with the largest peaks in hunger which was clearly the hormone ghrelin. I found the first 24 hours relatively easy as I am used to doing fasts of this period. However, coming near the end of the first 24 hours is when I started finding it a lot more difficult which was around 1:30 pm on Monday. I was anticipating that between this time and nighttime would be the most difficult period so I drank about a litre of soda water over this period which helped somewhat suppress hunger. I was thinking about food a lot, fantasizing over what I was going to have when I finish. It took me a bit longer to get to sleep on Monday evening as I felt a bit more energized and I did wake up a few times during the night but I felt very well rested when I did wake up Tuesday morning. 

**Day 3 (38 to 53 hours).** I made a decision over coffee in the morning that I would break that day around the 48-hour to 50-hour mark. I did continue until 53 hours before breaking it. Over coffee in the morning, I felt quite weak and lethargic and decided that it would be best to break it that day given that I was also recovering from a virus. However, I did want to extend beyond the 48-hour seems as I know it will be a long time before I consider fasting this long again. I heard a lot of reports that once you get over the 48 hour mark, it gets easier because you feel less hungry. Although the pangs of hunger weren't too bad, I was thinking about food a lot until I broke the fast, pretty much obsessively. I found it difficult to focus and was mainly trying to keep somewhat occupied with some work and research to ride out the last few hours. I don't know if it gets easier beyond this point but in my experience, the overall fast keeps getting more difficult the longer it goes on. This may be a mental thing or it may my body craving for glucose as my walking around weight is quite lean already.

**Breaking the fast.** I did quite a bit of research on the best way to break the fast and it seems that the approach to breaking the fast may be as important as the fast itself. I considered a lot of different options and I ultimately broke it with two soft-boiled eggs and about 80g of smoked salmon. I will eat another meal before I go to sleep of steak, 3 eggs, and greek yogurt. Tomorrow, I will get back to normal eating.

**Vitals.** I had a doctor's appointment early Tuesday morning and I got my blood pressure and heart rate checked. My heart rate was 45 bpm whereas it is normally around 55 bpm. My blood pressure went to 117/80 compared to previous figure of 106/68 from a week ago when I wasn't fasted. I don't know if it is normal for your heart rate to decrease and blood pressure to increase fasting.",1,1728994163.0,fasting,1,1.0,False

1g4629u,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1g4629u/rf_clouds_the_boy_that_flew_by_yonathanj/,"[RF] Clouds, The Boy That Flew, by YonathanJ","In a tiny village lodged in the mountains sprouted a boy named Clouds. Even as a baby he would gaze upward to the passing clouds, his eyes filled with wonder. Extending his hands and naively trying to grab the clouds, he would giggle, in his father's arms.  

Growing up Clouds would spend most of his time alone, staring at the passing clouds, daydreaming, much to his father's distress.  

''You see, son, a man's duty is down here! The ground, the earth, soil and crops, duty! Not the damned clouds...''  

Yet despite his father's attempts at guidance, Clouds enjoyed all that was sublime and beautiful. The water snakes flowing down the cliffs, falling hundreds of meters, their aura blessing the boy's eyes with rainbows. The lush trees waving in the wind of the valley, the music of the windchimes of the neighbors, the geese flying high, their feathers sometimes ending up in Clouds' hands.  

Rushing to his uncle's house, the boy held tight the feather, looking up to the sky at the birds flying by. Pushing the door open Clouds saw the man, sitting in front of a half-painted canva, holding his brush and mixing paint. Clouds walked toward him, looking at the painting, admiring its pale blue and the small green line at the bottom. ''Uncle, I found another!'' the boy said, surprising the painter, that turned around.  

''Well then, my boy Clouds, throw it on the pile!'' his uncle said, a bright smile on his face. There in a big box, a few dozens of feathers or more, of geese and eagles and other birds, that Clouds collected. The boy came back to his uncle and looked closer at his half-finished painting, asking ''what is this painting about?''  

Uncle brushed the boy's hair and told him that it's a secret, and hefigure it out once he's ready. The boy looked at the canva, to shades of pale blues and almost white grays, and he smiled brightly. Right next to them, a big window, letting in the sun at times, that was shaded every so often by the tall, massive clouds passing by. From where they were, Clouds and his uncle could see the edge of the village, leading to a fenced cliff, overlooking the valley far under. Beyond the valley, plains and small hills, and high above them, rolling by, more clouds, filling the whole sky of their abstract, beautiful presence.  

Rushing outside Clouds laughed, making his way to the edge of the cliff, just to get closer to the clouds. He sat there, looking toward them, his mind in effervescence, forgetting about everything, forgetting about himself as he always did when cloudgazing. Bolting by him, a lone sparrow, flying at incredible speed, as if racing toward the distant clouds, toward the sublime, and Clouds laughed in amazement, an idea budding in his mind. He concentrated on the bird until he lost it in the distance. So focused he was he didn't notice that it flew right into the biggest and tallest cloud there. Taking it all in Clouds took a few steps forward, as if attracted by the clouds, dangerously walking toward the edge of the cliff, lost in his daydreaming.  

A hand grabbed him violently by the shoulder, bringing him back to earth. Turning him around, the hand cltuched the boy's chin and there right in front of him the face of his father, his eyes bloodshot, with a panicked look on his face. Without saying anything, his father dragged him away from the cliff and hugged him very dearly. Clouds felt his tears flowing on him, he couldn't breathe so strongly his father held him.  

''I told you not to get lost in your mind, boy!'' his father whispered, scolding him. Clouds noticed his father never called him by his name, and asked him why, but he ignored his question. Instead he grabbed the boy's hand and placed something in it. ''Here, focus on this instead.''  

Seeing the worried look on his father's face, Clouds started crying, without even realizing it. He opened his hand and in there, a big acorn. The boy laughed through his tears, and saw behind his father, his uncle running toward them, still wearing his apron, stained with the same pale blue as the sky above them all. He was wiping his hands with a white handkerchief, leaving bits of the sky on it. He tucked it in his belt, and Clouds stared at it, as the fabric waved in the wind, coming close to falling off at every breeze.  

The two brothers talked and talked, shouted a bit, while Clouds sat there, not really understanding why they were so angry all of a sudden. His uncle had a sort of defeated look on his face. He kneeled down to Clouds and told him that he'll be working on his paintings, and that they won't be able to see each others for a bit. Getting back up his uncle shook his brother's hand and made his way inside. His handkerchief fell at last, flowing in the wind, to Clouds' surprise. The boy let go of his father's hand and ran toward the piece of fabric, catching it just in time.  

In his father's arms Clouds stared at his new treasure. The white piece of fabric had a few stains of pale blue paint here and there, and the more Clouds stared at it, the more he could see the abstract beauty of clouds, as if this accidental, meaningless thing captured, in a way, the essence of clouds, the idea of clouds, the divinity of clouds. More than any painting ever could, than any brush and will could.  

Back home the boy was scolded and lectured and grounded, yet he still didn't understand why.  

That evenening, as the sun was setting, Clouds sneaked outside. In his right hand, the acorn his father had gifted him. In his left, the handkerchief his uncle had lost. Looking up, the boy saw a cloudless sky for the first time. Just a pale blue, for the infinite, higher than everything, forever.  

Yet the boy saw, up there, the same sparrow he saw earlier, and from the lone bird, the sky bursted in shades of white and beauty, and at once the idea he had took shape, took form, took hold of him.  

Clouds' dream would come true, no matter how unlikely.  

The very next day, in the early morning, Clouds asked his father a most unusual question. ''Tell me, father. Why do we do the same thing everyday?'' His father looked at him, biting his bread and drinking his coffee. ''What do you mean?'' He said, putting his cup on the table, and crossing his arms, staring down at his boy.  

''Well you farm everyday, and I go to school everyday, and I visit uncle everyday, and you scold me everyday...'' Clouds managed to say, his voice a bit shaky. His father took a few seconds to think, then replied with a serious tone, ''We're lucky to have what we have, boy. It's comfortable to be happy..''  

These words left the boy silent and pensive, so much so that he forgot the clouds for a bit. It's comfortable to be happy. What does that mean?  

Back at his uncle's house, Clouds entered without knocking, as usual. He knew he couldn't come see his uncle for a while, but he had to ask him a favor. As usual, the man was sitting at his chair, working on his painting, that was coming along incredibly. Sipping on his tea, his uncle took his tiniest brush and, getting closer to the canva, held his breath, to add just a tiny, imperceptible bit of paint to the edge of one of the clouds.  

Clouds couldn't help but laugh at how silly this all was, to his uncle's surprise, that scolded him for a moment, saying he shouldn't be here. But the boy didn't mind. He asked if he, too, could paint. For the very first time.  

Teaching him the very basics, his uncle perpared everything. The many tubes of paint, the tiny pallet, the canva, right there beside him. Sitting there Clouds took a brush, put it back down, and used his fingers instead, to mix the blue and the white. Taking inspiration from his cherished handkerchief the boy opened his mind and painted, with his fingers and his palm, making a mess of everything, yet curiously the canva was coming alive. His uncle watched, washing his brushes, and at last Clouds was done.  

On his canva, not the perfect, meticulous recreation of the clouds like his uncle, no, but a raw, smeared representation of the clouds. And it was beautiful, in its own way. Clouds was sitting there, white and blue paint all over, on his hands and his face and some on his clothes too. In a way, he became clouds himself.  

And everyday Clouds would meet with his uncle and paint, always of clouds, yet of different shapes and forms. After a few weeks of this, Clouds was washing his hands, and he couldn't help but confide in his uncle.  

''You see, uncle, I have one memory, from when I was a baby. I remember so clearly... I was looking at the clouds, but I really thought I was the clouds, and so happy I was. Until I saw my hands, reaching for them. And I saw the ground, my father's face, and the world...''  

His uncle listened, not saying anything, but taking it all in.  

''I think, before all this, I really was the clouds...'' the boy added, looking down to the ground, clutching his own fingers, fidgetting with them.  

''Uncle, please, help me with something! We'll need some wood, strings, all the feathers I've collected, and so much more...''  



Standing alone, in the grass field, as the sun was rising in the horizon, Clouds let go of a deep sigh. In his left hand, the acorn his father gave him. In his right hand, the handkerchief of his uncle, its blue and white, perfect to Clouds.  

For weeks now, the boy had been pestering neighboors, friends and strangers for any feathers they may stumble upon. Clouds' passion intrigued a great many, wondering what in the world that boy would do with so many feathers, and what could cause such a glimmer in the boy's eyes, upon recieving them.  

Standing alone, in the grass field, Clouds closed his fist on the acorn, and threw it, aiming for the top of a nearby hill, onlooking the whole village. Wiping his tears with the handkerchief, the boy walked back to his uncle's house, ready for the big day. On his face, a bit of blue, the same blue as the sky up above.  

The sky up above, strangely without any clouds, for many many days now. Never before had Clouds seen such a vast and empty sky, for so many days in a row. So much so that the boy had taken a habit of no longer looking up to the sky, for his cloudgazing, but looking at his paintings, and his uncle's paintings, of their hundreds of renditions of clouds.  

Yet their sight only stirred something deep within Clouds, a yearning, a need, a prophecy, of the clouds, gone for who knows why.  

Gone, the clouds, passing by, blessing any and all with their majesty, with their ephemeral beauty. In its place, the overwhelming vastness of the blue, this, inverted ocean above everything, or perhaps we were under it, poor villagers, looking down to the vastness, the blue vastness, wondering where the white elementals have been, when would they reappear, if they would..  

To much distress, dismay and resolve, Clouds hurried his steps to his uncle's house. The sun was barely rising up, and everyone was still fast asleep. Except for his father, Clouds thought. He knew his father was already hard at work in his field, sowing and reaping and plowing. He knew as well that his father would expect him, would wait for him, as he did every day. Waiting for his troubled son, Clouds, to come and learn his trade, learn to work the earth, to no avail.  

Clouds had made his choice. Entering his uncle's house, without a sound, the boy tip-toed to the room where they kept all their paintings. Madness, is what that room was. Its walls, covered in countless clouds. Masterpieces of detail and realism, mixed in with the more hastily painted ones of Clouds, sometimes only abstract smears, and other times intricate shadows and lights, ideas given form, immortalized, yet no matter how great they were, mere lies compared to the truth, to the real clouds.  

A skylight let the shy sun rays intrude, shine on the paintings, landing in the corner of the room, where a wooden apparatus laid, that Clouds grabbed. He brought it outside, and laid it flat on the ground, inspecting it.  

Two large wings, made of hundreds of wooden sticks, strings and even more feathers were protruding from a central wooden pole. The whole thing was as big as Clouds himself, and would be secured nicely after tying the necessary ropes and strings around his torsoe and arms.  

How he wished to be able to see himself, wearing at last the wings he and his uncle spent weeks imagining and creating. Clouds flapped his wings, the force surprising him, lifting him up, making him lose footing. A big smile on his face, Clouds ran toward the cliff, onlooking the blue horizon. He took out the now worn out handkerchief of his uncle, and tied it around his forehead.  

Clouds pushed down the old fence, blocking the cliff, and ran toward his uncle's house, his heart beating faster than ever before.  

Above him, more of these sparrows, flying around, some perched on the house, onlooking the boy, as if waiting to see what would happen.  

Clouds took a breath in and out, looked up, behind, thought about his father, and his silly acorn that he threw away. He thought about his uncle, and touched his headband, his smile enduring, yet curisouly, more of those tears he sheds some times, without knowing why.  

His little heart overflowing, Clouds raced toward the cliff, the tears leaving a watery mist behind him, and leaping off into the great emptiness below, Clouds flapped his wings, with all his force, propelled upward with much more force than he expected; he laughed and shouted, rising up, the wind catching in his wings, he stretched his arms, crying ever more.  

Down there, this green plateau, stuck between mountains, this place where he was born, and where he spent all these years, yearning for the sky, to become one with the clouds.  

Up there, this vast, blue void, begging to be filled with the majestic white of idealism, with the sublime and the beautiful, with the temporary wonder one inevitably gets when staring at distant clouds, on a bright day; the mind quiets down, and time idles subtly, and the awe of the naive child resurfaces briefly, bliss, the blissful Clouds, now impossibly far away in the distance, losing himself in the emptiness of it all, losing himself as he saw them, at last, and they saw him too, and they embraced each others, and became one, much akin to two drops of water merging, swiftly and naturally, and at last Clouds, the boy that flew, reached it, his truth,  

His Truth.  

And all his life, all his thoughts, and dreams, and hopes, his ideas, coalescenced in one, a maelstrom of white and blue, of distant sun rays, of further even green lands, of a second home, and once again, one last time, finally, at last, clouds, everywhere, forever.  



At the very same time, the village awoke. Everyone stepped outside, upon hearing a man, claiming that feathers were snowing, yes!  

It was Clouds' father, that was looking for him.  

All searched for Clouds, as the hundreds of feathers kept on falling on the village, the barren blue sky above, herald of a disaster. Uncle stepped out, and suspected what had happened, the unthinkable. He broke down, falling to his knees, onlooking the broken fence near the cliff, onlooking that handkerchief there on the ground, waving in the wind.  

For too long, the echoes of a broken father could be heard in the village. ''Clouds! Where are you, Clouds!'', until plenty others joined in with the search. They ended up at the field, where Clouds was a few moments ago. Standing there, atop the hill where the acorn landed, Clouds's father fell to his knees, as he looked up, realizing at once that the barren sky of the last few weeks had been filled with the greatest, the biggest clouds ever seen!  

The father, and all the other villagers sat down on the ground, upon witnessing the gigantic clouds on the horizon, flying in from strong winds, its incomprehensible size leaving all speechless, until the uncle walked up to them, holding the handkerchief, telling all that Clouds had gone to fetch the clouds, his voice breaking.  

He had taken flight, to bring back the beauty, to go back to the sky, to bless us all in his apotheosis, Clouds. All chose to believe that, so much so that it became the truth.  

And so, every year, the Clouds festival would start on that very day, and everyone would throw feathers in the wind, and scream at the top of their lungs, for the clouds to come back, for Clouds to come back, for Clouds!  

And without fault, the clouds would come back, their overwhelming majesty inspiring even the most stern and stoic of people. Clouds' father nurtured the tree that grew from the acorn he gave his son, and grew old and content, taking naps under it, cloudsgazing. He died happy, leaving behind a vibrant culture of hope and idealism.  

He joined back his son, and plowed the clouds together at last, blessing the fields with their rain, joining in the end the real and the ideal, smiling up there in the very clouds that shaped their lives, for better and for worse.

Here's my take on this: once I knew what he was actually saying ""...AND MY BED AT 3:00."" it reminded me of something I heard my Gma say. At the time she was working in a Ramada for housekeeping and they used the hands on a clock to reference the company's expectations of what a properly made bed should look like. Once I googled ""making a bed in the 3:00 position,"" ai generated the response I've attached. This guy, he's simple. In that he isn't all about a bunch of muss and fuss. Whiskey neat- just pour that ish straight outta the bottle. Coffee black- forget about add ins. Who has the time/patience for all that?? And the bed at 3:00- a simple, clean bed. No frills or unnecessary clutter. Her being ""too sweet"" for him just implies that he thinks she's too complicated in one way or another.

What pushed me over the edge and drove me to write this post this morning is I had tomatoes from the yard that had some dirt on them. The dirt dripped off onto the countertop and after less than 10 minutes left a stain.

When it first started happening, we called the manufacturer and they suggested that for all of these minor stains we use barkeepers's friend to buff it out. 

I will say that it does work. The problem is that we bought quartz for what was supposed to be a non-staining and durable surface but now are struggling With having to worry about any kind of drip immediately after it happens, constantly cleaning it two or three times and regularly buffing out stains that shouldn't be there in the first place.

# Show Me the Money: How to Profit from Whitelabel AI

Alright, let's get down to the nitty-gritty. How can you turn this into cold, hard cash? I've got a few tricks up my sleeve:

# 1. The Subscription Hustle

Set up a monthly subscription service. Offer access to all these AI tools under your brand. Start small, maybe $47/month, and scale up as you add more value. With just 100 subscribers, you're looking at a cool $4,700 monthly. Not too shabby for letting AI do all the work, eh?

# 2. The Agency Upsell

Already running an agency? Perfect. Use these AI tools to supercharge your services. Charge premium rates for ""AI-enhanced"" offerings. Your clients get better results, you do less work, and your bank account gets fatter. It's a win-win-win.

# 3. The Productize Play

Take one of the AI apps, specialize it for a specific niche, and sell it as a standalone product. For example, create the ""Ultimate Real Estate Description Generator"" using the ChatGPT killer. Realtors will be throwing money at you faster than you can say ""open house.""

# 4. The Affiliate Avalanche

Build a comparison site showcasing all these AI tools. Use your affiliate links for the original products (ChatGPT, Midjourney, etc.) but offer your white-labeled version as the ""budget-friendly alternative."" Watch the commissions and sales roll in.

# 5. The Consultant Con (Kidding, It's Legit)

Position yourself as an ""AI Implementation Specialist."" Use these tools to help businesses integrate AI into their workflows. Charge consulting fees plus a cut of the increased revenue or cost savings you bring them.

# How to Use This Beast: A No-BS Guide

Enough theory. Let's get our hands dirty. Here's how to use Whitelabel AI without breaking a sweat:

1. **Log in**: Use your credentials to access the dashboard. Don't forget them, or you'll be locked out of your money-making machine.
2. **Choose Your Weapon**: Pick the AI app you want to use. Whether it's content creation, image generation, or code writing, it's all at your fingertips.
3. **Customize**: Slap your logo on it, change the colors, make it yours. This is where you transform from a reseller to a ""tech company founder.""
4. **Set Your Prices**: Decide how much you're going to charge. Don't be shy – people pay big bucks for AI these days.
5. **Launch**: Use the ready-made sales pages or create your own. Start driving traffic and watch the sales notifications roll in.
6. **Rinse and Repeat**: The beauty of this system is scalability. Launch one service, then another, then another. Before you know it, you'll have a full-fledged AI empire.

# My Journey as a Beta Tester: From Skeptic to Believer

When I first got my hands on Whitelabel AI, I was skeptical. I've seen my fair share of ""revolutionary"" products that turned out to be duds. But boy, was I in for a surprise.

I decided to test the waters with the ChatGPT killer. I rebranded it as ""ContentGenius"" and offered it to my existing email list of small business owners. The pitch was simple: ""AI-powered content creation at a fraction of the cost of hiring a writer.""

Within 24 hours, I had 17 sign-ups at $97/month. That's $1,649 in monthly recurring revenue from a single email. I was floored.

But it gets better. One of my clients, a real estate agency, saw what I was doing and asked if I could create a custom AI tool for property descriptions. I used the Whitelabel AI platform to whip up a specialized version in about 2 hours. I charged them a $2,500 setup fee and $500/month for ongoing access.

In my first month as a beta tester, I generated $7,149 in new revenue with minimal effort. The best part? The customers were thrilled with the results, leading to word-of-mouth referrals.

This isn't just a product; it's a business multiplier. And trust me, I've only scratched the surface of what's possible.

# Money-Back Guarantee: No Risk, All Reward

# Price Tag: A Steal of a Deal

Let's talk turkey. The frontend product is just $14.95. Yeah, you read that right. For less than the cost of a large pizza, you're getting access to a suite of AI tools that could potentially generate thousands in revenue.

# Bundle Deal: The Smart Way to Go All-In

If you're serious about making this work (and why wouldn't you be?), consider going for the full bundle. Yes, it's a bigger upfront investment, but hear me out:

1. You get all the OTOs at a discounted rate
2. You're fully equipped to tackle any AI challenge

Solace Cafe down by the quay co-op in the Next Step building is good. Someone I know was struggling with loneliness and some mental health stuff so they tried it and they liked it. 

It’s a free service. The staff are sound, they just chat with you or help you find other supports if you need it. Plus, you get free tea, coffee, and biscuits, so it’s a good place to just hang out if you’re feeling a bit isolated and they're cool with that. 

You don't need to be diagnosed or referred. It’s open to anyone struggling. They don't ask for any proof of who you are or anything. The person I know just gave them their name and phone number to book an hour but there was nothing stopping them giving a fake name even if they wanted to.

If you’re feeling shit or know someone who is, it’s worth giving it a try. 

Sure it's free for fuck sake

I was turned down and she said she wasn't interested in a a relationship right now because she has a lot going on. I told her I understand and hope she wasn't offended I asked. I thought that would be it, but since then she has invited me out many times 1 on 1. We don't define them as dates, but in my opinion they feel very date like. For example, we grab coffee, go to the theater, hang out at the mall, or just walk around the city or local park. We usually talk about topics way past surface level too.

One time we were grabbing coffee and our conversation got really deep, beyond what I feel friends or coworkers would talk about. She started with randomly asking what's my type. It kinda caught me off guard because I feel like that's a strange thing to randomly ask if you're not on a date. I shared what my type was. It wasn't her because she's not normally my type, she also shared that I'm not normally her type. She then proceeded to ask if I knew which of the 16 personalities I was. Again, I thought strange thing to ask if it's not a date. I told her I wasn't sure, and then she shared hers being ISTP. Then she asked about my relationship with my parents/family, I told her for the most part we're all pretty close. She then shared how she's not super close with her parents as they always fought and argued growing up. She said the problem is that her dad drinks way too much, it's hard to even have a conversation with him. 

In my opinion, I think we both have an interest in each other, but I feel like based on what she shared she has an avoidant attachment style as it seems she's hesitant to fully commit to a relationship and gets a bit upset when people assume we're dating. There have been times where I feel like sometimes we'll grow closer but then she'll suddenly pull away and not talk for awhile then come back randomly. Basically she becomes hot and cold. Is it best to just give her space when she needs it and how do I know she needs space? Is it even worth trying to pursue anything other than friendship with her? I feel like I really do love her more than a friend so I'm just wondering how to proceed going forward. Regardless, I do still want to be part of her life whether that's dating or just as friends.

I want to react maturely and without alienating the people I live with.

So, I (24F) live with 3 other people. I’d been living in the same house for about 2 years with a rotating batch of roommates. One of the current roommates ( We’ll call him R, 20M) has lived with me for a year, and the other two have moved in semi-recently ( within the last month or so). 

While I don’t know the other two very well quite yet( 22M, 20F), R and I made pretty good friends when he initially moved in but over the year have butted heads enough times that I no longer feel that sense of camaraderie. His style of humor centers around “playful bullying” and while I can banter and sometimes enjoy this type of humor he’s pushed at my boundaries with his “jokes” to the point where it isn’t funny to me, it just feels mean. I’ve gotten upset enough to ask him to stop making fun of particularly a few insecurities of mine in front of others and he’s said I’m “limiting his personality”. Since then he’s been hot and cold with me. He will very rude to me only to be exceptionally kind later on after being rude; though will seldom apologize for any rude behavior unless other people are involved to scold him. He also has a tendency to make decisions for the household (moving unofficial subletters in namely) without asking or clearly communicating, which has also caused tension in the past. It’s clear to me at this point that he doesn’t respect me. For a while I let it go because at the end of the day, neither of us could afford to move from the home when the lease needed to be re-signed and I wanted to keep the peace. 

A few months ago I left town for a few days to visit friends and R tried to get rid of a piece of furniture of mine and replace it without talking to me. 
Although I could’ve gotten on board with potentially replacing this piece of furniture, I was really put off by the fact that they felt so comfortable getting rid of something that I’d spent my hard earned money on, as I’d also prefer to try to sell it first rather than just throw it away. I also didn’t see anything wrong with the piece of furniture but it wasn’t his aesthetic and he’d start to loudly complain that he “hated it” shortly before I left despite the fact that it’s a pretty neutral piece in terms of style. The only reason he didn’t go through with it is that he got scammed by the person who was selling him the new piece of furniture; not because of any objections I had. 

While I know it’s not necessarily a big deal it definitely made me extremely anxious as there were also a few other things he wanted to do to the common space (without communicating) that I certainly wouldn’t have agreed to that one of my old roommates ended up halting.

So fast forward to now, I’ve only known the other two  for a month and they seem nice enough, I get along with them pretty well and was hoping to turn a new leaf in the apartment culture. They’ve both been exceptionally helpful in getting the apartment to a good spot in terms of both cleanliness and their willingness to work to improve appliances and share amenities. I can’t overstate how much I have appreciated this and truly want to take that into account. I also want to make them feel comfortable in the home as well and do not want to commandeer the space.

Since I’ve lived there the longest, naturally a lot of the living room decor is mine and I’ve gotten quite a bit of art hung up on the walls, and one full length wall piece on one wall that a dear friend of mine painted as a mural. While I understand not everyone has the same taste, no one has expressed any dislike of these pieces or the mural to my face ( they’ve complimented them before actually ) and I would’ve been receptive if they had expressed distaste and tried to work out something where we can all be happy. 

Two weeks ago I had to leave and go back to my home country due to some family issues. I figured while things would probably still be shifting while the new people got settled in, I just didn’t really expect the following. I know for sure that during the first week I was gone they decided to replace a small loveseat of mine- they told me about it- as one of them found one they all liked more online. No big deal as I can find space for it in my room; but I didn’t really feel the need to replace the current one, the new one isn’t really my taste, and had to chip in on the new one when I don’t necessarily have much money to spend. 

The next batch of changes were not communicated to me, but instead I’ve got bits and pieces on social media. I saw that they’d taken down some of my artwork in favor of shelves, possibly gotten a new couch ( the last couch wasn’t owned by me entirely and was a bit broken so understandable), possibly gotten rid of my coffee table and most notably that they’d reoriented the living room so that the furniture (tv stand, bookshelf) is on the wall with the mural on it, in front of the mural. I don’t really love the changes honestly as far as I’ve seen, and no one has told me that any of this other stuff was happening. Though I don’t know the full story quite yet since I’ve been away, I have a gut feeling a good chunk of this change has been initiated by R. It also seems they’ve all bonded quite a bit while I’ve been gone so I feel like I might not have a leg to stand on regarding the changes. 

Like I’ve said, I really want the others to also feel at home and be able to decorate the living room as they wish as well. I care more about the peace than anything. I just wish that a lot of this would’ve been communicated to me so I can somewhat take part in the decisions being made especially re: moving my items or obscuring the mural or if this perhaps could’ve waited two weeks until I came back home. I’m heading home tomorrow and am deciding if I should say something about my discomfort or if I’m being irrationally anxious and should let it go. WIBTA if I drew boundaries around moving my things while I’m abroad?

I always had a really really tight group of friends, we've known each other since childhood, it was one of those friendships you can only dream off, we grew up together. But as you might have guessed it’s not like that anymore. I guess after giving birth in my late twenties, not a lot of my friends could emphasize with me. Most of them were still figuring life out, while I felt like I found a different perspective. We don’t talk anymore, they haven’t seen my kid or even congratulated me on having her. I made my peace with that but I crave friendship. I’m lonely, I don’t know how to find new friends. 
A lot of time I’ll watch golden girls and be on the edge of tears because I really really want a supportive group of girl friends. I want to take walks I want to sit in coffee shops with our kids. I just want someone to go to pottery class with. I dream of finding that but I don’t know how. I think there is nothing more beautiful than female energy.

1g45fxq,https://www.reddit.com/r/dpdr/comments/1g45fxq/lets_find_a_cure_based_on_factors_tell_me_what/,Let's find a cure based on factors. Tell me what triggered your dpdr.,"Hi, Please share you story , so went can know how to treat dpdr based on different triggers, personality, symptoms. Please contribute.

 I want to know what triggered your dpdr. 
Please tell what could be the reason, what type of a personality do you have. What symptoms do you have, do you take meds, do they help, irrespective of they work or not tell us which meds are you taking,name them.

Be as descriptive as you can. I am trying to look at a pattern. So that we can find people who have similar symptoms,triggers to talk to eachother to find out what works. As every person is different and different treatment works on them.

I will go by telling my story.

So it's been 3.5 years with this dpdr. I recently found out that this is not depression and anxiety which many doctors diagnosed me as. I took many meds, antidepressants, anti anxiety, lithium, mood stabilizer etc none worked, only clonazepam benzodiazipine gives temporary relief. 

What triggered me:

So I was feeling depressed, couldn't seem to enjoy anything in life, was having existential crisis thoughts, questioning what's the purpose of life, everything is predetermined so what's the purpose of doing anything. It was affecting me and my mood I even tried to go to my govt hospital but it was COVID so everything was online except emergency. Then I went through two panic attacks which I never had in my life before. I was 22years at that time. Then one night on 9th March 2021 I had a mug full of coffee which started my palpitations and it wouldn't go away. It started bothering me so much that I tried to reassure myself going through YouTube searching if this was normal and is it something I should be worried about.
I used to feel anxiety but this time it was distrubing me physically because of the palpitations.

The trigger(panic attack): 
And then suddenly I had the worst panic attack I could ever imagine. I thought I am dying, everything became out of control, as if I am in another dimension,it lasted for atleast 15mins, I screamed madly at my brother and mother to take me to hospital. I literally felt like dying.
Then when the panic attack was gone. I was at hospital. Psychiatrist told me it was nothing just panic attack.They did ECG everything was normal. I went home relaxed. When I woke up I felt anxiety, my mind racing as if neurons are constantly being fired, I couldn't understand what was happening, I felt as if my mind is going through physical change. It was very distrubing. I couldn't feel anything.just anxiety and headache and very strong buzzing affect in my mind. For four days my parents didn't take me to doctors because of bad experience my mother had with psychiatrists, she didn't believe in them, bcz they made her condition worsed, later I found out that she had the same thing, and it got worse buy meds.
So after taking some unani medicine which is ancient Greek medicine for four days nothing helped. I begged them to take me to the hospital. The doctor diagnosed me with depression, gave me clonazepam a benzodiazipine at that time and I instantly felt normal, but since 3.5 years I have been taking them and nothing helped. 

About my mother story and I think mine is genetics:

Had experience a panic attack when she was the same age as me, and she says she felt something changed after that panic attack she felt weird. With that was extreme anxiety. For a year she took allopathy meds which is antidepressants and anti anxiety which made her condition worsed. She then went for a ancient Greek medicine according to her it cured her in a year and she felt postive change in weeks. I think it went on its own. I asked her if she felt depressed during the days before the panic attack like me and she said no. But she said he used to think a lot about everything. Renumating 

Some background:Since childhood I was very nervous and anxious as a kid. Had social anxiety, had intrusive thoughts, always questioned philosophically, I knew that this is what not most people feel, this thoughts and this constant anxiety, I always had upset stomach when English period came and was frequently taken to school clinic bcz the English teacher was very strict and thinking about it gave me anxiety.

1g45f26,https://www.reddit.com/r/Agoraphobia/comments/1g45f26/what_is_working_for_you_and_what_isnt_what_is/,"What is ""working"" for you and what isn't? What is helping you get your life back? What is motivating you to keep going and doing the work needed to recover?","If you are recovered and still here, what has helped you most?

I am on my 4th serious attempt at recovery. Previous attempts have failed because I had a setback and simply gave up for months and I ended up back at square one. In short, I've been doing my best for the past 7-8 years,

Right about now, I am about 1 year in my current attempt, and I got a LOT better but I am not even close to where I want to be. I cannot say this is the best I've been in years when it comes to doing things, but when it comes to my attitude, I am pretty sure I am.

  
What is working for:

* **Exposure**. Sometimes I do it the way it should be done, that is going into situations you fear no matter how you feel. But other times I just leave the home for the sake of leaving home. For example, I can easily take bus/tram/trolley rides and go to the city center. Have a drink, eat out and so. I can pay the bills, do shopping and a lot of other things. Yes, that is good, that is called ""life"" but at this point it is so easy so it boring and seems pointless. Yes it all adds up, but doing this without pushing myself and doing what I truly need to do is NOT helping me much. **What does help is actually going for exposure (even if it is something I can do easily) and doing it 12 times a week! That is, every week, I go out 6 times in the morning and 6 time in the evening.** Staying for 2-3 hours or sometimes more. THIS HELPS A LOT, it keeps the momentum going and even if I only do things I can easily do, if I go out 12 times, I got extremely bored doing that. So, it helps me push some more, and then I end up doing challenging stuff.
* **Listening to podcast, like an hour or more per day, and reading book for 30+ minutes per day.** I stick to the same podcast and the book by the same autor because it helps me stay motivated. When I do not feel like it, reading and listening to WHY I need to do this hard work, sure helps!
* **Identifying triggers:** This is quite simple and effective because it points me into the direction I need to go. For example. I avoid doctors, dentist, hairdresser and similar situation. What is common in those situations? It is me being TRAPPED, unable to escape when I CHOSE TO do so! Since those are the situations when it would be really awkward to just leave (although not the end of the world) what can I do to PRACTICE being stuck? I started with public transportation, trams are easier the buses because when you are in a tram, stops are closers, and there is no traffic jam or anything. You go in, you are ""stuck"" for a stop and you go out. Rinse and repeat until you build confidence to go much further. EASY TO SAY, SIMPLE TO DO, BUT EXTREMELY HARD TO DO! That is what got me going. It took me MONTHS of doing this before I was confident in taking buses. Other way to practice was going to coffee bars, ordering stuff and waiting for waiter to get me was extremely difficult in the beginning. But, over time it got super easy. There is also another way I could make this harder for me. Like, if I pay as soon I get my order, anxiety is much lower then if I wait until I am about to leave. Also, having exact amount of money to pay with is much easier than having larger bills. It took me a lot of practice but I can easily sit now with large bills, have a tea, or even eat out. Next trigger, it is not much the ""distance"" from home, but it is more like going far from home and NOT BEING ABLE TO GO HOME WHEN I CHOSE TO. This is pretty much the same as the first trigger, because I also feel trapped. For example, taking bus rides to destinations that are not practical to go back home on foot by walking and where you have to wait for the next bus. Missing the first bus back and staying longer is much harder, but that is where practice eventually get you to. Over time, every situation is supposed to be the same because I am not afraid of any of those situations, but of how will I feel when I am STUCK-TRAPPED. There are some more triggers, but this is number one and it probably is for all of us I guess?
* **Having a RECOVERY NOTE:** That note is something where I write important stuff related to exposure and that I try to re-read as often as possible. Like, how this is hard work but I have to do it anyway. Or: Every time I am about to step out of my comfort zone and do something new/challenging I will experience plenty of apprehension anxiety and have so many ""I can't do it"" thoughts. That is normal and expected. Or: I am supposed to be afraid, that is why I am doing this in the first place. I am not taking bus ride to this or that place for the sake of being here, I do not care about that, but I am here to practice being uncomfortable, anxious, afraid, and panicky. And so on...

What never worked for me:

* **Exposure hierarchy.** I've tried writing those so many times always thinking it will do me good this time, but it never did! The reason for that is, I (we) am not afraid of particular situation or place, I am afraid of the way I am going to FEEL and the way I am going to THINK when I am at those situations. Plus, it is extremely difficult to write exposure hierarchy for most of the things. Like, I never got diagnosed, nor have I been to doctor/dentist in over...pretty much 20 years! I cannot see a way I could design a hierarchy for going to doctor for example. I've tried going to ""Center for mental health"" that is what we have here, and sitting in front of the doors, without giving any of my documents or anything is not anxiety producing! I feel there the same I do at home. However, the next step is pretty much going all in! Once I give my documents away, that is it. I will have to wait being called in. For me, I can ALWAYS somehow see myself leaving the situation and leaving the documents behind and everything (despite NEVER doing it in the past when I did similar stuff) and that is like end of the world for me. It should not be, because I can always have my sister pick up the documents for me, but nope..my brain sees it as the worst possible thing that could ever happen to anyone. I also avoid any similar situation. So, writing exposure hierarchy is very impractical. I guess, I am contradicting myself with what I wrote about triggers, but what I wanted to say is that I cannot write a list for one situation and stick with it. It is much easier for somebody with fear of dogs to write their hierarchy and stick with it. For me, it is not that simple. I have to identify my triggers and see what makes me uncomfortable in that situation or to completely avoid it. Once I do, I take that trigger and find situations that I can practice that, like I've written above.
* **Working with thoughts:** This is also one of the things I've tried more times than I would like to admit. Always believing and expecting I can do it and expecting this to be some kind of magic cure. In theory, it sounds wonderful, but I was never able to stick with it and never will.
* **Avoidance.** Do I need to say anything more? Waiting to feel better or the feel like doing it never works. Because, no matter how long I delay taking action it is always the same.

I guess I could write some more stuff if I really think this through, but I just felt like sharing it and listening to what you have to say.

New here and I must say after reading some of your horrendous experiences mine may seem small in comparison but it's been going on since March and I'm just so so tired as it constantly impacts my sleep. Just keen to get any advice/information I can. Willing to try anything at this point. 

About me, overweight (working out 4-5 times a week now), 36 years old. I have a fairly busy/stressful day to day life with a couple of small kids and a fairly tough job and these things are so much harder when you're exhausted. Back in March I caught Covid and I am certain it was where my issues began as I had a persistent cough ever since. The cough was so bad that I pulled a back muscle a couple of times and was brought to tears with the agony and had a visit to A&E because the slightest cough or sneeze was like being stabbed in the back. Bit of an issue when you have a persistent cough. 

Eventually with regular stretches and cough symptoms easing (but never leaving) the back pain has gone thankfully. My cough has decreased and went from being all the time to mostly night time and early morning. When I lie down I often have a crackling sound coming out of my throat, the sound and feeling is horrible and a cough stops it briefly. I've realised that food definitely plays a part and after seeing a few doctors who initially thought asthma, the last one thought it could be GERD, silent reflux. I have no issues breathing, I don't get stomach pains, I don't notice any acid reflux at all, but the crackling is there every night, only question is whether it is really bad or sometimes OK if I've been good diet wise. 

I am also having horrendous hay fever symptoms all the time, but not sure if they are related. Even now in mid-October if I don't take a hay fever pill I will wake up after an hour with a running nose + GERD crackle/cough and together they just beat me up. 

I had a brief stint of medication from the doctor but I'm not keen to take any on a long term basis if it can be avoided. I'm exercising regularly, I've removed tomato based dishes from my diet to reduce acidity, I've reduced my coffee, trying to reduce times I eat, trying to go longer without food to give stomach a rest. We eat a lot of organic stuff, we make our own bread etc. If I'm good it helps but after more than 6 months I'm scared I'm never going to get back to the way I was. It feels like every night I get slightly less sleep than I need and over time it is wearing me down. 

I'm even trying acupuncture now - though after 3 sessions that's not made any difference I can see either. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, sorry to all those with worse symptoms - some of you would probably kill for my version of it but I am just looking for any advice. Has anyone just had the crackling/cough with no other symptoms? Have you found anything that works permanently?

I have gone off Humira twice, and both times the brain fog went away. Also the brain fog goes away in the a last day or two before my next dose is due, i.e. when the last dose is wearing off. All this to say, it seems very clearly due to the Humira.

My question is: I want to be able to stay on the Humira because it's otherwise effective for me. But the brain fog it gives me is so hard to live with.

So two of my friends are now aware of my tea obsession and want a tasting/education session on Gongfu tea, tea culture, history, processing, science, etc. I'm well versed in explaining these things and hosting people for tastings but usually we just have one tea type at a time, or compare two teas of the same type.

These two friends are a speciality coffee roaster and a fine dining chef, so their tastes will likely be more discerning. As such id like to have a service of three tea types to give them a better idea of the spectrum of flavour profiles, brewing apparatus, etc. that are out there.

If you had to choose three tea types to serve in such a situation, what would you serve to represent a wide spectrum of flavours and aromas? I will have examples of all 6 tea types available for them to at least smell the dry leaves, but was thinking of actually drinking just 3.

Early on I'm thinking:

* White or Green (probably Bai Mu Dan, or Longjing)
* Black or Oolong (Probably a Dancong, Jin Jun Mei, or an unsmoked Lapsang)
* Shou Puerh (being coffee people they are very excited about the prospect of a fermented tea)

Guess Rancilio saved material and the filter holder is lighter. Therefore the handle got heavier and pulls the filter out of the bracket.

1g44xpv,https://www.reddit.com/r/dubai/comments/1g44xpv/living_on_the_palm_jumeirah/,Living on the Palm Jumeirah,"Having spent the last 4 years as a realtor here, I've gotten to know this crazy island pretty well. Here's the lowdown, broken down by the main areas:

**The Trunk: Where the Party's At**

*The Good:*

* **Never a dull moment:** Seriously, there's always something going on here. Restaurants, bars, beach clubs... you name it. Perfect if you're up for a spontaneous dinner, a wild night out, or just chilling by the beach with a cocktail.
* **Everything at your fingertips:** Need groceries? Pharmacy run? No problem! The Trunk has all the essentials, so you can skip the trip to the mainland.
* **Bumping into your neighbors:** The Trunk has a real community vibe. Don't be surprised if you see familiar faces at your local coffee shop or while you're out and about.

*The Not-So-Good:*

* **Traffic can be a pain:** Especially during rush hour and on weekends. Be prepared to crawl at times.
* **Things can get loud:** With all the action, the Trunk can be a bit noisy, especially at night. If you're a light sleeper, earplugs might be your new best friend.
* **There are lots of people around.** The Trunk is the busiest part of the Palm, so it might not be your ideal spot if you're looking for peace and quiet.

**The Villas: Living the Dream (with a hefty price tag)**

*The Good:*

* **Your own private paradise:** Imagine stepping out of your villa and onto your own private beach. Yeah, it's that good. Ultimate privacy and tranquility, right there.
* **Space to spread out:** Villas on the Palm are huge! Think private pools, massive gardens, even home theaters. It's like living in your own resort.
* **Feeling safe and sound:** Gated communities and 24/7 security mean you can relax and enjoy the peace of mind.

*The Not-So-Good:*

* **Prepare your wallet:** Villas are pricey, both to buy and rent. This is definitely a luxury lifestyle.
* **Upkeep can be a hassle:** Maintaining a villa takes time and money. Be ready to deal with gardeners, pool cleaners, and the occasional repair.
* **Can feel a bit isolated:** While the privacy is amazing, some people find the villa communities a bit too quiet.

**The Crescent: Chilled-out Apartment Vibes**

*The Good:*

* **Jaw-dropping views:** Get ready to be wowed by the Dubai skyline and the Arabian Gulf. The views from the Crescent are simply stunning.
* **Beach life is the best life:** Most apartments here have direct beach access. Morning swim, anyone?
* **Peace and quiet:** The Crescent is way more relaxed than the Trunk. If you're looking for a chilled-out vibe, this is it.

*The Not-So-Good:*

* **Not many shops around:** You'll find a few things, but for a bigger shopping spree, you'll need to head to the Trunk.
* **Long drive to get anywhere:** The further down the Crescent you live, the longer it takes to get off the Palm.
* **Less of a community feel:** People tend to keep to themselves in the apartment buildings. It's not as easy to meet your neighbors here.

**Bottom Line**

The best place to live on the Palm really depends on what you're looking for. Want to be in the thick of it? The Trunk is your spot. Dreaming of ultimate privacy and luxury? Go for a villa. Want a balance of chill vibes and convenience? The Crescent is calling your name.",2,1728989892.0,dubai,3,0.6,False

Zero changes to prevent intruders… it got me face to face for the 1st time & I’m not having it. ,"My facility is basically in a forest on top of a mountain next to a huge community hospital. There are no outside cameras, no motion sensor cameras, no security, no security cameras, nothing. We’ve already had a few cases with the police involved and we’ve complained and nothing has changed. 

21 male part time CNA. Working 10pm I’m in my hallway speaking to other CNA’s and I hear a very clear but distant voice saying “hey you can you get me a coffee x3, you a bitch”. All my residents r females except for 2 dudes but they’re passed out, maybe I’m trippin. Couple minutes later in our back parking lot (can’t see much cuz it’s covered by trees) we hear a car alarm go off for a couple of seconds… nobody parked back there. Instantly go tell the nurse and we start checking rooms to lock the doors. Some residents are allowed to leave their sliding door open and/or unlocked because they like the breeze I guess..? For some stupid reason I went into every single pitch black room without turning on a single light because I didn’t want to wake them up and I come to find out how stupid I was for reaching for the handle of glass doors. As we go through rooms I enter a resident’s room who doesn’t like their sliding door open. It was open by 6 inches already. I approach the door and I hear a single crack of a leaf and I go running back out the room into the hallway and so do all my other hallway CNAs. I run back into the room and start yelling at whoever’s there that they aren’t allowed to be here and they have to get the hell away. As I’m reaching to slam this door shut I see a silhouette of the guy just standing there, just 2ft away from me on the other side of that glass door, reaching for the handle and still and I managed to close it and lock it. Run out the room, minute or so later we hear a resident and a nurse scream in a couple rooms down as he was trying to get into that room aswell. Don’t fucking know why but I’m pretty sure ONLY up until this point the cops are called… few minutes later we see headlights in that back parking lot assuming that this intruder is leaving. The cops come in a timely manner and I am questioned by an operator on the phone and whoever was in charge. And you know what’s crazy. Is that they took my information down but didn’t even give me their business card, went ahead and gave it to some other CNA who wasn’t even there to witness everything they were on the other side of the facility. And they just left. I called later during NOC asking the nurse to give me the business card information and they said they didn’t know where it was. And said that they will contact me when they find it. I was never contacted. I go in on a day off, ask about business card and case number and DSD couldn’t get me that information, but the administrator has that information. I have still yet to get it. But I’m under the impression I can just ask the police department lol. 

I really don’t know what to do. Do I get the case number and business card info on my own behalf? Do I just go straight to an ombudsman? What can an ombudsman do about this and how do I contact one? Do I go look for an attorney like wtf? I don’t know who to ask about this because I do not trust anybody. Amongst my colleagues I believe that I am the only person to think this far. As I am trying to ask those who were around me to speak up, they’re scared that they’ll look stupid or lose their job. I am essentially alone in reporting this. 

This is not normal right…? I’m under the impression (personal assumption) that they aren’t telling the residents families about this because like. Who tf wants to keep their loved one here knowing that ANYBODY can damn near can just walk in like that, and on multiple occasions too????? It was so stupid of me to think of the residents first instead of myself in my case. The guy could’ve had a weapon, he could’ve swung that door open and done anything, charged in, went n hurt other people, maybe even killed me idk lmfao. Anything could have happened, but I got so lucky with my fight or flight reaction. I haven’t been able to sleep that well, I can’t look into a dark corner without chills being sent down my back (I’m already scared of the dark LMFAO), I hear any car alarm I will literally freeze or spin around to look for it. I would be lying to myself if I didn’t have any psychological effects to this. And this fucking sucks because like being a CNA is already fucking terrible. But I was like the only guy on the floor, nobody was stepping up to protect these residents, in a crazy what if I basically risked my life for someone who doesn’t even know my name, I’m playing fuckin security and a poo scooper for $22 an hour bro.

I am going on holiday with my partner in 6 weeks and I want to take things up a notch to drop those pounds I gained and generally feel and look my best in a bikini on the trip. What would you recommend?  

I started properly exercising about 4 years ago, going on runs and trying out weightlifting. However I would say I have only been consistent for the last year. I do progressive overload with weights in the gym 4/5 times per week, pilates once per week, and try to get a walk in to get my steps up to 10k most days (sometimes it's way over, sometimes it's more like 6/7k.) I lost a stone Aug 23-Jun 24, however over the summer I put a few pounds back on after being on holidays with friends and enjoying eating and drinking. I am currently going through tests/waiting on scans with my GP about hormone/period related issues so sometimes I feel that holds me back.  

I eat around 70-90g protein per day, get 7-9 hours sleep per night, drink 3L water, eat vegetarian with a focus on whole foods. I cook from home 99% of the time unless it's a special occasion like a friend's birthday dinner out. I have had disordered eating in the past (binge/purge) so I don't want to be too intense about calorie counting although I try to estimate and eat mindfully.  

Typical day of eating looks like this:  
Breakfast: Protein yoghurt with berries OR wholemeal rice cakes with cottage cheese.  
Lunch: Homemade vegetable soup, sometimes with one slice of wholemeal bread.  
Snack: Coffee with soya milk, clear whey isolate protein drink.  
Dinner: Tofu stir fry, chickpea and aubergine curry, bean chilli or similar.  
Dessert: Low cal fruit jelly or a square of two of dark chocolate, or fruit.

Year was 2018,

Like many bangaloreans, I was also working in a big IT company as a software professional. On the 8th floor of our office space, there was our ODC for around 100 team members and adjacent to us there was another smaller, separated sound-proofed  space for a dev team from the company. Although separated by glass but I could always see them. Let's call them the ""Cool Team"".

You know, I used to envy those dudes, show up at any time. They had dedicated car parking spaces and most of them would come in SUVs. Complete freedom in taking any electronics devices inside, even their interior was premium with window facing seats.

Within the first day of my joining itself I started hearing a buzz for this Golang language developed by Google. How it's the next best thing and only the best hires from IITs and NITs are working on it. Mind you, the company was primarily C-sharp and Java speaking because that's where most of the enterprise work was happening at that time.

Turns out ""Cool Team"" was a big proponent of Golang. I would often meet the ""Cool Team"" members at terrace coffee tables and would ask them about golang. Almost all of them would ask my tech background, account and would laugh at me for working in outdated Microsoft techstack. Weird thing was they would never get technical with me on performance, learning,  benefits etc. However, those conversations felt like a typical terrace talk with typical ""tech leads"" nothing unusual. Later I got to know ""Cool Team"" had huge influence within company and everytime a budget was allocated for some company related software or service they would go nuts to make sure it's written in Golang. Claiming dozens of "".....ity"" in company emails.

 No one questioned the cool team!

If you were  in a big IT company back then you would know how terrible these internal Intranet and in-house products & services were. No company was exception. However, the things built by this ""Cool Team"" was extra shitty and would stay in outage for days. But this time, we lost the biggest client due to frequent server outage of the servers in our office.There would be heated arguments during technical presentations over c-sharp vs golang. 

 ""Cool Team"" would say we lack Innovation!

Few days later, I came to office and saw the whole ""Cool Team"" chairs empty. Thought to myself, oh another team retreat. Then opened my laptop and got to know the whole ""Cool Team"" was suspended and wasn't allowed to touch company infra  until external audit is completed!

It was a BIG news!

After the external audit, all senior members were suspended without pay and junior team members reshuffled & kept on bench with salary hold. So turns out they were misusing huge amount of company funds with super inflated salaries and expenses , that even put me to shame with 100% hike after last switch. Mind you, I was one of the top hires in my account on special client requirements and part of the company code audit team. Anyways,  most of them switched, one or two caught legal notice. That was it!

Fews days later when the dust settled, I was sitting in the office and saw the empty chairs and thought to myself. 

If somehow... , if somehow I spoke golang I would have been living like a king!
Self audit for golang speakers, spend company money as you like!
No interference from C-sharp, Java speakers who are doing the actual grinding!

I don't why I wrote this story on this sub-reddit to you folks. 

Anyways, need to work on accumulating funds for my Gym.
Still a long way to go!
My client is on holiday without paying us, so I m here writing this.

I have always had an other worldly connection to the unknown/unseen ect. 
I’ve been working at a gas station for about 4 months now… 
This gas station had an accident where somebody passed away just outside.
The person was going there for a specific reason and I will get to that more…
At first I heard that the night shift worker believed there was a ghost there…
I started doing nights on my own and I soon understood what they meant.
I was cleaning some milk jugs in the sink and I felt something hit my leg with some force to it, I then turned around and here was a little ketchup packet on the floor behind me.
I then had another experience the other day where an ice cream scooper got thrown right off our coffee machine.

So the person that passed away was going to the gas station for an ice cream and was struck by a car as they were pulling into the parking lot.

That event happened back in 2014 so I believe if they’re stuck there, they’ve been stuck in this space for exactly 10 years now 

I’ve heard a lot about souls getting free, once they’ve completed what they were supposed to do at their time of death…
Or even that an area can hold a memory long after death and that it can be freed 

I believe that the spirit is trying to tell me to get his ice cream for him, to free him.

Could this be the case and could I free him by doing so?
Just simply by buying him an ice cream and take it over the road to his memorial?

How do I go about releasing the spirit from this space? Because I sure as hell would hate to be stuck in a space for eternity let alone 10 years…😕

Would my idea do anything?
How would I know that I have freed him?

I’m sorry if this is too long 🫤
I just really want to help this dude!

If you were getting this, would you be happy with it? Or would you prefer plain chocolate? 
For Halloween season, should I change it up and bake some small gingerbread biscuits? 
Would love some feedback please. 
I personally love mint but I know it’s not everyone’s thing so would love any comments on this. Thanks! ",13,1728988509.0,CasualIreland,6,0.93,False

I have always had an other worldly connection to the unknown/unseen ect. 
I’ve been working at a gas station for about 4 months now… 
This gas station had an accident where somebody passed away just outside.
The person was going there for a specific reason and I will get to that more…
At first I heard that the night shift worker believed there was a ghost there…
I started doing nights on my own and I soon understood what they meant.
I was cleaning some milk jugs in the sink and I felt something hit my leg with some force to it, I then turned around and here was a little ketchup packet on the floor behind me.
I then had another experience the other day where an ice cream scooper got thrown right off our coffee machine.

So the person that passed away was going to the gas station for an ice cream and was struck by a car as they were pulling into the parking lot.

That event happened back in 2014 so I believe if they’re stuck there, they’ve been stuck in this space for exactly 10 years now 

I’ve heard a lot about souls getting free, once they’ve completed what they were supposed to do at their time of death…
Or even that an area can hold a memory long after death and that it can be freed 

I believe that the spirit is trying to tell me to get his ice cream for him, to free him.

Could this be the case and could I free him by doing so?
Just simply by buying him an ice cream and take it over the road to his memorial?

How do I go about releasing the spirit from this space? Because I sure as hell would hate to be stuck in a space for eternity let alone 10 years…😕

Would my idea do anything?
How would I know that I have freed him?

First time posting on reddit too,
I’m sorry if this is too long 🫤
I just really want to help this dude!

This can help reduce your rental costs and make better use of the area you're paying for.
2. **You want to share resources:** Sometimes, two businesses can benefit from sharing a location, like a coffee shop inside a bookstore. A [commercial sublease agreement](https://lawrina.org/templates/sublease-agreement/commercial/) can outline how both parties will share resources efficiently.
3. **You need more workspace:** If your business requires temporary expansion without committing to a long-term lease, subleasing from another tenant can be a flexible and cost-effective solution.
4. **You're relocating before your lease ends:** If you move your business to a new location but still have time left on your original lease, subleasing can relieve you from paying for two spaces.

1g44f1p,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1g44f1p/my_boyfriends_upstairs_neighbor_is_stalking_him/,"My boyfriend’s upstairs neighbor is stalking him, and now she’s starting to include me in her messages—what should we do?","My boyfriend and I have been together for about half a year, and we’re really happy. He told me early on that his upstairs neighbor was a stalker, but I didn’t take it too seriously at first. I thought it was just some girl with a crush. But after reading her messages and seeing how weirdly intense she is, I’m honestly scared now. I’d love to hear your opinions on this.

The story:

At first, my boyfriend and his neighbor were just that—neighbors. They lived in the same building for about two months without any issues. She’s a 35-year-old woman from Ukraine, who moved to Germany years before the war. She used to give motivational pep talks at seminars for immigrants (a really commendable job!), but she only did that a couple of times and has been home ever since. She lives above him in a small, single-room apartment, just like his. They initiated some superficial small talk and exchanged numbers in case one of them needed something or if something happened. For example, he texted her to let her know he’d be having a birthday party and that it might get noisy, or when he was about to drill holes into his wall for a shelf to check if it would disturb her.

Then, a bit later, she kind of switched—she threatened to call the police on him because he used to smoke weed in his apartment. But since we live in Berlin, even the police don’t care about that, so she eventually dropped it. Still, she kept up this passive-aggressive attitude toward him—complaining about noise and criticizing him over random things.

One day, they ran into each other in the stairwell, and she invited him up for coffee to talk about “getting along better as neighbors.” So, they sat down, and she randomly started telling him about a phone call she’d just had with her father, where my boyfriend mentioned that his relationship with his mother isn’t the best (he’s very open and kind, and he doesn’t hesitate to speak about personal things, which I love—but in this case, it might have given her the wrong signals). He barely remembers how they ended up talking about their family situations, but it was weird. He also felt uncomfortable at her place, which was sterile and obsessively clean.

That’s when the stalking started.

She began texting him all the time—telling him to turn down his TV because “they” should go to sleep (I guess meaning her and him?). Then she’d say she could feel his “energy” through the walls, claiming she could sense when he wasn’t doing well. She even sent him a picture of her Christmas table, asking him to come up and have dinner with her. He called her and told her no, but that didn’t stop the messages.

It escalated further. She’d accuse him of “punishing” her when she overheard him sleeping with other women (he had some casual dates after parties). She started writing him letters with weird, alternating handwriting styles—timing her entries, sometimes just 10 minutes apart. In the letters, she started getting way too personal, advising him to “jump over his mother’s shadow” and overcome his family issues. One entry she mentioned that he returned home at 2:41 AM, saying she could feel his “strange energy”. And that his energy made her think of seeing a therapist together to “talk without wanting to kill each other.” He was completely disturbed reading this, as he realized HOW deep her feelings go. Feelings from a woman he doesn’t even want to know.

In her letters, she also wrote bizarre things like how she didn’t want to use her “toy” because she could feel that he didn’t want her to. She even left a self-help book about sibling relationships in his mailbox, telling him it helped her and that he should read it. At that point, he lost it, went up to her door, banged on it, but she stayed quiet. He ripped up the book and left it on her doormat.

The following year, for his birthday, she even put up garlands on his doorframe. She remembered his birthday because the year before he texted her about throwing a party and that it will get loud. She remembered it!! Some other day she left a cupcake on his doormat which he threw away, fearing it would be poisoned.

All the while, the past three years, she stayed home all day. She has a little trampoline that she jumps on, and she seems to do it whenever we come home, like she’s listening for us. He told me back then that he had breakdowns over this—just the constant presence and knowing she’s there, watching.

He hasn’t blocked her because he’s afraid she’ll escalate further and find other ways to contact him if she can’t message him. He just tries to manage it, but the strain is real.

Now, she’s including me.

Since we got together, she’s been a little quieter, but she still finds ways to insert herself into his life. For instance, she’ll take packages for other neighbors and leave them on his doormat, texting him about it to have a reason to reach out. The other day, she sent this message while we were out:

“Tell your girlfriend thank you. It’s about time the two of you understand that a connection from you to me is unwanted. I’m saying this with a hint of sadness and nothing else. You have to accept my boundaries, if not respect them.”

The thing is, I’ve never even spoken to her. She’s also technically my neighbor because I live in the building across the courtyard, but the fact that she’s now bringing me into her delusion is terrifying. It feels like she’s creating this whole dynamic where she thinks she’s part of our relationship, when in reality we’re strangers.

What do I do?

I’ve done some research, and it seems like she could be an “intimacy-seeking stalker.” But should I be scared? My boyfriend has told her so many times that he’s not interested in her and that she needs help, but she’s completely unselfaware and refuses to see it. She almost seems narcissistic, like she thinks she’s important in our lives. I don’t believe that she will stop or reflects her behavior, and that her message was just a try to gain control over a situation that only exists in her head.

What should we do? Should we try to talk to her again, or is that just making things worse? Should we involve the police? I’d appreciate any advice, especially from people who have been in a similar situation.

Will she lose interest or will she continue?",1,1728987794.0,Advice,3,0.67,False
