Tonight at Target, I went to go checkout, and as I was waiting in line, I took a sip of the Starbucks coffee I got, and when I went to stick it back in the cup holder of the cart, I missed. It fell to the ground and totally exploded. I felt HORRIBLE. I HATE to spill stuff where it is the responsibility of someone else to clean up. I feel like *I* should be cleaning it up. The 2 ladies reassured me that spilled coffee was the least of their concerns, or even the worst mess they have cleaned up. Still, I felt absolutely awful. 

After all that, one of the ladies walked over to the Starbucks to ask if they would make me another drink. She came back over and asked what I had been drinking to go back to tell the ladies at Starbucks. Honestly, I could have cried right there. I think I said ""thank you"" 100 times and kept telling her how kind she was. 

I did make sure to call Target customer service and let them know what wonderful people both ladies were, as well as the Starbucks employees who made me the drink. 

I know this may seem silly to some or insignificant, but it was a big deal for me when I never have anything kind done for me. 

Anyway, just wanted to give them a shout out in the off-chance they see this. ",2,1733458167.0,Target,0,1.0,False

1h7sjed,https://www.reddit.com/r/MetaphysicalWeather/comments/1h7sjed/autumn_day_75_unelected_overlord_speaks_up/,Autumn Day 75: Unelected Overlord Speaks Up,"(This is a nonviolent text.)

A bit of snow fell earlier this week, like a uniformly fine cloth lowered over the season, a death notice when it comes to autumn and the consensus opinion that autumn winds down over the Thanksgiving weekend, winter starts up in December. A cold front blew into the area last night, all bang and bluster, windows furious in their frames, and thus this morning, the wind chill was below zero. The pavement has that flash frozen look that comes from a combination of ice and rock salt ground into powder ‚Äì I can barely see the stripes that demarcate a crosswalk, no idea what drivers observe with a permanent glare above the dashboard. I am bathed in light. I am a mysterious orb hovering down the block. When we walked the area this morning with our flags of resistance, my feet and hands went numb, but my mind had flashbulbs constantly going off.

When we returned to the peace church, we sipped coffee, talked politics, a government fails in France, a government fails in South Korea ‚Äì don‚Äôt these things come in threes? If the U.S. didn‚Äôt prop up Israel politically and militarily, it too would be a failed state, the settler-colonial project immediately retreating to the 1967 borders, in keeping with the World Court‚Äôs previous rulings. And maybe the U.S. would be failed state number four ‚Äì that is, if we imagine standing beside a legacy of colonialism is going to hold us in good stead with the future. If I campaigned for the role of unelected overlord, I would ferret out the colonial urge wherever I could find it. I would treat the colonial urge like a terminal disease, whether it decimates civilization or dehumanizes human beings with insufficient representation or deludes us into treating founders as parents.

What happened to South Korea‚Äôs leader, that he would just preempt democratic authority like that? Given the Parliament immediately shut it down, was this proof North Korea has indeed infiltrated the south? That was Yoon‚Äôs story, and since his party has announced its intention to block the upcoming impeachment hearings, we might slide South Korea into the constitutional crisis category until further notice, all because a political leader flipped out. What I don‚Äôt share with others on a regular basis is my top-tier concern that hyperreal forms of authority that can displace command-and-control structures at the level of the individual and the nation-state are displacing human authority, preparing us for a new discourse in which authority is derived from dynamic tensions, as with probabilistic hyperforms that manifest among fluid dynamical fields.

Had the same freak out taken place in the north, would Kim have launched a nuclear missile? If the delusion arrived from a political perception, manifested a military response, then sure, the same hyperreal authority might have produced a consequence more dire than a constitutional crisis, which is still ultimately a paperwork problem, not the instant decimation and toxification of major land masses. So perhaps the South Korean leader‚Äôs response was the one more easily borne by the world. Meanwhile, the collapsed French government seems more like the product of a tactic ‚Äì of using a kind of executive privilege to allow the prime minister to pass budgetary measures without the approval of parliament. News flash ‚Äì when you do that in France, you‚Äôre pressing the eject button, along with your austerity program courtesy of neo-liberal economics.

I ended up thinking a lot about a landfill in the UK, where virtual value the size of a Powerball jackpot is getting bigger by the week. The winning ticket is a hard drive with codes on it, buried for 11 years, but really, once the value is that virtual, it could be anything. In fact, it could be a real-world happening that is principally metaphorical ‚Äì we‚Äôve inadvertently tossed away items of value above and beyond what we can properly comprehend, and we‚Äôre willing to go to some considerable trouble to recover that value. The story may be about property reclamation, but with an understanding that the property didn‚Äôt exist in the first place, stood for no value other than that conferred by a scarcity algorithm. How often can we create value from nothing, and if the answer is all the time, then is this what sentience is? My effortless construction of the real?

The week that a laptop hard drive in a UK landfill would get a lot of press, the president of the United States was pardoning his son‚Äôs infamous laptop from whatever transgressive behavior it was lately charged with. Make it go way, said the president to the heavens ‚Äì and away it went. Everyone now agrees the presidential pardon is bound to become a new source of controversy and entertainment for the foreseeable future. As unelected overlord, I would tend to agree the hard drive deserves all the accolades and scrutiny it receives, and I would tend to pardon about everyone. In fact, I might invert the tradition, submit a list of those who need to remain where they are ‚Äì but let the rest go. Sure, we‚Äôd have to think through the implications of mothballing an entire institution, plan to relocate its existing involuntary residents ‚Äì but then we just do it ‚Äì 

move onto the next case, which is about a mega-corporate CEO who is murdered in cold blood on the streets of one of the wealthiest cities in the world, and the price of the stock takes a day to drop, as investors realize, or rather their high-speed trading algorithms realize ‚Äì the general public might feel just a wee bit of ambivalence about the death of someone who preyed on the general public‚Äôs misfortune, worse than most in his line of work, which drops a wrench into any plan for global economic apartheid. Social media seemed to be about ten-to-one against doing anything at all to find the dead prick‚Äôs killer, which is about a half-step removed from reversing the usual order of class warfare ‚Äì from the top down ‚Äì to propose the pitiless, cruel and grossly overcompensated should naturally fear for their lives, should know they live on borrowed time.

Imagine if this was the new-old president‚Äôs long-game all along ‚Äì infiltrate the billionaire class, get them thinking you‚Äôre one of them, foment division and hatred per usual, get the electorate to vote against their best interests ‚Äì no, twice! ‚Äì then just when self-driving cars seem ready to spring out of everyone‚Äôs driveway, flip a secret switch in the global mind to replace the colonial urge with a will toward egalitarianism. In it together! we‚Äôll cheer, as we relieve the rich of their billions, then respond to anthropogenic climate change with more than newly opened markets and unlikely promises. In it together! we‚Äôll coo, as the president‚Äôs genius strategy plays out, the president as surprised as we are the CEOs of the world are fleeing to the hills. Perhaps reality is choosing a different path, we‚Äôll offer, as we shutter another jail ‚Äì we‚Äôre just hoping to keep up.",1,1733457294.0,MetaphysicalWeather,0,1.0,False

Hi my previous post is here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/s/ieNbQHBPwA

The short update is she moved out and I feel so relieved.  The long updated is below.  I apologize for any grammar mistakes it has been a long week and I don‚Äôt care enough to edit them.

Based on my previous post, I decided that I would give her one more strike and then I would say she address the issues as I didn‚Äôt want to without a recent incident and have it feel like it was coming out of nowhere. 

Things were fine/quiet for a while and I was super busy so didn‚Äôt really interact with her much. 

She sent me a text beginning of November telling me she booked her flight for mid January and would be extending her lease until then.  I told her I had scheduled renovation plans and would not be able to extend the lease. (In her defense, when she signed the lease she asked if extending the lease would be an option, if she decided she wanted to stay longer.  I said that we could look into it if it was a good fit but did not promise anything and said it would need to be another conversation well in advance. I still have no idea why the fuck she would book the flight before confirming where she was staying) She did not talk to me for a few days after that, but my other roommate said that she was angrily slamming around the kitchen that night and complaining about how she didn‚Äôt know about the renovation plans. 


About a week and a half later she sent another text stating that she was having a hard time finding a place to stay for 2 weeks and couldn‚Äôt stay with family.  She said she found a place but needed to rent it for more than a month and couldn‚Äôt afford double rent.  She said that based on the lease agreement she would be ending her lease early and was giving me her 30 day notice.  She also commented on the vibes being off and wanted to make her remaining time in the home positive.

I told her I was sorry she was having a hard time finding a place.  That I had scheduled the renovations beginning of October, after she had a conversation with me that she was probably going to move out before Christmas so she could travel in California with her FWBs before she went back home.  I informed her that the early termination clause in the lease required her to find a sub letter for the remainder of her leases. 

Then I included 
‚Äú‚Ä¶as a roommate, I‚Äôve felt like you‚Äôve taken advantage of my generosity. You‚Äôve acted as though you‚Äôre entitled to many of my things that aren‚Äôt included in the lease. I was happy to accommodate you because I knew you were in a tough situation and wanted to help you feel comfortable. But, you‚Äôve consistently damaged or treated my things poorly, or left extra work for me by not returning them in the same condition you found them. At this point, I‚Äôm honestly over it, and I haven‚Äôt brought it up because I didn‚Äôt want it to cause an issue.‚Äù  To address her comments about bad vibes

She responded complained that she can‚Äôt find a subletter since it‚Äôs such short notice and a short period of time.  She complained that she didn‚Äôt know about the renovations and was upset that I hadn‚Äôt communicated about them with her. Repeatedly told me that paying double rent would be really hard for her and asked to find an agreement in the middle.  She then apologized for making me feel that way and went into detail and rambled about why she did what she had done with the most  recent 3 issues at that point in time and stated that usually roommate share.  


I said 
‚ÄúThanks for your apology. I want to clarify that I don‚Äôt have an issue with sharing, all my past roommate arrangements have involved sharing. But in those cases, everyone contributed something, or if they couldn‚Äôt they helped more with general cleaning to make up for it.  Plus they were careful with the items they used, made sure others could still access them, and returned them in the same condition they found them. They were also appreciative, which went a long way.

In this case, you haven‚Äôt really provided anything to share and have demonstrated patterns of not handling my things with care and of a general lack of consideration of (other roommate) and me. It‚Äôs not just the few things you mentioned, though I don‚Äôt think going into a list would be beneficial. I don‚Äôt need you to replace anything, but since you asked, I just wanted to be open with you about why it‚Äôs been frustrating.‚Äú


Ultimately in regard to the lease I told her I could possibly give her a portion of the lease back based on utilities at the end of the month. 

She again complained and said she felt stuck and asked me to take her situation into consideration.


From that point on I would say hi to her when I saw her but did not actively try to engage with her.  

3 days after that she took my wet laundry out of the washing machine again and put it in a laundry basket on the floor. (It‚Äôs a dollar store laundry basket so there‚Äôs basically no bottom so my wet laundry was essentially sitting on carpet over night)  I had already addressed this with her.  I 100% believe this was completely intentional and malicious. I was in my bedroom (next to the laundry room) with the door open. If she did not want to move them herself she could‚Äôve just asked me.  (Also they were fucking towels so she doesn‚Äôt have the excuse of I didn‚Äôt know if they could go in the dryer or not). I didn‚Äôt realize until the following morning and had to rewash my laundry.  I was ready to go off on her but did not want to do it when I was home alone with her so I did not end up happening as too much time passed before we weren‚Äôt home alone/she left the house. 

Another 3 days later she left coffee spilled on the counter again.  This time it stained.  Again was ready to send a message to her, but after talking to wiser adults than myself and realizing she was only really going to be in the house for like ~4 more days outside of traveling for Thanksgiving I decided it was not worth it.  It‚Äôs not my job to teach her to be a decent person. 

She moved out yesterday while I was at work but my boyfriend was at my house as a safe guard.  She sent me a text today asking me to send her Decembers rent and the deposit back so she could pay for her new place.  I told her I‚Äôd get her deposit to with in the legal time frame and reminded her that I said the portion of Decembers rent would be based on utilities and I wouldn‚Äôt know that until January like I already told her.  

In the process of moving out I know she took 2 possibly 3 of my pillows and possibly more things I have yet to discover.  She also took my other roommates comforter and then asked if she was ‚Äúhappy to get rid of it?‚Äù when she supposedly realized she took it.  

I‚Äôm honestly insanely relieved it feels like a huge weight off my shoulders.  I‚Äôm really proud of standing my ground in regard to the lease extension/payment.  And while I think it would‚Äôve been really enjoyable to send those messages, i am glad I didn‚Äôt waste my breathe.  It‚Äôs not my job and she was not going to learn anything from them.  The only thing it would do just reinforce her idea that I just didn‚Äôt want to share. ",4,1733456919.0,badroommates,0,1.0,False

In 5th grade I was diagnosed with PTSD. Growing up I always believed that despite all of the significant shit I have been through, it never affected me and I never understood why. After finding out about CPTSD yesterday after googling how childhood trauma can manifest in adults, and finding this subreddit, going through all the top posts, the comments, I began to relate more and more, and I started thinking back to my childhood, I always knew what had happened to me as a kid, but I couldn‚Äôt really remember too many specifics, but I‚Äôm starting to remember some specifics in the traumatic events though I can‚Äôt remember any dates. I lived in an unstable household where my parents were going through a nasty divorce, and a narcissistic mom who would basically push, my brother who is on the spectrum until he would get violent and begin beating her. My dad worked nightshifts and would never be home when it happened, so I would try to defend my mom. In turn I‚Äôd get beat. I would call the cops or my mom would. They would do nothing. My brother would begin taking our phones so we couldn‚Äôt call the cops and holding us hostage in our rooms. I remember screaming at my brother to stop because he‚Äôs going to kill mom, my brother ontop of my mom beating her with a belt, my brother getting violent a morning before school and breaking my mom‚Äôs door open while she was holding it closed, it hitting her in the top right side of the head and blood all over her face, then him throwing a baseball at my dad‚Äôs eye when he tried to get involved. I remember glass always on the floor. I don‚Äôt remember specifically from what. My mom started staying at hotels or at friend‚Äôs houses. Then it was just really me and my brother. Any conflict would result in being attacked. After a while, my mom literally kidnapped me in the middle of fifth grade - I wasn‚Äôt allowed to tell anyone.  and drove 3 hours to PA to get us away. Things were good for a couple of months - mom rushes into a relationship up until my freshman year, guy was a heroin addict with severe anger issues, though he never put his hands on me, but threatened it before. They never fed me though. I would have to make my dinner. They would hide snacks and I was literally allowed one snack a day, like a coffee cake or 3 oreos. I was malnourished and neglected, 5‚Äô11 and 120 pounds in 8th grade. He made me cry on my first birthday with us, I think my 12th. Mom defended him. Me and my real dad used to be really, really close. After moving, my mom put all this shit in my head about him. I ghosted my dad and his side of the family from 5th grade to Junior year, despite their repeated attempts to contact me, until me and my mom moved back to NY where my dad and brother never left. My mom would constantly overstep my boundaries and make things worse for me, like going to the school when I was getting bullied in 8th grade by people who I used to be good friends with even when stepdad said it was a bad idea. It got worse. The teachers did nothing, the things being said to me were yelled by multiple people, I know that they heard. Mom and stepdad would constantly fight.he put his hands on her a couple of times.  I became extremely hypersexual in 5th grade, like 2 or 3 times a day and it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve only gotten rid of (hopefully) a month. Since 7th grade I have had this weird behavior that when people do genuinely like me romantically, I just can‚Äôt feel anything for them. But I would go so far for people I had just met, or hadn‚Äôt even met - despite them clearly not having feelings for me. I‚Äôve never felt genuinely secure in a relationship and even then, when I am in them I lose myself completely and everything becomes about it. Despite being cheated on, and manipulated and emotionally abused, sa‚Äôed, I‚Äôve never been able to leave, I feel as if they are all I have. More people mistreated me when I would give everything, and this like dependency on someone to love me got worse, my junior year I overdosed on benadryl when this girl, who like kind of comforted me? I told her about my trauma in person and and I think she comforted me well, I think she may have been the only person I actually have felt something for. I don‚Äôt even feel love for my parents, when people would leave me I would be fine in a day, even when I thought I was crazy in love with these people, who I barely even knew and who treated me horrible. Moved to Florida going into Sophomore year when I had just found my genuine friends. After moving, I stopped answering them more and more, until I just never talked to them again. Found a shitty group of friends in Florida, but the never answering them continued when I wasn‚Äôt with them. Then I found a really good one. Switched to online school. Struggled to do it. I‚Äôd bedrot everyday besides like 3 or 4 times a year. Was able to get school done bit by bit, but not even remotely close to the time I was supposed to. My mom was already very emotionally abusive, and when I would struggle to get school done she would scream at me, throw things although things that couldn‚Äôt hurt me. She‚Äôs told me to kill myself, how she wishes she never had kids with my dad. I‚Äôd say things back too. I am never able to cry, even at times when I want to and I try to force myself to. But when these conflicts with my mom would happen, I would break down sometimes, but then I think it stopped affecting me. My mom has cptsd too and secondary progressive ms. She‚Äôs going to be wheelchair bound in a few years. Our relationship is getting a lot better but I don‚Äôt think I can genuinely forgive her until she owns up to it. Anytime I try to talk about it now, I get called verbally abusive, and she cries about how she‚Äôs a horrible parent and her kids hate her and she should just die. We lived in an apartment complex and I knew people could hear us so I would be really paranoid leaving the house. Moved back into old childhood home where my dad and brother (and now his girlfriend) still were to try to save the house which was in foreclosure. Bad idea. Constant fights between brother and girlfriend, my brother and mom, or just me and my brother. I would always get involved and now that I was old enough to stand up to him we‚Äôd get into physical fights. Dad was there for a bit and he really did do his best to make up for the time that was lost. He really was a good dad. I know that he really loves me and that he never stopped loving me in all the years I ghosted him. I wish my mom never put all that shit in my head. I started smoking carts and nicotine like crazy very early on into my junior year, I remember waking up everyday after hitting at least 10 blinkers the night before, and the crazy state of derealization and paranoia I‚Äôd be in where I felt like all my movements were slow - where I believed everybody knew. I was getting bullied. My friends were friends with the group that was bullying me. They adopted what was being done to me and said that ‚Äúthey started it and they didn‚Äôt know why everybody who I wasn‚Äôt close with thought it was cool to do.‚Äù My friends began bullying me, worse then the actual bullies. I missed over 60 days my junior year. I was never really invited out, though I did have a couple of genuine friends outside my friend group, but we have drifted due to in my inability to keep in touch and check up on people, I feel as if I am a bother when texting people and that people cannot truly like me. Senior year it got better because the friends who would mostly initiate the bullying graduated, and the bullies just stopped. and became chill with me. Still struggled with keeping genuine friendships. Still missed a ton of school so switched halfway into my senior year. Things at home were still bad. I began bedrotting all day, I committed to a good schedule for about a week after like 3 months, but even now I haven‚Äôt finished when I was supposed to graduate in june.  Started working again at TB. mom became more emotionally abusive. All i have been able to do is just waste my life away. Got into an abusive relationship with my coworker after talking for 2 weeks from like early june to early august? She was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, she would constantly belittle me, always have this sense of superiority about me. She would flip out on me over the smallest things and say hurtful things. My mom hated her very early on for no reason and my mom‚Äôs verbal abuse became really bad. I started always staying at her house, mostly because she couldn‚Äôt go to mine. Mom got very involved, said she was kicking me out and threw all my stuff out in bags. When I called the cops because my girlfriend had told me to, she said she wasn‚Äôt going to she was just trying to teach me a lesson. Relationship got really bad because of girlfriend‚Äôs borderline personality disorder and my inability to handle mean words, which completely destroyed my ability to trust and have feeling for her, she even cheated on me, her and her sister were scarily close and they‚Äôd gang up on me about how I‚Äôm just sensitive. I understood it was because of her bpd. I didn‚Äôt blame her. I just wanted her to acknowledge that I‚Äôm allowed to be hurt and care for me. I could never leave her, it felt that she was all I had, I had no friends, I had absolutely nothing and I felt doomed to a path of loneliness. She was also very controlling of what I did. She would get mad at me if I was smoking ACTUAL weed (which helps me, but only when I‚Äôm alone up until recently.) with the one genuine friend I had in my hometown. (I moved 30 minutes from it in June) She would get mad at me for smoking and treat me like shit until I promised to quit, and obviously I‚Äôd ignore that and the loop would continue. She told me how she would never want to have kids with me, I tried to make a conversation because say how guns could be better in a zombie apocalypse and she got mad because she‚Äôs a big fan of TLOU, and melee would be better. She blew up, I apologized and said I was trying to make conversation and she told me talking to me is never fun. Relationship ended and I was broken for a bit, found little in being alone though all I was doing was wasting my time in bed watching youtube or anime that I didn‚Äôt even enjoy watching - that‚Äôs how it was junior year and up until about a month or two after me and her brokeup. I started smoking bud by myself and just listening to music in the car, and it was something I began to really enjoy. Even with the music, I‚Äôd become really introspective and I started to be easier on myself. The shame loop got so much better. I‚Äôve found two genuine friends since moving. I‚Äôve started forcing myself to better keep in contact with family and friends. But throughout all of this it‚Äôs all an act, I don‚Äôt think I feel any emotion toward these people, I‚Äôm just 
putting on a performance so they like me. Even at work, which I love my coworkers - it is all an act, every interaction from them to the drive thru and counter. I‚Äôm always reading people and I sometimes I think I can read them completely. Things around me are getting better, but I am still devoid of emotion. Even when talking about these things, I so badly want to feel some emotion about it but there just is none, it‚Äôs like it just happened to me. I could only feel hate and suicidal idealization for myself up until recently, which I would distract myself everyday with just watching shows. Never anything productive.  I wish I had a self. I have no interests. I have no skills or talents. I go to the gym on and off and it is so hard to push myself. I don‚Äôt even like going. I just want to gain weight. I don‚Äôt know who I am. Lately I‚Äôve started going to the gym again, I am going to learn to make beats on the side because that has always been something I have enjoyed and been obsessed with in music, but never had the motivation to do. I hope that I can find love in it. I‚Äôve been doing more around the house, because I understand that my mom neglected me because she was too physically sick with MS, so much other shit, and cptsd. Though I still cannot truly forgive her until she genuinely owns up to it. I deleted social media, just redownloading reddit today for this subreddit. and I think it has really helped me be in touch with myself. I‚Äôm sorry for all of this - I‚Äôm high and I don‚Äôt go to therapy and I have nobody I am comfortable truly talking to about it. I‚Äôve talked about it never, felt any emotion about what is said to me, nor any emotion to recalling it. I don‚Äôt know how to work toward regaining my emotions, losing my ability to perform.

We have had a more severe tooth injury in the past that somehow did not dislodge his two front teeth but I have the imprint of them forever on my wooden coffee table. Anyways, we went to dentist where he took X-rays. I will try and post below. I‚Äôm no expert but it looks like the tooth in question is detached from the root (this explains why it is loose after injury today) but there is what appears to be a twisted tooth growing up either right underneath it or almost like it was inside it. It is another baby tooth, not his adult tooth which is still up there. Has anyone heard of this? I can‚Äôt find anything online. I am wondering if we will have to pull it once the other tooth falls out (any day now). The plan is to reassess after the tooth falls out. I am curious if this is just something weird that happened or if it had to do with the first injury a year or so ago? We never took X-rays at that appt because everything appeared to be normal. My poor son always has some health thing going on that my heart just breaks for him if he will need serious dental work in the future. He is an allergy kid and always sick so we are always in and out of the doctors.

The Layers of Stars Hollow

Sam Winchester, known here as Dean Forester, wandered through the town square of Stars Hollow, hands shoved deep into the pockets of his jacket. The autumn air nipped at his skin, carrying with it the scent of cider and woodsmoke. Around him, the town hummed with its usual charm: Taylor Doose berating Kirk over improperly aligned hay bales for the Harvest Festival, Miss Patty recounting a scandalous tale to a cluster of wide-eyed onlookers, and Babette waving wildly from her porch.

It was idyllic. Too idyllic. The kind of place that felt like a storybook come to life‚Äîa storybook Sam was sure had a dark undercurrent. Stars Hollow wasn‚Äôt what it seemed. He was sure of it.

He had seen it in the stars above the gazebo, how they shimmered just a bit too brightly, occasionally shifting in ways that defied the laws of nature. He‚Äôd felt it in the way time seemed to bend here. Days didn‚Äôt drag or rush; they simply were, as if Stars Hollow existed on its own clock. And he‚Äôd heard it in the laughter‚Äîthe childlike giggles that floated through the town at odd hours, leaving him cold and uneasy.


The Fraying of the Fabric

Sam sat at a corner table in Luke‚Äôs Diner, stirring his coffee absently. Lorelai and Rory were seated at the counter, arguing with Luke about his no-cellphone policy. Their voices were familiar now, comforting even, but Sam couldn‚Äôt let his guard down. Not with what he‚Äôd seen.

The first sign had been subtle. During one of Stars Hollow‚Äôs endless festivals, Sam had noticed the people moving in odd patterns‚Äîlaughing, clapping, and turning in perfect synchronization, as if choreographed. He‚Äôd thought it was a coincidence. Then, during a quiet night, the stars above the gazebo had formed a shape‚Äîa sigil he vaguely recognized from his father‚Äôs journals. Something ancient. Something wrong.

‚ÄúEarth to Dean,‚Äù Lorelai said, pulling him out of his thoughts. She slid into the seat across from him, Rory in tow. ‚ÄúYou look about as cheerful as Luke during a karaoke night.‚Äù

‚ÄúJust tired,‚Äù Sam muttered, pasting on a smile. ‚ÄúBig work project.‚Äù

Rory gave him a curious look. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been tired a lot lately. Are you sure you‚Äôre okay?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. Just‚Äî‚Äù He stopped as the bell over the diner door jingled, and Kirk stumbled in, carrying a box of balloons. Bright red ones.

Sam froze. The coffee cup in his hand cracked, spilling hot liquid onto the table. ‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù he muttered, grabbing a napkin to mop it up.

Kirk dropped the box onto a nearby chair and turned to Luke. ‚ÄúThe balloons for the Harvest Festival! Taylor wanted them inflated by tonight.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo it somewhere else,‚Äù Luke grumbled.

The balloons swayed slightly in an unseen breeze. One broke free, floating toward Sam. It stopped in midair, hovering unnaturally close to his face. His breath hitched. For a split second, he thought he saw a reflection in its glossy surface‚Äînot his own, but something pale, with sharp teeth and glowing yellow eyes.

‚ÄúDean?‚Äù Lorelai asked, her voice laced with concern.

He forced himself to smile and swatted the balloon away. ‚ÄúNothing. Just‚Ä¶ I hate balloons.‚Äù


The Cracks Widen

That night, Sam sat in his rented room above Doose‚Äôs Market, pouring over his journal. He scribbled notes about the sigil in the stars, the unnatural synchronicity of the townsfolk, and the laughter that seemed to come from nowhere. He circled one word repeatedly: Nexus.

Stars Hollow wasn‚Äôt just a town. It was a convergence point, a place where dimensions met and blurred. It explained the oddities‚Äîthe timelessness, the way everyone seemed bound by invisible strings. It also explained why Pennywise had chosen it. The creature thrived on fear, and a nexus like this one would amplify its power.

A faint knock at the door made him tense. ‚ÄúCome in,‚Äù he called, sliding his journal under a pile of old newspapers.

The door creaked open, and Lorelai peeked her head inside. ‚ÄúYou okay? You‚Äôve been super weird lately.‚Äù

Sam sighed. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine, really. Just work stuff.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a bad liar,‚Äù she said, stepping fully into the room. ‚ÄúAnd believe me, I know bad liars. Rory tried to fake sick once to get out of a test, and she spent the entire day sneezing into tissues she‚Äôd stuffed with pepper.‚Äù

He couldn‚Äôt help but chuckle. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be okay, Lorelai. Thanks for checking on me.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnytime,‚Äù she said, but her gaze lingered on him. She was sharp, too sharp, and he knew she wouldn‚Äôt drop this easily.


The Festival

The Harvest Festival arrived, and the town square was transformed into a glowing wonderland of orange lights, hay bales, and scarecrows. Sam wandered through the crowd, his hunter‚Äôs instincts on high alert. He kept his knife tucked in his jacket, his eyes scanning for any sign of Pennywise.

He didn‚Äôt have to wait long.

Near the gazebo, Taylor was giving a speech about the history of the festival when the air shifted. The laughter started softly, almost imperceptible, but it grew louder, echoing off the buildings. The crowd began to sway, their movements becoming jerky and unnatural.

Sam‚Äôs heart pounded. ‚ÄúNo, no, no,‚Äù he muttered, pushing through the crowd.

A red balloon floated from the gazebo, its string dragging along the ground. It stopped at Taylor‚Äôs feet, and for a moment, time seemed to freeze. Then, with a deafening pop, the balloon burst, and the world erupted into chaos.

The stars above the gazebo twisted into a swirling vortex, the sigil blazing brightly. Shadows spilled from the gazebo, twisting into monstrous shapes. The townspeople screamed, their faces contorting in terror as Pennywise emerged, its grin wide and menacing.

Sam drew his knife. ‚ÄúCome on, you bastard.‚Äù

Pennywise tilted its head, eyes gleaming. ‚ÄúHello, Dean,‚Äù it said in a voice that wasn‚Äôt its own‚Äîit was John Winchester‚Äôs.


The Fight for Stars Hollow

As Sam lunged at the creature, the townsfolk rallied around him, their fear morphing into something stronger: determination. Lorelai grabbed a nearby pitchfork, her usual banter replaced by a fierce resolve. Luke and Rory joined her, wielding makeshift weapons.

Pennywise faltered, its form flickering. Stars Hollow wasn‚Äôt like other places‚Äîit was more than a nexus; it was a community. The bonds between its people were stronger than the fear Pennywise fed on.

As the vortex above the gazebo grew brighter, Sam realized what he had to do. He drew a sigil in the dirt with his knife, chanting an incantation he barely remembered from his father‚Äôs journal. The townsfolk held the line, their courage keeping Pennywise at bay.

With a final, deafening roar, the vortex collapsed, taking Pennywise with it. The stars returned to their normal positions, and the town square fell silent.


The Aftermath

The next morning, Stars Hollow was back to its usual self, as if nothing had happened. The townsfolk didn‚Äôt remember the terror of the night before, their memories clouded by the town‚Äôs strange magic.

Sam, however, remembered everything. He packed his things, knowing he couldn‚Äôt stay. As he climbed into his truck, Lorelai appeared, hands on her hips.

‚ÄúRunning off without saying goodbye?‚Äù she asked.

Sam hesitated. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something I have to take care of.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure, Dean,‚Äù she said, her tone laced with suspicion. ‚ÄúJust‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt be a stranger, okay?‚Äù

He nodded, forcing a smile. As he drove out of town, he glanced in the rearview mirror. The gazebo stood tall in the distance, its stars twinkling faintly, as if watching him leave.

Stars Hollow was safe. For now.

She's wasn't in bad health or anything, I just don't trust her with children. Growing up with a single mom, she was quite abusive physically and mentally. She wasn't someone I felt I could talk to about emotional things growing up, especially being bullied as an overweight kid with no friends. Her love life wasn't great either as she was constantly getting abused and they would occasionally hit me as well. I finally decided to stand up for myself against her when I was 16 and called the cops on her for attacking me with a cast iron pan because she thought I took her boyfriend's smoking accessory. This took me out of her home for roughly 16 months. I opted to move back to her home during my senior year just so I could finish school without having to repeat my senior year for one class. She never hit me again after this. 

Back to the main story. At this time, I was still living with my mom. I was sitting with a family friend before I had to leave for work and we're having some coffee while chit chatting. Somehow the topic of her asking me about ever wanting to get hitched or having kids popped up, and for some reason I gave my honest thoughts for once. I wasn't too sure about marriage and kids would be off the table for the forseeable future. I explicitly said that because of the way my mother beat me growing up and mentally tortured (a bit excessive of a word but couldn't think of anything tamer that fit) me. I didn't trust her with kids that I may have, and to be frank, I still don't. After the conversation, I went off to work and didn't think much of it. While working, my mother left me a voicemail going off about how horrible I am and how I hurt her.

I have been having a strong urge to pee every hour and sometimes wake up in the middle night to pee. I went to my local urgent care to get tested for UTI and it came out clear.  I made an appointment with my PC right after. I thought it was my anxiety at first ,since I am GAD. and having pains or weird feelings all over my body ( I had a CT w/ contrast for my abdominal pain in July )

when i talked to My doctor and she took more urination test and blood test , and I'm healthy and she's confused. She what's my daily diet or intake.  I later told her I drink a 1-2 cup of coffees before and during work, energy drinks for the gym , and sodas here and there. been doing that intake since i was a teen. I'm 23 M.  Doctor tells me she's shocked that nothing came up for my bladder and kidneys , or that i didn't developed diabetes. She tells to cut majority of my caffeine for a month to see how I do.  She did refer to me a urologist after my month.

I knew caffeine had a good amount cons , but after what she told me and looking online that yeah it affects urinations that much.

Has anyone had this problem with urinations , and did quitting or cutting majority of caffeine helped or solved this? ",5,1733455717.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

descending after turbulence;

seeking the key to unlock her past

and know a heart that had always been her own;

she deposited a surge on the back of my neck

like an ebbing tide of warm wishes for my safety and pride to be soothed, and tended.

I knew her.

I had been waiting on her; inside some chance like this.

I had been stuck in aftermath of my expired ashes-- barely kindled, reminding me to stay alive.

she asked a question and we zeroed in because

I wanted to know her soul to care for my own.

she asked me to inquire in her anything

I merely wanted to know:

her present freedom from the unready

at the hands of the mistakes

of the wrathful folks on some path to their own demise.

I knew that path, and I called through the cream,

screaming her name inside;

until she told me,

that she knew my pain, and that I had heard hers in a transparent key. her brilliant hope

lay on a leaf,

with the gentle wind of my breath desperate to cradle her heart.

I did not like the one reason that things had to be this way,

and I question whether I was wrong all along; that I could‚Äôve just awoken years ago,

when the pain was fresh and I was willing to carry myself, like her lioness that reflected me and proved me that I belong

in my burning anger to survive, and

my medium well way of logic.

she smiled at my claim,

that I loved what I loved, and let me love her

as I only know how to love.

‚Äúbecause we love

what we love

in the way we love, not as we should love

we love completely

or not at all‚Äù

\--quoting Hunter,

To not disappear in flame.

a quiet moment between us,

given of each other.

would not the chance to be connected

be the relief we sought, that she had in her cheekbones

when I told her that I knew and that I would prove it for her speaking up;

a shelter from our dual thunderclouds moving past the outpost where

we sat and put our hands by the patio fire this night. a new home.

we traveled the earth in story along a highway of stones planted with the reasons

that would be our path forward-- to the

dawn light and her message that she had found comfort and safety in the far corner of her patience, where a fountain waits and sings

the water dance of the reborn

I beg her pardon to be fair to her strengths in my aching heart

which knows I cannot turn back from myself nor turn away,

from her angelic inner light watching me

and smiling down on my key to

the freedom

of my soul.

a walk after our coffee. up main street, toward the music store, and a 3-minute hug under the streetlamp‚Äî

burning to show itself and light up my face smiling

back for her. safe in her hands.

as mine guard the distant horizon

of an era that refuses to help itself in deeper kindness nor look outward

and might happen upon us dreaming.

Together now. Ready for

a cote of doves to hold our tail wind.

Steady for takeoff, into any restaurant with our glasses raised

And a cheerful grin reciprocated, across the table,

From my weary eyes lighting up my way

Into her validating smile.

If you‚Äôre working remotely or traveling long-term, here are some tips that have worked well for me:

1. **Create a Routine**: I stick to a regular schedule, even if it‚Äôs just waking up at the same time each day. Having a routine helps maintain focus, especially when there‚Äôs so much to explore.
2. **Exercise Regularly**: I make time for daily physical activity‚Äîwhether it's a run, yoga, or even a quick bodyweight workout. Staying active keeps me energized and focused for long work sessions.
3. **Eat Well and Stay Hydrated**: Cooking my own meals whenever possible is key to maintaining a healthy diet. I also make sure to drink plenty of water throughout the day.
4. **Design a Productive Workspace**: Whether it's a coffee shop, co-working space, or a quiet corner of my apartment, I set up a workspace where I can focus without distractions.
5. **Balance Work and Play**: While I prioritize work, I also make time to explore new places, meet new people, and take breaks. This keeps me motivated and helps prevent burnout.

1h7rv15,https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanticAdvice/comments/1h7rv15/i_dont_know_what_to_make_of_things/,I don‚Äôt know what to make of things,"I (21MtF) am very lonely. The only long term partner I ever had was a girlfriend I had back when I was 16, and the last date I went on before recently was two years ago. I‚Äôm somebody who desires to be loved in a romantic sense and wants to love somebody and be with them and give them everything I can.

I‚Äôve had net-negative success on dating apps, the only match that went anywhere was a that date two years ago which was awful as the person I was talking to kept interrupting me and making the conversations I tried to have into ones about them. However, last month I had matched with somebody on Hinge (let‚Äôs call them Kris), and we had immediately hit it off and went on a date.

The date went amazingly: we got coffee, talked for hours about our interests, our past relationships, what we want, how we feels, and by the end of the night we had a wonderful time and we had kissed, and planned our next date. I was already developing feelings for them (we ended the date talking about how big of crushes we had on each other so quickly), and I was very excited to talk to them again and keep learning about them and see where things went.

Unfortunately our date that was to follow got cancelled as they had a group assignment for school they tried to push back but couldn‚Äôt and had to prioritize. I was upset at the cancellation, but ultimately acknowledged that there‚Äôs always next time, things are good, and Kris tried to push it back to see me again.

However, a few days later my mother and I got into a big argument (a constant) and it had sent me down a spiral that had me questioning a lot of things in my life that I am embarrassed to say were extremely irrational in hindsight, and I had began to go against any of my better judgement and thought Kris wasn‚Äôt wanting to see me. I sat on that idea and, once again, acknowledged how out of nowhere it was.

I have a lot of problems with getting overly attached and being too co-dependent with people, not just crushes but my own friends, as well as problems with self-esteem and abandonment issues from prior friendships and flirtatious situations. So in my irrational daze, I had decided to text Kris a long message talking about how I was upset we couldn‚Äôt hang out and went into this huge spiral, and it made me think of my problems of attachment, self-esteem, and abandonment, and I had told Kris that while I want things to go forward, I want to be honest about the flaws that I have with myself.

If you can‚Äôt tell, I also have a big problem with self-sabotage. Kris saw the message, took the night to think of a response, and the next day thanked me for the time we spent, but said that what I had told them was a lot to process and while they appreciate how much I cared they didn‚Äôt want to be in a relationship that would cost them their independence. We haven‚Äôt spoken since, and they have unfollowed me on Instagram, and I haven‚Äôt contacted them on text or Hinge.

Our last conversation was two weeks ago and the entire time I haven‚Äôt had a clue what to make of things. I‚Äôve been eating less and sleeping more and all I can think of is how much of an idiot I feel like. I still think of Kris and what could have been, and maybe it‚Äôs just in the moment now, but I don‚Äôt know how to move forward knowing that I had literally driven somebody away by trying to be honest about my flaws. I never intended to hurt them, but I can‚Äôt stop thinking about how it must have felt for the person you were talking with to out of the blue bring up the stuff I did. I worry so much I hurt them, I don‚Äôt want to hurt their chances of being open again but I‚Äôm so scared I have. I was the first date Kris had been on in a year.

I‚Äôm not sure if any of this will make sense but I truly don‚Äôt know what to make of things. I‚Äôm hurt, I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôve hurt someone, and I‚Äôm trying to think forward but when I do all I can see is me bundled up by myself in bed.

I start therapy soon, but I don‚Äôt know what to make of things. Maybe this isn‚Äôt the place to ask, but keeping it pent up in me only hurts more.",1,1733455198.0,RomanticAdvice,1,1.0,False

Sleep is an important part of integration.

That's why in this post I want to share information with you that hopefully will help you sleep better.

&#x200B;

An important lecture of Merijn van de Laar (Maastricht University), Mental Health psychologist and sleep scientist. He holds a PhD in the treatment of insomnia and has extensive experience in the behavioral therapeutic treatment of sleep problems.

Use the English Subtitles: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVIg\_-rJecY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVIg_-rJecY)

&#x200B;

Core principle for good sleep:

\- Increase Sleep Pressure during the day

\- Decrease Arousal / Tension during the day

&#x200B;

***Summary I made from a course I did with Merijn van de Laar:***

&#x200B;

**Relaxing evening ritual to sleep better**

&#x200B;

Day wind down to more rest and recovery.

&#x200B;

***Turn off your screens:***

\- Do not look at your tablet, phone or laptop 2 hours before bedtime.

&#x200B;

Possible relaxing activities:

\- Reading

\- Listening to music

\- Massage

\- Taking an extended shower or bath

\- Doing something creative (drawing, painting, coloring)

\- Take a walk

\- Journalling (keeping a journal)

\- Having sex

\- Meditating/breathing exercise

\- Yoga

&#x200B;

***Avoid caffeine***

Do not drink coffee and black tea in the last 5 hours before sleeping.

&#x200B;

*Quiet sleep*

The most important thing to sleep well is to unwind by bedtime. Putting away screens is not because of the light, but for rest.

&#x200B;

***Two hours before bedtime, dim your lights.***

\- With this, you stimulate your natural biological clock. Light a candle.

&#x200B;

**Two possible challenges and corresponding possible solutions:**

1. No time!
2. Boring...

&#x200B;

1. New evening ritual is going to eventually buy you time. Better sleep makes for more

productivity.

2) If you get restless when you sit still or suddenly do less, that resistance is a good sign because awareness is the first step to change. You were obviously used to being busy on your screen and watching an exciting movie or series. It may help to do something lightly active such as a puzzle, sudoku or going for a walk. If you still find it difficult, keep your goal in mind, sleeping better is going to pay off for you big time. Give the quiet evening ritual a chance and persevere!

&#x200B;

*Tips for food and drink:*

\- No alcohol

\- No caffeine (coffee, black (iced) tea, cola, energy drinks and chocolate) after lunch

\- Time your food right: after a full meal, wait 3 hours before going to bed. A light snack, for example, a cracker, can't hurt.

&#x200B;

***Give yourself a break***

Get rid of those screens, caffeine, lights out and candles on, now you get to nicely relax! Avoid anything difficult, intense or complicated. So no difficult conversations, no intense exercise and no complicated chores. These will disturb your sleep.

&#x200B;

*Tip:*

Set an alarm two hours before bedtime, so that you start the relaxed evening ritual on time so that you can sleep better. Then you will stop all the busy things you were doing in time.

&#x200B;

***Organize your bedtime routine***

Have a conscious and fixed bedtime routine, that way your body knows it's bedtime.

&#x200B;

***No need to rush: take it easy in the two hours before bed.***

&#x200B;

*6 styling tips for your bedroom*

Do:

1. Make sure your bed is comfortable
2. Open your window (cool room of around 18 degrees, but a warm bed)
3. Make sure you have blackout curtains (No artificial light from outside)

Don't:

1. The (front of your) alarm clock (Don't look at your alarm clock)
2. Screens (What can be done; reading on an e-reader. Or watching very quiet TV or Netflix)
3. Office stuff (don't work in your bedroom)

&#x200B;

***Spend the last half hour of the day sluggishly***

&#x200B;

***Summary take away 6 sleep inhibitors***

1. Screens off
2. No caffeine
3. Lights dimmed
4. No difficult conversations
5. Fixed evening routine
6. No haste

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I‚Äôm a NE native and thinking about my next steps in my early 20s. There are a lot of places I could see myself being happy in, and Portland Maine is one I‚Äôve really been drawn to.


My friends in their early/mid 20s, what is life like for you? Do you spend most of your time at home, in coffee shops/restaurants/bars, doing outdoor recreation, or anything else really? I have heard Portland is quite artsy and has a fun scene for young people in terms of vintage/thrift shopping and such.

I‚Äôm an easygoing and social person. Not into fancy or glitz and glam. Prefer to travel by foot or transit, but I do have a car. Very progressive/leftist politically and socially. I enjoy a moderately paced life, not slow per se, but never rushed. I like to do things in my own time without stressing about being behind or not going fast enough: a sensation I‚Äôve felt a lot growing up in southern New England.

Any perspectives would be greatly appreciated! I work in the public sector and am looking into short term service based fellowships and programs.",0,1733453873.0,portlandme,1,0.2,False

1h7rb4x,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1h7rb4x/4_years_ago_my_parents_found_out_i_was_a_lesbian/,"4 years ago my parents found out I was a lesbian and rejected me. I convinced them it wasn‚Äôt true, but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever be able to be honest about my sexuality with anyone again.","

I (21F) have known I was different since I was young. Nothing about how I present myself screams gay, and nobody knows. I grew up in San Francisco with no community pressure to suppress myself, yet I‚Äôve always seen this thing about myself as a bad thing. I‚Äôve never told a single person that I‚Äôm gay, but people I know have definitely seen me on tinder. Somehow, I‚Äôm ok with people finding out indirectly, but absolutely unable to say the words out loud. I can‚Äôt even admit that I‚Äôm gay to a friend I‚Äôve known since elementary school who is gay herself. It‚Äôs a mix of shame and disgust and a lack of confidence that has created this level of repression, I think. More than anything, I‚Äôm embarrassed to be the lesbian, for this to be how people see me. I‚Äôve never been on a date with a girl, or kissed a girl. Partly this is due to lack of opportunity, but also because of my deep fear that someone will see/find out.

4 years ago, during my senior year of high school, my mom found my reddit account because our emails were connected (no idea why, I don‚Äôt think we even realized she was still getting some of my emails on this old account) and I had gotten some random notification that took her to my Reddit. She found something that I had written about being gay. The next morning I came downstairs to her having locked the door to the living room, and when I asked her what was going on she wouldn‚Äôt answer me. I left the house to get a coffee, confused, and when I came home my parents were both sitting there waiting for me. My mom told me what she‚Äôd read and my heart dropped. I couldn‚Äôt breath. Within a minute she was screaming and crying. ‚ÄúIm disgusted by lesbians‚Äù. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre out of this house the second you graduate high school. I won‚Äôt have you living here‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm disgusted by you‚Äù ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt look at you‚Äù. On and on. My dad was crying and trying to counter her a bit, saying they loved me but falling wayyyyy short of anything but being on her side. I was sobbing. And the only words I could say through my tears were ‚Äúwhat am I supposed to do?‚Äù. I said this again and again. Through these words, I think I was trying to express that I agreed with her. I had spent at least the past 4 years feeling disgusted with who I was, praying I was confused, horrified about what this meant for my future. And knowing I was powerless to change it. So when she expressed her disgust, all I could say was ‚Äúwhat am I supposed to do?‚Äù.

Eventually, I escaped to my room. And somehow within the next few days I convinced my parents that I had posted what she found while at a friends house, and that the two of us had been fucking around and pretending to be gay to make fun of lesbians. They believed me, or at least wanted to believe me enough that they went with it. Still, my mom refused to leave that locked living room for 2 weeks. She couldn‚Äôt see me or speak to me, she was so disgusted with her daughter.

4 years later, this has been ‚Äúforgotten‚Äù. I haven‚Äôt had any long term boyfriends, but have provided enough breadcrumbs of interested in boys to keep the pressure off. Every once in a while my mom will question me with an air of judgement or disgust if I wear something less feminine etc. And I avoid anything gay-related like the plague. Anyway, I feel that the trauma of this experience has been deeply intertwined in my mind with coming out or talking about my sexuality. When it happened, I was just beginning to work through my own self-hatred and consider that I‚Äôd come out on day. This shut that down immediately. I have never been able to get the words out to anyone. Even this summer, I told my friend (who‚Äôs also gay) that I had something to tell her the next time we were together, and that she should hold me to it because I‚Äôd be too scared probably when the time came. And yet I still couldn‚Äôt get the words out, even knowing there was no way she‚Äôd be anything but accepting. I think it‚Äôs because the fear isn‚Äôt of what she‚Äôd think, but because saying it out loud makes me the disgusting and shameful person I feel that I am. The world doesn‚Äôt hate me, I hate myself. I know this isn‚Äôt true, but my moms words have gotten to my core, and I feel too much shame to ever be who I am.",2,1733453494.0,self,6,0.75,False

1h7r7b5,https://www.reddit.com/r/LivingEssentials/comments/1h7r7b5/how_much_is_vitamix_blender/,How much is Vitamix blender?,"Hey everyone! I've been using my Vitamix blender for about two years now, and I get a lot of questions about the price and whether it's worth the investment. So, I thought I'd break down everything you need to know about Vitamix blender prices and what you get for your money.

Let's be real - Vitamix blenders aren't cheap. They typically range from $350 to $650, depending on the model and features. I remember being shocked at the price tag when I first started shopping for one. But here's the thing: they're actually worth every penny.

The entry-level models like the Explorian series start around $350. The popular Professional Series and Ascent Series usually fall between $500-$600. You can check out the current prices here: https://athometouch.com/vitamixblender

What makes them so expensive? First off, these things are built like tanks. My parents have had theirs for 15 years, and it still works perfectly. The motor is incredibly powerful - we're talking 2-2.3 horsepower. For comparison, most regular blenders are around 500 watts (less than 1 horsepower).

I use mine for everything:
- Smooth smoothies (no chunks!)
- Hot soups (the friction from the blades actually heats it up)
- Nut butters
- Frozen desserts
- Dough mixing
- Even grinding coffee beans

The warranty is pretty impressive too - most models come with a 7-10 year warranty. When you break down the cost over that time, it's actually pretty reasonable.

If you're interested in comparing different models and their prices, you can find the full range here: https://athometouch.com/vitamixblender

Some money-saving tips I've learned:
1. Watch for holiday sales
2. Consider certified reconditioned models (they're like new but cheaper)
3. Some retailers offer payment plans
4. Look for bundle deals

I know it seems like a big investment upfront, but think about it this way: if you're spending $5 on smoothies a few times a week, your Vitamix will pay for itself within a year. Plus, you're getting a machine that can replace several kitchen appliances.

When I bought mine, I actually saved money by waiting for Black Friday. The price dropped by about $100, which made the decision much easier. Now I use it almost every day, and I honestly can't imagine going back to a regular blender.

Just remember - the cheapest option isn't always the most cost-effective in the long run. I went through three cheaper blenders before finally investing in my Vitamix, and I wish I'd just bought it sooner.

Hope this helps anyone who's on the fence about making the investment! Let me know if you have any questions about specific models or features.",1,1733453163.0,LivingEssentials,0,1.0,False

Had to pop the panels off to install new outer doors so figured it would be the perfect time to clean them up. I am super happy with how well the vinyl paint came out and it feels pretty durable. The arm rest I am still working on, currently printing another version of it - that will get painted to match the panel eventually. Also I will be doing a proper upholster on it, I cut a piece of wood and threw that together in about ten minutes.

1h7qzke,https://www.reddit.com/r/urticaria/comments/1h7qzke/what_worked_for_me/,What worked for me,"I suffered from chronic hives for nearly a year, despite following a highly restrictive diet that eliminated all animal proteins. I would break out daily, and even simple activities like riding a bike or walking short distances would trigger painful welts.

After working with an allergy specialist who only prescribed increasingly higher doses of antihistamines, I sought help from a naturopath. They took a holistic approach, focusing on healing my gut and identifying food sensitivities through an IgG test.

My treatment plan consisted of:

1. Eliminating all foods flagged on the IgG test
2. Supplementing with L-glutamine
3. Adding beef gelatin to my diet
4. Drinking nettle leaf tea

I also made two additional changes:

1. Avoiding coffee on an empty stomach
2. Eliminating diet soda and other acidic drinks

Over several weeks, I gradually started to feel better, and through a very restrictive diet, I was able to get my hives under control.

I've since reintroduced the eliminated foods to identify triggers. Here's what I've found:

1. Pork  products trigger my hives
2. I can tolerate eggs, but need to cut them out if I start breaking out consistently
3. Coffee and soda exacerbate my acid reflux, which can lead to new breakouts. To manage this, I need to eliminate these triggers and focus on healing and calming my body.

This journey has helped me develop a deeper appreciation for naturopathic science and for gut health.

I hope my story offers some insight and encouragement to those navigating their own health journeys. Wishing everyone health, peace, and a deeper understanding of their own unique path to wellness

Hi! Just wanted to get some advice on my situation. 

My boyfriend and I have been together for over 6 years. We‚Äôve been living together for 3 years. 

In our first year of living together, he lost his job and I ended up having to cover our rent, groceries, vet bills, etc. 

In our second and third year of living together, he was also partially employed for both years. Similarly, I had to cover our rent, bills and all necessities during these times (around 4-6 months each year). I was even able to cover a nice holiday overseas where I paid for costs. 

Due to his work situation for the past couple of years, he hasn‚Äôt been able to build savings. Because I‚Äôve been covering costs for both of us, I also had to dig into my savings at times. 

I referred him for a role in my company, and he‚Äôs been here for a couple of months now. We moved in with his parents so we pay considerably less in rent. 

He is earning a stable pay check every fortnight but struggles to save money. He says that because I earn more than him, I should be paying for more of our leisure costs. I don‚Äôt disagree with this statement as I believe we should pay things proportionately. To support this, I opened a joint account where we both get cards and contribute proportionately. He never activated his card. 

When I offer to pay for things, he will often insist that he pays, so I don‚Äôt pay for some coffees/food. 

He says that the issue lays in me not paying when he tells me he wants to pay. I said that if he doesn‚Äôt want to pay for something, then to not insist on paying. He said that I should be more considerate that he doesn‚Äôt earn as much as me/have savings and I should fight him to pay for the bill. He thinks that even though he insists to pay, I should also insist to pay because it is important to him that he offers. 

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair for him to expect me to second guess when he offers? I think that if he doesn‚Äôt want to pay, then he shouldn‚Äôt offer. 

I‚Äôve talked to him about it but we haven‚Äôt resolved this issue. 

I‚Äôm trying to find a compromise and would appreciate some advice! How can I approach this? ",1,1733452322.0,relationship_advice,5,1.0,False

I got home expecting it would be ready he said he forgot. Now I get that people forget things. But last week I had also asked him to put something in the oven and he didn‚Äôt respond when I messaged him so I called him to see if he saw the text, he said yes. So I said can you cook this item, Which then followed up with questions of well how do I cook it what do I use even though the item took as much effort as chicken wings. So two weeks in a row I asked a simple question and couldn‚Äôt just count on him to do it. It  feels like weaponized incompetence because I know he knows how to cook things. Is he a great cook? no, but he can put things in the oven.  So I asked him to please try to put things in the oven. He got upset and then  told me something I forgot thathe tells me all the time to close the computer and I forgot and he did it for me and he just moved on from his life.

I hope the consequences of her actions hit in the face soon,"This is a tale about my fiance's friend's wedding day and the marriage that followed. So many things happened within this couple's relationship that it's just insane. These are just some points of major things that have happen. Also I don't have a problem with any of the age gaps that are given in the story. I have a problem with the lack of maturity from these people. All of our ages today to give some context: Myself (25f), my fiance(30m), groom (28m), and the bride(33f). Through this post I will be calling the bride and groom as such just to keep things easy. They met and started dating in 2021 I believe. Some of these events happened before, during, and after the wedding. I'll put it all in chronological order. 

- My fiance, the best friend and later the groom's best man, had explicitly expressed to the groom that he didn't like the bride. This was because she was such a contrast compared to the groom's personality conflicting moral values between the couple. The groom is simple, slightly autistic, and very sweet guy. The bride is about 5-6 years older than him but acts like she's only 21 and wasts to party like she's in a frat. She goes out partying and drinking every weekend without her now husband. She spends absurd amount of money and refuses to disclose with him how much she's spending. She is very self-centered. I would even describe her as an attention whore. 
- The groom is not allowed to have any privacy or secrets. The bride has to know where he is 24/7. This was even a rule back when they were dating. If she wants anything he had to respond within 5 minutes. If he didn't get back to her immediately, she freaks out and starts calling/texting him non-stop until he answered the phone. Usually she wouldn't have a good reason and just wanted his attention cause she was bored. She would claim to have a panic attack if he didn't answer on the first call and blame him for her high emotions. She always says it's because she was so stressed she couldn't reach him and thought something bad would happen. She'd say she needed him on call for her own peace of mind. (Side note: He's one of the most loyal people you'll ever meet. He's always got your back. He's never once done anything unfaithful in any relationship. He only has eyes for his wife so there's no way this could be due to past infidelity on his part. I think this is her own projection. We'll talk more about that in a minute) (Another important note: usually when she's going out drinking with friends it's not in the town we all live in. She usually drives back to her hometown which is about an hour's drive from here. She then spends the whole weekend with her friends and barely any communication with her now husband.)
- The bride expected her privacy and secrets unconditionally. She refuses to have any contact with him if she is out with her friends in any capacity. She gets frustrated and complain openly in front of their friends, family, and even strangers that he tries to text her at any point during her evening. Usually her evenings are spent out drinking with her friends and trying to get hit on by other people. She openly flirts with men at the bar. She also only wears super revealing clothing when she'd flirt with people at bars. This super low plunge neckline on a skin tight brightly colored dress. And this dress barely covers her ass. Like it slides up everytime she sits or bends. She always claimed it was because she just was trying to get free drinks to ""save money"". I don't buy it. I wouldn't flirt with somebody for free drinks if I was in a relationship with someone else. But that's just me and my morals. 

- ON TO THE WEDDING! Thier wedding took place in spring of 2023. On the wedding day, the bride refuse to communicate with anyone outside of her wedding party. She ""wanted to live in the moment and telling people what to do would kill that moment for her"". I can understand and respect that to a certain degree. However, we couldn't get a hold of her at all. At first, we had some questions about setting up decorations for the wedding and reception. She had left vague directions but it was hard to understand. Like she thought there would be more room for the number of tables she had us set up. There was no way we'd fit all the tables and chairs in the room. Very early in the morning, she began to refused any phone calls or texts from anyone. One of her bridesmaids was supposed to be the point of communication but got super intoxicated before the wedding, we think she just forgot. We would call both of them to try and get an answer out of the bride. It was so stressful and frustrating, especially when she was 45 minutes late to her own wedding with no communication! Not going to lie, I genuinely thought she stood up the groom last minute. 

-Here's some info on why the bride showed up 45 minutes late to her own wedding. She still wasn't even dressed or fully done with hair and makeup. They'd been drinking since 9am-ish. The ceremony didn't start till 3pm. Lots of champagne. She was so drunk that she was wobbling the whole time. She almost slipped in the bathroom trying to get into her dress with her BM's drunkenly giggling. She was swaying while saying her vows and I was genuinely worried she would fall over. She kept swaying slightly the whole night. These ladies also drove 30 minutes to the venue and were all intoxicated. Yikes! I'm so glad they didn't crash. They all continued to drink the rest of the night. From what I understand, they didn't have a very fun time the next morning. 

- THE BRIDE'S OBSESSION! I knew the bride had an obsession, but I didn't realize how extreme it was! She had always talked about how much she loved zebras. She had full arm and leg sleeve tattoos of penguins. Think big and bold and bright colors.  She always wears zebra on her shirts, pants, and hats. I found out about her special room. Apparently in their apartment she had designated one of the bedrooms to be her zebra room. I thought maybe she had some little toys or something in there from childhood. Nope. She has the entire second bedroom filled with zebra themed stuff. There are shelves that go from ceiling to floor on every wall full of zebra memorabilia. I'm talking stuffed animals, snow globes, coffee mugs, t-shirts, slippers, beanies, you name it. She took up an entire bedroom with all of this stuff plus a small electric piano and refused to let her now husband put anything of his in that room. I went over to their apartment for the first time and saw firsthand the zebra takeover. There were zebras throughout their entire apartment. Every throw pillow had a zebra on it. Every blanket had this animal. There were zebras on everything. 
- While at the their apartment for the first time, I also noticed the bride had several photos up. Lots of frame photos of her with her family and friends. I only saw one picture of the bride and groom together on their wedding day. All the other pictures were just of the bride and her people. If the groom hadn't been the one to open the door, I would have never guessed he even lived there. The entire apartment was decorated to her liking alone. He had one small corner in the living room next to the front door where he had his computer and some old world war II memorabilia. He likes history and historic firearms. He got one corner right next to the front door and she got the rest of the apartment. 
-She also has a bad habit of adopting animals for attention. What I mean by this is she buys exotic animals and then takes them out to the bars when she's trying to get these free drinks. She does it as a way of attention seeking. For a long time she had a big python. She would wrap this thing around her neck all times of the year and carry it around. Mind you, we also live in a state where we experience extremes of all four seasons. I'm talking negative degree weather in the winter and over 100¬∞ in the summer. This animal was constantly being paraded around. She did the same thing with a bearded dragon and with ferrets. She ended up having 3 ferrets at once plus a very poorly trained dog. This terrier mutt with a lot of energy. She'd take them all out and show them off. At the time of posting this she had eventually gotten rid of all of her reptiles, was down to only one ferret, still had this crazy dog, and decided to adopt a cat as a way to process her emotions after loosing a parent figure. I understand that people process grief in different ways. But she immediately turned around and adopted this cat  after her husband specifically said no more animals. Important note: the groom never wanted pets. He just doesn't like to have animals in the apartment. But she came with the ferrets and the dog. He did not sign up for that cat. 

- SECRET CREDIT CARDS!!!!!!! About 10 months after the wedding, the groom calls my fiance. He's upset and doesn't know what to do. The groom just had someone from a collection agency show up at their apartment stating that his new bride had large amounts of credit card debt! He didn't even know she had this credit cards! Apparently she had secret credit cards that she never told them about. She claimed she never thought it was important to tell him since they weren't combining most of their finances. She also said some she didn't use and just forgot about. That it was just sitting with all the other cards. That's why she never paid them off (I call BS btw). By this point, they each had their individual accounts and now one joint account where they would put money in to pay bills. After talking more, we later found out that she started putting less and less money in the joint account and was expecting him to cover most of their finances. She would use the money that she was hiding to go on spontaneous trips and continued bar hopping with all of her friends. I try to stay out people's personal financial decisions. But from my understanding, the groom ended up dipping into his personal savings (saving to buy a home for them) and used that to pay off her credit card debt. From what I've been told, the bride didn't have to pay any of the debt from her personal account. She had no consequences to any of her actions except for some embarrassment because people found out. But even that embarrassment was short-lived because she continues making the same financial decisions to this day. 
- at the time of writing this they have had their One year marriage anniversary. The groom has completely surrendered his account to her. Meaning she has complete control of all of their finances. He doesn't even look at it anymore. He has absolutely no idea how much money is going into the shared account to pay off bills and how much is going into savings. He has to now ask her before he can spend any money at all. This includes any groceries, clothes, necessities, fun stuff, or luxuries. He's not allowed to buy any new video games or new parts for his hobbies. Sometimes he's not even allowed to hang out with friends because it's too much gas money. However, the bride is able to spend hundreds of dollars in a week on new clothes and makeup. She is constantly posting new outfits on social media and new makeup looks. She's also posting all these different hairstyles. Things like getting banged spontaneously or getting your hair professionally braided with extensions. I looked up the beautician she goes to for these braids and they're not cheap. They are high quality but definitely not cheap. At least $500 for the braids and that's not including the brightly colored extensions that get put in. Why I point this out is cause she went through a phase where she was getting a new set of braids ever 2-4weeks. Like all new colors and patterns. This couple is basically living paycheck to paycheck mind you. 

- last point! ACCUSATIONS OF INFIDELITY! A very long story made as short as possible, the maid of honor (form the bride's wedding) broke up with her long-term boyfriend of about 5 years. Idk why. It was a messy breakup. She was about 48 while he was about 26 at the time of the wedding. Neither one handled the breakup very well. The ex-boyfriend called the groom after the breakup. He told the groom that when she'd go to her hometown, he'd see the bride leaving bars with random guys, hooking up in cars, and then coming back in to continue drinking with her friends. (The guy would often be the DD so the Bride and MOH. This way the ladies could get really drunk and not pay for an Uber). He didn't have any evidence like pictures or videos. He even admitted that he oftentimes covered for the bride so she could ""get it on"" with random dudes. The groom didn't believe any of it. He then yelled at him on the phone, hung up, and blocking him. The guy never reached out after that. The groom came over immediately after to tell my fiance and I all about this ""crazy accusation"". I felt so sick to my stomach because it honestly made sense that she would go out and cheat on him. I couldn't look him in the eye. We have tried to talk to about things like this in the past. Specifically the credit card problems as examples to her controlling nature. We've pointed out how it's super toxic how she can do whatever she wants with no accountability and he's expected to lay everything out for her and be at her beck and call. Every time we have these conversations with him he shuts us down or defends her. He claims it's not her fault and she just has this kind of personality. Or she just doesn't think things through. He basically has the view that if something were to happen it would be the other person's fault. Like his wife can do no wrong. That if she was to sleep with someone and we had proof he would find a way to blame the guy she was hooking up with. He'd find some way to justify his wife's actions and make it seem like she's innocent in all of this. He's in so deep and we can't pull him out. And before someone says I need to help out and get him out of there, he does have a history of immediately cutting people out of his life. If he doesn't like what they're saying. Saying. He's done it on many occasions for much pettier things. An example would be one time someone forgot to invite him to dinner. Like a super small group of friends going to get dinner at a BBQ chain restaurant. The groom was so salty about it. He cut the guy out of his life and has never talked to him since. He always talks about him in such an awful way. He genuinely thinks this guy is out to get him slowly because he wasn't invited to one dinner with a couple other people. The groom also wasn't even living in the same town at the time. 

It's all really unfortunate. And it's really hard for my fiance. He really wants to help his friend out and can see all these behaviors and things happening cause he's on the outside. It's just unfortunate that the groom is so dedicated that he can't see any of the red flags that are flying constantly in his face. I get that love is blind sometimes, but this is a bit much in my opinion. The groom has the capability and understanding that if this was happening to anyone else he would recognize that this was toxic behavior and a bad relationship. But because it's happening in his marriage he can't see any of it. Or if he does he's defending it and claiming ""she just doesn't know what she's doing is wrong"" or ""she'd never be like that. We have such open communication"". We're finally at a point where we're just letting them figure it out. We'll be there if the groom ever sees the light. We'll be there to support him in whatever way we can. As for the bride, we try and keep our distance from her. ",5,1733452049.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,1,0.86,False

Do the council of dykes bless this?,"Spent the last 2 months a mess over my ex. Went on a coffee date before thanks giving and it went well, so tonight we met up at a brewery and had a couple drinks.

We talked about all kinds of stuff: old relationships, what we want, her kid... Just everything!! We were vibing. We stopped on the way out to order burritos from a food truck, and we were very giggly and silly. She told me she broke up with her last girl because ""after 4 dates she hardly wanted to kiss me!!""

Shs got me a burrito, but she had to rush home so I walked her to her car. She asked if she could kiss me. Next thing I know, we're making out in a freezing December parking lot and it was SO HOT!!! She complimented my giggling... I even grabbed her butt mid sesh ü´¢

Anyway. Now I'm home eating my burrito on cloud nine. She texted to make sure that I got home okay and I told her I couldn't wait to kiss her some more, to her enthusiastic agreement. I'm so happy y'all... Just wanted to share...",9,1733451386.0,askadyke,1,0.91,False
