1i2eq3o,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNYC/comments/1i2eq3o/how_to_get_out_of_a_lease_with_an_unstable/,How to get out of a lease with an unstable roommate,"


My roommate has become increasingly unstable. I can’t do anything in the apartment without her screaming at me and telling me how horrible I am. We have a few more months on the lease but at this point I’m desperate to get out and I do worry that she is unstable enough to mess with my food and toiletries. 

A few nights ago I put a pot in the sink while I put my dinner down in my room. She immediately started screaming how disgusting I was to leave a dish in the sink even though I had turned back around to clean it. 

I leave 3 strands of hair in the shower on accident, I’m texted a paragraph about how dirty I am or she just screams. 

She is destroying my furniture and I believe on purpose. But not enough to warrant full damage. She shoved my dining table so hard the legs wobbled and the back of a chair had a small gash in it from the chair hitting a corner. I discovered my coffee table covered in glue and rings from drinks a few days ago. 
She was damaging the dining table because she demanded we make room for her peloton. I ended up giving the table to a friend to hold onto so she could have her peloton. Now we don’t have a dining area which was also where we would work remote. 

When I communicate needing to get up early, it’s noise all night no matter how nicely I ask her to use head phones. 

She works remote and never leaves the apartment or our living room. I haven’t been able to relax in my living room in weeks. That’s also why I didn’t notice the damage to the coffee table until now. 

If there’s a day I can watch tv, the second I put down the remote to use the toilet she changes the channel and takes over the living room. Like fully exits out of Netflix or whatever show I had on. 

She won’t take out the trash and I’ve seen her clean twice but if I even mention something being her turn to clean she immediately starts screaming about it being my mess and how filthy I am. 

When I do work remote she has zero respect for my calls and get angry at me for asking her to pause music or the TV. She blasts the tv all day. 

The kicker is our apartment is spotless. I’ve had two dates over in the last 4 months and they both were shocked by her behavior and both said the space was really nice. The guy I’m seeing now recently spent the night and she made noise all night outside my room. 

There’s so much more I could add here but I’m desperate to get out. I’m essentially stuck in my room at home and avoiding coming home. If I do anything she dislikes it’s instant verbal abuse. 

I can’t afford to just break the lease or find a new spot and pay double rent. My mental health is declining and it’s impacting my work. I told the landlord that I do think she’ll become physical at some point and they just don’t care. Please help! ",1,1736994676.0,AskNYC,0,1.0,False
1i2eq1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuantifiedSelf/comments/1i2eq1b/looking_for_feedback_on_my_tracking_app/,Looking for feedback on my tracking app,"I've been working on a tracking app with what I think are some unique features which I think would serve the users of this subreddit nicely. I haven't worked on it for a few months so would love to get some feedback to finally decide whether it's worth resuming development or not. It's still a little rough around the edges but fully functional [Momentum Tracker](https://momentumtracker.app)

*What gets measured gets managed* 

**Motivation for building the app**

I've designed the app to make it easy to ""measure"" by making it as frictionless as possible to input data whilst still capturing detailed information. On the ""manage"" side, I wanted to allow users to view their data at a detailed level, and also view correlations at a detailed level. For example with other trackers you may record you drank a ""coffee"", but this leaves omits information such as how much sugar, calories, caffeine etc there is. Even if you can add that data, it's often siloed inside each ""habit"". If you had ""Coffee"" and ""Snacks"", you often can't view the total caloric value. With my app, that's not the case as the underlying data is what's important, not the name of the habit.

I also added some AI features (just hear me out!) where instead of a numeric value, you can supply a prompt as the value and the AI will autofill that value. It'll also use any other data you submitted as context. If you went for a 1 mile run and don't know how many calories you burned you can instead put in a prompt and AI will fill in that value for you based on a 1 mile distance. Similarly you can add a photo and the AI will use that as context. Eg take a snap of the run stats from your treadmill, and AI will extract the information for you. The app will also extract the date/time from the photo so you could simply take a photo after each run and upload the images as a batch for the week. I've found this really useful for recording my weight progression without having to resort to getting a smart scale. I've found this really useful especially because taking a photo is already very frictionless. You could also use this to ""import"" data from another app by taking a screenshot.

**How to use the app**  
You create a reusable actions, eg Coffee.  
You add labels to the action. For Coffee that might be ""sugar"", ""caffeine"", ""calories"". There are no units, but you can add it to the label for convenience ""sugar(g)"" ""caffeine(mg). You can even add the same label multiple times with different units ""sugar(g)"" ""sugar(tbsp)"". If you can't be bothered to convert the values you could instead supply a prompt ""Convert the sugar(g) value to table spoon"".

Some values scale linearly, some do not, some are always the same. Eg a Run is one Run whether you go for a 1 mile run or a 10 mile run. Calories burned on a run scales linearly with distance. The duration of the run is always going to be different. So the action might look like

Run

* distance(miles) - 1 - linear
* calories - -100 - linear
* run sessions - 1 - fixed
* time(minutes) - slider(manual input)
* run-speed - *average run speed in miles/hour* \- prompt

Theres also a timer feature the the duration is used as quantity.

**Linking Action state with Labels**

This is kind of a checklist feature. You can have the action highlighted as Completed or Blocked based on that value of any label. A simple use case would be going for a daily run. You'd link the action with ""run sessions"" with a target value 1 and it would be marked as completed after each run. A more complex use case might be if you wanted to create an allowance system. You can have that snack only if your daily caloric intake is less than your target.

**Viewing Data**

You can view the data on the Charts. Add a new Chart Group and add the labels you want to view, along with whether you want to view the sum, average, or raw data.

If you have any questions, or feature suggestions just ask away!

1i2eou7,https://www.reddit.com/r/chubbytravel/comments/1i2eou7/one_only_cape_town_review_ama/,One & Only Cape Town Review & AMA,"Hey friends, excited to get back into posting more reviews in 2025 as our travel ramps back up post-holidays! Full disclosure, this stay was done by a wonderful member of my team named Sarah. Not to be confused with u/sarahwlee, who in fact has a member on her team named Alex (different Alex than me) - so it's really just quite a mess and we may need to rename everyone here soon lol.

My last visit to OO Cape Town was in 2022 so it's been a minute and I was thrilled to get Sarah in for an updated stay. As I aim to visit more properties more often - I can't physically get to all of them. I will have members of my team going one place while I go to another, bringing you reviews from all over the world at once :). Sarah was around South Africa the past week+ scoping out spots and I'll be in Turks & Caicos for the long weekend going to visit: The Palms, Amanyara & Grace Bay Club. After that I'll be heading to Bora Bora for Four Seasons Bora Bora & The Brando in a couple weeks.

**Where we went**: One & Only Cape Town

**When we went**: January 2025

**Who went**: Couple (Sarah & her husband)

**Room type**: Marina Table Mountain Room

**Overview**: One & Only Cape Town is a property for those looking to bop around in the mix of the city while still having a luxurious retreat at the end of the day. Historically I've promoted Ellerman House (also stayed on this trip, review coming soon), tbh it's still my favorite. I love the picturesque cliffside location and understated vibe when you drive up, not knowing that just beyond the gates is this spectacular, perfectly renovated yet authentic, ultra-private mansion. Plus I'm a REAL sucker for the snack room - last time I was there I skipped two meals in favor of the snacks. However, in 2025 I'm trying to expand my repertoire because obviously there are many great hotels in CT and some people do want to be in the city. And so that is how Sarah's visit to O&O CT came to be! PS - we are still working on our photo taking skills so mixed in here are some of Sarah's pics and some from Kerzer. I'll label where relevant. The really profesh photo's are Kerzer's lol.

**Property**: 9/10

Forming the backbone of the property is the Marine Rise building. With 91 rooms & suites along with the main entrance, lobby and restaurants, this is the central hub of the property. While the exterior of the building is fairly unremarkable, once you walk into the main lobby, the majesty of Table Mountain overwhelms you as you take it in through enormous floor to ceiling glass windows. As the mountain rises beyond the grounds of the property, any fleeting thought of the lackluster exterior is long gone. This natural wonder of Cape Town is truly breathtaking. I’ll say, this is where O&O has Ellerman House beat. 

[Post reno](https://preview.redd.it/x065om84o9de1.png?width=2116&format=png&auto=webp&s=14f97494bbd2c7a89215c7423ee578c9877174a0)

[Photo pre-reno](https://preview.redd.it/36lxp1r6o9de1.png?width=1648&format=png&auto=webp&s=65319c9b75455fb6fc788b59e692fc21dcb7c480)

In front of the Table Mountain view is the circular lobby bar which has a beautiful sculpture by the artist, Trzebinski. This sculpture depicts the local legend, ""The Watchers."" According to the legend, Table Mountain is one of four Watchers, giants of natural form created by Mother Earth to protect the land from the Great Sea Dragon. The view of this sculpture with the mountain behind is really quite special.

[Kerzer photo](https://preview.redd.it/8wzmp1l3k9de1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3706b3a06be2cbe3589dd1f47d29e9f507a7fbf4)

Beyond the lobby lies your first glimpse of the manmade islands of the property. These islands are One & Only's way of bringing local nature back into the resort. As many of you may know, central to O&O's design ethos is creating a sense of place that is not only culturally relevant, but just as important, provides a tribute to the natural environment of the destination. While this property is in the midst of the city, they have brought elements of the original nature back through these islands. The lush, over planted land feels more like a garden oasis than a hotel. As soon as you step foot outside Marine Rise you can hear the call of birds unlike anything you're used to in a city property. 



[Obviously Kerzer, lol](https://preview.redd.it/siexewn1q9de1.png?width=2254&format=png&auto=webp&s=dce431847672357e9e9f3354f0841955fec35216)

While the Marine Rise building may feel more like a city hotel, the islands are where everything changes. As you head toward them, you are enveloped by near forest cover - and it's with this that you're able to forget, if only briefly, that you're in the middle of a bustling city. The islands are home to the spa, pool and 41 rooms. The infinity pool is a highlight and since it's heated, it can be enjoyed year round.

[Kerzer photo](https://preview.redd.it/6wk9eus5l9de1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=513e6d0736c05b7f8dbe46dee4d6643e40b9c611)

The reason I'm giving the property an 8.5 not a 10 is twofold

1. While the islands are lush and beautiful, I do feel parts of the exterior to the Marina Rise building feels starkly less lush and so some of the beauty and integration is lost there.
2. In my experience, One & Only is uniquely successful at integrating the local aesthetic and art into their design ethos to create a property that feels authentic while maintaining the calm and chic One & Only retreat experience. But for some reason, certain pieces of the common spaces within the Marina Rise building doesn’t execute this as flawlessly as some other properties and feels a bit frenetic. I don’t pretend to be a design critic, and if you saw the interior of my home you’d be appalled, but it’s something about the mix of colors, patterns and materials that doesn’t feel as serene and elegant as many of the other OO properties. Locations like OO Mandarina and OO Gorilla's Nest are able to imbibe the local aesthetic and blend it with their unique design eye to create a soothing and chic yet entirely authentic sense of place. I just don’t feel that with OO Cape Town.

**Rooms**: 8.5/10

The property was completely renovated in 2022 - all 132 rooms were renovated. 91 of those rooms are in the Marina Rise building and 41 are on the island. The Marina Rise rooms were designed based on the raw beauty of the mountain, with earthy tones and textures.

[Sarah photo](https://preview.redd.it/yijkvsapk9de1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b20d5333dae229278bb80f058151b0e738cd95de)

The island rooms are all designed based on the ocean - so more blues. They have a view of the water surrounding the island and some have a view of the Marina Rise building. While the island rooms are entirely relaxing and tranquil, in terms of views, you don't see much of Cape Town so you really could be anywhere. Whereas the Marina Rise building offers those sweeping views of Table Mountain.

[Sarah photo](https://preview.redd.it/1devy85sk9de1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7ee7605aa9b316b542f3db7d36b6e29f8e057ed9)

The rooms are well sized for a city hotel. Like many OO's the layouts are great and use the space well. A large number of rooms don't have great views so that's why the lower rating.

**Service**: 7.5/10

* This is where things aren't as great.
* While all the staff are very friendly, welcoming, and there was amazing service everywhere we went  within the hotel, there were some hiccups on the service side of things to be aware of.
* The room cleaning and service seemed to be a bit clunky at times
   * A garbage bag was left in the room after the attendants came on the first day. Sarah moved it out of the way by the door to be taken the next time they came but it was left again.
   * There was a big ring mark (the size of a dinner plate) on top of the coffee counter that was sticky when they arrived , so it hadn’t been cleaned / wiped down from previous guests
   * They had 2 occasions where the do not disturb sign was on, but they rang the doorbell for the room - one of the occasions it was for a delivery but was for the wrong room, and the  second time they rang twice before leaving (we think it could have been for turn down  service, but the do not disturb was on).
   * With the cleaning and do not disturb sign issues, it did feel slightly clunky in service, but the staff  were so nice and helpful when you needed something. Would just be aware of it, and let guests  know what to expect.

**Food & Restaurants**: 

* **Rooi** \- just completed the renovations. This is where breakfast will be served in the mornings. Incredible view of table mountain, especially for the outdoor seating.  Breakfast is a full buffet daily from 6:30-11am. Rooi also offers dinner - more focused on South African cuisine cooked by fire.
* **Nobu** \- the only Nobu in Southern Africa. Recommend booking a table in advance, but  they do try to keep a few tables each night for in-house walk-ins.
* **Isola** \- Mediterranean poolside restaurant available daily during summer months. It is  generally closed from around May-October each year. During winter months, the in-room  dining can be ordered from the pool.
* **Vista bar & lounge** \- Amazing views in the heart of the hotel. A great place to go for a  drink or cocktail, they do offer meals as well. They have a popular afternoon tea from  2-5pm each day, recommended to be booked in advance. There is a live pianist during  the afternoon tea times daily, and live music in the lounge every evening.

**Extras & activities**: 

* Like all OO's, they work hard to provide a great Kids Club with dynamic programming",2,1736994572.0,chubbytravel,1,1.0,False

His name was Ralph. Im gonna put it to you plainly, Ralph was a straight up asshole douche. From what i remember, he’d act like a saint in front of my mother, right until the moment the door closed and we were alone. He would first ask me to play “rampage”, where id have to dress up in my old hockey gear head to toe and let him basically beat the shit out of me. 

      He’d go way too hard, and every time would eventually rip off my armor to just start hitting me normally. Always hitting me in places where the bruises wouldn’t be visible to my mom. Id always start crying and then he’d grab me by the neck and tell me to not say shit about this, it’s his only outlet as a bullied individual himself. And also he’d go on about how this was his only income so he would be homeless without me. So i made the virtuous decision to endure the beatings.

For a few weeks now i’ve been extremely tired. I’m 4 months postpartum and about a month ago got the nexplanon implant. I’m talking sleeping 14+ hours a day. My baby sleeps through the night, not much stress. I work a really laid back wfh job. 

I work early, but have caught myself falling asleep at my desk. I take naps during my lunch break daily. My older kiddo takes a nap 2 or so hours in the evening. I sleep when he sleeps (husband works from home too so he watches the baby), then i go to bed when i put my kids to bed. I’m wondering if it’s possibly the nexplanon causing extreme tiredness? 

I cannot make it throughout the day without a long nap. I have never felt the need to nap until recently. 

I saw my PCP yesterday but he said he hasn’t heard of that and suggested exercise. 

It’s starting to really affect my life, i don’t have energy to play with my kids. I end up drinking coffee throughout the day to be somewhat awake.

1. Let’s be real: the Siwas’ downfall began after JoJo’s coming out and “breaking” so many contracts with Nickelodeon’s partners. While I’m 100% an ally, I totally understand why Nickelodeon was pissed due to the overwhelming number of parents who wouldn’t allow their kids to watch JoJo or potentially any Nickelodeon content.

2. The Siwas’ revenue came mostly from the bows and JoJo-branded merchandise (as stated by Jess on Abby Lee’s podcast). Once they parted ways, JoJo started losing revenue significantly (though not to the point of being broke, of course).

3. Siwas Dance Pop Revolution (SPDR) was a flop. It only lasted one season with eight episodes. Surely they weren’t expecting that.

4. XOMG POP!, due to poor management, eventually died. Members were leaving (whether by force or not), the Rolling Stone article came out, and 5 Fingers Pictures had its contracts with brand partners annulled (Moose Toys in particular). The tour flopped (no blame on the kids—this was the adults’ fault). The group is “officially” over now, and somehow they removed everything as if the group never existed. This signals the loss of yet another revenue stream for the Siwas. It also marked another failure for the family to prove their power in the industry.

5. JoJo was dropped by Columbia Records (as she revealed in a recent podcast). She continues to rely on rage-baiting, which is not a sustainable strategy for fame. Her videos often have a like-to-dislike ratio that heavily favors dislikes—most of them have more dislikes than likes. This is another failure for the Siwas in proving their influence. By the way, check the view counts for Iced Coffee. Additionally, the album cover and lyric video (which has since been deleted) were AI-generated. JoJo also said she released the project by herself without Columbia’s help.

6. They’re now posting JoJo’s old content every week. Does this sound like a desperate attempt to earn revenue? Definitely!

Without us realizing it, the Siwas have been losing their power and jumping from one failure to another over the years.

All I can say is that karma is a B.
I do feel bad for all the girls and their parents. Imagine spending your and your kid’s childhood, money, and time just to be forgotten like that. These girls are extremely talented, even more so than Jojo who could barely sing (no offense, lol)

I’m glad some of the girls left earlier, whether by choice or coercion. At least they have more time to heal.

Now that the group is over and gone, I hope the girls could bloom individually and maybe hear more truth about the Siwas’ terrible management ",8,1736993822.0,xomgpop,1,0.9,False

It started around 5 years old
This was completely neglected, They said it was a learning difficulty, ADHD..
They even suspected that I was mentally retarded. 
It killed me inside 
Am I retarded?
How can I have this doubt???
I don't know.... And there are so many who have thought that about me...  
I was molested as a child by my mother, father, aunt...
I am forced to pretend that nothing happened ....
Well the consequences of this negligence were devastating...
During my childhood I was able to push with my belly... 
But that came at a price 
By the end of 2018 it was already deteriorating, I was in fifth grade at this time
But it exploded in 2019, everything falling apart, I don't remember very well, I lost a lot of my memory, but around September, October, November, December or so I started having sudden crying  for no reason, I remember I cried a lot in this times
But that's where my tears ended because after 2019 I really tried to cry, I haven't been able to cry for a few years now...
Then the dam broke in 2020 with the pandemic, and that year I was finally diagnosed with depression and anxiety
And from then on my depression only got worse over the years and never got better
I was admitted for suicidal ideation at the turn of the year for 2022 and spent my summer vacation there at the pachytrichus hospital
By 2023 I stopped being able to clean myself, often a month without taking a shower 

I'm Brazilian. Classes will start in February and I'm going into my third year of high school
I have the mind of a 6 year old
I have no dreams, goals, expectations, plans, horizons...
I'm only alive in the literal sense
And I don't even know how I didn't commit suicide and I'm alive now 
To tell you the truth, I'm not prepared to live after 14
...
I don't have any social life
I never leave the house 
And I don't know how to go grocery shopping alone, take a bus, use a credit card, make a coffee or anything
I know how to do what an 8 years old can do 
To tell the truth, even less 
At least I can take a shower, brush my teeth and eat by myself and get dressed only depression doesn't let go this
Today I'm going to try to take a shower and brush my teeth 
I know this is ridiculous to many, but....
I can't get out of bed 
....
But I will try at last
But today I was able to eat coffee and lunch...

The weight gain was gradual from 14 to 18. And I felt most comfortable in the 150s, I felt hungry when I weighed less but I started to feel a bit uncomfortable when higher. 

My family commented that I don’t look good by 145lbs-150lbs. My health was a comment but it was an afterthought. I started to rapidly put weight on after that as I tried to diet but I didn’t know how. I ate out a lot, and the amount of food I ate wasn’t exactly „huge” it was the cals. Eventually I got down to 160lbs, but I fluctuated between that and 150lbs. 

In my 20s I started grad school and lost a lot of friends so I no longer ate out socially. From age 21-24 I had physicals at the doctors and each time I lost weight. 160lbs— 151lbs— 143lbs— 137lbs.
I’m now around 133 but I don’t have a scale. My sister was always slim and she’s taller (5’7), my cousin is taller and also slim. So I guess it was jarring to them when I was suddenly near their weight because both accused me of unhealthy habits. They did so fairly early in the losing it journey too. 

I’ve never kept my weight to this before, and I got family saying I should „tone up” now. Or some friends saying like „oh stay at that weight” or saying that I’m their competition. Idk it’s very odd. Then I have some other family saying I’m too thin and I gotta eat.

I noticed with some of my slimmer peers (who’ve been so most their life), they will go low cal for their coffee, zero sugar drinks or water. Salad instead of fries. This goes for my sister and cousin. They watch what they eat in these manners and I don’t do that. But also they are smaller than me and I’m fine where I am tbh.",4,1736993577.0,loseit,0,0.7,False

Grok i need a simple daily routine that involves makeup,  exercise to grow my butt and legs and eating 3,000 calories a day
1 post

Here's a simple daily routine that incorporates makeup, targeted exercise for growing your butt and legs, and a 3,000 calorie diet:

Morning Routine:
Wake Up and Hydrate:
Drink a glass of water to start your day hydrated.
Exercise for Glutes and Legs (30-45 Minutes):
Warm-Up: 5-10 minutes of light cardio like walking or jumping jacks.
Workout:
Squats: 3 sets of 12-15 reps
Lunges: 3 sets of 12 reps per leg (alternating or walking lunges)
Glute Bridges: 3 sets of 15 reps
Step-Ups: 3 sets of 12 reps per leg, using a chair or step
Deadlifts: If you have access to weights, do 3 sets of 10-12 reps with light weight, focusing on form. Otherwise, bodyweight Good Mornings for 3 sets of 15 reps.
Cool Down: Stretch your legs and glutes for 5 minutes.
Breakfast (Approx. 700-800 Calories):
3 large eggs, scrambled with veggies
2 slices of whole-grain toast with 2 tablespoons of peanut butter
1 banana
Glass of whole milk or a protein shake
Makeup:
Take 15-20 minutes to apply your daily makeup. Focus on skincare first, then foundation, concealer, blush, mascara, and lip color for a natural look.

Mid-Morning Snack (Approx. 300-400 Calories):
Greek yogurt with honey and a handful of nuts or granola

Lunch (Approx. 800-900 Calories):
Grilled chicken breast (6 oz) with quinoa or brown rice (1 cup)
A large salad with mixed greens, avocado, cherry tomatoes, and a high-calorie dressing like olive oil and vinegar
One piece of fruit like an apple or pear

Afternoon Snack (Approx. 300-400 Calories):
Smoothie with protein powder, one banana, a handful of spinach, and almond milk; or a peanut butter and banana sandwich on whole-grain bread

Evening Routine:
Dinner (Approx. 800-900 Calories):
Baked salmon or another fatty fish (6 oz) with sweet potatoes (1 medium) and steamed broccoli
Add olive oil or butter for extra calories if needed
Post-Dinner Snack (Approx. 200-300 Calories):
A small serving of ice cream or a couple of protein bars

Additional Tips:
Consistency: Stick to this routine daily, adjusting portion sizes or food choices based on your appetite and how you feel.
Nutrition Balance: Ensure you're getting a mix of proteins, carbs, and healthy fats. The high-calorie count is aimed at weight gain or maintenance in very active individuals.
Protein Intake: Aim for 1.6-2.2 grams of protein per kg of body weight for muscle growth, which is included in this plan.
Hydration: Drink water throughout the day, but remember to have most of it between meals to ensure you can eat enough food to meet your caloric needs.
Sleep: Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep for recovery and muscle growth.
Progressive Overload: Gradually increase the intensity of your workouts by adding weight, increasing reps, or doing more challenging variations of the exercises.

Notes:
Makeup: Adjust your makeup routine based on your daily activities or personal style, but keep it consistent for simplicity.
Caloric Intake: The 3,000 calories are spread out to prevent overeating in one sitting. Adjust based on how your body responds or if you're not gaining as desired.
Exercise: If you feel your body isn't recovering well, consider adding a rest day for your legs or doing lighter activities like walking.

Remember, this routine is a suggestion; you might need to tweak it based on your lifestyle, preferences, and how your body reacts. If you're aiming for muscle growth rather than just weight gain, pairing this with a good resistance training program is key.

Diet: This is a high-calorie plan, so if you find you're gaining more weight than desired, adjust by reducing portion sizes or switching to lower-calorie alternatives within the same food groups.
Exercise: Ensure form is prioritized over the number of reps to prevent injury, especially with weights.

This detailed routine should be customized based on your body's response, your actual caloric needs, and any dietary restrictions or preferences. Remember, consistency is key for both diet and exercise to see results.

Now make it budget friendly
Answer
Here's a budget-friendly version of the daily routine, focusing on affordable options for makeup, food, and exercises that don't require expensive equipment:

Morning Routine:
Wake Up and Hydrate:
Drink tap water or from a reusable bottle.
Morning Skincare (5-10 minutes):
Use a basic, affordable cleanser (e.g., Cetaphil or generic brand).
Apply a drugstore moisturizer with SPF (e.g., Neutrogena or Equate brand).
Exercise for Glutes and Legs (30-45 Minutes):
Warm-Up (5 minutes):
Light stretching or bodyweight movements like arm circles, leg swings.
Workout:
Squats: 4 sets of 15 reps using just body weight.
Lunges: 3 sets of 12 reps per leg, no weights needed.
Glute Bridges: 4 sets of 20 reps, focus on squeezing at the top.
Step-Ups: Use a low chair or step; 3 sets of 15 reps per leg.
Single-Leg Deadlifts: 3 sets of 10 reps per leg for balance and glute focus.
Calf Raises: 3 sets of 20 reps on the edge of a step or flat ground.
Cool Down (5 minutes):
Simple stretches like hamstring stretch, quad stretch, and glute stretch.
Makeup Application (10-15 minutes):
Base: Use an affordable BB cream or tinted moisturizer for light coverage.
Eyes: Mascara from a drugstore brand (e.g., Maybelline or L'Oréal); skip eyeliner if budget-conscious.
Cheeks: Drugstore blush or use a lip balm for color in a pinch.
Lips: Chapstick or a budget-friendly lipstick or gloss.
Set: A small amount of translucent powder or skip if not necessary.
Breakfast (Approx. 500-600 Calories):
2 eggs, scrambled or boiled, with salt and pepper
1 slice of toast (look for deals on bread or buy generic) with generic peanut butter
An apple or banana (buy in bulk when on sale)

Mid-Morning Snack (Approx. 200-300 Calories):
A handful of mixed nuts (buy in bulk) or a small serving of yogurt with honey.

Lunch (Approx. 600-700 Calories):
Leftover chicken or canned tuna mixed with mayo or mustard, in a sandwich or with veggies.
A cup of rice or pasta (make in bulk to save money) with a bit of oil or butter for calories.
Carrots or celery sticks; buy whole and cut at home.

Afternoon Snack (Approx. 200-300 Calories):
Peanut butter on whole wheat crackers or bread slices.
Or an orange and a small serving of cheese (look for deals on cheese blocks).

Evening Routine:
Dinner (Approx. 600-700 Calories):
Ground beef or lentils (more budget-friendly) with spices for flavor, served over rice or with potatoes.
Frozen or seasonal vegetables (buy when on sale), steamed or sautéed with a bit of oil.
Use leftovers or bulk cooking to reduce costs.
Post-Dinner Snack (Approx. 200-250 Calories):
Popcorn (air-popped with a bit of salt) or a homemade protein mug cake (using basic ingredients like egg, flour, milk).

Additional Tips:
Shopping: Shop at discount stores, look for sales, buy in bulk when items like rice, pasta, or nuts are cheaper, and focus on seasonal produce.
Protein: Eggs, legumes, and canned fish are cost-effective protein sources. Consider buying larger packs of meat and freezing portions.
Hydration: Water is free; invest in a filter if tap water isn't palatable.
Exercise: Use body weight, or if weights are desired, look for second-hand dumbbells or use filled water bottles for added resistance.
Makeup: Rotate makeup products to extend their use, and consider multi-use products (e.g., a blush that can be used on lips).
Sleep: Free, but ensure your sleeping environment is conducive to rest; use free online resources for sleep hygiene tips.

Notes:
This routine focuses on maximizing nutrition and exercise benefits while keeping costs low. Adjust based on local prices and availability.
Remember, the key to staying on budget is planning your meals and shopping accordingly. 
For makeup, less is often more when you're budget-conscious; focus on products that serve multiple purposes.

Well, after realizing that meeting people at the grocery store while bantering over the ripeness of avocados wasn't working out, I decided to give the internet a try, haha.

So, here I am—hoping to click with someone who enjoys a good laugh, can appreciate a decent pun, and doesn't mind debating the merits of pineapple on pizza (it totally belongs!).

**Here's a bit about me:**

* I'm 34, male, single, and from the Northeast US.
* I work in higher ed, which means I can casually throw around terms like ""pedagogy"" and get paid to make students think I know everything (don’t tell them I don’t!).
* Hiking is my jam. I'm basically a mountain goat in human form (not really), except I come with snacks and a questionable sense of direction. If you're into epic trails and occasional ""oops, wrong way"" moments, we're a match.
* Journaling is my form of therapy. My notebooks are filled with deep thoughts, random doodles, and the occasional grocery list. I like to think of it as a sophisticated form of multitasking (or maybe an old-fashioned way of multitasking—who knows?).
* I love taking drives. There's nothing like the thrill of the open road, especially when my GPS decides to spice things up with surprise scenic routes through the middle of nowhere.
* I savor the little things in life, like a perfectly brewed cup of coffee, a well-timed joke, or finding a parking spot right in front of the store. It’s the small victories that count, right?
* I like to think that I'm as down to earth as they come. Literally, I’ve tripped on flat surfaces more times than I’d care to admit. But hey, at least I'm grounded, right?
* I firmly believe tacos are the answer to all of life’s problems. If you think Taco Tuesday should be a daily event, we’ll get along just fine. (Well... not exactly daily, but you get the point).

**What's important to me:**

* ***Someone who has a sense of curiosity about life:*** I'm looking for someone who truly sees the world as a playground of possibilities. If you’re the kind of person who loves learning new things, exploring different perspectives, and embracing the adventure of life, we’re definitely on the same wavelength. I want someone who’s always up for a new experience or discovering something interesting.
* ***Someone who loves day trips:*** I love spontaneous day trips, whether it’s a hike, a visit to a quirky town, or just a scenic drive. I’m hoping to find someone who shares that same enthusiasm for exploring and making the most of every weekend. There’s something special about discovering new places and making memories together, and I’m excited to find a partner who values those adventures as much as I do.
* ***Someone who values authentic conversations and growth:*** Genuine, meaningful conversations are the backbone of any strong relationship. I’m looking for someone who’s open, honest, and values deep discussions about life, dreams, and everything in between. I believe lifelong growth means constantly evolving and supporting each other’s journeys, and I’d like to find someone who shares that belief.
* ***Someone who sees the purpose of self-reflection:***  I’m drawn to those who regularly take the time to look inward and understand themselves better—striving to be the best version of yourself and appreciating the journey of self-discovery.

**And that's a wrap!**

If you’ve made it this far, congratulations! You now know more about me than most people do after a first date. If you think we’d get along like peanut butter and jelly (or pineapple and pizza if you’re on the right side of history), drop me a message.

To get the conversation started, here are a couple of fun openers:

* If we went hiking together, would you be the snack master or the trail guide?
* Coffee: are you a one-cup wonder or do you need a caffeine IV drip?

Hope this post made you laugh, haha. I look forward to hopefully connecting with someone who loves life, laughter, and a good road trip as much as I do!",1,1736992848.0,u_Dr_Roma,0,1.0,False

I always longed for being able to be free to do what I want and not having a lingering anxiety of what Monday might bring. 

On the other hand, the stress of not knowing what is to come is preventing me from fully enjoying the present. I have savings but I’m not confident enough to spend it on anything meaningful like a trip or even a coffee for fear I might never find another job. 

With summer coming round the corner I dread the prospect of being home and not travelling and exploring the world as was custom for me. 

The fear of wasting my time and money has resulted in me rotting in bed everyday and I feel a bit alone currently. So far the only thing thats kept me going is a consistent workout routine since I can see direct results from that.

There were no intros to the family on the first date. I didn’t blurt out all the reasons I’d make a ‘good husband’, pull a ring box outta my pocket, all whilst calling her the wrong name. She’d think I was a right creep.

I’d have run a mile if she did the same to me.

But, I see it every day…

When folks are reaching out to potential clients. They are skipping all the flirting and ‘getting to know you’ part. And are going straight in with a marriage proposal. It’s just as much of a red flag and a turn off to these business owners…

…as it is to our dates.

Then peeps wonder why clients keep saying NO…

Wonder why they get ‘ghosted’ and why they keep facing all that rejection. In my experience, the ONLY thing we should be trying to achieve with our initial outreach…

Is to get a coffee date. No talking about the ins and outs of the deal. No selling. No convincing.

If it was me, this is how I’d do it:

Dude, that landscaping job you did at the house on George Street was incredible, I can't believe the size of their pool, you must have wanted to dive in!”

I was wondering if you have any old leads I can turn into ""George Street"" type jobs for you using ChatGPT on a backend deal?

You see how PERSONAL but casual that is? You see how that strikes up a conversation, rather than blindsiding them with a pitch? Once we’ve set up a coffee date in a non-needy way…

Then we can do a bit of flirting! (We don’t overdo it. It has to be natural)

For us and our [DBR offer](https://honeysyed.com/aiagency), this consists of EXPERIENCE. EXPERIENCE. EXPERIENCE.

We show them how the bot works. Let them experience how it talks to prospects. Let them imagine how it would work their leads. That way, we don’t need to sell. We don’t need to convince.

They tend to fall over themselves to get us locked in for a 2nd date…

… a TEST on their database.

And they know before we can do that…

We have to talk about the nuts and bolts of the deal. At which point a proposal is welcomed.",1,1736992446.0,ContentMarketing,0,1.0,False
1i2dyhg,https://www.reddit.com/r/economicCollapse/comments/1i2dyhg/big_tech_will_kill_our_democracy/,Big Tech will kill our democracy,"The problem is that social-media platforms’ business model undermines the social foundation of democratic participation.

That is, social-media platforms purposely seek to undo local communities to maximize profits. The reason is that social-media companies profit from our digital relationships, but not from our “physical” relationships, those that take place in parks, coffee shops, book clubs, and the like. As a result, social media platforms see the physical relationships between people as competing with the digital relations they offer.

  
But these physical relations are the foundation of our communal life. Without local communities, democratic engagement drops. This decrease in engagement will leave democratic institutions at the mercy of vested interests, undermining their performance. The declining effectiveness of the democratic process will sway many young voters to dismiss democracy as non-essential. In a way, profit-maximizing social media are succeeding where the totalitarian ideologies of the 20^(th) century failed: redesigning society and its physical networks to achieve their profit maximizing goals and, in so doing, killing democracy.

  
Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos to Elon Musk are generating billions of dollars in revenue for their companies each year. The fact is that those people, worth hundreds of billions of dollars, also at the same time have literally no interest or conception in their role as stewards for civil society and American democracy. Big Tech has pumped **more than $51 million** into lobbying thus far in 2024, **nearly 14% more than the amount** the same organizations collectively spent on lobbying during the same time period in 2023.

  
Social media giants Meta (the parent company of Facebook and Instagram) and ByteDance (the parent company of TikTok) have combined to spend **about $225,000 on lobbying per day Congress has been in session** **in 2024**. The two companies’ influence operations collectively  include **more than 100 lobbyists, or one lobbyist for every five members of Congress**.

**Meta alone spent a record $18.9 million on lobbying during the first nine months of 2024 — a 29% increase** from what it spent on lobbying during the same period in 2023, and the most the company has spent between January and September in any year since it first started federal lobbying in 2009. This includes more than $5 million in the third quarter alone. **Meta’s lobbying efforts in 2024 have been powered by 66 lobbyists — one for every eight members of Congress.** 

All of America's lionizing of free markets and capitalism has also led to a vastly more dysfunctional democratic process, because these companies are inadvertently, but nonetheless, aligning with business models that destroy democracy.

Facebook, Google and Amazon have destroyed the actual bulwark against autocratic leaders – local journalism – while cozying up to actual autocracy. They now control the digital ad industry. According to one recent research report, if they paid news organizations what they make off them by standing as a middleman between readers and writers, they would [be handing over between $12bn and $14bn](https://www.niemanlab.org/2023/12/publishers-keep-trying-to-extract-revenue-from-google/) a year. The very journalists and news organizations we rely on for fact-finding and fact-checking are scared of being shadowbanned – Jeff Bezos’s fear of Trump being exhibit A of how that can impact editorial content.

Joining hands with big tech oligarchs is joining hands with the destruction of the Democratic party and democracy.

I was recently advised (on r/pourover) that random/fast pours on my V60 are not good.  Since confirmed by me.  I have since tried doing VERY gentle and slow pours; really just one long/slow pour after the bloom pour and the results are much better than I have ever achieved with my ceramic V60.  Big improvement.  So I bought a Hario Drip-Assist thinking I would get the same results with less effort.  Results have not been that great.  First, the coffee is not as good as my long/slow pour.  But also, since I am pouring much more water and faster using the Drip-Assist, it leaves grounds high up on the walls of the V60 Dripper that I would not have using my long/slow pour.  Am I just using the drip-assist incorrectly, or is my long/slow pour just superior?  I will say that the grounds bed was flatter with the drip-assist than with my long/slow pour.

We have a really good time together and he’s been very very good to me. One issue that has been bothering me is he is quite jealous and insecure and it causes him to ask who I am texting or to see my phone. I am protective of my phone because everything is on there, it’s like my diary. I am not hiding anything and am loyal, but I just don’t like the idea of someone going through my phone. He spirals a lot when I say no you can’t see my phone. He has a slight drinking problem and acts out a bit more when drunk. We went out one night and a guy was flirting and being a fuckwit outside the pub, so my ex, E, has told him to stand up and fight. When the guy laughed and said it was a joke, E punched him in the mouth. He has gotten into a few fights ‘defending me’ 

Last night, we both got drunk and I went to bed leaving my phone in the lounge room. E comes bursting in furious as he has gone through my phone, somehow guessing the password, and had gone through everything. He found messages between me and a friend, D (25M), who I had bumped into at the gym that day. We had agreed to get coffee because he is moving like 3 hours away next week. He took this as cheating. I have just snapped and told him to go, and that we are done. I had told him in the past that going through my phone is a dealbreaker. 

After getting my phone back, I learned that E had called D off my phone. I don’t know what was said, but I am totally embarrassed and mortified by this behaviour. D is worried about seeing me after the call yesterday which leads me to believe E had threatened him. I asked E to get all his stuff and leave and I dropped him home. He is trying to fix things and part of me feels bad because he is amazing in every other aspect. I just can’t handle the cheating accusations. AIO? ",4,1736992257.0,AmIOverreacting,17,0.75,False

As long as I had basic toiletries, clean clothes, and a charged cell phone with a Wifi connection, I could give a shit about anything else. Vacationing, traveling? No thanks. Jewelry, wall decor, potted plants? Nah. Day-to-day treats like ice cream or expensive coffee? I’m good. Nothing had any sort of appeal, because… why bother? I was at the same baseline level of miserable no matter what.

But the past few days, I’ve gotten it in my head that I want things. I want a vinyl of “In the Aeroplane Over the Sea” to display on my wall (I don’t even have a record player!). I want an Apple pencil, and an iPad to go with. I want software to draw and animate and try things in a new medium. I want new sneakers. I want to start lifting again. I want, I want, I want.

Envy and avarice definitely aren’t great. But they feel so much better than resignation and hopelessness and apathy. Wanting feels good, even though I won’t get an iPad or an Apple pencil or cool new shoes. Even the vinyl is pretty unlikely. Weight training, though, I could almost see happening.

1i2dwgp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i2dwgp,Looking to sell furniture by the 26th,"Hello! I'm moving out of the country towards the end of this month and I literally have to get rid of everything in my apartment. I've been able to sell some stuff but other (bigger) stuff I'm having no luck. I've had a lot of interested people reach out to me, but they go silent when I reach back. I think it's the fact that I cannot deliver my furniture to them.


Which I guess is the caveat with trying to sell my furniture. I have no means of delivering furniture to people and someone would need to pick up at least two of the pieces of furniture from a fourth floor apartment building in downtown Stamford.


Anyway this is what I'm looking to sell


**1.** $25 IKEA Dresser (one of the drawers will not fully close due to faulty screw when building)

**2.**  $25 Dining Table and 4 Upholstered Chairs (must go together)

**3.** $20 Low Cross Legged Coffee Table

**4.**  $10 Double Door Chest



I can bring down the coffee table and chest on my own, but someone will need to have a way of bringing down the dresser and/or dining set. Also I would need to schedule a specific day for pickup so I can let the building Super know I'm moving big furniture.

Sorry for my crappy formatting. I hope everything makes sense! Please let me know it DM me if you're interested!

Whether through famine, hysteria or war, you could never really escape the fear of where the world was heading. Some would say it started in 2016, but most knew it had been building up for ages, some new disaster making the headlines every month. The current situation was the logical endpoint, a 2020 panicked by a global outbreak that wasn't even quelled by promise for a vaccine. As such, some pretty important events had to be shut down.



And that was where Alexandra Couls was now, in her apartment on October 31st, 2020. Normally she'd be enthusiastic to give out treats and candy to the younger Halloween loving tykes roaming the halls. But Halloween, at least in Alex's neighbourhood, had been called off for most thanks to the Pandemic. The years since high school had greatly dampened her idealism. Alexandra was a short, average-looking college student still struggling with student debt and mind-numbing assignments. Her circle of friends, especially Julia Brien, were dealing with life in their own ways. Julia was taller, more headstrong, and spoke her mind more. She practically doted on Alex to take the big risks most would back down from.



Alex's train of thought was interrupted as her cell rang. It was no surprise who it was. ""Hey, girlfriend,"" Julia always wanted to sound sly.



""Happy Halloween, Julia. Sounds like you've got something to tell me again.""



Julia chuckled. ""Wouldn't call you if I didn't, Alex. And believe it or not, even I was nervous about this at first.""



That was a worrying sign. Julia had a habit of getting into the weirdest crowds, but it was saying something if something unsettled her. Then again, Julia usually had something big to say when she called.



""Okay, Spill.""



""You remember Cale from social studies?""



Cale was the resident oddball of Alex's college. He was a stringy and excitable man who'd usually announce his presence with a laugh or a yodel. There was word around campus he was a drug dealer, or at the least on something himself.



""Cale? The loner?""



""Yeah, the man, the myth. He's having a Halloween party tonight at 10:00, I bet it'll be interesting.""



Alex snorted. ""Just when I thought you had standards. You sure you want to spend Halloween getting high in the house of some guy you barely know? Besides, this couldn't be a worse year.""



""Look, we're both vaccinated, aren't we? Besides, there'll probably be loads of masks at a damn Halloween party. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity and you're gonna just blow it off out of fear?""



There it was. Alex knew how timid she could be compared to Julia, and it was a sore spot, especially with bigger social opportunities. Alex hated having that reputation and her friend knew it.



""Okay. You can come get me at 9:30 in the parking lot. If we get roofied though, I'll never forgive you.""



Julia gave a nervous giggle. ""Jeez, someone's in the Halloween spirit.""



As the time drew near, Alexandra slipped into her costume, a part rubber, part felt Gargoyle suit with two plastic wings and a grinning papier mâché mask. She'd gotten the idea from the stories she'd heard about the stone beasts in that folklore course she took in February. It felt odd walking down the empty halls in the guise of a monster, while most were locked away in their own abodes. It made her feel just a bit more isolated.



In front of the building was a red hybrid driven by the Bride of Frankenstein. Julia looked like she'd stepped out of the silver screen.



""Wow, Impressive costume!""



""Gotta go with the classics. But what are you supposed to be?""



""I'm a Gargoyle, or as the French would say, ""a grotesque"".



They chattered like that most of the way to the party, and soon Alex was feeling less tense. Before long they were pulling in front of a small apartment flat, several partygoers already waiting around the lawn. It was kind of hard to believe Cale would have such a large friend circle.



Inside, the party was a mass of masked figures, anime characters, and fur suits, crowded inside Cale's living room. Chatting and laughing about college life, current events and general goofiness. To Alex it felt like stepping into a cross between Comic Con, a fur convention, and a 15th century masquerade ball. The guests continued mingling for a bit before a microphone thumped and then a voice called for attention.



All eyes turned to a miniature microphone stand near the large TV, where stood a figure clad in a red robe with a grinning skull-like mask. The Masque Of The Red Death. He removed the mask and there was Cale, hair scraggly, eyes wild and somewhat sunken.



""I'm touched y'all gave me a chance."" He bleated his announcements, his voice as usual nervous and high pitched. ""Granted I think some of you just came cuz you badly needed a place to get high.""



A chuckle resonates through the room. Cale intoned, ""well, you may think I'm just the local weed boy. But what I'm gonna show you tonight will change your world.""



Beside her friend, Julia whispered, ""Wonder what crazy shit he's gonna pull now,"" and Alex snorted. Cale didn't seem to notice, and he knew he often got that reaction anyway.



Then he reached into his robe pocket and drew out a small plastic bag of what seemed to be pink powder. ""The stuff I have,"" he went on, ""is a rare, highly hallucinogenic substance I picked up in China. They call it the Demon's Sweat.""



Of course, should've known this would be the draw of the party. ""And I'm offering a little challenge. Anyone here who takes this with me will be the first to take this stuff outside China.""



An awkward murmuring ran through the guests. Was he nuts? Who'd be stupid enough to try? Under normal circumstance, Alex would tell him to fuck off. She'd barely talked to Cale before, and what he was saying reminded her why. Then she saw Julia raise her hand, along with several others.



""What are you doing?"" Alex hissed.



""Remember what I said about taking risks?"" Julia whispered back, ""This is what I mean. A once in a lifetime experience, Allie. I don't know about you, but I want a story to tell my cousins.""



Alex saw other hands go up, as if being invited to an exclusive social club. ""I promise, the stuff is safe,"" Cale rambled. ""I've taken some myself, and it feels pretty nice.""



Before Alex realized, her hand joined the throng. Her curiosity had overrode her fear. Whatever this was, she just had to see for herself. Cale motioned down a hall left of his living room. Alex, Julia, and several other party goers followed him to an empty room with four bean bag chairs and posters of surreal artwork from the 70s/80s. In the middle of the room was a table with at least seven bags of the pink powder. A drug den? There was also a tea kettle and a few small cups on the left side. Cale sat cross legged, motioning the others to follow.



""You can each take the Demon's Sweat however you like, smoke it, sprinkle in your drink and such. But be careful, only in small doses."" In the dim lighting, Cale's eyes seemed almost flaming.



Alex and Julia watched as the others began to take packets from the table, start wrapping the stuff into cigarettes. Julia shifted nervously, than took a bag, Alex following suit. Quietly, each poured herself a tea cup and sprinkled in a pinch of the powder.



""You still okay with this?"" Alex asked. Julia glanced at the relaxing, certainly stoned guests.



""They seem okay. Happy Halloween!"" She raised her cup and took a sip of tea. Alex watched as her friend exhaled happily, and lifted her tea to her lips.



The drink was warm and sweet, no different taste than the tea her Aunt Greta would make. Then as she sat there, Alex felt the world changing. The idle chatter of the partygoers dipped into... not gibberish, but some language not of human tongue. As they laughed and fell into the cushions, their tongues became slimy, barbed things. Their eyes glowed with unearthly colors, their bodies contorting. The shadows danced around the room, forming monstrous shapes in turn. Some had several long legs, or anteater snouts or glider-like wings.



And yet... Alex didn't react, couldn't even think. She wasn't herself. The thing that lived in her gibbered greetings to its kind, the guests gibbering back. This was the last Alex saw before she fell unconscious.



It was a bleary light she awoke to. As her eyes adjusted, Alex realized she was in bed at home. The clock on the nightstand read 4:31 AM. Goddamn, she'd kill Julia for this. Some Halloween, letting the local nutbag feed you weird shit he bought across the globe. She was too dazed to wonder who brought her back. She brushed her hair aside and headed to the bathroom for a shower. Needed to get a headstart to campus.



After a good warm soaking, she stepped out, wrapped a towel around herself-and froze. Something was written on the mirror. Hello my host.



Alex suddenly felt sick, like something had kicked her gut. She wasn't alone. Struggling to remain calm and scrabbling to find a weapon, her mind raced. How could she get out with some creep prowling in her apartment?



Just then, a voice–no, a thought called to her. Calm down, Alex. Nobody broke in. In spite of herself, the girl felt a bit calmer.



But wait, that didn't feel like her mind. It was like someone used her head as a speaker.



I'm afraid that's right, Hun. Don't want you thinking you're crazy. This time she knew that wasn't her. What was happening? Was she losing her mind?



Almost immediately the voice spoke. Please don't think that. I'm real and I can prove it. And as it did, those same words appeared on the foggy mirror as if scrawled by an invisible hand.



Shaking, Alex found her voice: ""What are you? Why are you in my head?""



Tell me, the entity replied, do you remember last night? I chose you as host. As my brethren do every few decades.



Feeling a little emboldened, Alex strode out of the bathroom to get dressed, still talking to the unseen being. ""What the hell do you mean, is this that drug?""



The voice reverberated in her head, I guess you could say that. The dust you ingested links our essence to the physical world. Every so often, at a most chaotic time, we bond with humans to anchor ourselves. What better time than a night of spirits and magic dating all the way back to the Celts?



Alex was still taking all this in. ""So if you're real... can't you show me what you look like?""



There was a reverberating sort of noise like laughter. Oh I can't do that yet, might destroy your mind. But I can do other things.



With that there was a strange feeling in the air, like it was getting warmer. Then as she watched, a red, green, orange mist began to form in the room, shaping and coalescing until it became a cloud, the same shape and height of her own figure.



Making sense yet?



"" I guess."" Alex didn't actually know how to react to this.



The cloud-double made the impression of a smile, speaking in tune with the words of the alien voice. I have no name yet, unless you choose. But I still have things to show you.



The apparition strode to the door leading to Alex's balcony and through some impossible force, opened it. Alex walked into the morning air... and nearly fainted. The world outside was normal, but she could see things that were never there. Serpentine shapes sailed the skies. Colourful, powerfully-built humanoids leapt from roof to roof. Massive creatures out of an alien sea strolled through the streets unnoticed. It was like overnight the city had become a melting pot of beings from other dimensions.



It has always looked like this, the cloud being explained, just not to humans like you. Our kind has walked the earth on a different plain. We can only manifest in certain times like last night. Still skeptical? Perhaps you should call your friend.



Alex suddenly remembered Julia, surely, she wasn't going through this too? Nervously, Alex took her phone from the nightstand and brought up her friend's number. The voice was Julia's, but not how Alex normally heard.



""H-Hello?""



""It's me...Alex. You, okay?""



""Oh god, Ally, I think I'm going nuts. This thing is talking to me, I'm seeing monsters outside. It was that fucker Cale and his powder-""



Alex tuned out briefly before piping up. ""Okay, calm down. I'm seeing this too. Just stay there and we'll sort this out.""



Julia hastily but reluctantly agreed, and Alex was once again alone except for the presence in her mind. So what shall my name be?



With a sigh, Alex vindicated the unwelcome being. ""How about...Trips? That's what I thought you were at first,""



The cloud-being shifted and warped with joyful laughter. We'll be good friends. But I must warn you of something else.



""Oh god, what?"" Alex groaned.



Once we bond with a host, we must consume the energy of another demon to complete the fusion. If not before the end of November, demon and host will burn out and die.



""What the fuck. Okay, now that you've told me how I'll die, what am I supposed to do?""



Don't worry, Cale will call us to help when that time comes. For now, I really want to see this world with you by my side.



Alex had lost the ability to feel surprised anymore, all in one morning. Stepping into the world of monsters and walking nightmares, she constantly told herself to keep focused, even if it was hard to ignore the things that rode the subway or flew over the roofs. It was easy to forget the current pandemic when there were giant monsters having tea over apartment roofs, or little lizard-monkeys riding people's heads.



And yet, only Alex was aware of such wonders, and she knew it was thanks to that damned dust she'd consumed on Halloween. Trips, meanwhile, would often be chatting away to its fellow creatures in that strange way.



The three days seemed to slip by. Alex and Julia didn't have much time to talk, but Alex did meet her own monster: a blue humanoid cloud shaped like its host, just as with her own entity. Trips seemed to get on fine with it and the two girls watched the creatures chatter to each other from their seats by the coffee shop window.



Julia was getting a bit more despondent. ""I called up some of the others and this is happening to them too."" She sighed bitterly. ""Cale...that piece of shit....I'm sorry I dragged you into this.""



Alex smiled. ""Don't be. This would be cool... if it weren't for the impending doom.""



""What?"" Julia whispered harshly.



Alex suddenly realized what her girlfriend didn't know. Julia whipped around to look at the two creatures.



""WHAT?!"" She bellowed loud enough to alert the entire shop, human or otherwise. The blue being seemed to flinch, and tried to explain the situation in a way that only her host understood. ""ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME!?"" Evidently, she no longer cared about the public space.



As eyes turned to Julia, she stormed to the doors. Alex along with Trips followed outside. ""Jules, calm down""



""How are you so calm? Do you even care what'll happen to us!?"" The girl was trying to lower her voice but it wasn't easy given the circumstances. Alex had felt the same way.



""I do,"" she said sadly, ""but at the same time, I was relieved in a way.""



Julia's face was quiet amazement. ""Life was starting to feel aimless, uncertain and dull. But then we get shown this whole new world of things we thought couldn't exist. Even if it's scary, existentially terrifying, it's still a purpose.""



Julia flatly replied, ""What kind of world are you seeing? Because all I see are dumb animals idly going about while the bigger beasts gobble them up. That's you and me, Ally."" Her eyes were cold. ""If I'm gonna be stuck with this thing, I'm not going to be served up like a stuffed pig. Are you?"" For the first time, Julia was serious about something. Alex couldn't remember the last time since middle school.



Soon Friday came, as did the phone calls. It was Cale, summoning them to his house of horror, where it had all began. Just as Trips had said.



That night as Alex pulled up to the ominous house, she heard Trips' advice. You realize we are about to face a turning point. Be strong, Alex, and we will come out of this stronger. Alex wasn't sure she could be optimistic about that.



Several gargoyle-like phantoms watched from their rooftop perches as the guests packed into Cale's house. The young man was waiting for them, his eccentric stoner persona given way to that of a mad sorcerer. It was clear he was one with a demon himself.



""As you all know,"" he announced, ""The Demon's Sweat changed your lives. Some of you may hate me, but I only served a greater calling, as you all do now. You have unthinkable power, and tonight you will learn to control it.""



Indeed, nobody seemed to want to be here. The strange substance that this... maniac had fed them leashed these invisible beasts to their souls, and this bizarre ritual was the only way to control the power.



Cale motioned to the basement door and announced, ""The Duel of Souls will commence down here."" There were some nervous chuckles. In any normal situation, these RPG titles would be funny.



The small crowd of humans and entities trailed downstairs to a wide den. Cale announced, ""One pair each will take part in this ritual. The winner has the strongest spirit and walks away with newfound energy. The loser... .I appreciate your efforts.""



Nobody liked the sound of that, but they had no choice if they were to ease this curse.



Two boys stepped forth. A medium one and a big burly guy. The smaller boy grinned in anticipation at his opponent, who glowered. And with a word from Cale, the full horror of the night unfolded.



The two stood opposite each other before doubling over and screaming, their bodies changing. The small one's forehead erupted into two hornlike protrusions, his tiny frame bursting with muscle, fur sprouting from his shoulders, hands merging into three fingered appendages. The big guy's skin rapidly grew coral like lesions, his hands large bony claws, his teeth elongated, and his face twisted into a saurian snout. Their own demons had taken form through the host. Where two young men stood were two hulking abominations, a shimmering orange golem of coral and a powerfully built horned ape, a Minotaur.



Some of the onlookers screamed in shock, but no one made a move, because they knew leaving wasn't an option. The beasts howled and lunged at each other, the coral-man's hands forming into shapes that engulfed his foe's fist. The Bull was strong and sturdy but even he couldn't match the shifting mass that grew and clung to his arms, even as he crushed it like chalk.



The Coral-Beast was forming himself around his foe, engulfing him in a mass of expanding alien mineral. The Minotaur roared and thrashed, smashing with his titanic arms and horns, but the living substance kept forming, closing in like sediment around fossilized bones. Then the Coral-Beast opened his grinning maw, engulfing his prey's head to smother the defiant shrieks.



Then it was his turn to scream. The orange mass around the Bull-Ape's head sizzled and crumbled away. A steaming green liquid frothed from the Ape's jaws and ate away at those of his crystallized enemy. The ape continued to spew the foul acid as the alien rock eroded and emitted a horrible, vibrating scream. Whatever it was, it felt pain like any animal. The Bull triumphantly broke free of the coral tomb and smashed his beefy fists against the shattered form of his foe, again, again, and howled in triumph as the being lay in rubble around him. In seconds, his form shrunk, reverted to the timid young man who'd first entered the fight. The coral fragments evaporated.



This was the basis of each fight. Everyone here had to consume another's essence to control their new powers. The only rule was nobody could leave the psychic circle where the fight took place. And it went on like that the rest of the night. Bodies twisted and morphed into things never seen on Earth. A crawling faceless thing with Jellyfish tendrils whipped electric shocks at a monstrous reptile with a large shell. A hulking green scaled abomination locked arms with a four armed red brute. Each match ended in one crumbling to ash and the other renewed yet weary from victory.



Alex saw Julia become her demon for the first time, a spindly blue insectoid with fierce jaws. Its armored limbs locked with a bat winged creature. The two rose into the air before Julia's proboscis shot through the bat's eye and sent them tumbling back down. Within seconds the clawing, screeching beast fell limp as the thing that was Julia sucked its fluids through a socket.



As the beast crumbled, the blue beetle shrunk and became Julia again. She seemed shocked, but exhilarated.



""That felt...good. I know it's wrong, but I've never felt anything like it...God, what the fuck am I?""



Trips' voice rang in: It's our turn, Ally.



""I know."" Alex said it numbly, bluntly. Not like she had a choice. Nothing would ever surprise her again after tonight, if she lived past it.



Her opponent stepped in. A girl about her age, with dark eyes and a rugged grimace. Alex wondered if she'd had her own issues before that night. ""Uh...good luck?,"" Cringeworthy.



The other gave a grim smirk. ""I really should say that to you.""



Don't be intimidated. She is as nervous as you. Alex wasn't sure she found Trips' words helpful. They were the last match of the night. Most of the other combatants had left to take in their new lives. Only Julia and four others stayed to watch the grim initiation.



The two girls faced each other as before. The oddly assuring voice of Trips piped up. Don't worry. I'll take over from here. Just relax. Think of it like the dentist. Worst analogy ever.



Alex's foe was named Talia. As Trips gleaned, she'd been drawn here by desperation for a purpose, something greater from life, and she'd thrilled at the chance to transcend.



Finally it began. Talia's body expanded, her arms splitting into four. Her face contorted and split into two, each shrieking with painfully forced jaws. Legs became spiny and rigid like a mantis. Skin turned gray and rough like tree bark. And each hand was now formed into an organic weapon.



But Alex wasn't there. Trips was there, their body forming into Alex's. Her mouth became a sharp beak. Her hands grew into powerful paws as huge jagged wings extended outward. And a sort of lichen formed on the being's face and torso. The new beast rose to fight. Alex had once been a gargoyle in costume, but Trips was the thing that inspired such statues.



The Talia-beast slashed and hacked at Trips, its blades failing to pierce Trips' now stone-like body. Trips shot back with powerful armored punches. A flurry of snarling, biting, clawing, centered in that room, each locked in a battle of mental fortitude to consume the other.



Talia-Beast sprayed something from its mouths, a blinding gas that sizzled on Trips' stone flesh. As it howled, Talia-Beast took the upper hand, pouncing like a tiger to an elk. Four claws dug into stone flesh, ripping into the fallen gargoyle's hide.



But Trips wasn't out. Small tendrils shot from the holes in its armor, latching to its assailant. And in that moment, Alex became aware of her mind flowing to meet Talia's. In a space cut off from the physical world, two girls became linked by soul.



As Alex ""stared"" upon Talia's visage, she truly understood who she faced. Talia was trapped by addiction, rarely came home, hated the family who didn't understand or respect her. This was a way out, a new beginning. The two gazed silently, sadly, as Talia's very being became one with Alexandra's. To the outside world it was a horrific predation, but within Talia's troubled soul became tranquil and calm for the first time in years, becoming one with Alexandra.



Talia and her demon were one with Trips and Alex now. How do you feel?



""Fine.""



It was odd how casual she said it, but Trips was satisfied. Soon reality came back into view, as the monster morphed back to a young woman. Talia was gone, but Alex knew she was part of her now. Two had become one, a new being ready to face a daunting future.



Cale was smiling. ""Welcome to a new world, our disciple.""



A few days passed since that night. There were still missing posters plastered on bulletin boards and telephone poles for the losers of those matches. It would have alarmed most, but Alexandra and Julia knew the truth.



In fact, each of the missing were one with their ""killers"". Humans and demons alike are reborn through the absorption process, creating stronger, better entities. Alex was now four in one vessel, as were all the remaining guests.



As she looked out from her rooftop perch at the world only visible to her kind, Trips said, You know this doesn't change much. We'll have to go about our life for now.



Alex smiled to herself. ""I know. But Julia's taking it well. And I can do all the things Talia wanted to but couldn't."" It was Talia speaking, two minds merged into a new being.



Well, Trips said, I'd enjoy it while you can. Soon there'll be another ceremony, more humans will join your numbers.



""Evolution can be a scary thing. But people are never prepared for change. It's always been like that, even with the most beneficial.""



You sure handled it better than most humans, Trips said slyly. Maybe this time will be different.



""We should see for ourselves.""



And with that, the new being's wings unfolded and she flew to a changing world.

1i2dt9u,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1i2dt9u/things_i_left_at_the_old_house/,Things I Left at the Old House,"I had to leave things, beloved things, behind at the old house, and the loss of those things still feels paramount. Childish as it may be, it's as close as I can imagine it might feel to mourn my own death. After the fact, I mean. As in, to be sad that I have already died. 

These things I abandoned. I can't say I had to, but it certainly feels that way. Things I didn't know I'd be losing and things I'd meant to have with me still. Who gives a shit? They were only things; objects, unnecessary and frivolous. Simple distractions from the suffocating fact of our smallness in the universe. The lonesome slack in our hold on reality. These were things that had a history deeper than that they belonged to me. 

The bulky old coffee table I'd bought for two dollars at an estate sale. Square as a postage stamp but nowhere near as fitting for where it was meant to be, there was no good spot for it in our living room, which was small and slim; a modern art rectangle. The table was expansive and demanding, like the antique era it came from. It was in the way any way that you put it, but it was well made, unique, and like I said... it only cost me two god damn dollars. We'd needed a coffee table. Plus, it could hold several stacks of books, and still have more than enough room to support dinner. Two dollars! He'd hated it. I was proud of it. 

A mason jar full of infield dirt from Tiger Stadium. Encouraged and equipped by my Dad, I'd passed his empty beer cup to one of the grounds crew, who were much more accessible than usual now that the very last game ever at Tiger Stadium was over. Perhaps he'd also been swept up by the emotional swell of the night, or maybe he just realized that nothing mattered anymore, but he was gracious enough to oblige my request by scooping several heavy handfuls worth of soft, rusty brown infield dirt into the cup. 

And I wasn't the only one asking for dirt, ok? I was holding a bit of history; a sort of time machine. I was living in the very moment when that dirt came straight from the infield; I saw it leave the ground with my own eyes, and I could have that same dirt long after Tiger Stadium was torn down. Someday; today, for instance, the dirt will have come from a place that no longer exists. I put that dirt in a sparkling clean mason jar as soon as an eleven year old girl without any internet could be expected to get her hands on such a thing. And then I kept that jar of infield dirt from Tiger Stadium for over twenty years. Stupid? Yes. To me? No. I loved Tiger Stadium. I loved having that jar of infield dirt. What happened to it after I left it at the old house? Does someone have it now? I hope it wasn't treated like the trash it more than likely would've appeared to be. Though if it was to the someone who found it, who am I to argue? Just the rude ass who left it there for them. 

And the inevitable laundry. How many pairs of dirty underwear did I leave in the old house? And what sort of dirty were they? Who, if anyone, came across them, and were they appalled at the condition they were in? Did they wonder, what sort of fucking slob would leave shit like this? How much of a chore was it to get rid of all my left behind things? Was someone cursing me, ""fucking nasty bitch,"" as they filled up trash bags? I couldn't blame them if they did. It's shameful to leave so many things behind. A mess for someone else to clean up. Worse still that I don't even know who I left my mess for, just that they'll never know the context behind it and why I didn't have much choice. I do not like that I've inconvenienced a total stranger so severely and can never at least say I'm sorry. 

Every now and then I'll think of something that I own, realize I no longer have it, and it will dawn on me that I left it at the old house. Each time this happens is a new reason to ask myself old questions. It's hard not to dwell. Why didn't I just grab that, why didn't I take it with me? I had to get out fast. 

The last time I went back to the old house to grab more of my things, I found him hiding on the basement stairs. He freaked me the fuck out. I rushed myself to be quick about it. I scrambled. That was it; I was getting out of there, away from him, and I would not be going back. Not ever again. Whatever I'd taken was all I would have. He freaked me out so badly that I couldn't even think about which of my remaining things I should make sure I take with me. I'd lost all sense of my strategy, which had meant it was past time to go. 

My poor, forgotten, left behind inanimate objects. I will never know what happened to you. You will never know what happened to me. How had you left your previous life? 

Just how much, exactly, did I leave at the old house, and how much of it would embarrass me to claim as mine? What did my things tell a stranger about me? A jar of dirt and some dirty underwear? Great! 

Stupid, unimportant things; merely stuff. I myself am still alive, physically intact, and at least more emotionally intact than I was when I last saw these missing things of mine. But I can't help it; I do miss them. 

Even stuff that was eventually replaced is still gone. I found a vintage wingback armchair that looks a hell of a lot like the one I left at the old house. Both serve the same basic purpose. But even if they were identical, they could never be the same thing. I've never curled up cowered in the replacement chair with my head hidden between my knees while my favorite coffee mug smashes into large and teeny tiny pieces against the wall just to my left. I've never been on my hands and knees in front of this replacement chair, reaching under it to retrieve a stray ceramic shard a few days later, surprised that I had missed it when I'd cleaned up the broken coffee mug that had been my favorite. Disappointed at how much I knew I would miss drinking coffee out of that mug. Pissed off because I knew he'd picked that one to break on purpose, because I'd liked it. Impatient for the escape I was then still secretly plotting. 

The vintage wingback chair I left behind had been cheap, but it was one of a kind. It had been part of an entirely different life that I knew nothing about and could only imagine; make up for myself, before it came to be in mine; a life I hated to know so well but was also still imagining how it could be. 

They are all just things, these things I'm missing. And it's shallow to assign so much significance to them. A table is just a table. Dirt? Goes without saying. It's materialistic to care about and miss these things. Ungrateful not to focus on what really matters. I admit that I still don't know the full extent of everything I left at the old house. Maybe I avoid remembering. 

If I don't even know that I'm missing something, do I really need, or even want it? 

It is cause to ponder, although perhaps I shouldn't bother, and maybe someday I'll even figure some form of an answer; maybe there's more than just one to figure. But how is it that the things I have yet to realize I'm missing, are the things I miss the most? ",2,1736991913.0,stories,0,1.0,False

Myself (27F) and my husband, Adam (28M), were invited on a weekend baby moon to celebrate our friends Pete (28M) and Lily (30F). Pete went to high school with my husband and I met him while we were still dating. He has since gotten married to Lily. They live a few states away now so this was a good excuse to see them again before the baby arrives. They booked two separate rooms at a resort so we could split into couples for some privacy each night. Our flight got in late on the first night, and to top it off, the airline sent our luggage to a different state. By the time we got to the resort, Adam and I went straight to bed.

The next morning, when I woke up, Adam wasn’t in bed, which was unusual. He had texted me to let him know when I woke up, and when I did, he quickly responded saying he was headed back to the room. When he returned, he mentioned that he’d gone to breakfast with Pete and Lily. I’m usually fine missing breakfast, but I’m pregnant and woke up starving, so we went back downstairs for me to grab something to eat.

Lily and Pete didn’t have any plans for the day other than going to the pool, but since Adam and I didn’t have swimsuits, we decided we needed to go to the mall. Pete and Lily wanted to join, so we split into two groups: Lily and I went together, and Adam and Pete went separately. While shopping, the airline called and told us we wouldn’t be getting our bags during the trip. This overwhelmed me, as I felt guilty shopping instead of relaxing by the pool like Lily and Pete had originally wanted. It didn’t help that I had only found an outfit for the day so I still had to find clothes for the next two days. While I was looking for a swimsuit, Lily went off to find me a shirt. She was gone for over 20 minutes, so I decided to find one myself. That’s when I ran into my husband holding the shirt Lily had gone to get for me, but she was nowhere to be found. I was shocked I didn’t have a meltdown right then and there because when did they meet up to exchange the shirt? Once we had the bare minimum, Adam texted Pete that we were ready to go.

At the resort, we went to our rooms to shower and change before dinner. During dinner, Adam and Lily carried on loud conversations for almost the whole meal, while Pete and I struggled to join in. We were all still pretty exhausted, so we went to bed after dinner. The next morning, we went to breakfast together, but once again, Adam and Lily dominated the conversation. Later, we went to the pool, and Pete and I decided not to get in since the water was chilly. Lily and my husband, however, spent a lot of time in the pool, chatting the entire time. We eventually had to get them out to eat, then the girls went to get their nails done and the guys played golf.

Around 5:30 PM, we realized there were no dinner reservations made. We scrambled to book something and finally got a reservation for 8 PM. By that time, I was pretty hangry, and the dinner was a bit tense, especially with two pregnant women and two drunk husbands. We went back to the resort afterward, played some games, and went to bed at a decent hour.

On the final morning, I woke up with a stomach ache and I hadn’t slept well, so I was already awake when my husband woke up. I mentioned to him that stomach was upset and said I wasn’t sure what would help. He went to use the restroom, then returned and said he was going to get coffee and offer to get me some. I don’t like coffee so I declined the offer and said food would probably be better. He told me to stay in bed and relax, promising he’d bring something up to me when he was done. This upset me because I didn’t want to wait with my stomach, but I didn’t want to argue. I assumed he had gotten food with his coffee but after 45 minutes of waiting, I couldn’t wait any longer, so I went downstairs to the café. I texted him while in the elevator and he responded with how he was about to head up with food for me. Since I was already almost there, I continued on my way. To my surprise, Adam and Lily were there alone. I assumed he was with both Lily and Pete, not just Lily. After everything that had happened over the weekend, I wasn’t happy to see them eating together while he had practically made me stay in the room. Lily noticed I wasn’t happy, so they decided to close out the breakfast tab when I arrived. Adam had ordered me yogurt, which was the last thing I wanted with an upset stomach, so I asked for toast instead.

When Lily went to place an order for Pete, who wasn’t feeling well either, I told my husband I found their behavior inappropriate and that I’d had enough of it over the weekend. He told me I was making an issue out of nothing. This isn’t the first time I’ve expressed concerns about his relationship with Lily, but it feels like every time I address it, we get nowhere. He insists there’s nothing to worry about since Lily is pregnant with Pete’s child, and he’s given me no reason to distrust him.

Am I overreacting, or should I contact Lily about my concerns? Keep in mind, she’s 34 weeks pregnant, which is why I haven’t brought it up to her. However, it’s eating away at me and I don’t know what to do since my husband doesn’t want to change his friendship with her. ",0,1736991852.0,AITAH,9,0.5,False

* 0.5oz / 15ml maple syrup
* 0.5oz / 15ml heavy cream
* 1 whole egg
* 12 coffee beans
* Garnish: Cinnamon

Dry shake all the ingredients, then shake again with ice. Double strain into a chilled coupe. Garnish with a few grates of cinnamon.

Had some leftover heavy cream from prepping a batch of Alton Brown’s egg nog for next winter and decided to use it to make this. Had never had it before and wow is it a delicious flip! It is amazing how much flavor the coffee beans impart just from the oils being incorporated during the shake. The Cynar adds a subtle depth and bitterness to marry with the bitter coffee notes, and the syrup adds just the right amount of sweetness to counter the richness of the cream and egg.

[[The quiet of the afternoon was broken only by the hum of the house and the soft tapping of feet as she moved about. The laundry needed folding, and the house was tidy enough, but her mind was already elsewhere, drifting. When the knock came at the door, it startled her, pulling her from her thoughts. She wasn’t expecting anyone, and yet, there was something almost inevitable about the moment.

She opened the door to a man standing before her—tall, with dark eyes that held a quiet intensity. The toolbag he carried didn’t seem to match the way he looked at her. He was dressed simply, but his presence filled the doorway, commanding her attention without trying. His gaze lingered on her just a bit longer than polite conversation would demand. Her heart skipped a beat. There was something about him—his calm confidence, the way he stood so assuredly—that drew her in, even as the rational part of her knew he was only there to fix the washer.

He stepped into the house, moving with a deliberate ease that felt almost like a dance. His presence seemed to occupy the space in ways that felt intimate.she led him to the laundry room, but instead of leaving him to work alone, she lingered. Her movements, slow and graceful, seemed to stretch the air between them. She bent to pick up the laundry, her body arching in a way that caught his attention, even if his gaze didn’t openly betray it.

As she moved closer to him, she let the edge of her body brush against his in a way that felt casual, but the air between them thickened immediately the man start feeling nervous and a bit pressure rising inside him. The heat of the moment wasn’t spoken, but it was undeniable, rising like steam in the space they shared. Each time she came within inches of him, her breath seemed to catch, her heart fluttering just slightly ang he slowly start getting hard

The tension was palpable—each glance, each accidental brush of skin felt charged with a growing undercurrent. Claire’s motions grew more languid, deliberate. She bent lower to retrieve a stray sock from the floor, the shift in her posture giving him an unintentional glimpse of her. His hands paused for the briefest of moments, his gaze falling on her with an intensity that made her pulse race. The room suddenly felt smaller, the space between them electric with the tension they both felt but had yet to acknowledge.they start taking with each other while he repairing the machine like her lives , about her husband and the relationship and all , she try to ask about his girlfriends,his relationship and all but in a bit seductive way

With every shift of her body, every soft movement, Claire drew closer to him. She wasn’t sure if it was intentional anymore, but she couldn’t help herself. The seductive energy that hung between them was almost tangible, and the way he responded, a subtle shift in his stance, a barely-there deepening of his breath, told her that he felt it too.

As she leaned against the counter, her body a little closer than necessary, she caught his eye in the mirror over the laundry room sink. He was watching her now, fully aware of her every movement. She let her fingers trace the edge of the counter, drawing his attention to her hand as it inched closer to where he worked. The air was thick, and for a brief moment, time seemed to stretch.

Her body shifted again, this time with more purpose. She brushed her arm against his as she reached for a detergent bottle, her hand grazing lightly over his skin. His response was immediate—his breath slightly sharper, his eyes briefly flicking to hers with a quiet heat. Claire held his gaze in the mirror, her lips curling into a slow, knowing smile.

She moved past him once more, her body brushing so closely that she could feel the heat of his skin, the subtle flex of his muscles. And when she moved away again, she didn’t retreat; instead, she lingered, feeling the pull of the space between them like a magnet.

By the time he finished his work, the air was thick with unspoken promise, but the moment ended as silently as it had begun. He gathered his tools, his movements measured, almost reluctant, and as he walked toward the door, he turned to her one last time. She stood there, her heart still racing, her thoughts tangled in the space between them.

I moved to Vancouver about a year ago and have been loving the coffee scene here – especially anything pour-over related. I’ve been thinking about starting a coffee club for people who are passionate about brewing, tasting, and chatting about coffee.

I’ll be honest: I’ve never really met people online before, and I find it a bit unusual. I imagine a lot of others might feel the same way. But I figured this could be a great way to meet some like-minded coffee enthusiasts, explore local coffee shops, and maybe even improve my English (I’m still working on speaking confidently and getting past my accent).

If you’re into pour-over or specialty coffee and like the idea of connecting with others in person, drop a comment or send me a message! 😊

Roger opened his eyes groggily. He stared at the ceiling for a moment before smiling. It was the weekend; finally, he had the day off. He got up in his pajamas and slipped on his slippers to make himself a cup of coffee. After brewing it, he couldn't think of anywhere better than his porch to enjoy the crisp spring morning air.

It was a beautiful day outside—the air was fresh, the birds were singing, and the sun was just peeking over the horizon with not a cloud in sight. He sat down and took a deep breath. Then another. And another. Something was... wrong. What was that pungent smell?

He set his coffee mug on the nearby table and got up to investigate. Walking off the porch, he headed toward his new pool. It was a bit extravagant, he knew, but after getting a promotion at work, he'd decided to treat himself. Last summer, he built the pool. But when he looked down at the water, it wasn't the beautiful, clean pool he'd known.

No. It was... yellow? How could it be? The smell was so bad it was almost unbearable! Someone—or multiple people, hundreds, even—must have done this. But who? Who had he wronged so badly that they would orchestrate this? He had to find out who had ruined his beautiful pool.

Frustrated, he sighed and went back inside with his coffee, away from the horrible smell. He sat at the small kitchen table with some fried eggs and bacon, thinking about people he might have wronged. Tammy from the third grade? Evan, his coworker, whose desk he'd accidentally spilled coffee on? Or Cindy, who he had to assign extra work to, leading to her termination? No, it couldn't be them. Only one person came to mind.

He picked up the phone and asked the operator to route him. The phone rang for a while before a female voice came through.

""Hello? Who is this? And why are you calling me so early?"" the irritated voice on the other end asked.

""It's me,"" Roger said. Silence followed. For a moment, he thought the line had been disconnected.

""What do you want, Roger? You got the house, the money, and the new car. What do you want now? The kids?""

""Maybe I will after the bullshit you pulled!""

""What are you talking about now?""

""You know what you did!""

""No, I do NOT.""

""Then who got at least 100 guys to piss in my pool, huh?!""

""What? You called about, WHAT!?""

""Come on, Jane! You're the only one with that many friends and the gall to do it!""

""No, I did not, Roger. Leave me alone.""

The line went dead. Roger slammed the receiver back onto the cradle. His only lead was gone. He had no other ideas—except one. He picked up the phone again and called his friend, Franklin.

He left the house and got into his car. He was headed to a friend's place on the other side of town. He sat down in his brand-new Dodge Royal and started the car. It started right up. He quickly put it in gear and pulled away. On the way, he tried his best to recollect the last couple of days.

When he arrived, his old friend Franklin was sitting in the yard in a lawn chair. He was sipping a beer, enjoying his recent retirement from the force. Once a great investigator, Frank had decided to retire early after a recent case almost ended badly for him. Roger pulled up into the driveway of Frank's new home, which he had bought shortly after his early retirement.

""Hey, Frank!"" Roger greeted his old friend warmly.

""Hey, Roger! What do you think of the new house?""

""It's nice, Frank,"" said Roger. It was a very nice house, but Roger wasn't really paying attention. His mind was occupied with other things.

""Want a beer?""

""Sure.""

Frank got up and came back with another lawn chair and a couple of beers.

""So, Roger, you said you needed some advice about something you wanted to talk about in person.""

""Yes. Uh, well, I don't know how to say this, but someone—well, not just one, but multiple... Hundreds of people—have peed in my pool.""

Frank looked at Roger in amazement and disbelief for a moment.

""So, you're telling me that hundreds of people broke into your backyard... to pee in your pool?""

""I know it's ridiculous, but... Come on, let me just show you.""

Roger got up, and Frank followed him as they both got into the car and drove to Roger's house. Roger mechanically unlocked the door, stepped out onto the porch, and walked down to the pool. Frank just looked at the yellow pool in disbelief.

Frank began stumbling over his words: ""Wh—Ho—, Who. What, How, Who, When, And most importantly... WHY?""

Roger just looked at him, shaking his head. ""I don't know... Will you help me, Frank?""

Frank nodded his head. ""Especially for a friend, of course.""

Frank decided to activate his investigator mode. ""So, what were you doing the night before you came home and woke up to... this?""

""Well,"" Roger started, ""I went out to the new tiki bar that opened by the beach. I met a nice girl named Janet. We sat at the bar and talked for hours. It was really nice. It was a beautiful night.""

Frank interjected, ""Was she with anyone else?""

""Not that I know of.""

""Okay, continue.""

""Around midnight, I left the bar. I walked, not too far from home, so I didn't drive there. Then I got inside the house and collapsed on the bed. I was hammered.""

Frank nodded, thinking through what Roger had just told him. ""Okay. This morning, when you walked down your porch, did you investigate any further?""

Roger looked embarrassed for a moment, then said, ""No, I immediately went inside. I thought it had to be Jane.""

Frank looked at him, then said, ""Roger, there is no possible way she did this.""

Roger nodded his head. ""Okay, let's start the investigation.""

They looked around the yard for the next half hour. They found no evidence of a break-in. Nothing in the garden shed. They found one beer can: Marty Waterhouse Lite Beer. Roger and Frank sat defeated inside, looking at the single empty beer can, before Roger came up with the single craziest idea he had ever thought of.

""The Waterhouse Brewery headquarters is in town,"" Roger said.

Frank nodded along, encouraging Roger to continue.

""What if we get the serial number off this beer can, trace it to who bought it, and track down who did this?""

Frank looked at him for a moment, the gears in his head turning. ""Yes, it's a long shot, but it's possible. I have some contacts at headquarters who owe me favors. Let's go!""

Frank quickly got up and dragged Roger out the door. Frank decided he should drive, as Roger had never been to the headquarters.

The bright red Dodge Royal, with its white accents, pulled into the parking lot of the imposingly tall brewery headquarters. It wasn't out of place with the other luxury vehicles driven by company executives. What was out of place were the two disheveled men who climbed out.

Roger looked up at the tallest building in Whitefront, California. The small town had been booming the last few years as people flocked to the coast. The beer company, Waterhouse, and its CEO and founder had decided it was best to move their headquarters from the East Coast to California because of the growing market. To cut costs, they chose a small town, and ever since, the town had flourished.

Roger had never been here before. He worked at a small but lucrative law office. It was clear the town's success was largely due to this company.

They entered the reception area and spoke to the receptionist.

""Hey, I'm here to talk to Gordon. Tell him Frank is asking for him.""

The receptionist nodded. ""Ok, I'll let Mr. Gordon know before I leave. My shift is ending."" She got up from her desk and briskly walked out the back door. That's when someone Roger never wanted to see again entered to replace her.

""Roger! Why in the hell are you here?"" Roger's ex-wife, Jane, burst out.

Roger decided to briskly walk to the elevator with Frank, ignoring his ex-wife.

""Roger, you better get your ass—""

The elevator doors quickly closed, cutting off what she was about to say. Frank leaned over, clicking the fourth floor. Relaxing music played in the background as they ascended. He couldn't make out all the lyrics, but something about a beautiful night for a party echoed softly.

The elevator quickly closed, cutting off what she was about to say. Frank leaned over, clicking the button for the 4th floor. Relaxing music played in the background as they ascended. He couldn't catch all the lyrics, but it was something about a beautiful night for a party.

The elevator dinged, and the doors opened. Frank led Roger down the hall until they came to a door with Gordon's nameplate. They knocked.

""Come in!""

The door opened to a large, spacious office with floor-to-ceiling windows. Gordon, to Roger's surprise, was a young Black man with a wide, welcoming smile.

""Frank! Nice to see you, my old friend. And...?""

""Roger,"" he said curtly. Gordon's smile dimmed slightly at Roger's tone. Turning back to Frank, Gordon said, ""I heard about your retirement! Congratulations! Speaking of that, we still need to plan the retirement party—""

""I'm here on business, Gordon,"" Frank interrupted quickly.

""Aren't you retired?""

""I am. This is personal. I need to help my friend Roger here with a case.""

Gordon nodded. ""So, you need my help?""

""Yes,"" Frank responded.

""What do you need?"" Gordon asked.

Frank set a crumpled beer can on the desk.

""A beer can?"" Gordon said, confused.

""I need you to trace the serial number of this beer can to where it was sold. We suspect our suspect purchased this beer.""

Gordon nodded, then shuffled through papers and opened several filing cabinets before shaking his head.

""Nope, not here. It's probably in Quality Assurance. We keep the serial numbers in case we have to withdraw a product from shelves—makes it easier to know what was affected.""

Frank sighed in disappointment, but Gordon spoke up again.

""But I do have access.""

Gordon led Roger and Frank through the hallway into a large room with many cubicles. People typed away on typewriters. Roger observed Gordon, contemplating how, despite looking down on him, the man was still helping him. Strange.

Finally, they arrived at a locked door. Gordon pulled out a key and unlocked it. Inside were rows upon rows of filing cabinets. Frank sighed.

""This is going to take hours, isn't it?""

And it did. Hours passed as they sifted through files.

""This is taking forever!"" Roger complained.

""I found it!"" Gordon yelled out.

It was exactly what they where looking for. 04/11/54—all the beer made that day and delivered that night. Skimming the files, they found the serial number they sought: C308.

Inside the file was a simple message, only three words long, that crushed the investigation instantly: ""Lost in Shipping.""

Roger almost wanted to cry. He had spent his entire Saturday chasing a lead that ultimately led nowhere. As they left, Frank turned to Gordon.

""Thanks again, man. Sorry to waste your time.""

Gordon nodded. Roger, feeling the need to show some gratitude, said, ""Thank you."" Gordon nodded again, understanding in his eyes.

The office was emptying as they walked through the cubicles, everyone heading home for the day. They took the elevator down.

""Damn it, Roger!""

They were immediately greeted by Jane as they stepped off the elevator. ""What were you doing up there all day, huh? Getting a lawyer to squeeze more out of the divorce? Buying another extravagant beer keg for your house?""

Roger just looked at her in exhaustion and defeat, shaking his head.

""Leave him alone, Jane; he's been through a lot today,"" Frank said earnestly.

""Leave him alone?! Leave him alone?! Oh boy, don't you have a lot of nerve. You're lucky we're in PUBLIC! I would cuss you out right now! He didn't leave me alone this morning, he didn't leave me alone during the divorce, he didn't even leave me alone when we were married! NO! I will not leave him alone.""

She kept going on and on as Frank dragged Roger back to the car. Roger insisted on driving.

""I need more than just a beer—something stronger,"" Roger said before starting the car and driving off.

""Where are we going?"" Frank asked.

""To the tiki bar.""

By the time they arrived, the bar was already starting to fill up. Frank and Roger went inside and sat down. Roger turned to Frank. ""Drinks are on me tonight for all the work we did today. How about a margarita?""

Frank looked at him and said, ""I've never had one.""

Roger looked at Frank in amazement. ""Never had one? They're great! Two margaritas, please.""

That's when a familiar face came into view. Janet from last night came up and sat next to them.

""Hi, Roger, nice to see you again.""

""Hey, Janet.""

""Is something wrong?""

Frank turned to her and said, ""He's down today. Someone... vandalized his pool.""

Janet turned back to Roger. ""Is there anything else I can do to help?""

Frank spoke up for Roger. ""Yes, there is. Roger said you weren't with anyone, as far as he knew, but if you were, they could have been the ones who did this.""

Janet nodded, thinking for a moment, before saying, ""I had a date with some guy named Mark, I think? No, wait..."" Janet thought for a moment. ""Max? No..."" Finally, she spoke up. ""Marty... some Marty Water... Horse?""

Frank looked at her, wide-eyed. ""Waterhouse?!""

Janet looked at him for a moment. ""Yes! That was it!""

Roger stared at her in amazement. ""So, you're telling me you ditched a rich millionaire beer tycoon to go on a date with me and didn't even remember his name?!""

Janet nodded. ""You were cute; he wasn't. I got super drunk.""

Roger abruptly got up and started walking toward the door.

""Roger! What about the margaritas?!"" Frank called after him.

""Put it on my tab! I need my Warm Justice!"" Roger replied.

""Roger, don't do this,"" said Frank, not chasing him.

""Roger, Marty is a dangerous man. He's the reason I retired! He and his men almost killed me!"" Frank desperately called out, but Roger wasn't listening.

""Who's going to take me home?!"" Frank said more to himself than to Roger. He was long gone.

Frank sighed. Maybe Janet would take him home. He walked back in the bar to finish the margaritas that roger bought.

Roger was speeding down the road, bee-lining it straight to Marty's house. He lived in the new wealthy neighborhood being built on the west side of town near the beach. He was doing well over the speed limit, and no stoplight or stop sign would stop him. He was getting angrier and angrier. Marty had no right—no right at all—to do that. Roger didn't even know he was there. Instead of acting like a child, Marty could have just spoken up about how Roger had stolen his date. But did he do that? No. He went out of his way to recruit an army of men to piss in Roger's brand-new pool.

By the time Roger pulled into the driveway of the mansion, he was furious. He saw that Waterhouse had one of those fancy electronic gates with a code. Of course, the flimsy gate was no match for Roger ramming it with his car at 65 MPH. The gates broke instantly, surprisingly causing minimal damage to the car.

Roger sat in the car for a moment, ""To late to second guess yourself now Roger,"" He said to himself.

Roger slammed on the brakes, got out, and marched his way up to the door, holding a big lug wrench as his weapon. The door was far too sturdy for him to get through, but luckily for Roger, glass isn't as strong. He smashed the window in with the wrench before climbing inside, disregarding the glass shards that could have cut him if he weren't careful.

""WATERHOUSE! I'M HERE, ASSHOLE! COME ON OUT AND FIGHT ME!""

That's when, unexpectedly, a bottle smashed into Roger's face. Glass shards and beer went everywhere. It was a ball of fury and hate. The men fought wildly, clearly never having been in many physical fights. They tried every dirty move they could think of to get the upper hand. Eventually, Roger got the upper hand and threw Waterhouse outside into the mud before throwing himself on top of him.

They fought in the mud, blood, and beer. Punch after punch, Roger sent directly into Marty's face. Over and over again, until he paused. He looked up. Surrounding him were 300 men, all staring at Roger with bitter hatred.

Acting fast, Roger climbed back through the broken window. The way to the door was blocked by Gordon.

""I Forged that missing shipping document for a reason, damn it, Roger!""

Roger shook his head in amazement. ""Gordon!?""

Gordon started walking toward Roger. ""You just couldn't stay away, could you?""

Thinking fast, Roger hit Gordon over the head with the wrench. Before Gordon could regain his composure, Roger ran behind him to the front door. Locked. Gordon was already getting up, ready to lunge forward to grab Roger. That's when Roger saw it: the pull string to open the stairs to the attic.

He quickly pulled it down before scrambling up the stairs. Once inside, he pulled it back up behind him. He looked around eagerly for an escape. There was a window big enough to jump out of into the pool in the front yard.

Roger smashed the window with his wrench before quickly jumping out, diving into the pool. He quickly surfaced and scrambled out. He ran to his car and started it. The engine roared as reliably as ever. Roger quickly shifted into gear and took off.

He thought he was safe until he saw a pair of headlights. Then another. Car after car joined the chase. He sped up, slowed down, and went around and around the twisting hills, trying to get away from them. Eventually, he made it back into town, driving wildly through the empty streets. That's when—BOOM—the front tire suddenly burst on his Dodge. The car swerved, sending him into a light pole.

""Damn it, Roger! Are you drinking and driving again?!"" said an irritated voice.

In amazement, Roger realized he had just so happened to crash his car right in front of Jane. Before he could second-guess himself, he said, ""Get in the car!""

""Are you crazy, Roger? If not, you're drunk. The front tire popped! You need to change it, then you need to pay for the damn light pole you nearly snapped in half!""

Roger nervously glanced in the rearview mirror as headlights started shining on the far wall. ""Trust me, this one damn time, Jane—get in the car, or we both die!""

""Roger, shut up! You never listened to me. Why should I listen to you now? I didn't want the divorce, but you insisted, despite the fact that you were the one who cheated. And you know what? Thank you, Roger! It was the best decision of your life!""

Roger thought back to it and suddenly realized—she was right.

He had been a terrible husband, father, and person, and did not deserve a thing he owned. Roger sighed before looking up at Jane and, in earnest, said, ""You're right. I was a horrible husband and an even worse father to our children. I deserved every word and more—much more than what you've said. And I am so, so sorry. But Jane, I'm telling you right now—please believe me—we WILL BE DEAD in less than 30 seconds unless you get in this damn car right now!""

Jane looked down in amazement at Roger for a moment before actually opening the passenger door and getting in. ""You better be right.""

With that, Roger attempted to restart the car. The starter whirled. He clearly heard some fluid leaking from the car, and the hum of the engine got closer and closer as the first Chevy Impala started pulling into view.

Jane screamed in horror. Then the engine coughed, sputtered, and roared to life. Roger quickly threw the car in reverse and slammed on the gas. The car peeled out, now driving backward as it was chased.

""You know that trick with the handbrake to do a 180-degree turn like in the movies?""

""Roger, are you crazy?!""

""Maybe.""

Roger sharply turned the wheel, pulled the handbrake, popped the clutch, and shifted into gear before peeling away. ""There is no way I just did that!""

Roger navigated the streets swiftly and effectively until he turned off onto the street to exit town. There he saw the line of Oldsmobiles, with Marty Waterhouse standing in front of them, pointing a .44 revolver right at them.

Immediately, shots started being fired.

""Jane, get down!""

Both ducked under the dash. Roger sent the car careening straight into the blockade. CRASH. The sounds of twisted metal and breaking glass filled the air, along with more gunshots. Miraculously, Roger and Jane were unharmed.

They sat back up. Roger smiled at Jane. ""We did it!""

That's when the engine started sputtering. It coughed once, then twice, and then died. They were only a few hundred feet away.

Roger and Jane quickly got out and started running. BANG. The .44 went off.

""You better stop, you two, before you get shot,"" said Marty Waterhouse, now with severe damage—two black eyes, a broken nose that was bleeding, and several missing teeth.

""You've got yourself a little accomplice now, huh, Roger?""

Marty started walking toward them, the gun in his hand gleaming under the dim streetlights. The subtle tap, tap, tap of his footsteps echoed as he approached.

""You can't get away with this! They'll find us and trace it back to you!"" Roger spat out in desperation.

""I own this town, Roger. I have every dirty cop, the city council, and even the mayor under my thumb. This is easy, Roger.""

""You can't do this, Marty! How will you explain us going missing? The town just can't ignore it!"" Jane yelled.

""You're right, they can't. That's why I've planned how you'll die. I thought about pulling out your teeth one by one, then beating you to death. But honestly, I just want you gone. That's when it hit me—it's so simple. The newspapers will say, ""Local Man goes insane after someone peed in is pool, kills Ex-Wife in revenge""

Jane gasped in horror. Roger just stared at Marty, expressionless.

""Get the sacks, boys!""

Suddenly, a few of Marty's men came up behind Jane and Roger. They were shoved into burlap sacks and thrown into the trunk of Marty's car. Roger started hyperventilating. The darkness and tight confines of the bag were suffocating. He clawed at the fabric, desperate to escape, when a knife suddenly pierced through the material, cutting it open.

Above him was Jane, holding a pocket knife. ""Damn it, Roger, stop squirming. I might accidentally cut you,"" she whispered.

Eventually, she cut him fully free from the bag. The trunk was surprisingly spacious, allowing both of them to kneel.

""Okay, we need to get the hell out of here,"" Jane said urgently.

Roger nodded in agreement. Jane pulled out a multi-tool from her other pocket, using the toothpick attachment to work on the locking mechanism.

The lock soon popped open.

""Okay, Roger, we need to wait until the car stops—hopefully at a stoplight—so we can slip out and get away, okay?""

Roger didn't have time to respond before the car came to a halt.

""Now!"" she whispered urgently.

Roger quickly scrambled out of the cramped space and helped Jane out. That's when Roger noticed their stopping point: they were at his backyard. It was too late.

""Good job, you two,"" said a voice behind them.

They whipped around to see Marty Waterhouse walking toward them.

""You actually made my job easier—I don't even have to drag you out of the bags,"" he said, smiling menacingly, his gun glinting in the soft moonlight. Behind him, the pool glowed a faint, sickly yellow.

Marty cocked the hammer of the revolver. ""Any last words, Roger?""

""behind you!"" Roger shouted.

Marty whipped around, falling for the trick. He instantly realized his mistake when Roger's fist connected directly with his face. Roger tried to wrestle the gun away. Jane Tried to help but quickly was thrown off by Marty.

That's when Waterhouse gained the upper hand. He jabbed Roger in the stomach with his elbow, pushing him back. Roger doubled over in pain.

""I'll kill your ex-wife first, then!""

Before Marty could say anything else, an old black Oldsmobile smashed through Roger's back fence. Its siren blared as the car skidded to a halt.

Frank threw himself out of his car, his trusty service pistol in hand.

""Get on the ground, Waterhouse! You're under arrest!""

Marty put his hands up, knowing he was defeated. ""You were the only one I couldn't pay off,"" he said.

He threw the revolver forward, causing it to discharge and hit Frank in the foot. Frank cursed several times before walking over to Waterhouse and handcuffing him. Soon, the rest of the force arrived on the scene.

Roger was still stunned by the events when he turned to Jane.

""Roger!"" Jane cried.

She seemed to have just processed what had almost happened and threw her arms around him, sobbing into his shoulder.

""Roger, we almost died! We almost died! What would've happened if I hadn't—""

Roger cut her off. ""Don't think about that. We're safe. We're safe now.""

He held her in his arms for a long moment as the arrests continued in his backyard. She turned her face up to him, tears still shining in her eyes. He looked down at her, and in that moment, she was the most beautiful woman in the world.

""I sure did get revenge on the son of a bitch who peed in my pool didnt I?""

Jane laughed at the absurdity of it all.

He leaned in and kissed her.

And so, on that day, 300 men were arrested, marking the largest arrest in California history. Gordon and Waterhouse were charged with multiple crimes, including Bribery, forged documents, tax evasion, and mass vandalism.

Frank only came because of Janet bugged him to after Roger left and waited for Roger to come back. When Marty showed up instead he knew what to do. After this continued to enjoy his retirement, occasionally helping with small cases. Janet and Frank got married a couple of years later. Tammy, from Roger's third-grade class, took over the beer company and continued steering it toward success.

And Roger? He and Jane remarried that year and lived happily together, building a much healthier relationship. In the end, Roger's pool vandalism was covered by his homeowner's insurance, making the entire ordeal a petty tale of revenge gone awry. But hey, at least he brought down an entire crime ring and rekindled his relationship with his Ex-Wife right?

**1. Identify the Cause**

* **Sweat or body odor:** Common for older mattresses.
* **Spills or stains:** Liquids like coffee, wine, or juice can leave lingering smells.
* **Urine or pet accidents:** These require targeted treatment.
* **Mold or mildew:** Often due to moisture exposure.

**2. General Cleaning Steps**

1. **Vacuum the Mattress:**
   * Use a vacuum with an upholstery attachment to remove dust, hair, and debris.
2. **Sprinkle Baking Soda:**
   * Generously sprinkle baking soda over the mattress.
   * Let it sit for several hours (or overnight for stronger odors). Baking soda absorbs moisture and neutralizes odors.
3. **Vacuum Again:**
   * Thoroughly vacuum the baking soda off the mattress.

**3. Treat Stains**

* **For sweat or general stains:**
   * Mix equal parts water and white vinegar in a spray bottle.
   * Lightly mist the stained area (avoid soaking the mattress).
   * Blot with a clean cloth and sprinkle with baking soda. Vacuum once dry.
* **For urine or pet accidents:**
   * Use an enzyme-based cleaner designed for breaking down organic materials.
   * Follow the product instructions and ensure the area dries completely.

**4. Deodorize Further**

* **Essential Oils:**
   * Add a few drops of lavender, tea tree, or eucalyptus oil to the baking soda before sprinkling it on.
* **White Vinegar Mist:**
   * Lightly mist the entire mattress with diluted white vinegar (50% water, 50% vinegar) and let it air dry.
* **Activated Charcoal or Odor Absorbers:**
   * Place these near the mattress to absorb residual smells.

**5. Sunlight and Ventilation**

* Move the mattress to a well-ventilated area or outdoors on a sunny, dry day.
* Sunlight helps kill bacteria and remove odors naturally.

**6. Prevent Future Odors**

* Use a **waterproof mattress protector** to prevent spills or stains.
* Wash bed linens regularly.
* Air out your mattress every few months by exposing it to fresh air and sunlight.

If odors persist despite cleaning, they may be deeply embedded, and professional mattress cleaning services might be necessary.",1,1736991342.0,Bedscape,0,1.0,False

I’m looking to send a package to a friend in the US (New Orleans to be exact). I’m hoping to send a few shirts along with some hair and skincare products (maybe a small perfume too).
Would I have to ship these items in their original containers or would it be ok if I transfer them to smaller spray bottles and containers? 

I want to wrap these items inside the box as well because they’re meant to be gifts, but I’m not sure if they would open up the package for any inspections along the way. 

And are snacks allowed as well? I’m hoping to send things like Coffee Crisp that they can’t find there. 

Sorry if these are dumb questions, never sent anything from here to the US before so any advice is appreciated :’) 

Thank you so much!

So of course it gave me the empty tray warning, again again and again. I pulled out the infuser, cleaned it, also cleaned grinds in the machine but now it continues to tell me I need more ground coffee. Did I break it, can a reset help?

Please help!

Thank you

I keep doing things to try and get ahead and all that keeps happening is i get pushed back further. I loved in Washington for a while to help out my best friend and when I came back to Oklahoma the only job I could get that paid more than 11 an hour was a job 40 min one way from my home where I only made 15 as their sole receiver working a 9 hr shift mon-fri. I had to move in with my mom who has never really made efforts to be close to me no matter how much I've tried and asked and communicated. Her boyfriend lived with her for 2 years before I moved back and he didn't have a job until after I did. The whole time he was telling her to make me pay rent and that I was bumming off of her and that I never did anything. I have a now almost 6 yr old son who I provide and take sole care of. I would cook all of the time unless he wanted something simple and when I did my mom and her bf would eat it but they never offered food. Never bought the groceries. I took care of the dogs most of the time even though I was gone from the house more than they were and I cleaned up after her bf and the animals too. I kept searching for jobs. I kept applying. Eventually my son's dad's family told me to move in with them and get a better job. I did. Within the first month the step father was threatening to kick me out because he ASSUMED I had borderline personality disorder and said he thought I was poisoning him because his coffee tasted weird one morning. (I leave the house at 430 am and they don't get up until 6:30/7). Amongst other things that he said. So I started looking for places again and jobs. Then the mom (we will call her Bri) asked me not to leave. That she doesn't want me to move out and that she was going to divorce him and that she wanted my son and I to stay. So you know what stupid choice I made? 

That's right. I stopped looking. 

Until about 2 weeks ago when she sprung up on me that she wanted me to look for a place. Today the dude got mad at me because a housing thing I was really hoping for fell through and he wanted to have another talk where he just berated me for shit the whole time. 
Us three have had 3 sit downs now where he just talks down to both bri and I and it doesn't matter if it's in my control or not. It is my problem and I ""should be doing things to make him happy"". 

This is the short version of things and my point is that I seriously want to move far far far away from all of these people and this state. I hate it here. ",1,1736991270.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,0.99,False

**Tuesday, April 25, 2079**

It was several days later when Endara was knocking on Agatha’s door. An old set of fabric and color was draped over her arms as Agatha opened the door and yawned before staring at her mother in confusion.

“I’m up, we got school, I know.” Agatha sighed.

“Can I?” Endara nodded into Agatha’s room.

Agatha noticed the cloth on her mother’s arm and stepped back.

Endara stepped in and looked at her daughter’s room draped in posters of death metal, dark metal and other various types of metal bands. Other posters were designed to evoke her chosen faith. A few were simply there to be strangely violent and evocative all at once. Endara turned and held out the cloth, letting it fall a bit to reveal a dark purple and white dress.  

“What is this?” Agatha looked it over.

“My old prom dress.” Endara smiled, “I know you probably think it’s silly, but I never actually got to really enjoy it.” 

Agatha blinked, “But I’ve seen the pictures.” 

“And twenty minutes after your dad was kidnapped.” Endara sighed. 

“He really did get napped a lot, didn’t he?” Agatha snickered.

“They named a kidnapping law after him.” Endara sighed and then laughed, “Honestly, I wanted you to have my old wedding dress too at some point but that is a bit...” She nodded her head, “... impossible now.” 

“It was in the box?” Agatha sighed.

“It was in the box.” Endara nodded, “So I figured this might be a good second option?” She held the dress up to her daughter. 

“Mom.” Agatha hugged her mother closely, which seemed to surprise her mother. “You’re just as bad as dad is, you know?” 

“I am not.” Endara snorted.

“When’s the last time you were in here?” Agatha arched an eyebrow and slid the dress from her mother’s hands. “Like, really in here for a talk or a concern.” 

Endara shook her head, “I never wanted to upset you, it always seemed this was your safe space.” 

“Mom.” Agatha rolled her eyes. “We’re home, this is all a safe space. But I feel safest when you and dad are around. You two can always handle anything.” 

Endara sighed and sat on the edge of her daughter’s bed. “I guess I haven’t been as open as I thought I’ve been.” 

Agatha shrugged. “I dunno, you give us space, you listen. But honestly, I’d have liked a little more course correction before I hit eighteen.” 

Endara smirked, “We still have a few months and I expect to have to lay down the law a few more times.” 

Agatha smiled back and held the dress out, it was a tie-dye mix of purples, blues, reds and blacks. Agatha’s eyes went wide as she took it in and smiled. 

“You like it?” Endara asked.

Agatha nodded, “Needs some adjusting, but we have Cassandra and time. We can work on it.” 

Endara smiled, “And if you and Danny are interested, I’ve managed to get a block of time to visit your Grandmother. It wasn’t easy.” 

Agatha nodded, “Given grand-dad’s behavior, I’m not sure. But if Danny’s up for it, I think we both have questions.” 

Endara stood up and hugged her daughter. “I’m so proud of you.” 

Agatha returned the hug, “Thanks. Danny should hear that too.” 

“I know, he’s talking with your dad right now.” Endara sighed. 

“Danny’s not gonna notice her hitting on him.” Agatha smirked, “He’s like dad in that regard.” 

“Your father knows when I’m interested in him.” Endara smirked.

“Yeah, because of years of living with you.” Agatha snorted, “It took him a month after you got remarried to fully react without covert gestures or secret codes.” 

“He didn’t want to hurt Anna.” Endara sighed.

“Anna spotted them first.” Agatha laughed.

«It’s true.» Anna’s voice peeked into their minds. «Why do you think she started to drag me to the Wi-Casting.»

“Rude!” Agatha shouted.

«Think quieter!» Anna said, «I’m downstairs!»

Endara looked concerned, as did Agatha. 

“She sound worried?” Agatha asked.

Endara nodded, “Come on. Dress later, your sister now.” 

Agatha put the dress on her bed and snapped her fingers several times. Two puffs of sulfurous smoke and a dog and goat were following behind her. Agatha and Endara made their way down stairs to Anna in the den.  

In his office Alan was sitting next to his son while a game was being played on his computer. They each had a controller and were racing the other in a classic car game that was older than even Alan was. A harsh swerve from Danny sent his father careening into a wall and he lost his last balloon on his vehicle.

“I do not admit defeat.” Alan said as the game ended.

“Game says otherwise.” Danny smirked. “Okay, games are nice, but why?” Danny leaned forward, into the back of the reversed chair he was sitting in.

Alan leaned back into his large office lounger and exhaled deeply. “Remember the birds and bees?” 

Danny rolled his eyes. “Yes.” 

“Well, prom is coming up.” Alan said, “Pay attention to your date. Her words, her actions.” 

Danny nodded, “Dad I’m not an idiot.” 

“You’re a Quain and a guy. We have a bad record there Danny.” Alan laughed, “Even your uncle.” 

Danny went to argue but paused, then nodded. “Continue.” 

“I’m not saying Heith will drag you into a closet.” Alan stopped when his son chuckled, “What?”

“That is literally how Cassie found us when the mess started.” Danny chuckled and paused, “Oh god...” 

“See.” Alan nodded, “Didn’t even figure out how that looked.” 

Danny made a futile roar of frustration, “Well, I’ll have to keep my eyes and ears peeled.” 

“Key thing to remember.” Alan said as he started another game. “Respect her wishes.” 

“Duh.” Danny rolled his eyes, then looked at the game. “What’s a Contra?” 

“No idea.” Alan shrugged. “Salem said we’d never beat it.” 

“Let’s prove him wrong then.” Danny snorted.

“Let’s.” Alan nodded, “Good talk.” 

“Yeah...” Danny smiled, “Thanks.” 

“You know I’m here when you need me.” Alan was about to playfully take his son’s controller when a psychic scream from Anna rolled over the property.

“Game on pause.” Danny said as he shot up.

“Yup.” Alan nodded and left with his son.

When Alan and Danny got to the den Anna was standing on the coffee table shouting at the TV with Hong Long growling and barking along with her. Agatha and Endara were standing to either side with concerned looks on their faces. Cassandra and Cxaltho were watching with Stephen from the bannister.

“WHY CAN’T THIS OLD SHIT STAIN JUST DIE!” Anna roared.

“Okay...” Endara reached up and grabbed her step daughter who flailed helplessly in the older woman’s grip.  

Endara then sat her on the couch and muted the TV. Agatha stepped in front of the screen as Alan and Danny stepped into the area. Anna sat down and glared past Endara while Hong Long craned himself over Agatha.

“Try me lizard-lips, we haven’t rumbled.” Agatha glared up at the dragon.

Hong Long snarled, but immediately backed down with a glance back at Anna. He then shrunk and curled up in Anna’s lap like a large cat. Anna began to pat and hug the dragon and visibly calmed as she did so.

“What happened?” Alan asked as he took in the sight and sounds of his daughter going off like a bomb. 

“Kincaid.” Stephen said as he finally made his way into the den. “I was listening to it on the radio.” 

“He’s done a complete one-eighty.” Agatha said.

“Worse, actually.” Stephen corrected his niece. “He’s implementing more restrictions on young heroes, some of which he’s trying to get put into effect retroactively. They could go after any of the kids in the city.” 

Alan’s head tilted as he looked at the TV. “I get the anger.” His tone became ice, “And the desire for his end, but damn.” 

“Now...” Anna huffed, “We need to have Charter permission to defend ourselves.” 

“What?” Alan snapped. 

“Trident’s marching with others.” Stephen said, “Some of ours too.” 

“Good!” Alan snapped, “Where is this asshat; Lansing?” 

Stephen shook his head, “That’s the new Civic Center.” 

“Well at least he made it easy for our home team.” Alan watched the scene. “Who’s the nerd next to Kincaid?” 

On the screen next to Senator Kincaid was a mouse of a man, barely five foot five, but stooped over and clearly trying not to be seen. The man radiated an intense feeling of malice, even through the TV as he smiled at the new rules that were being read off. Alan unmuted the TV to listen closer.

“Dad.” Anna groaned. 

“...Curfew will start at Ten PM sharp for heroes of age 17 and under.” Kincaid smiled, “As it has been shown that even at that young an age the power afforded them needs guidance.”

“Honey.” Endara smiled sweetly, “I might break his legs.” 

“I call his jaw.” Alan glared at the screen.

The family watched and listened to various rules that were clearly and obviously being drawn out to restrict young heroes and their ability defend and conduct themselves in a safe and reasonable manner, then the doors of the civic center were pushed open and Trident stood in one of his old suits, leaders from around the state and country gathered behind him. Alan was proud to see Vile’Ethiscore standing, wearing a single piece leather pauldron over his left shoulder labelled with the BSC logo. SideEffect stood next to him with Van, just behind both. Alan let a small squeal of happiness escape him as he watched.

**---B)(S)(F---**

“We’re sorry to interrupt.” Trident said, “Well that’s partially a lie.” 

“We’re very happy to interrupt.” SideEffect said as he stepped forward and stared down a body guard that had decided to approach the group, that man chose to back away quickly.

“We...” Trident stepped forward and gestured to those behind him, “...Are Charter Organization and other Heroes group leaders and members that have come to formally and loudly file complaints with the Charter Organization Oversight Committee.” 

“And we can hear those in more formal settings.” Kincaid tried to smile.

“We will voice them here and now, as is our right as citizens.” Vile’Ethiscore stepped forward, “A gift most humans take for granted, I can assure you.” 

“That is not what ‘peaceable assembly’ means.” Kincaid grumbled.

“It does.” SideEffect crossed his arms, “You just gotta live with it.”

“We have had rules changed and twisted on us for years!”  A man dressed in a casino dealer’s uniform shouted, he was Quik Luck, a man who could change the flow of battle in a moment’s notice. “I lead Wyoming’s Charter Group peacefully and righteously, then two months ago, I was told we weren’t monitoring our young heroes properly. Overnight the rules had changed and we’re given no time to adjust and were shut down!”

A woman dressed in a large chemical suit stepped forward and took off her hood, “I am Douser, I used to lead Northern Cali’s Charter Org. We got shut down because we weren't registering younger heroes fast enough. Then several heroes were arrested and detained in secret for helping our home cities!” 

Trident stepped forward and slammed the shaft of his trident into the ground. “We have grievances with you, Senator Kincaid. You and your committee have abused your powers over the heroes of the United States and we will not tolerate it anymore.” 

“So, treason...” Kincaid was about to laugh when a light flashed and multiple “men” in black suits appeared.

The men were obviously GLOBAL robots and as soon as the robots appeared so did three others. One was a man whose body and face were distorted by flares of light, but he wore a dark business suit and carried a cane at his side. The other was a man in a cream and white business suit, his face was covered by a simple balaclava but he had a rifle and a bandolier of multiple odd weapons over his chest. The final man was Dr. Harlan Blackwood standing proudly in his new body, black claws gleaming at the end of his fingers, which now pointed at Senator Arman Kincaid like an executioner's rifle.

“Please do not adjust your TV.” Blackwood smiled at a camera before turning to the obscured man, “Two, we have guests.” 

The man whose body was obscured by light raised an arm and cages of light encased and held every hero and reporter in the room. Several security agents doubled over as beams tore into their bodies. The man’s barely visible face smirked and nodded to the heroes. 

“A captive audience, Three?” Two asked. He motioned and Kincaid was surrounded by bars of light.

“Perfect, I think for this court.” Blackwood nodded. “Shall we set up for our prosecutor?” 

“What is going on?” Kincaid shrieked as he touched a bar of light and flinched back in pain.

“Well, we’re putting a traitor on trial.” Blackwood smiled as he addressed Kincaid, “GLOBAL Chair Number Eight, Arman Kincaid.” 

Kincaid froze as he watched her heroes stop struggling and stare at him. 

“And a message to the heroes of Dross and the world.” Blackwood looked at a camera, “We are prepared to execute any civilian if you approach and any heroes if you breach this trial. This goes double for you Quains out there.” 

“You think he’ll listen.” Trident smacked his trident against the bars and was tossed back.

“Careful, the prideful can never escape those bars.” The man identified as “Two” said in a heavy Irish accent.

“The Father of Pride.” Trident ground his teeth, as he recognized an old enemy, “You should be dead.” 

“Hard to kill what is dead.” The Father grinned behind his “mask” of light, “But it’s good to see you again too. Let’s not make a habit of this, shall we?” 

“Revenant.” Vile watched The Father as he held the bars with ease but quickly let them go. 

The Father of Pride kept his eyes on the Icathian but nodded, “Intelligent lizard.” 

SideEffect smashed his arm into the bars and was sent sailing back and screaming. 

“Someone doesn’t listen.” Blackwood tutted from the stage. “Two, if you could.” He gestured to a projector that the robots were setting up.  

“What do they want?” Douser asked as she helped SideEffect up.

“Kincaid’s clearly one of them.” Trident nodded, “And they said this was a trial.” 

“Will Quain attack?” Another hero asked, “I mean, this is Blackwood. He’ll hold to his threat.” 

Trident didn’t say anything.

“He will wait.” Vile said, “He will watch. He will strike when the opportunity presents itself.” 

SideEffect shook his head, “It’s the kids I’d be concerned about.” He stood up, “And my kid.” 

“Masie won’t attack.” Trident said cautiously, “Anyone here capable of shutting powers down?” 

The gathered heroes shook their heads and mumbled amongst themselves.

“Then we wait.” Vile said as he sat and watched, focusing on silent prayers and meditations,  “We watch.” 

“We strike when we can.” Trident nodded and stood watching the villains that held them captive.

For the members of GLOBAL, the plan was going perfectly, if a bit strained. No one had expected so many heroes to appear. Blackwood counted over forty, most of which were jokes in his eyes, even he was keeping watch over the Icathian with concern now, the bars of light and pride had not cast him back or even harmed him. It was a cause for concern and even Blackwood could tell that from Two’s reaction. 

“What seems to be the issue with our lizardy friend?” Nine asked as he watched Blackwood and Two seemingly hold a silent conversation of glances and nods.

“He is a humble one.” Two explained, “And something protects him.” 

Nine nodded, “I can restrain him.” He held up a pair of darkened metal cuffs, “Titanium cast.” 

“He’ll break them.” Blackwood smiled, “Icathians are startlingly strong on the surface.” 

Nine shook them and they glowed with runes, “Imported from Fawl. Designed to hold those with the strength of giants.” 

Blackwood paused and glanced at Two.  

“If he tries to break out, yes.” The Father said, “Otherwise we could provoke the others.” 

Blackwood then stepped up to Arman Kincaid and grinned at him.

“What are you doing?” Kincaid hissed, “You’re exposing me, Zero w-” 

“Zero’s orders.” Blackwood grinned as his phone beeped. Blackwood laughed as he read the message, “Prosecutor's on his way. You know how theatre majors are.” 

In a flash of smoke and light a new man appeared on the stage, he was wearing a gray suit and a mask of Socrates. He stretched his arms and laughed, then clapped happily. 

“Welcome, Gravitas.” The Father nodded, “We are almost ready.” 

Gravitas turned to the nearest camera. “Hello world. I am Gravitas, villain by your measure. Criminal. Manipulator, murderer even. I am also a Chair for GLOBAL. What is GLOBAL you ask? We are the minds and arms that guide the world from the shadows. We show you the science that works, we give you the technology you crave. GLOBAL is your world.” He extended his arms and stone beings took control of all of the cameras. “And we ask for so little in return, anonymity, some freedom and loyalty.” He turned to Senator Kincaid.

“Ten...” Kincaid growled.

“Something that Senator Arman Kincaid seems to lack in an egregious amount.” Gravitas’ tone became stone cold. “So now we at GLOBAL will try him before the world as our, well let’s call it a release party. Then we will gladly hand him over to your judgement and punishment.” Gravitas stalked toward Kincaid, “We need only wait on our judge.” 

“It’s ready.”  The Father put a thumb drive into the projector.

The image that came through was a stylized Zero over screen meant for technical difficulties from decades prior.  

“Do not adjust your television.” Zero said flatly.

“I knew I should have gone with something different.” Blackwood snapped his fingers playfully.

“I am in control of the vertical. The horizontal.” Zero continued, “I control the depth, width, and yaw of your experience. You will know the power and capabilities of GLOBAL. We are not your enemy unless you make us as such. Now witness the end of those that do.” 

“Zero!” Kincaid snapped, “What is this madness?!” 

“A trial.” Zero said, his screen distorted, “We even have a prosecutor.” 

“That’s me.” Gravitas waved as he shifted form to look like Kincaid’s aid, who was crouching and hidden away. 

“You took Kevin’s shape?” Kincaid stared in confusion. 

“And many more.” Gravitas shifted between multiple forms. “Many people have been making deals with you Senator.” 

“Fuck.” Kincaid blinked.

“Oh...” Gravitas laughed, “You wish. When we’re done, not even the crime families will deal with you.” Gravitas snapped his fingers, “And just to make sure we won’t have any interruptions...”

Every civilian was put into a coffin of stone with a window for their faces to be seen. Gravitas then focused on Kincaid’s aid and put him into the same cage of light that the Senator was in. 

“Co-defendant!” Gravitas laughed, “I’d add more, but we want you both alive.” 

The aid glared at Gravitas and let a low hiss escape his lips as he brushed a bar of light.

“Let Kevin go. Please.” Kincaid pleaded as he watched his aid.

Gravitas paused and looked at the projector, “Zero?” 

A thumbs down appeared on the projector.

“Nope.” Gravitas shook his head, “But I will do this.” He snapped his fingers and Kevin was strapped to a wall with heavy chains. 

Kincaid seemed to relax. “Thank you.” 

“We’ll look into that weirdness later.” Gravitas laughed.

Zero’s projection twisted and warped. Black cats ran across his screen before Zero clearly took back control.  

“Zero?” The Father asked. 

“Sync and some new ‘DigitalMan’ have been attacking me.” Zero said, “We must complete this with haste.” 

Gravitas nodded, “Well then, let’s proceed. Shall we?” 

**---B)(S)(F---**

Alan’s jaw went slack as he watched the madness unfold, only the snapping of the banister above him caused him to look away. Cassandra’s hands had dug into the wood so deeply that she had shattered a section. She was still staring at the TV until Alan levitated to be right in front of her. Cxaltho arched over her head and stared down in anger, a wild look in his eyes that Alan knew all to well.

“Cxaltho, you with us?” Alan asked.

Cxaltho slowly nodded.

“Cassie, you with us?” Alan asked as he reached out and put a hand on her shoulder.

“They keep doing it.” Cassie hissed.

“And we keep getting back up.” Alan said calmly. “You have every right to be pissed off.” 

Cassandra began to sob and Alan stepped onto the floor and hugged her close. 

“They just won’t stop.” Cassie hissed.

“Then neither do we.” Anna said as she climbed up the back of an elongated Hong Long, and joined her father and sister. 

Soon Endara, Agatha and Danny joined them. 

“Stephen.” Alan said with a dry laugh, “Get your nerdy ass in the family hug. You too old man.” 

Daniel then zipped next to his family, Stephen next to him, slightly confused at the sudden change in his location. For a few moments the family held together and then Cassie stopped sobbing. 

“We all need to be ready.” Alan said with a nod as he pulled out of the pile up of his family. “Cassie, if you need to hit something, Bob’s outside like always.” 

“That poor training dummy.” Anna smiled, “I’ll hold him for you.” 

Cassandra nodded.

“Danny, Agatha, go get in your gear.” Alan said, “You too, my lovely.” He smiled at Endara.

“I’ll get into the halter top and cheer outfit then.” Stephen said flatly.

Alan sighed, “That joke never lands you know.” 

“I know, I don’t have the hips for it.” Stephen smirked, “I’ll get the group ready. Jazz is already prepping the chopper.”

“I’ll handle Salem.” Alan nodded. “OId man, car to get us some mercs?”


“I’m sure they’re amenable.” Daniel nodded.

“So what is the plan?” Danny asked.

“We watch and we wait. Someone will make a mistake.” Alan nodded as he walked back to the TV and pulled out his phone and dialed Salem.

“I’m watching.” Salem said over the line, “Got some angles you don’t and some weird ass info.” 

“Like?” Alan asked.

“Keep an eye on that aide. His body temp is low.” Salem said with a growl, “...and he doesn’t strike me as vampiric.”

Alan watched carefully.

Gravitas was reviewing multiple instances of Kincaid’s aides and assistants delivering information to other Senators and even law enforcement agencies. Each time a major GLOBAL operation was brought down. Slowly he even revealed that Skalva was already being investigated by the FBI and Secret Service for eight different types of fraud. Then came a rather disturbing reveal, one that Gravitas changed forms to reveal, he became a tall man with a sparkling smile. Everyone recognized the current Vice President, Mark Charrel, and Gravitas revealed that Charrel was a close friend to Kincaid and had been promised a Chair within GLOBAL once Kincaid had vacated it. The specifics of which involved the elimination of multiple Chair holders, one of which had already been achieved, but someone else outside Arman’s control had been placed in that chair. 

Kincaid’s already normally pale complexion had become transparent. Then Blackwood stepped forward.

“Arman Kincaid, by order of the Chairs of GLOBAL I will be administering a Class Ten amnesiac. Nanites designed to block all memories of GLOBAL and her secrets. You remember Six’s manipulation virus? We adapted it. Not my preferred solution, but I was willing to compromise.” 

Blackwood approached the bars and reached through to grab Kincaid’s arm, the older human tried to resist but Blackwood’s altered and inhuman strength made it trivial for him to wrench the man’s arm out and apply the syringe and the plunger.

“Now.” Zero said with a curled intonation of disdain, “We leave you to the others you have betrayed, with all the evidence they will need to punish you on their end. It is of course, not every crime, but more than enough to leave you ruined and your followers weeping in disdain and fury.” 

Kinciad’s aide, Kevin, snarled as he pulled against the chains Gravitas had applied earlier. Each step seemed to cause an audible snap of the man’s muscles and tear deep into his flesh. 

“So wild.” Gravitas laughed, and gestured a bit to pull the chains tighter.

The man continued to snarl as blood poured from his jaws and eyes. A howl unlike most present had ever heard tore through the building and the Revenant known as the Father of Pride froze in fear as he eyes the now twisting and mutating form that once belonged to a human man.

“Daemon!” The Father bellowed, “We need to be gone! It holds his body!” Then a pause, “Kincaid works with daemons!” 

“I am Mastema. I serve Leviathan. We would have been your allies to sink your enemies into sorrow and devastation!” A twisted voice echoed from Kevin’s body as the head pivoted on its neck to sit the cranium upside down on the spine. Extra arms gouged their way out of the ribs and tore at Kincaids cage, but did not shatter it. 

The Father flinched back and looked at his allies, “We must go!” He vanished in a pillar of light with several GLOBAL robots, Number 9 and Zero’s projector.

“Fascinating alterations of the body.” Blackwood observed as he took a step back from the creature and bowed. “I would be interested in how you acquired new mass, but I know better than to question the supernatural.”

As Blackwood bowed, a whip made of ligaments and muscle scoured his arm and pulled it off at the elbow. Blackwood took a moment to observe the damage and then scowled at the creature before he vanished in a pillar of light. A look born more of resentment, than pain was on his face as he vanished. 

“Well this is our time to go!” Gravitas laughed as he looked at the heroes. “Enjoy your playmate, heroes!” 

Gravitas vanished in another gout of smoke and left the room with the heroes caged and the daemon staring at them hungrily. At the same time the civilians in their coffins were released along with the normal security agents for the event. Mastema grinned as a howl caused most of those present to grab their chests or heads in pain as strange black entities rose from the ground and forced themselves into the people. Some forced themselves into the now dead security agents.

Vile watched as the daemon stepped forward and the ground shook slightly. Then he too stood and stepped forward and placed his palms out to the bars. He recited words he had found in a deep trench, and abandoned temple. The cause of his expulsion from his people. The words were the commands of his twin goddesses for his caste to protect, for his caste to pray, and if need be for his caste to die. The Icathian tongue rang like deep resounding bells in the ears of those around him and dark murky water slowly began to encase the cages, just behind the bars.

“You think your pathetic whores can hold me back, Icathian? They have no power anymore! No one worships them save for a dying and dead race!” Mastema laughed as he swiped his whip against the liquid barrier.

“I can’t move the water...” Trident said as he focused.

“Not yours to move.” Van said as he watched the scene unfold. “We should expect Quain soon.” 

“Very soon.” Trident nodded.

The daemons topped and sniffed the air as the lights dimmed and died. The cameras stopped and electricity stopped moving in the building.

“We have company.” Van noted, “But I can’t detect them.” 

“I smell you.” Mastema cackled as it tried to reach in to grab Van., “Yaweh’s stench is strong.” The upside down head then twisted again, growing an alligator’s jaw from the top of the upside down cranium and forcing the eyes to the chin where they grew like large warts.

“Do not belittle my Lord.” The strong Irish tone of The Wraith’s true voice called from the shadows. “For we are but blades to carve out your cancer.” 

The lights returned and on the closest came to the heroes a lithe woman in a sky blue cloak held a large scythe. With a slash she damaged  the bars and glared at the daemon. On the stage a smaller form was visible pushing an electrical current against Kincaid’s bars, forcing them to spark and sputter out of existence. And right above Mastema were the glaring cyan eyes of the Wraith with the very human face of Maddock O’Donnelly staring down at the daemon.

I needed an actual primeval EVIL. Daemons are those evils. Our sins, our fears, our primal darkness. They exist to consume us.

1i2dcpo,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreditCards/comments/1i2dcpo/precharge_final_charge_alert_feature/,Pre-charge/ final charge alert feature,"This idea has been on my mind for quite some time now:

Why isn’t there a credit card company that offers a notification system that triggers when a final charge amount exceeds a pre-charge amount by a specific percentage? The most common use case for this would be added tip charges. For restaurants for instance, I could set my trigger to 25%, and whenever the final charge is increased by more than that amount, an alert would be sent to my phone.

Another great application for this feature would be to detect dishonest vendors. A few years ago, I had multiple additional charges (different from the sign receipt) ranging from $0.50 to $2.00 in various Brooklyn delis. The only reason I discovered these charges was because I had to submit my expenses, and the receipts didn’t match.

I currently have alerts set up for every single charge on my credit cards, but these alerts don’t catch any of these cases because the amounts are changed later on.

It would be a great addition to this feature to be able to set alert triggers for different types of vendors (e.g., restaurants, coffee shops, delis). Even  a bare minimum feature of a breakdown of the added tip charges on my monthly statement would be a significant improvement.

Did I miss anything? Is anyone aware of a credit card company in the US that offers any of those features? For sure a reason to give them all my business.

I’ll admit it—I was skeptical at first. Another weight loss supplement claiming to transform your body and life? I’ve heard it all before. But as someone desperate for change, I was willing to give it a shot. What happened next? Let me take you on a journey of discovery, one that completely altered my perspective on what’s possible.

My mornings used to be chaos. Between juggling work, family, and an endless to-do list, I found myself constantly fatigued, emotionally drained, and—to put it bluntly—feeling trapped in my own body. No energy, no motivation, no sense of control over my cravings. Every mirror was a reminder of what I hadn’t accomplished.

One random evening, while scrolling through my phone, I stumbled across a supplement. It wasn’t flashy or gimmicky, and its simplicity piqued my interest. The promise? Add a small sachet of tasteless powder to my morning tea, and it would rev up my metabolism, curb cravings, and help me shed those stubborn pounds.

I figured, why not? Worst case, I’d lose nothing but a bit of time.

The first week felt like a small miracle. Each morning, as I stirred the powder into my tea, I noticed something I hadn’t felt in years—energy. Not the jittery kind you get from caffeine overload but a steady, sustained vitality that lasted throughout the day.

But the real magic happened on Day 10. My late-night cravings? Gone. The endless snacking that always sabotaged my progress? A thing of the past. It was as if my body had recalibrated itself, craving nourishing foods instead of sugar-filled quick fixes. For the first time in years, I felt like I was back in the driver’s seat.

**Tea Burn customer testimonials** often speak of fast results, and I experienced it firsthand. By Week 3, my jeans were looser, my face slimmer, and my energy levels through the roof. But it wasn’t just about the physical transformation—there was a deeper change happening. I felt more confident, more present, and ready to tackle life head-on.

I began waking up earlier, hitting my workout goals, and even rediscovering hobbies I’d long abandoned. The supplement became a ritual, not just for its effects but as a symbol of the small yet impactful changes I was making every day.

Friends and family started noticing too. “What’s your secret?” they’d ask, eyes wide. And while I was initially hesitant to share—because let’s face it, the journey felt almost too good to be true—I realized that this wasn’t just about me anymore. It was about inspiring others to believe in their own potential.

This isn’t some fairy tale, and I’m not claiming this product will magically do all the work. But what I will say is that it’s a tool—a powerful one—that can help you create the momentum you need. Whether you’re looking for that extra push to kickstart your weight loss or a way to break free from the cycle of fatigue and frustration, it’s worth giving it a try.

Today, I’m 25 pounds lighter, bursting with energy, and more confident than I’ve been in a decade. My mornings have transformed from chaotic to intentional, and my mindset has shifted in ways I never thought possible. If you’re standing where I once stood—doubting, hoping, yearning for a change—know this: the first step is often the hardest, but it’s also the most rewarding.

Here’s to waking up with purpose, embracing your journey, and proving to yourself that transformation isn’t just possible—it’s inevitable.

**The Science Behind This Life-Changing Supplement**

After experiencing incredible results firsthand, I wanted to understand *why* this simple product worked so well. What’s the secret behind its transformative effects? As it turns out, the power lies in its carefully chosen ingredients and their synergistic impact on the body.

# How It Boosts Your Metabolism

The first thing I learned is that the ingredients in this supplement are specifically designed to supercharge your metabolism, even while you’re at rest. This isn’t some fad diet trick; it’s backed by real science.

Here’s how it works:

* **Green Tea Extract**: Packed with antioxidants like EGCG (epigallocatechin gallate), this powerhouse ingredient has been shown to increase fat burning and improve exercise performance.
* **Green Coffee Bean Extract**: Contains chlorogenic acid, which reduces sugar absorption and stabilizes blood sugar levels, helping to curb those dreaded cravings.
* **L-Carnitine**: Plays a key role in transporting fatty acids into your cells to be burned as energy, rather than being stored as fat.
* **L-Theanine**: Not only does this ingredient promote relaxation and reduce stress, but it also balances out the effects of caffeine, ensuring you feel focused and energized without the jitters.

# Why It Curbs Cravings and Stabilizes Blood Sugar

One of the standout benefits of this product is its ability to put an end to uncontrollable cravings. Here’s what’s working behind the scenes:

1. **Chromium**: This essential mineral improves insulin sensitivity and regulates blood sugar levels, which are critical for preventing those mid-afternoon sugar crashes.
2. **Natural Appetite Suppressants**: Ingredients like L-Theanine help reduce hunger cues, making it easier to stay on track with your eating habits.

**The Role of Antioxidants** Another standout feature of this supplement is its high antioxidant content. These powerful compounds:

* Combat free radicals, reducing oxidative stress in the body.
* Support better digestion and nutrient absorption.
* Promote healthier skin and overall wellness.

# Why It’s Different From Other Supplements

Many weight loss supplements rely on high doses of caffeine or harsh chemicals, which can leave you feeling jittery, anxious, or worse. This product is different. Its carefully balanced formulation ensures that:

* It’s **tasteless** and easy to incorporate into your daily tea or coffee.
* You get **sustained energy** without the crash.
* It supports **whole-body wellness**, not just weight loss.

# How to Use It for Maximum Results

Incorporating this product into your routine is incredibly simple, but consistency is key. Here’s what worked for me:

1. **One Sachet a Day**: Mix one sachet into your morning tea (or coffee) for best results.
2. **Drink It Regularly**: To see sustained benefits, make it a daily habit.
3. **Pair with a Balanced Lifestyle**: While the product does a lot of the heavy lifting, combining it with light exercise and a nutritious diet can amplify your results.

**Final Thoughts on This Life-Changing Journey**

I never imagined that something as simple as adding a tasteless powder to my morning tea could have such a profound impact on my life. But here I am, feeling healthier, more confident, and more energized than ever before. If you’re considering trying it out, my advice is simple: take the leap. You deserve to feel your best, and this could be the key to unlocking the transformation you’ve been searching for.

As they say, the best investment you can make is in yourself. With this product, you’re not just buying a supplement—you’re reclaiming your energy, your confidence, and your life.

**1. What is Tea Burn, and how does it work?**  
Tea Burn is a tasteless powder supplement designed to boost your metabolism, burn fat, curb cravings, and enhance energy levels. You simply mix one sachet into your daily tea or coffee, and its natural ingredients go to work by enhancing fat oxidation, balancing blood sugar levels, and increasing your body’s calorie-burning potential.

**2. Is Tea Burn safe to use?**  
Yes, Tea Burn is made with natural ingredients like green tea extract, green coffee bean extract, L-carnitine, and chromium, all of which are safe for consumption. However, if you’re sensitive to caffeine or have pre-existing medical conditions, consult your healthcare provider before starting.

**3. How quickly will I see results?**  
Results vary based on individual factors like lifestyle and starting weight. Many users, including myself, notice increased energy and reduced cravings within the first week. Visible weight loss often occurs after 2–3 weeks of consistent use.

**4. Does Tea Burn have side effects?**  
Most people experience no side effects. However, individuals sensitive to caffeine may notice mild jitters or restlessness if taken in the afternoon or evening. To avoid this, consume Tea Burn in the morning.

**5. Can I use Tea Burn without dieting or exercising?**  
While Tea Burn helps boost metabolism and burn fat, pairing it with a balanced diet and light exercise will maximize your results. Think of it as a powerful tool in your weight loss journey, not a replacement for healthy habits.

**6. Is Tea Burn suitable for everyone?**  
Tea Burn is suitable for adults looking to lose weight, boost energy, or control cravings. It’s not recommended for children, pregnant or nursing women, or those with serious medical conditions unless approved by a doctor.

**7. How does Tea Burn compare to other weight loss supplements?**  
Unlike other supplements loaded with artificial ingredients or stimulants, Tea Burn focuses on natural, scientifically backed ingredients. It’s tasteless, easy to use, and doesn’t rely on extreme stimulants, making it a more balanced and safer option.

**8. What happens if I miss a day?**  
Missing a day won’t ruin your progress, but for best results, consistency is key. Simply resume your daily intake the next day and keep going.

**9. Where can I buy Tea Burn?**  
Tea Burn is available exclusively online through its official website to ensure product authenticity and quality. Be cautious of imitations from unauthorized sellers.

**10. Is there a money-back guarantee?**  
Yes, Tea Burn offers a money-back guarantee. If you’re not satisfied, you can request a refund within the specified period. This makes trying it risk-free and adds to its credibility.

I share a bit of background about her MildlyNo days before sharing the JN weight loss story. TLDR at the end. 

**BACKGROUND**

My MIL has always exhibited MildlyNO tendencies. She is hypersensitive and plays the victim when I fail to meet her unreasonable expectations for our relationship. I’ll include two brief examples to paint the picture. 

*Pancake Gate*: MIL texted about my pancake preferences for a meal we were having later that day. I responded 4 hours later, still well in advance of the meal. She immediately accused me of being angry, claiming she’d worried all day about what she’d done wrong. When I explained I was just busy, she demanded that, in the future, I either respond immediately or inform her of when I’d be available to respond (you’ll note that that still requires an immediate response, lol). My DH and I explained that I’m not available at her beck and call, and that future requests should go though DH and not me. 

*Mail Gate*: Another time, while heading to a dinner reservation, DH needed to quickly collect mail from his parents’ house. I stayed in the car while he grabbed the mail. But what should have been a 30-second stop became a 5-minute stop because his MIL wanted to show off her new bathroom renovations. THe next day, I received a lengthy text from MIL expressing how hurt she was that I’d evidently rather “play on my phone” than come inside to chat with her. She claimed she had to “distance herself emotionally” from me and that my behaviour didn’t contribute to the happy relationship she desired with me. 

**CURRENT SITUATION**

Recently, MIL crossed firmly into JN territory with a text proposing that she and I compete to lose 10kg (22 lbs) as a “fun” way to motivate her to healthy eating. 

This request was offensive and inappropriate on multiple levels:

1. I have never discussed my health, body, fitness, weight, or food/diet preferences with her or in her presence. 
2. Because she is a MildlyNo, we do not have a close enough relationship for her to ask something that personal from me. 
3. While I could healthily lose 5-10lbs at most, losing 22 lbs would be extreme and harmful for me. 

When I told her this request was inappropriate, she responded with “wow, okay” and unleashed a laundry list of grievances she has, including a list of supposed “rules” I’ve imposed: no hugging when greeting, no reading the same book at her, no watching TV with her while DH is at work (we do not live together), no grabbing coffee together. She also accused me of hating her, and expressed a desire for an open, honest, and caring relationship.

These “rules” are her interpretation of the one time I declined each of the listed invitations. For instance, I once explained that I’m not a hugger and don’t even hug my own family, so I’m not keen to hug her every time I see her. Notably, she doesn’t even hug her own son when they visit, yet she takes offence that I don’t want to hug her. I’ve also told her that I don’t read recreationally, so I haven’t yet read the book she gave me for my birthday. Apparently, that means that I have a rule that I refuse to read the same books as her. 

DH attempted to arrange a meeting between the 3 of us to discuss these issues (she wanted FIL excluded because she didn’t want him to know what she had said or done). Unfortunately, MIL opted to cancel the meeting last minute, claiming she needed to “guard her heart” and she wasn’t up for “facing the music”. She hoped our hearts would heal and that we’d forgive her thoughtlessness, which she blamed on a migraine and the lack of ADD drugs. 

I said that I would be taking a break from this relationship and offered April as the next opportunity to discuss. Her response? She “doesn’t know how to fix this”. (The solution being obvious enough: meet and have the open, honest discussion she claims to want). 

MIL clearly desires a one-on-one friendship, but we lack the common ground for such a relationship. Our interests, values, and experiences don’t align, and our personalities clash. I find every interaction with her exhausting and draining. 

Moving forward, I need to clearly communicate that our relationship exists through DH, and our interactions will be limited to family events where he’s also present. 

I don’t think I need any advice at this time, but hearing about your similar experiences would be therapeutic!  


**TLDR:** My hypersensitive MIL became a JN by proposing an inappropriate weight loss competition and then playing the victim when I rejected her suggestion. Her persistent attempts to create an intimate friendship I neither want nor can sustain have made it clear that our relationship must be strictly managed through my husband and limited to necessary family interactions.

1i2d3zi,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i2d3zi,Anarchy Labs Ronin,"# Anarchy Labs Ronin

### Background
Alright, so I’m probably one of the biggest Apollon haters out there.  I figured I’d give the new Anarchy line a fair shake and picked up a couple of samples of Ronin to try.  Fresh start to 2025 and all that.

Shout out to u/RuescoSupplements for all the hard work he puts in to make these sample packs available to us!  

### Label (4/5)
Unfortunately I don’t have a tub in hand, but I’ve always been a fan of Apollon’s artwork.  From what I see online, this one looks fantastic.  A demonic samurai amidst hellfire.  What the fuck else could be better on a hardcore pre workout?

As with previous Apollon products this is a monster of a label.  Insane doses of caffeine (700mg from a multi-stage blend!) eria and PEA.  On top of those we get moderately high doses of synephrine and a-yo.  The nootropic blend is absolutely stacked as well with hefty portions of Noopept, tyrosine and alpha-gpc.  All bases covered.

What’s lacking here are pump and endurance ingredients.  I would really like to see some citrulline at a minimum.  We do get solid amounts of beta alanine and betaine, which is nice.  That makes it easier to stack with a pure pump product like Compound Pump (my current favorite).

At this point I’m hyped for Ronin.  I expect to be sweating, shaking and damn near manic when this boy comes in.

### Cost (3/5)
I bought this one as a sample from Ruesco.  It looks like you could pick it up on sale for around $45, or $2.25 “per the go.”  So about average.

### Taste/Mixability (3/5)
I have Pineapple Passion Fruit Coconut flavor.  This is a massive improvement over the typical Apollon pre.  It’s still not good by any stretch, but it’s not a job to get down like Timecop or Assassin.  The pineapple and coconut flavors are there briefly, before abandoning you to a mild metallic aftertaste.  Easy enough to drink and certainly better than El Jefe.  Mixability is very good, which is expected with a stim focused blend.  

### Effects (1/5)
Fucking rug pulled again by another shitty Apollon product.

I felt zero beta tingles.  Some moderate stimulation after about an hour.  No elevated heart rate.  Ain’t no way there’s 700mg of caffeine in this.  No more stim than a cup of coffee.  No sweats and no sniffles tell me no a-yo either.

I did get a little bit of a nootropic head high and mood elevation.  Focus was very good.  I think the Noopept and eria might actually be in there. 

Regardless of my disappointment, I still pushed through my heavy rack pulls.  I hit the same reps as last week, but those last few were a damn grind.

Pumps were non-existent.  No appetite suppression.  A nasty crash hit about four hours after the workout and I was struggling to stay awake at work.

### Overall (1/5)
More overhyped trash from Apollon.  This one isn’t even in the same league as the Tweak I crapped on last week.  Panda Products hit harder.",0,1736989778.0,Preworkoutsupplements,2,0.5,False

Let me start by saying that I have talked with the admin and confirmed that this post was allowed in the community!

My wife and I recently launched our online coffee roastery, Bean There, Brewed That. We are located in Parker and roast at a roaster-share facility in Denver. We specialize in light to medium roast beans and have four in our rotation with plans to adapt to new ones in the coming months. We are doing this as a side business behind our day-to-day jobs, but the goal is eventually moving towards a storefront location. One of the most significant downsides of being strictly online is the inability to connect with the community surrounding our coffee and overall business goal. We had a successful launch this year on the first, but we want to connect more with the community and get feedback from the customers themselves.

We have ideas to market our company to local businesses and join a farmers market, but we would like to reach this community and learn what you, the consumers, want to see from us. Are there event places you would like to see us at? A place where we can serve our coffee for you to try before committing to a bag? Are there other businesses you believe would want to work with a small coffee roastery? We want your direct feedback to determine how the community wants our engagement! If anyone wants to supply feedback that they would personally want to see from a small business coffee roastery, we are all ears to find ways to give the community what they want.

I greatly appreciate you all for this, as connecting with the community will help us eventually open a storefront and see our customers face-to-face. For our pet-loving readers, you may like to know all of our coffees are being named after our pets with a goal of naming all of our coffees after our loving friends in the community. Our eventual goal is to run a coffee shop pet rescue when we get our store front.

1i2cqoc,https://www.reddit.com/r/fiction/comments/1i2cqoc/warm_justice/,Warm Justice ,"Roger opened his eyes groggily. He stared at the ceiling for a moment before smiling. It was the weekend; finally, he had the day off. He got up in his pajamas and slipped on his slippers to make himself a cup of coffee. After brewing it, he couldn't think of anywhere better than his porch to enjoy the crisp spring morning air.

It was a beautiful day outside—the air was fresh, the birds were singing, and the sun was just peeking over the horizon with not a cloud in sight. He sat down and took a deep breath. Then another. And another. Something was... wrong. What was that pungent smell?

He set his coffee mug on the nearby table and got up to investigate. Walking off the porch, he headed toward his new pool. It was a bit extravagant, he knew, but after getting a promotion at work, he'd decided to treat himself. Last summer, he built the pool. But when he looked down at the water, it wasn't the beautiful, clean pool he'd known.

No. It was... yellow? How could it be? The smell was so bad it was almost unbearable! Someone—or multiple people, hundreds, even—must have done this. But who? Who had he wronged so badly that they would orchestrate this? He had to find out who had ruined his beautiful pool.

Frustrated, he sighed and went back inside with his coffee, away from the horrible smell. He sat at the small kitchen table with some fried eggs and bacon, thinking about people he might have wronged. Tammy from the third grade? Evan, his coworker, whose desk he'd accidentally spilled coffee on? Or Cindy, who he had to assign extra work to, leading to her termination? No, it couldn't be them. Only one person came to mind.

He picked up the phone and asked the operator to route him. The phone rang for a while before a female voice came through.

""Hello? Who is this? And why are you calling me so early?"" the irritated voice on the other end asked.

""It's me,"" Roger said. Silence followed. For a moment, he thought the line had been disconnected.

""What do you want, Roger? You got the house, the money, and the new car. What do you want now? The kids?""

""Maybe I will after the bullshit you pulled!""

""What are you talking about now?""

""You know what you did!""

""No, I do NOT.""

""Then who got at least 100 guys to piss in my pool, huh?!""

""What? You called about, WHAT!?""

""Come on, Jane! You're the only one with that many friends and the gall to do it!""

""No, I did not, Roger. Leave me alone.""

The line went dead. Roger slammed the receiver back onto the cradle. His only lead was gone. He had no other ideas—except one. He picked up the phone again and called his friend, Franklin.

He left the house and got into his car. He was headed to a friend's place on the other side of town. He sat down in his brand-new Dodge Royal and started the car. It started right up. He quickly put it in gear and pulled away. On the way, he tried his best to recollect the last couple of days.

When he arrived, his old friend Franklin was sitting in the yard in a lawn chair. He was sipping a beer, enjoying his recent retirement from the force. Once a great investigator, Frank had decided to retire early after a recent case almost ended badly for him. Roger pulled up into the driveway of Frank's new home, which he had bought shortly after his early retirement.

""Hey, Frank!"" Roger greeted his old friend warmly.

""Hey, Roger! What do you think of the new house?""

""It's nice, Frank,"" said Roger. It was a very nice house, but Roger wasn't really paying attention. His mind was occupied with other things.

""Want a beer?""

""Sure.""

Frank got up and came back with another lawn chair and a couple of beers.

""So, Roger, you said you needed some advice about something you wanted to talk about in person.""

""Yes. Uh, well, I don't know how to say this, but someone—well, not just one, but multiple... Hundreds of people—have peed in my pool.""

Frank looked at Roger in amazement and disbelief for a moment.

""So, you're telling me that hundreds of people broke into your backyard... to pee in your pool?""

""I know it's ridiculous, but... Come on, let me just show you.""

Roger got up, and Frank followed him as they both got into the car and drove to Roger's house. Roger mechanically unlocked the door, stepped out onto the porch, and walked down to the pool. Frank just looked at the yellow pool in disbelief.

Frank began stumbling over his words: ""Wh—Ho—, Who. What, How, Who, When, And most importantly... WHY?""

Roger just looked at him, shaking his head. ""I don't know... Will you help me, Frank?""

Frank nodded his head. ""Especially for a friend, of course.""

Frank decided to activate his investigator mode. ""So, what were you doing the night before you came home and woke up to... this?""

""Well,"" Roger started, ""I went out to the new tiki bar that opened by the beach. I met a nice girl named Janet. We sat at the bar and talked for hours. It was really nice. It was a beautiful night.""

Frank interjected, ""Was she with anyone else?""

""Not that I know of.""

""Okay, continue.""

""Around midnight, I left the bar. I walked, not too far from home, so I didn't drive there. Then I got inside the house and collapsed on the bed. I was hammered.""

Frank nodded, thinking through what Roger had just told him. ""Okay. This morning, when you walked down your porch, did you investigate any further?""

Roger looked embarrassed for a moment, then said, ""No, I immediately went inside. I thought it had to be Jane.""

Frank looked at him, then said, ""Roger, there is no possible way she did this.""

Roger nodded his head. ""Okay, let's start the investigation.""

They looked around the yard for the next half hour. They found no evidence of a break-in. Nothing in the garden shed. They found one beer can: Marty Waterhouse Lite Beer. Roger and Frank sat defeated inside, looking at the single empty beer can, before Roger came up with the single craziest idea he had ever thought of.

""The Waterhouse Brewery headquarters is in town,"" Roger said.

Frank nodded along, encouraging Roger to continue.

""What if we get the serial number off this beer can, trace it to who bought it, and track down who did this?""

Frank looked at him for a moment, the gears in his head turning. ""Yes, it's a long shot, but it's possible. I have some contacts at headquarters who owe me favors. Let's go!""

Frank quickly got up and dragged Roger out the door. Frank decided he should drive, as Roger had never been to the headquarters.

The bright red Dodge Royal, with its white accents, pulled into the parking lot of the imposingly tall brewery headquarters. It wasn't out of place with the other luxury vehicles driven by company executives. What was out of place were the two disheveled men who climbed out.

Roger looked up at the tallest building in Whitefront, California. The small town had been booming the last few years as people flocked to the coast. The beer company, Waterhouse, and its CEO and founder had decided it was best to move their headquarters from the East Coast to California because of the growing market. To cut costs, they chose a small town, and ever since, the town had flourished.

Roger had never been here before. He worked at a small but lucrative law office. It was clear the town's success was largely due to this company.

They entered the reception area and spoke to the receptionist.

""Hey, I'm here to talk to Gordon. Tell him Frank is asking for him.""

The receptionist nodded. ""Ok, I'll let Mr. Gordon know before I leave. My shift is ending."" She got up from her desk and briskly walked out the back door. That's when someone Roger never wanted to see again entered to replace her.

""Roger! Why in the hell are you here?"" Roger's ex-wife, Jane, burst out.

Roger decided to briskly walk to the elevator with Frank, ignoring his ex-wife.

""Roger, you better get your ass—""

The elevator doors quickly closed, cutting off what she was about to say. Frank leaned over, clicking the fourth floor. Relaxing music played in the background as they ascended. He couldn't make out all the lyrics, but something about a beautiful night for a party echoed softly.

The elevator quickly closed, cutting off what she was about to say. Frank leaned over, clicking the button for the 4th floor. Relaxing music played in the background as they ascended. He couldn't catch all the lyrics, but it was something about a beautiful night for a party.

The elevator dinged, and the doors opened. Frank led Roger down the hall until they came to a door with Gordon's nameplate. They knocked.

""Come in!""

The door opened to a large, spacious office with floor-to-ceiling windows. Gordon, to Roger's surprise, was a young Black man with a wide, welcoming smile.

""Frank! Nice to see you, my old friend. And...?""

""Roger,"" he said curtly. Gordon's smile dimmed slightly at Roger's tone. Turning back to Frank, Gordon said, ""I heard about your retirement! Congratulations! Speaking of that, we still need to plan the retirement party—""

""I'm here on business, Gordon,"" Frank interrupted quickly.

""Aren't you retired?""

""I am. This is personal. I need to help my friend Roger here with a case.""

Gordon nodded. ""So, you need my help?""

""Yes,"" Frank responded.

""What do you need?"" Gordon asked.

Frank set a crumpled beer can on the desk.

""A beer can?"" Gordon said, confused.

""I need you to trace the serial number of this beer can to where it was sold. We suspect our suspect purchased this beer.""

Gordon nodded, then shuffled through papers and opened several filing cabinets before shaking his head.

""Nope, not here. It's probably in Quality Assurance. We keep the serial numbers in case we have to withdraw a product from shelves—makes it easier to know what was affected.""

Frank sighed in disappointment, but Gordon spoke up again.

""But I do have access.""

Gordon led Roger and Frank through the hallway into a large room with many cubicles. People typed away on typewriters. Roger observed Gordon, contemplating how, despite looking down on him, the man was still helping him. Strange.

Finally, they arrived at a locked door. Gordon pulled out a key and unlocked it. Inside were rows upon rows of filing cabinets. Frank sighed.

""This is going to take hours, isn't it?""

And it did. Hours passed as they sifted through files.

""This is taking forever!"" Roger complained.

""I found it!"" Gordon yelled out.

It was exactly what they where looking for. 04/11/54—all the beer made that day and delivered that night. Skimming the files, they found the serial number they sought: C308.

Inside the file was a simple message, only three words long, that crushed the investigation instantly: ""Lost in Shipping.""

Roger almost wanted to cry. He had spent his entire Saturday chasing a lead that ultimately led nowhere. As they left, Frank turned to Gordon.

""Thanks again, man. Sorry to waste your time.""

Gordon nodded. Roger, feeling the need to show some gratitude, said, ""Thank you."" Gordon nodded again, understanding in his eyes.

The office was emptying as they walked through the cubicles, everyone heading home for the day. They took the elevator down.

""Damn it, Roger!""

They were immediately greeted by Jane as they stepped off the elevator. ""What were you doing up there all day, huh? Getting a lawyer to squeeze more out of the divorce? Buying another extravagant beer keg for your house?""

Roger just looked at her in exhaustion and defeat, shaking his head.

""Leave him alone, Jane; he's been through a lot today,"" Frank said earnestly.

""Leave him alone?! Leave him alone?! Oh boy, don't you have a lot of nerve. You're lucky we're in PUBLIC! I would cuss you out right now! He didn't leave me alone this morning, he didn't leave me alone during the divorce, he didn't even leave me alone when we were married! NO! I will not leave him alone.""

She kept going on and on as Frank dragged Roger back to the car. Roger insisted on driving.

""I need more than just a beer—something stronger,"" Roger said before starting the car and driving off.

""Where are we going?"" Frank asked.

""To the tiki bar.""

By the time they arrived, the bar was already starting to fill up. Frank and Roger went inside and sat down. Roger turned to Frank. ""Drinks are on me tonight for all the work we did today. How about a margarita?""

Frank looked at him and said, ""I've never had one.""

Roger looked at Frank in amazement. ""Never had one? They're great! Two margaritas, please.""

That's when a familiar face came into view. Janet from last night came up and sat next to them.

""Hi, Roger, nice to see you again.""

""Hey, Janet.""

""Is something wrong?""

Frank turned to her and said, ""He's down today. Someone... vandalized his pool.""

Janet turned back to Roger. ""Is there anything else I can do to help?""

Frank spoke up for Roger. ""Yes, there is. Roger said you weren't with anyone, as far as he knew, but if you were, they could have been the ones who did this.""

Janet nodded, thinking for a moment, before saying, ""I had a date with some guy named Mark, I think? No, wait..."" Janet thought for a moment. ""Max? No..."" Finally, she spoke up. ""Marty... some Marty Water... Horse?""

Frank looked at her, wide-eyed. ""Waterhouse?!""

Janet looked at him for a moment. ""Yes! That was it!""

Roger stared at her in amazement. ""So, you're telling me you ditched a rich millionaire beer tycoon to go on a date with me and didn't even remember his name?!""

Janet nodded. ""You were cute; he wasn't. I got super drunk.""

Roger abruptly got up and started walking toward the door.

""Roger! What about the margaritas?!"" Frank called after him.

""Put it on my tab! I need my Warm Justice!"" Roger replied.

""Roger, don't do this,"" said Frank, not chasing him.

""Roger, Marty is a dangerous man. He's the reason I retired! He and his men almost killed me!"" Frank desperately called out, but Roger wasn't listening.

""Who's going to take me home?!"" Frank said more to himself than to Roger. He was long gone.

Frank sighed. Maybe Janet would take him home. He walked back in the bar to finish the margaritas that roger bought.

Roger was speeding down the road, bee-lining it straight to Marty's house. He lived in the new wealthy neighborhood being built on the west side of town near the beach. He was doing well over the speed limit, and no stoplight or stop sign would stop him. He was getting angrier and angrier. Marty had no right—no right at all—to do that. Roger didn't even know he was there. Instead of acting like a child, Marty could have just spoken up about how Roger had stolen his date. But did he do that? No. He went out of his way to recruit an army of men to piss in Roger's brand-new pool.

By the time Roger pulled into the driveway of the mansion, he was furious. He saw that Waterhouse had one of those fancy electronic gates with a code. Of course, the flimsy gate was no match for Roger ramming it with his car at 65 MPH. The gates broke instantly, surprisingly causing minimal damage to the car.

Roger sat in the car for a moment, ""To late to second guess yourself now Roger,"" He said to himself.

Roger slammed on the brakes, got out, and marched his way up to the door, holding a big lug wrench as his weapon. The door was far too sturdy for him to get through, but luckily for Roger, glass isn't as strong. He smashed the window in with the wrench before climbing inside, disregarding the glass shards that could have cut him if he weren't careful.

""WATERHOUSE! I'M HERE, ASSHOLE! COME ON OUT AND FIGHT ME!""

That's when, unexpectedly, a bottle smashed into Roger's face. Glass shards and beer went everywhere. It was a ball of fury and hate. The men fought wildly, clearly never having been in many physical fights. They tried every dirty move they could think of to get the upper hand. Eventually, Roger got the upper hand and threw Waterhouse outside into the mud before throwing himself on top of him.

They fought in the mud, blood, and beer. Punch after punch, Roger sent directly into Marty's face. Over and over again, until he paused. He looked up. Surrounding him were 300 men, all staring at Roger with bitter hatred.

Acting fast, Roger climbed back through the broken window. The way to the door was blocked by Gordon.

""I Forged that missing shipping document for a reason, damn it, Roger!""

Roger shook his head in amazement. ""Gordon!?""

Gordon started walking toward Roger. ""You just couldn't stay away, could you?""

Thinking fast, Roger hit Gordon over the head with the wrench. Before Gordon could regain his composure, Roger ran behind him to the front door. Locked. Gordon was already getting up, ready to lunge forward to grab Roger. That's when Roger saw it: the pull string to open the stairs to the attic.

He quickly pulled it down before scrambling up the stairs. Once inside, he pulled it back up behind him. He looked around eagerly for an escape. There was a window big enough to jump out of into the pool in the front yard.

Roger smashed the window with his wrench before quickly jumping out, diving into the pool. He quickly surfaced and scrambled out. He ran to his car and started it. The engine roared as reliably as ever. Roger quickly shifted into gear and took off.

He thought he was safe until he saw a pair of headlights. Then another. Car after car joined the chase. He sped up, slowed down, and went around and around the twisting hills, trying to get away from them. Eventually, he made it back into town, driving wildly through the empty streets. That's when—BOOM—the front tire suddenly burst on his Dodge. The car swerved, sending him into a light pole.

""Damn it, Roger! Are you drinking and driving again?!"" said an irritated voice.

In amazement, Roger realized he had just so happened to crash his car right in front of Jane. Before he could second-guess himself, he said, ""Get in the car!""

""Are you crazy, Roger? If not, you're drunk. The front tire popped! You need to change it, then you need to pay for the damn light pole you nearly snapped in half!""

Roger nervously glanced in the rearview mirror as headlights started shining on the far wall. ""Trust me, this one damn time, Jane—get in the car, or we both die!""

""Roger, shut up! You never listened to me. Why should I listen to you now? I didn't want the divorce, but you insisted, despite the fact that you were the one who cheated. And you know what? Thank you, Roger! It was the best decision of your life!""

Roger thought back to it and suddenly realized—she was right.

He had been a terrible husband, father, and person, and did not deserve a thing he owned. Roger sighed before looking up at Jane and, in earnest, said, ""You're right. I was a horrible husband and an even worse father to our children. I deserved every word and more—much more than what you've said. And I am so, so sorry. But Jane, I'm telling you right now—please believe me—we WILL BE DEAD in less than 30 seconds unless you get in this damn car right now!""

Jane looked down in amazement at Roger for a moment before actually opening the passenger door and getting in. ""You better be right.""

With that, Roger attempted to restart the car. The starter whirled. He clearly heard some fluid leaking from the car, and the hum of the engine got closer and closer as the first Chevy Impala started pulling into view.

Jane screamed in horror. Then the engine coughed, sputtered, and roared to life. Roger quickly threw the car in reverse and slammed on the gas. The car peeled out, now driving backward as it was chased.

""You know that trick with the handbrake to do a 180-degree turn like in the movies?""

""Roger, are you crazy?!""

""Maybe.""

Roger sharply turned the wheel, pulled the handbrake, popped the clutch, and shifted into gear before peeling away. ""There is no way I just did that!""

Roger navigated the streets swiftly and effectively until he turned off onto the street to exit town. There he saw the line of Oldsmobiles, with Marty Waterhouse standing in front of them, pointing a .44 revolver right at them.

Immediately, shots started being fired.

""Jane, get down!""

Both ducked under the dash. Roger sent the car careening straight into the blockade. CRASH. The sounds of twisted metal and breaking glass filled the air, along with more gunshots. Miraculously, Roger and Jane were unharmed.

They sat back up. Roger smiled at Jane. ""We did it!""

That's when the engine started sputtering. It coughed once, then twice, and then died. They were only a few hundred feet away.

Roger and Jane quickly got out and started running. BANG. The .44 went off.

""You better stop, you two, before you get shot,"" said Marty Waterhouse, now with severe damage—two black eyes, a broken nose that was bleeding, and several missing teeth.

""You've got yourself a little accomplice now, huh, Roger?""

Marty started walking toward them, the gun in his hand gleaming under the dim streetlights. The subtle tap, tap, tap of his footsteps echoed as he approached.

""You can't get away with this! They'll find us and trace it back to you!"" Roger spat out in desperation.

""I own this town, Roger. I have every dirty cop, the city council, and even the mayor under my thumb. This is easy, Roger.""

""You can't do this, Marty! How will you explain us going missing? The town just can't ignore it!"" Jane yelled.

""You're right, they can't. That's why I've planned how you'll die. I thought about pulling out your teeth one by one, then beating you to death. But honestly, I just want you gone. That's when it hit me—it's so simple. The newspapers will say, ""Local Man goes insane after someone peed in is pool, kills Ex-Wife in revenge""

Jane gasped in horror. Roger just stared at Marty, expressionless.

""Get the sacks, boys!""

Suddenly, a few of Marty's men came up behind Jane and Roger. They were shoved into burlap sacks and thrown into the trunk of Marty's car. Roger started hyperventilating. The darkness and tight confines of the bag were suffocating. He clawed at the fabric, desperate to escape, when a knife suddenly pierced through the material, cutting it open.

Above him was Jane, holding a pocket knife. ""Damn it, Roger, stop squirming. I might accidentally cut you,"" she whispered.

Eventually, she cut him fully free from the bag. The trunk was surprisingly spacious, allowing both of them to kneel.

""Okay, we need to get the hell out of here,"" Jane said urgently.

Roger nodded in agreement. Jane pulled out a multi-tool from her other pocket, using the toothpick attachment to work on the locking mechanism.

The lock soon popped open.

""Okay, Roger, we need to wait until the car stops—hopefully at a stoplight—so we can slip out and get away, okay?""

Roger didn't have time to respond before the car came to a halt.

""Now!"" she whispered urgently.

Roger quickly scrambled out of the cramped space and helped Jane out. That's when Roger noticed their stopping point: they were at his backyard. It was too late.

""Good job, you two,"" said a voice behind them.

They whipped around to see Marty Waterhouse walking toward them.

""You actually made my job easier—I don't even have to drag you out of the bags,"" he said, smiling menacingly, his gun glinting in the soft moonlight. Behind him, the pool glowed a faint, sickly yellow.

Marty cocked the hammer of the revolver. ""Any last words, Roger?""

""behind you!"" Roger shouted.

Marty whipped around, falling for the trick. He instantly realized his mistake when Roger's fist connected directly with his face. Roger tried to wrestle the gun away. Jane Tried to help but quickly was thrown off by Marty.

That's when Waterhouse gained the upper hand. He jabbed Roger in the stomach with his elbow, pushing him back. Roger doubled over in pain.

""I'll kill your ex-wife first, then!""

Before Marty could say anything else, an old black Oldsmobile smashed through Roger's back fence. Its siren blared as the car skidded to a halt.

Frank threw himself out of his car, his trusty service pistol in hand.

""Get on the ground, Waterhouse! You're under arrest!""

Marty put his hands up, knowing he was defeated. ""You were the only one I couldn't pay off,"" he said.

He threw the revolver forward, causing it to discharge and hit Frank in the foot. Frank cursed several times before walking over to Waterhouse and handcuffing him. Soon, the rest of the force arrived on the scene.

Roger was still stunned by the events when he turned to Jane.

""Roger!"" Jane cried.

She seemed to have just processed what had almost happened and threw her arms around him, sobbing into his shoulder.

""Roger, we almost died! We almost died! What would've happened if I hadn't—""

Roger cut her off. ""Don't think about that. We're safe. We're safe now.""

He held her in his arms for a long moment as the arrests continued in his backyard. She turned her face up to him, tears still shining in her eyes. He looked down at her, and in that moment, she was the most beautiful woman in the world.

""I sure did get revenge on the son of a bitch who peed in my pool didnt I?""

Jane laughed at the absurdity of it all.

He leaned in and kissed her.

And so, on that day, 300 men were arrested, marking the largest arrest in California history. Gordon and Waterhouse were charged with multiple crimes, including Bribery, forged documents, tax evasion, and mass vandalism.

Frank only came because of Janet bugged him to after Roger left and waited for Roger to come back. When Marty showed up instead he knew what to do. After this continued to enjoy his retirement, occasionally helping with small cases. Janet and Frank got married a couple of years later. Tammy, from Roger's third-grade class, took over the beer company and continued steering it toward success.

And Roger? He and Jane remarried that year and lived happily together, building a much healthier relationship. In the end, Roger's pool vandalism was covered by his homeowner's insurance, making the entire ordeal a petty tale of revenge gone awry. But hey, at least he brought down an entire crime ring and rekindled his relationship with his Ex-Wife right?",0,1736988670.0,fiction,0,0.5,False

some time ago I (at the time 14F) had a private tutor (50 - something M) and we had a pretty good student - teacher relationship. I did well in studies and he'd give me advice on academic and non-academic stuff I thoroughly enjoyed our lessons.  he was likeable, kind, funny, a ""mentor"". then we started getting closer and it just didn't seem to reach a limit. stuff that happened gradually: 

  
\- good morning emails everyday , then exchanging songs, many of which were romantic 

\- for one of those songs he sent a lengthy explanation about what it meant to him, the whole message was either implying he loved me or that I loved him. idk  

\- lesson length increased and he never charged more 

\- he complimented me a lot, on personality, appearance, basically who I was 

\- long, ""deep"" conversations on family, love, relationships, sex and psychology 

\- he got me a cake / gift on my 15th birthday. we were alone in the library room so he asked to sing happy birthday, which I thought was weird so I told him not to, he kept insisting until I let him 

\- he had a rubberband of mine one time he said he'd wear it sometimes because it made him think of me  

\- he joked (I think it was a joke) once when i was 17 we'd get drinks together, when I brought it up on another occasion he said he wasn't crazy, we'd only do it at 18 

\- he had another student (she was 18 but he'd known her since she was 13) who he was ""close"" with, he made a graduation slideshow of her and showed it to me, saying he was so glad that I wasn't jealous . he talked about her and her mom a lot (no clue what shit was going on there lmao)

\- almost every sexual conversation was initiated by him unless it was a question I had (these honestly were not necessary conversations) .

\- we went for walks / got coffee alone after our lesson sometimes, but he said he did that with a lot of his students

theres so much more but theres no point in listing it all. was I groomed or was this just an extremely immature man lacking any sense of boundaries? I never stopped him from saying anything he did. the situation only ended because my family felt the whole thing was weird and they had a bad gut feeling. I got that feeling sometimes, but it was always squashed away by the thought of who he was. I don't know what to think or feel  ",3,1736988437.0,groomingvictim,2,1.0,False

My fiance has lived mostly in the south, but she also lived in New Zealand for 10 years before coming back to the states.

I earn 200k full remote and my fiance is back in school and not making much right now, but she will probably pull in ~60k or so after she graduates and goes back to full time.

We have no kids and no plans to, just a couple dogs. I love the coast and the seafood and lifestyle that comes with it, and really want to be within a couple hours max of the coast. Ideally, I think we want a mid-sized city, but open to smaller towns and larger cities as well. Bike friendly, close to nature, mostly liberal politics, lots of craft breweries, a decent amount of things to do, etc., is our jam. If we can live in a walkable neighborhood but also have a house and a yard, that would seriously be the dream. At least walkable to a local watering hole, coffee shop, etc. An absolute must needs to be mostly mild summers. I don't mind the heat as much, but my fiance hates it.

West coast move to PNW would make sense, I've lived there before and can handle the cold and rain. Seattle area, Portland, Bellingham are where we've been considering the most so far. However, besides my short stint in Maine, I don’t have a whole lot of east coast experience. Are there any gems out there we should be considering? Any other west coast options we should look at?

1i2clih,https://i.redd.it/xf678bdv59de1.jpeg,Spirit keeping ,"Have you heard the term #spiritkeeping before? Many consider it trivial as “genie parenting”. However, The Art of Spirit Keeping is a profound science. Every #spirit has its own unique role in the human world.
we have two main components: Man and Spirit. We, as Keepers, are bound with Spirit through the bind process, through the Vessel, the personal spirit portal.
Vessel is the spiritual house that the conjurer created for the spirit. It’s not just a place, it’s also an energy tower. With the right materials and energy, spirit can manifest realistically, from touch to aroma.
Spirit wants to help because of karma and reciprocal relationships. They are not maids, but best friends.
Therefore, a strong relationship between the Keeper and Spirit is important. The stronger, the more effective the spirit performs.
Like a friend, the more we pay attention to him, the better he is to us. That’s why offering for spirit, or sajen, is very important in bonding. Each spirit has its own offering negotiation.
And obviously, spirits are not to be worshipped. The condition is similar to a security guard. You are guarded, given coffee and salary, but you do not worship the security guard, right?

I recently started drinking coffee every day regardless because a recent study showed youre 30% less likely to suffer from heart disease if you consume coffee every morning. I started this 5 days ago and have not felt a PVC in a couple days. Maybe its due to the fact that caffeine speeds up digestion slightly. Im not sure but coffee every morning has seemed to have had an effect. Could be the placebo effect who knows but if your PVCs are caused by your digestive system and youre avoiding caffeine it might be worth trying it.

Roger opened his eyes groggily. He stared at the ceiling for a moment before smiling. It was the weekend; finally, he had the day off. He got up in his pajamas and slipped on his slippers to make himself a cup of coffee. After brewing it, he couldn't think of anywhere better than his porch to enjoy the crisp spring morning air.

It was a beautiful day outside—the air was fresh, the birds were singing, and the sun was just peeking over the horizon with not a cloud in sight. He sat down and took a deep breath. Then another. And another. Something was... wrong. What was that pungent smell?

He set his coffee mug on the nearby table and got up to investigate. Walking off the porch, he headed toward his new pool. It was a bit extravagant, he knew, but after getting a promotion at work, he'd decided to treat himself. Last summer, he built the pool. But when he looked down at the water, it wasn't the beautiful, clean pool he'd known.

No. It was... yellow? How could it be? The smell was so bad it was almost unbearable! Someone—or multiple people, hundreds, even—must have done this. But who? Who had he wronged so badly that they would orchestrate this? He had to find out who had ruined his beautiful pool.

Frustrated, he sighed and went back inside with his coffee, away from the horrible smell. He sat at the small kitchen table with some fried eggs and bacon, thinking about people he might have wronged. Tammy from the third grade? Evan, his coworker, whose desk he'd accidentally spilled coffee on? Or Cindy, who he had to assign extra work to, leading to her termination? No, it couldn't be them. Only one person came to mind.

He picked up the phone and asked the operator to route him. The phone rang for a while before a female voice came through.

""Hello? Who is this? And why are you calling me so early?"" the irritated voice on the other end asked.

""It's me,"" Roger said. Silence followed. For a moment, he thought the line had been disconnected.

""What do you want, Roger? You got the house, the money, and the new car. What do you want now? The kids?""

""Maybe I will after the bullshit you pulled!""

""What are you talking about now?""

""You know what you did!""

""No, I do NOT.""

""Then who got at least 100 guys to piss in my pool, huh?!""

""What? You called about, WHAT!?""

""Come on, Jane! You're the only one with that many friends and the gall to do it!""

""No, I did not, Roger. Leave me alone.""

The line went dead. Roger slammed the receiver back onto the cradle. His only lead was gone. He had no other ideas—except one. He picked up the phone again and called his friend, Franklin.

He left the house and got into his car. He was headed to a friend's place on the other side of town. He sat down in his brand-new Dodge Royal and started the car. It started right up. He quickly put it in gear and pulled away. On the way, he tried his best to recollect the last couple of days.

When he arrived, his old friend Franklin was sitting in the yard in a lawn chair. He was sipping a beer, enjoying his recent retirement from the force. Once a great investigator, Frank had decided to retire early after a recent case almost ended badly for him. Roger pulled up into the driveway of Frank's new home, which he had bought shortly after his early retirement.

""Hey, Frank!"" Roger greeted his old friend warmly.

""Hey, Roger! What do you think of the new house?""

""It's nice, Frank,"" said Roger. It was a very nice house, but Roger wasn't really paying attention. His mind was occupied with other things.

""Want a beer?""

""Sure.""

Frank got up and came back with another lawn chair and a couple of beers.

""So, Roger, you said you needed some advice about something you wanted to talk about in person.""

""Yes. Uh, well, I don't know how to say this, but someone—well, not just one, but multiple... Hundreds of people—have peed in my pool.""

Frank looked at Roger in amazement and disbelief for a moment.

""So, you're telling me that hundreds of people broke into your backyard... to pee in your pool?""

""I know it's ridiculous, but... Come on, let me just show you.""

Roger got up, and Frank followed him as they both got into the car and drove to Roger's house. Roger mechanically unlocked the door, stepped out onto the porch, and walked down to the pool. Frank just looked at the yellow pool in disbelief.

Frank began stumbling over his words: ""Wh—Ho—, Who. What, How, Who, When, And most importantly... WHY?""

Roger just looked at him, shaking his head. ""I don't know... Will you help me, Frank?""

Frank nodded his head. ""Especially for a friend, of course.""

Frank decided to activate his investigator mode. ""So, what were you doing the night before you came home and woke up to... this?""

""Well,"" Roger started, ""I went out to the new tiki bar that opened by the beach. I met a nice girl named Janet. We sat at the bar and talked for hours. It was really nice. It was a beautiful night.""

Frank interjected, ""Was she with anyone else?""

""Not that I know of.""

""Okay, continue.""

""Around midnight, I left the bar. I walked, not too far from home, so I didn't drive there. Then I got inside the house and collapsed on the bed. I was hammered.""

Frank nodded, thinking through what Roger had just told him. ""Okay. This morning, when you walked down your porch, did you investigate any further?""

Roger looked embarrassed for a moment, then said, ""No, I immediately went inside. I thought it had to be Jane.""

Frank looked at him, then said, ""Roger, there is no possible way she did this.""

Roger nodded his head. ""Okay, let's start the investigation.""

They looked around the yard for the next half hour. They found no evidence of a break-in. Nothing in the garden shed. They found one beer can: Marty Waterhouse Lite Beer. Roger and Frank sat defeated inside, looking at the single empty beer can, before Roger came up with the single craziest idea he had ever thought of.

""The Waterhouse Brewery headquarters is in town,"" Roger said.

Frank nodded along, encouraging Roger to continue.

""What if we get the serial number off this beer can, trace it to who bought it, and track down who did this?""

Frank looked at him for a moment, the gears in his head turning. ""Yes, it's a long shot, but it's possible. I have some contacts at headquarters who owe me favors. Let's go!""

Frank quickly got up and dragged Roger out the door. Frank decided he should drive, as Roger had never been to the headquarters.

The bright red Dodge Royal, with its white accents, pulled into the parking lot of the imposingly tall brewery headquarters. It wasn't out of place with the other luxury vehicles driven by company executives. What was out of place were the two disheveled men who climbed out.

Roger looked up at the tallest building in Whitefront, California. The small town had been booming the last few years as people flocked to the coast. The beer company, Waterhouse, and its CEO and founder had decided it was best to move their headquarters from the East Coast to California because of the growing market. To cut costs, they chose a small town, and ever since, the town had flourished.

Roger had never been here before. He worked at a small but lucrative law office. It was clear the town's success was largely due to this company.

They entered the reception area and spoke to the receptionist.

""Hey, I'm here to talk to Gordon. Tell him Frank is asking for him.""

The receptionist nodded. ""Ok, I'll let Mr. Gordon know before I leave. My shift is ending."" She got up from her desk and briskly walked out the back door. That's when someone Roger never wanted to see again entered to replace her.

""Roger! Why in the hell are you here?"" Roger's ex-wife, Jane, burst out.

Roger decided to briskly walk to the elevator with Frank, ignoring his ex-wife.

""Roger, you better get your ass—""

The elevator doors quickly closed, cutting off what she was about to say. Frank leaned over, clicking the fourth floor. Relaxing music played in the background as they ascended. He couldn't make out all the lyrics, but something about a beautiful night for a party echoed softly.

The elevator quickly closed, cutting off what she was about to say. Frank leaned over, clicking the button for the 4th floor. Relaxing music played in the background as they ascended. He couldn't catch all the lyrics, but it was something about a beautiful night for a party.

The elevator dinged, and the doors opened. Frank led Roger down the hall until they came to a door with Gordon's nameplate. They knocked.

""Come in!""

The door opened to a large, spacious office with floor-to-ceiling windows. Gordon, to Roger's surprise, was a young Black man with a wide, welcoming smile.

""Frank! Nice to see you, my old friend. And...?""

""Roger,"" he said curtly. Gordon's smile dimmed slightly at Roger's tone. Turning back to Frank, Gordon said, ""I heard about your retirement! Congratulations! Speaking of that, we still need to plan the retirement party—""

""I'm here on business, Gordon,"" Frank interrupted quickly.

""Aren't you retired?""

""I am. This is personal. I need to help my friend Roger here with a case.""

Gordon nodded. ""So, you need my help?""

""Yes,"" Frank responded.

""What do you need?"" Gordon asked.

Frank set a crumpled beer can on the desk.

""A beer can?"" Gordon said, confused.

""I need you to trace the serial number of this beer can to where it was sold. We suspect our suspect purchased this beer.""

Gordon nodded, then shuffled through papers and opened several filing cabinets before shaking his head.

""Nope, not here. It's probably in Quality Assurance. We keep the serial numbers in case we have to withdraw a product from shelves—makes it easier to know what was affected.""

Frank sighed in disappointment, but Gordon spoke up again.

""But I do have access.""

Gordon led Roger and Frank through the hallway into a large room with many cubicles. People typed away on typewriters. Roger observed Gordon, contemplating how, despite looking down on him, the man was still helping him. Strange.

Finally, they arrived at a locked door. Gordon pulled out a key and unlocked it. Inside were rows upon rows of filing cabinets. Frank sighed.

""This is going to take hours, isn't it?""

And it did. Hours passed as they sifted through files.

""This is taking forever!"" Roger complained.

""I found it!"" Gordon yelled out.

 It was exactly what they where looking for. 04/11/54—all the beer made that day and delivered that night. Skimming the files, they found the serial number they sought: C308.

Inside the file was a simple message, only three words long, that crushed the investigation instantly: ""Lost in Shipping.""

Roger almost wanted to cry. He had spent his entire Saturday chasing a lead that ultimately led nowhere. As they left, Frank turned to Gordon.

""Thanks again, man. Sorry to waste your time.""

Gordon nodded. Roger, feeling the need to show some gratitude, said, ""Thank you."" Gordon nodded again, understanding in his eyes.

The office was emptying as they walked through the cubicles, everyone heading home for the day. They took the elevator down.

""Damn it, Roger!""

They were immediately greeted by Jane as they stepped off the elevator. ""What were you doing up there all day, huh? Getting a lawyer to squeeze more out of the divorce? Buying another extravagant beer keg for your house?""

Roger just looked at her in exhaustion and defeat, shaking his head.

""Leave him alone, Jane; he's been through a lot today,"" Frank said earnestly.

""Leave him alone?! Leave him alone?! Oh boy, don't you have a lot of nerve. You're lucky we're in PUBLIC! I would cuss you out right now! He didn't leave me alone this morning, he didn't leave me alone during the divorce, he didn't even leave me alone when we were married! NO! I will not leave him alone.""

She kept going on and on as Frank dragged Roger back to the car. Roger insisted on driving.

""I need more than just a beer—something stronger,"" Roger said before starting the car and driving off.

""Where are we going?"" Frank asked.

""To the tiki bar.""

By the time they arrived, the bar was already starting to fill up. Frank and Roger went inside and sat down. Roger turned to Frank. ""Drinks are on me tonight for all the work we did today. How about a margarita?""

Frank looked at him and said, ""I've never had one.""

Roger looked at Frank in amazement. ""Never had one? They're great! Two margaritas, please.""

That's when a familiar face came into view. Janet from last night came up and sat next to them.

""Hi, Roger, nice to see you again.""

""Hey, Janet.""

""Is something wrong?""

Frank turned to her and said, ""He's down today. Someone... vandalized his pool.""

Janet turned back to Roger. ""Is there anything else I can do to help?""

Frank spoke up for Roger. ""Yes, there is. Roger said you weren't with anyone, as far as he knew, but if you were, they could have been the ones who did this.""

Janet nodded, thinking for a moment, before saying, ""I had a date with some guy named Mark, I think? No, wait..."" Janet thought for a moment. ""Max? No..."" Finally, she spoke up. ""Marty... some Marty Water... Horse?""

Frank looked at her, wide-eyed. ""Waterhouse?!""

Janet looked at him for a moment. ""Yes! That was it!""

Roger stared at her in amazement. ""So, you're telling me you ditched a rich millionaire beer tycoon to go on a date with me and didn't even remember his name?!""

Janet nodded. ""You were cute; he wasn't. I got super drunk.""

Roger abruptly got up and started walking toward the door.

""Roger! What about the margaritas?!"" Frank called after him.

""Put it on my tab! I need my Warm Justice!"" Roger replied.

""Roger, don't do this,"" said Frank, not chasing him.

""Roger, Marty is a dangerous man. He's the reason I retired! He and his men almost killed me!"" Frank desperately called out, but Roger wasn't listening.

""Who's going to take me home?!"" Frank said more to himself than to Roger. He was long gone.

Frank sighed. Maybe Janet would take him home. He walked back in the bar to finish the  margaritas that roger bought. 

Roger was speeding down the road, bee-lining it straight to Marty's house. He lived in the new wealthy neighborhood being built on the west side of town near the beach. He was doing well over the speed limit, and no stoplight or stop sign would stop him. He was getting angrier and angrier. Marty had no right—no right at all—to do that. Roger didn't even know he was there. Instead of acting like a child, Marty could have just spoken up about how Roger had stolen his date. But did he do that? No. He went out of his way to recruit an army of men to piss in Roger's brand-new pool.

By the time Roger pulled into the driveway of the mansion, he was furious. He saw that Waterhouse had one of those fancy electronic gates with a code. Of course, the flimsy gate was no match for Roger ramming it with his car at 65 MPH. The gates broke instantly, surprisingly causing minimal damage to the car.

Roger sat in the car for a moment, ""To late to second guess yourself now Roger,"" He said to himself. 

Roger slammed on the brakes, got out, and marched his way up to the door, holding a big lug wrench as his weapon. The door was far too sturdy for him to get through, but luckily for Roger, glass isn't as strong. He smashed the window in with the wrench before climbing inside, disregarding the glass shards that could have cut him if he weren't careful.

""WATERHOUSE! I'M HERE, ASSHOLE! COME ON OUT AND FIGHT ME!""

That's when, unexpectedly, a bottle smashed into Roger's face. Glass shards and beer went everywhere. It was a ball of fury and hate. The men fought wildly, clearly never having been in many physical fights. They tried every dirty move they could think of to get the upper hand. Eventually, Roger got the upper hand and threw Waterhouse outside into the mud before throwing himself on top of him.

They fought in the mud, blood, and beer. Punch after punch, Roger sent directly into Marty's face. Over and over again, until he paused. He looked up. Surrounding him were 300 men, all staring at Roger with bitter hatred.

Acting fast, Roger climbed back through the broken window. The way to the door was blocked by Gordon.

""I Forged that missing shipping document for a reason, damn it, Roger!""

Roger shook his head in amazement. ""Gordon!?""

Gordon started walking toward Roger. ""You just couldn't stay away, could you?""

Thinking fast, Roger hit Gordon over the head with the wrench. Before Gordon could regain his composure, Roger ran behind him to the front door. Locked. Gordon was already getting up, ready to lunge forward to grab Roger. That's when Roger saw it: the pull string to open the stairs to the attic.

He quickly pulled it down before scrambling up the stairs. Once inside, he pulled it back up behind him. He looked around eagerly for an escape. There was a window big enough to jump out of into the pool in the front yard.

Roger smashed the window with his wrench before quickly jumping out, diving into the pool. He quickly surfaced and scrambled out. He ran to his car and started it. The engine roared as reliably as ever. Roger quickly shifted into gear and took off.

He thought he was safe until he saw a pair of headlights. Then another. Car after car joined the chase. He sped up, slowed down, and went around and around the twisting hills, trying to get away from them. Eventually, he made it back into town, driving wildly through the empty streets. That's when—BOOM—the front tire suddenly burst on his Dodge. The car swerved, sending him into a light pole.

""Damn it, Roger! Are you drinking and driving again?!"" said an irritated voice.

In amazement, Roger realized he had just so happened to crash his car right in front of Jane. Before he could second-guess himself, he said, ""Get in the car!""

""Are you crazy, Roger? If not, you're drunk. The front tire popped! You need to change it, then you need to pay for the damn light pole you nearly snapped in half!""

Roger nervously glanced in the rearview mirror as headlights started shining on the far wall. ""Trust me, this one damn time, Jane—get in the car, or we both die!""

""Roger, shut up! You never listened to me. Why should I listen to you now? I didn't want the divorce, but you insisted, despite the fact that you were the one who cheated. And you know what? Thank you, Roger! It was the best decision of your life!""

Roger thought back to it and suddenly realized—she was right.

He had been a terrible husband, father, and person, and did not deserve a thing he owned. Roger sighed before looking up at Jane and, in earnest, said, ""You're right. I was a horrible husband and an even worse father to our children. I deserved every word and more—much more than what you've said. And I am so, so sorry. But Jane, I'm telling you right now—please believe me—we WILL BE DEAD in less than 30 seconds unless you get in this damn car right now!""

Jane looked down in amazement at Roger for a moment before actually opening the passenger door and getting in. ""You better be right.""

With that, Roger attempted to restart the car. The starter whirled. He clearly heard some fluid leaking from the car, and the hum of the engine got closer and closer as the first Chevy Impala started pulling into view.

Jane screamed in horror. Then the engine coughed, sputtered, and roared to life. Roger quickly threw the car in reverse and slammed on the gas. The car peeled out, now driving backward as it was chased.

""You know that trick with the handbrake to do a 180-degree turn like in the movies?""

""Roger, are you crazy?!""

""Maybe.""

Roger sharply turned the wheel, pulled the handbrake, popped the clutch, and shifted into gear before peeling away. ""There is no way I just did that!""

Roger navigated the streets swiftly and effectively until he turned off onto the street to exit town. There he saw the line of Oldsmobiles, with Marty Waterhouse standing in front of them, pointing a .44 revolver right at them.

Immediately, shots started being fired.

""Jane, get down!""

Both ducked under the dash. Roger sent the car careening straight into the blockade. CRASH. The sounds of twisted metal and breaking glass filled the air, along with more gunshots. Miraculously, Roger and Jane were unharmed.

They sat back up. Roger smiled at Jane. ""We did it!""

That's when the engine started sputtering. It coughed once, then twice, and then died. They were only a few hundred feet away.

Roger and Jane quickly got out and started running. BANG. The .44 went off.

""You better stop, you two, before you get shot,"" said Marty Waterhouse, now with severe damage—two black eyes, a broken nose that was bleeding, and several missing teeth.

""You've got yourself a little accomplice now, huh, Roger?""

Marty started walking toward them, the gun in his hand gleaming under the dim streetlights. The subtle tap, tap, tap of his footsteps echoed as he approached.

""You can't get away with this! They'll find us and trace it back to you!"" Roger spat out in desperation.

""I own this town, Roger. I have every dirty cop, the city council, and even the mayor under my thumb. This is easy, Roger.""

""You can't do this, Marty! How will you explain us going missing? The town just can't ignore it!"" Jane yelled.

""You're right, they can't. That's why I've planned how you'll die. I thought about pulling out your teeth one by one, then beating you to death. But honestly, I just want you gone. That's when it hit me—it's so simple. The newspapers will say, ""Local Man goes insane after someone peed in is pool, kills Ex-Wife in revenge""

Jane gasped in horror. Roger just stared at Marty, expressionless.

""Get the sacks, boys!""

Suddenly, a few of Marty's men came up behind Jane and Roger. They were shoved into burlap sacks and thrown into the trunk of Marty's car. Roger started hyperventilating. The darkness and tight confines of the bag were suffocating. He clawed at the fabric, desperate to escape, when a knife suddenly pierced through the material, cutting it open.

Above him was Jane, holding a pocket knife. ""Damn it, Roger, stop squirming. I might accidentally cut you,"" she whispered.

Eventually, she cut him fully free from the bag. The trunk was surprisingly spacious, allowing both of them to kneel.

""Okay, we need to get the hell out of here,"" Jane said urgently.

Roger nodded in agreement. Jane pulled out a multi-tool from her other pocket, using the toothpick attachment to work on the locking mechanism.

The lock soon popped open.

""Okay, Roger, we need to wait until the car stops—hopefully at a stoplight—so we can slip out and get away, okay?""

Roger didn't have time to respond before the car came to a halt.

""Now!"" she whispered urgently.

Roger quickly scrambled out of the cramped space and helped Jane out. That's when Roger noticed their stopping point: they were at his backyard. It was too late.

""Good job, you two,"" said a voice behind them.

They whipped around to see Marty Waterhouse walking toward them.

""You actually made my job easier—I don't even have to drag you out of the bags,"" he said, smiling menacingly, his gun glinting in the soft moonlight. Behind him, the pool glowed a faint, sickly yellow.

Marty cocked the hammer of the revolver. ""Any last words, Roger?""

""behind you!"" Roger shouted.

Marty whipped around, falling for the trick. He instantly realized his mistake when Roger's fist connected directly with his face. Roger tried to wrestle the gun away. Jane Tried to help but quickly was thrown off by Marty.

That's when Waterhouse gained the upper hand. He jabbed Roger in the stomach with his elbow, pushing him back. Roger doubled over in pain.

""I'll kill your ex-wife first, then!""

Before Marty could say anything else, an old black Oldsmobile smashed through Roger's back fence. Its siren blared as the car skidded to a halt.

Frank threw himself out of his car, his trusty service pistol in hand.

""Get on the ground, Waterhouse! You're under arrest!""

Marty put his hands up, knowing he was defeated. ""You were the only one I couldn't pay off,"" he said.

He threw the revolver forward, causing it to discharge and hit Frank in the foot. Frank cursed several times before walking over to Waterhouse and handcuffing him. Soon, the rest of the force arrived on the scene.

Roger was still stunned by the events when he turned to Jane.

""Roger!"" Jane cried.

She seemed to have just processed what had almost happened and threw her arms around him, sobbing into his shoulder.

""Roger, we almost died! We almost died! What would've happened if I hadn't—""

Roger cut her off. ""Don't think about that. We're safe. We're safe now.""

He held her in his arms for a long moment as the arrests continued in his backyard. She turned her face up to him, tears still shining in her eyes. He looked down at her, and in that moment, she was the most beautiful woman in the world.

""I sure did get revenge on the son of a bitch who peed in my pool didnt I?""

Jane laughed at the absurdity of it all. 

He leaned in and kissed her.

And so, on that day, 300 men were arrested, marking the largest arrest in California history. Gordon and Waterhouse were charged with multiple crimes, including Bribery, forged documents, tax evasion, and mass vandalism. 

Frank only came because of Janet bugged him to after Roger left and waited for Roger to come back. When Marty showed up instead he knew what to do. After this continued to enjoy his retirement, occasionally helping with small cases. Janet and Frank got married a couple of years later. Tammy, from Roger's third-grade class, took over the beer company and continued steering it toward success.

And Roger? He and Jane remarried that year and lived happily together, building a much healthier relationship. In the end, Roger's pool vandalism was covered by his homeowner's insurance, making the entire ordeal a petty tale of revenge gone awry. But hey, at least he brought down an entire crime ring and rekindled his relationship with his Ex-Wife right?
