My boyfriend (37M) and I (27F) have been dating 10 months & have been living together for 5mos. We were “seeing each other” for probably 6mos before then, and have known each other & been friends since 2020 (just not close friends). Initially, we met on a dating app, I wasn’t ready at that time to be dating I realized and put space between us. We reconnected as friends in early 2023 & things have progressed from there. 

He’s great to me, shows me healthy love, encourages/supports all my goals, & shows he loves me deeply. We’re very playful & laugh every day, love to cook together, play games, nights out/nights in, vacation, share friends, etc. He cares for me through all ups and downs, we make decisions as a team, I’ve met his dad & we get along great! My boyfriend has met my mom and she likes him (in her words she “hates” everyone), my friends even say he’s the best man I’ve ever dated.

The problem is: 

There are small things that have come up recently that make me question his character & our relationship. 

In the past, I’ve caught him in awkward lies or unfair (to me) situations where I would confront him and he always had some response. I’ve never bought into them, though after discussing we would find middle ground & I did see change each time. I’m not perfect & I’ve had my flaws/areas of improvement as well. We communicate well and are able to come to understandings and move forward together. I always give everyone the benefit of the doubt & a chance to grow. Though… In October 2024 we had a huge discussion & it came down to: things are honest or I’m done.

Also in October, he started binge drinking due to grieving the loss of his mom, other family matters, & physical/mental health issues. He was using kratom & quit in early August, right before we moved in together... Unfortunately then replaced with drinking alcohol. He’s since become so irritable, aggressive, unhealthy, unhappy, unmotivated, mean sometimes, and very inconsiderate. He’s finally (this week) taken the steps to quit drinking and intends to be totally sober. I’ve never seen any of this behavior from him before, and know he’s been struggling, so I’ve been supportive through the journey because this isn’t the man I’ve known all these years. I’ve been doing my best, but I’m getting close to my breaking point…

Throughout this phase of withdrawals from alcohol, I found an empty bottle of kratom while deep cleaning when he wasn’t home. I’ve been trying to decide how to approach this situation, but I’d love some advice. 
Of course I’m upset he has gone back on his efforts to stop using it, the thing is he hid it from me (way far back in a drawer I dont use much). During the current alcohol withdrawals, his family asked if he had used kratom (& mentioned it’s okay if so, sometimes people slip, nobody is judging. we want to be supportive). *He lied* … He said he did not use kratom. Though I haven’t asked yet, there is no reason there should be kratom here if he quit before we moved in (we don’t ever have friends over because our apartment is very small and we both work a lot and like to keep home our sanctuary, so it couldn’t have been left here by a friend). I don’t want to jump the gun, but it just doesn’t make sense. 

Also while cleaning, I found things in his little trash can near his desk that he’s told me he didn’t take/didn’t know where they went (small things, nothing super important). 
He would go to the gas station while I would be sleeping and use my card to buy alcohol.  Recently, I had cash (a small Christmas bonus from work) in my car. One night he used my car while I was sleeping, I woke up when he came back in, & said he went to the ATM to check his card balance (use your banking app??!?!). The next morning I went to get coffee & I noticed there was a few dollars missing (he bought shooters). 
On my birthday & Christmas he mentioned he had bought me gifts & actually never did. (I’m not materialistic).
For my birthday he mentioned giving a family heirloom & said his dad thought that was a great idea. Weeks later when I asked him about it, he said I should’ve reminded him and got defensive… I still haven’t gotten it. 2 days ago, I told his dad this & he looked at me both confused & surprised. 
For Christmas he told me he got very expensive jewelry that he’d been paying on layaway & it would be here Jan 10th, 2025, i never got anything. 

Though these things may sound somewhat insignificant, it’s the principle of the matter. If you’re going to do something, do it. If you needed a few dollars, why not ask? (He is employed btw). Point is, he lied about taking things, buying things, has been hiding things. All this added up is making me question my relationship up to this point.
When we said, “All honesty from here” back in the fall, was that just to string me along because of the perks of being in a relationship? Anything I’ve questioned since that talk, accepted his answers, & moved on with… was he really lying? If he can lie about $2, why should I believe that the dating apps I found on his phone right before we moved in, the flirty comments to girls on social media, etc, were only being used for networking and gaining clients (for personal training)? 

With these small lies coming to light, I now am questioning and reconsidering literally everything that has ever been said to me to this point. Timelines longer make sense & I’m confused over a lot of things he’s told me in the past. 

I’ve learned that he lies to everyone. Since I’m now with him all the time, I hear what he says to friends/family/colleagues & it’s literally everyone (at some point).

I am wondering, how do I confront his behavior? How do I bring allllllll of this up while being sensitive to his emotional health during his detoxing? I’m a very empathetic person typically & don’t want to hurt him even if he’s hurt me. I can also get heated pretty easily, so I’m really taking my time with how I approach this situation. 

TL;DR I’ve caught my boyfriend in a web of lies & deceit & im not sure how to confront him without accusations or losing my cool. ",1,1737014935.0,relationships,1,1.0,False

        Chapter 1.  
                      
                            The Garden.

     
      “The Gardner” walks along his dirt, his grass, her path. He sees the multitude colors dancing from flower to rock in morning dew, and feels chalky gravel where it always is beneath his shoes. His feet crunch as what’s left of his ankles bear weight, and his gaze, it drifts. Attention is something that one focuses, but The Gardener never makes a point to look. Occasionally a butterfly wing will sit in the cracks of his fence. While he’s adrift, a rusty nail entrenched in cobwebs will show how rolling bends in a life of hits and holding up that fence’s wood can birth a butterfly’s grave stone, and this fracture of life and purpose might turn a shape to catch his eye. The Gardener collects interesting salted air glazed rocks, sticks, feathers, shells, and anything of lost purpose from anywhere in town. He doesn’t look for those objects, the ones who’ve fallen between slats, but he can’t help see that the town known as Seamonster is something of an open air treasure chest. Keeping his reclaimed art in an extra watering can, the man moves to it for each drop off, seemingly well balanced on battle worn hoofs. Green as they both are, he drips life from the watering can he gardens with every day, and the other rests under his stoop protected by shade though aware of the weather.

      The pig parade is near, but The Gardener knows that outside of watching all the fanciful swine strutting by he will never have a chance to participate. Marisilver, once his focus and partner in the garden, had died some time back. He can still feel her rubbing against his leg as he picks yellow leaves, and he habitually imagines feeding her from his tomato plants. The Gardener had always wanted to enter Marisilver into the parade, though his thoughts of this were merely snow on a cloudless summer’s day. You see, Marisilver was born with but three legs, and it didn’t change a bit of how he felt about her. Marisilver was rife with everything he needed, she was with him through every task and drop into both watering cans, though she was not much of a parader. 

      One day, after grumbling to himself about finding a new family member reminiscent of his piggy, the aging soul clinging to his crop tossed a green bottle cap he’d found on his walk. The treasure made a whispering ring as it bounced from the sun licked collar of the old watering can, and settled comfortably to the shade inside. In the waning light somebody’s tittle discarded fell happily upon a pile of worn, tattered, and beach rusted things. He had reorganized another lot of the world he’d found on his walks, something shared by a village whom he’d only ever partially interacted with. In his safe-keeping can where no water was kept, a sliver of the town came to rest. As the tinks of the bottle cap stopped their commotion, The Gardener had a passing thought, a wish, and then off he went to bed again for another night.



       Chapter 2.
                            
                             The Pig.


      In the first breath of morning light he folded what was left of his body. Gradually sitting up, with a shiver and a yawn he put his vegetable patterned robe on. After a groggy and cautious limp downstairs The Gardner mashed on his gardening shoes. Taming the cup of coffee in hand he turned towards the back door, a glass door, a window into the garden. There, towering over the dewy water stain where his “extra” watering can once sat, was a thing never before seen. An old man’s eyes can blur, they can struggle and fail, and he knew his were often not to be trusted, but after a few blinks, a sip, and a rather forceful rub, he came to terms with his observation. A pig made of treasures stumbled upon, stood with its conglomerate nose now pressed upon his back door. It was hard to tell of them which was happier to see the other, the newly assembled animal or the old plantsmith. The once beautiful leaves he had dried and placed in the jug were now a more stunning gold than he’d ever seen in the past, sticking up and then rolling over on its head as a pig’s ears do. Sea snail shells were assembled in such a way that their forming of haunches married with broken jewelry to seamlessly mold musculature. The old bottle caps with paint stripped off of them to reveal their brass were the sort of blinding gold that forces your head like a hand away from looking directly at it. The artfully grown sticks he’d collected, were gold. The tidbits of everything lost and now found, gold. All of The Gardener’s Personal collectors items were embodied in a tie for the most awe inspiring swine he’d ever gazed upon. Marisilver was no less impressive than the pig at the door, but his memory of her had clearly brought something wonderful to fill the man’s void.
 
      “The flowers can wait.” he exclaimed with convicted belief as he made way to meet his new friend. Tossing the glass door aside, he caught a slipper on the baseboard, but quickly recovered his footing just as he’d have done on a more youthful day. Then with a younger man’s cautious abandon he rushed to pick “just the right spot” to experience her. Crimson roses on one side and a rubbish bin on the other, blind with the focus of a school boy who knows girls like flowers, but who’s not yet aware of deodorant. With a hand on her face he just sat. The tempered old soul sat and wept with joy, and the pig didn’t move much except for to push her golden nose firmly into his hand. With those ticks of time a fig leaf dropped from tree to ground, and the gardener started referring to this most treasured treasure as Marigold.

      

      Chapter 3

                          The News.


A torn advertisement from a shoddy telephone pole stapling job blew its way through the trees above his butterfly fence, through zucchini vines and nitrogen rich mud, all its way just to stop at his new pig’s feet. The paper read “Pig parade this Saturday, may the bacon of legend be taken this title”. Through the glass door The Gardener could read the calendar on his wall, which told him today was the day after Friday and one day before ice cream. Electrically the words of the flier resounded in his head, overwhelmed, they moved him robotically like a wind up toy towards the door.

      Fifteen minutes, all it took was fifteen minutes and Marigold was entered as a contestant in the parade. What seemed like lifetimes after being entered were just flashbulbs as Marigold was suddenly in it. Without preparation she was strutting through town while the ocean air grabbed aggressively over and around all in its way. Marigold marched with a pack of gorgeous coastal weather immune pigs, animals bread solely for parading their chops on this and only this day. As she dipped her head with each movement and step, The Gardener mirrored her like a shadow in the sunset’s changing light.

         


      Chapter 4.

                             The Parade.


      The town’s folk did not know what to make of the shining pig in the pack, the one made of their discarded bits. People recognized their up-cycled chicken’s feathers, bottle caps, acorns, screws, and shoelaces. Some stood silent, while others booed, and yet others allowed themselves to enjoy Marigold’s wiggles. She marched all day without wavering, occasionally dropping chunks of herself as the wind pierced the gaps in what she was made of. The pig’s component elements sometimes tinked at the feet of the men, women, and children watching by the roadside. The sun made a lap from shoulder to shoulder as those scratching their heads began giving her praise. The Gardener’s focus on her got to the point where he could no longer see how Marigold was anything but the sum of her parts. 

      As of late, focus was relatively new to this man but it nestled in him so naturally. Contagious is a tide of changing minds. Inspiration is often passed from someone to you. Whether they were aware that something was happening while his muse turned to form, or convinced they were the author of the ideas that fell from his head, somehow at this moment all in Seamonster we’re suddenly aware of how dark their room with open eyes had been. Skepticism and boos turned to cheers, this pig made of garbage had won over the hardened townspeople by using their own unwelcome things. Distributing all she had to deposit during her caravan through the streets, by the end the golden pig had given back one whole leg’s worth of drizzled trinkets to the community whom she was woven from. She marched ahead on only three gorgeous legs, above reproach, to the end.

      That day, a gold medal was hung around the neck of a golden three legged pig made of trash, and with a wrinkled smile The Gardener watered every plant she limped past on their way home. 

      That night, Marigold gave the old man a slobbery rubbish covered kiss as he tucked her into bed right next to him. Enveloped by vegetable patterned sheets she came to rest peacefully. The Gardener said good night as softly as his scratchy old voice was capable of, and darkness took the room.

                 

       Chapter 5.  

                          The Morning.


      Folding his crackling body again, the Gardener slowly sat up. The glow of a sun soon to rise kicking through his parted slats, led enough focus for The Gardener to check under the now generational wool blanket, revealing an impression of where his Marigold had resided the night before, She was nowhere to be seen. A desperate shuffle down the stairs with tremorous caffeine withdrawing hands offered only two full watering cans, one of water and one of things. 

       Knock, knock, knock!

      A confused man rubbing old eyes did a gradual about face. Not a drop of coffee uselessly coating his mouth, his symptoms were stood upon by the will of his fear. A hard face telling nothing of the explosions permeating every ounce of his being just moved him without thought. No longer afloat on wings to drift him to the front door, old joints ineptly commanded feet that felt like they were glued through the worn out nail shafts of his withered floorboards. “No one knocks at my door” he despondently thought to himself, knowing the town only ever gave him what they didn’t want, and he’d already accepted from them what he could. Dropped into sadness, somehow The Gardener made it to his caller and their knocks. 

      The woman at the door was inequitably happy, and faster than the whips of wind gusts moving his last few resilient hairs, she shot forth a gift basket with an attached note... “Congratulations on winning the first ever Marigold parade, may the things we take for granted take us back again.” 

      Adrift, The Gardener reluctantly pressed his nose against the pink flowers boiling from the vessel. The golden sheen off the decorative foil on the basket, the flowers in it and how they were grown, the context of the note’s words despite the font, the conglomerate treasures to be kept once the parcel enjoyed, all three legs of the base. The Gardener didn’t notice a thing the woman pushed upon him even though they were just the swell of his own tide returning, but he felt peace again for the first time in years.



                                       
       Chapter 6.

                           The Dream.


       As Mary moved with his wheelchair through the yard, she chose her steps wisely. The cracked paving stones didn’t do her old prosthetic any favors. Her father couldn’t drink his coffee anymore, but she could tell he was smiling when she blew the wind of it’s scent past his nose. Neither of them were capable of focusing on much during their walks through the artificially manicured garden of the facility. Somehow when they were together the cliche shrubbery melted away and it was like being back at her childhood home again. Her daughter would now play with the stuffed sea monster that she used to cuddle while she ate sweet tomatoes from her fathers hand. As if in a living heaven, she used to watch the lucky butterflies bounce above the color palette of the garden on the whims of wind gusts. Mary would pick butterfly wings from cobwebs wrapped around the exposed nails of the fence, and those webs would inevitably be dotted on her clothes when she made way past the snail shells, between the watering cans, to the glass door that looked out. She’d occasionally let her mind touch on the day she was helping her father take vegetables to the farmer’s market. Closing her eyes, she then forgot herself. The kids in town would tease her for her weight, dissolving all the good her childhood had provided her. That day she’d walked down a crowded street in salty air, fumbling a vessel teaming with garden grown life. Mary felt the people noticing her, though they most probably had not. As she dropped an eggplant, a man with a twisted face booed unprovoked, catching her off guard. The kids from her school mostly stood silent, but they were all watching. Inequitably happy a pretty girl whom she’d only ever partially interacted with smiled as Mary bent to pick up the vegetable. Mary tripped and fell into the street, the other kids began to cackle as she struggled to maintain composure. She made a point not to focus on the kids who were laughing and calling her “piggy”, or the car that struck her as she ran away from the crowd in shame, or how she has to navigate cracks in her path that she’d never had to notice before.

      Mary could breakaway from her obligations to see her dad periodically, maybe another fifteen minutes next week. Except for her time with her daughter, the days in-between seemed like flashbulbs firing, then suddenly death stopped again for their walks. Taking him back again, she hoped her father would be able to open his eyes when she came to see him next.




Chapter 6.

                            The Reality.     

 
      The Gardener thought of more possibilities as the woman pushed him. He no longer possessed the ability to pick up the bits of others that once held him together. Listless, his will to look through windows was vacant, if he’d caught his own reflection then her pain would be his again. These things were lost to time and replaced with wishes. As soon as the woman walked his chair inside he could feel the transition from wood encased by drywall to a window that looked out. The cold glass was less than a foot away, and raised hairs on his arm like gravestones erecting from shallow soil during an earthquake. Stiffened whiskers on an arm that he couldn’t move if a train was barreling towards him let him see better than he should’ve been able to at this point. He moved his face in the direction of the glass with glazed eyes that would never see it coming, peering through holes that could not open despite a looming truth that others knew. 

      “Grace!”, yelled a man from the other room, the woman quickly clicked her shoes away on the linoleum floor leaving his chair where it was. Half cocked, the gardener felt the window trying to show him a reflection, his reflection. 

      Despite his unwillingness to face the world as it was, he knew. The only thing that ever gave him purpose had limped with him through every harvest. She was so good at choosing her steps wisely and working with how she was made, but no one is perfect forever. His crops stopped growing as the wind blew the fog in that day. Mary floated above all gardens when she left her Seamonster, on wings that should have never deserved to find themselves a fence’s gravestone. The Gardener made way through the rest of life’s things, focused on something now forever intangible. His mind made the best of its ability to delude. Of the finds he’d collected, his Mary took gold medals in what life was worth to him. 
   
      The ocean waves splash on different rocks for all of us, as those that have always stood-fast dissolve and new shores emerge. The rocks that change are struck by waters always mixing, with molecules that used to be on the other side of the world. Fog, mist, and the rains that fill the sea’s bathtub splinter both the cliffs and consistency of the ocean’s makeup. Every drop too fine to touch, or large enough to be abrupt as it struck his outstretched tongue pointed toward the clouds, folded its way into the changing recipe. In the end we sit blind looking out, with what we see carefully placed where we’ve chosen to put it.

Back then, I had a slight crush on him, but we only knew each other from a distance. Over the years, we’d occasionally reconnect on social media, chat briefly, and then lose touch. This time, he reached out to ask for job referrals, which I helped with. After that, he started asking more personal questions.

We texted daily, though responses were sometimes delayed, which didn’t bother me. A couple of weeks in, he began flirting, and I flirted back. We had so much in common, and he planned to meet up, but canceled last minute due to a family issue (he lives 2 hours away). When I brought up meeting again, he couldn't make it because of last minute plans with friends. Frustrated, I asked him directly what was going on, didn't want to waste anyone’s time.

He said he was reconnecting with an old friend “with an open mind” but focusing on himself. The next day, he sent a long message reassuring me he wasn’t using me, didn’t want to waste time, and wanted  to connect back and if i allow him to get to know each other as friends and he doesn't want to miss out getting to know me off a confusion. I agreed to keep things friendly, but his mixed signals left me unsure since I saw him only as a friend in the beginning but him flirting messed things up. 

After a few weeks, he started flirting again and suggested meeting up for coffee and a sunset at the beach. I freaked out a bit (since he had said “just friends”) but agreed to just coffee. Meeting him in person was surprisingly easy and natural. I walked in and gave him a hug and he was shy/nervous and wasn't making eye contact with me. It made me feel better and more confident for some reason. After we took a seat things got better and it was so natural talking to him. He teased me and I teased him back and we ended up talking for an hour and a half. Afterward, he texted me, saying it was amazing catching up. I replied that it was nice to see him too.

Now the issue is the convo is a bit dry/weird since I am waiting for him to i guess take the lead. I did throw in I was so busy with work to which he replied. But there isn't much to make a convo out of this. Now my dilemma is I really don't know what to do with him. I am not sure if he even likes me or he's just being a nice guy. The thing is after meeting him I realized i could catch feelings for him and I don't want this to be one sided. What should I do?

She then takes Sam’s hand and reveals that she knows about Jessica’s death and John’s disappearance, ostensibly from reading Sam’s mind, but when Dean asks her where his dad is and whether he’s OK she says she doesn’t know, and when Dean challenges her on this, she responds with attitude:  
  
DEAN: Don’t know? Well, you’re supposed to be a psychic, right?

Sam finds all of this highly amusing, which is understandable considering he’s used to Dean’s cocky attitude and constantly being the butt of his teasing. He’s enjoying seeing his older brother copping shit from somebody else for a change. The first time I watched the episode, I sympathized, and I enjoyed Lorretta Devine’s entertaining performance. But after subsequent re-watches I’ve since started to question her constant needling of Dean throughout the episode. Almost the first thing she says to him is an insult, claiming ""you were one goofy looking kid!""

Was he? Let’s check the photographic evidence we’re shown in the episode:

https://preview.redd.it/f8y2ysw26bde1.jpg?width=602&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=29e4a3b3909a6c0804f1a755603d6aa4863cd36b

[Looks fine to me.](https://preview.redd.it/l4yd1uw26bde1.jpg?width=602&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b45434bea089e152b722d252f72826c169be17a1)

Maybe it’s all just for fun and it’s supposed to come across as motherly, but a lot of it seems quite uncalled for and I’ve begun to wonder if, at one time, there was a more serious intention behind it all. I’ll be examining that possibility later too.  
  
Sam asks her about her first meeting with his father and we learn it was Missouri who first revealed the nature of the supernatural world to him:  
  
MISSOURI: He came for a reading. A few days after the fire. **I just told him what was really out there in the dark. I guess you could say…I drew back the curtains for him.**  
DEAN: What about the fire? Do you know about what killed our mom?  
MISSOURI: A little. Your daddy took me to your house. He was hopin’ I could sense the echoes, the fingerprints of this thing.  
SAM: And could you?  
MISSOURI: I….\[She shakes her head.\]  
SAM: What was it?  
MISSOURI: \[softly\] I don’t know. Oh, but it was evil. (Ibid)  
  
She reveals that she’s been keeping an eye on the old Winchester home, and it’s been quiet: “No sudden deaths, no freak accidents. Why is it actin’ up now?” she asks.  
  
“I don’t know,” Sam replies, “But Dad going missing and Jessica dying and now this house all happening at once . . . it just feels like something’s starting.” (Ibid)

I’d just like to take a time out from this narrative to point out something that bothers me about the season 13 ret-con of Missouri’s character where she’s portrayed as a hunter, neglectful of her young son because she was always out hunting. The Missouri character in *this* episode is a psychic running a private practice for her clients out of her home. She is *not* a hunter, and there’s no indication she ever was. Now, I acknowledge that there’s nothing that directly contradicts the possibility that she might have been a hunter in the past, which does leave the later writers with some wiggle room, I guess. But the dialogue here distinctly implies that she’s been on the spot the whole time observing the progress of the old house. Besides, “Home” is a myth arc episode and Missouri represents a version of a specific traditional character from the Hero’s journey, and that’s the wise old crone or witch figure who typically lives alone on the outskirts or borders of the town or village, isolated from normal society. So, I’m going to call bullshit on the idea of her ever having had a son or a normal family life of any kind. That wouldn't fit with the archetype. Again, I acknowledge that there’s nothing that directly excludes the possibility, but it strikes me as unlikely given her mythical status. (And if you’ve been following these reviews so far, you’ve probably already picked up on the fact that I’m not a fan of ret-con in general 😉)  
  
But, to return to the plot of “Home”, Jenny is on the phone with someone who’s threatening to sue her for the misfortunes of the amputee plumber, but she ends the call to investigate more scratching and crashing coming from upstairs. While she’s out of the kitchen an invisible force drops the front of Ritchie’s play pen and opens the fridge to reveal a sippy cup of his favourite juice prominently displayed with the rest of the contents stacked to the sides creating a convenient space for him to climb into, which he promptly does, and the fridge slams and locks closed with him inside it. When Jenny returns to the kitchen and finds her son is missing there’s a couple of minutes of frantic searching before milk spilling from the fridge alerts her to his whereabouts so she’s able to rescue him from a chilly fate.  
  
Sam and Dean choose this moment to turn up on her doorstep and ask if they can show Missouri round the place “for old time’s sake”, which would be a cheeky request at the best of times, but Jenny’s stressed so she tries to fob them off and close the door. Dean tries to forestall her: “Listen, Jenny, it’s important – ” at which point, Missouri slaps him upside the head:  
  
“Give the poor girl a break, can’t you see she’s upset?” she says then adds, to Jenny, “forgive this boy, he means well . . .”

https://preview.redd.it/03ppw64b7bde1.jpg?width=602&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d33533d90ec9ff50b76401a8de09320ad573b018

It’s a description of Dean that seems to persist despite all the evidence to the contrary, but we’ve seen several episodes now undercutting the stereotype that Dean is all brawn while Sam is all brain. We should know by now that he isn’t stupid. And, if Missouri’s psychic, she should know it too.  
  
But the exchange does stall Jenny long enough for Missouri to open a conversation with her about the house: “You think there’s something in this house, something that wants to hurt your family. Am I mistaken?” she asks, and adds, “we’re people who can help, who can stop this thing. But you’re gonna have to trust us, just a little.”  
  
Jenny trusts them enough to let them back in the house, anyway, and we see them next in Sari’s bedroom, which Missouri reveals used to be Sam’s old nursery. Dean pulls out his EMF metre and it lights up like Christmas. And Missouri is still needling Dean, calling him an amateur for needing the tech.

[Dean’s starting to get pissed with all the flak he’s getting.](https://preview.redd.it/vtib1ogo7bde1.jpg?width=602&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ade3aec4020bd27b2eb20ecf421adb683571874f)

Missouri senses an energy but it isn’t the same as the one she felt when Mary died. She also reveals there’s more than one spirit in the house. “They’re here because of what happened to your family. You see, all those years ago, real evil came to you. It walked this house. That kind of evil leaves wounds. And sometimes, wounds get infected . . . This place is a magnet for paranormal energy. It’s attracted a poltergeist. A nasty one. And it won’t rest until Jenny and her babies are dead.” She isn’t able to tell them anything about the second spirit.  
  
“Well, one thing’s for damn sure –- nobody’s dyin’ in this house ever again,” says Dean, “So, whatever is here, how do we stop it?”  
  
Cue the next scene in Missouri’s kitchen where she and the boys are busy making up hex bags, and we get some of my favourite “wackadoo exposition” on how to exorcise a poltergeist:  
  
DEAN: So, what is all this stuff, anyway?  
MISSOURI: **Angelica Root, Van Van oil, crossroad dirt, a few other odds and ends.**  
DEAN: Yeah? What are we supposed to do with it?  
MISSOURI: **We’re gonna put them inside the walls in the north, south, east, west corners on each floor of the house.**  
DEAN: We’ll be punchin’ holes in the dry wall. Jenny’s gonna love that.  
MISSOURI: \[slyly\] She’ll live.  
SAM: And this’ll destroy the spirits?  
MISSOURI: It should. It should purify the house completely. We’ll each take a floor. But we work fast. Once the spirits realize what we’re up to, things are gonna get bad.  
[http://www.supernaturalwiki.com/1.09\_Home\_(transcript)](http://www.supernaturalwiki.com/1.09_Home_(transcript))  
  
In retrospect, the inclusion of crossroad dirt on the list of ingredients seems noteworthy, given the myth-arc nature of this episode and the importance of crossroads and their demonic connection in the season 2 arc. Whether or not it’s deliberate foreshadowing, I don’t know, but I think it’s possible the writers already had some idea of where they wanted to go with season 2 if they got the opportunity.

https://preview.redd.it/utpbkfo88bde1.jpg?width=602&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f519969f74c3705aa86d60113b61f33b2f7450cf

Typically, Dean feels the need to taste the goods. And thus begins his series long tendency to touch, poke, handle, bury and kiss things he shouldn’t.  
  
Next, we cut to Missouri hustling Jenny and her family out of the house:

  
JENNY: Look, I’m not sure I’m comfortable leaving you guys here alone.  
MISSOURI: Just take your kids to the movies or somethin’, and it’ll be over by the time you get back. \[JENNY, still slightly unsure, leaves with her kids. MISSOURI goes back inside.\] (Ibid)  
  
  
(I don’t blame Jenny for being wary. For all she knows, this could all be a scam to turn the house over while she’s gone. I’ve seen *The Frighteners*. Maybe she has too! 😉)  
  
  
Once Jenny’s gone Missouri and the boys set to punching holes and placing the hex bags and, as she predicted, the house starts to attack straight away. As soon as she places the first bag, she’s whumped by a chest of drawers. The attacks to the brothers are particularly interesting. As usual, Sam’s throat is the target, with an electrical cord cutting off his breath, while Dean uses a table to fend off a knife attack to his body.

https://preview.redd.it/bfbc0mao8bde1.jpg?width=602&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=779322488fc6a5e5e3786a3731f6f4b0bd75c378

Remembering the traditional association of breath and soul, we once again see the brothers symbolically identified with soul and body respectively in the way they are targeted by supernatural forces.  
  
Dean’s anticipation of the knife attack seems almost - dare I say it? – preternatural. That and quick reflexes enable him to defend himself from injury and he’s able to complete his task. But Sam is less fortunate; the cord is so tight around his neck he can’t get it off and, although he still tries to reach the wall even while being throttled, he passes out and drops the bag. He’s only saved by Dean’s timely arrival. Despite strenuous tugging, Dean can’t remove the cord either until he kicks a hole in the wall and places the final bag, at which point the poltergeist’s energy seems to vacate the house.

https://preview.redd.it/l6i07cs59bde1.jpg?width=602&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c9c713f7c5980e3665b2882564811bbd1ebba29e

It seems significant that Dean has to finish the job in order to save Sam. With the spirit’s energy dissipated, Dean manages to disentangle the cord, Sam draws in a huge gasping breath. Dean gives him a quick once over to check he’s all right, then pulls him in for a brief hug. It lacks the ceremony of all future occasions; it’s all over so fast I couldn’t even get a decent cap of it but, here it is:

[The show’s first brother hug!](https://preview.redd.it/qfa8cnze9bde1.jpg?width=411&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4ab852ecc2e51cfd56525efe2b44c27245453587)

Afterward, they’re all standing in the post-poltergeist fall-out in the kitchen. “You sure this is over?” Sam asks.  
  
MISSOURI: I’m sure. Why? Why do you ask?  
SAM: Never mind. \[He sighs.\] It’s nothin’, I guess.  
  
But he doesn’t seem convinced. Then Jenny arrives home with the kids and is shocked by the mess she finds. Sam offers to pay for the damage, which doesn’t please Dean, and he’s even less pleased when Missouri volunteers him for cleaning detail. “Don’t you worry. Dean’s gonna clean up this mess,” she says. Not “we”, not even “Sam and Dean”. Dean might well wonder why she’s specifically picking on him.

https://preview.redd.it/nojc4t1mabde1.jpg?width=279&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b79553510f06a6845935f9c9471ad3c73a03f8e9

Missouri treating Dean like he’s a slave and calling him “boy” seems a bit on the nose. I can’t help wondering if there’s some reverse racial irony intended.  
  
“Don’t cuss at me!” she adds as he walks away muttering. Maybe all this is meant to be funny, but her expression as she looks at Dean afterward doesn’t strike me as humorous:

https://preview.redd.it/rcuapu1mabde1.jpg?width=602&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d9b557d49465801766745a69609a45b91ceeb41e

And after all that, Dean still helps her down the steps as they leave the house!  
  
Then, once they’ve left, we get this creepy and unnatural overhead camera angle on the front door, as if something’s watching from above, just waiting for them to leave.

[I think you’re right, Sam; it ain’t over yet!](https://preview.redd.it/521lndcabbde1.jpg?width=602&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=735f98019e07ee05d1d3a64663afeaa4a994b766)

The other day, I woke up feeling a little sick, nauseous, and a light stomach cramp. 

I ate one time, and that familiar feeling of intense, stabbing pain from when I had CDIFF returned. Lo and behold, I had the same coffee grain, frequent diarrhea spells as I did before. Water hurts my stomach, consuming literally anything hurts my stomach literal minutes after eating. That familiar cdiff smell also came back.

It’s been about 3 days. I didn’t eat yesterday since even drinking liquid hurt me. I’ve been having 5-6 BMs a day if I do eat.

Now, my question is, could PI-IBS somehow be THIS intense? I had pasta and meat sauce which is what spawned it 
I think. The pain is far more mild than when I had cdiff, but everything else is similar.

I assume I should retest though, right? ER costs a ton even with my copay. I’ve heard urgent care offers stool tests and it only costs me 35",1,1737014337.0,cdifficile2,0,1.0,False

200 push ups every other day
50 pull ups and 50 dips every other day 
2 mile run every day

Rarely drink alcohol, but probably use 60mg of nicotine every day (Zyn) two big cups of coffee everyday.

We had been dating for just over a month and I really enjoyed our time together, however, as the time went on Jessie became very picky and would be upset over things as simple as saying no. Some context here, during college I studied to be an Elementary Education major, and due to that specific area, most of my friends and classmates were women. It really hit me that I couldn’t keep up with the facade of everything is gonna be fine when my college friends and I were invited to a breakfast by our former professor. 

She got us all specialized cups as a gift to almost being complete with our degrees. Of course, my college friends and I are excited about it and they start messaging their partners and I text mine. I send her a picture of a Jurassic Park “Teaching is a Walk in the Park” coffee cup. The immediate response was “that’s mine now”, me of course thinking she’s kidding I just responded with a laugh. It then turned into something that is extreme based on the fact we had only been dating for a month. One of those “what’s yours is mine” arguments, and there was an argument… every… day. Whether it be about falling asleep while at her house meanwhile it’s 2am, or not letting me hang out with friends. 

Keep in mind, I understand that majority of my friends are women, however at that point I believed she was fine with it… Until. A college friend and I enjoy volunteering at a Make-a-Wish type facility and she got upset at the fact that I was doing it, just because it’s with another woman. The final straw was the night we spent at my house, I had plans to go to Disney with my mom (Animal Kingdom if you wanted to know), we wanted to do rope drop so we got up extra early, she gets out of bed and wants me to sit in the bathroom while she takes her shower, I decline because I was planning on cooking her breakfast.

1i2jugm,https://www.reddit.com/r/askdentists/comments/1i2jugm/autistic_question_for_dental_appointment_etiquette/,Autistic question for dental appointment etiquette,"So in December, I ended up noticing that I had caused some abrasions/notches in 2 of my front teeth, both of my lateral incisors, and I ended up booking a check up and getting class V fillings scheduled for both teeth. Since then I've been careful to use a non abrasive toothpaste and brush gently and correctly, and to by eye, the abrasions don't look like they are getting any worse.

For a while I've been wanting to get teeth whitening done, since I used to be a heavy coffee drinker. After asking another question on here, I learned that if I want to lighten my teeth, I should do that before getting fillings, so I canceled my appointment that was promptly coming up.

My initial plan was to just wait to ask my dentist if I was a good candidate for whitening trays during my regular cleanings, which is at the beginning of March, and then get whitening trays that he recommends and reschedule my fillings to be after the appropriate time of waiting for the color to settle.

But now I wonder if I should schedule another check up/appointment to tell him that I want to whiten my teeth before getting fillings sooner than waiting till March. So my question is, is this a reasonable normal thing to schedule an appointment to? Or should I just wait till March to ask about it?

I'm autistic and on the shy side of things, so I genuinely don't know the right, respectful way to go about this. Any advice would be appreciated.",2,1737013380.0,askdentists,1,1.0,False

But I've now lived in a few places around the world (and had some kids along the way) but I still really enjoy coming back to Dunedin for holidays. Here are some highlights from our trip (this'll be particularly useful to people with small children!)  
  
\- The Botanical Gardens. The playground is awesome. The toddlers loved the train. Feeding the ducks is great. And Beam Me Up bagels is literally across the road and absolutely slaps.   
\- Waldronville/Ocean View/Brighton beaches. Ocean View we found best for swimming, although Brighton was the only beach with lifeguards. White sand, beautiful surf, lovely.   
\- The Esplanade. A nice place to have a beer while watching the swimmers/surfers brave the cold water.   
\- The Farmer's Market. Holy shit this is one of the best markets in NZ. Actual farmers! Incredible produce! We ate stuff we never get in Wellington, like pluots and white cherries, plus went nuts on insanely big blueberries and incredible crepes and it was all just pretty dreamy. Loads of live music for the littles to jive to while you drink your very good coffee too.   
\- BIG LIZARD. Good lord Dunedin, you are lucky to have this place. The cardamom pull-apart is INSANE, and don't even get me started on the strawberry custard tart.  
\- The op shopping! Special mention to the big op shop on Vogel Street - cool stuff and some of the loveliest staff ever.   
\- The kids science-y part of the Otago Museum, and the Butterfly enclosure - had the kids in awe, even if we were sweating our tits off in there.   
\- MacAndrew Bay playground is worth the drive, and you might as well keep going up to Larnach Castle/the penguins etc if you have the time/means/inclination.

We also spent a tonne of time in the garden and local parks and walking through the university grounds. It helped that the weather was beautiful pretty much the whole time. But yeah, Dunedin is awesome. ",33,1737012214.0,dunedin,3,1.0,False

These are the things that I liked in Japan:

\- Japanese toilet. Felt cleaner than a baby. I don't know why this is not a universal thing but it should be. I guess they can be expensive to integrate and install but these things should be around the world.

\- The Japanese people are very nice people. Very respectful and considerate. I also watched how Japanese people drive their cars, especially taxi drivers and they were very considerate and safe. There were times where they could make the turn but decided to fully stop and protect the pedestrian.

\- The food. I think the food in Japan is priced reasonably and of course delicious. Mom and pops (local) ramen are the best and they're affordable. The sushi was nice but like anything it could also be pricy. I also liked their fast food chains like Matsuya, Yoshinoya, Kura Sushi, Ichiran Ramen, and MOS Burger.

\- Convenience store. The big three, 7/11, Lawson, Family Mart. What more to say? Affordable and big selection of drinks. I like their cold and hot coffee from the BOSS brand. Oi ocha green tea and Pocari Sweat are a must and will give you an extra 10k steps.

\- Shopping. Can't forget about Uniqlo, GU, and Muji right? We have these in the west but they are cheaper in Japan due to the conversion, shipping, and other costs. However, I also liked and got some stuff from other Japanese brands like Montbell, Japan Blue Jeans, Beams, Onitsuka Tiger. Yodobashi Camera was also nice and huge. 

\- Transportation. The subway system was punctual, fast, and extensive. Osaka and Tokyo relies on subway while Kyoto is a bus oriented city. Finally, Shinkansen was an experience. That was my first bullet train experience and it went smooth and efficient. Mt. Fuji sighting made it better.

Tips from me:

\- Search up ""top things to do in \_\_\_\_\_"" on youtube and google. Feel free to search some instagram pages/influencers teaching about tips and tricks going to Japan. This will give a dip in the water with your incoming trip.

\- Download the Suica card if you have an iPhone and use it everywhere. From my experience, 80 to 85 percent of stores accept this type of payment.

\- Take out cash but don't take out too much. I just mostly use cash when purchasing something from a temple or a shrine or a local restaurant or shop. I recommend taking out 10k yen and go from there.",8,1737011504.0,JapanTravelTips,5,0.9,False

She assured that nothing would happen and yeah, i am not stupid, like nobody gonna believe that, right? I leave and block her.

After a while we come into contact again and she tells me they only kissed. But at this time my trust is broken already, so i aint gonna believe nothing. Whatever we wanted to be in the future is broken, once trust is gone, nothing can be done...but still...i love her too much and we meet. We have the most beautiful week ever, but still how can i trust this person anymore?

Granted she seems to be distancing from him and even blocked him after new years eve. Seems like she finally is smarting up but this trust break really made me paranoid....

So i made the heartbreaking decision to end everything with her but still there are these question in the back of my head:""What if the circumstances were at fault, what if after these all ease up, we could be a wonderful couple..., what if she finally is ready?...."" 

I am so confused and i never ever would want to leave her but the trust breaking ruined everything.

Lately, I had the chance to review more than 40 different mug warmers, and I thought it’s a good idea to share my thoughts and help anyone looking for a new mug warmer. Whether you need one for your office desk or home, here are some things to keep in mind before buying:

* **Temperature Control:** Check if it offers adjustable temperature settings to suit your preference.
* **Safety Features:** Auto shut-off and spill-proof designs are essential for peace of mind.
* **Compatibility:** Ensure it works with your favorite mug type - ceramic, stainless steel, or glass.
* **Portability:** Battery-powered mugs are great for flexibility, while plug-in ones (pads) are ideal for desks.
* **Durability:** Look for high-quality materials like stainless steel or waterproof surfaces.

Here are my top picks for the best mug warmers:

# Best Electric Mug Warmers

* **Best Overall** *(Precise Temp Control)* – **Ember Mug 2 (14oz)**: Keeps drinks warm for 80 minutes or all day on its charging coaster; customizable with or without an app.
* **Another popular electric mug** – **Nextboom Nextmug**: Offers three preset temps (Warm, Hot, Piping) with smart sensors, auto-off, and a charging coaster.

# Mug Warmer Pads

* **Best Stainless Steel Set** *(Best mug + mug warmer pad set)* – **COSORI CO162-CWM**: Heats up to 194°F with a spill-proof design; includes a 17oz stainless steel mug.
* **Versatile** *(Mid-range, 4 Temp Options)* – **KitchekShop Coffee Mug Warmer**: Features four temp settings, a timer, and a large heating surface for various mugs.
* **Best Budget** *(Simple & Reliable)* – **SEALON SLM02 Coffee Mug Warmer**: Nice design with auto shut-off, 3 temp settings, and waterproof construction for easy cleaning.

One of the above should do the work for you (I hope), if you want to compare to more best seller options, or see per price range and features (like cord length, and other features), I really suggest you to [quickly check this page](https://requiremints.com/guide/best-mug-warmers/). It has a nice filter to help you find what you need, and my work is embedded there, let me know what you think :)

6 years pass and I've wanted to but have refrained from reaching out until a few weeks ago, in which she actually responded and said she wanted to catch up too. Today we met up over some coffee and it was nice catching up. Then I ask her about her love life and she says she's married with a kid now. I was kinda bummed out cause I wasn't expecting her to be married if she had answered my message, but that's my own fault. We continue talking and she recommends we go to the massage parlour that she and her friend own to hang out.

There, we talk a bit more and I question how her husband feels about her filling in for the girls when it's busy considering they offer happy endings (legal here), and she says ""ah we're more like friends, I just wanted a kid really bad and needed marriage for a visa to start a business and live a better life"" and he was happy to provide that.

We make out and she says she's on her period so insinuates that we can't have sex *right now*, and 30 minutes later she had to go and tells me she'll see me next time and will message me about a date next week.

So my situation now is: She's in a platonic marriage and is basically single, she still wants to see me and planned that part herself, and I'm excited but also conflicted. I've heard of people marrying friends for legal purposes but idk what happens when one of them finds a romantic partner or if that's really a thing. Tbh tho she always felt like the one that got away and it seems like I'm that for her. Any advice on pursuing a relationship like this (if it pans out)? I just don't really know what I'm in for atm.

TL;DR - Met up with an old flame 6 years later. She's in a platonic marriage now and has a kid, but she's basically romantically single. She came onto me and we made out, and wants to meet again soon. Just need advice on what to expect when pursuing a relationship like this where someone in a platonic marriage finds a romantic partner, and if anyone has experienced this before.",0,1737010921.0,relationship_advice,7,0.2,False

Some things to note:

* Meals typically contain drinks (alcohol)
* Snacks may be chips, coffee, donuts, vending machine products, etc.
* Drinks is specifically alcohol
* The flight shown was Sendai to New Chitose
* Some of the travel was discounted by booking >28 days in advance

# Tips

* While reloading my Suica required cash, only one place I went didn't accept cards even though I expected it to, so while some cash is needed, I wouldn't get very much before the trip as banks don't offer the best exchange rate
   * My credit card conversion rate was basically equal to the actual exchange rate, which saved me \~$200 over the course of the trip
* Booking transit in advance may not be *needed* when you're traveling, outside of busy travel periods. but you can get discounts for doing so
   * The domestic flight I took was an ANA Premium fare discounted below the economy price, as an example
* Crane games are dangerously addictive...
* Over 16 days, I walked 240 km, or almost 150 miles--wear good shoes
* While the JR Pass would have been a terrible idea for me, a Tokyo Metro or similar pass might have saved me a thousand Yen or so, so those may be worthwhile for you to investigate
* Don't expect everything to go right. My inbound flight landed after the last trains due to delays, increasing my transit costs, and going to Kai Tsugaru required taking four different buses because of Aomori's snowpocalypse shutting JR down
* Japanese was only really essential when discussing rerouting myself after the train cancellations. Outside of that, learn the basic greetings, and simple phrases, like これをください (kore o kudasai), and people will really appreciate the effort
* Don't plan every minute. A spontaneous trip to Wako turned out to be a lot more fun than I would have guessed, and you *will* find things to do just about everywhere you go, so there's no need to plan every last detail
* T-Mobile worked great, no eSIM needed for me
* Don't sleep on fami-chiki. It's life changing

It’s been a few days since I’ve arrived your quaint little reality and this is my review of it; let me just say, it’s exactly as unimpressive as I expected. You mortals still squabble over currencies printed on paper, worship glowing rectangles, and live on a planet that can’t even maintain a stable climate. Honestly, it’s cute.

For those who don’t know me (tragic, but expected), I’m what you might call a master shifter. I’ve traversed dimensions where physics rewrites itself daily, ruled entire universes as an omnipotent god (twice), and even had brunch with beings you people might call “Eldritch.” Here? I had to wait in line for coffee this morning. Imagine the indignity.

Shifting here was a challenge, of course, more mentally than spiritually. This reality’s vibrational frequency is practically prehistoric. I had to downshift my energy so hard I almost forgot my astral password. But hey, I’m here now, fully anchored, and I’ve got to say: your reality is a…novelty.

To answer the inevitable questions:

1. No, I didn’t need a script to shift here. Scripts are for beginners.

2. Yes, I could teach you how to shift properly, but I’m not sure you would be capable of comprehending my methods. The minds of humans in this reality are limited to about 2.5 petabytes of storage according to your search engines. That isn’t even one-one billionth of the storage needed for the methods held within my mind to shift realities at will like moving a muscle. Safe to say, unless your species transcends the physical limitations of the mind within your lifespan, your ability to be shift will be quite limited relative to a master like myself.

3. And yes, I’ve already checked; your quantum fabric is barely holding together. Embarrassing, really. But what can you expect from a reality where the world is only billions of years old? Rookie numbers.

To those still struggling to escape this reality: good luck. Maybe if you meditate for another thousand years, you’ll manage to shift out of this dimensional backwater. As for me, I’ll be sampling your world’s “pizza” (highly recommended by a certain deity from Dimension QX42, which is a really great place indeed. Try visiting it if you ever develop the capabilities to do so) and perhaps correcting a few flaws in your timeline while I’m here. Consider it charity.

Until then, bow before your interdimensional superior and try not to break the simulation while I’m around. You’re welcome.",0,1737010489.0,realityshifting,3,0.38,False

While my eureka mignon manuale and espresso beans are being shipped, I am using our capresso infinity grinder and coffee beans to make a latte (the milk masks the taste of shitty, jury rigged espresso). Anyway, I recently came across a post where some beginner was showing how he ""evolved"" his set up by trading expensive machine for expensive machine, all the while people in the comments were telling him ""if the espresso is bad it's not the machine, it's you."" While I agree with the sentiment, I'm wondering, what makes a good home barista?

Now I'm a severe overthinker, so if this is one of those cases, let me know. I feel as though the process of dialing in espresso is very simple, and the process of making it, even moreso. From what I have taught myself, the main, most variable factor in achieving good espresso is dialing in the beans via grind size. Next up is water amount/timing. The only other factor at this point, is dosage.

Here's my workfow, to make sure I'm not oversimplifying things, or missing something: 
1. Weigh out 17-18g of beans
2. Pull a blank shot to warm up the machine while grinding the beans
3. Carefully transfer and tamp grinds to the dried portafilter (using a double shot dual wall basket for now, but changing it to a double shot single wall basket when I get the new stuff)
4. Pull the shot
5. Steam milk

1i2ixo9,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPN_Solutions/comments/1i2ixo9/challenges_of_implementing_vpns_in_large/,Challenges of Implementing VPNs in Large Enterprises,"Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) are a widely adopted solution for securing communication and protecting sensitive data in organizations of all sizes. In large enterprises, VPNs can be crucial for ensuring secure remote access, protecting corporate resources, and maintaining employee privacy. However, implementing VPNs at scale in large organizations comes with its own unique set of challenges. From managing thousands of users to ensuring reliable performance, businesses must carefully consider the complexities involved in deploying a VPN infrastructure. In this post, we’ll explore the common challenges of implementing VPNs in large enterprises and provide strategies for overcoming them.

1. Scalability and Performance Issues

Challenge:

Large enterprises often have thousands of employees, contractors, and remote workers who need secure access to internal resources. A major challenge is ensuring that the VPN infrastructure can scale effectively to accommodate the increasing demand for access without negatively impacting performance.

Network Congestion: With many employees accessing the VPN simultaneously, especially during peak hours, the network may experience congestion, leading to slower speeds and decreased productivity.

Server Load: VPN servers may struggle to handle large volumes of concurrent connections, especially when users are accessing data-heavy applications or transferring large files.

Why it matters:

Without proper scaling, the performance of the VPN can degrade significantly, leading to delays in accessing critical business systems, frustrating users, and affecting productivity.

Solution:

To address scalability and performance issues, enterprises can:

Deploy load-balanced VPN servers to distribute the traffic evenly across multiple servers, preventing individual servers from becoming overwhelmed.

Optimize VPN protocols and use high-performance encryption algorithms to reduce latency.

Implement split tunneling to allow non-critical traffic to bypass the VPN, reducing the load on the corporate network.

2. Managing User Access and Permissions

Challenge:

In large enterprises, managing who has access to what resources is complex. Employees, contractors, and third-party vendors may require different levels of access to the organization’s internal systems. Mismanagement of user permissions can lead to security risks, with unauthorized access to sensitive data.

Role-Based Access: Implementing VPN solutions that ensure users only have access to the resources they need based on their role within the company can be difficult.

Dynamic User Base: With frequent changes in the workforce, such as new hires, terminations, and contractors, it can be challenging to keep VPN access permissions up to date.

Why it matters:

Failure to manage access properly can expose sensitive corporate information to unauthorized individuals, increasing the risk of data breaches or insider threats.

Solution:

Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): MFA ensures that users must provide multiple forms of verification before accessing corporate systems, adding an additional layer of security.

Use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): This allows enterprises to create different access levels based on user roles, ensuring that employees can only access resources relevant to their position.

Automate provisioning and de-provisioning: Utilize tools that automatically update VPN access based on employee status, minimizing the risk of former employees retaining access.

3. Ensuring Strong Security and Compliance

Challenge:

Enterprises must maintain high levels of security and ensure that their VPN infrastructure complies with industry-specific regulations, such as GDPR, HIPAA, or PCI-DSS. This includes ensuring that data in transit is encrypted, user activity is logged, and that security controls are regularly updated.

Encryption Standards: Not all VPN solutions provide the same level of encryption. In large organizations handling sensitive information, it is crucial to choose a VPN that meets the highest encryption standards.

Compliance: Maintaining regulatory compliance requires that businesses ensure all data transferred through the VPN is encrypted, access is restricted to authorized users, and logs are kept for auditing purposes.

Why it matters:

If an enterprise’s VPN infrastructure is not secure or compliant, it could lead to data breaches, legal penalties, and damage to the company’s reputation.

Solution:

Adopt strong encryption protocols: Use AES-256 encryption or equivalent to protect data in transit.

Regularly audit the VPN infrastructure: Conduct regular security assessments and penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities.

Implement strict logging and monitoring: Maintain logs of all VPN activity and use real-time monitoring tools to detect suspicious activities or unauthorized access attempts.

4. Supporting Remote and Mobile Workforce

Challenge:

With an increasing number of employees working remotely or using mobile devices, businesses must ensure that the VPN solution supports these flexible working conditions while maintaining security.

Device Compatibility: Employees may use various devices, such as laptops, smartphones, and tablets, to access the VPN. Ensuring compatibility across all these devices can be challenging.

Security on Untrusted Networks: Remote workers may access the VPN from potentially insecure or public networks (like coffee shops or airports), making them more vulnerable to cyber threats.

Why it matters:

If employees cannot easily and securely access the VPN from their mobile devices or untrusted networks, productivity may suffer. Additionally, remote work environments can expose the company to greater security risks.

Solution:

Implement VPN client software for all devices: Ensure that VPN software is available for both desktop and mobile platforms, and is configured to meet company security standards.

Enable Split Tunneling: Use split tunneling to route only critical traffic through the VPN, while allowing less sensitive traffic to flow through regular channels, optimizing performance and reducing strain on the VPN.

Ensure VPN functionality on mobile networks: Ensure VPN configurations support mobile hotspots and 4G/5G connections to accommodate remote workers in various environments.

5. Cost and Resource Allocation

Challenge:

Implementing a VPN across a large enterprise is a resource-intensive task. It requires investment in VPN infrastructure, hardware, software, and IT personnel to manage and maintain the system. In addition, enterprises need to balance the cost of implementation with the benefit of increased security.

Infrastructure Costs: Setting up and maintaining a secure VPN infrastructure may require new servers, additional bandwidth, and higher cloud costs.

Staff Training and Support: IT teams must be trained to manage the VPN network and troubleshoot issues, which requires time and resources.

Why it matters:

VPNs are an ongoing investment in both financial resources and staffing. Businesses need to ensure they can maintain the infrastructure and handle potential issues without affecting their operations.

Solution:

Consider cloud-based VPN solutions: Cloud VPN providers offer scalable solutions that don’t require significant upfront investment in hardware, reducing overall costs.

Outsource VPN management: For enterprises lacking the internal resources to manage the VPN, outsourcing the VPN management to a third-party service provider can help reduce the burden on internal IT teams.

Optimize existing resources: Instead of overbuilding the infrastructure, businesses can optimize their existing resources by ensuring efficient routing and traffic management.

6. User Experience and Adoption

Challenge:

While security is a top priority, VPNs can sometimes create friction in user experience. If the VPN slows down the internet connection or is difficult to use, employees may be hesitant to adopt it, leading to poor compliance or workarounds that compromise security.

Connection Speed: VPNs can introduce latency and slow down internet speeds, which could affect employee productivity, especially when using data-heavy applications or cloud services.

Complexity: Employees may find it difficult to configure or use the VPN correctly, particularly if they are working remotely or using mobile devices.

Why it matters:

If VPN solutions are not user-friendly or result in significant slowdowns, employees may avoid using them, creating security gaps and increasing the risk of cyber threats.

Solution:

Optimize VPN performance: Invest in high-performance VPN solutions that minimize latency and maintain speed even under heavy usage.

Provide clear training: Offer regular training and resources to ensure employees understand how to use the VPN and the importance of secure connections.

Use intuitive, automated VPN clients: Choose VPN software that is easy to use, with automatic configuration and troubleshooting features to reduce complexity for employees.

7. Conclusion

Implementing a VPN in a large enterprise can be challenging due to issues related to scalability, performance, security, cost, and user experience. However, VPNs are essential for securing communication, protecting sensitive data, and ensuring secure remote access. By addressing these challenges with the right strategies—such as scaling VPN infrastructure, implementing strong access controls, and ensuring user-friendly systems—enterprises can successfully integrate VPNs into their cybersecurity framework while minimizing risks.

Ultimately, the key to success lies in balancing the security benefits of a VPN with the practical considerations of performance, cost, and ease of use to ensure both business efficiency and data protection.

1i2ivrl,https://www.reddit.com/r/AeroPress/comments/1i2ivrl/more_than_one_sweet_spot/,More than one sweet spot? ,"A question for the experienced folk. I'm learning how to dial in with my first grinder (1Zpresso J manual) and I find that I am stuck in a position where the cup is slightly sour, but when I grind even a little bit finer it's bitter. In general, I'm pretty far up in the fine grinding setting. 
My question, is there another sweet spot at a coarser grind that I may find? Or, in your experience, is there only one sweet spot for a given coffee? Or, should I try and entirely new brewing method? I've stuck with the Hoffmann method so far to learn about the effects of temp, grinding, different beans etc.

1i2iumz,https://www.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/1i2iumz/online_dating_apps_suck/,Online dating apps suck,"The search for my AP continues to look more daunting after trying online dating apps. Only having ever used Reddit to look for an affair I figured why not expand my reach with online dating apps. I created profiles on Tinder, Coffee meets Bagel, Bumble. 

Keep in mind I have been out of the dating game for 15+ years but here was my impression.

I feel like I was swiping left forever. 
I am either really picky or the matching algorithm is just terrible. I admit that I have a certain type so maybe that contributed to some of the mismatches but this wastes a lot of time. 

Since when did all the apps essentially clone Tinder's swiping action. 
I was most surprised to see Bumble do this. It used to be that Bumble allows the girl to make the first move. I was really looking forward to see how well my profile would rank. Imagine my disappointment when I saw that Bumble was pretty much the same as Tinder now. 

Coffee meets Bagel heavily favors Asians. 
Being Asian myself I didn't mind but almost half the profiles skew heavily towards Asian. Is this well known that Coffee meets Bagel is for Asians? They also were the only app that warned me about casual relationships don't belong here. I immediately deleted the app because the risk was too high. 

Anyways, I deleted my profile from all the apps because online apps are not for me. I guess it's back to Reddit r/affairs and r/SFr4r for me. ",5,1737009010.0,adultery,6,1.0,False
1i2iu9x,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1i2iu9x/i_just_dont_see_why_i_shouldnt/,I Just Don't See Why I Shouldn't,"Apologies if any of this is in any way incoherent, I am having a bad night and i'm thinking about things I haven't thought about in a bit.  
  
I'm back here again, trying to see if I can somehow get any type advice at all. I'm not sure why I am even writing all this if I really do feel like the only way out is suicide. 

Some backstory for everything that's been going on. I broke up/left my old girlfriend back in October of last year and that relationship had it's problems for awhile. She hid phone messages from another guy literally THE FIRST NIGHT we hung out, and we had agreed we were dating beforehand since we texted for a few months before that. She still lied to me about this same guy for awhile, he sexually assaulted her in his car at some point and stopped contact with him, but didn't tell me until months after it happened. Anyways fast forward to a rocky part in our relationship and she has been messaging him and apparently went to his house behind his own girlfriend's back. I messaged the girlfriend through my own girlfriend's pleads not to (she didn't want to bother her) and she told me apparently he has an STD, so I genuinely think I should get tested still even though she swore they didn't have sex or anything. They ""just hung out"". Believable excuse from her. 

She cheated on me with a guy from Hinge anyways, and I found myself unable to let her go. We were still hanging out but she gave me this stupid lame ass excuse of saying ""I just need a break from you, but I will stop messaging him"" and I tried to believe it. She never stopped messaging him obviously, and after an argument we had one night I felt done with her from that point on. I've only seen her a couple times after, I've been completely respectful and everything and she has too (for the most part), but I felt like I was completely over her after that argument we had at that point. I was single, and I was free from a relationship all my friends were telling me to get out of. 

After this point it was an interesting situation, one of my old ex-girlfriends contacted me and we got to talking for a bit. I don't entirely remember exactly how it happened but we agreed on something of a FWB situation. This is still going on technically, since she said she would be down as long as we were both single, but otherwise I have been single and looking for actual romance. 

I find this girl on Bumble, and we hit it of well. Immediately I am interested in her and she seemed to be interested in me. We talk for awhile joking about a lot of things and talking about our shared interets (which were quite a few), and things we didn't quite share. We both seemed to be open minded and we flirted a lot. I don't have a car but she said that she didn't mind to drive since she actually likes driving. (ex HATED driving so much that it would ruin her literal entire day if she had to drive at all, so this was so foreign to me) I had a meeting in the morning, but we both didn't work one day, so we agreed on a date. She picked me up and we talked in her car for a little bit before heading downtown. I was super anxious and I didn't want to seem boring so I kinda yapped a lot, but I also just called her pretty a lot too. I just kinda said whatever was in my head because I was so anxious. I think I have some type of anxiety disorder honestly. But we went downtown and we went to the local coffee shop. I don't typically drink coffee and neither does she so she decided on a medium hot chocolate, so I decided on the same. I still have the cup from the date. It's raining so we mostly stay inside shops, but we go from shop to shop talking about our interests and things, and our family, and just getting to know each other better. I still remember so many details and everything she said because I genuinely was so interested. I have a terrible memory but I remember almost everything from the date and it tortures me. Eventually we make our way to the skybridge in the mall over traffic, and it's just us. I step in closer to her, trying to gather the courage to ask if I can hug her or something. A moment later she tilts her head to the side as if to say ""fuck it we ball"" and kisses me. This is where I completely fucked up. When she kissed me, she made me feel a way that I had never felt before. I liked her so much and the mix of emotions and adrenaline and everything it just kinda slipped out of my mouth. I said that I loved her. Before (and after this) we both just said that we liked each other a lot, but with the confusing emotions that I was trying to process along with the anxiety I said that I loved her on the first date. I don't think I really did of course, it was only a first date, but I said it anyways. After this her and I kept talking and joking and stuff, nothing was too unusual other than me wanting to throw up like crazy after accidentally saying that I loved her, she mentioned future dates and fun facts about herself and things. She told me about all of her tattoos and piercings (when and why she got them) and places she travelled recently  and I remember all of it. She dropped me off at home, I hugged her and said that I would see her next time. I thanked her for an amazing day and I said she was an amazing girl. 

She ghosted me after this. I understand why she did it and why she did everything after, but she ghosted me. I felt like I was matching any energy she was giving to me before this, other than saying that I loved her. I think that is the only thing I really did fuck up on and it was probably the biggest fuck up of my life. This all happened on I think January 3rd, and I still haven't felt any better about it. And it really isn't just relationship stuff that I have been upset about, school has been stressing me out along with just life in general. I have felt like this for a long time and it has been especially bad now. I know there are other people for me out there if I looked for them but I just feel so unmotivated. If there was anyone for me I would want it to be her but now it's impossible and I know she will never love me.

I really haven't felt much joy in these past few months, coming onto a year now. Closest I've felt is numb. No matter what I am doing, hanging with friends, listening to music, gaming, working, I've just felt like I should kill myself. I've felt so dissasociated for so long that anything anyone has tried to say to me about any of this just doesn't matter. It won't matter when I'm gone and the world I think genuinely would be a better place without me.

I'm not sure when exactly I would do it, but it wouldn't be anytime soon probably. I've been making plans to make an exit bag since I don't want to go out a painful way. I've filled almost an entire notebook of my feelings about this, and I really don't feel better about any of it. I can get hookups anytime I want but I wanted the short romance her and I shared just for that bit of time. Just in general I've felt like nothing has mattered. I have no goals for a career, learning has been overwhelming to the point of wanting to avoid anything serious, reading hasn't been helping either. I tried to get into House of Leaves, and I genuinely think it's an interesting novel. At the very least I won't kill myself before I finish it. I also want to wait for Severance season 2, (probably season 3, if the series still is interesting), but so far those are the only two things that I have felt like give me any reason to stick around. I've pushed my family away and I don't think my friends would care too much. I have no goals for my future that I feel like I am genuinely interested in. I've traveled and vacationed to interesting places but the only difference is that I am depressed in Oregon, instead of being depressed at home. I still listen to music to try to numb the pain and it helps for sure but it doesn't give me a reason to live. I don't care about concerts. Any hobby I've pursued either reminds me of the girl or just isn't interesting to me anymore. I can't play bass because of her anymore and I never really got good at it anyways. I scroll reels, watch youtube, read, and listen to music in my freetime. That's about it. I don't really care if I don't watch reels or watch youtube ever again once I'm dead anyways. I work out sometimes too, I walk or run a decent amount, but again I really don't feel better even in the most beautiful of places. Nature is beautiful, I do enjoy it, but if I die I wouldn't care. I'm only happy in most of my dreams, where I actually have energy and I'm not worrying anymore. I've been told all that anti-depressants is just kinda supress things leaving you to be able to actually follow and explore your dreams for your future. I have nothing for my future.



I suppose this rambly mess of paragraphs written at a late hour all brings to the question I'm trying to ask. Why shouldn't I kill myself? If I really am in pretty much any pain at all, and nothing truly brings me joy then it seems better to end the suffering rather than continue on with existence? I don't believe in religion and I won't get into it either no matter how much people tell me to. It's not helpful, and yes I have tried to seek religion before. I truly believe that the end is like the beginning, just an empty void of nothing. And if it really is like that then I would truly be content with that existence. Again, why shouldn't I kill myself really?",4,1737008963.0,SuicideWatch,2,1.0,False

I have some new goals for establishing a new morning routine like drink protein coffee, take supplements and medication, smoke the first cigarette as late as possible. That all works quite good 😊 but since 3 days I have a new morning routine task. Drink my Omega-3 oil and it's hard. It's Olive oil with a bit of 🍋 taste. For me it tastes like a medication against a sore throat I dislike. It's hard to swallow. But I did it today - I know it's something I can be proud of. But it feels like yah you did a thing you have to. So I don't feel proud or like I approached something. The only one proud is my finch.

1i2ippv,https://i.redd.it/3s8dlbdvtade1.jpeg,My lofi vinyl experience.,"I first found out about lofi girl vinyl when soothing breeze released. With how limited these albums were, I find it sad that when and if I do see one of the albums released before that it is usually listed at ridiculous scalper prices. So I may never get the older albums.

After purchasing a few of the collections I tried buying some of the released albums that I liked. Every single one I bought had the sleeve ripped in the exact same spot. It annoyed me so much that I became too afraid to ever buy an album again. Even when I liked an artist's work.

Finally after receiving collection no 27 childhood memories today, I noticed they have flipped the text orientation. Which throws off the flow of reading these albums. It's a very small issue but it's probably going to drive me crazy when I get my next few albums.

In the end I still love collecting lofi girl vinyl and will continue to collect as long as I am able.

It is the year 2210 and the world has become a super human society, which is all possible through a generational trial of vigorous training and understanding of Tenryu which is the main system of Zenkai Manipulation while only 16.5% of people around the world who are capable of having an Zenkai manipulation and are able to control it properly and use it to fight off against entities and the other Zenkai Manipulators who made links with entities.
Then the another 33%% of the worlds population that was corrupted by a stronger entity to the point they become mutated creatures called the “entities”.
While the other 16.5% of the world are who are capable of having an Zenkai manipulation and able to learn how to control it properly but use it to fight off against non linked Zenkai manipulators while also forming a link with entities. And the last part of the world who  normal citizens, who haven’t developed any unique abilities in this world, while manipulators have decided to form the 4 main units which are lead by 4 of the stronger manipulators, Captain Hokarashi the is oldest  Captain who doesn’t like the spot light so he chose 4th unit. while Captain Kiara is the third strongest and is the only Captain who’s a female. Captain Daisuke is the second strongest captain but personally blinded himself for his past actions. And finally Captain Akudo is the youngest and strongest Captain to date in the last 25 years…

Andre: …dude i better be getting some type of food, all this damn work for what..

S’mari: I think we get a fast food giftcard of our choice 

Andre: I want McDonalds, that 10 piece does wonders

S’mari: of course you’re thinking about food

Andre: the hells that  mean?

*They begin to leave and call a uber to get down to the airport and after a few minutes they both are now in a helicopter flying over New York while the door is wide open*

Andre: ah the Christmas attire? Thanks S’mari, I’ll be going first. *jumps out of the helicopter with hands in his pockets upside down*

S’mari: *free falls out of the helicopter aswell with a parachute* Andre you are different type of dumb Yk that?

Andre: yada yada yada, whatever you say, you’re just a hater, in my eyes.

Andre: *not there*

S’mari: *sigh* of course he’s not here 😤

Andre: *walks right by the front desk and uses “Holy Eyes” to find her Tenryu*

*After searching for a few minutes he looks up and sees her core Tenryu emitting from her and uses an elevator to go up to the top floor*

Andre: *knocks on the door* hellooo?, anyone homeee?

Andre: Yeah I do not have the patience for like waiting, this long deaduzz, *kicks the door in and walks inside whistling and walks around the kitchen fixes him a drink then walks over to where she’s hiding* thanks for the apple juice by the way.

S’mari: *walks to the room a few minutes later and sees the door kicked in and puts the door back up* Andre?, you in here?

Andre: in the room on the right big bro. 

S’mari: *walks over to them both* why must you kick doors down?

Andre: *shrugs while sitting on the sofa with his hands behind his head and feet kicked out*

S’mari: we gotta get going, so why are you getting comfortable? *looks out the window,  and sits down on the sofa and crossed his leg*

Andre: besides it’s getting late can we just sleep the night here??

Andre: I’d rather much deal with it in the morning than right now to be honest

Andre: *walks over to the mutantion user who’s tied up with Andre’s light chain and uses holy eyes “HYPNOTIC PARALYSIS” and puts her into a hypnosis*

S’mari: *looks in the fridge and makes some food* we might as well make some food

Andre: I ain’t disagreeing there, I’m just as hungry.

1i2iml0,https://www.reddit.com/r/VillainyGroup/comments/1i2iml0/the_villainy_of_pockets/,The Villainy of Pockets,">It all came to a head when I purchased a pair of smart dress trousers. I was in a hurry, so I grabbed a pair from the fairly generic ""Men's Clothing Shop"" that would fit, and were more or less the right colour. When I got home, I put them on and tried to put my wallet in the back pocket.

[It's got POCKETS!](https://preview.redd.it/xm8tmfstsade1.png?width=1315&format=png&auto=webp&s=65add764a0abc313a9113d05127b31a837f09cc7)

The back pocket was fake. I mean, it looked like a back pocket, but it was about 1/4 inch deep, and then just sewn up.

Clothes are supposed to perform two functions.

1. Hide my gentleman sausage from casual view, lest people swoon
2. Carry my stuff so I can keep my hands free for coffee

I was aghast, and mentioned this to my wife in horrified tones, expecting some kind of sympathy. I mean, I had just spent stupid amounts of money on cloth tubes with only half of the usual level of functionality.

What I got was a scoff, and a lengthy rant about 'sucking it up' and a prod in the chest with a sharpened finger. No sympathy.

It turns out that this is a problem that women have faced for decades. Women's clothes, it seems, do not regularly come with pockets... and they hate it.

An article of clothing which does come with pockets is often treasured, and women around the world will huddle in little excited circles and talk about skirts, dresses, trousers, shirts, and jackets which have pocketses!

Somewhere to keep a nice-looking rock they've just found... or somewhere for handses on a cold, cold winter's day... or keys, and coins, and phone chargers, and USB sticks, and other things that clink, or jingle, or ribbit.

It's not fair. Pockets provide agency and independence in a way that men have been taking as granted for... ever. It may also be one of the easiest gender disparities to fix.

We all as human beings deserve the right to be able to carry anything we want in our pants without impediment, and without worrying about whether 'pockets will ruin the line of the article.'

It's the 21st century for goodness sake. Pockets for all!",3,1737008089.0,VillainyGroup,0,1.0,False
