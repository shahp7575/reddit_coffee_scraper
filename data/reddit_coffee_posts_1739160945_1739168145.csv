Is it odd to have these hard edges against the black background? Should I soften them?

I was doing alright, but then I very unexpectedly got into a shitty life situation and had to move back to my hometown and start all over, and the whole situation has been a huge drain on finances. I’m disabled and my chronic pain has been getting worse, so my job options are very limited. I am still looking for a job, but since I moved I’ve been doordashing, donating plasma, selling my art, and stealing anything in good condition from my estranged mother’s abandoned storage (it’s not really stealing…my dad who owns the property it’s on gave me permission and there’s no chance in hell she’ll ever come back to my state after all these years to take it back) to make ends meet. 

Now, I’ve only been able to buy groceries once in the past month and a half (and only $17 worth at that). Luckily, I found tons of freeze dried, canned, and vacuum sealed food on one of my trips to the storage property, so I have freeze dried milk and vegetables and soup, plus my grandma sends me home with eggs from her chickens and a few things from her pantry when I visit. 

The other day, I paid my rent and bills for the month and realized I had enough for gas AND some groceries, but obviously I wanted to make it stretch. So, I went to my city’s subreddit and found a post where another poor person was asking where to get groceries, and someone mentioned this farmer’s market less than 20 mins away from me that I happen to pass all the time because it’s in the zone doordash always takes me to. It said they have a promotion on Sundays where you can fill up a planter bucket with up to 4 pounds of any produce of any price for $6, so I went today. 

They were out of buckets when I got there, so I figured I’d just ask at the register. All the produce was GIANT, and almost everything looked super high quality. I got a little nervous thinking it would be more expensive than I’d expected, but decided to get a few things anyway since I’d already spent the gas to get there. I got 5 red potatoes, 5 HUGE apples, 4 oranges, a big avocado, a carrot for no other reason than the fact that they were all literally the size of eggplants, a tomato, a red onion, two green peppers, and a bag of kumquats. They had also marked all the bread made only two days ago 50% off, so I got two giant loaves of homemade sourdough, and they have these insulated bags with their logo on it for $10, and every time you bring it back you get 10% off everything, and it’s a stackable discount, so I got one of those. As a little treat for myself since I’ve been basically living off freeze dried chili for the past month, I got a bag of pita chips and a tub of hummus that were on sale. 

I get to the register and before I can even ask about the buckets, the lady whips one out and puts all my most expensive per pound produce in it. I can clearly see on the scale that it exceeds the weight that the $6 bucket sale is supposed to cover, and again, before I can say anything, she rips the tag off of the bag without recording it and says “I’m so glad you brought your bag today! Now your 10% discount will stack with the bucket sale!” She only records one loaf of bread, making them $1.50 EACH, and my total ends up being $20 and some change. I guess she knew I needed a blessing today. 

Here’s where the title comes in. 

I get home. Unload my groceries. And make myself a sandwich (the $17 grocery haul from before consisted of deli cheese, deli meat, cooking oil, and some vegetables). I’m still hungry, but that’s the best thing I’ve eaten in SO LONG. I eat an apple. I eat a piece of straight up bread with butter. I eat the hummus with the pita chips. I eat an orange. I eat more hummus with half the carrot. I eat some kumquats. I eat another piece of butter bread. I feel HORRIBLE because i know I’ll beat myself up for it when I run out of fresh food and have to go back to powdered chili… but i literally just can’t stop. I’m so full it hurts. I drink some water and go lie down. I don’t remember falling asleep, but i literally slept the entire rest of the afternoon in a food coma. I woke up at 9:30 PM. And what do I do? Make myself a cup of coffee, eat some more kumquats, some more hummus with the other half of the carrot, and another piece of butter bread. 

This situation I’m in paired with regular old seasonal depression has shot me down so hard. My sleep is already fucked, I missed church for the third week in a row this morning because I couldn’t sleep all night as per usual. I’m practically nocturnal most days. So I decided when I woke up at 9 to try and stay up all night and finish the renovations on my bathroom (because it was such incredibly short notice and I desperately needed the discount, I’m in the place I’m staying under the condition that I renovate it while I’m here back to a livable standard so that it can be rented out at full price once I’m gone, it’s pretty trashed) but it’s almost midnight and I am glued to my bed. My stomach hurts so bad. I feel like the joy of eating real food for the first time in forever blinded me into eating myself to death. I’m a pretty scrawny guy in the first place too, so it’s not like I had room for it. I’m just waiting for my body to decide it’s time to vomit. 

tl;dr: I got a ridiculous discount on fresh groceries by the grace of God after living on freeze dried soup for over a month and got so excited I ate myself into a food coma. ",3,1739167194.0,stories,0,1.0,False

I don't want to respond, and I am also worried what he might do if I don't.

I've struggled since I became an adult to figure out how my biological father can fit into my life. We have different morals, ethics, and ideals. I finally asked him to go to therapy with me last year, and things were improving. We were addressing boundaries, communication, and respect. I have ADHD and Autism, he was diagnosed as a sociopath when I was a teenager.

We had a therapy assignment to go out to dinner together for the second time. I arrived at the restaurant at the time agreed upon and called him to let him know I had arrived. He told me he was out shopping for a new fridge! There was no text, no phone call, nothing. It was during rush hour, I had a two-hour window of time to meet with him, and he told me he would be on his way shortly. 45 minutes later, I decided to close my tab and order my food to go.

That was in October 2024.

The following therapy session, he ended up raising his voice at me, telling me what I was feeling was ""bullshit"", and rolled his eyes at me. I ended up walking out of the therapy session and dealt with heaps of guilt and grief following that event.

January 2025 he sent me the following letter -- I'm not correcting his typos:

\-----

*November 18, 2024*

*My Dearest \[FULL NAME\] (NICKNAME)*

*When you were born your mom and I were elaited.  We had tried to no avail to conceive for years, and had finally given up. You were a Godsend.  Our Lord couldn’t have prepaired us for what was to follow, you see you were born with a cleft pallet which meant many things. We had to learn how to feed you. You couldn’t suck milk out of the bottle. We had to buy squeezable bottles, burn a larger hole in the nipple so that we could squeeze enough into your mouth. This works preety well but you were also swallowing a lot of air, which gave you gas. You were always suffering gas pains. The good Lord made it easier for us in so far as your mom worked nights and I days so that you were always attended. So many worries and memories.*

*November 20, 2024*

*I’ve prayed to God on how to start this next chapter.*

*You have chosen to reject me, my love, and how much I care. However you will never destroy how much I love you, and always will. Our relationship when you were a child was filled with wonder and joy. The fact is that our first connection was before you were born. Your mom and I were in the living room talking and you became very active in there. I reached out my hand and laid it on your mom’s belly and you took your little hand and traced the outline of my hand. This gave me a feeling so good I cannot describe it. I knew that you were reaching out to me. After you were born and during the many times you suffered from colic, I would lay you down on my stomach and sing to you. You always found the sound of my voice soothing and you would fall asleep, and I would feel blessed.* 

*December 1st*

*It’s been awhile since I was here last. So many things keeping us busy. I apologize.*

*I remember the first time you walked to me. You were crawling to the end of the coffee table and used it to stand up. You were only about 2 ½ feet from me. I held my hands toward you, gave you encouragement and you squeeled and walked into my embrace. I was so proud of you.I remember you and \[CHILDHOOD DOG\] playing on the floor. He was so protective of you. When I would blow raspberries on your stomach and make you giggle with delight he would get a bit upset until he realized it was fun. The three of us would often take walks to the park, you were in the stroller.*   

*I once carried you up to the top of a half round climber made of 1” tubbing, and \[CHILDHOOD DOG\] climbed up to sit with us. That was the day we found out Snuffy was a climber. As a toddler you and I were very happy. As you grew older things started to change.*

*Do you remember my aquariums? We used to buy cooked popcorn shrimp and feed my largest fish together. We would even eat some of the shrimp together. Then one day you wouldn’t eat the shrimp anymore because your mother told you that they were the cocroaches of the ocean. She must have also educated you on what cocroaches are. Then there was the time that your Uncle \[NAME\], my friend \[NAME\], and I went hunting, and your mother told you I was going to kill Ruldolf’s Daddy. The next thing was that you would no longer eat anything with bones in the meat.*

*I fondly remember when you were in preschool. I still have your best dad award that you made for me. You were so proud when you graduated. I believe, from the progress reports we received from your teachers, that you were among the brightest in their class. I’ve always been so proud of your accomplishments.*  

*As you got older I was amazed at how you resolved your \[PHYSICAL DISABILITY\] problems.*

*Being a man of faith, when you started to mature, I knew that it was time to introduce you to my Lord Jesus. We’ve already talked this one out so I’ll say no more.* 

*When you were getting into your pre-teens or early teens, and your body was developing into womanhood, there were times when the boys around you were not very nice. And because of your \[PHYSICAL DISABILITY\] you were feeling insecure. Our solution was to enter into marshal arts together,  I found a Sensae that would teach you ways to overcome your insecurities, and we began training together. I have fond memories of us going through our forms together, and with the “Pong” staffs too.*

*During this time my PTSD was ragging and I started going back to therapy. I was struggling with a failing career due to a failing body.* 

*I don’t know where I got the energy to complete the basement, then the bathroom, and finally the kitchen. During this time your mother and I grew apart, why I didn’t know. I always always gave her my love. However during the last 5 years of our marriage she threatened me with divorce 3 times, but on the 4th time I caved in and said do your worst. We’ve already talked that one out too, so I’ll not go there further.*

*December 23, 2004*

*I’m sorry that this is taking so long. What I’m finding, more now than ever before, is that my pain levels dictate how much I can accomplish on any given day. Opening my heart to you has also been a roller coaster of emotions. Sometimes I have to back away.* 

*After your mother and I separated you went into a blue funk. You became severly depressed. Even though I was living 60 miles away I came back to show you how much I cared and loved you at least every other day. I saw how depressed you were especially in your school grades.  We talked about what was happening and agreed that you needed an incentive. So I agreed that if you graduated with a B+ or better I’d give you a car for graduation. I’ve always had your back and gave all the love and support I could.*

*I love you more than you can know and always will.*

*You can shut me out of your life, but I’ll never stop loving you. During your teens and afterwards I saw in you an attitude change. You would constantly take me out of context, warp what I was saying and fly off emotionally at me. I apologize for not being very tactfull. I was never taught to be anything but truthfull.*

*In so far as your professional life goes, I’m very proud of your accomplishments. However, in your description and attitudes of your personal life goes, I cannot embrace the path your on.  Being “\[GENDER NON-CONFORMING\]” as you refere it to, sounds to much like todays Woke way of saying it’s ok. I’ve always held my convictions on your being \[SEXUAL PREFERENCE\]. It’s your life. You make these decisions. I cannot and will not say that living in sin is ok.*

*That decision is between you and God that made you.* 

*In so far as your hyper sensitivity goes, I don’t have to validate your emotions, you need to learn to regulate them.*   

*From here on forward I’ll not bother you because that will just piss you off.  My heart, My door, My life are open to you because I love you more than you hate me.*

Then the letter ends, no closing, no signature. It just ends. It should also be noted my birthday was during the timespan he was writing this letter, and not once does he pause to wish me a happy birthday.

There's no apology for not communicating with me on that last day. No accountability. Just one big revision of history that almost worked until he told me he didn't have to validate my emotions.

I've since learned from various people in his life he was NEVER faithful to my mom, he wanted my mom to have an abortion, and likely killed my childhood dog.

So, dear reader, how would you respond? I'm seeking ""validation for my hypersensitivity"". I've repeatedly put myself in the path of his emotional abuse for decades with the belief he could be a good man, or that I could change him because I was his daughter, and I finally broke the cycle.",2,1739166974.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

I am very introverted and haven't had a friend in a long time. He is very social and we get along great; we usually dance together at class, and tend to meet up for coffee or lunch once or twice a week, and walk around talking for an hour or two. We've gone Christmas shopping for his kids together, and he's very easy to be around. 'John' has never asked me if I'm married or dating or interested in such. If we had a nice class he'll usually text me saying how nice it was to dance together. 

Dancing is very physical, which I'm not used to, and my friend has a tendency to play with my hair or pull me in for a hug, and he likes dancing close together. He asked me to be his 'date' to a more advanced and 'saucy' Latin dance class but he was understanding when I said no. After our previous class he said that the last dance we did was one of the most enjoyable dances he'd had, and I know I felt him put a little kiss on my shoulder. 

I'm panicking a little because I really like 'John' and I don't want there to be romantic intention in the first friendship I've had in years. I'm not interested in dating or romance with anybody, ever. The few times I've dated previously, it was because the guy and me were friends and then \*he\* wanted to date and I didn't yet know that I could simply say no; I would have been just as happy if we'd stayed friends. 

From past experiences I'm a bit wary about men. I don't get a weird vibe from 'John'; none of the other female dancers seem uncomfortable around him at all,, and every time we go out around town he's happily greeted by someone he's friends or acquaintances with. 

I don't know if I'm overreacting or being too suspicious or reading too much into this because I'm not used to physical contact, or being friends with men, or what. 

TLDR: My friend/dancing partner is very physical and friendly and I can't tell if he's dropping hints or if I'm just not used to having a friend. ",1,1739166789.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

1ilz2ti,https://www.reddit.com/r/DesignMyWebsite/comments/1ilz2ti/how_much_do_companies_charge_to_design_a_website/,How much do companies charge to design a website?,"Introduction
============

Did you know some small shop owners pay so little to start, only like a cup of coffee each day, for **website design costs**? I think it's mind-blowing. The cost to make a website can change a lot. This note will show you the different prices to make a website.

I want to help you learn about how much it costs to make a good website. You will learn how to find a web helper or how to do it yourself. This article will help you get a website without paying too much **website cost**.

I. Website Design Costs: An Overview of Average Prices
------------------------------------------------------

**Website design costs** can vary a lot. If you build the website yourself, you will pay a little bit monthly. Think of website builders like Squarespace; **web design pricing** is around $15 to $50 each month. If someone builds it for you, prices can be very different.

A helper who works alone might charge you $500 to $5,000 to design a simple website. But a **web design agency prices** can charge more, like $3,000 to $10,000 or more. Big companies that make special websites can charge even more, maybe $10,000 or $50,000+. It is important to know these numbers are just starting points. The real cost will change based on what you want on your website.

II. Key Factors That Determine Website Design Costs
---------------------------------------------------

When you are making a website, many things change the **cost of website development**. Complex websites with online shopping carts will cost more. A simple website with a few pages will cost less.

If you need unique designs, it will cost more than using templates that are already made. Also, if someone needs to write content for your website, it will cost more. Good **SEO** makes the price go up too. Also, if you want a website that looks good on phones, it can change the price. Designers who are very good or live in places where things are costly will charge more.

III. Types of Websites and Their Cost Implications
--------------------------------------------------

If you want just a simple website, it will not cost much. Maybe around like $700 or less. If you sell things online, it can cost more, like $2,000 to $5,000+. A website that you can change yourself, like using WordPress, might cost you $1,000 to $4,000. Some special websites with very special things can cost $10,000 or more. **Small business website cost** is different than enterprise website development.

IV. Website Design Pricing Models: How Designers Charge
-------------------------------------------------------

Many designers charge by the hour. That means they count how long it takes to design a website, and then you pay them for each hour. The cost might change. Some designers charge one price for the whole job. **Freelance web designer cost** is different than hourly rates, too.

The good thing about paying by the hour is you only pay for what is done. The bad thing is that the price can change. The good thing about paying one price is you know how much it will cost. Make sure you talk to your designer so you know how they charge.

V. Real-World Website Design Cost Examples
------------------------------------------

Okay, consider this shop. If you want a website for a little shop that sells cakes, it might cost $1,500 to $4,000. A **restaurant** needs a menu on the **website design cost**. If you want to sell clothes online, the **e-commerce website cost** can be $3,000 to $8,000. Making a special website for a big company can cost $10,000 or more.

VI. Cutting Website Design Costs: Smart Strategies to Save
----------------------------------------------------------

To save money, you must know what you want the website to do. This way you will know what to cut costs. This can bring down your **affordable website design**. Write the words and take the photos for your website to make it cost less.

Use a template to make the design. A template is like a ready made website, you just need to change it. You can start with a small website and add more things later. This will help you pay less at first.

VII. Website Costs Beyond the Build: Maintenance, Marketing, and Updates
------------------------------------------------------------------------

You must pay for other things other than designing the website. You also have to pay for **website maintenance cost**. Also, you have to give money to a company to keep the website on the internet. They can be $10 to $100 each month. Getting a name for the website costs a little money each year. Doing **SEO** and telling people about your website can cost money too.

Conclusion
----------

When you are making a website, you must know how much it will cost and what changes the price. Do not spend more money than what you can spend. It is a good idea to talk to different designers and ask them questions. Remember, a good website helps your company succeed.

1ilz2jb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Episcopalian/comments/1ilz2jb/attended_an_episcopal_church_for_the_first_time/,Attended an Episcopal Church for the first time,"Hi there, I just hope it's alright if I share this experience and maybe ask a few questions. I'm 24 years old and queer, never been fully open about it or in a relationship and as such, hadn't been to any church for regular service since I was a toddler. The other primary reason being that I actually grew up an atheist, then to agnostic and currently questioning my beliefs. I was led to the Episcopal Church after some research and currently being in the middle of a massive existential crisis and thanatophobia eating at me recently. After about a month and a half of procrastinating I finally got out of bed and went alone, in secret, to church. I had reached out to a member of the vestry who informed me she was a married lesbian in the church which gave me the security to finally just take the step. I have driven past the church every day of my life and had not been inside so I gave things a shot. Forgive me here if I don't know the exact words for certain things and people, I'm used to Baptists and have never personally known anyone Episcopalian.

Service was absolutely lovely. Admittedly, I was a nervous wreck and a bit lost, but congregants immediately recognized me as a newcomer and guided meditation through the service and hymns. We opened with a hymn which was very pretty. During this time I was panicking a little but simultaneously enjoying myself. After a few readings and prayers we began the 2nd hymn of the day and it was during singing this that I began to feel myself slowly giving my trust to God for the first time in my life. I was still antsy and all over the place but I began trusting at that point, just a bit. It was during the intinction, my first one, that a little bit more of that fear melted while I ingested the communion wafer, even though I still was a bit unsure of what to do with myself when I was beginning. My anxiety never completely went away, but I have never quite had this feeling of confidence that things would be alright in spite of that nervousness though. After the closing hymn and an after service coffee break, I left, and for the first time, while my thoughts of thanatophobia did persist, I could think of the end and feel secure, even if just for a brief time.

One thing I noticed right away was that I was the only person my age there; the only congregants younger than me were children. The only person who looked close to my age was a member of the clergy, which stuck out to me. Even the priest commented that I was the first ""young blood"" they'd seen in a bit, although some young people my age apparently come from time to time. Some others were in their younger 30s and early 40s. While I might look for an episcopal church nearby that has a wider variety of age ranges, I immediately noticed the other congregants have a really strong bond, it was like sitting in with a group of found family. These people genuinely love each other so much and it's apparent the moment you see them. What are the age ranges like at your local church? Similar situation or are there more younger or older people?

There was very much a no pressure environment which I liked. It was refreshing to hear a priest whose words reflected the idea that God blessed us not with predetermination but the ability to change and grow and not be puppeteered. That our different identities and loved ones and fluidity are a reflection of God's endless love and not one preset idea in a single prepackaged form. Genuinely one of the most compassionate preachings I'd heard in a quite some time.

Anything you'd suggest I do in preparation for coming back?

Any advice should I come back? ",3,1739166023.0,Episcopalian,1,1.0,False

My partner and I have thrown around the idea of eventually opening a cafe (coffee, tea, desserts, etc) somewhere in Middleton, Kingston, or Greenwood. It's always been a little dream of mine to have a cozy and welcoming cafe, and I figured I would reach out here and see what people who live in the area would think about a coffee shop that's more than a Tim Hortons haha. Everything would be sourced local (coffee beans, milk, pastries, etc etc) and ideally I'd like it to be a cozy place with chairs and tables and lots of books etc.

I'll be honest, I'm from Ontario, but am moving to Middleton next month to be with family, hence why I thought to ask here what locals think, before planning further  

Is there a market/interest for a cafe? Or would it be a waste of time to consider it further than a dream?

Seeking advice in this long post that lays out what I feel is a very toxic marriage and yet I stay…,"A little background, F(42) married to M(39), we have been together for 4.5 years, married for 3.5 almost 4 years. The beginning of our relationship was amazing.
I’ve been doing a lot of reading and googling to understand and I definitely feel like there was some love-bombing in the beginning and neither of us are entirely whole-person healthy. 

One thing I want to do is say a little about me. I most definitely have some attachment issues - From what I’ve researched and really dug into, preoccupied anxious attachment fits. I also have some codependency and tend to caretake and rescue. I absolutely have a history of relationships with individuals who have exploited my loving nature and willingness to help others which ultimately is my demise and SO unhealthy when I don’t apply appropriate boundaries. Honestly when I look back on my life it really feels like it depends on the person the level of boundaries I am able to enforce. 

Someone asked me recently “what happened to you when you were younger that led you to believe that you deserve less than?” Honesty is the only thing that will truly set you free: not having a father and having a teenage mother affected me. My grandmother primarily raised me and while her love is the best and purest love I know, the scars that absent or inconsistent parents bring, can affect you longer than you realize. 
Ok… I just wish that people on here would talk about their own mess too when they speak on their partners mess. So there you go, a little peak into my validation seeking, low boundary self. 

I just told my husband I want a divorce. I don’t want to keep doing this. Maybe my head is fucked up but when I really think about it all, the idea of going through any of this shit again just makes me want to cut all ties. Even when we talk and see each other now it’s not good. (We are in a separated situation rn but he is seeking to come home) He’s mean. He has terrible cognitive distortions and allows these distortions to rule his perception of the world so his thinking is not based on rationality or reality. Some of our negative interaction currently is me because I’m so tired. I’ve put so much into the relationship that I’m exhausted and I’m just not able to apply the same effort, energy, and love as I used to. Really I think I’ve started putting me first a little bit. 

Here is like the longest list of things that I’ve put together over the last year that I’ve been trying to decide whether or not to get a divorce. I know the fact that I’m even debating it and researching or asking other’s thoughts should be my answer but I always have hope for people and that hope that he can change and be the man I loved in the beginning, that absolutely keeps me, and the breadcrumbs of manipulative love he feeds me in between bouts of anger, hostility, and aggression. And the guilt trips he lays on me. Also I will tell myself that maybe it will get better when xyz happens. So I keep holding on, and my final “maybe” is when he would come home. That’s been my last, maybe it will get better when he gets home. 

I guess I’m asking what you would say if I was your friend in this situation or what you would need to hear right now if you were me. Or what helped you if you ever were in a situation like this. 
Thank you!
(The tense and how all this is worded may sound off because it was wrote over the course of a year, it’s kinda like free wrote journal entries and… cuz… emotions!)

Anyways here’s my list…

-You told me you will kill me. On multiple occasions 

-Saying you will kill my family 

-Saying you will kill my dog

-You told me you wouldn’t actually hurt me you just threaten and the fear of being hurt is enough that you don’t have to put your hands on me 

-Saying that my dog is yours

-Saying that any of my dogs have been yours when I am the one who have taken care of all of them

-You strangled one of our dogs lifting it into the air because it was scared to get its nails clipped

-Making me feel bad for choosing me over you and the dogs when you made me feel unsafe and I felt I needed to go to the police

-Placing your warped perception on the words I say to fit whatever theory you have in your head. 

-I hate that I am reactive asf to you. That I am no longer able to manage and control my anger and I blow up. That is not me. Name calling and yelling is not who I want to be and I hate that I allow you to get me there. 

-I cannot stand that you just can’t stop accusing me of cheating. That is rude and disrespectful to me. It makes me so mad to constantly be falsely accused. Insecurity is not the same as whatever this is. 

-Lying to me about your phones

-You say you care and you will ask about my day and I will be in the middle of a story and you will either cut me off or tell me you are getting off the phone, etc. You really don’t care what I have to say but play the part so I continue to do for you. 

-Since I don’t feel heard and you think poorly of my job then I don’t really feel like I have anything to talk about. So you tell me I’m bland and boring. I’m actually not at all it’s just that I don’t feel like you care and I don’t feel like talking to you is safe because you twist my words to fit some delusion and then a fight starts. 

-Having zero maturity and not respecting our budget limits. Just expecting whatever you want and taking advantage of my love and kindness placing me in a constant state of stress and anger

-Having the audacity to expect me to do more for you than you are willing to do for me and when I begin drawing lines in the sand you become offended

-Spending over half of my settlement money and not giving a single fuck about it

-Insinuating that you will give me anything less than your best because you have always been given whatever you wanted

-You told me you would throw oatmeal at me cuz it was too hot

-You called me a fat lazy bitch multiple times because after working all day I didn’t come home and then also clean. But you weren’t working. 

-You would take my car and leave me at home for days at a time only calling for me to send money. I would have to have coworkers take me to and from work, to the store and to get cigarettes. 

-On the same note you wouldn’t come home for days but accuse me of cheating. Like where are you?

-I remember once calling an Uber and paying $20 because you fell asleep in the car too fucked up when you knew I needed my car for work. 

-I remember asking what was on the inside of the car door and apparently it was one of your “friends” vomit from the night before that you “must’ve missed that spot”

-I remember you asking me to legitimately traffic in you some dumbass tobacco to prison and then when I wouldn’t you were upset. Like really? That’s my freedom. 

-You literally just told me not to come see you and then got mad that I didn’t. 

-You called me a fucking whore when I’m scheduled till 5pm and wasn’t leaving yet at 458pm

-You put your hand around my neck as to strangle me because I didn’t help you carry stuff from your truck to the car and still to this day you tell me “I stopped myself” “I would never actually hurt you”

-You had me following you and then started acting crazy and telling me you would kill me and started throwing things from the truck into my car

-You sent me money so we could move out of where we were then wanted it back. I wanted us to move out SO BAD and didn’t want to send it. You told me you would kill me and my family if I didn’t send it. You also told me if I didn’t go pick you up from the gas station you were stuck at that you would beat my ass. I didn’t pick you up because I was terrified of you. 

-You told me you would put your hands on me if I didn’t shut tf up in my parents basement 

-you told me you were going to have some female give you head (supposedly you didn’t)

-The next night you answered the phone in front of me all “hey baby thanks for the head, you’re so great, I’ll see you soon” then threw pizza at me in the car and told me if I didn’t go get you money from the atm you would bash my face into the steering wheel

-At a motel you stood in front of the door and told me you were going to kill me and my family because I didn’t want you leaving with my car. I was scared for my safety because you were threatening to hurt me like you had the night before. The dogs were backed up near me acting as if they needed to protect me. You told me that if I didn’t go get a key for the room made for you then you would hit me and kill my family. 

-since you have been locked up you have threatened my safety by saying you would hurt me, kill me, take my dog, kill my dog, kill my family. 

-You constantly bring up the fact that I slept with someone the week before I met you which is irrelevant. I didn’t even know you then. 

-You call me names like whore, slut, slow, dumb bitch. 

-You told me I was slow and stupid because I didn’t pack up your belongings how you would’ve. 

-You constantly put me down and pick apart everything I do especially if you would have done it differently. 

-You constantly accuse me of cheating 

-Any noise you hear in the background you turn it into I must be cheating 

-You call me a whore because of where I work and tell me that I work there for the attention 

-I couldn’t possibly ever have fun in my entire life because then I would never hear the end of it from you and be made to feel bad about it

-It appears that you don’t want me around my family OR yours OR to have any friends BUT you are allowed to do whatever you want always

-You are controlling 

-You can look through my phone but not me though yours

-You time how long I take to do things and if you feel like it took me too long to go grocery shopping then I must be cheating

-You don’t want me to have any social media unless it’s your account too

-You hide your relationships with women and can do whatever you want but expect me to cut everyone off. And god forbid if you hear a male voice in the background if I’m out in the world cuz then I’m automatically cheating 

-I have “changed” which is absolutely true and idk how I could ever go back to the woman I was when we first got together now because that woman was offered love and kindness and respect not this angry man that I don’t ever know what mood you will be in that moment. 

-When I told you my best friend died you didn’t console me. Still pretty much act like you don’t care at all. 

-This entire time it just feels like when I require my needs met then I need to meet them and when you need your needs met we both need to meet them

-You play mind games. Like say what you mean. I will ask you something like do you want me to pick you up or do you want a Lyft? You will tell me a Lyft. I will ask again to clarify then later you punish me and are mad at me that I get you a Lyft. I’m done trying to guess what you want because in the past if I would show up to surprise you then you also might be mad because you said you wanted a Lyft. There’s no making you happy. 

-You use prison, addiction, your mom, trauma, ANYTHING as an excuse to treat me poorly. 

-I have repeatedly mentioned to you that your tone matters. What you say and how you say it to me matters and you don’t care.

-you cannot expect me to accept your disrespect and then not be willing to eat that same shit. 

-Yesterday when I took your items to you, you were yelling and being disrespectful to me on the phone, so I was doing the same back and you told me that you were going to smash my face in because you thought I was around people outside. It’s like your appearance of being this great man and having a great relationship matters even though behind closed doors it’s a lie. 

-I told you tonight 11/26/24 that you make me not want to be alive, like I literally get to the point in our never ending arguing that I feel hopeless and hate life and you told me to take a knife and slit my throat -when I asked if you knew what you would get if I actually committed suicide after you encouraged it, you said insurance $, which would be true but you would have a better chance at receiving a prison sentence for assisted manslaughter. 

-You tell me that it doesn’t matter if I leave that you have women lined up and it wouldn’t bother you. 

-If I don’t want to do something for you then you try manipulating me by telling me that you’ll just find another bitch to do it for you because there are plenty of females that would take my place. 

-You track my location but turn yours off. I live in the country so the accuracy isn’t as good as when in a bigger city so I will get calls and FaceTimes while sleeping to make sure I’m actually at home since I’m a whore (according to you) and I’m obviously cheating because find my iPhone isn’t as great where I’m at (which you know)

-I remember this one time you had this new job and you asked me to help remind you to get up and all that. I got you up, got your clothes for you, coffee, packed a lunch for you. Then as you left out the door you looked at me and said you weren’t going and left. And laughed in my face. 

-I second guess the fuck out of myself now. Like I remember I started to gather the trash one day and then I stopped and literally put everything back because I was afraid you would come home and accuse me of trying to hide evidence of cheating. 

-I scheduled a phone call between you and your lawyer. When you called your lawyer he didn’t answer. So you called me and took your anger out on me and told me not to ever do anything for you again that I can’t do things right and that you won’t be calling me ever again. You called right back and I answered again. As I answered I said I was in a meeting with my boss (I was) and you told me I cared more about my job than you - that’s not true, but I did not have time to be talked down to when I had done nothing wrong. My boss overheard some of the conversation since you were yelling at me from the jump both times (she’s a therapist of course, right?! lol) and asked me if I had a safety plan. 

-I went to try and get your glasses cut into your new frames and the place wouldn’t do it without the prescription of the glasses and you ripped all the way into me telling me I couldn’t do anything right and that you will never ask me to do anything for you again because I fuck everything up because I’m slow and don’t know how to talk to people. So I picked you up and we both went back and you were told the exact same thing…

-I took you to your eye doctor appointment and when you got in the car you wanted to smoke, fine, but you didn’t want to open your window because you didn’t want to get cold. You got aggressively angry. It was just a tantrum for nothing when you could’ve just opened your window some. I just don’t understand it and then not say all the dumb comments of “well it’s your car, I just won’t smoke, I have to respect you” it’s just nonsense! Then I literally had to stop you from buying glasses that day because you had other bills being withdrawn. You were SO MAD. I offered alternatives which you wanted nothing to do with. We went to get quarters and weren’t able to get any so you took the $10 you had put aside for laundry and then put it in a lotto machine (won nothing) because you were angry you couldn’t get quarters. The level of anger and irrational choices that follow your anger are immeasurable. 

-You tell me you say hurtful things when you’re mad but you don’t mean them. That actually doesn’t excuse the words you say. You are still accountable for what you do and what you say regardless of your emotions. 

-You have told me that you are diagnosed Bipolar, which I could very well see that in your actions and behaviors. You have told me you need medication but I have no trust that you would stay on a medication. You were prescribed medication when we got together and you stopped taking it. I asked you to see Mental Health about a year in, you did, and were prescribed meds and stopped going and stopped taking those too. Having a mental health condition does not exonerate you from fault. I have my own mental health issues and try working through them. 

-I very much used to just let you do whatever and go along with it but for awhile I have begun voicing my anger and my concerns and you do not like it. Sometimes I am being reactive and I come off so angry and it makes me feel like I’m the problem and then when I voice my concerns to you they never get talked about you tell me you feel attacked. But like how am I attacking you when I tell you things that are bothering me that I would like us to work on. Example: “hey baby when I do something and then you tell me what I should have done differently because my way was wrong or inefficient then it makes me feel really negative about myself and like I can’t do things correctly in your eyes” that is met with you being angry and saying I’m attacking you as a person and I’m just trying to make you feel low and less than when I am literally trying to tell you how you make me feel like I am garbage and how I would like us to work on our communication. It’s not a personal attack bro. 

-Over the last 3.5 years you’ve told me on multiple occasions that you didn’t want to marry me. That you kept pushing it off and you wished you could change it. 

-You SO MANY times have told me we are over, that you are single, and you want a divorce. All of this is in manipulation in order to get me to do something for you or to gain back control of my emotions. I for the longest time have begged for us to stay together saying that marriage takes work and you don’t give up on the person you love etc. This is like emotional manipulation to keep coercive control over me. 

-In the last 6 months or so when you say divorce I tell you to do it. I am not trying to manipulate you I legitimately am like that’s cool, man, let’s get a divorce. I actually filled out paperwork and have been ready to go file for the last month. My biggest problem is that I give myself too much time and it’s like you know and give me little breadcrumbs of love. It’s terrifyingly exhausting and I want free of the cycle. Every moment of every day I wish you were the man you were when we first got together and I wish I could be that soft version of myself with you that I was back then too. Instead, I am forever questioning what your mood will be today and how to navigate with the least mental and emotional consequences.

1. Can one fast in thanksgiving? Because they're thankful for an answer to prayer?

2. Is it okay to drink things like tea or coffee during a fast? I'd be doing this mostly to help me stay awake in early morning classes, not for pleasure.

3. What is a good number of days to fast?

4. What are some (spiritual) things to focus on as I fast?

1ilyun3,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDPartners/comments/1ilyun3/struggling_to_leave_struggling_to_stay_this_is_a/,Struggling to leave. Struggling to stay. This is a long post…,"A little background, F(42) married to idk the acronyms but diagnosed BPD M(39), we have been together for 4.5 years, married for 3.5 almost 4 years. The beginning of our relationship was amazing.
I’ve been doing a lot of reading and googling to understand and I definitely feel like there was some love-bombing in the beginning and neither of us are entirely whole-person healthy. 

One thing I want to do is say a little about me. I most definitely have some attachment issues - From what I’ve researched and really dug into, preoccupied anxious attachment fits. I also have some codependency and tend to caretake and rescue. I absolutely have a history of relationships with individuals who have exploited my loving nature and willingness to help others which ultimately is my demise and SO unhealthy when I don’t apply appropriate boundaries. Honestly when I look back on my life it really feels like it depends on the person the level of boundaries I am able to enforce. 

Someone asked me recently “what happened to you when you were younger that led you to believe that you deserve less than?” Honesty is the only thing that will truly set you free: not having a father and having a teenage mother affected me. My grandmother primarily raised me and while her love is the best and purest love I know, the scars that absent or inconsistent parents bring, can affect you longer than you realize. 
Ok… I just wish that people on here would talk about their own mess too when they speak on their partners mess. So there you go, a little peak into my validation seeking, low boundary self. 

I just told my husband I want a divorce. I don’t want to keep doing this. Maybe my head is fucked up but when I really think about it all, the idea of going through any of this shit again just makes me want to cut all ties. Even when we talk and see each other now it’s not good. (We are in a separated situation rn but he is seeking to come home) He’s mean. He has terrible cognitive distortions and allows these distortions to rule his perception of the world so his thinking is not based on rationality or reality. Some of our negative interaction currently is me because I’m so tired. I’ve put so much into the relationship that I’m exhausted and I’m just not able to apply the same effort, energy, and love as I used to. Really I think I’ve started putting me first a little bit. 

Here is like the longest list of things that I’ve put together over the last year that I’ve been trying to decide whether or not to get a divorce. I know the fact that I’m even debating it and researching or asking other’s thoughts should be my answer but I always have hope for people and that hope that he can change and be the man I loved in the beginning, that absolutely keeps me, and the breadcrumbs of manipulative love he feeds me in between bouts of anger, hostility, and aggression. And the guilt trips he lays on me. Also I will tell myself that maybe it will get better when xyz happens. So I keep holding on, and my final “maybe” is when he would come home. That’s been my last, maybe it will get better when he gets home. 

I guess I’m asking what you would say if I was your friend in this situation or what you would need to hear right now if you were me. Or what helped you if you ever were in a situation like this. 
Thank you!
(The tense and how all this is worded may sound off because it was wrote over the course of a year, it’s kinda like free wrote journal entries and… cuz… emotions!)

Anyways here’s my list…

-You told me you will kill me. On multiple occasions 

-Saying you will kill my family 

-Saying you will kill my dog

-You told me you wouldn’t actually hurt me you just threaten and the fear of being hurt is enough that you don’t have to put your hands on me 

-Saying that my dog is yours

-Saying that any of my dogs have been yours when I am the one who have taken care of all of them

-You strangled one of our dogs lifting it into the air because it was scared to get its nails clipped

-Making me feel bad for choosing me over you and the dogs when you made me feel unsafe and I felt I needed to go to the police

-Placing your warped perception on the words I say to fit whatever theory you have in your head. 

-I hate that I am reactive asf to you. That I am no longer able to manage and control my anger and I blow up. That is not me. Name calling and yelling is not who I want to be and I hate that I allow you to get me there. 

-I cannot stand that you just can’t stop accusing me of cheating. That is rude and disrespectful to me. It makes me so mad to constantly be falsely accused. Insecurity is not the same as whatever this is. 

-Lying to me about your phones

-You say you care and you will ask about my day and I will be in the middle of a story and you will either cut me off or tell me you are getting off the phone, etc. You really don’t care what I have to say but play the part so I continue to do for you. 

-Since I don’t feel heard and you think poorly of my job then I don’t really feel like I have anything to talk about. So you tell me I’m bland and boring. I’m actually not at all it’s just that I don’t feel like you care and I don’t feel like talking to you is safe because you twist my words to fit some delusion and then a fight starts. 

-Having zero maturity and not respecting our budget limits. Just expecting whatever you want and taking advantage of my love and kindness placing me in a constant state of stress and anger

-Having the audacity to expect me to do more for you than you are willing to do for me and when I begin drawing lines in the sand you become offended

-Spending over half of my settlement money and not giving a single fuck about it

-Insinuating that you will give me anything less than your best because you have always been given whatever you wanted

-You told me you would throw oatmeal at me cuz it was too hot

-You called me a fat lazy bitch multiple times because after working all day I didn’t come home and then also clean. But you weren’t working. 

-You would take my car and leave me at home for days at a time only calling for me to send money. I would have to have coworkers take me to and from work, to the store and to get cigarettes. 

-On the same note you wouldn’t come home for days but accuse me of cheating. Like where are you?

-I remember once calling an Uber and paying $20 because you fell asleep in the car too fucked up when you knew I needed my car for work. 

-I remember asking what was on the inside of the car door and apparently it was one of your “friends” vomit from the night before that you “must’ve missed that spot”

-I remember you asking me to legitimately traffic in you some dumbass tobacco to prison and then when I wouldn’t you were upset. Like really? That’s my freedom. 

-You literally just told me not to come see you and then got mad that I didn’t. 

-You called me a fucking whore when I’m scheduled till 5pm and wasn’t leaving yet at 458pm

-You put your hand around my neck as to strangle me because I didn’t help you carry stuff from your truck to the car and still to this day you tell me “I stopped myself” “I would never actually hurt you”

-You had me following you and then started acting crazy and telling me you would kill me and started throwing things from the truck into my car

-You sent me money so we could move out of where we were then wanted it back. I wanted us to move out SO BAD and didn’t want to send it. You told me you would kill me and my family if I didn’t send it. You also told me if I didn’t go pick you up from the gas station you were stuck at that you would beat my ass. I didn’t pick you up because I was terrified of you. 

-You told me you would put your hands on me if I didn’t shut tf up in my parents basement 

-you told me you were going to have some female give you head (supposedly you didn’t)

-The next night you answered the phone in front of me all “hey baby thanks for the head, you’re so great, I’ll see you soon” then threw pizza at me in the car and told me if I didn’t go get you money from the atm you would bash my face into the steering wheel

-At a motel you stood in front of the door and told me you were going to kill me and my family because I didn’t want you leaving with my car. I was scared for my safety because you were threatening to hurt me like you had the night before. The dogs were backed up near me acting as if they needed to protect me. You told me that if I didn’t go get a key for the room made for you then you would hit me and kill my family. 

-since you have been locked up you have threatened my safety by saying you would hurt me, kill me, take my dog, kill my dog, kill my family. 

-You constantly bring up the fact that I slept with someone the week before I met you which is irrelevant. I didn’t even know you then. 

-You call me names like whore, slut, slow, dumb bitch. 

-You told me I was slow and stupid because I didn’t pack up your belongings how you would’ve. 

-You constantly put me down and pick apart everything I do especially if you would have done it differently. 

-You constantly accuse me of cheating 

-Any noise you hear in the background you turn it into I must be cheating 

-You call me a whore because of where I work and tell me that I work there for the attention 

-I couldn’t possibly ever have fun in my entire life because then I would never hear the end of it from you and be made to feel bad about it

-It appears that you don’t want me around my family OR yours OR to have any friends BUT you are allowed to do whatever you want always

-You are controlling 

-You can look through my phone but not me though yours

-You time how long I take to do things and if you feel like it took me too long to go grocery shopping then I must be cheating

-You don’t want me to have any social media unless it’s your account too

-You hide your relationships with women and can do whatever you want but expect me to cut everyone off. And god forbid if you hear a male voice in the background if I’m out in the world cuz then I’m automatically cheating 

-I have “changed” which is absolutely true and idk how I could ever go back to the woman I was when we first got together now because that woman was offered love and kindness and respect not this angry man that I don’t ever know what mood you will be in that moment. 

-When I told you my best friend died you didn’t console me. Still pretty much act like you don’t care at all. 

-This entire time it just feels like when I require my needs met then I need to meet them and when you need your needs met we both need to meet them

-You play mind games. Like say what you mean. I will ask you something like do you want me to pick you up or do you want a Lyft? You will tell me a Lyft.

1ilytuw,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualPH/comments/1ilytuw/communication_is_really_a_skill/,Communication is really a skill.,"I have a close friend na huli kong nakausap three weeks ago or so, we usually spend a lot of talking on weekends whenever we are free and for the past three weeks, she was silent so I assume something is up (not about our relationship, but with her personal life),

Anyway, I noticed she's MIA and I've been meaning to call her this weekend since I wanted to give her space and time. But here's the thing, before the weekend, she sent me a message sa Viber na I rarely use to communicate with her since we talk thru Messenger and calls but never in Viber. But, my Viber notifs are off, I have it but I don't use it so hindi ko sya chineck religiously. Friday, I got home early and had my me time since isa ko lang sa bahay, I posted story sa IG and after 4 hours, she sent me a lot of long messages.

I will not go into details but her point is, nagmessage sya and di ako nagrerespond but I have the time and leisure to post on soc med, nagtatampo at naiinis sya on how I act, in everything she do she always considers me, at nangamusta sya pero feeling nya inignore sya.

Hindi ko rin nakita agad message nya na yan since 7pm onwards nasa labas na ako at nacheck ko na lang phone ko 11pm. I was shocked sa nabasa ko pero di ako nagreply agad kasi I was trying to understand her pov and consider her feelings. 

Though naiinis ako how she impulsively do this kind of communication everytime na muryot sya I replied with an apology and explanation why I wasn't able to reply. Nagreply sya kinaumagahan na at medyo nagtone down naman na and the convo went on till afternoon. May mga reply pa sya na sarcastic pero di ko na pinatulan kasi I try to understand her na lang at baka may pinagdadaanan.

I was rereading the convo earlier today and I feel like na nagkulang din ako sa part na kamustahin sya at pinatagal ko iultimatum to check on her. So I sent her my apology again saying that and I plan to padeliveran sya coffee later.

Looking back now, sa tagal ng samahan namin, I never had the chance na iexplain side ko kasi I'm not really confrontational. I just say sorry para tapos na ang usapan. But when I noticed how I paused then respond, choose carefully the words I speak while standing up for myself, makes my 15 year old self proud.

Since I use an even two scoops of regular coffee and decaf coffee I can't possibly adjust for that little half a cup of coffee out of my scoops and I like my coffee just as it is.

At the end, we matched, and set up a coffee date over text to meet again. He brought me a bouquet of flowers, and while this is a nice gesture, I also thought it was a bit too much and made me slightly uncomfortable as we had only known each other for 6 minutes. He also said he had been looking forward to the date all week.

This past week, he was going on an international trip for a week and I texted ""safe travels!"" and he said ""omg wow you remembered :) :)"" and during the trip he kept asking me how I was doing and sent me 20 pics from his trip and when I didn't respond one night because I was tired, he then sent me ""good morning, I hope you're having a lovely week"" the next day (double texting). He just got back and said he brought me a gift from his trip, which is also making me uncomfortable.

He's very nice but this is all so much right off the bat. I have secure attachment--do you think he might have anxious attachment?

On the flip side, when I visit which is for about a week every month I need to cook for five people. So I need the stove.

1ilyplr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ilyplr,First PC build: RTX 5080 FsE (F*ck scalpers Edition),"I decided to switch from my Mac mini/PS4 to a PC a few months ago, and finally put my GPU in yesterday. I wanted a smaller, portable, “future-proof” rig primarily for gaming and 3D printing. 

Parts list:

**CPU - AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D 
GPU - Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 FE
MOBO - ASUS ROG Strix B650E-I 
RAM - TEAMGROUP T-FORCE DELTA DDR5 32GB
SSD - TEAMGROUP MP44Q 2TB 
Cooler - NZXT Kraken Elite 240 AIO
Case - JONSBO/JONSPLUS Z20 Micro-ATX**

Everything was MSRP or less; scalpers can eat a bag. I chose the Z20 because apparently I needed my first build to be painful (my cable management is less than desirable; I’ll 3D print something to hide it all away later. Don’t judge me). The MOBO was chosen for the PCIe 5 and “future-proofing”, but I’m pretty sure it was unnecessary. I know AIOs are generally frowned upon here, but I got a pretty good deal on it, and seeing my temps at a glance was pretty important to me. 

While I was initially gathering pieces and parts, I had decided on the 9800X3D and a 4080s, but keeping an open mind about the 5000 series. After snagging the CPU, I ordered the 4080s, only to have them cancel my order the day it was supposed to arrive, which happened to also be the day the 5000 series specs/prices were announced. I decided to wait till the new GPUs dropped and either (1) get lucky with a 5080 at MSRP or (2) get a 4080s used. 

The morning of January 30th, after several cups of coffee+open tabs on Best Buy/Nvidia/Newegg/B&H+stock notification apps on two phones, my 5080 order was confirmed.

Can you guys give me some advice on whether it's worth refinishing this hardwood floor? What could it look like? Will it look like new? Will it remove all the scratches (there are some deep scratches not shown in pictures)? And can I have a finish that is not so shiny as to avoid the footprints. Based on the surrounding colors in my house, can you recommend a few colors that I could refinish my floor with? My kitchen cabinets are coffee brown so I feel like I have to stick with a dark brownish color. Are there any colors that would complement my kitchen or should I stick to a similar color or should I also repaint my kitchen cabinets to match my new floor color? I have two toddlers. What color should I avoid to make sure the kids don't ruin the floor. I plan to sell my house within the next 5 years but want to make it look nicer while I'm here. 

Story if interested:

I moved into this house about 5 years ago. I did some minor renovations at the time but left my hardwood floor as is. As you can see it looks very dirty most of the time, has lots of scratches all over the place, and is a footprint magnet. My wife and I struggle to keep it clean and with two kids it's not easy. 

I have matte finish laminate flooring upstairs which has seemed to do much better than my floor in the main area. Probably because there's not a lot of traffic upstairs. 

I plan to eventually sell the house to move to a bigger house but I have been planning that for a while now, but with the housing market being absolute shit in Canada, there's a possibility that I might be in this house or at least another 5 years. 

I asked my friend who did my flooring upstairs if he can replace my hardwood on the main floor with laminate as well and he recommended that I don't do that because hardwood floors are much more expensive and replacing them with laminate could bring my house value down. He suggested that I might want to consider refinishing the hardwood floor which would cost approximately the same amount as replacing it with laminate floor.

It’s a really long post…,"A little background, F(42) married to M(39), we have been together for 4.5 years, married for 3.5 almost 4 years. The beginning of our relationship was amazing.
I’ve been doing a lot of reading and googling to understand and I definitely feel like there was some love-bombing in the beginning and neither of us are entirely whole-person healthy. 

One thing I want to do is say a little about me. I most definitely have some attachment issues - From what I’ve researched and really dug into, preoccupied anxious attachment fits. I also have some codependency and tend to caretake and rescue. I absolutely have a history of relationships with individuals who have exploited my loving nature and willingness to help others which ultimately is my demise and SO unhealthy when I don’t apply appropriate boundaries. Honestly when I look back on my life it really feels like it depends on the person the level of boundaries I am able to enforce. 

Someone asked me recently “what happened to you when you were younger that led you to believe that you deserve less than?” Honesty is the only thing that will truly set you free: not having a father and having a teenage mother affected me. My grandmother primarily raised me and while her love is the best and purest love I know, the scars that absent or inconsistent parents bring, can affect you longer than you realize. 
Ok… I just wish that people on here would talk about their own mess too when they speak on their partners mess. So there you go, a little peak into my validation seeking, low boundary self. 

I just told my husband I want a divorce. I don’t want to keep doing this. Maybe my head is fucked up but when I really think about it all, the idea of going through any of this shit again just makes me want to cut all ties. Even when we talk and see each other now it’s not good. (We are in a separated situation rn but he is seeking to come home) He’s mean. He has terrible cognitive distortions and allows these distortions to rule his perception of the world so his thinking is not based on rationality or reality. Some of our negative interaction currently is me because I’m so tired. I’ve put so much into the relationship that I’m exhausted and I’m just not able to apply the same effort, energy, and love as I used to. Really I think I’ve started putting me first a little bit. 

Here is like the longest list of things that I’ve put together over the last year that I’ve been trying to decide whether or not to get a divorce. I know the fact that I’m even debating it and researching or asking other’s thoughts should be my answer but I always have hope for people and that hope that he can change and be the man I loved in the beginning, that absolutely keeps me, and the breadcrumbs of manipulative love he feeds me in between bouts of anger, hostility, and aggression. And the guilt trips he lays on me. Also I will tell myself that maybe it will get better when xyz happens. So I keep holding on, and my final “maybe” is when he would come home. That’s been my last, maybe it will get better when he gets home. 

I guess I’m asking what you would say if I was your friend in this situation or what you would need to hear right now if you were me. Or what helped you if you ever were in a situation like this. 
Thank you!
(The tense and how all this is worded may sound off because it was wrote over the course of a year, it’s kinda like free wrote journal entries and… cuz… emotions!)

Anyways here’s my list…

-You told me you will kill me. On multiple occasions 

-Saying you will kill my family 

-Saying you will kill my dog

-You told me you wouldn’t actually hurt me you just threaten and the fear of being hurt is enough that you don’t have to put your hands on me 

-Saying that my dog is yours

-Saying that any of my dogs have been yours when I am the one who have taken care of all of them

-You strangled one of our dogs lifting it into the air because it was scared to get its nails clipped

-Making me feel bad for choosing me over you and the dogs when you made me feel unsafe and I felt I needed to go to the police

-Placing your warped perception on the words I say to fit whatever theory you have in your head. 

-I hate that I am reactive asf to you. That I am no longer able to manage and control my anger and I blow up. That is not me. Name calling and yelling is not who I want to be and I hate that I allow you to get me there. 

-I cannot stand that you just can’t stop accusing me of cheating. That is rude and disrespectful to me. It makes me so mad to constantly be falsely accused. Insecurity is not the same as whatever this is. 

-Lying to me about your phones

-You say you care and you will ask about my day and I will be in the middle of a story and you will either cut me off or tell me you are getting off the phone, etc. You really don’t care what I have to say but play the part so I continue to do for you. 

-Since I don’t feel heard and you think poorly of my job then I don’t really feel like I have anything to talk about. So you tell me I’m bland and boring. I’m actually not at all it’s just that I don’t feel like you care and I don’t feel like talking to you is safe because you twist my words to fit some delusion and then a fight starts. 

-Having zero maturity and not respecting our budget limits. Just expecting whatever you want and taking advantage of my love and kindness placing me in a constant state of stress and anger

-Having the audacity to expect me to do more for you than you are willing to do for me and when I begin drawing lines in the sand you become offended

-Spending over half of my settlement money and not giving a single fuck about it

-Insinuating that you will give me anything less than your best because you have always been given whatever you wanted

-You told me you would throw oatmeal at me cuz it was too hot

-You called me a fat lazy bitch multiple times because after working all day I didn’t come home and then also clean. But you weren’t working. 

-You would take my car and leave me at home for days at a time only calling for me to send money. I would have to have coworkers take me to and from work, to the store and to get cigarettes. 

-On the same note you wouldn’t come home for days but accuse me of cheating. Like where are you?

-I remember once calling an Uber and paying $20 because you fell asleep in the car too fucked up when you knew I needed my car for work. 

-I remember asking what was on the inside of the car door and apparently it was one of your “friends” vomit from the night before that you “must’ve missed that spot”

-I remember you asking me to legitimately traffic in you some dumbass tobacco to prison and then when I wouldn’t you were upset. Like really? That’s my freedom. 

-You literally just told me not to come see you and then got mad that I didn’t. 

-You called me a fucking whore when I’m scheduled till 5pm and wasn’t leaving yet at 458pm

-You put your hand around my neck as to strangle me because I didn’t help you carry stuff from your truck to the car and still to this day you tell me “I stopped myself” “I would never actually hurt you”

-You had me following you and then started acting crazy and telling me you would kill me and started throwing things from the truck into my car

-You sent me money so we could move out of where we were then wanted it back. I wanted us to move out SO BAD and didn’t want to send it. You told me you would kill me and my family if I didn’t send it. You also told me if I didn’t go pick you up from the gas station you were stuck at that you would beat my ass. I didn’t pick you up because I was terrified of you. 

-You told me you would put your hands on me if I didn’t shut tf up in my parents basement 

-you told me you were going to have some female give you head (supposedly you didn’t)

-The next night you answered the phone in front of me all “hey baby thanks for the head, you’re so great, I’ll see you soon” then threw pizza at me in the car and told me if I didn’t go get you money from the atm you would bash my face into the steering wheel

-At a motel you stood in front of the door and told me you were going to kill me and my family because I didn’t want you leaving with my car. I was scared for my safety because you were threatening to hurt me like you had the night before. The dogs were backed up near me acting as if they needed to protect me. You told me that if I didn’t go get a key for the room made for you then you would hit me and kill my family. 

-since you have been locked up you have threatened my safety by saying you would hurt me, kill me, take my dog, kill my dog, kill my family. 

-You constantly bring up the fact that I slept with someone the week before I met you which is irrelevant. I didn’t even know you then. 

-You call me names like whore, slut, slow, dumb bitch. 

-You told me I was slow and stupid because I didn’t pack up your belongings how you would’ve. 

-You constantly put me down and pick apart everything I do especially if you would have done it differently. 

-You constantly accuse me of cheating 

-Any noise you hear in the background you turn it into I must be cheating 

-You call me a whore because of where I work and tell me that I work there for the attention 

-I couldn’t possibly ever have fun in my entire life because then I would never hear the end of it from you and be made to feel bad about it

-It appears that you don’t want me around my family OR yours OR to have any friends BUT you are allowed to do whatever you want always

-You are controlling 

-You can look through my phone but not me though yours

-You time how long I take to do things and if you feel like it took me too long to go grocery shopping then I must be cheating

-You don’t want me to have any social media unless it’s your account too

-You hide your relationships with women and can do whatever you want but expect me to cut everyone off. And god forbid if you hear a male voice in the background if I’m out in the world cuz then I’m automatically cheating 

-I have “changed” which is absolutely true and idk how I could ever go back to the woman I was when we first got together now because that woman was offered love and kindness and respect not this angry man that I don’t ever know what mood you will be in that moment. 

-When I told you my best friend died you didn’t console me. Still pretty much act like you don’t care at all. 

-This entire time it just feels like when I require my needs met then I need to meet them and when you need your needs met we both need to meet them

-You play mind games. Like say what you mean. I will ask you something like do you want me to pick you up or do you want a Lyft? You will tell me a Lyft. I will ask again to clarify then later you punish me and are mad at me that I get you a Lyft. I’m done trying to guess what you want because in the past if I would show up to surprise you then you also might be mad because you said you wanted a Lyft. There’s no making you happy. 

-You use prison, addiction, your mom, trauma, ANYTHING as an excuse to treat me poorly. 

-I have repeatedly mentioned to you that your tone matters. What you say and how you say it to me matters and you don’t care.

-you cannot expect me to accept your disrespect and then not be willing to eat that same shit. 

-Yesterday when I took your items to you, you were yelling and being disrespectful to me on the phone, so I was doing the same back and you told me that you were going to smash my face in because you thought I was around people outside. It’s like your appearance of being this great man and having a great relationship matters even though behind closed doors it’s a lie. 

-I told you tonight 11/26/24 that you make me not want to be alive, like I literally get to the point in our never ending arguing that I feel hopeless and hate life and you told me to take a knife and slit my throat -when I asked if you knew what you would get if I actually committed suicide after you encouraged it, you said insurance $, which would be true but you would have a better chance at receiving a prison sentence for assisted manslaughter. 

-You tell me that it doesn’t matter if I leave that you have women lined up and it wouldn’t bother you. 

-If I don’t want to do something for you then you try manipulating me by telling me that you’ll just find another bitch to do it for you because there are plenty of females that would take my place. 

-You track my location but turn yours off. I live in the country so the accuracy isn’t as good as when in a bigger city so I will get calls and FaceTimes while sleeping to make sure I’m actually at home since I’m a whore (according to you) and I’m obviously cheating because find my iPhone isn’t as great where I’m at (which you know)

-I remember this one time you had this new job and you asked me to help remind you to get up and all that. I got you up, got your clothes for you, coffee, packed a lunch for you. Then as you left out the door you looked at me and said you weren’t going and left. And laughed in my face. 

-I second guess the fuck out of myself now. Like I remember I started to gather the trash one day and then I stopped and literally put everything back because I was afraid you would come home and accuse me of trying to hide evidence of cheating. 

-I scheduled a phone call between you and your lawyer. When you called your lawyer he didn’t answer. So you called me and took your anger out on me and told me not to ever do anything for you again that I can’t do things right and that you won’t be calling me ever again. You called right back and I answered again. As I answered I said I was in a meeting with my boss (I was) and you told me I cared more about my job than you - that’s not true, but I did not have time to be talked down to when I had done nothing wrong. My boss overheard some of the conversation since you were yelling at me from the jump both times (she’s a therapist of course, right?! lol) and asked me if I had a safety plan. 

-I went to try and get your glasses cut into your new frames and the place wouldn’t do it without the prescription of the glasses and you ripped all the way into me telling me I couldn’t do anything right and that you will never ask me to do anything for you again because I fuck everything up because I’m slow and don’t know how to talk to people. So I picked you up and we both went back and you were told the exact same thing…

-I took you to your eye doctor appointment and when you got in the car you wanted to smoke, fine, but you didn’t want to open your window because you didn’t want to get cold. You got aggressively angry. It was just a tantrum for nothing when you could’ve just opened your window some. I just don’t understand it and then not say all the dumb comments of “well it’s your car, I just won’t smoke, I have to respect you” it’s just nonsense! Then I literally had to stop you from buying glasses that day because you had other bills being withdrawn. You were SO MAD. I offered alternatives which you wanted nothing to do with. We went to get quarters and weren’t able to get any so you took the $10 you had put aside for laundry and then put it in a lotto machine (won nothing) because you were angry you couldn’t get quarters. The level of anger and irrational choices that follow your anger are immeasurable. 

-You tell me you say hurtful things when you’re mad but you don’t mean them. That actually doesn’t excuse the words you say. You are still accountable for what you do and what you say regardless of your emotions. 

-You have told me that you are diagnosed Bipolar, which I could very well see that in your actions and behaviors. You have told me you need medication but I have no trust that you would stay on a medication. You were prescribed medication when we got together and you stopped taking it. I asked you to see Mental Health about a year in, you did, and were prescribed meds and stopped going and stopped taking those too. Having a mental health condition does not exonerate you from fault. I have my own mental health issues and try working through them. 

-I very much used to just let you do whatever and go along with it but for awhile I have begun voicing my anger and my concerns and you do not like it. Sometimes I am being reactive and I come off so angry and it makes me feel like I’m the problem and then when I voice my concerns to you they never get talked about you tell me you feel attacked. But like how am I attacking you when I tell you things that are bothering me that I would like us to work on. Example: “hey baby when I do something and then you tell me what I should have done differently because my way was wrong or inefficient then it makes me feel really negative about myself and like I can’t do things correctly in your eyes” that is met with you being angry and saying I’m attacking you as a person and I’m just trying to make you feel low and less than when I am literally trying to tell you how you make me feel like I am garbage and how I would like us to work on our communication. It’s not a personal attack bro. 

-Over the last 3.5 years you’ve told me on multiple occasions that you didn’t want to marry me. That you kept pushing it off and you wished you could change it. 

-You SO MANY times have told me we are over, that you are single, and you want a divorce. All of this is in manipulation in order to get me to do something for you or to gain back control of my emotions. I for the longest time have begged for us to stay together saying that marriage takes work and you don’t give up on the person you love etc. This is like emotional manipulation to keep coercive control over me. 

-In the last 6 months or so when you say divorce I tell you to do it. I am not trying to manipulate you I legitimately am like that’s cool, man, let’s get a divorce. I actually filled out paperwork and have been ready to go file for the last month. My biggest problem is that I give myself too much time and it’s like you know and give me little breadcrumbs of love. It’s terrifyingly exhausting and I want free of the cycle. Every moment of every day I wish you were the man you were when we first got together and I wish I could be that soft version of myself with you that I was back then too. Instead, I am forever questioning what your mood will be today and how to navigate with the least mental and emotional consequences.

**RECAP**

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/s/BTjZRU3956): **March 13, 2024**

Me and my ex (Dana) have been together for 7 years and i knew that she was bisexual by the beginning and she openly told me about her past relationships with girls but i never cared because to it wasn't a problem at all. We never had any big fight or arguments but just small things and we always sorted out everything. So after 7 years of relationship i decided that it was the right moment to make the big question because we were deeply in love, financially stable and already living together so for me it was the right time. I prepared everything to make it more romantic and unique as i could and when i made her the final question she hesitated but then said yes.

There the problem started cause i didn't understood why that hesitation and i asked her but she only replaid ""i was nervous"" so i gave up. We told this to her parents (mine died when i was 20 and my little sister when she was 17 in a car accident) and our friends but even here some things were off because her parents were faking to be happy and i didn't understood why while our friends were super happy and were already telling us ideas for our wedding.

4 months passed by and we were planning our wedding when ""the day"" came up. I came back home from work and she waiting for me with her bags ready and i asked her what was going on. She told me ""listen i know that this is gonna be hard for you but i'm not bi i'm lesbian. My parents knew this since 2 years and this is why they weren't happy and were faking it. Please i beg you to not make it difficult and just let me leave, don't cry, don't beg me and don't scream let's just things go like adults"" and then she drove away. I was standing there on my feet for like 1 hour in shock cause i couldn't believe it. We passed by getting married to Dana coming out like a heartless and cold girl that i couldn't recognize.

The worst thing comes now cause 3 months passed by that day (i cancelled the wedding) and literally no one ever texted me or called me asking me how i was, if i was fine, if i nedeed something just nothing. Not her parents, not her (she blocked me that day) and not even our firends. No one gives a fuck about me at all. In this 3 months i was hospitalized 3 times cause i lost weight (15 kg) and have insomnia. I just work and come home, nothing else. While everyone is praising her for her coming out, how good is she to finally realize she was lesbian and her courage to be herself after years of fighting to find her true identity.

Right now i'm not even capable of being mad i'm just in desbelief for what happened, how fast it all happened and that no one gives a fuck about me because her coming out is more important than her ex.

You know what? Fuck them all, they showed me their true color and fuck my ex.

Edit: wtf?! I just turned off my phone for 2 hours and went for a walk around my city. Honestly i wasn't expecting all this support because i couldn't even imagine someone actually reading this. Believe me i want to trust you and believe that all this kind comments are true but right now i can't. I just saw everyone that supposed to love me and care about me ignoring me and ghosting me so i lost hope in people and expecially for strangers on the internet. I hope to come here again in a few months and read this all again and believe you but now i can't. You all seem good people and sincere but believe me for how much i want to trust you i simply can't right now but i want to thank you all anyway. I'm not ok and the 3 times i was hospitalized i tried to kill myself but i'm not good even in doing that. For 3 months i thought again and again and again if i was the problem, what i could do better? What i did wrong? But nothing changes. So here i'm in the midlle of fucking nowhere seated on a sidewalk like a homeless reading strangers comments on a post that i don't even know why i posted. Again thank you all.

Edit 2: i have an update but due to ""Trueoffmychest"" rules i can only update after 3 days so i will do it after that time and if something of new would happen i will write it in the update. So just have patience cause a lot is happening and i still have to figure out a lot of things and how to act.

**LoudManagement6634:** She did not solve her problem like an adult. She avoided it and then ran away like a little kid. Deplorable.

**beholdmytoast:** You did nothing wrong and that was incredibly selfish, cruel, and awful of her. As soon as she realized she was a lesbian she should have broken it off. She wasted minimum of 2 years of your life that she knew for sure she was a lesbian and she strung you along. Nothing makes that okay to do.

[Update #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/s/DfQFoC8GQI): **March 15, 2024 (two days later)**

*Update* My gf came out as a lesbian before our marriage and no one gives a fuck about me. You know what? Fuck you all

So here we go again like in ""GTA San Andreas"" but this time is more painful and shocking at the same time cause today and yesterday night a lot happened. Like someone of you folks said somehow one of my ex friends saw my post on TikTok and the absolut mess started and is still going on right now.

This ex friend (i will call him Paul) reached out to me and basically told me that he saw the post and knew that it was me cause i used my ex real name (Dana) and was shocked to know what really happened cause apparently Dana told my ex friends that she came out to me as a lasbian and i tried to lay hands on her and threated her (???) and she told them to not contact me again. They all believed her but then when they all saw my post they started pressuring her if my post was saying the truth or not and she admitted the lie.

Since Paul's text i recieved a ton of texts and calls from everyone asking me how i'm, if i'm fine, they are sorry for believing Dana and not texting me first and ""apologies"". But then there is the real issue: Dana.

She texted me asking to ""forgive"" her, that she was ""sorry"" for how bad she treated me and admitting that she invented all cause she was afraid to lose friends. And unfortunetly it's not all cause i got a text from her girlfriend (Mary) and basically she told me that she is sorry for Dana's behavior and for what she did and, here comes the issue, that she knew Dana since a year and she never told her about me but always talked to her about me like a ""rommate"" so she was thinking to leave Dana.

Now comes my part cause i made a new group including them all (even Dana and Mary) and told them that i'm not changing my mind about forgiving them, i was thinking to sue Dana (partially true cause i'm not sure if doing it or not) and if they (my ex friends) were decent humans they would have texted me asking me if i was out of my mind to lay hands on Dana or just insulting me via texts if they really cared about me. Then i added some personal things about Dana and blocked them all.

My blocking method isn't working cause they are continuing to herass me with texts and calls from other numbers and even making other people calling me and texting me. Crazy shit is happening and i really still can't believe at all this mess cause i'm thinking that it's all a nightmare and i need to wake up but unfortunetly it's all fucking true.

Then the other thing is that finally i saw a therapist today (a few hours ago) and i don't like to admit it but i cried a lot cause for her (the therapist) i never worked on my parents and my sister's death and then this thing with my ex added making me explode so it's gonna be a very long journey and i hope to reach a point. I already had the number of the therapist there on my table in the kitchen but never called but this time i did and hopefully it will help.

So this is all and i hope to udpate you not so quickly like now but when i will feel better.

So again thank you all and hopefully i will update you in better times.

P.S. to all the people that are following me i want to say thank you but my life is pretty boring and i don't think to post something else so you're not obligated to follow me. Then to the people that wrote me privately: thank you all and be sure that i read all your messages and i appreciate it so thank you too.

**ADDITIONAL INFO**

**Boomboxmaster:** Normal people: break up with their partner and tell everyone about it and why then move on 

Dana: ghosts her BF and lies just because she was scared
 
Honestly I would definitely sue for defamation man. You have the evidence and I don’t think it could go wrong. What do her parents think?

> **OOP:** I forgot to write this little part but the quick resume is that i never had a good relathionship with them so we never went a long well cause they always said that i wasn't the right guy for their daughter so i never cared about them but this time they asked me to think wisely and to not sue Dana cause she was ""afraid"" and they even justified her actions. That's all and in fact i wasn't surprised about their reaction to the news of marrying her.

**Top Comments**

**mak_zaddy:** Damn. You were absolutely correct calling the ex friends out because ya any good friend would have called you out on problematic behavior or at least been like “dude. What were you thinking?”
> 
> Also there is not shame in crying! Good luck on your healing journey and those folks can kick rocks.
> 
> ETA: I would create a templates response for when folks message you and just copy/paste it. But it’s funny how they had no problem ghosting you but now can’t accept you telling them to F off.

**Beginning_Fix_5609:** Op just change your phone number so your ex and toxic friends won’t call you again. Focus on your healing and I pray you find the happiness and love you deserve.

[Final Update](https://redd.it/1c4lwtf): **April 15, 2024 (one month later)**

A month passed by my first post and here i'm again. I know that i promised to be here again when things would be better and i hoped for that very much but unfortunetly my life isn't better at all and things are going always worst than i expected. I'm gonna talk like i talk with my therapist cause a little bit you all are like my therapist hahahah.

You know i'm not an expert of therapy and this things and i hoped that in a short time things would change and would make me feel better but it's more difficult and longer than i expected and imaginated. I'm crying everyday about all that happened to me, about my parents and my little sister premature death, what happened with Dana and how my friends betrayed me so easily like i was just a random guy. The worst thing is about Dana. After my parents death i put all my attention and importance on her, she was like my promise to have a new family and start a new life together and be again a family. In all this years i tried my best to make her feel loved, happy and cared. What maybe don't transpires from my old posts is how much i loved her and how much i cared about her cause Dana was the only person in this world that knew me 100% and she was for real my ""soft spot"". After my retirment from the army she was the one that saw the real me after those years risking my life (i still have some traumas but i'm working even on that) and then i knew Dana and it was love at the first sight.

So yes call me naive, that i still believe in the fairy tales but i really thought that she was ""the one"" for me and that could finally give me my ""dream"" of having a family that i lost. The worst and most difficult thing in this month was to finally change my number and start again. I mean i thought many times to call her, text her and even see her again cause despise all this mess i still, somehow, care and love her but than i think again at how poorly and badly she treated me and i change my mind but her presence is still very present there in my mind. I still miss those little things that we were doing together, i miss Dana being messy and a little goofy around me and my house, i miss her touch, coming back from work and just seeing her was like all my stress and bad emotions were gone in a second.

But a a part this a few good things happened in this month cause i got the promotion that i really craved for, even if i got it in the worst moment of my life, and my boss gave me 3 weeks of ""forced vacations"" cause he is worried about my mental health and how i work day and night without doing anything else. (My therapist told me too to take a few weeks of vacations to ""clarify my thoughts"") And that i'm watching for another house near my work cause my actual house isn't a ""positive environment"" (my therapist's words) and because i need a drastic change.

So things are this and unfortunetly i still have those suicidal thoughts but i'm working on it even if again it will take time.

So this everything and i don't think to post anything else from now on cause i don't have anything else to say (fortunetly) about my situation if not thank you all for your support and private texts.

So: people thank you all and hopefully even this period of my life will pass without creating too much damage.

P.S. my ex-friends never contacted me again and Dana too so i don't know anything about what is going on between them and sincerly i don't care. (Maybe...)

**Top Comments**

**ugly_warlord:** Hey bud, I wish you well. I can only sympathize with your situation. However, from what I've seen on Reddit and the updates people give out, we see that people do find their happiness someday.

Being low is something every person has to feel, and I guess it is a way to learn (count it as a failure if you will), but then maybe as a person looking from an outside perspective, all I can see is new opportunities. If I were in your position, I would be hurt as much as you, but t what I learned from my experience in failures over the time of my existence, is that you may look back and think ""What a fuss I made of my life over THIS!""

Hang in there and good luck.

**cottoncandyoverlord:** I'm sorry this happened to you. I actually had something similar myself. I unfortunately walked in on my ex-husband going at it on my best guy friend. I was crushed. I thought I would die. It took about a year to work past it for me. I did a lot of self work. I went to school, got a degree, dated several people, and eventually found my current husband. We have been married for 12 years and have 3 kids now.

I, too, lost nearly all of my friends. It was challenging being alone, but I made it. Both of my parents have been gone for many years so I did go it alone. I took counseling and just kept looking forward to the day I felt better. I know this hurts. I know you miss her, but it WILL get better with time. Keep working on yourself. Find new hobbies and work on personal improvements. Throw out anything that was her's. She is essentially dead to you until you are healthy enough to confront her.

You can msg me if you need to vent. You got this.

[I bumped into Mary yesterday....](https://redd.it/1cilck5): **May 2, 2024 (2.5 weeks later)**

Hello people, don't worry i'm still alive hahahah. According to my therapist i can use this little place to vent about my thoughts, the things that happens to me and updates about my life so here i'm. (I'm not very good with Reddit so i hope to do things in the right way)

Like i said in the title yesterday i got a ""strange"" meeting with Mary and it was a better meeting than i thought. So i was at this bar of my city and i was in line to order when Mary recognized me and we had a talk. I offered her a cup of coffee and we chatted a bit about our life, how things are going and all this stuff. I must admit that she seems like a sweet and kind girl and she immediatly asked me if i was mad at her for what happened with Dana but i assured her that she wasn't the problem at all cause she didn't knew about me as Dana's ex bf so she wasn't the problem. Mary said that i was much better now compared to 2 almost 2 months ago so she was happy about me. According to Mary the day i made the group and blocked them all she and Dana argued a lot and they broke up. She told me again that she was extremely sorry for what happened and how this mess all happened and that if she knew it before she would never had dated Dana before cause she have some values.

We chatted for like 2 hours and we knew each other better, after we exchanged numbers and she told me that if i nedeed to talk, vent or just rant about something with someone she would be there for me. I appreciated it a lot and then i went to my house.

It was honestly a nice meeting and i wouldn't bet a cent on it but it's nice to be wrong sometimes hahahah.

This a part my life since a few days seems to return to the ""normal"", i didn't had suicidal thoughts since 2 weeks (and this is a great achievment to me) and actually my mental health finally is going better. In 3 days i would be in Japan for the 3 weeks vacation and i hope to be good and to progress always with my mental health so we will see.

That's all and i never told anyone my name but i'm Clark.

Peace and thank you all for your dm's i'm starting to believe you and to appreciate your support.❤️

#----NEW UPDATE----

**Editor's Note: OOP has returned with a new update, but this time, he explains the life event taking place in his life after moving forward from his ex**

&nbsp;

[I have news but they aren't good. You know what? Everything comes to an end and this is the real beauty of life.](https://www.reddit.com/user/Guilty-Pollution-742/comments/1ia1d3u/i_have_news_but_they_arent_good_you_know_what/): **January 25, 2025 (8.5 months later)**

Hey people, it's still me Clark. I know that i disappeared for months but something big happened and made me think a lot about what to do, how to react to this and all this stuff. 

First of all i don't see my therapist anymore and i thanked her for what she did for me cause she really really helped me. 

And now the ""big"" news unfortunetly isn't a good news. I have cancer. To be completely honest i should have noticed it before cause many things were off but i always blamed stress, what was happening, my personal issues and all this stuff but unfortunetly it wasn't stress. 

Now before anyone says it, yes i'm sure it's cancer cause i had 3 different tests in 3 different hospitals and they went back all the same. But you know what? Is fine. It's one of those curable cancers but here comes the thing that kept me thinking a lot. I made a promise on my family's grave and i have all the intentions to keep it. 

For how much for you can be insane or non sense for me have a lot of sense. So the thing is this: i'm not going to cure it. I'm just happy to have leaved my life. I had incredible ups and incredibles downs but it's ok. It's life, no one ever told me that life was easy or a fairy tale and we have to accept it and endure to life our life as we want. I tried to do it and between ups and downs i'm happy of my life. I met incredible people, i saw how strangers on the internet can really help you( I mean you guys of Reddit❤️), I had my dream job, i had my dog and i traveled a lot. But everything comes to an end like it should be. I wasn't expecting to have this short life to live but it's ok. I take things for how they're.

So just this, i made a promise on my family's grave that i will reach them and i'm going to keep my promise.

So folks of Reddit, you made a life of a stranger a bit better and i will always and forever keep you all in my mind and my heart. I wouldn't bet a cent on it(sincerly) but it's awesome to be wrong in this cases ahahah. So thank you all, i hope for you all the best life, to see the world, to love like never, to enjoy what all this world can offer you and remember this: you all made a stranger life BETTER!!!

Love you all and enjoy your life at full❤️

Thanks, Clark.

It was maybe 2010, essentially living in poverty, somewhat homeless (couch surfing), end stage alcoholic, heavy smoker, living off KFC where I worked, life falling apart. Guessing all of those factors contributed to the start of psoriasis for me. Randomly my head explodes with massive bumps… WHAT THE FUCK? 

Off to the doctors. You have psoriasis. Then came the scalp scrapes. I felt disgusted. I had beautiful medium length wavy / curly hair and every time I did a scalp scrape with this thick oil and a comb a ton of my hair was coming out with the plaques. 

Nov 7, 2011 I surrendered and went to AA. I would say not drinking or doing drugs had a major impact on my plaques after some time. A few years later I was looking into giving up fast food. Then I cut out soda for the most part - maybe 1 every few months, substituted with seltzer water and increased water intake. 

Then I hit another stage of cutting out the majority of processed foods and incorporating organic food, largely fruit and vegetable based + legumes. I also quit coffee entirely and switched to the occasional tea but not dependent on it to wake up or any routine with it. 

I still have red spots on my head but haven’t really had plaques in years, occasionally a small one. The redness I can’t figure out but it’s progress. The only area that seems to have not improved much are my elbows, a couple spots on my knees and around my butthole which is not fun wiping… idk if anyone has a cream they’d recommend for that one lol 

I also noticed that shaving my head bald seems to help with the red spots after a couple days. 

I think my next challenges are dairy, gluten and cigarettes but have been on deck with those for years. Guess I reached a point where I’m somewhat comfortable with the current state. 

Anyone else try these things and find success? I personally think it’s a reaction to a number of factors and changing diet can have a major impact. At least that’s my experience. Hope this helps someone. ",2,1739163491.0,Psoriasis,1,1.0,False

I’m relocating from Pasadena to DTLA for work and am trying to decide between Aven Apartments and Apex Apartments for a 2B2B. I’ve toured both and have some initial thoughts, but I’d love to hear from people who have lived in or are familiar with these buildings.

My Impressions So Far:

Apex: The units themselves seem nicer, and I like that it has access to amenities at its sister building, Alina.

Aven: Loved the views, and it seemed to have better amenities and common spaces. I also thought the immediate area had more coffee shops, bars, and general activity—but that’s just based on one visit.

What I’d Love to Know:

- Location & Safety: Which one is in a better area in terms of walkability, nightlife, and general safety?

- Accessibility: How easy is it to get around from each place (groceries, public transport, freeway access, etc.)?

- Building Management: How is the maintenance, security, and responsiveness of management in each building?

- Anything Else I Should Consider? If there are dealbreakers or things I might not have thought about, I’d love to hear them!

I also checked out Pegasus, Skye at Bunker Hill, and Onyx, but they didn’t stand out to me as much as Aven and Apex.

If you’ve lived in or have insight into either of these apartments, I’d really appreciate your thoughts. Thanks in advance!",2,1739163374.0,MovingToLosAngeles,0,1.0,False

(I'm 24 now). I eventually got back in contact with her and she had recently broken up with her boyfriend about 2 months ago.

I understand she's in a vulnerable state right now, and genuinely just want to try and reach out the help her.

And the clarify, she was absolutely flirting with me so I know she was interested.

The thing is she keeps her phone on do not disturb when she's feeling overwhelmed, which has happened to be the past almost entire month, so she hasn't contacted me at all, and I've been meaning to try and take her out of the fun coffee date so we could catch up, and the hopefully distract her because I'm genuinely worried for her.

She wasn’t feeling the way she thought she would after dating for a few months and she doesn’t want to open herself up to the possibility of getting hurt by someone who isn’t 100% on kids. Though when she talked about them she said it was something she’d love to do but wouldn’t force it if it wasn’t in the cards 

Meanwhile there were moments she remembered details about me, about our dates, said how special I was and how lucky she was to kiss me. I feel like an idiot…as if I read the situation so wrong. I know I changed my mind but I started seeing her differently. 

She held my hands, stared into my eyes, and kissed me while she ended things and we talked. Also mentioning “if it’s meant to be it’s meant to be” and hesitated when I asked if her mind was made up. She also admitted that the way we decided it was a non-starter had her guarded and could contribute to her feeling emotionally closed off. It was so so confusing

\*ETA: I don't know how to upload a photo of my screenshot, the option to do so is grayed out?

I had my PA husband to send me a screen recording of his Instagram (we're still long distance, international). He supposedly rarely uses it, just to see the things I send him or sometimes send me cute love stuff. Anyways, when he was going to show me his recent searches, he accidentally hit the letter ""b"" in the search bar for a very split second. But I put in the effort and managed a screenshot of what suggest results popped up. I need help understanding!

He ONLY follows my account, I'm his only follower, he's private, and he doesn't have any profile picture or photos posted.

The top result is a coffee shop local to me that we often go to when he visits, and I know he has searched for it on Insta the other week while he was here with me. The other results are random girls with small accounts and are 100% innocent. Nothing suspicious about it and no links or anything (one actually follows the same anti-porn help group that I do on Insta). I blurred them out for their privacy, as I think those are genuinely random or linked to my activities since I'm the only account he follows.

But this last one?!?!? It's an OF girl's small account that links to all her shit and to her main Insta platform. Why would that be there??? He claims he doesn't know who ""Bella"" is (I haven't sent him the screenshot because I don't want to give him a reason to look her up if he genuinely doesn't know of her). She's German, so closer to him (he's European, I'm not) and has a similar look and aesthetic as me, but is sluttier and ""enhanced"" compared to me. I know I'm naturally beautiful, but seeing her in his suggestions made me feel like that's who/how he wishes I was.

Anyways, I need to know if this means he's been directly looking at her/searching for her or if it's a generalized, random suggestion like the others seem to be. Not good either way, but I'd feel better if it's just the algorithm still being messed up from past actions vs. him specifically seeking HER out, ya know?

I’ve technically met everyone I know online, even my current irl friends, over the years and still haven’t gotten robbed, gone missing, and still have both my kidneys so I figured why not try looking for a Valentine 👉👈

**Quick general TLDR about me:**

I’m a nerdy guy who’s a B.A psychology graduate and currently working for experience to apply to a counseling Master’s program this year or the next. I plan on staying in California for that, L.A or San Jose. so hopefully you’re in or interested in those areas. The quickest way I can describe myself is that I’m typically the chillest quietest guy in the room who randomly will spit out the funniest line of the night and then go back to just existing in the group. Idk if that does me justice but I keep getting invited to places soo 🤷

**So what am I into?**

* Anime/manga - I prefer the depressing ones, the ones that make you question life for an entire month, or the ones that are so funny you start crying from laughter. I also like non-anime ( Arcane is goated) Breaking Bad, The Boys, etc. I haven’t watched/finished many of the popular shows if wanna watch them with me :p
* Gaming - I’m mainly casual but can be competitive. I prefer co-op, team, and survival crafting games. Monster Hunter, Terraria, and Souls-like games are my favorites. I also play new or popular games as well, league of Legends 💀, Marvel Rivals,etc
* Cooking - I steal recipes from restaurants and feel comfortable attempting to cook anything… aside from baking … I .. uhm.. I don’t wanna talk about that.
* Working out - I kinda like to be active but tbh I’m still trying to be consistent ( I’ve legit been on and off working out for 3-6 months periods like 3-4 times now haha…)
* Etc/ stuff I’m into but don’t do often - Camping, swimming, canoeing, rafting, writing, hiking.
* Stuff I want to get into- Cosplay, going to gaming/anime conventions, learning a new language( Japanese or Spanish), learning how to draw digital art, and getting back into video editing/making.

It’d be cool if you were into a lot of these but anime and gaming are my main hobbies and I’d love to share at least ONE of my main hobbies with someone special.

**What I’m looking for:**

Someone single, childless, nerdy into anime and or gaming, preferably a yap-aholic who’s escaped yap-rehab for the second time this week, and is in the L.A area or San Jose area or at most 1-2 hours driving distance from those areas. 

My only REAL physical preference is that you be smaller than me. Mega ultra extra bonus points if you like being carried, lifted, and sitting on people’s shoulders.

**Potential green flag/red flags** ( hopefully green flags)

* Politically I’m very left-leaning. I can’t see myself dating a republican/right-leaning person.
* Non-religious and never will be..( unless I’m gambling in-game, then I’m the most religious man you’ll ever meet lol )
* I’m 50/50 on children and don’t expect to be ready to have children until I’m roughly mid-late 30’s 
* Heavily prefers cats over dogs but does well with either.
* I very rarely drink and don’t smoke. I am a coffee fiend though... 
* My humor is uhmm yeaaa pretty brain-rotted - dark humor, random humor, memes, the worst puns.

Welp anyways, If I sound like your mans, make my inbox turn orange already :)

 Please include your ASL, a picture or physical description,  and a little bit about yourself in your message!

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1ilxrmc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ruleshorror/comments/1ilxrmc/my_job_at_radio_station_in_the_night_shift_left/,My Job at Radio Station in the Night Shift Left Me A List of Strange RULES TO FOLLOW,"When I first got the job at VSRP, the local midnight radio station, I thought I had hit the jackpot of easy living. Sit in a creaky chair, play some records for a few night owls and insomniacs, maybe humor a couple of bored callers if I was in the mood. The pay? Not exactly dream-worthy, but enough to scrape by. Rent, groceries, and the occasional beer were all I needed. It was the kind of gig where you showed up half-asleep and left half-conscious, and I was fine with that.

The station itself was nothing to write home about. An old, peeling building squatted by a lonely rural highway, its silhouette swallowed by a thick canopy of looming trees. It carried a certain outdated charm—or maybe just the weight of abandonment. The walls inside were lined with wood paneling that had warped over the years, as if they were slowly sagging into a permanent shrug. The break room smelled faintly of mildew and cheap instant coffee, and the sagging couch there looked like it had been rescued from a junkyard decades ago. A flickering neon sign buzzed feebly above the front door, casting sickly pink light on the gravel lot. The equipment, a mismatched collection of knobs, dials, and cassette decks, was older than me—ancient in tech years—but it worked, albeit with the same reluctance as an aging horse forced to trot.

The man who hired me, Carl, had a wiry build and an unsettling nervous energy. His fingers twitched when he handed me the keys, and his eyes darted around the room like he was expecting something—or someone—to leap out of the shadows. “Here’s the rundown,” he muttered, barely meeting my gaze. His voice was as thin as his frame, trembling slightly. He gestured vaguely at the equipment, gave me a rushed tutorial on how to operate the aging machines, and then handed me a single piece of paper.

It was a list.

“Follow these exactly,” he said, his tone dropping an octave. “No exceptions.”

I laughed, thinking he was trying to spook me, leaning into the whole eerie late-night DJ vibe. But Carl didn’t laugh back. His expression hardened, his lips tightening as if my chuckle had offended him. He shoved the paper into my hand, his fingers gripping mine just a second too long. “I’m serious,” he hissed, his eyes boring into mine. “You mess this up, you’re not gonna like what happens.”

I unfolded the list, still half-expecting it to be a prank. But as I read the rules, an uneasy weight settled in my chest.

The rules were bizarre, borderline absurd:

* Play a jazz record at exactly 3:06 AM. It *must* be jazz. No exceptions.
* Never answer calls from Line 7. If it rings, let it ring.
* If you hear knocking on the studio door, check the security camera before opening it. If no one’s there, don’t open it.
* Do not play the same song twice in one night.
* If you hear static coming from the microphone when it’s off, turn off all the lights and sit quietly until it stops.

I wanted to roll my eyes and ask Carl if this was some kind of hazing ritual for new hires, but when I looked up, his face stopped me cold. His eyes were wide, pupils dilated, and a fine sheen of sweat glistened on his forehead. He looked... scared. Not nervous, not joking—*scared*.

That first night, I didn’t take any chances. I followed the rules, partly out of respect for the job but mostly because Carl’s reaction had rattled me more than I wanted to admit. The shift passed uneventfully. Line 7 stayed silent, the door stayed still, and the microphone didn’t so much as crackle. For a moment, I thought Carl had just been overly paranoid.

But then came the second night. And that’s when I got careless.

The first few hours of my shift were uneventful. I spun some classic rock—familiar tunes that made the graveyard hours feel less lonely. A couple of bored night owls called in to chat, their voices crackling with the kind of late-night aimlessness that only comes with insomnia. I read a few ad scripts, stumbling slightly over one for a discount furniture store, and chuckled to myself as I imagined who could possibly be listening at this hour. It was all routine, quiet, mundane.

Then, as the clock inched closer to 3:00 AM, I remembered Carl’s jazz rule. My stomach did a little flip, a combination of annoyance and unease. I’d almost forgotten. Grumbling under my breath, I began rifling through the station’s dusty stacks of vinyl, my fingers brushing against worn, paper-thin sleeves. Most of the records were decades old, their covers faded and stained, smelling faintly of mildew and neglect. Finally, I found an old Miles Davis album. The sleeve was tattered, the vinyl scratched, but it would do. I slid it onto the turntable and set it up, waiting for the clock to tick to 3:06.

When the second hand struck the mark, I dropped the needle onto the record. The warm, honeyed sound of the trumpet poured out of the speakers, filling the studio with smooth, soulful energy. I leaned back in my chair, letting out a satisfied breath. *Good job*, I thought. I’d remembered. No mistakes tonight.

But as the music played, something started to feel... off. At first, it was subtle—just a faint noise, barely noticeable beneath the melody. I dismissed it as static or the wear of the old vinyl. But the longer I listened, the more it seemed like something else. Like a whisper.

I leaned forward, my ear closer to the monitor, trying to make out the sound. My skin prickled. The whisper wasn’t random—it had a rhythm, a cadence, like someone muttering just below the surface of the music. My pulse quickened, and I turned up the volume slightly, straining to catch it. The whisper grew louder, more distinct, until it wasn’t a whisper anymore. It was a voice. Low, raspy, and... wrong.

“Don’t stop,” it said.

I froze, my breath caught in my throat. My eyes flicked to the microphone. The red light was off. It wasn’t live. The voice wasn’t coming from me.

My heart pounded against my ribs as I stared at the speakers, hoping, *praying*, that I was imagining things. But then it came again, clearer this time.

“Don’t stop the music.”

I shot out of my chair, panic surging through me. My hands trembled as I stopped the record, the needle screeching as it lifted from the vinyl. The voice cut off instantly. The studio was silent—so silent that the hum of the old fluorescent light above me sounded deafening.

I stood there, frozen, trying to catch my breath. I glanced at the clock. My stomach dropped.

3:10 AM. Four minutes late.

A wave of dread washed over me. My fingers gripped the edge of the console as Carl’s warning echoed in my mind. *You’re not gonna like what happens.*

The phone rang.

Not just any phone—Line 7.

The shrill, electronic cry cut through the suffocating silence, sharp and jarring. I flinched, my heart slamming against my ribs. My eyes locked on the blinking red light of the forbidden line, and my stomach churned. Carl’s words pounded in my head: *Never answer calls from Line 7.*

It rang again.

And again.

Each ring seemed to grow louder, more piercing, like the sound itself was burrowing into my skull. My hands trembled as I took an instinctive step back from the desk, bumping into the chair behind me. The room felt colder, darker. The air was thick, heavy, like the walls themselves were closing in.

The ringing didn’t stop.

It kept going. Louder and louder, more shrill with every chime, until it felt like the entire building was vibrating with it. I clapped my hands over my ears, desperate to block out the sound, and squeezed my eyes shut, my breaths coming in ragged, shallow gasps.

And then, as suddenly as it had started, it stopped.

Silence.

I opened my eyes—and froze.

The studio was pitch black. Every light—the overhead fluorescents, the control panel, even the flickering neon sign outside—was out. The soft hum of electricity that I hadn’t even realized I’d been hearing was gone, swallowed up by the darkness. The world outside the windows was nothing but an impenetrable void.

I couldn’t move. Couldn’t breathe.

Then I heard it.

Knocking.

At first, it was barely there. A soft, rhythmic tapping on the studio door, so faint I almost convinced myself it was my imagination.

*Check the security camera before opening it.* Carl’s rule came rushing back to me.

My fingers fumbled across the desk, searching blindly in the darkness for the monitor switch. I found it and flipped it on with trembling hands. The screen flickered to life, casting a pale, ghostly glow over the room.

The hallway outside the studio came into view. The grainy black-and-white feed showed nothing but the empty corridor stretching out into the shadows.

The knocking came again, louder this time.

“Who’s there?” I croaked, my voice thin and cracking with fear.

No answer.

The camera feed remained empty. The hallway was still and lifeless, but the sound of knocking persisted. It grew sharper, more urgent, each blow reverberating through the studio walls.

Bang.

Bang.

Bang.

It wasn’t a polite knock anymore. It was angry, violent, as if someone—or *something*—was trying to force its way inside. My legs buckled, and I stumbled back, clutching the crumpled list of rules in my hand like it was a lifeline, as though it might somehow shield me from whatever was out there.

And then, just as quickly as it had begun, the banging stopped.

Silence fell over the studio once more.

But it wasn’t the comforting kind of silence. It was oppressive, unnatural, a void that pressed against my ears and made my chest feel tight. The absence of noise was worse than the sound itself.

I stood frozen, every muscle locked, my ears straining against the suffocating quiet, waiting for what would come next.

I sat there, folded into myself, knees pressed tightly to my chest like they were the only thing holding me together. The studio felt like a tomb, and I was its reluctant occupant. Every sound—the groaning of the building settling, the faint whispers of the wind through the trees—felt magnified, sinister. My eyes darted around the blackened room, searching for threats I couldn’t see.

And then it came.

The static.

It started softly, around 4:00 AM, a faint crackle that barely broke the suffocating silence. I froze, my blood turning to ice. It was coming from the microphone. The one I knew for a fact was off—I’d switched it off hours ago. But there it was, alive with that eerie, unnatural hiss.

At first, I tried to convince myself it was just a malfunction, maybe interference from the storm clouds gathering outside. But deep down, I knew better.

The static grew louder, its pitch shifting in a way that made the hair on the back of my neck stand on end. I stared at the mic, its lifeless red light mocking me. My breath quickened.

Then the voice came.

“Why didn’t you follow the rules?”

It was the same voice I’d heard earlier, low and grating, but now there was venom in it, an unfiltered fury that made my stomach churn.

I scrambled to the control panel, my hands shaking as I tried to shut it down. I jabbed at the buttons, twisted the knobs, yanked at wires. Nothing worked. The microphone seemed alive, immune to my desperation.

The voice came again, louder this time.

“Why didn’t you follow the rules?”

Each word seemed to stab into my mind, echoing and expanding until it was all I could hear. The static swelled, its relentless buzz filling the room like a flood, drowning out my thoughts, my heartbeat, everything.

“Why didn’t you follow the rules?”

It wasn’t just coming from the speakers anymore. It was *everywhere*—the walls, the floor, the air itself. It burrowed into my head, reverberating like a thunderclap inside my skull. My hands flew to my ears, but it didn’t help. The sound was already in me.

I screamed, the raw sound ripping from my throat, but it was swallowed up by the cacophony. The static surged, a deafening roar that left no room for anything else.

And then—

Silence.

It stopped.

The sudden quiet was like a slap, almost more jarring than the noise had been. My ears rang, my body trembling as I stared at the microphone, now dormant, as if nothing had happened.

But I knew better. Something had changed. Something was watching. Waiting.

The lights flickered back on, weak and hesitant at first, before fully flooding the studio with their dull, buzzing glow. It felt unnatural, like the building itself had been holding its breath and now, reluctantly, was letting it out. I blinked against the sudden brightness, my vision adjusting, and for a moment, it was like waking up from a nightmare I wasn’t entirely sure was over.

The clock on the wall ticked steadily, its hands resting on 6:00 AM. My shift was over. The night that had stretched on for what felt like an eternity had finally given way to morning. But the usual relief—the kind that comes with punching out and heading home—was nowhere to be found. All I felt was exhaustion, fear, and the weight of something unseen pressing down on me.

My legs wobbled as I stood, the journey from the studio to the parking lot feeling longer than it ever should. The crisp morning air hit me like a shock, but it wasn’t refreshing. It was cold and indifferent, a harsh reminder that the world outside had gone on, oblivious to whatever horror lurked within that studio.

Carl was waiting in the parking lot, leaning against his battered old sedan. His face was pale, drawn tight with a weariness that looked permanent, like someone who had seen too much and didn’t bother trying to forget anymore. His eyes locked onto mine, and in that moment, I knew he didn’t need to ask. He could see it written all over me.

“You broke the rules, didn’t you?” His voice was soft, but there was no sympathy in it. Just resignation.

I nodded, my throat too dry to form words.

Carl sighed heavily, like a man carrying a burden that was never truly his but one he had resigned himself to bear. From his pocket, he pulled out a folded sheet of paper, edges worn and smudged with fingerprints. He handed it to me without a word.

I unfolded it with trembling hands. A new list. Different rules. Stricter. Stranger.

“Next time,” Carl said, his tone as serious as a funeral, “do exactly what it says. Or you won’t make it to the morning.”

His words hung in the air, chilling and absolute. I wanted to ask him what “it” was, what exactly haunted the studio during those suffocating midnight hours. But the look in his eyes silenced me. I didn’t want to know. Not really.

Carl climbed into his car and drove off, leaving me alone in the parking lot. The paper in my hand felt heavier than it should, like it carried the weight of some dark truth I was now bound to.

I still don’t know what’s out there, what claws at the edges of the station during those cursed hours. But I’ve learned one thing, burned into my mind like a brand: the rules aren’t suggestions. They’re not some quirky manual written by a paranoid ex-employee. They’re a lifeline. The only thing standing between me and whatever waits in the shadows.

Every time I clock in now, I read the list. Over and over. I memorize every line, every rule, as if my life depends on it. Because it does. I don’t question them. I don’t get curious.

Curiosity is what killed the last guy. I never met him, but I see the name scratched into the desk, carved by a trembling hand.

Because the moment you stop following the rules?

I would also like to note 4 others in our group DID NOT purchase the tasting card nor eat the same foods we did and they were completely fine.  We also met at the park and didn’t consume any food before hand so it’s pretty obvious the food poisoning came from something at the park. Has anyone ever known Disney to remedy similar issues? I paid $35 for parking, $48 for the tasting card I didn’t even get to fully use because I felt so unwell and left the park early. This visit used 1 of my 3 socal resident pass tickets. Wondering if it’s even worth reaching out to Disney over or if it’s pointless and they’ll just say sorry and investigate their food safety practices. Basically I spent a lot of money to be miserable at the park, have a ROUGH hour drive home and be sick all night and into Sunday. I’m petty upset with this experience but also willing to cut my losses because Disney just doesn’t seem like the company to offer refunds.
