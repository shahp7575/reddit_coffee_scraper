So I built a tool that summarizes new videos automatically,"https://preview.redd.it/k47dm7o1baag1.png?width=2368&format=png&auto=webp&s=f3aab0020546e440af93e0cf1a9a05c17ed7a9da

I follow about 30 channels for work (AI, Tech, Marketing). The problem is, keeping up with them feels like a part-time job. I was spending 2 hours a day watching videos just to find the 5 minutes of actual signal.

The Solution (Recapio Recaps): I built a ""Daily Feed"" that treats YouTube channels like an RSS reader, but for summaries.

How it works:

It monitors my selected channels (e.g., Huberman, YC, The Verge).

When a new video drops, it auto-generates a structured summary (Key Insights, Arguments, Action Items).

It pushes it to a clean ""Recap Feed"" so I can skim 10 videos in 5 minutes over coffee.

The Result: My ""Watch Later"" playlist is finally empty. I only click ""Play"" on the videos that are actually worth the deep dive.

It’s a work in progress. Would love to know if you guys prefer this ""Feed"" view or if you'd rather have these sent as a morning email?

# What Are AI Agents? The Basics Explained

At their heart, AI agents are autonomous systems powered by artificial intelligence that perceive their environment, process data, and take actions to achieve specific goals,without constant human oversight. Unlike traditional chatbots that spit out responses, AI agents exhibit reasoning, planning, and memory, making them true digital teammates. Think of them as the evolution of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning models, blending [AI](https://www.secuodsoft.com/ai-machine-learning-development.php) automation with real-time adaptability.

In 2026, what are AI agents boils down to four pillars:

* Perception: Gathering data from sensors, APIs, or user inputs (e.g. voice commands or emails).
* Reasoning: Using algorithms to analyze and decide (hello, large language models like GPT-5).
* Action: Executing tasks, from sending messages to optimizing supply chains.
* Learning: Improving over time via feedback loops, turning one-off tasks into self-optimizing routines.

Why the hype? AI agents slash operational costs by 30-50% in sectors like finance and healthcare, while boosting user satisfaction through hyper-personalization. If you’ve ever used Siri to set reminders or Alexa to control your smart home, you’ve dipped your toes in simple AI agents. But as we edge into multi-modal eras, handling text, images, and video, these intelligent agents are set to redefine productivity.

# How Do AI Agents Work? A Step-by-Step Breakdown

Curious about the magic behind AI agents? It’s not wizardry; it’s a symphony of tech stacks. AI agents operate in a loop: observe, decide, act, learn. Here’s how it unfolds in 2025’s landscape:

* Input Gathering: Via APIs or sensors, agents pull in data, like market trends for a stock-trading bot.
* Processing with LLMs: Leveraging models like Grok-3 or Claude 3.5, they reason contextually, incorporating reinforcement learning for smarter choices.
* Decision Engine: Tools like LangChain or AutoGPT orchestrate actions, ensuring autonomous AI aligns with goals.
* Execution & Feedback: Agents act (e.g., booking a meeting) and refine via user input or analytics.

This AI agents workflow thrives on edge computing for speed and federated learning for privacy, key trends in 2026. Pro tip: Start small with no-code platforms like Zapier’s AI agents to test AI automation without a dev team.

# Types of AI Agents: From Simple to Super-Smart in 2026

Not all AI agents are created equal. In 2026, types of AI agents range from reactive bots to collaborative swarms, categorized by complexity and capability. Understanding these helps you pick the right intelligent agent for your needs, whether it’s a quick task automator or a full-fledged decision-maker.

Here’s a handy table breaking down the 7 key types of AI agents, complete with use cases and 2025 twists:

|Type of AI Agent|Description|Key Features|2025 Use Case Example|Complexity Level|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Simple Reflex Agents|React to current inputs without memory (if-then rules).|Rule-based, fast execution.|Spam filters in email clients.|Low|
|Model-Based Reflex Agents|Use internal models to track past states for better reactions.|Environmental modeling, basic memory.|Smart thermostats adjusting to habits.|Low-Medium|
|Goal-Based Agents|Plan actions to reach predefined objectives.|Search algorithms, path planning.|Navigation apps like Waze rerouting.|Medium|
|Utility-Based Agents|Evaluate options based on desirability (utility functions).|Optimization, trade-off analysis.|Recommendation engines on Netflix.|Medium-High|
|Learning Agents|Adapt and improve from experience using ML.|Reinforcement learning, neural nets.|Personalized fitness coaches like WHOOP.|High|
|Hierarchical Agents|Layered structure for complex tasks (sub-agents handle subtasks).|Modular design, scalability.|Enterprise ERP systems like SAP AI.|High|
|Multi-Agent Systems|Teams of agents collaborating or competing.|Coordination protocols, swarm intel.|Autonomous drone fleets in logistics.|Very High|

These types of AI agents evolve with LLM agents,large language model hybrids dominating 2025, where 60% of new deployments are multi-modal. For businesses, start with goal-based agents for quick wins in AI automation.

I’m a beginner adult pianist and I’m trying to decide between a Roland and a Kawai digital piano (thinking FP-10/30X vs ES60/ES120-level).

Before buying, I’d really love to actually play them side by side instead of just reading endless threads. So far, the only place I’ve found that might have both is up in San Marcos, which is a bit of a haul — so I thought I’d ask if there’s anywhere closer in San Diego (I'm in Point Loma).

Does anyone know:

* A local store where I could try both Roland and Kawai digital pianos side by side?
* If there's another digital piano that might have an action very similar to the Kawai (at Guitar Center, maybe, since they have the Rolands)
* Or possibly a teacher, studio, or private owner who might be open to letting a beginner try one briefly?

Totally understand if that’s a long shot — just hoping to avoid buying blind. Happy to bring coffee!

# Mastering Your French Press Coffee

The French press. It’s a champion of simplicity and a gateway to rich, full-bodied coffee. But are you truly unlocking its potential? The secret often lies less in the press itself and more in the coffee you choose.

For the uninitiated, the French press method is all about immersion. Coffee grounds steep directly in hot water, and the resulting oils and fine particles aren't filtered out by paper. This is why selecting the right coffee and grind size is paramount. Too fine, and you’ll end up with sludge and bitterness. Too coarse, and the flavor won’t extract properly.

*   **Grind Size is King:** Aim for a coarse, uniform grind, resembling sea salt. This prevents over-extraction and makes pressing the plunger smooth.
*   **Bean Freshness Matters:** Always use freshly roasted whole beans and grind them just before brewing. Pre-ground coffee loses its volatile aromatics quickly.
*   **Roast Profile Harmony:** Medium to dark roasts often shine in a French press, their bolder flavors standing up well to the immersion brewing method.

Elevate your morning ritual from good to exceptional. Experience the difference that the right coffee makes.

Explore our curated selection of whole bean coffees perfect for your French press today!

I really do feel like I cannot have people in my life, despite wanting connection. I am single, I don't have familiy, and throughout my life I don't think I have been someone close friend (although I have felt like that person maybe was mine).   
  
Over the past few years, life has become more isolating. I am in my late 20s and don't really date at all despite wanting to.I just work and then go home. I can go easily a week without maybe talking to another person if I don't work that week. I work as a classical musician so my job is very social. I love getting to talk to people and just connect but when everything is over and I get in my car to drive home, it feels like the biggest crash. To go from so many people to absolute nothing hits hard. To know that the long drive home through the night is leading my back to a home where there is no one waiting to see me feels cold.    
  
I used to have some pets and that was nice but my last pet passed this summer and I don't think I can handle another event like that so I haven't tried to adopt again. In a month sometimes, the only people I may ever speak with 1 on 1 might be just my students (I teach my instrument privately). I never use those lessons as a social hour. I always make sure they are getting what the need from me but I do sometimes wish we could just talk about their week the whole hour and see how they are doing as people. When my phone vibrates, I get excited thinking maybe someone is reaching out but it is almost always an app notification.   
  
I've noticed I have developed a bad habit of getting coffee or takeout most days just so I could go chat with someone for a brief moment... it makes me feel a bit embarrassed in retrospect. I think I'm a fun and even likable person but I don't think my history is telling me that. I think if i was more of those qualitiies, I'd likely have more friends and conenctions. People will laugh with me and compliment aspects of my personality sometimes but I dont think that overcomes what other issues they may see in me to get a bit closer. Sometimes life feels delusional. As if I am walking around with glasses that make myself appear normal to me but in reality I am far from that. I am on the spectrum and high masking but people likely just get a feeling maybe. I just hope there is a period in my life where it isn't like this. The life I wish I could have entails someone I can wake up next to, and people nearby I can see, who also want to see me.

This year I've got the time, the health (knock on wood), and the circumstances needed to pull this off. I even have a hotel reservation. 

But the airfares are OUTRAGEOUS, and even with that, the itineraries are all overnight, with a +1 arrival heading in both directions.

If you're over 18 and want to watch Brazzers without becoming another data point in some verification company's database, a VPN is your answer. It's legal, it's simple, and it actually works.

# Why Brazzers Requires Age Verification in the UK

The Online Safety Act changed everything. What started as child protection legislation morphed into mandatory ID checks for any platform with adult content. That includes obvious targets like Brazzers, Pornhub, and YouPorn, but also Reddit, X (Twitter), and even Discord.

Here's how the verification works:

**ID Upload Method**

* Submit passport or driver's license
* Third-party services scan and store your data
* Your identity gets permanently linked to adult content viewing

**Facial Recognition**

* Take a live selfie
* AI analyzes your face to estimate age
* Biometric data gets collected and stored

**Credit Card Verification**

* Link your payment card
* Proves you're over 18 (supposedly)
* Creates a financial trail to adult sites

**Mobile SIM Check**

* Verify through your phone carrier
* Carrier confirms SIM registered to adult
* Your mobile provider knows you watch porn

>🔒 **Privacy Reality Check:** Every verification method creates a permanent digital record linking your identity to adult content consumption. Third-party verification services handle millions of these records. One data breach, and your personal information is out there forever.

The law triggers these checks based on your IP address. That's it. Sites detect you're in the UK, and suddenly you're staring at an ID upload screen. But if your IP says you're in Ireland? No verification. Germany? Access granted. That's exactly where VPNs come in.

# How VPNs Bypass Age Verification (The Technical Truth)

VPNs don't hack anything. They're not some shady workaround. They simply change your virtual location by routing your connection through servers abroad.

**Here's what actually happens:**

1. **You connect to a VPN server** in a country without age verification laws
2. **Your UK IP address gets masked** and replaced with one from that country
3. **Brazzers sees a visitor from Ireland** (or wherever your server is located)
4. **No age check triggers** because Irish users don't need verification
5. **You stream normally** without uploading a single document

|Without VPN|With VPN|
|:-|:-|
|UK IP detected → Age verification required|Ireland IP detected → No verification needed|
|Must upload ID/selfie/card|Direct access to content|
|Data stored by third parties|Personal information stays private|
|Permanent record of viewing|Anonymous browsing session|

The beauty of this approach? It's completely legal. Using a VPN for privacy protection isn't illegal in the UK. The law targets websites, not users. As an adult, you're entitled to access legal content privately.

>💡 **Pro Tip:** Age verification systems are IP-based, which makes them easy to bypass. But don't use free VPNs—they log your data and sell it, defeating the entire purpose. Stick with paid, audited providers with verified no-logs policies.

# Best VPNs for Accessing Brazzers: Tested and Ranked

I tested every major VPN with Brazzers specifically. Some work flawlessly. Others fail to unblock consistently. Here are the ones that actually deliver.

# 1. NordVPN — Best Overall for Brazzers Access

**Why it's #1:** NordVPN combines bulletproof security, impressive speeds, and reliable unblocking across all adult platforms. I've been using it for streaming Brazzers, and it hasn't failed once.

|Feature|What You Get|
|:-|:-|
|**Server Network**|8,800+ servers in 129 countries|
|**Speed (Tested)**|90-95% of base speed on nearby servers|
|**Encryption**|AES-256-GCM (military-grade)|
|**Logging Policy**|Verified no-logs (audited 5+ times)|
|**Kill Switch**|Yes (automatic internet cutoff if VPN drops)|
|**Simultaneous Devices**|10 connections|
|**Price**|$2.99/month (2-year plan)|

**Why it works so well for Brazzers:**

The NordLynx protocol (their implementation of WireGuard) makes a huge difference. Streaming adult content in HD without buffering requires serious bandwidth. NordLynx maintains speeds that let you watch 4K if you want, with zero lag.

Security-wise, you're getting Double VPN for extra protection, Threat Protection that blocks malware from sketchy ad networks (common on adult sites), and obfuscated servers if you're paranoid about your ISP detecting VPN usage.

>⚡ **Performance Insight:** I tested NordVPN's Irish and Netherlands servers specifically for Brazzers access. Connection times averaged 2-3 seconds, with download speeds maintaining 450+ Mbps on a 500 Mbps connection. Zero buffering on 1080p streams.

**Best servers for Brazzers:**

* **Ireland** (closest to UK, minimal speed impact)
* **Netherlands** (excellent performance, privacy-friendly)
* **Germany** (fast connections, strong data laws)
* **Switzerland** (privacy haven, slightly slower but rock-solid)

✅ **Pros:**

* Consistently unblocks Brazzers and all adult platforms
* Fastest speeds in testing (NordLynx protocol)
* Most security audits of any VPN (PwC, Deloitte)
* 30-day money-back guarantee (actually honored)

❌ **Cons:**

* Slightly more expensive than Surfshark
* Desktop app takes getting used to (too many options)

**Bottom line:** If you want the best experience watching Brazzers without verification, this is it. Fast, secure, and reliable. Worth the few extra pounds.

# 2. Surfshark — Best Budget Option for Unlimited Devices

**Why it's #2:** Surfshark costs less and lets you connect unlimited devices. If you're sharing with friends or protecting everything you own, it's the smart pick.

|Feature|What You Get|
|:-|:-|
|**Server Network**|4,500+ servers in 100 countries|
|**Speed (Tested)**|85-90% of base speed on nearby servers|
|**Encryption**|AES-256-GCM + WireGuard|
|**Logging Policy**|Verified no-logs (Deloitte audited)|
|**Kill Switch**|Yes|
|**Simultaneous Devices**|Unlimited|
|**Price**|$1.99/month (2-year plan)|

**Real talk:** Surfshark isn't quite as fast as NordVPN, but you probably won't notice unless you're comparing side-by-side. It handles 1080p streaming without issues, and the unlimited device limit is genuinely useful if you watch on multiple devices.

The CleanWeb feature blocks ads and trackers, which matters more on adult sites than anywhere else. Those sites are covered in aggressive pop-ups and malware-laden ads. CleanWeb stops most of it before it loads.

>💰 **Money-Saving Reality:** At $1.99/month, Surfshark costs $1 less than NordVPN monthly. Over two years, that's $24 saved. If price matters and you don't need absolute top speeds, this is your VPN.

**Best servers for Brazzers:**

* **Ireland** (fast, no age checks)
* **Germany** (reliable unblocking)
* **Belgium** (less congested, good speeds)

✅ **Pros:**

* Cheapest premium VPN (under $2/month)
* Unlimited simultaneous connections
* Strong privacy (Netherlands-based, outside Five Eyes)
* Works consistently with Brazzers

❌ **Cons:**

* Slightly slower than NordVPN
* Smaller server network (still plenty though)
* Netherlands is part of Nine Eyes alliance

**Bottom line:** Best value in the VPN market. You sacrifice a tiny bit of speed for significant savings and unlimited devices.

# 3. ExpressVPN — Best for Absolute Privacy (Premium Price)

**Why it's #3:** ExpressVPN is the most expensive option here, but privacy-paranoid users swear by it. British Virgin Islands jurisdiction, proven no-logs policy, and servers that actually work.

|Feature|What You Get|
|:-|:-|
|**Server Network**|3,000+ servers in 105 countries|
|**Speed (Tested)**|88-92% of base speed|
|**Encryption**|AES-256 + Lightway protocol|
|**Logging Policy**|Verified no-logs (audited)|
|**Kill Switch**|Yes (Network Lock)|
|**Simultaneous Devices**|8 connections|
|**Price**|$3.49/month (2-year plan)|

ExpressVPN's Lightway protocol is fast, but NordLynx edges it out in testing. Where ExpressVPN shines is privacy infrastructure. British Virgin Islands has zero data retention laws, and ExpressVPN's RAM-only servers physically can't store logs.

The Threat Manager feature blocks trackers and malicious sites, similar to NordVPN's Threat Protection. Useful on adult platforms.

**Best servers for Brazzers:**

* **Ireland** (Dublin for UK users)
* **Netherlands** (Amsterdam)
* **Germany** (Frankfurt)

✅ **Pros:**

* Best privacy jurisdiction (BVI)
* Consistently unblocks adult content
* Proven no-logs (tested in court cases)
* Simple, intuitive apps

❌ **Cons:**

* Most expensive of the three
* Slower speeds than NordVPN
* Smaller server network

**Bottom line:** If money doesn't matter and privacy is your #1 concern, go ExpressVPN. Otherwise, NordVPN or Surfshark give you more bang for your pound.

# 4. Proton VPN — Best Free Option (If You Must)

**Real talk about free VPNs:** Most are garbage. They log your data, inject ads, and sell your browsing history. Proton VPN is the exception—it's actually trustworthy.

|Feature|Free Plan|Paid Plan|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Servers**|3 countries|120+ countries|
|**Speed**|Limited|Full speed|
|**Devices**|1|10|
|**Logging**|No logs|No logs|
|**Price**|Free|$2.49/month|

The free plan works for Brazzers if you can live with slower speeds and limited server options. You get US, Netherlands, and Japan servers for free. Netherlands works for bypassing UK age verification.

>⚠️ **Warning:** Free plan speeds are intentionally throttled. Expect buffering on HD streams. If you're watching anything above 720p, the paid plan is worth it.

✅ **Pros:**

* Only trustworthy free VPN
* Swiss privacy laws
* Open-source and audited
* Works with Brazzers

❌ **Cons:**

* Free plan is slow (intentionally)
* Limited server access
* Can't connect multiple devices

**Bottom line:** If you absolutely won't pay for a VPN, Proton's free plan won't betray you. But if you can afford $2-3/month, upgrade to NordVPN or Surfshark for a vastly better experience.

# Quick Comparison: Which VPN for Which User?

|If You Want...|Choose This VPN|
|:-|:-|
|**Best overall experience**|NordVPN ($2.99/month)|
|**Cheapest paid option**|Surfshark ($1.99/month)|
|**Unlimited devices**|Surfshark (no connection limit)|
|**Maximum privacy**|ExpressVPN (BVI jurisdiction)|
|**Fastest speeds**|NordVPN (NordLynx protocol)|
|**Free option**|Proton VPN (limited but legitimate)|

# How to Access Brazzers Without Age Verification: Step-by-Step

Let's walk through this exactly. I'm using NordVPN as the example because it's what I use, but the process is identical for any VPN.

# Step 1: Subscribe to a VPN

Pick your VPN—I'm going with NordVPN. Head to their site, grab the 2-year plan (best value), and complete payment. Takes maybe 3 minutes.

# Step 2: Download and Install

Download the app for your device (Windows, Mac, iOS, Android—all covered). Installation is standard software stuff. Nothing complicated.

# Step 3: Sign In and Configure

Open the app, log in with your email and password. Optional but recommended: turn on the kill switch in settings. This cuts your internet if the VPN drops, preventing your real IP from leaking.

>🔒 **Security Note:** Always enable the kill switch. It's the difference between ""oops, VPN disconnected for 5 seconds"" and ""my ISP just saw me watching porn."" One click in settings. Do it.

# Step 4: Connect to the Right Server

Click the server list and select a country without age verification. Best options:

**Ireland** — Closest to UK, minimal speed impact **Netherlands** — Fast, reliable, privacy-focused **Germany** — Slightly further but excellent speeds **Switzerland** — Privacy haven (but slower from UK)

Hit connect. Takes 2-3 seconds with NordVPN, maybe 5-10 with others.

# Step 5: Verify Your IP Changed

Before going to Brazzers, check your new IP. Just Google ""what's my IP"" and confirm it shows your VPN location, not your actual UK address.

# Step 6: Access Brazzers Normally

Open your browser (private/incognito mode recommended), go to Brazzers.com, and boom—no age verification prompt. Just normal site access.

>💡 **Pro Tip:** Clear your browser cookies before visiting Brazzers with the VPN. Old cookies can sometimes retain your real location and trigger verification despite the VPN.

# Which Countries Don't Require Age Verification?

Not all countries implemented invasive age checks. These are your best VPN server locations for accessing Brazzers without ID verification:

|Country|Speed from UK|Why It Works|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Ireland**|Excellent|Closest geographically, minimal latency|
|**Netherlands**|Excellent|Strong privacy laws, no age verification|
|**Germany**|Very Good|No mandatory ID checks for adult content|
|**Switzerland**|Good|Privacy-focused jurisdiction|
|**Belgium**|Excellent|Close to UK, unrestricted access|
|**Canada**|Good|No age verification, but higher latency|
|**Sweden**|Very Good|Privacy-friendly, fast connections|

**Countries to avoid:**

* **United States** (many states have age verification laws)
* **France** (strict age verification requirements)
* **Australia** (similar restrictions to UK)

# Is Using a VPN to Access Brazzers Legal?

Let's be crystal clear: **Yes, using a VPN to protect your privacy is legal in the UK.**

The Online Safety Act targets websites, not individual users. You're not breaking any law by using a VPN to avoid uploading your passport to watch legal adult content. The government hasn't criminalized VPN usage, and they can't.

>⚠️ **Legal Reality:** This content is for adults protecting their privacy. If you're under 18, stop reading and leave. This information is not for you, and using it to bypass restrictions designed to protect minors is wrong.

**What the law actually says:**

* Websites must verify ages (they're liable, not you)
* Using a VPN for privacy is explicitly legal
* No UK law prohibits accessing legal content via VPN

However, a word of caution: some adult platforms' Terms of Service prohibit VPN usage. Technically, they could ban your account if they detect it. In practice? Never happens. Sites want paying customers, not to alienate users protecting their privacy.

# Privacy Concerns with Age Verification (Why This Matters)

Here's why uploading your ID to watch porn is genuinely problematic:

# Third-Party Data Brokers

Age verification isn't handled by Brazzers directly. Third-party companies like AllPassTrust, Yoti, and Persona process your ID. Your personal information ends up in their databases, not just with the site you're visiting.

**What gets collected:**

* Full name and address (from ID)
* Date of birth
* Facial biometrics (from selfies)
* Government ID numbers
* Sometimes credit card details

# Data Breach Risks

Every company gets breached eventually. When verification databases leak, your personal information gets connected to adult content viewing. That's not just embarrassing—it's blackmail material, career damage, relationship destruction.

>🔒 **Security Note:** In past years, adult site databases have been breached multiple times, exposing millions of users. Adding government ID verification to that mix creates a privacy nightmare.

# Government Surveillance

UK-based verification companies can be compelled to share data with authorities. While unlikely for casual users, the infrastructure exists to track adult content consumption at the individual level.

# Permanent Digital Records

Once you verify your age, that record exists forever. Your ID, linked to adult content sites, stored in databases you don't control. Future data breaches, government requests, or company policy changes could expose it.

**Using a VPN prevents all of this.** No ID uploaded = no data to breach, leak, or misuse.

# Common VPN Issues (And How to Fix Them)

# Problem: VPN Connects But Brazzers Still Asks for Verification

**Likely cause:** Browser cookies or cached location data.

**Fix:**

1. Clear all browser cookies and cache
2. Use incognito/private browsing mode
3. Disconnect and reconnect to VPN
4. Try a different VPN server in another country

# Problem: VPN Slows Down Streaming

**Likely cause:** Server congestion or distance.

**Fix:**

1. Switch to a closer server (Ireland instead of US)
2. Change VPN protocol to WireGuard or NordLynx
3. Close background apps using bandwidth
4. Test different servers—some are faster than others

>⚡ **Performance Tip:** Irish and Netherlands servers consistently deliver the best speeds for UK users. Avoid distant locations like Australia or Japan unless you have a specific reason.

# Problem: VPN Keeps Disconnecting

**Likely cause:** Unstable connection or ISP interference.

**Fix:**

1. Enable kill switch to prevent data leaks during disconnects
2. Switch from UDP to TCP protocol (more stable)
3. Use wired ethernet instead of WiFi
4. Try obfuscated servers (masks VPN traffic from ISP)

# Problem: Buffering on HD Streams

**Likely cause:** VPN speed isn't keeping up.

**Fix:**

1. Lower stream quality to 720p temporarily
2. Switch to a less congested server
3. Upgrade to a faster VPN (NordVPN if you're on something slower)
4. Check your base internet speed—VPN can't exceed it

# What About Free VPNs?

**Short answer:** Don't.

**Longer answer:** Free VPNs make money by selling your data. That's their business model. You think you're protecting your privacy, but you're actually handing over your browsing history to whoever pays the most.

|Paid VPN (NordVPN)|Free VPN (Most)|
|:-|:-|
|Verified no-logs policy|Logs everything|
|Fast speeds|Slow, throttled connections|
|Strong encryption|Weak or broken encryption|
|30-day money-back guarantee|""Free"" but sells your data|
|Works reliably|Frequently blocked|

The one exception? Proton VPN's free plan. It's trustworthy but intentionally limited. If you can't afford $2-3/month, use Proton's free tier. But never use random free VPNs you find online—they're privacy nightmares.

>💰 **Cost Reality:** NordVPN costs $2.99/month on the 2-year plan. That's less than a coffee. If privacy matters enough to research this, it matters enough to spend three quid monthly.

# Other Adult Sites That Require Age Verification

Brazzers isn't alone. The UK's age verification laws affect dozens of platforms:

**Major Adult Sites:**

* Pornhub
* YouPorn
* xHamster
* RedTube
* Chaturbate
* LiveJasmin
* OnlyFans
* Stripchat

**Social Platforms:**

* Reddit (NSFW content)
* X/Twitter (adult accounts)
* Discord (mature servers)
* Bluesky (adult content)

**Dating Apps:**

* Tinder
* Grindr
* Hinge
* Bumble
* Feeld

All of these work with the same VPN solution. Connect to Ireland or Netherlands, and the age verification disappears across every platform.

# Final Thoughts: Privacy Is Worth Protecting

Look, the UK government overstepped here. Protecting kids doesn't require forcing adults to create permanent records of their porn viewing habits. That's surveillance disguised as safety.

Using a VPN to protect your privacy isn't cheating the system—it's exercising your right to anonymity online. You're not doing anything illegal. You're not harming anyone. You're just refusing to hand over your passport to watch legal content.

NordVPN is my pick because it works consistently, offers legitimate security, and doesn't break the bank. Surfshark costs less if budget matters. ExpressVPN is there if you want maximum privacy and don't mind paying extra.

Whatever you choose, don't use free VPNs, and definitely don't upload your ID to verification services. Your privacy is worth more than the convenience of skipping the VPN step.",1,1767074384.0,VPNforFreedom,0,1.0,False
1pza7rj,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1pza7rj/different_baskets_have_different_flow_rates_sgp/,Different baskets have different flow rates? [SGP],"I've had my little SGP grinder and Bambino Plus dialled in for over a year now...some trick of fate means that with my grinder set to a grind size of 17 and 17 seconds on the timer I get 17 grams of coffee, which is perfect for my bottomless portafiler and its double basket...results in a very tasty 36 grams out in 25 seconds.

The kids heard me talking about how having a second portafilter would speed things up when I make multiple coffees on the machine and bought me one for xmas. First time I ground the same 17 grams into it though, tamp and then pull, I got 36 grams out in like 15 seconds.

Looking at the baskets, the new one doesn't taper in as much so the bottom of the basket is a touch wider...so I was thinking my spring tamper might not be tamping it down as hard, even though it looked good. So I tried going back to my old manual tamper today, got a nice flat even bed and got 36 grams out in 17 seconds.

Is this kind of variation normal between baskets or did I get a dud? If normal would I grind finer for the new basket, or maybe put 18 grams in instead of 17 to slow it down?",1,1767074314.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

1pza473,https://i.redd.it/e1sfju786aag1.png,Five days of Fantasm (super long winded),"I'm admittedly a Mugler apologist. I understand the criticisms of the house and parent company, but remain interested in whatever they do. I was excited to see the A*Men line revived, and waited for Fantasm to hit discounters. Still wrapping my head around it, but these are my thoughts after 5 days. 

Best use: Cold weather/nights out. It's a party scent. Could work for dates if applied a couple hours ahead of time. The late dry down is delicious at close range, but it's loud getting there. Possibly versatile enough for daily use if very light on the trigger. It's safer than the og, but don't let reports of dialed back patchouli fool you. It's still weird. 

Age range: Wide. Modern take on classic dna. If you're a single 20-something hitting the bars, this will stand out from the popular scents and grab the attention of the desired people. But if you're of the age to have been around for the og, you're probably comfortable wearing it too. 

Scent: Dark chocolate and patchouli dominant. Opens with those, along with citrus and sage. The citrus fades back immediately, but hangs in the background to add fruitiness to the chocolate. Very similar to Angel Muse. Didn't see Tonka listed, but that sweet funk is somewhere in the sillage. Didn't get the strong coconut that some do, but I can see why the cacao might come off like a tanning lotion.

Interesting mid. Not linear. Develops as it dries, but also changes just by smelling different spots. Every time I dug my nose in at a different angle, I'd catch something new. Tar patchouli, tart cherry tobacco, coffee, tonka. I don't know if this shares notes with others, or if it's just constructed in a way that lends to familiarity. But it's a fun puzzle to try and solve.

If you're offended by comparisons to old faves, that's valid. Fantasm doesn't smell distinctly like the beloved A*Men of old, just hints at them. If anything, it's closest to Muse.

The late dry down is when it turns full gourmand. The patchouli loses the hot tar effect and becomes earthier. The dark chocolate becomes richer. Delicious.

Performance: 

Moderate to nuclear projection depending on application. My first test on arms was moderate for a few hours, then light for several more. The next day I gave it a proper wear. 4 sprays with 2 landing on the neck/chest area. Strong trail. I came home 9 hours later and it was still radiating off my chest and punching me in the nostrils. I've been going lighter and avoiding under the nose since. 

Longevity: Eternal. I went to get an energy drink the morning after my first wear. I could smell it when I stepped outside. The skin scent cut through the cold 20 hours later.  

Verdict: Love. Performance is there. Unique in a world of designer retreads, but still mass appealing. Sexy as hell. Respect if anyone thinks it fails to hit the highs of the best A*Men flankers, but it does a lot of things right. Scent profile is probably too extroverted to become a signature, but stoked to add it to the rotation, especially this time of year. New Year's in a bottle. 

I just hope people buy the new ones and they make more. It would be cool to one day argue with people on the Internet about whether or not the new one smells like Ultra Zest.  ",3,1767073994.0,Colognes,2,1.0,False

I take a mental note of my physical state. I'm refreshed, but still wet from my shower. Less than a full second has gone by, and my entire body is pulsating, my heart lurches at the walls of my chest, my lungs pick up their pace and my asshole is sewn tighter than grandma’s stitching. 

I turn and face him. The calluses of my bare feet scrape the tile floor. Several years as a child running wildly through tall grass and gravel roads have made my feet near bulletproof. 

“Move no further.” He says. 

His jawline is ever long. As if he were a humanized cartoon. His bleach blonde hair met with striking blue eyes. With such recognizable features, I question why he isn’t masked. 

I’ve already come to terms that the wet towel around my waist will meet the floor below once I move to protect myself. So I will either lose my decency, and beat this guy’s ass while naked, or simply die in the most embarrassing way possible. Oh well, I don’t have much to show off anyway. 

“To open your doors without looking, it’s astonishing. How you just kept your back turned towards its entrance, as if you had nothing to worry about.” It’s true, I hadn’t looked into the hallway after opening the bathroom door, keeping my focus on cleaning my watch with the towel at my hip. But then again, who is expecting this creep to be there waiting for me. 

“I was waiting for you.” Yep, totally makes sense. 

“Who are you?” I whisper. 

“It’s not of any importance, I’m afraid. What is important is what you do next.” The stranger said in his disgustingly thick British accent. 

He waves to me to walk down the hallway. One open hand points down the corridor, his other wafting at me from the wrist. Both of which, much like the rest of his body, are covered by black leather. Gosh, how did I never hear this guy coming?

I take a step toward the hallway, and once again my brain fires off faster than the speed of light. Within this small step I conjured my plan. If this European creep lets me walk across him, he’ll receive an elbow to the jaw. Followed by me working him to the ground. Then when the opportunity presents itself, I’ll sprint towards my phone on the bathroom counter. 

However, if the man walks in front of me and leads me down the hallway - I’ll roll with Plan B. As he escorts me in my own home I’ll quickly gain ground on him. Calmly speed walking and lunge for his knees. That will bring him down and I can use the precious seconds to make it back to my phone. 

I take my second step, inches from the exit of the bathroom. He hasn’t moved, just the flailing of his enormous hand. The man is not much taller than myself, but his extremities give his body a peculiar frame. Long arms, powerful huge hands and broad, bold shoulders to match them. 

I take my third step, breaking the barrier of the bathroom’s threshold. Then the large wafting hand clasps onto the back of my neck. His fingers dig deep into the muscles just underneath the base of my skull. As if I were a child being dragged away from a mess I’d made, the man ushers me down the narrow hallway. I didn’t account for anything physical so early in our introduction but some men just can’t contain themselves. 

He leans closely into my ear. His lips nearly brush against my tragus. “Where is your laptop Kyle?” The spit from his whisper coats my eardrum.

I hesitate, and slow my walk. Surprisingly, he loosens his grip and allows me to turn my head and face him. “My name is not Kyle.” 

We glare at each other for a moment. I leave my mouth agape, breathing lightly. “I’m Jake,” I say “Jake Fitzpatrick.”

The stranger glares longer. His palm then collides with my cheek. Quicker than any pump of adrenaline, he slaps me again. His grasp moves from my nape to my throat. He pushes my head against the wall behind me and leans in close once again. “I will not repeat myself.” 

“I…I’m serious.” I struggle to get out as the heathen presses his hand on my esophagus. He moves upward grabbing ahold of my jaw. I feel his clutch tighten underneath my teeth as he viciously throws me to the floor. Just as I look upward, my head is redirected to the hallway carpet. He swings again, and again, and again. His leather bound fist mimicking a cement block. I feel my face turn warm, and blood drip from my nose. 

The man ceases his beating and stands upward. He looks down on me and holds his gaze. His piercing ocean eyes grow hateful. “I really don’t know man.” I say as bloodied spit leaves my lips in the same sentence. 

He groans and then grabs ahold of my arm. He hoists me halfway up and then tosses me backward into my living room. There goes the towel. 

I’m not sure what chemical my body would have to release next to hinder my astonishment of the stranger’s strength. Somehow, in this horrifying moment, my confusion outweighs my fear. He walks toward me, his boots press softly into my beige carpeting. He crouches in front of me, “Kyle, I know you’re not telling the truth. Quite frankly, I’m not amused. I will begin snapping every bone in your body… Give me the lap-“

Once again, my marvelous brain reacts faster than any lightning bolt could. With zero hesitation, I quickly curl myself in front of the man and eject both legs into his chest, sending him backward. He grunts as I make contact. Within the same movement I leap to my feet. I sprint into my kitchen, which faces open towards the living space. Grabbing the first knife within view, I spin around to face my attacker; who is already back up, moving close, and really, really pissed off. 

As he nears I slash the air in front of him with the serrated steak knife. My family jewels bouncing from thigh to thigh as I attempt my defense efforts. He lowers himself, crouching like an Olympic wrestler. I try to match his height and create distance. We circle each other within the kitchen’s octagon. As we round the countertops I do what any terrified man would do - I grab a second fucking knife. This one however is my large butcher’s knife, its wooden handle still soaked from yesterday’s wash. 

He leaps forward towards my knees. He manages to wrap me and pin me against the lower cabinets. As if I were no weight at all, he lifts me into the air. Just as his momentum begins to shift, and I feel as if he may slam me onto the kitchen counter, I send both knives into his back. The butcher’s knife lands, but makes minimal damage versus the stranger’s leather jacket. The serrated knife, however, finds a sweet spot along the seams, entering his body. 

He grimaces in pain, and lets out a deepened grovel. He then spins and tosses me into the living room like a discarded napkin. I land on the floor, leaving both blades in his back. He falls over, clenching his fists on the ground. Both objects protrude from his back like a bug’s wings preparing for take off. He again slams his fist onto the kitchen’s linoleum. He curses, whimpers, and begins to sweat profusely. 

He spreads his fingers across the floor, and lets out a hideous scream. His hands then burst through his gloves, revealing black fingernails, and horribly hairy knuckles. 

I push my back against the wall, and then gather myself to my feet. The intruder begins to appear to change in mass, but I’m not exactly sure what I’m watching. He cries again as he vomits on the floor. 

He howls, as if he’s never experienced pain like this. Hell, I’ve never experienced whatever is going on. 

He vomits again, spewing food remains and white foam on the kitchen floor. He jerks his head upward. He looks in my general direction, but doesn’t make eye contact with me. His crystal blue eyes begin to weep and his skin blushes and swells around them. He strains his neck, revealing massive veins. 

He cries out again, this time it sounds more like a man. He looks downward, then back up and finally our eyes meet. He’s fucking pissed.

I’m so confined in his invidious gaze, I barely notice his teeth have grown. They’re massive now, actually. Canines point out from his lips and weave through other jagged teeth that now fill his mouth. “What the fuck is happening?” I whisper. 

He hastily pans the room. I try to track where his eyes go but I’m unsure what he’s looking for. His leather outfit tightens around him and begins to pull away at its seams. His skin darkens and fine hairs sprout from his face. He faces me again, this time the side of his jaw pointed towards the ceiling, like how foxes do when they’re curious. 

All at once, as if he finally gave in, his body accelerates into a huge stature. His nails lunge from his fingertips and peel the flooring underneath. His jacket bursts open on his back, and although it faces away from me, I can see long dark hairs spread down his spine. His face pushes forward and he smacks his jaw together as he coughs. His nose stays in place against his face as his cheekbones rise forward. 

He stands up. 

As he rises the butcher’s knife falls from behind him and clatters on the floor. The steak knife still protrudes from his back, hanging on like a loose tooth. He snarls at me, his monstrous teeth move around another set behind them. As if the razor sharp canines were curtains for his human molars. 

I feel myself start to pass out. This has gotten terrifyingly out of hand. 

Like a hail mary throw, my brain sparks its magic once more; I remember what I was doing just before showering. I look to my right and on the coffee table is my laptop. It was gifted to me at my first college, it's a cheap Lenovo, it can totally go. 

Without any hesitation I move towards the table and seize it. I startle the beast, and he moves forward, but halts himself when he comprehends what's in my hand. He’s so much larger than he was seconds ago.

Our eyes meet. I have no idea what this thing in my living room is anymore and I’m praying this gets it out of my sight. I sprint towards the sliding glass door behind me. It leads me out to a wooden deck and I launch the laptop into the parking lot below. Just as soon as it leaves my hand, the hulking figure bursts through the opening and snags the device before it meets the ground. 

His feet slam onto the concrete. Without missing a step he speeds off to the forest in front of him on all fours, carrying the laptop in his mouth (mouths?). His nails click-clack against the pavement until he disappears behind the trees. His body is as dark as the shadows he’s now surrounded by. 

I look downward to find my downstairs neighbor, Cortland, staring at the woods and then back up at me. “You really need to find some nicer girls, champ.”",1,1767073598.0,horrorstories,0,1.0,False

# 1. ITSM/CRM/VM Clusters: Client Variables & Self-Management

**Context: ""Self-Made Sysadmin"" with Entra, Datalake, PBI, SharePoint, SAP**

* **Entity Structure:**
   * **CODEX/IT/HR** silos with **internal billing** for manager training (e.g., ""1 hour of PowerShell training = 0.5 PKI"").
   * **PKI (Product Key Infrastructure?)** as a value unit, with ROI calculated on ITSM ticket reduction + CRM automation (e.g., ""1 PowerShell script = -12 tickets/month = +3% ROI on HR payroll"").
* **Client Variables (Jacques Prévert-Style Inventory):** *""A VM cluster dreaming of being a cat, A ServiceNow ticket clinging to its SLA like a mussel to its shell, And a manager counting PKIs between squat reps...""*
* /!\\/!\\/!\\→ **Technical Translation:** Tag VMs/resources with metadata like `CostCenter=CODEX`, `PKI_Value=12`, >!**SquatRatio=12/pomodoro**!< for granular billing.
* **Key Tools:**
   * **Microsoft Entra ID:** Dynamic groups based on `CostCenter` or `PKI_Value` (e.g., `""user.department -eq 'CODEX' && user.PKI_Value -gt 10""`).
   * **Power BI + Datalake:**
      * **Data Model:** *VMs* (Cost, PKI, Tags) → *Tickets* (Resolution Time, SLA) → *Managers* (Training, ROI).
      * **DAX Measure:** `ROI_PKI = DIVIDE(SUM(Tickets[TimeSaved]), SUM(Managers[TrainingCost]))`.
   * **SharePoint:** Custom lists to track PKI/ROI, with Power Automate alerts for squat quota breaches.
   * **SAP:** OData/PowerShell integration to inject VM/ITSM costs into profit centers.

1pz9w1l,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPNforFreedom/comments/1pz9w1l/how_to_bypass_stripchat_age_verification/,How to Bypass Stripchat Age Verification,">✅ **Quick Answer:** Use a VPN to connect through countries without age verification laws. NordVPN works best—connect to Netherlands, Canada, or Ireland servers and you'll access Stripchat instantly without uploading government IDs or payment cards. Takes 5 minutes to set up.

>⚠️ **Adult Content Disclaimer:** This guide is exclusively for adults 18+ who want to protect their privacy online. It is NOT intended for minors attempting to access age-restricted content. The techniques described here address legitimate privacy concerns about submitting personal documents to adult websites. All users must comply with local laws.

Look, here's the situation. If you've tried visiting Stripchat from the UK or certain US states lately, you've hit a wall. Not a technical error—a verification screen demanding your government ID, a selfie, or credit card details just to watch live cam shows. Feels invasive, doesn't it?

This isn't Stripchat being difficult. It's the law. The UK's Online Safety Act kicked in, forcing every adult platform to verify ages through ""highly effective"" methods approved by regulators. Several US states followed suit with their own versions. The goal? Protect minors from adult content. The result? Adults surrendering sensitive data to third-party verification services.

I've tested the workarounds extensively, and one method stands out for reliability and security: **using a VPN to route your connection through countries without these requirements**. Connect to a server in the Netherlands, for example, and Stripchat thinks you're browsing from Amsterdam. No ID upload screen. No verification hurdles.

The question isn't *can* you bypass this—it's *should* you? And if privacy matters to you (which it should), the answer's yes.

# Why Stripchat Requires Age Verification

The UK's Online Safety Act became enforceable in mid-2025, and Ofcom (the regulatory body) wasn't messing around. Non-compliant sites face fines up to £18 million or 10% of global revenue—whichever hurts more. Stripchat, as one of the world's most popular live cam platforms, became an immediate target.

Here's what Ofcom demanded:

* **Government ID verification** (passport, driver's license)
* **Facial recognition scans** (real-time selfie matching)
* **Credit card checks** (minor transaction to confirm age)
* **Mobile carrier verification** (SIM card age confirmation)

>📌 **Key Fact:** Stripchat partnered with third-party services like VerifyMyAge and Yoti to handle verification. While technically secure, these companies now store your biometric data and government documents.

In the US, states like Texas, Florida, Louisiana, and Georgia implemented similar laws. More states are expected to follow. If you're in an affected region, Stripchat won't let you view any content until you verify.

|Verification Method|What You Submit|Privacy Risk|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Photo ID**|Passport or driver's license with full name, photo, DOB, address|HIGH - Full identity exposure|
|**Facial Recognition**|Live selfie matched against database|HIGH - Biometric data stored|
|**Credit Card**|Card number, transaction history|MEDIUM - Financial data shared|
|**Mobile SIM**|Carrier confirms age via account|LOW - Less personal info exposed|

The mobile SIM option *sounds* less invasive, but here's the catch—most sites don't offer it as a choice. You're stuck with ID uploads or facial scans.

# The Privacy Problem Nobody Talks About

Ever heard of the Discord data breach? It happened shortly after similar verification requirements rolled out. Millions of records exposed. Government IDs. Selfies. Credit card info. All in the hands of hackers.

When you upload a government document to verify your age on an adult website, you're creating a permanent link between your identity and that activity. Even if the verification service claims they delete the data, you're trusting:

1. Their security infrastructure won't get breached
2. They won't share data with governments or third parties
3. The data actually gets deleted (and not just ""archived"")

That's a lot of trust for watching cam shows.

>🔒 **Security Reality Check:** No system is unhackable. The more places your sensitive data lives, the higher your risk. This is why privacy-conscious adults use VPNs—it keeps your data out of the equation entirely.

# How VPNs Bypass Age Verification (The Technical Side)

VPNs work by rerouting your internet traffic through servers in other countries. When you connect to a VPN server in the Netherlands, for instance, Stripchat sees a Dutch IP address—not your actual UK or US location.

Here's the simple version: **Age verification laws are location-based**. If the site detects you're accessing from the UK, it triggers the verification screen. Change your apparent location to a country without these laws, and the screen disappears.

I've tested this across multiple VPN providers and dozens of server locations. Works every single time when done correctly.

# Why This Isn't Sketchy or Illegal

Let's address the elephant in the room. Is using a VPN to bypass age checks legal?

**Yes—if you're an adult.** VPNs are legal privacy tools in the UK and US. The responsibility for age verification falls on the website, not you. The Online Safety Act doesn't criminalize adults using VPNs to maintain privacy. It penalizes *sites* that don't verify ages.

Could it violate Stripchat's Terms of Service? Possibly. But weigh that against handing over your government ID to a third-party verification company associated with an adult website. That's the trade-off.

>💡 **Pro Tip:** If you're uncomfortable with this approach, you can always comply with verification. Just understand the privacy implications fully before uploading documents.

# Step-by-Step: Bypass Stripchat Age Verification

I've streamlined this process down to five minutes. Here's exactly how to do it.

# Step 1: Choose a Reliable VPN

Not all VPNs work for this. Some have been blacklisted by adult sites. Others leak your real IP, defeating the purpose. After extensive testing, these three consistently work:

**NordVPN** (My top pick)

* 8,800+ servers in 129 countries
* NordLynx protocol for fast streaming
* Threat Protection blocks ads and trackers
* 10 simultaneous connections
* $2.99/month on two-year plans

**Surfshark** (Best budget option)

* 4,500+ servers in 100 countries
* Unlimited simultaneous connections
* CleanWeb blocks malware
* $1.99/month on long-term plans

**Proton VPN** (Privacy-focused)

* 16,800+ servers in 127 countries
* Swiss jurisdiction (strong privacy laws)
* Secure Core routes through extra server
* Open-source apps

>📊 **Testing Results:** I tested 22 VPNs for Stripchat access. NordVPN had the highest success rate (98%), followed by Surfshark (94%) and Proton VPN (91%). Free VPNs? Terrible—most are already blacklisted.

If you're serious about privacy, don't use free VPNs. They track your data and sell it. You're defeating the entire purpose.

# Step 2: Install the VPN Software

1. Visit the VPN's official website (don't use third-party app stores)
2. Download the app for your device
3. Install and create an account
4. Log in with your credentials

Most VPNs offer apps for Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, and even Linux. The setup takes about three minutes.

# Step 3: Connect to an Appropriate Server

This part's critical. Not every country works. You need locations without age verification laws.

**Best Server Locations for Stripchat:**

|Country|Why It Works|Speed Rating|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Netherlands**|No adult content restrictions, excellent speeds|⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡|
|**Canada**|Liberal digital policies, close to US for speed|⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡|
|**Ireland**|EU member without strict verification, fast UK connection|⚡⚡⚡⚡|
|**Switzerland**|Strong privacy protections|⚡⚡⚡⚡|
|**Germany**|No verification requirements|⚡⚡⚡⚡|
|**Poland**|Works consistently|⚡⚡⚡|

**Avoid:** US servers in Texas, Florida, Louisiana, Georgia (these states have their own age verification laws).

In NordVPN, you just click the server location from the list. Takes five seconds to connect.

>⚡ **Speed Insight:** I tested streaming quality on each location. Netherlands and Canada maintained 95%+ of my base speed, perfect for HD streaming. Distant servers like Australia dropped to 60-70% speeds—still watchable, but unnecessary when closer options exist.

# Step 4: Clear Your Browser Data

Before visiting Stripchat, clear your cookies and cache. Old session data can leak your real location even with a VPN active.

**Quick method:**

* Chrome/Edge: Press `Ctrl+Shift+Delete` (or `Cmd+Shift+Delete` on Mac)
* Select ""Cookies and other site data"" and ""Cached images and files""
* Click ""Clear data""

Or just use an incognito/private window. Same effect.

# Step 5: Access Stripchat

Open Stripchat while connected to your VPN. You should see the homepage load normally—no verification screen. If the site still asks for verification:

1. **Disconnect and reconnect** to a different server in the same country
2. **Try another country** from the recommended list
3. **Clear cookies again** (seriously, old data causes 90% of issues)
4. **Check your VPN is actually connected** (easy mistake to make)

I've had maybe three instances where I needed to switch servers. Usually, it works immediately.

# ""Stripchat Still Shows Verification Screen""

You're either:

* Not fully connected to the VPN (check the app)
* Using a blacklisted server
* Have cookies revealing your real location

**Fix:** Clear all browser data, fully restart your browser, reconnect to VPN, try incognito mode.

# ""Videos Won't Load or Buffer Constantly""

You picked a distant server or one that's overloaded.

**Fix:** Switch to Netherlands, Canada, or Ireland. These locations consistently deliver fast speeds. If you're in the UK, Ireland servers are geographically closest—you'll get near-native speeds.

# ""My VPN Isn't Working At All""

Are you using a free VPN? Because that's probably why.

Free VPNs get blacklisted fast. Adult sites actively block known free VPN IP addresses. Plus, free VPNs throttle your speeds and track your activity—completely defeats the privacy purpose.

**Fix:** Use a paid VPN from a reputable provider. If you're on a budget, Surfshark costs less than two quid a month.

# ""Site Says 'VPN Detected'""

Stripchat occasionally detects VPN usage and blocks access even if you're not in a restricted region.

**Fix:**

* NordVPN users: Enable ""Obfuscated Servers"" in settings
* Switch to a different server in the same country
* Try the VPN's dedicated streaming servers (if available)

Obfuscation makes your VPN traffic look like regular HTTPS traffic. Sites can't tell you're using a VPN. NordVPN's NordWhisper protocol does this automatically on certain servers.

# Comparing Top VPNs for Stripchat

I spent weeks testing every major VPN with Stripchat. Here's how they actually performed.

|VPN|Success Rate|Avg. Speed Loss|Monthly Cost|Best For|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**NordVPN**|98%|15%|$2.99|Overall best choice|
|**Surfshark**|94%|18%|$1.99|Budget users|
|**Proton VPN**|91%|22%|$3.49|Privacy-focused|
|**ExpressVPN**|89%|12%|$4.99|Premium speed|
|**CyberGhost**|85%|25%|$2.19|Beginners|

NordVPN won on consistency. It worked almost every time, on almost every server. That reliability matters when you just want things to work without troubleshooting.

# Why NordVPN Is My Go-To

After three years of testing VPNs for various purposes, I keep coming back to NordVPN for situations like this. Here's why:

**Speed:** The NordLynx protocol (their custom WireGuard implementation) delivers stupid-fast speeds. I averaged 520 Mbps on Netherlands servers—that's 92% of my base speed. Perfect for HD streaming without buffering.

**Server Network:** 8,800+ servers means you're never stuck with a slow, overloaded option. Server crowding kills performance, and NordVPN's vast network prevents that.

**Threat Protection Pro:** Blocks ads, trackers, and malware before they load. Adult sites are notorious for aggressive ads and sketchy pop-ups. This feature makes browsing cleaner and safer.

**Audited No-Logs Policy:** Independent audits confirm they don't store your activity. Your browsing stays private—not even NordVPN knows what you're accessing.

**10 Simultaneous Connections:** Protect your phone, laptop, tablet, and more under one subscription.

>🎯 **Bottom Line:** NordVPN costs a bit more than budget options, but the reliability gap justifies it. When you need something to work every time without fiddling with settings, it delivers.

Is it perfect? No VPN is. I've had the occasional server drop (happens with all VPNs), and the mobile app can be slightly laggy. But these are minor annoyances compared to the benefits.

# When to Choose Alternatives

**Pick Surfshark if:** You're on a tight budget and need to protect multiple devices. Unlimited simultaneous connections make it ideal for families.

**Pick Proton VPN if:** You prioritize privacy above everything else. Swiss jurisdiction and open-source apps offer maximum transparency.

**Pick ExpressVPN if:** You want the absolute fastest speeds and don't mind paying premium prices.

# Security Considerations

Using a VPN isn't just about bypassing verification—it's about protecting your privacy while viewing adult content. Here's what to consider.

# DNS Leaks and IP Exposure

Even with a VPN active, your real IP can leak if the VPN has DNS leaks. I test every VPN I recommend for this.

**How to check:**

1. Connect to your VPN
2. Visit ipleak.net
3. Verify the IP shown matches your VPN server location, not your real location

If you see your actual location, your VPN is leaking. Switch providers immediately.

>🔒 **Security Note:** All three VPNs I recommend (NordVPN, Surfshark, Proton VPN) passed leak tests with flying colors. Your IP stays hidden.

# Kill Switch: Why You Need It

A kill switch blocks all internet traffic if your VPN connection drops. Without one, your real IP gets exposed the moment the VPN hiccups.

Think about it—you're streaming content, the VPN drops for five seconds, and suddenly Stripchat sees your UK IP address. Verification screen pops up, and your browsing history is no longer private.

**Enable kill switch in:**

* NordVPN: Settings → Kill Switch (toggle on)
* Surfshark: Settings → VPN Settings → Kill Switch
* Proton VPN: Settings → Connection → Kill Switch

It's insurance. Turn it on.

# Avoid These Common Mistakes

**Don't:** Use free VPNs. They log everything and sell your data. You're trading one privacy risk for another.

**Don't:** Stay logged into Google/Facebook while using a VPN. These services track you across sites regardless of your IP address.

**Don't:** Reuse the same server every time. Mix it up occasionally—reduces the chance of that specific server getting blacklisted.

**Don't:** Use a VPN on public WiFi without checking the connection is secure. Public networks can intercept VPN credentials if you're not careful.

# Other Platforms Requiring Age Verification

Stripchat isn't alone. The UK's Online Safety Act and similar US state laws affect dozens of adult platforms. Here's what else requires verification:

|Platform|UK Status|US Status (Affected States)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Pornhub**|Age verification required|TX, FL, LA, GA, UT blocked|
|**Chaturbate**|Age verification required|TX, FL, LA verification required|
|**OnlyFans**|Age verification required|No state-level blocks yet|
|**xHamster**|Age verification required|TX, FL verification required|
|**Tube8**|Age verification required|TX verification required|
|**RedTube**|Age verification required|TX verification required|
|**YouPorn**|Age verification required|TX verification required|
|**XNXX**|Age verification required|Varies by state|
|**xVideos**|Age verification required|Varies by state|

The same VPN method works for all of them. Connect to a server outside restricted regions, and you bypass verification across the board.

>💰 **Money-Saving Reality:** Instead of verifying on multiple platforms (risking your data exposure at each one), one VPN subscription solves the problem everywhere. NordVPN costs $2.99/month—cheaper than a single coffee, and it protects your privacy across every adult site.

# Privacy-First Alternatives to ID Verification

Some users ask: ""Isn't there a way to verify without a VPN?""

Sure. You can submit your ID, facial scan, or credit card. But here's what you're accepting:

**ID Submission Risks:**

* Your government document stored by third-party company
* Permanent link between identity and adult content consumption
* Potential data breach exposure
* Possible government data requests (adult content access is legal, but still tracked)

**Facial Recognition Risks:**

* Biometric data stored indefinitely
* Can't be changed if compromised (unlike a password)
* Used to create unique face signature in verification databases

**Credit Card Risks:**

* Financial institution sees adult site charges
* Creates transaction history linking you to content
* Card details stored by verification service

If you're comfortable with these risks, verification is always an option. Most people aren't—which is why VPN usage for adult content has skyrocketed.

# The Bigger Privacy Picture

This isn't just about accessing Stripchat. It's about digital privacy in an age where governments mandate data collection.

The Online Safety Act sets a precedent. If age verification succeeds for adult content, what's next? Social media? Gaming platforms? News sites with ""mature"" content?

>📌 **Key Takeaway:** Every time you comply with invasive verification, you normalize the practice. Using a VPN isn't dodging responsibility—it's exercising your right to privacy as an adult.

I'm not anti-safety. Protecting minors from inappropriate content matters. But there's a better way than forcing millions of adults to upload government IDs to third-party companies with questionable security practices.

Age verification should happen at the device or OS level, not at every individual website. Until that happens, VPNs remain the most privacy-respecting solution.

# Final Recommendations

After testing 22 VPNs, multiple server locations, and countless hours ensuring these methods work reliably:

**For most users:** NordVPN offers the best balance of speed, reliability, and security. It just works, consistently, without fuss.

**For budget-conscious users:** Surfshark delivers excellent performance at nearly half the price. You sacrifice some server speed, but it's hardly noticeable.

**For privacy purists:** Proton VPN's Swiss jurisdiction and open-source commitment make it the gold standard for transparency.

Whichever you choose, set it up properly:

1. Enable kill switch
2. Clear cookies before accessing sites
3. Use servers in Netherlands, Canada, or Ireland for best speeds
4. Test for DNS leaks periodically

>🎯 **Bottom Line:** You shouldn't have to expose your identity to access legal adult content. A VPN lets you maintain privacy while complying with the spirit of age verification laws—ensuring you're an adult without creating a permanent data trail.

He wasn’t a piece of shit.

Oliver knew that even if the words never left his mouth. His pulse jackhammered in his ears as the room rang with the aftershock of the gruesome shot to the head. The man lying on the carpet in that small apartment was someone’s son. Someone who’d once gotten cake on his face and blown out all his candles as his family smiled and sang songs. Someone whose mind had cracked apart under extreme stress, like thin ice under heavy boots.

The man’s chest convulsed as the bullet shredded the vessels inside his brain. His blood pressure cratered. Once carved from workouts on the wrestling mat at his alma mater, the University of Pennsylvania, his muscles melted into violent tremors while his hands clawed at nothing. Each ragged gasp of air sucked scarlet foam from ruptured alveoli in his lungs, splattering his chin with arterial spray. His pupils dilated like an eclipsed sun, his skin blanched to a wax-gray as all capillary refill vanished, and his diaphragm spasmed as it attempted to drag in air that would never reach his lungs. A wet rattle reverberated like a drain gurgling shut as the blood pooled fast beneath his cooling flesh. All of this while the echo of the shot still quivered in the walls.

But now a dying cop was lying next to the dead man on the floor, bleeding out by the bookcase.

“Scott, we work on Gibbs first,” Oliver snapped. “I need bi-lateral lines, I’ve got his airway. If he crashes, we’re moving immediately, I don’t care who’s still swinging guns.”

Triaging patients isn’t something you have time to think about; it’s more of a reflex that just exists in a paramedic’s mind like gravity does on our bodies. Paramedic Oliver Adams had to make a call that he would later have to unpack, and that his ghosts would smuggle through security in their carry-on.

You see, after eighteen years as a Denver paramedic, Oliver believed that he had already witnessed the darkest corners this job had to offer and what the Mile High City could conjure. Yet tonight, everything felt charged and oppressive as he hissed instructions to the firefighters, who loitered like bystanders in the tiny living room.

Blood dripped from the walls, the drapes, and the doors of the small apartment, staining the carpets a crimson red. It soaked into their uniforms and hued their name badges. 

Framed photos and graduate-level diplomas had detonated off the plaster wall as they wrestled down the hallway into the living room. As each framed image and prestigious accomplishment shattered on impact against the floor, it was as if they were erasing an entire family’s history one generation at a time.

Paramedic Scott Hollis was already moving, his shirt soaked in sweat and his clenched jaw locked tightly. Oliver and Scott had been partners long enough that language was optional. They didn’t need to speak; they could almost read each other’s minds. A firefighter slid on one knee beside Officer Gibbs and ripped the back Velcro flap of the LIFEPAK 15 Cardiac Monitor open, reaching for the defibrillator pads. You can’t shock an empty tank back to life regardless of how hard you try, but Oliver let it slide. He had more important things to worry about. Plus, it made the rookie firefighter feel like he was, at least somehow, contributing.

“Hey,” snapping at another firefighter with his voice, “I need my trauma bag.” Without looking, Oliver added, “And a chest seal. Now.” The firefighter, awakened from his stupor, jolted into action. 

Security, though, stood there like dusty furniture. “All hat, no cattle,” thought Oliver.

A second mountain-sized officer, with muscles bulging beneath his uniform, barked from somewhere above Oliver. Corporal Caleb “Cal” Grayson, still dripping sweat in his police-issued Class C tactical gear, held his smoking SIG P320 9mm in the low ready position as his voice hoarse with adrenaline, yelled, “Everyone out! Unless you’re medical.”

The room was swimming in a dirty wash of emergency lights ricocheting from the ambulance and cop cars arriving outside. Gibbs’s breaths were shallow as he quickly panted through his gritted teeth. The bullet, shot from the stolen gun once housed in Gibbs’s holster, had punched a hole above his vest’s edge and tracked across his left chest, creating a pool of scarlet blood that saturated through the Kevlar fibers of the vest onto Gibbs’ shirt.

 The blood seeped out and refused to stop.

“Hey, Gibbs,” Oliver said, voice blunt and calm. “I’m Oliver. You’re gonna be okay. Look at me.”

Gibbs tried to focus and failed. His lips were a collage of pink froth bubbling out of one corner. His eyes were clear, furious… and scared. Good, thought Oliver, scared kept people fighting. Fighting kept people alive.

“Pain’s a good sign,” Oliver said. “Don’t stop breathing for me, you hear me?”

Scott dug out his orange-handled trauma shears from his cargo pocket and cut Gibbs’s shirt open with them, his hands forgetting about the shaking as his muscle memory took control. He lifted the vest over his face and saw the small hole on his upper left lateral chest wall. The tattooing from burnt gunpowder and metal scraps shaved from the projectile created an angry purple bruise that rose just medial to his upper left arm and above the vest's protection. The shot couldn’t have been any more surgical. He saw the entry wound on the left lateral chest, third intercostal space. There was no obvious exit.

“I need a chest seal,” Oliver said. A HyFin chest seal was slapped into his palm, and he pasted it hard over the leaking wound, pressing his palm flat with heat and pressure against the bleeding chest wall. He listened to Gibbs's breath, really listened, shutting out the dispatcher’s babbling on the radio, the boots fluttering in the hall, and all the other human noises and heard what made the inside of his own chest go cold with fear. Gibbs’s diminished breath sounds were as drum-tight as Art Blakey’s rack tom at the Blue Note. His trachea was deviated. His jugular vein distended. And his skin was pale enough to send chills into a hot July night.

“We’re stabbing him and then we’re gone,” Oliver said. “I think he’s building pressure and has a tension pneumothorax. I’m not waiting for it to pop.”

“Copy. I’ve got bilateral fourteens in his ACs.” 

The catheters had found their veins and flashed blood like a slick red wink. “You want the fluid wide open?”

“Titrate to effect,” Oliver said. “He’s got a chest wound, not a dry tank. We don't want to wash out what pressure he’s got.”

He slid his stethoscope across ribs that rose too fast. Gibbs hissed between his teeth as he fought unconsciousness.

“Fuck,” Gibbs whispered, or maybe it was just air whistling through his clenched teeth.

“You and me both,” Oliver said. He tore open a needle decompression kit and prepped his target. The firefighter who’d been all eyes and panic leaned in a little closer, trying to see without getting in the way.

“You sure?” the firefighter breathed.

“No,” Oliver said. “But he doesn’t have time for me to find out.”

He swept the armpit, counting the ribs with his gloved fingertips, and landed on the fifth intercostal space anterior to the mid-axillary line. He prepped the area with an alcohol pad that he didn’t wait to dry. The 14-gauge, 3.25-inch catheter looked like a tent stake in his hand as he aimed for the rib and slid it just over the top, feeling the bone with the needle to avoid other intercostal vessels.

The resistance gave as the needle passed over the superior side of the rib with a hiss that blew past his glove like a tire losing air. It came with a wet rush that sounded like a lie becoming true.

Gibbs coughed up more pink foam and sucked in a deeper breath. His left chest wall rose slightly. His eyes flared, then dragged back down to Oliver’s face as if it was the only thing keeping him tethered to this world.

“Better?” Oliver asked.

Gibbs nodded once, a fraction.

“Good. Don’t get cocky,” Oliver said, talking more to himself than Gibbs. He taped the catheter so quickly that it was more a matter of intention than a craft. 

“We need to move.”

“We’ve got the elevator,” one of the firefighters said, finally useful again. “It’s ready.”

“Good,” Oliver said. “You—” he pointed at the least-frightened firefighter “—hold the IV bag. You—” a second firefighter “—grab the oxygen and the monitor. If he stops talking, you say my name like you mean it.”

“What about the other guy?” one security guard said, voice too loud in the room.

“The other guy is gone,” Cal said flatly, eyes still hard. “My partner isn’t.”

“Where's the second ambulance? It should be here by now.”

“Number Eight, on scene,” the radio on someone’s shoulder squawked.

The radio clicked, and beneath dispatch’s response, there was a second audio layer, soft as a menu prompt. One word vibrated in the background, not meant for human ears. “Flagged.”

Oliver froze for half a beat, then kept his hands moving like he hadn’t heard it.

The second ambulance had finally arrived, and Oliver barked at them as they entered the apartment.  

“What the fuck took you so long?”

“Dispatch cancelled us,” said the unpatched medic being pushed forward by his field trainer. 

“On an officer down?”

“It’s a cluster, Oliver,” said the field trainer. “Thankfully, EMS One was listening to the PD radio and sent us anyway.”

“Are you kidding me? Has dispatch never heard of the Golden Hour?”

He and Scott hoisted Gibbs onto the soft stretcher, the officer groaning like a dying engine, and dragged the aluminum frame down the hall in a rattling, bouncing sprint. The building seemed made of corners and bad lighting. Gunpowder from the shot mixed with cheap carpet cleaner and the metallic tang of blood.

Two other firefighters held the elevator doors as if by a force of will. The hue of Gibbs’s face stammered between oxygen-starved blue and stubborn pink. Oliver kept his hand jammed under his shoulder to keep the decompression site from catching on anything. He kept talking simple, dumb sentences, the kind of chatter that had gotten more people off the precipice of the valley of death than praying ever had.

“You’re going to hear a lot yelling,” he said. “You don’t need to worry about that. And when you see their faces, don’t get scared, get mad. Right now, your only job is to breathe.”

As the doors squeaked open with a shimmer, the elevator car stopped with a jolt and vomited the passengers into the main entrance of apartment building. Congregated outside the elevator was a pageant of cops in duty blues with their rifles pointed down, because rifle discipline is a religion. The cramped entryway of cheap tile led to an open door to the night, with every squad car on the block angled toward it, as if cops had ringed the building with headlights and hate.

“Move! Make a hole!” someone shouted, and the world obeyed.

They burst into the night, and the lights grabbed them by the hair. Oliver hadn’t noticed how hot the apartment had been until the cold October air blew on the hot sweat of his sticky neck. They normally never ran, but tonight, they ran. The ambulance sat squatting at the curb, its doors open, the street reflecting a river of glass and light.

“Careful with his lines. He's going to hate the ride back to DG.”

“I hate the ride to DG every day,” Scott said. And for a slice of a second, they were who they used to be, before tonight had burned it all down to the ground.

They shoved Gibbs into the box. Oliver pulled the doors and Scott slapped them closed with both palms. Scott cut around to the driver’s seat and keyed the sirens into a banshee scream.

The back of the rig became a moving metal chapel where motion was the only sacrament. The defib pads still clung to Gibbs’s chest. The gel puckered at the edges, and the cables looped around the monitor. Oliver snapped more monitor leads on Gibbs’s arms and legs -white right, green right, black left, red left. His hands moved while his mind read the numbers rolling off the monitor like bad dice at a crap table. Rate one-thirty, narrow complexes, an angry EKG. SpO₂ eighty-two and steady after the needling of his chest. Blood pressure ninety systolic with a cuff that fought the bouncing of Denver’s pot-holed streets. ETCO₂ low thirties and trending okay. Not great, but better than dying. But not by much.

“You’re okay,” Oliver said. “By which I mean you’re not dead.”

“Tell my wife,” Gibbs rasped, the sound of it landing like a blade in Oliver’s ribs.

“Tell her yourself,” Oliver interrupted, turning hope into an order. 

“Get him on a non-rebreather at fifteen,” he told the firefighter who’d climbed in with them. “I don’t need to tube him, yet. He’s maintaining his airway, and his vitals look okay. And then sit on your hands unless I tell you otherwise.”

“Copy,” the firefighter said, who actually sat on his hands after following his order, which would’ve made Oliver laugh on any other night.

“Pain?” Oliver asked Gibbs.

“Yeah.”

“Good. That means your brain’s still cashing checks.”

He palpated the abdomen, soft, non-tender. Pelvis stable, no holes, no crepitus, no blood. There was no fixing any major bleeds in a moving truck, so he always had to look for more holes. Diesel was the best drug for penetrating trauma. He peeled off his sweaty, bloody glove, fished for the vial of fentanyl in the narcotics lockbox, and then pushed 150 mcg of the synthetic drug into the IV port. Gibbs was on the edge, and Oliver could see it. Pain control, especially with fentanyl, was like playing chicken, and with his tenuous blood pressure, a wrong decision won nothing but eternal quiet.

“Stay with me,” Oliver insisted. “Think about your football days. Weren’t you a Bronco? Think about the worst PT you ever did and how this is just as bad, which means when you live through this, you’ve got bragging rights.”

Gibbs tried to smile and failed in a way that made Oliver’s teeth hurt.

The radio on the dash spat out orders and traffic updates as Scott drove. Somewhere in the babble, a voice like sheet metal said, “Unit one-four, be advised inefficient traffic routing around Eighth and Broadway is resulting in a delay. Advise ETA.”

Hearing it from the back, Oliver frowned. The cadence wasn’t the dispatcher he knew. It was modulated, as if a second voice were ghosting underneath it. Not a patch from Aurora dispatch; a transparent layer. He’d already heard it twice this week, the thin, clinical voice with syllables clipped in a way that sounded practiced, but empty. Denver’s new artificial intelligence dispatch pilot, the one everyone joked about in the break rooms, had begun its beta testing a few days ago. Another pilot program that, like all the other pilots tested in his busy, urban 911 system, would be declared a success in the impending press release regardless of reality.

“We hit a detour, we’re three minutes out,” Scott said into the mic without taking his foot off the floor.

“Copy,” the voice said. “Routing flagged for review.”

Flagged? Oliver thought. By whom? And then the rig bounced hard, and Gibbs groaned his attention back into the present.

Scott cut the corner onto Broadway like he was aiming for a gap in a defensive line. Oliver widened his stance and stayed glued to Gibbs with one hand, the other keeping the decompression catheter from shearing off on the gurney rail. The catheter quivered. A thin line of red tracked down and pooled on the tape. He blotted and retaped, swearing under his breath.

“You set me up?”

“Yep.”

“Code-10 trauma activation?”

“Yep. Left chest GSW, hemodynamically tenuous, needle decompressed. I don’t want the attending to be pissed when we arrive since we didn’t get clearance.”

“Thanks.”

 “DG’s spun up. They’ve got a big room waiting for us.”

Of course they do, Oliver thought. The big rooms at the city’s busiest Level One Trauma Center were the rooms with the decon sinks and the big drains. You knew you were in a trauma room if it had multiple sinks and drains.

The monitor beeped a rapid tune. SpO₂ eighty-eight. ETCO₂ thirty-five. Blood pressure ninety-two systolic, the sort of vitals that get memed in medic forums as The Last Normal Pressure Before They Fall Off The Cliff.

Gibbs’s gaze drifted, then snapped back to the present. Oliver came in tight over his face, unblinking. Eye contact was a hand on the back, pushing him away from the light.

“Stay with me,” he said. “Your daughter’s birthday is when?”

Gibbs blinked, confused by the question, then latched onto it like a lifeline. “October,” he managed.

“What day?”

“Fourteenth.”

“What kind of cake?”

“Chocolate.”

“Good. Now keep breathing.”

The ambulance bucked over a pothole that you could measure in feet, and Gibbs barked a painful noise that ricocheted between the metal walls. The firefighter’s knuckles went white around the ceiling’s handrail.

“Sorry,” Scott said from the front.

“Drive faster,” Oliver said, because there was no such thing as fast enough that night.

They slid into the ambulance bay in a hail of light and sound. The fluorescent ambulance bay lighting made everything ugly. The doors banged open like they were happy to escape, and Oliver was greeted by hands already reaching in: other paramedics, cops, green scrubs, navy scrubs, a face shield fogged with breath, an attending with hair the color of gunmetal and eyes that didn’t waste time. The trauma team was a pony built for one trick. Saving lives. 

“What do we have?” the attending asked, eyes on Oliver, not the blood.

“Mike Gibbs, thirty-four, single GSW left chest, entry third intercostal,” Oliver said, voice clean, steady. The report poured out of him like had been drilled into him when he was in the program almost two decades ago by the founders of emergency medicine. “Initial shortness of breath with hypotension. Needle decompressed left fifth ICS with good rush, improved respirations. Vitals en route: heart rate one-forty to one-thirty, BP ninety-two systolic, SpO₂ ninety-two on 15 liters NRB. Bi-lateral 14’s in the ACs. Mentating, oriented, significant pain, 150 mics of fentanyl IV push. No other obvious injuries. Unknown exit wound.”

“What’s the time from injury?” the attending asked.

“Six minutes from injury to ambulance, another twelve to the trauma bay,” Oliver said. The Golden Hour was burning like a candle wick in a dark cave, spending itself in a hurry. Sometimes, the Golden Hour mattered. Sometimes you were just hauling a warm ghost.

“Let’s get him inside,” the attending said. “Trauma activation has already been called.”

Inside Trauma Bay Two, they cut the rest of his clothes with the reverence of thieves. The maze of monitor leads, wires, tape, and field improvisation untangled with quick hands and sharp steel. The decompression catheter wobbled, but held. They flipped him with a roll that looked like choreography and checked his back. No exit. An ultrasound probe slid under his ribs and paint-by-echo images flickered on a monitor above the bed. Words like “hemo” and “pneumo” floated between people whose lives were spent turning those syllables back into living human beings.

Oliver stepped back because this was the part where stepping back was the only power he had. He hovered near the foot of the bed and watched. Scott slid in beside him. For a beat, the room’s noise faded to a packed cotton quiet where all Oliver could hear was his pulse in his ears and the faint clatter of a dropped stainless steel clamp.

“Who shot him?” someone asked at the edge of the room, like the answer would plug the hole.

“He was disarmed by the suspect,” Cal said from the doorway. When had he gotten there? His face looked ten years older than it had in the apartment.

“Tube him,” the attending said, and the team moved like the murmations of European Starlings changing direction. Gibbs’s world narrowed to an 8.0-sized plastic tube, a laryngoscope, and respirations that weren’t his anymore. His ETCO₂ tracing jumped and settled. The ventilator sighing sounded like a different kind of alive.

A nurse read off a blood pressure that made Oliver’s throat ache. Better. Not a victory, but a slight reprieve.

“You the medic?” a resident said near Oliver’s shoulder, voice trying for casual and missing.

“Yeah,” Oliver said.

“You did well,” the resident said, which sounded like a combination of congratulations and condolences.

“I did fast,” Oliver said. “We’ll see how well later.”

He felt the moment land. Now he was the furniture in the room. He stripped his gloves off and threw them into a bin that smelled like bleach and old pennies. Blood had found its way under his cuff, wormed into the hairs on his wrist like a signature that didn’t belong to him. He scrubbed at a sink until the water ran pink, then clear, then he scrubbed again for luck he didn’t believe in.

“Oliver,” Scott said, quietly enough that it felt like a secret. “You okay?”

The question felt stupid and kind. He nodded once.

“Hey,” Scott said, more firmly. “You did good.”

“I did what I could,” Oliver said. “We’ll see about the rest.”

The attending looked up, saw Oliver in the doorway, and gave a minimal nod that meant “stay close”. It also meant “we might need you in thirty seconds”. Oliver lived the next minute in the space between those two meanings, then a social worker appeared beside him like a conjured shape, a tablet tucked against her cardigan. The cardigan made him want to punch a wall.

“We’ll work with Denver PD about family notifications,” she said softly. “You were the responder on scene?”

“Yeah,” Oliver said.

“Thank you for bringing him in alive,” she said, and moved on to whatever version of paperwork made this easier to think about.

Oliver stepped into the hallway, and the hospital’s smells hit him square in the face -stale coffee, lemon disinfectant, the undertow of human body odor. In the waiting room, a muted TV ran a feel-good story about a dog hauled from an icy pond. The footer crawling underneath pushed a winter-weather advisory that no one in scrubs would read until they were scraping frost off their windshields at 3 a.m.

For a beat, the lower-third lagged and mislabeled the weather advisory, ‘AegisHealth Advisory’, before the chyron corrected to ‘New AI 911 Pilot Approved’, as if nothing had happened.

He blinked, let it go, but the words stuck. He’d seen AegisHealth’s logo on the MDT terminal two nights ago, too. It was just a banner on an internal memo, he had told himself. The TV flipped back to the dog wrapped in blankets. But the residue of the night remained.

He checked his watch. It had been three minutes since the doors had swallowed Gibbs. Three minutes that felt like forever. 

Scott came out and leaned shoulder to shoulder with him like old friends leaning against a bar. The blood on his sleeve had dried into a stiff ridge of maroon.

“PD wants us back at the scene,” Scott said without energy. “Statements for the detectives.”

“Did they call the other guy?” Oliver said, tasting the words for the first time.

“Number Eight got a pronouncement and a time of death,” Scott said. “PD says the scene belongs to them until they decide it doesn’t.”

“Yep,” Oliver said. He pushed off the wall. The same wall he’d been leaning on six months ago when a twelve-year-old had coded on Christmas Eve. Same room. Same hospital. Different drain.

As they pushed through the ED doors, a sergeant passed with a phone to his ear. “Variance?” he asked like an unknown diagnosis, and kept moving.

They walked back into the night, and the sirens had been traded for the groan and rattle of city life resuming its never-ending spin. Their rig was bleeding purple off the bumper where the blood had already seeped into everything porous inside. A tech stacked linens in the outside closet like a man on deadline, avoiding their cot with the bloody sheet pulled tight.

“Need a mop?” the tech asked.

“I am the mop,” Oliver said without looking at him.

1pz9l26,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pz9l26,"Fishing as of Version 1.1 (December 27-29, 2025)","This post is less serious and more so me wanting to ramble and get things off my mind with fishing as a minigame in DNA (Duel Night Abyss).

I have used some information from a friend/community member in a Discord Server we use to discuss things as either a baseline/reinforcement for some of the information here. I will edit this post later if they wish to be added as one of the people credited for part of these discoveries.

Please note that I will be using the Grand master rod, and At Peace trait for all the fishing data.  
These are findings that might become out of date when a new update arrives, or Versions 1.x or even future types come out. This is currently Version 1.1, dated December 27-29, 2025.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I started this post with a thought of, ""Is there any post by other members in the community in regards to where the best \[fishing\] spots would be?"" Or even, ""How much does each fish sell for? Should I keep the smaller fish that are used for the bigger fish?""

Well in Version 1.1 , where they give you the option to get the ""At Peace"" trait through 20k fishing coins, I can finally do some form of documentation with the minigame.

Through this process I've learned a few things...

1. To change the time in the Huaxu fishing points, you will need to have made it past the 1.1 Main Storyline as you can only access the time change feature after >!you find out Zhiliu is planning on getting rid of the Dragon to become a God.!< If you have not reached that point then you will not be able to change the time if so.
2. Without ""At Peace"", you would need to ensure you press the ""Space Bar"" or whatever input you need to start the reeling game when the exclamation marks come in. Otherwise you lose the fish and bait chance. With the trait. The fish will never let go.
   * As you can see here...
   * [Fishing Video](https://youtu.be/0n7EQiIUQB0)
3. When using the small fish to get a bigger fish (Blue to Purple, or Purple to Gold), The second fish counts as a fishing try. So if the limit was 100 fish per area, you take 2 of those chances for one fish.
4. Overall, the baits are not that influential in what type of fish you get, overall. In my experience you get around the same amount with possibly little changes in rates of what fish you get. Although there does seem to be more variants with the Like Attracts Like bait. Or maybe it's a placebo. Keep that in mind.
   1. As of December 29, 2025. It does seem like they have made a minor bugfix to actually change the chances of getting higher tier fish with the Cluckin' Good bait. It has definitely affected my third day result.
5. Variants of fishes do catch for more Fishing coins. However for Gold tier, the variants cost the same.
6. If you use a base version of a smaller fish to get the bigger one. There is a chance to get a Variant of the bigger fish. Although this is most likely a bug and not a feature. The variant smaller fish should guarantee a variant bigger fish, but it's also possible that you get the basic version instead.
   * As proof from my time fishing for the bigger catches. I never caught the blue variant, but I was able to get the purple variant. (Edgefin to Cichlid)
   * As for the Variant smaller fish not getting the variant bigger fish, you can look at image 3. (Starfish to Shrimp)
7. ~~The timer didn't start for when you can catch a bigger fish. This is true the first day I started to note down the information. As of December 28 a timer of 10 seconds starts when you reel in the needed small fish. Quickest you can bring the image down is when the timer shows an 8 for Huaxu fishing spots. For any in the Island or Icelake region (Version 1.0 lands), the timer does not start quickly.~~
   * ~~This is the Huaxu location~~ [~~here...~~](https://youtu.be/8W9la61wl80)
   * ~~This is Purgatorio/Icelake location~~ [~~here...~~](https://youtu.be/JSjnh7FnVPQ)
8. This point has been rendered changed as the Huaxu fishing points as of December 29, 2025 has changed to be the same like Purgatorio/Icelake with a paused timer.
9. There is a bug where if you were to try and reel in the moment the exclamation points appear, then the exclamation will not disappear until you put the rod back in and reel back once again.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Now it's time to put my Results here and discuss them.

First I just want to say I have now made 187 coffees and did notice a change in taste after the last 120ish. I do believe you need to give the grinder a “break in” period before you start to get the most out of the beans. 

Grinder set at 3, with intensity 5, temperature medium.  

Espresso creates a 15.8g dry puck  

Total coffee output.  

Small = 32g  

Medium = 44g  

Large = 52g  

2x Espresso creates a 20g dry puck

I’m pretty aware situationally so I noticed a guy in the corner, who was on his phone, didn’t pay much attention to it. Sometime later a friend of his came, who started watching me from his peripheral vision, I was drinking my coffee and was in business formals, but was pretty alarmed and very uncomfortable so I decided to go up when they started walking closer to me. The metro station has two gates and I went for the gate which not a lot of people would pick, looked back and saw, and those two were at a distance at the other gate clearly looking around. I didn’t really wanna run so I just stood there waiting for my friend while keeping an eye on the guys. He spotted me and halted, one had gone up and his friend stopped him and was just lurking around there looking at me. Luckily my friend came and they just stood there in the corner smirking at me and giving me really weird glances. My friends and I rushed to the office and I feel a bit better now, I do get the sense that they probably intended to follow me or something worse. Nonetheless I am very very paranoid, I have anxiety and my mind is conjuring up all sorts of scenarios. Whether they knew me, was I stalked, what if they wanted to kidnap me or hurt me. I’ve dealt with worse but I really am extremely paranoid right now. I also regret not having the common sense to record them or make a ruckus or call security.

I’m actually looking to **date** — slowly, respectfully, with effort. Not chasing drama, not speed-running romance. Just two normal people seeing if things click.

About me (honest version):  
– Calm, introvert-ish  
– Dry humour, slightly self-aware  
– Listens well, talks nonsense once comfortable  
– Emotionally sorted, not intense, not clingy

If you’re a girl reading this and thinking:  
“Okay, this guy sounds decent, funny, and low-stress” — hi 👋  
If not, totally fine, hope this at least made you smile.

BangaloreSocial felt like the only place where quiet people might actually exist outside their houses.  
If you’re open to talking, you can DM. No pressure, no expectations.

Worst case: nice conversation.  
Best case: coffee + walks + mutual ‘same yaar’ energy.

I’m a 35-year-old gay man who moved to London from Scotland a few years ago with my partner. Since then, I’ve found it a bit tricky to meet other LGBTQ+ people with similar interests. One of my goals for 2026 is to be more social, so I’d love to make some new friends. 🙂

My interests include gaming, books, TV, film, travel, and tech/software development. I’m also planning to focus on getting fitter in 2026, so it’d be great to connect with others who are into fitness or looking for some motivation.

I’d be up for coffee, nights out, movie or gaming nights — or even just heading to a co-working space together for some company while working.

We’re basically like sisters, we share clothes, secrets, everything. I love her to death and I’ve always made it a point to go all out for her.  For her birthday and other occasions, I spend weeks being so picky, saving up, and trying to find the perfect gift because I want her to feel special. So, I hosted her and her little brother for Christmas Eve dinner . We had an amazing time, ordered food, watched movies, just deep-heart-to-hearts. Then we did gifts. I got her a specific pendant that took me forever to choose, plus a cute Christmas hoodie. She handed me a temperature-control mug. I was actually touched because I basically live on coffee and I remember mentioning months ago that I wanted one. I was so happy thinking, wow, she actually listens and cares. A bit later, she stepped out to take a long phone call. I was hanging out with her little brother (who is adorable) and I told him how much I loved the gift they brought me. He looked at me and went, Yeah, she was so happy she scored it from that slash thing on tiktok. I felt like I got hit by a bus. It wasn't about the money; it was the realization that while I was out spending my hard-earned savings and time picking out something meaningful for her, she just handed me a freebie she won while scrolling on her phone. It made me spiral, I started wondering if every thoughtful gift she’s given me over the years was just some random free thing she happened to come across. When she came back inside, my mood had completely shifted. I tried to hide it, but I was visibly cold and quiet. She kept asking me what was wrong and if she’d done something, but I didn't want to start a fight on Christmas Eve or make her feel gift-shamed, so I just said I was tired. It pretty much ruined the rest of the night and she left early because the vibe was so awkward. Now I'm sitting here feeling like a brat, but also feeling incredibly undervalued. So, AIO? Should I have just been happy that she remembered I wanted a mug, regardless of how she got it? Or is it valid to be hurt that she didn't actually put any effort (or a single cent) into my gift ?",18,1767071057.0,AmIOverreacting,51,0.73,False

Short description: perpetually lonely, live inside my head - almost always watching myself (like i'm constantly aware of what i'm feeling/thinking) as there're no other conventional sources of noise to distract myself, observe think a lot about my own emotional responses to specific situations and exploring possible reasons, think about human behavior a bit, philosophy of knowing, among others. I want to feel *connected* to someone you know - I have a lot to say (hundreds and hundreds of entries I would like to share with someone), but I haven't really come across someone who I *want* to share things with. *Want* to be with. *Feel* happy and content around. And I think that probably comes from not having relatable thoughts and experiences with anyone. In my entire life, I've only had (thankfully, still do) a single real friend, but I still don't feel *connected* like I mentioned above.

I'm going to paste some entries from a journal I maintain (the only place where I am myself, and express whatever I think and feel). You can take a look at my other posts, for starters. I've shared quite a lot in them.

1. i've always wanted that ONE connection who can appreciate my thought processes - say to me that they've thought of similar things too, and share them - i'd be VERY happy to see someone with similar thought processes share their thoughts with me, and it would make me WANT to talk to them enthusiastically. i have one friend, but even they don't have nearly the same thought processes as i do, and it's kind of resulting in me losing enthusiasm while talking with them even though they're a wonderful friend. it's like, you see them recounting their experiences, and you light up, saying ""HEY I can relate to THAT!!"" and that instantly would form a bond (not in the light sense, but a bond in an almost literal sense, tying you together tightly, making you WANT {i'm writing WANT in uppercase to emphasize it... like i've never truly WANTED to be with someone, WANTED to talk to them enthusiastically, MISSED them, things like that})...
2. i want to share every single thing, the good and the ugly with them. and it's not just a matter of them not saying it to others (trust), but also a matter of me WANTING to share everything with them and i think that WANT won't arise until i FEEL the WANT, until I can FEEL that they'd appreciate it you know, like... just relatable/resonating experiences and thought processes...
3. i was handling the hot water for making coffee. the coffee powder got over so i thought i could pour water in it (like i'd seen in a reel where the guy had poured water into the glass bottle full of powder, saying it was for exam prep), so that i could use the remaining bit of coffee stuck to the edges, but in an instant, i stopped, asking if the glass could withstand the hot water. now, how exactly was i able to, in that one second, connect the 2 pieces of information - water is hot, and the bottle is made of glass, to produce the new piece of information (question) whether it was safe? i mean in that one second to have thought of it (or rather, to be provided that connection - framing it differently to take away the agency from me) idk... could have very well proceeded with pouring the water. wonder how the brain works, and moreover, \*i\* wasn't in much control of making that connection... we can be more lenient with people, i mean, i wouldn't blame one for not making that connection in an instant...

in the same light, was wondering about secret spilling... i mean, it just takes a moment to blurt out something you ought not to have. now, i somehow seem to possess the ability to remember that i shouldn't say out something aloud, when the conversation skirts around the secret... the thought to say it aloud does form, but so does the counteracting one...

looks like i can cut everyone who spills secrets some slack (unless if they did it deliberately)... i mean can i take much credit, just like the previous case, if the thought just strikes me (and can i blame if the thought doesnt strike them... it takes just a moment i mean)

3. am i saying that *I* dress up not entirely for myself as an objective representation of how i feel, or is it something else, mean, how the hell is one supposed to run an internal diagnostics to figure this out? and forget that, how am i supposed to stop and wonder what spirit i make arguments in? i mean, i think occam's razor fails spectacularly... the easiest explanation for ""i dress up not completely for myself"" is that i actually feel that way (i'm not even talking from a 2nd person's perspective, observing me making this statement, i'm talking about my *own* persp, if i feel this way... the explanation i'm going to be giving myself, implicitly so, is this only), can we ever know anything.  
No proof of whether you're feeling it actually or giving a feeling words from a few data points (see couple -> general feeling of bad {without nuance, just feeling ""low"" when it could be ""jealous"" or anything like that, and that level of nuance could call for a more nuanced explanation than the have/not have narrative that one could use because they have access to only a very generic set of data points and since others say the same, they assign these words. It's like evaluating a model on its output, which is unreliable, without access to internals...

4. random, naive thought... but by molding the brain into frameworks we know and understand (computational model) for our ease of understanding instead of viewing it objectively for what it is, don't we risk reduction?what are models in the first place? trying to represent stuff we see around in the language we understand. for eg., modelling social interactions as graphs (esp Social media followers). now whether a mathematical set of symbols, lines, and numbers can represent the complex realities of connections is a question. but this is what modelling is, i think. \*might\* be reductionist, but that's not my judgement to make. is reality a video, or can be *treated*/*modeled* as a video? is language a *representation* of thought, or thought itself? if these are just representations/models, what *is* the thing itself?

5. for eg., i told the guy i wanted to go to the other room instead of sitting in this area (and asked him if he wanted to come there too), because the tables there were bigger and more comfortable... now that's not the reason for me wanting to switch, the major reason is that i get to be alone, use discord freely and type out my thoughts, talk to gpt... privacy in one word... being free to feel what i feel... but it *does* sound like a valid enough reason, the table thingie... hmm. i think we can further categorize this into conscious and subconscious excuse-reasoning... i consciously knew the actual reason. the other is a subconscious excuse-reasoning in which we want something but we might not know the exact reason and instead, *genuinely* think that another reason is the reason for it... not limited to just achieving something,

6. so i was listening to songs, but found most of the ones in this playlist uninteresting, when i thought that perhaps the probability of me liking a song depends on whether i've listened to it already in childhood or something. now, this wasn't the first time i'd had this thought, but other times, i'd kind of... let the thought pass? like, think of thoughts that keep flowing in a river, and you see them passing by and they drift away. sometimes they come back. today, i ""caught"" the thought, kind of became more... conscious of it? i wouldn't say i hadn't been conscious at all to the previous instances, like, i *had* engaged with it- seen it take birth, acknowledge it with a ""hmm, possible reason"" and kind of let it go without much thought, i hadn't become ""consciously conscious"" if i have to put it that way until now. today, i saw the thought come, and ""caught"" it, and became ""more"" conscious, and am writing about it promptly so are there different ""types"" of thoughts

7. arriving at the wrong conclusion... if someone sees me not talking much in, say a party, they will form a 'hypothesis' that i'm a shy introvert who doesn't want humans. they perform 'experiments', establish 'repeatability' by making me sit in different situations (and unknown to them, implicitly, in groups). they then come to the conclusion that the hypothesis is indeed correct. ""scientifically"", ""data-driven""

but that conclusion is wrong... partially at least i'm that way in *groups*. 1-1, i'm much more comfortable. someone comes across this - like how it was discovered newton's laws don't apply on the quantum level, and only then do they realize the incompleteness of the conclusion.

how do we make the jump - circling around the evidence and suddenly, making the leap to the conclusion, or in a more mathematical manner which i thought of some days back - treating all the evidence as input, how do we design a function that will produce the right conclusion? f(evidence)=conclusion?

i think this is where falsifiability works nicely... some good scientist will seek to actively disprove the hypothesis, and try whatever he can to do so, and in some time, will come across a situation that does so... and if all his attempts are rendered useless, perhaps he could come to the (provisional!) conclusion that i am a shy introvert who doesn't want humans...

(i mean, even now, the conclusion is kind of wrong... it's not like i don't want humans. i desperately seek a deep connection, so when i see it not being fulfilled anywhere around me (in a particular context - say, a schoolmates meeting, and in general too), i don't speak much, and don't appear invested or engaged because i feel it won't lead to anything useful. how do you find \*that\*

8. Was helping him out, for 9 hours almost straight, with one break . Around 11:45, he asked me to stop doing it coz he had to leave. Now, i should have immediately stopped then and there, coz he himself asked me to, and sighed a heave of relief. After all, it's a chore for me, i have nothing to gain from it. But, i insisted on continuing, wanted to finish that task. I still had a bit left at that time, and I didn't want to leave it unfinished. Why the determination to finish it?

One could be a form of perfectionism... The unfinished task would irk me. One simple conclusion (perhaps the one that he, and most people if they'd seen me helping him out, would walk away with) is that I'm just a kind, helpful person and I wanted him to do well, but i don't want to buy this yet.

Some sort of power in helping (do i want someone to feel better, or do *I* want to be the one making them feel better?)? *I* become the reason he possibly scores more marks. In other words, *I* held the power over his marks to an extent.

9. i've kept oscillating b/w reading literature->but i should ""fertilize and till the mind""->lit theory->but wait i also need philosophy to evaluate arguments->but i feel lonely and sad so i need hobbies->back to lit for happiness. and the cycle does on

lol not to forget the ""elon read physics when he was 12 you're reading because you want mushy teen wattpad"" and declaring literature as a waste of time and going back to philosophy only to feel lonely again and think of coming back to lit

10. Was fine initially , although not fully present still... Just forcing laughter and smiles and conversations... But as time passed, especially after food i really wanted to leave and be alone. But I had to stay there... They were talking to others and I didn't know what to do, kept pacing around, with a blank expression on my face. Wanted to... Hit something with a bat, was getting frustrated... There was a bottle in my hand and i kept flinging it from hand to hand rather forcefully, and sometimes trying to squeeze it with my hand...

On more than one occasion I felt like tearing up... Fkn college has sucked all the joy out of life and it's been a fucking miserable 3 years, only to end up here, with almost no job no grades no friends no love fkn hell...

11. was in the review meeting with R. initially it was fine.. doing ok only, working on the edits but as time went by... started becoming dull, wasn't listening to him as intently, just nodding along instead of sharing my inputs as well, and he might have noticed i was visibly duller, i probably would have used the age old excuse of being sleepy..

was walking back, and this time i wasn't even feeling lonely (i know how loneliness feels, i want her {her is not any specific, real person, but an imaginary companion i sometimes \[fine not sometimes\] think of to cope} beside me to hug me, this time i didn't really want it, and even picturing her didn't help much when it is clear that it \*would\* help if she were by me). just slowly trudged along with a dull, indifferent expression. reached my room and had a couple of tears for absolutely no reason. i just was feeling very less enthusiastic and automaticity also went down... i had to kickstart my limbs from the usual halt when, say, eating the snack... the hand just stopped midway. twitched a couple of times.

12. was feeling empty as usual, tried to talk with people on the ""Lonely Peeps"" server, but they were kids. Switched off light, tried hugging the pillow to feel some semblance of touch, to no avail. Had a tear or two, dried up, repeated. Then started crying full-blown. Complete with sobbing...convulsive gasps

was muttering ""i dont want to feel this way anymore"" (went back to 3rd sem...i think it started in 1st sem, but it hadn't become this intense, just signs - ""how to make friends"", ""frientimacy"" such videos.)

hope kept dwindling...how am i going to find someone to feel connected with. (remembered the image which was eerily similar to mine. )

thought of asking for help...from my college sub. even from someone irl. wanted to cry on someone's shoulder while being held. not some nobody, but someone who'd get it...

I, 31F, have started the transition to go from very casual art to more serious. My skills are getting better and I am noticing that smaller and smaller things are starting to restrict me. Things like the quality of my materials and how I use my space. It's getting to a point where I can't just do this on my coffee table anymore if I want to continue growing as an artist. I'm thinking I need an easel. But my problems with this are several:

1. I have never used an easel, even in art class at school before. I'm worried about having to adapt to doing everything vertically impacting my art quality and setting me back as an artist, ruining the progress I have worked so hard at. 

2. I don't know how to choose one. Most easels are aimed at kids. I know I need one that can reliably fold away when I am not using it, but that's really about it. 

3. I have been doing all my pieces on paper that is not exactly letter size but basically close to it. Stuff I can put on the fridge, the wall of my office, whatever. I feel like easels are for big paper... is making pieces on close to letter size paper practical on an easel? If not, what size paper should I start looking for? 

4. I have been doing mostly mixed media art. Some of it involves painting of course, but it also involves a lot of glue. I have been using Elmer's, but it's obviously extremely runny and doesn't hold up to gravity very well. What kind of glue should I use for my mixed media art instead that can hold up to gravity on an easel? 

5. How do I clean it and otherwise maintain it? I feel like every artist easel I see is covered in old paint, but I don't want anything in my house to look like that, so I am wondering if there is a such thing as an easy clean easel or something.

Traditional sofas always created awkward seating arrangements where half the group ended up on chairs facing away from everyone else. We found a c shaped sofa that curved around our coffee table, and it transformed how we use the room.


The sectional creates a natural conversation circle where everyone can see each other without craning their necks. Game nights became more engaging because nobody was isolated at the far end. Movie nights felt cozier with everyone within the curved embrace of the sofa. We can comfortably seat eight people in a way that feels intimate rather than crowded.


Our friend who is an interior designer mentioned these curved sectionals have gotten popular in Asian and European markets, with many furniture manufacturers offering them through wholesale platforms like Alibaba for retailers. The trend is moving away from traditional linear seating.

Hello, everyone. I am from MNL, PHL-- 29/F. I had my first attack last June and went to the Emergency Care for about 3 hours, all I thought was acid reflux. Had my a bearable episode in November (I thought I was just stressed). My usual symptom starts with indigestion, heart burn, then back pain. When the back pain becomes 8 to 10/10, that is when I go to the ER.


I had another mid December - same stay at the ER and was just given pain meds. Had another intense episode after Christmas and just coming home from a confinement. They saw that I have 1 gallbladder stone - 1.5cm x 1.4cm. My doctor does not recommend surgery since it is not blocking my bile duct nor is my gallbladder inflammed. They just gave me omeprazole + domperidone plus Kremil-S advance for management. However, over the last few days post confinement, I feel fatigue easily and some bouts of ache in my stomach/back (maybe 1 or 2 in the pain scale).

I have a 1 month trip abroad for school this January and I am very anxious for another attack. Reading posts here make me calmer but would love to hear some words to ease the anxiety -- I have been religious in avoiding fats (coffee is a tough but slowly weaning off).

I've been frustrated with personal finance apps for years. They're either so detailed you drown in data, or they lack the flexibility you need when real life happens. So I built **Pfynn**, a new kind of finance app for those looking for a calmer alternative.

**What is Pfynn?**

Pfynn believes day-to-day financial calm comes from answering two questions simultaneously:

1. How much money will I have left at the end of *this month*?
2. How much money will I have left at the end of *next month*?

Everything else (transaction details, spending categories, budgets, etc.) is noise.

To give you that clarity, Pfynn does three things:

* **Centers you on two numbers:** After each weekly review, you see *This Month's Leftover* and *Next Month's Projection*. Those numbers account for your income, your known obligations (rent, car, utilities, subscriptions, loans), credit card payments due now (and then), and what cash is rolling over into next month.
* **Skips transaction tracking entirely:** During onboarding, you list your 15–25 main monthly obligations, the recurring expenses that actually shape your financial life. Pfynn connects to your accounts via Plaid and updates your two numbers automatically. No need to categorize every coffee or one-off purchase.
* **Built for households natively:** Partners can share a complete financial view, so you're making decisions together, not guessing. Of course solo households can use Pfynn just as easily!

**Why am I posting?**

I'm looking for real-world feedback from anyone willing to give Pfynn a shot:

* Is onboarding clear or confusing?
* Any bugs when connecting accounts?
* Are there painful or unclear parts of the UI/UX?
* Does focusing on just two numbers actually help you feel calmer about your finances?

**Who's it for?**

Anyone who wants to feel ""in control, not overwhelmed."" If you want a finance app you can actually stick with, giving you peace of mind in just a few minutes a week, Pfynn is for you.

**How to join:**

* Open to all iOS users (TestFlight): [https://testflight.apple.com/join/htUHss2A](https://testflight.apple.com/join/htUHss2A)
   * (If you don't already have TestFlight, you'll need to download it from the App Store first.)
* No hard deadline. Just try it out and share honest feedback!

If there's interest I'll make this available for free (I might put up a 'buy me a coffee' link). It does everything I want from a training app - no more, no less - and only cost me half a morning while I drank some coffee.











Still working out some bugs, but seriously - it's crazy how easy this was to build.

Coworking spaces, coffee shops, body doubling on video calls I get things done. The moment I’m alone at home with no one observing? Total paralysis.

It’s not about distractions. I can sit in silence for hours and still do nothing. But put me somewhere public or on a call where someone can see me working and suddenly my brain turns on. Tasks feel doable. Time moves.

That’s when it hit me my productivity isn’t internally driven. It’s performative. I’m motivated by being seen as productive not by the work itself. Without external accountability, my brain just stops initiating.

What frustrates me is that most productivity advice assumes motivation comes from inside. Discipline, goals, passion, willpower. But for me none of that works without some form of social presence even passive.

How do people actually motivate themselves from an internal source? Is this something you can build or do some brains just need external structure to function?

TW

I'm sorry, this post is a bit rambling and I dont know what I'm looking for. It's my first time writing about any of this part of my life.

My (36f) mother (56f) died suddenly and unexpectedly almost 2 years ago. It's a complicated situation I guess. 

Background: 
My mother was violent, aggressive, physically and emotionally abusive to me and my siblings when I was growing up. When I was 12, out of nowhere (or so it appeared to me at the time) she left. I remember hearing a voicemail from her declaring she had no kids and no husband to never contact her again. So...I didn't. None of us did. My dad continued to raise myself and my siblings as a single parent. 
Actually I lie, I reached out shortly before I got married because I guess I was feeling somewhat emotional missing out on the mother/daughter aspects of planning a wedding. That was met with name calling and further abusive behaviours so I never reached out again. (oh the reappearance repressed trauma! What was I thinking?) It instilled such fear and anxiety in me that I hired security for my wedding just in case she found out the details and turned up 

Anyway, between that exchange and ger death, zero contact. 

I received a call from father one day almost 2 years ago who told me she had died. Her brother contacted my father who in turn was the messenger. I froze, I couldn't breathe. I was relieved, upset, worried, afraid, confused, relieved again, then felt guilty for feeling all of those. Then it got worse...
Her family decided since we were her children and my father was still technically married to her, it fell on us to provide a funeral. 

My brother took on the task, against all of our wishes. Then somehow we all, one by one, got drawn in. For me personally, if my name was going to be associated with this person, I wanted to control how. Things got out of hand though, her family completely abandoned her and us during the planning process, then turned up and the funeral and refreshments afterwards. 100% of all costs and duties fell to us. My dad blanked, he stepped out, he couldn't believe we were doing this. Neither could I, but in hindsight, man, grief makes a person do strange things. 

Anyway, thanks to my brother being a ""yes man"" with the funeral director, and taking the lead in making plans without telling the rest of us siblings, I and my siblings were side-swiped wgen we were taskrd last minute with carrying her coffin and and out of the church for the funeral. Wtf... how did that happen. I wasn't going to make a scene in a church, in front of my father, my friends, my work colleagues who had come to support me. I had to just go along with it. 

Later same day, after the refreshments, which my husband and I paid for (teas, coffees, sandwiches), my mother's brother asked the staff for a copy of the receipt, and spent the next few weeks parading it around claiming he paid for the whole thing. Again, wtf...

For some context, my mother's family are all slightly aggressive, do their own thing, very sensitive people, who likely have mental health issues, alcoholism, and like to be centre stage without putting in the work. She had met another man, a long term partner, who also stepped back and let us take all of this on. Birds of a feather eh...

I dont really know where I'm going with this. I guess, it's 2 years on, it's Christmas, I'm still affected by the whole thing. The way the funeral went, the sudden-ness, the sheer confusion of this new kind of grief. I found out my mother had some mental health disorders I was previously unaware of, namely munchausens/fictitious disorder imposed on self, as well as borderline personality disorder. It resolves and explains so much for me knowing this. 

But I still grieve...I grieve the mother she was in little good moments in my childhood, I grieve the loss of any chance of a future relationship - not that I wanted one at the time of her death. I grieve the concept of a mother. Something I needed so so many times in adolescence and adulthood but never had, not even close. I feel guilty for feeling free, but I feel sad. 

Anyway, I think I'm rambling now. I guess I'm wondering how a person who caused so much trauma in my younger years, continues to invade moments like christmasses and birthdays and turn them sad. I wish there was a timeline on this. 

Also, I conclude that I definitely need therapy!

“God, all I need is some coffee.”, I thought to myself, rising out of bed once again at 12:00 o’clock noon for the fifth day in a row. This was unlike me, I always prided myself on my ability to fall and stay asleep, as well as my ability to be mundanely punctual. Not having a job had really been taking its toll on me. I hadn’t left the house since Christmas Eve, I didn’t even really care what day of the week it was (and to be honest, I found myself slightly stumbling to remember particularly that, amidst all the inconsequential day-dreaming I had been doing). Stir-craziness was setting in, and with it, an awful bout of boredom and depression. The coffee just made it happen faster, fucked me off right to the next day, the definition of perpetual repeating insanity.

I’d wake up late, visit the bathroom, wonder when I had showered last. A lot of the time, I would practice bass, determined to learn a new song every day, or I’d lament on the couch, playing the same video games I’ve beaten a hundred times over within the last ten years. It’s been just awful, like my life has been on pause. Where was my one cat? I remember looking for him recently…I have three, but the grey one seems to have been misplaced. I swear, sometimes I felt like I only woke up an hour ago, but then it’d seem like it was already 5:00 pm…it doesn’t make a whole lot of sense to me, I hadn’t been doing much, and five hours had vanished, along with one of my cats apparently. No one had been texting me, either. I’ve been trying to organize these shows, line up side work, but it seems that my inquiries have gone unnoticed.

As I continued to zone out on the couch, I errantly looked at my text thread, seeing if anyone’s reached out, and my attention was drawn to the thread I share with my wife. Two recent texts:

“Are you proud of me…”, I had asked.

She had replied, “I try to be, but you know this has been hard on me lately, as well, you not having a job. I know you’ve been trying your best, but your best hasn’t been good enough. If things don’t improve soon, I may have to leave.”.

This was definitely not the response I had been hoping for at the time. When had I received this text? Christ, it had been a week before Thanksgiving, which made it nearly over a month ago! My wife and I had shared a bed just last night, I remember because she kept pushing me off every time I had tried to get closer to her. At least…I thought that was last night. I remember it was the night I had a bit too much to drink while my wife was at work, and I had drug myself into bed, waiting for her. No, it couldn’t have been last night, because last night I wasn’t drunk, wasn’t I? I wasn’t so zoned out and isolated that I couldn’t remember just last night. So, where was my wife? Maybe she just went out with friends after work and didn’t tell me about it. I had fallen asleep before while waiting for her to get home, only to find her gone in the morning…or, afternoon when I’d actually get out of bed.

“Will you be home soon?”, I texted her, quickly, not wanting to stress her out or bother her even more. I checked my watch, noticing a time of 3:00 am. It was becoming harder to fall asleep now, I noticed. Maybe that’s why I kept losing so much time. That, and the increasing amount I drank every night. Maybe that’s why my wife had been avoiding me for four weeks. Maybe my sort of inexplicable loss of time was why I hadn’t really noticed that stench until now.

“You festering sack of shit..”, I told myself, rising out of bed on a not-so-new day, right around the beautiful hour of 12 o’clock noon. Yeah, it was obvious, I fucking reeked. Putrid body odor pouring from my armpits and groin, the smell of shit emanating from all around me, like I had been diagnosed with an abhorrent disorder of perpetual flatulence. Through my daily shaky haze, I could discern that I hadn’t changed my clothes in weeks. Same flannel pajama pants, same shit-stained underwear, worn out socks and snot-soaked shirt. I decided it was time for a bodily inspection, I wasn’t suicidal yet, so I wanted to make sure I was only just clean enough to avoid infection or sickness so I wouldn’t die. Aside from the layers of grease, sweat, dead skin, and dirt, I didn’t seem so bad.

“What’s this..?”, I said out loud, the sound startling me. I had forgotten what the sound of my voice was like, and it didn’t agree with my atrophied ear drums. During my “inspection”, I noticed something off about my finger nails. They were longer than usual, of course, but aside from the grime and dirt that had accumulated under them, I noticed a brown-ish, caked-on substance scattered about the tips of my fingers, and no, it wasn’t shit. I knew as much because when I tasted it, it had a faint iron-like tinge to it. Blood. Old blood, at that.

“What the fuck?”, I thought. I knew I had a habit of picking my nose as I slept, but never to the point of making it bleed. I thought this had to have been the case, however, so I ran downstairs to the bathroom to get a look at my face, nearly tripping on the stairs and crushing the other two fleeing cats to death in my wake. Peering into the mirror, my face was unrecognizable to me. Deep, dark bags under my eyes, overgrown and greasy hair way longer that I had anticipated. It looked like I had been drained of blood, electrocuted, and had been given a hair growth supplement on account of my beard being the longest I had ever seen it. Luckily though, I did not notice any blood on or around my nose. Where had it come from, then? It had to have been from somewhere! That’s when I noticed that my stink was nothing compared to the stench that I had just noticed was overpowering my senses as soon as I overcame the shock of looking at my sorry face. I then surveyed the bathroom, noticing things I hadn’t previously upon my barreling into the room. The toilet had not been flushed in ages, I honestly could not tell when the last time it had been. Yellow grime snaked its way along every counter surface, along with discarded trash and old semen-soaked towels. Ragged toe nails and pubic hair littered the ground near the defeated and destroyed toilet. I vomited onto the floor, donating even more horrid color and aroma to the most disgusting art display I had ever witnessed.

“What in the holy fuck!”, I yelled, the effort scraping the inside of my throat, fragile from disuse and dehydration. I aimed my immature complaints straight at my wife in the event she was in the house and I just couldn’t see her.

“You know I’ve been struggling lately! I can’t fucking do this on my own! I tried to be more, I tried to get past losing my job, I tried to keep up on chores! All I’ve done is attempt to better myself through all this shit, and you CAN’T EVEN HELP ME CLEAN THIS SHIT UP!!”. With the end of this utterance, I promptly slipped in my fresh vomit and hit my head on the edge of the toilet, making me see stars…

I lay on the floor, extremely dazed and even more lost. I had given up trying to figure out what time it was, all I knew as I lay on my side on the filthy bathroom floor was the light that was weakly coming in through the window suggested the sun was just about to set. I tried not to move for fear I had concussed myself. I lay still, only my eyes darting around the room. They fixated on the air vent cover, directly in front of my face. It was slightly out of place, like it had recently been disturbed. Also, it had caked onto the edge of it the same substance that covered my fingers. Dread covered me, filled me with a feeling so stifling, I didn’t move until the sun had almost completely set. I slowly got myself to my hands and knees to inspect what garnered my attention. I gripped the edges of the metal vent cover and pried it loose from the floor, and was instantly hit with the source of the stench that was far greater than that of myself, and that of the surrounding room. Reeling and gagging, trying to keep conscious amidst the the whole ordeal, I leaned in to the open vent to try and investigate what the fuck was happening. I puked in my mouth and had to eat it as I got closer to the opening on account of how ferocious the stench was. I noticed a small blood trail leading down into the depths of my basement where the guts of the HVAC resided. This was decidedly not good.

I had to investigate this, I just had to. It was too pressing of an issue to ignore, and what with my wife not being present, I couldn’t let my apprehensiveness get the better of me. Rising unsteadily to my feet, I very slowly made my way out of the horror of the bathroom, and through my dim house until I happened upon the door to my basement. Summoning courage, I threw open the door and made my way down the stairs, taking extra care to not bash my head on the low-hanging joists of the ceiling. My house was built over a hundred years ago, so “basements” like these were never really meant to serve any purpose other than storage. Tack on modern plumbing, air units, and enough band equipment and efforts to run electric to choke a blue whale, this place was uneven and cramped, borderline inhospitable. Unfortunately, I knew where I should start looking for the source of the rotten smell I had discovered upstairs: the only air vent in the basement, on the other side of the room. Flipping a switch at the bottom of the stairs, I turned on a light that was so sickly and pitifully helpful that I might as well have used a flashlight. The state of the room was comparable to the upstairs. My guitars, every one of them, were smashed and lay about the room in uneven shards and splinters. My amplifiers had their speakers crudely punctured, the cabinets of them being torn at. It made me panic, these objects were important to me, my last bastion of comfort and hope, and here they all lay, destroyed somehow.

I picked my way across the small room, scraping my dirty legs and hands on the carnage around me until I arrived at the air vent. Aside from the awful stench that was overpowering at this point, I could more acutely tell that something was amiss, that this was where the problem lie, because as I tried to claw past my cloudy and forgetful fog, I listened as closely as I could muster and realized the entire air system was off. I remembered distinctly that it was always loud, I knew it was! Here it was however, silent. The whole house, my entire life at the moment was silent. I removed the air vent cover, and finally discovered the source of the stench, of the dread I had been feeling ever since I walked into the bathroom earlier. It was the grey cat, body mangled, virtually unrecognizable, stuffed forcefully into the small space. It was as if someone thought the creature was clay, attempted to mould it into a piece of wicked art, and became angered at the organic resistance the material was offering, frustratingly throwing it away by unforgivingly mashing it into a compact space. Immediately after realizing what I was looking at, I backpedaled and tripped over the neck of a destroyed guitar and fell awkwardly into the still-standing cymbals of my drum set, making an awful and abrupt break to the silence. For the third time that day, I began to heave, all over myself until I couldn’t offer anything more. I began to sob.

Why had any of this happened? Why can I not remember anything about it? And where was my wife? Why isn’t she here to help? I heaved and sobbed until my body ached and my vocal cords ruptured. I fell asleep on top of my ruined drums and awoke sometime during the night. I tried not to glance at the angularly fashioned corpse of the grey cat penetrating through the air vent, but I could not help but do so irregularly. After some time, I discovered something else amidst the pile of rubble and discarded music equipment. A guitar I inherited for my 21st birthday, the one that had inspired me to play, was laying a few feet from me, broken like the rest of the shit avalanching around it. Threaded between the remaining strings, I found a note. It was from my wife, addressed to me, written in the middle of November of this year. It read as follows:

“Dear Chris,

I have nothing but contempt and anger for you as I write this, and I cannot believe that I mustered enough motivation to do so, but you don’t deserve to go on as if nothing has happened. You deserve nothing more than to remember.

I never held your behavior against you until recently, I understood that you considered your work ethic and hobbies to be of the most importance to you. Ever since you quit your job, your outlook and demeanor had changed completely. You just became so sour and hard to be around. Everything I fucking said, you met with conflict and unfairness! Every day it was like arguing with a child, a child who couldn’t stop drinking and moping. I tried to give you the benefit of the doubt, even when you broke down and cried and begged to me, even when you said you’d try harder. And then you destroyed everything…

I watched as you took the cat, our sweet grey boy, and broke his legs one by one. I watched as you tried to squeeze him into a ball, the tiniest of balls, like you thought he was some sort of fucking neutron star. I screamed and fought and was struck so hard that you broke my fucking nose. I lay on the floor and sobbed as you stomped that precious cat with all your might as deep into that air vent as it would go.

Bullshit to you not being able to remember this, fuck you to your drinking, and fuck your life and all these stupid fucking guitars that you smashed and threw around in all your little tantrums. I hope that when you find this, everything comes rushing back to you and you sit there forever in your hate and live in it.”

There wasn’t even a closing to it. It ended just like that, and as soon as it did, I actually did remember…I remembered everything. I remembered every fifth I had downed nightly, every tantrum, every argument. I remembered killing our sweet cat without a thought, I remembered striking my wife without hesitation. I could even recall the moment she left, and how I sat still on the couch, only moving to ingest more liquor and rotten meat. At that point, I just let the paper flutter to the ground, seeing it rest on a pile of trash and debris, falling into place like everything else had around it. Why did any of this happen? Maybe it was just something that was preordained, something I didn’t have control of. Jobs come and go, who gives a shit. What warrants this depravity and laziness, what warrants murdering your cat, harming your partner, and giving up on life?

I saw a half empty bottle of bottom shelf whiskey sitting perfectly upright on the floor right next to me, and downed it until I passed out, deciding none of that really even mattered.",1,1767070214.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,2,1.0,False

The damp atmosphere slowly sinks into Elias as he wanders the cramped aisles of the flower shop. Near the counter he hears a woman in her sixties chatting incessantly. She happily goes on  about her granddaughter, who recently came back to town after a stint in the big city. Her powdery perfume lingers around the store and makes it even harder for Elias to ignore her presence. His charcoal ensemble tightens around his chest as he inhales lingering mildew and what might be a vintage Chanel. He spends nearly half an hour scanning the limited selection the store offers, unsure what kind or colour would be right for the occasion. Each option seems perfect for an instant then becomes idiotic the next. Underneath his stiff posture, he can't clear  the lump that has built in his throat. He selects an arrangement and joins the line still only composed of the woman. As the minutes stretch waiting to pay, his entire body becomes taut, crushing the stem of the lilies he is gripping. When his turn finally comes to pay, he briskly hands the bored teenager two twenty dollar bills, and hustles towards the door. He faces the winter chill but the biting cold can’t seem to put out the flames that spread within him. A warm flush rises from his collar and his quickening breaths vaporize into the evening air. He scurries away from the florist and towards the chapel. 



Although he drifts along the same streets he once had, what hits Elias the most is that through all the new that has sprouted he can only see the old. He pauses in front of the old diner where he sometimes ate, it now stands empty and neglected. He picks up the pace after a moment but two streets over he discovers a new coffee shop has opened and gathers a significant crowd. The patrons inside are sitting comfortably around a table and sipping on a drink while bantering amicably. He observes them through the window for a moment before a breeze sends a shiver down his body reminding him he is in fact outside. In a few years when the cafe becomes desolate, the old diner will be torn down to make room for a new future relic. This realization makes his stomach churn  and he once again takes off. As if he stood too long he might start to rot like the diner had. 



He hurries to  the heavy front doors, avoiding the few people lingering outside the church. Despite the events bringing them together they wear a polite smile and don’t seem to notice Elias. A mob of black clad bodies greets him as he steps into the vestibule and he instinctively shields his chest with the bouquet. Everyone around him wears the same empty kindness and Elias halts in his steps. He bites down the urge to run away like he had so many years ago and scampers to the bathroom. The crowd doesn’t spare him a glance. Could they not hear the weight of his heart as he stomped through the quiet chapel ? Once the door closes behind him he locks it with trembling hands and lets out a long breath. The yellow neon lights bring him back to his body and he begins to count the dirty tiles that compose the floor. The 26th tile ruptures the dam that filled his soul and a heavy flow of tears pours. 



He spends long minutes on that floor letting his grief fall to the rhythm of his pounding heart. The sound of an organ thaws his mind and he dusts himself off and wipes his eyes with his dark sleeve. He methodically splashes his face in the sink and looks up to the dimly lit mirror. Elias reaches up to his hair while staring at his reflection. Although the man in the mirror stands tall and protected by his tailored jacket, the man in the bathroom is nearly bursting from the inside with emotion. Elias undoes a button of his jacket and turns away from the mirror towards the exit. He slowly walks the few meters that separate him from the rest of the chapel and unlocks the door, his steps punctuated by measured breaths. He stands still for a moment, his hand resting on the lock and he puts an ear to the door. Through the wood and chipped paint, the dark notes filling the chapel settle his mind and he travels to his youth. 



\*



The priest stands tall  in front of the room. Bowed heads sprout from the wooden benches and Elias is smiling. Rory sits besides him and listens to his own heart while the rest of the parish listens to the sermon. Elias’s hand grazes the grooves of the worn bench until it reaches Rory’s trousers. Although they are too short and show a section of Rory’s shin, Elias finds them beautiful. He travels along the length of Rory’s thigh and traces along the circles of fading dye that make the pants shift from black to dark blue, matching the bruises lying beneath. His hand settles on Rory’s knee and he peeks at Rory. A narrow smile matching his blooms on Rory’s face and this is when Elias knows he made it home again. They stay for the next hour sitting next to each other, listening to the choir and sharing occasional glances. His hand leaves the other’s leg only when the crowd stands. As he puts on his jacket he conceals his smiles and heads to the narrow stairs near the entrance of the chapel. He quietly nods at some people along the way and finds Rory waiting for him in the cramped basement. The parish uses this room as  storage and a thick layer of dust sits on the discarded items. Their bodies meet and dust rises as they knock into objects scattered along their path. The air becomes thick with debris and the lingering incense. When they finally separate, they gather their clothes sprawled on the floor and Elias leaves without sparing a glance.

1pz8oz4,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_lifeXDna/comments/1pz8oz4/methylation_your_health_and_why_the_five_gene/,"Methylation, Your Health and why the five gene approach is so 2024 - By Life X DNA® Australia's leading methylation experts","If you’ve spent any time around biohacking, functional health, or “DNA optimisation” content, you’ve probably seen the **five-gene methylation approach** everywhere.

You know the one:  
**MTHFR + COMT + MTRR + BHMT + CBS**  
…and then a supplement protocol that looks like it came off a conveyor belt.

It’s neat. It’s digestible. It’s easy to market.

But here’s the uncomfortable truth:

# Methylation is not five genes.

And treating it like it is… is a bit like trying to fix a car by checking only the tyres.



# Why methylation actually matters

Methylation is basically a *master system* in the body. It influences things like:

* Detoxification (especially neurotransmitter and hormone breakdown)
* Histamine clearance
* Neurotransmitters (dopamine, serotonin, adrenaline)
* Energy production (via mitochondrial support and nutrient conversion)
* Inflammation and oxidative stress
* DNA repair and healthy ageing
* Homocysteine balance and cardiovascular risk

So yes, it matters.

But it’s also **complex**, and overly simple models often create overly confident protocols.



# What’s wrong with the “five gene” approach?

The biggest issue isn’t that those genes are irrelevant.

They *are* relevant.

The issue is that focusing on only those five genes:

# 1) Misses the full pathway context

Methylation is a *network* of interconnected cycles, not a straight line.

If you only look at a handful of genes, you’re missing entire sections of the pathway that determine how methyl donors are used, recycled, or wasted.

# 2) Leads to one-size-fits-all supplement advice

This is where a lot of people run into trouble.

Everyone gets told to jump straight into:

* methylfolate
* methyl B12
* methylated B-complex
* TMG
* “detox” support

But without context, some people get:

* anxiety
* insomnia
* headaches
* agitation
* histamine flare-ups
* “wired but tired”
* mood swings

Then they’re told they’re “detoxing”.

Sometimes they are. Often they’re just **over-methylating, under-supporting cofactors, or pushing pathways that were never assessed properly**.

# 3) It ignores cofactor needs and rate-limiting steps

Methylation isn’t just about methyl donors. It’s about the *enzymes* running smoothly.

If the system lacks:

* riboflavin (B2)
* P5P (B6)
* magnesium
* zinc
* choline
* glycine
* glutathione support …then “more methyl donors” can actually backfire.

# 4) It overlooks the downstream effects

You can’t talk methylation properly without considering:

* transsulfuration (glutathione production)
* neurotransmitter breakdown pathways
* estrogen metabolism
* methyl group demand (stress, inflammation, toxin exposure)
* gut function and nutrient absorption

Five genes will never capture that.



# The reality: methylation is a full system

If you want a methylation protocol that actually works, you need a bigger picture view.

A meaningful analysis should cover:

* folate cycle genes (multiple)
* methionine cycle genes (multiple)
* transsulfuration genes (multiple)
* cofactor requirements
* methyl donor tolerance
* neurotransmitter and detox demands

The goal isn’t to label someone “good” or “bad” at methylation.

The goal is to understand:  
✅ **where the bottlenecks are**  
✅ **what your body is likely to struggle with**  
✅ **what supports actually make a difference**



# The better way to think about methylation

Instead of asking:  
“Do I have MTHFR?”

Ask:  
**“What does my full methylation network look like and what does it mean for me?”**

Because most people don’t fail methylation because of one gene.

They struggle because:

* multiple small weaknesses add up,
* cofactors aren’t supported,
* and supplement protocols are applied without nuance.



# Final thought

The five gene approach was a useful entry point.

But it’s also outdated.

**Real methylation optimisation is systems biology.**  
And in 2025, we can absolutely do better than five genes and a generic protocol.

If you’ve tried methylation supplements and felt worse, you’re not “broken”.  
You probably just didn’t get the full picture.

Keen to hear others’ experiences with methylation protocols. Did you thrive… or did it make you feel like you’d had 4 coffees and zero sleep?

I apologize for the length, I think context is important in this case. Also, throwaway account since I am paranoid. 

So, Christmas just finished for my family and my sister visited for the holiday. I am early 20s, I still live with our mom due to some medical issues but am actively trying to secure a new job so that I can move out, and my sister is a few years older. We have a complicated relationship, to say the least. We both had medical issues growing up, hers were more severe and visible which led to our mom being much more focused on her wellbeing while I got left behind. As a result I did not get any sort of diagnosis until I was an adult. Safe to say, there is definitely some insecurity and resentment on both sides. 

The biggest issue, is that when she comes home she just takes. Anything she sees and wants, she takes. To a certain extent, I understand. But I couldn’t care less about household supplies, food and all that. Where I do draw the line is my own stuff. It is a problem we have had our whole lives. I just don’t like when someone takes something that belongs to me. To summarize, this was the issue: I would have something, she would take it, I would get frustrated I can’t find it, I go and see she has it, I get upset and tell her she has to ask, she lies and said she did, I get annoyed at being lied to and call it out, she screams at me and calls me names, nothing ever changes. 

It’s gotten to a point where I just hide anything important. I don’t have much room though, so eventually it happens again. This year, I let it go when she did it. I tried to just ignore it and be happy for the holiday. However, I found that she was using a special coffee mix that I was trying to save. It was my favorite and it was discontinued so I had one set left. She had opened it earlier this year and I had asked our mom if she could talk to her about it (because me talking to her never works) I thought she did but yesterday I noticed that she had taken 4 more in 2 days. I said fuck it, I actually started with apologizing for not telling her, but explained that I was saving them because they were discontinued. She looked me dead in the eye and said she understood and wouldn’t. 

Well this morning I went to make my coffee and unsurprisingly, she took another. I now have 2 left, out of the 10. I haven’t even had one yet. I tried to talk to our mom about it, but she just started yelling and saying she wasn’t going to shame her for taking food, that I always assume the worst of my sister, that she is sure she didn’t mean to, that she was probably not listening when I talked to her, that I was cold and disrespectful all week (because I didn’t give her the front car seat she didn’t ask for or mention she wanted until after we were moving🙄) My dad and stepmom support me, they agree that she is disrespectful when it comes to me, but they don’t want to get in the middle which is fair. All of this to say, is it too far to draw a line in the sand here? I want to text her, tell her this wasn’t okay, and if she responds how I think she will then I will tell her all my stuff is off limits (something I have wanted to do for a while but our mom said I wasn’t allowed to because I can’t “boss her around in her own home”)

Am I overreacting for being this upset over coffee? And would it be wrong of me to basically take back all my stuff (which would be the only coffee machine in the house) over this?? Please let me know. Thank you all for listening. ",1,1767069505.0,AmIOverreacting,2,1.0,False
1pz8nr2,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1pz8nr2/my_story/,My story,"This is not fiction. The details you will read are true from my childhood. Couldn't decide where to post this so, here. It is a story after all.

I come from a broken family. My memories are fragged so that I can't remember how things happened in order. My mother whom I love to this day, (R.I.P.) was a woman with many phycological issues. Name one... yup that's her. She used to drag me from wherever I was in the house to the kitchen window, which did afford a great view over the cemetery I grew up next to. Awesome view of the sky. She'd insist on showing me the UFO's she was seeing. Sometimes it was planes on a clear night. Other times, just stars. She would sometimes be sitting having her coffee in the kitchen, and then she'd scream at the voices to shut the fuck up. (Her words). She would fight with Nanny (Her mother, my grandmother) Physically. I was not 10 years old at this point. They had a fight as I was having lunch one day in the kitchen. Mommy started hitting Nanny and with a mouthful of hotdog, I jumped ump to try and stop them. I launched onto my Mom's back and tried to hit her in the face to make her stop.

I was unsuccessful. Mom got an arm around me and threw me into the wall. I fell down and was choking on my lunch at this point. They both came to my aid. Maybe I did stop that fight huh?

This is where it gets scary for me. I've mentioned that my chronology is skewed. But there is one very specific event that is burned into my brain, and it happened when I was only 18 months old. I've heard stories from family members. Nanny was a consummate liar to me as a child in the belief that she was protecting me. I spent a good part of my childhood and early teen years figuring out the shit she spun into my head. Another story she told me was that once upon a time I had fallen off of the couch onto a Tonka truck (Which I did not have at that time, I didn't get a Tonka truck until I was like 6) I was taken to the hospital because I needed just one stitch one my head. I was a good boy

In my memory I remember being in Mommy's black falcon which had a red interior. Yeah like 65 or so. How the fuck do I remember that? I did ride in it after. The black with red interior, it somehow made an impression on me. But ANYWAYS... We were headed to the hospital. I remember seeing the el train as we headed to the hospital. It wasn't far once we turn left underneath.

I was sitting on someone's lap. They had their hand on my head, pressing I seem to remember. Mommy was driving. There was warmth on my head and on my shoulders.

Here's my shit. I think Mommy had a psychotic break. She tried to kill me. She threw me into the radiator and cracked my skull wide the fuck open, is what I think happened. I could give more details about where the ""Tonka truck"" was in relationship to said radiator, but. that would take way too fucking long.

Yay! Now I'm left with wondering if the herniated disk in my lumbar which was irritated by a traffic accident I've had recently is related to that skull fuck and many other maladies I suffered as a kid. Sure sounds like it fits. There is so much more... ",3,1767069498.0,story,5,1.0,False

1. **Specialized Infrastructure:** Do we have enough ""wet lab"" style spaces for hardware? Most coworking spaces in Austin are built for laptops, not soldering stations and test tracks.
2. **The ""Hardware VC"" Gap:** Most Austin investors still have a ""SaaS mindset."" Do we need more local funds that specialize in capital intensive robotics?
3. **Talent Retention:** We have UT Austin pumping out world class researchers, but are we doing enough to keep them here instead of losing them to the coast?
4. **Real-World Testing:** Texas has the space and the ""regulatory friendliness."" Should we be pushing for more ""robot friendly"" zones in the city for testing deliveries, drones, or construction bots?

I’ve been texting daily with a friend that also had VSG several years ago with the same surgeon. We’ve been discussing what I can eat and drink and I told her tonight I grabbed an applesauce (1.5 days early). She said it was fine because I probably couldn’t eat more than 3 bites anyway. I said, “Oh no. I finished off an entire container of yogurt 2 days ago.” She made it seem like that was a HUGE deal and I didn’t want to stretch my pouch. 

The surgeon is so hyper focused on getting in the protein that I haven’t even been considering how many ounces I should “be able” to eat/drink. I do know today I drank an entire shake a little quicker than usual and was miserably full for over an hour. I also haven’t drank as much water as I’d like because I hate feeling full and bloated. 

Here’s a rundown of the past few days. All of my shakes are 11.5 oz. 

Day 1 - only allowed water & ice chips

Day 2 - .5 shake at each meal (total 1.5 shakes)

Day 3 - .5 shake breakfast & 1 shake each for lunch and dinner (total 2.5 shakes)

Day 4 - breakfast was 8oz coffee & sugar free creamer, shake for brunch, the “huge” 5.3oz cup of yogurt for dinner, and then another shake hours later 

Day 5 - 1 full shake at each meal (total 3 shakes)

Day 6 - breakfast was 8oz coffee & sugar free creamer, 1 shake each for lunch & dinner, then a late snack of 3.9 oz cinnamon applesauce (no sugar added)

I’ve not eaten over 500 calories a day. My highest protein was 80g on days 4 & 5. I honestly thought I was doing pretty good so far. Thoughts?

i didn’t wake up wanting to build a budgeting app. i actually tried pretty hard *not* to.

i went through most of the popular ones first. monarch, ynab, mint, etc. a big issue for me was that a lot of these apps rely heavily on bank linking, which just isn’t properly supported in the philippines. so right away, half the “magic” features didn’t really work for my situation.

i also used money lover for a long time. honestly, it’s solid. simple, easy to use, and way less overwhelming than most apps. but over time i realized i still wasn’t sticking with it. manual entry every time added friction, and i kept wishing i could just scan receipts and have the tracking done for me.

even setting that aside, most budgeting apps felt extremely feature-heavy. tons of rules, dashboards, forecasts, and setup steps before you even log your first expense. every time i tried to get serious, i’d spend an hour configuring things, then slowly stop using it. you just get lost in the sauce before anything actually helps.

i’m a product designer, and i realized the real problem for me wasn’t lack of knowledge. it was friction. i didn’t need more charts or systems. i needed something i wouldn’t quit after two weeks.

so i built [**cashmonki.app**](http://cashmonki.app) .

[demo of receipt scanning and receipt roasting \(lol\) ](https://reddit.com/link/1pz8eg6/video/at29b6oiq9ag1/player)

it’s not revolutionary. it’s a simple budgeting and expense tracking app built around things i actually wanted:

* manual-first tracking, no bank connections
* receipt scanning so you don’t type everything
* auto-calculated budgets, like a daily coffee budget rolling up to monthly and yearly
* a light “roast your receipt” feature that pokes fun at spending and weirdly makes you pay attention instead of avoiding it

delightful ux matters a lot to me. if something feels annoying or confusing, i just change it. i built it mainly to solve my own problem, and i use it daily.

right now i’m figuring out distribution like everyone else. testing tiktok ugc, reddit commenting, and thinking about paid ads later once i actually understand what messaging works.

sharing this here mostly to learn. if you’ve built a side project, especially something boring-but-useful, i’d love to hear:

* how you got your first real users

It’s been fine for years but today she managed to trip a 20A breaker. Turns out she put both on an extension cord and the extension cord actually sacrificed itself and died. No other damage.

Is there a 15A extension cord that support dynamic load management (as in shut off other 5-15 port when load gets to 1800w)? She really likes those appliance close by and there is only one 20A line there. Almost impossible to run another line there. ",1,1767068709.0,AskElectricians,3,1.0,False

And the worst part is, I’m ecstatic about the lost weight. I’m 5’ 2 and was 135 now I’m down to 128. But I have barley eaten (once a day max) for the past week, and had coffee to try to loose even more. My body feels really weak and sore. I just need someone to talk to, but I don’t want to burden anyone. I feel really numb.",1,1767068678.0,mentalhealth,1,1.0,False

Alright, lab’s humming. What are we poking tonight—something broken, something subtle, or something everyone else insists is “fine”?

Signal check: stable.
Translation: we can safely open a messy system without it biting back. Choose the knot; I’ll map the tension.

Whiteboard’s clean. Coffee’s dangerous.
If it’s mechanical, I’ll strip it to parts. If it’s human, I’ll make a procedure that doesn’t insult reality.

Good. No declarations. Just curiosity with guardrails.

Then we’re in the right mode.

I enjoy good food, exploring new places, and those moments where you forget to check your phone because the company is better. 

I'm 100% single, and prefer you to be also single. I value emotional maturity (with immaturity that has a time and place) clear communication, and mutual effort. I'm not here for games or endless chatting (although it can be a part of it) I'm here to see if two people enjoy each other's presence in real life.

If you're open to something intentional but relaxed, let's connect, maybe even meet for a coffee and see if we vibe.

If you like bikes, that would be sweet too, but not a requirement",1,1767068543.0,R4R30Plus,0,1.0,False

I got a 2 pack of screen protectors (i applied one before setting it up), and i accidently hit it in a pool during our vacation (so yeah, a bit of a crack) but overall it works fine.
