One such offering that never goes out of style is slush drinks. Slushies, or ""Slush Puppie"" drinks, are a refreshing and delicious treat loved by people of all ages, making them an ideal product for a variety of businesses, from convenience stores and fast food chains to coffee shops and amusement parks.

If you are considering adding slush drinks to your menu, one of the most important pieces of equipment you’ll need is a **commercial slush puppie machine**. This machine will allow you to serve smooth, consistent, and refreshing slushies that will keep your customers coming back for more. In this guide, we’ll explore the benefits of investing in a commercial slush puppie machine, the key features to look for when choosing the best model, and how it can help you boost profits and customer satisfaction.

**Why Slush Drinks Are So Popular**

Slush drinks are not only delicious but also versatile. They are the perfect option for people looking for a refreshing, cold treat, especially during hot weather. Slushies appeal to a broad audience, from kids to adults, and can be customized to fit a wide range of tastes. Whether your customers prefer fruity, tangy, or sweet flavors, slushies can cater to their preferences and offer something fun and unique.

**Universal Appeal**

The appeal of slushies goes beyond their taste. Their visual appeal, vibrant colors, and refreshing textures make them irresistible. When customers see a display of swirling, brightly colored slush drinks, it’s hard for them to resist. Moreover, slushies can be enjoyed any time of year, whether on a scorching summer day or as a festive treat during the holiday season.

**High Margin Product**

Slush drinks are also a high-margin product. With minimal ingredient costs and a relatively simple preparation process, slushies offer businesses a profitable opportunity. The commercial slush puppie machine can create large quantities of slush drinks at once, allowing for easy scaling of production during busy times. This makes slushies an attractive addition to any store looking to increase their revenue.

**Versatility in Flavor**

One of the standout features of slush drinks is the wide variety of flavors you can offer. From traditional favorites like cherry, grape, and lemon to tropical flavors like mango, pineapple, and coconut, there’s a flavor to suit every taste. Offering customizable flavor combinations gives customers the chance to create their perfect slushie, adding a personal touch to their experience. This level of customization makes slushies even more appealing and can encourage customers to return to try different flavor combinations.

**How a Commercial Slush Puppie Machine Can Benefit Your Business**

A **commercial slush puppie machine** isn’t just a tool for making slush drinks; it’s an investment that can have a significant impact on your store’s bottom line. Let’s dive into the key benefits of adding a slush machine to your business.

**1. Increased Revenue Opportunities**

One of the primary reasons businesses invest in a commercial slush puppie machine is the potential for increased revenue. Slush drinks are a low-cost, high-margin product, meaning the profit you make from each slushie is significant compared to the cost of ingredients. With a commercial slush puppie machine, you can produce large quantities of slushies quickly and efficiently, allowing you to serve more customers during peak hours.

Additionally, offering a variety of slushie flavors and combinations gives customers more options, increasing the likelihood of impulse purchases. The machine’s ability to produce slush drinks in large volumes allows you to meet demand without increasing labor costs, making it an efficient and cost-effective way to grow your sales.

**2. Enhanced Customer Experience**

Customers today are looking for more than just a product; they are seeking a memorable experience. Offering slush drinks made with a **commercial slush puppie machine** can elevate your customer experience. The visual appeal of the machine and the vibrant colors of the slush drinks can captivate customers, creating a fun, interactive experience.

Moreover, slushies are often seen as a treat or indulgence, which adds an element of excitement for customers. Whether they are grabbing a quick slushie on a hot day or treating themselves to something sweet, the enjoyment of having a refreshing drink can lead to positive word-of-mouth marketing and customer loyalty.

**3. Low Operational Costs**

Slush machines are designed to be energy-efficient and easy to maintain. A **commercial slush puppie machine** requires minimal labor, allowing your staff to focus on other aspects of the business. The machine automates the process of creating slush drinks, reducing the need for manual labor and making the process quicker and more efficient.

Additionally, slush machines are designed for high-volume production, meaning that the machine can serve large quantities of drinks in a short period, reducing wait times and improving service speed. This can lead to a more streamlined operation and an increase in customer satisfaction.

**4. Customizable Drink Options**

With a commercial slush puppie machine, you can offer a wide variety of flavors, ensuring that there is something for everyone. Customers can choose from classic flavors like strawberry and grape or more exotic options such as tropical fruit blends. Many machines also allow you to mix flavors, creating custom combinations that add an element of creativity and fun to the experience.

By offering customizable drink options, you can increase customer satisfaction, as people enjoy having control over their choices. You could also consider offering limited-time or seasonal flavors, encouraging customers to try something new and return for future purchases.

**Key Features to Look for in a Commercial Slush Puppie Machine**

When choosing the best **commercial slush puppie machine** for your business, there are several important factors to consider. The right machine will depend on your specific needs, including the size of your store, the volume of slushies you expect to sell, and your budget. Here are the key features to keep in mind when selecting a slush machine:

**1. Capacity and Output**

Consider how much slush you expect to sell on a daily basis. Larger establishments may need a machine with a higher output capacity to meet customer demand during busy hours. Some machines can hold multiple flavors at once, allowing for greater versatility and faster service. On the other hand, smaller businesses may only require a single-tank machine that can make smaller batches of slush.

**2. Durability and Build Quality**

Commercial slush machines are heavy-duty equipment, and you need a machine that can withstand constant use. Look for a **commercial slush puppie machine** that is made from durable materials, such as stainless steel, which is resistant to rust and corrosion. A well-built machine will last longer, reduce maintenance costs, and provide consistent performance over time.

**3. Ease of Use and Maintenance**

You want a machine that’s simple to operate and easy to clean. Most commercial slush puppie machines have user-friendly controls that allow you to adjust the mix and freezing time. Additionally, cleaning and maintaining the machine should be straightforward to ensure that it continues to function efficiently. Some machines come with self-cleaning features, making the process even more convenient.

**4. Energy Efficiency**

Running a commercial slush machine can consume a significant amount of energy, especially during peak hours. Look for models that are energy-efficient, which will help reduce your operating costs. Machines with energy-saving settings, such as automatic shut-off features or temperature control, can help lower electricity usage while maintaining performance.

**5. Size and Footprint**

Consider the amount of space available in your establishment. Slush machines can vary in size, so it’s important to choose one that fits comfortably within your kitchen or service area. Keep in mind that larger machines with multiple tanks may take up more space, so ensure you have enough room to accommodate the equipment without cluttering your workspace.

**How a Commercial Slush Puppie Machine Can Help You Stand Out from the Competition**

The foodservice industry is highly competitive, with many businesses offering similar products. To succeed, you need to find ways to differentiate your brand and offer something unique. A **commercial slush puppie machine** can help you do just that.

**1. Creating a Signature Drink**

By offering unique and custom flavor combinations, you can create a signature slush drink that sets your store apart from others. Customers love trying new things, and having a special drink that’s only available at your store can generate buzz and attract repeat business. You could even consider naming your signature drink after your brand, giving it a personal touch that customers will remember.

**2. Seasonal and Limited-Time Offers**

Seasonal flavors are another great way to keep customers excited and engaged. A **commercial slush puppie machine** gives you the flexibility to offer limited-time flavors that tie into holidays, seasons, or local events. For example, you could offer a pumpkin spice slush in the fall, or a watermelon slush during the summer. These exclusive offerings create urgency and encourage customers to return before the flavor disappears.

**3. Promotions and Discounts**

Offering promotions such as “Buy One, Get One Free” or discounts on slush drinks can also help increase sales. By bundling slushies with other items on your menu, you can encourage customers to purchase more while enjoying their favorite slush flavor. You can also use slush drinks as an upsell, enticing customers to add a slushie to their order for just a few extra dollars.

**Conclusion**

Investing in a **commercial slush puppie machine** can be a highly rewarding decision for your business. Not only does it offer a fun and refreshing product that appeals to a broad range of customers, but it can also boost your profits, improve operational efficiency, and enhance the overall customer experience. Whether you run a café, convenience store, fast food restaurant, or amusement park, slush drinks are a versatile and profitable addition to your menu.

By selecting the right machine, offering customizable flavor options, and utilizing seasonal promotions, you can leverage the power of slush drinks to stand out from the competition and keep customers coming back for more. So, why wait? It’s time to invest in a commercial slush puppie machine and start serving refreshing drinks that will keep your customers satisfied and your business thriving.",1,1733558600.0,u_erepresent,0,1.0,False
1h8ntg8,https://i.redd.it/za1lx8jnvd5e1.jpeg,Gift Idea Help,"My husband has recently discovered that while he might hate coffee, he loves tea. Specifically, he loves this citrus black tea that he goes through multiple cartons of in a month. At this point now that it’s cold he basically drinks that more than water! 

Anyway, I had the idea to buy him a variety of loose leaf teas to expand his tea interest, and start introducing new teas he might like just as much if not more. I made a google form with a bunch of relatively common tea flavor notes I found just off a quick google search and had him complete it to get a sense of what he might like (side note: I also filled it with a bunch of throwaway ingredients and it still has him confused as to what this could remotely be for). I also want to buy a bunch of fillable disposable empty tea bags that he can use to steep the tea without having to dirty a metal steeper (he has adhd and I feel this would be easier on him)

To get to the point: any recommendations for loose leaf teas or a way I can gift him a variety? Also, any recommendations for a (cheap) electric kettle with temperature controls? Any suggestions helps!",1,1733558567.0,tea,1,1.0,False

I’m not going to go to the ER because they always run the same tests, get the same results, and refer me back to the GI. (Results are intestinal, rectal, and colon inflammation and rectal fistula) okay so about my poop now. I was having severe diarrhea, straight liquid shits and with the rectal trauma it was what I thought was the most unbearable bowel movements of my life. However, lately I found out I was extremely wrong. My body switched back into constipation mode and I went from shitting 10 times a day (or more no lie) to going a full day or two without a single bowel movement. I was hurting severely. Wanna add that even when I struggle with bouts of constipation, my excrements are normally very small due to the inflammation within my digestive track, this I’ve been used to. Well as of tonight I just passed the LARGEST shit I’ve seen humanly possible. It was the most disgusting smelling and looking shit I’ve ever seen passed by a living organism.

I wanted to share my experience exploring Los Angeles and help those planning to visit this amazing city. I've lived here for several years and discovered some incredible spots that tourists often miss.

First off, forget what you've heard about LA being just Hollywood and beaches. There's so much more to discover! I've found that the best way to experience LA is to mix popular attractions with local hidden gems.

Let me break it down for you:

The Must-See Spots:
- Venice Beach & Santa Monica Pier (the sunset here is unreal)
- Griffith Observatory (best city views, especially at night)
- The Getty Center (free admission, killer architecture)
- Universal Studios (worth every penny if you're into movies)

But here's where it gets interesting - the spots most tourists don't know about:

Local Favorites:
- Grand Central Market (amazing food scene)
- Echo Park Lake (perfect for picnics)
- Huntington Gardens (peaceful escape from city chaos)
- Arts District (killer street art and coffee shops)

If you're planning a trip to Los Angeles, I highly recommend checking out https://athometouch.com/losangeles. They've got some awesome guided tours that'll show you both the famous spots and hidden gems. I used them recently and discovered places I didn't even know existed after years of living here!

Food scene? Don't get me started! Skip the tourist traps and try:
- Koreatown's late-night BBQ spots
- Taco trucks in Highland Park
- Little Tokyo's ramen shops
- Downtown's rooftop restaurants

Nature lovers, you'll be surprised! LA isn't all concrete:
- Runyon Canyon (classic LA hike)
- Topanga State Park (feels miles away from the city)
- El Matador Beach (way better than Venice)
- Angeles National Forest (great escape)

Pro tips from a local:
1. Don't try to do everything in one day
2. Traffic is real - plan around rush hours
3. Public transport is better than you think
4. Always carry sunscreen

For the best experience and to save time planning, check out the curated experiences at https://athometouch.com/losangeles. They've got everything from food tours to hiking adventures.

Remember, Los Angeles is huge and diverse - it's impossible to see everything in one trip. Take your time, mix touristy stuff with local experiences, and you'll fall in love with this city just like I did.

Looking back there was a real lack of boundaries with teachers and students at my school. Most of my favourite teachers I called by their first name, some teachers would DNM with me during class rather than actually teaching any of us. One male teacher would let some female students sit in his car at lunch and wear his jumpers.. he even felt comfortable enough to come and collect keys/jumpers from students while they were in other teachers classes.

When I was at school, I was super friendly with Sally. If her necklace was out of place I would go over and adjust it for her. I’d give her compliments if she tried a new lipstick or dyed her hair a different colour. I’d rock up to class 20 minutes late with a coffee for her, knowing she wouldn’t mind if I were late if she got a coffee out of it. Towards the end of my last year at school, we would message on Facebook messenger. I’d sign off all my emails to her “from your fave”. I didn’t find her attractive until we actually started sleeping together, 3.5 yrs after I met her, but I always treated her like I would my peers.

I never felt she did anything inappropriate towards me, however my friends would make comments that she looked at me funny or that her eyes lingered too long + looking back at exchanges from when I was at school, anything inappropriate I said or did was not remotely shut down.

Straight after I finished school we kept in touch on Facebook/messenger and we soon after shared numbers and would have the occasional 2hr late night phone call. We started hanging out in person rarely and then more frequently. Eventually I got the feels and one night we slept together.

A year into our relationship I found out from another girl in my year (let’s call her Abby) that she matched with Sally on a dating app and they spoke for a bit. This gave me an icky feeling at the time and I asked Sally afterwards if she was as attracted to me while I was in school but didn’t tell her why I was asking or what Abby had told me. Sally said of course not and even though I still had a gross feeling about it, I put it out of my mind.

We were together for 6 years and had a very toxic, up and down relationship. I won’t get into all the details but there was always a power imbalance and she has a lot of childhood trauma which has resulted in internalised homophobia and controlling/manipulation behaviour.

Anyway, I left the relationship over a year ago now and I’m in a happy and healthy relationship but keep finding myself triggered with any new situation, expecting my current gf to behave like my ex. I keep having flashbacks and nightmares. And being the age now that Sally was when we started sleeping together, I just can’t imagine me being with a 19 yr old who looks at me with such admiration and awe as ok. I guess I keep wondering if I as groomed and if I should reach out to ask if she was attracted to me while I was her student. Advice and opinions welcome",1,1733557748.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

(Not saying that Arguments can't have valid points, but I've talked to some ENTPs who argue for argument's sake and try not to understand the point even though it's clear like a calm and clear lake in broad daylight)

2. Let's say you're in an argument/debate... do you like to conclude as fast as possible with a valid and common viewpoint (Even though it's from the other person) (also yes, your viewpoint is completely heard and considered) or just go on arguing until like... idk you get the point hopefully :D

3. What do you mean by a deep conversation?

4. What qualities do you like to find in ideal partners? (People have their own preferences, I know. But as a whole what do you love to find in an ideal partner)

5. Is it possible for you to enjoy Se and unpredictability? (It is a cognitive function, check this out if you don't know about it - [What is Extraverted Sensing? | True You Journal](https://www.truity.com/blog/what-extraverted-sensing#:~:text=Extraverted%20Sensing%20(Se)%20occurs%20when,people%2C%20culture%2C%20and%20nature.)) (Cognitive functions is sort of a complex topic so if you don't know about it already, I'd advice you to understand what it is first... and if you have a better recommendation for the Se explanation site, please feel free to share! I'd add it in this question too if possible)

6. Would you enjoy a partner who can be a bit pushy sometimes, but mostly ""for your own good""?

7. Which is an ideal setting for you:  
I) A quiet conversation and discussion in front of a fireplace on a big comfy chair with books and a hot         cup of tea/coffee/hot chocolate?   
  
   II) Any chaos that an ENFP might ensue? (Does mature ENFPs do it though?)

8. Do you like a partner who always pushes \*their own limits\* and always wants to grow (with you too)?

9. How would you like someone to come and (1) introduce themselves and (2) talk to you for the first time? (I am being serious here; I am totally not asking this question for help which I may or may not need later... No seriously!)

well, i decided to start out i was going to dirty fast because i love cream in my coffee too much and it would help me ease into it, then i would try to go to black coffee. i read a lot about people still seeing some results that way, as long as you’re in a calorie deficit which i have been. 

i know it’s only been a little over a month, but i thought i would have at least dropped some water weight, at least a couple pounds. but no - i haven’t seen any progress physically nor on the scale, which is pretty discouraging... and i get discouraged and give up very easily. so, i decided to start fasting clean a couple days ago and i’ve been going strong so far. 

i feel like i wasted the past month, but it was still a journey nonetheless i suppose. just needed to get it off my mind because i am frustrated, lol. this sub is so helpful for motivation though, so at least there’s that! :) ",1,1733557208.0,intermittentfasting,1,0.67,False

Eisha- she'll be devastated after this considering the fact that after the interview session she had complety lost it she was seen crying after realising how she's looking outside,her whole game was around targetting kv(makers gave her the plot) she lived like this in the house for 60 days thinking I am miss right there is nothing that I can do wrong,so what I feel is that she'll loose the plot cuz she has nothing else to do, now she can't make peace with kv neither continue to fight with him she'll go into a shell for the remaining weeks basically form lead to side role.conclusion ""eisha is neutralised for good"" 

Avinash- He won't give up that easy he is here for the win he's smart he'll try to cut eisha off and focus on the game ,either solo or with Vivian we can even expect clashes between the trio as they were very secure until now cuz everything was going their way their organic bond will be tested.He'll continue to fight with kv-dv If needed and that too unapologetically. He's about to get mad. Conclusion- he's a ticking time bomb now 

Vivian- He'll now realise that he got played by the makers to side with chugli gang he'll try to get out of the trio and give his opinion more openly and will try to make a few more rishtas.His confidence will break completely cuz until now he thought it's him who's running the show people would be mad about him outside but after this he'll remember each and everything that he said or did to kv and will try to reflect how it would have come across to the viewers.
Conclusion- you won't see any drastic changes in him he's too rigid to do that he'll continue to drink his coffee and smoke but he'll be more careful.

Rajat- now that he's been warned about abusing and getting physical he'll try to play mind games and make more samikarans but he'll remain frustrated cuz he won't be able to play openly this will lead to anger eventually he can also be thrown out of the house too.He sided with chugli gang thinking that they are running the show and have complete chances of winning (he said this in his interview) he never considered kv as a threat.
Conclusion- Rajat lost most of his plot it would be interesting to see how he'll handle things.

I 31F have been struggling in a relationship with my 30M boyfriend. He is a nice guy in the traditional sense and I can see he puts a lot of effort into doing things to make me happy like grabbing my favorite coffee or making reservations for date nights. My parents have met him and really like him and says he’s very polite and nice which makes me feel like it’s a me issue.

My issue is that he lacks any ambition. He has a low paying job that he kind of just fell into. So yes, he isn’t unemployed or a loser in that sense but he has absolutely no hobbies or interests except video games. I’m the one who needs to suggest activities or points of conversation or we would just sit at home all day. When I text to see what he is up to he is always at home and seems to consider basic chores as activities which just feels a little boring to hear day in day out. 

Also he is a huge mamas boy and was coddled his entire life and I see this becoming an issue if we were to get married and have children. I feel that I’d become the mom to him and he wouldn’t fully step into the father role for our kids.

I guess what I’m asking here is whether or not I should break off a relationship over something like ambition and hobbies when he is a “very nice” guy… I’ve dated very emotionally unavailable guys in the past so not sure if this more a me issue…

I didn't especially liked, in a human sense, Michael's character. I liked the interactions between him and other characters, but I would never want to be around him. Yet at the end of S6 and through the s7 I geniuenly started to like him. 

I think it's the peak of his character - he stayed goofy, but gained responsibility and matured. His decision about breaking up with Donna, his speech about supporting everyone in office with Ryan's start up, how he didn't really insult Holly's boyfriend during the Christmas party. Additionaly, other characters start to actually like him and kind of respect him, instead of constant embarassment. Like when he beat up his nephew, or when he had a coffee with Oscar. 

It was heartwarming, to see those changes, considering how he used to be, and how other people treated him. And I'm very sad that he left, because comparing to the lenght of the show, it was a short part of it.

But the second double, nothing came out. I checked the water, made sure everything was clear, I tried again three times and each time nothing came out.

The only think I can think of is that because the beans were so cold moisture condensed on them which affected the grind or the extraction somehow (the weather is damp today). The same grinder settings as always produced the same weight of grounds in the basket and the same volume when tamped.

I was able to get a drink by putting the beans in a bowl and warming and airing slightly. Has anyone else had this problem?

Life... Life is certainly really indifferent and unfeeling when it comes to us, these bodies devoid of a womb but full of emotions. It doesn’t matter how skilled you are in the arts of intimacy, how affectionate or loving you are, or how honest you can be—you will always end up hurt. You limit things because of the wounds inflicted by those who came before, hoping they won’t be repeated. Yet, you return to that place, that pit where only your sorrows remain. Feeling insufficient, like a mere scrap, discarded by what you once longed for above all else.

It’s curious—the relationship between a loved one's ability to make you soar through the heavens and simultaneously destroy you completely. And what’s left is even worse: the feeling of emptiness, uselessness, and more. Is that why I’m not loved? Is that what prevents me from feeling loved? Do I truly have to become a despicable wretch, ignoring everything, for it to work? Do I not deserve to be heard? Can’t I hope for a hug, a kiss, a question, an honest answer? Is that my sin?

What is my sin? Not holding back what I feel or think to avoid uncertainties? Refusing to be mysterious so you don’t have to chase the unknown? Caring so much about what you feel—or don’t feel? Valuing what we have above all else?

Life itself has no meaning, but with her, I question less if it has one. How hard can it be to accept that quieting this incessant doubt within me, that lives there all the time, is reason enough to move mountains and continents just to be with her every day? To wake up beside her, look at her, and wonder: what is it about her that makes this farce, this fallacy, this garbage seem more coherent?

I love my life. I love my parents,  my siblings, but none of them have achieved even a fraction of what she has. They’ve all always been there, but I want her never to want to leave. I refuse, I resist, I hold back from throwing it all away, just because maybe—just maybe—there’s a glimmer of hope. But the flame dims little by little.

And then, what’s left? The insecurities? The doubts? The things left unsaid? The things left undone? The things we took for granted? None of that gives you a hug on a cold morning, kisses your forehead, hands you coffee, and says, “It’s all going to be okay.”

What for? What’s the need? Why destroy something so hard to build? Is it that you don’t want it? Is it that it’s not worth it? That it’s not enough? That it doesn’t fulfill you? None of this—none of this—makes sense to me.

I live with purpose, with desire, with passion, and all the compasses point north. Now tell me, how do I make it so you’re not just in the way? How do I make it so you’re there at the end?

1. Way too busy, a lot of people have more energy than you do and you're like WTF? After a while coffee wasn't working, I'd have two of them throughout the day and still. 

2. Waking up at 5am to start at 7am sucks, there's no way I can convince my mind that 9pm-11pm the night before is bedtime, it's challenging because if I'm off the next day, I'm staying up until like 2am and waking up 11am/12pm the next day. Sometimes my body feels ""sickly"" (?) waking up at 5am, in the sense that my allergies are going bonkers (sneezing, itchy nose/eyes, dryness) and a sense of mild water retention.

3. I also found myself eating a lot more because I was exerting myself more, if I didn't get something in my belly before clocking in, i'd feel miserable but then by 10am I NEED ""Breakfast #2"". 

4. Being in-charge on days sucks (usually once a month on average for me). In addition to doing your normal nursing tasks, you have to do two assignments (7am and 3pm), you have to fill out the report for every patient, you have to give two reports (one to the doctors, etc. and one to the 7pm nurses).

With that said. I've been on days (7a-7:30p) since I started in Spring 2023. By the end of that summer, I felt like I wanted to do nights because of feeling sorta burnt out by the morning routine. There was no nights open on my unit, so I ended up being tempted/lured by another hospital for night shift. I regrettably fell for it and left to go there. Long story short, it was a very very toxic place to work so I went back to my old hospital/day shift job within 90 days time. So i've been back now since Spring 2024 on days. 

A guy on night shift left in the summer, I asked if I could have it, the rest is history. I have now been on nights for 1 month. I like that its less busy, the time goes by fast after 11pm, and being in charge on nights isn't as bad (1 assignment, 1 report). All was fine up until this past week. I've been feeling a bit more tired than usual. If I come off from working a shift, I sleep from 9am-3pm, if I don't work again that night I go to bed 2am and wake up 12pm the next day. 

Admittedly, I've also been reading a bit too much into google/word of mouth about the potential health problems associated with nights. I think I'm starting to regret this but I don't know if i'm jumping the gun. Part of me has thought about asking my manager if i could switch back to days but I don't know if I'm thinking straight about this or maybe i'm not used to it? They already filled my day spot with a new nurse, but maybe they have another day opening they haven't filled? It's a 26 bed unit with 9 day RNs.

==============================

Bad breath, also known as halitosis, can be a pesky problem that plagues many people at some point in their lives. Imagine charming your friends with your wit and humor, only for them to recoil at the faint scent of something less than fresh when you speak. It’s enough to make anyone feel self-conscious! While there are numerous products available that promise to eliminate bad breath, it’s worth exploring a more commonly found household item: hydrogen peroxide. In this article, we’ll dive deep into whether peroxide can actually cure bad breath and the science behind it.

Understanding Bad Breath: What Causes It?
-----------------------------------------

Before we get into the nitty-gritty of hydrogen peroxide, let’s take a moment to tackle what really causes bad breath. You might be surprised to learn that bad breath isn't always just about poor oral hygiene; several factors contribute to that unwelcome odor.

### The Usual Suspects:

1. **Poor Oral Hygiene**: This is the biggie. If your brushing and flossing game isn’t up to snuff, food particles can linger in your mouth, leading to bacterial growth.
2. **Foods and Beverages**: Certain foods, like garlic and onions, have a reputation for leaving a strong aftertaste—and smell! Conversely, beverages like coffee can also contribute to bad breath.
3. **Dry Mouth**: Saliva is nature's way of cleansing your mouth. A dry mouth, often caused by medications or sleep disorders, can leave your breath feeling less-than-fresh.
4. **Underlying Health Issues**: Sometimes bad breath could indicate more serious health problems, such as sinus infections or gastrointestinal issues.
5. **Tobacco Products**: Smoking not only contributes to bad breath but can also damage your gums and make it harder for your mouth to fight off odor-causing bacteria.

Understanding these causes helps contextualize our main focus: can hydrogen peroxide tackle this somewhat unpleasant issue?

What is Hydrogen Peroxide?
--------------------------

Hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) is a clear liquid most commonly recognized as a disinfectant. It’s often found in medicine cabinets, used for everything from cleaning cuts to whitening clothes. But what happens when you introduce this substance into oral care?

### The Science Behind Hydrogen Peroxide

When hydrogen peroxide breaks down, it releases oxygen. This release creates a bubbling action that can help eliminate debris and bacteria, making it effective in fighting germs that contribute to bad breath. It’s a bit like sending in an army of little soldiers to clear out the bad guys, if you will! But, does this mean it’s reliable for folks dealing with halitosis?

### Can Peroxide Cure Bad Breath?

Many people wonder, “Does peroxide cure bad breath?” It’s a thought-provoking question because while hydrogen peroxide can kill bacteria, it may not address all the underlying causes of bad breath. Whether or not it’s a cure depends on various factors. Let’s unpack that.

#### The Role of Antimicrobial Properties

- **Bacteria Elimination**: One of the primary ways hydrogen peroxide can help is through its antimicrobial properties. Using a diluted solution can potentially reduce the number of bacteria in your mouth. Fewer bacteria generally mean fresher breath.
- **Staining Prevention**: Hydrogen peroxide can also assist in whitening teeth. Healthy, white teeth can help create a more pleasant aesthetic experience when you smile, taking the focus away from any mild odors.

### The Right Way to Use Hydrogen Peroxide

If you opt to use hydrogen peroxide for bad breath, it's essential to do it correctly to avoid potential pitfalls. Here’s how to use it safely:

1. **Dilute It**: Always ensure you're using a solution that’s 3% or lower for oral care. Mix equal parts hydrogen peroxide with water for safe usage.
2. **Swish and Spit**: Swish the diluted solution around your mouth for about 30 seconds before spitting it out. Make sure not to swallow it!
3. **Frequency**: Limit hydrogen peroxide rinses to once or twice a week. Overuse can cause irritation of your gums and mucous membranes.
4. **Follow Up With Water**: After rinsing with hydrogen peroxide, rinse your mouth with plain water to ensure no residue remains.

By following these steps, you can effectively incorporate hydrogen peroxide into your oral care routine, but remember, it’s not a magic bullet for chronic bad breath.

Other Effective Remedies for Bad Breath
---------------------------------------

While hydrogen peroxide has its merits, it’s not the only tool in your toolkit for banishing bad breath. Here are some other strategies worth considering:

### 1. Maintain Good Oral Hygiene

- **Brush Twice Daily**: Use fluoride toothpaste to keep your pearly whites and gums in tip-top condition.
- **Floss Daily**: Don’t skip between the teeth where food and bacteria like to hide.
- **Clean Your Tongue**: Bacteria love to party on your tongue, so use a tongue scraper or brush for a thorough cleaning.

### 2. Stay Hydrated

Drink plenty of water throughout the day. Staying hydrated helps prevent dry mouth, a common culprit of unpleasant odors. Aim for at least eight glasses of water daily, and perhaps carry a water bottle with you to sip throughout the day.

### 3. Mind Your Diet

Avoid strong-smelling foods like garlic and onions. If those are staples in your diet, consider minimizing their intake before social events. Also, crunchy fruits and vegetables, like apples and carrots, can help clean your teeth naturally.

### 4. Chew Sugarless Gum

One of the simple tricks to freshen your breath is chewing sugar-free gum. Not only does it stimulate saliva production, but it also offers a burst of flavor that can mask odors temporarily.

### 5. Regular Dental Checkups

Never underestimate the importance of visiting your dentist regularly. They can catch issues early, provide professional cleanings, and give personalized advice tailored to your specific needs.

The Caveats of Using Hydrogen Peroxide
--------------------------------------

Though hydrogen peroxide might offer some benefits, it’s important to consider the drawbacks.

### Potential Risks

- **Gum Irritation**: Some people might find that hydrogen peroxide irritates their gums.
- **Taste Issues**: The taste of hydrogen peroxide may not be pleasant for everyone.
- **Not a Long-Term Solution**: It may combat bacteria but doesn’t address problems like dry mouth or dietary influences.

Remember: While peroxide can be a helpful adjunct in your quest for fresh breath, it shouldn’t replace routine dental care or other preventive measures.

A Word on Other Household Solutions
-----------------------------------

You might wonder about other household items that could double as oral remedies.

### Baking Soda

Baking soda is another versatile ingredient. It acts as a natural deodorizer. Rinsing with a baking soda solution can neutralize odors and whiten teeth.

### Vinegar

Apple cider vinegar, while pungent, is believed to help reduce bad breath. Dilute it with water—just don’t go overboard as the acidity can harm your teeth if used excessively.

### Essential Oils

Some essential oils, like peppermint or tea tree oil, boast antibacterial properties as well. Just make sure they’re food-grade if you plan to use them along with your oral regimen!

Conclusion: Making Choices for Fresh Breath
-------------------------------------------

So, does peroxide cure bad breath? While hydrogen peroxide may help eliminate some bacterial culprits and freshen your breath temporarily, it’s not a one-size-fits-all miracle solution. Good oral hygiene, regular dental visits, hydration, a balanced diet, and effective home remedies are all critical components in the battle against bad breath.

Incorporating hydrogen peroxide into your routine can be beneficial, but remember to proceed with caution and moderation. By mixing traditional methods with innovative approaches, you can keep bad breath at bay and enjoy the confidence that comes with a fresh smile.

I moved to a new city 3.5 months ago and joined a girls book club that has been super fun and enjoyable. I’ve met several really nice girls and I felt like I’ve connected with 2 really well. Let’s call them Abby and Mandy. The three of us have hung out at our meetings and had dinner twice, and also met up with a larger group once. Abby visited me at my coffee shop job today which was really sweet but then posted hanging out with Mandy at her house  later that night and it made me feel sad bc I wasn’t invited. I guess I just assumed we were a trio bc I would never just invite only one of them out somewhere.( maybe because they assumed I had work but could be wishful thinking) In general I feel like Abby gets invited to many more hangouts with the book club girls ( non meeting events). I wonder why bc I really try hard to initiate, I’ve been very generous and given small Christmas gifts to them. Mandy got dumped recently by a guy she was talking to and when she told me about it at one of the book club hangouts I bought her a drink. Anyway I know it hasn’t been a long time so hopefully they will still include me in the future but I’m just feeling really down. I’m hosting a Christmas party and I’ve invited some of the book club girls and I feel kind of dumb for putting in so much effort and energy into planning it and making it cute for people who don’t necessarily even want to include me places. Any kind words would be appreciated. Emphasis on kind, I know this sounds so silly and immature but it’s how I feel. Would like to work through it.  

What can I do to feel better about this situation?

- Keep the budget for first few dates under 150 pesos. Do not spend more than a cup of coffee or milk tea on her. Her transportation is her responsibility not yours. Jeepneys cost around 13 pesos regular and 15 pesos air conditioned per ride. NO FOOD ON THE FIRST 3 dates.

- If you wanna feed her, take her back to your place and cook. That way you have a better chance of getting laid.

- If she matches you on a dating app and messages you a ❤️ first, that’s your signal that’s she’s ready to have sex on the first date.

- Do not empathize with her whatever she tells you even if it’s true. Remember you’re still dating and should not even bother listening to any problem she has. Quickly shut her down and block her. Separate emotion from logic when making decisions with women here.

- ALWAYS have a couple of different girls on standby in case she decides to leave you or start acting rowdy and rebellious. Remind her that she is always replaceable and keep her in check. Do not get too attached to her. She was living her whole life fine without you and no so were you.

- Do settle initially with an average looking girlfriend who is nice and won’t take advantage of you until you can upgrade to a better looking one. Remember you NEVER GO ON A DATE DESPERATE OR SEXUALLY FRUSTRATED.

- If she is white skinned and overweight she probably is financially stable.

- A lot of them will lie and tell you it’s their birthday. Don’t fall for it, remember she is not your girlfriend.

- Light skinned ones are generally financially well off than dark skinned ones.

- NEVER MARRY HER. LIVE WITH HER, HAVE KIDS START A FAMILY, BUT FOR THE LOVE KF GOD DO NOT SIGN THAT GOD DAMN PIECE OF PAPER.

- Never let her dominate you or wear the pants. 

- Never let her stay in your apartment until after you’ve know her for at least a year.

- Never hesitate to kick her out if she disrespects you. HER TEARS MEAN NOTHING. AGAIN GUYS LOGIC OVER EMOTIONAL.

- Do not feel bad about doing all these things. Remind yourself that you’re in the position of power since you hold the cash. Remember, they will not give you a second look if they had the cash themselves. Quid pro Quo. 

- Either man up or get burned and dominated like the countless victims you see on a daily basis. It’s rough out here and you can never allow yourself to slip.

Their colorful, swirling concoctions not only look refreshing, but they also trigger cravings. Customers are often more likely to impulse-buy when they see a visually appealing product.

**How a Commercial Slush Puppie Machine Can Benefit Your Store**

Investing in a **commercial slush puppie machine** offers more than just a product to sell; it offers a full range of business benefits. Here are some of the most significant advantages:

**1. Increased Revenue and Profitability**

One of the biggest reasons businesses invest in a commercial slush puppie machine is the boost in revenue. Slushies are high-margin products. The cost to produce them is minimal compared to the retail price. A well-stocked machine, especially during peak seasons, can generate substantial revenue with a relatively low investment in ingredients and labor.

Since a slushie is made primarily from syrup and ice, the cost per serving is remarkably low. You’re essentially paying for the syrup and the water used to freeze it, which keeps your expenses low. Given the wide range of markup you can charge for slush drinks, this translates directly into higher profit margins.

**2. Streamlined Operations**

The **commercial slush puppie machine** is designed to make your life easier. Slush machines are simple to operate and, once set up, require minimal maintenance. This means that your staff can focus on other tasks, such as customer service and food preparation, while the machine handles the slush-making process. The machine’s automation eliminates the need for manual labor, improving efficiency and saving time.

Moreover, most commercial slush machines are built to be user-friendly, ensuring that your staff can quickly learn how to operate them without extensive training. This level of convenience enhances your overall store operations, making it easier to scale up your business without significantly increasing labor costs.

**3. Customizable Offerings for Every Taste**

One of the best features of a commercial slush puppie machine is its ability to create a wide variety of flavors and combinations. With multiple flavor options available, customers can create their perfect slushie by mixing and matching different flavors. This high level of customization makes slushies more exciting, giving customers the ability to experiment and discover new combinations that suit their tastes.

For instance, you could offer tropical flavors like mango, pineapple, and coconut or more classic flavors such as cherry, blueberry, and grape. Seasonal flavors or limited-time offers can further enhance your menu and encourage repeat business. The flexibility to offer custom flavor options is a significant selling point that attracts a broad customer base.

**4. Enhanced Customer Experience**

When customers walk into your store, they are not just looking for a product—they are looking for an experience. Slushies provide just that. From the moment a customer sees the brightly colored slushes swirling in the machine to the excitement of choosing their own flavors, slushies offer a sense of fun and engagement that many other drinks lack.

**Interactive Ordering Experience**

The customizable nature of slushies also creates an interactive experience for customers. People enjoy the act of choosing their own flavors, mixing them to their liking, and creating something unique. This engagement not only keeps customers entertained but also enhances their overall satisfaction with your store.

Moreover, if you’re offering slushies at a kiosk or self-serve station, customers will appreciate the convenience and autonomy of serving themselves. This can speed up the ordering process, reduce wait times, and give customers more control over their purchase.

**Visual Appeal and Impulse Purchases**

As mentioned earlier, the colorful swirls of slush drinks are visually striking. The vibrant shades of different flavors entice customers, even if they didn’t come in planning to buy a slushie. The visual display can trigger cravings and lead to impulse purchases. When you have a commercial slush puppie machine in your store, you’re creating a visual focal point that draws customers in and encourages them to make a purchase.

**Key Features to Look for in a Commercial Slush Puppie Machine**

When considering a **commercial slush puppie machine** for your store, it’s important to choose one that meets the needs of your business. Not all machines are created equal, so here are some features to consider before making your investment:

**1. Capacity and Output**

Think about the volume of slushies your store is likely to sell on a daily basis. A larger machine with multiple tanks will be necessary for high-volume businesses, such as fast food chains, convenience stores, and amusement parks. On the other hand, smaller stores may only need a machine with a single tank.

**2. Durability and Build Quality**

Since the slush machine will be in constant use, it’s important to select a machine made from durable materials that can withstand heavy use. Machines with stainless steel components are generally more durable and easier to clean. They are also resistant to rust and corrosion, making them ideal for long-term use in a busy environment.

**3. Ease of Maintenance**

A commercial slush puppie machine is an investment, and you’ll want it to last for many years. Look for a machine that is easy to clean and maintain. Some machines come with self-cleaning features that simplify the process and save you time. Regular maintenance is necessary to ensure the machine operates efficiently, but choosing a model that is easy to maintain can help you avoid costly repairs in the future.

**4. Energy Efficiency**

Since slush machines run continuously, energy consumption can be a concern. Look for energy-efficient models that help keep operational costs low. Machines with automatic temperature control or energy-saving settings are ideal for keeping electricity bills manageable.

**Marketing Your Slush Offerings**

Once you’ve added a **commercial slush puppie machine** to your store, it’s important to promote it effectively to maximize its impact. Here are a few ideas for marketing your slush drinks:

**1. Seasonal Promotions**

Use the changing seasons to promote different slush flavors. For example, offer tropical flavors during the summer, or winter-inspired options during the colder months. Running limited-time offers will create a sense of urgency and encourage customers to try something new.

**2. Social Media Campaigns**

Social media is a powerful marketing tool. Share mouthwatering photos of your slushies on your store’s Instagram or Facebook page to entice followers. Consider offering discounts or promotional codes to your social media followers to increase engagement and sales.

**3. Loyalty Programs**

Encourage repeat business by offering a loyalty program. For example, for every 10 slushes a customer buys, they could earn a free one. Loyalty programs help build a stronger relationship with your customers and increase the likelihood that they will return to your store.

**Conclusion**

Investing in a **commercial slush puppie machine** is more than just adding another product to your menu; it’s an investment in your store’s future. The numerous benefits—ranging from increased revenue and enhanced customer satisfaction to improved operational efficiency—make it a wise choice for any business. By offering slush drinks, you can create a memorable experience for your customers, attract a wider audience, and increase your bottom line.

Whether you own a small café, a convenience store, or a large-scale restaurant, a commercial slush puppie machine can transform your business by giving you an edge over the competition. From its ease of use and high-profit margins to the fun and interactive experience it provides, adding a slush machine to your store is one of the smartest decisions you can make.",1,1733554468.0,u_erepresent,0,1.0,False

1h8msbv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h8msbv,[Acne] What the hell is going on with my face ,"
For backround info, I’ve had acne since I was about 12. I’ve taken all antibiotics on the market, took accutane once (came back a year later), and took accutane a second time at a higher dose but it never fully cleared after 8 months. 2 months after accutane I started breaking out but I had it under control somehow. 

As for diet I’ve *tried* quitting dairy, and I eat meat and minimal junk food. I also eat sugar but not as much as an average person would (no sodas, candy etc). Just your average half spoon of sugar in coffee etc. 

Topicals don’t get me started. Adapalene worked beautifully for me in the past with antibiotics. Cleared me right up. 6 months later I relapsed and it stopped working. I tried tretinoin, didn’t work. I’m currently on adapalene again with little to no results after months of use. Benzoyl peroxide wash worked for me, but left me with chemical burns on my skin (if you can see the big red circle on my cheek I’ve had that for 3 years and no doctor is helping me heal it). 

I’ve used azelaic acid 20%, does absolutely nothing for my acne or PIH/PIE. I’ve tried using glycolic acid but I feel it’s too strong. Tea tree doesn’t work either. 

I know with my current routine my skin barrier is a little damaged which is why I’m so red and irritated right now. But maybe 3 weeks ago, I started getting the worst breakouts before I started all my actives, so I know my products are not solely the reason (i quit the glycolic acid toner). I also use the Nuderma high frequency wand every other day in hopes for something to work. 

 Here’s my current routine:

(AM)
-LRP toleriane cleanser for oily skin 
-Cerave daily moisturizer 
-LRP anthelios spf/beauty of Joseon spf
-every now and then azelaic acid for my PIE

(PM)
-Oil cleanse with olive oil if I have makeup on
-LRP toleriane cleanser for oily skin 
-Differin every other day 
-Nuderma high freq for days I’m not using differin (every other day but alternated with the differin)
-rose hip oil sometimes 


I know the cerave moisturzer works for me because I’ve used it post accutane my first time and never had a single breakout. I’ve had doctors tell me it’s bacterial acne, and some telling me it’s hormonal. I’m 18F now, oily skin, and at my wits end of what to do. I was thinking of scheduling a blood test to see if it’s a possible vitamin deficiency, and so I can see if my hormones are unbalanced. I’ve heard a lot about spearmint capsules too. 

(I plan on quitting all actives and focusing on my moisture barrier but as I said, the acne persisted even before I damaged my barrier.)

I just want the clear glass skin I once had after accutane 😞 before accutane, I had big angry cystic acne or fat pus filled pustules. I would mainly get the big big pustules and I’m glad I haven’t had those in a while but instead I get smaller pustules and sometimes just straight up red dots that scar my whole face. What could it possibly be and what should I do? Any sort of advice is appreciated I beg ",1,1733554095.0,u_skincareaddict_,0,1.0,False

This is my 7th month at my current job, I work fully remote but did meet everyone in person one week. 

The first person I considered is a very close friend of mine now who has been an extreme help with answering all of my questions, acting as a mentor for me, and she and I talk daily. I spent probably around $200 dollars on her gifts / shipping, but they were all little knick knacks like squishmallows, coffee mugs and a plush from my local airport, and some dog treats / dunkin and squishmallow ornaments.

For my other two co-workers, they are people I work with pretty regularly and we're also helpful during my initial first few months working and on occasion we chat. We aren't ""friends"" per say or close but I thought it would be nice to write a little thank you letter and give them each a $15 star bucks gift card and $20-$25 barnes and noble gift card. 

Would it be too much to spend/ be awkward to send this gift? I kept the thank you notes very simple and less personal. 

Part of me feels awkward because with some debates I've seen it can be weird for a male colleague to gift female colleagues considering all 3 co-workers are women, and while I am a gay dude I just don't want to be part of that problem. If that makes sense. However, they 100% know from the first day that I am very obviously on that side.

I always thought, when your husband asked for food, then and only then was he fed. Idk if you remember, right before the ""highlands"", you lived in one of the weekly furnished apartments. I had just came up to be with you. We got in a fight the night before you started working the highlands. You told me to get the fuck out and so i left.

1h8moyt,https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/1h8moyt/advice_needed_about_my_arrangement/,Advice needed about my arrangement. ,"Hi. 
I (F25) have a platonic SD arrangement (M67). 
We began chatting end of last year/start of this year. Meeting in say feb/april time for walks, lunch, coffee, etc. at the time PPM. Until about 2 months ago, my day job changed and I went back into my login to find another arrangement as my current, he made clear didn’t have too much finances and never discussed exclusive platonic arrangement - why it was PPMeet. 
He contacted me within hours of me re-activating my account askigg n to chat - seemed irate over he phone until I explained about my day job etc. he said he wanted to help and we chatted how this would work (paying my rent and bills over a few months - not far off what he was paying me in meets prior) and how it would work/I kept asking what his expectations are, saying he has none other than what we are currently and hopes for less platonic but no pressure or expectations. I’ve made a point to never ask for money directly other than ppm and what I am happy with. He offers it as a “gift” or to help with something at the time. 
Last month I’ve had family emergency meaning my time has been limited and I’ve only seen him twice, but made a conscious effort to have a few phone calls and ongoing open conversation. He made clear when we talked about this arrangement that he had no expectations and to not feel pressured to see him. Saying he wants to help me because he sees I am worth the money as I am not your usual SB, he sees I work hard and am just going through a tough time and wants to help during this if he can. He’d like the friendship to go further but no pressure - this has been repeated without me bringing this up. I keep my response to this open, “yeah, we’ll see/I have to feel comfortable and feel I don’t know you well enough yet etc etc” as we usually only meet once or twice a month for a few hours and every time, even from when he first brought it up, he said how he does not want me to feel uncomfortable or make me do anything I don’t want to/if it doesn’t go that way he’s happy with the friendship/arrangement we have currently. 

The reason I am writing this all up — we’d planned to meet Monday just gone, he’d messaged in the morning asking if I could do the next day. I explained yes but I’d have to rearrange work/going to see my family member to care for them. Whilst on the phone he brought up that he’d counted how many times we’d met, I said I hadn’t counted but fair enough  and moved on. 
When I saw him, his whole demeanour was off. We gave each other a hug when he first came in, then popped to the toilet. I then realised I had this new smell near me, and couldn’t work out what it was, a musky-sweaty smell. I made us tea and we sat down and caught up as we usually do. But he was agitated in our conversations, mentioning how he usually gets bored/impatient quickly and he’s surprised in himself we are still in our arrangement, I said I was glad he wasn’t fed up and I asked if he was ok with me/us/arrangement and he said yes, but that he’d like to see me a little more, so we made plans to meet next week. Any questions I usually ask he was stand-off ish and stubborn in his responses. When ever the subject of a conversation came to end he’d sit there staring at me with this frown on his face, I’d ask if all was ok and try and move the subject on but the whole interaction it felt he was aggitated with me/angry. I went to show him a few sketches I’d done recently when I realised the smell was coming from him, nearly making me gag. 
Then when he went to leave, went in for a usual hug, I’m in work trousers, jumper and shirt over the top (its winter here) and he pulled my tops up and tried to grab my ass without asking - finishing the hug very quickly after this I gestured him out the door, he then tried to kiss me but I went in for a hug to his chest. He had said when leaving how lovely it was to see me etc etc. 
Once he left, my chair STANK and I don’t just mean a little musk, I mean STANK. Thinking a bit of spray would get it gone, ended up having to strip it all and put it in the wash/scrub the chair. I have never smelt someone that bad in a very long time, not even when I used to work in the homeless andd 3rd sector, I’ve never even noticed him smelling like that, we’ve been sat next door to one another, in a car together etc but never smelt that. 

This is not the first time he has made me feel uncomfortable - the last time he came round for lunch (we rarely meet at mine but if we do it’s usually for 2 hours and no more). When he went to leave he held my face and said how lovely I was and tried to go in for a kiss, i turned it into a hug/face kiss. 

Basically I want to know whether I have the right to explain 
1, he smelt like shit that was actually disgusting and super unhygienic. 
2, if and only IF he want this friendship to be less platonic, then he needs to ask me whether I am comfortable with these things. More than a friend hug, kiss on the cheek etc.
But I have a feeling he’s of the old generation who has said all the right things to appease but actually actions speak different?
3, I have concerns over the fact I am seeing increasing signs of an agitated, impulsive/reactive man, due to previous experiences. As well as when he tells me more about himself, putting stories and things together he has told me and then not all adding quite up. 

Back ground on SD, he runs an outdoor few companies and charitable groups, has a few sons maybe a little younger than me? And supposedly an ex wife, but with the rare times he brings them up, I feel he is still married, kids still live at home and he’s very much still a family man. Now I know SD/SB arrangements there is a lot of discretion etc, but he has willingly told me without prompts all of this information, tells me how’d he’d never want his sons to treat a women badly and never make them uncomfortable etc. I just don’t know where to sit and I feel now he is paying my rent that he feels he’s entitled to all of my time, more often asking what I’m doing with my time etc. 

Asking for honest, no b*llshit responses/advice please. I’ve done this for years and this is a first on this situation, which make me believe if he did have arrangements prior, these ladies by the sounds of things weren’t doing traditional SD/SB arrangements and probably didn’t have as much respect for themselves as I do with the amount he’s willing to pay…

So let’s summarise what each drink could be defined as and why they have sort of become the same thing-

The cappuccino in Italy is a 150-180ml drink with a single espresso as the base and is filled with foamed milk, there is a traditional idea that it is a 1:1:1 ratio of espresso, hot milk and foam but this generally isn’t the case as this would make it a 90ml drink with a single shot and even more modern cappuccinos with a double shot usually have less foam with the popularity of latte art. Overall the cappuccino is known to be foamy the “dry cappuccino” is still popular in some cafes but its difference from the flat white could simply be the shot size (in europe) or the addition of chocolate (Australia/NZ) as the modern cap has a thinner layer of microfoam still ideally more than the flat white but this isn’t always the case in modern cafes. 

The flat white has no solid definition outside of Australia/NZ but it’s agreed upon that it’s a smaller stronger latte around 150-180ml with a double espresso or ristretto as the base topped with steamed textured milk ideally with a minimal amount of microfoam, this clashes with the modern “wet cappuccino” unfortunately one shops flat white is another’s cappuccino and again the cap may have chocolate or a little more foam but not enough to go all hitler and say it’s not a flat white, the invention of this drink apparently was due to people being sick of dry foamy cappuccinos and they just wanted a milky flat coffee.

The latte can be separated by the former drinks as it’s regarded as having a higher ratio of coffee to milk being a 220-500ml beverage, espresso topped with steamed milk and a small amount of foam (atleast 10cm in Australia apparently) but the reason the latte is in the equation is because many cafes, even specialty cafes have all three drinks in different sizes, atleast in takeaway cups. What’s the difference between a large flat white and a same sized whatever sized latte? The amount of foam? It’s surely still a latte though or is it? A large cappuccino could still have a ton of foam and chocolate to differentiate it from the latte but as previously mentioned caps generally have less foam these days so what it has to be a latte topped with chocolate what if the customer doesn’t want chocolate? Dun dun dun. 

Seriously it’s just espresso and milk at the end of the day no one cares at home I’m not trying to start a nerdy argument and get all Karen about it just interested on your own take. What’s what in your opinion?",1,1733553188.0,espresso,5,0.67,False

>>That’s so fucking dumb lmao. I am packing my lunch every day, so do 90%+ of city employees. I’m not contributing shit to downtown economy other than being stuck in an office building for 8 hours
>>>Bitch, my tax dollar are paying you get back to work the pandemic is over. Everyone else is! Vacation is canceled
>>>>I’ve been working 50+ hours a week this whole time - 3 promotions later hybrid working. Been coming downtown this entire time multiple days a week - but what would you know ?
>>>>>Great then going back full time won’t be a huge problem. I’m sure you do work hard it’s just time to stop bellyaching. Everyone will be going back to offices, this is just your time.

.

>[Do your job city worker, go into the office, and deal with the same fucking shit the rest of us are struggling under. See it. Smell it.

>>That’s great. Do you work for the city? I feel like I’m taking crazy pills. People who make decisions about the city NEED to be experiencing the city. Yes, every goddamn day. What the fuck happened in the last 5 years. Jesus Christ
>>>Thank you! Seriously, I swear I’m getting more and more distressed at how defensive people are about all being antisocial shut ins now. And the weirdest part is I don’t think people are even really happy about it. They just don’t want to change.
>>>>This may come as a complete shock to you, but many of us have social lives outside of work. I don’t need to be forced into a room with other people to be social. It blows my damned mind that shit like this gets upvoted. I don’t want to be your friend Kathy, I want to do my fucking job and go home and spend time with my actual family and friends, ideally without sitting in traffic for an hour.
>>>>>I’ve made some of the best friends of my life at work. There’s a lot to be said for these in person connections, especially for younger workers who are just starting out.
>>>>>>Cool, and nobody in favor of remote work has ever said ""You shouldn't be allowed to work in an office"". This is a hybrid setting where people are already working from the office half the time, so that's not even the most relevant part. That's ignoring the fact that your comment is literally ""feelings"" driven, rather than based on any actual data supporting the idea that the in-person connections at work have ""a lot to be said"" about them. Your anecdotes are not data.

>>>>>No one is saying that work in office is to get all your socializing done, but if you hate in person working with a deep passion maybe don’t work for a city government? There’s plenty of jobs that can be done from home, but serving a populace probably isn’t one of them (although there may be exceptions to every rule). It’s giving the same vibe of someone who hates kids and works at a school.
>>>>>>That's an even worse argument than the other person made. You need to go to a government office building or you hate the city? You can't do your job if you don't do it from an office? Do you think working for the government is somehow like the wardrobe in Narnia?
>>>>>>>Yes. Yes, you do. If you make me fucking fill out and file city required paperwork, your ass better be in the office when I have questions about your process.
>>>>>>>>That's what I was really digging for. You're inconvenienced because government inefficiency results in completely unnecessary in-person action, so everyone else should also be inconvenienced. So American! Let's go full boomer and make the IT guy remotely upgrade software from a building in downtown Portland, rather than their house, because [you have] to come in to an office that he could probably just call with questions anyway.

Watch him burn bridges immediately with the very staff he needs to actually make his policy dreams a reality- and then you’ll complain when homelessness is the same as it was 4 years ago and claim it wasn’t Keith’s fault?
>>>>Starts with 1 contract at a time. City needs a culture change. What tasks/accomplishments/initiatives from the previous 4-6 years do you approve of city administrators? Let’s actually see a city that works
>>>>>The city doesn’t even have the office space anymore. They gave up a bunch of leases during covid and are cramming everyone into the Portland Bldg, but it won’t be enough space if everyone comes in on the same day. How much time and tax payer dollars do you want the city to waste finding new office spaces for staff that don’t even need to be there ? I thought we wanted efficient use of city money?
>>>>>>So go get more office space. This isn’t difficult. Crying over mundane issues of running an organization is why voters don’t care. Go to work.

>>>>The city staff has been doing a shitty fucking job the last few years. I hope Wilson shakes shit up. What kind of mandate do you think you have.
>>>>>Sounds just like Elon and Trump!
>>>>>>Nah fuck those guys, but not sure if you realize that when someone says “well I had to call the city about it” for anything now everyone just either bitterly laughs or sneers in disgust.

>>There is a right to work hybrid?
>>>Unions have whatever rights they negotiate
