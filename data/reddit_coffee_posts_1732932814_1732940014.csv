1h347iu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1h347iu/tifu_inadvertently_put_myself_into_sepsis/,TIFU- inadvertently put myself into sepsis,"It was actually yesterday on Thanksgiving of all days. Today I'm feeling better enough to write this. Background story is I live with chronic conditions that make me more sensitive and susceptible to infection. I do my best to stay healthy in 2024. I wear masks at work and avoid crowds if possible. 

I rushed to pack for Thanksgiving and going to stay over at my mom's home. In doing so I took my travel kit with me, still unpacked from our last weekend trip in September. I brushed my teeth before leaving our home and went to bed shortly after reaching mom's home. The next morning I woke up and took the little travel toothbrush from my kit. Normally it would have been sanitized with either alcohol or hydrogen peroxide as I customarily do when I unpack from our trips. I'm supposing I didn't do that this time as this would explain what happened next. I can't remember exactly but I believe the toothbrush stayed unpacked, uncleaned and forgotten for those two months. 

After rinsing it with just water I brushed my teeth at my mom's home with that little travel toothbrush. I will admit I tend to brush hard so that probably didn't help. Within an hour I started to feel oddly nauseous and sick. I thought maybe I was hungry as I hadn't eaten or drunk anything and I usually do right away. My brothers went for a coffee run and brought the family back drinks. I had a matcha latte but still felt odd so my mom gave me some rice to settle my stomach. This helped for a little and I was grateful. I was able to continue helping with getting the Thanksgiving sides ready. 

I got dressed and we started the drive over to my in-laws. The plan was to have Thanksgiving dinner there first and after some hours go back for a later dinner with my mom and family. I started to get sick again on the ride over but I did my best to hydrate and stay calm. 

We started dinner with turkey soup which I love. I was able to finish my plate but with a lot of effort. By the time everyone was getting ready for the second course my heart was racing. My husband recognized this and thought it was the POTS (postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome) so he helped me to a room so that I could lie down. He gave me water and I tried taking some charcoal tabs as this helps when I get POTSie from a food disagreeing wth me. The lying down helped my heart rate a little but then I started to feel nauseous again. 

I went to the bathroom twice and started to feel weak. After some 20 mins of trying to let the flare pass I told my husband I felt really bad and that I think I needed to go to the hospital. I hate going to the ER for POTS. Even though IV fluids help a lot, many in the medical field still treat it as an anxiety disorder and are generally unsympathetic. This time I felt like I could lose consciousness so I gave in. 

I started to deteriorate quickly on the ride. I just remember telling my husband to take me to the nearest ER. Then the rest of the ride was me closing my eyes and struggling to calm my heart rate in order to breathe. I was weak and gasping for air by the time we made it. My husband had to speak because I couldn't alternate breathing with talking at that point. They triaged me as best they could but even getting an EKG was hard because I started to convulse. I couldn't tell if it was from chills or my muscles going rigid. Maybe both.

My arms and legs kept shaking and felt stiff and my hands and feet went icy cold. Like uncomfortably so. My breathing was so sharp that my mouth dried out. My heart got so fast I went into SVT (supraventricular tachycardia). I know I started to cry and ask for help. I closed my eyes because I felt overwhelmed and like I just needed to focus on breathing enough. The rest is foggy. 

My husband says that they kept trying the EKG and that I gripped the gurney tight to stop from shaking but to little improvement. Eventually they hooked me to monitors and used that to tell where my vitals were. They took my temperature which was slightly elevated and put in an IV line. They drew the labs to see what was going on. I don't remember this well. I just remember the sound of the machines going off alarmingly and breathing getting even harder. I told my husband I loved him and that I couldn't do this anymore. 

I think my body started to give up at this point going even colder and weaker. After that I barely felt anything. My husband went to get the nurse because at this point they realized it was sepsis due to my lactate level being at 6.4. For reference, normal is less than 2 and above 4 is definite sepsis. Sepsis is when bacteria or microbes make it into your bloodstream. It kills and quickly. 

My husband got pushy and asked for the antibiotics to be hooked up because it was ordered and he could see it but the nurse was going to and from other rooms. Normally I'm very patient and don't like to bother medical staff but I'm so grateful he did this. He said I was in so much distress.

I don't remember when the antibiotics got hooked up. All I know is I felt this surge of warmth and my heart come down slowly from it's frantic pace. My breathing was shallow but more regular and I started to feel like I could sleep and not just drift into unconsciousness. I felt so tired. I could start to feel how sore my arms, legs, and chest were. But I came back to. I could open my eyes. Mentally I became slightly more alert. I'm so grateful to my husband for getting me there in time and for advocating for me. I'm in the medical field but I was in such a state that I don't want to imagine what would have happened otherwise. 

I'm grateful for the medical staff that was kind, worked quick, and brought me back. The rest of the time was trying to rule out other things and rebalance my electrolytes which were very depleted. I was eventually discharged even though I told them I still felt very off. My sister (a nurse supervisor) told me I should have been kept overnight and observed. 

One of the Drs (resident) kept asking me about any anxiety diagnosis which I reiterated I don't have. He also told my husband that antibiotics don't work that fast. Which left us perplexed because they were IV ones (not oral) and they very quantifiably stabilized me as evidenced by the monitors ceasing their alarmed beeping within a few mins of administration. I felt very weak and shaky and would have preferred to sleep while being observed but I agreed to discharge because I realized that as it was a holiday I would probably be better off at home.

Thankfully I got home and started drinking coconut water and taking probiotics. After some hours I felt less shaky for the first time that day. I slept roughly but I did. I haven't been able to eat much other than some bread and oatmeal. My body feels like it's still in shock. I've been drinking a lot and trying to rest. 

This ended up being much longer than I meant it to be but I feel that writing this is twofold for me: 1) I needed to write it out to process the shock I'm still feeling at having gotten so sick so quick and 2) to serve as a learning experience or psa so that others don't ever go through something like this.

TL;DR- I used an old improperly stored travel toothbrush and went into sepsis. I'm grateful to be alive but still a bit shook.",3,1732939806.0,tifu,0,1.0,False

1h3453z,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAloneDating/comments/1h3453z/22_m4f_wisconsin_looking_for_my_confidant/,22 [M4F] Wisconsin - Looking for my confidant.,"I have a growing gut feeling I‚Äôm near a fork in the road.

I‚Äôm working as a masonry apprentice, I love my job. 
I have hobbies I enjoy, I love simple things like sunrises and sun falls. I exercise and stay healthy.
I should be happy.

All my life I‚Äôve abstained from social interaction, I‚Äôm not awkward, I just never cared. Over the last 2 months I got really familiar with what loneliness is, which is strange because it‚Äôs never been an issue in the past. I‚Äôve been going to coffee shops just to sit in the presence of others. I blend in and I like it that way. 

I‚Äôve done a lot of reflecting on what I‚Äôm missing staring at the ceiling in bed, I despise hook up culture, I hardly experience lust in any capacity. I think I just want someone to go through life with, someone dependable, trustworthy, etc. 
I want to find someone I can ease in love with. I‚Äôm seen as cold by most everyone, maybe going forwards I can be cold to everyone - 1.

All of that being as cliche as it sounds doesn‚Äôt change how it is.

A bit about me:
- Hard working, why redo something when you can nail it the first time.
- I‚Äôm transparent, but I only stick around if I trust you.
- Decently fit, picture link in bio.
- I‚Äôm an early riser (before 5)
- Not into drugs or smoking, I will infrequently drink alcohol on a special occasion.

A bit about you:
- You know what you want in a partner.
- You put effort into yourself and you do it for you. I‚Äôm not talking about going to the gym and only doing squats. IYKYK.
- Whether you lean right or left politically doesn‚Äôt matter to me, as long as you can articulate why you hold the beliefs you do in a calm fashion.

1h344gk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lucanismancers/comments/1h344gk/withdrawal_chapter_5/,Withdrawal Chapter 5,"Full fanfiction on Ao3: [Withdrawal](https://archiveofourown.org/works/60930250)

Note: Hello and welcome back to Withdrawal! It‚Äôs been over a week since I last posted, but I‚Äôve been hard at work on this one. It‚Äôs the longest chapter so far! 

As a reminder this is a Rookanis fanfic that takes place while Rook was trapped in Solas‚Äô Prison and focuses on how Lucanis and Spite cope with her loss. All characters that appear within the lighthouse are based on the decisions I made in my own play-through of Veilguard with my canon Rook who fell for our favorite Crow.  If you haven‚Äôt read the previous chapters, please follow the link above! 

Without further ado, please enjoy chapter 5!
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

As he waited, Lucanis heard the main doors of the kitchen open. He listened carefully to the sounds of two sets of footsteps making their way toward the pantry. He‚Äôd memorized the sounds of each of his companions‚Äô steps while living there. 

It was a sort of pastime taught to fledgings as a means to sharpen their senses.  Good practice for studying potential threats and targets. Of course he was no exception. 

While growing up in the Dellamorte Estate, he and Illario used to play the game as boys. One would listen to the different steps and guess who they belonged to while the other would watch and confirm. Usually their targets were servants, with the occasionally visitor. But their most challenging target to listen for was Caterina. A useful trick for avoiding their grandmother‚Äôs cane when they got into mischief. 

It saddened him to think of the sounds he‚Äôd probably never hear come through the kitchen again. The clang of Neve‚Äôs prosthetic leg, the wooden taps of Harding‚Äôs clogs, and‚Ä¶the fast rhythmic-like steps of Rook‚Äôs leather boots. That woman was always on the go even in the refuge of the lighthouse. Only slowing down for the things she liked. 

The sound of her rushing into the kitchen only to immediately slow down was still clear in his mind. It was as if she was trying to steady herself along with her heart as she would approach the pantry. In an attempt to act casual she would often greet him, but her steps already betrayed her intentions. He couldn‚Äôt help but find it endearing. And though he couldn‚Äôt understand at first why she kept coming to see him (an unwise decision in his opinion), he had to admit that he found pleasure in knowing she was seeking him out. 

His chest tightened as his thoughts drifted to Rook. He‚Äôd been avoiding it as much as possible the past week. He quickly pushed the thoughts out of his mind, and instead forced all his attention toward who had come into the kitchen.

The distinct sound of heavy leather boots stomping on stone was unmistakably Taash. Their heavy steps sounded tense, as if mentally preparing to face an opponent. Meanwhile the much lighter heel clicks that followed sounded much more hesitant in their approach. No doubt they belonged to a nervous Bellara, fidgeting and hovering like a hummingbird.  Without either saying a word, he could tell they weren‚Äôt sure if it would be him or his demon waiting behind the door. 

Taash was the first to enter the room. He observed as the young qunari bowed their head slightly as they came through the door, preventing their horns from hitting the top of the frame. Their muscles still tense against the red knots they wore. Taash scanned him, eyes narrowed the whole time. Once satisfied, they tilted their head back toward the door.

‚ÄúNo purple eyes.‚Äù They called back. ‚ÄúLooks like you‚Äôre clear to do your thing.‚Äù They stepped back slightly to lean against one of the pantry shelves.

Bellara peeked her head inside then gave a bit of a smile. ‚ÄúThanks Taash.‚Äù She said as she walked past them, pulling out her tools. 
‚ÄúSo, how did you- oh!‚Äù She caught sight of the bruising around his wrists.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine.‚Äù He said trying to reassure her. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not nearly as bad as they look.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you say so‚Ä¶‚ÄùShe said as she began taking the restraints off. ‚ÄúDid you at least sleep well?‚Äù 

‚ÄúIt was‚Ä¶good enough.‚Äù He replied while maintaining a level expression, keeping himself from wincing as she clicked off the first restraint. ‚ÄúWhat matters more is that we kept Spite from leaving.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs he trying to go anyway?‚Äù Taash chimed in.

Lucanis was taken a little off guard by the dragon hunters question. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúSpite.‚Äù They continued while straightening their posture to face him. ‚ÄúI thought he cut that shit out a while ago. Now he‚Äôs being a bigger pain in the ass than before. So where‚Äôs he trying to go?‚Äú

Lucanis sighed to himself, and rubbed the back of his neck with his free hand. This wasn‚Äôt something he was expecting to talk about. He wasn‚Äôt even sure if he wanted to. 

‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter where he‚Äôs trying to go.‚Äù There was a slight bitterness forming in his voice. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not going anywhere so long as Solas and El‚Äôgarnan are still breathing. A crow never leaves a contract unfinished.‚Äù He could feel his sore muscles tensing as he spoke. 

‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre back to just ignoring him?‚Äù Taash stepped away from the shelf, their eyes looking down at him.

‚ÄúMierda,‚Äù Lucanis was starting to get irritated. ‚ÄúTaash, why are you asking me these things?‚Äù 

‚ÄúBecause, Lucanis we need to make sure you have your shit together!‚Äù The sound of their raised voice made Bellara flinch. 
Lucanis could see the qunari‚Äôs breathing was agitated, their body trembling slightly before taking a breath. 

‚ÄúYou killed Ghilan‚Äônain last time, I won‚Äôt take that from you.‚Äù They moved closer as they spoke. ‚ÄúBut that was when you and Spite were at your best. And even then we still lost people! Neve‚Äôs who knows where, Rook‚Äôs not here to lead us, and Harding‚Ä¶‚Äù They were towering over him biting their lip before continuing. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre all gone and now we have two gods to deal with. And look at you!‚Äù She gestured at him. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre tired, beat up, and dealing with Spite on top of all that! How do you expect me to believe you can take them down like this?!‚Äù Their eyes met his, searching for answers, for anything that would quiet their doubts. ‚ÄúTell me, because I really need to fucking know.‚Äù Their voice trembled with a mix of anger and desperation. 

‚ÄúTaash‚Ä¶‚Äù His voice nearly faltered. Before he could attempt to answer he heard the final click as the second restraint slipped from his wrist. Bellara quickly got up and stood between them looking up at Taash and meeting their gaze. She placed a hand on the Taash‚Äôs shoulder, or at least as close as she could reach. 

‚ÄúTaash, why don‚Äôt we talk more about this during the meeting later?‚Äù She suggested to the dragon hunter, trying her best to lessen the tension. The young qunari stared down at the elf for a while before finally nodding their head and stepping back. 

‚ÄúFine, but you still owe me an answer.‚Äù They said as they turned their back and left the pantry. Heavy boots stomping on stone followed by the heavy slam of the kitchen doors.

Bellara turned toward Lucanis and sighed. ‚ÄúSorry, you shouldn‚Äôt take that too personally. You know they‚Äôve been through a lot‚Ä¶I mean, we all have‚Ä¶but still‚Ä¶‚Äù she fidgeted as she spoke trying to fill in the silence. ‚ÄúAnyway‚Ä¶we‚Äôll be at the round table in about half an hour or so. But, why don‚Äôt you take your time? Brew some coffee?‚Äù He could tell she was doing all she could to hold it together as she tried her best to smooth things over. ‚ÄúI could make some if you‚Äôd like?‚Äù She asked as walked over to the shelf and reached up for one of the coffee bean jars. Her hand brushing up against one of the nearby jars, shifting it out of place.

‚ÄúNo!‚Äù he said involuntarily, his voice almost unrecognizable with its harshness. He didn‚Äôt know what came over him. He saw her freeze in place, arm still stretched out. He cleared his throat to try again. ‚ÄúNo thank you.‚Äù He corrected with a more even tone. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather do it myself if you don‚Äôt mind.‚Äù 

‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶‚Äù Bellara blinked as her arm lowered. ‚ÄúI guess I‚Äôll be going then.‚Äù the elf backed away from the shelf nearly stumbling into one of the crates. ‚ÄúSee you at the meeting.‚Äù She turned and quickly left the pantry. Quick heel clicks before the door to the kitchen closed. 

The crow listened for a few more moments before he stood up and walked over to the shelf. He picked up the jar that Bellara‚Äôs hand shifted. It wasn‚Äôt filled with the expensive beans he usually picked up from the Treviso night market. 

No, this one was filled with a blend of black and green tea leaves with bits of dried fruit and flowers. Rook‚Äôs favorite tea. She‚Äôd picked it up during one of their grocery runs in the market. It was after she‚Äôd admitted to him that she wasn‚Äôt much of a coffee drinker. 

How anxious she must have felt after all those times he made coffee for her. But the crow couldn‚Äôt help but chuckle. He wanted to act surprised, he really did, but he couldn‚Äôt hold it in. The way Rook‚Äôs cheeks reddened as she demanded to know when he‚Äôd found out wasn‚Äôt helping either. It had been obvious to him from the start. What kind of crow would he be if he couldn‚Äôt read her body language? The way her nose wrinkled at the scent, the silly faces she tried to hide when tasting the bitterness. He was going to tell her she didn‚Äôt need to keep drinking it to impress him, but she was so insistent that she liked it. 

The crow figured she would tell him in her own time. Until then he had taken it as the perfect opportunity to try different blends and enjoy her silly faces a little longer. He had to admit, it was fun seeing her reactions to each one. Taking note of the tastes that seemed to appeal to her and the ones that clearly didn‚Äôt. To no surprise her tastes leaned much more sweeter than his. 

But when he asked if he should stop making coffee for her, it was his turn to be surprised. She leaned in close, her hand brushing against his as she slipped the cup from out of his hand. She then took a sip where his lips had been, savoring the taste. Mierda, how could something so simple make his heart race? It took everything to ignore Spite‚Äôs excitement too as the demon growled in approval the back of his mind. She looked back at him smirking slightly and told him he didn‚Äôt need to worry about stopping. It was an acquired taste now. If she wanted something sweeter, she‚Äôd make it herself. 

With yearning in his heart, Lucanis opened the lid of Rook‚Äôs tea and took in its scent. He was hit with the sweet smells of tropical fruits mixed with the floral tones of hibiscus and roses, mixed in with the slightest hint of cinnamon. The smell of warm sands and freedom. 

Rook had told him once that she wanted to go to a place like that. Where she could feel the warm sand beneath her feet and the sea breeze on her skin. 

The beaches near Minrathous where she grew up were fine, but nothing in comparison to what she‚Äôd seen in Rivain. She hoped someday she would actually get to take her time and relax in a place like that once all the fighting was done. He told her that if she liked the shores of Rivain, she would probably love the beaches along the Antivan Coast. He promised to take her there after their contract was complete. When the two of them would be free to find a relaxing place together along those warm sands and sea breezes. 

It was starting to become too much. The memories overwhelming him as the yearning turned to pain. He closed the lid and shoved the jar back in place on the shelf. He couldn‚Äôt afford to be distracted. He grabbed his coffee beans and left the pantry, determined to focus on the fight.

Intercultural relationship problem - my husband is Eastern European and I‚Äôm British. In my husband‚Äôs culture family never stay in hotels, it would be rude to ask them to. His family are also used to living in smaller spaces (he grew up 2 adults/2 children in a 1 bed).

I feel like in British culture, in the circumstance of having 2 children in a 1 bedroom flat, most family members would understand staying in a hotel (we will happily be paying for this). 

I can‚Äôt imagine having my FIL or MIL (they‚Äôre divorced, won‚Äôt stay together) staying for a week in my lounge when I need to get up at 4am with the baby, or do sleep shifts with husband so we can both rest. 

Also last time FIL stayed, he gave me a bad cold at 8 months pregnant, put the heating on so high (despite being asked not to) that I was uncomfortable and hot the the whole time. He also tried to kiss my son‚Äôs open wound while he (FIL) had a cold sore‚Ä¶ and argued that herpes is genetic and my son would be fine?! 

I feel stressed just thinking about having to get up at 4am, find a bra, whack out google translate (FIL doesn‚Äôt speak or understand English, won‚Äôt use google translate himself), and have to interact all before I‚Äôve had tea/coffee/got dressed. What if I just want to settle baby in Moses basket and fall asleep on the sofa until toddler wakes at 6am?

I‚Äôve seen that it‚Äôs (Espresseleine) not very ‚Äúpopular‚Äù on Reddit..  And I‚Äôve looked through some posts on why people don‚Äôt/ do like them.  I guess I wanted to talk about why I DO like it.  Like some people stated, it does seem like espresso hates madeleine due to the way the interact.  However, I feel like the English translation isn‚Äôt very accurate.  In the KR dub, it doesn‚Äôt really sound like espresso dislikes him.  You‚Äôd think they‚Äôre friends.  I‚Äôm not very fluent in Korean but from what I understand, it sounds more like ‚Äúteasing‚Äù in a way?  Madeleine seems like that one annoying friend you like.  And they‚Äôve both had some pretty major character development because of eachother.  Like I saw someone say, they bring out the best in eachother.  The odyssey was pretty huge for them.  Honestly seeing espresso laugh in such a genuine way was really nice.  And the sort of motivational speech he gave to madeleine was ALSO really nice.  And madeleine cookie who knows espresso so well, describing his features perfectly.  I know most of their interactions out of the game probably aren‚Äôt canon, but it‚Äôs cute.  Definetly take a look at their CN interactions if you‚Äôre interested!  
(*They even held hands in a cn collab!  Though it may have been for the script)
Also IM pretty sure this was in Chinese but it was from a few years ago, but madeleine cookie called them a match made it heaven.  Though he was probably talking about their ‚Äúfriendship‚Äù Espresso also implied he‚Äôs made coffee for madeleine 

English isn‚Äôt my first language I‚Äôm more of a Spanish speaker but if you disagree, feel free to lmk!  I‚Äôd really like to see people‚Äôs thoughts on them.üòÑ",1,1732938902.0,Cookierun,0,1.0,False

We didn‚Äôt necessarily break-up on bad terms - meaning, there was no cheating, abuse, or loss of interest from either of us. I broke up with him because of the mental and physical stress I was suffering from at the time, which was caused by my dad.. 

He just asked how I‚Äôve been doing and wanted to see if I would be down to get coffee together sometime soon. 

Anyways, I‚Äôm not sure how to feel about it‚Ä¶ There‚Äôs no bad feelings from my end. I guess I‚Äôm just shocked that he reached out.  Now, I do want to know what his intentions may be or why he reached out..  I often hear guys just contact their exes to hook-up or something‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm just not sure if that‚Äôs the case here or not‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not quite sure what to think‚Ä¶  But if it is, I definitely should not reply.. 

Here‚Äôs more context to how our relationship went down if you want the details before giving me your opinion: 

Long story short, I broke up with my ex-bf around 2 years ago as a result of multiple reasons. However, the biggest contributor to the break-up was my dad. Back then, I had just turned 21 and I was having a hard time at college, because I was having some major health problems that led to the delay in my graduation‚Ä¶ Also, my health problems started a year after my switched majors in college, which my dad was very unhappy about (switch from a science major in my 3rd year to an arts major). It didn‚Äôt help that my life looked very unstable and uncertain right now.  While this may all sounds like normal problems for a girl in her early 20s, BUT it was nowhere near good enough for my first-generation-immigrant father who wanted me to be a doctor or an engineer. 

So having all these health issues going on WITH an uncertain future AND a boyfriend felt like a total retaliation for my dad, as if I chose to have all these unexpected circumstances happen to me. And this was a big reason why I hid my relationship from him for as long as I possibly could. 

BUT he eventually noticed something was off and found out. And when he found out, he was on a rampage. He would call me randomly and countless times to YELL and/or SCREAM at me to nitpick on every single thing he didn‚Äôt like about my life and my past decisions. And then, he screamed that he refused to see me until I broke up with my ex-bf. So he really said ‚Äúit‚Äôs either him or me.‚Äù 

And yes, I tried to reason with him that it‚Äôs my decision and it‚Äôs my life. BUT NOPE, my dad is not a regular dad, he‚Äôs a narcissist and a hypocrite‚ú® When I told him I‚Äôm not gonna make a decision like this or at this point, he said ‚Äúyou would choose a boy over me?‚Äù Yes, he really made it about him, rather than this being a moment I begin to make my own decisions about my own life. 

The problem was that I was heavily reliant on my dad for financial needs, just as most college students are. Especially with my health issues (brain-related issues) and being a full-time student, it was hard for me to work at all during this time. I was fine not seeing my dad for 4+ months, but he was pressing my sister about this whenever he was with her. And it was getting my sister stressed out because this is all he would talk about whenever she saw him. 

Eventually, it got too much for my physical and mental health. So I ended it with my bf‚Ä¶ He was really upset and I felt terrible. At the time of our breakup, we were only together for about 8-9 months. He was a great guy. I think he liked me more than I liked him, but I still missed him a lot after the breakup. Because we were good to teach other and we really did like each other. 

Anyways, that‚Äôs how we ended things. We went no contact after because we both found it hard to stay friends. I blocked and deleted his number from my end, just to make sure no strings attached on my end. And we deleted each other on all of our social media, so it was absolutely no contact, not even whereabouts. 

And for the past 2 years, I haven‚Äôt dated anyone and I‚Äôve been celibate. It‚Äôs not because I wasn‚Äôt over my old relationship. I was just busy and always found dating to be a lot for an introvert like myself. Also, I just wasn‚Äôt too interested, idk why so don‚Äôt ask, haha. So yeah, that‚Äôs what went down.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It's currently around 1 in the morning and I'm still awake, still hearing that damn robotic chirping of that *bloody* alarm clock. It's been going on and off for around an hour now and I'm starting to think it may be because of what's been happening to not just me, but my family as well. I'll try and start this 'tale' or whatever from the first thing that happened, at the start of the week. Remember, keep an open mind.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This all began on Monday the 25th of November 2024. 

I'd been up all night playing games on my old (still feels strange to say that) Xbox One, and I'd come downstairs to the kitchen to grab something to eat. It was around six or seven in the morning? My mother was sitting on the small kitchen island looking at something on her tablet, probably playing some form of Candy Crush or something. It was dark, and the back door was open; she'd probably let one of the cats out to piss.

I said good morning, and she replied in that same old groggy tone she'd always had in the mornings as I opened the fridge and looked for the milk and take-out leftovers from last night. After heating up some egg-fried rice and pouring myself a glass of milk in one of the small shot glasses we kept in the whine cupboard in the pantry, I walked back into the kitchen and started towards the entryway.

I heard my mother call my name so I spun around and poked my head back into the kitchen. She then asked me if I'd been drawing on any of the windows downstairs; they'd all been fogged up thanks to the cold weather and she knew *very well* I liked to doodle on the bathroom mirror after taking a shower. I'd written the word 'REDRUM' on many occasions in fact; we both love Stephen King.¬† ¬†¬†

I told her no (honest), and she told me to go and look at the window on the open back door. I did and gently pushed it closed as the cat had finally came back in after it had done it's business outside. There, just barely visible on the foggy glass in the dull morning light was the number, or as my mind intercepted at the time, the year:

*1975*

Mom then asked me again if I was sure I didn't scribble that on there. And, again I told her no . . . and that was that. I retreated upstairs and returned to the game at hand while munching down on warm leftovers.

A few hours later, my mom got my little brother up and ready for school and she stuck her head into my room saying she'd see me after work.

I spent the rest of the day just gaming, occasionally smoking out of my bedroom window, and doodling on an app on my phone.

It had to be around 10. AM when I fell asleep, I was still tired after a long night of munching on chips and playing GTA and Minecraft. I think my body just forced me into a deep slumber. When I woke up I could hear a scratching sound coming from out in the hallway beyond my bedroom door; that might have been what woke me in the first place. I checked my phone; 1:56.PM.

When I looked out into the hallway I saw the cat, the same one from this morning (the one who liked to piss on everyone's beds). He was scratching at the small, two-door wooden closet in the hallway on the wall to the left. I could hear the boiler rumbling from inside it, we also kept all of our winter boots and hats in there. His tale was laying flat on the carpet behind him and he was poking and prodding at the closet doors; like he did with the back door when he wanted to go out and piss.

I made a '*psps'* sound to try and coax him towards me. But when it finally registered in his little cat brain that I was trying to speak to him . . . he bolted and ran down the stairs, like he saw me as a hungry Pitbull or something.

Strange. But he was the type of cat that lived up to the term 'pussycat' as he had been petrified by all of us when we first got him. So, I brushed it off and went back to sleep, still feeling exhausted.

Later that night, around nine or ten PM, I joined my mom on the sofa in the darkened living room; the faint glow of a string of fairy lights that hung above the fireplace mantle was our only source of light, Apart from the blaring TV near the front windows. We were watching one of those true crime docs. A few commercials began to play and we talked for a bit. She told me about work and I told her what I'd been doing whilst she and my little brother were out of the house. It was then that she brought up the number we'd both seen drawn on the glass of the backdoor this morning.

""It's an angle's number, Jude . ."" She said in a rather poetic tone.

My mother has always been open to those kinds of things; like a hand is guiding us in life, or that karma is real. Even though she's an atheist and sometimes looks down on certain types of religions, saying that they can make people do horrible things . . . she still believes that there's something more that we are not seeing.¬†¬†

""I looked up what it meant and it said,"" She paused, picking up her phone from the small coffee table in front of us. ""Wait a minute.""

I could see she was scrolling, the bright white glow was illuminating the heavy bags under her eyes; they were always there, they had always been there I think.

""Ah, come. Look here!"" She says.

I scoot over to her and peer down at whatever website she was looking at. There was just a wall of text, and at the top of the page the words '*ANGEL NUMBER 1975'* In big pink letters.

""The number 1-9-7-5 is made up of energies and vibrations of number 1 and number 9, and the influences and attributes of number 7 and number 5.""

I'd give her an 'ok?' look, not knowing where she was going with all this. But, this was like her. I mean, she did one time think the ghost of her father (my grandfather) was trying to communicate with her because she thought she saw his face in a piece of toast.

I nodded at her, wanting her to continue.

""Number 1 brings courage, willpower ambition, and new beginnings. Number 9 denotes endings and conclusions and relates to the universal spiritual laws, a higher power, and karma. Number 7 encourages spiritual enlightenment and awakening. And number 5 promotes personal freedom, major life changes, and life lessons learned through experiences?""¬†¬†

She gave me a warm smile and a look that said 'oh would you look at that?', before continuing down the wall of text. She read the rest in her head as I sank back into my corner of the sofa, smiling to myself. She did tend to believe everything she read on the internet, even though she told me *never* to do the same.

A few commercial breaks later, and the ending of our crime doc, I went upstairs. I was still feeling the consequences from my all-nighter as my head hit the pillow

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nothing happened on Tuesday. When I came downstairs around lunchtime to feed the cats, out of curiosity I checked the window on the back door; nothing. The 'angel number of 1975' was gone. And, that would've been the end of all that . . . if it wasn't for what happened on Wednesday that is.

I'd stayed up all night again on Tuesday, so during all day on Wednesday I was practically forcing myself to stay awake. Normally I would've just taken a nap (of about 6 hours) but I had just ordered McDonald's on Just Eat and I didn't want to miss the delivery guy as my mother had gone to sleep on the sofa; she had a particularly long day at the office, she answers the phones in the complaints department. And my little brother was in the middle of an intense gaming session across the hallway in his room.

It was around six or seven at night when . . . black . . . the power had kicked off. I'd been watching old YouTube uploads of Top Gear episodes (the good Top Gear, not whatever was still airing) on my TV. That was off and so was my bedside lamp; everything was completely black . . . and deathly quiet.¬† ¬†

I heard my little brother mumble a few cuss words as I got up, feeling in a daze as I was still *very* sleep deprived (my fault, my sleep schedule has always been fucked). I poked my head out of my bedroom door and gazed into the dark, inky blackness that was the upstairs hallway. I let my eyes adjust to the darkness for a moment . . . that was when I saw a small blacker-than-night shape on the floor next to where the double closet doors were on the left. It was only when I saw his green-tinted eyes shine softly toward me I realized it was my cat; he was poking and prodding at the closet again like he had been doing on Monday.

Everything felt off . . like I was in a dream of sorts. Of course, it was just because I was in need of a long slumber but . . . with all of the lights being off . . . I was on edge and a bit jumpy.

Again, as I did on Monday, I made a '*psps' s*ound, trying to get my jumpy cat's attention. And, just like before, he took off running; although I could only hear his scampering pours darting across the carpet and could see literally nothing!

But, that was when one of the closet doors began to slowly (and I mean *very* slowly) open, like there was the smallest gust of wind that was pushing it open. There was something in there, I think I knew that as soon as it had begun to open. All those horror movies I'd watched growing up, all of those King books I've read and spoken about with my mother, they all came flooding into my mind, making me picture all types of horrific monsters and masked men.

And, when the closet door finally stopped, now fully opened, the shape of a man's head poked out from within. It was completely jet-black, no facial features, no nothing! Just jet fucking black . . .  but it was soo damn obvious  that it was someone's head!

I froze, as cliche as that sounds I fucking froze. There was a part of me that wanted to bolt past 'it' and charge downstairs. And a stupid part of me (the part of every stupid horror movie character that I liked to shit on soo much) that wanted to see what 'it' really was.

HE was looking right at me . . . right into me . . . I could feel his eyes ,or lack thereof, glaring into mine. Then. In a long, cold, low drawn out breath 'it' spoke to me . . .

""J . . . D . . .""

I lost it. I screamed. I ran straight across the hallway, barding into my little brother's room, he was craned over his PC with a pissed-off expression; the power cut had probably cut off the WI-FI. He jumped a mile when he saw me enter. I spun around and fell back first against the corner of his desk; it hurt like a bitch. Then, he began to scream; out of confusion more than terror I assume . . . the power kicked back on. Lights flickered to life, his monitor beamed brightly and the sound of the TV in my room echoed down the hallway . . . which was where I was glaring wide-eyed. The closet was shut . . . and HE was gone . . . like the blackness of the power cut had taken him with it when everything came back on.

""*Guys!, Guys is everything ok?*"" My mom's voice boomed from down below.

The look on my little brother's face . . . that's what got to me as much as what I saw coming out of that closet. His eyes were wide and his hair was messy and sticking up; like a cat's fur does when it feels threatened. He was breathing heavily, I could tell his little heart was racing.

""Are you o-ok?"" He asked sheepishly, his bottom lip trembling.

""Yeah! . ."" I scoffed, breathing heavily, faking a smile. My lungs felt like they'd burst at any moment as the fear had begun to dissipate. ""Just scared of the dark I guess . ."" I said stupidly, staring off to the left . . . eyeing the now dormant and deserted closet.

Mom came upstairs, asking what the heck was all that banging around. I told her I got spooked in the dark and fell over; which was technically what happened. My little brother seemed to agree.

I told myself what I saw was just my eyes playing tricks on me in the dark; I was lying obviously, I'm not that daft . . . as far as this situation goes anyway. I just told myself that just so I could fall asleep that night, letting the Big Mac grow cold and unwanted on my bedside table as my brother and mother continued doing whatever they had been before the power went off. Sleep did come for me, whether it was just because of all of the late nights I'd been having . . . or the encounter with the 'thing' from the closet had simply just exhausted me to the point where my body had just shut down.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This next event happened on Friday night, yesterday as I'm typing this up for you all now.

It was around 8 at night and I was doom-scrolling on TikTok, trying to keep my thoughts from venturing anywhere near 'him' or the closet. Mom had recently gotten a new alarm clock from eBay and I could hear her setting it up in the next room; her room.¬†¬†My bedroom door was open, it felt safer that way as if 'it' came back I could simply dash to or call out for her.

I know, massive pussy, right?

I was shaken by a loud *CRASHing pop* from somewhere outside of my room, like glass breaking or something? . . . shortly followed by my mother yelping in fear. I shot up and started out into the hallway, paying the closest no mind; it was shut anyway. When I burst into her room I saw her standing up in fright, cowering in the corner with her arms held up to her face as if she was shielding herself from something.

I asked her what the hell was going on and what that sound was. And, she told me her bedside lamp had blown up, the glass bulb inside it had exploded, sending shards of glass everywhere. She told me she'd been sitting on the side of her bed fiddling with her new alarm clock, trying to get it to work when she heard and saw the small bulb inside of the lamp burst.

""Don't! . . stay there, there is glass everywhere!"" She pleaded, gasping as she had already begun scooping small pieces of bulb from her bed sheets and carpet.

She later told me how lucky she was that none of those shards were sent straight into her eyes as she'd been only a few inches away from the lamp.

So that was it, just a faulty or old bulb finally giving out. If that was all that happened I would be asleep right now.

Nope.

The next thing that happened . . was the thing that disturbed me the most, the thing that compelled me to write this post.¬†¬†

Satisfied that my mom wasn't in any real danger (for now at least) I had closed my door and was trying (forcing myself) to go to sleep. I was drenched with sweat and I could feel eyes on me . . . *His* eyes. I knew whatever 'he' was . . . he was watching me from somewhere in the dark corners of my room.

And, just as my body began to give out from what I guessed was pure terror and exhaustion . . . I felt the touch of long. Cold. Boney fingers grasp my back . .¬†¬†if even just for a second . . . I knew they were real.

Of course, when I shot up and turned on my lamp; nothing . . . just my cat curled up on my desk chair, sleeping soundly like I wished to be.¬† ¬†

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have no fucking idea what to do anymore. I know something is here, in my home, trying to do something to me and my family. While I've been writing this I've checked out multiple paranormal websites to find out what this fucker is and what he wants. But I can't tell what is legit and what is just made-up BS from so-called 'experts' online. I've always suspected that there are ghosts or beings that we can't see but can feel around us, but never ones like this, never something like this!

I AM fully convinced this is something demonic. I can still hear that chirping alarm clock that my mom told me she'd fix in the morning. She told me it didn't work and she'd taken out the batteries. So, I guess I can add that to my short list of spooky shit I've experienced this week.¬†¬†

So, *Please* . . . I ask you all. I've read some of your experiences . . . now read mine. And please, someone give me some damn answers.

Sorry, I hope this is allowed and the flair is appropriate. I wasn't too sure which one it best fit with. 

I was thinking, it might be nice to have someone to hang out with that has OCD as well. I live in South-West Sydney but I'm happy to travel into the CBD or wherever is easiest for you. Although I would be using public transport so distance would be a factor. 

I would prefer to chat online for a bit first to get to know each other and everything before we actually hang out in-person. Apart from the obvious danger element, it would definitely be nice to get to know you to see if we get on well outside the OCD.

I'm a 28/m and my OCD is centred around worrying that I'll hurt people in some way. It mostly comes out as germophobia but it can be any safety related thing really. I have a big issue with syringes so if we end up hanging out, I'll definitely be stopping every two seconds to make sure the stick I saw on the floor out of the corner of my eye wasn't a syringe. 

Personality-wise, I'm a massive nerd and I'm into punk. But I do listen to other types of music too. I'm obsessed with Doctor Who and I'm studying palaeontology at university. 

It would just be nice to grab coffee or something every now and again. I've got a great group of friends who are so understanding of everything and who I love but it would be nice to talk with someone who has experience with all this and knows what it's like. ",1,1732938045.0,OCD,0,1.0,False

1h33mdh,https://www.reddit.com/r/stupidpol/comments/1h33mdh/why_im_proud_to_be_a_democrat/,Why I'm proud to be a Democrat ,"I grew up in Seattle, a city where ideas buzzed in the air like the hum of coffee shops on a rainy morning. I‚Äôve always been a curious person‚Äîdrawn to debates, fascinated by the complexity of how societies function, and eager to understand what makes people tick. Those values shaped me early on, and by the time I got to college and started studying political science, it was obvious where I belonged: the Democratic Party. Not just because of its policies, but because of its principles‚Äîits belief in diversity, fairness, and holding power accountable.

I remember one town hall in particular. The topic was a proposed carbon tax. One of my friends, an environmental economist, stood up and laid out a meticulous argument for a flat tax modeled after Sweden‚Äôs success. The room buzzed with nods and murmurs of agreement. But then another voice rose‚Äîa local organizer who worked with low-income communities. She pushed back, saying the tax would hit struggling families the hardest unless paired with rebates or direct assistance.

What followed was one of the most electrifying debates I‚Äôd ever witnessed. People argued passionately, but it wasn‚Äôt personal. It was about evidence, ethics, and how to balance idealism with practical outcomes. I sat there, taking notes, grinning like a nerd because *this* was what politics should be‚Äîa battle of ideas, not insults.

Unfortunately, my family doesn‚Äôt share that perspective. My cousin Nate and I used to have long debates about politics. He‚Äôs a diehard Republican, and for a while, I thought our discussions were genuine attempts to understand each other. But over time, I realized something: he wasn‚Äôt interested in debating ideas; he was defending a worldview rooted in prejudice and dogma.

I‚Äôll never forget the conversation that made me walk away for good. It was during a debate on the CHIPS and Science Act. I tried to explain the economic benefits of the legislation, backing it up with studies, monetary theory, and historical context. Nate dismissed it all, saying, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a giveaway to the rich.‚Äù That was it for me. I couldn‚Äôt keep engaging with someone who refused to see that only the Democrats were sticking up for the little guy, let alone the evidence staring him in the face.

Cutting him off wasn‚Äôt easy, but it was necessary. Life is too short to waste on people who aren‚Äôt willing to challenge themselves. Meanwhile, in the Democratic Party, we do challenge ourselves‚Äîrelentlessly. I‚Äôve seen this time and again in the way we hold our own leaders to high standards. Take Joe Biden, for instance. He stepped up when the country needed stability after Trump‚Äôs chaos, but when the conversation shifted to 2024, we didn‚Äôt blindly rally behind him. Many of us called for new leadership, recognizing that progress demands fresh perspectives and that no one‚Äînot even a sitting president‚Äîis entitled to uncritical support. That‚Äôs what I love about being a Democrat: we question, we debate, and we demand better from those who represent us.

To me, the Democratic Party isn‚Äôt perfect‚Äîclose, but not totally. But that‚Äôs what I love about it. It‚Äôs a party that‚Äôs unafraid to wrestle with its flaws, to push for better, to question everything, including itself. It‚Äôs messy, exhausting, and sometimes maddening, but it‚Äôs also thrilling.

So, yeah, I love being a Democrat. Not just because we fight for healthcare, climate action, and equality, but because we fight for the very soul of democracy. And if that means standing up to racism, sexism, and the GOP‚Äôs parade of bigotry, so be it. Some fights are worth it.",1,1732937772.0,stupidpol,3,0.53,False
1h33m68,https://www.reddit.com/r/Invisalign/comments/1h33m68/preventing_tooth_death_after_leaving_trays_out/,Preventing Tooth Death After Leaving Trays Out?,"I started Invisalign at the beginning of this month, and while my doctor definitely made the 20-22 hour rule clear, they didn't tell me what the potential consequences would be if I didn't wear my trays that full amount of time. I made the dumb assumption that if I missed a day/significant number of hours, oh well, I would just need to tack that on as extra time.

So, after 5-6 days of being very strict with my 1st tray, I went a couple days without them & then for a few days later, had them out for 8 hours at a time. The biggest thing that would cause me forget to put them back in is drinking coffee while working, which I do from 8-2pm most days. I know...stupid.

However, thanks to this subreddit, now that I've read that leaving my trays out can kill my teeth/roots, I feel like a complete idiot. I'm planning to be extremely strict moving forward, but now I'm paranoid I may have already caused damage. (just started tray 3 tonight)

Is there anything I can do to proactively prevent my teeth from dying, or do I need to just cross my fingers? I already added a day onto tray 2 out of precaution, but should I switch back to tray 2? I know it sounds extreme, but I have a lot of experience with water fasting, so if leaving my trays in for nearly 24 hours a day, 5 days straight will help prevent root death, that's something I have experience going that long only drinking water.

Other than waking up one day to see a grey tooth, are there any other symptoms that could indicate that a tooth is about to die while there's still time to prevent it?

I know I probably sound paranoid, but I have been lucky to have functionally healthy teeth before Invisalign, and this was mostly for aesthetics. Since I was already concerned about hurting my healthy teeth before starting, this misunderstanding has me even more concerned.",3,1732937754.0,Invisalign,5,0.8,False

1h33fmo,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1h33fmo/my_ex_did_me_a_solid/,My ex did me a solid,"Back in 2018, I was working in an office at a start up. As we started to scale and get more partnerships, we brought on a general counsel to manage the legal side. He started sliding into my slack, asking me to coffee and so on. he was cute, had a southern accent, and a very deep voice. I had been in the founding 5 team, and he kinda needed someone who had exposure to the evolution of the company since we had hit a point that we had to start legal CYA'ing.

We ended up dating, traveled the world together, got stuck in a flood in his Tennessee hometown and made it night ill never forget, in a good way.  it what was one of the best years of my life. he might have had the JD, but i taught him everything he knows about media, copyright, and IP law. He came from private equity M&A, more industrial businesses too, so taking this role was a career pivot for him

I was very blindsided when he broke up with me. It was by far, the most excruciating break up ive ever been through, mostly because I didnt see it coming. usually, I can, and start detaching in advance. I dont also have to spend hours and hours, every single day, face to face with my exes. as it turns out, that makes it \*way\* easier to forget about them.

the year we were together, we had done a great job keeping our relationship in cognito at work. I really don't think anyone knew. that actually ended up backfiring on me. shortly after getting dumped, my dumper became my direct manager. yeesh...

Luckily, a least in this specific way, we were all sent to WFH a few months later. That made things way, way easier for me. I started to actually recover, get back to form. He started scheduling weird zoom meetings with me with no agenda, very unlike him for someone a very intentional and organized guy (fundamentally at odds my abstract, kinda chaotic personality and way of thinking).

once we were WFH, things got weird. The more I started thinking about other things, the weirder he got. He showed up a my place one day, but I wasn't home (roommate was). A week later, he went to south america. At first, for a vacation. but then, he just...kept going. he traveled the world for over 4 years. slowly, my rose-tinted thoughts towards him turned negative. for years, I could literally only remember the bad parts about him. i all but forgot about him, but one thing lingered. I resented that I had taught him so much. to this day, he works in media, making bank. i chalked it up to him using me to cut his teeth in the industry.

a couple years later, I also moved a good 600 miles away. i got a new job I was not super into, but really needed. well, i guess my lack of enthusiasm was a liiiiiittle too obvious. ended up getting fired in May of this year. whoops.

last week, I was pulling some info as my tax situation this year will be complicated, and i really biffed my las tax filing which cost me a lot. While digging into some work docs...i noticed something. I had like almost 100 hours of \*accrued\* PTO. accrued is key, and ""unlimited pto"" is clever semantics for companies that don't offer PTO.

Did a little research and turns out, I'm supposed to get paid out. My company outsourced its HR to a third party, and they appeared on my W2, paychecks....basically all legal documentation. Given the circumstances, obviously didn't want to go through my old employer.

as expected, the HR company tried to give me the run around, saying I had to get my old company's approval. Nope.

I sent them the California Labor law that says accrued PTO is considered wages, and MUST be paid out once employment ends. they kept saying the couldn't do it. yes, you can. and you legally have to, actually.

I wasn't about to let them put me in this monkey in the middle position, pointing fingers at each other and dumping the burden on me to beg for my earned wages until I gave up. nay, nay, my friends.

unfortunately for them, i have a natural understanding of business liability‚Äîand i knew it was on them. if they needed my old employer to pay them back for it, well, thats their problem. they are my legal, listed employer. on my paychecks. on my W2. on my benefits. everywhere. my old company's name barely appears on anything. THEY were on the hook. and THEY can beg my old employer for the money, if they want. not my problem.

Yesterday, out of no where, my ex texted me happy thanksgiving. he's reached out a few times over the years, but I don't really respond. he knows I hate small talk.

but as luck would have it, keeping a lawyer on deck might be a good call at the moment. so, I responded, for the first time in years. I cut to the chase, telling him about my conundrum. I asked if he'd look over my email with docs. he agreed.

he didn't really have any edits, but sent it back pretty quick. for a second i was annoyed, like...disturbed my peace and didn't even need to?  ugh. But I sent the email with screenshots their name on my W2, paychecks, under ""Employer name,"" employer ID, etc. and all the history of hour accrual in \*their\* portal, with highlights, just to be annoying. I BBC'd my ex, because, why not, hes on retainer now

Hours go by, but I figured its a holiday weekend, so I wasn't too worried about it. Get a notification that the email got a response. to my surprise, they are processing it.

then I see that less than 10 minutes earlier, my ex had replied all‚Äîbut from the email domain and signature of his law firm, asking why it hadn't been paid out with my last check. They responded within 5 minutes of his follow up saying it was submitted for processing.

still not down for small talk‚Äîbut I gave his follow up text that I would have been a ""pitbull lawyer"" a like

I wouldn't consider this squared off for the ivy league level education i gave him on media copyright, IP, libel and rights management, but i suppose it doesn't hurt to have a lawyer in the rolodex.

Thinking to fly into Sydney, spend a few days here and do day trips (ex Blue Mountains, Bondi/Manly Beach) and sightsee. Then fly to the Whitsundays and stay on Hamilton Island. Do day trips to Whitehaven beach, and snorkelling in the GBR. Then thinking fly to Melbourne for a few days - visit some wineries or Phillip Island.

Some evenings she would make tea and put these honey lollipops in our cups. It may be some time before I can have that. The drawback of living a life so connected with someone you love is the disconnection that comes when they have been lost. There are so many things that I can not longer enjoy.

1h334go,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1h334go/friend_has_ghosted_me_for_other_friends/,Friend has ghosted me for other friends,"Hi. Wanting to ask how to proceed.

I (33f) have a friend (24f). Lets call her Sarah. I have known for just over a year now. We are both expats and met through volunteering. We gave got on very well and have another friend who We Hung out with some times too as a tr√≠o but we have a friendship independently. She's also introduced me to  a few other friends too. She's very sociable and lively and we are quite different but we just clicked. My husband and her boyfriend get on well - we've done trips, dinner, drinks. Frequently. And texted to check in regularly. Etc. It felt to me a genuine and pure friendship.

At a party a friend threw for me, she met some of my colleagues/friends and decided she liked them and wanted to befriend them. I found it a little strange that she initially invited them for dinner at her home but didn't include me but I was out of the country at the time and assumed once back - we could all hang out together. But things have taken an odd turn.

On my return I caught up with her and her boyfriend. She told me how much she liked my friends and I said I'd heard from them that she had made them a nice meal etc. She never said anything else to me about them or hanging out together but spent the evening telling us a lot about a tricky family situation she was in.

Fast forward and a few days later, my friend/colleague said 'we are supposed to be meeting Sarah. Shall we all do something together?' I agreed and we booked to see a dance show. Then, Sarah pulled out suddenly but then at the last minute turned up. I tried to be normal but I felt a tension. I don't know if I'm sensitive  This evening culminated in her inviting them to yoga (not inviting me but she knows yogas not my thing) but what really stung was her inviting the 3 of them to her home for coffee and not including me. I found it all very odd.

Since then, she didn't get in touch for the best part of a month (she did have a holiday during this time of which we advised of some places to visit as we did the same trip before). I've since discovered that during this time she has been texting with my friends, arranging nights out etc and not including me. Obviously I don't expect to be included in everything but it feels such a rapid shift in our friendship and like I've been pushed aside. If she wants to be friends with them fine, but I can't understand the lack of effort to maintain our friendship all of a sudden. 

Honestly I feel too old and too lacking in energy to deal with it. But I can't lie that it stings. Its also weird and uncomfortable to hear my friends talking about her and I don't think they realise she has stopped speaking to me. 

What do I do? Truly I don't think I want to put any energy into this friendship as it feels too immature. But I also feel very strange around my friends when they talk about her without realising the odd position I am now in. Can I tell the truth that my relationship with her has shifted?

I used to play music with friends as a vocalist. Recently, I've been having movie nights with one of my best friends, enjoying new movies and showing him some he's never seen.

I've also been hanging out at my local game store recently. I met a bunch of cool people there, and I enjoy playing TCGs such as Magic: The Gathering, Yu-Gi-Oh, and Pok√©mon.

**AITA for telling my brother to stop coming unannounced and changing the locks?**

Not the A-hole
My brother, Chris (27M fake name), moved in with my BF (28M) and I (26F) 7 years ago. We took pity on him after he was kicked out of my childhood home for drug use and was sleeping in his car. At first, chris and my boyfriend got along great. After a few years of living together chris became more reclusive and distant from us both. Chores were not being done around the house and I was getting sick of cleaning up after him and his negative attitude. Six months prior to the end of our lease I told Chris that he had to find another living situation. He did finally move out a few weeks prior to the end of our lease and i thought we all agreed about splitting up shared appliances and valuables. One thing we did not discuss was our shared robot mopping device. We acquired this one day at my grandmother's house a few years ago. She was moving and offered it to all three of us as she would not be using it. So we brought that little robot home! This thing is nothing fancy, just a small device you fill with cleaning solution and attach disposable mop pads. Let me be clear, in the 4 years we have had this thing Chris has not ONCE paid for any replacement moping pads. NEVER had even turned the thing on. It was always BF or I splitting the cost of pads and setting this thing up to run nightly so we'd all wake up to clean floors downstairs.

Chris hasn't returned his key because he's still slowly moving things out. It's been over a month now. He always showed up unannounced to our home to gather boxes and his belongings. Sometimes we wouldn't even realize he was there while we had been out.

Last night BF was looking for our little robot friend as we had just gotten new pads delivered for it. Turns out after going crazy looking for this thing and texting Chris he did take it, claiming ""yeah, he is mine"". This was the last straw. We had been so accommodating to this man for years. I just can't believe Chris had the AUDACITY to take our beloved robotic cleaning friend without a word. I have let Chris know that we are no longer comfortable with him coming by unannounced and if he needs anything we will look for it ourselves. I also said he can return his key to the office and we will pick it up. His response? ""Stop being weird i dont want any of your trash shit i already had all my useful grow equipment stolen anyways stop texting me before you make me mad"" (The grow stuff referred to here is indoor greenhouse and hydroponics. Which was verbally agreed for an even split of materials since both Chris and BF acquired the equipment together.) BF ordered a camera that will be here tomorrow, I've contacted the leasing office to make them aware of the animosity between us and requested the locks to be changed. I just want to know, am I going to far? This robot is not at all expensive, but it's more about the principle to me. I feel disrespected. We all have to see eachother next week for Thanksgiving and i know it will be awkward. Update posted in comments.

**Relevant comments (and OOP's response to them):**

OOP in response to a deleted commenter: He is no longer on the lease. Only BF and I signed the renual document.

Another response to a deleted commenter: He's officially moved out more than a month ago now, and has his own new residence.

**Mudane-Falcon1470**: has he ever taken any responsibilty for what got him kicked out or was it never his fault? what kind of housemate was he?bf was very patient cause thats a lot of drama noone needs.have you apologized to bf for disrupting his home?

OOP: The main reason we wanted him to move out was space for BF and I as a couple. We're planning engagement soon and want to move on with our own lives. He was quite weird to live with, especially towards the end.. didn't clean up the mess on the stove or coffee area after himself. I don't think he took out the trash once, and I had to ask. I have apologized to my BF for letting this go on for so long, but I should really put a note or something together for him. Thanks!

**WillLoveCoffee4Ever1**: NTA! I hate it when someone needs help and then turn around and wear out their welcome, make a nuisance of themselves, and/or just end up being complete unappreciative AH users, totally taking advantage of the person who is giving them shelter. You should have changed the locks the moment he left and if he wanted his things, he'd have to call and make arrangements while you were both there. He's not cleaning up after himself. What does he want with the robot vacuum, anyway?

OOP: He only wants the moppimg robot now that he ""has hardwood floors now"". But we've always lived in a house where this robot was useful, he just didn't want to contribute to our shared space. He also had the audactity to say his contributions to cleaning the floor was the robot itself.. that was given to us and he did not pay for??

**houseonpost**: Would you have given him the robot if he left a year earlier?

Take the win. He's out of your house. Just ignore him, change the locks and enjoy your life.

OOP: No, chris never showed interest in the robot until it was convenient for him. I don't think he has any claim to it.

**Blue_Moon_Rabbit**: Are you gonna stage a robot rescue mission to get mop-buddy back? I am emotionally invested now‚Ä¶

OOP: I don't know his exact current address only the street name, but I'm thinking of sharing this post with him. Not sure if that will change his minds though.

**nerd_is_a_verb**: NTA, but you are a pushover. If I were your BF, then I would really resent you for moving your useless, mooching, thieving, jerk of a brother into the shared home. Good luck with fixing that.

OOP: We've talked about it and we were both at fault. BF offered in the first place I didn't even ask. He was trying to show me how compassionate he is. I fully take the responsibility of not putting my foot down sooner.

OOP on what the robot in question is: For those asking heres a link to the specific device: [irobot braava mopping robot](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B019OH9898?ref=cm_sw_r_cso_cp_apan_dp_KRGJ081ERWP3S8C4GNTD&ref_=cm_sw_r_cso_cp_apan_dp_KRGJ081ERWP3S8C4GNTD&social_share=cm_sw_r_cso_cp_apan_dp_KRGJ081ERWP3S8C4GNTD&starsLeft=1&skipTwisterOG=1)

**First update posted in comments (EDITOR'S NOTE: paragraphs in this one for readibility)**

Update: I decided to reach out to my brother and ask him nicely to bring our robot friend to Thanksgiving so we can bring him back home. Here's the messages so far: 

Me- I've gotten some time to think about this and gotten some different perspectives. I don't believe the robot belongs to you, I'd really appreciate if you could bring it with you to Thanksgiving so we can bring it back home. I feel as though we've been very accommodating to you over the years you've lived with us, and taking a shared appliance without any discussion is not only disrespectful but shows your lack of consideration for us. So we'd like our robot back, since really he is ours after years of using and upkeeping without any help from you. 

Chris- I‚Äôve gotten some time to think about it and I want the TV from grandmas as well so go ahead and bring it over when you get a chance thanks 

Me- TV was also given to us specifically I'm not sure why you think that's yours as well? 

Chris-Everything was given to you apparently She asked me if i wanted the robot while I was in the kitchen and I said yes thats how it went end of story i dont give 2 shits what you think is yours or not if I let you borrow something because im not using it it doesnt make it yours 

Me-As I remember it, we were all there at the time she offered. And I even tried to decline since it's still useful but she insisted. It was given to all of us as a shared household. If you thought it was yours, you should have had a discussion with us first before taking it while we were out.

Chris-You remember wrong and I dont need to have a discussion about my own things. Not to mention BF moving shady taking shit out of the tent while I was gone thinking I wouldnt notice lol how is that any different? I didnt bring it up because im a bigger person and dont really care anymore I want to put this terrible part of my life behind me and if you dont leave it be Im going to leave you behind as well. 

Me-You and BF had a discussion about splitting up the grow stuff which he thought went amicably. You aren't being very mature and I don't want someone that can't have a simple conversation about shared items in my life anyways.

So I guess that's it, looks we will not be getting our little friend back. Thank you all for your support and interacting with this post. This was my second post ever, and to see it blow up was a crazy feeling!

**UPDATE: AITA for telling my brother to stop coming unannounced and changing the locks?**

Hello again! I just wanted to start by saying thank you all for your judgments on my last post. I read every comment and gave each perspective some thought. Ultimately you guys helped me gain the confidence to stand up for myself and ask for our robot back! I included my text conversation with my brother Chris in the comments of my last post. To summarize, I asked as politely as I could for our mopping robot back as well as stated the reasonings why it belonged to us. Chris refused to see reason and pretty much said he would be cutting me out of his life if I kept bringing this up. My wonderful BF couldn't sit back and let him be disrespectful to us anymore. He had his own conversation with Chris, which for privacy reasons cannot be shared. BF ended up taking some of your guys advice and threatened to reveal specific information to our family if our robot was not returned on Thanksgiving. This was last Thursday, so he had one week to make a decision.

After a quiet week I was preparing myself to drop a bomb on family dinner. But then, I went out to start warming up my car Wednesday night and there was a box on my front step. I didn't order anything and as I picked up the box noticed it wasn't sealed.

GUYS OUR ROBOT FRIEND FOUND HIS WAY HOME!

I guess Chris decided that a mopping robot was not worth ruining his reputation with our family. He will not be bothering us anymore, and we will be low/no contact from now on.

Now a positive from all this drama! BF and I are utilizing our new home monitoring cameras to watch our pets. Our dogs and cats activities while home alone are so entertaining it's brought us a lot of joy to check in on them. Family photo will be posted in comments of pets and robot!

Have a great holiday season everyone!

**OOP later posted a pet photo with the mopping robot [here](https://www.reddit.com/user/DwigtSchruteBeets/comments/1h2rrsu/family_photo/)**

**More relevant comments (and OOP's response to them):**

**friendlily**: Glad you got it back but does it still work?

OOP: It does! He's back to work, seems like he wasn't used at all (no surprise) the same dirty pad was on from when we last used it.

**I am NOT the OOP. Please do NOT harass OOP and please refer to rules 1 and 2 of this subreddit when talking to people in the comments.**",135,1732935681.0,BORUpdates,37,0.91,False

*‚ÄúStart by doing what‚Äôs necessary, then do what‚Äôs possible; suddenly, you are doing the impossible.‚Äù*

Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm doing preliminary research for a future business I‚Äôm planning to open‚Äîa combination coffee shop and bookstore. The shop will sell coffee, snacks, and baked goods alongside books, trinkets, and possibly some merch.

I‚Äôm looking for a POS system that:

	1.	Can handle inventory management for both retail items (books, trinkets) and caf√© items (food, drinks).

	2.	Supports loyalty programs or discounts for regular customers.

	3.	Is easy to use for employees with varying levels of tech experience.

	4.	Offers integration with e-commerce platforms in case I decide to sell books or merch online.

	5.	Is scalable as the business grows.

If you‚Äôve run a similar business, I‚Äôd love to hear what‚Äôs worked for you and why. Any recommendations for systems like Square, Shopify, Toast, or others? Or maybe there‚Äôs something specific to bookstores or coffee shops I should be considering?

1h32rvz,https://www.reddit.com/r/9Barista/comments/1h32rvz/induction_or_electric_cooktop/,Induction or Electric Cooktop? | Standardized/Benchmark Metrics for Dialing In?,"Hi All,

I have just purchased the 9Barista, and wanted to gauge if the community has established benchmark metrics as far as the heat source is concerned. While I understand that grind size and coffee amount affect the brew, it seems to me that the heat source would be highly important as well. Considering this, I read on the induction plate product page on 9Barista's website that it should be heated at no more than 600W. However, this does not state the recommended wattage or temperature through the brew process. 

Since induction cooktops use power (watts) AND temperature, while with electric cooktops one can adjust only one variable, it seems that induction could provide a more precisely repeatable dial in. However, some induction cooktops (the one I currently own which is 1800W and thus too powerful for the 9Barista) use power cycling at lower power levels, which means the power heating the machine will drop to near zero sporadically throughout the brewing process (ex: using a watt meter on my induction hub, I found at 175 degrees and a P1 power level, once heated to 1350 watts, it sporadically drops to 5W for a few seconds, then again rises back up to \~450W, then \~850W, then again 1350W in the following few seconds, and this repeats. At 200 degrees and P2, it stays consistently at 1350W). The electric stovetop does not have this concern, heating at a consistent power/temperature throughout. I hypothesize though that a lower-powered induction hub would remain at a consistent figure at lower wattages, but scanning the marketplace, it does not seem that many of these are produced.

While it seems many are brewing beautiful shots 'feeling' their way to the proper dial in with whatever stovetop they may have, I am curious if any have standardized an optimal electric or induction workflow, and if any have recommendations as to which option I should choose. I will conclude that I would prefer a cooktop that is portable, as this is one of the benefits of the machine! Also will note I drink medium-roast espresso.

It‚Äôs incredibly infuriating when someone dismisses my genuine trade offer on Soundmap with a mocking ""üòÇ"" emoji. Do you think it's funny? I hope your crayons melt in the sun, and your favorite pair of socks gets a hole in the toe.
Trading on Soundmap takes effort, thought, and a bit of trust. When I take the time to craft an offer, only to receive your smug little laugh, it‚Äôs like spitting in my face. I hope every time you eat cereal, your milk is just a little too warm, and your toast always lands butter-side down.
I don't just throw out offers willy-nilly. I consider value, fairness, and what you might actually want. Your ""üòÇ"" tells me that my effort wasn't even worth a moment's serious consideration. May your pencils always break when you're writing something important, and may your favorite TV shows always buffer at the worst moments.
Why not just decline politely? Or better yet, offer a counterproposal? Instead, you chose to be dismissive and condescending. I hope your Wi-Fi cuts out right when you‚Äôre about to win an online game, and that you step on a Lego every morning.
A respectful decline or a constructive comment would be far better. But no, you had to send a ""üòÇ"". May all your pens run out of ink halfway through writing, and may your phone battery die just as you need it most.
The level of disrespect you‚Äôve shown with that emoji is staggering. It‚Äôs not just a simple rejection; it‚Äôs a mockery of my time and effort. I hope every meal you eat is just slightly overcooked, and that every drink you take is lukewarm. I hope your umbrella always flips inside out when it rains, and that your shoelaces snap when you're in a hurry.
You might think that sending a ""üòÇ"" emoji is harmless, but it's a direct insult to the effort I've put in. It‚Äôs a way of saying that my offer, my time, and my thoughts are worth nothing to you. May your car always have a mysterious rattle that no mechanic can fix, and may you always get stuck in the slowest checkout line at the grocery store.
There‚Äôs a certain level of courtesy expected in any negotiation, whether it‚Äôs in person or online. Your ""üòÇ"" emoji breaks that unspoken rule of decency. I hope every sweater you own shrinks in the wash, and that you always have a hangnail. May your favorite book always have the last page missing, and your phone screen always have a smudge that won‚Äôt come off.
When I see that ""üòÇ"" emoji, it feels like a slap in the face. It‚Äôs a signal that my offer wasn‚Äôt even worth considering, let alone responding to politely. I hope every movie you watch has a crucial scene spoiled beforehand, and that your shoes always give you blisters. May your pillows always be too lumpy, and your alarm clock fail to go off when you need it most.
Trading on Soundmap should be a respectful exchange, but your reaction makes it clear that you don‚Äôt value that principle. I hope your internet connection is always just a little too slow for streaming, and that your glasses are always smudged. May every pen you use explode in your pocket, and your favorite shirt always get stained.
It‚Äôs not just about the rejection; it‚Äôs about the way you‚Äôve chosen to deliver it. That ""üòÇ"" emoji is a form of ridicule that undermines the entire purpose of the platform. I hope your favorite mug always has coffee drips down the side, and that your headphones always have one side that doesn‚Äôt work. May your most important emails always go to spam, and your favorite songs always skip.
I wish people on Soundmap could be more considerate and respectful. A simple ""no, thank you"" or a counteroffer would go a long way. Instead, you chose mockery. I hope your mail always gets lost, and your favorite restaurant always has a long wait. May your phone always die right when you need to make an important call, and your computer always crash when you haven‚Äôt saved your work.
That ""üòÇ"" emoji isn‚Äôt just a laugh; it‚Äôs a statement of disdain. It‚Äôs a way of saying that my effort is laughable to you. I hope your shoes always squeak, and that your keys always get stuck in the lock. May your favorite TV shows always be on hiatus, and your candles always burn unevenly.
If you think that sending a ""üòÇ"" emoji is a harmless joke, think again. It‚Äôs a direct insult to the effort and thought I put into my offer. I hope your ice cream always melts before you can enjoy it, and that your popcorn is always burned. May your favorite pen always be missing, and your light bulbs always flicker.
The dismissive nature of that emoji is what makes it so infuriating. It‚Äôs not just a rejection; it‚Äôs a mockery of my attempt to engage in a fair trade. I hope your shoelaces always come untied, and that your coffee is always too hot. May your car always be low on gas, and your favorite chair always be uncomfortable.
In a community like Soundmap, mutual respect is key. Your ""üòÇ"" emoji shows a lack of that respect. I hope your favorite team always loses, and that your plants always wilt. May your headphones always tangle, and your favorite show always be spoiled.
That ""üòÇ"" emoji is more than just a laugh; it‚Äôs a symbol of your disdain for my effort. I hope your showers are always cold, and that your socks never match. May your favorite book always be out of stock, and your favorite movie always be sold out.
To sum it up, your ""üòÇ"" emoji is a slap in the face to anyone who puts genuine effort into a trade offer. It reflects poorly on you and creates a hostile trading environment. I hope your printer always jams, and your keys always get lost. A little decency and respect can go a long way, but it seems you have none to spare. Sleep with one eye open.

","This report provides a comprehensive and critical analysis of Java Burn, a dietary supplement marketed for weight loss and metabolism boosting. Based on information from an article published on October 1, 2024, this analysis examines the product's claimed benefits, ingredients, customer reviews, marketing strategies, and potential risks.

# Summary of Key Claims and Ingredients

Java Burn is marketed as a powdered supplement designed to be mixed with coffee. The product claims to boost metabolism, promote fat burning, and aid in weight loss without altering the taste of coffee. Key ingredients mentioned in the article include:

* Green tea extract
* L-theanine
* Chromium
* Chlorogenic acid (from green coffee bean extract)

The supplement is said to work by activating the body's ""fat-burning furnace"" through a combination of these ingredients. The manufacturer claims that Java Burn can lead to significant weight loss results, with some users reportedly losing up to 12 pounds in 3 months.

# [Click to Buy](https://tinyurl.com/3x5abzx5)

# Critical Analysis of Claimed Benefits

# Metabolism Boosting and Weight Loss

The primary claim of Java Burn is its ability to enhance metabolism and promote weight loss. While some ingredients like green tea extract have been associated with modest metabolic benefits in scientific studies, the extent of their impact as part of this specific formulation is unclear.

Green tea extract contains caffeine and catechins, which may slightly increase energy expenditure and fat oxidation. However, the effects are generally small and may not lead to significant weight loss on their own. The addition of chromium could potentially help regulate blood sugar levels, which might indirectly support weight management efforts. However, its direct impact on weight loss is not strongly supported by current evidence.

The claim of activating a ""fat-burning furnace"" appears to be marketing hyperbole rather than a scientifically accurate description of metabolic processes. While the ingredients may have some modest effects on metabolism, the dramatic results suggested in the marketing materials should be viewed skeptically.

# Taste Neutrality

Java Burn's claim of being taste-neutral and not affecting the flavor of coffee is an interesting selling point. While it's possible that the powder is formulated to minimize taste impact, the complete absence of any flavor change seems unlikely, especially given ingredients like green tea extract. User experiences would be valuable in verifying this claim, as individual perceptions of taste can vary.

[Get Started With Java Burn Today!](https://tinyurl.com/3x5abzx5)

# Credibility of Customer Reviews

The article mentions that Java Burn has received a rating of 4.9 out of 5 stars based on customer reviews. This exceptionally high rating raises questions about the authenticity and representativeness of these reviews. Several factors should be considered:

1. Selection bias: Satisfied customers are more likely to leave reviews, potentially skewing the overall rating.
2. Verification process: It's unclear how these reviews are verified or if they come from confirmed purchases.
3. Placebo effect: Given the nature of weight loss supplements, some positive reviews may be influenced by placebo effects or other lifestyle changes coinciding with supplement use.
4. Marketing influence: There's a possibility that some reviews could be influenced by marketing efforts or incentives.

The claim of users losing 12 pounds in 3 months, while not impossible, should be viewed cautiously. Such results likely depend on various factors including diet, exercise, and individual metabolism, rather than solely on the supplement.

# Comparison with Other Weight Loss Methods

The article mentions Java Burn in the context of other weight loss methods, specifically Ozempic and Wegovy. These are prescription medications used for treating obesity and have shown significant results in clinical trials. However, they also come with potential side effects and require medical supervision.

Java Burn, as a dietary supplement, operates in a different regulatory space and should not be directly compared to prescription medications. While it may offer a more accessible option, its effects are likely to be much more modest compared to pharmaceutical interventions.

# Potential Risks and Side Effects

The article does not appear to discuss potential risks or side effects in depth, which is a significant omission. Even natural ingredients can have side effects or interact with medications. Some considerations:

* Caffeine content: Green tea extract contains caffeine, which could lead to jitters, insomnia, or other caffeine-related side effects, especially when combined with coffee.
* Interactions: Ingredients like chromium may interact with certain medications.
* Individual sensitivities: Some people may be sensitive to specific ingredients, leading to digestive issues or allergic reactions.

The lack of discussion about potential risks in the marketing materials is concerning and highlights the need for consumers to consult with healthcare providers before starting any new supplement regimen.

# Analysis of Marketing Strategy

Java Burn's marketing strategy appears to focus on convenience and the promise of effortless weight loss. Key elements include:

1. Integration with daily coffee routine
2. Claims of taste neutrality
3. Emphasis on natural ingredients
4. Availability on both Amazon and the official website

The dual availability on Amazon and the official website is interesting. While Amazon presence can increase visibility and trust, the official website likely offers better margins for the company. The strategy of offering bulk discounts on the official site is a common tactic to encourage larger purchases.

# Publication Date and Information Currency

The article's publication date of October 1, 2024, suggests that the information is relatively current as of the analysis date. However, it's important to note that the supplement market evolves rapidly, and new research or user experiences may have emerged since the article's publication. Potential buyers should seek the most up-to-date information and reviews before making a purchase decision.

# [Click to Buy](https://tinyurl.com/3x5abzx5)

# Conclusion

Java Burn presents itself as a convenient and natural solution for weight loss, leveraging the popularity of coffee and the appeal of effortless weight management. While some of its ingredients have shown potential benefits in scientific studies, the dramatic results claimed in marketing materials should be approached with skepticism.

Potential buyers should consider the following:

1. The efficacy of Java Burn likely varies significantly between individuals.
2. The high customer rating should be viewed critically, considering potential biases in review systems.
3. As with any supplement, there are potential risks and side effects that should be discussed with a healthcare provider.
4. Java Burn should not be seen as a replacement for a balanced diet and regular exercise.
5. The cost-effectiveness of the supplement should be evaluated against other weight loss strategies.

In conclusion, while Java Burn may offer some benefits, it is not a magic solution for weight loss. Consumers should approach such supplements with realistic expectations, prioritize overall health, and make informed decisions based on comprehensive research and professional medical advice.

","This report provides a comprehensive and critical analysis of Java Burn, a dietary supplement marketed for weight loss and metabolism boosting. Based on information from an article published on October 1, 2024, this analysis examines the product's claimed benefits, ingredients, customer reviews, marketing strategies, and potential risks.

# Summary of Key Claims and Ingredients

Java Burn is marketed as a powdered supplement designed to be mixed with coffee. The product claims to boost metabolism, promote fat burning, and aid in weight loss without altering the taste of coffee. Key ingredients mentioned in the article include:

* Green tea extract
* L-theanine
* Chromium
* Chlorogenic acid (from green coffee bean extract)

The supplement is said to work by activating the body's ""fat-burning furnace"" through a combination of these ingredients. The manufacturer claims that Java Burn can lead to significant weight loss results, with some users reportedly losing up to 12 pounds in 3 months.

# [Click to Buy](https://tinyurl.com/3x5abzx5)

# Critical Analysis of Claimed Benefits

# Metabolism Boosting and Weight Loss

The primary claim of Java Burn is its ability to enhance metabolism and promote weight loss. While some ingredients like green tea extract have been associated with modest metabolic benefits in scientific studies, the extent of their impact as part of this specific formulation is unclear.

Green tea extract contains caffeine and catechins, which may slightly increase energy expenditure and fat oxidation. However, the effects are generally small and may not lead to significant weight loss on their own. The addition of chromium could potentially help regulate blood sugar levels, which might indirectly support weight management efforts. However, its direct impact on weight loss is not strongly supported by current evidence.

The claim of activating a ""fat-burning furnace"" appears to be marketing hyperbole rather than a scientifically accurate description of metabolic processes. While the ingredients may have some modest effects on metabolism, the dramatic results suggested in the marketing materials should be viewed skeptically.

# Taste Neutrality

Java Burn's claim of being taste-neutral and not affecting the flavor of coffee is an interesting selling point. While it's possible that the powder is formulated to minimize taste impact, the complete absence of any flavor change seems unlikely, especially given ingredients like green tea extract. User experiences would be valuable in verifying this claim, as individual perceptions of taste can vary.

[Get Started With Java Burn Today!](https://tinyurl.com/3x5abzx5)

# Credibility of Customer Reviews

The article mentions that Java Burn has received a rating of 4.9 out of 5 stars based on customer reviews. This exceptionally high rating raises questions about the authenticity and representativeness of these reviews. Several factors should be considered:

1. Selection bias: Satisfied customers are more likely to leave reviews, potentially skewing the overall rating.
2. Verification process: It's unclear how these reviews are verified or if they come from confirmed purchases.
3. Placebo effect: Given the nature of weight loss supplements, some positive reviews may be influenced by placebo effects or other lifestyle changes coinciding with supplement use.
4. Marketing influence: There's a possibility that some reviews could be influenced by marketing efforts or incentives.

The claim of users losing 12 pounds in 3 months, while not impossible, should be viewed cautiously. Such results likely depend on various factors including diet, exercise, and individual metabolism, rather than solely on the supplement.

# Comparison with Other Weight Loss Methods

The article mentions Java Burn in the context of other weight loss methods, specifically Ozempic and Wegovy. These are prescription medications used for treating obesity and have shown significant results in clinical trials. However, they also come with potential side effects and require medical supervision.

Java Burn, as a dietary supplement, operates in a different regulatory space and should not be directly compared to prescription medications. While it may offer a more accessible option, its effects are likely to be much more modest compared to pharmaceutical interventions.

# Potential Risks and Side Effects

The article does not appear to discuss potential risks or side effects in depth, which is a significant omission. Even natural ingredients can have side effects or interact with medications. Some considerations:

* Caffeine content: Green tea extract contains caffeine, which could lead to jitters, insomnia, or other caffeine-related side effects, especially when combined with coffee.
* Interactions: Ingredients like chromium may interact with certain medications.
* Individual sensitivities: Some people may be sensitive to specific ingredients, leading to digestive issues or allergic reactions.

The lack of discussion about potential risks in the marketing materials is concerning and highlights the need for consumers to consult with healthcare providers before starting any new supplement regimen.

# Analysis of Marketing Strategy

Java Burn's marketing strategy appears to focus on convenience and the promise of effortless weight loss. Key elements include:

1. Integration with daily coffee routine
2. Claims of taste neutrality
3. Emphasis on natural ingredients
4. Availability on both Amazon and the official website

The dual availability on Amazon and the official website is interesting. While Amazon presence can increase visibility and trust, the official website likely offers better margins for the company. The strategy of offering bulk discounts on the official site is a common tactic to encourage larger purchases.

# Publication Date and Information Currency

The article's publication date of October 1, 2024, suggests that the information is relatively current as of the analysis date. However, it's important to note that the supplement market evolves rapidly, and new research or user experiences may have emerged since the article's publication. Potential buyers should seek the most up-to-date information and reviews before making a purchase decision.

# [Click to Buy](https://tinyurl.com/3x5abzx5)

# Conclusion

Java Burn presents itself as a convenient and natural solution for weight loss, leveraging the popularity of coffee and the appeal of effortless weight management. While some of its ingredients have shown potential benefits in scientific studies, the dramatic results claimed in marketing materials should be approached with skepticism.

Potential buyers should consider the following:

1. The efficacy of Java Burn likely varies significantly between individuals.
2. The high customer rating should be viewed critically, considering potential biases in review systems.
3. As with any supplement, there are potential risks and side effects that should be discussed with a healthcare provider.
4. Java Burn should not be seen as a replacement for a balanced diet and regular exercise.
5. The cost-effectiveness of the supplement should be evaluated against other weight loss strategies.

In conclusion, while Java Burn may offer some benefits, it is not a magic solution for weight loss. Consumers should approach such supplements with realistic expectations, prioritize overall health, and make informed decisions based on comprehensive research and professional medical advice.

","This report provides a comprehensive and critical analysis of Java Burn, a dietary supplement marketed for weight loss and metabolism boosting. Based on information from an article published on October 1, 2024, this analysis examines the product's claimed benefits, ingredients, customer reviews, marketing strategies, and potential risks.

# Summary of Key Claims and Ingredients

Java Burn is marketed as a powdered supplement designed to be mixed with coffee. The product claims to boost metabolism, promote fat burning, and aid in weight loss without altering the taste of coffee. Key ingredients mentioned in the article include:

* Green tea extract
* L-theanine
* Chromium
* Chlorogenic acid (from green coffee bean extract)

The supplement is said to work by activating the body's ""fat-burning furnace"" through a combination of these ingredients. The manufacturer claims that Java Burn can lead to significant weight loss results, with some users reportedly losing up to 12 pounds in 3 months.

# [Click to Buy](https://tinyurl.com/3x5abzx5)

# Critical Analysis of Claimed Benefits

# Metabolism Boosting and Weight Loss

The primary claim of Java Burn is its ability to enhance metabolism and promote weight loss. While some ingredients like green tea extract have been associated with modest metabolic benefits in scientific studies, the extent of their impact as part of this specific formulation is unclear.

Green tea extract contains caffeine and catechins, which may slightly increase energy expenditure and fat oxidation. However, the effects are generally small and may not lead to significant weight loss on their own. The addition of chromium could potentially help regulate blood sugar levels, which might indirectly support weight management efforts. However, its direct impact on weight loss is not strongly supported by current evidence.

The claim of activating a ""fat-burning furnace"" appears to be marketing hyperbole rather than a scientifically accurate description of metabolic processes. While the ingredients may have some modest effects on metabolism, the dramatic results suggested in the marketing materials should be viewed skeptically.

# Taste Neutrality

Java Burn's claim of being taste-neutral and not affecting the flavor of coffee is an interesting selling point. While it's possible that the powder is formulated to minimize taste impact, the complete absence of any flavor change seems unlikely, especially given ingredients like green tea extract. User experiences would be valuable in verifying this claim, as individual perceptions of taste can vary.

[Get Started With Java Burn Today!](https://tinyurl.com/3x5abzx5)

# Credibility of Customer Reviews

The article mentions that Java Burn has received a rating of 4.9 out of 5 stars based on customer reviews. This exceptionally high rating raises questions about the authenticity and representativeness of these reviews. Several factors should be considered:

1. Selection bias: Satisfied customers are more likely to leave reviews, potentially skewing the overall rating.
2. Verification process: It's unclear how these reviews are verified or if they come from confirmed purchases.
3. Placebo effect: Given the nature of weight loss supplements, some positive reviews may be influenced by placebo effects or other lifestyle changes coinciding with supplement use.
4. Marketing influence: There's a possibility that some reviews could be influenced by marketing efforts or incentives.

The claim of users losing 12 pounds in 3 months, while not impossible, should be viewed cautiously. Such results likely depend on various factors including diet, exercise, and individual metabolism, rather than solely on the supplement.

# Comparison with Other Weight Loss Methods

The article mentions Java Burn in the context of other weight loss methods, specifically Ozempic and Wegovy. These are prescription medications used for treating obesity and have shown significant results in clinical trials. However, they also come with potential side effects and require medical supervision.

Java Burn, as a dietary supplement, operates in a different regulatory space and should not be directly compared to prescription medications. While it may offer a more accessible option, its effects are likely to be much more modest compared to pharmaceutical interventions.

# Potential Risks and Side Effects

The article does not appear to discuss potential risks or side effects in depth, which is a significant omission. Even natural ingredients can have side effects or interact with medications. Some considerations:

* Caffeine content: Green tea extract contains caffeine, which could lead to jitters, insomnia, or other caffeine-related side effects, especially when combined with coffee.
* Interactions: Ingredients like chromium may interact with certain medications.
* Individual sensitivities: Some people may be sensitive to specific ingredients, leading to digestive issues or allergic reactions.

The lack of discussion about potential risks in the marketing materials is concerning and highlights the need for consumers to consult with healthcare providers before starting any new supplement regimen.

# Analysis of Marketing Strategy

Java Burn's marketing strategy appears to focus on convenience and the promise of effortless weight loss. Key elements include:

1. Integration with daily coffee routine
2. Claims of taste neutrality
3. Emphasis on natural ingredients
4. Availability on both Amazon and the official website

The dual availability on Amazon and the official website is interesting. While Amazon presence can increase visibility and trust, the official website likely offers better margins for the company. The strategy of offering bulk discounts on the official site is a common tactic to encourage larger purchases.

# Publication Date and Information Currency

The article's publication date of October 1, 2024, suggests that the information is relatively current as of the analysis date. However, it's important to note that the supplement market evolves rapidly, and new research or user experiences may have emerged since the article's publication. Potential buyers should seek the most up-to-date information and reviews before making a purchase decision.

# [Click to Buy](https://tinyurl.com/3x5abzx5)

# Conclusion

Java Burn presents itself as a convenient and natural solution for weight loss, leveraging the popularity of coffee and the appeal of effortless weight management. While some of its ingredients have shown potential benefits in scientific studies, the dramatic results claimed in marketing materials should be approached with skepticism.

Potential buyers should consider the following:

1. The efficacy of Java Burn likely varies significantly between individuals.
2. The high customer rating should be viewed critically, considering potential biases in review systems.
3. As with any supplement, there are potential risks and side effects that should be discussed with a healthcare provider.
4. Java Burn should not be seen as a replacement for a balanced diet and regular exercise.
5. The cost-effectiveness of the supplement should be evaluated against other weight loss strategies.

In conclusion, while Java Burn may offer some benefits, it is not a magic solution for weight loss. Consumers should approach such supplements with realistic expectations, prioritize overall health, and make informed decisions based on comprehensive research and professional medical advice.

# What is Java Burn?

Java Burn is a powdered supplement formulated to mix with your daily coffee. Its main function is to supercharge metabolism and accelerate fat-burning processes.

Java Burn includes a mix of natural compounds known for their fat-burning potential and ability to regulate blood sugar.

","This report provides a comprehensive and critical analysis of Java Burn, a dietary supplement marketed for weight loss and metabolism boosting. Based on information from an article published on October 1, 2024, this analysis examines the product's claimed benefits, ingredients, customer reviews, marketing strategies, and potential risks.

# Summary of Key Claims and Ingredients

Java Burn is marketed as a powdered supplement designed to be mixed with coffee. The product claims to boost metabolism, promote fat burning, and aid in weight loss without altering the taste of coffee. Key ingredients mentioned in the article include:

* Green tea extract
* L-theanine
* Chromium
* Chlorogenic acid (from green coffee bean extract)

The supplement is said to work by activating the body's ""fat-burning furnace"" through a combination of these ingredients. The manufacturer claims that Java Burn can lead to significant weight loss results, with some users reportedly losing up to 12 pounds in 3 months.

# [Click to Buy](https://tinyurl.com/3x5abzx5)

# Critical Analysis of Claimed Benefits

# Metabolism Boosting and Weight Loss

The primary claim of Java Burn is its ability to enhance metabolism and promote weight loss. While some ingredients like green tea extract have been associated with modest metabolic benefits in scientific studies, the extent of their impact as part of this specific formulation is unclear.

Green tea extract contains caffeine and catechins, which may slightly increase energy expenditure and fat oxidation. However, the effects are generally small and may not lead to significant weight loss on their own. The addition of chromium could potentially help regulate blood sugar levels, which might indirectly support weight management efforts. However, its direct impact on weight loss is not strongly supported by current evidence.

The claim of activating a ""fat-burning furnace"" appears to be marketing hyperbole rather than a scientifically accurate description of metabolic processes. While the ingredients may have some modest effects on metabolism, the dramatic results suggested in the marketing materials should be viewed skeptically.

# Taste Neutrality

Java Burn's claim of being taste-neutral and not affecting the flavor of coffee is an interesting selling point. While it's possible that the powder is formulated to minimize taste impact, the complete absence of any flavor change seems unlikely, especially given ingredients like green tea extract. User experiences would be valuable in verifying this claim, as individual perceptions of taste can vary.

[Get Started With Java Burn Today!](https://tinyurl.com/3x5abzx5)

# Credibility of Customer Reviews

The article mentions that Java Burn has received a rating of 4.9 out of 5 stars based on customer reviews. This exceptionally high rating raises questions about the authenticity and representativeness of these reviews. Several factors should be considered:

1. Selection bias: Satisfied customers are more likely to leave reviews, potentially skewing the overall rating.
2. Verification process: It's unclear how these reviews are verified or if they come from confirmed purchases.
3. Placebo effect: Given the nature of weight loss supplements, some positive reviews may be influenced by placebo effects or other lifestyle changes coinciding with supplement use.
4. Marketing influence: There's a possibility that some reviews could be influenced by marketing efforts or incentives.

The claim of users losing 12 pounds in 3 months, while not impossible, should be viewed cautiously. Such results likely depend on various factors including diet, exercise, and individual metabolism, rather than solely on the supplement.

# Comparison with Other Weight Loss Methods

The article mentions Java Burn in the context of other weight loss methods, specifically Ozempic and Wegovy. These are prescription medications used for treating obesity and have shown significant results in clinical trials. However, they also come with potential side effects and require medical supervision.

Java Burn, as a dietary supplement, operates in a different regulatory space and should not be directly compared to prescription medications. While it may offer a more accessible option, its effects are likely to be much more modest compared to pharmaceutical interventions.

# Potential Risks and Side Effects

The article does not appear to discuss potential risks or side effects in depth, which is a significant omission. Even natural ingredients can have side effects or interact with medications. Some considerations:

* Caffeine content: Green tea extract contains caffeine, which could lead to jitters, insomnia, or other caffeine-related side effects, especially when combined with coffee.
* Interactions: Ingredients like chromium may interact with certain medications.
* Individual sensitivities: Some people may be sensitive to specific ingredients, leading to digestive issues or allergic reactions.

The lack of discussion about potential risks in the marketing materials is concerning and highlights the need for consumers to consult with healthcare providers before starting any new supplement regimen.

# Analysis of Marketing Strategy

Java Burn's marketing strategy appears to focus on convenience and the promise of effortless weight loss. Key elements include:

1. Integration with daily coffee routine
2. Claims of taste neutrality
3. Emphasis on natural ingredients
4. Availability on both Amazon and the official website

The dual availability on Amazon and the official website is interesting. While Amazon presence can increase visibility and trust, the official website likely offers better margins for the company. The strategy of offering bulk discounts on the official site is a common tactic to encourage larger purchases.

# Publication Date and Information Currency

The article's publication date of October 1, 2024, suggests that the information is relatively current as of the analysis date. However, it's important to note that the supplement market evolves rapidly, and new research or user experiences may have emerged since the article's publication. Potential buyers should seek the most up-to-date information and reviews before making a purchase decision.

# [Click to Buy](https://tinyurl.com/3x5abzx5)

# Conclusion

Java Burn presents itself as a convenient and natural solution for weight loss, leveraging the popularity of coffee and the appeal of effortless weight management. While some of its ingredients have shown potential benefits in scientific studies, the dramatic results claimed in marketing materials should be approached with skepticism.

Potential buyers should consider the following:

1. The efficacy of Java Burn likely varies significantly between individuals.
2. The high customer rating should be viewed critically, considering potential biases in review systems.
3. As with any supplement, there are potential risks and side effects that should be discussed with a healthcare provider.
4. Java Burn should not be seen as a replacement for a balanced diet and regular exercise.
5. The cost-effectiveness of the supplement should be evaluated against other weight loss strategies.

In conclusion, while Java Burn may offer some benefits, it is not a magic solution for weight loss. Consumers should approach such supplements with realistic expectations, prioritize overall health, and make informed decisions based on comprehensive research and professional medical advice.

my mom had been tu* and had d* this past week, but she thought it was from food poisoning so i wasn‚Äôt that worried about it. i was going in & out of her room to take care of her, and we shared some popcorn at the movies last night so i‚Äôm wondering if i actually caught something from her.

however, today, i had iced coffee this morning and taco bell a few hours later so that might have been a deadly combo, or maybe i had overeaten/ate too quickly. 

it happened about an hour ago. after i ate felt super full. and then about 30 minutes before it happened, i was n*, my hands and feet were cold & clammy, i had stomach cramps, and had some acid reflux that was coming up and going down. then it just happened suddenly when i was in bed. (luckily i had my trash can right next to me just in case) it wasn‚Äôt that bad in the moment because i didn‚Äôt have time to react. in fact, i felt a lot better after!! but now i‚Äôm starting to feel s* again (though not as bad as before) and i really don‚Äôt want to happen again. i still don‚Äôt know if my mom & i have a bug or something, or if it happening was just a coincidence.

i know i‚Äôll probably be okay if it happens again, but i really hate this feeling :(

edit: it happened again almost immediately after i posted this lol. a lot more came out the second time. i feel better now but i would like to be done with this ugh",1,1732934199.0,emetophobia,2,1.0,False

1h32hrt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Albuquerque/comments/1h32hrt/mcdonalds_and_numale_cases_compared_and_contrasted/,McDonalds and NuMale cases compared and contrasted,"In 1992, 79-year-old Stella Liebeck went through the drive-through at the McDonalds on Gibson and boiling hot coffee spilled on her lap and sent her to the hospital for eight days, skin grafts, plus two years of follow up.

McDonalds wouldn‚Äôt pay the $20k in medical bills, so they got sued in federal court.

In 1994, the jury verdict heard round the world: $160k plus $2.7M in punitive damages. It was later reduced to $640k, and then it got confidentially settled.

Roughly double all those dollar amounts to reach 2024 equivalents. This case is still required reading at any competent law school.


From the Southeast to the Northeast. In 2017, at the NuMale clinic at Paseo and Wyoming, M.S., a 66-year-old widower from Rio Rancho, went for testosterone replacement therapy because he had low energy and wanted to lose weight.

This clinic did not take most insurance, and was run a lot more like a used car dealership than an endocrinology clinic. I know because I‚Äôve received services there. They gave him testosterone pellets implanted in the butt cheek (I had that done there too) but upsold him on penile injections he didn‚Äôt want or ask for.

It‚Äôs rather appalling what happened next, totally not his fault, and somewhat beyond what my worst nightmares would have been with such a procedure, but when it was all over, they ended up destroying his penis and he lost all feeling and functionality there. He sued in 2020.

The Albuquerque jury just found in favor of Mr. M.S. and set a world record medical malpractice judgment against NuMale: $37M in compensatory damages and $375M in punitive damages, give or take a few dollars.

This is over 100x what Ms. Liebeck was awarded. NuMale is a multi state chain of clinics, but McDonalds.. yeah.

Naturally, this case will likewise probably make it into law school required reading as well, at least until something bigger comes along.

I don‚Äôt know that it really impacts the goings on in Albuquerque, but it happened here and not anywhere else. What does everybody think?",34,1732933962.0,Albuquerque,15,0.87,False

In those 4 years I‚Äôve had about four brief, failed talking stages, which discouraged me so bad I deleted dating apps altogether. For the past year, I‚Äôve met nobody because I work with all adults and do not get approached at bars, coffee shops, or anywhere with people my age. I don‚Äôt consider myself ugly at all, but I am extremely shy and a bit guarded. 

Today I was eating lunch with my mom and an extremely handsome (borderline majestic) guy and his friend sat in the booth next to ours. My mom decided to be a wingman and struck up a conversation amongst us as he walked by to get something about his college (that he was wearing on his shirt) and we discussed a mutual friend I thought he might have with me. The conversation was brief and he sat back down, but a few minutes later he got back up and brought over a picture of the mutual friend on ig to clarify if that was the guy I was talking about.

We had a few more lines of dialogue about where I went to school and what we studied and stuff. Probably the cutest, friendliest guy I‚Äôve interacted with in ages even though it was only about 10 min of conversation. I feel as though maybe he was slightly interested since he came back to talk a little more, but I fumbled so bad by never even attempting to ask for his number, socials, or ANYTHING. Given, he didn‚Äôt try either so he very well could‚Äôve not liked me at all for all I know. It also probably didn‚Äôt help my mom was right there which is a little awkward.

I know that depression is common and i suspect that I have it but it's not so common to where every single person on the Internet has it, and the people saying all of that aren't even diagnosed either so depression has kind of become a quirky thing to apparently.

Ben loves his job, he leads his elite plumber SWAT team(The Alien Force), he the head of the system local galactic enforcers, he the champion of Earth, and he even ambassador for Earth. But there is one thing about job he doesn't like, the paperwork, the at times seemingly endless amount of paperwork. You would think one his super genius chaquetrix girls could help with it but they hate it just as much as him. So they begged him to go out and scan a sylonnoid, a biodroid created for the sole purpose to perform bureaucratic work of all kinds. So he did, and thanks to the chaquetrix having to use some Galvanic Mechamorph genetics in order to created the purely mechanical and technical parts of of their anatomy he got Eunomia. The first fully mechanoid sylonnoid, and therefore the first who can reproduce. Who thanks to her Galvanic Mechamorph genetics is actually better at bureaucratic work then any pure sylonnoid could ever be. And that is something she is truly grateful for as means she can help her family ever. So she a bit annoyed by the fact that she can't help with the kind of fighting Ben and her sisters as sylonnoids simply aren't made for. She can't even learn magic thanks to being mechanoid, in fact only her combat useful skill is that is always calm no matter what. But the fact that her more powerful sisters comes crawling to her do their paperwork(literally).

Intrusive thoughts get thrown around alot also, a lot of people mix up intrusive and impulsive thoughts all the time saying things like ""oh sorry guys I'm letting the intrusive thoughts win today"" when all they're doing is going to a plant store and plucking all of the little buds off of the plants. Like yeah, my intrusive thoughts are scary as hell and make me feel like crap because I'm terrified that I might act on them but sure, you are so quirky bro üôÑ. It's crazy how they are mixed up all of the time considering they are the exact opposite types of thoughts (intrusive thoughts are ego dystonic meaning that they are disturbing and you don't agree with them and impulsive thoughts are ego syntonic meaning that you think it's a good idea and you act on it and agree with it) Or the fact that everyone and I mean EVERYONE on the Internet says they have depression when the only depression they have is the normal amount of depression that people get every once in a while. I know that depression is common and i suspect that I have it but it's not so common to where every single person on the Internet has it, and the people saying all of that aren't even diagnosed either so depression has kind of become a quirky thing to apparently. Trauma is thrown around as well like with the ""trauma dump cereal bowl"" on Tik Tok were people are like ""my trauma dump is I kissed a boy and my sister told on me ü•∫"" or it's just an embarrassing moment that they had in their life. Also how people say that something gave them PTSD or trauma flashbacks when it was just someone at subway tearing up the bathroom one time and they had to clean it üôÑ.Which I mean, it's good that a lot of people don't have actually traumatic or terrible things to say that happened to them but I just wish people were a little more knowledgeable about these issues.",1,1732933508.0,mentalhealth,0,1.0,False

I tried writing a novel a while ago, but I didn‚Äôt get to even finish the very first chapter‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll share what I wrote anyway, and hopefully someone spares a few minutes to provide an honest opinion on it.

As im looking at the sky at six in the morning, the sun rising smoothly, filling the sky with honey rays piercing through the clouds, golden warm sweet nothings feathering across the wings of my balcony flowers, i happen to witness two bird couple kissing and cuddling each other in the middle of a long high conducting wire, not caring about the world, their community singing, their community doesn‚Äôt care about whether if they‚Äôre a gay couple or straight ones, their community just sing smoothly with zero effort, providing peaceful cleansing for everyone‚Äôs ears.
My community cares too much about other people‚Äôs lives, that care stole away every chance of love I could‚Äôve had. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, i did get in involved in love, it just never lasted.

As i look at these birds, i couldn‚Äôt really describe my feelings towards what im seeing. Do i envy their love? I don‚Äôt know. But i do know that i don‚Äôt feel uncomfortable around it. They have each other and that‚Äôs what matters.

I barely wake up early, but today i dreamt about love, the kind of love that heals you, the kind of love where he kisses your neck from behind, where he would be silly about giving you a hickey somewhere where nobody can see it, the kind of love where he buys you a flower and gets you chocolate even though you didn‚Äôt ask him for chocolate; and i remember knowing that i am in a dream, i tried to stay deep in that dream and never get out, you know that kind of effort you put in when you‚Äôre really in a good dream? The effort that you somehow manage to stay dreaming and don‚Äôt accidentally escape it. That‚Äôs how good my dream was. Dreams steals us from reality, they take us somewhere we always wanted to be, dreams are reality advertisement breaks. I woke up, took a shower, i just stood there, thinking about it, about how his lips felt so real on my neck, about how much i miss them.

I made myself a cup of tea, people do coffee, i don‚Äôt, never really craved coffee, tea is like the classic type of drink where its good for everything, for sleeping, relaxing, thinking‚Ä¶ coffee is only good when you‚Äôre in a bowel movement crisis.
Now here i am, standing here, the tea is getting cold in my hands, the morning cool breeze landing on my forearms, making my whole body shiver, but i don‚Äôt want to leave, i like the sound of birds, those few cars that pass making an echo, giving that doppler effect kind of sound‚Ä¶ its just so magical. Heck, now i understand why morning people are morning people.
I grabbed my backpack, checked if i have the correct books for today‚Äôs schedule, put on my sneakers, and headed out. As im walking around the block, i couldn‚Äôt help but notice how the world low-key darkened in these what feel like ten minutes. Dark clouds formed slowly but somehow managed to be‚Ä¶fast? Looking at these dark skies, it‚Äôs like they‚Äôre holding piles of mysteries inside, ready to expose them on earth‚Äôs soils. It started to rain lightly, I managed to get to school before the aggressive wind and rain started. 

First period was english, classmates are discussing and talking about whatever is being discussed and talked about, and then there‚Äôs me, long lost in my mind, drowning in a lake of thoughts and overthinking. Im not really a stable person when it comes to focusing, although i do notice details, i can read people and rooms very accurately, but i guess thats just a good sight. Good focus needs a good stable mind, and i certainly didn‚Äôt sign up for that. 
‚ÄúMr white?‚Äù Said mrs. Hendricks.

‚ÄúMr white will you please direct your attention to me?‚Äù Her voice grew louder.

‚ÄúMr white?‚Äù She‚Äôs sounding angrier.

I felt a pencil on my forearm, interrupting the voices in my head, voices are gone, another voice whispering next to me.

‚ÄúThe teacher is calling you.‚Äù

Huh.

‚ÄúUgh.. yes, sorry.‚Äù I said nervously.

‚ÄúMr. White, your constant zoning out is getting worse, you are missing group discussions, important lectures, and assignments.‚Äù

‚ÄúUhm.. okay‚Ä¶?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou are slowly stepping into the verse of fuck-ups.‚Äù 
She said.

I took a deep breath trying to refresh my mind.
Did she just say that?
What the hell?

The entire class started laughing ridiculously, I couldn‚Äôt see anything but eyes, and the rest was foggy and vague. Laughter echoed in my ears, i felt dizzy. 

Im not really a social person. The total opposite, if invisible coats were a real thing, I would‚Äôve got one instantly. Imagine wanting to be invisible always, and suddenly you became the center of attention. 
World of horror. 
I grabbed my backpack and stormed out into the hallways. The cleaning lady flinched for a second, attempting to make sense of what just happened.
 
‚ÄúSorry. Im a little overwhelmed‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt mean to jump scare you.‚Äù 

She gave me a side look and proceeded with wiping the floor.

I made my way to the bathroom, looked at my red hair, which looked awful in this bathroom‚Äôs dim lighting. I don‚Äôt know why, my home mirror just loves me more than any mirror in this world.


‚ÄúDo you think she‚Äôs just a player? Maybe she‚Äôs just really shy to text back‚Ä¶ or maybe she doesn‚Äôt know i exist‚Äù cherry says.

‚ÄúOr maybe im overthinking all this, GOSH. alex?‚Äù

‚ÄúALEX!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat!‚Äù I yelled.

‚ÄúWere you even listening to me ?!‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù I wasn‚Äôt.

‚Äúwhat was i saying then?‚Äù

Awkward as fuck silence‚Ä¶

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre‚Ä¶ really stressed about the math test‚Ä¶?‚Äù

Cherry gave me the ‚Äúrun as fast as possible look‚Äù.

‚ÄúOKAY. what?‚Äù

‚ÄúJeez. Okay. What do you think about the girl i met yesterday? at launch.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou mean the weird haired-zombie eyeshadow-skeleton earrings-huge-boots girl?‚Äù

She hit me with the eye roll. 

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs okay i guess?‚Äù

‚Äúcould you please just fucking focus and give me a normal complete answer?‚Äù

What the fuck. Im trying to recall what the hell is an integral here, i had a bar of chocolate for breakfast. Damn that tasted nice.

Cherry is one of the most energetic people you could ever see walking this planet. She does this absolutely magical colorful makeup with rhinestones and shit, she‚Äôs just so colorful and joyful, you don‚Äôt look at her and think ‚Äúthat‚Äôs a messed up person‚Äù, she is exactly the opposite, she doesn‚Äôt give a flying fuck about the world, i honestly don‚Äôt blame her, this world is mid and tiresome, her world is just so colorful and dazzling and filled with joy; she brightens up my world, and here she is now busting out her lesbian drama on me.

‚ÄúOkay fine, she‚Äôs great, her style is not weird, I promise you that, she‚Äôs pretty, and she seemed interested in you.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you being for real?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù I am actually.

‚ÄúOkay, thank you.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut-‚Äú

‚ÄúOh no.‚Äù She said.

Huh?

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a ‚Äòbut‚Äô ?‚Äù

‚ÄúCould you just shut up for a second?‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay continue Mr. therapist with a ph.d in lesbian relationships‚Äù

I need a massive creamy cake so bad right now, specifically for face smashing.

‚ÄúYou got to be less creepy when it comes to Instagram, you can‚Äôt just follow her and start sending her memes and stories and randomly cry about the trauma you got after you lost your parrot‚Ä¶‚Äù

She went silent for a moment. She knew i was right.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right.‚Äù She said.

Okay‚Ä¶

‚ÄúBut i just got really excited and nervous and really overwhelmed, I‚Äôll just unfollow.‚Äù

Oh my god.

‚ÄúNo. Cherry, honey, you don‚Äôt have to unfollow, maybe ask her for her number today, don‚Äôt be so pushy, just ask politely with a smile, and if she doesn‚Äôt show interest, she‚Äôll let you know.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou really think so?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy is your plate still full?‚Äù She asks.

‚ÄúIm just not hungry.‚Äù

‚ÄúDid you have breakfast this morning?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

‚ÄúI swear to god if you say you had a bar of chocolate for breakfa-‚Äú

I grabbed my bag and ran out in what seems like a millisecond. 

‚ÄúMr. White, im gonna need you to stop running around the campus like a raccoon who‚Äôs looking for its mother.‚Äù Principal Peyton says. 

‚ÄúIm sorry, I was just going to-‚Äú

‚ÄúIm gonna need to see you in my office.‚Äù She interrupted.

‚ÄúBut i said i was sorry?‚Äù

‚ÄúThis isnt regarding your animal-running instincts. It‚Äôs about your academic life around here.‚Äù

Oh No. I don‚Äôt feel easy about where this is going.
My grades are decent, what is going on?

‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúSee you Mr. White.‚Äù  Principal Peyton said.

As im walking through the school‚Äôs corridors i met cherry on the way.

‚ÄúSo what‚Äôs going on with you?‚Äù Asked cherry.

Her lipstick was smudged all over her chin and right below her nostrils.
Has she even looked in the bathroom mirror?

‚ÄúNo, whats going on with YOU?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúWhats up with me?‚Äù She said, nervously.

‚ÄúDid you even look in a bathroom mirror?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy whats wrong?‚Äù She asked.

‚ÄúCherry darling your lipstick is smudged.‚Äù I said 

‚ÄúOh that. Well‚Ä¶‚Äù 

‚ÄúOh my god?‚Äù I interrupted.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll tell you everything i promise.‚Äù She said blushing.
Oh god.

‚ÄúNow tell me what‚Äôs up with you? You look a bit concerned.‚Äù She said.

‚ÄúThe principal called me into her office.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh what does that old gremlin want now?‚Äù She asked.

‚ÄúSomething about my academic work and whatever.‚Äù 

‚ÄúOh good luck i guess‚Ä¶ please try not to murder her.‚Äù 

She requested in a sarcastic manner.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll make sure I‚Äôll do that.‚Äù I said, sarcastically, too.

‚ÄúThen i guess I‚Äôll see you after school love.‚Äù She kissed my cheek and rubbed my hair like im some red hair golden retriever. I was, in fact,  a red hair.

‚ÄúSee you honey, it‚Äôs carol right?‚Äù I said as she was leaving.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt spoil the tea now babes.‚Äù She yelled as she was walking down the hallway.

We giggled and I headed back in the opposite direction towards principal Peyton‚Äôs office.

*‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a fucking animal, Tom.‚Äù*¬†

Cassandra, volatile with rage, tossed her husband‚Äôs cell phone to the floor of their bedroom, intending for the device to clatter and crash melodramatically when it connected with the wood tile. It landed screen-up and spun towards Tom‚Äôs feet, gliding smoothly against the ground like an air hockey puck. He hastily bent over to stop his phone‚Äôs forward motion, pocketing it without looking at the screen. Tom already knew what pictures would be opened on his messaging app. Instead, he went silent and did not argue, turning his head away from her and submissively placing his hands in the air. The motion was meant to represent a white flag of surrender, but more than that, it was a way of admitting guilt without asking for forgiveness.¬†

Wordlessly, he pushed past his wife to grab a pillow from his side of the bed and then paced quickly out of the room. Tom turned right as he exited, carefully stepping over a few unopened moving boxes to make his way to their new home‚Äôs staircase. With a sound like rolling thunder, he stomped and pounded each foot against every step on his way up. Every petulant boom reverberated and echoed in Cassandra‚Äôs mind. When Tom reached the attic, he bellowed something that was clearly meant to be a defamatory finale to his boyish tantrum, but she couldn‚Äôt make out exactly what he said from where she still stood motionless in the bedroom. At that moment, any lingering regret about dosing her husband for the first time that morning with the Curandero‚Äôs poison evaporated from her, remorse made steam by the molten heat of her seething anger.¬†

‚Äî---------------------------

*‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm an animal, you‚Äôre a goddamned blood-sucking leech, Cassandra!‚Äù*¬†

Tom‚Äôs retreat from his wife had been both unanticipated and expeditious. To that end, he could not think of a retort to her jab until he was three steps out of the bedroom, but he held onto the retort until he reached the safety of the attic‚Äôs doorframe. He knew he could belt out his meager insult from that distance without fear of an additional counteroffensive. As soon as the words spilled from his mouth, he tumbled past the threshold into the attic and slammed the door behind him.¬†

It wasn‚Äôt his fault Shiela was swooning over him, Tom smugly mused. She had volunteered those digital pinups of her own volition. That said, he had been actively flirting with the young secretary since the couple landed in Texas two months ago. Their marriage had been in a death spiral for years, in no small part due to Tom‚Äôs cyclical infidelity. The cross-country move had been a last-ditch attempt at resuscitating their relationship, but of course, Maine was never the problem to begin with, so the change of scenery mended nothing. In his middle age, Tom developed a gnawing desire to feel warm-blooded and virile. Cassandra‚Äôs despondency had the exact opposite effect. She made him feel undesired - sexually anemic. That night was not the first time he had called her a ‚Äúblood-sucking leech‚Äù for that very reason. However, if Tom had been gifted the power of retrospection, he may have noticed that his wife‚Äôs frigid disposition became the norm after the discovery of his second affair, not after his first.¬†

‚Äî---------------------------

*‚ÄúI want something that will make him feel even a small fraction of the insanity he‚Äôs put me through‚Äù*

Cassandra whispered to the Curandero, visually scanning the entire antique store for possible interlopers or undercover police officers before she asked the purveyor of hexes standing behind the counter for anything definitive and incriminating. Multiple family members had recommended this unassuming shop on the outskirts of downtown Austin for an answer to Tom‚Äôs beastliness. The apothecary grinned and asked her to wait a moment, turning to enter a backroom concealed by a red silk curtain. The witch doctor was not what Cassandra expected - she couldn‚Äôt have been older than thirty, and she certainly did not present herself like a practitioner of black magic. No cataracts, scars or gemstone necklaces - instead, she sported an oversized gray turtleneck with part of a floral sundress peeking out from the bottom.¬†

She returned seconds later, tilted her body over the counter, and handed Cassandra a vial no bigger than a shot glass. Inside the vial were innumerable tiny blue crystals. They were slightly oblong and transparent, looking like the illegitimate children of rock candy and fishfood. The Curandero cheerily instructed Cassandra to give her husband the entire ampule‚Äôs contents over the course of about three days. As she left the store, the shopkeeper cryptically reassured Cassandra that her husband would be thoroughly educated on his wrongdoings by the loving kiss of retribution.¬†

‚Äî---------------------------

*‚ÄúWhy is it so fucking cold up here‚Äù*

Tom mumbled to himself, doing laps around the perimeter of his makeshift sleeping quarters in the attic. It had been approximately three weeks since their argument and his subsequent relocation. At first, he didn‚Äôt much mind it. The cold war between him and Cassandra was taxing, but he had his phone and Shiela‚Äôs escalating solicitations to keep him company. But as of the last few days, he had begun to feel progressively unwell - feverish and malaised. Then he noticed the small lump on the underside of his left wrist.¬†

It was about the size of a dime, skin-colored, immobile, and profoundly itchy. Tom felt like he spent almost every waking minute massaging the area. The irritation then became accompanied by white-hot burning pain, gradually extending up his arm as the days passed. One night, as he scratched the area, the lump moved a centimeter closer to his palm. He paused to inspect the change, assuming the vexing cyst had finally been dislodged and neutralized. After a few seconds, however,¬† it moved again - but in the opposite direction and without Tom‚Äôs help. And then again, slightly further up his forearm. Revitalized by panic and confusion, he began clawing recklessly at the lump, until the skin broke and a small black button was liberated from the wound, only to scurry away to an unseen sanctuary. Tom thought the button looked and moved like a deer tick.¬†

‚Äî---------------------------

*‚ÄúSure, Tom, come back down. But to the couch, for now, okay?‚Äù*

Cassandra had accepted many empty apologies from Tom before, but something about this most recent one felt slightly more sincere. By this point, she had completely forgotten about the Curandero and her vengeful prescription. Cassandra had gone through with slipping the contents into Tom‚Äôs coffee over the course of three days, but that was over a month ago. At the time, she did not really believe it was black magic - she assumed it was a military-grade laxative or some other, ultimately benign, poison.¬†

The more she thought about Tom‚Äôs behavior, however, she came to realize that she may have been mistaking a sincere apology for what was actually fear and need for comfort. Cassandra had not interacted much with Tom in the past few weeks, but now that she was, he was certainly acting off. Seemingly at random, he would slam his palm down on himself or something else in front of him and then would be unwilling to give an explanation. He slurred his words like a drunken sailor, but as far she could tell, he hadn‚Äôt been drinking. When she looked into Tom‚Äôs eyes to find that his pupils were rapidly dilating and constricting like black holes on the verge of collapse, the realization hit like a lightning strike up her spine. Cassandra remembered the vial with the blue crystals.¬†

She was at the Curandero‚Äôs shop within the hour, catching the witch doctor right as she was locking up her store. Cassandra pleaded with her for an antidote to whatever magic or venom was now in Tom‚Äôs system. In response, the shopkeeper produced another identical vial from her jacket pocket, twisted the cap off, and dropped a few of the crystals into her mouth:

*‚ÄúIt‚Äôs dyed salt, my love‚Äù*¬†the Curandero said, then pausing to tap out a few fragments onto the backside of Cassandra‚Äôs hand as a means to corroborate her claim.¬†*‚ÄúI don‚Äôt sell power, just the idea of power. Whatever you made manifest, I only provided the inspiration‚Äù*

Confused and without clear direction, Cassandra returned home to check on her husband.¬†

‚Äî---------------------------

Tom had never been thirstier in his entire life, but he could not drink. Every time he poured himself water, he carefully inspected it through the transparent glass, only to find it contaminated with hundreds of ticks - an entire galaxy of black stars drifting aimlessly through the liquid microcosm. Sitting at his kitchen table with his head in his hands, Tom cried out in agony, only to have his wail cut short by his vocal cords unexpectedly snapping shut.¬†

What had started as an infestation had become a plague.¬†

The gentle touch of a hand on his shoulder nearly scared him half to death, causing him to jump back off his chair and knock the infested glass off the table and onto the kitchen floor, shattering it instantly. He took a breath, seeing that it was only Cassandra, but that relief was short-lived when he looked back down to see an armada of nymphs moving on his position. He yelped and scrambled on top of a cabinet. His wife moved forward, seemingly to comfort him. When she held his hand, Cassandra noticed the open wound where that first tick had sprouted, and she rushed into the other room to procure bandages. For a moment, Tom felt safe. His wife began attending to his wound while he was still perched on the cabinet. But then he felt a pinch on his left wrist, followed by an intense lacerating sting, and then finally, the sensation of warm fluid gushing down his palm. When he looked down, his wife looked up at him in tandem.¬†

Cassandra‚Äôs mouth had mutated into a pulsating arena of hooked teeth, with plasma delicately dripping from the barbs she had just used to bite into him. In one swift motion, Tom pivoted his torso, unsheathed a blade from a nearby knife block, drove it deep into the creature‚Äôs abdomen, and sprinted out the house and into the street.¬†

‚Äî---------------------------

Cassandra nearly bled out on her kitchen floor, but a neighbor heard the commotion and had called the police.¬†

She awoke in the ICU surrounded by family. When she asked them what happened, they paused awkwardly and traded solemn expressions with each other instead of explaining. When Cassandra pressed for information, they flagged down her doctor from the hallway.

The physician did not mince words with Cassandra. Tom was dead - he had been picked up by the police fleeing the neighborhood but had been delivered to the same ICU she was currently in when he started to wheeze violently and turn blue.¬†¬†

*‚ÄúDo you have any pets, dogs especially?‚Äù*¬†The doctor asked.¬†*‚ÄúWhere in your house do you and your husband sleep? Have you ever seen any bats in your home?‚Äù*

Cassandra explained that they had bought their home recently, that Tom had been sleeping alone in their attic after a particularly nasty argument, and that she had seen a bat fly out a window once when they were moving in. She then detailed her husband‚Äôs odd behavior in the time leading up to her assault.¬†

The physician frowned and then elaborated on their suspicions:

*‚ÄúThe dilating pupils, the hallucinations, the fear of water, and the inspiratory spasms - they all suggest that your husband contracted rabies while living in your attic. Most of the time, people in the US contract the disease from a dog bite. However, bats are known to transmit the disease, too. What‚Äôs worse - if bats are in your home, they can bite you in your sleep without you waking up. If contracted, the disease is universally fatal, and there is no known treatment.*¬†

*Tom died from his airway spasms.*¬†

*You nearly died, too - from blood loss. Did you know you have an extremely rare blood type? AB negative. Only 1% of the population has this blood type, and unfortunately, the hospital has been critically low on replacement blood that is AB negative for almost a month now.*¬†

*We were initially very concerned - you needed more AB negative blood than we had, but as serendipity would have it, Tom was AB negative as well. Imagine that.*¬†

*Thankfully, rabies cannot be contracted through the blood - only through saliva. That‚Äôs why it is contracted through bites. Although it was unconventional, our administration gave us the green light to give you a large portion of his blood. In essence, Tom‚Äôs blood saved your life‚Äù*

The doctor paused, waiting patiently for whatever questions Cassandra had.¬†

But she had none. Instead, there was an eerie, uncomfortable silence for almost a minute.

Then, Cassandra tilted her head back, closed her eyes, wept, and had a very long laugh.¬†

I‚Äôm looking to make a cold brew concentrate that I can drink straight without diluting, kind of like a pot of Americano coffee. What ratio (coffee to water) should I use for something that‚Äôs not too strong but still smooth and flavorful?
