It was built in 1892 and was just a LOT of work for me. I‚Äôm having regrets though, even with how much stress it gave me. The location was incredible, right next to a canyon and a coffee shop and with great access to everything I liked, and I loved the yard. I‚Äôm still in it with a leaseback until the end of June. 

I know there‚Äôs no sense dwelling but is the regret normal? 

Also, I just need some advice about what to do next. I have a new construction townhouse that I‚Äôve put earnest money on (2,500) but it‚Äôs far from my current location, out a ways and not as close to everything I like. Good news is the area is growing really fast, so the property will likely appreciate just as quickly. I can dip in two years if I need to, but also it means construction around me as they build a connecting freeway, more houses, etc. But it will be quite an adjustment, even with it being new construction. And I‚Äôm freaking out over the interest rates because over the last two weeks alone they keep rising, so I feel like the payment is going to be a little uncomfortable for me once I lock. I‚Äôm trying to hold out a bit but I‚Äôm not sure. Any pulses on interest rates in the next two weeks???? 

I‚Äôm looking at some plan B‚Äôs up in my area. They would be much older but with a lower payment. I‚Äôm just sick of constant HUGE repairs and costs from this place. And now my timeline is crazy tight. First time selling and I will not ever do it like this again. 

Also, do I just full send it with the new construction spot, accept the risks, and live frugally? Try to rent a room? Do I rent in the interim myself? Just need some advice rn. 

I‚Äôm going to a look at a few more places tomorrow in my own area but there‚Äôs nothing new up here and I‚Äôm feeling backed into a corner. What‚Äôs done is done but I don‚Äôt want to make more decisions I‚Äôll regret. ",0,1747968668.0,RealEstateAdvice,2,0.5,False

I have a friend I've known for a long time like more than 15 years na. We're close, and I can say we really know each other well.

All of us in the group know he‚Äôs gay, and he‚Äôs always been open about it. He often shares his experiences, especially about hookups sa aming mga close friends nya.

Then one day, he told us he wanted to change. He said he no longer wanted that lifestyle‚Äîhe wanted to get married and have a family.

With the help of a Christian group he had been attending and part sya ng ministry, he met a woman. After a few months of dating, he proposed, and they got married.

Now, they have two children‚Äîwho are also our inaanaks.

Last year, around Q4, I helped him apply to my company because I thought it would be better for his family, especially in terms of benefits.

After a few tries, he finally got accepted and started working‚Äîthough in a different department.

I was really happy because now I had someone to eat lunch with at work.

But after a while, something started to feel off. I often saw him outside the building--walking around or just sitting alone in the park.

While taking breaks is okay sa company namen, I felt that, as a newcomer, he should spend more time getting to know his teammates--maybe over coffee in the pantry.

During our lunch breaks, we‚Äôd eat together, but I observed he was always busy chatting on his phone. I assumed he was chatting to his wife.

Then one day lunch time, while I was getting water, I accidentally saw his phone screen. It showed a gay hookup app--the same one he used to talk about before.

Grabe ang kaba ko and I hope sana indi ko na lang nakita. After a few days, out of curiosity (and because I felt uneasy), I downloaded the app myself without any photo or details on my profile.

To my surprise, he messaged me--asking for a quick hookup. He even sent some of his pictures. 

And yes‚Ä¶ it was him. My friend.

For several nights, I couldn‚Äôt sleep. Eventually, I decided to share what happened with two of our closest friends. They were both shocked and saddened, hays. We agreed to meet up with our friend and planned to talk to him about what we found out.

Since our offices are near each other, we chose a nearby coffee shop as our meeting place.

But during the meetup, none of us had the courage to bring it up. We couldn‚Äôt say anything--nothing at all.

We just asked how work and family life were going, and said, ‚ÄúIf you ever need support, we‚Äôre here for you.‚Äù

And that was it. We left without saying what really needed to be said. We just messaged each other na ang hirap sabihin, hoping that he would sense we already know. Mahiya ba.

Also we are afraid that saying something might cause his family to fall apart.

This all happened last January.

Life went on, and I continued treating him the same way. I just got a bit busy these past few months with business trips, so I wasn‚Äôt able to join him for lunch as often.

But I always believed it was just a phase he needed to go through‚Äîand that eventually, he would stop.

Yesterday, out of curiosity (again), I downloaded the app just to check.  And there he was--still on it.

Previous Attempts: We tried confront him, but honestly, it was just too difficult--we didn‚Äôt know how to even begin.

Just some background information on me: I have ADHD and some neurodivergent traits, but that's never stopped me from making close friends. I do prefer small groups and forming close bonds with a few people. I started my program back in January and made a few friends but I got really close to two people. I would even consider her one of my best friends and she failed out unfortunately. The other girl I got close to was super fun to be around. She wanted me to study with her almost everyday at lunch. We went out for drinks one day and we would joke around a lot. Not going to lie looking back she did seem a little rehearsed with some of her conversations/questions about things but I didn't think anything of it because I thought I was reading too much into it. I would bring her coffee back to class if I went out to get something because that's just what I like to do for my friends. She went as far as saying she loved me and that I was different from all her other white friends. She's biracial. 

We were getting close as friends and I really liked her. So the story is about her. Basically a month ago she just abruptly stopped talking to me or even making eye contact with me at all (basically borderline micro-aggressions) literally the day after I told her about what was bothering me with my partner's situation. Btw she asked me about it I didn't just discuss it randomly. Basically my partner is a physician that has substance abuse disorder. He's been sober for over 8 years now with absolutely no relapses. He's been part of a PHP the entire time and never harmed a patient. His drug of choice was cocaine and what pushed him toward sobriety was a near fatal overdose where fentanyl was mixed with his cocaine. I was not with him during that time so obviously I don't know how he was but I know that his addiction took a major toll on his family including his children when they were super young. 
To sum it up without disclosing too much detail one of them has violently lashed out at me (literally punched me in the face unprovoked) and is unkind to animals. They are currently in therapy and are getting treatment so until everything is controlled they can't come to the house unless someor. can watch them. At this point he just drives to see them and and stays in the area for visitation, just for my safety and the two dogs I have. Also they like it better because they get to stay at their mom's house which they said they prefer. It is stressful to deal with for obvious reasons so this is what I told her. After that she talked to me about some of her issues and hugged me. Then all communication stopped. I reached out to her after a week and she said it's not like that at all but it's kinda obvious that's not the case. I told my partner about this and he said this can happen sometimes when you disclose that you or your partner has this disorder, but I'm just shocked tbh. 
He's sober and has never relapsed and tbh I don't see how that's even relevant because she's never met him... like what? Apparently people in AA do talk about this sort of thing happing to them and their loved ones. I'm just like wondering why did she even ask? Sorry I just needed to get it off my chest because it's so odd to me that someone can go from saying they ""love you"" in a friend way to being unable to make eye contact with you. Such an extreme switch from one to the other. This hurts a lot because my other friend failed out and now this... she also randomly deleted all the photos of me and her on Instagram, but kept me tagged so it still shows up on my page, but without our photos. Like why keep me tagged? She even started parking in a completely different parking lot on campus. This is such odd behavior. I talked to my therapist about this and even she seems perplexed to the point where she told me this sounds like a personality disorder.

Having stayed at several other San Francisco hotels, including the Marriott Fisherman‚Äôs Wharf, the Fairmont, the Palace, the two Intercontinentals, and the Hyatt Regency, I was excited for my first stay at the Westin St. Francis. It was a mixed experience.

First, the positives:

1. Location, location, location. Union Square is a great part of San Francisco to base yourself. Either for work or pleasure. Almost everything you‚Äôll want to see or do is within walking distance.
2. I was upgraded to a junior suite on the morning of my arrival. I booked a king tower room on points.
3. Rates are reasonable. Both cash and points.
4. The Club Lounge is nice. The selection at breakfast is a little better than average. Smoked salmon, cheeses, fresh berries and fruit, gourmet yogurt, cold-pressed orange juice, eggs, meats, pastries. At night, the offering was also better than many domestic club lounges. Chicken with rice, duck Peking, three types of cheese (and no cubed cheese!), naan bread and humus, etc. Beer and wine weren‚Äôt complimentary. $12 for a beer and $19 for a glass of chardonnay. $12-$14 would be reasonable, but even by hotel standards, $19 is excessive. You might as well go to a restaurant or bar at that price.

Now, the negatives:

1. The hotel advertises itself as renovated, but my junior suite was very tired. Except for the TV, a Samsung TV from 2018, I would guess the suite hadn‚Äôt been refreshed or renovated in at least 8 years. There were no USB outlets ANYWHERE. How does a hotel not have USB outlets in the year 2025? Two electrical outlets were built into each nightstand, but one wasn‚Äôt working. The walls had scuffs and scratches. Ceilings could use a fresh coat of paint. Some parts of the bathroom could use new grouting or sealing. The d√©cor was heavy on browns and beiges. It was the Westin d√©cor that was very popular in the first decade of the 2000s. Nothing about the suite or d√©cor said this was a suite in the historic Westin St. Francis. While they have a lot of historic displays around the hotel showcasing the history and heritage of the hotel, the hotel is a shadow of its former self. The grandeur just isn‚Äôt there. It would have been perfectly acceptable for an airport Westin or a Westin in some random suburb. But given the history and heritage of the St. Francis, it was below what you would expect.
2. No real restaurant, besides an overpriced breakfast restaurant. $40 for the buffet or $41 for two eggs with potatoes, bacon or sausage, toast or croissant, and coffee or tea. There‚Äôs a lobby grab-and-go market that feels way out of place. The signature bar is still closed for renovations that seem to be dragging on forever. In the lobby market, a can of Pepsi or Diet Pepsi is $7.25. I honestly don't know how a supposedly full-service Westin is allowed to operated without an all-day restaurant. You'd expect a white tablecloth, fine dining restaurant in a hotel like this.
3. The hotel advertises that it has ‚Äúamenities to match your expectations.‚Äù But it doesn‚Äôt. There is no turndown housekeeping service despite the turndown service being advertised. There are no newspapers. Only basic toiletries in the bathroom are provided with none of the toiletries you‚Äôd expect (like a dental kit, mouthwash, etc.). My bathroom had three face cloths but two hand towels and three body towels. Why the discrepancy? Also, the suite had no stocked mini-bar or even a bottle of water. How does a suite not have a stocked mini-bar? Also missing was a corkscrew. The coffee was cheap unbranded coffee, not the Starbucks coffee you usually get at a Westin.
4. No Bonvoy Ambassador recognition. No in-room F&B amenity or even a thank you card.
5. No pre-arrival email. No welcome letter at check-in explaining hotel amenities, services, F&B outlets.
6. At check-in, the platinum and above Elite Welcome Gift benefit was a choice of 1,000 points or a wine tasting. No breakfast option. I asked and was denied. I then invoked the $100 compensation. The following morning, a manager apologized and acknowledged they are required to offer the breakfast. He offered to pay the $100 but we settled on some drinks when the club lounge is closed on the weekend.
7. The hotel charges a scam resort/destination fee. At check-in, nothing was provided about what is included in the resort/destination fee.
8. Limited staff. No doorman or bellman was working when I arrived. The front desk never offered any assistance with luggage.
9. They have a concierge but the concierge couldn't even tell me where to buy postcards. Seriously? Why even have a concierge if they don't know where to get postcards? And how does a historic hotel like the Westin St. Francis not have its own postcards?

All things considered, once you get past the history and heritage of the St. Francis Hotel, the hotel is at best an average Westin with slightly older or tired rooms. Other parts of the hotel also feel tired and just below the St. Francis‚Äôs illustrious past. The amenities and services don‚Äôt match what‚Äôs advertised nor do they match expectations for a 4-star or 5-star hotel.",1,1747967951.0,marriott,0,1.0,False

Climate Cafe South Brooklyn builds on that mission‚Äîoffering a relaxed, welcoming space for everyone, regardless of age, to come together and talk about climate change in a supportive, non-judgmental environment.

Want to know how much website designer cost? It is tricky question, okay? No easy answer! Many things change the price. I will explain it easy for you.

Quick answer? Maybe 50 dollar one hour. Maybe 200 dollar one hour. Big difference, yes? Depend on many things. Do not worry. I explain now. Some people very cheap. Some very costly.

What makes price go up or down? I tell you.

First, how much experience? New designer, low price. Old designer, high price. Makes sense, right? If designer very good at one thing, like helping shop online, price go up. They are web design expert!

Second, where designer live? City cost more. Village cost less. Cost of living. If designer live in America, cost more than India, maybe. Also, If a website designer do UX right, it will cost more.

Third, who you hire? One person? Small company? Big company? One person cheap. Big company costly. Big company has many people! Also consider the scope of work needed.

Fourth, what you want? Simple page? Complex website? Complex website cost more! Need special things? Like payment? Cost more! If they have to start from zero it will cost more.

Fifth, what work designer do? Design only? Or build website? Or write words? Or make it show up on Google? More work, more money! How many pages? How many changes you want? Design is important!

Sixth, how fast you need? Need now? Cost more! Designer must work fast! Or on weekend! Designer need big coffee!

sheets stuck to your thighs,

hurts.

the cat steps on your belly like it‚Äôs payback

you think,

they‚Äôll finally clean the ceiling fan.
maybe someone will write

of a raccoon in a trash can.

and read Neruda out loud
like it meant something.
now, you swallow Excedrin
like communion wafers
and pray for silence
like it‚Äôs a lost lover.

the worst part?
when it ends‚Äî
because it always does, eventually‚Äî
you feel hollow.
like a fruit sucked dry.
like a woman who‚Äôs just remembered
the rent is still due
and the car needs oil
and nobody ever loved her
the way she asked to be loved
the first time.

and yet,
you rise.
pee.
wipe.
tie your hair up
like a tired gladiator
and make coffee.

because even pain
can‚Äôt take everything,
not today.

1kt8e26,https://i.redd.it/uxtt91efxf2f1.png,Banana-Co¬© | Constituents of the Corporate Managerial Board and our foundation üçåüå¥üè¢,"Welcome to the sovereign micronation of Banana-Co¬© ‚Äî a corporate-themed state. Neoliberalism meets ceremonial governance under fluorescent lighting, and every citizen is a stakeholder, whether they like it or not.

üçå

Banana-Co¬© was founded on March 3, 2021, at 3:33 PM, in the break room of a mid-tier logistics firm after a hostile coffee machine takeover. It officially declared ideological independence from both HR departments and conventional nation-states under the Banana Charter‚Ñ¢‚Äîa laminated document notarized in triplicate and ceremonially fed to a shredder to symbolize liberation from paper-based bureaucracy.

Our motto: ‚ÄúProductivity is Sovereignty‚Ñ¢‚Äù

Our currency: The Banana Token (BNTK)‚Äîredeemable for vague praise or expired office snacks.

Our flag: A minimalist corporate pie chart split into three wedges: Profit (Blue), Loss (White, and Banana (Yellow).

Our anthem: A hold-music loop titled ‚ÄúSymphony in C-Suite‚Äù.

üçå

The Banana-Co¬© Corporate Managerial Board functions as the sovereign ruling entity, which blends Kafkaesque organizational charts with parliamentary theater. It is comprised of the following formally-titled executives, each fulfilling a specific yet often constitutional role:

Chief Executive Banana (CEB):
Supreme Leader and Bananas-in-Chief. Issues all major decrees via passive-aggressive memos. Commands the High Stapler Council and maintains ceremonial control over the sacred Banana Ledger.

Vice President of Resource Requisitioning and Unrequisitioning (VPRRU):
Oversees both acquisitions and subtle asset disappearances. Known for his catchphrase: ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt lose it; but it evolved into an off-ledger asset.‚Äù

Minister of Intracompany Affairs (MIA):
Handles all interpersonal disputes, internal schisms, and the occasional celebratory potluck. Runs the Micronational Morale Taskforce (MMT).

Chief Evangelist of Culture and Humanities (CECH):
The ideological and aesthetic compass of Banana-Co¬©. Mandated to update the Corporate Manifesto quarterly and enforce compliance to Moodboard Ordinances.

Comptroller of Immediate National Defense (CIND):
Maintains the ceremonial Office Plant Brigade and oversees the Banana Ballistic Budget (BBB). Specializes in defensive Thermonuclear weaponry and passive deterrence.

Executive Intern Emeritus:
A perpetual intern with no clear duties or limits. Elected annually by a rotating wheel of fortune and hazed into eternity. Considered the plebeians of the Board due to their consistent lack of compensation.

üçå

Banana-Co¬© employs a lateral hierarchical flatarchy mode, resulting in simultaneous vertical authority and a complete horizontal but permanent cÃ∂aÃ∂sÃ∂tÃ∂eÃ∂ system. Core ministries include:

Department of Forward-Looking Statements: Responsible for all strategic planning, omens, horoscopes, and speculative national visions. All statements are retroactively disclaimable.

Office of Redundant Oversight Oversight:
Ensures that all oversight operations are themselves under oversight. Staffed by pairs of mirrored supervisors.

Ministry of Existential Accounting:
Tracks what it means to be a nation, a brand, or simply a spreadsheet with dreams. Balances metaphysical budgets quarterly.

Commission for Unauthorized Expansion:
Operates embassies in parking garages, mall kiosks, and abandoned WeWorks. Their motto: ‚ÄúEvery Starbucks is potential territory.‚Äù

üçå

Citizenry, Naturalization, and Duties are our top priorities! All members are automatically naturalized as Provisional Contractual Citizens (PCCs), pending an annual performance review by the Digital Citizenship Auditor Bot. Duties include:

‚Ä¢ Participating in regular ‚ÄúMandatory Voluntary Polls‚Äù

‚Ä¢ Wearing ceremonial post-it hats during civic holidays (e.g., Fiscal New Year‚Äôs Eve)

‚Ä¢ Voting in Shareholder Summits that may or may not affect policy

Citizens may apply for special titles such as ""Brand Ambassador Plenipotentiary"", ""Jargon Enforcer"", or ""Sovereign Buzzword Curator"", pending completion of a 38-question onboarding quiz powered by legacy SurveyMonkey.

üçå

Banana-Co¬© recognizes the sovereignty of all micronations, fictional states,, and several rogue vending machines. It maintains embassies via Google Docs and engages in memetic trade agreements, primarily bartering in outdated infographics and GIFs.

Cultural festivals include:

‚Ä¢ Banana Day of Audit ‚Äî A national holiday where all data is declared non-binding.

‚Ä¢ Q3 Revelry ‚Äî Mid-year orgy of forecasts, where spreadsheets are read aloud in dramatic tones.

‚Ä¢ Takeover Day ‚Äî Celebrates the (symbolic) acquisition of rival micronations via emoji warfare.

üçå

Banana-Co¬© is fully recognized by itself and operates under the Jurisdiction of Internalized Sovereignty Authority (JISA). Our sovereignty is defined by our quarterly report, our borders are rendered in PowerPoint, and our laws are best interpreted via Office 2007.

Join us. Obey the brand. Live the memo.

1kt7x3h,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1kt7x3h/beans_and_how_they_changed_a_life_forever/,Beans and how they changed a life forever,"Young Finnigan O'Malley was a connoisseur of the humble bean. Not just any beans, mind you, but the extra-large, extra-savory, ""Grandma Millie's Secret Recipe"" baked beans. One fateful Tuesday, however, Grandma Millie, bless her slightly forgetful heart, had accidentally used a can of beans that had been sitting in the back of the pantry, right next to a dusty old box of what looked suspiciously like glow-in-the-dark fishing lures. Little did anyone know, those lures had once contained a tiny, forgotten vial of experimental, slightly radioactive isotopes.

Finnigan, oblivious, devoured the entire pot. That night, a rumbling began in his belly that sounded less like digestion and more like a distant thunderstorm. The next morning, it began.

His first ""super fart"" was an accident. He was sitting at the breakfast table, trying to sneak a bite of toast, when a silent, insidious cloud escaped. His mom, mid-sip of coffee, gagged. ""Finnigan! What *is* that smell?!"" His dad, reading the newspaper, nearly dropped it, his eyes watering. The odor was a noxious blend of rotten eggs, stale gym socks, and something vaguely reminiscent of a forgotten science experiment. It clung to the air, making the curtains wilt and the dog whimper under the table. Finnigan, however, felt strangely invigorated.

Over the next few weeks, Finnigan discovered his new abilities. The ""Silent But Deadly,"" as he affectionately (and accurately) named his first power, could clear a room faster than a fire alarm. He learned to control its intensity, from a mild, eye-watering haze to a full-blown, paint-peeling miasma that would send even the bravest mailman fleeing.

Then came the ""Gale Force Gust."" One afternoon, frustrated by a flickering candle during a power outage, Finnigan concentrated. With a mighty effort, a focused, powerful blast erupted, extinguishing the flame from across the living room. He practiced, aiming for distant objects, eventually mastering the ability to blow out multiple candles, rustle papers, and even gently nudge small toys across the floor. This was less about smell and more about pure, unadulterated propulsion.

His most impressive, and perhaps most dangerous, ability emerged during a particularly boring school assembly. A wave of profound drowsiness washed over the audience. Finnigan, feeling a strange pressure, let out a discreet puff. Within seconds, half the fifth grade was slumped over, snoring softly. He had accidentally discovered the ""Knockout Cloud,"" a potent, odorless (thankfully!) gas that induced instant, temporary slumber. He quickly learned to deploy it with precision, saving it for truly dire situations.

As Finnigan grew, so did his mastery. He became known as ""Captain Flatulence,"" a masked hero who used his unique abilities for good. He'd clear out smoky buildings with a well-placed ""Gale Force Gust,"" incapacitate villains with a precise ""Knockout Cloud,"" and, when truly necessary, unleash a ""Silent But Deadly"" so potent it would make even the toughest criminals confess their sins just to escape the stench.

He never forgot his humble beginnings, often carrying a small, empty can of Grandma Millie's beans as a reminder. And though his powers were unconventional, Captain Flatulence proved that even the most unexpected gifts could be used to save the day, one heroic toot at a time.

Captain Flatulence wasn't your typical caped crusader. He didn't swing from skyscrapers or fly faster than a speeding bullet. His uniform was a discreet, dark jumpsuit, and his mask was more about keeping his identity secret than looking flashy. His greatest weapon was his discretion, his timing, and, of course, his unparalleled gaseous arsenal. He operated mostly at night, a phantom of fragrant justice, often leaving behind nothing but a faint, lingering aroma of victory.

One sweltering summer evening, the city was plagued by the notorious ""Stink Bomb Bandit."" This villain, a disgruntled former perfume chemist, had been unleashing vile, chemical-based odors across the downtown area, forcing businesses to close and sending citizens scrambling for gas masks. The latest attack was at the annual City Fair, where the Bandit had unleashed a truly horrifying concoction that smelled like a thousand unwashed gym bags left in a dumpster fire. Panic was setting in.

Captain Flatulence arrived on the scene, his nose wrinkling beneath his mask. This was a challenge he was born for. He located the Bandit, who was cackling maniacally atop the Ferris wheel, preparing another noxious canister. ""You think *your* stench is bad, fiend?"" Captain Flatulence muttered, taking a deep, fortifying breath. He focused, channeling every ounce of bean-fueled power. With a barely audible *phsssst*, he unleashed his most powerful ""Silent But Deadly."" It wasn't just a smell; it was an *experience*. The Bandit, mid-cackle, inhaled deeply. His eyes widened, then rolled back in his head. He clutched his throat, gagging, before slumping unconscious against the Ferris wheel's railing, utterly overwhelmed by the sheer, unadulterated *awfulness* of Captain Flatulence's signature scent. The crowd, initially horrified by the Bandit's attack, now found themselves subtly, inexplicably, feeling a strange sense of relief, as if the air had been‚Ä¶ *cleansed* by something even more potent.

Another time, Captain Flatulence faced a more aerodynamic threat: ""The Vulture,"" a villain who soared through the skies on mechanical wings, snatching priceless artifacts from high-rise buildings. The Vulture had just grabbed the legendary ""Diamond of Dazzle"" from the top floor of the city's tallest tower and was making his getaway. Police helicopters were too slow, and traditional heroes couldn't get close enough.

Captain Flatulence knew what he had to do. He scaled a nearby building, positioning himself on the rooftop directly in the Vulture's flight path. As the winged menace approached, gloating over his prize, Captain Flatulence timed it perfectly. With a mighty, controlled expulsion, he unleashed a concentrated ""Gale Force Gust."" It wasn't a wide, dispersed cloud, but a focused, invisible cannonball of air. The gust hit the Vulture square in his mechanical wings, throwing him off balance. He wobbled, screeched, and then, with a desperate flap, lost control, spiraling downwards. Before he could hit the ground, Captain Flatulence followed up with a quick, precise ""Knockout Cloud,"" ensuring the villain landed softly (and asleep) in a conveniently placed dumpster below, the Diamond of Dazzle still clutched in his unconscious hand.

Life as Captain Flatulence wasn't all grand battles and triumphant aromas. There were the mundane challenges: avoiding bean-heavy meals before important social events, explaining away suspicious drafts in enclosed spaces, and the constant fear of a sudden, uncontrolled emission at an inopportune moment. He had to meticulously plan his ""fuel"" intake, favoring lean proteins and vegetables during the day, reserving his beloved beans for his nightly patrols. His secret identity, Finnigan O'Malley, a mild-mannered librarian, was a perfect cover. Who would suspect the quiet man who always seemed to have a faint, earthy scent about him?

One particularly tricky situation arose when the city's main sewage plant was sabotaged by the eco-terrorist group, ""The Green Sludge."" They had clogged the system, threatening to flood the entire lower district with raw sewage. The city was in chaos, the stench unbearable. Traditional methods of clearing the massive blockages were failing, and the pressure was building, literally.

Captain Flatulence arrived at the scene, the air thick with an odor that even *he* found challenging. This wasn't just about incapacitating a villain; it was about a full-scale environmental disaster. He descended into the labyrinthine pipes, navigating the dark, foul-smelling tunnels. He found the central blockage: a monstrous, congealed mass of waste and debris. Taking a deep breath, he prepared for his most extreme application of the ""Gale Force Gust."" This wouldn't be a precise shot; it would be a sustained, powerful expulsion of air, a sonic boom of pure, unadulterated wind. He braced himself, focused his internal energy, and unleashed a torrent. The sound was deafening, a low, guttural roar that echoed through the pipes. The sheer force of the blast, amplified by the confined space, shattered the blockage, sending a wave of water and debris surging forward. The plant workers above ground cheered as the system groaned back to life, the flow resuming. Captain Flatulence, emerging from the depths, was covered in grime but triumphant, albeit smelling worse than usual. He quickly vanished into the night, leaving the grateful (and slightly bewildered) city to wonder what miracle had just occurred.

His reputation grew, whispered in hushed tones among the city's elite and its underworld. Some called him a myth, others a legend, and a few, who had experienced his ""Silent But Deadly"" firsthand, simply called him ""unforgettable."" He was the hero they didn't know they needed, the one who fought the battles no one else could, or would, stomach. And as long as Grandma Millie kept making her secret recipe beans, Captain Flatulence would be there, a fragrant guardian of justice, ready to unleash his unique brand of heroism upon the unsuspecting villains of the world.",1,1747964906.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

She lives in another country and the last time she visited, set her luggage down, had a cigarette and a cup of coffee and then proceeded to clean my apartment saying she knows it must be tough to to keep a clean home when we're both working. I love my mum so very much but no way am I ever confessing that that was after my husband and I decluttered and changed for two weeks straight before her visit üòÜ.

I have a week off work next week and I need some sort of plan and the motivation to do something about my apartment. My mum always kept our home spotless and I feel lousy that I'm living in such a messy home now. 

I'm in my later 40s and I work about 45hours a week. I'm the sole breadwinner as my husband is clinically depressed. He  helps with the chores, especially if I specifically request help with it but most of the time, I think his depression makes it feel as if he can only muster the energy to get out of bed and take care of himself before I come home. 

I've always been the lazy sort and I'm afraid my apartment has gotten rather cluttered and messy. There's no bugs or stinky food or clothes etc but it's certainly dusty and dirty. When I come home from work, I feel so drained that I can only manage the bare minimum and it's the same during weekends. I do some basic housework like the dishes, bathrooms, gazillion loads of laundry, floors and then end up playing video games cos I think my life would be so dreary if I didn't have any fun. 

I keep trying to declutter (I have alot of knick knacks and purses) but I can remember where and who I was with when I bought most of these things and feel too much attachment so I end up donating or throwing away so little things after a weekend of ""decluttering"". And with only my income, we pretty much love from paycheck to paycheck so I worry about throwing things away because I feel like what if I need it later and now I have to spend money I don't have to replace it. I don't know how to change that mindset and let go of things.

1kt7rls,https://i.redd.it/oqd1mhvdqf2f1.jpeg,Survivor concept I had based on a character of mine for some reason,"Alright so I have this rat named Nick and I was imagining him as a survivor in Forsaken (don't ask why) so I'm just gonna briefly give what his abilities are and stuff



Name: Nick Roddy



Description: Fast and annoying, like a rat should be.



Difficulty: 3 stars



Health: 25



Walk speed: 16



Run speed: 30



Stamina: 105



Stamina loss: 10/s



Stamina gain: 20/s



Gameplay:

Nick is solely a support mixed with a ""sentinel"" I say that very loosely because what he does is gives a small speed buff to other survivors with Starblox latte while also working as a looper, his speed makes him hard to catch but he's very fragile and easy to kill so any good killer with a ranged ability will pretty much make quick work of him. God forbid a Jason gaping wounds him.



Passives:

Rat-like: Nick being a rat has the speed and frailty of one. +4 to walk and run speed while having -75 health.



Abilities:

Whistle (Q): Let out a loud whistle revealing your aura to the killer, all survivors but Nick get resistance 3 for 6 seconds. Cooldown is 40s. (this ability essentially makes Nick a higher priority as the other survivors are harder to kill except for Nick)

Description: ""Hey come get me, you wuss!"" - Nick



Coffee time (E): Nick pulls out a Starblox latte and chugs it, being slowed by 50% for the duration of the animation (1.25s), he gains speed 3 and his stamina depletion is halved for 5 seconds. Once the 5 seconds are up he gains slowness 3 and his stamina regeneration is halved for 5 seconds. Cooldown is 60 seconds and has 2 uses. (this ability works as a panic button as well as a way to get to other survivors faster)

Description: ""You drink any more of those and you'll get a heart attack."" - Ratticus



Free sample (R): Nick hands out a Starblox latte and it will be in his hand for 5 seconds, survivors that stand in the hitbox trigger will get speed 2 and have their stamina depletion reduced by 20% for 8 seconds. If no survivors take it then he'll put it back. Cooldown when someone takes the Starblox latte is 35 seconds, cooldown when nobody takes it is 15 seconds. (This ability is similar to Elliots pizza throw except you don't throw the latte, you just hand it out and instead of healing you, it makes it easier to escape the killer or get to a survivor.)

**TLDR** \- solid, ‚Äúsafe,‚Äù meal with an incredibly fancy and refined atmosphere and great service team.¬† For someone who wants a treat-yourself meal, and those looking for fine-dining on the ‚Äúout there‚Äù or adventurous side.¬†



**Food**: all precise and well done, here are thoughts on the dishes:¬†

* **Kanpachi ‚Äúmacaroon‚Äù** bite // really great opener, good sweet, briny, and fresh flavors
* **Pillow with greens** // nice umami burst inside
* **Anchovies on Potato** // neutral for me
* **Chicken liver churro** // delicious last bite of the opener¬†
* **Strawberries, cream, almonds, caviar** // this was the first of three addons and was delicious and a great balance of moderate almond sweetness, vibrant srawberry, and a generous portion of caviar¬†
* **Shellfish Chawanmushi** // very fresh uni, decent custard and veggie bites to go along (good, not my fav chawanmushi)¬†
* **Rice and Caviar** // Addison‚Äôs signature dish delivers.¬† It‚Äôs like eating the fanciest mac‚Äôn‚Äôcheese with a deep umami, great temperature and texture contrasts¬†
* **Chips and Dip w/Caviar addon** // nice to see an elevated snack food at a fine dining spot.¬† I think the caviar addon added a lot to this dish.¬†
* **Splendid Alfonsino** // this was not my favorite.¬† Not bad, but just not special for me¬†
* **Fish and Chips** // the deconstructed fish taco was incredible.¬† The tempura was crisp, the greens and sauce complimented the dish, and the dot of lime puree was a nice, sharp, kick to brighten the bites¬†
* **Bread and butter** // not a standout¬†
* **Quail Egg drop soup** // throwback to a Chinese classic was novel and tasty.¬† Overall good dish.¬†
* **Quail** // well done, perfect cook and tenderness, nice flavors cooked into the skin.¬† Probably the most perfectly cooked quail I‚Äôve eaten, but perhaps not favorite overall (Kato in LA might take that)¬†
* **Salted Lemon, Sherbert, Caviar addon** // this was good, but would have preferred it with an ice cream over the sherbert, though I understand it‚Äôs a palate cleanser.¬† It needed the caviar for balance from my perspective¬†
* **Yuzu Custard, Kiwi, Matcha** // wow, great opening bite.¬† Could eat an entire bowl¬†
* **Berry tart** // like a berry cheesecake bite, pleasant
* **Ginger Tart, Miso Caramel** // nice balance of savory and sweet¬†
* **Mexican chocolate tac**o // another childhood throwback to a choco-taco.¬† Nice spice balanced the sweetness¬†

  


**Service / Atmosphere.** Service team was very professional, choreographed, and had a good sense of humor.¬† The somm was a bit mechanical perhaps when chatting about wines (we did cocktails instead).¬† Chef Bradley was there on a Tuesday night (kudos to head chefs for being so involved throughout the entire week).¬† Chef stayed and chatted with us for a while and we got to talk about some of his favorite spots up in San Francisco and LA and we really enjoyed that. The atmosphere is very fancy and they make you feel like you‚Äôre in a royal castle.¬†¬†



Overall I liked experiencing Addison, but because it is a bit safe, I wouldn‚Äôt return until a menu changed up a bit.¬† Addison‚Äôs menu seems to harken back to childhood treats and memories in a clever way (chips in dip, caviar on rice like a mac‚Äôn‚Äôcheese, choco-taco).¬† The additions were expensive, 260 for the trio of caviar and 200 for the wagyu.¬† Despite the cost, the caviar addon was good and given the amount they served, it felt worth while.¬† I tried my friend‚Äôs wagyu and it was good, but I wasn‚Äôt wowed and have enjoyed other wagyu more in the past.¬† It was also a generous piece and they spoke about the cows that only ate olives, but for me I‚Äôm glad I went with the quail.¬†¬†

I just cannot figure out why I'm feeling worse and worse (and gaining weight). 

I work out for about 1.5 hours a week, HIT/cardio/yoga etc. I do work from home so I do not move super often besides a daily walks around my house. I try not to sit more than 1 hour at a time. 

I average about 1300 calories a day. My diet is SUPER good imo.  

Breakfast I have a cup of coffee with a tbs of creamer (chobani). I have fresh fruit or eggs. 

Lunch I have fresh fruit or veggies with a cup of rice. Occasionally I will have a protein 

Dinner I eat a protein and veggies. Not really any sides. 

I do not eat snacks. I do not eat dessert. If I do want something sweet, I have 2-3 dates. I am gluten free. It is rare that I eat any processed foods. I try to buy local first, then organic/grass fed etc when shopping. I rarely eat fast food but I do eat out once a week (mostly chipotle). All other meals are at home. Besides my cup of coffee, I only drink water. I don't smoke or drink. I have no health issues I am aware of besides gluten intolerance.

The doctors said the phantom limb sensation would fade eventually. But they never warned me that sometimes at night, I can feel cold fingers intertwining with my missing ones.

It started three weeks after the accident. Gentle pressure against my phantom palm while I slept. I dismissed it as nerve misfires, synapses reaching for connections the chainsaw had severed.

The touch grew bolder. Fingers traced my forearm in patterns I couldn't ignore. I'd jolt awake, staring at empty space where my hand should be, feeling phantom nails scrape phantom skin.

I stopped sleeping.

The sensations followed me into daylight. Phantom fingertips tapped my thigh during meetings. Something squeezed my missing thumb while I drove. I felt wedding rings slide up phantom fingers‚Äîrings I'd never worn, on a hand that no longer existed.

My wife found me talking to empty space one morning.

""Who are you?"" I whispered to the air above my stump.

She scheduled appointments. Therapists spoke about grief and adaptation. Neurologists mentioned phantom limb pain, nerve blockers, meditation techniques. None felt the weight in my missing palm, the pressure of something placing itself there each night.

The phantom hand began moving independently.

I'd reach for coffee with my real hand while my missing one grabbed sugar packets I couldn't see. I'd type with five fingers while phantom digits pressed keys on a keyboard that wasn't there. My body remembered having two hands, but only one obeyed commands.

Last night, I felt phantom fingernails break skin that didn't exist.

I woke with real blood under my real fingernails.

Now I stand before this mirror, watching steam swirl in impossible patterns. The condensation forms handprints with torn edges where fingers end too soon. They appear and fade, appear and fade, each set different.

My phantom hand presses against the glass from the other side.

The mirror cracks.

I understand now. The chainsaw didn't just take my hand. It opened a door between what was and what remains. Between the living and the severed.

My phantom fingers find phantom fingers in the reflection.

They're not mine.

They belong to every amputated limb, every severed piece, every part cut away and discarded. They've been waiting in the space between nerve and memory, reaching back toward the warmth they remember.

I pull my phantom hand away from the mirror, but it won't obey.

A shard of broken glass glints on the sink.

My real hand reaches for it, fingers closing around the jagged edge. The phantom limb pulls stronger now, dragging my entire arm toward the mirror. I can feel other phantom hands grabbing at my elbow, my shoulder, trying to pull the rest of me through.

I raise the glass shard to my shoulder.

If I can't stop the phantom hand, I'll stop the arm that feeds it.",9,1747963776.0,shortscarystories,0,0.91,False

Looking for some roommates to move into an apartment with or a pre-existing room for a July 1st move in (ideally). Also willing to start something a little earlier. Just a bit about me :

* 26 years old, originally from Australia ü¶ò
* Been in NYC for about a year, working for a tech startup based in Williamsburg
* Bit of a combination of an extrovert & introvert ü¶é, always down to socialize, go out, host, try new activities with my roommates, etc but also appreciate my down time to chill and unwind
* Massive music nerd. Always listening to music, producing on my laptop & seeing live music. Considering getting a vinyl player soon so might need somewhere to put that üéµ
* Big sports fan, so always down to watch anything and everything üèà
* Always cooking. I find it mad cathartic so I'm always in the kitchen during the week. Love also cooking for other people, there's no better feeling than people loving your food

I'm looking for:

* Roommates who are clean, tidy & respectful but also know how to have a good time. Super big on keeping common areas in a nice state
* I have a budget of roughly 2300. Probably have a little bit of wiggle room here, but ideally would like something lower than this
* Happy to move anywhere that is not too far away from the L train, whether this be in Manhattan or Williamsburg / Brooklyn

If you are looking for any roommates for around this time or have a room that's opened up, don't hesitate to reach out & comment !

1kt7ei5,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeNewFriendsHere/comments/1kt7ei5/34m_longing_for_intense_and_deep_connection_and/,[34/M] - Longing for intense and deep connection and seeking the casual chat that leads to it,"Hello!

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the US (EST time zone, and with a rather sporadic schedule). My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, life is far more intricate than this. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are emphatically established and developed over time for a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**Also, no hesitations or doubts, please.** If you're at all interested then take the chance. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** My ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way. I seek people who generally know themselves and what they desire and offer. Being lost together is fun, but we each need a self to become lost. The type of connection I want also understands, accepts, and embraces the reality that there's more than deliberate engagement and a handful of interests that make someone up, from mundane chatter to intense distress. The type of connection I want strives to embrace these more grueling aspects of existence in a considerate way.
* **Being high in abstraction, sensation, and an ability to experience things beyond the blunt physical is pretty vital for me.** I want people with a vibrant imagination that are high in cognitive sensations in which such interaction, of various sorts, creates an elated state of splendor. I peak with ideation and abstraction, and seek out others who do as well.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics, which is one of the plaques I've placed above my abode in the Epistemic Wilderness. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and have actively sought out the most peculiar and obscure bits of knowledge possible since I was young. I seek peers in this and related endeavor.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, in which I primarily write about my observations and thoughts. I also adore writing conversationally, and am not uncommonly poetic and intense when doing so. Photography is also something I dabble in, although not as much as I'd like. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, and coffee.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here.
* **I'm INTJ and am Type 5.** I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Are we looking for each other? **Doppelg√§ngers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with. A person who understands that no one will ever be your clone and dares to take exuberant advantage of that fact seems required for the deepest sorts of bonds.** ¬†I'd greatly appreciate a reasonably detailed chat/message in which you told me what within my ad resonated with you, what you're seeking, and anything else you may want to mention; anything dazzling will also do. I look forward to us chatting and connecting around meaningful and fervid passions.",0,1747963305.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,0.33,False

When I was offered my current role, I was so excited about the salary and the company. I thought I had finally found the company that I would be with for years to come (at least until I completed my goal of graduating law school). Past me had no idea how wrong she was. 

  
I am a person who thrives with a lot of freedom, trust, and autonomy. I prefer to be left to my own devices and I get the work done regardless. This is my 3rd remote role and at  the previous 2 I was a top performer while being left alone by management for the most part. Unfortunately, my current role has a company wide issue with micromanagement. 

  
They use a system that monitors keystrokes and mouse movement. If you go idle for 60 seconds or more a timer starts. At the end of every month you are given a score and the score is effected by any idle time.We even have to be careful with bathroom and water breaks. At the end of the day, I feel absolutely exhausted after sitting at a desk, staring at a bright screen, and using my brain all day. I long for the freedom/autonomy of my previous employers when I could take a bathroom break for however long I wanted, take a walk around the block, or even run to the coffee shop around the corner for a refreshment. I feel absolutely sick about how my day looks with my current employer. I am in a senior role but I swear I had more freedom as a cashier at Taco Bell when I was 17. 

  
Am I asking for too much in a role that offers trust and freedom and that judges my work by what gets done and the quality rather than how active I am on the computer. Am I making a mistake by beginning to job hunt after about 6 months here? Am I wasting my time job-hunting because this is the new normal at work places?

1kt7b9n,https://i.redd.it/a7ag216gnf2f1.jpeg,A University Horror Experience,"It Is As It Was

It is as it was‚Äîa normal fall day‚Äîembracing the leaves swaying in the wind and the warmth of the sun on my shoulders. I wanted, as I always have, to live a normal life, but that is not what I got... that is not what I got at all. And from the start, I knew that it was me... it was me all along.

I spoke a speech in front of my peers as I welcomed my position at the University that I worked so hard for in high school. I wanted so much for that to be the endgame of it all‚Äîa tenured position, post-tenure track job at a normal University, in a normal neighborhood, with normal... people.

But normal is a mirage, shimmering on the horizon and vanishing the moment you reach for it.

It caught my attention more than once, not that I have anything against redheads, as I'm a redhead myself‚Äîjust dark-complected with less freckles, kind of deal. The Aryan Brotherhood‚Äîone proudly spoke in front of my class and my dark-haired professor idealized it. I saw it in the way she watched him, her eyes bedazzled on him like 90s dollar tree karaoke microphones. Is this what middle-aged white women fantasize about? Men with hate filled in their heart with a criminal background? Was I in a racist town or am I in a hippie town with racist people around?

Chapter 1: The Speech

The auditorium was half full, the way most university events are. The air buzzed with the nervous energy of new beginnings. I stood at the podium, my notes sweat dripping from u. I looked out at the faces‚Äîsome curious, some bored, some expectant. My voice echoed through the hall as I welcomed them, my peers, my colleagues, to progress in unnoticed space; practiced the speech a dozen times in front of my bathroom mirror. I had imagined applause, imagined respect. I wanted to be seen as competent, as belonging. After I spoke, a woman approached me mentioned that a member in the audience disapproved of the lecture. I hugged a supporter and followed up with my Son who at the time was still small. 

A co-speaker stated that I did well and I wanted to believe her; if not for the woman who approached I would have embraced it. 

Chapter 3: The Town

The town itself was a contradiction. On the surface, it was all farmer‚Äôs markets and yoga studios, murals of peace signs and rainbow flags. But scratch the surface, and the old resentments bubbled up‚Äîwhispers in the coffee shop, glances that lingered a beat too long.

I rented a small apartment above a coffee shop under construction.

Chapter 4: The Incident

It happened, individuals began coming to my home in the middle of the night, angry white men-who all thought they had the authority because they worked a government job; good thing I fought for my rights. I wanted to scream.

Chapter 5: Racist White Witch Bitches

 I sat at my desk, staring at my reflection in the window. The moon hung low, casting shadows across the room as I listened to the white women at my front door drawing a star inside a circle.

I found allies where I least expected them. The organization of the harassment was in a way that I thought only a Scientologist could do, studying the orchestration is like watching a ballerina play for the first time, mesmerizing, the high of being stalked and chased is irreplaceable; I thought I'd never experience it again until it happened; at the Embassy Suites-they'd tracked and followed me and my Son to the hotel-vandalized my room, stole my cat, and paced my door threatening, ""We're going to rape you when we get in there"", at first I didn't notice and didn't think the language was for me until I walked to the bed and went to grab my cream coat and saw fecal matter on the coat which had also gotten on my sleeping Son's shirt. The police were irresponsibly neglectful in the investigation resulting in me filing a notice claim to the city-which went unnoticed until an incident happened again, and this time, on camera with a primary suspect following me to the health clinic...where I was approached by an officer with an ICE name tag and notified by the Denton PD that officer's name is in fact ICE...bullshit...",0,1747963020.0,Gangstalking,11,0.47,False

This week, for me, it was a stranger complimenting my hoodie at the grocery store. It was such a small interaction, but it really stuck with me and gave me a weirdly strong boost of confidence for the rest of the day.

Life can feel heavy or monotonous at times, but these little moments remind me there‚Äôs still a lot of good out there quiet, subtle good. So I wanted to ask:

What‚Äôs one small, positive thing that happened to you this week?

It could be a kind word, a moment of calm, a good coffee, a song that hit just right, whatever it was, I‚Äôd love to hear it. Maybe we can all use a reminder of the small stuff that makes life feel a bit more human.",4,1747962898.0,CasualConversation,3,1.0,False

most of us were probably raised to be goody two shoes or at least trying so hard to fit in because it's what's ""right"" and we're the humanitarian sign yada yada, but we've always had this love-hate relationship with humanity, right? luciferian or sumn. what if embracing that we're not actually good is what will make us better? what if instead of proclaiming we love humankind, we admit to ourselves that we're not this infinite vessel of kindness and feelings? just... stop resisting.

look i know this applies only to saturn-ruled people, but hear me out. saturn is aqua's traditional ruler, right? and i'm not an astro-expert so here's probably where the nerds should butt in to cite some uranus traits that will neutralize the saturn traits i'm talking about.

this sounds like the making of the villain lol, but I'm talking lucifer/businessman-villain and not hitler-villain. quoting from the thread @lettersfromjuno and @widoweaver: ""... 90% of people on Astro Twitter thinks Saturn is this old ass man in a turtle neck judging the world and drinking black coffee!"" BUT ""Saturn is the older, smooth talking business man in a suit who knows the law inside and out. He likes to enter smoke-filled back rooms at night where you might not return the same person if you follow him.""
