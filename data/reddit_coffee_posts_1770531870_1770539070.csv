1qz3fg5,https://www.reddit.com/r/latebloomerlesbians/comments/1qz3fg5/the_most_incredible_night/,The most incredible night,"So I met this woman, we’ll call her S. S and I met on a dating app and hit it off immediately. We both have autism and ADHD, we have so many of the same beliefs and thought patterns, we have similar interests, both have Adventure Time as our comfort show… and oh my god are we sexually compatible. We have insane chemistry. She lights me up like electricity when she touches me. She knows just how to do it too. Slow and gently, leaving a trail of goosebumps as she moves. The first time we met we had coffee together and we hit it off well. I immediately thought she was incredibly pretty and she told me multiple times that I was adorable and cute… after coffee the vibes picked up and we went to her car to make out and touch each other… it was amazing. Just kissing her sent me into a daze. And then I begged her to touch me and she did and I was so. Fucking. Wet. But then… she had to leave to go pick up her daughter so we had to leave on a cliffhanger and I could tell then she wanted me badly. She made it known. Saying fuck under her breath, breathing hard and smiling at me with hunger in her eyes. 

We made plans which brings us to today. I feel absolutely crazy about how well it went. The vibes were immaculate from the start. First off she was very endeared by my muffins and thought it was cute that I baked them for her like I spoke about. We started by watching adventure time together and cuddling on the couch, and she just teased me the whole time, touching my neck, petting me and occasionally slipping her hand over a more sensitive area, kissed my forehead, and just kept saying how adorable I was. And when she wants me she gets so riled up. But she didn’t do anything until I begged her to. (Positive) sex was fantastic. She kept saying how good I felt and I could see her reacting heavily to me doing kegels on her. After sex I turned off adventure time and we started talking and listening to music. I told her I was showing her my soul songs. And she listened to me sing about 10 of them, just staring at me with soft eyes the whole time. She said multiple times “fuck I like you too much” “this is gonna mess me up” “I’m having a moment” she just thought I was so adorable. She said I had the cutest giggle she’s ever heard in her life., and she started affirming me saying I was sweet and cute and funny and kind… as she was getting ready to leave we were standing there hugging and YouTube hit me with: sweet tooth by Cavetown, Boats & birds by Gregory and the hawk, I want you by Mitski, and we fell in love in October by girl in red… all off no wonder I by lake! And as we stood there kissing she told me she almost cried when she watched me standing there singing to my music in the soft light, she said I looked like the most beautiful girl alive. And I asked her to be my girlfriend and she said yes… and we said girlfriend means I like you and I want to keep seeing you. And we said we would figure this out. And then… she kissed me in front of my friend and said “bye girlfriend” it was SO FUCKING PERFECT.

I cannot believe how much time I wasted dating men. This connection is mind blowing. ",1,1770538565.0,latebloomerlesbians,0,1.0,False
1qz3ffc,https://www.reddit.com/r/writingthruit/comments/1qz3ffc/micro_scenes_additional_details/,Micro- scenes Additional Details,"The Highsmith Integration Guide: Refining the Micro-Scenes
 
This guide provides the technical bridge between Patricia Highsmith’s Lesson on Silent Manipulation and your 10-Week Micro-Scene Behavioral Drills. At a master's level, these revision prompts are designed to scrub your prose of ""obviousness"" and replace it with high-stakes psychological subtext.
 
 
 
 
 
I. General Implementation Guidance
 
To ""Highsmith"" your micro-scenes, follow these three narrative commands:
 
1. Manage the Void: If a scene feels flat, remove the character's dialogue and replace it with a Strategic Silence. Observe how the other characters in the scene rush to fill that silence with their own fears or assumptions.
 
2. Monitor the Physical Tell: Never tell us a character is lying or angry. Instead, show us the Internal Friction. Describe the character's jaw tightening, their muscles tensing, or their breathing becoming ""maniacally controlled"" while their surface remain perfectly polite.
 
3. Leverage Affective Alignment: Use a Close Third Person perspective to filter the environment through the character's pathology. If the character is a sadist, describe the victim's pain as a ""curious pattern"" or a ""geometric shift"" rather than an emotional tragedy.
 
 
 
 
 
II. Weekly Highsmithian Revision Prompts
 
Apply these specific prompts to your existing micro-scene drafts to deepen the psychological subtext.
 
 
 
Week 1: The Pathological Liar
 
Prompt: Apply ""The Vacuum."" In Scene 1.1 (The Stolen History), remove the last sentence of Elias's dialogue. Let Sarah fill the silence with her own empathetic assumption about his ""pain."" Show Elias watching her ""create"" the rest of the lie for him.
 
 
 
Week 2: The Grandiose Narcissist
 
Prompt: Apply ""Maniacal Politeness."" In Scene 2.1 (The Interrupted Triumph), emphasize Julian's physical monitoring. While he redirects the conversation, describe the ""maniacal precision"" with which he cuts his steak—a physical manifestation of his need to ""cut"" Clara's success.
 
 
 
Week 3: The Machiavellian Architect
 
Prompt: Apply ""Strategic Silence."" In Scene 3.1 (The Silence), describe the silence not as a lack of sound, but as a ""physical weight"" Marcus places on the room. Focus on how the silence forces Ben and Sarah to become more extreme in their behaviors.
 
 
 
Week 4: The Opportunistic Thief
 
Prompt: Apply ""Aesthetic Appropriation."" In Scene 4.1 (The Justified Taking), describe the silver thimble as if it were a missing piece of Lenore's own body. When she slips it into her pocket, don't focus on the ""theft,"" but on the ""aesthetic click"" of her identity finally becoming whole.
 
 
 
Week 5: The Covert Narcissist
 
Prompt: Apply ""Weaponized Vulnerability."" In Scene 5.1 (The Public Sigh), ensure Helen's ""martyrdom"" is perfectly polite. She shouldn't complain; she should ""maniacally protect"" the hosts from her own sadness, which—ironically—makes her sadness the only thing anyone can talk about.
 
 
 
Week 6: The Sadistic Provocateur
 
Prompt: Apply ""Epistemic Control."" In Scene 6.1 (The Surgical Insecurity), use the close third person to describe the boy's trembling hand as a ""fascinating specimen."" Remove any ""guilt"" from Victor's POV; he is a scientist, and the boy's fear is merely data.
 
 
 
Week 7: The Unscrupulous Social Climber
 
Prompt: Apply ""Mirroring."" In Scene 7.1 (The Accent Shift), have Thomas literally adopt the posture and rhythm of the Duchess's breathing. Show the moment his own ""core"" disappears as he becomes her perfect, silent reflection.
 
 
 
Week 8: The Paranoid Tyrant
 
Prompt: Apply ""The Void."" In Scene 8.1 (The Loyalty Trap), have Silas remain silent after David enters the room. Let the ""void"" of Silas's silence pressure David into a defensive monologue that reveals a secret David wasn't even hiding.
 
 
 
Week 9: The Resentful Saboteur
 
Prompt: Apply ""Maniacal Politeness."" Before Gregory sends the anonymous email in Scene 9.1, write a 50-word interaction where he is ""chillingly kind"" to Claire, offering her a coffee or a compliment. The ""Silent Manipulation"" is the gap between the kindness and the strike.
 
 
 
Week 10: The Moral Nihilist
 
Prompt: Apply ""Affective Alignment."" In Scene 10.1 (The Flat Transgression), ensure the prose is devoid of ""human"" words. Describe the fire not as a tragedy, but as a ""conversion of matter."" Force the reader to experience the scene's physics, not its morality.

1qz3da0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rants/comments/1qz3da0/tired_of_abusive_people/,tired of abusive people,"I sort of knew two famous people in 2017- kirk and james of metallica. it was a bizarre situation and I knew them long distance. They did weird horrid things to me long distance and its a long story which i don't care to tell right now. people don't believe me and i'm not sure why. Kirk and james are psychos who do weird messed up things to women and at the time I did put them on dating psychos.

Kirk hammett and James hetfield are predators who target women at their shows. The things they did to me are outrageous and horrible and they disguised it all as I'm lucky because they are metallica to get their attention in any way even if it's crazy long distance weird abuse. They are controlling narcissists and just psychos. this might be somewhat disorganized because I didn't write it in order and I added some things later so I can remember because I wrote a book about it years ago, but took it down and still plan on writing one and need these details which I just won't remember. Kirk and James work together as some dumb duo and screw women over.

james said metallica 'owned me', was my family and some other strange things at first, before they screwed me over. he once said to me ""do you want to go back to your boring life, or do you want to be a part of metallica.""

I don't get why they did these things to me- lead me on, lied to me, screwed me over, were jerks and other things I can't get into. in 2017, Kirk even told me I was offiicially invited to his house in san francisco, told me his address, and made me fly to go see him. He promised he'd pay me back. He even said to tell someone at the airport that I was going to ""kirk hammett's' house. When I got to his neighborhood, there was a young guy there with his friends telling stories about how he knew Kirk Hammett. I was just thinking ok this isn't a good sign.

When i got there, he wouldn't open the door but kept saying he would. He kept telling me ""go back, I'll open it I promise"" and made me do this like 20 times or who knows. Then he put books and towels under his gate several times as a sick joke, and 'turned some water on' in the yard and later mocked me saying he turned the water on. I was in horror and confusion and figured he'd eventually open the door. I was like what would he get by doing this. I flew six hours and either was stupid or confused or trusted him. He was like a long distance abusive friend or something weird. They think they are metallica and that I was lucky to get their attention in any way even if it was being stood up. Rob or lars werent involved but knew what was going on. Kirk said lars helps him out sometimes. at the time I kind of trusted them because I figured they were famous people but I shouldn't have.

They saw me at their first show- i was right near the front. I had no idea they target people at their shows. They are predators actually. When I went to their second show, james began singing to me and some guy got jealous and came and knocked me out. I was so humiliated when it ended, I just took off though I was supposed to meet them there. Had I met them at their dumb show I'd probably be married to james.

Actually, after their first show, I was hanging out in the audience, and they were just on stage meeting random people and I noticed they seemed like predators the way they were scouting the audience. I just thought- creepy they're scouting the audience for sex puppets or something how weird. I just thought- they wouldn't like me so I took off but apparently they did. Had I met them, i'd probably be married to james or i would have at least been his girlfriend. Kirk and James were the ones who chased me and they have a lot of girlfriends and groupies.

Kirk invited me to go watch him speak in salem in 2017, and had a salem exhibit there, but I didn't think he'd meet me and I didn't trust the situation so I didn't go. He made me watch videos about the exhibit and seemed somewhat upset I didn't go. After that, they began being jerks to me long distance and kept leading me on about meeting them. Kirk made me drive to miami once too claiming he'd meet me at a hotel. It's not that I wanted to meet them they were just leading me on and lying to me. Kirk told me he was 'keeping me on a string' for james, and he was the one I was in contact with for a year. I'm surprised james is dating someone named adriana because after his divorce he was supposed to somehow contact me and meet me and get with me in some way. The things they did were unfair and outrageous. james may have even got a divorce because of all of this- i can't say why but there are reasons. I mean I can't be sure of that but part of it may have been because of this situation. They were playing some kind of sick game with me long distance and they found it all fun.

They took this stupid game seriously, and there's a lot to it.

Kirk told me I was the fifth member, then they purposely officially made lady gaga the fifth member on purpose just to screw me over and they found this fun. They even made frineds with dave mustaine I think as part of this dumb long distance metallica game. Kirk said i'd sing with them on stage but they sang with other people, and Kirk said he'd make me famous on metallica's twitter and hand me a check one day, but he didn't, so they purposely put others on their twitter just for fun to screw me over and try to make others famous or just put them there but not me. They did all of this for fun and once or twice lars helped them out. It's like some weird inside thing between us which makes no real sense.

At first, they wanted to meet me, but then they just found it fun to screw around and Kirk enjoyed dominating me for some reason the way they were doing it. I regret not meeting them at their first show, then they wouldn't have done all these things to me. Then they just enjoyed this weird game they were playing with me. I was just confused and didn't understand most of what was going on.

Its a long disturbing story. Kirk posted things on his twitter based on conversations we had too, so did james hetfield on metallica's twitter. Once in a while james will secretly post things on metallica's twitter that pertain to the dumb crap that happened between us which wasn't interesting. Once I told kirk i liked science so he and lars went to CERN and did a science video and he made me watch it. kirk and james created the 'hetfield hammett experience' and me and kirk would make fun of james and call him old. I was kind of pissed as to why they never invited me to metallica headquarters amongst other things at the time. Kirk used to make me watch videos of him acting as if I wouldn't be attracted to him. They were just very arrogant narcissists.

Kirk invited me to go on tour with them at the time, but didn't really try to make it happen. they just seemed to enjoy messing around with me in some way. Kirk was my best friend for a year long distance in 2017. Kirk even made it seem like he was really upset and sad I wasn't with them on tour but he didnt even know me and it didn't make sense. He acted like he had deep feelings for me. He said metallica was nothing without me and that I owned metallica. Due to the nature of what happened, a lot of what metallica still does has to do with me or it used to. Kirk said he used to think about me 24/7, so he did bad sh\*t to me so that I'd think about him 24/7 too. none of it made sense.

Kirk at the time wanted me posting on forums and on youtube what was happening to me and what they were doing to me to get attention, but no one cared or i got banned. He wanted me telling my dates that metallica was stalking me. Kirk made me do these dumb videos about what was going on and it was just a video of a steering wheel usually because I was in my car talking about what Kirk was doing to me. Kirk wanted me telling people about what was happening so I'd get youtube views, but no one cared and he wanted me doing updates too. Then kirk created his portals videos and in some video there is just someone driving and a steering wheel- he did this because it emulated the dumb videos he'd make me do.

Kirk even once had me write about this on a few websites and got me followers on one website. James wrote a book because I’m a writer too this was several years ago.

Kirk promised me a mercedes and house in san francisco and would give me fake credit card numbers to use and pretended he was going to buy me things from IKEA or best buy. He would create meet and greets and try to get me to get a ticket to go meet him but i didn't try or care.

Kirk one day told me to get a ticket to metallica night in 2018 and said he'd be in VIP. He literally made me get the ticket but because of other reasons I couldn't go. I think that was the time we were possibly supposed to meet or they just wanted me watching them as usual. I did go to metallica night in 2019, for other reasons and lars and rob were in VIP and they knew who I was I can't say how and just stared at me and nodded. When Kirk/James were on the field, they both stared at me and james waved at me and did some weird gesture. I was confused at the time.

Finally, kirk showed me how to get a ticket to meet him at some meet and greet out of my state only because he wanted to meet me, and i just did it so I could tell him to leave me alone or I was hoping he'd treat me with respect if he sort of met me in person. He just stared at me, gave me a dirty look and squinted his eyes when i entered and I told him to leave me alone and he just nodded his head. nothing really happened and I just figured they were jerks and creeps. Kirk used to say that if he met me in person he'd still abuse me. We talked on the phone twice in some strange manner, and i figured out how to delete his voicemail messages from his friends. Kirk did have me take some pics in lingerie and send them to him through text. Me and kirk and james had 'songs' and mine and kirk's songs were moth into flame and some other one I can't remember and mine and james songs were from whom the bell tolls and battery.

I think at the time kirk/james were infatuated with me and its a long story. They literally cancelled their australian tour because of something that happened to me and i cant get into it and finally played in australia recently. They used me as some muse and kirk wont even update his twitter anymore because of all of this. There's a lot more that happened and I can't get into it. They are creepy people and i cant even get into the details. It's a weird situation and is deep and because of how they screwed me over they paid me some kind of homage through their band in different ways, though they did that before they screwed me over too.

They played in abu dhabi on december 6th, because my birthday is december 8th and because I'm associated with the country in some form. They did lots of things like that in the past and played in rockville daytona years ago because its a festival i always go to and they had never played there before. They did a lot of things that were associated with my life i can't say how because i can't reveal some things about them as well due to this being reddit. They created a coffee and skateboard company because of two people in my life long story. I used to tell kirk that he'd fall on stage years ago, so he and james purposely fell on stage and it was advertised in places. James called himself ""old"" on stage several times years ago- that's because I used to call him old. They did this kind of stuff regularly in the past- and found it all fun. if you ever hear James years ago on stage saying ""I think I'm just old"" it has to do with this. It's like some sick twisted game they were playing at first and there's a lot to it.

I'm not sure why they did these things to me. Kirk said they wanted a 'connection' to me not sure why and other weird things. He also said they wanted me 'chasing them at their shows and in the audience' and I didn't have any interest in chasing them at the time. They saw me at their show in 2017. I was supposed to marry james but after his divorce, he began dating some random female, and they ghosted me in 2018. After a year of crap they did to me, they ghosted me and stopped talking to me out of the blue. Kirk used to say it was just 'me him and james' and that we'd have a threesome at metallica night which never happened. in 2019 i went to metallica night for some other reason, and I was in the stands, and kirk and james both stared at me and james waved to me in some way. I forgot about them but sometimes I still think about the weird sh\*t they did to me and it goes deeper than that, and they def still think about me but not sure wtf was going on.

They used me as some 'muse' and screwed me over and kept paying homage to me in all kinds of ways through 'metallica' and the band. At first, they did want to meet me and they did even a year later, but then they were just interested in screwing around. Kirk even started dominating me in some form. If I would have chased them in some way we probably would have met, not that I really wanted to meet them either. I just regretted not meeting them at their first show because then they wouldn't have done all of these things to me.

When I do think about them then I think about the long drawn out story that made no sense and that I can't remember much of but I just wonder why that jerk kirk talked about how I didn't deserve to marry him or deserve half his fortune and it made no sense. Kirk said i'd never feel sexual or enjoy sexual pleasure unless I met him but we did finally meet and he didn't really care. I don't even hate them because of how disturbing the story and situation was overall. Everytime I hear about james and adriana it bothers me and i'm not saying they really give a crap about me anymore or ever did- maybe in the beginning they sort of did, but part of james being with adriana is flaunting that he's with this other female, secretly. I can't describe it but im not saying they desire me anymore or anything, it might be some kind of narcissistic control like oh I got with her so suffer maybe a little bit of it. anyhow, they are jerks and psychos who really f\*ck people over. James is just old and i didn't like them anyway I just didn't think they'd lead me on and screw me over the way they did. I dont' get what they'd want anyway- some kind of dumb control over a female.

there will always be this stupid connection to them and this awful long intricate situation. For people who are like why would they even like you- i cant get into why but there are reasons. Actually this is one of the most bizarre stories to exist and those metallica morons aren't forgetting it either. They have groupies and girlfriends, and james current girlfriend was just a random female. I found one of their groupies online once and kirk threatened me to never talk to her. Due to all of this I just regret not being married to james. I just wish I would have met them at their first or second show for lots of reasons. I feel kind of upset if I hear about james and adriana and think that should be me. I think about them sometimes and when I do i just freak out and think about the story and its not a good situation or experience.

kirks portals video- one of them i cant remember which one is actually just a steering wheel or someone driving. that's because kirk used to make me do videos about this and post them and the videos looked exactly like that- just a steering wheel. Thats how deep this crap goes and how weird these people are.

If you go to Kirk's twitter- it hasn't been updated since december of 2022, and the last posting was of a mercedes. That has to do with this situation and that creep Kirk just won't update his twitter now. Kirk and James both banned me from Metallica's twitter and Kirk's fearfestevil, and metallica's instagram, just for fun just to make it more real since we don't really know each other in person and that's part of this sick twisted game they did to me, though they did want to meet me in the beginning. There is more but I can't remember it.

at some point after ghosting me, years later, James and Kirk did contact me for a brief while, maybe a few days. They told me I was the 'wife of metallica' or some weird bullsh\*t, and were joking around. James said he pretended he ""married me when he was younger"" or wished he could have, not sure why, and said he was the 'head honcho' and the one who really wanted to be with me, not kirk. He told me I was invited to the metallica club and said 'welcome to the club' and said he was still after me, which was bs. But then they disappeared again. There is a lot they do with regards to things but I can't get into details.

I'm just shocked that 'james' after getting divorced would start dating some random woman named 'adriana,' since part of the reason he most likely got divorced had something to do with this. Also, he was supposed to get with me but dated a string of celebrity women, then this other female, which was weird. At the time I didn't care but a part of me is bothered by it now. He didnt really know me in person but we had a long history of things I can't even get into and it's a long intricate story and situation which I just explained a lot of. Then again I dont know anything about their lives, so I wouldn't know how they really feel about anyone or their girlfriends, just the BS they fed me which was mostly lies I'm sure.

I saw a posting showing james proposed to his girlfriend. I'm not sure if it's true but it triggered me or just brought up past emotions about this situation, especially since both kirk and james mentioned marriage a few times. Kirk said he was going to marry me and make me famous, but that was all bs. I just felt inadequate as if I wasn't good enough for him but that makes no sense since we didnt know each other in person anyway.  I mean after everything I had been through, james could have just called me. He literally called some random metallica fan who made the news about something once years ago, and sort of showed me this to rub it in. They did that kind of stuff for fun or kicks or who knows what. They actually cancelled their show in australia years ago because of something that happened to me, and finally played in australia which was some kind of milestone or maybe trauma bonding marker i can't explain.

I mean obviously, they were just messing around. at first, they did like me but then they began dominating long distance and that is because of my sick narcissistic mother who overheard me telling a family member something about Kirk and she tried to stop something between us. Then, kirk began dominating me and it's a long sad and stupid story. Afterwards they were just playing this weird long distance game which they still do and which involves a lot. It's not that I like them either, but I figured we had something too crazy and deep between us and that somewhere along the lines it meant something.

Also kirk and james got used to me being in abused states by family members or me suffering which i cant get into and they seemed to get used to this dynamic which is kind of pathetic. This was years ago. James also felt like an idiot for liking me because random men were rude to me, but here he is some huge celebrity and he seemed to be the only one who. They more than likely don't give a crap about me or ever really did but maybe got used to this dumb long distance metallica game they kept playing for years which is a long story.",1,1770538344.0,Rants,0,1.0,False

I’ve been on Prozac 40mg for around 5 years (including a break for 9 months after a failed taper).

I’ve recently switched to Trintellix hoping for less weight gain (I’d gained 30kg throughout the last 5 years on Prozac without even trying) and better dopamine/norepinephrine regulation.

I had a transition week of 20mg prozac + 10mg trintellix followed by 10mg trintellix alone. I’ve noticed a lot of irritability and rebounding emotions (both happiness and sadness) that were perhaps buried under the prozac blunting effect. Also been very drowsy to the point where concerta & coffee are virtually ineffective.

As a perennial lurker, I've decided to hit the ground running *(poorly)* in search of meaningful conversations on this platform. Whatever tickles your fancy, I'm down to know more about it. So long as it doesn't involve real-life body horror, or a harrowing descent into the pit of self, I'm sure there's a chance we can have a good laugh!

**About me:**

* 5'7"" depending on my shoes, 6'3"" in drag *(ask my legal counsel)*
* Borderline Caucasian, evolves even further under the summer heat 
* Angry writer by day, happy voice talent whore *(layers to this)* by night 
* Into open-world gaming and TV shows (*because we all hate reality to some extent)* 
* Sucker for comedy--the darker, the better 
* Keeper of a treasure trove of useless trivia 
* Caffeinated, trying to cut down by the afternoon since I wake up at 5AM 
* Frustrated parent of four indoor-outdoor cats who hate me *(it's normal)* 
* Currently on the road to getting absolutely ripped *(JK I just miss having great cardio)*

**About you:**

If you feel like these qualities pique your interest, and you'd like to go back and forth sharing stories, by all means, hit me up. Much better if you're also running down the same road of getting absolutely ripped *(or just miss having great cardio).* It took a bit of willpower to get off the couch, and I wouldn't want us both to find ourselves back on it.

If you got this far, kick off your message by telling me why you believe it's fine to enjoy video games in your 30s *(parenthesis).*",2,1770538297.0,PhR4Friends,0,1.0,False

My old friend, Robbie, and I were in a very trauma bonded friend group back in highschool to the point where I almost dropped out trying to get away from this environment and even after dropping my friendship with Robbie back in junior year.

He reached out to me a few months ago asking if we could talk again and I felt completely fine and went to go see him. We chat, hug, laugh- but I still feel nothing even when he confesses to me and I gently turn him down. I don’t feel any urge to hang out with him since we don’t go out for our hangouts and the best thing I’ve ever done over there is sleep at his house but now I don’t feel comfortable doing that.

I’ve also been trying to work on myself more either through spending my free time through hobbies or thrifting my style better to hanging out with friends that I love catching up with during thrifting or coffee and also they’ve helped me network many new opportunities. 

I don’t text back unless it’s schedule important or advice important or it’s my closest friends- and he honestly applies to nothing now.

But the main reason I feel bad is because I promised to support him through a surgery he just got out of and I haven’t busted him once. I can make a ton of excuses about being preoccupied by my family’s health issues as well as mental health issues with my bestfriend-

But it doesn’t change the fact I’m avoiding him, I get at least 8 texts per day for the last 2 weeks updating about everything from his coworkers to his repetitive borednsss.

1qz35ji,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qz35ji,Sagada Ultimate Guide: I am a female solo traveller who stayed in Sagada for 10 nights and tried almost everything (so you dont have to),"Hi mods, sorry nadelete. Ulit :( 

# Reminder before going to Sagada: 

1. Be respectful. Ik sometimes we could be really excited and be really loud unintentionally but please tone it down. 

2. Foods can be really expensive but you have to remember na the only way to Sagada is by land. So they had to drive atleast 4-5 hrs to get these goods and it affects the price. 

3. Support their merchants. In Sagada, you can’t own a business, land, or a house kung hindi ka native. Kung ikakasal ka naman sa native dapat kasal kayo for 20-25 years before you can own something in your name. A native told me this so correct me nalang if mali. Embodiment talaga ng “support local”

4. Go to proper channels when booking a guide. May Sagada Tourism office doon na you have to pay everything. Ik ang iisipin ng iba ay mag direct nalang sa tao kasi mas mura etc. No need to do that kasi nakukuha ng mga tour guides don yung buong bayad. Also, protection din yun sa kanila kasi if something happens sa tour, sasagutin sila ng LGU. Keep the receipts from the tourism office kasi laging hinahanap to sa tours. 

5. Kapag merong kasalan, you can actually go sa reception. I tried twice this dahil sinama ako nung owner ng accommodation ko noong una and nung pangalawa na, I just went by myself at nakakatuwa on how accommodating they are. 

# About me: 

Solo female traveller close to trentahin na so I preferred laid back activities but I’m that friend na sasabihing “lakarin nalang natin kasi malapit lang” but it’s a 45 min walk talaga. I work remotely so signal is huge factor for me. I also visited Sagada before thru joiners and short trips lang like 2 night stay. 

# Transportation:

1. I booked thru Coda Lines’ FB page kasi walang extra fee. Yung with CR. Malaki ang legroom for me (5’2 lamang po ako hehe)

2. Around Sagada, nag lakad lang talaga ako around Sagada. As in from my accommodation to Gaia Cafe or to pottery na medyo malayo na for some pero 30 mins walk lang to for me. I think thats the best way to go pero nag ride ako ng tric to IsangWow cafe kasi 5 am ako pumunta and may kakilala yung owner na naghelp sakin. 200 na balikan then nilibre ko ng breakfast si kuyang rider. Same din ang rate nya sakin when I went to Sagada Shrine for lunch. 

3. I rent a motorbike for a day (1000 pesos for a mio and yes expensive) and isang shop lang ang merong ganto. 

# Accommodations I tried:

1. Misty Lodge: Booked through FB page. Stayed for 2 nights

Pros: rooms are spacious and clean. May hot shower. Masarap breakfast (add on ito). Mabait ang staff (1000/10 for being helpful). Folklore vibe na sobrang calming ng aura ng buong place. They can set up the fireplace for you upon request for a small fee (sakin it was 100)

Cons: Medyo malayo. Cant cook kasi not available ang kitchen. Walang signal (Globe, Smart, Dito). May wifi pero may isang work night akong nagtrabaho ako sa kalsada (doon lang may signal) kasi down ang net. Very safe though

2. Log In Sagada: Boooked through FB Page.

Pros: rooms are spacious and clean. May hot shower. You can cook (walang additional bayad sa gas). May wifi + malakas signal kahit data lang. Mabait ng owner (gave me atleast 35% discount kasi solo traveller ako and I stayed for 8 nights). May convenience store sa tapat na nandun na lahat. They also set up the fireplace for me pero walang fee

Cons: pag umuulan, yung daan papasok ay madulas. Same din pag gabi, wala pang ilaw that time. 

# Activities I liked:

1. Coffee Farm Tour. Nakita ko lang sila nag comment sa isang reddit post last year and I tried it. Must ito when in Sagada. Message them on FB (Sagada Coffee Farm Tour). They will explain to you the whole process of it and may nakatanaw pang hanging coffin from their place so thats a plus too! Almost 2 hrs din ito and more on chikahan session lang. 

2. Paytokan Walk Tour. I almost skipped this kasi di sya chill talaga dahil may trekking involved. Yung owner ng Log In Sagada encouraged me to try it to know more about Sagada’s culture. It did not disappoint kasi ang galing ng tour guide ko. Halos 5 hrs din ang tour pero kaya matapos ng 2 hrs. I started at 6:30 AM. Talagang mahaba haba lang kwentuhan namin nung guide ko. I honestly learned a lot mula sa kung kelannacolonize ang Sagad, bakit nag iba ang relogion, mga beliefs nila, bakit ganon ang food nila, and bakit ganon kastrong ang community nila. If you have to pick one tour, do this instead. Ask questions, sobrang dami nyong matutunan here. 

3. Hiking to Ampacao. Hindi naman talaga sya hiking parang Baguio lang minsan patag then biglang aangat ganyan. But long walk siguro took us 3 hrs. The best ang sunset dito 

4. Pottery. Some would say masungit sila pero for me, gets ko humor nila. Di sila kasing bubbly nung mga teachers sa pottery classes I attended in Makati. Chinika ko sila ng slight and tingin ko it’s because they love their crafts so much na they want the tourists trying it to value the importance of their art. Huge part of Sagada’s culture are from their crafts. The clay that they use in their classes are soil from mountains in Sagada talaga. So ako, binili ko yung gawa ko (as a sentimental girly) because I want a peace of that place in my home hehe

5. Ganduyan Museum. It’s an ancestral house convert into a museum. Maliit lang sya isang floor lang. But I stayed their for 2 hours kasi nagchikahan kami nung bantay (apo sya ng may-ari/artist). Every piece of art in there has a story so please wag tamarin magbasa haha

6. Marlboro Hills. Gawin nyo lang to if di umulan kinagabihan otherwise sobrang maputik which happened to me. Sea of clouds are not guaranteed palagi. Nagustuhan ko lang yung activity because sa guide. A lot of their guides are no read, no write lalo na yung matatanda. But you will learn a lot from them

7. Kiltepan View. Nagmotor ako papunta dito pero medjo mahirap puntahan. Worth it sa view though! It’s a camping site talaga pero merong tables and chairs for those na mg sight seeing lang. I recommend going in the morning kasi mahirap talaga dito lalo pag gabi

# Activities I didn’t like:

1. Any cave activities. I didnt do this nung nagsolo ako but rather nung joiner. Hindi ito yung thrill na gusto ko as a trentahin. Tip: wear yung mumurahin na tsinelas

2. Blue soil. Enough na for me ang Marlboro hills

3. Bomodok Falls. Hindi kasi pwedeng solo lang during my time like hihintay ka talaga ng kasama and super layong lakaran neto and di rin maeenjoy ang falls kasi malamig na

# Food Establishments that I liked:

1. Indigenous Handicrafts and Inn. This is where I bought Etag. Mabait din yung owner kasi sabi ko sa kanya want ko itry iluto but idk kung ano. So tinuruan nya ko how. She gave me atleast 100 grams for free para lang itry. Bumalik ako to buy 2 kg para pag uwi sa bahay hehe. Eto yung exact pin nila sa Maps. 

2. IsangWow Cafe. If tamad ka mag hike and want mo pa rin ng sea of clouds, worth it dito. Be there really early kasi 5 am ako pumunta here pero sobrang dami na agad ng tao. Good food though. 

3. Baw-Eng Coffee Shop. When you do Echo Valley/Paytokan tour, do not skip their shop. Sarap ng kakanin. Sarap ng coffee. Best time to go in the morning kasi tambayan din sya ng mga igorot ng manggagawa who makes our tour paths better. They have a pet pig din named AURORA and sobrang friendly nya!

4. Sagada Strawberry Cafe. The best strawberry yogurt (I love tangy food so the more asim, the better). Yogurt is so creamy and cheap sya. Bahay sila so tanong tanong lang at wag mahiya pumasok sa loob ng bahay nila. Araw araw ako andito and on my last day, pinagluto ako ng strawberry pancake ng owner

5. Gaia Cafe. Akala ko hype lang pero sobrang sarap ng food nila. Everything is farm to table. Must try ang hot choco nila. Mababait din sila kasi tinuruan nila ako pano irecreate yung hot choco eh. I bought a lot of tablea bars in here. Best view in Sagada. I was here everyday and nilalakad ko lang (approx 30 mins from Sagada Log In)

6. Sagada Homemade Whole Wheat Bread. Sobrang sarap ng wheat bread nila. I tried all their flavors and kahit kinabukasan mo na kakainin ang fluffy pa rin. 

7. Piitik Wines. Honesty wine bar sya and they accept credit cards lol. The owner is very nice na they invited me pa to their home (katabi lang naman) para ipatikim yung bagong timpla nila. I love the blueberry one. 

8. Bana’s Coffee. Akala ko rin hype lang but the ambiance and their coffee are really good. Okay sa price. 

9. Maggie's Lemon Pie. Mahirap tong hanapin. Sa may banda church ito then malapit sa bangin. The best lemon pie in Sagada I swear. Bait pa nung owner!

10. Chapter One Cafe Sagada. Hidden gem. Ganda ng view from above. Actually, nadaanan ko sila before nung pauwi ako from Gaia kasi may ilaw. I got curious and went there the morning after. 360 view of Sagada talaga. They also have a game night! The owner invited me kaya mga 3 times akong pumunta. Pls note na you have to climb atleast 100 steps to get there pero worth it naman

11. TamTam Cafe. Read their reviews in Google Maps. Perfect 5 stars because it’s that GOOD

12. Misty Lodge Cafe - YOU SHOULD TRY THEIR BURGER. Yan lang nothing else. 

13. Sagada Hub - for casual dining and it’s cheaper than sa market. 

14. Eduardo’s. It’s a small bakery na minsan open and minsan hindi. Must try ang bagel and pretzel nila. It was so good and so cheap. 

15. Sagada Cellar Door. Go for the drinks only. Their food is expensive na and so-so lang. The vibe is so good din. Be there before 5 pm para you can choose your spot

16. Sagada Rust n Wood Cafe. Sobrang expensive and di ko na babalikan but I liked their food. Yung owner that time was going table to table to ask for feedbacks (which I love) and nagkwentuhan pa kami. Sobrang aesthetic here to be honest but I hope they improve pa. 

# Food Establishments that is not for me:

1. Food sa local market. Hindi ka makakatipid because it’s really expensive so better go nalang sa Sagada Hub kasi same lang naman and cheaper pa

2. Sagada Lemon Pie House. Unecessarily rude yung owner/bantay that time. I was supposed to buy a whole box pero isang slice nalang. Their lemon pie is dry. Hindi babalikan ever

3. Sagada Brew. Over na over sa pagiging expensive pero their coffee and pastry that time was not good

4. SLABHOUSE Sagada Restaurant, Log Cabin Sagada, Salt N Pepper - If you went to Sagada pre pandemic, you’ll notice how expensive they got and quality is not that good anymore. 

5. Yoghurt House. Overly expensive and not at par sa quality. 

6. Sagada Shrine. The vibe is so good but their food is not and too expensive din. But their owner is so nice na I plan on staying there next time. Go for the vibes only!",28,1770537595.0,phtravel,2,0.97,False

Headline: I finally said ""no"" to my bosses and reclaimed my weekend. It felt amazing. Last Friday, I told my management that I needed more practice with clients. They offered to do some training, and I agreed. In the moment, I completely blanked on the fact that the next day was Saturday.   
  
I suggested, ""Let's do the video training tomorrow,"" and they were like, ""Sure, let's do 11 AM."" A bit later, I checked my calendar and realized my mistake. I immediately messaged them: ""Oh, wait, tomorrow is a day off, and you probably have the day off too. Let’s move it to Monday instead."" But they said, ""No, let’s still do it tomorrow at 11."" I wasn’t happy about it, but at first, I just mentally gave in. However, when I woke up on Saturday, the sun was so bright and warm (I live in Vietnam). All I wanted to do was run to the sea, not jump on a work call. I finally gathered my courage and told them: ""I'm sorry, but I'm not ready to do the call today.   
  
Let’s reschedule for Monday."" They just replied, ""OK."" The instant relief I felt was incredible. Even if the training wasn't going to be long, wasting even 30 minutes of such a beautiful day on work felt wrong. I’m so glad I stood my ground. I set a boundary and said ""no"" to my bosses for the first time. I don’t regret it at all. I feel so recharged. I spent the day at a café by the sea, drinking coffee with condensed milk.

1qz324a,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskBrits/comments/1qz324a/is_this_modern_britain/,Is this modern Britain?,"took my 3 year old to the local garden centre. they have a soft play area (quite small) where adults can have a coffee while kids play. nice place to take the little one on the weekend. 

  
anyway, when i get there its packed and they tell me my kid is the last one they will let in for “health and safety ” reasons. note - the soft play is a bit removed from the cafe where you pay and anyone can just kind of walk in (without paying). they have signa up telling people to pay the £3 on the door. 

anyway we go in and they decide to do a check of who has actually paid and see if anyone shouldn't be there. 

  
of the 6 families there, only 3 had paid. the woman told them and not one of the freeloading families (one with 3 adults and 6 kids using the soft play) left. they all just sat there sipping their coffees and grinning at getting away with it. 

i asked the woman if she was going to do anything about it and she said that there was nothing she can do if they wont leave. i asked why i should pay if no one else was and she just said she “understands“ why i might be upset. 

they were also turning away paying customers because the place was full of non paying kids! 

ok so this isn't perhaps a big deal but it feels to me like this was a microcosm for the whole uk at the moment (or maybe its always been like this?) a small percentage of us go to work, follow the rules, and pay our taxes.

  
the rest are on the take or playing the system. Nicking stuff from shops and no one does anything. free food from gregs. Driving around in their motability cars while i fork out for my own insurance and tax. going to work while they sit at home and get almost the same as me…working cash in hand on the side. 

  
is it just the suckers paying? is it just the suckers supporting the whole system? is it the suckers that the government will continue to bleed to fund everyone else? how long is this sustainable?",44,1770537242.0,AskBrits,84,0.7,False

There was no scene, no scandal. It was just an ordinary evening.

Her phone vibrated on the table while he was in the shower. She wasn’t going to look — truly. But the screen lit up, and there was a name she didn’t recognize.

And a message that was too warm, too not meant for friends.

She sat there for a long time without opening the chat.

The seconds dragged on, as if time itself had slowed down just to hurt her more.

And then she finally opened it.

Nothing explicit. No “I love you,” no photos.

Just phrases. Simple, alive. The kind that used to belong to her.

In that moment, she didn’t realize that he was cheating.

She realized that her place had already been taken.

He came out of the shower, smiled, kissed the top of her head, and asked what was for dinner.

She looked at him and suddenly understood something clearly:

he wouldn’t even notice if she disappeared.

That night, she lay beside him, listening to his breathing.

Each breath was a reminder that the person next to her had chosen someone else.

And she was still here. Still loving him.

In the morning, she didn’t cry.

She simply woke up early, made herself some coffee, and understood that the worst thing had already happened —

Lawmakers are considering banning natural Kratom, and a lot of people still don’t know what it is or why this matters. Here’s the simple breakdown:

🌿 What is Kratom?

It’s a natural plant in the coffee family. Many adults use it for mood support, focus, and steady, balanced energy. For a lot of people, it’s helped them stay away from far more harmful substances.

💚 Why do people use it?

For many Iowans, Kratom supports:

• Mental well-being

• The ability to work and stay productive

• Stability for daily life

• Avoidance of dangerous drugs

It’s been a major harm-reduction tool for years.

⚖️ Is it dangerous?

Compared to alcohol, opioids, or many prescription meds, Kratom has a far lower risk profile. It doesn’t cause respiratory depression, and responsible adult use is dramatically safer than the substances people often turn to when safer options aren’t available.

🛑 Why this matters right now

A ban wouldn’t protect anyone — it would push people toward far more dangerous alternatives, burden public health resources, and strip adults of a natural option that works for them.

And honestly, banning a plant that responsible adults use safely would be a serious government overreach. It sets a bad precedent for personal freedom in Iowa. Adults shouldn’t lose the right to choose a natural, safer alternative just because of misinformation or panic.

The REAL fucking reason no one really bothered to keep Human numbers in check except in their own species' exclusive territory (Some human tourists are disrespectful as shit) is because generally hiring a Human is like hiring a swiss army knife. 

Most species have specialized jobs, the best mechanics are the Sentinias, literal Intelligent Constructs and AIs. 

The best military gear is made by the Kriegans, the best medical scientists are the Velenites, the best duelists are the Ogre Amazonian all female race known as the Paravaxians. 

What are humans best at? Being 2nd place, which by normal standards, is pretty fucking bad. 

But then you hire a bunch of Humans and they are the most flexible pieces of reliable bullshit you could have. 

Hired a human originally as a Janitor? Fucker can just as easily throw hands if there is corporate sabotage. 

Hired a Human as security officer? Dude could babysit the CEO's child since he is also probably a dad or has strong parental instincts. 

Hired a Human as a chef? Fucker probably knows a blaster or a gun as well since he probably killed your breakfast this morning. 

and those are the obvious ones.

psychology books, and watching people way smarter than me break down what actually matters
in your 20s. And here's what I found: most of us are doing it wrong. We're chasing the wrong
things, listening to the wrong advice, and then wondering why we feel stuck at 29.
Your 20s aren't about ""finding yourself"" through travel or ""living your best life"" on Instagram.
They're about building the foundation for literally everything that comes next. And the wild part?
Society doesn't tell you this. Your brain is still developing until 25, your habits are forming, and
the decisions you make now compound like crazy. But most 20-somethings are just winging it,
hoping things work out.
I'm not saying this to freak you out. I'm saying it because understanding the science behind why
your 20s matter so much actually takes the pressure off. You're not supposed to have it all
figured out. But you should be intentionally building something.
## Step 1: Build Skills That Actually Pay
Your 20s are your skill-stacking years. This is when your brain is most adaptable, most hungry
to learn. Don't waste it.
Pick 2-3 skills that compound. Think: writing, public speaking, coding, sales, marketing, financial
literacy. These aren't just ""nice to have"" skills. They're multipliers. A designer who can also
write? Now you're rare. A developer who understands marketing? You're basically a unicorn.
Cal Newport's ""So Good They Can't Ignore You"" destroyed the whole ""follow your passion"" myth
for me. Newport, a computer science professor at Georgetown, argues that passion follows skill
mastery, not the other way around. The book won awards and basically flipped career advice on
its head. It's backed by real research showing that craftsman mindset beats passion mindset
every time. This book will make you question everything you think you know about finding
fulfilling work. Read it twice.
Stop waiting to feel passionate about something. Get obsessively good at something valuable
instead. The passion comes later when you're actually competent and people start paying
attention.
## Step 2: Build Your Body While It's Easy
Your metabolism is still on your side. Your joints don't hurt yet. Your recovery time is fast. This is
literally the easiest your body will ever be to transform. Don't wait until your 30s when everything
gets harder.
Start lifting weights. Not just cardio. Lifting builds bone density, increases testosterone (for
everyone, it matters), and creates a physique that carries you through decades. Research
shows that muscle mass you build in your 20s sticks around way longer than muscle you try to
build later.
Use an app like Fitbod or Strong to track your workouts. They adapt to your progress and make
sure you're actually getting stronger, not just showing up. Consistency beats intensity. Three
times a week beats going hard for two weeks then quitting.
Also, fix your posture now. Seriously. Most of us are hunched over screens 10 hours a day. That
compounds into back problems, neck issues, and looking 10 years older by 35. Stretch. Do
yoga. Take it seriously.
## Step 3: Build Financial Literacy Like Your Life Depends On It
Nobody teaches you this stuff in school, which is insane because money literally affects
everything. Your stress levels, your relationships, your freedom to take risks, your ability to help
people you love.
Start with the basics. Open a high-yield savings account. Automate savings so 20% of every
paycheck goes somewhere you can't easily touch. Learn about index funds and compound
interest. I'm not saying become a finance bro. I'm saying understand how money works so it
stops controlling you.
""[I Will Teach You to Be Rich](youtube.com/@ramitsethi)"" by Ramit Sethi is the best no-BS
money book for 20-somethings. Sethi breaks down exactly how to automate your finances,
invest smartly, and stop feeling guilty about spending on things you actually enjoy. It's practical,
funny, and doesn't lecture you about lattes. The advice actually works for real people with real
lives. Best money book I've ever read, hands down.
Also, track your spending for one month. Just one. Use an app like YNAB (You Need A Budget)
or even just a spreadsheet. You'll be shocked where your money actually goes. Awareness is
half the battle.
## Step 4: Build Relationships That Push You Forward
Your network in your 20s shapes your entire life trajectory. This isn't about being fake or using
people. It's about being intentional with who you spend time with.
The research is clear: you become the average of the five people you spend the most time with.
Their income, their habits, their mindset, it all rubs off. So look around. Are your friends building
something or just complaining? Are they curious or cynical? Are they pushing you to grow or
keeping you comfortable?
Find people 5-10 years ahead of where you want to be. Not celebrities or influencers. Real
people you can actually learn from. Buy them coffee. Ask questions. Most successful people
love helping younger folks who are genuinely curious.
Also, learn to communicate like an adult. Read ""[Crucial
Conversations](https://www.amazon.in/Crucial-Conversations-Talking-Stakes-Second/dp/00717
71328)"" by Kerry Patterson. This book teaches you how to handle high-stakes discussions
without losing your mind or the relationship. The authors spent 25 years researching what
makes some people way better at difficult conversations than others. It's a bestseller for a
reason. This skill alone will save your relationships, career negotiations, and family drama.
Insanely good read.
## Step 5: Build Systems, Not Just Goals
Goals are overrated. Systems are everything. James Clear proved this in ""Atomic Habits"" which
sold millions of copies and changed how people think about behavior change. Clear shows that
you don't rise to the level of your goals, you fall to the level of your systems.
Want to write a book? Don't set a goal to ""write a book."" Build a system where you write 500
words every morning before checking your phone. Want to get fit? Build a system where your
gym bag is always packed and next to your bed. Want to learn a language? Build a system
where you do 15 minutes of practice right after breakfast.
Systems remove willpower from the equation. You're not constantly deciding whether to do the
thing. You just do it because that's what you do at this time, in this place.
Use Notion or Obsidian to build your personal operating system. Track your habits, store your
learnings, organize your goals. Treat your life like a project worth managing because it is.
If you want to go deeper on all these topics without spending hours reading dense books,
there's an app called
[BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) that's been
genuinely helpful. Built by Columbia alums and former Google engineers, it pulls from research
papers, expert interviews, and books like the ones mentioned here to create personalized audio
learning sessions.
You tell it something like ""I'm in my mid-20s and want to build better systems and financial
habits but don't know where to start,"" and it generates a custom learning plan with podcasts
tailored to your level. You can choose quick 10-minute overviews or 40-minute deep dives with
real examples. The smoky voice option makes commute learning way less boring. It connects
insights across different sources so you're not just getting isolated tips but actually
understanding how everything fits together.
## Step 6: Build Mental Toughness Through Discomfort
Your 20s should include deliberately hard things. Things that suck while you're doing them but
make you stronger. This could be a challenging fitness goal, learning a difficult skill, starting a
side project that scares you, or even just waking up early consistently.
The ""Comfort Crisis"" research shows that modern life is too easy, and it's making us weak and
depressed. Our brains are wired for challenge and struggle. When everything is easy, we feel
purposeless.
Do hard workouts. Have difficult conversations. Take calculated risks. Get rejected and survive
it. Each time you do something hard and make it through, you're literally rewiring your brain to
handle more. This is neuroplasticity in action.
Try using Ash for mental health check-ins and relationship coaching. It helps you process
emotions and navigate tough situations without needing a full therapy session. Having tools to
manage your mental state isn't soft, it's strategic.
## Step 7: Build Your Own Definition of Success
This is the hardest one because everybody has opinions about what you should be doing. Your
parents want one thing. Society pushes another. Instagram makes you feel like you should have
a different thing entirely.
Forget all that noise.
Sit down and actually write out what YOU want your life to look like at 30, 40, 50. Not what
sounds impressive. What actually makes you excited to wake up. Is it freedom? Is it impact? Is it
building something? Is it deep relationships? Is it adventure?
Once you know what you're actually building toward, saying no to everything else gets way
easier. You're not missing out. You're staying focused on your own path.
This isn't about being selfish. It's about being intentional. You can't build anything meaningful if
you're constantly distracted by everyone else's expectations.
Your 20s are your construction years. Every decision is either adding to your foundation or
eroding it. The compound effect is real. Small choices now create massive differences later. So
stop scrolling, stop overthinking, and start building something that matters to you. The time is
literally now.",2,1770536013.0,psychesystems,0,1.0,False

Nick and Tessa stumble behind you out of the bar, leaning on each other for support and trading loud whispers. You're relieved at the sight of your black sedan, eager to sleep. At a distance, the fob doesn't work. The familiar double flash of the headlights doesn't come, even when you're standing  next to the car. Bracing yourself with a hand on the roof, you try the key. It turns a full 360 degrees and you pull back with clenched teeth; someone tried to break in. As you try the lock on the passenger side, you pull out your phone. The door won't unlock and neither will your phone. No amount of button smashing lights the screen.

Nick's phone won't turn on. Neither will Tessa's when you eventually convince her to hand it over. You're not worried yet. It is a freak coincidence but not beyond belief that all four batteries could die without notice and that a stranger broke the lock. But your phone is in your front pocket and you keep taking it out to check if it's miraculously resurrected.

""Let's get walking then,"" you announce, heading toward home.

Your friends follow you with quickly sobering complaints, camping backpacks rattling as they adjust their weight. They had spent the last few months walking a thousand miles so what was a couple more? The promise of warm blankets gives you the burst of energy you need to sprint the last block to the front door. It's so close, your bed and half a beer await your gracious return.

The key slips into the lock and... spins. One then two then three full rotations. You yank it back and kick the door before trying again. This time you lean all your weight into the door as you turn. It yields the same result but you slip and the key snaps with the weight of your body behind it.

For a moment you can't help but stare in disbelief at your mistake. ""Are you fucking kidding?"" you ask helplessly.

Nick and Tessa are behind you now. You turn around to show them the half key you still hold.

""Ah fuck that,"" Tessa growls. She runs up to the nearest window and starts pounding and yelling. You don't stop her. You join in. When you finally give up, at least you're warm from running around the apartment building. It's then you realize Nick has set up his backpacking tent.

""Let's sleep please,"" he says, holding open the nylon door flap.

Camping out on the sidewalk is strange sensation. Plus, it's a two person tent and it barely holds the three of you.  For a while you're pissed, curled up with your friends on the street like your memory foam mattress isn't fifty steps away. But it's so quiet you start to forget where you are. Packed this tight, it's almost hot and you sleep.

**-2-**

Morning is the color of a ripening orange that still remembers being green. Bright, cloud scattered sunlight filters through the tent, illuminating your tangled bodies. You sit up, ignoring Tessa swearing at you, to open the door. With more swearing, you exit onto the concrete and look around.

By the height of the winter sun, you ration it must be late in the morning. Usually cars are honking outside your window and people are getting in each other's ways. It's a main road through the city. You can't think of any good reason it should be so empty. Entirely empty. Not a single parked car, no hurried business men, no trash bags, no scattered coffee cups. You turn to look at your building, expecting to see someone staring down at the idiots that missed the stay at home order.

But no, all the windows are white with the reflected sky. Even the windows you remember holding flags and political signs are blank. You still aren't panicking, your brain won't let you until you've eliminated every rational scenario and surely you can find one.

""Guys come look,"" you say, patting the top of the tent.

""You got the door open?"" Nick asks, pushing a disheveled head into the cold air.

You don't respond, you instead start walking up the street to see if it's normal.

""What do you want?"" Tessa's voice is almost overtaken by the sound of rustling as she struggles out of the tent.

You're expecting to be yelled at by your two friends but they're as quiet as the city. It's so quiet you can hear their feet scuffing the pavement. When you hear running you know it's Tessa, she can never stand still when she's stressed. You return to where Nick is standing and he's turning in a slow circle, eyes bulging.

When Tessa returns, she reports the bizarre emptiness for blocks. Empty sidewalks, roads, windows, gutters. Your stomach aches and Nick is holding a hand over his eyes, swaying with dizziness. You all decide to sit and eat and think. The tent zipper sticks as you open it to rest on the mattress pads.

Breakfast is cold and sparse. Your friends packed well for their trip so there's not much food left. One MRE, electrolyte powder, a handful of granola bars, and a water bottle. It's not enough food for a day. You'll all be fine once you find a way inside, no problem. And you eat like it won't be a problem. When you're done, the bars are gone and your water is half empty.

""It was an evacuation,"" Tessa offers.

You whisper 'no' to yourself, thinking of the streets cleaner than they've ever been in your life.

""Shelter in place?"" Nick asks the universe.

""No,"" you whisper. Where are the cars?

""The rapture!"" Tessa exclaims.

""No,"" you retort. You aren't the three sole sinners in town.

""Aliens?"" Nick asks quiet as if little green men are listening.

You press your face into your hands as your heart begins to race. This is it, you are finally panicking. You're in a different world, probably have been since you left the bar last night. The worst part is not knowing how you got there.

There's quiet for an awful minute before Tessa speaks. ""What do we do?"" Her excitement over the novelty of your situation has run out and she sounds like a child.

It's quiet again and when you lift up your head to see why, your friends are waiting for you to have a solution. If you can't give them something you know your thumping heartbeat will become a full-blown meltdown.

""I think we need to get out of the city,"" you say. It's your first thought. Cities are magnets for death and destruction so the suburbs will be safe.

The three of you pack up and let Nick take the lead. Despite his hangover, dulled by sunglasses and a baseball cap, his sense of direction is good. You recognize bits and pieces of the city that remind you of trips to the beach. You never venture this far east if you can help it. You don't stop for lunch, none of you have an appetite and the movement keeps you warm. The jacket you wear is only good for going between heated car to heated building.

When you stop for the night, it's because Tessa is complaining about her feet. Nick sets up the tent as you heat up a hermetically sealed pouch of ravioli and Tessa checks her blisters. It smells like fake cheese and sour tomatoes as you drift off and you think you'd feel like a king sleeping on the floor of a shitty pizzeria.

**-3-**

The next morning the city continues on. Nick swears they should be hitting tree line sidewalks of two story family homes. And yet the familiar repetition of apartments, corporate skyscrapers,  and chain restaurants continues abated.

You stop for lunch on a bus stop bench. There used to be more covered bus shelters, you waited under one last weekend after drinks with your coworkers. The three of you touch shoulders and arms as you share tough bread with fake cheese. The bars between the seats prevent you from getting closer for warmth. Tessa let you borrow her extra shirt but it doesn't help at all.

You start walking before your friends are ready. If you don't get your blood moving you're afraid you'll get stuck, frozen to the metal bench. Your shoulders are pulled to your ears as you walk, eyes down so all your focus is on your numb feet.

""Could we get on a roof?"" Tessa asks. ""See where to go?""

You shrug, Nick speaks. ""If you can find a fire escape, go for it.""

""What do you think?"" Tessa is asking you directly.

You look to her, eyes watering and painfully cold. ""Anything that gets me home,"" you tell her.

Walking resumes but now with energy as Tessa is excited to have a project. She runs back and forth across the street to check the adjoining alleyways for a reachable ladder. Nick walks on one side of the sidewalk and you the other in case your third misses something. Time passes slow with disappointment.

You're ready to give up, the sun is setting, when Tessa yells with excitement. Nick jogs over to her and you follow at a walk. Your friend is already pulling herself up the metal rungs of a fire escape. You notice that even though she's hanging onto the sliding portion of the ladder her weight doesn't move it. There's a closed dumpster pulled under the fire escape so that she could reach. You and Nick watch her, anxious at what she might find. Secretly, you worry she'll fall.

You're pacing to stay warm, no longer paying attention to Tessa by the time she reaches the top. Nick is beside you when she does, nudging you to look up. You look in time to see the silhouette of Tessa waving against the orange sun before she vanishes over the roof's edge. Actually holding your breath, you wait for news. But you're losing feeling in your face as Tessa takes too long to tell you what she sees.

Nick starts into the street, looking for your friend. ""Tessa?"" he yells, voice stuttering through his chattering teeth. ""You okay?""

There's a beat of silence before a scream pierces the air. ""Tess?!"" You join in Nick's frantic calls. She doesn't respond, she just screams and screams, louder than you ever thought she was capable. There's a pause and you hear the distinct sound of gagging but there isn't anything for her to vomit.

""I'm coming up!"" Nick announces. You grab his arm as he moves to run. You know it would be dangerous to follow.

""No!"" Tessa seems to reply. But then she repeats it, over and over until it's noise.

""No! NO! NO! NONONONONONONO-"" She stops to gag and cough and then you hear her feet pound the solid roof.

You can barely see her against the darkening sky. But you can hear her coming. She's trying to yell and cough at the same time so it comes out as a wordless animal bellow.

Tessa is going too fast, when she comes around the corners you hear her whole body smash into the railing. You watch as her shadow partially runs, mostly falls, down the next flight of steps. She's still halfway up the 10 story building so when her momentum carries her over a rail and you close your eyes. Nick screams and runs, you can barely hear Tess hit the ground over his worry.

You heave a breath and pick up the two backpacks that were left behind. By the time Nick returns from Tess's body, the tent is up and you're huddled in her sleeping bag, numb from your brain through your toes. Nick is breathing ragged, hiccuping with unshed tears that dehydration keeps at bay. He leans through the front of the tent and puts your dead friend's jacket in your lap. You don it, shivering in the down sleeping bag alone. It's been dark and getting colder by the time you and Nick curl together for a long night.

**-4-**

Nick is missing when you wake. He left his bag, mostly empty MRE package open on top. He can't be far. Hot sauce packet and almonds clutched in one hand, you leave the tent and close it after you as though you can trap the heat inside. From across the street, you can see Nick crouched in the alley where Tess lays. You walk over, getting close enough to just see the tips of her boots. One is the opposite way of the other.

""You eat?"" you ask Nick flatly.

He stands from the body and presses a hand to his mouth. When he reaches you, you offer him the almonds but he shakes his head.

""Let's go,"" he says. You don't argue. You don't know where you're going but you have to try, don't you?

Something is wrong when you reach the tent. Nick says the zipper is stuck but the whole front door refuses to move, his yanking doesn't wrinkle the fabric like it should. You try the zipper and it's like pulling at a nail in a brick wall. The tent is somehow solid. The two of you scratch and bite and kick at the solid mass that used to be a shelter. You give up after Nick's stripped his pants to use the zipper as a knife. What is supposed to be nylon shows no sign of damage, you might as well have tried blowing it down.

Silently Nick pulls back on his jeans, shivering hard. You split what's left of the nuts and the hot sauce before walking. You have no plan and soon you won't have any energy to move, the only thing keeping your limbs soft. So you walk without rest. Inevitably the night comes and you curl together in the deep door way of building. You have all cover on three sides but it doesn't keep the cold out.

**-5-**

You wake and you're cold, colder than you should be with Nick at your back. The pressure of him is still there, the warmth isn't. ""Nick?"" you ask.

His corpse is silent in return, only providing you with the sand bag weight of his body. You wonder how long he's been dead, cooling and loosening as you sleep.

Freezer burnt thoughts keep you laying on the ground with the body until pins and needles erupt in your lower legs. A soft fear that this is the feeling of death sends enough adrenaline through your system to get you on your feet. You start walking just to walk. Eventually, your legs feel better and you're actually warming up. You don't need Tessa's jacket anymore and discard in the middle of the road. Hypothermia is slowly becoming a friend; you haven't felt this comfortable in days.

Walking brings you to a familiar place. The abandoned tent is bright orange in the distance. You approach and walk past only to stop in front of an alley. Tessa is where you left her, the yellow treads of her boots acting as her grave marker. You wonder what she saw, what was so awesome she died avoiding it. Your eyes drift up to the roof. There's a flash of fear in the back of your mind but the urgency of your curiosity wins and drags you forward. Your hands burn on the frozen metal of the dumpster as you scramble on top. Standing on the plastic lid, you inspect your palms and they're purple instead of red. That's fine, all you care is that they can pull you up the dozen ladder rungs.

The clang of your body on metal and your own rough breathing create a steady rhythm for you to climb to. Your lungs aren't cooperating and you have to push harder the higher you get. When you're forced to stop by swimming vision, you've stripped your own jacket. Your skin is burning.

You continue to the roof with wooshing breaths, the air feels thinner. But you're so close. You force yourself to keep moving onto and up the final ladder even though you're permanently seeing double. When you stop to look, it'll clear. Finally your hand grabs onto brick instead of metal and you know you're there. Now you can't stop even if you wanted. Your body is moving on its own. Even though something is wrong with the sky. Even though the air you're breathing is foul. Even though the wind doesn't sound like wind and it sounds more like Tessa. You've made it over the edge.",1,1770535862.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

For years we had a reciprocal friendship with regular hangouts, genuine conversations, mutual support. But over the past two years, I've noticed a pattern that's become impossible to ignore: Jess only reaches out when she needs something. She needs help moving, she needs someone to watch her dog, she needs advice about a work situation, she needs to vent about her relationship. And I show up for her because that's what friends do, right? But when her life is going well, I don't hear from her for months. I'll text to check in or suggest getting coffee, and I get brief responses or ""I'm so busy right now but we should definitely catch up soon!"" that never materialize into actual plans.

What really crystallized this for me was my birthday last month. She didn't call, didn't text, didn't acknowledge it at all. But three days later, she called asking if I could help her prepare for a job interview. When I brought up that she'd forgotten my birthday, she apologized profusely and said she's just been so overwhelmed, and then immediately pivoted back to asking for interview help. I helped her because I didn't know what else to do, but I felt hollow doing it. I'm genuinely unsure if I should have a direct conversation about feeling like our friendship has become one-sided, or if I should just quietly step back and stop making myself available every time she needs something. The thought of losing a 10-year friendship makes me sad, but the thought of continuing to be someone's emotional support system while getting nothing in return makes me feel worse.

Hi everyone, my boyfriend and I have a 6 week old and I feel like he puts in minimal effort to bond and to take care of our son.

To start this off, I would like to point out that he is a great partner overall and does contribute a good amount to our household (mainly with cleaning because he struggles with pretty intense OCD. He literally cannot stand to see a single bit of dust or dirt on the floor and that in turn puts a lot of pressure on me to basically deep clean our house daily to ensure he doesn’t completely freak out when he gets home from work, but that’s besides the point).

Anyway, I feel as though he does not put in the effort to take care of or be a parent to our son. Usually in the mornings I wake him up to do the first diaper change of the day so I can get ready to nurse. This takes several minutes to get him up, and then several more minutes to get him out of bed, and then go to the bathroom, all while baby is getting more and more fussy from having the dirty diaper and it usually ends up with him crying before my partner picks him up to change him. I’m not kidding it’s taken 30 mins for him to get up to do this. On top of that, he has not once woken up in the night to change a diaper, feed, burp or sooth our baby. I have done that myself since day one and it is exhausting, luckily he is starting to sleep 6-8 hours through the night.

After our baby is fed and happy, I usually had him off to my boyfriend to have some bonding time and to give me time to quickly make a coffee and get ready. During this time he doesn’t even try to connect with our son, he doesn’t speak to him or barely look at him, even if baby is wide awake and alert, all my boyfriend does is stare at his phone and once the baby gets fussy from this neglect, he just pops a pacifier in. And when the pacifier doesn’t work, he asks me to come back and take him… so he can go back on his phone in peace. He has even gotten me to get out of the shower just to hold him and calm him down so he could keep scrolling on instagram.

In the evenings I try once again to give them some one on one time. I start to wind him down, give him a bath and get him into pjs and then I hand him off to my boyfriend to make a bottle so my boyfriend can feed him and I can usually sit in the other room and cry or rant to someone online (literally what I am doing right now). I go to check in on them and he has the bottle propped up and is watching a YouTube video on full volume and my son is wide awake and stimulated again. He has also tried to have the TV on during this time with some sort of sports on it and complains when I ask him to turn it off.

This is seriously getting on my nerves, I couldn’t tell you one time I’ve seen him interact with our baby unless it’s in front of guests and then it just seems performative.

I love my partner very very much but at this point, I am worried for my babies development and if it wasn’t for financial reasons, i genuinely think we would be better off just the two of us. I am starting to become so unhappy in this relationship and I don’t know how to talk to him about this.",0,1770534895.0,BabyBumps,24,0.5,False

I was in a biology class with people ranging from like 17-40. In the class there was like a Buddy sign up sheet to help each other study, I didn’t like just having my number out there but I wrote it down anyway. Well the first thing that happened was that my classmate (who was married) texted me telling me he couldn’t stop thinking about me, that he tried to stay away but can’t and that he’d like to take things further with me. I had only had short conversations with him and never gave him any hints that I liked him. 

I texted back saying that he made me uncomfortable and that we should only interact in class. I transferred into another class the next day because it was so weird. 

But then a week later he followed me to my car and boxed me in, asking why I didn’t want anything to do with him. I told him that we have no reason to do anything together, and quickly squeezed into my car. I’d never been so freaked out, so I changed my classes to online after that for the remainder of the semester. He texted me again and I blocked his number.

Well fast forward to now and I told my boyfriend this story. He was surprised that I didn’t go on a date with him and said that he was only trying to do something nice for me. WTF?!! I told him that he was harassing me, an 18 year old at the time, and he didn’t see it like that! He said that I was overreacting and I could have been nicer to him!

When Gael Davis was assigned to investigate the old disappearances, the record keeper took him to an old, small, dusty file room where patient records were kept from the clinic's opening to the changeover. Twenty years of records were stored here from the 1950s to the 1970s.

As Gael stepped into the room, he flipped on the light switch and exhaled an exhausted sigh. He hadn't even started pouring through the countless files. The record keeper, an older lady named Sylvie, handed over the key and looked up at Gael, hands on her hips.

""Now, remember to lock up this room when you're done, and don't take anything home with you."" She wagged her finger at him.

""Yes, ma'am,"" he nodded, offering her a smile.

Sylvie tutted and left, allowing Gael to begin his work. He let out a low whistle as the door closed, taking in the stack of boxes and the overflowing filing cabinet.

Pulling over a crate to sit on, he started going through the first of the three boxes stacked next to the filing cabinet. The police chief told Gael before he left that he would be looking for the initials A.E. for Miss Absinthe Esper.

She had been a suspect in the cases back in the 1950s but was never found guilty. Instead, Absinthe insisted another co-worker was framing her. When asked who could be trying to frame her, she made the excuse that it was probably an intern who had conveniently stopped working there when the police started to investigate.

Wingston police have suspected her for years but never had enough evidence to warrant an arrest. Now, years later, and Absinthe has long since passed away, they could no longer charge her with the disappearance of the patients.

Opening the first folder in the stack, Gael flipped through the pages, checking to see if there were any end-of-life papers in the back, along with a copy of the coroner's report. Setting it aside, he didn't see the initials A.E., so he continued skimming through the stack.

When he got to the next box of folders, he saw Absinthe's signature start to appear—starting with a young man named Theodore Jones. He was in for an Appendectomy. During the night, while he was recovering, his body went missing under the watchful eye of Miss Esper. Who had proclaimed that Theodore had left his room in the middle of the night when she was doing the nightly rounds to check on the patients.

What exactly did she do with the bodies?

There was a knock at the door, and Gael closed the folder, looking over his shoulder. ""Come in,"" he said.

The door swung open, and clinic director Holt Greene walked in. He was a short, stout man with a curly mustache. ""Any progress, Mr Davis? The clinic will close soon, and only the emergency side will open.""

""Yeah, I found where Absinthe started signing the papers on the missing patients,"" Gael replied, standing up on wobbly knees.

Holt nodded and looked around the room. ""Sylvie gave you the keys, so go ahead and lock up."" The director left the room, waving goodbye over his shoulder and heading down the hall. Setting the file down, Gael walked over, flipping off the light switch and glancing at the room one last time before locking it up and heading home.

Walking to his car, he looked over his shoulder to the clinic's second floor.

In one of the windows was a figure of a woman in a light pastel dress with an apron over the top and a cap with a nursing symbol. Her entire body is translucent. When she smiled at him, it stretched inhumanly from ear to ear, possibly stained with red lipstick.

When Gael blinked, she disappeared. Rubbing his eyes, he narrowed it down to being tired. He got into the passenger side and turned on the engine, deciding to make his way home for the night. Gael saw things because he had been staring at paperwork for too long. This unsolved case must be getting to him.

The following morning, Gael made his way back to Greene Memorial. He walked through the front door, sipping coffee from a drive-through shop.

Digging into his pocket, he procured the keys, fumbled to get them into the lock, and let the door creak open. Geal stepped on foot inside and flipped on the light switch, looking around the room. It was cold, and a chill traveled down his spine, even with the warm disposable cup in his hand. He also noticed condensation on the walls, slowly dripping to the floor.

""Time to get to work,"" Gael said to no one in particular and sat on the same crate from yesterday. He opened a new file and set it aside if it had the initials A.E.

As Gael began to have a pretty good stack, he stretched and took a break, sipping down the last bit of bitter-cold coffee. The sound of footsteps began to echo down the hall, and Gael figured it was either Sylvie or Holt, but when he walked over to the door and looked down the hall, he found it empty.

Gael chuckled, ""It's just my mind playing tricks on me.""

He turned and came face to face with the same woman he saw yesterday.

""Good morning."" she smiled, her lips still turned upwards in an unnatural way. Geal nodded. ""Mornin'."" he returned the greeting, watching her look over at the small table he had placed the files onto.

""Visitors aren't supposed to be in here."" Her gaze was back on him, and she tilted slightly to the side.

""Oh, I'm not a visitor."" Gael thought carefully before choosing his following words. ""I was sent here by a client to check relatives' records since they're getting tests done. To make sure it's nothing genetic.""

She crossed her arms over her chest. ""Do I look like I was born yesterday? I know exactly why you're here.""

""You do?"" he blinked, confused but acted surprised.

Absinthe Esper pursed her upturned lips, making her look like a sweetlip fish. She wagged her finger for him to lean in closer, and he reluctantly complied.

In a hushed whisper, she told him, ""You know about the demon in the morgue, too."" Gael cocked his head and furrowed his brows, watching her bare a toothless pitch-black mouth and place a finger to her lips, silencing him.

Absinthe nodded. ""You must keep him fed, or he will swallow this place whole."" He leaned back, standing at his full height. ""And this demon told you this?"" Gael questioned.

She nodded and looked around him, her eyes widening. Gael caught this and peered over his shoulder, seeing nothing; no one was there. Absinthe had seen something and disappeared. According to her ghost, there was a demon in the morgue.

Gael didn't want to admit it, but he would have to go down into the morgue. The place he knew would have to go down eventually, but not this soon. At this point, he didn't have a choice. Opening the filing cabinet, Gael looked for an old map to determine where the old morgue would be.

With the yellow parchment in hand, he exited the record room and shut it behind him, locking it with the key. Following the layout on the map, the old morgue was on the first floor, which now would be considered the basement. Gael would need to take the elevator down, but he would need a key to access that floor.

The only person to ask would be Holt Greene, the clinic director. As Sylvie walked past, he stopped her, asking if she knew if the director was in today. ""No, he isn't in his office today. Why, what do you need?"" she asked, giving him a questioning stare.

""I need the key to access the basement from the elevator,"" Gael replied.

""Why on earth do you want to go down there?"" Sylvie pressed.

""I think there is vital information down there."" he quipped.

She studied Gael and shook her head. ""If it keeps you out of my hair, I will get it. Meet me at the elevator on the first floor.""

Sylvie disappeared around the corner of the hallway, and Gael went to wait for her at the elevator. He didn't have to wait long before she showed up, handing over a tiny red key.

""Make sure to return it when you finish.""

""Yes, ma'am.""

She rolled her eyes and went on her way. Gael entered the elevator, inserted the tiny red key, turned it on, and pressed the B1 button. She watched the doors close, and the elevator creaked and rocked, beginning its descent. The doors slowly creaked open, revealing nothing but complete darkness.

Taking out his phone, he turned on the light, stepped out of the elevator, and looked around. He used his free hand to cover his nose as he walked further in. A putrid, sour smell with a sickeningly sweet undertone was in the air. This was where Absinthe said the demon lived—the one she said she fed all those innocent people to.

Gael's foot bumped into something, causing it to clatter and roll across the floor. When he shone his light on the direction of the item, he saw a hand reach out and snag it away. What was that just now?

There was shuffling and the sound of crunching close by. When Gael found the source, he wished that he hadn't. Before him, he was a tall man, or could it be considered that? Their limbs were unnaturally long, their skin covered in gray scales, and their eyes glowed bright yellow.

Gael felt frozen in place. He scolded himself for not running back to the elevator and getting out of this place. Instead, he felt a hand on his shoulder to his left. When Geal turned to look, he saw Absinthe standing next to him, her form flickering.

""It was nice of you to come here without a fuss. My master is hungry and will soon need a meal."" her face looked up at Gael's. She still had that awful, unnatural, upturned smile; her lips, which were stained red, were now smeared. She dug her nails into his shoulder, causing him to flinch and drop his phone. It bounced when it hit the ground, scattering across the floor, causing the demon to turn his attention to the two behind him.

The demon stood to his full height, leering down at them.

""Master, I've brought you another meal. Will he suffice?"" Absinthe offered with a show of her hand towards Gael, who began to back away. It sniffed the air, and yellow eyes locked onto its new meal and roared.

He began returning to the elevator with the demon on his heels.

When Gael got to the door, he frantically pressed the button. A scaled arm shot out and grabbed him, pulling him backward by the back of his head and lifting him. He kicked wildly into the air and pulled at the hand that suspended him in the air.

The demon leaned close to his ear, speaking some language he thought was Latin until he heard it repeat the words.

""Only death awaits you here.""

To confirm that he meant the words spoken, the demon sunk his fangs into Gael, drinking his blood and chewing his flesh. Gael tries to scream but is silenced by a piece of duct tape being slapped onto his mouth by Absinthe, who presses a finger to her lips, silencing him.

""Now be a nice sacrifice to the master, and don't make a fuss.""

Her unnatural red-upturned smile was the last thing Gael saw.",1,1770534304.0,horrorstories,0,1.0,False

I prefer that they're with me when we do our grocery trips as I think its a great way for them to learn budgeting, prices, acknowledging the person behind the counter, the sound of a ripe watermelon 🤪 

I wanted to go run some errands this Thursday to get ahead of the weekend/superbowl crowd. 
My 13 year old asked if we could go tomorrow (friday) instead. I agreed and stated ""I better not hear anything tomorrow"" in reference to him whining. 

I spent Thursday afternoon catching up on laundry while he and his brother played video games going well over their 2 hour video game limit for the day. For my part, this is a rule that we haven't really been enforcing since Christmas break. 

Friday afternoon rolls around and we head into town. While at Costco he has this annoyed/sour face on. I ask what's wrong and he says he wants go home (to play video games ofcourse). I say I do too as the place was already pretty packed. The whole time we're there, I was constantly asking him to smile or at the very least fix his face in respect for the people around him. I would ask him if there was something he wanted to add to the list or if he sees something he wants to try in hopes of fixing his mood. 

We pay and as we're loading the trunk I mention how the next on the list is returns at Target. This pisses him off and he starts whining about going home again. 

For a split second, I agree and say ""ok fine, but can I just stop by a Starbucks to grab some coffee then?"" Which was met with more sour mad face and whining about going home. 

I lost it and got mad back. Growing up, my mom or dad would practically just tell us ""get ready, we're leaving in 15 to go do -xyz."" We weren't given a choice, much less bargain. I caught myself and got mad over the fact that I'm asking my 13 year old for permission to run errands and grab coffee.

I feel like I listened, considered his suggestion and when it came time for him to hold up his end of the bargain, I still got attitude and endless whining. 

I was mad and brought up the whole time limit rule they've been abusing and decided we're going back to that.
I lectured him the whole 6 mins drive to target and when we got out this kid slammed my car door.
I had to get some space. I told him to sit at the Starbucks inside the target while me and his brother did the returns. 
When we came to get him, I told him he wasn't allowed on his phone for 1 week. 

He didn't say goodbye when he went off to ride his motorcycle yesterday or goodnight to me last night. This morning, I asked for a hug and he said he wasn't ready. 

Was I in the wrong? 
Did I ""gentle parent"" too much? 
Or does his entitlement need to get introduced to the belt? (Im joking 🙃)

First time mom with a 6 month old and PPD struggling with MIL. I feel like since my daughter has been born things are happening to me and I’m not getting a choice in how I want to spend my time with my baby. 

My mother in law showed up at the hospital with 12+ family members almost daily. When we got home, she started showing up unannounced almost daily often with my Husband’s Aunts and usually after my Husband left for work. She is awful. She expects to be served coffee and food. She doesn’t help. She comments my looks, my house, even my plants on a daily level. Basically, she’s looking for fault and looking to catch me out. 

Every morning after our 9 am feeding, I would spend an hour cleaning, doing my hair and makeup, and ordering snacks to ensure I’d be prepared for visits. I ended up hiring a cleaner to come weekly. My house, myself, and my baby were always immaculate but I would get some type of comment on a daily. 

I regret allowing her behavior and not spending that time cuddling and loving my baby. After a few months of this, my Husband intervened after I finally told him how it was impacting me and especially my milk production (skipping pumping, not keeping a proper feeding schedule etc.) 

She still shows up every few weeks and walks around my backyard and house to tell me what’s wrong with it. I feel like she ruined my postpartum experience and I can’t shake it. I spent the first few months of my baby’s life preparing for visitors and hate myself for thinking that was normal.  

I’m now trying to spend every second I can with my daughter but I can never get that hospital experience and first few months back. It’s my last few weeks before returning to work and I feel like I didn’t have enough time. I’m angry and sad and falling into a deep black hole.",2,1770533730.0,beyondthebump,11,1.0,False

I apologize for the long post but I’m only posting this because a friend is convinced this girl wanted me to talk to her, but I’m almost certain she was just fishing for attention and an ego boost. I haven't seen her in a while, so I assume it’s over anyway, but I mainly just want to know what was actually going on.

**Full disclosure:** I consume a fair amount of ""black pill"" content and haven't spoken to a girl in about 4 years, so my social skills are basically non-existent. I’m looking for an honest, non-biased insight into this.

I’m a 22M and a regular at my gym. About 4 months ago, I started noticing this girl (around 19-21) who shows up once or twice a week. I go late in the evening (like 10pm ish), so it’s usually the same small group of people, and she’s one of the few girls there, so she’s hard to miss.

The first couple of weeks were standard gym stuff, catching her and her friend staring, mirroring my movements, double takes from her, and catching eye contact in the mirrors. There was definitely some weird tension. One night, I was working out near her and her friend with my volume low, and I distinctly heard her tell her friend, “He’s so hot.” I wasn't 100% sure it was about me, so I got awkward, put my head down, and moved to a different area. Shortly after, I saw her go up to another guy and make small talk. It seemed platonic, but it made me think I was being delusional about the earlier comment. I decided to just go cold, avoid eye contact, and move on.

About two weeks later, the energy changed. she couldn't hold eye contact with me for more than half a second without swiftly looking away, She started doing her entire workout right in my immediate area. She began invading my personal space, walking unnecessarily close (like within 3 feet) and taking long paths just to pass by me. One day she walked past me three times; on the fourth time, she super close, walked extra slow and started laughing with her friend right after they passed. My buddy even told me that when I went upstairs to the change rooms, she did a literal 180 and followed me up immediately.

That same week, she showed up with her hair dyed blonde and done up in waves instead of her normal curly hair, wearing full makeup. When I caught her sneaking a glance at me that day, she gave me this flustered, playful grin. .

The most intense interaction happened recently. She took a machine right in front of me (one I’ve never even seen her use), tucked her shirt into her bra to expose her back, and did her set. When she finished, she stared right at me, then over-exaggeratedly bent over to clean the machine directly in my line of sight. She stared at me again while doing it (which I ignored), before walking past me incredibly close.

2 weeks later, I was sitting in my car finishing a coffee before heading in. I saw her leaving, and as she drove past, she turned her head and stared at me through the glass for a solid 4 seconds. The very last day I saw her, she was leaving the gym and kept turning around to look back at me while she was walking up the stairs.

This all played out over 3-4 months and throughout those months, i would notice her ad the guy I mentioned earlier talking here and there but I have no clue what their relationship is. Was she genuinely interested and I blew it by being ""cold,"" or was this all just a calculated way to get a reaction out of a guy for an ego boost?",0,1770533263.0,dating_advice,2,0.5,False

Need some genuine advice from people who’ve actually tried different protein powders.

I’ve been wanting to add protein to my routine, but I’ve been putting it off because:

	•	Milk/dairy doesn’t suit me that well (small amounts are fine, too much = stomach issues)

	•	I’m acne-prone and I’ve heard whey can make it worse for some people especially for women the side effects are worse.

	•	Taste matters a LOT — if it’s bad, I just won’t drink it

	•	I don’t work out currently (pls don’t judge 😅), I just want better nutrition

	•	I usually wake up late and skip breakfast, so this would be more like a brunch thing for me

I’ve been looking at Cosmix Chikmangalur Mocha protein and wanted honest opinions:

	•	Is it actually good taste-wise?

	•	Should I go for the Pro version or the normal one?

	•	Is it really tested by Trustified or is that just marketing?

Also — my usual drink is cold coffee:

Davidoff coffee + Trunativ sugar + ice + tetra pack milk

👉 Can I just mix protein into this and drink it?

(If it tastes weird, I know I’ll quit, so be real with me 😭)

If not Cosmix, are there better options for people with sensitive digestion / acne issues?

Open to non-whey options too if they’re actually drinkable.

Would love real experiences — what worked for you, what didn’t, any brands you’d recommend or avoid.

Not looking for “just take whey bro” replies 😅

**Pick up hire car from Apex Car Rentals** 

* *They had a quick shuttle from the airport to their site, and was the cheapest we could find. We recommend the hybrid Toyota Corolla - we spent so much less on petrol because of it. B-mode allows the battery to recharge down hills and you’ll be winding down plenty on this trip!*

**Cataract Gorge**

* *There is a chairlift ride available for a fee, or you can do a loop of the gorge and walk across the bridge - it looks like it would take a while but we were there less than 30mins.*

**Christmas Hills Raspberry Farm Cafe for lunch**

* *We picked up a punnet of raspberries to take with us on our trip - they didn’t last long.*

**Cradle Mountain Forest Inn (Accomodation)**

* *This was our accomodation for the night, it was cozy and a great way to immerse ourselves in nature ahead of the trip.*

**Devils@Cradle for the nighttime feeding tour**

* *Learn about Tasmanian Devils, spotted quolls and spotted-tail quolls while watching them all get fed. We loved learning while hearing the cute noises the devils made. Devil@Cradle’s conservation efforts are also mentioned.*

We didn’t eat dinner this night, just had some microwaved meals / noodles that we picked up from the supermarket back in Launceston (we also bought a cool bag which was handy for the rest of our trip).

# Day 2: Drive to Strahan

**Coffee at Blue Tree Gallery**

* *Right next to Cradle Forest Inn is Blue Tree Gallery which showcases art by the barista herself. The art was lovely to look at and the coffee was great!*

**A quick stop at Lake Cethana Lookout**

* *Down a few windy twists and turns from the accom is Lake Cethana Lookout - you’ll see the dam and the water held by it. Pretty for a quick stop and look, but not a must.*

**Drive to Strahan**

* *A 2hr drive, we stopped at Tullah to go to the toilet. Lovely scenes of the mountains during this drive, and closer to Strahan you'll see the ocean.*

**Lunch at Molly’s Cafe**

* *A milk bar with some yummy charcoal chicken was worth the stop for us hungry gremlins.* 

**Check-in to the chalet at Gateway To The Gordon (Accomodation)**

* *If you’re a couple or a group who can deal with stairs, the chalets are quiet, private (except for the barbecue in the garden which the two chalets share), and have a lovely view of the water. At dusk/dawn, we saw wallabies!*

**Fancy dinner at Risby Cove Restaurant**

* *Delicious and our table had a beautiful view of the water. Great cocktails and service.*

# Day 3: Gordon River Cruise

**Gordon River Cruise (Sarah Island)**

* *This will take up the whole day and is a must. The boat is smooth and modern, with a nice buffet lunch. The tour included a tour guide who spoke to us about the history of where we were, and snippets of historical figures played on the tv's to further teach us about life back then. We saw dolphins which the boat stopped for, and it turned around to give every seat a view. We paid for window seats which I recommend. We disembarked in two places - down the Gordon River to learn about the trees, and on Sarah Island for a tour.* 

**A look in Wilderness Woodworks**

* *After learning about huon pine on the boat cruise, we had a look at the Wilderness Woodworks shop at all of the lovely products they had. Pricey but good quality - you can even purchase planks of huon pine to do your own crafting at home eg. to make a chopping board (they also had those for sale).*

**Fish & Chips from Westerly Seafood**

* *Fresh and tasty - the perfect takeaway dinner back at the chalet after a big day. The fish was excellent. Bonus: A man pulled up offering fresh strawberries - we had the exact amount of change for a punnet which were juicy and delicious.* 

# Day 4: Strahan to Hobart

**Start your drive to Hobart (4hr 30min)**

**Iron Blow Lookout**

* *Stunning views of Queenstown's surrounds, with signage detailing the history of the site (mined for primary iron ore).* 

**Lunch at Hungry Wombat Cafe, Derwent Bridge**

* *Pies and meals to keep us from getting hangry. If we had more time, we would have paid for entry to The Wall - good to know if you plan to split the drive up over two days and stay in the area.*

**Check-in to Duke Cottage in Hobart (Accomodation)**

* *We HIGHLY recommend staying with Michelle at Duke Cottage (airbnb). It was genuinely a home away from home, with the added bonus of the best cookies in the world baked with love.*

**Dinner at Bar Wa Izakaya**

* *Slightly spenny but an awesome atmosphere and izakaya (like tapas) Japanese food.*

**Dessert from Frosty N Treats** 

* *Only recently opened, this little ice-cream shop stocks Valhalla ice-cream and I HIGHLY recommend the lavender flavour if you’ve never tried it.*

# Day 5: ‘Chill’ day

I actually spent this day flying to Melbourne and back as I was performing at the Aus Open, so I didn’t do anything in Hobart but visit the airport twice! However this is a good ‘*chill*’ day to split the rest of the days up. Something I didn’t get to do but would have loved to, is go on the Red Decker bus which is a hop-on hop-off bus that goes around a number of city highlights - think historical sites, galleries, gardens. You can hop off and explore a sight, then hop back on as there are many buses that loop around all day.

# Day 6: MONA

* *While the website recommends taking the boat, you can drive there - I’d recommend getting there within the first hour of it opening to get parked, and so you have the full day to explore. If you want to read up on any piece of artwork, you'll need the app on your mobile device.*

**Lunch at The Source Restaurant**

* *We paired our MONA visit with lunch at The Source and were blessed with a corner window seat. The cauliflower is a fan favourite and I can highly attest to its historical ratings. If there’s anywhere in the world where you should venture out of your gastronomic comfort zone, I reckon this is the place to do so.*
* There was also live music outside on the stage which was a great addition!

**Hobart Float Wellness Spa & Massage**

*Bonus: I was completely physically wrecked from my rockstar touring the day before, so went and got a massage from Hobart Float Wellness Spa & Massage. It was the best massage I’ve had - I genuinely was struggling to put my clothes on afterwards because I felt so loose. It was incredible.* 

# Day 7: Port Arthur

**Port Arthur Historic Site**

* *I highly recommend doing the Premium Tour - it covers a lot of history, and links back to Sarah Island which we visited on Day 3 of this itinerary.*

**A sweet treat Tasmanian Chocolate Foundry** 

* *If you’re up for it, pop into Tasmanian Chocolate Foundry. The milk chocolate honeycomb block is fantastic.* 

# Day 8: Salamanca Market

**Splurge at Salamanca Market**

* *The market runs on Saturdays, and is worth the visit. It gets packed so park further away if you’re able. Otherwise there is paid parking on Montpelier Retreat which is nice and close.* 
* *There is plenty of food and a variety of stalls with everything from pottery, to art, to clothes, to huon pine goods. Some stalls have tastings (free fudge!!).*
* *Dinner at Urban Greek Restaurant - great service!*

# Day 9: Hobart to Bruny Island

**Colesworth**

* *Go food shopping prior to leaving Hobart if you plan on cooking at the accomodation - we cooked dinner on the our first night, and ate at the pub the second night.*

**Sealink Bruny Island Ferry**

* *The ferry queue can vary depending on the time you go - we went at midday.* 

**Bruny Baker Bread Fridge**

* *Pick up some fresh sourdough from the Bruny Baker Bread Fridge, on Bruny Island road. You will be in and out of service across the island so be wary.* 

**Lunawanna Makers Market**

* *If you’re following this itinerary, then you may be able to catch Lunawanna Makers Market depending on the week - it runs the first and third Sunday of each month. The* *Wishful Thinking Co truck was at the market and sold excellent cookies and apple juice.*

**Know Where To Hide (Accomodation)**

* *I highly recommend this accomodation as it has an ocean view outside the bedroom window, has a kitchen, and the pub is a short walk away. You’ll see pademelons and wallabies and dusk/dawn, and might even see a white wallaby if lucky!*

# Day 10: Bruny Island Cruise

**Head to the cruise, stopping by Coal Point**

* *On the side of the road, stop here and enjoy the view.*

**Pennicott Journeys - Bruny Island Cruise**

* *You will see and learn a lot about the island - it’s a must while you’re here. When else do you get to see seals?!*
* *The boat is quite rocky - I HIGHLY recommend taking the ginger tablets they offer to combat sea sickness, and listen to their instructions on how to manage your seasickness.*

# Day 11: Bruny Island to Hobart Airport

**Truganini Lookout** 

* *It’s time to say goodbye to Tasmania. Stop by Truganini Lookout on Bruny Island as you’re heading back to the ferry.* 

**Colesworth** 

* *Stop buy a supermarket and stock up on Duck River Butter - I regret only buying three blocks to bring home with me. I’m addicted!*

**Lunch in Hobart**

* *Grab a bite to eat before you head to Apex Car Rentals (who will shuttle you to the airport). Choose a random cafe to explore like a local!*

**Hobart Airport**

* *When flying out, if you’re on the right side of your plane, keep a look out for Bruny Island as you will be able to see Bruny Island.*

*Now, this itinerary took me hours and hours to make, and then re-write for Redditland.

I apologize for the long post but I’m only posting this because a friend is convinced this girl wanted me to talk to her, but I’m almost certain she was just fishing for attention and an ego boost. I haven't seen her in a while, so I assume it’s over anyway, but I mainly just want to know what was actually going on.

**Full disclosure:** I consume a fair amount of ""black pill"" content and haven't spoken to a girl in about 4 years, so my social skills are basically non-existent. I’m looking for an honest, non-biased insight into this.

I’m a 22M and a regular at my gym. About 4 months ago, I started noticing this girl (around 19-21) who shows up once or twice a week. I go late in the evening (like 10pm ish), so it’s usually the same small group of people, and she’s one of the few girls there, so she’s hard to miss.

The first couple of weeks were standard gym stuff, catching her and her friend staring, mirroring my movements, double takes from her, and catching eye contact in the mirrors. There was definitely some weird tension. One night, I was working out near her and her friend with my volume low, and I distinctly heard her tell her friend, “He’s so hot.” I wasn't 100% sure it was about me, so I got awkward, put my head down, and moved to a different area. Shortly after, I saw her go up to another guy and make small talk. It seemed platonic, but it made me think I was being delusional about the earlier comment. I decided to just go cold, avoid eye contact, and move on.

About two weeks later, the energy changed. she couldn't hold eye contact with me for more than half a second without swiftly looking away, She started doing her entire workout right in my immediate area. She began invading my personal space, walking unnecessarily close (like within 3 feet) and taking long paths just to pass by me. One day she walked past me three times; on the fourth time, she super close, walked extra slow and started laughing with her friend right after they passed. My buddy even told me that when I went upstairs to the change rooms, she did a literal 180 and followed me up immediately.

That same week, she showed up with her hair dyed blonde and done up in waves instead of her normal curly hair, wearing full makeup. When I caught her sneaking a glance at me that day, she gave me this flustered, playful grin. .

The most intense interaction happened recently. She took a machine right in front of me (one I’ve never even seen her use), tucked her shirt into her bra to expose her back, and did her set. When she finished, she stared right at me, then over-exaggeratedly bent over to clean the machine directly in my line of sight. She stared at me again while doing it (which I ignored), before walking past me incredibly close.

2 weeks later, I was sitting in my car finishing a coffee before heading in. I saw her leaving, and as she drove past, she turned her head and stared at me through the glass for a solid 4 seconds. The very last day I saw her, she was leaving the gym and kept turning around to look back at me while she was walking up the stairs.

This all played out over 3-4 months and throughout those months, i would notice her ad the guy I mentioned earlier talking here and there but I have no clue what their relationship is. Was she genuinely interested and I blew it by being ""cold,"" or was this all just a calculated way to get a reaction out of a guy for an ego boost?",1,1770533060.0,bodylanguage,1,1.0,False
1qz1v95,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness_India/comments/1qz1v95/protein_powder_recs_for_someone_who_doesnt/,Protein powder recs for someone who doesn’t tolerate milk well + acne issues?,"Hey folks! 👋

Need some genuine advice from people who’ve actually tried different protein powders.

I’ve been wanting to add protein to my routine, but I’ve been putting it off because:

	•	Milk/dairy doesn’t suit me that well (small amounts are fine, too much = stomach issues)

	•	I’m acne-prone and I’ve heard whey can make it worse for some people especially for women the side effects are worse.

	•	Taste matters a LOT — if it’s bad, I just won’t drink it

	•	I don’t work out currently (pls don’t judge 😅), I just want better nutrition

	•	I usually wake up late and skip breakfast, so this would be more like a brunch thing for me

I’ve been looking at Cosmix Chikmangalur Mocha protein and wanted honest opinions:

	•	Is it actually good taste-wise?

	•	Should I go for the Pro version or the normal one?

	•	Is it really tested by Trustified or is that just marketing?

Also — my usual drink is cold coffee:

Davidoff coffee + Trunativ sugar + ice + tetra pack milk

👉 Can I just mix protein into this and drink it?

(If it tastes weird, I know I’ll quit, so be real with me 😭)

If not Cosmix, are there better options for people with sensitive digestion / acne issues?

Open to non-whey options too if they’re actually drinkable.

Would love real experiences — what worked for you, what didn’t, any brands you’d recommend or avoid.

Not looking for “just take whey bro” replies 😅

Thanks in advance 🫶

I have a Baratza Encore (not the newer one) and struggling with this! I've also got a Delonghi Dedica. I also have an non pressurized 51mm basket. I also use that silver disk on top of the puck, as well as using a WDT. 

No matter what I do I can't get close to the brew ratio.

If I weigh 18g of coffee and grind it on the lowest setting. I mean click 1, not the mark 1 on the grinder it's got a fine grind. I then tamp hard.

Then after 20s of pull, it always pulls 65g or sometimes 90g of coffee when I believe it should be closer to 35g!

How do I get a slower extraction? I've ground the finest and tamped hard. What else can I try to increase the pull time?

I’m a 33M looking to team up with one or two responsible individuals to secure a solid place in Burnaby, Coquitlam, or New Westminster.

In this economy, renting solo on a budget is nearly impossible. I’m looking to bypass the ""roommate lottery"" by finding people now so we can vet each other and hunt for a high-quality 2-bedroom (or a 3-bedroom if we find the right third) together.

The Strategy:

• Timing: Start the search/tours 2–3 months out so we aren't rushing.

• Location: Near Skytrain preferred (Burnaby, New West, or Coquitlam).

• Process: Meet for coffee first \\bm{\\rightarrow} Align on budget \\bm{\\rightarrow} Apply as a solid group.

About Me:

• Working professional, clean, and extremely reliable with rent/bills.

• Quiet during the week; I value a peaceful, organized home.

• I’m looking for a ""co-pilot""—someone who is responsive, proactive, and can pass a standard credit/income check.

Requirements:

• Stable income and a track record of being a responsible tenant.

• Clear communication (no ghosting).

• Respectful of shared spaces and noise levels.
