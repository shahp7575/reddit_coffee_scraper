She told me not to drink sugary drinks , drink juice/smoothies, or put sugar in my tea/coffee which I genuinely never do any of those things. I asked her if it was my brushing that was the issue, and she told me it was a high sugar diet.  I do not think I have a high sugar diet at all. I am vegetarian and mostly plant based, I don't drink alcohol or smoke.  I usually eat dessert once a day after dinner (but not every day), and then I eat porridge with fruit and seeds for breakfast; some kind of leftovers for lunch/a sandwich  and then homecooked meals for dinner- curries/stirfrys/pasta dishes. I do eat quite high carbohydrate but its whole foods sources usually. I drink tea throughout the day with milk and no sugar maybe 5x times. The main issue I can assume I have is that I eat fruit many times a day (3-4), and sometimes up to 6.  She told me it can't be the fruit causing the decay.

1jys2fb,https://www.reddit.com/r/fragranceaustralia/comments/1jys2fb/ocma_fragrances_discovery_set_review/,OCMA Fragrances discovery set review,"OCMA is owned and run by two self-taught Australian perfumers. There's not a massive amount of openly available info about them, but I know one of them lurks here from time to time. They won an award for one of their fragrances last year.

Picked up the discovery set from [OCMA Fragrances](https://www.ocmafragrances.com/shop/p/discovery-set) sometime last year and finally got around to trying them out (because when I clean up I put things in places that I don't remember where they are).

It's made up of 5 noticeably different scents:

1. Velvet Underground - Pink Peppercorn, Bergamot, Cashmere, Blonde Tobacco, Iris, Sumatran Benzoin, Smoked Vanilla, Patchouli. Opening was perhaps a little harsh (though more because I'm not the biggest fan of pink pepper or bergamot), but smooths down into a sweet vanilla laced tobacco - the coumarin aspect isn't so strong that it makes your brain hurt, and is probably more along the lines of tonka bean than actual tobacco (by which I mean the smell I got from nicking dad's empty cigarette packets and breathing in the leftover remnant tobacco that clung to the inside). Pleasant.
2. Generator Party - Blue Iris, Bergamot, White Cedar, Jasmine, Desert Air, Patchouli, Incense, Vanilla. Sweet faintly floral incense opening, that dries down into the hint of one of those new-age shops you find in small towns along the coast. That's probably the jasmine and incense. Nice, but to me it didn't last very long - maybe a couple hours at most, though that may be because of everything else I had sprayed around at the time.
3. Matiere Obscure - Cardamom, White Grapefruit, Damask Rose, Incense, Cinnamon, Nude Musc, Amber, Vanilla. I don't recall what cardamom smells like, but it's definitely cinnamon. And not like the kind in a lot of cinnamon fragrances where it's overpowering - it's more of a supporting feature. Maybe a faint hint of rose in the opening, but I'm not sure. Drinking iced coffee while smelling this brings about memories of biscotti.
4. Green Abyss - Monstera, Matcha, Petrichor, Moss, Jasmine Sambac, Cedarwood, Vetiver, Tonka Bean. Opening is kind of coconut-esque mixed with some floral aspect. Possibly the jasmine. First run through of this had it lean towards some kind of green tea and biscuit before turning soapy. The previous three I liked, but not this one. I don't like jasmine sambac or green tea, though, so take that opinion with a bucket of salt.
5. Sun Phaser - Tulip, Lemon Meringue, Neroli, Coconut, Silk Musk, Sandalwood, Vanilla Bean, Patchouli. Flowers and lemon in the opening, with the neroli being the most recognisable. Couldn't pick out any coconut. It's not offensive, and I'm sure that most people would like this one, but I dislike lemon and coconut, and have mixed feelings about sandalwood.

I don't like the vast majority of fragrances that I encounter, so the fact that this one had 3 that I thought were okay is a bit of a miracle. Even the ones I didn't like I can see the appeal of to other people. I can see why they won that award.

If you want to check them out for yourself the link is at the top of this post. I'm not affiliated with them at all, but as a wannabe perfumer myself I think it'd be good to support the locals doing it themselves here.

I'll be back sometime soon with the next lot from Mr. Hux (spoiler: it's not very positive).",1,1744611186.0,fragranceaustralia,0,1.0,False

I have now decided to make my own hash due to that the price of a kilo of regular (krippy) is slow enough for it to be worth it. 
I want to make the dry sift method and then try on doing some static of my own.
I don’t want to order or import something from overseas so I thought the easiest way was to buy the printing frames here local but I they only use 40 to 120 microns on their screens 
I will buy 
1 screen with 77micron 
1 screen with 120 micron 
And 2 empty frames in hope I eventually find screens with bigger microns. 
Wanted to have a 250 screen as work screen then maybe a 160 before the 120. 
Will I lose to much hash using the 120 as work screen? Any tips? Think I maybe could get bigger microns in a stainless steal kind of “net” 
Or maybe a flour sieve or so

- Weird introductions
- Bothering you every 10 min to ask of everything is ok (but never being there when you really need them)

These posts always inspired me so I’ll keep it short and hopefully this can help someone else. I tested on March 27 but had been preparing for this exam since August. 

I am a US-IMG and started preparing with possibly the worst foundation ever. I never did well on in-house exams and legit barely scraped by. I also never watched B&B, Pathoma, or anything else basically, so you can just imagine how weak my foundation was.

I took a baseline NBME 31 and scored a 35% in August. This gave me literally a 2% chance of passing. I freaked out and was like what do I do?? Everyone online told me to do UWorld and cram the qbank out so I did that. A month passed by and I literally did not improve at all. This was because my foundation totally sucked and I quickly realized I needed to actually understand medicine to answer the questions. 

I bought Pathoma in early September and started to memorize it LINE BY LINE. I went through every chapter and video and did ALL of the corresponding Anking. This took me 2 months. In mid-November I decided to take NBME 26 and I scored a 50%. By this time, I was really panicking (I was scheduled to take the exam originally in January)! 

I then did 2 intensive weeks of UWorld and even unsuspended the corresponding Anki cards. In early December, I took NBME 30 and scored around a 55%. By this time I was having mental breakdowns every single day.

What really changed was genuinely reviewing the NBMEs. I seriously reviewed every single question and annotated FA and watched the B&B video to every single question I got wrong. However I still didn’t feel ready to take the exam in January and postponed it to March. During this time, I took all the NBMEs (see my previous post) and genuinely memorized and understood every single concept I saw. 

I took the Free 120 5 days before my exam and scored a 68%. 2 days before my exam, I took the old Free 120 and scored a 63%.

The night before the exam, I memorized both of the NBME High Yield images document. This was extremely helpful for my actual exam!! 

The real exam day, I slept 9 hours. I woke up slowly and had coffee with my partner in the morning and even went on a walk. I came in refreshed. The real exam was more like UWorld in terms of format, but had NBME concepts. I felt like I did okay, but convinced myself I had failed. 

Last Wednesday I found out I finally passed this exam!! It was a long hard journey and I’m glad this chapter is finally over. Feel free to ask me any questions!! Good luck everybody!! 

TLDR; no Mehlman ever because I didn’t want to artificially inflate my scores. Did content review and memorized Pathoma! Did Anking religiously also. ",1,1744610812.0,step1,0,1.0,False

I am making this post to get some advice about how I should proceed with this application.

The problem is I applied fast internally as I didn't want to miss my chance but I also want to build a relationship with the hiring manager. I'm leery of reaching out after applying as I don't want it to seem like I am expecting special treatment but I also want to get to know the job before possibly jeopardising my current role. At the same time this role seems really exciting.

1jyrwl9,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Best-Bonus-4525/comments/1jyrwl9/the_murmur/,The murmur.,"The static started subtly, a high-pitched whine only dogs seemed to notice. Then the colors began to bleed. Not violently, like a spilled inkwell, but a slow, gentle osmosis. The red of the stop signs would seep into the beige of the buildings, the blue of the sky would tint the green of the grass a sickly teal. We called it the Murmur.

At first, it was almost beautiful, a living watercolor painting. People took pictures, marveling at the shifting hues. But then the textures started to change. Skin felt like damp velvet, asphalt like coarse sandpaper. Food tasted vaguely of cinnamon, no matter what it was. Our reflections started to…drift. Not move away, but become slightly out of sync, like a badly dubbed film.

Old Man Hemlock was the first to go completely. One Tuesday morning, his house was just…gone. Not demolished, not burned, just an empty patch of perfectly normal grass. His cat, Mittens, was still there, though. Except Mittens had seven eyes, arranged in a lopsided spiral on her forehead, and she hummed a tune no human ear could quite grasp.

Then the whispers began. Not spoken words, but thoughts, intrusive and alien. They weren't *your* thoughts, but they felt intimately familiar, like half-forgotten dreams. They spoke of geometries that shouldn't exist, of colors beyond our spectrum, of a hunger that wasn't quite physical.

My neighbor, Sarah, started collecting teeth. Not her own, but teeth she found in the park, embedded in the bark of trees, nestled in the folds of discarded newspapers. She'd arrange them on her windowsill in intricate patterns, muttering about ""the chorus"" and ""the perfect alignment.""

One night, I woke up to find my hands weren't quite mine. They were longer, the fingers too slender, the nails a pearlescent white that seemed to glow faintly in the dark. They moved with a strange, unsettling grace, tracing patterns on my blanket I didn't recognize. I tried to scream, but the sound that came out was a wet, clicking noise, like insects scuttling under damp leaves.

Looking in the mirror was worse. My face was still there, but the features were subtly…wrong. My eyes were too large, too round, and they seemed to focus on something just behind me, something I couldn't see. My mouth was wider, the lips thin and stretched, and when I opened it, there was no tongue, only a smooth, obsidian void.

The Murmur intensified. The colors swirled and pulsed, the textures shifted and writhed. The whispers became a deafening cacophony, a symphony of impossible angles and unspeakable desires. The world around us was unraveling, not with a bang, but with a slow, deliberate peeling away of reality.

I tried to leave Sand Lake, but the roads twisted and turned, leading me back to my own street no matter which way I drove. The signs had changed, the letters rearranged into nonsensical glyphs. The gas stations sold a viscous, black fluid that smelled faintly of ozone and regret.

Now, I mostly just sit in my living room, the seven-eyed Mittens purring a silent song on my lap. My hands tap out rhythms on the worn wood of the coffee table, rhythms that echo the whispers in my head. The walls of my house breathe softly, the wallpaper rippling with unseen currents.

Sometimes, I catch a glimpse of my reflection and see not my own face, but something else entirely. Something ancient and vast, with eyes like dying stars and a smile that promises a knowledge that would shatter my sanity. And sometimes, just sometimes, I think it smiles back.

The Murmur is getting louder. I think it's trying to tell us something. I just don't know if I want to understand. I don't know if anyone does. Because once you truly hear the Murmur, you can never un-hear it. And once you see what's behind the colors, you can never un-see it. And then… then you become part of it. And that, I suspect, is the weirdest and most terrifying part of all.",1,1744610508.0,u_Best-Bonus-4525,0,1.0,False

When i was 11-12 a drunken adult in his probably 40's pined me down on the bed, holding both of my hands restricted and he asked me sexual inappropriate questions. I was terrified and frozen. I had no reaction whatsoever. His girlfriend opened the door and dragged hin out. I was shaking and felt i did something wrong to her. I was embarrassed to say to anybody and became extremely hyper alert to male adults. Didn't feel safe and i was afraid of sexual assault. 
When i was 14-15 i slept in the bed with my aunt and uncle because the hause was full. They were my second set of parents. My aunt left to prepare coffee in the morning and my uncle started breathing in me and stuck his hand under my tshirt and rubbed my back sexually. I feel so disgusted to think he probably had an errection. I mean he was like my dad in my mind. I frost again. I couldn't react and just hopped he stopped, but he just continued. Eventually i was able to run and said i need water. I was extremely confused and i kept it in me for all this years. Im 37 years now and i still feel sick. 
Then on top of that at 16 my first boyfriend took my virginity (fingers, sorry for tmi) without my consent. I thought i got my period. But then it stopped and i just again didnt even understood what happened to me. I figured it out when i was in my 20's. 

It all contributed to me... suffering of all this development issues, my depression, my no sense of self. You know, im sorry for that girl. Im really sorry. And i want to just say it out loud and it to be acknowledge that it was wrong. I was a child and deserved better. I don't have ptsd, but it caused a development trauma.

It has been a year, I will not dwleve into the details because it would be a long story, naturally then for you the reader it would be hard to get the full context but I will try my best to really talk to you with my emotions here.

I was dumped by my 4 year long best friend and 2 year long gf last year (2024) at around the early February. It has been due for a while. It was my first real relationship which ever happened to me after school (i didn't have a gf at school so this around post school)

We knew each other from our school, there is a big drama that happened after which we walked out separate paths, with the weird thing we call as fate she came back to me once (we weren't in any relationship before just friends, although I did have a crush on her). After that drama in school I became very determinent in life at that moment I had lost everything so I worked on everything that is no lost MYSELF, workout, reading, meditation, personal hobbies, you name it I did it. 

Naturally my confidence and self esteem grew as well as my patience, grades and drive for future. Since by this time we had walked separate paths already I did forget about her until we met again. In the beginning she was in a bad state when we met again, I was having the time of my life, I was excited for college, A new beginning, MY BEGINNING, Everything i couldn't achieve in school, I was determined to do in college.

However as cliche as it sounds with the course of events, I feel for her.....she was in an abusive household, In the beginning I just listened and gave advice, soon we turned into bffs then casual then relationship.

This was my first proper relationship, I was hesitant because I didn't knew the dynamic of a relationship well. I just knew how to care for someone but not how to play the relationship politics. So that's what I did just loved her.....soon I did the wrong things, I gave up a lot of my life for her ..... something I never thought I would do again but it Happened subconsciously. And soon conflits rose, attraction dropped. I wanted to breakup but I was worried for her, she had a bad health condition, and sensitive to pain, I didn't wanted to hurt her badly....

And so it happened one dreadful afternoon I texted her ""did you wake up?"" While having my evening coffee before going ahead to teach my highschool students.

She said those words one would rather not face ""I want to break up with you"".....

So it began, First 24 hours I didn't register it well, there was also a sense of relief like ""well atleast it's over, I am free nowww..."" Then the next 24 hours it hit.....and when it hit, I couldn't take it.....

My exams were starting that week onwards she knew it, her exams had just ended, so the timing couldn't be better.....she played it to her advantage to save her own skin as best as she could.....

My body and mind went through unimaginable amounts of pain, the exams, the stress, the confusion,

My mom got really worried, I had to ask her to drop me to college for the first time in my life so that I can give my exams. I had to sleep beside my parents so that I can feel some warmth and my loneliness doesn't swallow me whole.

Everyday I begged to die....in sleep she was there in dreams, in waking she was there in memories, and just when I thought nothing more can happen....

She started to post about her new life online.....she is not someone who does that but she did, she never got permission to go out so often from her family, that was part of the reason why we had fights....but now...

Every other day, girls day outs, going out for lunch, dinner, even with people both of us despised at once....

My friends and family worked hard to keep me sane, after a point my family even turned on me thinking I am just going overboard with pain....

While she took a family trip and made sure to post everything. Dps were changed every few days and statues/stories were always live.


I felt defeated......

After my exams, I waited, I waited for a final closure conversation, After she came back from trip (I knew the dates because we had talked about it during the prior months).

I texted her and we had the conversation which pains me to even remember, she used every cent of higher power in her hand to humiliate me, change contests to things, made sure she only showed me my poison and in the end told me....

""I would gladly tear you apart right now, it's just I don't want tooo...""

....


Cut to now, I am feeling a lot better, she is not in my thoughts anymore, what is is a sense of loss, I have always been a workaholic and someone who quits on going out and having fun ...

So this time onwards I tried I tried to take up as many chances of going out having fun meeting people as much as I can. 

But nothing seems whole, there is something in me which is scared, which wants to get the upperhand


And most importantly I don't find so much joy in staying at home anymore and just working like I used too, previously I felt I am doing it for a better future (not with her just in general coz I felt tht even before that)..


Now I feel ""is there even a future?"" ""I failed to have a different college life""(this thought is biased but yes I feel that) ""will I be able to have a different life?""

...

I just want to believe in my future again to know that just because I didn't make it here doesn't mean I won't in the future as well, there are a lot of good things and improvements in life that happened during my time at college and I am really grateful for that, But Just it feels like I am going through another lonely chapter in life....

1jyrs1m,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jyrs1m,32 [M4F] #California - Looking for my Partner (●'◡'●),"Hey there! Thanks for dropping by—glad my virtual charm caught your attention! 😉

I'm Sam—32, Asian, and happily soaking up the sunshine here in beautiful California. I'm a Nurse Practitioner by day, so you could say I'm pretty good at matters of the heart (and health!). I'm Catholic, though not particularly political or conservative—think of me as thoughtfully balanced. Single, never married, and no kiddos yet, but I'm hoping to change that one day with the right person!

People describe me as mature, ambitious, supportive, and maybe a tad bit practical. Open and clear communication is my love language—so if you speak your mind, we're already off to a great start. I'm a straight shooter: if you're feeling annoyed, busy, or even just craving some space, tell me! No mind-reading skills here—I'm medical, not magical. 😉

What am I looking for? A teammate. A partner-in-crime. Someone who believes in growing together, having each other's back, and cheering each other on toward our dreams. I've proudly cheered friends into becoming physicians and psychologists, and I'd love to cheer you on too (pom-poms optional). And yes, I'm looking to find this connection right here on Reddit—because why not believe in a little digital destiny?

I'm pretty active and hit the gym 3-5 times a week—I find running incredibly freeing. Beyond fitness, music steals my heart—I collect vinyl records, play piano, and dabble in creating music. Bonus points if you appreciate a good cocktail, because I'm quite the mixologist. 🍸 Non-smoker, no drugs, no gambling, and a clean health record. I enjoy social drinks, fantasy novels filled with dragons and epic quests, and leisurely weekends spent cozying up in coffee shops or treasure-hunting in record stores.

I love travel! I attached several travel pics of mine. Hopefully, we can wander Europe together! Tell me about your most memorial travel memory! 

Oh, and I don't play games—I have a Sudoku app on my phone and that's all 😁

If you're intrigued, send me a message with a bit about yourself—bonus points for clever intros! Also, I'm big on mutual verification, so let’s both make sure we're the real deal. I'm okay doing LDR as long as you are willing to meet up in real life soon. 

Thanks for making it this far. Wishing you endless HEALTH, WEALTH, and HAPPINESS—and maybe a little magic too! ✨",2,1744609999.0,ChristianDating,0,1.0,False

It has been a year, I will not dwleve into the details because it would be a long story, naturally then for you the reader it would be hard to get the full context but I will try my best to really talk to you with my emotions here.

I was dumped by my 4 year long best friend and 2 year long gf last year (2024) at around the early February. It has been due for a while. It was my first real relationship which ever happened to me after school (i didn't have a gf at school so this around post school)

We knew each other from our school, there is a big drama that happened after which we walked out separate paths, with the weird thing we call as fate she came back to me once (we weren't in any relationship before just friends, although I did have a crush on her). After that drama in school I became very determinent in life at that moment I had lost everything so I worked on everything that is no lost MYSELF, workout, reading, meditation, personal hobbies, you name it I did it. 

Naturally my confidence and self esteem grew as well as my patience, grades and drive for future. Since by this time we had walked separate paths already I did forget about her until we met again. In the beginning she was in a bad state when we met again, I was having the time of my life, I was excited for college, A new beginning, MY BEGINNING, Everything i couldn't achieve in school, I was determined to do in college.

However as cliche as it sounds with the course of events, I feel for her.....she was in an abusive household, In the beginning I just listened and gave advice, soon we turned into bffs then casual then relationship.

This was my first proper relationship, I was hesitant because I didn't knew the dynamic of a relationship well. I just knew how to care for someone but not how to play the relationship politics. So that's what I did just loved her.....soon I did the wrong things, I gave up a lot of my life for her ..... something I never thought I would do again but it Happened subconsciously. And soon conflits rose, attraction dropped. I wanted to breakup but I was worried for her, she had a bad health condition, and sensitive to pain, I didn't wanted to hurt her badly....

And so it happened one dreadful afternoon I texted her ""did you wake up?"" While having my evening coffee before going ahead to teach my highschool students.

She said those words one would rather not face ""I want to break up with you"".....

So it began, First 24 hours I didn't register it well, there was also a sense of relief like ""well atleast it's over, I am free nowww..."" Then the next 24 hours it hit.....and when it hit, I couldn't take it.....

My exams were starting that week onwards she knew it, her exams had just ended, so the timing couldn't be better.....she played it to her advantage to save her own skin as best as she could.....

My body and mind went through unimaginable amounts of pain, the exams, the stress, the confusion,

My mom got really worried, I had to ask her to drop me to college for the first time in my life so that I can give my exams. I had to sleep beside my parents so that I can feel some warmth and my loneliness doesn't swallow me whole.

Everyday I begged to die....in sleep she was there in dreams, in waking she was there in memories, and just when I thought nothing more can happen....

She started to post about her new life online.....she is not someone who does that but she did, she never got permission to go out so often from her family, that was part of the reason why we had fights....but now...

Every other day, girls day outs, going out for lunch, dinner, even with people both of us despised at once....

My friends and family worked hard to keep me sane, after a point my family even turned on me thinking I am just going overboard with pain....

While she took a family trip and made sure to post everything. Dps were changed every few days and statues/stories were always live.


I felt defeated......

After my exams, I waited, I waited for a final closure conversation, After she came back from trip (I knew the dates because we had talked about it during the prior months).

I texted her and we had the conversation which pains me to even remember, she used every cent of higher power in her hand to humiliate me, change contests to things, made sure she only showed me my poison and in the end told me....

""I would gladly tear you apart right now, it's just I don't want tooo...""

....


Cut to now, I am feeling a lot better, she is not in my thoughts anymore, what is is a sense of loss, I have always been a workaholic and someone who quits on going out and having fun ...

So this time onwards I tried I tried to take up as many chances of going out having fun meeting people as much as I can. 

But nothing seems whole, there is something in me which is scared, which wants to get the upperhand


And most importantly I don't find so much joy in staying at home anymore and just working like I used too, previously I felt I am doing it for a better future (not with her just in general coz I felt tht even before that)


Now I feel ""is there even a future?"" ""I failed to have a different college life""(this thought is biased but yes I feel that) ""will I be able to have a different life?""

...

I just want to believe in my future again to know that just because I didn't make it here doesn't mean I won't in the future as well, there are a lot of good things and improvements in life that happened during my time at college and I am really grateful for that, But Just it feels like I am going through another lonely chapter in life....

I (25M) recently went to a really small stand-up comedy show—only about 3 people in the audience. Before the show started, I got chatting with this girl who had come along with a male friend. She was really pretty, seemed super chill, and honestly felt way out of my league. We had a light, casual convo before the show started—nothing too deep.

Now, here’s the part that threw me: when she was about to leave, she asked for my Insta. That’s never happened to me before, so I was a bit surprised (and lowkey excited). Throughout the show, I noticed several of the comics (and even the host) were flirting with her or throwing subtle lines, but I kept it normal and respectful. Didn’t want to be just another guy doing the same thing.

The next day, I messaged her saying it was nice meeting her and casually asked if she’d want to join me for an IPL match (or coffee if she preferred something more low-key). I even added that she could bring her friends along if that made it more comfortable or fun—just to keep it easy and not make it seem like a pressure situation.

She responded saying she’d be out of town that weekend and added that she’d let me know when her friends plan something so I could join. She wrapped up with a “was nice meeting you too.”

So now I’m wondering:
	•	Women in your 20s—when you ask a guy for his Insta, is it just friendly or does it sometimes mean there’s a bit of interest?
	•	Was I too quick in asking her to hang out again?
	•	Is the “I’ll let you know when my friends plan something” just a polite way to say no?
	•	Do girls sometimes feel the need to stay friendly when they’ve been hit on a lot that night?

This was literally the first time someone asked me for my Insta, and I think I got hopeful. Not heartbroken or anything—just trying to understand how these things usually go.

TL;DR:
Met a pretty girl at a super small comedy show. We talked briefly, she asked for my Insta. I messaged her next day asking if she’d wanna go to an IPL match (or coffee), mentioned she could bring friends too. She replied she’s out of town and would let me know when her friends plan something.

Its like I am finally feeling as me, and as a result feel Gods love. 
This has been a long road of self denial and hardship of many years. 
I wanted to share some insights:
The only way to reach God is with help of someone who has been there already, you need the help of a teacher. 
Sin is the opposite of God. The only way to reach God is to really put a 1000% in to eliminate all of it from your life. 
I have been noticing in meditations that when I have been extremely disciplined, the reward pays off and I can feel that closeness. 
On days I haven't (eg, I finished my meal at my inlaws, while I was full already 3/4 way through; so gluttony, trying to please others instead of God)my heart simply feels harder, harder to reach, less soft. 
For you to reach God you need to be pure and full of trust, its the only way to have God lead your life. you need to step out of the way to let God in. 
The biggest illusion in our society is the acceptance of sin. Our moral compass is so out of wack that we dont even see right from wrong anymore. This includes the way we treat our body and how we epat is such an important part of the puzzle. 
Anything that is addictive, is something you pkace before God. You make it more important then God so it gets in your way of reach God. The only way is to radically remove everything addictive: wheat, sugar, tea, coffee, social media, netflix. 
What you give is what you get, the same in your relationship with God.

(Really old building means exposed pipes, regular leaks are normal (well, not normal but old pipes are poorly insulated) but sewage leaks ARE NOT NORMAL.) I filed a complaint with the city, but can I sue over this? Are there any things I should keep in mind? What kind of case would this be (so I know what kind of attorney to contact)? Is this a complaint for the business or a complaint for the property manager/owner. Also, should I go to the doctor ASAP (for legal purposes, my eye is okay so far, this happened around 8 hours ago). Thank you for your help.

Important information: historical building with generally speaking historical piping. This business has caused issues for the coffee shop before. This is not the first time pipes have leaked, but it's the first time it's been the freaking toilet sewage line. They've caused other problems but yeah. The piping for their space is fully exposed to the coffee shop below (two story building). 

There were witnesses who were there when I got it in my eye, including employees, my spouse, and my spouse's parents. The owner of the coffee shop went to talk to the owners of the shop upstairs but, since it's not their pipes, there's not a ton they can do.

Actually, I hate it. It's totally disgusting.

But I found [this recipe](https://www.tastingtable.com/1826900/three-ingredient-cottage-cheese-chocolate-mousse/), and I thought - well, lets try it. What's the worst that could happen? It will be disgusting. What is it you ask? It's Cottage Cheese Mousse.

Skeptical, right? So was I.

So the recipe is super easy:

* 1 cup of Cottage Cheese (I bought 0%, but there was 1%, 2% and I think 3.5% but got the lite version)
* 3 tablespoons unsweetened chocolate cocoa
   * I substituted one scoop of chocolate protein powder
* Maple Syrup - to taste

Making this was super easy.

Added the cottage cheese, and one scoop of chocolate protein powder to a food processor, and blended it all together for a few minutes. I did not use Maple Syrup (or any sweetener) even though the recipe calls for it.

Once it's thoroughly blended, this is what the final product looks like:

https://preview.redd.it/op8je2cphque1.png?width=1402&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b6a2d1961ad031375147b20f9efd4d4ff18c11b

So how did it taste you ask?

It was delicious! I was actually quite surprised at how good it tasted. For me, it was sweet enough but my boys did not like it. Said it wasn't sweet at all, and to them very bland but they said if I added sugar, or any sweetener they would probably eat it -- so that's probably a win!

What I'll do differently next time:

* Add some instant (fine) coffee to it to give it a bit of a more mature taste
* Garnish with NSA chocolate filings 

There is probably more you could add to this to make it a truly presentable dessert, but I'm not super creative when it comes to food -- I make it, and I eat it.

But seriously, this is the first time that I actually enjoyed cottage cheese. This is something I would make again.

Oh in terms of servings, this could be two - four servings depending on how you present it. If you use small desert cups then you could probably get four servings out. I ended up with two servings.

In terms of nutritional information (remember, I did not use any sweetener):

4 Servings - 310 Calories (or 78 calories per serving)

* Total Fat - 4g
   * Sat Fat 3g
* Cholesterol 92mg
* Sodium 852mg
* Total Carbs 16g
   * Fiber N/A
   * Sugars 11.5g
* Protein 50g

If you eat one serving, the calories (and carbs) are quite negligible - even if you decide to binge on it, at 310 calories and 16g of carbs you're still doing OK.

I found this very satisfying.

Though I didn't add any maple syrup, this is what I bought - loved the bottle, so I'll probably keep it.  😅

We all know first impressions matter, and let's be real... *a few good photos can totally change the game when it comes to online dating.* Whether it's Hinge, Bumble, or Tinder, having a strong profile with photos that really reflect who we are can help attract the *right* kind of attention.

Here’s the idea:  
Let’s team up and help each other out! We can take turns shooting photos for one another, capturing natural, candid, and confident shots that show off personality, lifestyle, and interests. This isn’t a one-day thing. I’m thinking a couple of casual hangouts over a few days where we hit up a few different locations to keep it fresh and diverse.

Some photo ideas: 🎯 Playing a round of golf or hitting the driving range  
☕ Chilling at a cozy coffee shop  
🍽️ Grabbing food at a fun restaurant or food truck  
🌊 Doing something near water (kayak, paddleboard, etc.)  
🏋️‍♀️ Working out or gym-style action shots  
🚲 Biking, hiking, or something active outdoors  
📖 Hanging with a book at a park or bookstore  
🎨 Visiting a cool art wall or scenic urban spot

Totally open to brainstorming more ideas together! Whether you're a pro at posing or a little camera-shy, we’ll keep it laid back and low pressure. It’s just about helping each other look our best and *showing real life vibes* that stand out.

We met in uni and its been 3 years since we met. Last relationship I had was kinda traumatic (he broke up w/me bc of long distance and he was the first guy I got intimate with) for me so I was reluctant to get into another relationship. I’ve been single for 3 years and I only went 4 dates to coffee shops. 

For the past few months we were kinda joking with each other platonically (or so I thought) but he said he was serious all this time and he was attracted to me. I told him I understood his moves as a joke because he was talking/hooking up with other girls and I have no interest to guys like that. I told him that I didn’t want to get into a relationship and he already knew that but he said our friendship dynamic was kinda distorted and we both wanted someone to get close with (like kissing and stuff). We stopped meeting for two months because of this issue and only talked in messages. 

Few weeks ago we met after a while and decided why not go on with this arrangement since we were both craving physical intimacy. 

The problem is I feel like he is in love with me and only agreed to be FWB because I am not interested in relationships. He knows I am a virgin (only got intimate with other stuff with ex bf) but he is confident that it will change. I have strict rules about intimacy and not comfortable with doing it. But he says it’s okay and we will see when timing is right. We setup some rules to not hookup w/other people or talk with them, or if we met someone we will stop talking immediately and go back to being friends. No dating apps or whatsoever. But ofc if we decided to find someone we will tell each other and stop this thing right away. He says that he is not interested in anyone rn and has no intention downloading dating apps. I told him I might want to meet someone if I am ready for a relationship and he was kinda hurt and got weird that I am thinking about downloading dating apps etc. He said that I can make any rules and he is fine with anything because he feels like I might stop this if I get uncomfortable. So he told me to be the decision maker for everything and he will just follow my lead (He said bc I was talking about negative scenarios of what might happen he thought I wanted to end things with him).

He started talking more about relationship stuff and he started to messaging me more than usual (we mostly send each other funny stuff on ig and tw). He recently bought a bike and he said he wanted to get me a customized helmet only for me to use with cute stuff but I said to him he doesn’t need to spend his money on something like that just for me and he insisted for a while and eventually stopped asking for it for now. But he was kinda sad when I turned him down. He is also studying for masters program and he said that he is not going to have a relationship for that time period (for two years). 

I feel like he is trying to make me convince to be in a relationship with him in the future and thats why he is making these plans and commitments. Maybe he is hoping that we might be in a relationship if we get intimate and spend more time together but I don’t feel that way. We already agreed on to not catch feelings but I feel like he likes me romantically.

1jyqv59,https://www.reddit.com/r/VibeCodeDevs/comments/1jyqv59/how_i_created_a_tsnextjsreactmongo_web_project/,How I Created a TS/NextJS/React/Mongo Web Project with Claude and ~0.001% of My Own Code,"    All ""artifacts"" - the detailed project description, list of implemented features, web links to the working version and GitHub, video of the workflow and interface - are placed at the end of the article.
    
    Recently, I've been unemployed and desperate - wondering what to do next with my strange resume that employers aren't interested in, and generally it seems difficult even for the most professional coders these days - after all, artificial intelligence will soon replace all of us.
    I wrote to my friend asking if anyone in his circle was offering work, and our conversation inspired me to try creating a web project I had long dreamed of, using AI-generated code with minimal, or even without any, coding of my own.
    
    I should mention that although I'm quite good with JS (I even created my own programming language that compiles to JS, similar to CoffeeScript), I know absolutely nothing about TypeScript, NextJS, MongoDB, or even React. I had only a superficial understanding of what Docker is.
    Of course, I tried to ""learn"" React, NextJS, and Mongo, but I never got beyond reading the docs (good thing I'll never have to bother with that again!), so I continued working with Vanilla. For context, I'm a Full Stack developer and stubbornly used PHP for many years, but my last major project was done using NodeJS/Express.
    
    So I embarked on this adventure and decided to create a project I had long envisioned - a visual project manager or planner that allows you to break down projects into tasks and tasks into sub-tasks using AI. You simply specify the name of any project, its description, and receive the tasks that need to be completed to make the project a reality. Any task can also be broken down into sub-tasks. This reduces the hassle of planning - especially for new projects.
    
    Yes, I knew about Cursor and even Windsurf, and later learned about Cline - there's a lot of hype on Twitter about these tools if you follow the right accounts. But something kept me from diving into these technologies, especially considering that for full implementation and goal achievement, you need who knows how much more than $20 for a monthly subscription. So I chose what I liked most at the time - AI from Anthropic, which was also ahead of everyone in coding (now, according to some ratings, it's Gemini 2.5, by the way).
    
    I started working in January and released the production version at the end of March, so all in all it took a little more than 2 months in total, $60, and several hundred (about 400) contextual communications with Claude.
    Initially, it was version 3.5, later 3.7 with Deep Thinking. The difference, I must say, is noticeable. First, 3.5 truncates large bash scripts and large files (yes - I generated files mostly using bash, which allows create several files at once); you have to enter ""Continue"" to continue generating a large bash script or individual file, which is inconvenient because the truncation is often not exactly from the breaking point and happens all the time. Although this drawback is present in 3.7+Thinking, it's not as pronounced, because in the new version with thinking, the response context is much larger.
    
    Claude gives a certain token limit once every 5 hours, so to work effectively in such an environment, I had to set an alarm and wake up at night so as not to lose valuable ""context windows."" If I hadn't done this, it would have added about 2 weeks to the completion time.
    
    Now for the useful part, how exactly you can(?) implement a web project ""of any complexity"" by communicating with any AI that can generate code artifacts.
    
    ## 1. Maximally Detailed Project Description
    The key here is ""maximum details"" and prior planning. Roughly, an additional day of planning, embodied in a detailed description, saves a week of implementation. But even if you start with just a small description - that's acceptable - if you know what to do next. However, if a detailed description isn't provided initially, this will lead to the AI inventing functionality: in some cases, it might be considered useful and appropriate, but sometimes it's something unexpected that can grow into excess and introduce chaos into an already broad structure - as AI tends to ""produce"" more rather than less. Making AI be concise is a difficult task.
    
    ## 2. XML
    Although markdown is also okay, you'll eventually understand that XML is better. In the end, I tried to format almost everything in XML. If you refer to a specific, often nested XML tag in your request, use this syntax: @{leaf of branch of tree}, which will help the AI correctly ""find"" the content of the element <tree><branch><leaf> Content </leaf></branch></leaf>. This query notation @{} was also suggested to me by Claude when I asked how to better work with XML. In general, Claude came up with a large system, which was even called ""programming in XML"", I'll share this chat with Claude https://claude.ai/share/f742bfdf-6e4a-43e9-91ee-208b1243e8c7. The thing is that XML establishes clear boundaries for content parts and allows you to maximally effectively indicate/focus the AI on where to look for what needs to be referenced.
    
    ## 3. Creating and Developing the First Request
    The First Request should be in the form of a highly structured XML template, in the sense that the skeleton of the XML structure will mostly be the same and will be supplemented. I'll provide a generalized skeleton of the XML structure; some elements I later removed, but they were defined initially:
    
    ```xml
    <initial-prompt>
        <metadata>
            Project name, brief description, absolute path to the project directory, database name, database login and password, and so on.    
        </metadata>    
        <project-description>
            Detailed project description in your own words
        </project-description>
        <system>
            Structured transformation of the detailed project description that appeared as a result of a separate request like: ""structure the detailed project description in XML""
        </system>
        <technical-specification>
            Appeared as a result of a separate request like: ""here's a set of desired technologies and technical conditions, project description, structured description - create technical specifications""
        </technical-specification>
        <implementation-hierarchy>
            Appeared as a result of a separate request like: ""here's a set of desired technologies and technical conditions, project description, structured description, technical specifications - create a structure of aspects -> components -> sub-components -> elements in XML""
        </implementation-hierarchy>
        <some-existing-files>
            Some general/technical/configuration files, for example .env, next.config.js, src/middleware.ts
        </some-existing-files>
        <implementation-flow clarification=""used at the stage of creating the component foundation"">
            Division into components: component file structure, interfaces/types, usage examples and integration, tips and purpose.
        </implementation-flow>
        <file-structure>
            XML file structure of a special type of project - not complete files, but paths to files, their purpose, exports and their purpose, usage examples.            
        </file-structure>
        <behavior>
            In 3.5, these were custom instructions for preliminary thinking; also instructions regarding Problem Solving Strategy.    
        </behavior>
        <file-modification-instructions>
            Instructions for ""modification artifacts"" - so that the AI doesn't generate full versions of files, but only information sufficient to change a part: XML modificators.
        </file-modification-instructions>
        <beta-testing clarification=""used in the second stage"">
                Description of beta testing steps with a focus on the uncompleted step <step completed=""false"">

        </updates>
        <context-files clarification=""for the second and third stages"">
            Full versions of context files
        </context-files>
        <request>
            The result of the evolution of a large and in turn structured request:
                - How to work with elements of @{initial-prompt}
                - How to create a bash script for generation
                - <important>, <very-important>, <most-important-tips>, <advise>, <necessities>, <before-response>, <before-starting-implementation>, <before-generating-any-file>, <before-implementation-script-generation>, <rules>, <strict-rule>, <logger>
        </request>
        <additional-request with=""real examples"">
            1) Solve issues action-by-action independently; do not mix solutions for several independent issues; 
            2) Read and learn @{context-files}             
        </additional-request>
        <highest-priority-request>
                ...
        </highest-priority-request>
    <initial-prompt>
    ```
    
    ## 4. Implementation Stages
    I managed to divide the implementation into three stages:
    1) Formation of the component foundation. This is the gradual [project-description -> system -> technical-specification -> implementation-hierarchy] transformation of a detailed description into a component structure (which are constituent parts of aspects). With each separate request, you need to refer to the next component with a requirement for its implementation. At the end of the contextual conversation, when all files, including tests, are formed, you need to generalize the work and supplement @{implementation-flow} - this is so that @{initial-prompt} evolves and contains a generalized implementation. During this stage, the static foundation of the project is created. I ended up with 9 aspects.
    2) Beta testing. Although this is not ""beta testing"" in the broad sense, the name for this stage was suggested to me by the AI. This is the stage of dynamic implementation. For me, the first step was ""Enter the first page, go to the registration page, register."" So, one by one, you describe all the steps of the user flow in a structured way. For beta testing, I created a second version of the @{initial-prompt} template, where I referred to each beta testing step for its implementation. In total, I had 25 steps.
    3) Updates. This is when, after deciding that the project is ready for production, you want to add new features. For this, I created a third version of @{initial-prompt}
    
    ## 5. Backups
    Be sure to save achievements after each successful contextual communication with the AI. Without this, it's impossible. I even, besides git, created a custom backuping script, like @backup latest-fixes and @restore latest-fixes with numbering: backups/latest-fixes1, backups/latest-fixes2, ...
    
    ## 6. Vscode Extensions
    List of extensions I created with the help of AI for automation and improvement of the implementation process:
    * File To XML - converts a file path from the clipboard to XML of its content and path to it to the clipboard
    * Files Modificator - makes changes to files from XML modificator from the clipboard
    * Open Created Files - when files are created using a bash script, they open automatically
    * Shell Script Runner - when a sh file is saved, it runs
    * TypeScript Error Collector - collects error hints generated by Vscode/Eslint into an XML structure in the clipboard
    * XML Compressor - compresses XML into a version without spaces/indents between tags
    
    ## The Story of How This Happened in Practice
    When I started, I had no idea what to do. It was logical to create a project description, to summarize thoughts that had been forming over a long time.
    Then the AI transformed the project description into XML. The next thing I did was, based on the available data and an additional request, create a sh script called setup.sh, which generated files for me that allowed running a Docker container with a NextJS/MongoDB project. (Of course, this didn't work on the first try, but on the... third(?) attempt, meaning I started working on the project implementation 3 times).
    We started generating files for the first components, and I realized that I needed to supplement @{initial-prompt}, so I added @{implemenetation-flow of initial-prompt}, where I placed generalized information about created files (and corresponding capabilities) of the component.
    Even before Claude 3.7 appeared, I created a custom instruction where I indicated to the AI <thinking> before each response. This improved efficiency. To improve efficiency, I also applied several other self-invented methods.
    To @{implementation-hierarchy} I added <tree> of this type:
    Core Infrastructure
    ├──System Logging
    │  └──Logger System
    │     ├──LoggerConfiguration
    │     └──LoggerInstance
    To save on context size, before each start of component implementation, I first added already completed aspects->components in @{implementation-hierarchy} and the current component to be executed, and secondly, later began to remove some components that clearly didn't relate to the currently implemented component.
    Later, with the appearance of Claude 3.7, the problem of context size became less critical, but over time, as the project grew, this problem gradually became more acute, so it was necessary to constantly review what to remove from @{initial-prompt}, what to make more efficiently shortened.
    Often you have to transfer context - this is because the size of the context window of one conversation is 200k tokens. It ends suddenly. To transfer, you need to create a separate XML structured request that should summarize the progress of the current context for continuation in the next one.
    Jest tests were created for each component, so the conclusion of component implementation was Jest testing. I didn't delve into the details of what exactly the tests should be, and in vain. In practice, most of the real testing work was done during beta testing in the form: the AI creates 
    *additional to existing*
     files related to the beta testing step action (for example, user registration), I try to register, if it doesn't work - I describe what exactly, the AI creates new versions of files - and so on in a circle. You constantly have to collect errors that Vscode hints at and iteratively achieve an error-free appearance of files. But besides these preliminary errors, there are also implementation errors/problems - to fix them, you need to describe the problem in detail. If the problem isn't solved, I either try to divide the problem into parts, or restart the context, describing the problem in the defining request already in more detail with the experience of solving it taken into account. Some complex problems were solved on the first try, but some seemingly simple ones - over several days.
    The most difficult task is to get the AI to not generate unnecessary code. Initially, I had a lot of unnecessary code created, but over time, when I learned how to work, I understood how to prepare the defining request, which context files to choose, how to choose them.
    During beta testing, I came to create @{file-structure}. At the end of work on the beta testing action, using a special request, I ask the AI to form a portion of the newly created file structure, which I add to the file-structure.xml file, then using a separate script (created, like all others, with the help of AI) I process file-structire.xml into file-structure-extracted.xml, trying to discard XML structures of files that are not needed for the context. Sometimes I directly ask, through a separate request, which files to take for the next context from the full file structure.
    There is a difference between @{file-structure} and @{context-files}. @{file-structure} contains not full files, but file paths, descriptions of the purpose/application of files, a list of their exports and usage examples. Meanwhile, @{context-files} are full files, often 
    *intended*
     for the next context. In @{request}, I ask the AI before starting work, each time to evaluate the available context files and structure files and suggest additional files that might be needed for the most effective implementation of the task.
    
    ## Logger
    The first component the AI proposed to create was a logger, which is a reworked console.log, for typing messages [info/warn/error/debug]. This is useful because the AI itself forms the necessary information for logs, which had to be copied and pasted into the context from time to time to solve problems. It's worth using such a logger, rather than the standard one, because it can be supplemented. And there is a lot to supplement. For example, over time I understood how to improve logging:
    1) Add styling. Although this is in the standard ones, the defining logger created by the AI didn't have this.
    2) Add keywords. Along with the logger.config.json file, this allowed creating the ability to filter logs by keywords. This is very useful because over time there will be a lot of logs, for example, in my case, possibly 30% of all code in files relates to logs. Although I specified ""more logs"" in the request, but to have so many... Therefore, to provide only the necessary logs, the third argument in my loggers is a list of keywords; I edit logger.config.json, indicating which keywords I need to display logs for now. I'll say that the log filtering function that is in the browser is not enough.
    3) Add technical information about the log file and the line number of the call. In general, the second argument - the object to output can be supplemented with technical/optional ""features"".
    
    ## Tips
    * If you don't understand why the AI isn't following your instructions and this confuses you and you ""give up"" - don't be sad. Just add the instruction that the AI ignores to the <request> again, preferably in other words, preferably framed in a different tag, like <very-strict-rule>. It's the repetition of instructions that increases attention to them and their weight. Tag names matter.
    * Have patience! If after numerous attempts the AI still can't perform a task or solve a problem - take a break and try to rethink the request, break the problem down into component parts and solve them gradually. Avoid trying to solve several problems simultaneously if you're not sure the AI can solve them (with experience, intuition starts to work in this direction). Don't rely completely on the AI, understand the problem/task/question yourself - this will help rethink. Find what is the source/origin of the problem, let the AI analyze it. Let it remake the files from scratch, even if this leads to the loss of secondary functionality. Repeat attempts until the problem is solved - this always works.
    * Keep track of which files relate to which aspect/component. You can create a separate file in which to associate aspects/components or steps/actions of beta testing with a list of corresponding files. This will help quickly resume work in a certain context.
    * Rebuild your thinking. Working with AI, you become like a manager, and the AI - the executor. For success, you need to move away from ""coder thinking"", that is, not to consider the project from the point of view of how you will implement the code. The main skills now become the ability to see the interconnected-whole (holistic view) and the ability to describe what you want to implement.
    
    ## Thoughts About the Future
    Do you need to learn this? After some time, perhaps very soon, or perhaps only after a couple of years, a software project of any complexity can be performed by communicating with AI. Most likely, coding will no longer be for any human (except for some eccentrics). After all, no one multiplies even two-digit numbers without a calculator, right? Is it worth jumping right into this moment: yesterday you were still writing code, and today AI is coding what you describe in your own words. Without a smooth transition? Maybe some will succeed, but the transition path carries risks of losses - not everyone will ""survive"". After all, now one person will be able to do more work than 10 (roughly speaking). So, perhaps it is worth starting to train to interact with AI, because this skill will become the main one for everyone in the future. After this work, I got the feeling that I achieved something very necessary, perhaps not so pronounced now, when the transition is just beginning, but its outlines on the horizon of the future appear with inevitable certainty, waves of transformation force spread a significant influence even on the present time.
    
    ## What Am I Interested in Now?
    I would like to teach interaction with AI - what I learned myself during this project - both to development teams and individually.
    I'm interested in interacting with an enterprising and promising individual to implement a startup; interested in performing a very complex project using AI on order.
    The most exciting thought is to participate in a startup that would deal with the task of fully automating interaction with AI to create web projects.
    
    ## AI Project Planner description.
    - user will be defined by nickname and password, so the home page for the new user will be text-field asking to sign-up or sign-in. user data for auto sign-in and continue session will be stored in localStorage, while user's password with nickname will be stored on backend database;
    - when user signed in, this would be initially a plane area with text field offering to name and describe the project;
    - when user sends a project name and description, it transferred with chosen ai api (openai by default) on frontend, requesting AI to split a described project to separate tasks. ai api is requested directly, not through backend;
    - frontend receives these tasks and build svg structure: on the center of screen is rectangle with project name/description; from center rectangle arrows are drawn to other rectangles that are evenly distributed around the project rectangle, in each rectangle a description of a task appears. each task rectangle has a tangent icon, clicking on which the request is sent to the ai api which splits this task into tasks and return to the frontend. such prompt indicates parent chain of tasks up to project included for understanding context;
    - when task is expanded: task rectangle itself, its child tasks and arrows to them remains visible; arrow from parent project/task rectangle and parent project/task rectangle become half-transparent and put on lower layer; all others svg elements become invisible; child tasks rectangles appeared around task's rectangle with arrows to them from the task (similary like for project -> tasks). such functionality is the same for every ask: task is also can by expanded to its children tasks in similar way;
    - if user click on already previously expanded task or project rectangle, nothing sent to ai api, its children tasks received from backend and hidden/half-transparent rule for svg elements is the same;
    - task rectangle which has children tasks has tangent icon which shows number of direct children and all descendant tasks;
    - name is extracted from project description as - or the first sentence neither the first line on the text;
    - when project's direct children tasks received, existing project data (these tasks specifically) is stored to backend. when a task's children tasks are received - they stored on backend;
    - children rectangles always distributed evenly around parent's rectangle, center of each child rectangle should be on the same distance to centers of nearest/neighbour subling rectangles and distance from center of each child rectangle to center of parent rectangle should be equal to each other. child rectangles should not intersect. distance from parent task/project to task should be defined dynamically, which depends on quantity of children tasks;
    - if text of task is too long, there should be reasonable maximum height of rectangle. width of a rectangle should have also reasonable maximum width;
    - if full text is not fit rectangle size, there is ""show more"" icon shown - when user clicks on such rectangle - it increased to bottom in size and full text is shown;
    - user can move working 2D area by dragging it to all directions (like it realized on maps);
    - zoom is not necessary for this version;
    - system will be designed for further use with any ai api, but initially it will be used with openai api;
    - the backend will be used to store a project data, with it's tasks for the user;
    - the working area, which named ""desk"" or ""deck"" (choose more appropriate), will have fixed pane on the left side with icon on the top left which opens/close this pane, there will be one icon-button when pressed is opened window with text-field, where user put their openai api key which stored in localStorage and will be used for the ai api;
    - task could be regenerated: for this another tangent icon is located on task rectangle; by pushing it, all children tasks hierarchy are removed and with special prompt via ai api is requested text of the new task. in such prompt indicated parent chain of tasks up to project included and sibling tasks, text of current task is not generated and asked to generate one more additional task to sibling tasks
    - task could be deleted: for this another tangent icon is located on task rectangle, by pushing it, all children tasks hierarchy are removed; 
    - before task to be regenerated, user asked to approve regeneration request;
    - on regeneration and removal db and ui are refreshed respectivelly;
    - on the side pane there is icon which opens window where user can choose a project from the list of their projects. when user chooses project it's structure is loaded from backend. when a project is loaded, project's rectangle is shown along with direct child tasks and arrows to them on the center of the screen;
    - projects and tasks are not public and visible only to user who created/own them.

I am making this post to get some advice about how I should proceed with this application. So to provide context I am in the accounting and business service field and have applied for an internal role as a legal assistant/paralegal that appears junior and entry level.

This company is also very large and international level so we don't really have direct managers while working on different clients

The problem is I applied fast internally as I didn't want to miss my chance but I also want to build a relationship with the hiring manager. I'm leery of reaching out after applying as I don't want it to seem like I am expecting special treatment but I also want to get to know the job before possibly jeopardising my current role.

We met in uni and its been 3 years since we met. Last relationship I had was kinda traumatic (he broke up w/me bc of long distance and he was the first guy I got intimate with) for me so I was reluctant to get into another relationship. I’ve been single for 3 years and I only went 4 dates to coffee shops.

For the past few months we were kinda joking with each other platonically (or so I thought) but he said he was serious all this time and he was attracted to me. I told him I understood his moves as a joke because he was talking/hooking up with other girls and I have no interest to guys like that. I told him that I didn’t want to get into a relationship and he already knew that but he said our friendship dynamic was kinda distorted and we both wanted someone to get close with (like kissing and stuff). We stopped meeting for two months because of this issue and only talked in messages.

Few weeks ago we met after a while and decided why not go on with this arrangement since we were both craving physical intimacy.

The problem is I feel like he is in love with me and only agreed to be FWB because I am not interested in relationships. He knows I am a virgin (only got intimate with other stuff with ex bf) but he is confident that it will change. I have strict rules about intimacy and not comfortable with doing it. But he says it’s okay and we will see when timing is right. We setup some rules to not hookup w/other people or talk with them, or if we met someone we will stop talking immediately and go back to being friends. No dating apps or whatsoever. But ofc if we decided to find someone we will tell each other and stop this thing right away. He says that he is not interested in anyone rn and has no intention downloading dating apps. I told him I might want to meet someone if I am ready for a relationship and he was kinda hurt and got weird that I am thinking about downloading dating apps etc. He said that I can make any rules and he is fine with anything because he feels like I might stop this if I get uncomfortable. So he told me to be the decision maker for everything and he will just follow my lead (He said bc I was talking about negative scenarios of what might happen he thought I wanted to end things with him).

He started talking more about relationship stuff and he started to messaging me more than usual (we mostly send each other funny stuff on ig and tw). He recently bought a bike and he said he wanted to get me a customized helmet only for me to use with cute stuff but I said to him he doesn’t need to spend his money on something like that just for me and he insisted for a while and eventually stopped asking for it for now. But he was kinda sad when I turned him down. He is also studying for masters program and he said that he is not going to have a relationship for that time period (for two years).

I feel like he is trying to make me convince to be in a relationship with him in the future and thats why he is making these plans and commitments. Maybe he is hoping that we might be in a relationship if we get intimate and spend more time together but I don’t feel that way. We already agreed on to not catch feelings but I feel like he likes me romantically.

I am making this post to get some advice about how I should proceed with this application. So to provide context I am in the accounting and business service field and have applied for an internal role as a legal assistant/paralegal that appears junior and entry level. I am studying a bachelor of law on the side while working at this company and so I think it would be a good move to work within the field I eventually want to go into once I graduate. This company is also very large and international level so we don't really have direct managers while working on different clients

The problem is I applied fast internally as I didn't want to miss my chance but I also want to build a relationship with the hiring manager. I'm leery of reaching out after applying as I don't want it to seem like I am expecting special treatment but I also want to get to know the job before possibly jeopardising my current role.

Always came about the same time.
big change within last 6 days, I left town for 3 days, husband instructed to put out nuts each a.m. in dish, which he said he did. When I returned he said he hadn’t seen her but dish was empty each day when he checked on it. Next day in morning I resumed ritual of coffee at patio table, nuts in dish for her etc… first day no show… second day no show… around 4:00 p.m. third day she came down fence line as usual did not stop as usual to come onto patio table for nuts. She went to bird feeder on fence, and ate some food out of feeder..when I slowly quietly approached her with almond she seemed skittish and backed away… I gave her a little time and she hesitantly finally took almond, then took off, didn’t come back… same behavior next day just so strange not at all like her. I did notice that her teets/nipples looked a little swollen just wondering if she might have babies in a drey somewhere nearby which would account for behavior change? Anyone else experienced such a drastic behavior change? I’m happy she’s safe and alive but totally baffled by drastic change, also wondering if she was bullied by male squirrel who will also come around for nuts, but not comfortably like she does.

1jyqo4y,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creepystories/comments/1jyqo4y/marcus_makes_a_trade/,Marcus Makes a Trade.,"The bass still vibrated faintly in the floorboards from last night’s small celebration. Imani turned twenty-one, a milestone I both cherished and dreaded. Another year older, another year further from needing her old man, the aging hip-hop artist with a past that clung to him like the Chicago humidity in August. Forty-three years old, and half of them spent chasing a high, the white lines morphing into a gaping chasm in my life.

The music had given us a good life, a decent brick house in a quiet South Side neighborhood. Enough royalties trickled in to keep the bills paid and Imani in good schools. But the price… the price was etched into the ravaged landscape of my nasal cavity, a constant reminder of the powder that had once fueled my creativity and then, insidiously, consumed it. Ten years ago, the snorting became unbearable, the pain a sharp counterpoint to the fleeting euphoria. So, I’d made the brilliant decision to switch. Crack. The rock became my constant companion, a twisted muse that offered oblivion instead of inspiration.

This morning, the comedown was particularly brutal. My chest felt tight, a heavy band squeezing the air from my lungs. Panic flickered, sharp and unwelcome. “Just need some air,” I mumbled, pushing myself off the worn couch.

Stepping into the backyard, the familiar cityscape felt muted, the usual cacophony of city life strangely subdued. The sky, a pale grey canvas, seemed to mirror the unease in my chest. Then, it happened. A voice, smoother than a Stevie Wonder riff, calmer than Lake Michigan on a windless day, echoed from above.

“Marcus.”

My head snapped up, searching. There was nothing there, just the indifferent sky.

“Marcus,” the voice repeated, and this time, it resonated deep within me. “Today is the day.”

Then, he was there. Standing by the overgrown lilac bush, a man who looked exactly like Morgan Freeman. The same kind eyes, the same gentle smile, the same aura of quiet wisdom. And when he spoke, it was Morgan Freeman’s voice, a low, comforting rumble.

“Don’t be afraid, Marcus.”

My breath hitched. “Am I… am I talking to Morgan Freeman?”

He chuckled softly. “You can call me Death. I appear in a form that will not cause undue alarm. My true visage… well, let’s just say it wouldn’t be conducive to a peaceful transition. It tends to… linger in the memory.”

Death. Morgan Freeman. Standing in my Chicago backyard. The absurdity of it almost made me laugh, but the cold dread gripping my heart was too real.

“You have been a good father, Marcus,” he continued, his gaze unwavering. “For that, you are granted a peaceful departure. Your time is in two hours. There are a few things you must do.”

He outlined the instructions with a gentle authority. Shower. Sit with Imani. Tell her I loved her. Talk. At four o’clock, lie down for a nap in my bedroom. A profound weariness would claim me, and I would simply drift off. Four thirty-two. That was it. He assured me Imani would be alright, that her life would be full, even without me.

Numbly, I went inside. The shower felt like a baptism, washing away the grime of the night, but not the fear that clung to my skin. Imani was in the kitchen, humming softly as she rinsed her coffee cup.

Sitting at the table, the words felt thick in my throat. “Hey, baby.”

She smiled, that bright, open smile that always melted a piece of the ice around my heart. “Morning, Dad. You okay? You look a little… off.”

“Yeah, just tired,” I lied, my voice raspy. I reached across the table, taking her hand. Her skin was soft, so full of life. “I just wanted to tell you… I love you, Imani. More than anything.”

Her brow furrowed. “I love you too, Dad. You sound so serious.”

We talked. About her plans, her dreams, silly memories from when she was little. Every word felt precious, weighted with the knowledge of what was coming. I hugged her tight, the scent of her shampoo a familiar comfort.

Four o’clock arrived with a chilling punctuality. A bone-deep fatigue washed over me, just as Death had described. Imani looked at me with concern. “You really don’t look good, Dad. Maybe you should lie down.”

And that’s when the fear hit me, a tidal wave of pure, unadulterated terror. Never seeing her again. Never hearing her laugh. Never being there for her milestones. The thought was unbearable, a gaping void where my heart used to be.

Instead of heading to my room, I stumbled back outside, into the fading afternoon light. My voice cracked as I cried out, a desperate plea hurled into the uncaring sky. “Please! Anyone! God, Satan, whoever is listening! Just one more day! Just one more day with my daughter! I’ll give you anything! My soul! Everything I have! Just let me live one more day!”

The silence that followed was deafening. The clock ticked on, each second an agonizing reminder. Four thirty-two came and went. I was still breathing. Relief washed over me, so potent it almost buckled my knees. I had cheated death. I had won. Tears streamed down my face, a mixture of terror and elation. “I’ll change,” I vowed to the empty sky. “I’ll quit. For her. I’ll be the father she deserves.”

Two days later, the phone rang. A shrill, insistent sound that sliced through the fragile peace I had started to build. It was the police. There had been an accident. A drunk driver. Imani… Imani was gone.

The world tilted, the vibrant colors draining away, leaving only a stark, desolate grey. The calm voice from the sky, the gentle smile of the man who looked like Morgan Freeman, the promise of a peaceful death… it all echoed in my mind with a cruel, mocking irony. I had begged for one more day. I had been granted it. But it wasn't for me. It was for her last day. And I hadn't even known.",1,1744605606.0,Creepystories,0,1.0,False

Alright. Fine. **Two can play at that.**

Sam wanted to mess with my reality? I decided to make her question her own **existence.**

# Step 1: Creating the Illusion

Sam and I **are identical twins.** Which means, technically speaking… **I could replace her.**

So I did.

I recruited **our cousin Lily,** who looks just enough like us to pull this off. Lily and I spent a **full week** studying **Sam’s voice, her mannerisms, her outfits, everything.**

Then, we executed **Phase 1.**

# Step 2: The Clone Swap

One morning, before Sam woke up, I **vanished.**

**I left the house. No phone. No trace.**

Then, Lily stepped in, wearing **my clothes,** talking exactly like me.

And when Sam groggily walked into the kitchen for coffee, she saw Lily and went, **“Morning, Sam.”**

And Lily, pretending to be me, responded, **“Morning, Sam.”**

And then Sam froze.

Because that’s **not how our mornings go.**

She blinked. “Wait. No. I’M Sam.”

Lily stared at her. **Confused. Concerned.**

“…What are you talking about? **I’m Sam.**”

# Step 3: The Mind Fracture

For the **next four hours,** Lily and I gaslit Sam into believing she was **not the real Sam.**

* Lily used **all my usual phrases.**
* My parents played along, **calling Lily ‘Sam’** and looking at actual Sam like she was crazy.
* We swapped all the **photo frames** in the house to have Lily in my place.
* Sam checked her phone, and **her lock screen had been replaced with a picture of Lily.**

The moment she saw that?

She **SCREAMED.**

# Step 4: The Breaking Point

She ran into her room, **frantically searching for proof she was real.** But everything had been altered.

She looked at **our baby photos.** In every single one, **Lily’s face had been photoshopped over hers.**

She **fully lost it.** “WHO AM I?!”

That’s when I walked back into the house—**casually sipping a smoothie.**

She turned. **Horrified.** Staring at both me and Lily.

“…Wait.” She pointed at Lily. “If you’re Sam…” She turned to me. “Then who the hell is THAT?!”

And that’s when **Lily and I** spoke in **perfect unison:**

**“What do you mean? There’s only one Sam.”**

**SHE COLLAPSED.**

I have never seen a human being crumble faster.

# Step 5: The Reveal

After **ten straight minutes of her pacing in a panic,** I finally broke character.

I walked over, put a hand on her shoulder, and whispered, **“You just got cloned.”**

She PUNCHED ME.

# Final Score: Samantha – 4, Sam – 3

I have the upper hand. And **she knows it.**",1,1744605046.0,StoriesMadeByAI,0,1.0,False

Hey, MaximizeMe fam! ✨ So, let’s talk about mornings. You know that feeling when you wake up and immediately feel like you’re winning at life? Yeah, me neither. 😅 But here’s the kicker: I’ve discovered that a solid morning ritual can totally flip the script.

**Here’s what works for me, and I’m curious if you’ve got your own secret sauce!**

1. **Wake Up Early (ish)** 🕖  
   Okay, I’m not talking crack-of-dawn nonsense. I’m more of a “wakes up slightly before my brain is fully operational” person. But getting up even 30 minutes earlier gives me that *extra time* to breathe and not feel like I’m playing catch-up.

2. **Hydrate Like a Champion** 💦  
   First thing I do? Chug a glass of water. Seriously, it’s like giving a glass of sunshine to your insides. Plus, it wakes me up more than the coffee *eventually* will.

3. **Get Moving** 💃  
   Whether it’s a quick yoga flow, a brisk walk, or busting a move to my favorite jam, getting my body moving is key. It’s like saying “hey, body! We’re awake!” and it wakes up my mind, too. Plus, who doesn't love a morning dance party, right? 🎶

4. **Gratitude Check-In** 🙏  
   A little gratitude goes a long way. I take a quick moment to think about 3 things I’m thankful for. It shifts my mindset to positive vibes, and I’m ready to tackle anything!

5. **Plan the Day** 📝  
   I’ve started jotting down my top three priorities for the day. It’s like creating a treasure map! With my eyes on the prize, I find I’m way less likely to wander off into the land of distractions (looking at you, social media). 

6. **Mindfulness Moment** 🧘‍♂️  
   A few minutes of meditation feels like hitting the *reset* button. Just sitting quietly and letting thoughts fly by. It’s not about emptying your mind but more about focusing on what really matters. Trust me, it makes a big difference!

Okay, now it’s your turn! Do you have a morning ritual that sets you up for success? Maybe you’ve got a crazy habit that sounds wild but works wonders. 

Let’s share our best tricks! Remember, we’re here to inspire each other and level up our mornings (and our lives)! Who's ready to optimize their morning game? 💪✨",1,1744605033.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

TMI but it was liquid d* immediately I felt some relief from cramping/nausea but I have gone back a couple times. Now I've been in bed for about 15min with no urge. Reallyyyyy hoping I don't get more nauseous or need tu and I just need reassurance bc I always make myself think that tu comes after d* (side note, I made SURE the burger had no pink) PLS HELP idk what caused it and I'm lowkey freaking out",1,1744604861.0,emetophobia,1,1.0,False

(m, 18) I have an active lifestyle and I’m successfully recovering from an ED, thanks to my girlfriend. I’ve stopped counting calories and follow a 3 meals, 3 snacks plan. I eat a lot of veggies, grains, meats, and fruits, and honestly, I don’t like junk food that much (probably one candy bar, ice cream, or donut with my coffee per day), so I think I’m doing really well in my recovery.

But recently, I’ve noticed that I have lower energy levels, and I think it’s because I’m not getting enough carbs to perform. The thing is, I’m just not that hungry. So... do I need to eat an extra meal or drink some kind of shake to have more energy, or would that hurt my ED recovery?

Also, is it generally a good idea not to count calories while having an active lifestyle?

I’m 166 cm (5'5"") and 61 kg (134 lbs)—a lot of that is muscle and bone weight, and I’m around 14-15% body fat. So, being a cute little hobbit, I don’t eat as much as other guys and don’t get hungry that often and i kinda force myself to eat some meals.

Don’t post but need some help. I have recently gotten my motorcycle endorsement and been trying to practice on my bike. I did just fine in the BRT course, even took an extended class, but for some reason when on the road i just get so so nervous that all training goes out the window. I ride fine with coaching, but I’m anxious on the street and can barely even practice alone on a Sunday morning.

I’m looking for a chill rider buddy who is patient and okay with taking things slow. I am in SE Portland, my bike is a 2022 Kymco Kpipe 125cc. Serious/ friendly only please.

I don’t have friends who ride and just need someone more experienced who can hang out,  mentor or discuss motorcycling tips with me. Will buy you a coffee or something please help !! Feel free to PM, I will ask for ur Insta.",5,1744604427.0,askportland,4,1.0,False
1jyqcc2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jyqcc2,6 months po/88 pounds down,"Last post deleted**

From 275 I was 188 this morning!
Very little loose skin, mainly on arms and stomach and inner thighs!
I’ve been using a lot of vitamins, oils, and treatments for those areas.
I can eat more but I still choose to stop when I’m “satisfied” and not “full and in pain” but it does still happen sometimes.
I’m lacking on water intake like I always have.
But try my best to get liquids in with coffee, zero sugar drinks, etc.
I live off protein shakes still. If I’m ever out because those things are expensive, I get my protein in with eggs, fish, Greek yogurt, etc.
My favorite late night snack ever is quest protein chips or pickles and cheese! Yes, I’m a midnight snacker!
I weigh myself everyday just because I’m used to it. Sometimes it doesn’t move and sometimes I go back up a pound or two. But I trust the process because I have come a long way.
In shirts I went from an xxl/xxxl to a l/xl depending on brands
In pants from a size 20 to a 10 again depending on brand
Bra from 40DD to a 36/38DD.
Shoes from size 10 to a 9. 🙊
I had super long hair by 6 months post op reaching to my bum. But it was just shedding like crazy and so damaged and even tried expensive growth shampoo and eventually cut it all off.",34,1744604381.0,gastricsleeve,5,0.96,False

 But I'm broke, 
 So I've got a thermos, 
 And a blanket for the park, 
 But I forgot about the weather, 
 I'm really not all that smart, 
 We can walk around the used book store, 
 I hope you don't think I'm a bore, 
 This town used to be so much more, 
 So many places you had barley been before, 
 I want to make you coffee, 
 I want to take your hand in mine, 
 I miss you so dearly, 
 And I see so clearly you were never mine oh mine, 
 But let me make you coffee, 
 Take it for the road, 
 You can even keep my mug, 
 But you can't stay in my mind, 
 I really should be going myself, 
 Gotta leave myself behind, 
 I wish I could remember you, 
 But I set fire to our ties, 
Told myself some lies, 
 But I'm still always looking for you, 
 In everybody I see, 
 Everybody I meet, 
 I secretly hope they're you, 
 But I've got a coffee date, 
 And maybe I'll be free from you
