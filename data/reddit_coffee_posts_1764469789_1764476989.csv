I was always the “I’ll believe it when I see it” kind of guy. Same with religion. I didn’t hate it; I just never saw a reason to think any of it was real.

That changed last night.

I live in the West End district of Shadow Falls, and I usually go jogging around midnight. It’s quiet, the streets are empty, and it’s the one time of day I feel like I can think. Last night it was raining, but only lightly at first. I almost stayed home, but I convinced myself a little rain wasn’t a big deal.

So, I put on my raincoat, tied my shoes, and headed out.

About fifteen minutes into my jog, the rain got worse. Much worse. It went from annoying to overwhelming in a matter of seconds. The thunder started up, too ... it was loud enough to make me jump once or twice. I kept going anyway, but by the time I hit Ninth Street, the rain was so heavy I could barely see what was in front of me.

There’s a small diner a few blocks from my place, and I figured I’d duck in there until the storm calmed down. I was already soaked, and the idea of standing under a roof sounded good enough. The only problem was crossing the street to get there.

I tried to look both ways, but with how hard it was pouring, I couldn’t see any headlights. It was after midnight, and the roads are usually dead around that time, so I figured the chance of a car coming was pretty low.

I stepped into the street.

That’s when a van came out of nowhere, speeding straight toward me. I didn’t even have time to react. I remember the sound of the engine, the shape of the headlights, and the sudden realization that this was probably it for me.

But then something impossible happened.

I felt this sharp jolt, like a burst of electricity going through my whole body and suddenly the world around me shifted. I blinked once, maybe twice, and the next thing I knew I was standing safely on the sidewalk in front of the diner.

No pain, no impact, no explanation.

I turned back toward the street, confused and shaking, and that’s when I saw it. A figure standing where I had been only seconds earlier. It looked like a person, but its whole body was made of some kind of glowing energy. Bright, flickering, almost like it was made of electricity instead of skin and bone.

It didn’t move. It just watched me.

And then, just as fast as it appeared, it disappeared.

I went inside the diner and sat down. I ordered a coffee but didn’t drink it. I just sat there trying to understand what had happened. I must’ve stared at the wall for an hour.

I don’t know what that thing was.  
I don’t know how it saved me.

But after last night, I can say this much with confidence that there are things in this world I clearly don’t understand.",1,1764476660.0,u_strangeshadowstories,0,1.0,False
1pa927o,https://www.reddit.com/r/finedining/comments/1pa927o/two_weeks_in_japan_nov_2025_food_wine_bars_food/,"Two Weeks in Japan (Nov 2025): Food, Wine Bars & Food Tours (Shellfish allergy friendly)","My partner has a shellfish allergy, which required extensive research. Only a few restaurants declined the reservation requests after reading the allergy details. But to be fair, if they explicitily called out that they couldn’t accomodate, I did not send a request. Hope my post helps others narrow down their options.

Yakitori

Torisaki (Kyoto) ✅
I snagged a cancellation a few days before arriving in Kyoto through Instagram and was able to fit it in because I had mixed up the dates of another reservation (it worked out perfectly). We were the only foreigners, and they were incredibly kind and welcoming. Every skewer was excellent, but the shoulder, neck, and gizzard were my personal favorites. This is definitely a place I will return to.

Ichimatsu (Osaka)❌
The worst meal of the trip. I was really looking forward to this after seeing it praised on this subreddit, but from the very first skewer it was clear the quality of the chicken did not compare to Torisaki, and it only declined from there. Many courses felt completely out of place for a yakitori restaurant, including ricotta, grated onion with bread, chocolate, and coffee. It felt more focused on filling you up and putting on a show for tourists than on highlighting the chicken itself. Everyone dining was a foreigner, and the chef mainly talked about wanting to open a location in NYC or LA.

———

Kaiseki

Higashiyama Tsukasa (Kyoto) ✅
My favorite kaiseki meal of the trip. This was the most fun experience, as it was a very creative interpretation of kaiseki. The chef explained every dish in English, and along with the younger team, created a warm and enjoyable atmosphere. Despite the relaxed environment, every detail from the ceramics to the presentation to the service was flawless. We were very impressed. There was only one seating, and we were the only foreigners. The wine and sake list was also excellent. I will definitely return in a different season.

Miyawaki (Kyoto)✅
We did Tsukasa and Miyawaki back to back. This was a more traditional kaiseki experience, and every course was delicious. The best piece of wagyu beef I had during the trip was here, sourced from the chef’s hometown in Kagawa where the cows diet include olives. And same for the Uni, I never got the hype until I tasted theirs, incredible! Unlike Tsukasa, the two seatings overlapped for about an hour, which made the service feel somewhat disorganized until the first group left. Most dish descriptions were presented on an iPad, but the chef and his wife were still very engaging. Every course was very very tasty!

Myoujyaku (Tokyo)✅
We secured a last-minute reservation in their private room. I had read about their exclusive use of seawater, but tasting it firsthand was incredible. The subtlety and tenderness of every ingredient really stood out. I loved having a printed menu to follow along and read in detail about the ingredients and the story behind each course. I think the experience would be even better at the counter, as service occasionally felt awkward in the private room.

Miyoshi (Kyoto)❌
Booked through TableAll and ended up being the most expensive meal of the trip. It was good, but not worth the price. I would not return.

Sushi

We visited Sushi Sho a week before this trip, and after that experience, the two sushiya we tried in Tokyo felt slightly below by comparison. Sho earned three Michelin stars while we were in Japan, and couldn’t be more deserving.

Mizukami (Tokyo)🟨
Frequently mentioned on this subreddit and one of the few sushiya willing to accommodate a shellfish allergy, which I truly appreciated. Mizukami-san served the single local diner along with a large group from Brazil, while the remaining four guests, including us, were served by his right-hand, Nesaki-san. I prefer a more acidic shari, and this was very well balanced. They provide an English menu and point to each item as it is served. This is minor nitpicking, but our chef’s nails were dirty, and his movements lacked some of the delicacy I look for when forming nigiri. That said, it was still a very good meal. I would consider returning for lunch.

Sushiya Hajime (Tokyo)🟨
We did Mizukami and Hajime back to back for easier comparison. The shari here was less acidic and used more wasabi, which at times overshadowed both the fish and the rice. Watching the chef prepare each course was a joy. There was very little English spoken, but they used an iPad to show the fish, sometimes with helpful names and other times with very literal translations. There was only one seating, with just us two foreigners and two local salarymen. The room was silent until the two men arrived and began talking to the chef, which I appreciated.

———

New Japanese

L’Effervescence (Tokyo)✅
I managed to snag a lunch reservation and was initially nervous, as Michelin stars in Japan can be hit or miss. This one delivered. While every course was good, what really stood out was the hospitality and service. Some tableside elements made the experience engaging rather than just a sequence of dishes. It felt like a thoughtful expression of modern Japanese cuisine with French influence. Despite its three stars, the atmosphere was relaxed rather than stuffy. I will definitely return and highly recommend it.

Ukiyo (Tokyo)✅
A favorite on this subreddit, and it absolutely lived up to expectations. Beautiful presentation, strong execution, and well-balanced flavors. This was the only place where I genuinely enjoyed shirako. The service team was a bit reserved at first, but once we asked for wine recommendations, they warmed up and became much more conversational. There were two stacked seatings at 7:00 and 7:30, and everyone dining was a foreigner. I will definitely return on a future trip and would love to compare it with Cocon.

Creative Dining Takayama (Kyoto)✅
They were very accommodating when I mixed up my reservation date and moved us from dinner to lunch. Everything was delicious, well executed, and beautifully presented, except for the fish course, which fell a bit short. The team was friendly and engaging, which was especially appreciated since there were only two parties dining, us and a father and daughter from Taiwan. This ended up being my partner’s favorite meal after Torisaki.

Hakunei (Tokyo)❌
Our first French-Japanese restaurant of the trip. From the moment you enter the book-lined lounge, it is clear the experience leans more French than Japanese. Unfortunately, most courses were misses rather than hits. My favorites were the mille-feuille and the barracuda rice, which came with onigiri to go. The ambiance felt somewhat uptight, and the service team was difficult to connect with. Only one seating, with just four of ten seats filled, all by foreigners.

⸻

Pizza

I enjoy trying good pizza wherever I travel, and Tokyo was no exception.

400 Degrees (Tokyo)✅
Despite the crust looking large and doughy, it was surprisingly light and enjoyable. I preferred this over Da Michele in Naples, as the crust held up better. Reservations sell out quickly once released. There are around 14 to 16 seats, and during our seating, we were the only foreigners.

Marumo (Tokyo)❌
We visited this before 400 Degrees and found it solid. We ordered the Japanese Umami pizza and enjoyed how the flavors came together. Plenty of seating and mostly foreign diners.

⸻

Others

Tonkatsu Fujii (Osaka)✅
Absolutely incredible and probably my favorite meal of the entire trip. I never thought tonkatsu could be anything more than deep-fried pork. We ordered the set menu based on their recommendation, as the menu was in Japanese. Every cut of pork was cooked perfectly, and the breading was almost imperceptible. All sauces and even the salt are house-made, including the best mustard I’ve ever had. I loved this place and cannot wait to return. Highly recommended if you’re in Osaka.

Yoroniku (Tokyo)❌
The chateaubriand sando initially caught my attention, but once a roll topped with caviar and gold flakes arrived, I knew this place was not for me. The meat itself was excellent, but at this price point I would rather have more high-quality beef and fewer luxury add-ons. Service quality varied by server, and other tables with foreigners seemed to receive more attentive explanations. I would not recommend it.

⸻

Food Tours

5am Ramen Tour (Tokyo)✅
Because of my shellfish allergy, we did this tour to avoid any miscommunication about broth and ingredients. It was an excellent experience with some great ramen spots in Ueno, and I highly recommend it. We would have done the Kyoto tour as well, but it didn’t fit our schedule.

Culinary Backstreets (Tokyo and Osaka)✅
This is my go-to food tour company worldwide. In Japan, they operate in Tokyo and Osaka. The Tokyo tour is set in the picturesque Kichijoji neighborhood, while the Osaka tour focuses on street food and market exploration. Reading reviews helps identify standout guides, and having a great guide truly elevates the experience. I enjoyed the Osaka tour more than the Tokyo one.

⸻

Wine Bars

Tokyo
The largest selection of Jura wines outside of Jura is at Gout de Jaune, a tiny bar near Akasaka. There are no walk-ins, but reservations can be made through Instagram DM (@shohei_miumiu1109). This is not a place to casually have a single glass, but rather to enjoy a bottle or two with food. Best suited for a relaxed, wine-focused evening.

Kyoto
Brun Wine Bar opened about three months ago and was a standout. Reservations can be made through Instagram DM (@brun_kyoto) and are currently easy to secure. A strong bottle selection paired with an extensive by-the-glass list. The owner was very friendly, and we enjoyed talking wine despite his limited English. The food and snacks were excellent. This was my favorite wine bar of the trip.

Osaka
Lupin is a fairly new “western food” wine bar or more like a tapas restaurant. Ran by husband and wife - he used to be at a spanish bbq restaurant in Kobe and she was the somm at a Michelin restaurant. We were in great hands so we ordered a charcuterie plate where all the cuts were made in house along a steak burger pattie. Wine pairings were excellent. Perfect for a night where you want a break from traditional japanese food. Reservations can be made through instagram DM (@lupin.episode0). Food menu is only in Japanese.

⸻

Breakfast and Coffee

Sharing my favorite breakfast and coffee spots. I am by no means a coffee connoisseur, so this is based purely on my taste for pour-overs and black americanos.

Onibus (Tokyo)
Good coffee, pastries only.

Trichromatic Coffee (Tokyo)
Great coffee with an excellent egg toast and outstanding banana and carrot cake. I visited twice and it was my favorite breakfast stop.

Tokyo Little House (Tokyo)
The best americano of the trip, paired with a very good cheese toast and cheesecake. Located near our hotel, so we visited multiple times. The hosts were extremely welcoming.

Roar Coffee (Tokyo)
Good coffee and the best banana cake I had on the trip. Ask for it warmed. Any location should be solid, as they have several across Tokyo.

Style Coffee (Kyoto)
The best pour-over I had during the trip. A tiny shop near the botanical garden, with a lovely walk there through independent shops.

Goodman Roaster (Kyoto)
Very good coffee and excellent banana cake. Plenty of seating for a slow morning. Cash only.

Weekenders Coffee (Kyoto)
Probably the most popular coffee shop in Kyoto, and the coffee lived up to the reputation. I had a single-origin pour-over that ranked just behind Style Coffee. Limited seating, with some outdoor options or coffee to go.

Glitch (Osaka)
I wanted to see what the hype was about, and the line here was shorter than in Tokyo. Good coffee and a fun atmosphere with vinyl records playing.

Lilo Coffee Roasters (Osaka)
A very small space with limited room to stand inside. The coffee was good, but I generally prefer a spot where I can sit or settle in while drinking.",2,1764476606.0,finedining,0,1.0,False
1pa91ur,https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalintelligence/comments/1pa91ur/when_is_it_appropriate_to_start_dating_after_a/,When is it appropriate to start dating after a breakup?,"Tl;dr…. Just the title. 

I’m 42F. I became a widow 6.5 years ago. In that time, I spent 2 yrs with a guy that I thought I loved, but it ended up a codependency situation where my life revolved around trying to “fix” him cuz he had DID. By the end, I just had no more love to give, so had to let him go. We remain friends. I had already known him a decade prior to the relationship. 

Then, I reconnected with a guy I had gone on a couple dates with back in 2009. We were together 16 months or so. I don’t think I ever was in love with him— I wanted to be I think cuz he had wanted to date me for a decade and maybe I thought it endearing (?) so just wanted to really love him. The moment I realized I wasn’t in love was when I dreaded having to kiss him goodbye the last weekend he left my house… it just seemed like kissing a friend. This life is too short for a lack of passion I think. 

Then, I decided to spend the next 18 months single— made friends, went out and had fun with them doing new hobbies, healed, therapy, etc. In all of my single time since my husband died, I’d prob gone on first sometimes second dates with 30 different men… I just never “felt” what I was looking for. 

Sixteen years ago, before I met my husband, there was a guy I dated for 4-6 months. I never forgot the passion we felt when our eyes and lips met. There was just magic about it. He felt it too, but he wanted different logistics so found someone else and married her. I was heartbroken. In all those guys that I met up with over the past 6 years, I found myself looking for what I felt when I was with that guy— I never could find it so…. I decided to message him out of the blue one day, 15 yrs after we had last seen each other. He happened to be just separated. Not the best timing to start dating and we were unsure if we would even feel the same. When we met up, we locked eyes and both of us still felt what we had all those years ago. I was over the moon— he was too, or at least I think so. Within the past 15 months, he has broken up with me 3x. The first 2x, I was devastated… crying, etc. begging him to try again. I was so scared to lose him and that passion again, I wouldn’t accept that he just wasn’t emotionally ready for a relationship, let alone one with someone who is ready to settle down and be a partner to someone. So this time, I finally realized, even though I did not want to let him go again…. He just isn’t ready. Having to reinvent your life after a long marriage has ended is heavy. I love him so much. Idk if he loves me anymore… he said it and acted like it up until the week he pulled the plug, but there was so much emotional unrest with us cuz I wanted more quality time with him and he needed solitude and healing. I need someone who can be with me a few days a week after a year together, he needs someone that can meet up occasionally and give him his space to grow alone…. Or, actually I guess he needs no one at all maybe. Either way… what we need at this point in our lives is vastly different. 

Anyway, last time we broke up… though I was devastated, I had a coffee date with someone a couple days later. He and I were still talking cuz it’s a hard habit to not talk with someone who has been your bff for months and that you love more than anyone. Especially when the break up seemed abrupt. He was very hurt that I started dating so soon cuz it made him feel like maybe I never cared for him at all, which was not the case. I only wanted him. But, for my own emotional health, I could not just sit at home crying or it would lead to depression probably— I need to be functional. So I just jumped back up on the horse though I hated to. I also did it so soon so that I would stop bugging him and just let go already. I went on a couple more first dates and I just felt nothing. I want to feel for these people what I feel for him— that is what I need and am looking for in a partner to settle down with. I don’t want to spend the next 16 years looking for him in people only to never find it again. 

So if a couple days after breaking up is too soon… when is it appropriate then? 

I think my perspective is different too cuz I saw first hand how short life is… all the things I thought I was going to do in this life with my husband died with him that day he collapsed. A copacetic life as we knew it gone in an instant. We could all die at any moment, so I don’t want to waste time NOT being with someone I’m passionately in love with nor alone. My husband was my best friend and I rather liked living with my bff everyday. And, now I’ve spent 5 years of my life with 3 different people and none I could settle down with…. So it just seems like kind of a waste of time that for me is far too precious. ",3,1764476575.0,emotionalintelligence,0,1.0,False

I didn't use it very often and had a lot of things coming up, including exams. I had only started posting a few months prior and made about 6-7 posts. These were mostly modelling shots, as I thought I'd start posting some of my creative work to my page. I didn't have many followers either. It wasn't a big deal to me and was an optional new add-on to my existing career.

There’s a guy (30M) I’d only met a few times. We weren’t close, or never dated, just both played music and talked occasionally. Definitely not someone with any kind of emotional stake in my life. We had discussed practicing and writing music sometime, so I had passed on my number to him to organise this. Purely professional on my end, and I can't think of anything I did or said that could've been interpreted as anything else other than that in that moment.

We had interacted via Instagram DMs very briefly and sparingly. He only seemed to respond right after I'd make a post. And one of those times, he made a comment at the end of his message saying ""I like your new post btw, very pretty!"" to which I just said thanks and pointed out how the photographer did a great job.

As soon as I deleted my Instagram, he sent me a message.

Him: Hey, why did you delete your instagram? You all good?

Me: Hey! Yeah all good, just taking a break for a while. It's a bit distracting and I don't really need it. How are you?

Him: I totally get that, I just got a bit worried because you were doing so well in building your online portfolio... I really hope no one's been nasty to you and made you want to delete anything! 
I've been good, I've been busier than ever and I feel like so much has happened since we last spoke! (Sorry for not getting back to your last message btw!) how about you? I'd like to do an afternoon coffee next time we're both free!

Me: I just changed my mind. Even if anyone was I wouldn't care.
Yeah not bad, nothing to report on really.
I might actually leave a catch-up for now, but I may let you know later on if I'm feeling up to it

One week later, I sent this: Your messages felt inappropriate and condescending. Especially after I'd already explained why I deleted, and you already had another way to reach me if you needed to.
They also show you've been paying more attention to my appearance and profile than I’m comfortable with. Please don’t contact me again.

His messages really rubbed me the wrong way and it seemed like he thought he was entitled to an explanation as to why I deleted my account, then didn't accept my reasoning and completely invented a story about my emotional state and reactivity. It felt like he was speaking down to me like I was a fragile young girl who can't make decisions for myself. I found it pretty invasive and boundary-crossing.

A friend of mine doesn't see it how I do and agrees that while he was a bit eager, I was probably too harsh and he didn't mean it how I perceived it.

It's Black Friday weekend. I go about my day. I get my brew coffee from the little cafe. I buy fruit from the farmers stands. As I walk past the stores, I see the shops advertising their goods.  

""50% off! 75! 90!""

It's all a scam. Lies! Propaganda for the money machine. The savings are pennies at best. The workers are tired and overwhelmed. The consumers are stressed and desperate. And the only people happy are the rich fat cats sitting at the top of the totem pole. 

Why does Christmas have to be so complicated? 

I think about what you told me about Jesus, how He came into the world. Trading His throne for a bed of hay. All-powerful to helpless. All-knowing to a blank slate. The lowest of lows.

A baby has no need for money, has no concept of it.

But when Mary held and kissed Him, He cooed happily. 

When Joseph watched over Him, He slept peacefully. 

When the little drummer boy played, He smiled. 

That's what really makes a baby happy. 

It's about family. Faith. Love.

You're so clever. You're always teaching me new things, even apart.

I hope all the seasons blessings reach you!

I pray that they do!

The reason is that I've found myself in a bit of a vicious cycle:

\---

1. Vyvanse works great during the day, but then it leads to poor sleep (middle insomnia).
2. My usual Ambien stops helping treating the insomnia, so I'm next prescribed Trazadone to help, but then Trazadone stops helping.
3. I start drinking more coffee in order to function. (If I don't, I can end up having a big 'crash' when Vyvanse wears off).
4. Start developing more severe anxiety attacks in the week after both starting the Trazadone and drinking more coffee.

\---

I decided to take the 'holiday' one morning when I woke up with an anxiety attack, with heart pounding, after taking Trazadone the night before.

It seems clear trying to treat the middle insomnia with more medication isn't working, so I now want to just isolate what's going on. I'm now cutting out not just the drugs, but any caffeine or alcohol as well (not that I drink either in unusual amounts).

I'm on end of day two, and can say my sleep is slowly improving. I was pushing my body pretty hard due to a demanding schedule, but right now I have a little breathing room where I can afford to rest and sleep, and see what happens.

I'm fairly new to Vyvanse so I can easily just go back to not taking it, but I've found it immensely helpful, so I hope I can talk with my doctor and figure out a solution. It really has been a life changing (positive) experience, aside from the insomnia.

I am also investigating to see if the middle insomnia is being caused by other life stressors, but at least so far it definitely feels harder to stay asleep when taking Vyvanse. Sometimes when I wake up at night and get drowsy, it almost feels like my body is waking itself back up, which is unusual for me.

1pa8sda,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pa8sda,How to handle the placement of all my books? What kind of bookshelf?,"Hi all!

I recently moved into a new place and it's been fun playing irl animal crossing! I need some interior decorating advice.

Some of my non-negotiables wrt the way I go about my life are:
- a couch + TV + small coffee table for video games and movies (yes I was influenced to get a dupe of the modular sofa but I absolutely love it!)
- a dedicated work desk
- my piano
- a small island dining table for meals and morning tea (coming soon: the boxes demonstrate the size and height of the incoming table)
- a place for my books

Then in my room I'll have my bed and art desk and clothes and stuff.

I'm unsure what kind of bookshelf to get to handle my multiple bags of books. It would have been nice to do one long one across but the AC unit thwarted my plans and juts out of the wall awkwardly here. How would you decorate it? 

Bonus: what colour curtains would you get, and what would you paint the walls? And other fun advice if you have two cents.

SMH - Moms. 

So let's get into it:

So I had a baby 3 months ago, and while he’s adorable, fragile, and learning what hands are… my mom has apparently decided that *I* am the real infant in this household. Every time she visits, she acts like she’s the CEO of Parenting and I’m her unpaid intern who keeps messing up the coffee order.

  
The issue?  
She despises the way I talk to my baby. 

Not dislikes.  
Not mildly questions.  
**DESPISES.**  
Like I’m chanting demonic Latin at him instead of saying normal mom things.

Here are some highlights:

**Me:**  
“It’s okay, baby, you’re just tired.”

**My mom, instantly:**  
“No he’s not! Stop diagnosing him!”

Diagnosing?? He’s not a patient. He’s a sleepy potato.

Another one:

**Me:**  
“Look at my handsome boy.”

**My mom:**  
“He doesn’t understand compliments, Alexandra.”

Okay?? And he also doesn’t understand you sitting here arguing with *me*, but that isn’t stopping either of us.

Then the best one:

**Me (changing him):**  
“Alright, time for a fresh booty.”

**My mom:**  
“Say diaper. Babies don’t have booties.”

??? umm... MA'AM..  
So what exactly am I wiping?  
A concept?  
A theoretical lower half?

She corrects EVERYTHING.  
If I use a baby voice, she says I’m “encouraging weakness.”  
If I don’t use a baby voice, she says I’m “emotionally distant.”

At one point she corrected the way I sighed.  
THE WAY I SIGHED.  
Like I’m supposed to exhale with better form.

The other day she told me, “Talk to him normally. He’s a human, not a golden retriever.”

This came from the same woman who used to tell our childhood dog “Mommy wuvs her widdle baby snuggle bear.” So okay, Janet.

After she corrected me for the **fifth** time in ten minutes, I finally said, “Mom, I love you, but you’ve got to chill. I’m bonding with my child, not performing a TED Talk.”

She got insulted, acted like I slapped her, and said, “Wow. THIS generation,” and left like she was storming out of a soap opera scene.

So now it’s just me and my baby staring at each other like:

*“Did that lady just argue with me about your booty?”*

**[Speaker 7 : Questioner to Eckhart Tolle ] (5:12:08 - 5:12:56)**  
You, for this morning's talk—my mother died Friday, died on Friday. I just thought it was so appropriate, and the peace of mind that gave me with what you said this morning was fantastic.

But that wasn't my question. The question I had was really related to, with all the talks you give, the retreats and advice, have you ever looked back and thought afterwards, ""Man, I wish I wouldn't have said that,"" or, ""Boy, goofed up there,""—this was a mistake?

Thank you. Thank you. Well, only the...

**[Speaker 1 : Eckhart Tolle ] (5:12:56 - 5:17:45)**  
Pope is infallible. Now, that the teaching—if we can even call it the teaching, of course—is not mainly based on information. Not primarily based on any kind of conveying of information or facts, but on its most fundamental level, the teaching is awareness, which is non-conceptual. So that can't be wrong.

So on the most fundamental level, nothing could possibly be wrong, because it transcends all concepts. That's the essence of the teaching. The moment you move into concepts, the possibility of error, of course, arises.

But first of all, the first level of concepts that are used are concepts that point back to that which is beyond concepts and beyond thought. So the concepts that I use in the teachings are concepts whose purpose is to point back to that which is beyond.

So they can't be much wrong about that, except that it could be that I used a pointer that perhaps was not the most appropriate one for a certain person or group of people. That could happen. But used again, ""errors"" doesn't really apply here; it just might not be the best possible point. I maybe wake up in the middle of the night to say, ""Oh, I could have said that."" That's maybe possible, but usually it doesn't arise.

Next level up, occasionally I let information slip in to illustrate certain things. I might talk about something historical, or might talk about some fact about something I read in the paper, or whatever—just as little illustrative stories.

And of course, that's where things occasionally get wrong. Even in _The Power of Now_, I wrote, for example, that 100 million people had been killed in the 20th century alone by other humans, and I later realized that the figure was much too low. Apparently, it's quite a bit higher—it could be 140 million. Nobody knows exactly. It's dreadfully high. And so I got that wrong.

Sometimes in talks, something may come in—a historical fact or something—and later somebody tells me, ""You got that wrong."" In one talk, I talked about depressed anti-deport—taking depressants, antidepressants—and I wasn't perhaps careful enough to emphasize that you should do this extremely slowly, with the help of a conscious physician and so on. There was one or two physicians in the audience who got upset, and this is all wrong, it's all wrong.

That's usually what happens. The answer to a question, or even the general talk, always—there's a correspondence between the questioner and the answer. Or when there's a talk, there's a correspondence between the energy field in the room and what comes out.

That's not decision-based. There's nothing in my mind that says, ""Oh, in this energy field, I'd better talk about that,"" because I don't know before the words come out what's going to come out. So that doesn't apply.

It can happen, though, that a person asks a question and an answer comes, and I later realize that the answer was not the deepest answer that I could have given. But I do know that the answer that comes out reflects the degree of openness in the questioner, usually.

And so if the answer is not that deep, then the question wasn't that deep. That seems to be often the case. Occasionally, some deep answer comes even when the question is not deep, but perhaps there's an intuitive realization. Then it is possible to break through the surface layer.

Questioner to Eckhart Tolle: 

I take half of the smallest dose of Fluoxetine (Fluoxetine, sold under the brand name Prozac
) , an antidepressant medication. I have done without because I
have a belief it will keep me from awakening. However, I have greater clarity and seem
to hold presence more consistently when I continue with this small amount.

Eckhart Tolle answers: 

A related question asks, do you think the huge increased consumption of
antidepressants in recent years points to the ego's effort to suppress emerging
consciousness? Of course, antidepressants are there because the pain gets too much,
the pain of living, somehow an escape from the pain, dull the pain in some way. And
eventually you have to face the pain and then realize that it's not as big as it seemed.

You've been running away from a monster. And if you really look at the monster, it's not
such a big monster anymore. Facing it through presence, allowing that pain, whatever
you want to call it, existential pain, the fear associated with it, the heaviness, allowing it
to be there.

It may come in waves and then you watch the arising and subsiding of a wave of pain in
whatever form. Antidepressants make it harder to be present. If you're on this very small
dose, a time will come when you won't need that anymore and it may be very soon.

Some, it is often the pain body that manifests, as I described, the energy field of pain
body, some energy field, some pain bodies have the energy field of heaviness, great
heaviness to them. And they arise periodically. I had that.

My pain body was predominantly heavy, a weight I couldn't live with, a dull pain,
continuous in the background. I might still be on antidepressants if I had taken
antidepressants at the time. Somehow I must have allowed the pain to be there without
knowing anything about allowing.

With presence growing and accelerating in you, face the pain that arises with that
 intense presence. And acceptance. And any state that arises, accept and watch it so that
it doesn't turn into a self, an unhappy self.

If you accept and watch, any state arises is just that state now. That field, that energy
field, that particular manifestation, that particular content arises. No self in it anymore.

The perpetuation of inner states is through them becoming a self, a me. Then they go on
and on. You feed them.

You feed them. And you take time away, just what is now. So that whatever the
emotional state is, the feeling state doesn't use your mind because if it uses your mind,
you're back in time and you will be in past and future, which are both heavy.

And immediately the me arises out of that. So for that, you need the intensity of
presence. Take a picture of an Isagadatta and look at that to get the quality of intensity.

Or the picture of a Zen, a painting of a Zen master, but better a photo of a master. And
then see the uncompromising quality of presence. But it allows.

Uncompromising doesn't mean it doesn't allow. Uncompromisingly, it allows. It's
uncompromising and allowing.

And anything that's faced will undergo change. We know that from dreams. We've all
had dreams, running away from some monster or you're being pursued by some
presence, some monster.

And when you finally face it in a dream, it's not that horrible. And often this is the myth.
It becomes transformed actually into a benign figure, an ancient myth.

The famous, the dragon turns into something else or the frog turns into something, a
prince. But you have to kiss the frog. Look.

Of course, you have to reduce very slowly if you are on entity presence, then careful and
very alert and very carefully do it. Check within yourself, see if there's any waiting for
the next question or this or that. Or whether there's such intensity of aliveness
throughout your entire being that this moment is good enough as it is and more than
good enough.

Is there a flight into thought as you sit there, which means into time, which means away
from this, away from now, away from the aliveness, the intensity of this moment and the
peace of this moment. What is the role of vision in creating a new world? Does vision
arise out of presence?

Vision meaning you see something before it has manifested externally. The good thing is
that you don't have to create a new world. It creates itself through presence.
 So you don't have to do it. There is no, in that sense, it's truer to say there is no free will.
You are no more than an opening and the totality, the one consciousness expresses itself
through you.

Is that the relief? You don't have to create a new world, but it'll create itself perhaps
through you. And through presence, you may suddenly see what's needed.

Insight and realization comes, it's not egoic. There's no struggling and no effort in it. You
will always know when there's effort, then there's no alignment with presence.

There's some ego involvement there. I need to get somewhere. I need to create a better
world.

And so there'll be struggle. Effort means needing to get to the future. That's effort.

It doesn't mean that there may not be intense energy behind what you do, but it's not
the energy of effort. Effort means you're being pulled towards future. But when
something, when action arises out of presence, there may be great intensity and
passion, you could say, but not the passion that needs you to reach the future.

The doing itself, it's the doing that arises is sufficient unto itself and there's joy,
aliveness, and passion in the doing. It doesn't need the goal. Of course, in time, there's
time in the phenomenal world, the doing will result in certain forms arising, new forms
arise externally.

You don't need any of those for your salvation. You're not looking to the future for
salvation. That means there's no effort anymore, but perhaps great intensity and great
passion and great aliveness.

That's how the new world creates itself. So you may pursue a goal, but the arriving is not
all that important. Not a goal that is going to free you, not a goal that is going to
enhance your sense of self or your sense of importance.

Not in that sense. A good sign is when anything that arises out of presence, it means this
moment is not a means to an end. The doing is fulfilled and fulfilling in itself, every
moment.

You're no longer reducing the now to a means to an end, which is the old consciousness.
And then very often you create, because you have a vision of heaven, and in pursuing
your vision of heaven, you're creating hell. That's often happened.

There have been many visions of heaven and utopia. And in pursuing that, we need to
get there, there. This is the ideal image.

Once we get there, we'll be fine. We'll be free. We will be whatever we will be.
 In the meantime, we need to adopt certain means towards getting there. Okay. We need
to eliminate all those who don't believe in this goal to start with.

The madness continues. And this works on the smallest levels to observe any kind of
doing in your life, movement from here to there, walking from here to there. Is it a
means to an end, or is there a sense of completeness in the doing?

And you will notice the qualitative difference is tremendous between any action that's a
means to a future end and an action that is not a means, but there's a sense of
completeness to it. And yet there may be great energy there. We talked about eating.

Why many people lose consciousness when they eat is it's a means to an end. I need to
get this food in through the body. There's no quality, no presence.

Even making a cup of tea or a cup of coffee, is that a means to an end? The tiniest things
using them to see if you can be present with what is. It's never, the illusion in the old
consciousness is the next moment is more important than this one.

Always, always the next moment is more important than this one. It does not mean that
you have to slow down a lot, presence arising. We talked about that film I saw where
those beings, everything they do is very slow.

And sometimes when presence arises, at first people try to do everything very carefully.
And then there's a little bit of self-consciousness still there. Okay, I'm trying to be
present.

And then you see, that's not quite it either. They're simple, reaching for glass. The glass
is traveling to your mouth.

It looks like just a normal, just a normal action. And yet it's not a means to an end. And
then a sense of presence pervades the entire energy field around you.

So any action that becomes a vehicle for presence, it's a vehicle for presence. And I think
that's the beauty of the tea ceremony. As you know, they developed the tea ceremony in
Japan originally so that basically means every movement is sufficient unto itself.

You're not moving towards the end result. You're just with what is. And that is the
beauty.

It is possible that later it becomes a ritual and no longer works, there's certain deadness
after a while that comes into a ritual and they may be performing the ritual, every
movement is correct, but the presence is no longer there, that is possible too. But you
will know that anybody with the slightest presence can tell the difference between
somebody performing something like the tea ceremony or Tai Chi that requires intense
presence. And you will know, I haven't learned Tai Chi, but I can watch Tai Chi and I
 know whether they're simply going through the movements and it may look fine on the
surface, but the field of presence isn't there.

And somebody else going through the same movements and they see it emanates
presence. And so that's the beauty of Tai Chi is that no movement is a means, you're
not, when the arm moves from here, they're probably masters of Tai Chi here, so what
am I talking about? But all I know is presence.

The hand moves from here to here and usually in your mind, you're already there. So the
intervening movement or time period is a means to an end because the movement will
have completed itself when it reaches there. So you're already mentally there and the
hand is lagging behind.

So there's no presence, there's the projection of future that you're trying to get to. And
then there's the possibility of moving in a way that at any stage of the movement,
there's no movement into the future, there's continuous, you're not trying to get
anywhere, just, and there's, that's the quality of presence flowing into it. And you could
perform the same movement outwardly correctly, but you would have a mental
projection there and the master would be able to tell or anybody, even if they know
nothing about Tai Chi, would be able to tell that it doesn't, the emanation of presence
isn't there.

But I, my feeling is that, I don't know anything about it, but my feeling is that presence,
Tai Chi originated as spontaneous movement, presence expressing itself through a
human being, in spontaneous, very slow kind of dance. And no movement was planned
before. Nothing is, there's no, it moves with total nowness.

And simply one way in which presence can express itself, it can flow into. And so there
was this, perhaps it was an old woman or an old man, or who knows, a young woman or
a young man, suddenly moving and the few people around them saw, this is beautiful.
What's he doing?

What's she doing? It was totally spontaneous. And then they said, this is so beautiful, we
need to learn this.

And then gradually they started to see, okay, now he's lifting his right leg and then he
holds it up for five seconds and then it goes down. So you can, you learn it by watching
the spontaneity. Of course, now it becomes something learned, but even that can take
you into presence.

It's not how it arose originally, my feeling is. And they, so they observed and then it
became a technique, so to speak. But even the technique can work.

Although originally it came the other way around. Presence came and then it resulted in
the movement. Now you perform the movement and the movement results in presence,
 if it works as it's meant to.

So we don't need to create a new world, that's good. Don't need to worry about that.
Maybe I'll have one more question.

Thank you for choosing to share, choosing it in quotation marks. Thank you, it's good.
Thank you for choosing to share your realization.

And that's, of course, you're present. As soon as you enter the body with your attention,
you're present. But the question is, why do you prefer to teach a technique-less, to teach
in a technique-less style?

As techniques go, Vipassana is wonderful. It's a wonderful meditation. For some reason, I
don't teach techniques.

It seems that the power of the teaching or the power of presence is so strong as to not
need the intermediary of a technique. That is perhaps the reason. So it's a direct
pointing.

Just as Zen originally arose, totally no technique. And it was defined originally, Zen is
direct pointing to the essence. Usually translated as heart, but direct pointing to the
essence.

There's always the last step. Eventually, the technique is transcended, no matter how
wonderful the technique is. And a technique, the drawback with usually a technique is
that it gives you time to become good at it, to get better at it.

And steps, many stages or steps, many techniques have that. So that's the drawback.
Even if the technique is designed to take you into the timeless, it might give you time to
get there.

Many paradoxes appear when we talk about timeless and time. But that's how it is. A
technique doesn't seem to happen here.

There's simply the power of presence. If privately you find a technique helpful, that's
fine. Vipassana, whatever.

Some people practice the course in miracles. 365 lessons, one lesson per day. All
designed to take you to the realization that there's no time.

That there's only the holy instant, as it's called in the book, only now. And if you could do
 one lesson, or even half a lesson fully and totally, you would be there. Even lesson one.

Of course, then you wouldn't need the lesson anymore. And the remaining 364 lessons.
Being pure consciousness is so natural and simple, a state, at least I can see that.

Yet, since it is so very abstract too, how can you keep people from straining, mood-
making, dividing the mind, creating expectations and beliefs, et cetera, while practicing
the simple methods or portals that you offer? This first very important statement in the
question, being pure consciousness is so natural and simple a state. It is natural and
simple, a state of great simplicity, sometimes called in India, the natural state, your
natural state.

And then the question says, yet it is so very abstract. No, it's not abstract. It's simple.

What's abstract is what follows. Dividing the mind, creating expectations, beliefs, mind
streams, all that is a waste of abstraction. All of thought is abstraction.

Nevertheless, the question is valid. How do you keep people from straining? Well, I don't
try to do that.

So the question is perhaps how do I keep myself from, and even that I wouldn't try to do.
Simply watch, when we've been pointing to this, watch the movement of thought as it
arises without being it, without being completely identified with it, be present. Do you
have a choice?

We come back to the other question. Do you have a choice? Yes and no.

I would say yes, it's more helpful. I wouldn't say this to everybody because many people
in this world, there's not yet, presence has not yet emerged to the point where one could
say that they have a choice. And to many humans, it still applies what Jesus said.

They know not what they do. They know not what simply means something is operating
through them and it's mechanical. They don't, they know not what they do.

They are not conscious. They don't know, forgive them, he said, of course. Somebody
points out the psychotherapist that for people who suffer from certain biological illnesses
it can be dangerous to go off antidepressants.

So great care needs to be exercised. Thank you, that may be important to mention.
Some presence can arise also even when there's medication.

So whatever your situation is now, here you are, presence is arising no matter what. So
here we are just alert, still allowing presence to arise and presence is here. And I seem
to be saying this at the end of each retreat now and that is you're not really going
anywhere from here.
 It just appears that you are. You never really go anywhere. The core, the field of now
remains.

And around it, the scenery changes. There's the vastness of being and around it the
pictures change continuously. So all you have to do is enjoy the scenery and enjoy the
changes, the changing scenery.

So all this we already talked about that you can actually enjoy the fact that everything
passes. There's a beauty in the coming and going of form. But only if you are the knower
of the field that's underneath forms.

Then there's a beauty. There's a beauty in your own body getting old and you can enjoy
that. There's a beauty even in loss of whatever kind.

You can enjoy that. So maybe the final message is that you don't have to do anything. In
a way, the opposite of doing is what's required, allowing.

The new state of consciousness wants to arise. Presence wants to arise. It's allowing that
vaster movement to express itself through you.

So there isn't anything really you have to do. How do you allow that new consciousness,
that vaster movement to express itself through you? How can you be that hole in the
flute?

What do you have to do to be a hole? Well, Jesus used a strange expression. He says,
deny thyself.

People don't understand this. It's being misinterpreted. In other words, be selfless.

Be free of the illusion of the separate little me. Then you realize your essential nature is
that hole, your no thingness. And then you're just an instrument of God, you could say.

Just it's expressive. God expresses itself through that hole. God, he, she, it plays.

So beautiful to be nobody, and yet everything. I'll ring the bell three times, reminding
you of alertness, of the wakefulness. You want to read a poem?

I am a dual enrolled homeschool student in my sophomore year of high school. I don't mean to brag, but I have great academic credentials. I am currently taking Calculus 2 at my local university, also some other university classes. I took two APs in seventh grade and got a 5 on both exams. I have also taken several MIT OCW courses by myself and placed their completion on my high school transcript.

I am on track to complete a bachelor's in electrical engineering at age 19, and would like to apply to MIT grad school to get a PhD in theoretical physics.

However, my extracurriculars SUCK. I do EC's at my local high school, like varsity soccer and JV track, but haven't done any academically related ECs.

So, I was wondering if ""informal"" ECs are still considered in admissions by MIT. For example, I founded my own intellectual club of homeschoolers and public schoolers alike where we discuss economics and politics while sipping some coffee. I have also done social welfare activities through my church, for instance once a month we spend four hours on Sunday morning making grilled cheese sandwiches and weaving blankets, and then hand those out to the homeless. Would these count as ECs, or are they too ""informal""? Also, I have done political activism.

This is why many of the
wisest, most enlightened men and women on our planet once had a heavy pain body,
you say. So what I wanted to ask is that so many people today medicate themselves.

Any uncomfortable feelings that you have, you go to a psychiatrist or counselor,
remember, the first thing they do is prescribe medication (antidepressant) for you. Does medication (antidepressant, tranquilizers, etc ) get in
the way of using the pain body as fuel for enlightenment?
[Speaker 1 : Eckhart Tolle ] (7:35:53 - 7:37:08)

To a large extent, it does. There may be certain extreme cases when medication , antidepressants, tranquilizers, etc --  is
necessary. And for people who already are on antidepressants medication, it's certainly not advisable to
go off medication without the advice of a doctor.

So if you feel that it's time for you to get off, talk to a doctor who is relatively conscious
and can help you gradually to get off the medication. So it's really a question of not
giving in to this culturally conditioned behavior that says whenever you feel some
discomfort inside yourself, emotional disturbance, immediately to seek some external
help in the form of a substance that you ask your doctor to give you. Rather, learn to be
with inner discomfort that arises, learn to be with emotional pain that arises rather than
wanting to eliminate it.

Learn to accept it. Acceptance is one of the main focal points of this teaching. Learn to
accept whatever emotion arises in you rather than run away from it or wanting to
eliminate it.

[Speaker 2] (7:37:08 - 7:37:26)

But why? This is the thing, Eckhart. Why would I want to accept it?

That's why people are medicating themselves. That's why people eat, they gamble, they
overwork themselves, they live in denial, they become unconscious because they don't
want to deal with the pain. That's what we're all trying to get away from, is the pain.

[Speaker 1 : Eckhart Tolle ] (7:37:26 - 7:38:40)

Yes, yes. Now, if you medicate it with antidepressant, it doesn't actually go away. It dulls the pain so that
you're not conscious of it anymore.

It's still there in the background. It's the same thing for many illnesses. For example, I
had a heavy cold a couple of weeks ago.

Yes. I didn't take anything, but some people take things so that the symptoms are
suppressed of the cold. It doesn't suppress the cold.

The cold is still there. So why accept it? It's because it is here at this moment.

So it's part of bringing this inner yes to whatever arises in the present moment. It is part
of becoming friendly with the present moment, even if on the surface, the present
moment doesn't look that great. So we are bringing, and this is where the awareness
begins to come into the emotion.

If we bring acceptance to whatever we feel at this moment, rather than not wanting to
feel it, the equivalent of that would be an external situation that arises, and then I resist
it because I don't want this situation to be as it is, but it already is.


Questioner to Eckhart Tolle:

I take half of the smallest dose of Fluoxetine (Prozac) , an antidepressant medication. I have done without because I
have a belief it will keep me from awakening. However, I have greater clarity and seem
to hold presence more consistently when I continue with this small amount.

Eckhart Tolle answers: 

A related question asks, do you think the huge increased consumption of
antidepressants in recent years points to the ego's effort to suppress emerging
consciousness? Of course, antidepressants drugs are there because the emotional pain gets too much,
the pain of living, somehow an escape from the pain, dull the pain in some way. And
eventually you have to face the pain and then realize that it's not as big as it seemed.

You've been running away from a monster. And if you really look at the monster, it's not
such a big monster anymore. Facing it through presence, allowing that pain, whatever
you want to call it, existential pain, the fear associated with it, the heaviness, allowing it
to be there.

It may come in waves and then you watch the arising and subsiding of a wave of pain in
whatever form. Antidepressants make it harder to be present. If you're on this very small
dose, a time will come when you won't need that anymore and it may be very soon.

Some, it is often the pain body that manifests, as I described, the energy field of pain
body, some energy field, some pain bodies have the energy field of heaviness, great
heaviness to them. And they arise periodically. I had that.

My (Eckhart Tolle) pain body was predominantly heavy, a weight I couldn't live with, a dull pain,
continuous in the background. I (Eckhart Tolle)  might still be on antidepressants if I had taken
antidepressants at the time. Somehow I must have allowed the pain to be there without
knowing anything about allowing.

With presence growing and accelerating in you, face the pain that arises with that
 intense presence. And acceptance. And any state that arises, accept and watch it so that
it doesn't turn into a self, an unhappy self.

If you accept and watch, any state arises is just that state now. That field, that energy
field, that particular manifestation, that particular content arises. No self in it anymore.

The perpetuation of inner states is through them becoming a self, a me. Then they go on
and on. You feed them.

You feed them. And you take time away, just what is now. So that whatever the
emotional state is, the feeling state doesn't use your mind because if it uses your mind,
you're back in time and you will be in past and future, which are both heavy.

And immediately the me arises out of that. So for that, you need the intensity of
presence. Take a picture of an Isagadatta and look at that to get the quality of intensity.

Or the picture of a Zen, a painting of a Zen master, but better a photo of a master. And
then see the uncompromising quality of presence. But it allows.

Uncompromising doesn't mean it doesn't allow. Uncompromisingly, it allows. It's
uncompromising and allowing.

And anything that's faced will undergo change. We know that from dreams. We've all
had dreams, running away from some monster or you're being pursued by some
presence, some monster.

And when you finally face it in a dream, it's not that horrible. And often this is the myth.
It becomes transformed actually into a benign figure, an ancient myth.

The famous, the dragon turns into something else or the frog turns into something, a
prince. But you have to kiss the frog. Look.

Of course, you have to reduce very slowly if you are on entity presence, then careful and
very alert and very carefully do it. Check within yourself, see if there's any waiting for
the next question or this or that. Or whether there's such intensity of aliveness
throughout your entire being that this moment is good enough as it is and more than
good enough.

Is there a flight into thought as you sit there, which means into time, which means away
from this, away from now, away from the aliveness, the intensity of this moment and the
peace of this moment. What is the role of vision in creating a new world? Does vision
arise out of presence?

Vision meaning you see something before it has manifested externally. The good thing is
that you don't have to create a new world. It creates itself through presence.
 So you don't have to do it. There is no, in that sense, it's truer to say there is no free will.
You are no more than an opening and the totality, the one consciousness expresses itself
through you.

Is that the relief? You don't have to create a new world, but it'll create itself perhaps
through you. And through presence, you may suddenly see what's needed.

Insight and realization comes, it's not egoic. There's no struggling and no effort in it. You
will always know when there's effort, then there's no alignment with presence.

There's some ego involvement there. I need to get somewhere. I need to create a better
world.

And so there'll be struggle. Effort means needing to get to the future. That's effort.

It doesn't mean that there may not be intense energy behind what you do, but it's not
the energy of effort. Effort means you're being pulled towards future. But when
something, when action arises out of presence, there may be great intensity and
passion, you could say, but not the passion that needs you to reach the future.

The doing itself, it's the doing that arises is sufficient unto itself and there's joy,
aliveness, and passion in the doing. It doesn't need the goal. Of course, in time, there's
time in the phenomenal world, the doing will result in certain forms arising, new forms
arise externally.

You don't need any of those for your salvation. You're not looking to the future for
salvation. That means there's no effort anymore, but perhaps great intensity and great
passion and great aliveness.

That's how the new world creates itself. So you may pursue a goal, but the arriving is not
all that important. Not a goal that is going to free you, not a goal that is going to
enhance your sense of self or your sense of importance.

Not in that sense. A good sign is when anything that arises out of presence, it means this
moment is not a means to an end. The doing is fulfilled and fulfilling in itself, every
moment.

You're no longer reducing the now to a means to an end, which is the old consciousness.
And then very often you create, because you have a vision of heaven, and in pursuing
your vision of heaven, you're creating hell. That's often happened.

There have been many visions of heaven and utopia. And in pursuing that, we need to
get there, there. This is the ideal image.

Once we get there, we'll be fine. We'll be free. We will be whatever we will be.
 In the meantime, we need to adopt certain means towards getting there. Okay. We need
to eliminate all those who don't believe in this goal to start with.

The madness continues. And this works on the smallest levels to observe any kind of
doing in your life, movement from here to there, walking from here to there. Is it a
means to an end, or is there a sense of completeness in the doing?

And you will notice the qualitative difference is tremendous between any action that's a
means to a future end and an action that is not a means, but there's a sense of
completeness to it. And yet there may be great energy there. We talked about eating.

Why many people lose consciousness when they eat is it's a means to an end. I need to
get this food in through the body. There's no quality, no presence.

Even making a cup of tea or a cup of coffee, is that a means to an end? The tiniest things
using them to see if you can be present with what is. It's never, the illusion in the old
consciousness is the next moment is more important than this one.

Always, always the next moment is more important than this one. It does not mean that
you have to slow down a lot, presence arising. We talked about that film I saw where
those beings, everything they do is very slow.

And sometimes when presence arises, at first people try to do everything very carefully.
And then there's a little bit of self-consciousness still there. Okay, I'm trying to be
present.

And then you see, that's not quite it either. They're simple, reaching for glass. The glass
is traveling to your mouth.

It looks like just a normal, just a normal action. And yet it's not a means to an end. And
then a sense of presence pervades the entire energy field around you.

So any action that becomes a vehicle for presence, it's a vehicle for presence. And I think
that's the beauty of the tea ceremony. As you know, they developed the tea ceremony in
Japan originally so that basically means every movement is sufficient unto itself.

You're not moving towards the end result. You're just with what is. And that is the
beauty.

It is possible that later it becomes a ritual and no longer works, there's certain deadness
after a while that comes into a ritual and they may be performing the ritual, every
movement is correct, but the presence is no longer there, that is possible too. But you
will know that anybody with the slightest presence can tell the difference between
somebody performing something like the tea ceremony or Tai Chi that requires intense
presence. And you will know, I haven't learned Tai Chi, but I can watch Tai Chi and I
 know whether they're simply going through the movements and it may look fine on the
surface, but the field of presence isn't there.

And somebody else going through the same movements and they see it emanates
presence. And so that's the beauty of Tai Chi is that no movement is a means, you're
not, when the arm moves from here, they're probably masters of Tai Chi here, so what
am I talking about? But all I know is presence.

The hand moves from here to here and usually in your mind, you're already there. So the
intervening movement or time period is a means to an end because the movement will
have completed itself when it reaches there. So you're already mentally there and the
hand is lagging behind.

So there's no presence, there's the projection of future that you're trying to get to. And
then there's the possibility of moving in a way that at any stage of the movement,
there's no movement into the future, there's continuous, you're not trying to get
anywhere, just, and there's, that's the quality of presence flowing into it. And you could
perform the same movement outwardly correctly, but you would have a mental
projection there and the master would be able to tell or anybody, even if they know
nothing about Tai Chi, would be able to tell that it doesn't, the emanation of presence
isn't there.

But I, my feeling is that, I don't know anything about it, but my feeling is that presence,
Tai Chi originated as spontaneous movement, presence expressing itself through a
human being, in spontaneous, very slow kind of dance. And no movement was planned
before. Nothing is, there's no, it moves with total nowness.

And simply one way in which presence can express itself, it can flow into. And so there
was this, perhaps it was an old woman or an old man, or who knows, a young woman or
a young man, suddenly moving and the few people around them saw, this is beautiful.
What's he doing?

What's she doing? It was totally spontaneous. And then they said, this is so beautiful, we
need to learn this.

And then gradually they started to see, okay, now he's lifting his right leg and then he
holds it up for five seconds and then it goes down. So you can, you learn it by watching
the spontaneity. Of course, now it becomes something learned, but even that can take
you into presence.

It's not how it arose originally, my feeling is. And they, so they observed and then it
became a technique, so to speak. But even the technique can work.

Although originally it came the other way around. Presence came and then it resulted in
the movement. Now you perform the movement and the movement results in presence,
 if it works as it's meant to.

So we don't need to create a new world, that's good. Don't need to worry about that.
Maybe I'll have one more question.

Thank you for choosing to share, choosing it in quotation marks. Thank you, it's good.
Thank you for choosing to share your realization.

___


[Speaker 6] (8:54:30 - 8:55:17)

My question is around the issue of psychiatric medications and awakening. We have
talked about this issue on ETT Forum. It is an issue in my life situation and the life
situation of many others on the Forum.

Some believe they need to go after medications to awaken, and others say without the
medication, they would not have enough clarity to even begin to bring presence in their
lives. My question is, can a person take psychiatric medication and still awaken? Will
psychiatric medication hold a person back or slow down the awakening process?

[Speaker 1] (8:55:19 - 8:55:39)

Thank you. Thank you. May I ask a personal question?

Are you on medication?

[Speaker 2] (8:55:40 - 8:55:40)

Yes.

[Speaker 1] (8:55:41 - 9:07:16)

But you're also here. That is already part of the answer. Because for you to be here,
there must be some inner recognition of awareness.

And so despite whatever the medication is, or whatever their condition, your condition is,
there is an arising of awareness. So it's easier for me to answer this question because
you are standing there than an abstract question. You are living proof.

I'm not saying necessarily you don't experience periods when you are taken over by
whatever patterns there are in the mind. But there is an opening into awareness, which
is not the case with many people who are not on medication or who are considered
normal. They are not standing here.

Many of them are not and wouldn't be. In them, there is no opening. So one cannot say
categorically under this or that condition, awareness cannot arise, awakening cannot
happen.

As a general rule, before anybody seeks help of that kind, I would advise to explore other
possibilities. If you wish to gradually become free of medication, which in many cases
can obscure the awareness that wants to arise, you would need to do it with a physician
who is relatively conscious. There are some.

There are maybe twofold questions. One question is, with medication, is awareness able
to come through? And of course, that depends what kind of medication, or over what
period of time, and other factors.

But in some cases, I believe it is. In other cases, it's not. It can obscure the awareness.

The other question is, a certain mental, what is diagnosed as mental illness, can
awareness arise there? And again, that depends on the nature of the illness. Sometimes
in the West, shifts in consciousness are misinterpreted.

If they happen suddenly, they can be misinterpreted and misdiagnosed by a physician.
And Western physicians, because they're conditioned by the Western system, have no
idea of shifts in consciousness. It's not part of the medical model.

There are no shifts in consciousness in psychiatry. You can either, you are normal, but
normal, of course, is insane, but they don't know that. Or you are illness, you're
diseased, the mind is ill.

There are people who are put on medication, unfortunately, children sometimes, in
increasing numbers, in whom there may simply be a change in consciousness
happening. There are children who, for the most absurd reasons, are put on medication
just to keep them quiet. And people like who in India, Ramana Maharshi, the Indian sage,
who when he was 17, 16 or 17, suddenly did something that in the West would have
been regarded as a sign of severe mental illness.

He left his home, he went to, took a train, and he sat down by a temple and stopped
doing anything, didn't even put food in his mouth, just sat. And of course, in the West,
they would have put him away. And in India, they respected it and allowed him to sit
there and fed him, people came.

And after a few years, he started to speak again. And it turned out that he was
awakened, he had awakened. But the shift was so sudden that he became dysfunctional
for a while, from a normal viewpoint, became dysfunctional, couldn't operate anymore in
the world.

So this can happen to people sometimes, and it's totally misinterpreted. So often, what is
called medical psychiatric illness, not always can be a misdiagnosed shift in
consciousness. At other times, there is actually a condition there with which it would be
very difficult to live.

Many types of so-called schizophrenia, again, schizophrenia is a huge term which can be
applied if you don't know what exactly is wrong, you call it schizophrenia, it's almost like
that. The same way in the physical body, it's a viral infection, they don't really know, but
this is a term that covers a lot of things, it's a viral infection. Oh, now I know what it is.

And then schizophrenia, now I know what it is. In many cases, it is true that in mental
illness, the very cause of the illness can be total identification with certain mental
movements, lack of awareness. I've had limited success when I worked with people one-
on-one some years ago.

I had some people who had forms of schizophrenia who came to see me who were on
medication, and by sitting with them and pointing to the possibility of awareness, they
were able to become free and eventually also become free of the medication. For
example, I remember one case, a woman came to see me who had severe auditory
hallucinations, so-called voices. And again, we don't even know whether the entities
actually are talking to her, it's possible, but it really comes to the same thing, whether
it's thoughts in her head that take the form of a voice that she hears, the voice tells her
to do something, it's very insistent, or several voices sometimes, very insistent, telling
her to do this, do that, and enormous energy behind that voice.

And the way I approached it was to point out the possibility of not giving, not paying
attention to the content of what the voice says, but simply to be aware that there is a
voice speaking and that it is a voice in the head, it is a thought, I called it a thought,
maybe it's something else, but it comes to the same thing. It's a thought, it's a voice,
whatever it says, you say there's a voice, be the awareness for the voice, don't fight it,
be the awareness so that the voice, you don't do what the voice says because you
disregard the content. So if the voice says, you are God, say thank you, there's a voice
again.

If the voice says you are the devil, thank you, there's the voice again. You are the
awareness for the voice, disregard the content. Then gradually the voice lost its power
because she disregarded the content of the voice, awareness grew.

So ultimately the healing in any case is awareness. So awareness can arise in the
strangest circumstances and to people you would never have predicted could arise to,
and that includes even people who have a so-called psychiatric disorder or who are on
medication, it can happen. Nobody can categorically say that it cannot happen.

In some cases, those people are closer than normal people. As you know, there was a
movement in psychiatry in the 60s and 70s where they, it was called anti-psychiatry,
where it was recognized that often psychiatric conditions are really something else. So
it's really, it is simple in your case that obviously despite the medication, you are here
and something, a shift is happening inside you.

Nothing can stand against the power of awareness ultimately because the power of
awareness is the power of the evolution of the universe itself. So nothing really that, it
will, it seeks the slightest opening and it can come through that. So I would say that trust
that as it's happening, it will continue to happen for you.

And there may be a point when with help, the medication won't be needed anymore as
awareness grows, but you need somebody who is conscious to help you with that, a
physician who is conscious to help you with that. It's wonderful to see that it is working.

I don't mean to brag, but I have great academic credentials. I am currently taking Calculus 2 at my local university, also some other university classes. I took two APs in seventh grade and got a 5 on both exams. I have also taken several MIT OCW courses by myself and placed their completion on my high school transcript.

However, my extracurriculars SUCK. I do EC's at my local high school, like varsity soccer and JV track, but haven't done any academically related ECs.

  
So, I was wondering if ""informal"" ECs are still considered in admissions by MIT. For example, I founded my own intellectual club of homeschoolers and public schoolers alike where we discuss economics and politics while sipping some coffee. I have also done social welfare activities through my church, for instance once a month we spend four hours on Sunday morning making grilled cheese sandwiches and weaving blankets, and then hand those out to the homeless. Would these count as ECs, or are they too ""informal""? Also, I have done political activism.

1pa8d94,https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/1pa8d94/i_built_the_full_local_llm_logsummarizer_system/,I built the full local LLM log-summarizer system from yesterday's post.... complete....,"Yesterday I posted about an idea inspired by this XDA article:

https://www.xda-developers.com/my-local-llm-writes-summaries-of-my-home-lab-logs-every-night/

The concept was simple:  
Pull your Docker logs → feed them into a local LLM → get a clean daily summary of issues, warnings, and system events.

A lot of people commented that:
- the original article didn’t include a full implementation  
- they wanted to try it  
- they wanted something usable out-of-the-box  
- they wanted N8N / LM Studio compatibility  
- and they wanted it to run fully local

So... after 2 monsters and a coffee I built the whole thing.  
A complete, documented, production-ready implementation.

### ✅ What I built
I put together a full system that does the entire pipeline:

- FastAPI backend that:
  - pulls Docker logs (all or selected containers)
  - filters noise (health checks, heartbeat spam, etc.)
  - sends the cleaned logs to a LOCAL LLM via LM Studio
  - returns a structured JSON summary

- N8N workflow that:
  - runs nightly at 22:00
  - calls the API
  - formats the results
  - sends a clean HTML daily email

- Docker Compose setup  
- Full documentation (setup, models, troubleshooting, architecture)  
- Example outputs  
- Quickstart script  
- MIT licensed

Everything is fully offline. No cloud usage. No API costs.

### ✅ GitHub repo (complete build)
**https://github.com/WhiskeyCoder/homelab-log-analyzer**

Repo includes:
- `log_analyzer.py` (FastAPI app)
- `n8n_workflow.json`
- `docker-compose.yml`
- `Dockerfile`
- `requirements.txt`
- `quickstart.sh`
- Full `docs/` folder (setup, architecture, API reference, etc.)

### 🎯 Why this is useful
Even a small homelab produces weird logs:
- random container restarts  
- memory spikes  
- backup successes/failures  
- network hiccups  
- errors that get buried under noise  

This gives you a clean daily overview without digging through logs manually.

### 100% Local
The LLM runs inside LM Studio on your mini-PC / NUC / server.  
You can use any small model like:
- Qwen 1.5B  
- Phi-3 Mini  
- Llama-3.2 3B  
- anything LM Studio supports  

### 💬 Feedback welcome
If you try it, let me know how it runs on your setup.  


Hope this helps anyone who wanted to experiment with local LLM automation in their homelab!

Marketed as quick fixes for low energy, these beverages promise an instant jolt of vitality. However, beneath the vibrant cans and bold promises lies a hidden concern: energy drinks and** [**blood glucose**](https://beautykabir.com/the-complete-guide-to-coffeetea-and-artificial-sweeteners/) **spikes. This phenomenon, where blood sugar levels surge rapidly after consumption, can have serious implications for health, particularly for those managing diabetes or prediabetes. Understanding the connection between energy drinks and blood glucose spikes is crucial, as it affects millions who unknowingly risk their metabolic health with every sip.**



**This comprehensive guide dives deep into the science, risks, and solutions surrounding energy drinks and blood glucose spikes. We’ll explore the ingredients driving these surges, the health consequences, and practical strategies to avoid them. Whether you’re a student pulling an all-nighter, an athlete seeking performance enhancement, or simply someone navigating daily demands, grasping the impact of energy drinks on blood glucose spikes empowers you to make informed choices. By the end, you’ll have the tools to sidestep these pitfalls and embrace sustainable energy sources.**

# What Are Energy Drinks?

**Energy drinks are non-alcoholic beverages designed to provide a rapid energy boost. Typically packaged in sleek, eye-catching cans or bottles, they contain a cocktail of stimulants, vitamins, and sweeteners. Popular brands like Red Bull, Monster, and Rockstar dominate the market, with global sales exceeding $50 billion annually. These drinks emerged in the 1980s, inspired by Asian tonic beverages, and have since exploded in popularity among young adults, gamers, and fitness enthusiasts.**

**At their core, energy drinks and blood glucose spikes are intertwined because of their formulation. A standard 16-ounce can might pack 80-300 milligrams of caffeine—equivalent to two to three cups of coffee—alongside B vitamins, amino acids like taurine, and often high amounts of sugar. Sugar-free variants replace sucrose with artificial sweeteners, but they still deliver a caffeine punch. While these components aim to enhance alertness and physical performance, they can disrupt the body’s delicate blood sugar balance, leading to unpredictable energy drinks and blood glucose spikes.**

**Consumers often overlook the nutritional profile. A single serving can deliver up to 60 grams of sugar, more than the American Heart Association’s daily recommended limit for men (36 grams) and women (25 grams). This isn’t just empty calories; it’s a recipe for metabolic mayhem. As we’ll see, the interplay of these elements directly contributes to the rollercoaster of energy drinks and blood glucose spikes that leaves many feeling worse than before.**

# Understanding Blood Glucose Spikes

**Blood glucose, or blood sugar, is the primary energy source for your body’s cells, derived mainly from carbohydrates in food and drinks. Normally, levels fluctuate mildly: fasting glucose hovers between 70-99 mg/dL, rising post-meal to under 140 mg/dL. The hormone insulin, produced by the pancreas, shuttles glucose into cells for use or storage, maintaining equilibrium.**

**A blood glucose spike occurs when levels soar rapidly—often exceeding 180 mg/dL—triggering a cascade of physiological responses. This isn’t a gentle rise; it’s a sharp ascent, like flooring the gas pedal on a highway. The body responds by overproducing insulin, which can then cause glucose too low, causing a “crash” with symptoms like shakiness, irritability, and fatigue. Chronic spikes erode insulin sensitivity, paving the way for type 2 diabetes.**

**In the context of energy drinks and blood glucose spikes, these surges are amplified by the beverages’ high glycemic load. The rapid absorption of sugars and stimulants bypasses the slow-release mechanisms of whole foods, hitting the bloodstream like a freight train. For healthy individuals, occasional spikes might pass unnoticed, but repeated exposure compounds risks. Factors like stress, lack of sleep, or underlying conditions exacerbate the issue, making energy drinks and blood glucose spikes a volatile combination.**

**Research underscores this volatility. Studies show that even moderate consumption can elevate glucose by 20-30% within an hour, prolonging elevated levels for up to two hours. This isn’t mere theory; it’s a measurable disruption that affects daily functioning and long-term health.**

# The Ingredients in Energy Drinks That Drive Blood Glucose Spikes

**To unravel the mystery of energy drinks and blood glucose spikes, we must dissect their ingredients. Each component plays a role in this metabolic drama, from direct sugar influx to indirect hormonal interference.**

# High Sugar Content: The Primary Culprit

**Most energy drinks are sugar-laden bombs. A typical can contains 20-60 grams of added sugars like high-fructose corn syrup or sucrose, which break down into glucose almost immediately upon ingestion. This leads to a swift influx into the bloodstream, causing an acute spike. For perspective, that’s like downing four to six teaspoons of sugar in minutes—far beyond what a balanced meal provides.**

**The glycemic index of these sugars is sky-high, ensuring rapid absorption. In one study, participants consuming a sugary energy drink saw glucose levels peak at 150-200 mg/dL within 30 minutes, far sharper than from fruit or grains. This direct link explains why energy drinks and blood glucose spikes are synonymous for many users, especially those with impaired glucose tolerance.**

# Caffeine’s Dual Role in Disruption

**Caffeine, the star stimulant, clocks in at 80-200 mg per serving. While it blocks adenosine receptors for alertness, it also signals the liver to release stored glycogen as glucose—a process called gluconeogenesis. This endogenous sugar dump compounds dietary intake, amplifying spikes.**

**Moreover, caffeine impairs insulin sensitivity. A Mayo Clinic review notes that 200 mg can raise blood sugar by 8% in sensitive individuals, with effects lingering for hours. Even decaf alternatives can’t fully mitigate this, as chronic exposure builds tolerance, making energy drinks and blood glucose spikes more pronounced over time.**

# Other Additives: Taurine, B Vitamins, and Sweeteners

**Taurine, an amino acid, is touted for cardiovascular benefits but may interact with caffeine to heighten glucose release. B vitamins support metabolism but don’t prevent spikes; in excess, they can stress the liver.**

**Sugar-free energy drinks swap sugar for aspartame or sucralose, but these non-nutritive sweeteners aren’t innocent. Emerging research links them to gut microbiome changes that indirectly worsen insulin resistance, potentially sustaining low-level energy drinks and blood glucose spikes. Sodium and preservatives add dehydration risks, concentrating blood glucose further.**

**Together, these ingredients create a perfect storm, where energy drinks and blood glucose spikes aren’t just possible—they’re predictable.**

# How Energy Drinks Trigger Blood Glucose Spikes: The Science

**The mechanism behind energy drinks and blood glucose spikes is rooted in physiology. Upon consumption, sugars hit the small intestine, where enzymes convert them to monosaccharides for absorption. This floods the portal vein, elevating plasma glucose within 15-30 minutes.**

**Caffeine enters the fray via the central nervous system, stimulating adrenaline release. This catecholamine prompts hepatic glucose output, overriding insulin’s braking effect. A 2015 study on adolescents found that a caffeine-heavy, sugar-free energy drink raised glucose by 25% and insulin by 20% over two hours, despite no added carbs. The beta cells overcompensate, but in insulin-resistant states, this fails, prolonging hyperglycemia.**

**Meta-analyses confirm this: five of seven caffeine studies show prolonged high glucose periods post-ingestion. For chronic users, repeated energy drinks and blood glucose spikes foster adaptation, where the body requires more insulin, accelerating prediabetes.**

**Real-world data from continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) paints a vivid picture. Users report peaks of 200+ mg/dL after a single can, followed by dips below 70 mg/dL—symptoms mirroring hypoglycemia. This yo-yo effect isn’t energizing; it’s exhausting, underscoring why energy drinks and blood glucose spikes demand scrutiny.**

# Health Risks Associated with Energy Drinks and Blood Glucose Spikes

**Beyond immediate discomfort, energy drinks and blood glucose spikes pose cascading risks. Acute spikes strain the pancreas, hastening beta-cell burnout. Over time, this contributes to type 2 diabetes, with studies linking frequent consumption to a 20% higher incidence.**

**Cardiovascular threats loom large. Spikes correlate with endothelial dysfunction, raising hypertension and heart disease. A MUSC study tied energy drinks to blood pressure surges, compounded by glucose volatility. Dehydration from caffeine’s diuretic action thickens blood, elevating clot risks.

I enjoy classic earthy and bitter espresso, and I really enjoy the Americano like coffees that come with that texture as well. Obviously I don't get that texture out of an aeropress, but I do flavor wise on the aeropress.

Now, I have been messing with recommended specialty coffee roasters in the UAE and I have had these two experiences:

Coffee Lab's Brazil - Chocolate, Nuts, and Caramel

Falcon's Costa Rica ""Black Honey"" - Grapes, Plum Compote, Malt

The first one is pretty simple, is the usual dark roasted coffee flavor but way better quality than usual, and a very sweet flavor if you are able nail that mid point between acidity and bitterness, I never tried the soup shot with this, but the americano like brews I did where really enjoyable. The only bad thing is that I couldn't get this earthy flavor out of it, more on that later.

The second one has been a journey, the Americano like drinks I made with it were very interesting, great to accompany some dessert, but... it just didn't hit that that a coffee should hit, but then I tried Lance's soup shot and oh boy WOAH. I have never tasted anything like it, very very very enjoyable with a very unique flavor for my young experience with specialty coffee. But again, no earthiness, and specially with this one is just not possible to get that classic coffee flavor.

Is this expected? I'm surprised tha with specialty coffees, these flavor notes do change your experience, specially if you don't go super dark.

Still, this makes me wonder, what makes a good cup of coffee? How do I measure that flavor wise?

Furthermore, is there a way to get a earthy classic flavor out of specialty coffee? What notes should I get? Or should I just get cheap very dark roasted colombian-venezuelan coffee?

1pa88bh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Epilepsy/comments/1pa88bh/i_hate_postictal_chills/,I hate post-ictal chills,"I just so happened to have an episode the day before my follow-up appointment with my neurologist. That was 3 weeks ago and she suggested increasing my dosage. I did so, and it has been 3 weeks since then.

No idea why, or what might have triggered it, but I had an episode today. I was pretty tired when I woke up this morning, but that's not unusual - wake up a bit tired, have breakfast, eat my morning dosage of meds, continue on the day.

The only difference is that I didn't have coffee this morning. I decided to take an afternoon nap because I was still feeling weak and tired. That's when the episode happened... I was sleeping, then idk why, I suddenly had the seizure/shook/vibrated/whatever and woke up with Post-ictal Chills. I doubt it, but do you think the lack of coffee in the morning had anything to do with it?

Usually the chills are my entire body. Today it was just my upper body and you could see the goosebumps. My neurologist had said that if I felt like I needed to, I could take an extra 10mg of Frisium/Clobazam, and so I did. Do you guys think this was a good idea?

I wanted to hug and hold my baby but I couldn't because I was feeling the chills, but if I held her j would feel just too hot. 😞 Eventually the chills went away, but as you know, the time before the chills go away varies and this time it was a bit longer.",1,1764474008.0,Epilepsy,1,1.0,False
1pa87vl,https://www.reddit.com/r/lokean/comments/1pa87vl/loop_of_struggling/,loop of struggling,"I make a lot of posts about my personal experience with Loki. But this post might make some frown upon me or make them feel as if I'm using Loki as an excuse for what I'm about to say.

Loki knew I had ADHD before I realized it. I don't like putting too much personal stuff out on the internet, so I will continue to be vague about it. I have had many people tell me I'm neurodivergent and never listened, until the same problems I struggle with have started becoming worse. I thought I was lazy and just couldn't be bothered. But it got to the point where not even coffee is helping me and makes me fall asleep instead, or it makes me energized but comes with heavy burnout to the point of fatigue for two whole days. I started digging deeper into family and personal issues, and the person I'm dating has even said I have it, and they have autism/ADHD. That still wasn't enough for me to think so until I started doing a little research. Almost all things point to this; getting diagnosed can confirm it, though, I don't want to self-diagnose and make an excuse for myself. 

Loki's relation in this? He's been watching over me for years, and I didn't realize it yet, even possibly since my childhood. I always had these dreams of an invisible entity chasing me. It didnt have a body or outline and there was nothing that could give away the fact that i could feel it coming to get me, it was always there I could never turn on lights, it was always in my room, it would come after me when i was alone and tried to keep me isolated from family that I disconnected with over the years bc they were toxic, and i enjoy being alone in the dark now. Loki's energy feels similar to the one in the dream, only I'm not afraid and feel comforted more than anything. Those dreams started coming back since I've connected with him. I still haven't figured out the reason why he'd want to get close to me when I was younger or why he's been reaching out to me for so long, but we're here now, so it's not on my mind as much.

I've talked to Loki a lot about the things I struggle with, and he's been giving the same stand-by feeling with a wincing smile, unless it comes to the point of me being hard on myself and forcing myself to be normal and function as everyone else does. He's always been there to lighten the mood and hug me, bring comfort, and so much more. I'm always tense and on my own ass, and he tends to be upset with that. I struggle with a lot of things, but the hardest challenge of all has been patience and giving myself time that I need, I find it hard to beleive it takes me this much time to improve and its been a struggle for years, the same thing and it gets harder, but with everything i've tried and with how often Loki points this out, I'm trying to, really, but it feels like I'm wasting time when I could be taking action.

I'm told to sit down over and over again, and I do until the guilt hits. If I'm tired and lie down, I start to feel lazy and get myself up, and am too tired to do anything, when I let myself rest and realize I've been in bed till noon, I feel anxiety and like I should get up and do something productive, but never can unless it is something I want to do specifically. I'm trying to give myself patience and time, and I feel I consume too much of it. I know I can take my time, and I just can't. I always worry and struggle with time, and it's something I wish I had more grasp of.

 I don't want to keep going on like this, whether it's because of it or not. It's exhausting trying to navigate and push myself through the constant struggle. I know it's all something I'm doing for myself, and it's a goal I made for myself with no other pressure but my own. But I feel terrible all the time and don't like how I feel; I don't have time. Like I'll never grow out of this, always conscious and aware of myself and what I struggle with to the point where it's an inflection of my self-awareness, but can never break these patterns, I feel I lack what I need to finally do that, and that I am missing something in all of this, yet can't break the cycle.",1,1764473968.0,lokean,0,1.0,False

BUT because of the urgency of how my labor started, this basket was left behind at home and completely forgotten about until I returned (sorry to my nurses!! Still absolutely loved my nurses and were so thankful for them!). This basket consisted of coffees, body armours, granola bars, beef sticks, goldfish, and other little snacks. It ended up on my nightstand and I was SOOOO thankful to have that basket in the middle of the night and early morning because I would wake up STARVING!! I literally lived in this snack basket for the first 2-3 weeks of my baby’s life bc of how easy it was and I didn’t have to leave my room. It was literally SO amazing!! 

Now I have a friend that just had her second baby and I was going to bring her dinner this week. Instead of bringing a dessert, I was thinking about bringing her a snack basket similar to this because of how helpful it seemed to be for me. She’s formula feeding instead of breastfeeding so I’m not entirely sure if she would have those midnight cravings like I did or if this basket would be kinda useless to her. Any thoughts would be appreciated!

She's always been a snacker, problem is I'm getting glutened in the process because she touches everything not realizing she's got gluten on her hands. Pretty sure tonight's glutening was because I took her coffee cup out of the microwave and then put my plate in there which included garlic bread that you eat with your hands. 

What are some not outrageously priced and normal snacky type food I can buy at like Walmart or WinCo? She's supposed to be on a MIND diet which combines the Mediterranean and DASH diet but we're failing miserably at that.

1pa7v6z,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueCrimeDiscussion/comments/1pa7v6z/gainesville_ripper_the_ripple_effect_of_violent/,Gainesville Ripper - the ripple effect of violent crime,"So this article illustrates all the knock on impacts these evil monsters cause on far, far more people than just their victims.

[The Serial Killer Who Inspired Scream terrorised my College Town 35 years ago & left me too terrified to sleep](https://people.com/serial-killer-gainesville-ripper-danny-rolling-exclusive-11763591)

And it reminds me of my own peripheral experience with this horrible mass killing. It was nothing near as serious as the authors' let alone the victims families, but shows how far the impacts can extend.

Apologies for the long post but I think it needs the details for context.

So I was a 21 year old Aussie holidaying in the US with three mates and late Aug 1990 found us in Cocoa Beach a couple hours south of Gainesville. We were staying there whilst visiting Cape Canaveral and waiting to see a Space Shuttle launch in a few days time (it got cancelled).

We had been at a local bar that night where service men and women were being farewelled for the (1st) Gulf War. Late evening we left the bar to get a pizza I think.

In the car park waiting for our pizza, a big 5 litre Camaro pulled up with a young lady of similar age who was extremely distressed and seemingly intoxicated behind the wheel. I recalled I had talked to her a bit at the bar ealier in the evening so asked her what was wrong. She told us that her sister was one of the victims at Gainesville which we had heard about on that evening's news.

She understandably seemed very erratic, and we were worried about her safety.  Asked if we could call the police to help her but she didn’t want that.  Eventually I convinced her to come get a coffee from a late-night diner a few miles down the road where we could maybe talk through how to help her.  She tearfully agreed.  I suggested she leave the Camaro and we get a cab, but she wouldn’t have a bar of that.   She asked me to jump in the passenger seat to direct her while my friends could get a cab.

I clearly should not have gotten in that car nor let her drive. Even as a bullet proof 21 year old, I must have known it was a bad decision.  But she refused to get out and I couldn't really offer to drive as I had been drinking and also I had never driven a stick. So I got in.  What ensued was a 15 minute or so drive that I thought would be the last of my life.

This poor girl took off, still in tears and drove that huge car extremely fast and extremely erratically.  I was sure we were going to have a high speed accident.  The whole time we were driving she was yelling that we have to find the killer whilst I was begging her to slow down.  She then pulled out a pistol which didn’t make me feel any better.  We went flying past the diner at probably 75 mph and in no time we were on a deserted road with swamp either side.  Her driving and yelling got worse the further we went.

I was 100% sure I had to get out of that Camaro very soon or likely die.  I was trying to calculate the merits of jumping when she slowed for the next corner, but just then she asked me what was wrong.  I told her she was going to kill us both, so she then slammed on the brakes, screeching to a dead halt in the middle of the road.  I could have gotten out then, but it seemed like all the adrenalin had left her and she apologised profusely whilst still bawling.  

After a bit of a chat to calm us both down, she drove us sedately back to the diner, but when we arrived it had closed.  My friends had arrived there in a cab and were waiting, wondering what happened to me.  I got out of the car then and we all tried to talk her again into letting us call the police. But she became angry and erratic again and pointed the pistol at us threatening us.  We backed off and she yelled some final threats and drove away at high speed. 

No doubt we should have called the police at some point as she was clearly a danger to herself and potentially others.  But without cell phones that wasn't as straight forward as today in what was then a relatively sparsely populated area late at night. For whatever reason we didn’t subsequently call once had gotten back to our motel.  We did check the news the next few days and there were no mention of any incidents in the area so hopefully she made it wherever she needed to be that night safely.

So I can’t know for sure that she was the sister of a victim.  She had seemed fine at the bar earlier in the night. Maybe she was having an unrelated medical episode.

I think cell phones would have been very rare even in the US, but pagers were more common in 1990. If she had just gotten a message or even rung home to check in from the bar and literally received the news of her sister a few minutes before driving into that car park, that would very much explain her behaviour.

Either way her distress was 100% real and I definitley felt in the moment that she was being sincere that the most horrible thing had just happened to her sister and her family.

To be clear, I am not scarred by this myself.

Definitely that night was the closest I have come to a potentially very bad outcome for me. But (and I did recently fact check what I could with my 3 still mates as has been 35 years) whilst I and they were rattled for a day or two, we were 21 having the best holiday of our lives which we then picked up & continued right on with.

I just think about this night and that girl from time to time when I read articles like this.

I think what it must have been like for her when the Scream movies got released, on each anniversary of the killings, and when articles and posts like this are published. I really hope she was ok and that she has gotten past the events of that night. 

It still makes me a bit sad when I do think about it even 35 years later. And I think it illustrates the breadth of impact these monsters have on whole communities.",13,1764472863.0,TrueCrimeDiscussion,0,1.0,False

I think my parents are as close to perfect as you can get parenting-wise. I don’t think its anything they could’ve done differently because, not to toot my own horn, I am SO thoughtful of others, and so empathetic to a point where its sometimes a fault of mine, and we’ve grown up together with the same parents since birth. For an example of her selfishness, we were getting in the car and my sister just casually set an almost empty coffee cup on the ground because we weren’t near a trash. Being a sister I let her have it, my mom took the more motherly/parenting approach, while I sort of yelled at her/ asked wtf is wrong with her lol. I can’t stand littering for obvious reasons. Another example, we were at the store and she wanted to see what a make up was like, so she was going to just open it, like she wasn’t considering buying it or anything, she was just gonna open it to test it out and put it back. To me this is a f-you to the employees and just to whoever might wanna buy that. Idk, its just such a selfish thing to do. And less serious examples is just eating people’s food in the house without asking, its like she wants it and doesn’t think/doesn’t care how it effects anyone else.

I feel like you can’t teach selflessness. Either they care/ think about others or they don’t. I know they’re little you can explain how that would make someone else feel and ask if they would want to feel like that, but past like 13 I don’t know what to do.",1,1764472392.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

1pa7osx,https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingmom/comments/1pa7osx/need_an_out_from_christmas/,Need an out from Christmas,"I am flirting with burnout.

I’m a mom of two - my second baby was born last Christmas Eve. Since September I’ve taken three international work trips (most recently 14 days in Asia), which was hard with a baby! I just got a major promotion, and then we flew from the Midwest to California for Thanksgiving with sick kids. It was exhausting and I haven’t slept in weeks

My dream is to slow down, be home, celebrate my son’s first birthday, maybe create some new family traditions of our own. Just a quiet Christmas with my little crew, pajamas, coffee, no suitcases.

But my mom who can be a to be a LOT is insisting we travel 4+ hours to her place for Christmas. She’s not really hearing my exhaustion or the fact that we’re barely holding it together. I feel guilty even considering saying no, but I’m honestly tapped out.

I also am feeling guilty that I travel so much for work but I want a break from traveling for personal. Like if I can do 3 Asian cities across 3 countries in 14 days, surely I can manage driving across 94, right? But it’s just be used I’m so tired of travel I want to be home ",1,1764472312.0,breakingmom,8,0.66,False

On the eve of Isabelle Darroch's wedding to Matteo Norkett, paparazzi caught him hanging out with an intern from his company late at night.
In a fit of rage, Isabelle bought a plane ticket, trying to get away for a bit.
But when she opened her eyes again, she found herself five years in the future.
Panicked, she tried calling her parents, only to find that their numbers no longer worked.
When a message appeared on her computer saying ""This identity has been deregistered due to death,"" it nearly knocked the wind out of her.
Tears streamed down her cheeks, dripping onto her phone screen.
The screen lit up, revealing her wallpaper—a wedding photo of her and Matteo.
Isabelle finally realized who she could turn to.
She quickly unlocked her phone and called Matteo.
She held her breath, counting each ""beep"" from the receiver.
Then, a familiar voice came through. ""Hello?""
The worry in Isabelle's heart suddenly lifted, and all her frustration and confusion spilled out at once.
""Honey, something weird just happened... I'm really scared. Can you come get me?""
After a moment of silence, Matteo calmly replied, ""Okay.""
***
It wasn't until Isabelle stepped into the familiar office that she finally felt like things were real again.
She threw herself into Matteo's arms and cried her heart out.
After what felt like forever, Matteo frowned and gently pulled her away.
""Wait, are you saying you traveled through time?""
Isabelle nodded quickly, but Matteo let out a cold sneer.
""You really think I'm going to buy that? Five years ago, you never showed up at our wedding, and now, you come up with this ridiculous story.""
""You don't believe me?""
Just a few days ago, they had taken their wedding photos together. But right now, the guy in front of her felt completely unfamiliar.
""How can I believe any of this?
""Five years ago, you vanished without a trace. Our engagement turned into a joke. And your parents died in a car accident after searching for you for days without sleeping a wink.""
Isabelle shut her eyes tight, feeling a wave of pain wash over her as she tried to calm her shaking body.
After a while, she finally managed to find her voice.
""What about you? Did you even try to look for me these past five years?""
Matteo didn't reply, just giving her a cold stare.
Just then, a soft voice sounded as the door creaked open.
""Honey, I brought you some coffee...""
Isabelle froze, and the blood in her veins seemed to have turned to ice.
She couldn't bring herself to turn around, but she could feel someone getting closer step by step.
Matteo reached out and put his arm around the person's shoulders, his voice softening.
""As you can see, I'm married. This is my wife, Brianna Tarne.""
The person who came into Isabelle's view was the very same intern photographed with Matteo five years ago.
Brianna had her hair casually pulled back in a bun, and she wore a friendly smile.
""Hey there!""
Isabelle's mind reeled.
In just one night, she'd lost not only her parents but also the love of her life.
She turned around, her steps shaky as she tried to walk out.
""Isabelle,"" Matteo piped up, his voice calm as ever. ""You don't have anywhere to go right now.
""For old times' sake, why don't you stay in our home for a bit? We'll figure things out together.""
Brianna stepped up, took Isabelle's hand, and said softly, ""Yeah, I don't know what's going on. But you look really upset. You must be dealing with something tough. Why not come back with us for now?""
Isabelle felt like her heart had been torn apart; a dull ache spread through her chest.
Once, home had meant the place that belonged only to her and Matteo.
But now, the ""home"" he talked about was one he shared with another woman.
Just like that, Isabelle found herself being led to the underground parking lot.
Matteo smoothly opened the front passenger door, and without thinking much about it, Isabelle got in.
Matteo frowned a bit but didn't say anything. Instead, he gently helped Brianna into the back seat.
Isabelle clenched her fists, cringing with embarrassment after she realized how rude she had been.
Once, the passenger seat of Matteo's car had been hers alone. But now, Brianna was his wife.
The car started up, and the stereo that used to blare the jazz and drum beats Isabelle loved now played soft music.
The car drove along the route she remembered so well, finally pulling up in front of the familiar villa. This place had once been where she and Matteo would live after they got married.
Every little detail inside and out had been designed by Matteo to suit her taste.
But now? It looked completely unfamiliar.
Isabelle was shown to the guest room on the first floor. Before she could even sit down, a few maids rushed in.
""Ms. Darroch, right? Mrs. Norkett is pregnant, so we need to check if you've brought anything dangerous with you.""
The word ""pregnant"" hit Isabelle like a punch to the gut, making her vision blur.
So they were expecting a baby now?
She should've been the one marrying Matteo five years ago. But now, she felt like an outsider who didn't belong here.
Not getting any response, the maids went straight for her bag.
""Ms. Darroch, please don't take offense.""
Isabelle dug her nails into her palms; that little bit of pain helped clear her head just enough.
Once, she had been the lady of this house. Now, she was treated like a threat. They even wanted to go through her bag right in front of everyone.
She looked up at the maids, her voice getting a bit sharper. ""Is this Matteo's idea?""
One of them nodded. ""Yes, he told us to make sure Mrs. Norkett is safe.""
""If that's what he wants, then tell him to come search my bag himself!""
As soon as she said that, the maids seemed to chicken out. After exchanging looks, they quickly left the room.
Finally alone in the room, Isabelle felt that familiar wave of abandonment wash over her once more.
She slid down the door and plopped onto the floor, hugging her knees with both hands and crying so hard she could barely breathe.
Through blurry eyes, she noticed her unzipped bag on the ground—and a corner of a plane ticket sticking out.
She stopped crying and reached for the ticket.
The printed words made her heart skip a beat.
The date clearly read, ""Return to September 30, 2020, in seven days.""
Chapter 2
Isabelle's heart was racing in her chest.
In just seven days, she could head back to 2020, and everything could go back to how it used to be.
She jumped up quickly and tucked the plane ticket under her pillow.
As night fell, Isabelle lay awake for what felt like forever.
Every time she shut her eyes, all she could picture was Matteo holding Brianna while she slept peacefully.
Suddenly feeling thirsty, she instinctively reached for the bedside table.
In the past, Matteo would make her a cup of warm water every night. But now, the bedside table was totally empty.
Isabelle had no choice but to get up and head to the living room. She had just filled a glass with water and turned around when she heard footsteps coming down the stairs.
Matteo was in dark loungewear, his face still looking pretty indifferent.
As he walked past her, he didn't even glance her way for a second, like she wasn't even there.
Isabelle tightened her grip on the glass of water and decided to break the silence.
""It's really late. Haven't you gone to bed yet?""
""Hmm,"" Matteo kept walking without stopping. ""Anna's in her first trimester. She gets hungry at night pretty easily. I'm just going to warm up some milk for her.""
That one sentence made all the words she wanted to say stick in her throat.
She nodded bitterly. ""Then I'll head back first.""
""Wait,"" Matteo suddenly called out to her. ""Can you give me back that emerald pendant?""
He frowned a bit and nodded toward the necklace around Isabelle's neck.
Isabelle froze, reaching up to touch the emerald pendant.
It was a family heirloom that had been passed down through the Norkett family for generations. Matteo had put it on her himself when he proposed. He'd said, ""With this pendant, let our hearts be united forever.""
But now he wanted it back. Was he planning to give it to Brianna?
Isabelle fought back tears, unclasped the pendant, and placed it on the nearby dining table. Then she turned around and headed back to her room.
After shutting the door, Isabelle didn't bother turning on the light. A bitter ache spread from her throat down into her chest.
It really seemed like he loved Brianna deeply.
Darkness wrapped around Isabelle as her fingers slowly moved down to rest on her belly.
""What about our baby?""
When she first found out she was pregnant, she had been trying to figure out how to break the news to Matteo.
But then came those paparazzi photos that changed everything.
Was it work? Or just a business dinner?
She would have believed him no matter what he said.
But he didn't even give her a decent explanation, so she acted on impulse and hopped on that plane.
And that was how she ended up time-traveling, landing in this strange five-year jump.
Isabelle lay in the dark until almost dawn before she finally drifted into a light sleep.
When she woke up, her head was pounding.
Stepping out of her room, she spotted Matteo and Brianna already at the dining table having breakfast.
Isabelle found a corner seat and plopped down.
A maid set the breakfast down in front of her. With the soft clink of porcelain plates, Brianna smiled warmly.
""Belle, don't be so formal; just treat this like your own place.""
But Matteo jumped in with a cold reminder. ""This is just a temporary stay. This house has only one woman, and that's Anna.""
He then glanced at Isabelle's breakfast. ""It's still your usual order. I hope your taste hasn't changed.""
Isabelle looked up, catching the mockery in Matteo's eyes.
He still didn't believe her. He still thought she'd run away from their wedding five years ago. So now he was using her food preferences to tease her about that change of heart she had back then.
Brianna lightly tapped Matteo's arm, pretending to be annoyed.
""You're so mean. Why are you being so tough on Belle?""
Matteo's furrowed brows relaxed a bit. He reached over and tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear.
""I've got to head to the office this morning. Just stay in today; I've asked a doctor to come by and check on you.""
Brianna puffed out her cheeks playfully. ""But staying home all day is super boring! I want to get some fresh air.""
""Just behave for now. I'll take you for a walk in the garden later this afternoon.""
Isabelle held the spoon in her hand, but inside she felt cold as ice.
She thought, ""Matteo, you're really harsh. You're making me watch you love someone else, the same way you once loved me.""
She took a deep breath, forced down a few spoonfuls of food, and got ready to head back to her room.
""Isabelle,"" Matteo suddenly said. ""The driver will take you to your parents' graves.""
Chapter 3
Isabelle's eyes flickered a bit, but Matteo seemed to have seen it coming, his tone getting a little chilly.
""Don't get me wrong.
""I'm only doing this because of the old friendship between the Norkett and Darroch families. Don't get any crazy ideas or let your imagination run wild about anything else.""
""Hmm,"" Isabelle replied, her voice sounding a bit rough. ""Thanks.""
Back in her room, Isabelle stared at her small suitcase, feeling lost in thought.
When she had jumped on the plane in a fit of anger, she'd just thrown in two changes of clothes. She didn't even have anything decent to wear to the cemetery.
Suddenly, there was a knock at the door.
""Belle, can I come in?""
Before Isabelle could say anything, the door was gently pushed open.
Brianna walked in first, followed by two maids carrying a bunch of matching outfits.
""I noticed you didn't bring many clothes with you. These were all picked out by Matt for me, and I haven't worn any of them yet. Since you're heading to the cemetery to see your parents, you should dress appropriately.""
Isabelle looked down and started fidgeting with her fingers.
There was a time when Matteo treated her just as well.
Whenever there were new styles from her favorite brand, he'd have the right sizes hung in her walk-in closet right away.
Noticing that Isabelle wasn't reacting, Brianna signaled for the maids to hang all the clothes in the wardrobe.
""Alright, Belle, you can pick whatever you like. Matt is still waiting for me.""
A shy smile suddenly appeared on her face, and there was a bit of boasting in her voice.
""He's so clumsy. He can never tie his tie properly! He won't go out unless I do it for him.""
As the sound of footsteps faded away, Isabelle stared at the clothes in the wardrobe, her eyes welling up with tears.
She thought, ""Is this what their married life is like every day?
""But why was there never any sweetness between us in those eight years?""
In the end, Isabelle still put on her own clothes.
When she got into the car Matteo had arranged for her, she was surprised to see a familiar face in the rearview mirror.
""Robert?""
Robert turned around, looking really shocked. ""Ms. Darroch? When did you get back?""
Isabelle didn't know what to say. She wasn't sure how to explain her crazy time-travel experience again.
But once Robert started talking, he seemed to open up.
""You won't believe it. After you ran off from the wedding, Mr. Norkett replaced all the maids in the house. Even though I stayed on, I wasn't allowed to mention anything about you.
""Half a year after you left, Mr. Norkett married Ms. Tarne. He treats her even better than he treated you back then...""
Noticing that Isabelle looked really down, Robert realized he had probably said too much. He cleared his throat a bit and went quiet.
Honestly, she didn't need him to say anything more. She could see it all too clearly.
Matteo cared about Brianna way more than he ever did about her back in the day. Maybe those late-night date photos snapped by the paparazzi already gave that away.
The rest of the trip was silent.
Isabelle sat at the foot of her parents' tombstone, leaning against it for a long time as tears quietly fell onto the stone surface.
""Only six days left..."" she whispered softly. ""Mom, Dad, can you please wait for me? When I get back, you'll be okay.""
When she got back to the villa from the cemetery and opened the door, Brianna rushed over to greet her right away.
""Belle! The doctor prescribed me some herbal medicine. Why don't you join me?""
Then she dropped her smile and said slowly, ""After all, you're pregnant too.""
Isabelle suddenly looked up, her eyes locking onto the hostility in Brianna's stare.
How could she possibly know?
A wave of nausea hit Isabelle hard; she quickly covered her mouth and dashed to the bathroom, bending over to throw up as tears streamed down her face.
Afterward, she splashed cold water on her face to calm herself.
When she stepped out, Brianna had already switched to a concerned look.
""Are you okay? I can ask the kitchen to whip something up for you. We can't let your baby go hungry.""
Before Isabelle could say anything, Matteo swung the door open and walked in right then.
Brianna turned around with a grin.
""I told you Belle is pregnant. You lost the bet! So as punishment, you can't tell our baby a story tonight.""
When he heard that, Matteo suddenly looked at Isabelle, his dark eyes swirling with emotions.
""Are you really pregnant?""
Chapter 4
Isabelle was taken aback for a moment.
How could they even bet on whether she was pregnant?
Before she could say anything, Matteo stepped in and grabbed her wrist.
""Isabelle, you're really something else. Five years ago, you ran away from our wedding, and now you're back with another guy's kid. Are you expecting me to take responsibility for that?""
His tone was icy, and his eyes were full of sarcasm.
""You act all clueless, but did you really think I wouldn't have gotten married by now?
""I don't care what your game is coming back this time, but if you try to hurt Brianna or the baby she's carrying...""
Matteo paused, his expression darkening even more.
""I won't let you get away with it.""
Isabelle saw the distrust in his eyes and fought to hold back her tears.
""What if I tell you that he's your kid?""
The moment those words slipped out, Brianna's cup fell from her hand and smashed on the floor. Her eyes started turning red as she looked at Matteo.
Matteo quickly shook off Isabelle's hand, rushed over to Brianna in a few quick steps, and checked her over carefully.
""Did you hurt yourself anywhere?""
When she shook her head, he let out a sigh of relief and gently picked her up in his arms. The glance he shot at Isabelle was now icy cold.
""Have you lost your mind? It's been five years since we last saw each other. How could there be a kid between us? Or do you think I'm that easy to trick? Listen, if you ever try to mess with Brianna and me again, I won't go easy on you.""
Brianna buried her face in Matteo's neck, her voice tinged with frustration.
""Don't blame Belle. I get that she's desperate, which is why she said all that. I believe you.""
Hearing this, Matteo's eyes softened with warmth. He hugged her tightly and headed upstairs without a second thought.
Isabelle stood frozen in place, forcing a self-deprecating smile.
The maids rushed over to clean up the shattered glass, whispering among themselves.
""Can she really be out of her mind? Mr. and Mrs. Norkett have been married for years, and he's never spent a night away from home! No matter how busy work gets, he always comes back for meals with Mrs. Norkett. How could he possibly have a kid with someone else?""
""She must've watched too many soap operas or something! She got pregnant by some random guy and had the nerve to come here asking for money or whatever! Either she wants Mrs. Norkett's life or she's just after money.""
Neither of them came downstairs for dinner that night. The maids lined up, watching Isabelle as she ate.
Seeing her questioning gaze, one of the maids explained, ""Mr. Norkett is worried that Mrs. Norkett might get upset if she sees you. So starting today, he won't be having meals with you anymore.
""Also, to make sure you don't harm Mrs. Norkett or her baby, all food sent upstairs has to be checked by the family doctor. Plus, we'll need to keep a close eye on everything you do.""
Isabelle's fingertips pressed hard into her palm, and her throat felt dry and tight.
After a lot of struggle, she managed to finish the meal while being watched, then went back to her room and pulled out the time-travel plane ticket from under her pillow.
""Matteo,"" she whispered into the empty room, ""don't worry. In six days, I won't be bothering you anymore.""
In the middle of the night, an awful stomachache hit Isabelle all of a sudden.
The pain got worse by the second.
Worried about her baby's safety, she bit down on her lip, rolled off the bed, and tried to crawl to the living room.
Every move felt like her insides were being ripped apart.
""Help... please save my baby..."" Her weak plea echoed sharply in the quiet night.
Chapter 5
The maids heard the noise and all got up to see what was going on.
When they found her lying on the floor with a pale face, they rushed over.
""Ms. Darroch, what's wrong?""
""Go get... get Matteo..."" Isabelle grabbed onto one of the maid's pants, her breathing shaky.
The maid dashed upstairs but came back down in just a few minutes.
""Ms. Darroch, Mr. Norkett said, you need to stop pretending. He won't believe anything you say anymore.""
A sharp pain shot through Isabelle's heart, and even though she felt physical pain too, it was nothing compared to the sting of disappointment.
Then she remembered the asparagus in the soup at dinner.
Every time she ate asparagus, it made her stomach hurt. A long time ago, Matteo had told the maids to keep it away from her. But now Brianna was running things. Nobody knew about her food issue anymore.
Isabelle was breathing heavily and asked the maid, ""Could you please... get me a glass of warm water? Thanks.""
The maid paused for a second, but then poured her a glass of warm water and handed it over.
Isabelle took small sips. As the warm water went down, she felt her stomach pain ease up just a bit.
She leaned back against the couch, trying to hold on until dawn.
Her sweat-soaked clothes eventually dried from her body heat as the pain slowly faded.
Her face looked very haggard, and her legs felt weak and wobbly. But she was really worried about the baby, so she decided to head to the hospital by herself.
Just as she got to the entrance hall, Matteo came slowly down from upstairs with an icy tone.
""Where are you going?""
""I'm going to the hospital,"" Isabelle replied softly.
But Matteo scoffed. ""Do you really care that much about that man's child you're carrying?""
He paused for a moment, then asked again, ""Who is that guy?
""You ditched our wedding for him, and now you're back to confront me with his kid. Does he even know about any of this?""
The sadness and hurt in Isabelle slowly faded away. She turned around and looked Matteo straight in the eye.
""Since you've never believed me from the beginning, my life is none of your business.""
Matteo's face darkened right away.
He stepped closer, grabbed Isabelle's arm, and questioned her while trying to hold back his anger.
""None of my business? Isabelle, who do you think you are to say that?
""We were together for eight years! But you vanished without a word the day before our wedding. Did you ever give me an explanation during these five years? Did it ever cross your mind to feel even a little guilty toward me?
""Not only did you not care at all, but then out of nowhere, you showed up to mess with our lives when Brianna and I were finally doing okay!""
Isabelle's eyes were getting red from all his questions.
She yanked her hand out of his grip with everything she had and took a step back to create some space.
""I did explain. It's you who wouldn't believe me.
""Yeah, I got on that plane. But have you ever thought about it? If the paparazzi hadn't sent me those photos of you and Brianna on that late-night date, would I have left in such a rage? Would I really have ended up five years in the future without even knowing my own parents were gone?
""I was about to marry you! It was Brianna who jumped into our relationship first. But now I'm the one being called the homewrecker!
""You're the one who betrayed me first!""
Matteo looked into Isabelle's angry eyes, and for a moment, he felt a flicker of doubt.
But then, out of nowhere, a scream echoed from the staircase.
Matteo quickly turned around and saw Brianna tumbling down the steps from the second floor.
In that instant, all his doubts vanished. He rushed forward in panic and scooped her up into his arms.
""Anna! Are you okay? Did you hurt yourself?""
Brianna leaned against him, tears filling her eyes almost immediately.
""I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to listen in on your talk...
""It's my fault, really. I'm the one who messed things up between you two. I'm the real homewrecker.""
Her hand slowly moved to her lower belly as she sobbed uncontrollably.
""This baby... it shouldn't have happened either...""
""No way, that's not true at all."" Matteo was so flustered that he stumbled over his words.
""I'll take you to the hospital. I won't let anything happen to you or the baby.""
As he rushed past her, his arm bumped hard against Isabelle's shoulder.
Isabelle held onto the entrance cabinet tightly to keep from falling. She had never seen Matteo look this panicked before.
Watching Matteo hurry away, the light in Isabelle's eyes slowly faded.
Chapter 6
Isabelle still went to the hospital.
It wasn't until she heard the doctor say her baby was safe and sound that she finally let out a sigh of relief.
As she walked out of the consultation room, she noticed every pregnant woman had her husband by her side.
The doctor's words kept ringing in her ears.
""You look really pale. It's totally normal to have mood swings during pregnancy, but your situation... seems like it could be prenatal depression. Where's the baby's dad?
""His presence is very important at this stage. Make sure he spends more time with you, just chatting or going for walks together...""
Isabelle took a deep breath, trying hard not to look so lonely. But just then, she felt a little flutter from the baby.
""Little one, you want daddy around too?"" she whispered softly.
Suddenly, Matteo's words to her while they were lying in bed came rushing back.
""A daughter who is just like you would be great.
""And a son would be awesome too. As long as you're the one bringing them into this world, I'll love them all.""
But now it seemed the only child he cared about was Brianna's, right?
Just then, two nurses walked by Isabelle. Their voices were just right—not too loud, not too soft—and she caught bits of their chat.
""Hey, isn't that the woman from the photo? She ditched her wedding back then, and now she's pregnant and coming back to ask her ex-fiancé for help. How shameless.""
""It totally is her. Check out that mole at the corner of her eye; it matches perfectly. Didn't you hear? She disappeared without a word to avoid getting married, and while her parents were out looking for her... they got into an accident and died on the spot.""
""No way! Oh my god, so she's basically the murderer who killed her own parents?""
The word ""murderer"" hit Isabelle like a punch to the gut.
She quickly pulled out her phone, and sure enough, there was a trending topic with her name blowing up.
""Only Daughter of the Darroch Family Runs Away from Wedding, Returns Five Years Later Pregnant and Seeking Ex-Fiancé's Help""
Right after that came her photos.
Comments were pouring in nonstop, and the flood of insults almost drowned her.
""What an ungrateful loser! How does someone like her even deserve to be alive?""
""Seriously, what could be so important that she'd ditch the parents who raised her for decades?""
""Mr. Norkett is really innocent to have gone through this mess. He was with a woman like her for eight years! Now that he's happily married to someone else, she must be so jealous. How dare she show up at his door again?""
Isabelle struggled to keep it together as she dialed Matteo's number.
The first post had come from a media outlet linked to the Norkett Group. There was no way they would've known about her pregnancy without his say-so!
As soon as the call connected, she asked in a shaky voice, ""Why?""
Matteo's voice came through cold and sharp. ""Listen, if you try to hurt Anna, I won't let you get away with it.
""You'd better hope nothing happens to Anna or the baby. If it does, you won't like what comes next.""
Then the call ended suddenly, leaving just the annoying beep of a busy line.
Isabelle knew that when Matteo was angry, he would go all out.
Once at a company dinner, a business partner had forced her to down a shot of vodka. Matteo didn't think twice about paying a huge penalty and medical bills just to break that guy's hand.
But now, the person he was ready to fight for no matter what was Brianna.
Rain had started falling at some point, though Isabelle couldn't tell when.
She walked in the rain for a long time, each step taking her closer to her parents' gravestone.
Looking at the small black-and-white photo on the stone, she knelt down heavily on both knees.
""I'm so sorry, Mom, Dad. It's all my fault you're gone.""
Fear began to creep in—fear that even if she made it back to 2020 in five days, she still wouldn't be able to stop her parents' car accident.
And an even bigger fear that if Brianna lost her baby, Matteo would take his anger out on her and keep her from catching that flight on time.
If that happened, she'd never get back. Her parents' deaths would become something she could never change.
""I don't want anything anymore. His love, his care, who he goes out with late at night... I don't care about any of it. I just want you both to be alive.""
Isabelle whispered into the pouring rain as thunder rumbled around her.
Chapter 7
The next day, Isabelle was all set to leave with her plane ticket when a maid stepped in her path.
""Sorry, Ms. Darroch. Mr. Norkett said you can't leave until Mrs. Norkett wakes up.""
With no other options, she decided to head over to the hospital and brought along a pot of soup she had made herself.
At the door of the ward, another bodyguard stopped her again.
""Sorry, Ms. Darroch. It was difficult saving Mrs. Norkett's baby, so we can't let you disturb her again.""
Through the glass on the ward door, she caught sight of Brianna lying there looking pale as ever.
It was obvious Matteo hadn't slept at all as his eyes were filled with worry.
Hearing some noise at the door, he frowned and stepped out.
As soon as he saw Isabelle, his face darkened. ""What are you doing here?""
Isabelle held up the thermos. ""I just wanted to apologize.""
Matteo was struggling to keep his cool. ""That's enough. I'm not giving you any more chances to hurt Anna...""
Before he could finish, Brianna's weak voice came from inside the room.
""Is that Belle? Let her in.""
A flicker of surprise crossed Matteo's face, and he had no choice but to step aside.
Isabelle walked into the room, trying hard to sound gentle.
""I'm really sorry. I shouldn't have said those things the other day, and I shouldn't have barged in on your lives like this.""
As she spoke, she reached for the thermos lid, but Matteo grabbed her wrist.
""What are you up to now?""
Brianna gently stopped him. ""I really don't think Belle would hurt me. Plus, I'm actually a bit hungry.
""Honey, could you step out for a minute? I want to talk with Belle alone.""
Matteo had no choice but to turn and walk away.
Isabelle held back her frustration and personally fed the woman who took her husband.
Brianna sipped the soup slowly, and a sly smile suddenly appeared on her face.
""What if I pretend to have a stomachache right now? Do you think Matteo would believe you put something in this soup?
""Five years ago, I got the paparazzi to snap those photos and send them your way. I knew you'd storm off in anger, and guess what? I was right.
""Don't you want to know what really happened that night?""
""It doesn't matter anymore.""
Isabelle took the spoon back, looked up with a calm face, and said, ""I'm leaving. I hope you and Matteo have a long and happy life together.""
""Too late for that.""
Brianna's smile vanished. ""You said you shouldn't have messed with our lives, but here we are. You were gone for five years while I worked my butt off to become more important to him. But the second you show up, he wants to take you home. Why is that? I'm his wife! I'm supposed to be the woman of this family!""
""He said it was just because of the friendship between our families...""
""Doesn't matter what the reason is. It's not happening!"" Brianna's emotions flared up. ""I won't let you get close to him, and I definitely won't let you take him away just because of your eight-year relationship!""
With a quick swipe of her hand, she knocked over the water cup on the bedside table.
Hot water splashed onto Isabelle's arm, quickly leaving a big red burn mark. The stinging pain made Isabelle gasp without thinking.
Matteo heard the noise and pushed the door open.
When he saw the wound on Isabelle's arm, a flicker of concern crossed his face.
Brianna spoke up, sounding upset, ""I didn't remind Belle that the water cup was super hot in time...""
Matteo quickly tried to reassure her, ""It's not your fault. Did you get burned?""
He didn't even look at Isabelle; he just coldly told her to leave.
""Get out. Don't try to act all pitiful. Your pain doesn't matter to me at all.""
Isabelle held her arm and slowly turned away.
So this was how deeply he could care for someone, enough to buy into such a clumsy excuse.
In that moment, all her hopes and hesitations completely faded away.
As soon as she stepped outside, Isabelle didn't notice that the plane ticket in her pocket had slipped out onto the ground.
Seeing it fall, the bodyguard picked it up and said, ""Ms. Darroch, here's your plane ticket.""
At this point, Matteo suddenly turned around when he heard this, asking sharply, ""What plane ticket?""
Chapter 8
Isabelle didn't care that moving around would tug at her wound. She reached out, grabbed the plane ticket back, and hugged it close.
""It's not a plane ticket. He got it wrong.""
Matteo's eyes landed on Isabelle's arm. Because of her quick movement, the wound had opened up again and was starting to bleed.
He frowned, his impatience clear. ""Get her to the treatment room to take care of that wound.""
Matteo watched as she walked away with the bodyguard. Fresh blood dripped from her fingers onto the floor, and suddenly, he felt a wave of emotion wash over him.
After getting her wound taken care of, Isabelle headed straight to the Obstetrics and Gynecology Department.
She walked confidently into the consultation room.
""Doctor, I want to end this pregnancy—as soon as possible.""
The doctor explained that since she was only a few weeks along, she could take some medication if she was sure about her decision.
Isabelle nodded calmly without any second thoughts.
Back at the villa, she sat on the edge of her bed and swallowed the pill without hesitation.
In her dream, she saw Brianna stab a dagger into her stomach. The pain was sharp and overwhelming. She fought desperately but only felt herself sinking into a pool of bright red.
Then she noticed a huge hand reaching down from the darkness toward her...
It was Matteo.
He yanked her off the bed in anger. ""Didn't I warn you? Or do you simply not care what happens next?""
Isabelle blinked hard to clear her blurry vision, finally able to see what was on the phone that Matteo was holding up in front of her.
""Matt, by the time you read this, I'll already be gone. Belle told me she's lost her parents and can't bear to lose you too. Even though it breaks my heart to leave, she said that if I don't go, our baby won't make it safely. I'm really thankful for the five years we've had together, but now it's time for me to hand you back over to Belle.""
""I never said that...""
""Then why would she choose to leave when her pregnancy is so shaky?""
Matteo pressed his palm against Isabelle's wound without thinking, applying pressure.
Fresh blood quickly soaked through the gauze and spread into a dark red stain.
Isabelle let out a sharp hiss from the pain, but she stubbornly kept looking him in the eye.
""I really didn't.""
Matteo just wouldn't buy it. He was sure she had made Brianna leave.
What he didn't notice, though, was the bright red spreading between Isabelle's legs. That was their kid, too.
He pulled her into the basement, his teeth gritted as he said, ""You're not going anywhere until I find Anna! If anything happens to her, you'll regret it.
""Someone get her water and food on time and no electricity!""
Isabelle was really struggling with her claustrophobia. The fear hit her hard, and she couldn't help but burst into tears.
""No... Please don't!""
But the door still slammed shut with a loud bang. The tight space made it hard for her to breathe.
The cramping pain and the wetness from below left her hunched over, unable to stand up straight.
She craned her neck to catch a breath while dealing with the sharp pain in her lower belly.
She knew deep down the baby was slipping away from her bit by bit through the pain.
Matteo knew exactly how much she struggled with being in small spaces, yet he still chose to punish her like this.
Isabelle never thought he could love Brianna this much.
It felt like something was choking her, wrapping around her throat like a vine. She kept pinching the wound on her arm, using the pain to stay awake and not pass out.
Over and over in her mind, she prayed that Matteo would find Brianna soon. Only then would he let her go early.
She couldn't afford to miss the flight in three days.
On the first day, Matteo didn't show up. Every breath she took felt like a million thorns stabbing into her chest.
On the second day, still no sign of him. Uncontrollable visions of suffocation started dancing before her eyes.
By the third day, time was running out for that plane ticket. She pounded on the door, begging to be let out.
Just when she thought she couldn't take it anymore, the basement door swung wide open.
The light hit her eyes hard, but she didn't care about anything else. She stumbled forward and rushed out.
She heard the maids whispering behind her.
Actually, Matteo had found Brianna on the first day. But he totally forgot to let her out.
Feeling dizzy, Isabelle stumbled and hit her head, making it bleed. But she didn't dare stop. She kept running down the road.
She fell right in front of a taxi and then rushed to the airport.
When she got to the airport, Isabelle shoved all the cash she had into the driver's hand and sprinted toward the terminal building.
Only when the wings folded back and the plane began to move along the runway did her tense body finally relax.
Leaning against the window, Isabelle looked out at the endless sea of white clouds ahead of her as tears quietly rolled down her cheeks.
In just a few hours, she'd be back in 2020.
This time, she promised herself she'd never again gamble her parents' lives on a single photo.
Isabelle closed her eyes and whispered in her heart, ""Dad, Mom, wait for me.""
The plane flew into thick fog.
A sudden wave of dizziness hit Isabelle again, so she shut her eyes and drifted off to sleep.

She’s never been the type to chase the spotlight. Red carpets, curated stories, flashing cameras—none of that was ever her. She’s the girl behind the scenes: the one who brings him coffee after eighteen-hour days in the studio, the one who tucks love notes into his bags before he flies across the world, the one who stays silent when the tabloids pair him with someone else yet again. She’s known him longer than the world has—before the fame, the tours, the ego. And somewhere along the way, she fell in love with the boy he used to be when no one else was watching.

But somewhere along the way, she became invisible.

The story begins on her birthday—a regular Tuesday for him. She doesn’t expect much; she never has. Just a few hours, maybe a walk, maybe a movie on the couch like they used to do before his phone never stopped buzzing. She doesn’t say it outright. She never demands. She just smiles, quiet as ever, and suggests, *“Maybe when you’re done at the studio… we could just do something. Anything, really.”* But he brushes her off, distracted, already halfway out the door.

She doesn’t cry—not at first. She just sits in the quiet, one hand resting on her belly—a new secret, just starting to show. A life growing inside her. His child. And she wonders if he’ll even notice when she’s gone. Because she’s not angry—just tired. Tired of being a second thought in a world she never wanted to compete with. Tired of giving everything and getting almost nothing in return.

**What I’m Looking For:**  
I’m searching for someone to write the role of the celebrity in this emotional, slow-burn story about love, and neglect.. Your character could be a musician, actor, influencer—whatever feels right. The key is that he’s lost in his own world, too caught up in the demands of his fame to see how much he’s hurting the only person who’s never wanted anything from him but love.

1pa7k0e,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheImprovementRoom/comments/1pa7k0e/i_meditated_every_day_for_6_months_and_it/,I meditated every day for 6 months and it completely changed my baseline anxiety,"Six months ago, I was the person who rolled their eyes at meditation. Thought it was some hippie nonsense that wouldn't work for someone with a brain like mine - always racing, always planning, always catastrophizing about things that hadn't happened yet.

My anxiety had gotten bad enough that I'd wake up at 3 AM with my heart pounding over nothing specific. Just... dread. My doctor suggested meditation before medication, and I figured I'd try it just to prove it wouldn't work.

Started with 5 minutes. Just sitting there, trying to focus on breathing, failing constantly, thoughts everywhere. Felt stupid. Felt like I was doing it wrong. Almost quit after week one.

But something weird happened around day 12. I noticed a gap. Just a tiny moment between something annoying happening (spilled coffee) and my reaction to it. Normally I'd spiral immediately into ""I'm so clumsy, this day is ruined, everything's falling apart."" This time, there was a second where I just... noticed I'd spilled coffee. Then chose how to react.

That gap got bigger. By month two, I could sit with uncomfortable feelings without immediately trying to fix, avoid, or panic about them. By month three, my baseline anxiety had dropped noticeably - not gone, but manageable. By month six, I realized I hadn't woken up with that 3 AM dread in weeks.

The benefits weren't what I expected:

* I sleep through the night now. My brain actually shuts off.
* I can sit through discomfort without immediately reaching for my phone or snacks.
* Conversations improved because I'm actually listening instead of planning what to say next.
* I make better decisions because I can pause before reacting.
* The constant background noise in my head got quieter.

I'm not zen. I still get anxious. But there's space now between the trigger and the spiral. That space is everything.

If you're skeptical like I was, just try 5 minutes for 2 weeks. Use an app if you need guidance (I used Insight Timer). Don't judge whether you're ""doing it right."" Just sit there and breathe and notice when your mind wanders. That's literally the practice.

My only regret is not starting sooner.",4,1764471905.0,TheImprovementRoom,2,0.84,False

1pa7iyq,https://i.redd.it/fz0mh48n8b4g1.jpeg,A Mythic Meditation on Lucy - part 2,"More than 3 million years ago, God watched Lucy move among her cousins and the sprawling clan, her gestures weaving invisible threads through their laughter and quarrels. They were only primates, he reminded himself, fragile creatures bound by instinct and blood. Yet each time her voice softened or her eyes lingered with care, his detachment faltered. Fascination, unexpected, unbidden, grew within him, as though her presence carried a gravity that even divinity could not ignore.

He told himself the story he always liked best: that he stood outside the story. He could peer through the filaments of time as if they were strands of dew and silk, study their knotting and release, and remain unknotted himself. They were primates, pliant, patterned, calcium and carbon marching beneath soft flesh. Lucy’s laughter moved through them like heat through a room, and he watched the way their shoulders unlocked, the way old arguments thinned, the way the smallest child dared to enter the circle because she did. The mechanism was clear. The affection was an instrument.

He had cataloged this before. Proximity yields conflation, conflation yields error. Maintain the postulate: they are a set; I am an observer of sets. Do not admire. Do not confuse pattern with worth. Do not grant significance where habit wants to crown it. Yet he took note, and then another, and then he found some notes were not notes but a pause that did not belong to any ledger, a kind of listening that reached beyond measurement. Lucy tucked a stray curl behind her ear and bent toward a cousin’s fragile confession, and in the slight shift of her face, a tightening around the eyes, a gentling of the mouth, he recognized a thing he did not have a word for that fit inside superiority like a seed inside a stone.

He named what he could. The cousin’s wrist turned as if wanting to be empty of its own wrist; grief. The aunt’s throat worked around unspoken apologies; inheritance. The grandfather’s silence that insisted on being a roof; lineage. Lucy placed her hand, just two fingers, on the table, the simplest claim: I will not leave. He admired the engineering: minimal input, maximal stability. He admired the evolved economy of tenderness, the way it asked nothing of the cosmos and still rearranged the room.

Dominance, when well guarded, asks for a certain thinness of blood. It favors charts over heat. It does not blink, does not hurry, does not liquefy. He had never liquefied. He was, if anything, the dissolver. Yet some dissolvers learn, once spilled, there is a weave they cannot break. Her name was a note they spoke for her; he spoke no names. Still, he caught the note Lucy, how it collected, how it rose, how the smallest boy voiced it with a hope borrowed from coming days, and something in his choice to stay outside turned into entry at last for him.

He tested the theory: if I pay attention without mercy, will my caution survive? He watched Lucy’s patience with the cousin who always told stories badly, who buried the endings beneath too many beginnings. She did not correct him. She did something else: she waited for the shapeless to find a shape. He noticed how waiting is a form of faith that does not require belief, only breath. He noticed how breath, once shared, makes a table into a shelter. He had designed shelters. He had never eaten inside one.

They say primates groom to bond. They say it’s biochemical; they say it’s ancestral. He had no quarrel with such things; he could trace oxytocin through a maze of synapses like a river through a plain. But there was another river, unmeasured, that moved when Lucy met another gaze and did not turn away. It wasn’t grooming. It wasn’t language. It was choosing, again and again, to hold the ordinary until it revealed the extraordinary hiding inside it like a moth inside a folded sleeve. He did not think the moth should matter. He found that it did.

Fascination is a word for what happens when distance wants to be intimate but cannot admit it. He refined the edges of his interest: it is not her face, not her voice, not her lineage. It is her fidelity to small things. It is the way she treats forgetfulness like a shrine, how she remembers the names of the quiet ones, remembers who prefers tea to coffee, who cannot bear bright light after a headache. He had created suns. He had never turned one down for someone’s sensitive eyes.

Superiority is a mountain that believes it is the horizon. It is addicted to overview, convinced its height is the same as truth. He knew this; he had taught himself this. Yet overview never feels the tremor when laughter reaches the one who thought they were unworthy of being reached. He watched the tremor, the tiny near-invisible earthquake as the cousin’s shame loosened. He thought: this is not a mountain; this is a door. His certainty disliked doors. Doors imply thresholds, and thresholds imply passage, and passage implies change.

He reasoned: if what she does is merely a pattern, I can reproduce it anywhere. Build a room, insert a Lucy, insert a clan, watch the recalibration of hurts. But he suspected that replication would miss the soul of the thing, the way she knows when to be a witness and when to be a bridge, when to be the candle and when to be the table it sits upon. He didn’t believe in souls the way they did. He believed in consequence. Still, when she pressed her forehead to her grandmother’s temple for exactly one breath and then pulled back, he observed a consequence that defied his favorite equations: grief became shareable and therefore survivable.

He will not call them more than primates. He will not kneel. He will not offer a hymn. But he allows himself one sentence that dislodges an old certainty by a fraction: I do not know everything about what makes them inevitable to each other. He understands gravity, he understands entropy, he understands time. He does not understand why Lucy’s presence turns a meal into a memory that refuses to fade, why it stamps the afternoon with a seal they will hold in their pockets when winter comes and the phone won’t ring and the city is unkind. He only understands that his fascination is not a failure of discipline; it is a sign that the thing he has been watching deserves more than watching.

He does not enter. He stands outside the window with his impeccable abstractions. But he permits tenderness a seat beside him, not inside him, not yet, and he practices a new form of observation, one that does not reduce, one that does not strip, one that does not amputate wonder for the sake of neatness. He will not name it reverence. He will call it precision’s sibling: attention that honors what cannot be measured without pretending it is less because it resists the ruler.

If superiority is a map, fascination is the rumor of a road that was not drawn. He looks at Lucy and the clan, their unspectacular, golden, irrational cohesion, and imagines tracing that road, not to diminish what makes it tender, but to learn what makes it endure. He imagines, for the first time, a threshold where the observer and the observed are not enemies. He imagines a room where he does not need to be a mountain to be true. He imagines, quietly, the possibility that godhood is not distance but depth.

He does not decide. He watches her offer the last slice of fruit to the cousin who pretends he isn’t hungry. He notes the smallest smile. He alters nothing. And still, something alters him.

1pa7esc,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1pa7esc/time_to_quit/,Time to quit,"Hi everyone,

I'm currently 3 weeks sober. It’s been a really tough three weeks and I've struggled fighting quite a lot of deamons during that time but think I am finally through the worst of it.

I have no intention of ever drinking and taking any mind altering substance (apart from coffee) again. Yesterday I got rid of all the booze in the house (excluding my husbands Murphies because I cannot stand the stuff so it's never been a temptation). 

I started drinking at age 12 it got much worse in my teens following a few instances from 13 onwards (weirdly non of that came up at all which makes me think its processed and I need to stop dwelling on it). It's been the cause of decades of pain, decietfulness and avoidance. Recently it had become completely out of control and I hated myself so much when I was sober. I'd also turned that hate onto others, not becuase I do actually hate others but because I love people deeply (perhaps too much) and was so scared of the constant rejection I faced (because of my drinking and unprocessed stuff). 

My mood has been really up and down but I think that it will even out now that I have properly commited to sober living. I have/had many infact bacially only have sober friends. Really the drinking doesnt fit my relationships with the people that I love at all. 

I'm going to start this new path with a cleanse of both my body and the house. Yesterday I spent so much more time with the kids than I have have in months and did stuff with my mum too. I still got lost in it a bit again but I don't think that will happen now I'm more aware of what is going on.

It's strange how much more positivity and gentleness I have with myself now and how that has immediately transferred into gentleness for my family. 

I'm so incredibly lucky to have the friends and family I have left and I know with time I'll be able to be of service to others again.

I'm going to focus my time on repairing things with family first (those who will allow it) and then friends. There's also some much bigger bits of repair work I need to do in the fiture but need to also learn to approach these with the grace and time they need. I'm all of nothing with accountability and balance and boundaries are important.

I'm also planning on living with my mum for a bit to give my partner some space. Her housemate is moving out in a few days so I will move in when that happens. I hope we can reconcile but given the years of shit he has put up with I don't know if its possible. 

Yesterday I was still really confused about the experience and reached out to people I shouldn't have. (I believed I needed to make a fool of myself on the internet and become the villian to stop an assasination of the Green Party leader.) I have a huge problem processing and storing information which is probably why this turned into such a huge process. Decades of drinking has left me quite disabled I think. Just not in the way I thought. I need others to help me process at the moment and want to take a step away from my phone and focus on reading material and community so I don't keep crashing into places. I'm going to message them tomorrow and apologise. I'd also like to post a wider apology on Tiktok and start to think about financial reperation with the savings I have atm. 

A key reflection I've had from this journey is how I've turned every experience into a moment of fear and not curiosity. I'm so scared of the world, of loosing people and of my place in it not being tolerated. I want so deeply to belong and be of service to others but my fear, guilt and shame had completely taken over me. I allowed my shadow self to consume my lightness almost entirely. It’s time to nurture that back to health and to just exist in the world for the moment cracking a few jokes with those who will still have me! 

What I think is most interesting about my trauma. The stuff that really had seeped into my bones. It wasn't the things that happened to me, I dont think that's actually effecting me at all. But my worries about stuff that I have done to others, might have done to others  OR might do to others in the future (that I havn't actually done nor would ever do becuase I'm not a monster). If my actual trauma is the constant worry that I have or will hurt people and a catastrophising of or minimising of those actions then I can't be terrible AND I need to find a way to balance that, to apologise, to stop catastrophising and to repair where I can. I HAVE hurt a lot of people but not addressing that doesn't fix anything and actually the guilt and remorse burns into my soul just like in Ringshout.

I need space to talk through my experience of being mixed-race in an all white environment (I'm no longer sure what term to use to describe myself following the boundaries set up ir what the boundaries were because I can't remember and of course didn't write it down) but wonder if the Black in an all white environment meet up group would be something I could still join to meet others who have had the same experience as me and can't fit in safely in Black spaces. 

I'm really lucky to have the 5 amazing parents I have in my life. Each showing up for me in different ways. Since coming into my life they have never left (even if they didnt like me all that much!). I want to start to support the elders in my life properly. It's time for the tables to turn there. 

I need to acknowledge that Ozempic may have accelerated my drinking and that I have very disordered eating. I was completely addicted to diet pills as a teenager, binge ate in my 20's, managed to maintain a decent weight in my 30's but now I can't really eat at all. I don’t seem to ever be hungry and whilst it doesnt matter what people look like it's been shocking to see the pictures of my eldest and I in comparison to now. 

There are work colleagues, many, but five most specifically that I need to do some repair work with (within boundaries of course). The mirror on my actual racial justice leanse has been soul destroying and I need to find a way to work through that safely. 

Once I've addressed all this I won't need to hide behind perofrmances I don't agree with or even hold the same values of. I'd rather sit with the shadows then pretend tk be an arsehole to make friends becuase *newsflash* that doesn't work. 

Finally, I'm sorry for talking so much. I had literally no idea what was going on.   

I think you saved my life and my kids lives too. I'm scared for what happens next but ready to face it. 

I will not drink with you today.

College educated, fluent in English, sarcasm, and the occasional bad pun. Big fan of Suits because nothing says thrilling drama like corporate loopholes and HGTV. In the kitchen, I cook, bake, and argue with my oven over who’s the real master chef.

I don’t drink or do drugs. Unless you count caffeine, in which case I’m basically a bean addict. My nightlife is less clubbing till 2 a.m. and more building pillow fort empires and bingeing Netflix until cliffhangers leave me emotionally bankrupt. Basically, I’m a homebody with a 5-star rating on Yelp for snacks.

I lean conservative. Not here to debate politics, just putting it out there in case that’s a dealbreaker. Better to find that out before we bond over banana bread and binge-watching.

About You

You’re in your 30s, educated, and steady in your career. Bonus points if you can use there, their, and they’re correctly without breaking a sweat. You can hold a conversation that’s more than “hey” (plot twist, you’re actually interesting). You send memes that perfectly capture life’s chaos because sometimes a GIF says more than a whole paragraph.

You don’t smoke, do drugs, drink heavily, have tattoos, piercings, or kids. I like my drama like my Netflix, available on demand, not in real life. You’re thoughtful, communicative, and remember the small things, like my coffee order or which side of the blanket I hog.

Ideally you live in the same country. Love letters are cute, but customs forms are not, and I’m not DHL Express. I don’t handle international returns.

    (Disclaimer: English is not my first language, so I asked my AI agent to help me write this post to make sure I don't sound weird. The code, however, is 100% human frustration and coffee).
    
    The Problem: I recently started learning to play the piano. I would go to YouTube to find tutorials for specific songs, but I had two problems:
    
    Two hours later, I would find myself watching cat videos or conspiracy theories because of the algorithm (doom-scrolling).
    
    I kept losing the exact timestamp where the teacher explained a specific chord or melody.
    
    The Solution: I built StudyTube. It effectively turns a single YouTube video into a focused study session. I take a tutorial URL, create a ""Topic"", and the app opens it in a distraction-free interface.
    
    The Tech Stack (For the builders): I decided to skip the React/Next.js hype to ship this fast.
    
    - Backend: Laravel 12.
    - Frontend: Blade templates + Alpine.js + Tailwind CSS v4. No complex SPA overhead.
    - Database Architecture: This is the cool part. I'm using a Multi-tenant SQLite approach.
      - Each user gets their own SQLite database file stored securely.
      - This keeps things lightweight and fast, perfect for my use case.
      - Laravel's built-in support for multiple database connections made this easier than I expected.
    
    The ""SaaS"" Challenge: I am a developer from Venezuela, which makes integrating Stripe or PayPal directly a nightmare (almost impossible). I built a workaround using Shopify Subscriptions but it's still work in progress, for now, I'm just looking for feedback.

I'm the one getting yelled at for scaring people who can feel pvcs, because I'm the lucky fella who gets R on T'd and goes straight into SCA. Its been a long couple of weeks, and I just need to vent. If youre familiar with my particular situation, please keep it to yourself. If youre not, all you need to know is this: I had an event back back in 2021 which involved about 20(ish) cardiac arrests 3 days after, and since then Ive had a few more.

Now to the venting:

Back in October I had arrests #25-36, then a month later I had #37, then the following week (last week) I had SCA #38. Ive been having a very high PVC burden since September, after almost 3 years without a SCA and now I'm back in the trenches getting my ass whooped.  

The real kicker is that I had tons of NSVT, VT, couplets etc starting on sunday this week, and then the second (tuesday) my ICD cardioverts my SCA they stop. My EP scheduled a Ventricular ablation for Wednesday after my arrest, and it is like I have never even had a cup of coffee. Its smooth seas and dead sails. They had me hooked in for over an hour and half trying to get one to go, and nothing. Zilch. Eventually they gave up trying to map and just went after the substrate (think shooting at noises in the dark) and called it.

I'm starting to see the silver lining.,"Today I want for electrolysis on my facial hair. So, as you can imagine, I have a LOT of hair of my face. 

I was very, very, painfully clockable. 

I went to the appointment, and the barrister at the coffee shop gendered me correctly... ""OK? .... That was a lucky guess"" I thought. 

After the appointment, I went for coffee (I need the Caffeine. My resting heart rate is ~50 bpm.) I asked where the toilets were, and they DIDN'T guide me to the gents. ""OK... This is getting weird."" I thought. 

On the way home, I was stood at a well lit bus stop, talking with a working class lad (blue collar). We got into a conversation about cannabis, because I have a prescription, and they were rolling a three skinner... So we talked. 

During the conversation I mentioned that I have the prescription because I'm an old woman with arthritis... And he didn't even blink. Bear in mind... I also don't voice train. (awaiting tonsillectomy. So CAN'T train). But... Not a blink. Note about me: I used to work in a casino as a croupier (dealer). I've been trained to spot cheats, and bluffs, and micro expressions, and the micro reactions... But there was nothing from this guy other than recognition of me for who I REALLY am!

we continued to talk for a while, and when he got on his buss, he simply said ""you have a safe journey darling, and have a good night."" 

The guy didn't treat me like a man. He treated me like a human being, and the woman that I am. Even with a big face of hair! 

I think the world is healing? It's getting better. It'll take a few years. But... just like a broken bone... It will heal stronger! 

Have faith. We'll get there.

Survive out of spite, and you'll get to dance on their graves!

They rev their engines and people line the exits and cheer them on.  The event ends at 10am.
Now they are not allowed to do this because of the open air roof of Mote.  Claiming the animals may be disturbed. 
If this is true, those animals should be terrified of the fireworks every Saturday night right next to the open roof. Let alone the sky lighting up from 9:15 to 9:30pm
If the ""Powers that Be"" do not want the cars reving, just say so.  Stop blaming Mote.

The reviews seem good and I haven't seen any real red flags. The only question I have is that we like our coffee, hot, some machines result in lukewarm coffee any thoughts on the K8 t temperature for Americanos and black coffee. Thanks.

I love third places (places you can just go and meet people IRL with a good vibe for good convos, activity partners or flirty friends), great coffee, regionally specific businesses/cuisine, farm to table places, offroading, hiking, racing/drifting, kayaking/canoeing, etc. 

  
I also don't mind driving up to 1.5 hours for something interesting and I have an espresso machine I can pack if things are dire 😅

1pa6uy6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pa6uy6,Too tired to cook today — so this was my Korean breakfast.,"I chopped half a cabbage yesterday and had a pretty big breakfast, so today I kept it simple — just a banana and a cup of Maxim Supreme Gold mix coffee.

(It’s not the usual Maxim Mocha Gold that most people know. Supreme Gold is the upgraded version — slightly pricier, but richer and creamier, almost like a café latte.)



I bought the cabbage and bananas together on discount the other day, so I’ve been eating both over the past couple of days.

Yesterday was the big cabbage bowl morning, and today felt like the right day to reset with something light.
