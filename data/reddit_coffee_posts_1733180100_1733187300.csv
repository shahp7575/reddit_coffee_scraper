Never had the chance to go to you. 

I want to make a gift of a gift card for a local Houston Coffee shop. This is a work gift, and not really appropriate for me to ask them what part of Houston they live in. 

What would be a good call that isn't Starbucks? Perhaps a coffee shop that has a few different locations? 

Also, I'd be sending it online, so would have to be that possibility. 

Thanks in advance. ",1,1733186974.0,houston,1,1.0,False

I (30s M) I had a good friend (30s F) from 5th grade through highschool that I was pretty close with. I for sure had a crush/feelings for her for a while. In middle school she moved away and we would talk on the phone for hours a week, sometimes hours at a time. I found out around the time she moved that she liked me as well. She eventually moved back and we stayed close through highschool but I never acted on my feelings and she was never single for very long.

I have not been good about keeping in touch with old friends. To the point that I do not talk to anyone from my highschool years.

Over the thanksgiving holiday her name happened to get brought up in a conversation where I found out that her husband cheated and got another girl pregnant. I was told she is or has gone through with divorcing her husband. I am also going through a divorce at the moment (should be finalized by end of 2024).

Even though I haven't talked to her in 10+ years I have a strong desire to reach out and ask if she would want get coffee, drink, or dinner and catch up. I have zero expectations if she actually agreed to that, but I feel kinda sleezy for asking in general. If I didn't find out she was getting divorced I probably wouldn't reach out (mostly due to old feelings and it's already been a long time since we talked last).

It is very strange that at minimum level you are not getting an espresso, considering that for us Italians the central level is very good to make an espresso
However there is no possibility to tighten more

The grinder is not removable, therefore it cannot be washed

1h5auuz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Figs/comments/1h5auuz/black_genoa_fig_tree_not_doing_anything/,Black Genoa fig tree not doing anything ,"This is my very first fig tree, and I've always wanted one badly, so I did my research and thought I knew my stuff. It was a hardwood cutting gifted to me, when I got it, it did have a fair amount of fine brown roots. This was about 3 months ago

I planted it in a big pot with fruit and citrus soil, bit of premium potting mix, blood and bone, every so often sprinkled used coffee grinds on the surface. I haven't been otherwise watering it.

When I first planted it, we had rain everyday so I actually thought it would get stem rot. Then we've had a heatwave with the odd storm/a few days of heavy rain.

It's maintained the same appearance the whole time - 4 large leaves - two growth buds at the crown, one near soil level. Only difference is one of the leaves has started yellowing.

It's been out in a full sun position the whole time

I've been checking on it because I wondered if it had root/stem rot, and I noticed the soil did feel pretty compact (this would've been after the heavy rain), so I kind of fluffed it up a bit by digging through some of the layers and just crumbling it and letting it settle without packing it back down. That's when I noticed that it seems to have put down some fat white/green roots closer to the surface 

Could anyone please explain what's happening, if I've done anything wrong, and how to get it to grow/flourish?

like separate plans but they always seemed to forget but on a Friday and Saturday night would be out all the time. They don't even invite me anymore unless its their birthday and I'm at a loss. My inviting them round for dinner isn't good enough. Neither is a coffee date suggestion or a meal and bowling or a movie night. My partner works away so I be alone with the kids a lot I have amazing family support so I'm thankfully not completely on my own but I would be nice to have friends to do things with.

I only have retail experience so I wasn't really sure what to add. I shared with my family but they said it's too much about me and that the aspirations for a pottery business is to much. What are your opinions and what should I remove/ add. Also, does it sound too forced? Because I genuinely wrote it from a standpoint of genuine care and passion of wanting to become a barista. I am emailing both my resume and my cover letter to the manager. They did not explicitly post they were hiring but on there website it gives instructions on how to submit a resume and that they do appreciate skilled baristas, but are also willing to take anyone with a desire to learn. 
I am also going to visit them in person soon and possibly give them a physical copy of my resume, and plan to do this with multiple coffee shops in my area. I am a bit nervous to become a barista because I can be intimidated by new and different things but I want to venture out of retail.

Here is my cover letter:

As a recently avid lover of coffee, it would be a great joy to work for a small café to develop new skills as a barista. I was intrigues by Clement café not only for its lovely appeal and charm, but also in the fact that it is a small family run business. I am always drawn to small businesses because I aspire to have my own someday selling pottery. I have been working in retail for 3 years, and although I love my store and interacting with new people every day, I have been eager to find a position where I can work with my hands. I believe that obtaining barista knowledge will help to develop my current customer service skills, because it gives me the ability to be more connected to the products I sell since I am part of the creation.

My previous retail experience has helped me grow into developing a strong work ethic, ability to be a part of a team, and the communication skills necessary to help customers feel welcome and appreciated. I would love to combine these assets with the ability to create a wonderful coffee experience for customers.

Thank you for taking the time to read through my application. I am eager to learn as much as I can about coffee making and developing skills that help me feel connected to both my work and customers. Feel free to reach me at any time that is right for you and look forward to the possibility of working at your café.

Immediately after pulling out of the driveway, he started asking me a barrage of questions and I did not want to answer any of them to him. Here's a the notable ones:

Why don't you believe in the church? Why do you hate being around members of the church? (I told him I didn't want to go to BYU or SVU) What's stopping you from getting addicted to alcohol or weed when it's legal for you? How's you coffee and tea consumption? How do you know your reasons for leaving the church are valid?  Are you going to sleep around in college or are you going to keep your pecker in your pants? (Word for word on this one, I cannot believe he said this with a straight face) Have you tried porn and masturbation? (By far the worst question) How did it make you feel and when's the last time you saw it? And finally, Why do you not want to talk to me about any of this stuff?

Most of them I answered with ""I don't know"" just because I didn't want to tell him. I also avoided the last question to which he said, ""When you're out of the church, how are you going to treat your kids so they actually want to talk to them?"". He had tears in his eyes and I felt awful. He's literally just trying to understand me better and I won't let him. 

The reason why I didn't tell him anything I didn't have to (he literally made me give him an answer on some of these) is because I don't feel safe telling him without sparking an argument/fight. I also feel like he would treat me differently even though he made it clear that he loves me no matter what and wouldn't treat me differently for my different beliefs. I still don't feel safe telling him. I also don't want to tell him because they would trigger all sorts of follow-up questions that would be even worse than the ones he already asked me.

Towards the end of the drive, I managed to tell him that I don't want to talk about most of these things. He asked why and again, I didn't feel like I could tell him. He then talked more about sex in college and stuff and why I shouldn't do it. One of his brothers and one of his sisters had kids in college and when my aunt did it, he hardcore judged her and treated her different for years. When his brother did it he wasn't as tough for probably sexist reasons but idk for sure. 

He was extremely upset when I wouldn't tell him why and very nearly started crying right there. I apologized for making him upset and he wouldn't have it. ""If you were really sorry, you would actually tell me what you're feeling"". I just felt like a jerk and I still do. He's trying to be a better dad but in the process he's making me uncomfortable and I can't bring myself to tell him why and now he feels like a terrible father for making me feel like I can't tell him stuff. He's also in the bishopric and yesterday he cried while bearing his testimony after commencing the meeting. 

I really do not know what I can say to make him feel better. I think he forgave me but my mom had a discussion with me last night and told me that I really should at least give him a reason why. I would really appreciate some ideas, and thanks for listening. I'd also be happy to answer any other questions if y'all have any.

  
TLDR, Dad asked me a barrage of questions that I felt uncomfortable answering and when I told him that he got extremely upset and asked why. I didn't want to give him a reason but he's still very upset about it 3 days later. ",5,1733186107.0,exmormon,1,1.0,False

- Building is planned to be 291ft (89m) with 22 floors. 

- Expected completion is 2027, alongside with NJPAC Tower A. 

- Project has raised 96 million in construction loan, 46 million in private equity, and Aspire helped fill in the gaps with the 90 million tax credit award. 

- Developer is looking to get a tax pilot program from the city of Newark. 

- Developer hired a non profit organization from California called Housing Merit to provide social services to those living in the affordable units. They plan to have a location a block away from the building. 

- 20% of the building will be affordable meaning 80 affordable units with the rest being market rate. Building ranges from studio to 2 bed room apartments. 

- Part of the social services will be financial literacy, and programs to help residents get a job or a better paying job. 

- The first 4 floors are supposed to mimic the brownstone building on Fulton street. They decided to have an industrial type design instead of having it be a glass tower. 

- A planned walkway is supposed to be built in between 22 Fulton and the office building on broad that will connect to the light rail station. 

- Retail and commercial space is planned, with job fairs looking to hire local businesses. 

- So far they have contractors for concrete, and contractors to work on the facade. 

- Developer is also the developer behind 10 Park Place. 10 Park Place is planned to have 200 units and all 200 units will be 100 percent affordable. Developer also owns his own non profit organization based in Newark JFK center and Jersey City that teaches kids how to play basketball and coaches on how to be better coaches. 

- The goal for this project is to be part of Newark growth, this project won’t succeed if Newark doesn’t succeed. Once you have a good population of residents living in downtown Newark that can keep coffee shops open, among with other forms of stores and retail then people from the outer wards can be the icing on the cake.

1h5agki,https://www.reddit.com/r/approvedsupplements/comments/1h5agki/my_honest_review_of_all_day_slimming_tea_does_it/,My Honest Review of All Day Slimming Tea: Does It Really Work? 🤨,"When I first heard about All Day Slimming Tea, I was both curious and skeptical. The promise of shedding weight naturally while improving digestion and energy levels sounded almost too good to be true. But after trying countless methods to lose weight without much success, I decided to give it a shot. Here’s my honest experience with this herbal tea.

# Why I Chose All Day Slimming Tea

I’ve always been drawn to natural products. The idea of using something herbal, without harmful additives, was very appealing to me. All Day Slimming Tea promised a blend of vegan-friendly ingredients aimed at boosting metabolism, improving digestion, and detoxifying the body—all things I really needed on my weight loss journey.

[My Honest Review of All Day Slimming Tea](https://preview.redd.it/i1h58q4n2j4e1.jpg?width=529&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a07af6f198458b8151ce599e92ac5fcd31b5983a)

Plus, I was intrigued by the positive reviews I came across, with people sharing stories of improved energy levels, steady weight loss, and even better skin. I thought, “Why not give it a try?”

# My Experience with All Day Slimming Tea

When I first started using it, I didn’t expect immediate results. The tea has a pleasant, slightly spicy flavor, which I actually enjoyed. Drinking it became part of my morning and evening routines.

In the first week, I noticed a slight boost in energy. By the second week, I started seeing changes in my digestion—it felt smoother, and I didn’t experience the usual bloating after meals. By the end of the first month, I had lost about 5 pounds without making drastic changes to my diet or lifestyle!

What stood out to me the most was how natural the process felt. There were no harsh side effects, just a gentle improvement in my overall well-being.

# The Benefits I Noticed

1. **Weight Loss**: My weight started to drop steadily. It wasn’t dramatic, but it was consistent, and I felt healthier overall.
2. **Improved Digestion**: The bloating I used to experience after meals almost disappeared, which was a huge relief.
3. **Increased Energy**: I no longer needed that second cup of coffee to get through my day.
4. **Detox Effects**: My skin started looking clearer, which I think was a result of the detoxifying ingredients in the tea.

# Are There Any Downsides?

For me, the only downside was that I felt a bit nauseous when I drank the tea on an empty stomach. But once I started pairing it with a small snack, this issue completely disappeared.

It’s also worth noting that results vary from person to person. Some friends of mine who tried it didn’t see weight loss as quickly as I did, but they still noticed better digestion and more energy.

# Final Thoughts: Should You Try It?

If you’re looking for a natural, gentle way to support your weight loss journey, I genuinely recommend All Day Slimming Tea. It’s not a miracle solution—you still need to make healthy lifestyle choices—but it’s a fantastic tool to support your efforts.

What I loved most is how easy it was to incorporate into my daily routine. Plus, knowing that I’m using something natural and free from harmful chemicals gave me peace of mind.

- Pysillium husk - 10g
- Vitamin D3 - 1000IU
- Whey isolate - 30-60g
- Casein protein - before bed. 
- Folic acid - 400 mcg - (before I get any methylfolate recommendations, I know folic acid helped for my deficiency as blood test results were fine after supplementation, so I probably don't have that gene). 
- vitamin mk7 - 100 mcg - is mk4 really better? It's really expensive and hard to find in stock. 

5 days a week, 2 days off:

- Cacao powder - 10g - brand tests for heavy metals
- Saffron - 30 mg - Saffr'inside patent

Every other day:

- Wheatgrass powder - 10g

Several days a week:

- Cranberry extract - 500 mg
- Turmeric - 500mg - Meriva patent - (longvida was very expensive. I usually take this after an intense gym workout to help with recovery/pain).
- L-theanine - 200-400mg


Any recommendations? Any changes? These all seem quite safe/well studied, except for tart cherry extract and cranberry extract. Are those safe to take in the long term?

And before I get any magnesium recommendations, the only reason I'm not supplementing it is because I get a LOT of magnesium from my diet. My diet includes lots of grains (barley, oats, etc), seeds (chia, hemp, sunflower, flax, etc), nuts, and other foods rich in magnesium. I'm concerned I would be consuming too much magnesium if I supplement it. I'm already well over the 400mg upper limit as it is according to cronometer by many times, however I don't think this is a concern for magnesium found naturally in diet? 

Do we include drinks as supplements? I have decaf coffee several times a day, unfiltered. Chamomile every night. Hibiscus & rooibos tea once or twice a week. Green tea every morning. Black tea sometimes before a workout for a bit of energy. Lemongrass tea sometimes after a workout. Passionflower tea sometimes before bed. 

Goals: nothing specific, just to remain in good health. I do have prediabetes, I'm young (19). Some of these supplements: l-theanine, cacao & saffron were chosen as they're amazing for my mood, and some are for speeding up gym recovery. ",1,1733185274.0,Supplements,1,1.0,False

I’ll come back and update over time, but can’t get over how much faster and more efficient these chips are. I’ve been a 5 or 6 year between upgrade type and plan to rock this one for a while.

And final notes, I went down to a 14” because the 16” always was clunky for travel, and I often dock mine, have an office set up separate of the above photo, so downsizing in screen size was a goal, and I have zero regrets so far even when using the laptops display.

I'm a pilot and the type of aircraft I'm flying has a 100% pure oxygen option on our mask.

I love that thing, every morning I feel tired, even after a good 8 hours of sleep (I have nose issue that requires multiple surgeries that I'm waiting for), I have tried everything. Caffeine, energy drink, nothing really works until hours later. But pure oxygen, just a few seconds I feel completely refreshed and I'll be good for quite a while until the coffee does it's job.

So I was wondering if I could just buy some canned pure oxygen and put it in my car for when I get tired while driving and just take a few dabs. I know taking pure oxygen for an extended time at sea level pressure can cause harm to the lungs, but I was wondering if it's safe for me to take them once or twice on a long drive and not on a daily basis.

I like knowing exactly what to expect, in great detail, whenever I have a medical procedure. I had a hard time finding detailed accounts of other's experiences at with Dr. Silva/UVA, so I thought I would write down my experience. Hopefully this is useful to some of you! Feel free to comment/message with any questions you have. I also posted this on [transbucket with images](https://www.transbucket.com/pins/17707), which I will update as I heal.

Overall, I am extremely happy with my surgical team, results, and recovery so far. On the clinical side, I got all the information I needed, and my surgical team was extremely kind and very responsive with any questions or concerns I had. The administrative side was frustrating at times, but not impossible to navigate.

This is going to be a hefty and detailed post, so feel free to skip around to the parts that are relevant to you. I’ll be writing about the process of getting a consult & surgery date, the surgery itself, post-op timeline, and advice based on my experience.

**Setting up a consult/Getting Surgery Date**

I want to preface this by saying: If you are waiting for UVA to get back to you and it’s been longer than 3 business days, reach out again, ideally through MyChart. Unfortunately, sometimes things slip through the cracks. MyChart is the quickest way to get a hold of someone, and there is a written record for everyone to refer back to.

This is a general timeline (note that I started this process in 2023 and had to restart it in 2024 due to insurance issues, so some parts of this process may have changed since then).

1. Research what letter(s) you will need to get the surgery covered by insurance, and make sure the letter(s) fits the criteria for your insurance plan AND UVA's criteria. They will not schedule you for a consultation if you do not have a letter.
2. I first filled out a consultation request on UVA's website (found [here](https://www.uvaplasticsurgery.com/consultation-mobile/)). Alternatively, you can call the plastic surgery center and request a consultation over the phone (this is probably the quickest way). They will ask you to get your letter to them via fax, email, or MyChart. I recommend MyChart, and strongly recommend against faxing anything to UVA (I ended up faxing like 3 things to them and each time it was never received).
3. They will give you a selection of dates & times for your consultation. The consultation is typically with a nurse practitioner (mine was with NP Ryan, who was awesome). During your consult, you will discuss your medical history, what procedures you are eligible for, the risks and benefits, preparing for surgery, and post-op care and restrictions. They will need to examine your chest, and will take photos should they need to reference it for any reason.
4. Immediately after the consult, UVA submits a prior authorization request to your insurance. This can take anywhere from a few weeks to a few months to get approved. It is very important that the letter you provided UVA with meets your insurance requirements- otherwise your coverage will likely be denied, and the appeal process is a pain in the ass and sets you back a lot. Triple check with your insurance that your letter meets their requirements before your consult.
5. Once prior authorization is approved, you will hear from UVA (if you don't hear from them for a few days after your prior authorization clears, you can give them a call to speed along the process). They will set you up with a surgery date.
6. As your surgery approaches, UVA will call to set up your pre-op appointment and first post-op appointment (usually 5-7 days post-op, when you get your blood drains removed). If you don’t have either of these scheduled \~3 weeks before your surgery, reach out to UVA and ask about it. They forgot to schedule my pre-op appointment, and my surgery could have been delayed if I didn’t catch that in time.

**Pre-Op Appointment**

The pre-op appointment is very similar to the consultation. They go over a lot of the same information, and review pre-op/post-op instructions very thoroughly. You will be given an antibacterial soap to use the day before and morning of surgery. At this appointment, you will also meet your surgeon, who will examine your chest and answer any questions you have.

**Day of Surgery**

1. The morning of your surgery (and the night prior), you will need to shower beforehand using the antibacterial soap they gave you. You cannot eat after midnight the night before, and I was told to stop drinking water around 4am the day of.
2. When you arrive at the surgery center, you will check in and fill out a medical questionnaire. I ended up sitting in the waiting room maybe 30 minutes total.
3. Once you get called back, you are taken to a pre-op room where your nurse goes confirms your procedure, takes your vitals, and you may have to take a pregnancy test (I declined because there was no way I was pregnant).
4. You will change into a surgical gown, and your nurse describes the rest of the pre-op process, including IV, pre-op medications, and everyone you will talk to before the operation. They also go and send over your post-op prescriptions to the closest pharmacy (Walmart). I would recommend having your caretaker pick those up for you while you are under.
5. They will set up your IV, give you a strong, long-lasting dose of OTC pain meds, and give you a dermal anti-nausea patch as well (this was a lifesaver for me- I have a weak stomach and had absolutely no issues with nausea post-op). They also gave me some blankets cause it was very cold the morning of my surgery.
6. Dr. Silva and a technician met with me to go over the procedure. They then unbuttoned the top of my robe so they could mark my chest with a surgical marker. Dr. Silva had her technician (I believe she was in training) mark my chest, and then my she double-checked and made some edits. They put my robe back on and then left to go prep for surgery..
7. The anesthesiologist came in shortly after. He went over my medical questionnaire and made sure he had a complete picture of my medical history. If you smoke or do drugs please make sure they know! They will not judge but it can affect your anesthesia, so they need to know. He explained the anesthesia process, how it might feel, any possible risks, and explained that he would place painkillers in my IV towards the end of my surgery.
8. After the anesthesiologist left, my nurse came back and confirmed my procedure again. She placed a blood pressure cuff on my arm so it could be easily hooked up once I was in the OR. My family was dismissed and I was escorted to the OR.
9. This was my first surgery so I had no idea what to expect in the OR. They work very efficiently- they were already setting up when I walked in, and they even pre-warmed my bed for me! As soon as I laid down I had a whole team on me. They padded certain areas for comfort, covered me in a blanket, placed SCDs on my legs, and the anesthesiologist placed some patches near my head/neck (to monitor vitals I think). The anesthesiologist explained once again how the gas mask & anesthetic would feel, and after confirming my name/DOB/procedure, they then anesthetized me.

**Post-Op**

When you wake up, you are wearing a compression vest. I do not remember waking up- when my brain kicked in, I was already sitting up and the nurse was talking to me (about what I cannot recall). Everyone reacts to anesthesia differently, so take my experience with a grain of salt. I was not nauseous, and I felt fairly lucid, but tired- sort of like waking up from a good nap. I was also shaking a lot, which is a common reaction to anesthesia. Even though I was given oral pain meds, and pain meds through my IV, I was in a lot of pain after I woke up. It was a stinging/burning sensation right where my incisions were (this is not typical- I have some medical issues that might affect my reaction to pen meds). They asked where my pain was on a 1-10 scale (7) and told me they would bring me oral pain meds.

My nurse helped me get dressed and double-checked the dressings under my vest. I was escorted to a post-op room, and was given a lot of blankets. The nurse gave me a few options for snacks/drinks, and left to get those and brought in my family as well. I was given my pain meds once they were able to confirm that I could keep food/liquid down. My nurse went over post-op care with my caregiver, including my med schedule, blood drain care. She gave them a bunch of papers with all the post-op information I would need. At that point I was feeling well enough to leave, and was escorted to my car.

**Post-Op Healing:**

Healing will be different for everyone, but here is a short summary of how I felt after surgery.:

The first few days I really couldn’t do much of anything, and heavily relied on my caretaker for almost everything. I could go to the bathroom on my own, and I did feel well enough to go on a short walk the same day as my operation. At no point did I feel “bed-bound” and I was able to move around my home fine- just with extremely limited upper body movement. I felt very tense and fragile from the chest-up, but felt no pain (thanks to the oxy and OTC pain meds). The only time I was in pain was when I accidentally bumped my blood drains- if you’re careful and taking it easy this shouldn’t happen very often, and it’s a very brief pain. I stopped taking my oxycodone 4 days post-op, and continued with OTC medication for about 6 days post-op.

If anything, the mental stress of losing some autonomy was more difficult than the physical healing. I would suggest taking time to journal. If you are presented with an opportunity to do something within your physical capabilities, it can be very beneficial for your mental health (for me, this looked like doing light dishes, feeding my pets, and making coffee for my caretaker).

During the first post-op appointment (5-7 days post-op), you get your blood drains removed and receive nipple care instructions. Once the drains come out, your movement improves significantly. I was able to put on a regular t-shirt after they were taken out.

I am currently 10 days post-op. I can extend my arms fully in front of me at shoulder-height, and out to my sides. I can raise my arms very slightly above shoulder level, but try to limit it. I am able to drive, I can unload my dishwasher, shower, and cook myself an easy meal. I am returning to work in 2 days (I could have gone back today but wanted to make sure I was feeling up to it).

**General top surgery advice:**

* Get/make a double mastectomy pillow (like this). This was an absolute lifesaver for me. I was very concerned about sleeping with blood drains, but the mastectomy pillow kept everything in place and very comfortable. I think i would have really struggled with sleeping if I didn’t have it. It’s also great to have for just sitting down, or propping up a book/phone/handheld game.
* Set up your home prior to surgery! A good way to prepare is to go through a normal day and write down every time you use your upper body, and plan accordingly.
* Bring a pillow and blanket for the care ride home.
* Some other prep to consider: Bed is ready to jump into when you get home. Go grocery shopping beforehand. Get high-calorie and protein-dense snacks. Take out the trash. Set up games/chargers/etc. Get paper dishes so you don’t have as many to clean.
* Get a removable shower head! Even if you have someone to help you bathe post-surgery, it makes everything so much easier. Install it beforehand (and if you are bathing yourself, make sure you unhook it before surgery)
* Make sure all your medication is all stored in easy-open containers. The child-lock pill bottles that require a press and twist are surprisingly difficult to open right after surgery!
* Get a second compression vest/ace bandage wrap to use for compression while your primary compression vest is being washed.
* Practice sleeping on your back- experiment with what is most comfortable for you. Also practice getting out of bed without using your upper body.
* Buy button-ups/flannels with two breast pockets. It is way comfier to keep the drain bulbs in your breast pocket than it is to have them clipped to your vest (I’d only do this during the day; when I slept with a mastectomy pillow I didn’t want to squish my bulbs, so I clipped them to my vest at night).
* If you do clip the drain bulbs to your compression vest, make sure the clips are not touching your skin, especially when sleeping. Mine dug into my skin overnight and that does not feel great.

Again, feel free to message or comment with any questions! UVA/Dr. Silva and her team are great and I'm so happy I had surgery with them. I have not gotten my surgical tape removed, but from what I can see of my chest so far, I am in love with it and so happy.",2,1733184356.0,TopSurgery,1,1.0,False

1h59zit,https://www.reddit.com/r/LoopEarplugs/comments/1h59zit/huge_loop_comparison_and_review_i_wanted_to_find/,Huge Loop Comparison and Review - I Wanted to Find What Was Best for Me,"I recently tested several earplug models, including five Loop types (Switch 2, Engage 2, Experience 2, Quiet 2, and Quiet 2 Plus) and four cheaper Amazon options. My goal was to find comfortable earplugs for loud events—like weddings where I play violin, especially during the deafening **zaffa** at Chaldean weddings—and for reducing noise in overstimulating environments. This is after testing in grocery stores, at school performances, a wedding, and while sleeping.

For context, I get overstimulated in loud places and often need to leave to avoid feeling overwhelmed. This might even be related to undiagnosed adult autism (I’ll be getting that checked out early next year). Since I had the extra funds, I decided to dive into a full comparison of Loop earplugs and some alternatives to see what worked best.

Here’s my journey and conclusions:

https://preview.redd.it/p9nay7vzxi4e1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=81a338497b03ac9936304dfaa82e84298b403aab

**Loop Earplugs**

**Engage 2**

These earplugs surprised me with more muting than I expected. While marketed to cut noise but preserve voices, they seemed to amplify clarity in the vocal range. For example, at a school performance (musical), I noticed I could hear the audience talking much more clearly with these in. Without them, the talking was drowned out by the show itself. It was almost like the Engage boosted certain frequencies, especially in the vocal range.

The added mutes made a big difference, taking the muting effect from about a 4/10 to a 7.5/10. I wouldn’t wear these casually with friends unless the setting was loud and overstimulating (Something like a coffee shop where the grinder randomly runs), but they’re incredibly effective in busy environments.

**Experience 2**

These offer more balanced muting compared to Engage. Without mutes, I’d rate the muting at a 5/10, and with mutes, about 8/10. They’re nice, but if I’m already losing some sound clarity by muting, I’d prefer the versatility of the Engage. I didn’t find the small differences in clarity worth having a separate pair. If I went to a lot of concerts and didn’t like the engage Engage, I might lean toward Experience.

I did recently attend a wedding and had my Engage and Experience with me. I ended up using my experience with mutes most of the time because the engage was not enough. The Engage with the mutes was fine, but I wish I had my quiets with me

**Switch 2**

I could tell pretty quickly these weren’t for me. While they have three settings, none of them stood out compared to the individual models. The sound wasn’t as clear as Engage, the muting wasn’t as balanced as Experience, and the noise reduction wasn’t as strong as Quiet. I also noticed the slightly bulkier form factor compared to the individual Loops, which made them less comfortable. The idea of switching modes on the spot is nice, but the compromises weren’t worth it for me.

**Quiet 2**

These were very comfortable but had trouble staying in my ears. The shape of my ears seemed to push the top out slightly, especially when I talked or ate (This is true for all of them). They fell out halfway through the night when I tried to sleep in them. I added memory foam tips from Amazon (3mm–4mm from Luckvan), which made them stay in better and feel more comfortable. With these tips, they blocked a little more sound and were much more usable for me. As far as the regular tips, they feel slightly larger than those on the Engage/Experiance/Switch. While the large fit great in the others, I need to wear medium for these to feel around the same. 

**Quiet 2 PLUS**

I ended up returning the entire bundle, and instead of getting the regular Quiet 2, I opted for the Quiet 2 Plus. Although this is a bit out of order in the timeline, it makes sense to mention it here. The Quiet 2 Plus is definitely a nice upgrade. It comes with eight different tips instead of four, making it easier to find the best fit. The regular Quiet 2 tips provided with the Quiet 2 Plus feel slightly thicker, as I noted earlier. The double-flanged tips are thinner but compensate by having two layers. They don’t sit further into the ear canal than the single-flanged ones which I initially assumed, and I don’t notice much difference between the two when wearing them. At most it feels the same with more spread out pressure holding the loops in. 

https://preview.redd.it/wkol13v3yi4e1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=13f7bab88f264581e27da092cf26af866c483a35

**Memory Foam Ear tips**

I measured the stems on my Loops to find compatible foam tips (A store called Luckvan and also SonicFoam on Amazon):

* **Switch 2, Engage 2, Experience 2**: Stem size ranges from \~3.5mm (smallest section) to 5mm (largest section).
* **Quiet 2**: Smaller stem, \~2.5mm to 3.5mm.

The Luckvan memory foam tips from Amazon (3mm–4mm) fit the Quiet 2 perfectly and the same ones though (4mm-5mm) for the other ones perfectly. They seemed to block more sound and are more comfortable for me. For SonicFoam the SF3 fit both (let them settle in before putting them in your ear because the inner diameter seems to be more flexible and if you immediately take them out of your ear they could fall off of the stem.)

I did hear a bit more difference using the foam eartips when using the Switch 2. I wish they gave those with the earplugs. I also found the SonicFoam to be more comfortable. I could wear the mediums but needed smalls for Luckvan as Mediums were too much pressure.

**Amazon Alternatives**

I tested several cheap earplugs, I wanted the ones with ""fins"" or ""wing tips"" as I have had ear buds in the past that were super comfortable because they stayed in without needing to go far into my ear. Two came close:

1. **Black Triple Flange (Toeah)**: These went far into my ears and provided strong isolation, but they were uncomfortable. They felt like they were going to stab my eardrum.
2. **Pink Winged (LIMEHO)**: These were my favorite of the cheap options. They don’t go far into the ear but instead hook onto the outer part, which I find much more comfortable. The tip part of it looks like it is copying what Bose Sleepbuds do. I know some people hate earplugs that touch the outer ear, but for me, it’s the opposite—I prefer it. They stay in place better than the Quiet 2 (Without the foam tips) and are great for sleeping or casual use. I went with pink because it blends in and reminds me of a Slowpoke tail!

**Mutes**

The mutes themselves work well to add a few extra decibels of muting. It is a small amount, but if I feel that the Engage were not doing as much as I wanted, but didn't want to put in the quiets, the mutes were a great in-between. I had no issue with putting them in or taking them out. As others have said in posts, I wish there was a spot for them in the case that keeps them separate. I tried some of the Amazon knockoff ones. These were from a store called SAVITA and they were $5 for 6 pairs.

The colors were much more dull than the official ones, they seemed  slightly thinner (Especially at the ends) at about 75% the thickness, and not as well made. You can see the edges are not as smooth. With that said, they fit just as well and seemed to do the exact same amount of muting (Or close enough to not be able to tell the difference). I am a big proponent of supporting the original creators, but if someone was just buying the Loop mutes with shipping it would be about $20 which can be a big chunk of change for the pieces of silicone.

**Final Thoughts**

After weeks of testing, here’s where I landed:

* **Engage 2**: Best overall for medium/loud environments and clarity in voices. I’m keeping these for performances and other overstimulating situations.
* **Quiet 2 with foam tips**: Great for sleeping or as a backup when I need maximum muting.
* **Pink Winged Earplugs**: Comfortable and practical for casual use or sleep.

I returned all the other Amazon plugs except for the pink ones. Unfortunately, I couldn’t return just part of the Loop Deluxe Bundle, but I reordered a clear Engage and Quiet 2 Plus (with double-flange tips) during Black Friday for a better deal.

I hope my journey will help others looking to get a pair or two of earplugs. Please do not hesitate to reach out with any questions you may have.",2,1733184317.0,LoopEarplugs,1,0.75,False

This is the longest stretch he’s had without a drink. His drinking was variable at best but it definitely strained our relationship at the time. We are very happy atm. But I can’t shake the nervousness that one day he’ll come home with drinks. He’s literally asked me, jokingly/not jokingly if he can drink. I’d slump over and look at him, say you can do whatever you want, just remember what will happen if you do. (I will leave to my mother’s.) He wouldn’t get alcohol those times which was assuring. I guess I just don’t know how to shake this paranoia. He hasn’t committed to a sense of how he’s going to treat alcohol, like whether or not he’ll stay completely sober or end up trying his hand at drinking again but occasionally instead. Which I feel like he knows isn’t possible. He’s also mentioned several times how he’s proud of himself that he hasn’t drank. He fills his free time now with playing video games and drinking coffee instead. 

Is this normal to feel this way? I know I’m not responsible for his actions, but I’m still so worried. So worried that we’ll go down the same path but worse. ",1,1733184245.0,AlAnon,1,1.0,False

I have not been grinding or weighing my beans, just packing the portafilter with pre ground coffee and tamping down with the included plastic tamp.

This usually results in a watery shot and me still spending $7-15 a day on coffee outside (I love coffee) so I've decided it's time to actually learn how to make espresso myself.

A lot of the recommendations on this thread are for a Bambino Plus along with a separate grinder like the ESP, vs buying an all in one Barista Pro/touch.

1) I'm wondering why the Plus is always the recommended machine over the regular Bambino, and if I should upgrade? Will my regular Bambino do the job?

2) If do need to upgrade, are the Pro/Touch better machines now they use a baratza grinder?

I have a hard time making friends and I'm trying really hard to be calm and not out there. I'm very hyperactive mentally and physically. My old friend told me when I start school and start making new friends try not to be annoying. 

I do tend to laugh and make jokes a lot kinda to help me work through my other emotions and my nervousness. I recently moved into this really nice luxury apartment downtown next to the water with an amazing view. I wanted to invite one of my classmates over not into my apartment but to the study/ workplace so we can help each other out because im strong in some classes and she is in others. But whenni started to ask her I felt rejected. So for the remainder of class I stopped talking to her and walked around her so I didn't have to pass by her leaving class.

Idk maybe I'm over reacting or something. But it makes me want to be medicated so that I'm turned down and maybe that will attract more ppl.

Nightmare Life,"As everyone knows the pains are beyond comprehension, along with the taxing mental instability that comes with it.
I have had 4 years of ongoing disabilities.  But now everything's gotten worse in the last month it seems since I took antibiotics for a tooth infection, first amoxicillin, then fluconazole for secondary yeast, then had an urgent root canal with more antibiotics, clindamyacin and then yeast treatment fluconazole 2 more times.
I had rescent MRI before pain worsened and CT scans done since my pain sent me to ER 2 times in last 2 weeks and my pain is through the roof.
My history is as follows: year 2020-2021
C5/C6 Left severe stenosis 
Thoracic - Denervation T5/6-T10  never specified exact spot.
Originally L4- L5  Bulge
Rib Cage Pain Right Side Flank in Back.
Gait ataxia

Dec 2023 
Heart attack 100% Right Ventricle which the intense pain manifested in my mid upper back in the same thoracic area.

Now recently all my pain has come back 10 fold.

New pain 
Intense burning at my Lower spine ? L4/L5? to just the right of it, and feels like ripping or pulling from Right side lower rib cage at my spine in my flank/ back.. 
Constantly having to Urinate and Bladder Pressure.
I have to pee almost every 45 minutes, and feel I'm leaking some taint amounts inbetween.
Right front groin pain
Chest pain at sternum and occasional difficulty breathing, like I can't catch my breathe.  Scares me of Heart Attack symptom.
Thoracic hurts to lay on my back and sore as heck feels deep in the bones.
Neck Base of skull occasional zaps or when laying on back stingers up my head in back.

New Results: 2024 November
My L4/ L5 has now become Severe Right Stenosis and also Left Moderate Stenosis at the same L4/L5 veterbrae how is that possible?
But now my L3/L4 also has the Right Severe stenosis included with it.
Inflammed Ureter Right Side 
Cold Chills
Extreme Dry Mouth every morning 
Also Levo Scoliosis of Lumbar Spine 

So??   If you have had surgery or these similar new symptoms along with the urge to pee and bladder pressure prior, what warrants the actual reason to get to the ER?  Am I supposed to wait until I actually pee myself?  I've never had to pee this much or so much pressure.  But I don't know if these antibiotics caused all this either, I wasn't in this much pain in my low back ever and not like this prior to antibiotics but maybe 2 times in the last 6 months but only lower back not my neck and thoracic involved.  But not even as intense that it wakes me up now and can't fall back asleep.
Oh and COLD CHILLS through out the day worse when I lay down at night and it's 73° most the time and Extreme Dry Mouth every morning, seem very dehydrated. But drink water and coffee 

Also any insight on my symptoms and results is highly appreciated.
For instance is my neck C5/C6 which isn't as painful as the other areas is it finally shot causing the mid upper thoracic back pain and causing my lower lumbar pain to be worse now?  I was doing ok for a few months in between these last 4 years but I've been housebound 98% sitting or laying most days and can't get around without a walker unless I wall walk or have something near to lean or grab onto and it's very short distances, standing I'm weak and unstable shaky/tremor feeling inside my body.

Also no UTI or Bacteria in urine or Stool showed up.

Could this be some sort of spinal infection, how would I know, I don't have a fever either but those cold chills and dry mouth, and pain worsens every morning as soon as I get up, a long with weakness in body., pain last through day but varies in intensity.

Sorry if I'm all over the place, I'm feeling so hopeless and not getting anywhere other then worse everyday now.  I can't get any where it seems.  I had in the past PT Pool, PT General ,Pelvic Floor PT.   Pain Management injections made me worse they were just trial before going for further injections, Kenalog shots, chiropractor -again made it worse. Neurology, Ortho, Sports Med, Fascia.   So lost here it's really messing with my mind.

This piece is just… masterful, the gripping first movement is like an intense scene of war and the struggle of love, like a soldier going through ongoing war and capturing the intense passion and pain of maintaining a personal love for a person while battling for the love of your country. The fear and anxiety captured with such a simplistic melody and movement of modulation within the piece is so well thought out and executed you can feel the wave of emotions as the intensity of fear increases as if you’re worried you won’t be able to return home. The middle scenes depict such a fear so well crafted it’s as if you can hear the cries of anguish and terror at such a devastating battle at every turn only being driven by the hope you can return home to your beautiful home and partner with the scenes of your lovely country. Finally, it concludes with the powerful b minor chords to signify such a terrifying and ambiguous end to a viscous battle and leave the audience in utter suspense hoping it isn’t the end for our hopeful and youthful protagonist. Then we have the second movement… oh man, the second movement. I’m a sucker for a good E major melody, but this is easily one of the greatest melodies in E major I’ve ever heard. It gives such a simple opening with the colors of a warm sun on an open field, then we see our protagonist and their lover on the patio of such a beautiful home, enjoying coffee watching the countryside. Such a simple melody depicts a lovely passion and atmosphere with its simplistic E major arpeggios going into the passionate progressions in the melody to depict the burning love our protagonist bears and hopes to give. It’s almost as if the main motif just depicts the appreciation of life and love itself, the human experience, the joys of striving for your perfect harmony in this world. It’s unease resolves so hopefully and tearfully with such a wonderful shift back into its main theme, as if showing the audience that no matter how rough life can get, there’s a light to look up to in the stars and sun. The c-sharp minor chords banging as if the trauma of war is bringing our protagonist back to war and the terror that this moment is temporary just for the warm touch of their partner to bring back the reality that life may be short but enjoying it is what makes it worth living. Going into such a cheery melody of C major is so simple yet so calming because of its moving sound giving us that pastoral picture, moving us to tears as we see the main motif return with a look into the now sapphire blue sky and the golden colors of sun dancing across evergreen trees in the marigold fields. This piece is so ingenious with its melody moving around several keys in a very Schubert-esque manner that gives you a story in so many colors all returning to that same homey feeling and admiration for living in the now. I love this second movement so much because it’s the most beautiful and amazing melody to hear over and over again with so many layers among such basic chords and melodic motions. We finally end the piece with a resolution to our story coming back to the evening sky turning royal purple and leaning on the protagonists partner as we cherish such a wonderful melody resolving into the lush E major chords telling us our story has a happy ending. I wanted to share this because I’ve been so obsessed with these melodies and the way it masterfully depicts Schubert’s writing style. I hope you all enjoyed reading this, and thank you if you made it to the end, I cannot express enough how lovely this piece is to me while going through such a rough patch mentally.

Let me tell you about myself.

I enjoy playing board games (especially chess) and also I play games like Roblox and team fortress 2. I am a bit socially anxious, however recently I have been going to lots of society events so I've started going outside my comfort zone a lot. I take weekly tango classes at my university, which I have been enjoying so much, so maybe I could show you a few moves I've learnt lol. I also go to the board games club to socialise.

Since I am new to dating, I am open to doing pretty much anything on a first date. Also I'm not quite sure about my type yet. I am 5ft 11 and roughly 160lbs. Ethnically from South Asia but I was born and raised in London. I don't drink much to be honest, but I'm also not opposed to it. I don't smoke at all. I'm open to dating someone in the age range 18-20.

Honestly it would just be really cool to go on a date with a woman sometime during the Christmas holidays, no pressure for it to lead to anything more. We could go to a museum or gallery, there are tonnes of them in London. Or we could go for a walk in the park, or get coffee. I don't really mind.

I’m also looking for a cold brew/cold foam feature. I’ve looked at the Breville Jet and the Delonghi Eletta. I just can’t decide between them. I’m just so confused because this is a major decision and we don’t want to make a mistake buying something we might not like.

I can’t believe I am in my 30s losing sleep over a man who hasn’t even asked me for my number. Sure we spend time together and it’s enjoyable but it’s been like this for over a month and he hasn’t made a move. But here I am, pathetic as anything creating a fantasy about what could be and probably coming across desperate by eagerly agreeing to grab coffee whenever he ask (we work in the same company and both new-ish). Logically I should remove myself from him but 

It’s not really about him though. It’s about me. Always hoping and wishing for breadcrumbs to become bread. Wondering why I act mean/childish around men I like instead of being sensible and wise like I usually am. Why do I act a fool? From planning a whole life based on minimal effort, to seeing something that isn’t there, and picking myself apart when things fall through. 

I’m having a mental war not to pick apart my appearance because I know better but why? Why haven’t I found love yet. 

I just feel helpless. Even if someone shows signs they might like me I think maybe they can do better than me.

Recently I got into a bad habit of window shopping online which slowly led to buying more wants that aren’t needs. These past couple of months have been rough on my credit card, and while I didn’t get into debt, it has impacted my ability to save. So I’m going on a no-buy month to reset my spending habits back to healthier levels. Here are my rules:

- No clothes, none. I have enough
- No makeup or skin care unless I’m replacing an item I use daily. I’m not replacing items I don’t use daily even if they run out
- No new books, I’m shopping my existing library which is full of books I haven’t gotten to
- Uber Eats or eating out only once a week. This one is going to be tough as I order food 5 times a week
- No household items or furniture unless I’m replacing something critical (like a lightbulb or appliance)
- No limit on getting coffee out since one of my favorite activities in the cold months is working at a cafe

Let me tell you about myself.

I enjoy playing board games (especially chess) and also I play games like Roblox and team fortress 2. I am a bit socially anxious, however recently I have been going to lots of society events so I've started going outside my comfort zone a lot. I take weekly tango classes at my university, which I have been enjoying so much, so maybe I could show you a few moves I've learnt lol. I also go to the board games club to socialise.

Since I am new to dating, I am open to doing pretty much anything on a first date. Also I'm not quite sure about my type yet. I am 5ft 11 and roughly 160lbs. Ethnically from South Asia but I was born and raised in London. I don't drink much to be honest, but I'm also not opposed to it. I don't smoke at all. I'm open to dating someone in the age range 18-20. 

Honestly it would just be really cool to go on a date with a woman sometime during the Christmas holidays, no pressure for it to lead to anything more. We could go to a museum or gallery, there are tonnes of them in London. Or we could go for a walk in the park, or get coffee. I don't really mind.

Anyways that's all I have to say, looking forward to hearing from you :)",1,1733182721.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

Today I received an email where someone was interested in buying my website & I replied asking about their budget.

I'm kind of used for clients not knowing the prices for the development costs, but this is the actual (translated) part from an email: 'Similar pages can be developed abroad within $100-$250 range, but I’d rather keep the money in (country), I would initially make an offer of €500.'

Keep in mind, this website is a full blown used car listing website which is currently in production and is already working. $0 profit as I'm a better dev than a marketer, but it comes with all bells an whistles such as being multilingual, dynamic front-end (vehicle props defined on the backend), supports anything from boats to regular cars, support for companies to add cars under their names and more. It took 3 months of full time work to get it running.

I almost spit out my coffee in the morning while reading the email as I have previously received offer which is obviously much higher AND a job offer. The logo alone was $300, lol.

She stood by me through an addiction which sent me to rehab twice. I now have a year of sobriety. 

This past summer, I was struggling in my sobriety but I still wanted to go out with my friends. So it was my first time going out since rehab and my girlfriend's best friend did my drug of choice in front of me. This really hurt me as I considered her to be one of my best friends as well. She knows about my addiction too. When she was asked why she did that she said that she just wanted me to ""feel normal"". I chose not to speak with her for a couple of months and during that time I quarreled with my girlfriend about it more than I should have. I should have confronted her friend earlier, but honestly did not have the strength in me. Her friend is not the easiest person to work with, plus I never got any apology or word from her after my girlfriend told her how that it hurt my feelings when she did my drug of choice right in front of me. After about two months, I asked her to get coffee with me. She sort of heard me out, gave a half-assed apology and then I tried to open up a little bit about how sad I am about the way things have turned out because I love my gf so much and could see myself marrying her. Her friend turned to me and said that she didn't think we should be together. I honestly couldn't believe it because I always thought we had a great relationship aside from my personal issues. She continued to explain how she holds a lot of resentment towards me and then dished out some very harsh ""advice"" in an angry way to me like, ""you care too much about what people think of you"" and ""when you leave, you better not talk to \[my girlfriend\]"". She also said that I manipulated my friendship with her to ""get"" my gf... a couple of days following this conversation, I asked her why she told me all of that so harshly and asked about the manipulating our friendship and she said that she never said any of those things and completely reframed the conversation. So I just didn't respond.

I found her comments to be disrespectful to me - but also to my girlfriend. When I asked my girlfriend what she thought, she basically said ""well, I guess that's what she thinks"". If I was her and my best friend said that to my girlfriend, I think I would have a problem with it... but she couldn't seem to understand that.

At a certain point, I broke completely and felt completely unsupported by everyone in my life except my girlfriend and I became an ""emotional burden"" to her. So, I decided to move for both of our own good. Before I left, we made love many times and had a very sad goodbye. I know that beneath the chaos of my being lost in life and emotional turmoil, there is the strongest relationship I have ever felt. I trust her with my whole life and look up to her in many ways. I think of her as my family and love her whole family. She has met my whole family and likes them too. I was so fucking close to asking her to marry me this summer, but I couldn't make sense of it considering my financial situation and my instability in my sobriety. 

When I am thinking positively about this situation, it goes something like this: ""I did the right thing to give her space and give both of us time to reset. And that she is more important to me than us...""

But there are some lingering issues that make me feel extremely insecure and lead me into a doom mindset:

\- She didn't want to do long distance because she didn't want to spend every night on the phone or texting, I guess it didn't seem fair to her. But she also knows that I would marry her in a second, so why not stay together?

\- I am in my late twenties and have no career. I've freelanced through my twenties and have just been scraping by. I've never made more than 30k in a year and rely on help from my family. So logistically, I'm struggle to wrap my head around the idea of getting married and having a family of my own. At the same time, I genuinely feel ready for that in my life. I feel like I need it.

I spoke with her about a week after I left and I was really sad hearing her voice, I was crying and trying to be transparent about some of my insecurities. Eventually she told me that she ""just wants to be with someone who is happy and confident"" and I just about died inside.

  
So, I’m really scared that I will lose her and do not know how to deal with these feelings. I have intrusive thoughts of her hooking up with random people or falling in love with somebody who is stable and rich - even just stable. She doesn't seem to see it in herself, but I know that anybody with half a brain would wife her up in a second if they got to know her.

I have no idea how to prove to her that I am doing the work form afar. We keep in touch a little bit, calling every so often, but I’m so depressed. I feel like a failure even though I just got one year of sobriety. It feels like the life that I built up for so long collapsed completely. It's made me question everything about myself, even my sobriety. I feel completely lost and heartbroken. 

I need to figure something out ASAP but I don't know what that is. I've been in a sort of ""paralysis of analysis"" state of being for so long. I want to become a designer or filmmaker, which feels almost impossible with my current state of mind and emotional wreckage. 

Every night when I try to fall asleep, I'm plagued by these thoughts of how to figure my whole life out and simultaneously I'm haunted by the idea of losing my girlfriend forever. It's like a living hell. ",1,1733181640.0,AskMenAdvice,6,1.0,False
1h58yu5,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1h58yu5/not_sure_how_to_navigate_this_situation_need/,Not Sure How to Navigate This Situation - Need Advice (Mainly from Women),"I'm M(36) and she's F(28). We met at work though we're not direct co-workers.

At first, I wasn't really looking for anything nor was I that into her when we first met. However, in my industry it's common to network and simply ask co-workers to get coffee and connect that way. We eventually did connect around May, and had a good conversation. I still wasn't into her, but I could sense an opening of it being a possibility.

After that initial conversation, we would run into each other in the office a lot, and just talk about anything under the Sun. Then we started planning hang-outs together. Through conversations, she soon reveals that she got out of a five-year relationship. So I understood there was a lot to unpack there for her. I still wasn't that into her at this point.

Then, she invites me to a park in Los Angeles where the Sunsets are killer. We literally sit down with her dog, a blanket, and watched the Sunset. Then, she looked at me in a way that I've experienced before. That's when it started. I started to like her.

Flash forward several hangouts: bars, movies, and other random hangouts, I knew I wanted to take the chance to ask her out on an official date. So we went to a comedy show, and hung-out by my car afterwards smoking a joint for a couple of hours. We walked back to her car and that's when I asked her out. I let her know that I fully understood she needed to heal, and quite possibly wasn't ready for anything, but that I'd regret it forever if I never asked. She smiled, gave me a hug, and said that she sees that possibility down the line but that she's emotionally unavailable. Fully respect her honesty and it was so refreshing.

However, we kept hanging out and doing these date-like things without ever calling them ""dates"".  It's been several months of this, and I'm just not sure what to do. In any other situation, I would've kissed her ages ago and taken the initiative. I'm wondering if she's waiting for that?

Like for instance, she invited me over to her place for the first time to have some wine and hangout. Some context to this: She was leaving for Mexico to get away for Thanksgiving, and I asked if she wanted to get coffee the morning before. She said yes, but then had to cancel that because her boss had her work a couple of hours that morning. Therefore, she said we should have drinks instead that same night. So, the night comes and she gives several suggestions, before ultimately saying why don't I come over instead for a chill hang-out and some wine. So, I do and it was really chill. She wore her lounge-wear/pajamas and although we never got super physically close, she rested her legs on my chair. 

This is where I lose my mind internally. Was she asking me to make a move? I've been fully respecting her boundaries this entire time, but I get this weird sense (that could be false) that she's waiting for something. But I could be totally wrong. Now I'm sitting here overthinking that night.

I guess the larger question is: should I keep waiting or just put up a boundary saying that I think I should take a step back from hanging out like this. Because honestly, it's been messing with me emotionally. I mean, I'm conflicted: I want to see her and hangout still, but I also don't really know what she's going for. A five-year relationship is a long time to unpack. So I'm stuck between making a move and respecting her boundaries, or simply just move on. She did tell me recently she likes me but is still heartbroken. Like, what am I supposed to do with all this? I'm worried I'll just fizzle out of any desire she may have for me if I don't do something...

  
Would love a woman's opinion/thoughts on this. Some have told me to make a move and take the initiative, others have told me to respect her boundaries until she signals she's ready. But I'm not a mind-reader. I'm the type of person that doesn't shy away from taking the initiative, and takes a chance under normal circumstances. But I legit have no idea what to do here.

All my previous attempts have withered away after a few days, so I am looking for someone who wants something long term! (or longer term)

so about me? I am 26, living in the UK but hopeful to move one day. I work for a very popular company that I cannot say the name of, but you'll have heard of them before. My primary passion in life has always been my work and I feel like it's time that shifted to someone else, so that's why I am here! maybe you'll be the lucky person! What am I looking for you ask? I have no idea, friends, lovers, haters, who knows.

I am an avid reader, my bookcase is full of books i've yet to read and a lot of I have read and cannot come to terms with giving away. If I am not reading I will likely be sat under a blanket somewhere in my house playing video games. As with most people on Reddit, I am indeed a huge nerd. I love to code & paint too! I am really just spraying my thoughts onto this right now, there is only so much you can say about yourself without writing a life story.

As for other things I like to do:

\- Stumble into things, I am very clumsy. Drink an ungodly amount of coffee, listen to music far too loud on my headphones, order too much food for myself and regret it later, pretend like I understand politics, suck at boardgames and sing karaoke.

happy to swap photos etc. just don't be super weird or uninterested in talking. I am also not picky about where you are from, so don't let that put you off :) hope to speak to you soon.",1,1733181203.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

Turned out amazing with sweet dark chocolate flavors. Used 1Zpresso JXPro grinder (gray dot), whole milk, and clover honey.

Used this recipe with inverted method and one oem paper filter:

Grind Setting: Grind 75% at 26.25 (2 full turns on dial then one notch towards 27). Grind 25% at 26.5  (2 full turns on dial then in between 26 and 27). Also 6 turns at 26.0 at beginning of grind and 6 turns at 26.0 near end of grind. Finessing the grind :-)

Water temp: 25 seconds off boil (about 205 degrees F).  
  
Coffee beans: fill grinder (30-35 grams).  
  
Pour hot water into Aeropress (start timer) to about half full and stir a bit, and steep for 30 seconds.

Pour to top off Aeropress cylinder, stir a bit before the timer reaches 2 minutes.

Flip at 2 minutes, then press for one minute until bottomed out and you start to hear the squish noise (timer will be at 3 minutes when done).

Add 1-2 tablespoons of water to dilute, then add the clover honey and whole milk etc.

Happy Holidays!

Ever since i downloaded those mods I've been met with a CTD, but the thing is - the main menu loads, I can load up a save, and I'll be in the game for like a split second, then it freezes and crashes. 

I don't really know if I downloaded something wrong or if my computer simply cant handle it ;-; I already made peace with the fact that the ENB I'm using (Rudy ENB with cathedral weathers - Zangdar's edit with Lux) will kill my frame rate (managing 10-25 fps, but i thought i'd just power through because I'm still setting up and didn't even start playing properly). 

Regardless, I've installed Crash Logger to figure out the reason behind the crashing, I couldn't really decipher it, but have a feeling it has to do with my RAM. Last I checked, ENB doesn't affect RAM, so could it be the animation mods? the texture mods? Something else? I'll be posting my mod list from MO2, my crash log, and my system specs here in case someone would be so kind to look at it :) please help me figure this out! I'd also be really grateful for any tips to optimize my game/mod substitutes!

Hi there! I'm looking for someone to take over my lease for a wonderful studio apartment located right at the border of Hoboken and Jersey City. It’s the perfect spot for anyone looking to be close to both cities with all the great dining, shops, and entertainment just a short walk away.

The apartment itself is super bright and spacious. More spacious than your average studio apartment. The kitchen is modern, sleek granite countertops, and plenty of cabinet space. There’s also a large closet to store everything you need.

The building offers great amenities like a 24/7 concierge, fitness center, coffee machine, lounge space, pool, and a rooftop with amazing views. 

If you’re looking for a place that’s easy to commute from and offers a lot of comfort and convenience, this is a great option. Please reach out if you're interested or would like to come see it! I'd love to hear from you.",1,1733180980.0,Hoboken,0,1.0,False

""My dearest Drea,

My hope is that someday, it’s you who discovers this letter. Adrian can be impulsive and unpredictable, and I have no idea what he might do in the future.

Drea, my little spark, my strength—I wish I’d had more time to see you grow, to be there for you. You are my heart, my sunshine, and please, always remember that. There’s so much I want to say, but time has grown scarce; I can feel it slipping away. My health is failing quickly, and it’s not by accident.

You deserve to know, Drea, that the reason for my failing health is Vivian—your mother. I wanted so badly for our marriage to work, wanted to share everything with her. But she only cared about my fortune, and she’s gone to great lengths to secure it for herself.

My estate belongs solely to you and Adrian. I wanted to make this clear in a will, but I never expected time to run out this way. I’ve long suspected Vivian was tainting my drinks, but today, I’m certain. She brought me coffee not long ago, and there, faintly on the cup’s rim, were traces of a familiar poison. I could call the police or rush to the hospital, but instead, I choose to write to you now, hoping you find this someday, hidden here in your nursery.

If things go as I hope, David may look after you, maybe even adopt you, though he doesn’t know of you yet. If not, I pray Adrian finds you and keeps you safe. I believe you’ll grow into a remarkable woman, strong and resilient, Drea. Know that I loved you fiercely. Please tell Adrian that despite his anger over my choices, I’m deeply sorry and that I love him as well.

I love you both,

\~Emerson Grant""

The letter slipped from Drea’s trembling fingers, her legs giving way. Sorin quickly wrapped an arm around her shoulders, holding her upright as she crumpled into his side.

Tears blurred her vision, and through them, she looked up at Sorin, whose expression held a quiet grief. Though he was only a child back then, his affection for his uncle had been real.

She managed to choke out, “W-what does this mean?”

""Shh,"" Sorin soothed her, bending to pick up the letter and carefully slipping it into her book. “Not here, not now. Let’s get home, then we can talk.”

She nodded, her lips trembling as tears spilled over. Sorin gently wiped them away, wrapped an arm around her waist, and guided her out of the room. They descended the stairs quietly, moving toward the exit.

Just as they reached the door, her mother’s shrill voice called after them, “Leaving already? You haven’t stayed for lunch.”

Sorin’s jaw clenched tightly. Murderous woman, he thought, before turning to face her with a forced smile. “I’d rather have lunch alone with my wife. Thanks.” With that, he steered Drea out the door.

Once they were safely away, he pulled the car to a stop by the side of the road, dropping his head against the steering wheel. “Damn it, damn it, damn it.”

A soft touch settled over his hand, gripping the wheel tightly. Lifting his head, he found Drea’s gaze, shimmering with unshed tears as she tried to hold them back.

“D-do you… think this could really be true?” Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

He reached for the book and retrieved the letter, directing her gaze to its signature. “Look, he signed it. If we can track down some old documents he might’ve signed, we’ll have proof.” He paused, deep in thought. “Dad must have something lying around.” A loud groan escaped him as he pinched the bridge of his nose, tears gathering in his eyes. “Why did my uncle have to be so reckless? He could’ve at least confided in my father and asked for his help! Damn it!”

Drea intertwined her fingers with his, offering a comforting squeeze. “We… we don’t really know what was going on back then…”

A sob erupted from him. “I loved him so much, Drea. I don’t remember everything, but I know I did. To learn he met such a tragic end…”

Leaning forward, Drea rested her forehead against his bicep, weeping alongside him. He lowered his chin onto her head, tears streaming down his cheeks as they sought solace in one another’s embrace.

After several moments, he wiped his eyes and said, “Call Adrian. Tell him to meet us at home.”

Drea nodded as Sorin drove away. When they arrived, Adrian sat at the dining table, his head bowed and hands gripping his hair in despair, the letter sprawled before him.

Taking a seat beside him, Drea wrapped her arm around him, offering comfort while Sorin stood back, his mind racing as he contemplated their next steps. Grief could wait; justice for his uncle was their immediate priority, and Sorin vowed he wouldn’t rest until it was served.

Suddenly, Adrian shot up from his seat, his eyes bloodshot and wild. He pulled out his pistol from the holster at his waist, making Drea gasp softly in shock.

“That’s it! That woman is going to pay today. I’ve tolerated her long enough!” He growled, striding toward the door. Drea grasped his wrist, desperately trying to halt him.

“Adrian, no!”

I don’t know if this is the proper place to post this but just about an hour ago I was picking up a coffee from McDonald’s for my mom. When the young gentleman who worked there went to hand it to me the lid popped off and he spilled it all over my arm, down my sweater sleeve and down the side of my car. He was very nice and apologetic and gave me napkins, I drove off because I wasn’t hurting yet, but as I got down the road I realized my arm was blazing red and burning badly. I got home and put it under ice but it looks as if I may get a line of blisters from where I had a hair tie. I do not want the employee to get in trouble. He was super nice and very apologetic and helpful. But I was wondering if there is anything I can do? McDonald’s should not be serving such hot coffee.  

Edit to add: I am NOT trying to sue McDonalds. I know this isn’t a severe enough event to have grounds for that. However; I don’t know if it’s going to hinder my job performance(I type all day long) and if I am going to urgent care (probably not because it’s just a few blisters).

Let me give you a bit of info before I dive in. I’ve got pcos and have been on birth control since I was around 18 to help regulate my heavy and irregular periods. I’m currently 29. 

I missed a few pills (sporadically, not in a row) last month and it resulted in a very light period week starting on 10/29-11/4. Blood was spotty and dark coffee ground blood. I started bleeding again on 11/8- very light, but enough to warrant wearing a tampon or liner and have not stopped since. 

I went to my gynecologist on 11/20 so she could do a quick exam and everything was normal- no infections, no stds. She recommended skipping the placebo week of my birth control (which was last week) and starting a new pack. 

I did that and am STILL bleeding. I had asked her on the 20th if I should stop taking the pills for a bit and let my cycle end naturally and she didn’t hate the idea, but preferred I kept taking the hormones. 

I’m tired of bleeding. It’s not horrible, buts it’s inconvenient and is affecting my love life lol. 

Should I stop my pill pack and see what a week of nothing will do? Or should I just keep taking it. 

Ps- I already messaged my gyno as well and am waiting for a reply. I’m aware Reddit is not a medical community but wanted to see others thoughts and experiences. Thanks!! ",1,1733180383.0,Periods,0,1.0,False

I know this is gonna take a long time and I’m prepared to do this slowly and safely. Been struggling for ages. 

Got diagnosed with Hashimoto and I’ve been gaining weight ever since. Currently taking 50 mcg of levothyroxine. no other symptoms as far as I can tell, no food intolerances. 

I’m taking 1000 mg of berberine in the morning and 1000 at night starting today.

No more than 1500 cal a day, I use a calorie counting app. Will adjust my macros to mostly protein and lower carbs but still allowing treats.

10,000 steps no matter what, I’ve been doing this for two years and it’s been great!

Does this sound like a plan? I don’t wanna do workouts or anything other than walking and living my active lifestyle. I know this is gonna come down to food. Planning on eating mostly home-cooked food, I’m a good cook and do a lot of protein and vegetables.

I drink only water, about 3 L per day. No coffee, limited dairy and gluten just because it’s better for people with Hashimoto apparently.

Wish me luck guys, I’m trying to lose 50 pounds in the next year!
