1jmsdze,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jmsdze,üéâ We Paid Off Our $17K Personal Loan in Just 19 Months‚Äî41 Months Ahead of Schedule! üéâ,"Hi, Debt-Free Community!

I‚Äôm beyond excited to share that we just paid off our $17,000 personal loan today‚Äî a whopping 41 months ahead of schedule! üéâ We took out this loan on August 2023, for a five-year term. While we typically manage our finances well, life threw us a curveball, and we had to take this step. However, we tackled it head-on, and here are a few key things that worked for us:

1. Living Off One Income: While living off one income isn‚Äôt new to us, truly sticking to it during this tough economy has been a challenge for our family of four. It required us to be more disciplined and resourceful. We created a detailed monthly payment schedule based on our necessities. We committed to throwing all extra money we had toward the loan to stay focused on our goals. 

 2. Subscriptions: We took a hard look at our subscriptions and turned off anything we didn‚Äôt absolutely need. No more keeping services ‚Äújust in case‚Äù‚Äîif we weren‚Äôt using it, it was gone!
 
 3. Meal Planning and Prep: We absolutely meal plan and meal prep for breakfast, lunch, and dinner for all seven days of the week. We don‚Äôt eat out or buy morning coffee from the drive-thru. Instead, we buy coffee and tea in bulk and make it at home and it saves us time and money. If we want something sweet, we bake our sweet treats and freeze them to indulge in later. We have littles, so they find it fun to help out in the kitchen when it comes to baking cookies, crackers, making fruit leather, etc. I make slow-cooker freezer meals for those chaotic nights filled with work and school extracurricular activities.

It feels incredible to be free from that debt! üôå If you're facing a similar situation, just remember that it‚Äôs possible to take control and pay it off sooner than you think.

Thank you for being such an inspiring community! Here‚Äôs to financial freedom! üí™üí∞",3,1743271794.0,debtfree,0,1.0,False

I haven't been to therapy in 6 months, my relationships are healing and doing well, and I thought I was getting happier. Apparently, I have not been doing well. I don't know how to monitor my emotions, like I can't feel the sadness or recognize it until it reaches an uncontrollable level. Every time it comes back, it hits me like a truck, and I feel like I failed myself. This time, I was celebrating being able to purchase alcohol. I told myself I wouldn't drink, but I did. My friends and family gifted me alcohol and weed, which I have never abused long term (These friends have no clue about my issues, otherwise they would not have bought it for me). I just get super sad sometimes and get hammered or high to deal with it, then don't do it again for long periods of time. I only realized how bad it's been when I woke up this morning and realized this is the first time in 5 days that I have been sober. And it was very painful emotionally and physically to be sober. I think I was drinking and smoking so I wouldn't have to deal with those emotions. I have a severe need to drink or smoke right now, even though it makes me sick. I am at a coffee shop though so I am distanced from those substances. Additionally, I'm knee deep in missing assignments and I feel like I'm going to drown. I'm a 4.0 student as well. Not a great situation. I don't want to create an addiction, but I feel like in the moment I don't see a problem with it and I convince myself its okay. I never want to repeat what I did 6 months ago, which was get insanely drunk at my friend's wedding, throw up everywhere after 10-12 drinks in under an hour, and have my boyfriend clean it up and drive me home. I don't want to ruin my relationships and myself. This is mostly a rant, but I would appreciate some advice and/or support. I don't know if I ask a question in order to get advice, but I guess my question would be, how do I dig myself out of this hole?

by Christina Wise, March 27, 2025

The PerSisters are a grassroots group of women in Scotts Valley who handwrite 200-250 postcards every Friday to encourage voter turnout across the U.S. The group, made up of volunteers aged 18 to 95, gathers weekly at Starbucks in Graham Plaza, with plans to move outdoors to Cruise Coffee when the weather improves.

Founded after the 2016 election by Donna Maurillo, the group joined forces with the national Postcards to Voters (PtV) movement. PtV provides scripts and voter addresses so volunteers can write pro-candidate (never anti-opposition) messages to registered Democratic voters. They cover everything from local judicial races to national Senate contests and even send reminders to re-register, especially in states like Florida.

Members like 95-year-old Marge Laxson and newcomer Cindy Frobish say writing postcards feels like a meaningful way to participate in democracy and combat political frustration. They‚Äôve also shown support for corporate DEI policies and occasionally sent feistier messages to President Trump during his administration.

The PerSisters are part of a larger effort ‚Äî PtV boasts over 75,000 volunteers nationwide, with nearly 8 million postcards sent since 2017. Their mission is simple but powerful: encourage civic engagement one handwritten message at a time.‚Äù",1,1743270816.0,ScottsValley,0,1.0,False

He just drunkenly kissed a girl etc. He does have a p0rn addiction that he swears he doesnt have. I just know deep down. Nothing I can do about it. Now that we are adults, make our own money, etc. Things have changed. Not so much. But I do expect him to work more or I look for job opportunities for him and encourage him to work.

He struggles financially by spending his money on his smoking habits etc. Im a nursing student and work retail so i buy my own things.  he doesnt take me on dates I don‚Äôt expect him to as much as I want it but I know he‚Äôs trynna get by.

Zero traction, zero feedback. Posted it everywhere but got nothing beyond ""looks cool"" comments. Frustrating as hell.

So I built Huzzler - a community where founders can actually get meaningful feedback. Started coding at night after my day job, fueled by too much coffee and spite.

Tech stack: Laravel 12, TailwindCSS + DaisyUI, AlpineJS. Nothing fancy.

For growth, I did something painfully simple but effective: dedicated 1 hour every single day to providing genuinely helpful feedback on Reddit. No link dropping, no ""check out my site!"" spam - just being helpful and occasionally mentioning Huzzler when truly relevant.

Day 5 of this approach: still zero traction. Day 15: first 10 users. Day 30: suddenly 50 people using it daily. Now hovering around 50 DAU, 200 signups, and 2k monthly visitors.

So if you're building something, remember that you really need to think: ""where are my customers hanging out"" and then helping them over there. Contact them and make it feel personal.

Thanks a lot of reading!

If you're struggling like I was, maybe my experience can help you.

# Step 1: Understand what you're actually fighting

What finally worked for me was realizing I wasn't just fighting a nicotine addiction - I was fighting a complex habit with physical, psychological, and behavioral components.

Most people focus entirely on the nicotine and ignore the ritual aspects. For me, it wasn't just the chemical dependency - it was the hand-to-mouth action, the deep breathing, the social component, and the way I used vaping as a way to take breaks and deal with stress.

**Health effects**: After years of vaping, I developed a chronic cough, frequent bronchitis, and shortness of breath that made climbing stairs difficult. My doctor found early signs of lung damage that scared me enough to get serious about quitting.

**Financial reality**: I calculated that I spent over $9,000 on vaping over 7 years. Seeing that number written down was a huge wake-up call.

# Step 2: Gradual nicotine reduction

Unlike my previous cold-turkey attempts that always failed, I systematically reduced my nicotine content over 6 weeks:

* Started at 50mg salt nic
* Stepped down to 35mg for two weeks
* Then 20mg for two weeks
* Finally 6mg for two weeks

This approach minimized withdrawal symptoms while allowing my body to adjust. The key was sticking strictly to a schedule rather than decreasing ""when I felt ready.""

# Step 3: Address the habit, not just the addiction

I identified my major vaping triggers:

* Morning coffee
* Driving
* After meals
* Work stress
* Drinking alcohol

For each trigger, I created a replacement behavior:

* Chewing gum while driving
* Taking actual breaks with tea instead of vape breaks
* Using a stress ball during work calls
* Drinking water with lemon when cravings hit

I also used nicotine lozenges (sparingly) during the first month to handle the worst cravings without returning to the harmful habit.

# Step 4: Benefits beyond what I expected

The obvious health improvements happened better breathing, no more cough, more energy.

But the unexpected benefits were even better:

* Food tastes amazing now
* My anxiety levels dropped dramatically
* I'm saving $150+ monthly
* No more planning my day around battery life and juice levels
* Freedom from constantly wondering if it's okay to vape in certain situations

If you're struggling to quit, don't beat yourself up over failed attempts. Each try teaches you something about your addiction. What worked for me was treating it as both a chemical dependency AND a behavioral habit that needed replacing, not just eliminating.

I hope I'm not moving too far outside the scope of this subreddit but for me, composting is a big part of living sustainably so I thought maybe we could all put down our experiences and help each other toward a greener future. We have a worm farm we bought so I'll describe our experiences and I'd love it if more experienced worm owners than me and people with knowledge of other forms of composting (like heaps in their gardens and so on) would pitch in. There's a lot I don't know and I would really enjoy learning. That said, if anyone has any phobias in the direction of earthworms, molds, bugs or dirt, please be careful reading on, all of those things will be discussed and some of them pictured.

[Our worm farm!](https://preview.redd.it/50hs6f2gonre1.jpg?width=6000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ab7bdc84a72419103dc1777373ab395dc41a125e)

  
We bought our farm online, because making one from scratch semeed too difficult at the time (2019, I think?) - I've seen people making them at home, though, so it's entirely possible to upcycle plastic boxes by drilling holes in them and stacking them on top of each other. It's also rather stylish and we were planning to keep it in the kitchen, so that definitely played a role, too. (I'll get to the change of location later.) Back then it was a bit of an investment but not too terribly much and the container is really the only investment that needs to be made (aside from the earthworms themselves but those tend to be cheap).

[Side view](https://preview.redd.it/y2wu35aopnre1.jpg?width=6000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2b716146d4f07c4de040f281cf913f4412e0a11f)

Our make came with two layers but more are available for purchase - they'd just be added to the top. We're happy with two layers like this because we're just two people with only a small balcony garden so we don't have that much to put in there. By the time it's truly full, the lower layer is usually ready for harvest (and then we just put it on top and continue). The largest layer at the bottom (where the legs are attached) serves as worm tea storage: this is pretty much earthworm pee, it drains down through the layers and collects in this bottom one to keep the humidity at a good level and protect the earthworms. There is a layer of fabric between this and the upper layers which serves to stop worms from falling into the liquid and drowning. Which reminds me - the bottom of each layer is full of holes for worms to pass through comfortably, so they have access to the whole thing and can choose where to go (just not the bottom layer where it's unsafe for them). Our farm is a little dirty on theoutside right now but that's just because I spilled some leftovers on it while feeding the worms, it's not a rule that a farm will be dirty and earthworms don't make it so.

[Bottom view](https://preview.redd.it/rzq20vpuqnre1.jpg?width=6000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1d339bcdc23733ddadc6b954df994cea2ac0e783)

  
The bottom layer also has an outlet to collect worm tea - it's good to check every now and then, it can fill surprisingly quickly, especially if the food is mainly wet (more on that later). Worm tea is an excellent fertilizer - but very potent, one must be very careful not to burn a plant's roots with it. We've used for everything from inside plants to herbs to tomatoes (not orchids or roses) and our plants are very happy with it. Beware, though, it stinks terribly - the farm itself smells pleasantly of a forest but worm tea is just awful! We store it in the dark in bottles we saved from fabric softener.

[Worm tea - best fertilizer!](https://preview.redd.it/adz1ip7ornre1.jpg?width=6000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=97d75b0916e4cebd1836f1fe918daa573b51c22f)

The same goes for compost - it's important to find a good balance and make sure a plant's roots aren't overwhelmed. I have made the mistake in the past of thinking that more compost surely means better and it cost a few lives, sadly.

[Worm compost](https://preview.redd.it/9yiv2st3snre1.jpg?width=6000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cac446f1530af8c219d60a50f25bb99fbf08fa63)

When it comes to collecting compost, the frequency really depends on the size - both of the bins and of the worm population. Here in Europe we also have cold winters which means that our earthworms hibernate. We keep them in the corridor where temperatures never go below freezing but it's usually enough to put them to sleep for a bit, we also left them outside by the wall of the building for a single winter and they did survive this (but it's risky, we never did that again - again, more on the rasoning later). Generally, then, more compost in summer, much less processing power during the cold months. I've seen people talk about feeding something highly desirable like flour so that worms would migrate to the surface and the lower levels can be removed to evacuate the compost but for me, I usually just tip out the whole bin with the worms in there and gradually work my way through it by spreading half of it very thin and exposing the worms who then run away into the other half that is still in a heap. I do this until I basically only have worms, then throw that into my other bin and position the now empty bin on top to rotate it back into use. It might be a bit stressful to the worms but it gives me a good view of the health and size of the population and I can also remove any eggs I find - I didn't want to dig for these so no picture but these are small, very bright yellow balls, often laid in pods together. After it's been harvested, I lay out the compost in a thin layer and let it dry a little (overnight or 24 hours), then I collect it and store it.

[Wet food](https://preview.redd.it/az4icizkunre1.jpg?width=6000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eb81f12226fec9180fa598942ef14cf739bd73b5)

There's a lot of guidance on what to feed but worms are essentially vegan, that's the easier way to go. From what I understand, they will deal with animal products, they're not harmful to them, but their decomposition really stinks so it's very much not recommended, especially for anyone keeping worms in their home. For the same reason we also don't feed any citrus fruits (and usually also no onions, but that's a softer rule). What we do give are kitchen leftovers like vegetable skins, leafy parts, hard parts or anything that died in the fridge (let's be real, happens to the best of us), also tea bags and coffee grounds - and eggcartons because (at least in Czechia and as far as I know) these are paper in its last stage of life, already recycled from other paper products. We also add parts of flowers and plants, as long as they're healthy, though we try not to put seeds. It's good to cut up everything because that speeds up decomposition, food for worms is also often frozen and defrosted before putting it in as that rips apart cell membranes and makes veggies soft and chewy. Earthworms don't have any teeth, just a mouth with which they suck up food so they need other organisms to help soften up whatever's for dinner (which means the softer and moldier, the better, no need to worry about feeding that cucumber from the back of the fridge that's all colors and basically liquid, just remove the plastic). They also love teabags for doing the dirty so if a distaster strikes and only a few survive, just have loads of tea and let them at it, the population bounces right back.

[Dry food](https://preview.redd.it/x802qec1xnre1.jpg?width=6000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c1baa59d369344e8e604c5e0e47abd940c22040b)

Egg cartons go in torn up like this and misted from a water bottle, the reasoning is the same - no teeth. We try to keep a good balance of humidity inside which is achieved by combining wet food and dry food in a balanced way. Compost inside should be moist and but not wet, when sqeezed, it shouldn't drip water. Other than that, though, it's less scary than it sounds, it's a sturdy ecosystem in there and it can deal with a lot.

[Compost inside a worm farm](https://preview.redd.it/prbd8hdixnre1.jpg?width=6000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5a92876687a8da6f4718743442652b3128f0df2c)

This leads me to the other things to expect inside a worm farm - molds and small bugs. As I said before, it's an ecosystem and earthworms don't have teeth. So the farm is actually not just compost and earthworms, it's a multitude of other organisms, most of whom help with the decomposition process, making food available to the earthworms. Our bugs are tiny and white and I remember that we were very surprised to see them in the beginning. Molds also love the humid, dark environment so they periodically sprout and die off depending on the state of the farm. This time I managed to catch some white fluffy mold growing on pretty fresh pet bedding but I've also observed mushrooms in there before (they bloomed and died off, decomposed with the rest).

[Mold on the job](https://preview.redd.it/sxpowticynre1.jpg?width=6000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4e8da3e9b05e17407fc7946c3b4a316e8feebbfc)

There are some other guests, though, who are less welcome. For example, fruit flies - they are the reason that our worms are outside in the corridor now because it's not always easy to make sure that nothing we bought has any fruit fly eggs of some such (same thing for fungus gnats, buy any plant and one is risking an invasion), so now we only feed after the food has been in our kitchen at least a few hours and nothing has emerged. This is because we spent two years (not hyperbole) fighting fruit flies in our worm farm and the only thing that really helped was leaving the farm outside for winter. It was an ordeal, it was horrible, never again. If I even suspect that something might be wrong, I just throw the leftovers out, not worth it! They multiply unbelievably fast, they swarm around the farm, it's disgusting. And because worms need air, one can't even fully isolate the farm. For anyone thinking about starting this, this is THE thing to always remember! If you have any doubt at all about some leftover, don't feed it. It's better to waste a bit of apple than to fight fruit flies for literal years.

There are many types of earthworm, apparently, and the type that goes into farms is special - Californian. Therefore, it must be bought especially and cannot be released into the wild, either (at least not here in Czechia where it is considered an invasive species). We got ours online which was scary because it's a living thing being mailed but if one chooses mild weather and makes it so that they get picked up right away, the worms survive well (our box contained no dead ones and they were also very active).

That's all I can think of right now, please do add more tips and tricks, fellow farmers! Also, if anyone has experience with how compost heaps in gardens work, I'd love to learn. We're hoping to obtain a garden one day and a compost heap seems like a must.",1,1743269968.0,cottoncore,1,1.0,False

Wonderingwhyyy ¬∑ Today 14:47

*I was talking to a Christian who told me she fasts the traditional way in Lent. No food and or water from sunrise to sunset. She was the first I had met who actually abstains from food and drink for a significant period of time.*


*Other Christians I know choose to give up one food e.g. chocolate, wine, tea, coffee. One Christian told me she gave up Facebook for Lent.*


*The Christian who said she fasted the traditional way told me she gained many benefits such as spiritual closeness to God, self discipline, greater self control.*


*It did make sense. Giving up Facebook doesn't seem likely to bring many benefits although may it did for that one person.*


*I wonder why it became diluted and whether Christianity has lost its followers by allowing most things it did not used to.*


There is a CHRISTIAN subforum. For CHRISTIANS. To talk about CHRISTIAN things. Like, why ask in AIBU other than because you want traffic? You'll just get loads of atheists telling you Christianity is stupid. And honestly, most Christians don't fast for Lent the way Muslims do for Ramadan. They'll give some things up but not ALL food. Ethiopian Christians don't eat meat, and I think the Greek Orthodox do some fasts, but that's the most hardcore it gets usually. I wonder if this friend exists tbh.

This is my first time posting so bear with me. Also English isn't my first language so apologies for any spelling/grammar mistakes.

I (27F) befriended my (77M) neighbour. For context, I live with my mother (70F) and we moved to this town a couple of years ago. A while back we chatted with our neighbours and invited them over for coffee. From then on we would meet up once in a while just to chat.

The neighbour in question is very kind and friendly and even let me borrow his camera (photography is my hobby and we spoke about it. Then he offered to let me borrow his camera). Every now and then he teaches me something to do with taking pictures. 

It's been really nice chatting with him but the other day it became weird. We were drinking tea in a new cafe around the corner and at some point he kind of admitted he likes me more than just a friend/friendly neighbour. It wasn't in so many words but it was clear what he meant. It really weirded me out to be honest because he's 50 years older than me and it would never have even crossed my mind that we could be anything else than friends/friendly neighbours.

I feel really akward now and I'm not sure how to handle this. I spoke with my mom about it and she thinks it's weird too and also inappropriate.

I'm kind of an 'old soul' so I speak really easily with older people but I never ever acted like I like him that way.

I do want to add that he's not pushy or creepy in any way.

1jmrfw9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Diary/comments/1jmrfw9/a_day_off/,A Day Off,"Dear diary,

So very dear, my diary.

I was so sleepy all day yesterday. Slept extremely fitfully the night before. But ultimately it was a pretty good day. Work was closed for the day, but I still woke up early anyways to take my son to before-school care.

The morning feeling. I LOVE the morning feeling. The way the air is! You know?

When it's still dark out. ESPECIALLY when the moon is out. And then just gradually, gradually the world starts taking on light. And it is best at times when it's not raining but has been or is going to rain. And the cloud cover acts like the lid of a pot, that locks in the morning feeling for a while longer.

Some kid at my son's morning care said the school was going on a field trip today. So I rushed to his school to go fill out the paperwork so he could go. But that kid was wrong about the field trip.

My son's morning care group arrived in the office while I was talking to the principal. I acted surprised to see him, and we played around a bit and I gave him a big hug. It was a fun way for him to kick off the school day.

I went to Wal-Mart to shop for new work pants. I was caught up in the school drop-off line for a while -- the only means of egress. And I stopped for a cup of coffee on the way. So, the morning feeling had faded by the time I got there.

I do not like shopping for clothes. Overwhelming. Bought three pairs of pants for me. Four clothing items for little buddy.

Then I went to work. My GPS took me on a different route which was kind of confusing and surreal. I almost wondered if I'd put in the wrong destination at first, but somehow the route did ultimately spit me out next to my work building.

It took me through the part of town where a lot of the signage is in one of two different East Asian languages.

I saw that an office building that I'd seen in passing a few times over the years, had been destroyed. Apparently by a recent fire. Depressing. I hope insurance covers it and people won't go without their jobs.

I needed more coffee again by the time I reached work, so I went to the drivethrough of the cafe near my work building.

The barista wrote ""Hang in there, buddy! = ) "" on my cup. Which is objectively hilarious. I guess I was looking melancholic.

Once I got to work, I took the elevator on up to my floor which was entirely unoccupied except for me, today.

An empty floor of an office building has such haunting beauty. As though you can still see the ghosts of everyone who usually occupies it, without intruding upon or interfering with them.

At lunch time I ordered DoorDash. The security guard told the dasher that she was pretty sure that that no one was working on that floor today. But he insisted that he was supposed to bring the food all the way up to the room number listed on the instructions.

However, it seems, when he reached my floor, he got spooked by the empty darkness of the lobby, dropped the food and turned tail.

I don't blame him -- good instincts because surely, that whole situation has all the earmarks of a trap.

But I found my food where he left it and it was good. Well. I didn't find it until a while after he'd dropped it off. So, the dessert had gotten a bit warm and lost some of it's charm.

But the sandwich was heavenly.

My productivity was low, but I did manage to get some grading done. Organized some stacks of assignments. Drank several cups of coffee. Haunted the liminal darkness in various parts of the school.

In the afternoon I left for my doctor's appointment -- a follow up for this acute bronchitis with which I'm still afflicted.

I was seeing my regular doctor but at a different location that I'd never visited before.

Lo and behold, it turned out to be in the very same part of town, with the high East Asian population, as my GPS had unexpectedly taken me through earlier.

Interesting, because I rarely find myself in that part of town.

The building where the medical practice was had a similar sort of charm to my own work building. Aesthetically appealing dark green marble-esque tiles with gold accents gave the building a memorable distinctiveness.

The elevator had neither windows nor mirrors. Until one looked up. The polished black obsidian ceiling gave the effect of a mirror, darkly.

You had to turn your neck almost ninety degrees to see it, though. But the echo of every element of myself and every element within the elevator, cast in deeper hues, gave an invigorated feeling. Similar to the morning feeling.

When I awaited my doctor, I became gripped with some sort of terrible apprehension. As though I might scream. My heart beat against the inside of my chest as though trying to beat down a door. I felt as though, I had some very important problem I needed to ask the good doctor's help with when she arrived to the exam room.

But I could not remember what it was.

And the feeling abated eventually.

My drowsiness actually started to fade last night, around eleven p.m. ...Much too late. But I did use it to work on a bit of laundry and tidying up.

Hey MaximizeMe fam! üåü Ever catch yourself wading through a sea of chaotic thoughts before even pouring your morning coffee? üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Well, that was me, and I'm convinced my brain had more tabs open than my browser.

**So here‚Äôs my '10-Second' Habit Stack:**  
*Spoiler: It takes less time than watching your microwave popcorn finish its spin!*

1. **The Instant Gratitude Blast** üôè  
   Before my feet hit the ground, I name three things I‚Äôm grateful for. Seriously, try it. Starts the day with a spark, and you don't even have to open your eyes!

2. **Quick-Tidy Tornado** üåÄ  
   Spend **10 seconds** organizing whatever you can see. Your desk, a shelf‚Äîdoesn't matter! Clutter-free space = clutter-free mind.

3. **Deep Breath Dive** üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  
   Take one deep, intentional breath. Feel it in your toes. You're reminding yourself that you're the boss of your day, not the other way around.

4. **10-Second Mind Dump** üí≠  
   Jot down whatever‚Äôs on your mind on a sticky note. It doesn‚Äôt have to make sense, but it puts those pesky thoughts somewhere else for a while.

**Some of you might be thinking:** ‚Äú10 seconds? Really?‚Äù But hey, small hinges swing big doors, right? üòâ These are like mini wins that set the tone‚Äîyou'll zip through tasks with ninja-like focus.

**Why these random acts of efficiency?**   
* Ever notice how a clean counter just makes everything feel... achievable?  
* Or how breathing like you mean it can turn a mental marathon into a leisurely stroll?  
* And no, I don‚Äôt mean magic feng shui stuff‚Äîjust the science of clear space, clear mind! üîÆ

I get it, not everyone loves a pre-coffee morning ritual (team Snooze Button, unite!). But once you realize how many free hours it gifts you, you might just become a believer.

The Smoky Life of Emilia Pageok

Emilia is from Argentina and is a stunning tattoo covered thirty-three-year-old brunette, currently with dyed bright red hair. She is a single mum of two. Emilia is a committed forty-five cigarettes a day smoker. She has traditionally had no loyalty to any brand and had varied her cigarette packs depending on her mood. However, currently Emilia smokes Marlboro Reds and occasionally enjoys Parliament‚Äôs.
Her fabulous smoke filled content can be found below :-

On Reddit as u/Emilypageok

On Insta she is Emilia üñ§ (@empageok) 

Her paid content is Onlyfans onlyfans.com/emilypageok.

From a very young age Emilia knew that she was going to smoke. She grew up with it, as both her parents smoked, which meant she was surrounded by cigarettes and their smoke. This meant that cigarettes and the act of smoking were part of her life. She knew that by the time she was eight, that she was destined to light up all by herself. She used to role play scenarios and have a pencil between her lips mimicking her parents‚Äô smoking action.  It took a while, but by the age of fourteen her and a friend decided it was time to experiment. She stole some cigarettes from her parents and lit them up. Their aim was to try and get the eyes of the older boys between classes. There was no looking back. From then on, she lit up every morning with her friend before school. Soon she had to smoke in the afternoon too.

It was not a surprise to her parents that she started smoking, and it was accepted within the family that she did. Today, her mum has unfortunately passed away, and her dad has quit smoking. He now takes great pleasure from lecturing her to quit. Emilia is currently having too much fun smoking to quit.
Today Emilia mixes being a single mum juggling looking after her two children as well as being a full-time smoking fetish model.

We actually started writing this story about Emilia almost two years ago, there was a slight miscommunication, and the discussion stopped. The good news is that during the intervening months her habit has changed. When we first spoke, she only smoked a pack a day. In the last eighteen months her consumption has multiplied. Her devotion to producing smoking fetish content and enjoyment of smoking cigarettes has only increased, as is the amount she smokes. 

She has found that this means during her day now has to create more space for the habit. Smoking comes first. She will smoke at least two cigarettes while waking up in bed, eighteen months ago she wouldn‚Äôt smoke in the bedroom. Now she will even smoke several more in bed before falling asleep. Eighteen months ago, Emilia would get up, putting on her dressing gown on a shuffle to the kitchen to make her freshly ground roasted coffee. The grinding takes time, and the act is not pretty, but in her opinion the taste of the ground coffee is far superior. Once brewed and she is sitting down. It was only then that she would light up and enjoy her first cigarette of the day. A cigarette whilst sitting there with her strong milk less morning coffee. That part has not changed; she still very much enjoys her morning cigarettes and a couple of mugs of steaming hot coffee of the day. The difference is that there will be a couple more cigarettes with each mug. Emilia needs more nicotine to operate. She just enjoys lighting up as much as she can.

Emilia will smoke several cigarettes before sorting out the school run for her children. Once home again she will sit in the bedroom and smoke a couple whilst putting on her makeup. With that on she is finally ready to face the day online.

When her face is done, she will prepare for that day's filming. Cigarettes will be smoked as she flits about the spare room and sets up her recording equipment.
As she sees herself as a very active smoking fetish model by producing daily fresh content for her OnlyFans.  For the next two or so hours she will record herself smoking for her paid subscribers and producing custom videos. 

The last time we spoke she would claim that the first few cigarettes of the day were for ‚Äúhers‚Äù alone. Then the ones smoked creating content for her subscribers were for ‚Äúthem‚Äù. Today, she only smokes for herself and enjoys the fact she can share the pleasure she gets from continually smoking by making content. 
She found the fetish because a few years ago someone asked for a video of her smoking because they had the fetish. Emilia has not looked back. She knew that was what she wanted to do more of. Soon she fell in love with the fetish and enjoyed all the people in it.

Today, she sees that by being involved in the smoking fetish world, she has given her the ability to befriend her addiction, rather than feel awkward by it. She can now enjoy smoking, and as such has very much embraced it. Emilia used to feel guilty about smoking; she would tie herself in knots about it. Today, she has to just make room in her day for the pleasure and enjoyment of doing so. From waking up to going to bed cigarette after cigarette will be smoked.
So much so that by no longer feeling guilty Emilia will turn herself on lighting a cigarette especially when doing a power smoking session.

She is smoking so much that by lunchtime she will have smoked a whole pack of cigarettes.
Last time we spoke she would suggest that with her recording done, she would get changed and head out of the house to the nearby gym. She works out with a focus on weight exercises to maintain her slim figure and try to tone her body. She is totally aware that there is one problem with being in the gym and being a devoted smoker is that as she exercises, she tires easily and then gets out of breath.

Emilia has noticed that as she has increased her cigarette consumption, that she has lost a lot of weight and that it is much harder for her to do workouts. She finds that her lungs can get easily agitated. There is now the continuous sensation that they are always congested with phlegm, and recently that has been a lot more frequent coughing to try but fail to dislodge it. Lighting a fresh cigarette helps.
For Emilia as she gets herself hot and sweaty working on the weights, there is always at the back of her mind that there is something to look forward to as she works out. That idea has not changed at all in the past couple of years, for her the next cigarette of the day will be hurriedly lit as soon as she steps out the front door of the gym. She can spend up to two hours in the gym distracting herself from the need for nicotine, but admits last half an hour feels endless and is torture. When not exercising she can only go for about half an hour to forty minutes at maximum before she has the urgent need to light up.

Emilia truly embraced the smoking fetish community, and by throwing herself into it has helped her out of a bout of deep depression. She believes she has managed to find herself and feels emotionally better because of it. Also smoking means so much to her that her favourite tattoo on her body is that of a girl smoking.

Emilia sees the best thing about smoking is the enormous number of positive sensations that she feels within her body as she smokes. The worst thing is the cost of cigarettes and the very negative responses she gets from people when she admits she is a smoker.

For Emilia smoking has always come first, even back in her school days she and her friends managed to flirt with a teacher to allow them, when it was raining, to smoke by the window in the classroom. Looking back on it, she is convinced the teacher in question had the smoking fetish.

Emilia doesn't want to think about the future, she is happy with the now. At this time, with a cigarette between her lips and smoke in her lungs, she does not see a single reason to quit.

1jmrbrg,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantarFasciitis/comments/1jmrbrg/my_personal_guide_to_getting_through_travel_and/,My personal guide to getting through travel and events with PF,"Obvious caveat: this is not medical advice, should not be taken as such, and anything and everything you do should be discussed with your doctor or PT. This is a list of thought processes that have helped me in the past. I have had PF for almost 2 years now, and in that time have gone on several walking-heavy vacations (7-9 miles/day), and have had events where I had to wear dress shoes for days (like my own wedding). This is intended to be a guide not to heal or improve, but a list of things that have helped me manage and enjoy my trips and events despite my circumstances and pain.

1. **This is the only real piece of general advice I will give here.** The biggest thing I will say to anyone suffering from this condition with big days ahead: **breathe, relax.** I say that not condescendingly, but with total empathy for what you are going through. Try to remember that it‚Äôs going to be okay. Make peace with the situation and personal limitations. The odds that you will be better or healed by the time your trip rolls around are small. There will be some discomfort and pain. That‚Äôs okay. Pain is a physical feeling, but you don't need to let it overtake your experience. I got married during a flare up, and it was the greatest day of my life. Yes my feet hurt on my honeymoon, but making peace with pain allowed it to remain a magical trip, and allowed me to more easily make mental and physical accommodations. Seriously, try to enjoy your trip/event. Don‚Äôt dwell on your lack of progress during these few days. Unless you physically cannot put one foot in front of the other, try to not let pain ruin a moment. Do the things you want to do unless you truly physically cannot.
 
2. **Medication**. For me, Naproxen OR Melixocam in the morning and some Tylenol in the afternoon worked wonders for my trip, especially when taken for a few days leading up to the trip as well. For my wedding day itself, lidocaine patches on my foot were game changers. They got me through the rehearsal and wedding in hard soled dress shoes. Truly, I did not feel A THING. I didn‚Äôt think about my feet once, and I was standing 95% of the day. These are not longterm solutions, especially lidocaine, but they are decent band aids that can help ease the pain during short bursts.

3. **Be okay looking dumb and make smart footwear decisions.**  Yeah I went to Italy and wore Saucony Guide 17s. I looked like a goofy American tourist. But it‚Äôs important for me to prioritize comfort over style. I wear the most comfortable shoes I have. This allowed me to walk longer distances and not need to stop too often or cut days short. I see a lot of posts from people who are comfortable while wearing Hokas or Oofos but want something new and different for a trip (more stylish), but I think I had the most success sticking to what worked at home. Similarly, if I need to stretch in a public place, some rando in Portugal or Japan might think I'm weird, but who cares. Do what you gotta do. 

4. **Pain mitigation and figuring out what helps.** In the weeks leading up to my trip/event, I experimented with KT tape, ice, heat, and rolling, as it pertained to short term relief. Remember, the goal here is not to be cured (though that would be great). **The real goal is to be able to walk 10k steps without wanting to cry.** If ice helps, bring some cold packs, and if heat helps, bring a portable heat pad. I personally cannot travel now without a lacrosse ball for my calves, but others may prefer a foam roller, or hate stretching entirely. When I realized that KT tape helped, I pre-cut all my KT tape for the week and had them ready for every morning. This reduced my pain only slightly, but enough to help me get through the day, especially along with everything else. I also found that low-arch insoles really helped on longer walking days, and used those with great success, and wearing crocs at my hotel also helped for recovery. This was and still is the hardest part of the process, because it involves some experimentation, and some honest assessment as to whether stuff works or doesn‚Äôt. 

5. **Rest.** Take care of yourself. Make time to sit, have a coffee, take off your shoes for a moment. If you need to sit during a museum visit, that‚Äôs okay! If you need to take an afternoon break at a cafe and have a glass of wine, even better! Building in the mental and scheduling flexibility for a sit or a pause or an hour back at the hotel was a game changer for me. Similarly, if you find that stretching or a PT routine offers relief, be sure to carve out some time for it.  

6. **PT-guided adjustments towards short term relief.** My PT routine is a twice-weekly circuit that focuses mainly on strength, but my feet are always sore afterwards for a day or so. In the cases where I am walking 15k steps a day, it‚Äôs best for me to hold off on strength routines for the week, otherwise I risk a bigger flare up mid trip. I also got some great advice from my PT on how to give myself some short term relief outside of the regular circuit, and I went back to my full time routine when I got back home.  

7. **Two unexpected danger zones: museums and showers.** Standing is hard on the feet, often harder than walking. Museums are really challenging places for PF because of the constant weight on your feet for hours without any dynamic movement. If we go to a museum, I go see what we want to see, but I try not to feel guilty if I'm not up for doing the WHOLE Louvre. Showers are also hard, because you‚Äôre barefoot and standing. Flip flops or crocs in the shower can be a game changer. I have a Helinox chair that folds up into something the size of a burrito, which I bring on really long trips, so I can sit if there is literally no where to sit and I can't bear to stand any longer. I also find that constantly standing on a street corner looking at my phone for directions greatly increases standing time and strain over the course of a day, so it helps me personally to have a general gist of the route before I set off (which also helps me be more present and less focused on my foot). 

8. **Set aside some money for cabs.** Yeah vacations are expensive, but sometimes you‚Äôre able to get more out of a vacation if you‚Äôre willing to spend an extra 10-20 dollars on a cab ride from some place that is otherwise unreachable by foot for you. Budget a few cab rides into your trip so you can afford to stretch your walking distance as much as possible. 

9. **Be mindful of trip companions.** My wife has heard endless complaints about my foot when I've been at my worst. But subjecting her to hours  of disquisitions on pain when we are abroad together is not fair to her, and it also isn't fair to me either. Personally, agreeing on my end to curtail rumination (unless it is solutions oriented like ""I need to find a place to sit"") greatly reduces the strain on both of us, and lets me be in the moment.",4,1743268991.0,PlantarFasciitis,0,0.83,False

[Breville Bambino Plus]","¬†So for a while I rolled with the CASABREWS CM5418, everything was great, I even used a cheap Cuisinart burr grinder(which btw did not give me proper grind size AT ALL) but it still somehow worked because of the pressurized basket I guess. All in all it gave me good enough coffee that I didn't have to work hard for.

But my happy good enough coffee ends, because I decided to upgrade.

¬†I decided to purchase a Breville Bambino Plus and got it set up ready to go. The first problem I encountered was my grinder not being good enough for the shots, I would use 15g in the puck (double cup, double basket) and it would yield like 45ml in 25 seconds, i'm like ok? Yeah i get it, my grinder won't work then, I'll just get this pre grinded at a coffee shop. So I bought some espresso at a coffee shop, and had them grind the beans to like a 2. I tried it out the next day and it still yielded 40 ml in like 25 seconds(way too fast) so I upped the dose around 18. This time it was the exact same. I played with the single wall and the double wall but both still pulled super fast. And I was like uhhh OK? So I went back to a coffee shop and got a finer grind (3) I tried with 18g in a one wall, double cup basket, but it ended up with a worse shot around 47 ml in 18 seconds. And i'm like? Ok??? What's wrong now?? After that I switched back to the double walled basket but instead I used 19g. This time it was slower! It was 35 ml in 25 seconds, woah!. But.. the shot still tastes like .. well nothing at all, and I'm using 1:1 milk or less so i can try and taste the coffee.

I've been troubleshooting this espresso maker for about 2 months now, and I still haven't made 1 good cup of coffee, and I know some of yall will tell me to buy my own expensive grinder, but I honestly can't afford it right now. I'm trying to figure this out the best I can with what I got.¬†

Somewhere between physics equations and late-night problem-solving, I find myself here looking for a connection that feels real.

I‚Äôm Danish, 18, from Mumbai (yes, that‚Äôs my name, not my nationality). A curious mind drawn to robotics, green tech, and the endless puzzle that is the universe. I may struggle with school, but put me in a room with math, physics, and tech, and I enter a state of flow where nothing else exists. I don‚Äôt study the traditional way; I absorb knowledge. My problem-solving skills? Sharp. My memory for school stuff? Questionable. I might have ADHD (self-diagnosed), but I‚Äôve made peace with how my mind works. I love learning, not memorizing.

But beyond intellect, I‚Äôm someone who loves deeply. I don‚Äôt do half-measures. I care intensely. I‚Äôm affectionate, clingy in the best way, and expressive. I‚Äôll remember the little things: your favorite song, how you take your coffee, the things you casually mention but don‚Äôt expect anyone to recall. Expect Spotify playlists, random texts, thoughtful surprises, and a partner who truly sees you. If you need reassurance, warmth, and someone who makes you feel safe, you‚Äôll never have to ask‚Äîit‚Äôs just who I am.

When I love, I love completely. I want to choose someone every single day through every storm and every sunrise‚Äînot just when it‚Äôs easy, but especially when it‚Äôs hard. I want a love where we build each other up, where we grow together, where we are safe with each other to be raw, real, and vulnerable. I don‚Äôt believe in surface-level love. I want something that runs deep, something that lasts.

I‚Äôve had my share of struggles, but I‚Äôve healed. I‚Äôve fought my battles, and now I‚Äôm standing at the beginning of the journey I‚Äôve been dreaming about. I have big dreams: becoming a scientist in robotics or sustainable tech, making a real impact, and one day giving back to the world in ways that matter. I‚Äôm working on myself physically too. I‚Äôve been on a fitness journey and am already seeing changes.

I won‚Äôt promise you perfection, but I will promise you honesty. I don‚Äôt sugarcoat things, and I won‚Äôt feed you empty words. My kindness is both my greatest strength and my biggest weakness‚ÄîI give a lot, sometimes more than I should. I tend to put people above myself, but I‚Äôm working on that balance.

So now tell me:

1. What drives you?


2. What‚Äôs the one thing that makes you feel alive?


3. If you could ask me anything right now, what would it be?



Let‚Äôs talk. Let‚Äôs get to know each other. Let‚Äôs build something real.

My husband and I spent 2 months there two decades ago (we were young!), so we have some familiarity and also both speak Spanish.

My biggest question is whether to focus only on one region, likely flying in/out of Cartagena. But I don't think we want a full week in that city and my youngest isn't ready for Tayrona. I've looked into flying to San Andres and Providencia, but am open to other ideas.  
  
Alternatively, we could spend the first few days in/around Cartagena and then hop a flight elsewhere. We loved Salento and the Coffee Zone vibe feels good for kids, but I'm curious about other options. I'd really appreciate if folks who've been recently (esp with kids!) could weigh in. Basically, I'm debating between the following:  

* Fly in/out of Cartagena: Spend 1 week on the coast 
* Same as above, with 3-4 days in San Andres
* Arrive Cartagena and spend 3 days there; fly to Pereira and spend 3 days in Coffee Zone; fly to Bogota or Medellin for last full day before flying home
* Same as above, but instead of Coffee Zone go somewhere else after Cartagena

I'm a female Non-EU student in (you guessed it) the EU, early 20s, second year of my bachelors degree. Last week I had, what I can only describe as, a rude awakening realising I genuinely cannot afford to be in love. 

Once I graduate, I look for a job.  
Once I get a job, I look for a masters.  
Once I get a masters, I get a better job.

This is easily another 4-5 year plan or more, horribly simplified that doesn't account for moving across the country, trying my damned hardest to find housing in this crisis, needing a company to sponsor my residency, job crisis and to top it all off, I still struggle to make myself dinner (but this feels ridiculous and quite minor next to all of that, so honestly I'm not too worried).

The problem comes with being incredibly lonely. Which is not new! I get that! I'm an only child and I think I deal with being lonely surprisingly well, or so I tell myself. Though I'm not very ""interesting"" (in HEAVY air quotes). I don't drink, party, smoke, do drugs, none of that- and that feels like a very common Uni experience. People I've known since I was 14-15 (whether online or irl) are now drinkers, smokers, heavy party people, having one-night stands, you get it. They feel so different from me now, and they seem to integrate into university social life so well (whether that's true or not is up for debate, because I know they all individually have a bag of problems, don't we all?)

Sometimes when I listen to their stories, or am myself in a party or a club (very rare), I feel like such an alien. I could be at home working on that assignment, or meal prepping, or finally doing my dishes. Meanwhile someone on my left has just downed their 8th shot and the one on my right has popped a tit. It's a bizarre feeling. It oscillates from wishing I was like them to wishing I was home.

I'll see all my friends and people at Uni dating and forming close friendships and I feel this blanketed feeling of envy. I don't feel consumed by it, yet, but it's always there in the back of my mind. I think it's nice that they can date freely, without worrying about borders, visas, partner visas, sponsorships, you name it. Because honestly? I feel like this is all I ever think about, the logistics of how me pursuing a relationship with someone would work. It feels wrong to get in a relationship for fun, or because of butterflies- I'm just not like that, and sometimes I wish I was. If I date, it's a commitment, financially, emotionally, you name it. It's the whole package. I am always the whole package.

And when that's too much for people, that's fine, and I understand.

I think I just wish I had the liberty to love and exist like everyone else around me. To go home during breaks, to be able to buy that one coffee instead of counting my monthly expenses, to love and be loved, even with my weak as shit passport.

It's just hard being surrounded by EU citizens who have no thoughts or concerns about the future because, if all else fails, they'll simply go back home. Which they have, numerous times in the past two years, and I haven't gone back home yet- because guess what! I can't exactly afford to. Not even just financially, I feel like emotionally I can't afford to because there's so many considerations to make.

I've occasionally wondered if this was just me wishing I was an EU citizen, but? I think it's more the fact that being an EU citizen allows them grace in their every day life. This isn't about something big like the ability to travel freely or having strong passport or what not. They can just love. Go home. Come back. Break up, try again. (This is an oversimplification, and I am aware.)

I don't really feel like I'll ever have that liberty.

I know I mentioned that this is a 4-5 year plan, and by that time I'll most likely have permanent residency and all will be good, right? Well, not exactly? I will most likely be in a relationship with a foreign man (I'm from butt-fuck middle-of-nowhere Asia), and he'll have his family, and I won't. He'll have his entire support system, and I won't. I've seen this with my own parents, and though I'm sure my father did his best, I saw what it did to my mother. I've already seen how the men I've dated have naturally expected me to go to them, rather than them come to me.

I could go home, marry someone local so that we both have our support systems, but then what did I study abroad for? My degree has no weight there, and hell, I don't know any of the information taught in my native language. I wasn't raised speaking English just to go back anyway. It's... an odd situation.

I am very well aware that being able to study abroad is a privilege, and I absolutely agree. I'm not the first one to have this thought, and I will not be the last. Perhaps this is natural course for immigrants anyway, who knows! In the end, I chose to come here, so I just have to live with it.

At the risk of being emotionally charged, let me just say:  
This shit feels so fucking unfair.

The search committee has made arrangements for me to meet with someone from the university so I can get a sense of what opportunities are out there related to my field (health).

I'm not sure what to expect or how to prepare. Do I bring a resume with me? I don't know if this is presumptuous because  my spouse is only at the interview stage, so there has been no offer.

I'm also a little nervous given the political climate to have a printed resume in my possession when crossing the border. I'm not actively looking for a job, I'm just meeting with someone because I feel like I have to.  I don't want to come across as ungrateful for the opportunity to talk to someone, but I'm only on the trip to support my spouse.

1jmqxcu,https://www.reddit.com/r/DungeonCrawlerCarl/comments/1jmqxcu/theory_psmanthesamanthas_true_nature_has/,Theory:  Psmanthe/Samantha's true nature has implications beyond the dungeon,"While I was re-reading passages to compile my [*other* theory post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DungeonCrawlerCarl/comments/1jmovlz/a_theory_about_primal_reproduction/) about Primal reproduction just now, a line caught my eye.

Quoting Paulie's words to Carl:

> ""**You and all living things born on one of the pre-seeded worlds has a miniature, primal system built into your brains that allows you to interact with the system. It is the size of a grain of sand.** Once these systems are activated, they are able to be harvested. The way it was designed is that you would be born, you would live, and you would eventually die. When you do you pass on, the element within you, having grown and filled with the energy of a lifetime, would return to the system, allowing it to keep running. A healthy system is self-sustaining. It doesn't grow. It doesn't shrink. It exists in perpetuity.""

What *else* do we know is the size of a grain of sand? Samantha's daughter--or, as the War Mages reveal, The *Scavenger's* daughter.

We already know that some of the characters and storylines inside the dungeon are abstractions of real events in the galaxy. In Book 3 Mordecai alludes that the same is true of the in-game deities as well: 

> ""Gods and goddesses. In-game deities. We'll get to what they really are later. You don't need to worry about that on this floor.""

I can't imagine any of the showrunners being insane enough to *intentionally* include multiple primal systems in a crawl. But as we've learned, there are some entities in *Dungeon Crawler World*--like the War Mages--who became part of the game's fabric without the showrunners being involved.

So, I wonder: what if Samantha's child is actually a primal system? Which, in turn, would make Samantha a primal, one who was cast into the real-world Nothing by its peers, but partially escaped it thanks to the in-game events?

(Tangentially, thinking of Emberus storyline so far, I also wonder if ALL the major players in it are actually Primals, which is why the AI is so insistent that Carl solve the mystery of Apito's death. It could be that the solution to the real-world conflict between the primals actually lies within the game, which is what the AI is trying to hint to him.)

Edit: OKAY, so I just read [another comment with the Krakaren origin story](https://www.reddit.com/r/DungeonCrawlerCarl/comments/1gqra0c/comment/lx0fwna/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) that has opened my mind further. Specifically, this bit:

> ""Once upon a time, on a distant planet, there lived a lonely creature. This planet teemed with flora and fauna, all of them growing and evolving and generally thriving and having a great time as they dashed forward through the eons. **This creature also wanted to thrive, she also wanted to have a great time. But there was only one of her. She could not have children of her own. And this made her very angry, very cranky, but also very sad.** More importantly, it made her determined.

> ""And as Doctor Ian Malcom once famously said, Life, uh, finds a way.

> ""The creature had a special ability. Her stomach was like a gas-station coffee vending machine, one where you could pick one of a thousand different choices. You could mix and match. She soon discovered if she ate this creature, she could make this substance. And if she ate that creature, she could make a different one. So she began to experiment. The creatures of her world thought of her as an apothecary. She could cure all ails.

> ""**But what she truly wished for was to create a child of her own. And after a thousand generations, she did just that. Almost. It‚Äôs a complicated process that involves a lot of failures. A lot of troublesome ghouls.** But as another Earth saying goes, you need to crack a few eggs to make an omelet, no?""

EXPANDED THEORY: In Book 7 Samantha mentions that she couldn't get pregnant, and that her best friend Kimaris gave her a potion to put a baby in her. I think Samantha might actually be The Apothecary, whose method of creating new life--and potentially the outcomes of all the ""failures"" along the way--resulted in her being condemned by the other primals and banished to the Nothing. Her escape from it resulted in part of her consciousness becoming the entity now known as the Apothecary and the other part of it becoming Samantha. Only when Samantha is awoken to who/what she truly is can she rejoin with the rest of herself.

However, I admit that that adds some complication to the Agatha/Eulogist/Apothecary storyline. I'd have to sit and think about that for a while to see if/how all of these ideas could be aligned.",4,1743267925.0,DungeonCrawlerCarl,2,1.0,False

1jmqtz5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jmqtz5,Batna-day 5 of posting pics of every Algerian wilaya,"Sorry for the quality. Reddit reduces it due to compression and the number of pics I posted.

Batna:

Gateway to the Aures ‚Äì Batna is basically the capital of the Aures region, home to the Chaoui people. The culture here hits different.

One of Algeria‚Äôs Coldest Cities ‚Äì Winters here can be brutal, sometimes even snowing, but summers? Absolute hellfire.

Built as a Military Base (1844) ‚Äì The French originally built Batna as a military camp before it grew into a full city.

Timgad is Right Next Door ‚Äì This ancient Roman city is like the ‚ÄúPompeii of Africa‚Äù and is crazy well-preserved.

The Aures Mountains Were a Warzone ‚Äì During the Algerian War, the mountains around Batna were a key resistance stronghold against French colonization.

Ghoufi Canyon is Algeria‚Äôs Mini Grand Canyon ‚Äì Just a few hours from Batna, Ghoufi has wild cliffs, caves, and abandoned troglodyte houses.

Home to Lambaesis, an Ancient Roman Military HQ ‚Äì It was a major Roman military base, and you can still see the ruins today.

Zana Cave Has Prehistoric Vibes ‚Äì This place has ancient rock art and signs of early human life from thousands of years ago

Batna‚Äôs Accent is One of a Kind ‚Äì The local Chaoui dialect is like a mix of Arabic and Berber, but with its own twist.

A University City ‚Äì The University of Batna is huge, and the student culture here is pretty active.

Old Markets Meet Modern Caf√©s ‚Äì Walk around and you‚Äôll see traditional souks right next to trendy coffee spots.

Chaoui Music Originated Here ‚Äì If you‚Äôve ever heard Aissa Djermouni, you know how legendary this region‚Äôs music is.

1jmqtx8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canada_Politics/comments/1jmqtx8/from_fb_john_tard_toronto/,From FB - John Tard - Toronto,"UPDATE !!! So I posted my political opinion a few times and its been shared over 35 000 times. Just a simple political opinion with zero namecalling. People are entitled to their opinions but here is the difference. Conservative voters are an angry bunch. I have deleted up to twenty vile private messages so angry and hateful. All because I have an opinion that doesnt coincide with theirs. These messages are increasing in volume . My opinion on this is they are scrambling and angered by the fact they may not get the majority they crave so they take their anger out on whoever they can. Well all they are really accomplishing is pissing off those woke libtards as they like to say enough to get out and not only vote but get everyone they can to vote. Conservatives never miss a vote and this time neither will the liberals and NDP. I can handle the name calling because it just makes them look desperate. I will continue to have an opinion whether they like it or not. Attached is the post that drove them insane and showed their ignorance - John Tard, Toronto 

I am far from being an expert in politics but I know enough to have an opinion. If you truly do love Canada you will see the similarities in Trump and Poilievre. Polilievre is the only candidate supported by Trump and Musk. They are even running the same campaign slogan America first and Canada first. The last three years the Conservative party were a two trick pony. They wanted Trudeau gone and they wanted him to axe the tax and they pounded that into their heads. For years that was the gamechanger. The Conservative voters were all in . Then something terrible happened to the Conservatives Trudeau announces his resignation. After years of leading a strong Majority territory government position focused on the disdain of Trudeaus existence. The Conservatives were in damage control beyond belief. If Trudeau had run in the federal election the Conservatives would have easily skated to a strong majority. Then a guy named Mark Carney appears out of thin air and immediately says he would take the tax off of Canadians. The guy also worked with the Conservatives for almost a decade and was highly regarded by the Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper. Conservatives just dont get the big picture Andrew Scheer was exactly the same as PP and he was completely dismantled after being crushed. Scheer is still
active in all of this. Harper was also responsible for raising the Old Age Security age to 67 and Poilievre would have supported that so I see that coming for sure. So what did I see today that proved to me that the conservatives are spiraling is this . A meme of Mark Carney standing in a hockey net playing goalie. Something he did very well his entire youth. The post was critical at how expensive Carneys shoes were. Hahaha PP has an 18 room house who cares. How is any of this relevant? What matters is what a candidate can do for us not what shoes they are wearing. The Conservatives are spiraling out of control especially with PPs ties to America right now. Canada with Trumps tariffs has made Canada never been more proud to be canadian. We arent idiots we know PPs strong relationship with Trump this is not a secret. This works heavily against the Conservatives. Mark Carney has came straight out and said he wants to negotiate with trump and he hasnt even won the liberal leadership yet. So heres my pick for a federal election once Carney wins the Liberal leadership. My money is on a minority government between the Conservatives and the liberals. Which is unreal because a year ago Conservatives were gloating the Liberals would lose party status. Their preparation was terrible. If the Conservatives win a minority that is a catastrophic loss to the Conservatives. The Liberals get a minority that is an unbelievale outcome for them. Dont even get me started on an alliance thats a whole different conversation. Lastly so many people were not voting Liberal just because they could no longer stand Trudeau. They are coming back to the liberals in droves. So any way you slice this there are gonna be a ton of pissed off Conservatives at the end of this and they have nobody but themselves to blame. F Trudeau flags and Axe the Tax was childsplay and the Liberals are showing the Conservatives how its done and they dont eyen have an official leader yet üá®üá¶

1jmqtvp,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1jmqtvp/psych_ward_and_residential_experience_so_far3/,psych ward and residential experience so far</3,"i‚Äôm sorry this is so long and maybe no one will even read this. i get admitted tonight to do my next 30 days so i won‚Äôt see any replies until i‚Äôm out.

my ex broke up with me and i wasn‚Äôt trying to manipulate him or anything. i jus know he‚Äôs the only person i wanted for the rest of my life. he stopped caring about me, my bpd, and bipolar. i struggled sometimes with communication and i learned that i need to cope when i‚Äôm triggered from past trauma before getting upset. 

i‚Äôve been transferred three times. i was at a psych ward for six days and was extremely suicidal. i didn‚Äôt eat at all and i jus had kool-aid with extra ice. slushy type sht. i left the psych ward and transferred to tennessee residential. it was cool and there was another person that fw smokedope and all the underground artists which was dope cause that‚Äôs all i listen to.

i transferred to michigan residential cause i‚Äôll be moving to michigan once i get out of treatment. i was there for 7 days and made some bonds wit some cool people. my friend gave me some of her meds cause it was a opioid. i put it under my tongue and felt euphoric all day tripping. i fw it hard. i made a painting and deadass forgot a word on the painting. but the environment was like a psych ward so i didn‚Äôt want to stay. so i‚Äôm transferring back to tennessee for 30 days. i‚Äôve been in psych wards and psych residentials for 30 days but i need to stay longer cause i‚Äôm learning so much about my bpd and bipolar. how to handle things differently. 

imma bounce back from this. but i think i‚Äôll always miss him. he impacted my life so much and i‚Äôll always love him. we knew eachother for a year. i miss everything. 60 days is really hard but this relationship was everything to me. 4L type sht. i never meant to be ‚Äútoxic‚Äù was just misunderstood and trouble with communicating due to trauma and having family issues. it sucks he stopped caring. i was always doing lil things and loving him. wish i would‚Äôve did this before i met him cause i‚Äôm changing and realizing so much. it sucks i can‚Äôt share that with him. i‚Äôm not taking off the necklace cause i genuinely love him and ts will hurt for the rest of my life.

i don‚Äôt remember anything without him. but i‚Äôll be living in michigan after treatment and imma be working at a coffee shop for awhile but i want to try and work at hooters or twin peaks. i‚Äôll have to figure out how to hide my wrists tho. imma get my hair dyed and nails done when i‚Äôm out of treatment. i lost a lot of weight. i wear xs shirts and my pants are baggy but i fw my body i got hips and a booty wit a slim waist<3 i sorta developed an eating disorder from this breakup cause he was my safety and he was the closest person to me. ts hurts. i‚Äôll be in tennessee for 30 days. it‚Äôs more chill at that residential. they offer more, there is more freedom, and i was actually learning bout my bpd and bipolar. how to cope and live when i‚Äôm out. i jus got 30 more days. 

they are changing my mgs and discovering what meds work for me. i‚Äôm severely bpd and have bipolar but bpd basically describes me. i‚Äôve realized a lot since i already experienced 30 days. he was manipulative. he said he jus said things to reassure me. that makes me sick. i didn‚Äôt feel pretty to him anymore.  we was intimate doing all types of positions like nights before he broke up with me and it makes me sick thinking he knew it would be the last time. this really messed up my psyche. he said so many things but didn‚Äôt actually care. i was with mentally abusive dudes before him. was SA and raped in one of my relationships. i was cheated on in the most fucked up ways before him. genuinely ruined my personality and confidence. i never cared bout anyone until i met my ex ajax. 

he saved me but started not caring bout me. i don‚Äôt know why. i was jus insecure and felt sad all the time. he didn‚Äôt care bout me or ask if i was taking my meds. stopped understanding why i was upset and jus didn‚Äôt care. i noticed all the lil things he stopped doing which is why i got into a depression slump. imma work on cosmetology school when i get out of treatment 30 more days. i‚Äôll have my JBL headphones and an ipod that downloads my spotify playlists. imma sneak in a cart tho fs. it genuinely helps me. 

when i‚Äôm out i‚Äôll move to michigan immediately cause indiana is jus too traumatizing. imma be better and understand myself better. it jus sucks he isn‚Äôt going to experience the me i‚Äôll be when i‚Äôm out:( i miss him so much. ts traumatizing. 

i‚Äôm struggling but trying not to. nobody will ever be him. i made a new instagram but i probably won‚Äôt be active on anything for awhile. jus focus on moving, listening to lots of music, working, cosmetology school, and going to the gym. i‚Äôm excited cause weed is legal in michigan :p 

‚Äúwhen i‚Äôm six feet underground with bugs eating my brain they will get visions of you. they will smell what you smelt like and they will hear you call my name through a moonlit night. they will experience unimaginable wonders as they feast on the corner of my brain that houses you.‚Äù <3 <3

Are you finally awake hooman?

(‚Ä¶)

You are! that pleases me so much!

(‚Ä¶)

Where are you? You're on my shuttle being taken to my home.

**\[Sounds of struggle\]**

Don't panic hooman! your body is far too small and fragile, you could damage yourself. 

(‚Ä¶)

Well, I guess it *IS* rude to not introduce myself. I am Amirda *(A-Meer-Dah)*, I am the Queen of the Milky Way Galaxy, or at least, your species calls it that.

(‚Ä¶)

The actual name in a way that would make sense in you language, would be the Swirly Pool Galaxy, since it looks like its swirling. You hoomans have such funny names for things in your language, Calling Spherical Ecosystems something as simple as Planets, or considering other beings on the ""planet"" as animals, speaking of, you humans are far from the most intelligent species on your spherical ecosystem, but your societies are the most well known on your spherical ecosystem.

(‚Ä¶)

Aw\~ you little hoomans are so adorable. Even your tallest fellow hoomans aren't up to my shoulders, and he way you look up at me like a little Glorbian is just absolutely adorable. I suppose in the way you'd measure it, I am 11 feets tall, and that's a lot of feets for a hooman!

(‚Ä¶)

speaking of feets, I actually wanted to learn more about your hooman body. May I please take a look at your hayer?

(‚Ä¶)

How do you pronounce it? Hair? Such a silly word, you hoomans have such funny words for things, like arrow plans, and munk ee's.

(‚Ä¶)

You still look so frightened. My poor hooman\~ Everything is okay, I'm with you now\~ You have nothing to worry about dear hooman. I do not wish to harm you, I know your kind is easily frightened by new things, which is why I did my bestest to learn the most common language among hoomans. Though I will say that you hoomans are nowhere near as skittish as the Cobblitors (Cobb-lit-ores), they are scared of their own weather. You hoomans are similar though, some of you hoomans get scared by loud noises when the sky releases its water build up.

(‚Ä¶)

You seem to have calmed down a bit hooman, may I see your hayer- I mean, your hair now?

(‚Ä¶)

Thank you so much hooman! 

**\[Sounds of her brushing around hair.\]**

Your species is very unique... Most creatures on your planet Urath either have their entire bodies covered in hair, or not much at all, but you hoomans have hayer all over your bodies in so many spots, its so fascinating. 

(...)

A funny thing about all you hoomans is how you occasionally cut your hairs, and I find that fascinating and funny, no other creatures ever cut their hairs on other spherical ecosystems.

(‚Ä¶)

Hm? you want me to call them planets? Anything you want hooman. I really do love some words you hoomans have, they sound so funny and weird. 

(‚Ä¶)

Which ones?... Like seereal, it sounds so funny to me, and the word fingars, those are what you call these, on your hand, correct? \[hair brushing stops\], You hoomans are so fascinating, your fingars have these hard surfaces at the tips.

(‚Ä¶)

Fingar nails? This is very similar to other creatures and how they have claws, but your species chose to have your claws be flat and thin, combat against other creatures must be very difficult for your kind, and makes me wonder how your species is the dominant one, if you have no real ways of defending yourself naturally but you hoomans do have many weaknesses that make you very vulnerable.

(‚Ä¶)

Like your peepers, they are so small and easy to pierce, you have no natural armor or exoskeleton, which fascinates me even more since your species has had to compensate by crafting weapons and tools. Can I take a look at your peepers?

(‚Ä¶)

Oh, I forgot that hoomans dislike things around their peepers, even if simple poking doesn't hurt you. I promise hooman, I'll be gentle\~.

(‚Ä¶)

Fine, fine. I won't poke your peeper little hooman. Can you open your mouth for me? I saw something fascinating.

(‚Ä¶)

Please hooman, I promise it's strictly for curiosity, I won't do anything that you won't like... Wait, I got an idea! I am able to shift the mass my body and change my appearance, if you allow me to inspect your mouth, I'll change into anything you want, deal?

(‚Ä¶)

Thank you hooman! Now open wide... Wow. I find it so fascinating that your species has flat chewers, it brings me back to what I said earlier, about your species having no natural defenses. How does your species defend itself hooman?

(‚Ä¶)

Fits? Can you show me what those are?

(‚Ä¶)

Oh... So you... put wrap your fingars under your hand and hit other hoomans with it? That's incredible, yet so barbaric. That's what fascinates me most about your kind. You're all so well advanced for your kind, and yet... how do I put this kindly... Your species is advanced, but you're also very primitive.

(‚Ä¶)

Well yes, I mean... Your species has managed to create what you call Nuclear Power and instead of using it to power your vehiccups, and shelters, you hoomans turn it into these scary beans that blow up other whole civilizations of hoomans. That's another thing. Your species is complex in the fact that if one of the same species is a different color or fancies a matching sex, most hoomans will be outraged by it. Like I said, your technology may be advanced hooman, but your species as a whole is very primitive. I've never seen a species that could colonize another planet in it's Solar System, but chooses to hinder themselves for their worlds currency.

(‚Ä¶)

I'm so sorry hooman, I got carried away, and I did promise you that I'd change for you. What would you like me to shape my body into?

(‚Ä¶)

Don't tell me, I can read your mind and get a clear picture of what you'd like... Oh, she looks pretty, a fictional cartoon hooman girl, I will worn you, I cannot change my voice or size, and I can't hold the form for too long, and it will take a moment for me change form.

(‚Ä¶)

**\[Sounds of jelly flesh\]**

I will need to focus while I do this as well. Let's see... I'll have to somehow give myself hayer, long ooh-range hayer too. very slender arms and tiny waist... And I don't have the ability to change clothes but I can grab my dress and use that instead of her black robe thingy... Now for my face to match... Done.

**\[Jelly noises stop\]**

Do you like it? What is her name again? Ran Geeku? That's an odd hooman name, but remember that I cannot hold this shape for too long.

Alright then, I'll let you admire this form for as long as I can hold it. My Sis-Stars they like to mock me for being unable to hold shape for an extended time. The one hardest on me is my eldest Sis-Star, Tsobee *(So-Bee)*, who is the queen of the Andromeda Galaxy. Our galaxies will be merging in 4 or 5 billion years and that's still too soon. All because our mother doesn't want us to argue anymore, I am the youngest of my Sis-Stars, except for my younger Sis-Star Kwinassa *(Kwin-ass-ah)*, I'm a few million years older than her, and she's queen of the Triangulum Galaxy. I will say that I'm jealous of her since her Galaxy is very beautiful.

(‚Ä¶)

How many Sis-Stars do I have? I have Four Hundred Thousand, Eight Hundred Twenty Three Sis-Stars, all daughters of the universe.

(‚Ä¶)

Broothers? what is that?

(‚Ä¶)

Oh, you mean male sibling, I don't have one, my mother only creates daughters since we are pieces of her, so having broothers is impossible.

**\[Quick jelly flesh sound\]**

(‚Ä¶)

I'm so sorry hooman, I told you that I couldn't hold that form for too long. I hope you enjoyed it though.

(‚Ä¶)

How long can my Sis-Stars hold their forms? Well, out of all of them, my eldest Sis-Star Tsobee can hold hers longest. She likes to rub in that her changes are technically unrestricted, since our mother doesn't like us interacting with mortal beings on their home planets. But if we can morph our bodies to blend in, we can interact all we want, I recently managed to add features my normal form doesn't have like hayer. Tsobee however, can change her size, voice, and clothing, while holding the form for hundreds of years.

(‚Ä¶)

Oh, you hoomans have an odd way of reading time frames. Let me explain, hoomans don't exist very long to me. It's like how hoomans see those flies that live less than an Urath day. To me you are one of those little flies, and I don't mean that as a demeaning term. I just live for centillions of years and you humans don't even live anywhere close to a fraction of that.

(‚Ä¶)

I hope that I didn't upset you with that, I didn't mean that I see you as meaningless little hooman. You make a great companion, like how you hoomans take in lesser being on your planet and call them pets. 

(‚Ä¶)

I also wanted to show you something hooman! Wait here a moment!

**\[Loud steps as she rushes out of the area\]**

(‚Ä¶)

I have a storage bux filled with little things I collected from Urath!

**\[Rummaging\]**

Like this, I think your people call it a Cluck?

(‚Ä¶)

Oh, Clock! Yes, I absolutely loved little thing, In my language it would be called a Gibbungun, it has these slow spinning lines and when they both point up a little critter would pop out and make a funny noise, unfortunately it stopped doing that years ago, I opened the hatch and see that the little creature is still inside but it isn't working, which makes me a bit sad but it's still one of my favorites! I also have this, its like a funny shaped piece of metal that you can bend into so many different shapes, and the ends are pokey.

(‚Ä¶)

A paper clip? what is it used for?

(‚Ä¶)

That's all? that's a little bit of a letdown... I still think its fun to play around with. I also have this, its made of glass and has a hollow inside, I've seen hoomans use these often, you put it up to your mouths and kiss it. I have tried that myself and I kind of see the appeal, feeling the nice cool glass against my lips is pretty satisfying.

(‚Ä¶)

A Coffee Mug? Oh, your kind uses this for your liquid intake, that makes sense I guess. I do find it fascinating that your species has grown to live outside of water, but you have yet to live life without breathing water every now and then.

(‚Ä¶)

I also have this thing, I got it when I grabbed you, I just couldn't resist, it's long and yellow and has these little ridges.

(‚Ä¶)

What did you just say to me?

(‚Ä¶)

What an... interesting word to call this item... for future reference, don't use that word around any Bangadans.

(‚Ä¶)

Well... That Word, is a very offensive term for their people. They were at odds with another species called Appigons, and they'd use that word as in insult before wiping out their peoples.

(‚Ä¶)

Oh, no the war is long over, and their species live in peace.

(‚Ä¶)

But I do love this little yellow thing, it's not too hard or soft and I- huh?

(‚Ä¶)

You want me to give it to you?

(‚Ä¶)

Ok, here. What are you gonn- Hey! you're breaking it!

(‚Ä¶)

It's supposed to do that? It's all white now.

(‚Ä¶)

You want me to do what? Put it in my mouth? Is it edible?

(‚Ä¶)

It is? I'll give it a try then.

(‚Ä¶)

That tastes very bland and flavorless.

(‚Ä¶)

oh, I'm supposed to bite pieces of it off and break it down like hoomans do?

(‚Ä¶)

Oh my, it does taste good. I can't believe that an item with such an offensive name can taste so good.

**\[beeping\]**

(‚Ä¶)

Oh hooman! we're almost to my home! I cannot wait to show you everything I've collected when we get there!

(‚Ä¶)

No, you can't go back to Urath, you're mine now, remember?

(‚Ä¶)

Well I can give you anything you want, you are my hooman now.

(‚Ä¶)

You don't really have any other options hooman. So what can I give you, that will help you adjust to your new home? Don't forget, I'm your Queen, I can give you anything\~

# The brothers Bednar: Two fairy-tale pitching careers, two MLB crossroads

[Stephen J. Nesbitt](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/author/stephen-j-nesbitt/)

March 27, 2025

MARS, Pa. ‚Äî It‚Äôs just after lunch on a snowy January day, and the math teacher in Room 222 is sketching Pascal‚Äôs triangle on the whiteboard.

Andy Bednar did not go to Cornell to teach advanced algebra. He went there to pitch for the baseball team, kick for the football team and study civil environmental engineering. But after spending his 20s sampling soil and groundwater around landfills, Andy, the son of a Pittsburgh steelworker, wanted a job that gave him more time with his kids. So he got his teaching certification and eventually landed this job at Mars Area High, teaching math and coaching Fightin‚Äô Planets baseball and football. Colleagues tease him: ‚ÄúThink you overdid it with the Ivy League degree?‚Äù

Andy and his wife, Sue, still live in the ordinary two-story house they bought when they moved to Mars. Andy has taught in Room 222 since before his current students were born. He‚Äôs beloved in the math and science wing, a big guy with a grin and graying hair who peppers lessons on polynomial functions with corny jokes.

The classroom‚Äôs cinder-block walls are covered with college pennants, most of them gifts from former students away at school. But the pennants hanging in two columns behind Andy‚Äôs desk are different. Amarillo Sod Poodles. Fort Wayne Tincaps. Eugene Emeralds.

This is where Andy tracks his sons‚Äô progression in pro baseball. His oldest, David, is the closer for the hometown Pittsburgh Pirates. His middle child, Will, is a former first-round pick pitching in the San Francisco Giants organization.

The boys and their younger sister, Danielle, a junior at Louisville, all took their dad‚Äôs class in high school. Back then, he was their teacher, coach and parent. He had a habit of delivering advice in a way his kids later termed ‚Äúlife talks.‚Äù Danielle would sense her father winding up and say, ‚ÄúUh-oh. Life talk No. 256. Press play.‚Äù The kids got the crossroad talk ‚Äî¬†*Will, you‚Äôre at a crossroad*¬†‚Ä¶ ‚Äî more times than they can count.

When it comes to baseball, Andy Bednar‚Äôs boys are at a crossroad.

David is coming off the worst year of his career. Following back-to-back All-Star seasons, he lost the closer‚Äôs role late last season when his ERA ballooned to 6.32. He‚Äôs 30 now. The life cycle of a relief pitcher is often brief.

Will, 24, was once a College World Series hero and a big-bonus draft pick. But he has been besieged by injuries and no longer appears on¬†*The Athletic*‚Äôs list of¬†[the Giants‚Äô top 20 prospects](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6122716/2025/02/10/sf-giants-2025-top-20-prospects-keith-law/)¬†or MLB.com‚Äôs list of their¬†[top 30](https://www.mlb.com/news/giants-top-30-prospects-list-2025-preseason). This winter, San Francisco¬†[left Will unprotected](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/live-blogs/mlb-winter-meetings-live-updates-rumors/W56XmYKKFVdA/2ud69bVoGxiO/)¬†in the Rule 5 draft. Any team that believed he belonged on a major league roster could have taken him. None did.

What does a father say now?

No one saw David as a future major leaguer.

He dreamed of playing college ball, like his dad, but didn‚Äôt throw hard in high school. ‚ÄúI had to work extra hard for his recruiting,‚Äù says Andy, who constantly emailed college coaches about David. The few who responded said they wished there was more in the tank.

At a Cornell camp, David had his best day yet, hitting 88 mph and striking out batter after batter. Afterward, Andy heard his alma mater‚Äôs pitching coach deliver a deflating verdict: ‚ÄúI think that fastball is a little flat.‚Äù

‚ÄúAfter he said that, it was like Charlie Brown‚Äôs teacher,‚Äù Andy says. ‚ÄúAll I heard was wah, wah, wah.‚Äù

David settled for a partial scholarship at Lafayette College in Easton, Pa., a program that had only one drafted player reach the majors (Jeff Mutis). Over the next two years, David grew stronger, threw harder and started noticing his stuff was as good as guys who were getting drafted.

Until then, David‚Äôs career resembled his dad‚Äôs. Andy grew up watching his own father, George, leave with a lunch sack each morning to clock in at the steel mill. He came home dirty and tired but always in time to coach Andy‚Äôs baseball teams. They both loved the game and the Pirates, so it felt like a dream when Andy pitched at a tryout camp at Three Rivers Stadium in the 1980s. But Andy never had a real shot at pro ball. Now David did.

The summer after his junior year, David waited out a rain delay in the Cape Cod collegiate summer league as the picks from the 2016 MLB Draft ticked by on the stadium loudspeaker. He lost hope after the 30th round. Then came a text from a San Diego Padres scout:¬†*Are we still good?*

The Padres took David in the 35th round, with the 1,044th pick. (The draft now goes only 20 rounds.) San Diego gave David a $50,000 signing bonus and covered the cost of his remaining year of college. ‚ÄúI was playing with house money,‚Äù he says. The Padres sent David to Pasco, Wash., and told him if he got outs, he‚Äôd move up. Ten scoreless innings later, he was the first player in the Padres draft class to be promoted.

Will‚Äôs path to pro ball was nothing like that.

College coaches started calling after Will hit 90 mph at 16. He committed to Ohio State, then reconsidered as scholarship offers rolled in from around the ACC and SEC. ‚ÄúThat felt like the big leagues to me,‚Äù Will says. Doors opened that had been closed for David. Will threw at showcases at Fenway Park and Tropicana Field. Scouts came by the house. Mail arrived from college programs around the country; one was a poster of Nick Saban with a speech bubble saying, ‚ÄúWill, come to Alabama.‚Äù

Once, after Will had an awful start on a sweltering summer day, his AAU coach, Frank Merigliano ‚Äî a former Chicago White Sox farmhand and one of Andy‚Äôs best friends ‚Äî took the team behind the dugout and laid into Will. Called him out of shape. Lazy. Entitled. Puffed up by the attention. He was right.

Sue heard the whole thing. ‚ÄúA stern lecture,‚Äù she says. Will corrects her: ‚ÄúThe ass-tearing of a lifetime. But that flipped a switch for me.‚Äù Sometimes, Andy learned, they need to hear the life talk from someone else.

The expectations and pressure placed upon Will soared not only because of the promise of his right arm, but also because of what his big brother already had accomplished. The week Will started classes at Mississippi State, he watched from a dorm room as David debuted for the Padres.

As a college freshman, coming back from a biceps injury that had wiped out his last high school season, Will was stuck at the back of the Bulldogs pitching pecking order. He was anxious.¬†*You‚Äôre going to get a chance*, Andy told him,¬†*just focus on making the most of it*.

Then two starters ahead of Will ‚Äî Brandon Smith and J.T. Ginn ‚Äî underwent Tommy John surgery. In his first start, Will pitched into the sixth inning and held Quinnipiac to one run. The next week, the season was canceled due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Back home, Will and Andy built a pitching mound in the backyard ‚Äî beside the batting cage that‚Äôs been there since the kids were little ‚Äî so Will could throw bullpens. When he returned to Mississippi State for his sophomore season, Will was pitching like an ace.

At the 2021 College World Series in Omaha, Neb., Andy paced the concourse as Will started the opener and struck out 15 over six innings against Texas. That week, after collecting his first MLB win, David was asked which feat was more impressive. ‚ÄúI think my brother takes the cake,‚Äù he replied, smiling.

Will beat Texas again in his next start, then took the ball on three days‚Äô rest for the winner-take-all against Vanderbilt‚Äôs Kumar Rocker. Will threw six no-hit innings, and the Bulldogs rolled. After extracting himself from the celebratory dogpile, Will was named the College World Series‚Äô Most Outstanding Player.

Suddenly, Will‚Äôs schedule was full of pre-draft calls with major league clubs.

‚ÄúThe College World Series freakin‚Äô skyrocketed me,‚Äù he says.

On draft night, Andy was nervous. Not because of the draft, exactly, but because the window air-conditioning units he was running to cool the crowded living room tended to trip the circuit breaker. It was a bad time to lose power. There was a laptop on the armoire sending a live feed of the family‚Äôs reaction to MLB Network‚Äôs studios.

Will kept stepping outside to talk to his agent.¬†[The Giants](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6233874/2025/03/27/sf-giants-2025-best-case-scenario/)¬†wanted him at No. 14. The agent said the club‚Äôs first offer was $3 million. He told them no. ‚ÄúI was like,¬†*You did what?!*‚Äù Will recalls, laughing. San Francisco upped the offer to $3.5 million, then $3.65 million. Will walked back inside and had his parents sit beside him. There they were on TV. The circuit breaker held.

David was late coming back from a road series. He listened on his phone as he sped north on Interstate 79. He pulled into the driveway and sprinted toward Will. ‚ÄúThat hug,‚Äù Danielle says. ‚ÄúThinking about it makes me want to cry.‚Äù

The message said that she should go drink bleach.

That‚Äôs how Danielle found out one day last summer David had blown a road game. From a stranger on Instagram. Danielle never guessed she‚Äôd catch strays from a fan base turning on its hometown closer, but as an intern with the Pirates public relations staff last year, she had heard discontentment brewing as soon as the season started. She was in the PNC Park press box April 9 when David imploded for his third blown save in four opportunities. The boos startled her.

‚ÄúI was like,¬†*Oh my God, they‚Äôre booing my sibling*,‚Äù she says.

That was not an outcome the Bednars had imagined the evening of Jan. 18, 2019, when Will texted the family group chat:¬†*Is this real??*¬†The Pirates had just traded starter Joe Musgrove to the Padres, his hometown team, and the latest report included David among the five players headed to Pittsburgh.

‚ÄúI thought it was a joke,‚Äù Andy says. David warned his family not to believe anything until he heard from one of the general managers. But in the living room back home, his parents and Danielle looked at each other, jittery with joy. ‚ÄúThis is what you dream about,‚Äù Danielle says. ‚ÄúDavid is a Pirate.‚Äù

As boos rained down on April 9, Danielle felt heads turn in the press box to watch her reaction. In the stands, her parents stewed. They are used to anonymous trolls on the internet judging their sons. It‚Äôs different in person.

David had an 11.70 ERA in April. When he called after games, Andy and Sue didn‚Äôt bring up baseball. David didn‚Äôt either.

At the same time, Will‚Äôs back was flaring up again. He started the season on the injured list, where he‚Äôd spent much of the previous two seasons because of recurring back issues. When he returned to the mound, the Giants capped him at two innings per start. Just two years after being ranked the Giants‚Äô No. 5 prospect by [MLB.com](http://MLB.com), what now mattered most for Will was simply staying healthy.

Later in the summer, Will saw that he wasn‚Äôt scheduled to start the following week. He asked a coach whether he should go out to the bullpen instead of watching from the dugout. The answer: Yes. The longer, unspoken answer: He was a relief pitcher now.

One day late last July, Andy sat at a Mars coffee shop with his planner and a pen, mapping out David‚Äôs games, Will‚Äôs games, Fightin‚Äô Planets baseball practices and other high school events where he operates the clock. Things had settled down. David had a 1.85 ERA since April. Will had ascended from Low-A San Jose to High-A Eugene to Double-A Richmond. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs surreal to have him on the East Coast,‚Äù Andy said before hopping in his Nissan Pathfinder and driving to Will‚Äôs road game in Altoona, Pa.

Will gave up four runs that night. David allowed runs in his next six outings.

When Andy coached his kids, he felt some measure of control. He had answers. When things go wrong now, he feels helpless. ‚ÄúAs a parent watching,‚Äù he says, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do anything.‚Äù That, he‚Äôs come to learn, is part of watching your kids grow up. He can‚Äôt always help them, but they have each other. No one understands Will like David, or David like Will. No one supports them like Danielle.

David is 6 years older than Will, and 9 years older than Danielle, age gaps large enough that the siblings weren‚Äôt always close. But baseball and time have brought them closer. When Andy has a pointer for Will, he often asks David or Danielle to call. David talks about mental resiliency, about how getting punched in the mouth can lead to a breakthrough. Danielle tells Will, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the same guy who had 15 Ks against Texas. You‚Äôre the same guy who won the College World Series MVP. You are that guy.‚Äù

She doesn‚Äôt give David the same reminders. (‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt micromanage a 30-year-old on his feelings when he has a wife and a house and a kid,‚Äù 21-year-old Danielle says.) But Will was happy to take a turn lending support. Admittedly, it‚Äôs a weird balancing act for a minor leaguer, texting your big-league big brother about bouncing back. ‚ÄúI just remind him,‚Äù Will says, ‚Äúthat the s‚Äî won‚Äôt last forever.‚Äù

A few miles from the high school, the brothers park their trucks and crunch along the snow-covered sidewalk toward the entrance of a baseball training facility. They start by stretching, then toss a football back and forth before throttling down to a baseball, their small talk interrupted by the intermittent sound of a ball smacking a mitt.

David is warm and chatty, like their dad. Will is quieter, with their mom‚Äôs sarcasm. He lives with his parents in the offseason, while David has a home nearby in Pittsburgh‚Äôs North Hills with his wife and infant son.

In the weight room, David drops into a plank pose and moves the length of an agility ladder, hand to hand, down and back, pausing only when Will cracks a joke. ‚ÄúHey, lock in,‚Äù Will barks, still grinning. ‚ÄúThis is our job.‚Äù David doubles his tempo to the finish, then jumps to his feet.

‚ÄúCan‚Äôt let my little brother beat me,‚Äù he says.

Afterward, over breakfast, Will tries capturing what it‚Äôs like being at this career crossroad. He searches for words for a few seconds, then says, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs kind of fun. It‚Äôs what you sign up for. When you come into pro ball, you think it‚Äôs going to go a certain way: X, Y, Z, and I‚Äôll be in the big leagues. But it doesn‚Äôt happen that way. It‚Äôs given me a little reality check, just to be grateful to be in this position. I‚Äôm going to give it everything I‚Äôve got. I just want to know I did everything in my power to be the best I can be.‚Äù

Will is aware of the perception that he‚Äôs part of the Giants‚Äô long line of first-round failures. But he has not lost hope. He is healthy and invigorated. He‚Äôs at home on the mound again. If he gets outs, he‚Äôll move up.

David has always been calm in the face of challenges. He‚Äôs the guy no one recruited. The guy drafted in the 35th round. The guy who went from non-prospect to closing for his hometown team. Why start worrying now?

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to be better off for last year,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so blessed to have this opportunity. I want to make the most of it. I want to make everybody supporting me proud. I worked hard for this.‚Äù

Later, Will sits down to a home-cooked dinner of roast beef sandwiches and sweet potato fries with his parents. Moose, the 160-pound Great Pyrenees that Andy and Sue got after realizing they weren‚Äôt ready for an entirely empty nest, tries sneaking a bun off the table while Sue says grace. The dining room decor includes Will‚Äôs College World Series Most Outstanding Player trophy, cases of Iron City beer featuring David‚Äôs likeness and the line¬†*Bring it home, Bednar!*, and an unopened Rapsodo pitch-tracking camera. The lineup card from David‚Äôs first MLB win hangs on a wall around the corner.

When Will leaves the room briefly, Sue says softly, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been really nice having him here.‚Äù

Andy nods. It‚Äôs been a good winter in Mars. The Bednar boys are nearby, and closer than ever. Andy and Sue are grandparents now, too. Baseball has given them some of the best days of their lives. They‚Äôve had a front-row seat as their children chase childhood dreams. They‚Äôve seen them win and lose, fall and get back on their feet.

But Andy knows baseball. He understands, objectively, where his sons stand. David went to spring training to regain the closer‚Äôs role. He turned in a 10.13 ERA. Teams have a short leash with relievers making $5.9 million, even if they grew up down the road. Will is expected to return to Double-A Richmond, still two steps from the majors.

So what does a father say now?

Before the Bednar boys left for spring training, there was a going-away dinner at a local steakhouse. There was so much Andy could tell his sons.¬†*Life talk No. 256. Press play.*¬†But Andy didn‚Äôt give another life talk. His sons know they‚Äôre at crossroads. They don‚Äôt need their dad to tell them that. Failing is part of baseball life, and so is figuring it out for yourself. After dinner, Andy hugged his sons. He said he was proud of them. He made plans to see them soon.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sad they‚Äôre leaving,‚Äù Sue says, ‚Äúbut it‚Äôs time to go.‚Äù",5,1743267387.0,buccos,5,0.86,False

I‚Äôm curious ‚Äî for those of you who are into coffee (or any hobby, really), has it ever become a social thing for you too? Like, do your friends now rely on you to bring the ‚Äúgood stuff‚Äù? Or maybe you‚Äôve found yourself unexpectedly hosting little coffee rituals wherever you go?

## Exploring the Shades ‚Å§of‚Å§ Pink: ‚ÄçFrom Pastel ‚Äãto ‚Å§Rose‚Äå Gold

The ‚Å£world of pink Nespresso machines offers‚Å£ a ‚Å§surprising range of ‚Å§shades and finishes, ensuring there's a ‚Äåperfect ‚Å¢match for every taste and d√©cor style.

*   **Pastel Pink Nespresso ‚Å¢Machine:** ‚Å£For a soft and subtle touch, a **pastel pink Nespresso machine** is an ‚Å¢excellent choice. This delicate hue‚Å¢ exudes serenity and elegance, blending seamlessly with minimalist or Scandinavian-inspired kitchens. It's a calming presence on ‚Äåyour countertop, perfect for those peaceful morning coffee rituals.

*   **Blush‚Äã Pink Coffee maker:** Slightly warmer than pastel pink,‚Å§ a **blush ‚Äçpink‚Å§ coffee‚Å£ maker** brings a touch of ‚Å£romance ‚Å¢and sophistication to your kitchen.‚Å¢ This shade is‚Äã incredibly‚Å§ versatile, complementing both light and dark color palettes.

*   **Rose Gold‚Å§ Nespresso:** If‚Å§ you're looking for a touch of luxury ‚Å£and glamour, a **rose gold Nespresso** is the ‚Äãultimate‚Å£ statement ‚Å¢piece.‚Äå The metallic finish adds a touch of opulence to your coffee ‚Äåroutine, making every cup feel like a special occasion.

## Nespresso‚Å¢ Vertuo vs. Original‚Å§ Line: Which‚Äç Pink Machine Is Right for You?

Nespresso offers two distinct machine lines: Vertuo and Original. Understanding the differences between these‚Äå lines is ‚Å§crucial in choosing the right **pink Nespresso machine** for your‚Å¢ coffee preferences.

**Nespresso Vertuo:**

*  ‚Å£ **Coffee Style:** Vertuo machines ‚Å¢are designed to brew ‚Å¢both espresso and larger‚Å¢ cups ‚Å¢of coffee using Nespresso's ‚Å§patented Centrifusion‚Ñ¢ ‚Äãtechnology. This technology spins the capsule‚Äã at high ‚Å¢speeds, extracting ‚Äçevery nuance of‚Å§ flavor ‚Äåand creating a rich, generous crema.
*   **Cup Sizes:** Vertuo machines‚Äå offer a wider range of cup sizes, from single espresso shots ‚Äãto full mugs of coffee. Some models‚Å£ even‚Å¢ offer carafe-sized options for sharing.
*  ‚Å£ **Capsule Variety:** Vertuo capsules are larger and dome-shaped,‚Äå containing‚Äå more coffee grounds than Original Line capsules. They are designed to be recognized ‚Äçby‚Å§ the machine via a barcode, which automatically adjusts the ‚Äãbrewing parameters for‚Äç optimal extraction.
*   **Model‚Äå Availability:** You ‚Äçare much more likely to find a **pink nespresso vertuo** option than an Original line pink ‚Å¢machine. The Vertuo Pop+ in Candy ‚ÄãPink is a popular option.

**Nespresso Original Line:**

* ‚Äã  **Coffee‚Å¢ Style:**‚Å£ Original Line machines focus primarily on espresso-based drinks, offering a classic Italian espresso experience.
* ‚Äã  **Cup sizes:** These machines typically brew espresso (1.35 oz) and lungo ‚Å¢(3.7 ‚Å§oz) sizes.
*   **Capsule Variety:**‚Äç Original Line capsules are smaller and more widely available.Their patented ‚Äçhigh-pressure extraction system delivers ‚Å¢a concentrated ‚Äçand flavorful espresso.
*   **Compatibility:** Because the Original Line has been around longer, there are more third-party capsule options‚Å§ available.

**Which Line ‚Å£Should You Choose?**

*   **Vertuo:** Ideal‚Å£ if you‚Å¢ enjoy both espresso and larger cups of coffee and ‚Äåappreciate a smooth, rich ‚Äãcrema.
*‚Å¢   **Original Line:** Best for those who‚Äå primarily drink espresso-based beverages and prefer a classic, intense ‚Äçespresso experience.

Ultimately, the best choice depends on your personal coffee‚Å¢ preferences ‚Å§and‚Å¢ drinking habits. If you are specifically looking for a **pink nespresso machine**, you‚Äç will ‚Äålikely find a wider‚Å§ array of options within‚Äç the Vertuo‚Å¢ line.

Proof of concept,"As a apartment (or in my case: bathroom) woodworker, resawing stock and getting parts true and square is actually the hardest part of any project for me. Recently I used a kataba to rip a slab of ash into two thinner boards to make a coffee table. It took me a ridicolous amount of time and sweat plus some more hours to clean up the uneven surfaces afterwards (these will make for very interesting undersides).

Yet when I was looking for better ways to do this, I didn't really find one. If you know something, please tell me. Getting some giant vintage handsaw or that expensive Roubo frame saw kit doesn't appeal to me.

https://preview.redd.it/ult96vc3vnre1.jpg?width=2250&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=378e5cc7f341b0fe7aba441edb0f73d56631f807

So I tried to come up with something else and built this crappy prototype today. It's made from a 600 mm frame saw blade and cutoffs from an Ikea particle board tabletop, just to see if it could work. I tried it on a piece of ash and it took me a little less than an hour to cut off a slice (about 35 x 23 cm).

https://preview.redd.it/z035wkd4vnre1.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=29c15bb4a435036338b4711891188a4669632b0f

Considering that the particle board frame is not exactly precision work and I put way too little effort into getting the surface of the wood flat before starting to saw (I actually didn't plan on cutting through the whole thing at first), I'm very happy with the result! Pushing the saw requires mostly leg movement, it was actually quite meditative and relaxing work. A breeze compared to my previous kataba battle.

There's much room for improvement obviously (ergonomics...). I already have quite a few ideas of my own but I'd be happy to hear your thoughts on this before I build a better version.

My husband and I have been married for almost 10 months now. We got married a week before Eid. In our culture, the men usually pass out money to family. We went to my in laws house and that‚Äôs what he did. Then, we just went to a park, took pics, then ate at a restaurant. When we got home, I noticed he didn‚Äôt give me money like he did everyone else, but honestly I didn‚Äôt mind at the moment.

 Fast forward to recently, he is opening a shop and we‚Äôre living on the money he got on our wedding and his savings. He had a good amount saved, but not much for extra things. That‚Äôs when I decided to get a job, because I don‚Äôt want to spend his money if he doesn‚Äôt have much in the first place. I realized that he purposely avoids getting coffee/breakfast when I‚Äôm with him and gets a bit irritated  when I ask, reminding me that he doesn‚Äôt have much money, but whenever hes by himself he gets him some coffee or food. It makes me feel like I‚Äôm kind of unimportant to him. 

I don‚Äôt know anything about his bank account or finances and sometimes I feel like he only tells me that so I don‚Äôt use too much of his money and that he has a lot more than he makes it seem. Also now that I‚Äôm working, he expects me to buy everything on my own which is understandable, but it would feel good knowing he wants to spend on me rather than avoiding it as much as possible. 

His mom gave him $1k which I had no idea about until months later. Is it weird that I‚Äôm expecting him to tell me things like that? Or is him keeping things like that a secret is normal? He also never tells me things about his life, even small things like he made an appointment for ____ due to him feeling like___. I know they‚Äôre small stuff but I feel like they‚Äôre things you should discuss with your partner. Also him ordering an Eid outfit. I had no idea about it until he was expecting it to arrive.

I expressed to him how it makes me feel and he apologized and said he will do it more often.

Also he never really reaches out to me or checks on me whenever I‚Äôm gone for a good amount of time. For example I used to go to uni from 10 am up to 7 pm, and he doesn‚Äôt even send me one text to see how I‚Äôm doing. Most of the time it was ME texting him, genuinely because I missed him and wanted to see how he‚Äôs doing. 


Or when I would go to my parents house and stay the entire day, he feels no need to text me. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm asking for too much but it would make me feel like he thinks about me and I‚Äôm important to him if he would only send one text. Anyway, since I have no access to his bank accounts I genuinely have no idea what he does or buys, and seeing him order things without feeling the need to tell me makes me feel like he spends more money on himself but doesn‚Äôt tell me so that I don‚Äôt ask for anything. Basically he wants to keep his extra money for himself. 

Also I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm being dramatic but during the day he told me that he was going to pray at this other mosque and it‚Äôs a bit far away. He said it like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to this masjid for taraweeh it‚Äôs a little far.‚Äù We go to the masjid together as a couple, so him wording it like ‚ÄúI‚Äù  was odd.

## Key Features Analysis

The effectiveness of a tea dispenser laser label hinges on several key features that go beyond mere aesthetics. These features ensure durability,readability,and seamless integration wiht the dispenser itself.

**Material Durability:** A crucial aspect of tea dispenser label design is the material used. Laser-printable materials such as polypropylene (PP) and polyester (PET) with specialized topcoats receive greater preference for their resistance to moisture, temperature fluctuations, and abrasion.

These materials ensure that the labels remain intact and legible even under demanding conditions, such as frequent handling and exposure to steam.The adhesive backing is equally important, needing to provide strong adhesion to various dispenser surfaces without leaving residue upon removal.

**Print Resolution and Clarity:** Laser printing allows for exceptionally high print resolution, making it possible to incorporate intricate designs, fine details, and small text sizes without sacrificing readability. Labels shoudl feature clear, sharp graphics and text that are easy to read at a glance, even from a distance.

The contrast between the printed elements and the background material is crucial, as is the use of high-quality inks that resist fading and smudging. This ensures that the label remains visually appealing and informative throughout its lifespan.

**Adhesive Strength and Application:** The adhesive used on tea dispenser labels must strike a balance between strong adhesion and ease of application. It should adhere securely to both smooth and slightly textured surfaces without wrinkling or bubbling.

Furthermore,the adhesive should be resistant to temperature changes and humidity,preventing the label from peeling or lifting over time. Some advanced adhesives also offer repositionable qualities during the initial application, allowing for easy correction of placement errors.

**Variable Data Printing Capabilities:** Modern tea dispenser label designs often incorporate variable data printing (VDP) capabilities, allowing for the inclusion of unique information on each label, such as batch numbers, expiry dates, or promotional codes. Laser printers excel at VDP, enabling the efficient and cost-effective production of customized labels.

This feature is particularly useful for traceability and quality control purposes, as well as for running targeted marketing campaigns. the ability to dynamically update information on labels can also help tea brands comply with regulatory requirements and consumer preferences.

**Compatibility With Laser Printers:** Not all label materials are created equal when it comes to laser printing. High-quality laser labels are specifically engineered to withstand the high heat and pressure of the laser printing process without warping, melting, or causing print defects.These labels typically feature smooth, uniform surfaces and are free from imperfections that could interfere with print quality. They are also designed to prevent static build-up, which can cause paper jams and other printing problems.

## Core Benefits

Utilizing thoughtfully designed laser labels on tea dispensers goes beyond simple identification; it delivers notable, tangible benefits to both the buisness and the end-user. These benefits contribute to improved efficiency,enhanced brand recognition,and a better overall experience.

**Enhanced Brand Visibility:** Custom laser labels featuring distinctive logos, color schemes, and branding elements can substantially boost brand visibility and recognition. A well-designed label acts as a mini-billboard, constantly reminding consumers of the brand and its values.

For example, a tea brand known for its organic and sustainable practices could use labels featuring natural imagery and eco-friendly certifications to reinforce its brand message. This consistent visual branding helps to create a strong and memorable brand identity, driving customer loyalty and repeat business.

**Improved Customer Service and Information:** Laser labels can be used to provide clear and concise information about the tea variety, brewing instructions, ingredients, and nutritional information. This helps customers make informed choices and enjoy their tea to the fullest extent.

As a notable example, a label could include a QR code that directs customers to a website or app with more detailed information about the tea's origin, flavor profile, and health benefits. Providing easy access to this information enhances the customer experience and builds trust in the brand.

**Streamlined Inventory Management:** With variable data printing, laser labels can be used to track inventory levels and prevent stockouts. Labels can include batch numbers, expiry dates, and other relevant information that helps businesses manage their tea supplies efficiently.

For example, a tea distributor can use labels to track the movement of tea dispensers from the warehouse to the point of sale. This enables them to monitor inventory levels in real-time, identify slow-moving products, and optimize their supply chain.

**Reduced Waste and Cost Savings:** By providing accurate and up-to-date information on the labels, businesses can reduce waste and save money. Clear and concise instructions on brewing methods can minimize errors and prevent tea from being wasted.

Moreover, using durable and long-lasting labels reduces the need for frequent replacements, further contributing to cost savings. VDP capabilities also allow for the efficient printing of only the required number of labels, minimizing waste and reducing inventory costs.

## FAQs Section

Below are some commonly asked questions regarding tea dispenser laser labels.

**What Type Of Laser Printer Is Best for Printing These Labels?**
A monochrome or color laser printer with a print resolution of at least 600 DPI (dots per inch) is recommended for optimal results. The printer should also be compatible with the label material and capable of handling the label's thickness without jamming.Some models are specifically designed for printing labels and offer features such as automatic label detection and adjustable print settings.**Can These Labels Be Used outdoors?**
While some laser label materials are more resistant to the elements than others, it is generally not recommended to use them outdoors for prolonged periods without additional protection. Exposure to direct sunlight, rain, and extreme temperatures can cause the labels to fade, peel, or deteriorate. If outdoor use is necessary, consider laminating the labels or using a specialized UV-resistant material.

**What Are Common Pitfalls To Avoid When Designing Labels?**
Common pitfalls include using fonts that are too small or difficult to read, overcrowding the label with too much information, using colors that lack sufficient contrast, and neglecting to proofread the label for errors. It is indeed also critically important to choose a label material and adhesive that are compatible with the specific dispenser surface and intended use environment.

After paying all of the bills, not including gas or food, I have $14 a day I can spend.  I already spent it on food.  She knows this.

Well, I dont want to deal with her aggressive attitude, so I tell her I'll get them, but I just won't eat tomorrow.  Her response?  ""Then don't eat.""

So, I go down to the local Walmart and pick up a flavor and bring it back.  I set it on the counter and retire to my son's room (because I'm not allowed to share our bed because she says I snore, even though both the kids and I agree she is the snorer, but whatever).  A little bit later, she bursts in and throws the smelly stuff at me and scolds me for not getting the right brand.  OK, that's my fault, I guess, but when I had asked her what to get she didn't want to talk to me.  I tried.

So, I go down, with written instruction this time, and get her what she wants.  I'm over budget, but I just won't eat, right?  I go to bed.

I wake up the next day, hoping that it's a new day, we can just be happy or something.  I need to shower before work.  I have my work clothes staged on the bathroom counter, pop into the kitchen to get a cup of coffee ready to go and come back to a locked bathroom.  ""Are you going to be a bit?  I gotta get a quick shower"" ""I don't care, I'm in here"".

Ok..  So I get another set of clothes, get dressed, and head out.

So, tonight and tomorrow at work, I have to do inventory.  I manage a mom and pop butcher shop, and my 11-7 shift will be an 11-10ish tonight and then however long it takes me, 5a-whenever to finish the bulk of the counting, input it and get it ready to compare our standings.  I'm actually grateful for this opportunity to not be around her.  Honestly, the only reason I am with her is for the kids.  I don't want them to know a broken home the way I did, they deserve nothing but love.

I know this is going to sound desperate but that‚Äôs because it is! Haha So here it is‚Ä¶my desperate attempt at making friends. 

I‚Äôm 37 (almost 38-few more months) and although I have friends, I don‚Äôt have many and I‚Äôm trying to change that. And listen it‚Äôs 2025 and you can find everything on the internet so why not some cool people? 

Basically I‚Äôm just gonna list things about myself‚Ä¶here we go:  

*I am a mom of three. 

*I am from Upstate NY, the capital district area to be exact. 

*I love coffee. I will drink it any time of day. I will never say no to coffee. Coffee is one of my love languages. 

*420 galüò∂‚Äçüå´Ô∏èüí®

*I love Disney, Harry Potter, The Big Bang Theory, Stranger Things, Shoresy and cooking shows.

*I am a HUGE hockey fan. NJ Devils is my fave team. I go to see the Utica Comets and Adirondack Thunder as well. I have been to many games and it‚Äôs just an amazing sport!

*I like video games but I wouldn‚Äôt consider myself a gamer. 

*I love to read but I‚Äôm kind of picky on what I like and I don‚Äôt read as often as I‚Äôd like. Big fantasy fan. 

*I love music. Was born and raised on county. 90s country has a special place in my heart. But as well as country I do listen to other stuff as well. It‚Äôs kind of an eclectic mix. MGK, City and Color, Imagine Dragons are the main ones but lots of other pop/rock/alternative stuff as well. 

*Love camping and fishing. Wish I did both more often. I don‚Äôt really have anyone to go fishing with. My bf is SO not a fishing kind of guy lol 

*Love to cook and bake. My dream is to open a coffee shop/cafe someday. 

*BIG fan of emojis, gifs and memes lol 

Ok‚Ä¶I think that‚Äôs enough about me‚Ä¶now here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm looking for ideally:

*Someone 30+ preferably

*Male or female doesn‚Äôt matter but I do have a bf and am not looking!

*Preferably a fellow parent

*Preferably lives close to me so we could actually hang out eventually. But I am always open to online friendships as well!

1jmqaet,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1jmqaet/glucose_test_advice/,Glucose Test Advice‚ú®,"Nurse here. I see a ton of posts on here about the glucose tolerance test. It seems to provoke a lot of anxiety, as many women are afraid of not passing. 

Background: Most providers order the standard 1 hr test. If you don‚Äôt pass the 1 hr test, you‚Äôll likely have to move on to the 2 hr test. If that is still elevated, they‚Äôll likely run tests to confirm a diagnosis of Gestational Diabetes (GD). Failing the glucose test does not necessarily mean you‚Äôre doing anything wrong during pregnancy‚Äîit can happen to anyone. It typically is based on how your body handles pregnancy, which is out of our control. So although it‚Äôs referred to as a ‚Äúpass or fail‚Äù test, we only have so much control over the results. 

Ok, onto the advice! Doing these two things will increase your odds of passing! Is it 100% guaranteed? Of course not‚Äînothing in medicine is. But it will certainly greatly increase your odds! 

1. Schedule your glucose test first thing in the morning! I wouldn‚Äôt schedule it anytime after 10am. 8am-10am is ideal. If your office schedules it for you and it‚Äôs later in the day, reschedule it. Trust me!

2. Eat a high protein and high fat dinner the night before. Being pregnant, you‚Äôll also need some carbs, but don‚Äôt go crazy. You‚Äôll want to pass on the ice cream sundae. 

3. FAST! Yes, that‚Äôs right. Nothing to eat after dinner until it‚Äôs time to drink your glucose solution at your appointment. Feel free to drink as much plain water, black coffee or unsweetened tea as you would like beforehand. You‚Äôll need to avoid all foods as well as drinks that contain real AND artificial sweeteners. The only thing you should be consuming are the three drink options above. 

Why does this work? The high protein and high fat dinner increases satiety, making you continue to feel full for longer. This is important because you are about to fast. It also is unlikely to cause huge glucose spikes, which is what you want to avoid the night before a glucose test. Scheduling a test early in the morning shortens your fast, making you less likely to need snacks before your appointment.

Good luck ladies!



DISCLAIMER: If you‚Äôre hypoglycemic (low blood sugar issues) and feel like you MUST eat something beforehand, stick with a high protein and high fat snack. If fasting makes you develop symptoms of hypoglycemia, 1-2 cups of milk should do the trick. If that doesn‚Äôt help, this advice is not for you! Consult with your doctor!

1jmqa8r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/1jmqa8r/more_tips_for_telling_apart_real_studio_job/,"More tips for telling apart real studio job postings from ""ghost jobs""","*\* please note - this is based on my own experience and is not professional or legal advice*  
  
Hey everyone! As someone who has worked for Disney, Universal, Nickelodeon, etc. and am very used to the job search process (especially when it comes to development assistant, production assistant, script reader, or coordinator work), I understand fear that that the time and effort updating resumes, writing cover letters, and retyping into an application portal's backend sometimes feels wasted.

**Especially** when a company seems to post a job they're not hiring for (which honestly feels like *most* jobs in the film industry right now).

I've felt that as an employee, receiving a lot of LinkedIn messages about cool sounding job postings at a company I'm working at while no one on the team thinks we are actually hiring for that position. I've definitely felt that as an applicant to.

So here are some tips on differentiating ""ghost jobs"" (AKA fake job postings) from real jobs that I've learned:

* It's rare for studio assistant and coordinator jobs with those long HR descriptions to be completely legit. Even if they are hiring for them, everyone on the team knows someone who would love to (or even just ""like"") to work that role who will be prioritized through the interview process. It's likely they won't start seriously considering online applications until all the warm connections are disqualified - which is usually rare. Unfortunately, the inexperienced niece or nephew of the executives best friend will almost always beat out a hyper-experienced online applicant that no one knows :/
* When a studio posts a huge group of similar sounding positions (such as assistant positions in multiple departments), it's unlikely these are open positions, and they might just be HR or the studio studying something about their assistant roles if they were to post real positions in the future. The clear exception is internship/trainee positions, which are often posted at the same time together because internships usually start and last for a set period.
* When it comes to ""pay-to-play"" sites, don't trust them over a studio's career page especially when it comes to coordinator or assistant or manager positions. There's no real reason a studio will give an exclusive job posting to these sites that don't appear on their career's page. Double check the posting actually exists, because these pay-to-play sites sometimes copy a long-expired job description and repost it so that people think they have exclusive offerings and thus sign up and/or create a profile - when in reality the opportunity doesn't exist.
* Funnily enough, job postings that seem a bit shorter, immediate, and informal are usually more legit than these long professional HR worded postings -- ESPECIALLY if they include the email of the team member you should send your resume to. I got my Disney gig from a literal instagram story post someone in development put on her story.
* Also a bit strange, but international companies (especially form China) that are trying to set up shop in the US are also much more likely to post legitimate job postings, as they don't have the same motivation megacoproations in the US do to post ghost jobs.
* To boost your chances of finding the real job postings, you have to be more than an online invisible applicant. Become a warm connection. If you're in LA, go to these Q and A or networking events. Add people on social media. Send those cheesy Zoom coffee requests over LinkedIn for an informational meeting with someone at a company you like. I've applied to about 500 online jobs -- only two turned into job offers, and those were internships.

The cool thing is when you know for sure the job is legit and your application will be reviewed, you can spend a lot more time improving your application, maybe making a cover letter video, etc. knowing that it's going to good use.",3,1743266234.0,Screenwriting,0,0.81,False

The comments on the MTM-as-predecessor post got me thinking. If you could have a grab bag full of 100 sitcom characters and premises, who would you want to pull out, and what premise would you imagine for them? 

For example, i reach into the grab bag and draw Kramer, Rhoda, Florence, Joey,  Endora, and Sue Sue. The premise I pick out is their homes were all bought out by a resort company, so they were forced to move and end up as new neighbors, with a couple of them as coworkers. 

[Just in case: characters are from Seinfeld, MTM, The Jeffersons, Friends, Bewitched, and The Middle, respectively]",5,1743265280.0,sitcoms,5,1.0,False
1jmpwdg,https://www.reddit.com/r/letters/comments/1jmpwdg/that_youd_still_love_me_even_if_someday_someone/,"That you‚Äôd still love me, even if someday, someone else did too.","You‚Äôd laugh if you saw me right now. Curled up like this, talking to the air like you‚Äôre gonna answer me. Like you‚Äôre just out of view, waiting for me to finish my rambling so you can reach over, squeeze my hand, and tell me I‚Äôm overthinking it all. God, I wish you could do that. I wish you were here to do that.

I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing. I feel like I‚Äôm walking in circles inside my own heart. I keep thinking, what if I try again? What if someone else comes along and wants to know me, really know me? And I let them in?

But then I get scared. Because knowing someone, it‚Äôs not just surface-level stuff. It‚Äôs not just what kind of music they like or how they take their coffee. It‚Äôs the deep stuff. It‚Äôs learning the way their voice cracks when they talk about something they lost. It‚Äôs the weird quirks, the random stories, the fears they try to hide. It‚Äôs all the little details that make someone who they are.

And the truth is, I don‚Äôt know if I have it in me to do all that again. To start from scratch. To go through that whole process of building something, learning someone inside and out, when I already had that. I had you. And now every time I even think about starting over, all I feel is this‚Ä¶ hollow ache. Because no matter who they are or how good they might be, they‚Äôre not going to be you. They‚Äôre not going to laugh at the things you did. They won‚Äôt know the way I used to fall asleep mid-sentence, and you‚Äôd just pull the blanket over me and whisper, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll tell you the rest tomorrow.‚Äù

They‚Äôll tell me their stories, and all I‚Äôll hear is the silence where your stories used to be.

And then the guilt hits. Because how can I even think about loving someone else without feeling like I‚Äôm betraying you? Without feeling like I‚Äôm stepping out of what we had, like I‚Äôm erasing you somehow. I know it‚Äôs not fair. I know love doesn‚Äôt work like that, but that‚Äôs what it feels like. And I don‚Äôt want to hurt you. Even now. Even when I know you‚Äôd probably tell me I‚Äôm allowed to keep living.

But why did you have to go? Why you? Why us? We had so many moments left. So many words unsaid, touches unfelt, places we never got to see together. I still had things to tell you. You still had stories to share. We were supposed to grow old; wrinkles, grumbles, inside jokes no one else would get. You were supposed to be there for all the boring, beautiful days we never got to have.

And now what? I‚Äôm just supposed to keep moving? Keep trying? For what? For who? What if I give my heart again, and it ends the same way? With me sitting in the dark, talking to someone who‚Äôs not here anymore?

You were the one who made the world make sense. You were my compass. And now I‚Äôm lost, and you‚Äôre not here to guide me back. You‚Äôre not here to say, ‚ÄúHey, you‚Äôve got this,‚Äù or to wipe my tears when I spiral like this. You always knew how to pull me back when I was drowning in my own thoughts.

So tell me. Please. What do I do? I‚Äôm stuck. I don‚Äôt know if I can love again. I don‚Äôt even know if I should. But I want to. Somewhere deep inside, I want to feel that connection again. That fire. That ridiculous, overwhelming love. But I‚Äôm scared. And I miss you so much it physically hurts.

I just want you to tell me it‚Äôs okay. That you‚Äôd understand. That you‚Äôd still love me, even if someday, someone else did too. But you‚Äôre not here. And I hate that. I hate that you‚Äôre not here when I need you the most.

And I don‚Äôt know how to do this without you.

Now, before anyone jumps on me about it not being a race or it should have stayed at 2mg (or less) for 4 weeks before any increase‚Ä¶let‚Äôs talk. I have read the clinical studies from Lilly from 1,2,4,6,8 etc and also the older study starting at 4 then to 8..I read them all as well as spoken to many in trials. I have had extreme difficulty over prior years without any success with weightloss drugs and programs. The problem was ME. I take FULL accountability for my weight problems. I worked at a job were I sat all day without any movement, made excuses for why I didn‚Äôt have time to work out (bc I was drained emotionally and mentally from work each day) and out of DESPERATION - I spent too much time obsessing how to lose weight and participated in Fad Diets, Fasting and clean eating. I found success in water fasting until the binge came after two weeks of it and gained even more. If you do that a few times, the fat gain with the muscle loss‚Ä¶it becomes a nightmare cycle and then you don‚Äôt even lose significant weight, if any at all. I was also in a bad marriage, stress eater, depressed and then menopause hit. Finally this year - I took control. I had to clean up the mental perspective and had to take responsibility for my actions. I joined a gym and now I move, I now count calories but in a healthy manner but needed help with my BED. I have been resistant over the years with weight meds so when I decided I was ready to start Reda, I went back and forth with what dosage should be. I started with 2mg and changed my mind by nighttime and did another 2MG the next morning. I can tell you, for me (I can ONLY speak of MY experience so far and I do not recommend anyone to follow anything I do) has been amazing. My appetite was curbed literally hours later. I have had no side effects at all except being thirsty so I added electrolytes to my protein diet. I used to drink a ridiculous amount of coffee and that also cut to 1.5 cups verses three pots a day. I would vape all day - I don‚Äôt even do that as much. I have more energy and now focused on weight training since Wednesday. I do not plan to move to 8mg in four weeks but plan to stay at 4mg as long as it works then go to 5 or 6. Many who MAY come at me telling this is BAD and point to the latest clinics of ‚Äúwhy it should be 2 or less‚Äù while they are stacking Tirz and Semi and others (when stacking hasn‚Äôt been trialed)‚Ä¶understand - this is My experience.
