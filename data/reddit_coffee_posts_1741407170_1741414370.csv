1j6aubh,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1j6aubh/gym_advice_please/,Gym Advice Please,"Hi! Please no judgement, but in 2019 I was my heaviest weight at 126kg. I had weight loss surgery May 2019, and got down to my lowest, 77.2kg, in 2021. I started eating crap, to the point I gained to 92.3kg. I made the decision I needed to do better, this time actually exercise and eat well. Due to the surgery, my consumption is still very low. The low amounts of food I am putting in my body are good whole foods. I meal prep for the week, and generally this is my day (not perfect but still a deficit as I am losing weight).

159cm tall. 92.3kg when I started, (17 days ago), currently 89.9kg.

Before the gym, a banana.
Breakfast: a coffee, after some time, 45grams of honey oat Granola, 160grams of Chobani fit Yoghurt? The one with 15grams of protein per serve.
Lunch: a multi grain wrap with spinach, tomato, cucumber, carrot, red onion, and leftover meat from the night before or just season chicken breast.
Snack: the lady bar (look it up if you like)
Dinner: when I have my daughter (50/50) it will be a meat, and generally sweet potato chips. Again, small portions for me. Without my daughter, I will just have 2 pieces of crumbed fish in the oven.

My gym workout is:
30 minutes elliptical, alternate days between arms and legs. 5 days a week.

Shoulder press - 5kg - 13 reps/3 sets
Fixed pulldown - 26kg - 13 reps/3 sets
Chest press - 12kg - 13 reps/3 sets
Fixed row - 19kg -13 reps/3 sets

Hip abductor - 21kg - 13 reps/3 sets
Leg press - 25kg - 13 reps/3 sets
Leg extension - 5kg - 13 reps/3 sets
Leg curl - 19kg - 13 reps/3 sets

I prefer pin loaded machines. I don't like using my own body weight, or anything else. I know what I'm currently doing is kinda crap. Any advice would be appreciated. No hate please...",1,1741414173.0,WeightLossAdvice,1,1.0,False
1j6at0d,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1j6at0d/i_got_cheated_on/,I got cheated on?,"Need to vent and need your support. 

Me and my boyfriend have been together for 3 years. It was great on a surface level but I noticed that he is not emotionally intelligent and mature - he couldn’t remember facts about me (“who’s Adam?” - it’s my brother damn itttt, write it down), didn’t know how to cheer me up (he once said “don’t cry it’s Friday”) and couldn’t support me at all when I got diagnosed. He also had some anger issues that I couldn’t stand, hitting ATMs, road rage, getting mad at our dog. I knew he loved me or he thought that he loved me, he just wasn’t capable of giving me what I need. 


I lost my feelings in June, started planning my way out, saving money, getting a new job (we were coworkers) while it felt like nothing changed in our relationship. 
In February, when I had enough money to move out, he got into illegal job in scamming people. He knew I despise it and he would still come home and yap about it’s details - and it was my last straw - I lost all the respect and care and i signed up for apartment view. 


Then he started a !first! conversation about this relationship. He said “My baby, I want to talk about us” and I said something like “there’s nothing to talk about, I’m moving out” and he was so ok with it. He offered me money for apt deposit and he told me I can take my time and can take anything I want from our home. 


Looking back, he was staying at this new office till 11 pm, he was going to a nearby town with his friend (?) and I found woman’s glasses (he could give a ride his colleagues and it was never a problem). I messaged him 12 hours ago about picking up my belongings and he just replied “will be in town on Sunday and will let you know”. 


I feel so so stupid for caring about this. It literally changes nothing for me. It was so freeing to move out, I don’t have panic attacks anymore, I live in such dream place. I was so afraid that I will never get out. Surely I got our dog (my bf never cared about him). And still I’m crying my eyes out during this week for a man I finally got rid of. 


How can I cope? I feel so rejected and unlovable. I only come to wrong conclusions like “if the worst person threw me out, good person wouldn’t need me for sure”. It bothers me that I have no answers. He is the most lying person and I see no sense asking him. I have a million “what ifs” and so much shame for staying with him. 
It feels so alone to live in a new place, far from my gym and coffee shop, with worse income, with no idea what to do in life. I have nobody to remind me to eat, nobody to “help me think” out loud, nobody to actually remember groceries we need. I can’t bear these emotions",1,1741414035.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

Below is a list of things I'm looking for in a neighbourhood. I'll be making a visit in the next few months to look around and get the vibe of areas I'm interested in moving to. Are there any areas/neighborhoods that check most or all of these boxes?

**1) Mass Transit Access:** I'll be heavily reliant on reaching work by mass transit.

**2) Property Type:** Ideally, a two-bedroom apartment to purchase. I am not sure if I qualify for any age-restricted properties (for example where I live there are many 55+ communities).

**3) Walkability to Local Shops:** Ideally a market like a Tesco, a nearby coffee shop like a Starbucks would be lovely.

**4) Age-Appropriate:** I'm middle-aged so an area of clubs and bars wouldn't suit.

1j6acbf,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1j6acbf/to_that_evil_witch/,To that evil witch,"So I am writing you again, in my eternally sing-song lilting way, where I’ll wheedle around much longer than needed saying much less than what needs to be mentioned.

I miss you, deeply, passionately. I adored you. I still do. The longing, the pain, the frustration I can all still feel like it’s that day you let me go.

I don’t blame you for that. I have thought much about what might have happened had I torn that silly note out of your hands. If I’d never scrawled it 15 minutes before I met you. It was curious; I never expected you to react in the way you did. All I hoped to offer was an affirmation of the things I thought we both knew already, those secret half-spoken truths about how badly I want you near me. You left me utterly reeling and spinning, effortlessly.

In that one heinous moment just before I marshaled the courage to see you for the last time, when your best friend asked if I still had feelings for you. I hope you know, intrinsically, that when I answered no, it was a lie. I have wondered exactly what the hell I was thinking. In some sense, it felt like I had long reconciled myself to your lack; that I had too fully and too sincerely taken you at your word to keep an appropriate distance that I could not dare admit how I felt. Also, I mean no disrespect to your friend, but that question, innocent enough for her, is wretched and abominable for me. It is something so fantastically private, so incomprehensibly near to the center of my being, how could I possibly share it with her and not you? How could I stand an intercessor? 

On the one hand, perhaps if I had been more amenable to the ‘help’ of the crowd, things might have not turned out differently. Perhaps I could have enlisted your friends and we could have happily conspired. But also, in some sense, I despise your friend. That sort of collective involvement in our relationship was exactly what I hoped to avoid, what I dreaded so terribly. It’s why I simply walked up to you and started talking. It seemed so unfair. Why did your friend, who’s in a relationship, get to decide, get to spring upon me, get to ambush me with your care? As you may have grasped, I have a complex relationship with self-esteem. On the one hand, I consider myself highly able and observant, on the other, irredeemably wretched and base. In that jealous corner of my being, it seemed so certainly a plot, a trick to peel you away for good.

But then, in the days and weeks following this impactful moment, I reached out to you, and you responded, positively, even! How overjoyed I was to sit with you in a coffee shop even if just for an hour. How much I wish to see you again. Oh how do you resound in my being so well?

There was this sort of grand game, you know, the drama, the scandal, the tight-knit social world of a small liberal arts theater troupe. I hated it so much. All I wished for, the only one I craved, was you. 

I wonder, in the grand scheme, why do you stick so tenaciously in my head, what is it about you? I try to break down and analyze the logical pieces, to put a microscope to your magic, to try and prove it’s not real, to convince myself to move on. But I so desperately wish to not do that.

There was something so indescribably romantic about you. The idea of a childhood friend had always been captivating to me; that idea of unshakable longevity and certainty in each other. How miraculous it was to discover when you pried open my memories that you had been there in 1st grade. To rediscover you, by pure happenstance, on a whim of a whim of a decision, something about that struck me as inescapably lovely. And then, of course, the dramatic finale, the spurned note about my cares, the emotion in your voice. I remember that day so vividly, but I can’t remember what you said on the phone. Yes, you called me promptly, minutes later, I hadn’t even turned yet. And the emotion in your voice, that hideous mewl of regret and nausea and sorrow and self-loathing and acquiescence and I cried. I shuffled some automatic, polite response; I wanted to wail, I wanted to weep, I wanted nothing more than to denounce you, to reject you, to say you were lying. 

To think that you never cared at all is too heartbreaking. To think that the months and months of talking for hours and hours, were you really just putting up with me? Did you never really care for me? Or did you like being liked? If I’d never shouted it out loud to your face, would I still see you around?

There is some cruel, tempestuous pit inside me; it wants to hate you, to despise you, to see you as nothing but cruel and callous. But I don’t believe that, truly. I know it’s not true. I know you are one of the kindest and gentlest people that I have ever met. I suppose another aspect is the tragedy. To me, my feelings for you, our relationship as it was taking place, fitfully, awkwardly, but nevertheless, was something profoundly fragile and precious. It felt like to even whisper it to you would blow out the flame. Perhaps this might explain the disconnect, the steady feeling that burnt and built within me for the better part of 16 months, and the signals of but which you could perceive, of which I so assiduously ironed out of your view. It was strange, it felt like you were in on it. Like with a coy wink and a nod, we were getting one over on everyone. We were actually going to do it on our own terms, both tacitly aware of the other’s hidden charms and intrigues, directly lovingly in a secret, merry war between two interested parties. It seemed so placid and serene and irrefutable to me that you reciprocated.

But at times, I wonder, how has it been so easy for you to ignore me? If you felt as strongly as I did, then how can you bear to stand apart so long? What crude and contemptuous things must you think of me? It is the most disgusting and wretched thought to me imaginable, that in some sacred corner, some holy way, that we could have been happy, together, joyous and in love. That all we could have ever dreamed and hoped for could have been real and for true, but now it never will be. 

Another thing, as you may have gathered, I had never had the good fortune to be a part of a sincere, genuine relationship. It felt finally like that could be about to change, that I could find someone so understanding and so full of warmth, and so self-servingly, get them to love me too. There’s a sense of scrivening. That I have held for far too long and far too greedily absolute and distilled bile. But it’s like that refuse is all I have left of you. There are more memories, too many to count, of our unflappably chaste and courteous relationship. Perhaps that is why? There was something so ideal about it, so guarded; I was so certain that oceans of current seethed just under the surface in us both. That we both struggled with the burden of our desire, that we both so wished, in our own muted language, some way to carry each other’s weight. Oh, speaking of the song ‘the weight’, did you know your name is in it? Did you know I didn’t know this? Did you know I think of you immediately whenever I hear it now?

I have one last thing, and then I’ll leave you in this pretended conversation with no-one but myself. There was this air of doom about the whole thing, wasn’t there? “In another life” you said, at that going-away party, the last time I’d ever see you in an official capacity. The way you tilted your head, the way your perfect curls bounced, the way your adorable face curled into a smile. You may not have noticed, but despite my feigned outward idleness, I was collapsing inside, like burning cathedral, mighty timbers and roofstones falling like pebbles and twigs in the inferno that you whipped up with just three words. I think we relished this aspect. I think it’s why I wrote you that letter. I wanted to prove to you how badly I adored you, how badly I needed you by my side. I wanted you in this life. 

We were trite, we were cliche, I was desperately in love with you and didn’t know it. In a way, I still am. It’s been almost 3 years now since then, and I still think of you frequently. Perhaps this is my own fault, for not moving on more aggressively, but how could I? When I had staked so much of my future world on you, when I couldn’t help it? My life is stagnant, I think consciously, some sort of proof that I’m still here, that I refuse to move on quite just yet, that you still haunt me. I’ll recall that you exist sometimes, that you’re alive and happy and well and still so brilliant, and that you’re completely out of my life. It’s devastating. It’s cruel. You know, you did have a tendency to bury yourself in work.

Also, they take your blood to test for HIV (saw one person go home because they were unaware they were required to do so), and expect a strict environment. Address the individuals that are testing you with “sir & ma’am” as that goes much further with them than acting cool or noncompliant. Also, LISTEN CLOSELY to their directions.

Furniture sets in living room designs play a crucial role in creating a cohesive and inviting atmosphere. Selecting the right combination of pieces not only enhances the aesthetic appeal of the space but also promotes comfort and functionality. From traditional arrangements to modern minimalist designs, the choices available can meet various tastes and preferences.

When considering furniture sets in the living room, it's important to focus on several key components:

- **Sofas and Couches:** These are the centerpiece of any living room. Choosing a sectional, loveseat, or a traditional sofa can set the tone for the entire space. Soft fabrics and durable materials should be a priority to ensure longevity.
- **Coffee Tables:** A coffee table complements seating arrangements and offers a surface for decor, drinks, or books. Styles range from sleek modern designs to rustic wooden options that add character.
- **Accent Chairs:** Adding a couple of accent chairs can create additional seating while enhancing the design. These chairs can be bold statement pieces or subtle additions, depending on the overall theme.
- **Entertainment Units:** For a functional living room, the right entertainment unit is essential. Choose units that coordinate with the style of the furniture set and provide adequate storage for media devices.
- **Decorative Elements:** Incorporating side tables, rugs, and artwork into your furniture set can elevate the design. Thoughtfully selected decor pieces bring personality and cohesion to the space.

Incorporating furniture sets in living rooms not only improves the visual appeal but also maximizes comfort and usability. Take the time to choose pieces that reflect your style and create a welcoming atmosphere for family and guests alike. From color schemes to materials, every detail contributes to a harmonious living environment.

#Trivia

His father forced him to go to Camp Half Blood at 17 after meeting a new girlfriend and wanting to start a new life without his 'unusal distractions'. 

Loves animals a lot but they never seem to like him much, except for the cat at one of the libraries in his city. Finley often finds himself missing that cat.

His favourite music artist is Hozier.

His best friend and only friend is Sunny, a guy he met ing primary school. Sunny felt hurt because Finley left for camp so suddenly without saying anything before. 


***

#History: 

Finley was used to being alone. His father was barely home as his lawfirm kept him busy. The nannies his father hired to watch him barely provided any emotional support for him, as most of them didn't stay with the family long. So Finley learnt to be fine by himself. In school, he preferred to be by himself and lose himself in his daydreams rather than making friends. A boy in his class named Sunny kept persisting on getting to know him. He got hurt pretty severely in a monster attack once, which made Finley even more hesitant towards letting others close. He pretty much only ever had his little sister and Sunny.

He found out about camp half blood at 17 when his father found a new girlfriend and decided Finley didn't fit into the family he was trying to start. Finley didn't want to leave but he didn't have any choice in the matter as his father forced him to.




#Present Day:

Finley thought being the son of literal tragedy fit his situation quite well. He usually liked flying. Buisness class wasn't so bad and something about being above the clouds provided a magical scope for the imagination. Now was different, though. Because the hurt on Sunny's face from yesterday wasn't just one of Finley's daydreams. And neither was the frustration in his best friend's voice or the fight they were in now. This certainly felt like tragedy. 

Finley couldn't wait to get out of his seat as soon as the plane landed. He rushed off the plane as if fresh air would be able to erase the memories of yesteday. It couldn't. At least the rest of the day would be able to distract him.

The driver had eyes everywhere. It was slightly unnerving to sit in the backseat of a car when you don't know if the driver could turn into some demigod-eating monster any second. Finley watched the landscape pass by as they drove to Camp Half Blood. It was just another place that would disappoint Finley, he was sure of that. Because besides Sunny and Anika, everything felt like a disappointment. Maybe that made this a little better because thag meant this camp wouldn't be any worse than anything else.

What Finley hadn't expected was seeing actual greek warriors fighting and riding on pegasai and satyrs working in strawberry fields. He didn't know what he expected but certainly not this. The driver showed him to a cabin and where his bunk was and then left him to his own devices after assuring him someone would come to show him around soon.  Finley decided he may aswell wait outside the stuffy cabin and sat on its frontsteps, looking lost, instead.",1,1741411548.0,CampHalfBloodRP,0,1.0,False

1j6a4qp,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeveranceAppleTVPlus/comments/1j6a4qp/kiers_ethical_framework_and_dichotomies/,Kier's Ethical Framework and Dichotomies,"S2 EP8 brings us into more direct contact with the early history of Lumon and the human cost thereof. 

See: https://severance.wiki/kier_eagan

Kier Eagan lived from 1865-1936, and we see the factory in which he labored. It is in the town of Salt's Neck, where Harmony Cobel grew up. We see on her way into the town that people bounce between the brief throes of a desperate ether huff (Frolic) and the grip of cold, dark poverty (Woe). Geographically it is a beautiful setting, upon which sits the decaying town. 

In short, Kier's early life was very difficult, yet he seemed to find the idea of conceiving a superior work ethic as a way to overcome and ensure hardship. He concluded that his life's lessons should serve as a model for all of Lumon's subsequent employees and his actual descendants hereafter. This despite his being a pretty miserable existence at the outset. 

He was a child laborer at 12. It is noted in the article linked here that his first employer regularly beat employees and also that he was prone to bruising (hemophilia) because of a ""close biological relationship"" between his parents. He survived severe tuberculosis.

The first theory here is that the idea of purposeful inbreeding is one of Lumon's areas of research. 

Anyway, as a young convalescent, Kier has ample time to think, analyze and self-introspect. This leads to the esoteric volumes describing his life. 

The start of Ep8 has Harmony Cobel bursting into her hometown, visiting the coffee shop of an old friend, Hampton. He greets her coldly. We learn later they were childhood laborers for Lumon, in the same factory that Kier worked in decades prior.

She brusquely arranges a ride through Hampton, because she briefed her car is being surveiled. He insists she meets him at the abandoned Lumon factory and they'll go from there. 

The factory had been modernized since Kier's time, yet is now close. Cobel shares information that she learned at Lumon about Kier's history at that very same factory.  It's an interesting moment, I get the impression she is reaching back to a time when they both wondered about the mysterious founder, and filling in a blank for him that she learned through her executive training at Lumon. Her friend is nonplussed (bursting in, cold greetings and being nonplussed are prevalent in this episode).

The ride she needs is to her childhood. She is being driven in the back of her friend's pickup, a rough ride that Hampton seems to both relish and regret giving her. 

Upon arriving to a modest, isolated house she darts out of the back of the pickup and bursts in and, pausing only to briefly exchange icy unpleasantries with her aunt Sissy, rushes to her old bedroom

The exchange is nonetheless a telling one. Sissy is pissed because Hampton is Salt's Neck's ether provider, which substance has hollowed out the town's remaining souls. He is not permitted near the house. 

Cobel's room has since been stripped of furnishings by her aunt Sissy. The early years of her growth are marked on the doorway, one for each year, where the marks stop at age 12. 

Aunt Sissy is something of a textbook sour puss: Sissy-puss? She is steeped in Kier's mythology and seems to be the last remaining proponent of that cult in the town, refusing to give up her faith in the saving wisdom of The Nine. She says ""they don't come here anymore"" and a bit later we see various occult artifacts of Kier's mythology in her room.

It is interesting that we see just two people at a time during most of the scenes in this episode. At the end we see past and present crashing together when Harmony has retrieved what she came for and we learn for sure what want clear at the end of EP7:  that Devon did decided to call Cobel. 

The exchange is interesting: she calls Cobel ""Ms Selvig"". Is she worried someone is listening in? Cobel is not concerned and she demands to know everything. Or is that because she DOES knows they are listening and is taunting them, now that she is confident she has all she needs to bring them down?

So the 2nd theory is that it's at least one fork in the road: we do not know positively that Cobel is committed to joining up with Mark to help him, but it sure seems that way. Does this definitely mean Reghabi has bowed out? Or will Devon convince her that Cobel and her should work together? Or does Reghabi have her own diverging agenda?

Meanwhile, who is in the car that is bearing down on Hampton? Some of Drummond's security people? Does Hampton have something on Lumon to keep them at bay?

Then, the only person who can say for sure what Cobel came for, and left with, is Sissy. Will she weave together the best archaic 19th century phraseology to convince them there is nothing to worry about? Her advice was actually very sensible: even with the information she has, what could she do to Lumon before they do whatever to her? Or will she pretend to take Sissy's advice and knuckle under?",2,1741411473.0,SeveranceAppleTVPlus,2,1.0,False

Then the boss’s son came to my apartment.,"This whole situation feels off, and I(27M) need advice. Yesterday at work, my boss’s secretary randomly gave me a cup of coffee. She doesn’t work for me or usually do this, so it was weird, but I was too busy to think much of it. I eventually drank it.

Not long after, I started feeling really off—splitting headache, nausea, and this heavy, out-of-it feeling. The thing that makes it worse? While I was at work, I saw my boss’s son walking around. He doesn’t even work there. I thought it was odd, but again, I brushed it off because I was swamped.

Then after work, I drove home, and my headache got worse. I started feeling like I wanted to throw up. The second I got home, I crashed—then my doorbell rang. I checked my security cam, and it was my boss’s son. He kept pushing for me to open the door, even trying to force his way in, but I shut it down, and he eventually left.

By that point, my headache was unbearable, and I felt sick as hell. I ended up just passing out. Now I just woke up, still feeling a bit off, and I can’t shake the feeling that something was seriously wrong with that coffee.

What should I do? Should I confront the secretary? Report this? I need an outside perspective because I feel like I might be overreacting, but the timing of everything is too weird to ignore.",434,1741411317.0,AmIOverreacting,148,0.97,False

We’re Own Luxury Homes, a local real estate brokerage that’s helped tons of folks find their perfect spot in the Orlando area, and we’re diving into a big question: Windermere or Winter Park? As 2025 rolls on, these suburbs keep popping up for buyers wanting upscale living, great schools, and a lifestyle that mixes luxury with everyday convenience. We’ve got some thoughts from our experience with listings, but we’re curious—what’s the real deal from those of you living there?
Here’s our take: Windermere’s got that exclusive, lakefront charm—think gated spots like Isleworth or Keene’s Pointe, solid schools like Windermere High, and a peaceful, suburban escape. But it’s got quirks—traffic on 535 can drag, and you’re pretty much stuck driving everywhere unless you’re zipping around downtown Windermere in a golf cart. Winter Park, on the other hand, oozes sophistication with Park Avenue’s dining and shops, plus quick access to downtown Orlando via I-4. Trade-offs? It’s pricier per square foot, parking’s a pain, and some areas feel more ‘trendy’ than ‘family-focused.’
We’re breaking it down for anyone weighing these options:  
Schools: Looking for top-tier public options for elementary and middle school kids.  

Commute: Aiming for under 40 mins to spots like SeaWorld (Orlando traffic, we’re looking at you).  

Lifestyle: Safe, luxurious, with a few walkable nooks for coffee or dinners out.  

Budget: Hoping $450k-$600k snags a 3-4 bed (challenging, but we’ve seen it done).
Windermere crew—do the lakes and quiet make up for the isolation? Winter Park squad—does the vibe outweigh the cost?

Hey there, amazing people of MaximizeMe! 🎉 

Ever feel like your to-do list is longer than a CVS receipt, but you never actually get to check everything off? Yep, I've been there too. 🙋‍♂️ So, let me share a little adventure I've been on over the past few weeks. Spoiler alert: it involves claws, caffeine, and cosmic enigmas (well, more like coffee and planning, but you get the gist).

I had a problem. Between work, personal projects, and trying to squeeze in a semblance of a social life, I felt like I was constantly running on a hamster wheel. I started experimenting with two strategies: **Time Blocking** and **Energy Optimization**. And friends, it was life-changing. So here's how it went down:

- **Time Blocking**: Picture this as your daily chess game. 🕹️ I blocked out chunks of my day for specific tasks. Morning? Emails and admin work. Midday? Creative projects. Afternoon? Meetings and procrastination (just being honest!). Felt like a warm, cozy, predictable blanket.

  - *Pros*: Super structured, hard to stray from the plan. More like a personal assistant than a planner.
  
  - *Cons*: Felt guilty when things didn't go as planned. Became a bit of a perfectionist’s nightmare with endless amounts of ‘rescheduling’ each week.

- **Energy Optimization**: Now, this was a bit more freestyle jazz. 🎵 Instead of rigid scheduling, I listened to my energy waves. High energy? Crank out that report. Brain fog? Time for those routine tasks. 

  - *Pros*: The flexibility to roll with my natural energy highs and lows. Less guilt, way more *zen*.

  - *Cons*: Some days felt like a zig-zag rollercoaster. 🚀 Needed discipline to not turn “low energy” periods into Netflix marathons.

So, did I find THE Holy Grail of productivity? Not quite. But this hybrid approach? **Absolute game changer**. I carved out an extra 10 hours in my week! 🌟 Ten. Glorious. Hours. (That’s like an entire season of the latest binge-worthy series or, you know, actual personal development time. Your call. 🤷‍♀️)

Here's the point, friends: productivity isn't one-size-fits-all. It’s all about finding what works for *you*. So, what's your approach? What works? What definitely doesn’t? Keep experimenting, keep sharing, and remember, we’re all in this crazy balancing act together.

Super super excited but Hawaii seems like a large undertaking on the planning side of things. Have a few key questions that I would appreciate some help on, thanks! Some background info - we are a ~somewhat~ active family that would like to do 2-3 mile hikes, nothing too extreme. We prefer Marriott/Hilton hotels bc free breakfast but in HI they seem to be $$$. A jungle stay in Volcano does look cool. 

Absolutes: 

BI: Hawaii Volcanoes NP, Black Sand Beach, Green Sand Beach, Kona Coffee

KAUAI: Napali (1000%), Waimea Canyon (lowkey need more advice for Kauai)

OAHU: Diamond Head, Waikiki, North Shore, Botanical Garden, Byodo-In

Questions:

BI STAYS: How should we split up Big Island in terms of stays, should we drive to Volcano on day 1 or later on? Alternatively, is a single base in Kona more worth it? Hilo vs. Volcano lodging? Also any particular experience in Volcano bc they all seem like independent accomodations with limited reviews/details.

BI ACTIVITIES: Any must-do bookable activities like ziplining/snorkeling/UTV? What are the scenic drives and sights that are less known?

KAUAI STAYS: Really struggling with where on this one. Poipu/Lihue/Waimea/Princeville seem to all have their own merits and drawbacks, so guidance would be appreciated.

KAUAI ACTIVITIES: Boat or helicopter for Napali? Any other bookable activities? Scenic drives/sights?

OAHU STAYS: Pretty sure we'll stay in Waikiki but any experience with Waikiki Beach Marriott Resort & Spa ($315/nt.), Hilton Hawaiian Village ($415/nt.), Westin/Sheraton/Royal Hawaiian/Hyatt Regency (all in the $300-500 ballpark)? 

OAHU ACTIVITIES: Any bookable activities? Scenic drives/sights in the North Shore? No need for car, correct?

• two coffees
• two Grandma Jennie’s specials (2 eggs, 2 sausage (or bacon), 2 pancakes)
• 1 hashbrown to split

There was a sign on the door explaining that a up charge of 50¢ per egg ordered was currently in effect. We got 4 eggs so we were charged $2.00 extra. Our total, with 20% cash tip was $60.

I have had pelvic floor dysfunction and methane dominant SIBO, and idiopathic constipation for years. After trying multiple antibiotic therapies, prokinetics, pelvic floor therapy, nothing worked and I was really doubting I could ever feel remotely normal again. 

Then I decided to try citrucel fiber, which seemed to work decently for about a year. Not perfect, but it made life manageable. Unfortunately, that product started giving me heart palpitations and gas, and messed with my electrolytes, so I gave it up. I then tried ground flax seed, and unfortunately that caused very bad gas. 

I was desperate once again to try anything and I decided to give good old psyllium a try again. But this time I decided to take it in the morning instead of at night. I was concerned I might not be consuming enough water in the evening before bed, but in the morning I get plenty between a full glass of water and coffee. 

TLDR I don’t consider myself cured but I have been feeling better than I have in months with these simple changes. Not perfect, but I don’t know that I will ever be with this condition. However, I can function and not be a complete public embarrassment / fart cannon in addition to not feeling like garbage.

This week is her wedding and 2 of her friends asked to carpool with me to the wedding and i said yes since we all live near each other. One of the friends asked to meet up for coffee and i said yes not thinking much of it since we will be sitting at the same table at the wedding and we went to the same high school so i guess her friend wanted to catch up with me before hand. My toxic best friend found out and got mad at me. She was mad that we didn’t invite her to the coffee date and said i left her out. I was honestly shocked she said that because she has messaged and tried to hang out with my friends behind my back. Plus she told me that she was busy all week getting ready for the wedding and couldn’t do anything. I explained to her that it puts me in an awkward position because if i said no to the coffee date i still have to sit next to her at the wedding and ride with her in the car. Can someone tell me if im in the wrong for hanging with her friend? I regret not ending this toxic friendship at this point and wish i did earlier. She always gets mad at me for not inviting her to every hangout i have even if its with people she doesn’t know.

Alright, folks, has anyone ever felt like the clock is out to get them? 🙋‍♂️ You know the drill—plenty of tasks, not enough hours. But here's the kicker: maybe it's not about finding more time but using our *energy* wisely. 🤔

Let me paint you a picture. ☀️ Mornings used to be an endless cycle of *hitting snooze*, chugging coffee, and sprinting out the door hoping my brain would catch up. Sound familiar? Then one day, a lightbulb moment: What if a quick ritual could set the tone for the whole day?

**The 10-Minute Morning Ritual That Changed Everything**:

1. **Stretch & Breathe**: *Two minutes.* Even if you look like a confused yoga newbie, just stretching it out and taking deep breaths wakes up the body **and** mind. Plus, who needs a yoga studio when your living room floor is right there?

2. **Journal the Junk**: *Three minutes.* Dump those racing thoughts onto paper. It's amazing what unloading your brain can do. A problem shared… with a notebook… is a problem halved?

3. **Visualize Victory**: *Two minutes.* Spend a moment seeing yourself crushing it today. Seriously, picture the success. It feels kinda woo-woo, but it’s incredibly powerful.

4. **Quick Goal Setting**: *Three minutes.* Jot down just **one** priority—what *really* matters for the day. Procrastination, who?

🔍 So, why exactly does this save time? Turns out, feeling centered and focused cuts through distractions like a hot knife through butter. My productivity skyrocketed, and suddenly, I found myself with two extra hours every day. Coincidence? I think not.

Here's the wild part: once I started using energy more efficiently, the whole time thing took care of itself. The real magic isn’t squeezing in more, but squeezing out less productive chaos. ✨

Anyone else riding the energy vs. time train? Would love to hear if you’ve got your own hacks or struggles. 🗣️ Either way, here's to finding our flow and getting the most out of each day—without feeling like we’re surviving a marathon. 🚀",1,1741408760.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

So I'm not a Taurus, but I was dating a Taurus man until very recently. We began dating back in October 2024 and our relationship was still undefined which I'll explain why. I am a Capricorn woman if that gives more insight to anyone. When we began dating I had stated clearly that I was not interested in casual dating, but that I was also not wanting to rush into a relationship and he agreed he was looking for the same. Everything was going great. He was always such a gentleman, attentive and very affectionate. He was never great at communicating, as I've learned is common with Taurus, but it was enough for me and would send me texts/pictures to remind me he was thinking of me. We both are single parents so we were only able to see eachother once a week. One day while we were hanging out the topic of what we are came up and that's when I learned we did not see things the same way. Because of his actions and words I had thought we were definitely getting ready to get more serious, but to him we were just out of the ""coffee date"" phase. We talked about that for a bit and we both decided to keep pursuing things because of how much we liked eachother. After that his communication significantly dropped despite me asking him for more phone calls so that we may grow our connection since we can't see eachother often. This was the start of me guarding my feelings more closely, but I was still hopeful and still initiated most of our texting. We still planned dates every Friday, but I feel that some of his openness dwindled, but he was still very affectionate/sexual. This made me so confused and I started to feel like I was being used so, one day I brought it up to him that he's been very distant and seems only interested sexually. He says he's been going through stuff and has been feeling down and that he actually wants to steer away from flirting/sexual intimacy. I agreed and said I wanted to have deeper/more open conversations because I felt that we haven't really gotten to that point. Well, when we saw eachother again after that, everything was fine until I tried talking to him about what he's been going through, but he really didn't open up . I let it go and tried opening up my feelings instead trying to explain to him how I've been having a lot of anxiety attacks and the reasons for that, but then he basically just dismissed my feelings as normal woman worries... This really hurt me, but I don't think he realized it because it seemed like he was trying to joke and keep things light so we didn't talk about much after that. He still initiated sexual intimacy. After that I started to decide that it's probably best I end things because my needs were not being met. I stopped texting him and that's when he started initiating the talking/showing effort again, but it was very basic. Like, just giving me enough. I asked him to give me a call when he had the chance because I decided I would break things off. He didn't expect it at all and actually seemed very hurt and disappointed. He said it seems like it's a pattern of his to withdraw when he started going through things and that he was sorry he made me feel the way I did. He also said he didn't want things to go this way because he really did like me and I told him that I felt the same way. I haven't been able to get him out of my mind and I keep thinking that maybe I expected too much. Maybe I wasn't as considerate of what he was going through as I should've been. Ugh, I just don't know. ",3,1741408635.0,Taurusgang,0,1.0,False

I’ve had an issue with my MacBook when I go into certain coffee shops. When I attempt to connect to the wifi, it’ll let me in but say there is no internet. When I use my phone, I can connect to the internet and surf the web no problem. 
It’s only certain coffee shops and I think it has to do with my NIC (network interface card). I’m wondering if anyone else has dealt with this?
I have a MacBook Pro, 13 inch, 2019 intel i5, updated to latest patch (Sequoia 15.3). 
Also it works perfect at my house wifi… so weird.

I use myfitnesspal to track.

I put in my weight, how quickly I want to lose weight, my activity level, the whole thing.

It wants me at like 1880 per day.

Seemed low at first but then I realized how hard it’s been to meet my goal…

I’m not a breakfast person, but I notice when I eat breakfast I don’t crave the foods that make it harder for me to stick to my diet.

So I had a package of Premier Protein Pancakes, sugar free Syrup, and a protein shake and a little coffee this morning (measured the little bit of creamer out and it was barely enough to count for the 35 calories it added.) my breakfast was 410.

Lunch was a nice serving of rotisserie chicken from Costco, and one of the Taylor farms mini chopped salad kits Caesar dressing and all. This is where I messed up, I forgot to bring fruit with me for lunch but usually it’s like a thing of pineapple, or a banana. 390 for lunch.

Went to the gym after work, did cardio and some lifting.

Dinner was a burger bowl I made at home.
Potatoes and all, I even upped my potato count in the tracker because I knew I had more than one serving size but no more than two. Dinner was 510.

Overall I ate 1310 calories. According to my Apple Watch I burned 241 calories but I never believe it to be fully accurate…

Despite missing fruit, this is pretty normal for me to have a couple hundred left over… I want to lose weight as healthy as possible, but I also know if I deprive myself of food I love I’ll binge and go right back to how I was.

Since I’ve started I lost 12 pounds. But… do I need to try to meet my calorie goal?

I’ve always thought 1500 is minimum for what’s needed to power our bodies correctly?

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

**Memory transcription subject: Lawrence Tillman**

*Date \[standardized human time\]: November 9, 2138*

*“Echo two nine, GET OUT OF THERE!”* A hand reached for the controls, even though I tried to stop it.

No... Don't leave them... NO!!!!

I sat up bed, my sheets soaked with sweat. It was still dark outside, well before dawn. My body ached as I stood up slowly and walked the few steps to the shower. No sense in trying to get back to sleep anyways.

As the hot water washed away the last vestiges of my night terrors, I thought about the tasks I had for the day. *Hoofmaster* would be by shortly after dawn. Once he was set up, I needed to head to town today to meet with Jessica for the next batch of trial seeds, then I had an appointment with *A and Z Pest Control* to talk about a predator that was getting close enough that my livestock guardian was getting grumpy.

Turning off the shower, I stepped out and grabbed the towel off the rack. I wasn't even halfway through drying myself when I heard a scratching at the door behind me. There was a thump and the door swung open. in my head I started counting backwards from five. I had just gotten to two when the inevitable ""BORK!"" met my ears, causing me to turn and smile.

""Good morning Princess Mabel, did you sleep well?""

""Bork!"" The white corgi sauntered over and tipped on her side, tongue out and tail stub wagging. I reached down and rubbed her belly before giving it a little pat, amused as she  stared up at me with her slight underbite.

""Oh, Mabel, you sound empty. Come on, let's get some breakfast...""

A few minutes later I was chewing on a zazo bar as Mabel crunched on her kibble and sausage. The kuerig finished and I grabbed the coffee cup, loading it with two sugars and some cream, washing down the spiced beef flavor of the zazo bar.

""Arrff?""

""Yes Mabel, time to check on the cows.""

""BORK!"" My little girl smiled at me, walking with me as we walked out to the barn, the sun just starting to come up. There was a huffing sound inside, followed by low growl. Mabel let out a little whine as my Tibetan mastiff stalked forward out of the shadows

""Good morning, Titan. Did you have a quiet night?""

""WOOH WOOH WOOH! WOOH WOOH! WOOH WOOH!"" Titan pawed the ground and huffed, staring out at the tree line two hundred meters away.

""I see. Well, good boy keeping the cows safe.""

""Wooh..."" Titan leaned into me, nearly knocking me over. I scratched his ears and Mabel circled around him, giving him a happy bork. Titan walked over to the side of the shed and picked up a ball, dropping it into my hand as both the dogs gave a play bow. I Threw the ball as hard as I could, watching them both take off after it. I was honestly amazed that the little corgi could keep up with a dog that outweighed her a good five to one, but somehow she got to the ball first. She practically pranced back to me, putting the ball back into my hand.

""Did you let her win again, Titan?""

""Wooh... rrruuuuurrr.""

The two dogs followed me into the barn. There's a particular smell of an active cow barn, the pungent scents of manure making my nose burn slightly. Mabel walked over to one of the pens and let out another bork which echoed in the barn. A series of moos came in response, and fifty head of cattle came forward in a big heard. The corgi circled around them, borking every few seconds, getting the cows into some semblance of order. I picked out a few of them which seemed to be walking a little funny, and directed them to the chute.

There was a honk outside, a large trailer backed into the barn, pushed by an equally large pickup truck.

""Morning Tilly!""

""Lawrence, what have you got for me today?"" The venlil hoof trimmer hopped down out of the truck, smiling as her two assistants set up the trimming station.

""Looks like 14, 31 and... 47 need work. Otherwise it's the upper half this week.""

""Sounds good, Lawrence.""

""Wurf!""

""And good morning to you too, Titan! Mabel. I have something for you."" Tilly pulled out two compressed mint sticks, one three times the size of the other. Both dogs sat and held up a paw, letting the venlil put the sticks right into their mouths. They proceeded to chew them happily as I let out a sigh.

""You ok Lawrence? You look tired.""

""Just need more coffee. Got a busy day in town today.""

""You had those dreams again, didn't you.""

I grimaced. ""No putting anything past you, little sheep.""

""I wish you would go see that doctor I mentioned. He could help you a lot.""

""I know"" I sighed. ""I just... I still want to think about it a bit more.""

""Ok, I won't push you."" Tilly's assistants finished setting up and give her a wave. ""Alright, time for me to get to work. You want me to just let them out when I'm done?""

""Yes please. Mabel and Titan will know what to do.""

""Sounds good.""

""Thanks Tilly.""

I stepped out of the barn, the sun starting to finally peel away the fog from the valley. The view here was incredible.

Ever find yourself in a mental fog every morning, just hoping that third cup of coffee will do the trick? 😴 Been there, done that. But here's a quick hack that might just flip the switch on your focus, and *spoiler alert*: it doesn't involve any apps, gurus, or magic potions.

So, you're about to roll your eyes and say, ""Really, what can I do in 10 seconds that's going to change my mental game?"" But hear me out. It’s called the **""Pause and Breathe"" method**. 

Here's the deal:

1. **Before you even pick up your phone** or start thinking about your to-do list, take a moment. Literally just 10 seconds. Sit up in bed or stand up if you're feeling fancy.
  
2. **Close your eyes** (or keep them open if you're prone to re-napping), and take a **deep breath**. Inhale for 5 seconds... hold it... and exhale for another 5.

3. While you’re doing this, **set an intention** for your day. Something simple like, ""Today, I’m going to focus on one task at a time,"" or ""I'm going to find moments of peace today."" Yeah, it might sound a bit woo-woo at first, but even just acknowledging that intention sets a subtle tone for the rest of your day.

Why does this work? 🤔 Great question! Our brains are often buzzing with a thousand things at once, especially first thing in the morning. By pausing and breathing intentionally, you’re giving your mind a moment to clear away the clutter and tune into what truly matters. Think of it like hitting the reset button before your day even begins.

Now, I'm not saying this is going to overhaul your life overnight. But the beauty of it is in its simplicity. It’s a no-pressure, no-risk kind of deal. Worst-case scenario? You wasted 10 seconds. Best case? You start your day on an intentional note and perhaps, just perhaps, feel a little more focused.

So, what do you think? Ever tried something like this? Or maybe you have your own quirky morning rituals to share? 🤷‍♂️ 

Either way, curious to hear about your morning wins and woes. Let’s maximize our mornings, one breath at a time. 🌞💪",1,1741407928.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

After years of selling sourdough outside her home, a Victorian baker has been told she must pay $13,000 for a food truck permit. Meanwhile, a small cafe has closed its parklet after pressure from local government.

Listen to this article

Oppressive council restrictions in two regional areas have stifled an independent baker and a small cafe, forcing their owners to choose between overhauling their businesses or paying thousands of dollars.

In Mount Martha, Michelle Ball has sold handmade sourdough bread via an honesty box outside her home twice a week for the past three years. Known as the Bread Box Baker, Ball was told in February by Mornington Peninsula Shire that she needed a permit for the box and, until she got one, she would need to stop putting out her bread.

Her regulars were devastated, with many swinging into action to find her alternative sites, including a wine bar in central Mount Martha. On Wednesday Ball tried delivering bread but, for her customers, that’s not the point of the Bread Box Baker.

“Myself and my three girls, we’d [walk there and] take the dog,” says Mick Duyvestyn, 50, who also lives in Mount Martha. “It was a good time to chat, to hang out, be away from technology.”

Regular Mardi Mason, 41, says: “There are less opportunities for people these days to interact with their community. This was one of them.”

The council confirmed to this masthead that it was acting on a complaint about increased traffic due to Ball’s bread box, but did not share the number of complaints received.

“I just wish the council would use common sense. It doesn’t have to be black and white.”

Mardi Mason, a regular at Bread Box Baker
Ball says she usually makes 70 loaves, which are all sold within 60 to 90 minutes to customers arriving either on foot or by car.

“The most I’ve ever seen there is five cars … and three or four people waiting,” says Duyvestyn. “It’s a quick transaction. You’re in and out, and lots of people walk.”

Mason is extremely frustrated by the decision. “One person’s complained so the council’s acted, but they haven’t actually stopped to think how that … has a flow-on effect to something that’s really lovely within the community.”

Bread Box Baker uses an honesty system, similar to a farm gate, freeing up baker Michelle Ball to do other things.

Meanwhile, Geelong cafe The Local has been in a 2⅟₂-year battle with the council to keep its outdoor dining parklet, which came to a head on January 23 when council officers tried to remove the parklet after hours. Owner Ben McLachlan estimates he’s spent at least $14,000 on lawyers, engineers and designers to resolve the dispute.

The parklet, installed in December 2020, is the only seating at the cafe, which operates on a takeaway model. More than 2600 people have signed a petition to keep the parklet.

In mid-2022, the City of Greater Geelong advised it would not be renewing The Local’s parklet permit due to traffic safety concerns, and asked for it to be redesigned.

The parklet is The Local’s main area for seating and is used as a meeting point for the community.

McLachlan says he’s offered alternative designs, including installing a concrete barrier, but believes the council keeps changing its requirements, commissioning three road safety audits between 2022 and 2024. During that time, the council has had three chief executives.

Parklets – dining structures built in spaces previously used for car parking – rose to prominence in Victoria during the pandemic. Many councils later allowed venues to keep their parklets permanently for an annual fee, recognising their popularity and role in activating streets.

The City of Greater Geelong was due to release a draft outdoor dining strategy in April 2023 but currently does not have a parklet program in place.

“The way people dine has changed,” says McLachlan. “I think that’s been the cause of concern for our community [over this dispute]. People like to walk their dogs and have a coffee in the fresh air now, or bring their prams, or meet people.”

McLachlan recently learned his business needs to commission a fourth road safety audit to get its parklet permit, despite the council already paying for three reports.

The two cases highlight the tension between community and compliance, particularly in regional suburbs where residents are often seeking greater connection with their neighbours.

In Mount Martha, Ball discovered none of the permits available in her shire suited her business, which is neither a farmgate nor a takeaway shop nor a retail premises. The only option would be a $13,000 roaming food truck permit, of which there are only four available on the whole of the peninsula.

“I just wish the council would use common sense,” says regular customer Mason. “It doesn’t have to be black and white.”

Mornington Peninsula Shire describes its region as “one of the richest food bowls in the state” and runs a Mornington Peninsula Produce labelling initiative that encourages people to support a “thriving local food system”.

“We are a region known for makers and growers and creatives, and yet [council] is only interested when it’s money-raising and viable for them,” says Ball.

In response to questions, Mornington Peninsula Shire mayor Anthony Marsh said: “While changes like these can sometimes be challenging, it’s great to see the community come together in support. I’m thrilled that another local business in Mount Martha Village has embraced the baker, allowing them to keep sharing their delicious creations with the community.”

While Ball is grateful to have used the doorway of the local wine bar temporarily, she is looking for a more suitable location that will fit her blue kiosk.

McLachlan dismantled The Local’s parklet on March 2, fearing another removal attempt by the council, and is awaiting the results of the fourth road safety audit.

The City of Greater Geelong did not respond to questions about the amount it has spent on road safety audits and its specific concerns relating to The Local’s parklet.

Instead it issued this statement on behalf of the executive director of city infrastructure, James Stirton: “At the City of Greater Geelong, community safety is our primary consideration, and we’ve been extremely clear and consistent about this.

“We’re always encouraging small businesses to be innovative in how they serve their customers, but this must be done without compromising safety.

“We have demonstrated that we are willing to work with the owner regarding their new permit application, and we look forward to an outcome that is both safe and beneficial for all road users, cafe patrons, the owner and the broader community.”

I have gone to the doctor to attempt to rule out other health concerns. I’ve gotten bloodwork but all my labs are coming back normal. I still have some appointments coming up for further assessment.

Im just asking for advice, my super healthy dad got a stroke about 3 months ago which left him unable to speak, poor right motor skills, and he often cant understand logical thoughts (like pointing to the cat displayed on the screen) i started caregiving him in January after my mom went into another state for her job leaving me alone with my dad to be his caregiver, i love my dad so much i know he has sacrificed a lot for our family and i want to repay him by taking care of him but my mental health has worsened everyday and i dont know how much i can hold on. 

My family had just immigrated when he got the stroke (1 week after we landed) i was supposed to start school once we adjusted but because of the events i haven’t been attending school, making friends my age, nor leaving his side. I live with my aunt and my kind older cousin takes me out to coffee dates in order to get a break from the caregiving but whenever i take a break the guilt of leaving my dad home never leaves my mind and i end up breaking down upon that realization. Its a cycle i can never break. 

My mental health has not been good during the pandemic but i started to heal once things calmed down and now its back to rock bottom again, im just wondering if my life will ever be composed of me caregiving my dad forever and if my dreams of having a medical career is thrown out. My mom doesn’t make much at her job so we cant hire a caregiver who’ll look after him so im quite literally stuck here lol. I really wanted to go out sometimes but the guilt crawls back to me and i get anxious thinking im selfish for wanting time for myself and that i often think “my dad is at home while im out here having fun” “i dont deserve this” and honestly ive mental breakdowns but i’ve never had a WEEKS worth of crashing out only this time.

Here's the background: originally from NYC, moved to the PNW as was there for about 5 years, have a new job in Lowell, Mass. I'm no longer a city girl....I'm more of a nature-adjacent urban girl. 



I do have a car and plan to keep it. Given I work all the way up North (hybrid schedule), I wanted to keep my commute to less than 40mins. I'm looking for a 1 or 2 bedroom apartment, less than $3k. Given that I'm new to the city, I would hate to be super far (10-25 mins away max). It'd be nice to still have close proximity to things/hobbies/people. Even if I did live in the ""suburbs,"" it would be great if there was a coffee shop/walking area near by so I don't always feel like I need to hop in my car to touch grass. I want it to give I live in Brooklyn lol.

  
Right now, I'm thinking Somerville or Cambridge? What areas within those make sense? I also have been exploring East Boston and Chelsea, but it kind of looks dead there? What do you all think?",0,1741407278.0,boston,13,0.43,False
