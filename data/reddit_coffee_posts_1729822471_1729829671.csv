1gblrgo,https://www.reddit.com/r/tirzepatidecompound/comments/1gblrgo/is_this_a_concern/,Is this a concern?,"28F. I’m 5 months in and down 40+ lbs. only have around 10-15ish more to lose.

I’m on 6.5 started slowly to move up been at 6.5 for 4 weeks now. Was on 5 the majority of the time. Had no issues, appetite just started to come back and I wasn’t losing much so I went up.

The last week or so I’ve had no appetite, had to force feed myself to get to 500 calories today. My last shot was just over 48 hours ago.And I’m nauseous on and off (more on than off)

I am at the tail end of my period and I thought maybe it was that. BMs are normal and slightly more frequent because of my period. 

I lost 3 lbs this week when I was average between 1-2. 

I skipped lunch last week and thought maybe it messed me up, like my eating schedule. But idk. I’ve really only been able to eat 1 meal a day. Before hand even a couple weeks ago I could easily get to 1000 calories. (I’m short only 5’2). I realized I was drinking 2 cups of coffee each morning on an empty stomach so I thought i should eat something with it and I tried that this morning and it helped a little. But I couldn’t eat lunch. 

Is this concerning? Should I be worried about something more serious?? Gastroparalyisis? I have health OCD so I tend to go the worst thought, but I haven’t felt like this at all this entire time so it’s freaking me out",1,1729829350.0,tirzepatidecompound,0,1.0,False

Healthy relationships take care and attention. 

This weekend, how do you plan to or think you can intentionally care for your relationships? Consider taking time to get a cup of coffee with a friend Saturday morning or get your family together to do a much-needed chore around the house. Sunday dinners with your family or friends are also a great way to spend time with those you love. It can be literally anything and can be as simple as including another in something you have to do this weekend like grocery shopping or shoveling snow. 

These things may seem simple but you are caring for your relationship by intentionally seeking to make it stronger. 

In the comments below, share your goals for relationship care, ask for help coming up with ideas, or just share how you feel about devoting your time and energy to caring for the important people in your life.

I'm mostly happy with my roasts but lately I've been thinking they all could be *better.* As we've taken on more volume and made adjustments to optimize our production roasts, I feel like we've lost some of the bespoke approach for each coffee.   
I find myself sometimes applying catch-all principles to our roasts.

Has anyone else struggled with getting in the habit of roasting your coffees on similar profiles? 

  
Side note: for natural process from Central America vs. Ethiopia, how is your approach distinct for each?

Some days she (25F) doesn't look at me (24M) at all, and others she comes up to talk.","To preface, I come up to her a lot to talk to her. It's just that sometimes she comes up to me to talk and there's times where she wouldn't even look at me the entire shift. I'm very confused :/. I so badly want to ask her for coffee but I guess the anxiety of rejection is really stopping me.

I (24M) have a crush on my coworker (25M). I’ve known her for 2 years now and my crush developed in the last year or so. She’s gorgeous, soft-spoken, intelligent, and very feminine. I started realizing I really liked her because I’d start getting nervous around her and because I’d think about her outside of work. Between us, we have kind of a professional relationship, it's getting a bit more personal though. We both are tutors.

Usually when I’m in public, I put on a mask that I’m very confident, but deep down I’m not. I’m currently going to therapy for this so I can change how I talk to myself. Anyways, at the end of my shift yesterday I was feeling very tired and drained, I didn’t feel like talking to anybody. All of a sudden at the end of the shift, she approached to talk to me. She's been coming up to me to talk recently and is very receptive to when I initiate too. So I'm just lost as to why she didn't even want to make eye contact with me today, she just immediately left work. Maybe she had something on her mind? Was she shy? Does she get nervous around me? She doesn't like me?

I feel like I get signs from her though. The other day she told me that I’d be such a good “girl dad” (I usually give off like big brother vibes to my students, I’m funny but also strict with them). Btw I’m not sure what exactly that means tbh. She's also been getting into deeper convos with me. Guess i just found today odd because she didn't even want to make eye contact with me, so i assumed she didn't want me to talk to her.",1,1729828137.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

1gbkzaw,https://www.reddit.com/r/biggboss/comments/1gbkzaw/the_number_of_times_vivian_praises_himself_for/,The number of times Vivian praises himself for getting food for everyone.,"Vivian's behavior in the game reveals clear narcissistic tendencies. His primary concern seems to be his coffee, and he aligns himself with those who can provide it, showing little loyalty beyond his own self-interests. For instance, if Chahat and Shehzada were in jail, Vivian would fight with them because he looks down on people he deems unworthy, revealing a lack of genuine concern for others.

Despite this, Vivian portrays himself as a humble, selfless family man, constantly praising himself for providing food to the house. It's ironic—if you drank a glass every time he complimented himself on his ""sacrifice,"" you'd be tipsy in no time. His behavior feels more like a performance, as if he's fulfilling a duty rather than being genuinely altruistic.

Karan, on the other hand, stands up for his friends and clashes with Avinash, who appears to lack discipline or respect. Yet, Karan is unaware that Bigg Boss may be guiding Avinash's actions, manipulating the situation. Interestingly, Vivian is keenly aware of this manipulation, as evidenced by a secret whisper to Avinash after his elimination. This suggests that Vivian has inside information, possibly through his time in the smoking room, making him overly confident that Bigg Boss favors him.

Karan’s main struggle with Vivian is in trying to tear down Vivian's ""holier-than-thou"" persona. Karan can see through the façade, recognizing the hypocrisy and calling it out for what it is, making him one of the few who dares to challenge Vivian’s carefully curated image.",12,1729826652.0,biggboss,5,0.93,False

The company is incredibly small, like 3 people in this one office at some shady immigrant corner. And it's not mechanical engineering exactly, it's technically structural engineering emphases on steel structures. Main program that I'm required to learn asap is Tekla Structures so that the CEO can offload the design work to me. 

It's all under the table. I'm not supposed to tell anybody, talk to anybody about it, no employer contract or anything. The CEO said  ""if I really like you, and you actually start generating value to me, then after 2-3 months, I'll maybe pay you. But no guarantees. No way I'm paying you just for you to come learn the ropes. You can ask me questions here and there about the program but don't ask me too many questions"".



Started my first day at 9 am, and continued working till 5pm, no lunch breaks were given, and I didn't take it because the CEO didn't take it. He showed me around the office, which was just two rooms. Told me he needs to drink coffee continuously to work on his drafting work. Saw a bunch of empty bottles of powdered instant coffee lying around. Bathroom was ok I guess, there were some broken tiles. He introduced me to his two co-workers. One was a grandfather, had grandkids, looked past retirement age. The other guy had to be in his late 40s to mid 50s. When the CEO introduced me to him, said ""Ah good, another guy to abuse eh?"". I smiled, but I don't know how I feel about that ""joke"".

I don't really know much about the whole mechanical engineering field but I thought this was going to be super rare. But in my experience it's not. Before I found this CEO, I actually met another CEO before him whose line of work is in MEP (HVAC, ventilation, heat , air conditioning, industrial ventilation and temperature control, pipes, etc.) who also wanted me to work with him for free. First day, he gave me 3 ASHRAE technical books, 3 technical magazines, and 4 technical reports of construction drawings, shop drawings and pipeline drawings of different buildings, and told me to study and understand each and every bit of all the documents in a few weeks. All of it would be unpaid, eventually if I prove myself, he'll maybe consider paying me. Anyways I was too overwhelmed and ended up not finishing his tasks. Felt like I burned a significant bridge there since he has many connections in the industry. 

My point is, people tell me this is illegal, or I'm being taken advantage of... But it kinda seems like a norm here and I'm in Canada. Is this real engineering like?

This happened a few years ago and I’ve never found a similar instance I could compare my situation to. 

I got food poisoning from octopus tacos. I knew it was from that as the octopus meat felt kind of off from what I was used to. From what I remember, it was much chewier than usual and only like-warm. It tasted raw and it wasn’t sushi grade by any means. 

Anyway, about 8 hours later I started vomiting…a lot. I became very weak and felt feverish however there was no diarrhea—just a lot of consistent vomiting. I couldn’t even keep water down. 

I slept for two days and when I wasn’t sleeping I was woken up by the need to vomit. I did not eat anything for 48 hours. About 24 hours in, during probably the 10th instance of vomiting, I threw up a light brown, chunky substance. It almost looked jello-like. I had no idea what it could be and anything I’ve looked up online doesn’t seem to match. It didn’t resemble coffee grinds like I’ve seen can happen with internal bleeding and I’d already thrown up bile by that point since anything in my stomach was long gone. The only thing I could think of was that this was stomach lining which seems perhaps too advanced. I have never been sicker however and I honestly thought the amount of vomiting was going to cause my heart to give up. I have never felt anything as painful or harsh on my body before or since and I hope I never do. I should have definitely gone to the hospital but I was so out of it and so weak that I wasn’t thinking straight. Luckily I was young and relatively healthy otherwise and I think that’s why I was able to recover without medical intervention.

After two days I started to get better and made a full recovery. I’ve never discovered what that was that I threw up and would like to
get some ideas.

But seriously, it’s just a coffee.

Interestingly, the ones who suggested dinners as first dates never asked to split the check. I, of course, paid the next date.

My thought is that, coffee is a few dollars and no one is really in short of that, so the gesture here is what confused me. My take is that when a man doesn’t even want to pay for my coffee when it was him to ask to meet, he is not really interested in me, or he thinks I only worth the minimal efforts, or he’s simply cheap.

Hey everyone,

I’ll be traveling to Seoul for a 10-day business trip, where I’ll have several meetings daily in various parts of the city. I’m considering staying at the Grand Hyatt but have a few concerns and would love to hear your advice.

	1.	Commute: Is staying at the Grand Hyatt practical for daily commuting to meetings across the city? Will it be difficult to get around from there, or should I consider a more central location?

	2.	Dining Options: If I stay at the Grand Hyatt, am I stuck dining at the hotel restaurants, or are there convenient spots nearby for dinner? Would I be better off staying closer to central areas with more nearby restaurants, coffee shops, and convenience stores?

	3.	Getting Around: What do I need to know about transportation in Seoul? Should I rely on public transport like the subway, or is it better to use taxis or ride-hailing apps? Any tips for making transportation easier as a business traveler would be appreciated.

Any other travel tips or insights for a first-time business trip to Seoul would be great too!

Thanks in advance for your help!

There are so many coincidences and similarities and I recognize  patterns forming and I panic everytime it happens. I think I have this fear deep down that they’re actually meant to be together so now my brain finds ways to make that happen. The scenarios are silly and a rational person would probably think “well that doesn’t allude to anything at all” but for me, I cry and cry and cry and panic and I hate it. 

For example, I’m hanging out with my boyfriend and he mentions his throat starting to hurt. The next morning I see my best friend and she says she has a sore throat. I panic.

Another Example: I get ice cream with my friend and she gets birthday cake flavor. A month later I go with my boyfriend and he also gets birthday cake flavor. I panic when I notice.

Example: she shops at Whole Foods, he also shops at Whole Foods. I panic.

Example: they both have foreign names so when at a counter, use alias names as they’re easier 

Example: he folds his laundry and puts it in a tall laundry basket and reaches in it everyday to get clothes instead of putting them away. She also does this.

Example: and this one happened TODAY— she used the word “business” in a text today and then later on he also used the word “business” in a text

Yesterday, I asked if I should make banana bread and she said “absolutely” today I asked him if he wanted to go to a coffee shop with me and he said “absolutely” 

WHY WOULD THAT MAKE ME PANIC AND SPIRAL??!?!?

I don’t even want to say the rest, there’s so many stupid examples that make me so scared to say out loud because they’re so irrational and stupid but I’m crying thinking about it. Things like them both enjoying certain foods (that i also enjoy) or them using the same kind of butter (that so many other people use: kerrygold) 

It’s like my brain scans for these similarities and when they share something I have this huge fear that they’re actually meant to be together. There is nothing to base this assumption off of, my brain makes it all up. Like I repeatedly have to tell myself that SO many people use that butter or shop at Whole Foods or eat eggs or have hard names.

Don’t even get me started on astrology and how I convinced myself their star signs are compatible. That was an entirely different rabbit hole I had to dig myself out of. 

I’ve had OCD all my life and I know this is ocd because of the sheer panic it brings to my life especially because it’s so irrational but I can’t stop crying about it. I don’t bring her around him. I don’t talk to him about her. I want my best friend and boyfriend in my life but not if they’re going to fall in love. I hate this.

","It’s  4:30 AM local time here, and once again, I’ve been awake all night. I tried everything—walking around, taking a break from bed, then going back to lie down and see if I could drift off. But it’s been another futile battle. I’ve finally reached the point where I called in sick just now. There's no way I can function at work without sleep, especially with the headaches and that pressure in my chest I start feeling from exhaustion. I've gone to work like this more times than I can count, and every time it was pure torture. I'm so done with it.

The thing is, I don’t even feel guilty about it anymore. My job requires focus, and people's safety is part of my responsibility, so I know I can’t afford to go in half-awake and make mistakes. I’ve just accepted that if I can't give it my best, it’s better for everyone that I just stay home.

Now here I am, sipping my first coffee of the day, wondering what’s ahead. Will I actually make it through the whole day until evening, or am I going to crash before noon? Guess I'll find out soon enough.

Has anyone else struggled with insomnia and had to call in? How do you cope with the guilt—or do you also feel it’s the safest option for everyone? Any tips for getting through a day on zero sleep?",1,1729825533.0,insomnia,0,1.0,False

For all my life I have always been a heavy sleeper which thankfully was never an issue because I obviously didn’t have children. 

My schedule before and during pregnancy is flexible and relaxed because I can choose what I plan to do for the day (currently unemployed). This will obviously change because eventually my daily schedule will revolve around my baby. 

I am such a heavy sleeper that I literally don’t hear anything happening around me and wake up automatically when my body feels like I have slept enough. I don’t hear loud alarms and my husband struggles to wake me up for early morning errands and appointments. 

I am concerned that I will be in such a deep heavy sleep that I won’t be able to hear my baby in the middle of the night to feed and take care of them. I plan on breastfeeding so I’ve already cut down on daily caffeine intake through coffee and I do not consume energy drinks to help me through the breastfeeding phase. 

Please tell me what suggestions and advice can help me wake up from heavy sleep? I have googled and apparently a vibration alarm or an Apple Watch can help but I’m open to more ideas. ",1,1729825500.0,NewParents,1,1.0,False

Didn't smoke, drink or drink coffee.  Probably famous later for his juicer infomercials.  But was preaching this stuff since the 1950's.

Known for drinking blended carrot juice and other blended vegetables and fruits.  Eating twice a day and eating mainly fish.  Not eating any junk food whatsoever.

Exercised for 4 hours every day 1 hour swimming, 1 hour jogging, 2 hours weight lifting.

He died from pneumonia.  He shouldn't have continued his working out.

He was still sharp in his 90's.

His wife Elaine LaLanne is still alive at 98 and follows his regimen.

Obviously him and his wife are anecdotal evidence that being straight edge, following a strict diet and exercising daily will give you more longevity.

But I have a few issues with Bryan Johnson.  Mainly the Olive Oil, anyone can buy that themselves and wouldn't need to buy his at a significant mark up.  I guess the reason he seems trustworthy is he paints himself as a I'm already rich and I don't need your money.  And a I'm making it easy for all of you to follow along or to try out my method so you can prove me wrong.

The only other things that may not be good for your quality of life is he's said in one video he uses dutasteride, in another finasteride and also minoxidil.  I really doubt taking any of these in the long term is good for you.  Dutasteride and Finasteride causes Meibomian gland dysfunction in some people, is there evidence they cause damage underlying structures of the skin.

He also takes accutane which is also known to cause Meibomian gland dysfunction.  I'm guessing he's just lucky.

The other thing I'm sceptical about is the GR7 stuff.

I laid down on my couch to take a quick nap. For context, I had a wooden coffee table that had some glass panels. My dogs bed was about 5 feet away next to the TV. I was asleep for about 35-40 minutes and suddenly woke up to a loud bang that resembled someone slamming my table. My dog was sound asleep in his bed, my windows were closed and doors were locked. I was living alone so there was no way it was anyone else and there wasn’t anything physically on my table that could’ve fell over and made the noise. I’m also a pretty heavy sleeper so it takes a bit to get me up. I chalked it up to maybe the TV or something outside and went back to sleep. 45 more minutes goes by and the same thing happens.

So, I had a really successful m&g with a pot. He was cute, on time, charming and gave me a generous gift. I’ve sugar dated in the past- and was pretty sure he was gonna be my new boyfriend ☠️ so I gave him my real number and we planned our next date. 

Because of time restraints- we only really had time for coffee- but wanted to see each other again and decided to meet up. Again, he gave me a really nice gift and I was praising the sugar gods for being so kind to me. 

A little bit into the date he’s like, “ I need to show you something” and slides a card across the table. 

I’m like, “ I have a library card too…” but I flip it over and it’s his nypd card. 👁️👄👁️ then he flashed his badge. 

He goes on to ask if that’s gonna be a problem, since I’m a Brooklyn girl. I try to play it cool- but apparently my face was bright red. Later he ended up saying he searched me on Facebook, and saw my profile picture was me hugging a guy ( my brother ). So basically he used my number to run a search on me and knows all my info now. Awesome. 

I just like…??? Should I just message and say I don’t date cops? Should I say that his dishonesty about his job was too much? I’m trying to not panic- but obviously this isn’t great. My friends are the full spectrum of, who cares he’s generous to change your name and move. My roommate and I just watched a true crime show where a cop from queens framed this woman for robbery and she went to jail for months!!!!! 😭🥲🙏 help

Edit: would still love some advice here- but luckily I actually will be very busy for the rest of the month and into November and won’t be home a ton. I think I’ll just say that his comments about my Facebook made me a bit uncomfortable, and wish him well.

Hey fellow wanderers of Reddit! It's Derek here, aka u/solopassions, and I'm about to spill the beans on a solo trip that changed my life. Buckle up, because solo travel takes 'you-time' to a whole new level!

Picture this: It's me, a backpack stuffed with snacks (yes, I'm a chronic ""hangry"" traveler), and zero plans except for one rad destination—Seattle, WA. Armed with my trusty Google Maps and a slightly concerning caffeine addiction, I embarked on what turned out to be an iconic solo journey.

So, what's it like tackling the Emerald City alone? Let's spill some tea!

**Epic Wins & Wobbly Woes:**

🚀 *Unique Experiences:* 
- Ever tried talking to a fish at Pike Place Market? Neither did I, until a mischievous vendor made it happen. Seattle's quirks keep a solo traveler on their toes!
- Convinced myself I was a chef and whipped up 'gourmet' dishes in my chic studio Airbnb (pro tip: half-burnt eggs still count as success).

🌧️ *Challenges Faced:* 
- Realized I packed more books than socks. Rookie mistake, Derek. 
- Got lost on the way to the Space Needle but stumbled into a jazz club instead. Seattle's got hidden gems for days!

**Solo Soul-Searching Lessons:**

1. **Independence Level: Expert** - Navigating a city solo taught me to embrace spontaneity and trust my gut (especially its food choices—Seattle's grub is *chef's kiss*).

2. **Perspective Shift:** The hustle of the city mirrored my inner thoughts, pushing me to find tranquility amidst chaos. Sometimes, peace is watching the city skyline from your modern studio window.

3. **Personal Growth Epicness:** Solo travel doesn't just show you new places; it reveals hidden parts of yourself. I learned resilience, humor in mistakes, and gained a bona fide coffee tour guide badge (given by...well, myself).

**Pro Tips for Aspiring Solo Adventurers:**

- **Pack Light, Pack Right:** Bring essentials, but leave room for the souvenirs you'll inevitably snag.
- **Embrace 'Me-Time':** It's okay to do absolutely nothing and just enjoy your own company.
- **Stay Open-Minded:** The best plans are the ones you're ready to toss out for unexpected thrills.

So, what's holding you back from your own solo saga? Dive into the unknown. Trust me, the best stories begin when you say YES to adventure (and maybe a double shot of espresso). 🎒🌟

This comprehensive review aims to provide an in-depth analysis of Java Burn, exploring user experiences, scientific backing, and overall efficacy.

**Understanding Java Burn**

Java Burn is marketed as a revolutionary weight loss solution that works synergistically with coffee to boost metabolism and facilitate fat burning. It is a tasteless, powdered supplement designed to be mixed with coffee. The product is the brainchild of John Barban, a renowned fitness expert and nutritionist.

**Key Ingredients of Java Burn**

The effectiveness of any dietary supplement largely depends on its ingredients. Java Burn boasts a blend of natural, clinically-backed components known for their health benefits. Here are the primary ingredients found in Java Burn:

Green Tea Extract: Rich in antioxidants, particularly epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), green tea extract is well-known for its metabolism-boosting properties. Studies suggest that EGCG can enhance fat oxidation and improve metabolic rate, aiding in weight loss.

Chromium: This trace mineral plays a vital role in regulating blood sugar levels and improving insulin sensitivity. By stabilizing blood sugar, chromium helps reduce cravings and control appetite, which can contribute to weight loss.

L-Carnitine: An amino acid derivative, L-Carnitine is essential for the transport of fatty acids into the mitochondria, where they are burned for energy. This process can help increase fat burning and improve energy levels.

L-Theanine: Found in tea leaves, L-Theanine promotes relaxation without causing drowsiness. When combined with caffeine, it can enhance cognitive function, improve focus, and reduce the jittery effects of caffeine.

Chlorogenic Acid: Present in coffee beans, chlorogenic acid is known for its ability to slow down the absorption of carbohydrates, potentially aiding in weight management and reducing blood sugar spikes.

**Benefits of Java Burn**

Java Burn offers several potential benefits, especially when incorporated into a healthy lifestyle. Here are some of the key advantages reported by users and supported by the ingredients’ properties:

Weight Loss: The primary benefit of Java Burn is its potential to aid in weight loss. By boosting metabolism, suppressing appetite, and enhancing fat oxidation, it can help users achieve their weight loss goals.

Increased Energy Levels: The caffeine and L-Carnitine in Java Burn can provide a sustained energy boost, helping users stay active and engaged throughout the day.

Improved Focus and Mental Clarity: The combination of caffeine and L-Theanine can enhance cognitive function, improve focus, and reduce the likelihood of experiencing caffeine-related jitters.

Enhanced Metabolic Health: Ingredients like chromium and chlorogenic acid can help regulate blood sugar levels and improve insulin sensitivity, promoting overall metabolic health.

Antioxidant Support: Green tea extract and chlorogenic acid are rich in antioxidants, which can help combat oxidative stress and support overall health.

So id like to try getting into tea but I've really only had success being able to drink the Snapple peach tea. I tried about 2 times previously but the 1st attempt didn't last long and the 2nd one the brand i picked up (online) didnt go very well since I wasn't sure what to get. Everything I've tried was either too much of an aftertaste or leaning too bitter- can't deal with the 'zero sugar' or Steevia sweetener. Not much of a coffee drinker either except for a single frap from Starbucks (same reasoning) if that gives any indication of taste preference.

Family likes teas, though they don't drink them often and usually only when sick. They have a few blends (from tea stores) and I like the smell but could never drink them.

I'm extremely sensitive to bitter/bitter leaning flavors (no dark chocolates and such) so I'm not sure which teas would fit. Ive tried basic black tea (in a small teacup) with a TON of sugar but I couldn't get it to a neutral or sweet level I could drink.

The main thing I drink is basic water or Dr Pepper. (Mr Pibb otherwise. Sprite or Mountain Dew if there's nothing else- i dont so those water packets. Most ive done is letting strawberries sit for infusing). I do like cherry (syrup) lemonade, sometimes a basic lemonade, and will drink orange juice but it's not preferred. I like strawberries and watermelon but find that they're often mixed and I'm a bit weary to try some of the pre-made combos (family has an extreme allergy to kiwi so the strawberry ones I've seen are automatically out since i dont want to risk accidentally trigging their allergy).

Any suggestions on mixes or brand flavors to try? Something beginner friendly? +suggestions to make a good iced/cold tea?
(I have not tried milk teas/milk in my previous tea attempts since I'm a bit sensitive to it, but I've swapped from regular milk to a lactose free milk so I'm willing to try any milk tea recipes as well if those are actually sweeter than basic tea)",3,1729824163.0,tea,2,1.0,False
1gbk7oj,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/1gbk7oj/a_conceptual_model_for_human_relationships/,A Conceptual Model for Human Relationships:,"Hey everyone, I created a conceptual model of human relationships with the help of ChatGPT. It contains 7 different tiers and offers some examples to clarify what they can look like in real life. Let me know what you all think. I realized that most of my relationships hovered around the Associate/Colleague tier. How about you guys?

1. **Stranger** Definition: Individuals you have never met before or have minimal to no interaction with. Characteristics: No recognition or familiarity; relationships are undefined, with endless possibilities for connection. Examples: A person you pass on the street during your daily commute; someone seated next to you on public transportation; a visitor at a public event you haven't interacted with.
2. **Familiar Faces** Definition: Individuals you encounter regularly in various contexts but do not engage with deeply. Characteristics: Recognition exists; interactions remain casual and surface-level; there’s a sense of comfort in shared spaces. Examples: Neighbors you wave to but rarely speak with; colleagues in your office you see daily but don’t engage with beyond small talk; regular attendees at a local coffee shop who recognize each other but don’t converse.
3. **Associate/Colleague** Definition: Individuals you interact with primarily due to shared environments, such as work, school, or social groups. Characteristics: Relationships are context-dependent and based on convenience; casual interactions often revolve around shared activities or circumstances. Examples: Classmates you see frequently but don’t interact with outside of school assignments; people you sit next to in a recurring training session at work; members of a book club you attend, engaging in discussions but not outside that context.
4. **Acquaintance** Definition: Individuals you know and interact with occasionally, often in social settings, where interactions are voluntary and balance leisure and purpose. Characteristics: Some familiarity; interactions are friendly and can be purposeful or casual; relationships offer a mix of leisure and meaningful engagement. Examples: A workout partner you meet regularly for exercise but don’t share personal details with; a colleague you grab coffee with occasionally for casual chats; someone you engage with during community activities, like volunteering or local events.
5. **Buddy** Definition: Casual friends with whom you share enjoyable activities but may not have deep emotional ties. Characteristics: Focused primarily on having a good time without deep emotional sharing; interactions are often spontaneous and don’t require an overarching purpose. Examples: A friend you hang out with frequently to watch movies or go out to eat; someone you enjoy attending concerts or social events with, without specific plans; a friend you often call to play video games or hang out but don’t discuss personal issues with.
6. **Friend** Definition: Individuals with whom you share a deeper bond characterized by mutual support and understanding. Characteristics: Emotional connection and genuine interest in each other’s lives; regular interaction and meaningful conversations that foster trust and support. Examples: A friend you confide in about personal struggles or achievements; someone you plan regular outings or hangouts with, such as movie nights or road trips; a childhood friend with whom you’ve shared significant life experiences.
7. **Confidant/Soulmate** Definition: The deepest level of connection, characterized by profound trust, intimacy, and emotional support. Characteristics: Unconditional trust and acceptance; you can be your true self without fear of judgment; mutual vulnerability, allowing for deep emotional sharing and support. Examples: A romantic partner who understands your deepest fears, dreams, and insecurities; a lifelong friend who has been by your side through significant life events, offering unwavering support; a mentor who not only guides you professionally but also understands your personal journey and challenges.

ADDENDUM: The main point of this model is to emphasize that all levels are valid forms of relationships and none are inherently better or worse than the others. It also serves as a way to gain clarity of why there can be a mismatch of expectations between two people in a relationship. For example: One person can view the relationship as being at the ""Friend"" level yet the other one could just view it in the ""Acquaintance"" Level. Lastly, it outlines how relationships can progress (and regress) over time and how a person can identify where their relationship may fall into. Overall, it's just a fun little project that I thought could be useful.",1,1729824137.0,socialskills,0,1.0,False

**What is Java Burn?**

Java Burn is a weight loss supplement uniquely designed to integrate with your morning coffee. This approach sets it apart from traditional fat burners. By blending Java Burn into your coffee routine, the supplement aims to enhance metabolism, boost energy levels, and support fat burning throughout the day. This design seeks to offer a practical solution for weight management without requiring significant changes to your daily habits.

**The Science Behind Java Burn**

**Ingredient Analysis**

Java Burn’s effectiveness relies on its combination of natural ingredients, each playing a role in its intended benefits:

1. **Chlorogenic Acid**
   * **Psychological Impact:** Chlorogenic acid, derived from green coffee beans, may influence your body’s metabolism by reducing carbohydrate absorption and enhancing fat metabolism. This can contribute to more stable energy levels, potentially impacting mood and cognitive function positively.
2. **L-Carnitine**
   * **Psychological Impact:** L-Carnitine facilitates the transport of fatty acids into the mitochondria for energy conversion. This process can boost physical performance and energy levels, which may positively affect mood and overall psychological well-being by supporting a more active lifestyle.
3. **Green Tea Extract**
   * **Psychological Impact:** Known for its antioxidant properties, green tea extract may enhance metabolism and promote fat oxidation. The increase in metabolic rate and energy levels can contribute to improved cognitive function and mood stability.
4. **Chromium**
   * **Psychological Impact:** Chromium helps regulate blood sugar levels, which can reduce cravings and support balanced energy. Stable blood sugar levels are associated with improved mood and reduced irritability, contributing to overall psychological stability.
5. **Caffeine**
   * **Psychological Impact:** As a well-known stimulant, caffeine boosts metabolic rates and energy expenditure. Its stimulating effects can enhance mental alertness and mood, although excessive intake may lead to jitteriness or anxiety in sensitive individuals.

**Mechanism of Action**

Java Burn is designed to enhance the effects of caffeine in coffee. By combining its ingredients, the supplement aims to:

* **Elevate Metabolic Rates:** Boosting your body’s calorie-burning capacity.
* **Improve Energy Levels:** Supporting an active and engaging lifestyle.
* **Assist in Fat Oxidation:** Facilitating fat breakdown for energy.

This dual benefit not only amplifies the effects of your morning coffee but also supports overall metabolic health, potentially influencing your psychological and emotional state.

**User Reviews and Experiences**

**Positive Feedback** Users often report:

* **Enhanced Energy and Metabolism:** Improved energy levels and more efficient metabolism, contributing to better mood and psychological well-being.
* **Convenience:** The ease of integrating Java Burn into a daily coffee routine is appreciated, making it a manageable addition to their lifestyle.
* **Gradual Weight Loss:** Many users experience gradual weight loss when Java Burn is combined with a balanced diet and exercise, contributing to improved self-esteem and overall mental health.

**Neutral to Negative Feedback** However, some users have experienced:

* **Variable Results:** The supplement’s effectiveness can vary based on individual factors such as metabolism and lifestyle.
* **Minimal Changes:** Individuals who do not maintain a healthy lifestyle may not see significant benefits, which could affect their motivation and psychological outlook.

**Comparing Java Burn to Other Supplements**

**Java Burn vs. Traditional Weight Loss Pills** Traditional weight loss pills often rely on stimulants or synthetic ingredients, while Java Burn uses natural components to enhance coffee’s effects. This natural approach may appeal to those who are cautious about synthetic compounds and are looking for a more integrated solution.

**Java Burn vs. Meal Replacement Shakes** Meal replacement shakes offer a structured method for weight management by providing controlled nutrition. Java Burn, on the other hand, enhances your existing coffee routine and supports weight management through metabolic support. Individuals who prefer integrating supplements into their current habits might find Java Burn more suitable than meal replacement shakes.

**Scientific Support and Research**

**Green Tea Extract and Metabolism** Extensive research supports the benefits of green tea extract in boosting metabolism and supporting cardiovascular health, which can positively influence mood and cognitive function.

**Chlorogenic Acid and Weight Management** Studies indicate that chlorogenic acid can aid in reducing fat absorption and support weight management by influencing carbohydrate metabolism, which can help in maintaining psychological balance by stabilizing energy levels.

**How to Use Java Burn for Optimal Results**

**Dosage and Administration**

* **Mixing Instructions:** Combine one packet of Java Burn with your morning coffee.
* **Consistency:** Incorporate Java Burn into your daily routine for the best results.
* **Dosage:** Adhere to the recommended dosage to avoid potential side effects.

**Complementing Java Burn with a Healthy Lifestyle**

* **Balanced Diet:** Pair Java Burn with a nutritious diet to support overall well-being.
* **Regular Exercise:** Incorporate physical activity to enhance the benefits of Java Burn and support psychological health.

**Potential Side Effects and Safety**

**Safety Profile** Java Burn’s ingredients are generally safe when used as directed. However, potential mild side effects include:

* **Jitteriness:** Due to caffeine content, which can affect mood and anxiety levels.
* **Digestive Discomfort:** In some individuals, which may influence overall comfort and well-being.

**Interactions with Medications** Consult a healthcare provider if you have underlying health conditions or are on medications to ensure Java Burn’s compatibility with your current treatments, and to address any potential psychological or physiological impacts.

I’ve got that work meeting tomorrow morning with the boss and some fellow coworkers where I’ll most likely be totally irrelevant? Better have a few to take the edge off.

Put two liters of water in two separate bottles on the nightstand cause I know I’ll constantly wake up feeling dehydrated and take a few chugs and go back to sleep. Then have to wake up and hit the bathroom and chug water while I calculate in my head how many drinks I had compared to how much water I had, and what time I went to sleep. Wake up and chug water sweating and feeling dehydrated and do that a few more times.

So when I’m half asleep, through terrible sleep if it can even be called sleep, I’m constantly thinking about how much I drank, how much water I drank that day, how much water I’m drinking throughout the night, and what time I went to sleep to get this terrible sleep anyways.

So then I wake up feeling “ok the hangover isn’t that bad” and make coffee, keep slamming water, and about 20 minutes into it the hangover and hangxiety hit hard.

All the anxiety was caused by myself, I’m literally paying money to have horrible sleep, feel like shit, and have terrible anxiety in the morning. And get fat as fuck, people pay so much money for ridiculous fad diets and I’m paying $25 a day to feel shitty, get anxiety and get fat as fuck.

I have a boiler that the transformer relay clicks like a MF.  Video attached.

[https://youtube.com/shorts/g5jCS0qxhP4?si=rS6H1iZ4LYsp2HV\_](https://youtube.com/shorts/g5jCS0qxhP4?si=rS6H1iZ4LYsp2HV_)

Long story is my wife bought a nest thermostat about 8 years ago.  Didnt have a c wire so I just put the project on the back burner like many get put.  Well, early this summer I got around to running a c wire from my ac transformer to the thermostat, got the nest installed and all was good.

Two separate systems.  Central air, and baseboard heat (2 wires for heat).

Occasionally over the summer I would come home from work and noticed that the air handler was running but the compressor unit outside was not.  I thought the nest was being silly, would pull it off the wall, put it back on, and it would reset and be fine.  Until one day I pulled it off the wall and it didn't reset.  Only way to get the air handler to turn off was to disconnect the green fan wire from the base.  And it started working fine again.

Fast forward to the end of august.  Im making coffee on a saturday morning, the ac is pumping cold and all of a sudden I hear this crazy clicking from the basement coming from the heater.  WTF.  I flick the boiler switch and it shuts off.  The only way to get it to stop doing this is to disconnect the R wire on the back of the thermostat. So I do some research and find out that the back of the nests are junk and short out.

Throw it out, get an eco bee, run the ac the rest of the summer and now I'm here in a cold house trying to figure out the head.

When I turn the heater on sometimes it just buzzes straight, sometiems buzzes for a few seconds, then stops, then starts.  Eventually it lights.  Once the system is warm it lights no problem and there is no crazy buzzing.

I checked for 120v at the back of the transformer.  Good.  So I figured the relay was bad.  Ordered relay and transformer assembly same thing.

I check to make sure im getting 24v out of the relay.  Good.

\-If i unplug the wires going to the gas coil valve things, same thing

\-If i unplug the probe wire it does the same thing

\-If i jump the temp switch thing (that reads the water temp to turn the burner off) it does the same thing

\-it is 100% the relay on the transformer bracket making the noise and clicking

If I unplug the red and blue wire from the bottom of the ignition box I get one solid click like I got for the last ten years but it obviously doesn't light.  So I think the ignition box is bad.  Order a used one, does the same exact thing.  No different at all.

I don't know what to do. I build race cars, rewire boats, put bathrooms in from scratch, run sub panel to detached garage, understand wiring diagrams ok.  But I need help.

I dont really see how a bad nest backing plate would cause something in the heater to take a shit (heat worked fine when i tested when installing the nest in June), but I also dont see how it randomly took a crap when the nest called for it when the ac was running.

What am i overlooking guys?

1gbk4cv,https://www.reddit.com/r/PubTips/comments/1gbk4cv/qcrit_meet_me_in_the_middle_ya_lgbt_contemporary/,"[QCrit] MEET ME IN THE MIDDLE, YA LGBT Contemporary, 65k (1st attempt)","Query:

*Meet Me in the Middle* is a 65,000-word YA LGBT contemporary novel with elements of magical realism. *Orlando* with a genderfluid twist, this novel will appeal to fans of the delayed self-realization of Becky Albertalli’s *Imogen, Obviously* and the reality-defying romance of Dustin Thao’s *When Haru Was Here*.

According to his friends and especially his bullies, 18-year-old Tallahassee “Tali” Miller has always been in touch with his feminine side. Thus, Tali is more curious than disturbed after waking up as a girl. Even his dad acts like this has always been the case. At school, the impossible happens. Gui, a longtime crush and typically stoic giant, bashfully asks Tali on a date.

As Tali begins shifting between boy and girl versions every morning, other’s memories adjust to fit his current gender. Tali feels like himself in either body. Navigating how others change their behavior provides the real challenge. After Gui’s distorted romantic confession, Tali fears he wants nothing to do with his original self. Instead, Gui confronts his repressed demisexuality.

Not everything proves so easily rationalized. When people start to question reality, the world glitches. Chickens transforming into emus is only the beginning. Tali must blur the line between boy and girl before the world turns into a surrealist nightmare. This will be difficult when his boyfriend wants to hold hands one day and cower in his closet the next. Worse, Tali has been talked into replacing Juliet at the last minute, and this year’s Romeo treats women like trophies.

Abandoning the school play would eliminate the biggest risk. But having come out once already, Tali refuses to silence his evolving identity by playing it safe.

This novel draws heavily from my experiences as an agender person raised in rural Illinois.

  
A couple logistical questions:

1. Genre - I feel 90% confident in this being contemporary and not fantasy because the focus is on the everyday events, but let me know if I should reconsider

2. I picked out When Haru Was Here as a comp and then started reading and realized the protagonist is 19, so I guess it's technically New Adult? But I imagine a story about the last semester of high school and the period right after has audience overlap. Should I find something else or am I overthinking this?

  
First 300 words:

I woke up in the wrong body this morning.

Scratch that. I woke up in a different body this morning.

Somehow, I’m only realizing now, half-awake and standing over the toilet. And, no, not for the obvious reason. As I reached down to go about my business, a woolen barrier blocked my access. Pajama bottoms. Never in my life have I owned pajamas.

Stranger still, I’m wearing a plain black tee. For me, shirts exist as an annoying social obligation. Unless we have guests, I toss mine in the hamper immediately after school.

I pull my waistband to brave a peek, needing visual confirmation of what I can clearly feel. Yep. I have lady parts now.

Though my anatomy has defied all known laws of science, I’m more distressed by my delay in recognizing these changes. I obliviously scrolled through a gaming forum for fifteen minutes before dragging myself out of bed. My jokes about needing coffee to function carry a sliver of truth.

Relief surges through me as I study myself in the mirror. Flat-chested! Or rather, not any bigger than my somewhat chubby norm. Turning into a girl does not scare me. My friends and especially my bullies insist I’m in touch with my feminine side. But a small chest means I can pass as myself while figuring out why this has happened.

I made a girlish boy and now a boyish girl. Other than my missing stubble and what hides beneath my clothes, nothing meaningful has changed.

One thing appears obvious. Other boys would be freaking out by now. Cast a jock in this role and watch him faint in seconds. Only one part gets under my skin. I live in a normal world where humans do not grow new organs overnight.

I always wanted to be special. Wish granted?",1,1729823840.0,PubTips,3,1.0,False

I was medicated for anxiety around 6-7 years ago for 2 years and ever since, I have felt like I don’t react or don’t have natural emotion. I think about my reaction and how to react rather than just simply react. I sometimes feel like I live in a 3rd pov or as if I were playing a video game and controlling my character. 

I also cannot learn new things to save my life. It takes so much for me to learn. I can sit and study if I force myself but the information will not stick. I wasn’t the brightest in school but hahaaaa when it comes to problem solving i am there and on it. I am literally the person in the office/job that everyone goes to when they have a problem or want to improve something. (Also in the family) 

I wouldn’t say I have focus issues but yes I do get easily distracted but I will circle back soon. 

Anyways, it’s so embarrassing I can’t remember what I ate yesterday, what I did at work this past week or even the beginning of an article. I am so so so slow at reading and I’m lucky if I don’t have to read something twice. Also I would pass away without autocorrect I can’t spell the simplest words and someee days I will look at words when I read something and it just won’t click. I just can’t make the word out sometimes.

I get headaches everyday, whether i do or don’t have coffee, water, enough food, enough movement/exercise. 

I have no insurance and would love to just either be told if I neeeeed to see someone or if this is just normal/common. ",5,1729823383.0,AskDocs,1,0.78,False

I never thought about this or heard of it before, but I really struggle to get the most out of my meds, so this has been super helpful information! Most of the time I feel like they don't even kick in at all. Then other days, I maybe get an hour or a few if I'm lucky. Sometimes I will get a burst of concentration energy in the evening. 

For those of you who have dialed in a routine or have found something that works for you, I’d really appreciate hearing your best tips! Anything that helps you stay focused or makes your meds more effective would be amazing to know about.

I'm also a woman with PMDD. As you know, research is now showing that there's less efficacy of psychostimulants during this time. Felt important to share as I would also love tips catered towards this if available!

DO NOT USE UBER FOR GROCERIES! ,"You know what, shame on me. This is the 3rd time now. I’ve used Uber for groceries 3 times total now. All 3 times without fail. I’ve been let down miserably. 

First time… I try it out. I ordered the weeks groceries from work and was hoping to get home to all my groceries on my door step. First off they took over and hour to grab 12 items and drive them 15 minutes from the grocery store to my doorstep. So I was waiting for them to get stuff to my door step anyways…. It probably would have been faster to just do it myself….. Second, every breakfast item I had placed on the order got completely messed up …. I ordered bagels and cream cheese, cold brew and oats. Get this …. I get pre-ground coffee as a replacement for a 1L jug of cold brewed coffee. What a slap in the face ….. I also get a loaf of bread and some weird cheese dip as the other replacements …. Excuse me what the heck?!

Order 2: now I am just being petty to be honest. I order those same 3 items again. Stok Cold Brew, Philly cream cheese and a bagel. This time coffee is in stock. Cream cheese and bagels get completely take off the order. So I payed like 15$ for a 4$ jug of coffee….. wooow 

Order 3: I recently got into a car accident so I’ve been without car for a while and unable to really walk/take public transport. I figured I would try Uber again to help me out. Wow …. What a mistake. I was sitting on the app…. Half my items needed replacements and I was sitting there on the app saying “no those replacement are unacceptable, get something else”. Like hummus. I went through this cycle like 4 times. A replacement came up and I picked 4 different brand/flavors of hummus and this jerk shopper just keeps picking some garlic dip… LIKE WTH!!!!! I DONT WANT THAT!!! It’s going in the garbage now!!!! Again, cold coffee was out of stock, at least they didn’t force me to accept pre-ground coffee grounds this time 😑 … Also ordered a bunch of other things that I would have rather they just removed from the order but they kept forcing my replacement to be some shitty thing that isn’t even the same type of product 😓

This app is GARBAGE. 

Guess what…. Ubers customer service says if I would like I can change the tip amount to reflect the shoppers service….. this … 3 times in a row was Ubers solution … punish the shopper and take zero responsibility….

I really wish Uber would hold the stores responsible for doing a garbage job with their inventory…. And that when your order gets really messed up, their dumb services charges get dropped…. They are ravenous to steal every penny possible out of your wallet though. Stop using them… forever. ",11,1729823101.0,UberEATS,12,0.87,False

i (22f) started my first “big girl job” in february at an early childhood education center. i work monday-friday 8am-5pm every day and a 30-40+ minute commute both ways. it can be stressful but i love my job and i love the kids, i don’t want to quit, this has been a dream of mine my entire life but jfc i am just so TIRED.

i wake up at 6:30am, feed my cat, get ready, make coffee and small breakfast that i will eat in the car, leave my house by 7:10am to get to work by 8am (sometimes i’m STILL late and penalized just because traffic is unpredictable bad even using maps to find the best route), work until 5pm, arrive home around 5:40pm-6pm. make dinner which is done by like 7pm-7:30pm depending how much time i take to relax. if i want to get 8 hours of sleep i need to go to bed by like 10:30pm which gives me 3 1/2 hours of free time a night. which doesn’t include any chores or errands i may have to do. i’ve been staying up later, but the lack of sleep has been adding up and making me even more exhausted. 

its like never have time to do anything and even when its the weekend im so exhausted from the work week that id rather just not. i dont get summers off, i dont have much PTO (not allowed to take unpaid time off), and we get off the occasional federal holiday and weekends. i know that this is how basically every single adult job is and i just need to suck it up but HOW?? where do you get the energy to do anything? i’m happy with my job but i feel like im becoming unhappy in every other aspect of my life. does anyone have any advice on how to come back from feeling like this?",5,1729822693.0,Teachers,5,0.86,False

For some background: I am a professional barista (10yr experience and certified). I have been managing a high traffic coffee shop just outside a cruise port for 5yr and have been hiring and training my baristas since the beginning. My health recently forced me to take over a year off of working to kick cancers a*s, so I’m slowly trying to get back into a regular life, starting with a part time barista position at a company I worked at a few years ago. I only left this job due to boredom and a need for benefits, which is impossible to get through an employer, in my area. 

I started back at this coffee shop a month ago and have cringed every shift. They have a wonderful espresso machine ( Nuova SImonelli Wave ) and grinder, the owners keep it well maintained with the work of our roasters. But, this machine is looks 10x older than it is. In the time I was gone, they’ve had years of people not purging the wands, not tamping the espresso, not properly cleaning, I can go on. I expressed my concern to the owners and they have scheduled for me to meet with the roasters to ensure I’m content with the maintenance they provide.
Here’s my issue, I don’t like to work with other people behind the bar, so I only take shifts that allow me to comfortably work alone. In some shift change overlap, I have had to physically stop other employees in their tracks, and guide them through doing things properly. For example, one barista filled the pitcher with whole milk, put the steam wand alllll the way in, until it was against the pitcher side, then placed the setup on the drain grates, started the steaming and tried to walk away. So ya know…. It’s screeching, my ears are bleeding. I stopped the steaming soooo fast, and gently showed the barista how to steam properly. She giggled, said “oh”, rolled her eyes and that was that. Next day I walk in, she’s working, milk is screeching. 
Another example, this company has been using a distributor, and no tamper. When I educated the owners on the importance of properly tamped espresso, they were surprised as they had no idea, and asked me to let the barista group chat know of the same information. I did so, got no responses, and have come in each day (mid shift) to no tamper being out, and the ground dump being full of obviously untamped burnt espresso grounds. 

I understand that these people do not know of the importance of these things to the production of proper espresso drinks, and they do not know how deeply my knowledge runs, but I am so frustrated with this. I do not want to work at a place that serves hot water and milk. I do not want to work with people that disregard everything I say. And, I do not want to see this machine go through this abuse. I’ve been sure to communicate with the owners of these issues, in which they said “the baristas obviously need retrained”. I have offered to do the training, as long as it is one on one with each person, and that I’m properly compensated for it. 

I need some recommendations on how to get through to these people. How do I get them to have a heart? I have a burning passion for what I do, and you have to have at least a little care in this industry. ",7,1729822650.0,barista,4,0.89,False

Whenever I’m overthinking, I come here for advice. So, my best friend and I are currently on a 3-day vacation. We made all the plans together and everything was going smoothly. I told her beforehand that I’d pick her up from the train station, and we’d go straight to the Airbnb where we’re staying.

This morning, I picked her up as promised. When we greeted, she asked, “What are our plans for today?” I said we’d check into the Airbnb and then head out to another spot we had planned to hang out at. That’s when she tells me she can’t make it to that location because she told her coworker that she would meet her daughter, who lives in [dash] place, for dinner. I was confused and asked why she didn’t mention this before because I could’ve adjusted my own schedule for the day. Plus, if she had planned on meeting someone, she should’ve told me ahead of time and I wouldn’t have booked the Airbnb for 3 days—I would’ve just booked for 2 and gone home earlier.

I asked why she didn’t tell me sooner, and she said her coworker just mentioned it yesterday. I then suggested she cancel her plans and stick to ours because this is our time together. I even said she could just make up a reason like missing her bus or something, but she insisted she’s bad at saying no to people, which feels off to me because she’s never had trouble saying no to people before.

We checked into the Airbnb, grabbed coffee, and then she left for the train station to go to her coworker’s daughter’s place. Now, I’m just sitting alone at the Airbnb for the rest of the evening.

My initial thought is that she’s lying. It feels like she’s meeting someone she doesn’t want me to know about, especially since she didn’t invite me to the dinner and the last-minute change of plans feels really suspicious.

What do you think?

Question is would it be a bad idea to get some self adhesive super fine sandpaper to stick to the top? Thought it might help wear their claws down a little and give some grip. My kids complain about how sharp their claws are so thought this might be a good way help with that. And if it's a good idea maybe implement it in other things.",1,1729822517.0,RATS,1,1.0,False
