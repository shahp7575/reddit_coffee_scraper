I want others insights and advice and see if anyone went through something similar and found a medication that worked for them - disclaimer: I am speaking to my psychiatrist about this and going to get their input soon

I was on lexapro, 5 mg, for 6 days. By day three I was having nightly panic attacks that kept getting worse and worse. In the morning I woke up feeling like I had had 10 cups of coffee and had to be doing something at all times. The anxiety would get worse at night, and the absolute worst when I was asleep. I would wake up in the middle of the night feeling like my heart was pounding and extremely overheated. I was dizzy during these panic attacks and felt like I had had a crazy night of drinking (to clarify, I had not been drinking).

The weirdest side effects were that I felt my legs didn‚Äôt have joints and were bending backwards as I was walking and felt that they were too long (they felt like a foot longer than they actually were). I felt like I couldn‚Äôt tell how faraway people were, like they were either right in front of me or across the room and I felt like I was floating smoothly around everywhere and a horrible impending sense of doom.  

The closest I can compare to what I felt on lexapro was my experience on shrooms, feeling out of body and not being able to tell what was real. I know things get worse before they get better on SSRIs but the side effects were too weird for me to push through. 

A side note, I also did not respond well to Percocet, it made me have extreme mood swings and have horrible depression.

1mac9fl,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAVoyager/comments/1mac9fl/what_is_the_best_golden_circle_tour/,What is the best Golden Circle tour?,"Just got back from an incredible Circle Island Tour of Oahu that honestly exceeded all my expectations. After researching countless options, I can confidently say this comprehensive 8-hour journey around the island is the best way to experience Hawaii's diverse landscapes and culture in a single day.

I spent weeks comparing different tour options before booking the Circle Island Tour with Waimea Waterfall (https://athometouch.com/Oahu-Island). What sold me was the perfect mix of iconic spots and hidden gems, plus the stellar reviews from other travelers.

The day starts early with a convenient pickup from Waikiki hotels around 7 AM. Our guide, a true local, shared fascinating stories about Hawaii's history and culture throughout the journey. The air-conditioned vehicle was super comfortable, which matters when you're exploring for 8 hours.

Here's what made this tour stand out:

The first stop at Diamond Head offered breathtaking coastal views - perfect for those Instagram-worthy shots. The Halona Blowhole was mesmerizing; watching the natural geyser shoot water up to 30 feet high was quite a sight. 

The North Shore portion was a highlight. We stopped at famous Sunset Beach, and our guide knew exactly where to find the best garlic shrimp trucks (definitely worth the extra cash for lunch). The local fruit stands were a delicious bonus.

The crown jewel was Waimea Valley. The botanical garden is stunning, but the waterfall swim was unforgettable. Bring your swimsuit - you won't want to miss this opportunity. The water was refreshing, and the setting felt like something out of a movie.

Other memorable stops included:
- Nu'uanu Pali Lookout for incredible valley views
- Tropical Farms for coffee and macadamia nut sampling
- Kualoa Regional Park (Jurassic Park fans will love this)
- Dole Plantation (the Dole Whip alone is worth the visit)

Pro tips from my experience:
1. Book early - tours often fill up weeks in advance
2. Bring cash for lunch and tips
3. Pack both swimming gear and a light jacket
4. Don't forget your camera - every stop is photo-worthy

The tour costs $154 per person, which initially seemed steep, but considering the included admissions and comprehensive experience, it's actually great value. They offer free cancellation up to 24 hours before, and you can reserve now and pay later through this link: https://athometouch.com/Oahu-Island

After trying various tours on different islands, this Circle Island Tour truly stands out. It's well-organized, informative, and hits all the must-see spots without feeling rushed. The small group size (max 24 people) means you get personal attention from the guide.

If you're planning a trip to Oahu and want to make the most of your time, this tour is absolutely worth booking. It's perfect for first-time visitors who want to see the island's highlights in one day.",1,1753587106.0,AskAVoyager,0,1.0,False

I sent him a slightly flirty message suggesting coffee sometime as I live not far from where his new job is located. I thought my message was pretty direct and obvious, but now I'm 2nd guessing myself.  
So he replied fairly promptly to the first text and sounded enthusiastic about getting together, said to let him know when I'm free. But when I told him my availability, it took him nearly 24 hours to respond. When he did, he suggested a lunchtime catch up on Tuesday, but I'm left feeling like the loonnnnggg response time means he may just see me as a friend. Anyway, what I want to know from a male perspective...  
* Would a guy say yes to coffee if he's not keen? Surely guys know a one on one coffee generally has saying connotations? 
* If so, why then take so long to follow up? Or is he possibly just not a big texter, busy or whatever? 

If it's relevant, I am F48 and he's M35 so there's a bit of an age gap. However he doesn't know my age, and probably thinks I'm early 40s (I look good for my age). 

Basically I'm just trying to decide if I should be writing him off based on the super slow response to my 2nd text. I'm not interested in game playing of any kind which is why I tried to be quite blunt in my original message to him.

Anyway, when they resulted yesterday it was 1,100 uL/12% I have been feeling really bad since September-I had a cold that would not go away, my liver enzymes were mildly elevated since May, my Nephrologist said I was in CKD 1, my muscles on my right side disappeared overnight & I became very weak (I was working w/PT for hip pain at the time & she noticed the wasting). My right knee started giving out & I have to walk with a cane. And I had 4-5 months of polycythemia. All my labs eventually reset themselves, but my muscles are stil gone & I'm so weak.

That same day I noticed the floor of my mouth hurt (my mouth has been bone dry since September, but I didn't think much of it), still there the next day & I felt it & noticed a lump in my neck on the right side. The floor of my mouth felt sore, and I eventually milked enough fluid to get it to go down. Then a few days later I went into a flare, then stopped , then very swollen right floor of mouth-felt like a coffee straw sticking out & eased pain by pushing on the floor of my mouth. 

The lump(lymph node I think-painless) is still there, having an ultrasound of it in August. I've had an enlarged but unchanged lump in my axilla for over a year.

But that only makes the process more interesting."" More interesting??? We have made this once streamlined and truly accessible platform more expensive and more convoluted to use because it ""Makes it more interesting""??? Since when was providing a way to bypass paywalls to help the general public access scientific research something that needed to be ""interesting"" rather than simple and accessible?   
There used to be a place you could access from the site, where, if an article was not directly available, you could sign up and ask for someone to provide it for free. That worked great. What happened to that? Why did we fix something that wasn't broken???   
I get their other argument that ""it's cheap"". Yeah, I get it, 10$ USD isn't the same price as some of these institutions are asking... I get that the site is saying it's not worse than ""the price of a coffee"" in many places. This distracts from the fact that someone like me, who is deeply critical and skeptical of crypto, is barred from accessing research papers. This does more harm to the world than it does good. Last year, when you could freely ask for papers without this crypto nonsense, it worked great. It is the idea of it that is at issue.

## FAQs Section

Addressing common questions about G power adapters can help consumers make more informed decisions.

**Are G power adapters compatible with all types of electronic devices?**
G power adapters,particularly those with universal compatibility features,are designed to work with a wide range of electronic devices.

I‚Äôm looking to meet new people around the same age who enjoy spending time outdoors, wine tasting, exploring local events, and attending music festivals (yes üòÄ even the occasional rave). I‚Äôve tried apps like Meetup and Bumble BFF, but I‚Äôve found they don‚Äôt always lead to meaningful connections or lasting friendships. So, I thought I‚Äôd try something a little more direct and personal.

Today I had one of those sachets of cappucino and I could actually stomach it and it gave me energy like I haven't had in weeks. I even cleaned and did aome laundry! Now I am back to being a couch potato but it's just a tip maybe it helps others :)",1,1753586301.0,pregnant,2,1.0,False
1mabw6g,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mabw6g,Turtle matching game,"Hi y'all!        I posted these turtles and the blank bag a while ago, but I just completed the embroidery last night at 330 am. Then the birthday boy received it today at noon! 
   I hope he loves it but amongst the trucks and most importantly, the wrapping paper, it held no candle.
Parents loved it though! 
   I put extra effort into sewing the turtles' million magic rings and left long ends to weave in and everything I could do to make sure they could handle lots of play and cleanings. 
 The embroidery I have almost no faith in lasting üòÖ it's all different types of thread some bought this year some from the 80s some from friendship bracelet kits. So who knows how long the colors will last or how much friction they can take before ripping. 
I'm also sad to see how pilled the bag got just kicking around my coffee table and couch.
  I wicked love the liner I made, it was super satisfying. I saved the fabric from a broken laundry thing, it was already a perfect circle so I centered the bag and what was left was the perfect length/height of the bag. No cutting required! I just tucked the excess as I sewed. Perfect slippy material for the turtles to slide out. 
The project is finally out of my sight! Done and gone! Good riddance!! Except I miss it a little lol

I came by to get my usual banana bread blonde‚Ä¶..

well I didn‚Äôt think anyone was working but a few people on shift.

I figured by time I got over to that side of town you‚Äôd be off shift or just didn‚Äôt work today‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

I pray you boom you show up when I stop by like it‚Äôs kind of wild‚Ä¶.the first time you showed up as I was waiting in line‚Ä¶.. any time I forget and I‚Äôm just going for coffee and my mind isn‚Äôt thinking about the what ifs with you.

My life is chaotic but you know with the kids it can get wild but we handle it the best we can and make every day a good day.

But your there almost every time and boom you still make sure I know‚Ä¶üòçü§Øü•µ 

I don‚Äôt know which one is more accurate‚Ä¶..


the fact that you see me and let it be known in your own way. 


You even stuck your tongue out playing around with my son‚Ä¶.üòõ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

you really don‚Äôt know how that hits with the first emoji and the last first it makes my heart melt‚Ä¶.thats mini C*** the fact I see you already projecting your interest in me your already attempting to be kind and playful with my kids‚Ä¶.thats just amazing in its self ‚ù§Ô∏èüôè


You know from just looking in from the outside that my kids are my entire life regardless of the chaos. 

You know some of my complex situations helping my children‚Äôs mother with the kids I made along side her.

They deserve both parents regardless if we aren‚Äôt together they don‚Äôt deserve any kind of side effects due to our emotions or situation.

I want to reach out I know you would like that but I can‚Äôt find you, your name I can‚Äôt recall I‚Äôve only heard it once and it was months ago.


I meditated and went down a list.

I wanted to believe it started with a T while meditating I moved to a J then ending on an M nothing making a connection.


Why do you always show up make me laugh brighten my day and then I can never ask you about how you feel towards me or just a simple could I get your name? If you‚Äôre comfortable with that of course.

I‚Äôd ask if you want to exchange snaps or numbers.

I dream of a day I can talk to you freely without restrictions or worrying about getting you in trouble.


But story time, you had been on a ladder when I came by‚Ä¶.you got off the ladder the second you saw/hear me and came out and said hi‚Ä¶.you know your very Gorgeous right?

I don‚Äôt even see you normally I think I‚Äôm more falling for your Energy and Radiance more so cause damn‚Ä¶..it‚Äôs great to just talk and laugh with you it‚Äôs so easy and relaxing I let my guard down around you.

Asap no more waiting .


Part 3 I hope üôè I hope ü§û 

Falling asleep writing this but still have you in my mind. 

At first I doubted myself I doubted how you felt but seeing as every time I come by you laugh smile and make it known by stopping your tasks and saying hi and you always say hello for as long as you can ü´∂ I can‚Äôt doubt it when you make your presence known and that energy is so Comforting‚Ä¶

So what I‚Äôve observed as I was told.


First you pop out make a joke about my doppelg√§nger.

Second we talk for as long as possible smiling and laughing and you played with my son through the window again melted me‚Ä¶..definitely got some big points with me on that and when I pulled up in line I never saw you pop out say hi to anyone‚Ä¶so I get to pay I start roaming and bomb just like Fate your hanging out the Sliding door looking gorgeous and just casting out the most comforting of energy‚Ä¶I want to know your sign because‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ü§§ I don‚Äôt understand it at all but it‚Äôs like the warmest blanket/hug and I want to know and understand why.


But I‚Äôm awkward and I don‚Äôt want to push or rush anything so patience is key but wow you really really got me today and also made it well known your interested why else pop out every time.

We clicked pretty quickly and got close fast. We talked openly about life, goals, and struggles, and over time, I met a lot of his friends and family. It genuinely felt like a deep friendship was forming.

That said, I started noticing some things. Charles could be really rigid in conversations (like he always had to be right). Even chill discussions would turn into debates. Still, I stuck around. I gave him relationship advice, shared job tips, and tried to support him whenever he needed it. I thought that support went both ways, but looking back, I‚Äôm not so sure.

Earlier this year, we were talking about politics and he told me he was conservative. He asked about my views and I said I leaned liberal. Right away, he said, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs probably just because of your dad.‚Äù I said yeah, my upbringing had some influence, but I‚Äôve formed my own opinions. He laughed and said, ‚ÄúHow much?‚Äù I told him I didn‚Äôt want to get into it and wasn‚Äôt going to quantify it. He kept going anyway, trying to convince me I actually agreed with him deep down. It didn‚Äôt feel like a respectful convo‚Äîit felt like he was trying to invalidate everything I said.

The next day, I texted him and said I felt disrespected by how he handled the conversation. I wasn‚Äôt aggressive (I just wanted to say how I felt and ask for an apology). He told me he doesn‚Äôt like texting and wanted to talk in person.

So we met up at Starbucks. I bought him a coffee, thinking we‚Äôd clear the air. Instead, it all blew up. The moment we sat down, he went off on me (said I was trying to tear him down, that I have low self-esteem, that I‚Äôm controlling, untrustworthy, and that I ‚Äúlove conflict""). It felt like he had been building up resentment and was now unloading all of it. I reminded him of how much I‚Äôd supported him (not to throw it in his face, but to show that I always had good intentions).

He ended the conversation by saying, ‚ÄúThis friendship is over.‚Äù Then he told me to get up and hug him. I said no, but offered a handshake instead. He shook my hand and walked away.

Afterward, I sent him one final message and blocked him. It basically said I didn‚Äôt agree with the things he said about me, and that I wasn‚Äôt okay with being insulted like that. I told him I didn‚Äôt want to be friends anymore and that I deserved better. I haven‚Äôt spoken to him since.

It‚Äôs been about 7 months now. I also stopped going to the church he invited me to. Recently, I overheard that he‚Äôs been telling people I‚Äôm ‚Äújust looking for attention‚Äù by not showing up anymore and staying silent. That honestly hurt, because I haven‚Äôt said a single bad thing about him to anyone‚ÄîI just left.

Now I keep wondering if I overreacted. Should I have just brushed it off instead of saying something? Did I make a big deal out of nothing? AIW?",5,1753585533.0,amiwrong,8,0.86,False

We technically dated for a year but broke up in February when she was asking for things I just financially could not afford. We've been in somewhat of a situation ship since February where we have still only been seeing each other but don't have a title. We spend every weekend together and she will often even drive to come stay with me a night during the work week. We live an hour apart so I do appreciate her traveling to see me. She still lives with her family so I only rarely will come to her house to see her. 

She is consistently passive aggressive and when she is mad will send me TikToks ""He didn't cheat but there's no dates, no effort, no flowers"" which is not applicable to our relationship what so ever - We actually go on dates every weekend (which is a financial burden I've been coping with because I genuinely do want to be with her). She complains we haven't taken any flights together, complains I am not paying for her maintenance (hair, nails, lashes) and generally does so in a way I feel belittled. I have explained that my current financial situation multiple times and she claims to understand but then it pisses me off when she claims I am not putting forth effort despite weekly dates and I have even planned trips for us this summer (one of which is supposed to be next weekend). It feels like what I do is not appreciate at all. We actually make about the same money but she lives with her family and doesn't pay rent so she has a lot more disposable income. 

She has definitely withdrawn physical intimacy too - although we do still have sex at least once when I see her - we used to be intimate A LOT more frequently. She tells me she just needs me to step it up and plan more dates - and fancier ones - and she wants me to do different things like take her to NBA games or an MLB game. I'm not opposed to this - just not sure how sustainable it is financially for me if I am still expected to keep up with all these other dates. 

I've communicated this to her and told her its getting to a point where I am feeling she doesn't want to be with me - she just wants experiences and doesn't mind if I am there. She took offense and again claims If I was ""doing more"" she would be much more affectionate again but it just feels like I'd be stupid to stretch myself thinner when I am already pretty stressed handling all of this (when in my mind she just doesn't like me the way she once did). 

When her and I started dating it wasn't like this at all - she would always tell me how much she missed me and drive out and just enjoy my presence - it seems we have to have exciting stuff to do all the time now... its kind of chunking my self esteem and I am normally a very confident guy. I have had multiple other women express interest in me but I've turned them all down despite technically being ""single"". 

She does do little things here and there that make me think she still cares for me like will send me a little money for my morning coffee when she gets her paycheck but its kind of in a position I genuinely don't feel wanted a lot of the time and I am already stretched thin and have no desire to stretch myself thinner for someone I feel isn't as interested in me anymore. 

Is it time to call it? All of this also really undermines my sense of security in the relationship and she does go out ALL the time to bars and clubs with her friends and recently hasn't been inviting me anymore like she used to. ",3,1753585296.0,relationship_advice,3,1.0,False

I drew him a portrait weeks ago and somewhat asks how's the drawing when we get to chat (we don't chat regularly, I always seem to initiate the conversation) I finally finished my drawing and decided to give him that along with a set of origami paper cause he mentioned he have been wanting to make origami flowers but never had the chance to. He was smiling while staring at the portrait then thanked him. After that, we grabbed coffee and just talked.

He mentioned that his friends bought him a dating app subscription for a week and he said he tried to make the most out of it then told me not to try cause it's not worth it. We just talked about a few more stuff. I'm supposed to go to a party but there's still time and we talked again in the pool area of their condo. He shared stuff about his mom, I just listened and gave him my insights. When I was about to leave, I told him that if I don't get drunk in the party, let's continue our chat, he agreed.

We met again after the party, we stayed in their home a bit and ate pizza, talked a bit about music, he also asked if I believe if guys and girls can be friends, I said yes and he said he kinda has a mixed reaction. He also asked if it's alright for a boy and girl friend to hangout if the person has a partner. I said, if the friend is really in the lowest point of his/her life, has a problem, wants to celebrate, or has been their friend for more than 5 or 10 years, it's alright with me. He said that he agrees, if the friend they hangout with is their friend for a long time.

After that, we grabbed coffee again, played 2 hours of billards, then slept on his room. I had 0 plans of sleeping there in the morning but I fell asleep for a few minutes while sitting and maybe he saw I look like a mess so he insisted that I should just sleep there. He slept on the floor and I slept on his bed (I feel bad cause it's cold on the floor even if he had giant pillows under him)

I get a feeling that he doesn't like me, because we haven't talked about our feelings yet, and we don't flirt up front. Maybe he just also hung out with me cause he's thankful for the portrait. Is it normal for a guy to hangout with someone who's interested in them?

We can start with a casual coffee date and if we like each other, we can talk about dating more and spending time together with the possibility of so much more. Let me know what kind of dynamic that you wish for, and we can adjust our situation to make it great for both of us. I'm open to short-term, friends, dating, and even maybe eventually long-term. I like outdoor activities such as hiking and bicycling and boating and tennis, and I would love an upbeat fun activities exercise partner. I also like staying at home and cooking dinner or watching a movie together. I would also like to explore new places and events with my girlfriend.

1mabe5p,https://www.reddit.com/r/wetbrain/comments/1mabe5p/i_think_i_got_wks_from_an_eating_disorder/,I think I got WKS from an eating disorder.,"Some background.  I started what I now know was an eating disorder after getting laid off in jan of 2019 and went on an overnight ""diet"" of \~1200 cal a day along with approx 20 miles a day on a bicycle.  I lost about 50lb by late fall when i started a job.  I would wake up early to get a 13mi ride in before work and usually another after work with the same 1200 cal intake.  When lockdowns happened I lost what little control I had and increased mileage to 25, 30, 40+ miles per day on a restriction.  I was down to 118lb by summer of 20 from a start of 200.  Frustrated that I was still ""Fat"" I accidentally learned that artificial sweeteners caused a laxative effect along with a coffee/caffeine intake that eventually hit 2\~3000mg per day (for real..)  I started ever increasing my fake sugar intake and added otc laxatives until I was having multiple daily bouts of diarrhea.  During this time my ""food"" was usually a breakfast of protein powder in coffee with maybe some puffed rice in artificially sweetened almond milk.  I would purge approx 3-4 times before riding \~30mi in all weather conditions.  Get home and have ""lunch"" consisting of coffee zero sugar jello topped with a 1/1 ratio of cocoa powder and granular erithrytol for crunch until diarrhea again.  Dinner was usually a dry cast iron skilled full of random vegetables on high heat until they were burnt to charcoal with some lettuce and zero sugar dressing.  This went on in one form or another until approximately fall of 23 when my new therapist basically said she couldn't help unless I could stop that otherwise I would be dead, disabled, or inpatient.

During this time I was fully avoiding treatment because I was worried if I was honest with my doctor I would get the help I should have gotten and I ""would have got fat""

I was experiencing near daily, crippling anxiety and panic attacks, muscle pain and leg cramps, joint pain, burning feet that I scratched to bleeding so bad my sheets would be stuck to them in the morning, balance issues, insomnia, irritability, depression, I was weak and constantly very tired and cold feeling, I became functionally illiterate (I could read a word or sentence but could not understand paragraphs),  my vision was out of focus along with daily nystagmus and hallucinating flashes of blue and white light and thrumbing noises in my ears. I was delirious and could not think.  I had to switch to children's audio books during bike rides because I couldn't make sense of adult literature, I had chronically numb hands and fingers and a tremor in my hands.

This went untreated for about 3 years..  I was intentionally trying to flush myself out every day as much as I could.  Calories eventually went up due to a binge/purge cycle but there was very little nutrient diversity.  I never thought I was an alcoholic but there was a problematic use of 1-4 drinks at night for a large portion of this due to depression and anxiety.  I wasn't "" a ton "" but it was for the wrong reasons and chronic.

I still exercise and purge but usually no more diarrhea and no more burnt dinners.  Probably a good 18 months now from the worst of it and I'm in recovery now but I've had many lasting effects.   Depression, anxiety, and apathy/numbness.  Not debilitating but regular balance and hand coordination issues.  Drooping left eyelid and blurry left eye.  Occasional slight horizontal nystagmus.  And recently I've become more aware of ongoing memory problems, and most concerning is I've noticed I confidently ""remembering"" things that didn't happen or happened way different than I remember.  There's big gaps in memories of things even in the last two years.

I actually did bring this up to my Psychiatrist two years ago but she immediately said no that for alcoholics, and I forgot about it until I found a purple wiki link last night while searching for memory issues in anorexia.

1mabcha,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1mabcha/ghosted/,Ghosted,"My name is Edward Foster. I'm a psychiatrist. I see patients, and I determine their ailments. I‚Äôm 38. I live alone, and I drink heavily. The demons in my head are making it difficult to type this out. This is very important, so listen up.



I have to tell you about my patient. My patient James. You see a lot of unfortunate cases of extremely unwell patients in this profession. Complete Norman Bates f\*cking psychos. Most of the time I'm booked up. The same people every week. Some of them I might not think were sick, but who else would come to my office every Wednesday and talk about every insecurity they have for 4 years straight. Sorry Janice.¬†



My schedule freed up when one of my patients died. I don‚Äôt beat myself up over it. Anyone in the profession will tell you it happens. I saw potential for Clark, but he couldn‚Äôt see it himself. Anyway, I had an opening.



James was different. He wasn‚Äôt obviously insane, and he wasn‚Äôt someone who just wanted to vent either. He was one that seemed normal. Normal to anyone who hit him up for chit chat, but it was when you had a long conversation with him. A long conversation revealed he was definitely unwell and probably a flight risk. He was just extremely good at masking it.¬†



So I sat down with him every Monday, and tried to figure him out. After multiple sessions he began to open up. He told me about his obsessions with the occult, demonology, alternate dimensions.



‚ÄúLots of people are fascinated with the occult doc. Lots of people. It doesn‚Äôt make me bad or evil. I'm just curious. Really curious, that's all. I can‚Äôt stop reading about it. I just- well Dr. Foster you should really check out the book I'm reading. By Crowley. It‚Äôs really something doc. Not dull stuff.‚Äù



I was curious what he wanted out of these sessions. No one was forcing him to see me. He came voluntarily. I thought maybe he was aware his mind was slipping.



And then I didn‚Äôt see James for months. He vanished, just like that. I didn‚Äôt think about it much. I went onward.¬†



Then one day I came home from work in the afternoon, and poured myself a scotch. My place is really clean, so I noticed the paper sitting on my counter. I sipped my scotch and read.



‚ÄúHey Dr. Foster, it‚Äôs me James. Please listen. Please listen to what I have to say. Below I have written 6 steps. Please follow the steps. I know it seems silly, but I will explain everything after. -your friend James‚Äù



These were the following steps.



‚ÄúStep 1: Go to the bathroom

Step 2: Close the door

Step 3: Turn on running water (sink, bathtub, or showerhead)

Step 4: Turn out the lights

Step 5: Get on your knees

Step 6: Say these ancient words



tsacy eht gnip eer c pu siohw‚Äù



It was unsettling, to know James had broken into my house. He didn‚Äôt take anything. Just left a stupid note. So I called the police. They searched the home, and didn‚Äôt find him. So they put a warrant out for his arrest, and that was it. I knew James was batsh\*t, bananas, a certified silly goose who belonged in a straightjacket.¬†



I was extremely cautious to lock every possible entrance to my house the following days. But the notes kept showing up. I called the police a couple more times, but there was nothing they could do. I had the option to stay somewhere else, but I wasn‚Äôt going to let James drive me out of my house. It would be too much of a pain to move, and I‚Äôve never seen him be violent. I figured I'd catch him, and talk some sense into him.



The creepiest part about all this is that there were no signs of entry anywhere. Everytime I came home the doors and windows were still closed and locked.¬†



The notes after the first go as follows:



1. ‚ÄúFoster this is not a joke. I told you what you have to do. I won‚Äôt cause you any trouble. Just do this one thing for me. -James‚Äù



‚ÄúStep 1: Go to the bathroom

Step 2: Close the door

1. ‚ÄúYou're going to regret this Foster.‚Äù



The last one chilled me to the bone, because of how I found it. I didn‚Äôt find it after coming home from work like the others. I was watching television on the couch with my feet on the coffee table. I got up to use the bathroom. When I came back it was there. On the coffee table. I knew immediately he was near. I called out to him. ‚ÄúJames come out here. Let‚Äôs talk about this.‚Äù Silence. ‚ÄúJames?‚Äù¬†



Then it began. A book flew off my shelf at mach speed, missing my head by a foot. Then my ceiling fan swung back and forth and fell.¬† An entity I couldn‚Äôt see was trashing my room. Papers flew about, chairs hurled at me, and my belongings smashed. Then everything stopped, for a moment. Then my old wooden baseball bat floated towards me and swung into my kneecap, my ribs, and my family jewels.¬†



As I laid on the floor groaning in pain, another note was written. It was crumbled up and thrown at my face.



‚ÄúI will f\*ck you up Edward. I will follow you. I will beat you. I will breathe on your face when you're in bed. I will do everything I can to make your life as painful, miserable, and uncomfortable as possible.‚Äù



‚ÄúStep 1: Go to the bathroom

Step 2: Close the door

Step 3: Turn on running water (sink, bathtub, showerhead)

Step 4: Turn out the lights

Step 5: Get on your knees

Step 6: Say these ancient words



tsacy eht gnip eer c pu siohw‚Äù



I folded immediately. I don‚Äôt like being hit with baseball bats, and I'm not fond of ghosts either. So I went to the bathroom to appease James. I closed the door, turned on my shower, and cut the lights. I got on my knees and forgot the words. I turned the light on, said the words over and over. Then I tried again. I turned the lights out and spoke the words best I could. ‚ÄúTsacy eht gnip eer c pu siohw.‚Äù¬†



My body was lifted off the ground. I heard voices, whispers. They weren‚Äôt in any language I knew. My best guess is middle eastern. Some sort of Hebrew or Arabic maybe? I did my best to move toward the light switch. I cut the lights on and what do ya know? My body was gone. Completely invisible. I had to feel around for the doorknob. It was difficult to even know where my hand was. The voices quieted down.



I opened the bathroom door and saw James. In the flesh James. He said your name. Yes, your name. You reading this. I can‚Äôt post your actual name or info here, because of some demon curses and website rules and regulations and stuff. It isn't important. What is important is I‚Äôm coming for you.



I've spent the last few days hearing voices, presumably demons giving me all kinds of information. For some reason they wouldn‚Äôt give me your phone number or anything. They told me you go on this website often though, and I could reach you by posting here. They also told me ‚ÄúRelease and be released.‚Äù I released James. That's what the demons call it anyway.



You see, when you release someone they get to choose the next victim. Someone released the first ghost, and the first ghost gave that person James‚Äô name. James released the second ghost. It gave James my name. Then I released James, and he gave me your name.¬†



I‚Äôm not sure who gave James my name. Who had it out for me? Is it a coincidence that James knew me before he and I were picked to become ghosts? I don‚Äôt know, but when you release me I will find and kill whoever involved me in this. Being a ghost f\*cking sucks. I can‚Äôt get the voices out of my head. People are terrified when I move any object. That was funny at first, but I'm tired of the screams now. I just want quiet.



Please listen to me. Don‚Äôt make it harder than it has to be. We can streamline this, and no one has to suffer for too long. You follow the steps, and then make the next one follow the steps.¬†



I'm on my way to your house. You have about a day. Why did James have to pick someone halfway across the states? I'm not sure why James picked you. Maybe you two have beef, or maybe he saw your name flipping through a newspaper in my house. Either way, the sooner you follow those steps, the sooner you can be released and kill him.¬†



Everything is explained to you now. There is nothing left, but for you to do what must be done. If you don‚Äôt I will torment you or make ghost love to your girlfriend or something. So do us both a favor and get it over with. In case you're too lazy to scroll up, here they are again.

1mabbza,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1mabbza/rf_the_night_at_brookside_community_center/,[RF] The Night at Brookside Community Center,"The Idea for this story came to me in a dream. 'most' of whats here happened in the dream. I just added for the story. Enjoy!

The snow began as a gentle little sprinkle. Quite lovely, really. The sort that makes you roll your eyes at the weather app because it insisted there‚Äôd be a ""historic winter event."" But in just twenty minutes, that gentle sprinkle escalated into a whiteout so dense that the road seemed to vanish completely. No lines, no shoulder, no idea where the world ended and the ditch started.

The wind was the worst part, not merely blowing, but pushing the car as if it had a personal vendetta.

""Mom, we‚Äôre not actually staying on the road, are we?"" her sixteen-year-old asked. He had that tone of someone trying to sound composed while already picturing their obituary.

""Nope,"" she replied, her jaw clenched, both hands gripping the steering wheel tightly. ""We‚Äôre getting off before we become a news story.""

She inched along until a parking lot light broke through the chaos, a halo in the blizzard. The sign, half-buried in snow, read: Brookside Community Center. The building was dark except for a faint glow at the back.

She pulled in and turned off the engine. The snow was already creeping up the tires. They sat in silence, the heater humming, the outside world resembling the apocalypse.

Her son was the first to speak. ""Bathroom?""

She shot him a look. ""If it‚Äôs locked, you‚Äôre not peeing in the car.""

They trudged through the snowdrifts to the front doors. To their surprise, they were unlocked. The place had a faint smell of bleach and basketball sneakers, but it was warm. That was good enough.

They hit the bathrooms, but before the sinks stopped running, they heard tires crunching outside. Then again. And again.

Within an hour, the lobby transformed into a waiting room for storm refugees: families, a few college kids, a trucker, and some guy walking his golden retriever (because apparently that was his plan for the evening). Everyone shared the same story: roads were gone, visibility was zero, and they were all waiting for the plows.

Initially, nobody really spoke much. Just a bunch of strangers gazing out the large glass windows, their phones lighting up as they checked the radar every five seconds, as if that would make a difference. But gradually, the atmosphere relaxed.

The truck driver pulled out a huge thermos filled with coffee. ""This is going to go to waste if no one helps me drink it,"" he remarked. Cups started appearing from glove compartments like some bizarre magic trick.

A mother with little kids dumped a box of crackers on the counter. ""Looks like a community potluck, huh?"" she said with a shrug.

One of the college students stumbled upon a vending machine and, after some fiddling with a credit card and a bit of questionable ethics, liberated a bunch of chips and candy bars. No one complained.

The guy with the dog turned into the unofficial emotional support unit. Everyone gave the golden retriever a pat at least once, some even multiple times, because nothing makes a blizzard more bearable than a warm dog head resting in your lap.

Someone found that the gym had thick blue mats and dragged them out to make the hard tile floor more comfortable. Another person discovered a closet full of board games. By midnight, the lobby didn‚Äôt feel like a lobby anymore. It felt like a quirky, makeshift neighborhood, complete with snacks, coffee, a snoring dog, and a growing group of half-frozen folks getting to know each other.

The storm continued to howl against the glass, but inside, things became oddly‚Ä¶ peaceful. Not exactly cheerful, but steady. People exchanged stories about their destinations, the worst weather they‚Äôd ever encountered, and what they‚Äôd do first once they could finally leave. Nobody was in a hurry.

At some point, someone unearthed a tangled mess of Christmas lights in a storage room, likely leftover from some event, and strung them up in the lobby. The warm glow made the entire place feel cozier, as if they weren‚Äôt just passing the time but genuinely sharing it.

The mom and her son even got into a heated game of Uno, which ended with the trucker declaring he was done with card games for good. The golden retriever barked as if he agreed.

Nobody really got any sleep. The wind was too noisy, the floor was too hard, and technically they were all trespassing, which made the whole night feel a bit surreal. But when dawn finally arrived and the plows rolled by, the outside world seemed like a fresh start, quiet, white, and safe once more.

People started packing up. They waved goodbye, exchanged phrases like ""Good luck"" and ""Drive safe"" and ""Text me when you get home"", fully aware that most of those numbers would likely never be dialed. Nobody had the right words to describe what the night had been like, so they just let it go.

The mom and her son were among the last to head out. As they stepped into the crisp morning air, her son looked back at the community center.

""Do you think anyone will believe us when we share this story?"" he asked.

She smiled, brushing snow off his hood. ""Probably not. But it‚Äôs a good one, right?""

And together, they drove off into the peaceful morning, a bit tired, a bit sore, but somehow feeling lighter.",1,1753584129.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

I came back from a work trip late 2024 at a rural cabin excited to lie in my own bed and laid in my bed and smelled patchouli (she‚Äôs always drenched in it) and realized she had slept in my bed! On my side! I kept my baby monitor on so I could see my little son go to sleep and knew my partner was asleep in our sons room with him bc I have a wifi camera. He said he never gave her permission to sleep in our bed. So I know that instead of sleeping on our couch she helped herself to our BEDROOM. She hasn‚Äôt slept over since then bc I said I AM DONE! I am currently starting traumatic birth therapy this week. Back to 2023 she snuck into my hospital room at 5-6am when I was spending the night after emergency c section and blurted out ‚Äúoh is he (her adult son) sleeping? I texted him!‚Äù Yes he was sleeping, in the hospital room just like me and baby were. And proceeded to drop off coffees beside me and go okay guess I‚Äôll go now! she woke me up sneaking/barging in and gave me a full blown panic attack! She had already been to the hospital twice the day before (the day of my emergency surgery) and even pulled her son to ‚Äúgo for coffee‚Äù within hours of sons birth before I had even gotten to do skin to skin and the 3 of us (partner baby and I) hadn‚Äôt even spent time bonding yet and I had no idea where he was!! I had to call him and he said ‚Äúoh my mom wanted to go for coffee! (in the hospital cafeteria)‚Äù. The first time she stayed over in 2023 after baby was born (when she would stay on our couch, almost every other weekend, bc we have no extra bedroom and she refuses to sleep in RV with full kitchen and bathroom that we have on property for guests) she fell down the stairs drunk. She told me in front of him make sure you do your stretches! And pointed to the vagina (stretch it for birth?) and ask for an episiotomy! she asks deeply personal questions all the time. 

Her last text to both of us was ‚ÄúAre you ok!‚Äù followed by his grandmother and father (he was pressured to call son and even guilt tripped for not worrying about him more) due to a thunderstorm warning in our area on my due date!! A little storm! I‚Äôm 38 years old! We‚Äôre fine!!! Last week, the day before my due date with #2, she showed up in my driveway as I was leaving the house because she was heading to the farmers market in my town 45 mins away and she ‚Äúwanted to show her friend where we live!‚Äù I‚Äôm absolutely petrified that she‚Äôll show up at the hospital again or show up at our house and haven‚Äôt sent a text yet about boundaries but plan to.",6,1753584068.0,motherinlawsfromhell,1,1.0,False

I work at a small coffee shop and as it's getting closer to 2pm, I start to run the dish water so I can get some of the dishes done early. We close.at 4pm. And after running the sani sink and dropping the sanitizer tablets in the one sink, I run the other sink. And after finishing up filling that sink I grab the dish soap we use. And as I squeeze the pump the first time nothing came out. So I pushed a second time really hard, and the next thing I feel is a very strong burning sensation coming from my left eye. Unfortunately for me, due to a birth defect in my right eye, I can't see very well. I had to grab the bottle of soap and run to across the store.  to the cashier who was the middle of taking someone's order, so she could read to me how long i needed to rinse my eye out and if we needed to contact a hospital.

1mab8m4,https://www.reddit.com/r/callofcthulhu/comments/1mab8m4/dead_lights_review_the_good_the_bad_and_the/,"Dead Lights Review, The Good, The Bad, and The Drenched","Howdy all, I return yet again to actually talk about todays game, but first, a preamble. CoC isn't our main game, that would be Traveller, but when someone's not available, I had the thought to run my friends through some CoC scenarios since the one shots we'd done before had been hits. We're playing in the 1920s in west Michigan, around the greater Grand Rapids area, and likely into the great lakes area itself. Our investigators are a union activist who is out of town, a photojournalist who drove ambulances in the European War, and now a veteran of that very war turned civilian auto mechanic.

  
So a month has passed since our run through Paper Chase when our union advocate and our journalist Hellen had their run in with dear Uncle Douglas; our new character Jim the mechanic comes together with Hellen for a drive to Lansing to see a medium. The PCs are a part of a small occultist society/astrology club/social club, mostly an excuse to have new friends and associates come around if someone dies and people that may come asking for help when everyone thinks they're a crank. 

  
So the start is pretty simple here, investigators are on the way to a thing, and along the way they have Emilia run out onto the road. Player made the drive check by burning a few luck points, but didn't go off the road and get stuck so that's good. They bring her to the rest stop and come in to see that Jake's truck is across the road, and he's raving some before going down to sit at a booth with some coffee. Sam and the Brewers recognized Emilia when the investigators brought her into the diner, and they suggested to the investigators that they may want to find her grandfather, but warned that the hill to the Webbs place may be washed out and tough to get to, but after a hard drive check, they were able to park at the home. One of them was also able to get Jake to move his truck, with much protesting from him.

  
The search was interesting, and they found the important things, the journal, the bible, and they did take the box and wax after saying 'Well why should we?' and kind of mulling over leaving it behind, but they take it in the end. Don't opt to search the basement, which is fine I guess. On leaving, they start drifting down the hill, and totally bungle the drive down. Making it worse, this was the first appearance of the Dead Light itself. Coming from the higher hill, and rolling down to them, they had one chance to either run, or try and get the car unstuck. So this turned into a foot chase to the road where they both indeed survived, yay for us. But I will talk about a misstep with this chase.

  
Back at the diner, thoroughly soaked they found Emilia conscious but shaky and she talked with them, telling them the little she remembered, as well as what the deal with the box was, as far as she knew. Again, not much. Eventually though as really, nothing was moving forward and they were just expecting Emilia to start telling them what this was, they took notice that the waitress Mary was gone, and Winnie Brewer said that she'd just gone out back, and coming out, Mary's footprints went a little ways to the woods, but got lost in the brush. They found out that Jake had actually been kicked out of the diner and was riding out the storm in his truck and decided to go talk to him a little bit and see what they could get there. But feeling the group spinning their wheels they saw the dead light under the truck, before burning its way into the cabin. Screaming, a gunshot, and a flare of light came, and they just ran for it, the Dead Light coming after them. Sam came out of the office, saw it, and just ran for the diner. Close to the pumps and nearly overtaken by the Dead Light, a bolt of lightning slammed the ground near it, and scared it off.

  
Regrouping in the diner, the players kept figuring that they'd need to sacrifice someone, or find a way to just run from this thing, they weren't thinking electricity, and a few times were talking about like, leaving the box outside for it to go into. I called for an idea roll, and a failed idea roll lead to the Dead Light just barreling through a wall. Hitting live wires seemed to slow it though, and the investigators made the connection that electricity may be one of its weaknesses, especially after one of them fired a few bullets into it, and it did nothing while the Brewers were eaten. 

  
Into the final stretch they tried stripping parts out from Jake's truck and the service station to make a lightning rod, with Emilia and Hellen leading the Dead Light on a wild goose chase while the only other two made the rod. Things were getting desperate though, and Jim climbed the ladder of the barn, failing the roll, and burning what was left of his luck to make the climb through the lashing wind and rain, nail down the rod and throw a wire down to a steel plate from the truck. They watched on as Emilia ran over the plate, closely followed by the Dead Light, and a bolt from the sky slammed down, killing the entity. 

  
Deciding to spend the night in the stations office, they traded a couple bottles of Canadian whiskey around until they could call the Sherriff and state troopers. And while collecting their statements federal agents came in and just told everyone they hadn't seen anything. So end of session, nobody died, and I made some changes, and mistakes.

Changes: Not too many here, I ended up making the Brewers into a couple who run the diner, they actually are included in the dramatis persona section, and I liked the idea of this retired older couple running this little cafe on nights instead of being random travelers. Not a big change really. Otherwise, I did move it to between Ionia and Portland Michigan, but I still kept the Webbs as coming from the east coast, specifically a town called Arkham with Godfrey Webb having a practice in Boston.

Mistakes I made: Big one I'd say was having the first chase break off like I did. I honestly kinda forgot Billy was in this until the players were running, and for whatever reason, I had Billy be hiding out in the woods at the bottom of the hill to the Webbs. When they were running away they saw some guy run out from the trees, only to be overtaken and eaten by the light. No idea why I played it out like this, and I was pretty upfront with this, I should have had lightning strike near the Dead Light to give that clue that electricity was important, which would hopefully be reinforced by the lightning strike at the service station. It took an idea roll for them to stop thinking that it was gasoline? Yeah that was kind of an odd one, don't see where they got that. Another mistake was also just how I described of Clem, the players didn't search him or Doc Webb, and never found the connection between him and Mary at the diner, so the conspiracy angle was kinda missing, I said that Clem was gone from about the pectorals down, and didn't factor in like, describing a shirt pocket or something they could search. They also opted not to search the basement, not a failing on my side, I did ask a couple times if they were or were not, so the generator was never in play.

The only other major issue that I would say was had was, the investigators kept thinking in terms of skill rolls a lot of times, and not really how the things they found can kind of come together. They were also seeing things and really focusing hard on them, like Emilia's necklace being a magic pendant, thinking that they needed holy water after finding the bible, that a thief had torn the instructions on how to control the dead light from the journal despite it being in a locked bureau under other papers. They were also assuming that the doctor was going to sacrifice Emilia to the Dead Light to keep it satiated, that the Webbs were in a cult, or that Doctor Webb had killed Emilia's parents to do evil cult things to her when in reality, Emilia has just had a really unfortunate life. I talked with them after the game was over and cleared up some confusions, mostly that all of this was a massive accident basically. My other thing was time, I kinda wanted a little more time at the start to make them think that the investigation was all going to be at the medium reading, but you know, things happen, so I kind of expedited that part of the game to get to the game proper. Don't think the game was hurt by this, but could have been improved you know?

So, thoughts, conclusions, and addendums: I really like this scenario. I really like how it's set up to kind of waylay the players with this side of the road and I am very interested in trying Saturnine Chalice now as well. I like the physical printing of this book, it's a thin soft cover and the PDF comes with a separate PDF for the maps and handouts, some good stuff here. Quality art all throughout and I like the general layout where we have the general layout first, the dramatis persona section, and then we get to the start with the road encounter. The investigation is also fun in having people to pick off one by one, making it really more of a survival adventure at points instead of a straight up mythos hoedown or normal investigation. Plus it has a whole 'ending it' section that goes over some of the ways to defeat the monster, as well as concequences for not doping that, which I think is pretty nice. It's pretty open, but has several solutions. The monster is also just really cool, so props to that.

 Some things I'm not a fan of? One BIG criticism. I do not like the journal, mostly that we don't have a print writeup of what it says. The cursive isn't the worst, but I found it annoying to read, and I could see someone with worse eyesight just struggling hard with it. 

  
Overall I would say it's a really solid scenario, and I would absolutely recommend it to another keeper. I could even see this being modified and adapted to different time periods and locations, a roadside pub in a gaslight game, a proper diner and rest stop in the atomic age, maybe a lonely town with a post office and a saloon in a game of Darker Trails.",1,1753583831.0,callofcthulhu,0,1.0,False

A few days (or a week?) ago, I posted a picture of something I found under the pantry stairs.

It was a small hole; the bricks either moved or were destroyed. I found that while the house was in its ""quiet"" phase, I could hear the breathing of what has slept in the house.

Now that the house is awake, the hole is silent. But it has grown to the size of a small door. The bricks have been burrowed to the sides, dirt and gravel forming a small tunnel that sharply dips into the earth. The smell of rotten food came from its depths, and I almost gagged. I don't have the courage to venture into it and drive out the thing that lives within.

I can't go outside anymore. The doors and windows of the house do not open. The rare times that I find a window latch unlocked or the door to the backyard ajar, I find myself facing not the outside world, but the room I was coming from. Like an infinite corridor.

The first time this happened, I was freaked out to say the least. I may have vomited some pizza pockets and cried as I fell to my knees.

After my pity party, I ran from door to door. That's how I learned that not all doors opened anymore. I tried to break through one of the windows, desperate to escape, but they were no longer frail. Their worn wooden frames had the strength of steel, and the window panes were resistant to any heavy objects thrown against them. I owe Bryce a new dining room chair.

After a few hours, I accepted that I should've left Bryce's house to damnation along with all of its ghosts and ghouls and deer skulls, and I decided to get a snack. That is when it sank in.

If I can't leave, how can I get groceries? Food? The pantry is raided on a nightly basis, and there was hardly anything in the house before my car became a chew toy.

Currently, my food supplies are nothing but some bread and salt I bought so I could follow Bryce's email‚Äîand a big bag of salt to throw in the bathtub.

Speaking of the bathtub, the woman in the bathroom has become more vocal these past few nights, even with the salt. I think that whatever is happening to this house, it is becoming stronger.

I think that my genius plan of catching evidence that I wasn't alone, that I stubbornly refused to leave, has angered whatever is in the house.

No, I know now for certain that it did.

Anyway, I was getting out of the shower, hoping the hot water would clear my head, when I looked up.

The mirror, covered in steam, began to shift. Letters began to appear on the glass, like an invisible finger wrote them‚Äîlike the writing on the wall in the Bible.

It didn't write much, and it was in English, fortunately.

On the fogged bathroom mirror, in long trails of condensation, were the words:

""THE GUEST STAYS""

And then, later:

""IT WANTS TO GO HOME""

I don't know who ""it"" is. Maybe the thing I saw in the doorknob. Maybe something worse. And the voice in the bathroom‚ÄîI heard it again. A woman, whispering from the drain.

""Why are you still here?""

""You shouldn't have stayed.""

""It wants to go home.""

After that, the whispering stopped. I walked out of the bathroom and almost tripped, catching myself on a nearby wall. I looked down to see what I had caught my toe on.

Footsteps, or the hoof-prints that I had seen before, indented into the wood. The odd symbols that spiraled on my bedroom door had found a new home within the hoof-prints: a path of swirling symbols leading across the house.

I had a sneaking suspicion where they led, and I was not surprised to find that it led to the den beneath the pantry stairs.

After a few hours of rummaging and gathering resources across the house, I checked Bryce's previous email and followed each command like a checklist.

The first thing I did was find the doll (which had moved back to the dining room) and put it in my back pocket. If it was designed to protect, it was time for it to shine. If it was something the deer skull desired, then I guess I'm as good as dead trapped in the house anyway.

A very grim win-win situation. I can't help but laugh in despair.

The next thing I did was put down some salt and bread on the dining room table. I prepared it where the doll normally sits, and I moved a motion sensor to face the chair.

I know that at this point I don't need evidence that something is here: I know for certain that something is living beneath the house. But in all honesty, my curiosity was getting the better of me.

Maybe if I saw what it was, I could find a way to get rid of it?

Maybe even... kill it?

Even by typing this, I feel something growing in my chest.

A sense of desperation. A sense of fear. A feeling of bloodlust is swelling within me at the thought of escaping this cage.

I didn‚Äôt sleep at all last night.

I tried. I swear I did. I even took one of the old sleep meds I had hidden in the back of my travel bag‚Äîthe same ones I used in high school when my brain wouldn‚Äôt shut up. But they didn‚Äôt work. Or maybe they did, and the fear just steamrolled them.

Because the second I turned off the lights and got under the covers, the house started talking again.

Not voices. Not words. But sound. Creaks. Groans. A thump behind the drywall, like something dropped and rolled to a stop. The long, wet drag of breath moving down the hallway.

And the whisper of salt shifting.

I sat up around 2:30 AM. My phone buzzed on the nightstand. No texts. No calls. Just a notification from the motion cam in the dining room. One clip.

I didn‚Äôt want to watch it. But I did.

The video started like normal. Dim light. Shelves in shadow. The offering I left that evening still sitting on the floor: bread and a small bowl of salt. All perfectly still.

Then the screen rippled.

Not static‚Äîrippled. Like something moved through it.

The bread slid sideways. The salt tilted as if a gust of hot breath passed over it. And then, just for one second, the camera glitched‚Äînot full static, just a flicker.

A shape.

Tall, crouched, with long jointed limbs and a pale blur at the top. Something like antlers. The moment it appeared, the screen froze.

And then cut to black.

When I crept downstairs hours later, the offering was gone. Not just disturbed. Gone. The dish. The bread. All of it.

No crumbs. No footprints. Just salt residue leading into the pantry. And the spiral symbol etched deep into the floor again. This one was different, though. Not curled like a hoof.

It looked like a doorway.

Around 5 AM, I gave up trying to pretend I was fine. I made coffee, then stood at the edge of the hallway staring at the wall of the pantry for over an hour.

The symbols had grown again overnight. They're trailing from the hole beneath the pantry stairs now. Thin and deliberate. Like runes. All across the walls.

And the hole looks... deeper.

I dropped a marble in it just to test. I waited. No sound. No bounce. Just silence.

There is something beneath the house. And I think it's fully awake now.

I needed answers. Real answers. Not just guesses from Bryce or messages scratched in condensation.

So I tried something stupid.

I pulled out one of the pantry cameras, rewired it to stream to my laptop, and placed it directly in front of the hole. Then I sat there. All morning. Watching.

Nothing. Just darkness.

But then, at exactly 11:11 AM, the screen shifted.

Just for a second. Like something moved past the lens.

I rewound. Frame by frame. And there, in three blurry stills, was an eye.

Huge. Reflective. Pupil like a vertical slit. No eyelid.

Just staring into the camera.

I think that was its warning.

Later in the afternoon, I went back to the bathroom.

The salt ring I remade that morning had been broken. Something had stepped through it. The footsteps were faint, like hooves, but wider. Two toes.

I didn‚Äôt replace it. I stood in the hallway and asked aloud:

""What do you want?""

No answer.

So I tried again.

""What are you?""

The light in the bathroom flickered.

Then the mirror fogged again, but slower this time. Like breathing steam from the inside out.

A new message appeared:

""IT WAS BROUGHT.""

""NOW IT IS LOST.""

""IT WANTS TO GO HOME.""

I stared at those words until they began to drip.

And then, underneath it, another line scrawled itself in crooked letters:

""YOU ARE MEANT TO STAY.""

It makes sense now. Or at least, more than it did.

Bryce didn‚Äôt just inherit a haunted house. He brought something here. From Russia, maybe. A ghost? A guest that was never supposed to leave its home? Maybe even a house spirit. And now, it‚Äôs stuck.

No wonder it‚Äôs angry.

The bread and salt... they‚Äôre not just offerings or protection. They're pleas. Ways to keep it calm. Ways to say: We acknowledge you.

But they‚Äôre not enough anymore.

It wants to go back.

And the worst part is, I don't think it can.

A few hours ago, I tried one last thing. I took a fresh piece of bread, salt, and a cup of water.

Then I wrote a note:

""How do I help you go home?""

I left it there. Went upstairs. Waited.

Around midnight, I came back down.

Everything was gone.

And burned into the wall, directly above the table, was one word:

""ROOTS.""

I don‚Äôt know what it means. Not exactly. But I have a feeling this house was never meant to be its home. It was planted here, not grown here.

Like a tree ripped from soil and forced into a cracked pot.

And now it‚Äôs angry. And surrounded by strangers who keep moving its furniture and telling it to stay still.

I haven‚Äôt left the living room for the past 3 hours.

The pantry door creaked open a few minutes ago.

I didn‚Äôt close it.

There‚Äôs something standing at the bottom of the stairs inside. I can see the tips of the antlers. Just barely.

## Key Features Analysis

The effectiveness of a laptop privacy screen hinges on several key features, each contributing to its overall performance and user experience.

**Privacy Angle:** A crucial specification of any privacy screen is its viewing angle. The narrower the angle, the more effectively it restricts visibility to those directly in front of the screen. Most high-quality screens offer a 60-degree viewing angle, meaning that anyone outside of a 30-degree radius from the centre will see a darkened or completely black screen. Some advanced models boast even narrower angles, enhancing privacy in highly sensitive environments.

**installation Method:** Privacy screens typically employ one of two installation methods: adhesive or hanging. Adhesive screens are permanently attached to the laptop display, providing a seamless look and consistent privacy. Hanging screens, on the other hand, clip onto the top of the screen, allowing for easy removal and reattachment. Your choice depends on your preference for permanence versus convenience. Consider the size of the bezel for hanging style options because very thing bezel laptops might not able to use hanging option.

**Screen Finish:** Privacy screens come in either matte or glossy finishes. Matte finishes reduce glare and fingerprints, making them ideal for users who work in brightly lit environments. Glossy finishes, while offering enhanced clarity and color vibrancy, can be prone to reflections and smudges. The best choice depends on your individual viewing preferences and typical usage environment.**Blue Light filter:** Many modern privacy screens incorporate a blue light filter to reduce eye strain during prolonged use. Blue light emitted from digital screens can disrupt sleep patterns and contribute to digital eye strain. A built-in filter helps mitigate these effects, making the screen more comfortable to use for extended periods. it is becoming more notable since people working longer hours in front of the computer.

**Thickness and Durability:** The thickness of a privacy screen can impact its compatibility with certain laptop models, particularly those with thin bezels. Thicker screens may also slightly reduce screen brightness. Durability is equally critically important, as a well-constructed screen will resist scratches and damage. Look for screens made from high-quality materials that can withstand daily wear and tear.

Key features of the better laptop privacy screens include:

* Narrow viewing angle
* Choice of installation method
* Matte or glossy finish options
* Integrated blue light filter
* Scratch-resistant construction

## Core Benefits

Investing in a quality laptop privacy screen offers a range of practical benefits,from enhanced security to improved user comfort.

**Data Security:** The primary benefit of a privacy screen is its ability to protect sensitive information from visual hacking. Whether you're working on confidential documents, accessing financial accounts, or handling personal data, the screen prevents onlookers from viewing your screen, mitigating the risk of data breaches and privacy violations.This is especially important in public spaces where visual surveillance is common.

**Reduced Eye strain:** By incorporating a blue light filter, privacy screens can significantly reduce eye strain associated with prolonged screen use. Blue light emitted from digital devices can cause headaches, blurred vision, and difficulty focusing. The filter blocks harmful blue light, promoting eye comfort and reducing the risk of digital eye strain, particularly for users who spend many hours in front of their laptops. Many users have said it helps them to sleep better after work is also done.

**Enhanced Focus:** Distractions are common in public environments, such as coffee shops and shared workspaces. A privacy screen can help you stay focused on your work by minimizing visual distractions. The darkened screen discourages others from glancing at your screen, allowing you to concentrate on your tasks without being constantly interrupted by external stimuli. This can lead to increased productivity and improved work quality.

**Improved Privacy in Travel:** When traveling on airplanes or trains, space and privacy are often limited. A laptop privacy screen ensures that your work remains confidential and prevents fellow passengers from viewing sensitive information.This is particularly valuable for business travelers who need to work on confidential projects while on the go. You will have peace of mind.

## FAQs section

Addressing common consumer questions helps clarify the features and benefits of laptop privacy screens.**Will a privacy screen affect my laptop's display quality?**
A high-quality privacy screen should have minimal impact on display quality. some screens may slightly reduce brightness, but this can typically be adjusted in your laptop's display settings. Look for screens with high transparency to maintain optimal image clarity and color accuracy. Lower quality products will have worse quality, but the popular privacy screens are very good at maintaning clarity.

**can I remove and reapply an adhesive privacy screen?**
While some adhesive privacy screens can be removed, they are generally designed for permanent installation. Removing and reapplying the screen may damage the adhesive, reducing its effectiveness. Hanging-style privacy screens offer a better option if you need to frequently remove and reattach the screen. If you wish to remove it and reapply, it may be easier to purchase a new adhesive strip and use that the reattach.**Are privacy screens available for all laptop sizes?**
Privacy screens are available in a wide range of sizes to fit most laptop models. Measure your laptop screen diagonally to determine the correct size. It's crucial to choose a screen that fits your laptop's display dimensions precisely to ensure optimal privacy and a seamless installation. There are many sizes and aspect ratios to consider.

**How do I clean my laptop privacy screen?**
Clean your laptop privacy screen with a soft, lint-free cloth. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as these can damage the screen's surface. Gently wipe the screen in a circular motion to remove dust,fingerprints,and smudges. Using screen cleaner spritz lightly on the clean cloth, and never directly on the screen.

1maavri,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roleplay/comments/1maavri/f4m_long_term_detailed/,[F4M] long term detailed,"Hi friends! I‚Äôm 29F and currently deep in the trenches of an endless roleplay partner search‚Ä¶ and honestly, it‚Äôs starting to feel like a tragic slice-of-life RP of its own.

I‚Äôve recently struck out with three partners ü•≤because I was apparently ‚Äútoo detailed.‚Äù Meanwhile, they were serving me five-sentence replies like we were on a word count diet. No hate‚Äîjust not my vibe.

So here I am, waving my little white RP flag, asking:

Are you someone who loves depth, detail, and diving into characters?

Do you get excited over slow burns, wholesome moments, and a little splash of drama?

Are you a male, 21+ who writes in first person and doesn‚Äôt ghost after 2 replies?

Writing Sample: (Cozy, emotional, slow burn vibes)

I sat on the edge of the kitchen counter, legs swinging slightly as the smell of coffee filled the air. ‚ÄúYou always make it too strong,‚Äù I teased, even though I‚Äôd never once turned down a cup.

The sleeves of your hoodie swallowed my hands as I curled them into the fabric, pretending I wasn‚Äôt watching your every move as you shuffled around like you belonged here. Maybe you did.

‚ÄúDo you think,‚Äù I said after a long pause, my voice quieter now, ‚Äúthat this could actually work?‚Äù

You didn‚Äôt answer right away, and that silence‚Äîthe one that used to make me nervous‚Äîjust wrapped around the room like a warm blanket. It was terrifying, how much comfort I‚Äôd found in you. How easily this had started to feel like something I‚Äôd miss, even though it hadn‚Äôt ended yet.

Let‚Äôs cut to the chase: Kim Kwang-hyun is the human equivalent of a 100-proof whiskey. Last time out, he left Ryu Hyun-jin looking like a rookie who forgot how to tie his cleats, allowing just 2 runs over 6 innings while Hanwha‚Äôs ace unraveled in a single, catastrophic frame.

**Key Stats to Know**:

* **Kim Kwang-hyun**: 3.96 ERA, 6-7 record, but 6 straight seasons with 100+ strikeouts *and* 100+ innings. He‚Äôs the KBO‚Äôs version of a durable coffee machine‚Äîalways there, never breaking.
* **Ryu Hyun-jin**: 3.56 ERA, 6-5 record, but his latest outing was so brief, it could‚Äôve fit into a commercial break. If he doesn‚Äôt complete 2 innings again, his teammates might start hiding the ball.

**Odds Breakdown**:

* **Moneyline**: SSG Landers (-115) and Hanwha (+105) are nearly even, but the implied probability (52.4% for SSG) suggests bookmakers see this as a toss-up. Don‚Äôt be

I will also need a new monitor but that's a seperate purchase from the $5,000 (recommendations for that as far as gaming would be helpful).  I can put the money directly into just one of the options or split the difference for both.

Hopefully I can get some great input and advice on the three options I provide. I also know that I'm going to get dragged for some of my lack of knowledge and I'm totally fine with that if I can get steered in the right direction. All of my work laptops have generally been MacBooks that worked well-ish for the most part. Now that I've chosen to go the contract route and do more work-from-home I need some advice on the best gaming-productivity setup.

For games I mainly play single-player games - Mass Effect, Skyrim, Fallout, Starfield, The Outerworlds, CyberPunk, and any golf game. Not big into multiplayer games as I generally just suck at Call of Duty or Fortnight.

For business I need something that can handle large datasets and works well with Tableau, Power BI and Sisense. In the past a strong CPU and 16 GB of RAM could get it done as cloud servers did a lot of the heavy lifting. Recently, 32 GB was decent enough for most jobs but not all. Probably the most important part is that I work with clients needing GIS mapping and analysis such as ESRI. 32 gb of RAM can handle much of this but some of the more graphically intensive datasets that are built on multiple layers probably need around 64.  So any laptop would either need 64 gb soldered or be upgradeable.

This is where I'm going to get made fun on the most when I describe my two computers right now. They work but I pretty much hit 100 percent of the CPU and RAM on both and after that it's slow cookin.

I've heard prebuilt desktops sometimes use cheaper motherboards and RAM to bring the price down so if these specs suck please let me know. Regardless of the options I'll need to add another 4tb SSD.

The third option is the ROG Zephrus G16 5080 with 64 gb of RAM for $3,500. I won't put it here unless people feel it's a viable option as well for what I need. I just know power wise it doesn't deliver like the others do. Eluktronics might be another option but I don't know enough about them.

Everything I've read online says laptops aren't true desktop replacements but if the Legion is close enough then it might be the best choice.

If I get one of these I can wait another 9 months to a year before purchasing the second to see if there are better configurations or prices. I'm also looking at the LG 5K2K monitor but heard there might be another one coming out soon and can wait to see what it might be.

  
Edit: I should also mention when I game I've been using Game Pass and GeForce Now which is how I get away with such bad PCs at home.

Fuck trend followers, bring back uniqueness and niche please

***Update:*** I love people getting into tea, I think it‚Äôs great and I‚Äôve always been an advocate for it over coffee, but what bothers me is people hopping on the trend just because and not really taking it seriously, and seeing the cans upon cans of matcha being hoarded and sold at 5x price on eBay. It‚Äôs crippling Japan‚Äôs supply chain and upending Uji‚Äôs economy. All demand is not good demand. 

75% of the people getting into matcha or liking matcha in the past few months are not making it traditionally, yet they are still the ones buying the expensive, heavily shaded varietals which are the hardest to produce. And the heavy shading doesn‚Äôt even matter anymore when you add billions of syrups into a latte. 

And it‚Äôs not just normal consumers, matcha chains across the US (cough cough Cha Cha Matcha) are buying tons of ‚Äúceremonial grade‚Äù matcha, leaving them out in open air and light in a massive tub to rot and putting a tiny amount into a concoction frappaccino.

You stop at the door, looking at it like it might bite. Light‚Äôs off. No movement. But you know she‚Äôs in there. Awake, probably. Sore with silence.

Jonathan glances sideways at you. ‚ÄúYou gonna go in?‚Äù

You nod, slow. ‚ÄúYeah. Just‚Ä¶ not yet.‚Äù

He follows you to the backyard. Your hammock sways faintly in the breeze like it‚Äôs calling you back.

The branch above dips soft as you climb in, curling into the web of it like you belong there. The air‚Äôs still thick: warm, filled with crickets and distant traffic and whatever it is that only happens after midnight, when everything‚Äôs quiet but somehow heavier.

Jonathan drops to the grass beside you, arms looped around his knees. He looks wrecked in that soft way, emotionally jetlagged but trying to pretend it‚Äôs just the weed.

You let your hand dangle off the side of the hammock, fingers brushing his cheek. He leans into it, barely.

Neither of you says anything for a while.

Then softly, you say, ‚ÄúShe told me I was making the same mistakes she did.‚Äù

She‚Äôs never said it outright. But you feel it in every look and sigh. Warnings about wasting your life on music and guys in bands. Like she‚Äôs trying to save you from a fire she keeps walking into.

Jonathan hums, low. ‚ÄúYeah. Moms love that one.‚Äù

You shift in the hammock, look down at him. ‚ÄúAre you a mistake?‚Äù

He takes a breath like he‚Äôs chewing the question. Picks at a blade of grass. Doesn‚Äôt look up.

‚ÄúDepends who you ask.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm asking you.‚Äù

He shrugs. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to be.‚Äù

That sits between you for a minute. Warm. A little frayed.

Neither of you says anything for a while.

The sky overhead is a bruise that hasn‚Äôt settled yet.

You try to breathe, but everything‚Äôs too tight in your chest. Every good thing feels like a test you‚Äôre going to fail. You stare into the dark.

A voice uncoils in your head. Your mom‚Äôs, except it‚Äôs mutated. Half memory, half poison.

‚ÄúHe said you‚Äôre his girl, but is he gonna want to hang out constantly? Talk every day?‚Äù

You don‚Äôt know how to be with someone like that. Someone who wants you around. Someone who doesn‚Äôt flinch.

Inside, something starts gnawing again. That dull, slithering panic. You know the flavor. It‚Äôs the same thing she has. That quiet venom. The reflex to destroy anything gentle before it can hurt you first.

You feel it tightening, hands at your neck, squeezing.

‚ÄúWhat if you wreck it, just by being yourself?‚Äù

You look at your house.

‚ÄúI just can‚Äôt breathe in there sometimes,‚Äù you whisper. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to stay.‚Äù

Jonathan shakes his head. Picks a blade of grass, twirls it between his fingers. Doesn‚Äôt look at you when he says it.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt do that.‚Äù

You glance down.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt act like you‚Äôre too much.‚Äù

You breathe in. The sky is a mess of bruise and black.

No kiss. No dramatic music swell. Just two kids sitting in the dark with too much inside them.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go yet,‚Äù you mumble.

Just before it all fades completely, he whispers, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll stay ‚Äôtil you‚Äôre asleep.‚Äù

The ink drains from the sky. The sun is coming up. 

Your mom‚Äôs voice is cutting through the thick morning air.

‚ÄúStevie, get inside.‚Äù

You groan, eyes half-open, rubbing at your face.

‚ÄúI just needed-‚Äú

‚ÄúNeeded what? To sulk in the goddamn backyard all night?‚Äù she snaps. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt a damn summer camp.‚Äù

You drag yourself upright, body heavy with sleep and something meaner. You glance at the house. Same as it ever was.

Inside, the kitchen smells like burnt coffee. Pale light bleeding through the blinds. The fridge hums like it‚Äôs chewing on something. Your mom stands at the stove, stirring a pot of something grayish-beige. Still in the same t-shirt as yesterday. Hair in a low, tired knot.

You don‚Äôt slam the door, but don‚Äôt baby it either.

She glances up. Eyes pause on your face, on the raw, pink skin and glint of metal in your brow. Just for a second.

Then she turns back to the pot.

‚ÄúDid you sleep out there?‚Äù she asks. Flat, like she‚Äôs asking about the weather.

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

She hums. Not a yes, not a no. Just a noise to plug the gap.

You pull out a chair. Sit. The vinyl creaks like it doesn‚Äôt want you there either. You‚Äôre not hungry, but your stomach‚Äôs fighting itself.

She moves around the kitchen like always. Quiet, efficient, like she‚Äôs afraid noise might cause a collapse. You‚Äôve never seen her drop a dish.

But you‚Äôve seen her drop people.

She sets a bowl in front of you without looking. Oatmeal. Like she‚Äôs feeding you wallpaper paste and calling it care.

You glance at it. Then at her.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not gonna say anything?‚Äù

She finally looks at you, one eyebrow lifted.

‚ÄúAbout what?‚Äù

You gesture to your face.

She tilts her head.

‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre doing it for attention, don‚Äôt act surprised when people give you the wrong kind.‚Äù

You shut your eyes. She always finds a way to twist the knife.

‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt do it for anyone,‚Äù you mutter.

She shrugs. 

‚ÄúThen I don‚Äôt need to say anything.‚Äù

It lands like a slap made of air. Leaves no mark, but you still feel it in your teeth.

You can‚Äôt eat.

You just sit there while it cools. The fridge hums. The blinds throw jail bars across the counter.

1maafgp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1maafgp,Made a tool that finds better deals instantly when you shop online. Thoughts?,"Hey everyone,

Around a month ago, I built and launched a Chrome extension called¬†[Peel](http://shopwithpeel.com/). It automatically compares prices and finds better deals instantly as you shop across sites like Amazon, Walmart, Target, eBay, Best Buy and more.

It dawned on me that most shoppers overpay because they don't check to see where a product is cheaper.

The idea is simple:

‚Ä¢ It matches the product you‚Äôre viewing (using a bit of AI + product data to distinguish title inconsistencies)  
‚Ä¢ Then checks if it‚Äôs cheaper on other sites  
‚Ä¢ If it‚Äôs not the exact item, it suggests smarter alternatives that might save you more or options that would've been difficult to find otherwise manually

We‚Äôre a little over a month in, and here‚Äôs what we‚Äôve changed from feedback so far:

‚Ä¢ Added support for more stores  
‚Ä¢ Rolled out a referral + cashback system but only after someone makes a purchase to avoid spammy behavior  
‚Ä¢ Rebuilt the UI to make it cleaner, faster, and most importantly, non-intrusive unless a deal is found of value

And yes, of course Peel is 100% free to install and use. Feel free to ask questions or leave feedback! Thanks!

1maaded,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1maaded,"Paros Trip Report: Sun, scenery and style","Promised to leave a trip report for Paros and here it is. Me and partner stayed 3 nights in late-May, based in Naoussa on the north coast. Had a great time and highly recommended. Travelled on a budget but not a very stingy one. HMU if you have queries. 

  
DAY 1 - Arrived by ferry from Santorini to the main port of Parikia (aka Paros). After Santorini, we were Initially underwhelmed by Paros, mainly due to the truly foul weather. It was blowing a gale and was basically a dust storm so the sky was a miserable grey. Locals assured us it would clear -- and thank God it did by the next day.  

It's a 15-minute journey from Parikia to Naoussa. Hotels and transport companies will want 30 euros for the transfer. We decided to save some cash by just getting the public bus for like 2-3 euros each. It's super easy. The bus station is right next to the ferry terminal, the buses are big, clean and you can stick large suitcases underneath if you have them. Plenty of seats. Buses were running every 45 mins - 1 hour from memory. We had a bit of time to kill and were hungry so grabbed a very decent falafel at a cafe across the road from the terminal. 

Bus terminal in Naoussa is about a 5-7 minute walk from the waterfront where we'd booked an apartment at a guesthouse. 

ACTIVITY: Due to the bad weather, we didn't do a great deal of exploring and huddled in-doors mostly. Found a good supermarket (ŒöŒ°ŒóŒ§ŒôŒöŒüŒ£) to stock up on provisions. And a great bakery for coffee and pastries called Tserki in the middle of town. 

ACCOMMODATION: We stayed at the Daphne guesthouse, which was about 80 euros a night on [Booking.com](http://Booking.com) from memory. Think it's family-run. The room was small but had a lovely balcony overlooking the marina. There was a bigger room downstairs with a decent kitchen which we switched to for nights 2 and 3. Owner was super-chill, didn't even charge us extra. 

DAY 2 - The weather cleared and Naoussa was transformed. It just takes a bit of sun and the place looks magical. We did a proper walk around town, checked out the ruins of the Venetian castle on the waterfront and all the bars and restaurants. The ones on the water are naturally expensive but a block further in-land and they're way cheaper. We also checked out Piperi Beach -- which is the most convenient town beach. Without being amazing, it's a decent option for a swim if you can't be bothered going further. 

We took a public bus back to Parikia to take a look around. It's a similar vibe to Naoussa but feels a bit less touristy. Also some great little shops and no shortage of restaurants etc.

We jumped on another bus down to Pounta to get the ferry over to the neighbouring island of Antiparos. The crossing is quick, takes 10 or so minutes and a handful of euros each. The town where the ferry terminal is located is very chilled out and very pleasant. Feels more ""Greek"". Old guys playing cards and drinking wine. The town has a decent selection of cafes and shops but much sleepier than Paros. There's a castle in the centre of town which was sadly closed for renovations when we were there. We walked about 10 minutes to the beach on the west side of the island. It's quite lovely. And deserted. I swam at the beach back in town as the sun went down while partner chilled a cafe. Very calm. Water a little chilly because it was late-May but being from Melbourne, Australia, am used to it! Went back to Parikia and found loads of the locals doing folk-dancing in the town square after dark. Very cool. 

DAY 3 - We decided to do a bit more exploring of the island so we hired a car for about 40 euros up the road from our guesthouse. All super easy. About 15 minutes north of Naoussa there's a lovely little bay with Monastiri Beach and a beach club, restaurant and bar. No parking fees or anything. The water is gorgeous. You can hire sun loungers etc but it's OK to just take a free swim. I did just that. We checked out the local monastery. Really lovely views. Could easily while away a whole afternoon or two there but we wanted to explore so we kept going. Back towards town is Kolympethres Beach. Also good for a free swim but Monastiri slightly better IMHO. We hugged the east coast of the island, heading south and you'll find quaint little coastal towns where the only tourists seem to be Greek. Some have views of Naxos across the strait. Again, would happily have lingered at these places for whole afternoons but just didn't have enough time. Lefkes, a town in a valley in the interior was recommended to us. Glad we made the drive. It was a fantastic place with labyrinthine streets to get lost in and a beautiful cathedral in the centre. A cracking ice cream shop there, too. 

Returning to base, we went out to Yemeni Wine Restaurant in Naoussa. A slightly posh vibe but not stuffy or pretentious. Great food. About 80 euros for two with a glass of wine each. A perfect place to cap off Paros. 

NOTES: 

1. I can't speak for high season in July-August but we found May to be a delight. Apart from the windy day one, it was all sun and blue skies, about 25-28C. People wanting warm sea-water will be disappointed, though. 

2. Paros markedly cheaper than Santorini. Found local prices pretty reasonable -- even in touristy Naoussa. Out of Naoussa, there are bargains. 

3. It was buzzy in Naoussa but never felt overwhelmingly touristy. Good mix of families, young and old. Would happily return to Paros but really want to explore other parts of Greece, too.

I‚Äôve recently decided to upgrade from a Keurig coffee machine for my wife and I. I‚Äôve done a bunch of research on how to dial in. I‚Äôve got a pretty good idea on when to increase and decrease brew temp and grind size. I have medium fresh roasted beans (10 days) and I plan to buy some dark roast online as I can‚Äôt find any locally that are fresh dark roast, because I understand this machine struggles below dark roast. I‚Äôm using everything that came with the machine, and no external scales or anything (I do have a puck screen on the way). All of my shots are coming out sour and bitter. I‚Äôm thinking the machine can‚Äôt get hot enough for these beans and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm ordering some online. I‚Äôd like to be able to drink a black shot, but none of the shots I pull are very good alone, but they‚Äôre still way better with some milk than anything from the Kuerig. 

I think part of the issue in dialing in is that I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôve ever had a great/perfect shot as a baseline to dial into as far as bitterness/sourness are concerned. So I‚Äôm not too sure what to do about that other than going to a local shop and trying their espresso and hoping it‚Äôs a good baseline. Another part I think is the medium roast I‚Äôm using since it‚Äôs the only fresh beans I could find so hopefully fresh dark roast online helps. And then lastly, I fear I may outgrow this machine as I tend to get very into things like this as a hobby. For example, when I bought my first home I became obsessed with lawn care. I think the same is happening here and I want to make sure I don‚Äôt go crazy but I also want to consider that maybe this machine isn‚Äôt a great fit if I want more flexibility in roasts. Can other machines pull good shots with store bought non fresh beans? If so, maybe I‚Äôd prefer that flexibility as a convenience over the process convenience of the luxe cafe. 

I guess I‚Äôm looking for guidance, maybe a chat with someone that has experience, a bit of a mentor maybe to help guide me in getting experience and helping me determine some decisions or how to quickly move forward with understanding if this is the right machine for me and my wife (3-4 drinks a day, nothing past 2pm) or if there‚Äôs a better investment we should make

I was using Supabase to handle signups, which includes storage, auth, and database ‚Äî but it turns out Supabase has a limit of 2 email verifications per hour. So only two people every hour could sign up and actually verify their account. The post ended up getting 200,000 impressions, and I have no idea how many signups I lost because of that. I eventually had to switch to a different email provider to handle confirmations ‚Äî but only after my second post.

Also... I got permanently banned from that subreddit üòÖ

In the early days, cold emailing users for feedback really helped shape the tool. I‚Äôve since added Microsoft Clarity to better understand how users interact with it, which has helped me iterate quickly.

Fast forward to today: I have nearly 1,300 registered users. The tool is completely free to use. I haven‚Äôt figured out monetization yet ‚Äî but I‚Äôve made about $7 from two people buying me a coffee, so that‚Äôs a start!

It all began with Costco, but now you can use the tool to track price drops on any website.

Right now, I‚Äôm diving into SEO to help grow traffic further.

Hope this post helps anyone starting out with their own side project!

I knew from the start that i was probably going to exploited being a temporary resident but didn't know that some employers could be so cheap and unethical. I couldnt find any work for 2 months when I arrived in Australia and was super desperate, one of my friend from uni referred me to this convenience store, I showed up to the store and they said they will pay 16 an hour (the minimum wage in aus is 24-25) and being desperate I said yes. The starting period wasnt so bad, i just sat around and served the few customers coffee/ just scanned the items. I had the evening shift and during the day the shop owners served at the store and my closing duties included refilling drinks, mopping, the usual stuff. After like 1.5 months of never coming late, doing the work perfectly and even out performing I asked them to give me a raise but they started making excuses. I kept working on and even developed a system to print the price tickets which earlier were handwritten, still no appreciation or raise, increased the sales by using some psychology tricks and stuff. Overtime I noticed, whenever I had days off for my uni, no one would do the closing duties correctly, i.e they didnt even restock the drinks or mop. Whenever i came back from days off, i had to restock the whole store. The owners open the store at 6 am and stay till 4 pm, thats when i take over, they would not do anything for the whole morning shift and when i arrived would ask me to go and unload 4 trollies worth of new stock and then restock the whole store, mind you that i had only 5 hours to restock the shelves, fridge, serve coffee, closing, cleaning everything. They pay me according the minimum wage into my account but then ask me to give me back 300 dolllars in cash so they practically just still pay me 16. Last week, they told me to put all the 1000 or so items in the store on doordash and to do it fast, while they did nothing and also asked me to change every single handwritten ticket to printed ones.

1maa6n1,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1maa6n1/ghosted/,Ghosted,"My name is Edward Foster. I'm a psychiatrist. I see patients, and I determine their ailments. I‚Äôm 38. I live alone, and I drink heavily. The demons in my head are making it difficult to type this out. This is very important, so listen up.



I have to tell you about my patient. My patient James. You see a lot of unfortunate cases of extremely unwell patients in this profession. Complete Norman Bates f\*cking psychos. Most of the time I'm booked up. The same people every week. Some of them I might not think were sick, but who else would come to my office every Wednesday and talk about every insecurity they have for 4 years straight. Sorry Janice.¬†



My schedule freed up when one of my patients died. I don‚Äôt beat myself up over it. Anyone in the profession will tell you it happens. I saw potential for Clark, but he couldn‚Äôt see it himself. Anyway, I had an opening.



James was different. He wasn‚Äôt obviously insane, and he wasn‚Äôt someone who just wanted to vent either. He was one that seemed normal. Normal to anyone who hit him up for chit chat, but it was when you had a long conversation with him. A long conversation revealed he was definitely unwell and probably a flight risk. He was just extremely good at masking it.¬†



So I sat down with him every Monday, and tried to figure him out. After multiple sessions he began to open up. He told me about his obsessions with the occult, demonology, alternate dimensions.



‚ÄúLots of people are fascinated with the occult doc. Lots of people. It doesn‚Äôt make me bad or evil. I'm just curious. Really curious, that's all. I can‚Äôt stop reading about it. I just- well Dr. Foster you should really check out the book I'm reading. By Crowley. It‚Äôs really something doc. Not dull stuff.‚Äù



I was curious what he wanted out of these sessions. No one was forcing him to see me. He came voluntarily. I thought maybe he was aware his mind was slipping.



And then I didn‚Äôt see James for months. He vanished, just like that. I didn‚Äôt think about it much. I went onward.¬†



Then one day I came home from work in the afternoon, and poured myself a scotch. My place is really clean, so I noticed the paper sitting on my counter. I sipped my scotch and read.



‚ÄúHey Dr. Foster, it‚Äôs me James. Please listen. Please listen to what I have to say. Below I have written 6 steps. Please follow the steps. I know it seems silly, but I will explain everything after. -your friend James‚Äù



These were the following steps.



‚ÄúStep 1: Go to the bathroom

Step 2: Close the door

Step 3: Turn on running water (sink, bathtub, or showerhead)

Step 4: Turn out the lights

Step 5: Get on your knees

Step 6: Say these ancient words

It was unsettling, to know James had broken into my house. He didn‚Äôt take anything. Just left a stupid note. So I called the police. They searched the home, and didn‚Äôt find him. So they put a warrant out for his arrest, and that was it. I knew James was batsh\*t, bananas, a certified silly goose who belonged in a straightjacket.¬†



I was extremely cautious to lock every possible entrance to my house the following days. But the notes kept showing up. I called the police a couple more times, but there was nothing they could do. I had the option to stay somewhere else, but I wasn‚Äôt going to let James drive me out of my house. It would be too much of a pain to move, and I‚Äôve never seen him be violent. I figured I'd catch him, and talk some sense into him.



The creepiest part about all this is that there were no signs of entry anywhere. Every time I came home the doors and windows were still closed and locked.¬†



The notes after the first go as follows:



1. ‚ÄúFoster this is not a joke. I told you what you have to do. I won‚Äôt cause you any trouble. Just do this one thing for me. -James‚Äù



‚ÄúStep 1: Go to the bathroom

Step 2: Close the door

Step 3: Turn on running water (sink, bathtub, or showerhead)

Step 4: Turn out the lights

Step 5: Get on your knees

Step 6: Say these ancient words

1. ‚ÄúYou're going to regret this Foster.‚Äù



The last one chilled me to the bone, because of how I found it. I didn‚Äôt find it after coming home from work like the others. I was watching television on the couch with my feet on the coffee table. I got up to use the bathroom. When I came back it was there. On the coffee table. I knew immediately he was near. I called out to him. ‚ÄúJames come out here. Let‚Äôs talk about this.‚Äù Silence. ‚ÄúJames?‚Äù¬†



Then it began. A book flew off my shelf at Mach speed, missing my head by a foot. Then my ceiling fan swung back and forth and fell.¬† An entity I couldn‚Äôt see was trashing my room. Papers flew about, chairs hurled at me, and my belongings smashed. Then everything stopped, for a moment. Then my old wooden baseball bat floated towards me and swung into my kneecap, my ribs, and my family jewels.¬†



As I laid on the floor groaning in pain, another note was written. It was crumbled up and thrown at my face.



‚ÄúI will f\*ck you up Edward. I will follow you. I will beat you. I will breathe on your face when you're in bed. I will do everything I can to make your life as painful, miserable, and uncomfortable as possible.‚Äù



‚ÄúStep 1: Go to the bathroom

Step 2: Close the door

Step 3: Turn on running water (sink, bathtub, showerhead)

Step 4: Turn out the lights

Step 5: Get on your knees

Step 6: Say these ancient words

I folded immediately. I don‚Äôt like being hit with baseball bats, and I'm not fond of ghosts either. So I went to the bathroom to appease James. I closed the door, turned on my shower, and cut the lights. I got on my knees and forgot the words. I turned the light on, said the words over and over. Then I tried again. I turned the lights out and spoke the words best I could. ‚ÄúTsacy eht gnip eer c pu siohw.‚Äù¬†



My body was lifted off the ground. I heard voices, whispers. They weren‚Äôt in any language I knew. My best guess is middle eastern. Some sort of Hebrew or Arabic maybe? I did my best to move toward the light switch. I cut the lights on and what do ya know? My body was gone. Completely invisible. I had to feel around for the doorknob. It was difficult to even know where my hand was. The voices quieted down.



I opened the bathroom door and saw James. In the flesh James. He said your name. Yes, your name. You reading this. I can‚Äôt post your actual name or info here, because of some demon curses and website rules and regulations and stuff. It isn't important. What is important is I‚Äôm coming for you.



I've spent the last few days hearing voices, presumably demons giving me all kinds of information. For some reason they wouldn‚Äôt give me your phone number or anything. They told me you go on this website often though, and I could reach you by posting here. They also told me ‚ÄúRelease and be released.‚Äù I released James. That's what the demons call it anyway.



You see, when you release someone they get to choose the next victim. Someone released the first ghost, and the first ghost gave that person James‚Äô name. James released the second ghost. It gave James my name. Then I released James, and he gave me your name.¬†



I‚Äôm not sure who gave James my name. Who had it out for me? Is it a coincidence that James knew me before he and I were picked to become ghosts? I don‚Äôt know, but when you release me I will find and kill whoever involved me in this. Being a ghost f\*cking sucks. I can‚Äôt get the voices out of my head. People are terrified when I move any object. That was funny at first, but I'm tired of the screams now. I just want quiet.



Please listen to me. Don‚Äôt make it harder than it has to be. We can streamline this, and no one has to suffer for too long. You follow the steps, and then make the next one follow the steps.¬†



I'm on my way to your house. You have about a day. Why did James have to pick someone halfway across the states? I'm not sure why James picked you. Maybe you two have beef, or maybe he saw your name flipping through a newspaper in my house. Either way, the sooner you follow those steps, the sooner you can be released and kill him.¬†



Everything is explained to you now. There is nothing left, but for you to do what must be done. If you don‚Äôt I will torment you or make ghost love to your girlfriend or something. So do us both a favor and get it over with. In case you're too lazy to scroll up, here they are again.
