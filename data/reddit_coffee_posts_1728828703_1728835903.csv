1g2t3bf,https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/1g2t3bf/in_remission_and_i_dont_take_any_oral_medication/,In remission and I don't take any oral medication - my experience,"I have a milder case of UC and have been very lucky to be able to go off oral medication. Early on, my doctor and I realized I had an intolerance to mesalazine, and I decided not to take any immuno-suppresants. My initial treatment with prednisone was successful for a bit, but the side effects were not something I wanted to deal with for the rest of my life.

My labs just came back and calprotectin levels are below 200 and I feel great. I have normal, regular, healthy stools. I'm seeing both a regular GI who has prescribed steroid enemas for when I feel inflammation, as well as a functional medicine practitioner that prescribed me a set of supplements and lifestyle changes to eliminate all potential triggers to the disease. The functional clinic also prescribed a comprehensive gut microbiome test that shed some light on what was happening on a bacterial level. They were able to then adjust the supplements to my specific case. With the help of both of these practitioners, and the supplements I'm taking, I was able to decrease my calprotectin levels from 1200+ to the current levels within a few months.

Everyone's case is different, but this is what helped me I'm on a gluten-free, dairy-free diet. I don't drink any alcohol or coffee and exercise 2-3 times a week. Coffee was always a trigger for my IBS, so I knew I had to quit when I got diagnosed. It's not the case for a lot of people.

I avoid anything that I'm allergic to and might trigger an immune response (I had to take a comprehensive allergy test).

I take oil-based vitamin D, multivitamins, longvida curcumin, iron, and omega-3 every day. I also take the supplements that the functional clinic prescribed, which might be different for each specific case. I consume about 100g of protein daily to ensure my colon has enough to heal itself in case of inflammation. I also try to stay well-fed because I spent most of my 20s severely malnourished, which I think contributed to the development of my UC.

I also realized there was a huge emotional trigger to my disease, and had to get serious about meditation, journaling, yoga, and doing lots of inner-healing work. This is still ongoing, but I think has contributed to me developing healthier ways to navigate life and regulate my body. I recommend folks read The Body Keeps The Score. I've had a life filled with trauma and stress and this book has shed some light into how that might have affected my health.

Whenever I get sick, or get stressed for any reason, my colon inflammation tends to increase. I'll start noticing a lack of energy and some mucus and blood in my stool. This is my ""all hands on deck"" moment. I usually reach out to the GI for labs, and start taking the steroid enemas, as well as doing anything I possibly can to decrease stress and be gentle with myself. I'll adjust my calendar and processes to make sure I'm moving slower and listening to my body. Inflammation then goes away after a couple of days. My GI has been extremely supportive throughout this process and I'm happy to have found someone who doesn't try to force me into any medication, but wants to work within my boundaries. She is actually an IBD specialist in the UK, and has had a lot of experience with this. I get regularly checked and stay proactive over my health. It's a lot more work than just taking one pill every morning but I'm okay with that.  I'm not opposed to the use of oral medication if things ever get serious, but so far, this is really working for me.

I'm by no means telling folks to go off their meds. Everyone's case is different, and you should consult your GI before taking any measures. I consider myself very lucky because I know a lot of people can't do the same. But I wanted to share here what has helped me.",1,1728835707.0,UlcerativeColitis,0,1.0,False
1g2t2jh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g2t2jh,One Character from Each Episode in Series 1,"As the title implies, I’ll be choosing one character from each episode from Series 1 of the Modern Era of the show. This will be part 1 of my mission to pick one character from every episode in the modern era, but without choosing a character more than once.

I was originally going to do this for the entire modern era so far, but then that would’ve taken a really long time.

Before you proceed, there are some points I have to make...

• For this part and future Series’ parts, I’m not including any of the villains, yet I would still occasionally include characters who are not really evil but have done something bad, or even characters with a jerky attitude.

• Each character is fitted with a quote, but their quote is said by them in the episode that they are representing and not their entire tenure.

• Please don’t take this seriously, as a bunch of the following points are used for comedy purposes.

Anyway, let's proceed...

1) The Ninth Doctor

First Seen: Grabbing Rose’s hand and telling her to run from the plastic men (because Autons aren’t mentioned by name in the episode).

Last Seen: Regenerating into Ten after kissing Ro-THAT WAS A GENETIC TRANSFER.

Fun Fact: He’s the only character who knows Mickey’s real name, which is Ricky, and that’s something not even Mickey himself knows.

“That won’t work, he’s gay and she’s an alien.”
--------

2) Rose Tyler

First Seen: Waking up like an ordinary person.

Last Seen: Meeting a drunken man on New Year’s Day in 2005, who tells her that’s she going to have a really great year.

Fun Fact: According to Jack, she has an excellent bottom.

“Hello. My name’s Rose. That’s a sort of plant. We might be related. I’m talking to a twig.”
--------

3) Charles Dickens

First Seen: Feeling old, while waiting for his stage call, and feels like he’s seen it all.

Last Seen: On BBC Breakfast, where he’s interviewed about his new Christmas Special, A Christmas Carol.

Fun Fact: Until Nine told him otherwise, he was lead to believe that nobody called him Charlie.

“What the Shakespeare’s going on?”
--------

4) Mickey Smith

First Seen: Having lunch with Rose, while having fun with her.

Last Seen: Hugging Martha, which is just what she needed after their encounter with a Sontaran and Ten.

Fun Fact: Before K9 reminded him, he didn’t realise he was in a car.

“I think I know my own name.”
--------

5) Harriet Jones

First Seen: Giving someone coffee, as an attempt to meet the Prime Minister, but he sees through her cunning plan.

Last Seen: Facing extermination with dignity, after gaining proof that the Daleks know who she is.

Fun Fact: Throughout her life, she made it her job to make sure everyone knew who she was, but they all knew anyway.

“You’re a very violent young woman.”
--------

6) Adam Mitchell

First Seen: Being a witness to Van Statten firing someone for having an opinion.

Last Seen: Failing to live a quiet life, since his mum snapped her fingers and opened his head.

Fun Fact: He was kicked out of the TARDIS for breaking rules, even though the Doctor was ‘in charge’.

“Great big alien death machine defeated by a flight of stairs.”
--------

7) Cathica Santini Khandeni

First Seen: Along with Suki, as they both meet a test who’s asking them a lot of obvious questions.

Last Seen: Discussing with Nine on what’s to come about of Satellite 5’s future after Max had been destroyed.

Fun Fact: Despite the fact that she’s a major part of the ‘spiking’ people, the Editor apparently doesn’t recognise her and considers her ‘no one’.

“Oh no, you don’t. You should have promoted me years back.”
--------

8) Pete Tyler

First Seen: Getting married to Jackie, where his daughter and her time traveling friend are present.

Last Seen: Dying on a road with a blond girl by his side.

Fun Fact: He was shorter than Rose thought he would be, and that’s not the only thing about him that surprised her.

“No, love. I’m your dad. It’s my job for it to be my fault.”
--------

9) Jack Harkness

First Seen: Using his binoculars to check through the night sky during the Blitz, and soon catches sight of Rose.

Last Seen: After helping Thirteen and her gang to sort out both Dalek armies, he chickens out from staying with her any longer but still leaves her with a recorded message.

Fun Fact: On two occasions, he informs Nine that he’ll see him in Hell. He never once said this to Ten or even Thirteen, so ‘Hell’ could either refer to Ten, Thirteen or his inability to die.

“Sorry, old man. I’ve got to go meet a girl. But you’ve got an excellent bottom too.”
--------

10) Nancy

First Seen: Appearing out of nowhere, as she warns Nine not to answer his TARDIS phone.

Last Seen: Answering the question that all the gas mask zombies have been asking by confirming that she’s Jamie’s mother.

Fun Fact: She tells Nine (the Doctor) that he should find the Doctor, which confuses him briefly.

“You think so, Ernie? Then answer this. Jim is sitting there right next to you. So who’s typing?”
--------

11) Idris Hopper

First Seen: Asking Nine if he’s going to book an appointment to see the Mayor.

Last Seen: Trying to stop Nine from seeing the Mayor.

Fun Fact: He’s polite to everyone he’s with, yet he apparently is over protective of the Mayor, which could hint that he’s a Slitheen too.

“The Lord Mayor says thank you for popping by. She’d love to have a chat, but, er, she’s up to her eyes in paperwork. Perhaps if you could make an appointment for next week?”
--------

12) Rodrick

First Seen: Guiding a confused Rose to her podium on the Deadly Weakest Link.

Last Seen: Getting exterminated by the Daleks due to his selfish attitude.

Fun Fact: During his life, he never found out what actually happened to all the eliminated contestants on the Deadly Weakest Link (including Rose).

“Right, that’s the end of tactical voting. You’re on your own now.”
--------

13) Lynda Moss

First Seen: Being Nine’s support when he’s transmatted onto the Killer Big Brother House.

Last Seen: Thanks to a Dalek exterminating the glass, she got killed by open space.

Fun Fact: After being accepted to join Nine in the TARDIS, she says that she wouldn’t get in the way, but he wouldn’t even mind if she did get in the way. Rose, however, would mind about that happening. As for Jack, well...we should already know what he would think.

“The Fleet’s descending. They’re bombing whole continents. Europa, Pacifica, the New American Alliance. Australasia’s just gone.”

1g2sxo4,https://www.reddit.com/r/fixingmovies/comments/1g2sxo4/my_two_ideas_to_fix_joker_folie_a_deux/,My two ideas to fix Joker: Folie A Deux.,"First of all, I would not have it be a Musical, because that was just a stupid idea right from the get-go, and should not have been done (or at least the way it was handled), and secondly, I have two ideas for what I would've done differently with the Story/Plot.

1. Do something similar to what Youtuber Channel Pup pitch back when the sequel was first announced all the way back in 2019 (or was it 2020, I can't remember), where it's told almost entirely from the POV of Harleen Quinzel (played by Anya Taylor-Joy), who's still a Doctor at Arkham in this timeline, and is interviewing Joker, where Arthur basically reenters his Arthur persona to twist and manipulating Harley into making her think he was the victim, and we see Harleen's life outside of the Asylum begin to change for the worst because of this manipulation, in the end, she helps him escape Arkham, and are about to jump off the building together, but as Harley jumps off, Arthur/Joker doesn't basically exposing that he was manipulating Harley this whole time, and never actually loved her, and just saw her as a means to an end. Harley survives the fall, but in the end, she is taken to Arkham, and we get a parallel to the last shots of Joker 2019, with Harley in Arkham this time around.
2. If we have to go with the idea of Arthur not being the real Joker, but inspiring the real one, then I would've had it that Arthur turns someone into the Real Joker. Basically, this one would involve Dr. Jack Napier (played by Tom Holland). A Doctor at Arkham who believes Arthur is the way he is because he has split personality disorder, caused by the corrupt and ""Fascist"" Horrors of Gotham and the modern world, and genuinely wants to help Arthur (he's basically the Doctor from Dark Knight Returns), with Jack wanting to prove that Arthur is innocent. The film would be about Jack connecting with Arthur, and the two becoming has friends, as Arthur has seemingly re-entered the Arthur Fleck persona, proving Jack right, but it's made clear, Arthur/Joker is only pretending to still be Arthur, and pretending to have a split personality, to manipulate Jack and get his way. We see Jack's life outside of Arkham, and see him with his pregnant wife (played by Anya Taylor-Joy), and him trying to do stand-up comedy on the side. While meanwhile, we see Arthur/Joker in Arkham, making friends with the guards, getting favors from the other patients, and falling in love with Marion Drews (played by lady Gaga), there romance playing out mostly similar, except, Arthur/Joker fully knows she's just using him, while Marion story about her deadbeat father and mother is actually true in this version. In the end, the court trial plays out mostly similar, and even has the same ending speech, of Arthur admitting there is no split personality. But it takes a dark turn, when Arthur admits he is glad he did what he did, and he became Joker because of society, and how the world didn't even know he existed, but now the people see the truth, and he's going to blow it all to the ground. He then breaks a coffee mug and cuts a smile into Jack's cheek, as Jack is taken away, Arthur sets off a bomb, killing him and everyone inside, including Marion. Harvey, but half his face is mangle. Jack is taken by Joker supporters, but escapes, while the Guards let all the patients out of Arkham and burn it to the ground. Jack returns home, only to find his pregnant wife dead, he makes his way to the famous stairs, he has one last vision of Arthur in a White suit, climbing the steps to Heaven with Murray and Imaginary Sophie. Jack kneels down, as the police surround him, recreating the classic panel from the Killing Joke as he laughs, hysterically. The last shot of the movie is Jack in the newly rebuild Arkham, paralleling the ending of the first film, the doctor interviewing him (played by Zendaya) named ""Harleen Quinzel"" and the music this time being ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road"" as the movie ends.",1,1728835298.0,fixingmovies,0,0.67,False

1g2swip,https://www.reddit.com/r/shittydarksouls/comments/1g2swip/i_want_to_take_care_of_rennala/,I want to take care of Rennala,"Miyazaki, why? Why would you create this character, to spite me? The lust that perpetuates throughout my entire body for Rennala has ascended my own mortal understandings. I do not want her feet, her statuesque body, nor the perfectly molded lips she bears that could make even the gods shiver. I simply want to take care of this woman, to help her forget the trauma that the fraud Radagon had induced onto her, and show her true love.

I just imagine, meeting her and being good friends. Over time, her shell would start to crack, and she would start seeing me as more than just a friend. Starting to flirt, and taking her out to dinner. We'd talk and talk to each other and even joke about Radagon as we enjoyed the night with wine and steaks of Marika. I'll show her all the things that Radagon didn't, and I'll show her the RESPECT that she deserves. Eventually, we would get engaged after a few months of our relationship (her loyalty is instant keeper material) and have a large party at the academy. At the academy I'll meet Ranni, my future step-daughter and do my best to make a good first impression. She would be suspicious of me then and ridicule me along with her subordinates. She'd get told off of course, by Rennala and slink away to her tower for who knows what. After that Rennala would tell me to leave it alone, and to not bother with Ranni, but I'd refuse and instead gain the courage to be a good father along with being a good husband. Over the years of Renalla and I's engagement I'd take it upon myself to prove to Ranni that I hold no malice in my pursuit to love Renalla. She'd deny it at first, but after a good fishing trip in Liurnia and some sightseeing along the limgrave. Ranni would approve of my candidacy and along with that our marriage.

With large horns and Bells that signify the start of a dynasty, I walk towards the large podium and steady my feet next to Miriel. After that would I witness the greatest sight I could ever lay my eyes upon. Strutting to the podium as well, adorned with the most beautiful dress, Rennala stands infront of me. Looking down at both me and Miriel, the pastor begins to recite his vows.

""The ceremony of marriage in which you come to be united is one of the first and oldest ceremonies in the entire world, celebrated in the beginning in the presence of God himself. Marriage is a gift in that we give ourselves totally to one another. I believe that marriage is a gift given to comfort the sorrows of life and to magnify life’s joys.""

""Marriage is the clasping of hands, the blending of two hearts, the union of two lives into one, and your marriage must stand, not by the authority of the State, nor by the seal on your wedding certificate, but by the strength and power of the faith and love you have in one another.""

""Do you, Binga swear to take Rennala to be your wife, to have and to hold from this day forward, for better or for worse, for richer or for poorer, in sickness and in health, promise to love and cherish her?.""

""I do""

""Do you, Rennala swear to take Binga to be your husband, to have and to hold from this day forward, for better or for worse, for richer or for poorer, in sickness and in health, promise to love and cherish him?.""

With crystal tears streaming down her red face she manages to utter the words;

""I do""

""I declare that you are now lawfully married, you are husband and wife, you may now kiss the bride""

As I pull up her veil, I see her entrancing eyes be fully revealed to me, and I am awestruck by the situation that is unfolding. Me? With the most beautiful woman in the world as my bride, in a wedding full of thousands of celebrants? I couldn't imagine this years ago, and my eyes swell with water as I lean into the now crouched Rennala looking deep into my soul. 

My hands seem like a baby's on her face as I lay them on her. The world seems to go blank as my face approaches hers. I close my eyes.

The crowd erupts in cheers and celebration, and bells the size of gongs ring out across the entirety of Liurnia. I open my eyes and see her smile, radiating, beaming through all the noise.

""I love you""

The welled up tears in my eyes burst out and onto my face as I embrace her.

""Let us get ready for the party dear."" 

I collect myself and walk away from the podium and into the Carian Academy where a personal party awaited us, along with Ranni and her subordinates. I look at my daughter, whos solid face looks to somehow be tearing up. Rennala and I make it to the ball and celebrate the afternoon talking with guests and friends until a large glass could be heard reverberating across the room. Standing up, Ranni announced to the whole party.

""I hereby declare myself as Queen of the Carian Royal Family""

I was stunned by this but as I looked over to Rennala She was unfazed. It seems that our Rennala and I's life would go more smoothly than I thought.

After our marriage, we'd go off to a small town, away from all the drama, and spend our days there. I fantasize about building a house with her, a great big but humble home. I'd have to get the correct measurements for her huge body on the door frames. As we build our rooms we'll have one for the child we're planning on having, as I set up the cradle and such she'll paint on the ceiling and set up the floating baby toys. We'll have two different toilets, our couch would be extra extra large, and we'd have a Queen Marika-sized bed to cuddle in. On weekdays she'll come back home from work, and putting her coat on a special hanger will be welcomed by the dinner I made. She'll have her own chair and utensils to be comfortable with, and although I can see her eyebags at this point she still continues to tell me about her job and her asshole co-workers. I'll comfort her, hugging her and making some coffee. After dinner, we'll watch some shows in bed where we'll be talking constantly and remarking on the episodes. When we start getting sleepy, and Rennala starts to doze off. I'll turn off the TV, and we'll spoon (im the small spoon of course) while encased in the titan-sized blanket we share and end the night.

On weekends we'll go out for a bit, maybe to a nearby mall or just walk around town seeking adventure. During these times Rennala usually talks about her past experiences such as her battles and about the flunk Radagon. We'll go on rants with each other, and share the different interests we have. The place we usually go to for lunch is some old mom-and-pop shop that's underrated in our hometown, but sometimes on the days where we walk around town we'll instead try all the different stands and stalls that have recently popped up (it's a monthly kind of tradition). When the sun sets we head back home, I'll cook up some dinner or eat the leftovers we have and we'll snack on some popcorn. Usually on weekends I sleep first, as Rennala stays up to catch up on some books idk she calls them ""yaoi "" or something? I love this woman from the bottom of my heart and the life we've been living together has frankly been the dream.

1g2swb0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1g2swb0/aita_party_food/,AITA: Party Food,"We're about to host a Halloween party. It is small child focused, so I make all the food finger foods that are minimally messy, but also filling. I also make a kit 90% of them vegan and soy free to accommodate several friends/friends' kids that either have severe food allergies, are vegetarian, are vegan, or a combination of the above. 

I should also mention I make 99% of the food in our house and do 99% of the grocery shopping as I work from home and have the flexible schedule at this point. 

One thing I made last year for a different fall get together that went over well weree mushroom & brown gravy filled bites. It's relatively easy bc I use prepackaged croissant dough and then just put squares of that in minimuffin tins with like a little filling. Kids loved them, though I'm not sure how many realized it was mushrooms. 

I'm in the process of making the filling. Admittedly it looks like slightly textured brown mush with little pieces of red bell peppers in it, but it's going to be a dot on a croissant thingy, so it's whatever. I'm doing this while be the primary caregiver for the kids, working on getting the house presentable for the party, dealing with the politics of a new job, and dealing with back to back illnesses from pre-k child. 

My spouse just came up from working in the basement and started playing with baby, yay! Before he came up I was interacting with baby, making the filling, doing dishes, and getting the coffee started. Then I say, I'm working on making these bites for the party ahead of time so I can freeze them and just pop them in the oven the day of instead of having to make them when I'll be busy. 

He: 

1. Looked at the pan on stove and said, ""That isn't what you're making for the party, right?""

2. Replied to my explanation of how it goes into the croissant bites and is just a filling with ,""mmm hmmm..."" (Not a quiet mmm but a two-syllable mmm hmmm, with his eyes widened like he was saying, suuuuuure)

3. When I told him the kids liked it last year, said, ""you do you,"" again, with widened eyes. 

I said, ""That's not okay."" He wanted to know why and I said what he just said was mean. (Maybe I should have said dismissive? Or invalidating? Not sure, maybe mean was too strong?). 

He insisted that he said you do you, which means coll do whatever, and nothing he said or insinuated was negative.

I'm currently feeling some type of way about this and had to go take a break. I did get upset and a little disregulated (no screaming, cussing, name calling or anything, just said things like, ""this is not okay; you can't just criticize someone/be negative about something someone's working hard on, I'm done right now..."" etc. in a raised, frustrated voice... And yes, I expect people to be able to understand the difference between a somewhat raised voice and screaming. I grew up with screaming, when my husband and I were younger we could lose our tempers and scream sometimes and this was not that, though my tone/volume wasn't modulated well and I don't like getting upset like that with the baby in the room.)

Who's the asshole here. I think it's clear, but I know he's going to blame it on me missing a week of meds about 5 days ago now or on my new job, and maintain he did nothing wrong. 

(I was also up with the baby, who's sick, last night and only got about 3 hours of sleep, bc I'm the one that does the night wake ups bc he has some kind of insomnia and has trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, and getting back to sleep once he's woken up. I did get a 1 hour or so nap this morning while he took the baby for a walk). ",1,1728835206.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False

Today I went on a solo trip to sup at a nearby lake. I went to the caffe next to the lake to find a place where I could go onto the water. I was in sporty clothes and looked rather lost. There I saw him having coffee with a girl. We didn't make eye contact because I left to find a new place to get onto the water. I'm pretty sure he saw me since he was sitting in my direction. Anyway I found a place to get into the water, at that point I was far away from him to see me but as I was on the water with my sup l'm sure he saw me again. My question is; what do you think he was thinking, that I looked lonely going out on my own? Or was he thinking good for her for being active and independent?

Hey fellow adventurers! Derek here, aka u/solopassions, and today I want to dive into the exhilarating world of solo travel. You know, that magical realm where you are the master of your own itinerary, the captain of your adventures, and the sole commander of your travel playlist (unless you have questionable taste in music, then Godspeed!).

### Unleashing the Inner Maverick

Solo travel is like that perfect cup of coffee you discover in a tucked-away café – unexpected, thrilling, and possibly life-changing. My initial trepidations about venturing alone melted away as soon as I realized the unparalleled freedom it offers. Imagine waking up any time you please, changing your plans on a whim, or indulging in an entire pizza without fearing judgmental looks.

### A Dance with Uncertainty

Let’s be real – solo travel comes with its own quirks. Who knew trying to take a selfie with a picturesque backdrop could double as an acrobatics routine? Or that conversing with yourself in public could be misconstrued as a cry for help (FYI, it's self-motivation)? 😅 But it’s precisely these challenges that make the journey a tapestry of unforgettable stories.

### The Soulful Twist

Embarking on a solo trip offers more than just Instagram-worthy moments. It reshapes you, adds layers to your understanding of the world, and ultimately, yourself. I discovered my knack for navigating foreign transport systems, honed with each missed bus and impromptu (meaning ""lost"") walking tour. My personal growth saw leaps and bounds, much like my frantic sprints to catch numerous sunsets!

### Nuggets of Solitary Wisdom

If you're considering your own solo escapade, here’s my seasoned take:
- **Embrace Spontaneity**: You never know when a hidden trail might lead to a breathtaking vista or when a local festival might turn into the night of your life.
- **Pack Light, Pack Right**: There’s a fine line between prepared and ""I can’t carry this on my own"". Trust me, your back will thank you.
- **Converse Like No One’s Judging**: Whether it's with fellow travelers or locals, every conversation is a doorway to a new perspective.
  
Above all, solo travel is about savoring each moment – yes, even those ripe with mishaps. It's in these solo moments that we remember the essence of our inherent curiosity, courage, and the joy of wandering alone yet never lonely.

We all have reasons to be spending them alone, but that doesn't make it any easier. Seeing our friends and the people around us talk about and disappear for family dinners and outings hurts. It reminds us that we no longer have that and it makes it impossible to ignore.

 Right now is my favorite time of year. Good food, scary movies, late nights... But I have no one to share that with and I'm tired of it. I want to hangout with someone and vibe and laugh. Maybe even cuddle and kiss if the chemistry is there. 

It's October. October is for taking long walks and seeing all the trees, talking the whole time. It's for watching all the classic horror movies and enjoying every scare and every cheesy effect. It's for eating warm, comforting food while it gets colder and colder outside. For carving pumpkins and watching the candles go out. I love October, but all of that would be better with someone by my side.

We're getting into the colder months, so it is the perfect time to hang out and cuddle up on the couch and watch a show or a movie together. (I love horror movies, but I am a huge scaredy cat.) Let's unwind and talk as we share a bit of warmth. Rest against me as we read or do our own thing, enjoying each other's presence.

I am a gigantic nerd. I enjoy video and board games, D&D, cheesey movies, cartoons/anime, etc... I am 5'7"" and a little chubby and comfortable with it. I'm mixed, have light brown skin, medium length curly hair, and a short beard. I swear like a sailor and enjoy making terrible, terrible puns. I'm very affectionate once I get to know you and really enjoy cuddling. I like getting to know people, despite how it can be a little awkward at first. I enjoy cooking for others, will cook for you, and will likely pester you about your favorite dishes. Open communication is important to me, as I find it helps get to know someone in the early stages while you are still getting used to one another. 

I would like you to be between 24-38 and pretty nerdy yourself. If you're more of a homebody, even better. You must have a sense of humor, as I enjoy being silly and love to just be dorks sometimes. It would be a big plus if you're a night owl too, as my own sleep schedule is pretty messed up. I don't mind if you are shy, so long as you don't mind if I am talkative. I prefer more femme presenting people, but the connection between us is far more important to me.

If this resonates with you at all, reach out and tell me a little about yourself. We can talk and meet for coffee, and see where things go from there.

I’m waiting for the call. Lots of cigarettes and coffee; phone in hand. It’s always this way. The call comes after six in the morning. They finally found the family.

- 

My car won’t start. I have no idea what’s wrong with it. I have to call a cruiser. I’m going to be late to my own crime scene. 

-

My partner is already on scene. He’s one in a room full of cops, all sick to their stomachs observing the work of a serial killer. 

My work.

Six years of doing this, and I’m still turned on by it. Coming back to the scene, still in charge of it, but from a different side. I keep my coat buttoned to hide how hard I am. 

My partner gives me the rundown. A family butchered and then all the pieces are stitched back together in a mismatched mass. No blood. They still don’t know how I do that, but to be fair, it took me years to figure it out.

As he talks, I survey the room. Everything is perfect. Exactly how I left it. A work of art.

Wait.

The stuffed teddy bear in the corner is facing away from the family. That’s not right. 

My heart drops. My scene was tampered with.

“Did you hear what I said, Joe?” I give my attention back to my partner. As he talks, I keep thinking about the bear. My throat tightens.

It’s not right.

“...let himself in through the kids window…”

I nod. I’m starting to sweat. Why is the bear facing the wrong way?!

“...switched out the eyes…”

My eye twitches. I inch toward the bear. Maybe someone hit it with their foot? 

No. 

It’s clearly the exact opposite of where I had it.

“They’ll be in to take the pictures in a few minutes.”

“Wait! What?!” 

“Pictures, Joe. Did you not get enough coffee?”

Pictures?! My scene is wrong! Someone shit on my canvas!I can’t let them take pictures! It’s all fucking wrong!

“Joe?!”

“What?!”

“Did you bite your lip? You’re bleeding.” 

My partner ushers everyone out of the room. I stay behind. I take the only chance I have. I reach down and grab the bear. I turn around, and my partner is staring at me. He’s holding his gun.

“What are you doing, Joe?”

“I thought I saw something, but I didn’t.”

“Then put the teddy bear back. We need to take pictures of the scene.”

I swallow. My hands are shaking. The bear stares back at me.

“Put it back.”

“No… it’s not right.”

“Make it face the wall, Joe.” 

“My work.”

“I’ve had my suspicions for a while now. You were late, so I took a chance and moved it myself. I figured it would drive you nuts.”

“Fuck you!”

I pull my gun and his bullet slams into my chest.

With my dying breath, I reach over and face the bear toward the family. 

My work is done.

We got along greatly at first and I thought I got lucky and didn’t have one of those MIL’s who were crazy and obsessed with their sons. However, I was quickly proven wrong when every situation turned into “him wanting to spend more time with his girlfriend than his own mother.” Let’s preface my next statement by saying that she was gone from his life for about 6 years(11-17) and he’d moved in with her about TWO WEEKS before I did. Which is a crazy fucking timeline but there was a lot going on and a lot of unsafeness going on so it was for the best. She had a METH ADDICTION the whole time she was out of his life and her 2 other kid’s (yeah idgaf she weaponizes it when she needs to and was fired from a job at a rehab facility because she swapped meth for alcohol 2 years into sobriety and got fucking caught, so boohoo her business. ) So to say the least their relationship was fragile. I UNDERSTOOD THAT. I encouraged him to spend as much time with her as possible because we would always have our scheduled dates and talks before bed. We’d always have coffee and a smoke in the morning so it didn’t matter where the big time was spent because the little time was great. Then they started working together. He came home from work really shook up  and not wanting to talk about his day. Normally he’d describe the car ride, the day, the drive home, and he’d be super animated about it. But he didn’t want to talk about going to or from work which I thought was weird. Turns out on the way home his mom went on a long rant about how she’s only had bad experiences with black people. Not like every time she’s had an experience with a black person it was bad, no, any time shes had a bad experience in LIFE. it was a black person’s fault….. She grew up in a small town, graduating class of 75 its that small, IN INDIANA, and the only BAD EXPERIENCES she’s had in her life were the result of black people…., Obviously I was flabbergasted. That’s when my thoughts started to spiral about every single micro aggression I KNEW WAS A MICRO AGGRESSION, but I pushed it off to keep the peace. When we first met and she told me my hair was interesting and she personally could never handle “wasting so much time on it”. (5hrs for box braids- I do them myself) When she said she always wanted cute little mixed baby’s but “never met the right black guy”. LIKE COME ON. Well, after a swift falling out, we moved out and six months later I am still fostering the relationship between my boyfriend and his fuckass mom. For example. Today he woke up to a last minute text from her asking if he wants to go to a festival in 30 min. He said he has plans as all my siblings are coming over and we’re gonna hang out while I do my sister’s hair. She guilt tripped explaining it was for her birthday(5 days away jessica?) and he gave in. I let it go, he’d be home by dinner and he promised to bring me a gift. done deal. NOW TO THE BEST PART. She fucking pulls up with a trash bag of clothes for him and pulls out a bright pink shirt. throws her head back and fucking cackles so loud I can hear it through the window im peeping through. He’s just standing there. Like not moving an inch. thats it. she pulls out that shirt only and sends him inside. He opens the door WITH TEARS IN HIS FUCKING EYES AND OPENES THE GODDAMN BAG AND PULLS OUT THAT GODDAMN SHIRT AND IT FUCKING SAYS “THIS IS MY CIRCUS, THESE ARE MY MONKEYS”. he said, “im not going to touch this, do what you will” AND I THREW IT IN THE FUCKING TRASH. WHET ELSE WAS I GONNA DO?! Anyways. Now that that’s off my chest I’m not going to blow up at her and speak without thinking, but how tf do I respond to this? BF called her out but I want to stick up for myself and more importantly my siblings.

Back in a college social psych class, I read an interesting study about how hanging out with fat people will eventually lead you to be fat too (I mean we’ve all seen it). I think it certainly extends to other unhealthy habits and when it’s your spouse that has them it’s not like you can exactly shut them down and change your social circle. Sure, you can vet a lot of these things before marriage but honestly they’re small compared to alignment on life values, overall levels of mutual attraction, security, etc. So, I’m wondering how you manage to net get those bad habits creep on you over time and become part of your routine - here’s unhealthy habits of my husband that bother me and i’m trying to be more intentional about:

-sleeping in - I like to wake up early but feel forced to be quiet until he wakes up and over time i noticed my alarm go from 6am to 8:59am). maybe i could do a morning yoga class or something but i honestly lack motivation. my ideal would be that we both wake up early, have morning sex, cooked breakfast and then go about our day but i obviously can’t force it on him 

-snack choice - so, we’re on a flight or a day trip, and he’s going to go for jerky, string cheese, cookies whereas i like to have fruit or nuts with me. sure we can each eat different snacks but honestly exposure to unhealthy foods make me want to try some of his and he tends to make jokes about my lame snacks 

-sports betting - luckily, i have not a single gambling bone in my body so i don’t consider it a risk for me but still I spend way too much time listening about his sports, games, athlete stories. i have zero/negative interest on football but i can probably call most penalties before they’re even announced on tv. not a useful life skill, and would prefer never to watch another football game in my life lol 

-coffee habits - so i actually was largely caffeine-free but he always buys a coffee in the morning and offers me one and I sometimes end up accepting and before you know it i drink more coffee than i know. at the very least, i tried to convince him for us to get a coffee machine at home (where we live, 2 iced lattes will set you back $15+) but he says it doesn’t taste the same if made at home and we’re back to square one. i’ve reduced my caffeine intake with switching to matcha and other fancy teas but still it’s not something i struggled with before him 

-planning trips - i like planning things ahead to maximize the itinerary, he is more spontaneous. so i’d usually take the lead on making the itinerary but we tend to travel a lot and it’s a lot of emotional labor and makes me feel
unappreciated. so over time i stop doing that and it has a negative impact of me because i’m enjoying the haphazard nature of the trip less (i have less to look forward to) and not having the plan stresses me. i think this might be a bit of a gender difference but not necessarily (my HS bf would always plan everything to an hour for vacations and i could leave my brain back home if i wanted to, so there’re some men who plan shit too)

There have been various things that happened over the 3 years we have been together, our first month of being together I found a message on Facebook where he asked another girl for his number, when he saw he got really mad and threw his phone against the wall in anger. After things calmed down he took a nap and did not sort things out at first. He did however apologize and said its nothing serious and that she is only a friend. A few months passed and one night a friend asked if they could have a boys night they went out and I told him that he should enjoy his night, the next day he came to visit me and we were looking at something on Facebook together , I has a funny feeling and went through his messages ( which I should not have done) and I saw a message from another girl asking ""hey will you still be picking me up ?"" when he came back from the bathroom he saw the look on my face and knew what I saw, his explanation was him and his friend were talking about friends from school and her name came up ( the girl who sent the message) he said his friend asked if they could search her on Facebook and talk to her , my fiancé said he was not the one talking to her over Facebook but his friend ( I was skeptical and still am) he also apologized and said he wanted to tell me what happened, they did not pick her up hence the last message being the girl asking if they will  He also after a while deactivated his Facebook saying he does not want to hurt me.  Sorry for the long post it is a lot. There have been other things that have happened, but I am just naming a few, the week before the breakup everything was fine and he phoned me every afternoon after work and he even came to my house after work to visit me. Wednesday night was my aunts wedding and he could only come to the reception as he was working , when he got there everything was good, I had to leave early as I was house sitting my aunts house I thought he would go with me but he wanted to stay later , I told him that he should enjoy the night and just to be safe and he told me he loves me and he won't disappoint me by getting drunk and driving drunk ( which he has done before and got into an accident and caused him to be in a coma for 3 hours). At 12 the evening I received a message from him saying "" I am home save""  at 4am in the morning I got a phone call from his mother asking where he is as he did not go home ( some context his house got robbed and they stole everything hence why he had to move back to his parents)  I told her he said he is safe home, I tried phoning him and he then told me that he slept over by a friend close to the wedding venue, I was hurt as he lied to me where he was and we got into an argument and  I asked him if he was truthful about where he was , he was mad and told me he does not understand why he would ask that. He also said he can't live up to my standards and I need to decide what I want.  We did not  make up but Friday night he asked me if I still wanted to go with him to a festival we planned on going to with his parents I said yes and he said we are leaving at 6am on Saturday morning. I woke up early to get ready and by 6am no one showed up , I then tried phoning him and he did not pick up eventually he sent me a message saying he is no longer going as he is tired, I  was upset as I already got ready and he did not bother telling me, I told him he could have told me and I got no reply, I phoned his mom as I left something in their car and wanted to ask if they would be okay dropping it off before they go to the festival, When I phoned her she told me she does not know if they are going as her son is not home yet and he told her he was with me ( which he was not) I was so angry and hurt and tried phoning him he did not answer eventually I left him a voice message saying I am hurt and that we need to talk and that he is pushing me away  by the things he is doing and it's going to take  more time for me to forgive him. He then later the day sent a WhatsApp message saying we should go our separate ways . He did not even try to come and meet in person to talk it out, after we broke up he asked if he could get the car we bought together and he would pay me off for it ( I paid 75% of the car and he only paid 15%) I am very hurt and am so confused as he paid money into my account the night before for the wedding ( as we were paying off the wedding together)

  
I tried phoning him after the breakup and he said to not call him as he does not want to hear me cry. He also sent an voice note saying he just knew he could not make me happy and give me what I wanted and the happiness I was looking for and that he does not see a future with me in it.

  
I am unsure if I allowed to many disrespect and ill treatment from him but he is making me feel like I am at fault as he could not make me happy.

  
after everything he did not apologize once for being dishonest 

  
He also asked after everything happened about 2 weeks later he said he wants to stay in contact and maybe we could go for coffee and talk about everything.

  
I am hesitant and not sure what to do, I don't want to go but somehow I still love him and want to hear him out but on the other hand I feel like it will hurt me more if I go than anything else.",2,1728834464.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

1g2skbn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1g2skbn/how_do_you_stop_inadvertently_picking_up_bad/,How do you stop inadvertently picking up bad habits of your spouse? ,"Back in a college social psych class, I read an interesting study about how hanging out with fat people will eventually lead you to be fat too (I mean we’ve all seen it). I think it certainly extends to other unhealthy habits and when it’s your spouse that has them it’s not like you can exactly shut them down and change your social circle. Sure, you can vet a lot of these things before marriage but honestly they’re small compared to alignment on life values, overall levels of mutual attraction, security, etc. So, I’m wondering how you manage to net get those bad habits creep on you over time and become part of your routine - here’s unhealthy habits of my husband that bother me and i’m trying to be more intentional about:

-sleeping in - I like to wake up early but feel forced to be quiet until he wakes up and over time i noticed my alarm go from 6am to 8:59am). maybe i could do a morning yoga class or something but i honestly lack motivation. my ideal would be that we both wake up early, have morning sex, cooked breakfast and then go about our day but i obviously can’t force it on him 

-snack choice - so, we’re on a flight or a day trip, and he’s going to go for jerky, string cheese, cookies whereas i like to have fruit or nuts with me. sure we can each eat different snacks but honestly exposure to unhealthy foods make me want to try some of his and he tends to make jokes about my lame snacks 

-sports betting - luckily, i have not a single gambling bone in my body so i don’t consider it a risk for me but still I spend way too much time listening about his sports, games, athlete stories. i have zero/negative interest on football but i can probably call most penalties before they’re even announced on tv. not a useful life skill, and would prefer never to watch another football game in my life lol 

-coffee habits - so i actually was largely caffeine-free but he always buys a coffee in the morning and offers me one and I sometimes end up accepting and before you know it i drink more coffee than i know. at the very least, i tried to convince him for us to get a coffee machine at home (where we live, 2 iced lattes will set you back $15+) but he says it doesn’t taste the same if made at home and we’re back to square one. i’ve reduced my caffeine intake with switching to matcha and other fancy teas but still it’s not something i struggled with before him 

-planning trips - i like planning things ahead to maximize the itinerary, he is more spontaneous. so i’d usually take the lead on making the itinerary but we tend to travel a lot and it’s a lot of emotional labor and makes me feel
unappreciated. so over time i stop doing that and it has a negative impact of me because i’m enjoying the haphazard nature of the trip less (i have less to look forward to) and not having the plan stresses me. i think this might be a bit of a gender difference but not necessarily (my HS bf would always plan everything to an hour for vacations and i could leave my brain back home if i wanted to, so there’re some men who plan shit too)

there’s more but this is a long post so i’ll stop for now

What is Java Burn?

Java Burn is an innovative dietary supplement designed to boost metabolism and promote weight loss. Unlike traditional supplements, it comes in a powdered form meant to be mixed with your morning coffee. This unique approach allows users to seamlessly incorporate it into their daily routine without altering their coffee’s taste.

Java Burn is formulated with natural ingredients known for their potential to enhance metabolism, increase energy levels, and support weight management. The product has gained popularity for its convenience and its promise of effortless weight loss, making it an intriguing option for those looking to shed extra pounds without significant lifestyle changes.

# Ingredients of Java Burn

Java Burn is a marketed as a coffee additive that can be mixed with your morning cup to boost energy levels, support metabolism, and assist in fat burnin

Here is a detailed overview of the key ingredients found in Java Burn

# Green Tea Extract

Green tea extract is rich in catechins, particularly EGCG (Epigallocatechin gallate), which are powerful antioxidants. These compounds have been shown to boost metabolism and increase fat burning, especially in the abdominal area.

Green tea extract also provides a mild caffeine boost, enhancing energy levels and focus.

L-Carnitine

# [Visit The Java Burn Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

L-Carnitine is an amino acid that plays a crucial role in energy production. It helps transport fatty acids into the mitochondria of cells, where they can be burned for energy.

This process not only supports fat loss but also helps improve exercise performance and recovery.

L-Theanine

L-Theanine is an amino acid commonly found in tea leaves. It’s known for its ability to promote relaxation without sedation.

When combined with caffeine, as in Java Burn, it can help improve focus and reduce the jittery effects often associated with caffeine consumption.

Chromium

Chromium is an essential mineral that plays a vital role in insulin function and glucose metabolism.

It helps regulate blood sugar levels, which can reduce cravings for sugary foods and carbohydrates.

Chlorogenic Acid

Derived from green coffee beans, chlorogenic acid is a polyphenol antioxidant. It’s believed to slow the absorption of carbohydrates in the digestive system and improve metabolism.

This can lead to reduced blood sugar spikes and potentially aid in weight loss.

Vitamin B6 and B12

These B vitamins are crucial for energy metabolism. They help convert the food you eat into usable energy, which is essential for maintaining a high metabolism.

B vitamins also support the nervous system and can help reduce fatigue, potentially improving exercise performance and overall energy levels.

# Java Burn Benefits

**Enhanced Metabolism:** Java Burn’s primary benefit is its ability to boost metabolism. By increasing your metabolic rate, your body becomes more efficient at burning calories throughout the day, even when you’re not actively exercising.

**Increased Energy Levels:** The combination of caffeine from your coffee and the energy-boosting ingredients in Java Burn can provide a sustained energy boost.

**Appetite Suppression:** Some of the ingredients in Java Burn, particularly chromium, may help regulate blood sugar levels and reduce cravings. This can lead to decreased appetite and less frequent snacking, supporting your weight loss efforts.

**Fat Burning:** The green tea extract and L-carnitine in Java Burn are known for their fat-burning properties. They can help your body more effectively use fat for energy, potentially leading to a reduction in overall body fat percentage.

**Improved Focus and Cognitive Function:** The combination of L-theanine and caffeine can lead to improved mental clarity and focus. This “smart caffeine” effect can help you stay sharp and alert without the jitters often associated with coffee alone.

**Convenience:** One of the most significant benefits of Java Burn is its ease of use. By simply adding it to your morning coffee, you can potentially boost your weight loss efforts without changing your routine or diet dramatically.

**Natural Ingredients:** Java Burn is made with natural ingredients, which may appeal to those who prefer to avoid synthetic compounds in their supplements.

**Antioxidant Support:** Several ingredients in Java Burn, such as green tea extract and chlorogenic acid, are rich in antioxidants. These can help combat oxidative stress in the body and support overall health.

**Potential Blood Sugar Regulation:** The chromium and chlorogenic acid in Java Burn may help regulate blood sugar levels, which is beneficial not only for weight management but also for overall health.

**No Artificial Additives:** Java Burn is free from artificial colors, preservatives, and fillers, making it a cleaner option compared to many other dietary supplements on the market.

There are two ways that the ingredients in Java Burn coffee help you lose weight. In order to do this, a shortage in calories and an increase in metabolism are needed.

What is Java Burn?

Java Burn is an innovative dietary supplement designed to boost metabolism and promote weight loss. Unlike traditional supplements, it comes in a powdered form meant to be mixed with your morning coffee. This unique approach allows users to seamlessly incorporate it into their daily routine without altering their coffee’s taste.

Java Burn is formulated with natural ingredients known for their potential to enhance metabolism, increase energy levels, and support weight management. The product has gained popularity for its convenience and its promise of effortless weight loss, making it an intriguing option for those looking to shed extra pounds without significant lifestyle changes.

# Ingredients of Java Burn

Java Burn is a marketed as a coffee additive that can be mixed with your morning cup to boost energy levels, support metabolism, and assist in fat burnin

Here is a detailed overview of the key ingredients found in Java Burn

# Green Tea Extract

Green tea extract is rich in catechins, particularly EGCG (Epigallocatechin gallate), which are powerful antioxidants. These compounds have been shown to boost metabolism and increase fat burning, especially in the abdominal area.

Green tea extract also provides a mild caffeine boost, enhancing energy levels and focus.

L-Carnitine

# [Visit The Java Burn Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

L-Carnitine is an amino acid that plays a crucial role in energy production. It helps transport fatty acids into the mitochondria of cells, where they can be burned for energy.

This process not only supports fat loss but also helps improve exercise performance and recovery.

L-Theanine

L-Theanine is an amino acid commonly found in tea leaves. It’s known for its ability to promote relaxation without sedation.

When combined with caffeine, as in Java Burn, it can help improve focus and reduce the jittery effects often associated with caffeine consumption.

Chromium

Chromium is an essential mineral that plays a vital role in insulin function and glucose metabolism.

It helps regulate blood sugar levels, which can reduce cravings for sugary foods and carbohydrates.

Chlorogenic Acid

Derived from green coffee beans, chlorogenic acid is a polyphenol antioxidant. It’s believed to slow the absorption of carbohydrates in the digestive system and improve metabolism.

This can lead to reduced blood sugar spikes and potentially aid in weight loss.

Vitamin B6 and B12

These B vitamins are crucial for energy metabolism. They help convert the food you eat into usable energy, which is essential for maintaining a high metabolism.

B vitamins also support the nervous system and can help reduce fatigue, potentially improving exercise performance and overall energy levels.

**Convenience:** One of the most significant benefits of Java Burn is its ease of use. By simply adding it to your morning coffee, you can potentially boost your weight loss efforts without changing your routine or diet dramatically.

**Natural Ingredients:** Java Burn is made with natural ingredients, which may appeal to those who prefer to avoid synthetic compounds in their supplements.

**Antioxidant Support:** Several ingredients in Java Burn, such as green tea extract and chlorogenic acid, are rich in antioxidants. These can help combat oxidative stress in the body and support overall health.

**Potential Blood Sugar Regulation:** The chromium and chlorogenic acid in Java Burn may help regulate blood sugar levels, which is beneficial not only for weight management but also for overall health.

**No Artificial Additives:** Java Burn is free from artificial colors, preservatives, and fillers, making it a cleaner option compared to many other dietary supplements on the market.

What is Java Burn?

Java Burn is an innovative dietary supplement designed to boost metabolism and promote weight loss. Unlike traditional supplements, it comes in a powdered form meant to be mixed with your morning coffee. This unique approach allows users to seamlessly incorporate it into their daily routine without altering their coffee’s taste.

Java Burn is formulated with natural ingredients known for their potential to enhance metabolism, increase energy levels, and support weight management. The product has gained popularity for its convenience and its promise of effortless weight loss, making it an intriguing option for those looking to shed extra pounds without significant lifestyle changes.

# Ingredients of Java Burn

Java Burn is a marketed as a coffee additive that can be mixed with your morning cup to boost energy levels, support metabolism, and assist in fat burnin

Here is a detailed overview of the key ingredients found in Java Burn

# Green Tea Extract

Green tea extract is rich in catechins, particularly EGCG (Epigallocatechin gallate), which are powerful antioxidants. These compounds have been shown to boost metabolism and increase fat burning, especially in the abdominal area.

Green tea extract also provides a mild caffeine boost, enhancing energy levels and focus.

L-Carnitine

# [Visit The Java Burn Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

L-Carnitine is an amino acid that plays a crucial role in energy production. It helps transport fatty acids into the mitochondria of cells, where they can be burned for energy.

This process not only supports fat loss but also helps improve exercise performance and recovery.

L-Theanine

L-Theanine is an amino acid commonly found in tea leaves. It’s known for its ability to promote relaxation without sedation.

When combined with caffeine, as in Java Burn, it can help improve focus and reduce the jittery effects often associated with caffeine consumption.

Chromium

Chromium is an essential mineral that plays a vital role in insulin function and glucose metabolism.

It helps regulate blood sugar levels, which can reduce cravings for sugary foods and carbohydrates.

Chlorogenic Acid

Derived from green coffee beans, chlorogenic acid is a polyphenol antioxidant. It’s believed to slow the absorption of carbohydrates in the digestive system and improve metabolism.

This can lead to reduced blood sugar spikes and potentially aid in weight loss.

Vitamin B6 and B12

These B vitamins are crucial for energy metabolism. They help convert the food you eat into usable energy, which is essential for maintaining a high metabolism.

B vitamins also support the nervous system and can help reduce fatigue, potentially improving exercise performance and overall energy levels.

**Convenience:** One of the most significant benefits of Java Burn is its ease of use. By simply adding it to your morning coffee, you can potentially boost your weight loss efforts without changing your routine or diet dramatically.

**Natural Ingredients:** Java Burn is made with natural ingredients, which may appeal to those who prefer to avoid synthetic compounds in their supplements.

**Antioxidant Support:** Several ingredients in Java Burn, such as green tea extract and chlorogenic acid, are rich in antioxidants. These can help combat oxidative stress in the body and support overall health.

**Potential Blood Sugar Regulation:** The chromium and chlorogenic acid in Java Burn may help regulate blood sugar levels, which is beneficial not only for weight management but also for overall health.

What is Java Burn?

Java Burn is an innovative dietary supplement designed to boost metabolism and promote weight loss. Unlike traditional supplements, it comes in a powdered form meant to be mixed with your morning coffee. This unique approach allows users to seamlessly incorporate it into their daily routine without altering their coffee’s taste.

Java Burn is formulated with natural ingredients known for their potential to enhance metabolism, increase energy levels, and support weight management. The product has gained popularity for its convenience and its promise of effortless weight loss, making it an intriguing option for those looking to shed extra pounds without significant lifestyle changes.

# Ingredients of Java Burn

Java Burn is a marketed as a coffee additive that can be mixed with your morning cup to boost energy levels, support metabolism, and assist in fat burnin

Here is a detailed overview of the key ingredients found in Java Burn

# Green Tea Extract

Green tea extract is rich in catechins, particularly EGCG (Epigallocatechin gallate), which are powerful antioxidants. These compounds have been shown to boost metabolism and increase fat burning, especially in the abdominal area.

Green tea extract also provides a mild caffeine boost, enhancing energy levels and focus.

L-Carnitine

# [Visit The Java Burn Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

L-Carnitine is an amino acid that plays a crucial role in energy production. It helps transport fatty acids into the mitochondria of cells, where they can be burned for energy.

This process not only supports fat loss but also helps improve exercise performance and recovery.

L-Theanine

L-Theanine is an amino acid commonly found in tea leaves. It’s known for its ability to promote relaxation without sedation.

When combined with caffeine, as in Java Burn, it can help improve focus and reduce the jittery effects often associated with caffeine consumption.

Chromium

Chromium is an essential mineral that plays a vital role in insulin function and glucose metabolism.

It helps regulate blood sugar levels, which can reduce cravings for sugary foods and carbohydrates.

Chlorogenic Acid

Derived from green coffee beans, chlorogenic acid is a polyphenol antioxidant. It’s believed to slow the absorption of carbohydrates in the digestive system and improve metabolism.

This can lead to reduced blood sugar spikes and potentially aid in weight loss.

Vitamin B6 and B12

These B vitamins are crucial for energy metabolism. They help convert the food you eat into usable energy, which is essential for maintaining a high metabolism.

B vitamins also support the nervous system and can help reduce fatigue, potentially improving exercise performance and overall energy levels.

**Improved Focus and Cognitive Function:** The combination of L-theanine and caffeine can lead to improved mental clarity and focus. This “smart caffeine” effect can help you stay sharp and alert without the jitters often associated with coffee alone.

**Convenience:** One of the most significant benefits of Java Burn is its ease of use. By simply adding it to your morning coffee, you can potentially boost your weight loss efforts without changing your routine or diet dramatically.

**Natural Ingredients:** Java Burn is made with natural ingredients, which may appeal to those who prefer to avoid synthetic compounds in their supplements.

**Antioxidant Support:** Several ingredients in Java Burn, such as green tea extract and chlorogenic acid, are rich in antioxidants. These can help combat oxidative stress in the body and support overall health.

**Potential Blood Sugar Regulation:** The chromium and chlorogenic acid in Java Burn may help regulate blood sugar levels, which is beneficial not only for weight management but also for overall health.

**No Artificial Additives:** Java Burn is free from artificial colors, preservatives, and fillers, making it a cleaner option compared to many other dietary supplements on the market.

# Ingredients of Java Burn

Java Burn is a marketed as a coffee additive that can be mixed with your morning cup to boost energy levels, support metabolism, and assist in fat burnin

Here is a detailed overview of the key ingredients found in Java Burn

# Green Tea Extract

Green tea extract is rich in catechins, particularly EGCG (Epigallocatechin gallate), which are powerful antioxidants. These compounds have been shown to boost metabolism and increase fat burning, especially in the abdominal area.

Green tea extract also provides a mild caffeine boost, enhancing energy levels and focus.

L-Carnitine

# [Visit The Java Burn Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

L-Carnitine is an amino acid that plays a crucial role in energy production. It helps transport fatty acids into the mitochondria of cells, where they can be burned for energy.

This process not only supports fat loss but also helps improve exercise performance and recovery.

L-Theanine

L-Theanine is an amino acid commonly found in tea leaves. It’s known for its ability to promote relaxation without sedation.

When combined with caffeine, as in Java Burn, it can help improve focus and reduce the jittery effects often associated with caffeine consumption.

Chromium

Chromium is an essential mineral that plays a vital role in insulin function and glucose metabolism.

It helps regulate blood sugar levels, which can reduce cravings for sugary foods and carbohydrates.

Chlorogenic Acid

Derived from green coffee beans, chlorogenic acid is a polyphenol antioxidant. It’s believed to slow the absorption of carbohydrates in the digestive system and improve metabolism.

This can lead to reduced blood sugar spikes and potentially aid in weight loss.

Vitamin B6 and B12

These B vitamins are crucial for energy metabolism. They help convert the food you eat into usable energy, which is essential for maintaining a high metabolism.

B vitamins also support the nervous system and can help reduce fatigue, potentially improving exercise performance and overall energy levels.

**Enhanced Metabolism:** Java Burn’s primary benefit is its ability to boost metabolism. By increasing your metabolic rate, your body becomes more efficient at burning calories throughout the day, even when you’re not actively exercising.

**Increased Energy Levels:** The combination of caffeine from your coffee and the energy-boosting ingredients in Java Burn can provide a sustained energy boost.

**Appetite Suppression:** Some of the ingredients in Java Burn, particularly chromium, may help regulate blood sugar levels and reduce cravings. This can lead to decreased appetite and less frequent snacking, supporting your weight loss efforts.

**Fat Burning:** The green tea extract and L-carnitine in Java Burn are known for their fat-burning properties. They can help your body more effectively use fat for energy, potentially leading to a reduction in overall body fat percentage.

**Improved Focus and Cognitive Function:** The combination of L-theanine and caffeine can lead to improved mental clarity and focus. This “smart caffeine” effect can help you stay sharp and alert without the jitters often associated with coffee alone.

**Convenience:** One of the most significant benefits of Java Burn is its ease of use. By simply adding it to your morning coffee, you can potentially boost your weight loss efforts without changing your routine or diet dramatically.

**Natural Ingredients:** Java Burn is made with natural ingredients, which may appeal to those who prefer to avoid synthetic compounds in their supplements.

**Antioxidant Support:** Several ingredients in Java Burn, such as green tea extract and chlorogenic acid, are rich in antioxidants. These can help combat oxidative stress in the body and support overall health.

**Potential Blood Sugar Regulation:** The chromium and chlorogenic acid in Java Burn may help regulate blood sugar levels, which is beneficial not only for weight management but also for overall health.

**No Artificial Additives:** Java Burn is free from artificial colors, preservatives, and fillers, making it a cleaner option compared to many other dietary supplements on the market.

# Java Burn Benefits

**Enhanced Metabolism:** Java Burn’s primary benefit is its ability to boost metabolism. By increasing your metabolic rate, your body becomes more efficient at burning calories throughout the day, even when you’re not actively exercising.

**Increased Energy Levels:** The combination of caffeine from your coffee and the energy-boosting ingredients in Java Burn can provide a sustained energy boost.

**Appetite Suppression:** Some of the ingredients in Java Burn, particularly chromium, may help regulate blood sugar levels and reduce cravings. This can lead to decreased appetite and less frequent snacking, supporting your weight loss efforts.

**Fat Burning:** The green tea extract and L-carnitine in Java Burn are known for their fat-burning properties. They can help your body more effectively use fat for energy, potentially leading to a reduction in overall body fat percentage.

**Improved Focus and Cognitive Function:** The combination of L-theanine and caffeine can lead to improved mental clarity and focus. This “smart caffeine” effect can help you stay sharp and alert without the jitters often associated with coffee alone.

**Convenience:** One of the most significant benefits of Java Burn is its ease of use. By simply adding it to your morning coffee, you can potentially boost your weight loss efforts without changing your routine or diet dramatically.

**Natural Ingredients:** Java Burn is made with natural ingredients, which may appeal to those who prefer to avoid synthetic compounds in their supplements.

**Antioxidant Support:** Several ingredients in Java Burn, such as green tea extract and chlorogenic acid, are rich in antioxidants. These can help combat oxidative stress in the body and support overall health.

**Potential Blood Sugar Regulation:** The chromium and chlorogenic acid in Java Burn may help regulate blood sugar levels, which is beneficial not only for weight management but also for overall health.

**No Artificial Additives:** Java Burn is free from artificial colors, preservatives, and fillers, making it a cleaner option compared to many other dietary supplements on the market.

What is Java Burn?

Java Burn is an innovative dietary supplement designed to boost metabolism and promote weight loss. Unlike traditional supplements, it comes in a powdered form meant to be mixed with your morning coffee. This unique approach allows users to seamlessly incorporate it into their daily routine without altering their coffee’s taste.

Java Burn is formulated with natural ingredients known for their potential to enhance metabolism, increase energy levels, and support weight management. The product has gained popularity for its convenience and its promise of effortless weight loss, making it an intriguing option for those looking to shed extra pounds without significant lifestyle changes.

# Ingredients of Java Burn

Java Burn is a marketed as a coffee additive that can be mixed with your morning cup to boost energy levels, support metabolism, and assist in fat burnin

Here is a detailed overview of the key ingredients found in Java Burn

# Green Tea Extract

Green tea extract is rich in catechins, particularly EGCG (Epigallocatechin gallate), which are powerful antioxidants. These compounds have been shown to boost metabolism and increase fat burning, especially in the abdominal area.

Green tea extract also provides a mild caffeine boost, enhancing energy levels and focus.

L-Carnitine

# [Visit The Java Burn Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

L-Carnitine is an amino acid that plays a crucial role in energy production. It helps transport fatty acids into the mitochondria of cells, where they can be burned for energy.

This process not only supports fat loss but also helps improve exercise performance and recovery.

L-Theanine

L-Theanine is an amino acid commonly found in tea leaves. It’s known for its ability to promote relaxation without sedation.

When combined with caffeine, as in Java Burn, it can help improve focus and reduce the jittery effects often associated with caffeine consumption.

Chromium

Chromium is an essential mineral that plays a vital role in insulin function and glucose metabolism.

It helps regulate blood sugar levels, which can reduce cravings for sugary foods and carbohydrates.

Chlorogenic Acid

Derived from green coffee beans, chlorogenic acid is a polyphenol antioxidant. It’s believed to slow the absorption of carbohydrates in the digestive system and improve metabolism.

This can lead to reduced blood sugar spikes and potentially aid in weight loss.

Vitamin B6 and B12

These B vitamins are crucial for energy metabolism. They help convert the food you eat into usable energy, which is essential for maintaining a high metabolism.

B vitamins also support the nervous system and can help reduce fatigue, potentially improving exercise performance and overall energy levels.

What is Java Burn?

Java Burn is an innovative dietary supplement designed to boost metabolism and promote weight loss. Unlike traditional supplements, it comes in a powdered form meant to be mixed with your morning coffee. This unique approach allows users to seamlessly incorporate it into their daily routine without altering their coffee’s taste.

Java Burn is formulated with natural ingredients known for their potential to enhance metabolism, increase energy levels, and support weight management. The product has gained popularity for its convenience and its promise of effortless weight loss, making it an intriguing option for those looking to shed extra pounds without significant lifestyle changes.

# Ingredients of Java Burn

Java Burn is a marketed as a coffee additive that can be mixed with your morning cup to boost energy levels, support metabolism, and assist in fat burnin

Here is a detailed overview of the key ingredients found in Java Burn

# Green Tea Extract

Green tea extract is rich in catechins, particularly EGCG (Epigallocatechin gallate), which are powerful antioxidants. These compounds have been shown to boost metabolism and increase fat burning, especially in the abdominal area.

Green tea extract also provides a mild caffeine boost, enhancing energy levels and focus.

L-Carnitine

# [Visit The Java Burn Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

L-Carnitine is an amino acid that plays a crucial role in energy production. It helps transport fatty acids into the mitochondria of cells, where they can be burned for energy.

This process not only supports fat loss but also helps improve exercise performance and recovery.

L-Theanine

L-Theanine is an amino acid commonly found in tea leaves. It’s known for its ability to promote relaxation without sedation.

When combined with caffeine, as in Java Burn, it can help improve focus and reduce the jittery effects often associated with caffeine consumption.

Chromium

Chromium is an essential mineral that plays a vital role in insulin function and glucose metabolism.

It helps regulate blood sugar levels, which can reduce cravings for sugary foods and carbohydrates.

Chlorogenic Acid

Derived from green coffee beans, chlorogenic acid is a polyphenol antioxidant. It’s believed to slow the absorption of carbohydrates in the digestive system and improve metabolism.

This can lead to reduced blood sugar spikes and potentially aid in weight loss.

Vitamin B6 and B12

These B vitamins are crucial for energy metabolism. They help convert the food you eat into usable energy, which is essential for maintaining a high metabolism.

B vitamins also support the nervous system and can help reduce fatigue, potentially improving exercise performance and overall energy levels.

**Appetite Suppression:** Some of the ingredients in Java Burn, particularly chromium, may help regulate blood sugar levels and reduce cravings. This can lead to decreased appetite and less frequent snacking, supporting your weight loss efforts.

**Improved Focus and Cognitive Function:** The combination of L-theanine and caffeine can lead to improved mental clarity and focus. This “smart caffeine” effect can help you stay sharp and alert without the jitters often associated with coffee alone.

**Convenience:** One of the most significant benefits of Java Burn is its ease of use. By simply adding it to your morning coffee, you can potentially boost your weight loss efforts without changing your routine or diet dramatically.

**Natural Ingredients:** Java Burn is made with natural ingredients, which may appeal to those who prefer to avoid synthetic compounds in their supplements.

**Antioxidant Support:** Several ingredients in Java Burn, such as green tea extract and chlorogenic acid, are rich in antioxidants. These can help combat oxidative stress in the body and support overall health.

**Potential Blood Sugar Regulation:** The chromium and chlorogenic acid in Java Burn may help regulate blood sugar levels, which is beneficial not only for weight management but also for overall health.

**No Artificial Additives:** Java Burn is free from artificial colors, preservatives, and fillers, making it a cleaner option compared to many other dietary supplements on the market.

Java Burn is an innovative dietary supplement designed to boost metabolism and promote weight loss. Unlike traditional supplements, it comes in a powdered form meant to be mixed with your morning coffee. This unique approach allows users to seamlessly incorporate it into their daily routine without altering their coffee’s taste.

Java Burn is formulated with natural ingredients known for their potential to enhance metabolism, increase energy levels, and support weight management. The product has gained popularity for its convenience and its promise of effortless weight loss, making it an intriguing option for those looking to shed extra pounds without significant lifestyle changes.

# Ingredients of Java Burn

Java Burn is a marketed as a coffee additive that can be mixed with your morning cup to boost energy levels, support metabolism, and assist in fat burnin

Here is a detailed overview of the key ingredients found in Java Burn

# Green Tea Extract

Green tea extract is rich in catechins, particularly EGCG (Epigallocatechin gallate), which are powerful antioxidants. These compounds have been shown to boost metabolism and increase fat burning, especially in the abdominal area.

Green tea extract also provides a mild caffeine boost, enhancing energy levels and focus.

L-Carnitine

# [Visit The Java Burn Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

L-Carnitine is an amino acid that plays a crucial role in energy production. It helps transport fatty acids into the mitochondria of cells, where they can be burned for energy.

This process not only supports fat loss but also helps improve exercise performance and recovery.

L-Theanine

L-Theanine is an amino acid commonly found in tea leaves. It’s known for its ability to promote relaxation without sedation.

When combined with caffeine, as in Java Burn, it can help improve focus and reduce the jittery effects often associated with caffeine consumption.

Chromium

Chromium is an essential mineral that plays a vital role in insulin function and glucose metabolism.

It helps regulate blood sugar levels, which can reduce cravings for sugary foods and carbohydrates.

Chlorogenic Acid

Derived from green coffee beans, chlorogenic acid is a polyphenol antioxidant. It’s believed to slow the absorption of carbohydrates in the digestive system and improve metabolism.

This can lead to reduced blood sugar spikes and potentially aid in weight loss.

Vitamin B6 and B12

These B vitamins are crucial for energy metabolism. They help convert the food you eat into usable energy, which is essential for maintaining a high metabolism.

B vitamins also support the nervous system and can help reduce fatigue, potentially improving exercise performance and overall energy levels.

What is Java Burn?

Java Burn is an innovative dietary supplement designed to boost metabolism and promote weight loss. Unlike traditional supplements, it comes in a powdered form meant to be mixed with your morning coffee. This unique approach allows users to seamlessly incorporate it into their daily routine without altering their coffee’s taste.

Java Burn is formulated with natural ingredients known for their potential to enhance metabolism, increase energy levels, and support weight management. The product has gained popularity for its convenience and its promise of effortless weight loss, making it an intriguing option for those looking to shed extra pounds without significant lifestyle changes.

# Ingredients of Java Burn

Java Burn is a marketed as a coffee additive that can be mixed with your morning cup to boost energy levels, support metabolism, and assist in fat burnin

Here is a detailed overview of the key ingredients found in Java Burn

# Green Tea Extract

Green tea extract is rich in catechins, particularly EGCG (Epigallocatechin gallate), which are powerful antioxidants. These compounds have been shown to boost metabolism and increase fat burning, especially in the abdominal area.

Green tea extract also provides a mild caffeine boost, enhancing energy levels and focus.

L-Carnitine

# [Visit The Java Burn Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

L-Carnitine is an amino acid that plays a crucial role in energy production. It helps transport fatty acids into the mitochondria of cells, where they can be burned for energy.

This process not only supports fat loss but also helps improve exercise performance and recovery.

L-Theanine

L-Theanine is an amino acid commonly found in tea leaves. It’s known for its ability to promote relaxation without sedation.

When combined with caffeine, as in Java Burn, it can help improve focus and reduce the jittery effects often associated with caffeine consumption.

Chromium

Chromium is an essential mineral that plays a vital role in insulin function and glucose metabolism.

It helps regulate blood sugar levels, which can reduce cravings for sugary foods and carbohydrates.

Chlorogenic Acid

Derived from green coffee beans, chlorogenic acid is a polyphenol antioxidant. It’s believed to slow the absorption of carbohydrates in the digestive system and improve metabolism.

This can lead to reduced blood sugar spikes and potentially aid in weight loss.

Vitamin B6 and B12

These B vitamins are crucial for energy metabolism. They help convert the food you eat into usable energy, which is essential for maintaining a high metabolism.

B vitamins also support the nervous system and can help reduce fatigue, potentially improving exercise performance and overall energy levels.

**Convenience:** One of the most significant benefits of Java Burn is its ease of use. By simply adding it to your morning coffee, you can potentially boost your weight loss efforts without changing your routine or diet dramatically.

**Natural Ingredients:** Java Burn is made with natural ingredients, which may appeal to those who prefer to avoid synthetic compounds in their supplements.

(F/30),"Tl;DR: after transitioning to long distance, I feel like I'm not a priority in my boyfriend's life anymore. Despite trying to be patient and trying to connect, I feel repetitively hurt by his actions and unreciprocated efforts. Seeking advice on how to deal with this situation as we plan on seeing each other next weekend.



Hey Reddit,

My bf (M/29) and I (F/30) transitioned to a LDR 5 weeks ago, after being together for 1.5 years. Before the distance, we were really confident in our relationship. I have anxious-avoidant attachment style (& big fear of abandonment) and his is secure. He's been amazing at helping me open up, trust & communicate more, making me feel safe and like I'm with the right person.

Some context: he's a foreigner living in my country, and I've supported him in a lot of ways - like when he had an accident and I took care of him in the hospital which brought us closer, supporting him financially when he was in struggling (I was the one offering and never the other way around). I was the one who encouraged him to move to the other city as I knew there'd be more opportunities for him to grow and not feel stuck here. He moved in with me for the last month to be able to save up a bit before relocating. When we lived in the same city, we spent a lot of time together, he didn't have that many friends and would mainly just work, go to the gym, see a few friends for coffee sometime and mainly spend time with me, and I really felt like an important part of his life.

Now in LD, the dynamic has changed and I feel like I'm not a priority anymore. Some specific things that have accumulated until now:

* the first week: he's been adjusting to a new city, new job, meeting new interesting people & artists (in his field of work), attending so many social events, partying every weekend, while I've felt a bit overwhelmed by the shift, not keeping up and feeling like we're not part of each other's lives as much, and like I can barely fit into his busy schedule.
* he suggested a call on a day, only to then cancel because of work party for him, which I understand was not personal but it still made me feel like I'm not as important.
* the 2nd week we decided to call each other whenever we feel like it, despite being out socially, even for just 5 minutes for a quick update/hear each other's voice (which was a compromise on my part, as I prefer to have long talks when we're both home alone). He called me while in a taxi with his friends, as they were going from bar A to bar B and I felt like an afterthought because I had to repeat myself several times when sharing something important, and it made me believe he's only calling me during this buffer time when he doesn't have anything else better to do. I communicated vulnerably via a 3min voice note to him how that made me feel, and he replied the next morning in 10 seconds voice note that ""he gets it, and that he'll be more mindful next time"".
* I felt very low and depressed, when he was at his highest (stimulated at work, feeling happy with many opportunities and being social) and these completely different frequencies made me feel so lonely. He then felt like I wasn't happy for his achievements and struggled to understand why I can't be the supportive gf I've always been. I told him I lack emotional & meaningful depth in our conversations which comes from lack of engagement from his side: he constantly asks me about my day in a very robotic and transactional manner, but when I do share whether via a voice note or during a call, he doesn't have any follow up questions and doesn't show any kind of engagement/curiosity.
* the 3rd week we decided to send each other photo updates to feel more involved in each others' lives, I finally felt connected again and like I'm having my bf back as he's made visible effort for quality calls.
* by the end of 3rd week, we had a big fight as I felt disrespected when he ignored me on a videocall while dealing with a buyer for his bike. I was calling out to him, and he just let me shout his name 5 times making me feel foolish in front of the buyer, just because a friend was talking to him. I communicated this frustration of feeling unimportant again, especially when I'm helping him out, and that triggered him, as he felt like I was unfairly blaming him for something out of his control (which I wasn't, I was blaming him for deciding to ignore me instead of telling me to wait 3 seconds so he could tell that friend that he's on a call).

I feel like we make 1 step forward and 3 steps back. I reached a point where I truly believe that he doesn't care about me as much, and the slightest action from his side could trigger me, making me feel that I don't matter anymore. We both have built resentment over the past month and are feeling disconnected: me because of the accumulation of disappointments and feeling undervalued, and him because he'd asked me to be patient in this transitional period and he doesn't feel like I'm making enough effort, that i'm being too demanding instead, and because I had asked for some space (I felt too emotionally exhausted). It's not helping that every time there's a glimpse of hope as we both make effort, it seems like the universe is against us (e.g. we scheduled a call on Wed, and something happens that day that makes it impossible)

Things are so bad that we're not even excited to see each other next weekend, but feeling anxious and scared of the outcome instead, because all this unresolved conflict makes us stuck in a negative loop of doubting this relationship. I really want to clear the air, move past this so we can feel connected again and enjoy our time together. I need advice on how to do that. Am I being too needy? Have any of you experienced similar situations in LDR?",2,1728833940.0,LDR,2,1.0,False
1g2sezc,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1g2sezc/my_dads_in_the_icu/,My dad's in the ICU,"My dad is in the ICU after having a bad accident at a race track with his bike during a professional race.

Sunday the 6th of October 2024 I got the call from his  S.O. that he'd had an accident. This happened in Germany while I was at work in Finland.

He shattered both femurs, hips and broke his left arm and unclear how many ribs. Do direct brain damage luckily but doctors are worried about the lungs and his kidneys. He was put on dialasys to protect the kidneys and a breathing tube was set with ventilator.

Today I arrived and got to see him...
It's critical but he is stable and is breathing almost completely on his own now. But he's gonna need a ton of surgery for his legs and doctors are telling me its a good chance he'd be bed ridden for the rest of his life. Knowing my dad, how he finds all joy in life by being able to work on his bike and ride it, or just you know being able to make his own damn coffee. It's hard when they ask me to come and that I am gonna have to decide what they do IF his heart stops for ex.

And considering the amount of anaesthesia from numerous surgeries and more coming, risk is great.

I don't think I could live with myself, seeing dad miserable in life because of a decision I made, but I couldn't imagine living without him either.
I stay 2½ days, during that time I have court and some time with my dad, try and get him to wake up.

When I arrived, I touched him and talked to him. He reacted and definitely heard me. Good sign.
But he has to wake up. They can't wake him.

I have a short visit, I might stay longer but I don't know. I am so lost, heartbroken, worried to death...
Might be easier with my support system at home.
Then fly back if something changes.

Sorry for long rambly text, It might be incoherent I don't know. I am lost.

I love you dad, please come back to me.

AITAH for leaving him with his SO to be with my support network at home. I'll fly back if anything changes.

Edit: Update, dad woke up. Manages to answer simple yes and no questions. He tried to speak but cant yet, but he worded ""I love you"" so I said it back.
Then asked if I shoukd go see my mom and sister, and he nodded. This makes me feel better but am I still being an asshole?",3,1728833912.0,AITAH,6,1.0,False

Every day is different, with a few tasks that are completed at the same time each day. 

Sometimes, the staff will finish a process early and have ~20-30 minutes (1-2 times per day at most) before their next one starts. Often during this time, they'll grab Starbucks from our cafeteria and hang out off the floor and chitchat, waiting for their next process to begin. When I first started in their role, there was no extra time. Everyone was always busy and we rarely got non-scheduled breaks. Most of the current managers are from my era of being on the floor, they recall not getting breaks and just hustling through their day all the time. We've made several workload distribution changes since then, (unintentionally?) resulting in some free time for the staff.

I love this. My staff can do their work and take a coffee break, hang out, socialize, whatever they need. One guy reads a book, someone else gets their grocery delivery order sorted for the week, etc. Their work always gets done and I'm happy they're not spending 100% of their time on the floor, drenched in sweat and standing on their feet for 6+ hours at a time like I used to do.

The other managers don't seem to like this. ""When I was in their role, I didn't get to have a break!"" is a common sentiment. Back then, retention was horrendous. We'd have new people starting every other week to compensate for leavers. Now, we go months between hires because people are sticking around. The job still isn't amazing, but the staff can at least relax throughout the day and I think that makes them more inclined to stick around. 

I guess my question is, how do I present this situation as a positive to the other managers? Yes it looks like the staff are not working temporarily but they finish all the work on time. It's not like clients/customers can see them sitting around either, so it's only the perspective of management here. One last thing to note is that the staff are paid hourly, so yes they're paid partially to not do anything when these breaks come up, but they have to remain on site anyways for the work later in the day that can't be done early so I consider this a non-issue- we're paying them hourly to be on retainer for the work that needs to be done during their scheduled shift.",7,1728833840.0,managers,13,1.0,False

 for context ryan is my boyfriend and all the other names that r mentioned are his friends.

honestly i am more confused then mad because everything he said is very much not true and me and my boyfriend are confused about all of it.

my boyfriends friends are always hanging out with him and i so i don’t know why he’s saying that my boyfriend has not been invited to anything. it’s actually the fact that NICK (the friend) has not been there when we hangout with the other friends.

ALSO grey and him are not on speaking terms because grey and i hung out one on one and tried to convince me to breakup with him and said nasty things about him! so i called grey out on it and grey is now apparently spreading a different story.

also the tinder thing makes me so mad because 1 if u “saw” that why wouldn’t u call me out on it?
and 2 i deleted tinder after me and my boyfriends first date because i was so happy with him. i have snapchat+ and have changed the icon to be a pinkish-red color that kinda looks like the color of the tinder logo, so i’m thinking that’s what he must have seen.

All of this being said......since the screeners are being used incorrectly, it is going to take time for the researchers and Prolific to have a meeting of their minds on how the tools works....until then, we will continue to be screened-out improperly and just have to sit and wait (up to 22 days) for them to figure out where they went wrong and then they will figure out what to do next!

Three years ago I agreed for a sitter to watch our cats for a week. He didn't have many (or any? I can't recall) reviews, but the profile seemed ok, the application letter seemed good, and the video chat went well. I also like to give ""new sitters"" a chance if there aren't any bad vibes. 

After some good communication regarding arrival times, etc, ""Franz"" showed up at the apartment. He was a free lance journalist for a media outlet and was going to be working from the apartment. Sure, no problem, and not the first time someone was going to work-while-sitting! 

The sit itself seemed to go ok. He had asked if there was a bicycle to borrow, which I agreed to. My friend informed me that he contacted her, saying that he had locked himself out of the apartment. That was a first! Which is good it doesn't happen, because she lives an hour away by transit so it wasn't just a quick ""walk around the block"" to let him in. 

At the end of the sit Franz apologized that he couldn't meet up with us again, but he had to leave early to catch his train. Again, no problem: we've had a few sitters where the timing didn't work out at the end of a sit to meet up again. 

When I got home, I found that he done some weird things and left a bit of a mess. The mess was surprising, as he had made a point in his profile that he was a ""neat freak,"" yet there was a dirty coffee cup on counter and dirty utensils were back in drawer. He had unplugged the TV and all of its accessories, and unplugged everything in my ""work from home"" office area. I believe there were some other things, but 3 years dulls the memory.

The bicycle that he borrowed was functional, but a part had been broken off, causing my pant let to catch when I rode it. The tag on the key was missing, which isn't much, but just one more ""thing"" to add to the list. He also drank all of the beer that we had in the apartment. 

In the end, I concede that it was an ""ok"" sit, since the cats were fine and the apartment was still standing. But when he mentioned that he was now going to do a story on THS, it all made sense: He joined and applied for this sit so that he could get the scoop on what it was really like. Getting locked out of the apartment was undoubtedly just his way of testing the system, and the article (which I found later), made fun of the state of my pantry, and what it was like to take care of the cats and what the process of house sitting was like. 

He has since cancelled his membership - I guess that his research is complete. :)",7,1728833246.0,trustedhousesitters,3,1.0,False

**1. DIY Lanterns**

* Hack: Fill a water jug with water and place a headlamp around it, with the light facing inward. This creates a makeshift lantern that diffuses light effectively.
* Benefit: Provides ambient light without using a lot of battery power.

**2. Campsite Firestarter**

* Hack: Use cotton balls soaked in petroleum jelly as fire starters. Store them in a waterproof container.
* Benefit: They ignite easily and burn for a longer time, making it easier to start a fire.

**3. Towel Alternatives**

* Hack: Instead of bulky towels, use microfiber towels, which are lightweight, compact, and dry quickly.
* Benefit: Saves space and weight in your pack.

**4. Instant Seat**

* Hack: Bring a foldable sitting pad or use a foam sleeping pad as a lightweight seat when you need a break.
* Benefit: Provides comfort and insulation from the ground.

**5. Cooking with Foil Packs**

* Hack: Pre-prepare meals in aluminum foil packets (like veggies and protein) and cook them over the fire or grill.
* Benefit: Easy cleanup and no pots needed!

**6. Trash Management**

* Hack: Use a mesh laundry bag as a trash bag. It’s lightweight, allows for airflow, and can be easily hung from a tree or tent.
* Benefit: Keeps your campsite tidy and prevents attracting animals.

**7. Emergency Drying Line**

* Hack: Pack a length of paracord in your gear. You can use it as a clothesline to dry wet gear or clothing.
* Benefit: Keeps your gear dry and organized.

**8. Keep Food Fresh**

* Hack: Use a small cooler with ice packs to keep perishables fresh longer. Wrap items in newspaper to add insulation.
* Benefit: Reduces food waste and keeps items cool.

**9. Portable Phone Charger**

* Hack: Bring a solar-powered charger to keep your devices charged without relying on electricity.
* Benefit: Ensures you can keep in touch and access maps or emergency contacts.

**10. Lightweight Campfire Grill**

* Hack: Use a grill grate that can be laid over the campfire to cook food directly over the flames.
* Benefit: Allows for easy cooking without bringing bulky equipment.

**11. Map and Compass Use**

* Hack: Use your smartphone as a compass by downloading a compass app. Alternatively, familiarize yourself with traditional navigation.
* Benefit: Ensures you don’t get lost, even without GPS.

**12. Repurpose Old Gear**

* Hack: Use an old pillowcase to store dirty clothes or gear, keeping them separate from clean items in your pack.
* Benefit: Helps with organization and cleanliness.

**13. No-Spray Bug Repellent**

* Hack: Create a natural bug repellent using essential oils (like citronella, lavender, or tea tree) mixed with water in a spray bottle.
* Benefit: Keeps bugs away without harsh chemicals.

**14. Camping Coffee**

* Hack: Make a DIY coffee filter by using a bandana or cheesecloth, secured over a cup with a rubber band.
* Benefit: Brew fresh coffee without carrying bulky equipment.

**15. Essential Oils for Relaxation**

* Hack: Bring essential oils like lavender or chamomile to use in a diffuser or in your tent for relaxation.
* Benefit: Helps create a calming atmosphere for a good night’s sleep.

Nervous because, you know, talking to people is hard. I get up to pay and get my coffee. The girl is super sweet, I'm instantly in love. I notice a little something on her face near the corner of her mouth like milk or unblended makeup. I think “Omg! There's like a thousand people in this line! I better tell her so she can wipe it off and not be so embarrassed hours later when she finds it! I would want someone to do the same for me!"" So my impulsive mouth opens up and out come the words

""Oh, girl, you've got a little someth...."" and gesture to my lip. 

As the sound of my own words entered my ears I realized that's not a smudge it's a ***SCAR!!!!*** I just pointed out this girl's facial scar. I'm a fucking MONSTER!!!!!!

I apologized profusely.

Of course she was super sweet and and said it was ok, that people make that mistake all the time (which made me feel even worse).

And then I immediately told her the embarrassing story about the time I got incredibly drunk and fell out of a chair and busted up my lip and it scarred. Like that would make her feel better? 

She laughed and told me how she got it. (An accident with a dog when she was little)

Yall, I feel like shit.

And since driving away I've thought of 437 things I should have said.

I was trying to be nice, trying to help a girl out. And it was (I thought) within the 5 second rule of if you notice something that somebody can't fix in 5 seconds just don't mention it.

Well, that settles it. I'm never talking to strangers or leaving the house again.

I've been struggling with gastritis since I was about 12, and seemingly long mono before that. I dont remember  waking up feeling refreshed  past about age 7.

After dealing with mono and covid last year and not fully recovering, I don't always have the energy to stay upright and it gets to the point of physical pain. I work from my bed. I wake up in the morning and want to go right back to sleep because I'm still tired (in case anyone was wondering, no, being tired for most of your life doesn't actually reduce the urge to try to ""sleep it off."" Womp womp).

With that and the adhd and the depression from losing the functionality of my body (I'm in my twenties!!!!) after being a very active person, life is. Hard. And yeah I'm on medication which helps, but one of the few things which makes the most immediate and impactful differences is coffee. It also functions as a mood stabilizer for ADHD individuals like me.

I keep trying to stay on the straight and narrow or at least mannging it, but with what seems to now be a chronic illness, and I don't even like cooking (and EVERYTHING premade has triggers in it) , and coffee is SO central to me even feeling human these days, it feels like I'm never going to end up making it.

The coffee unfortunately helps with the motivation and physical energy to cook.

I try to stay away from most other triggers (because honestly, I'm not really missing the tomatoes and peppers and onions that much anyway), but coffee is just..idk. And while my symptoms aren't really awful (nausea and I need to stay upright after eating), the coffee I feel as physical stomach pain sometimes.

I've been lurking around the coffee and caffeine alternative topics on this sub for a while but it just does not seem like there is a substitute. I'll probably end up looking into the low acid coffees but also those are expensive and part of me is just not able to overcome ""but WHY do I have to do this???""

Sigh. This sucks. I know caffeine makes all of us feel better in degrees, but if you're also struggling or using it to supplement lost functionality of your body and brain due to long covid or other physical or mental disability, I'm so sorry.

We’ve never really had issues with sharing responsibilities. He is not a man who has ever acted like a woman should do all the housework and I’m not a woman who thinks a man should do all the yard work etc. for the last year our shared responsibilities kind of go like this… I do the laundry he cooks and washes dishes. We grocery shop together and put them away together. I will cut the grass on the zero turn and he weed eats and blows the yard off. I do a deep clean of our house on Saturdays but he will clean up the garage or help me with folding laundry while i do that. He has always been very sweet to me and goes out of his way to do things for me like breakfast in bed. Makes me coffee every morning etc. we have had a dog (1F Yorkie) the first year of our marriage and decided to get another around our first dogs 1 year birthdate. The new puppy is also a yorkie. Unfortunately when we got her our first dog started going through her 1st heat (we haven’t fixed her yet due to our concerns about putting her through surgery). She has bled and peed all over the house a dog that before was potty trained. The new puppy is also peeing all over the house. This has been going on for the last month. We’re both trying to train the puppy and retrain our older dog but it’s been so frustrating. I constantly pick up poop or step in pee. I feel like all I do is clean up after the dogs. On top of that my husband in the last month has just stopped helping me with house work. The yard is a mess, the house is a mess, laundry is backed up. I feel like I now have all the responsibility and it’s wearing me out. The only thing he has continued to do is cook but he leaves a disaster in the kitchen and then just ignores it. His closet is a disaster and has made no effort in the last two weeks to clean it up. He seriously isn’t even helping with the trash. I can understand going through a low energy period and not helping as much (I experience seasonal depression during Feb/march) so I understand not feeling like you can help out and in the past we both just pick up each others slack but I’m just feeling really overwhelmed for the first time in our marriage. I do nothing but clean up after him now and on top of that two dogs one in heat and one who is 10 weeks old. I don’t want to attack him and I want to be understanding but I’m becoming really frustrated. We also just went through hurricane helene which has caused a lot of yard work and he hasn’t done anything to clean up the yard. We both work 40 hours a week. We also split bills and groceries. I make a little more money than he does so I don’t bother me to help as much as he does financially. He also missed a week of work due to the hurricane and therefore wasn’t able to contribute to the household for two weeks. I feel like I’m the only one keeping up with our responsibilities.

Despite trying to be patient and trying to connect, I feel repetitively hurt by his actions and unreciprocated efforts. Seeking advice on how to deal with this situation as we plan on seeing each other next weekend.

Hey Reddit,

My bf (M/29) and I (F/30) transitioned to a LDR 5 weeks ago, after being together for 1.5 years. Before the distance, we were really confident in our relationship. I have anxious-avoidant attachment style (& big fear of abandonment) and his is secure. He's been amazing at helping me open up, trust & communicate more, making me feel safe and like I'm with the right person.

Some context: he's a foreigner living in my country, and I've supported him in a lot of ways - like when he had an accident and I took care of him in the hospital which brought us closer, supporting him financially when he was in struggling (I was the one offering and never the other way around). I was the one who encouraged him to move to the other city as I knew there'd be more opportunities for him to grow and not feel stuck here. He moved in with me for the last month to be able to save up a bit before relocating. When we lived in the same city, we spent a lot of time together, he didn't have that many friends and would mainly just work, go to the gym, see a few friends for coffee sometime and mainly spend time with me, and I really felt like an important part of his life.

Now in LD, the dynamic has changed and I feel like I'm not a priority anymore. Some specific things that have accumulated until now:

* the first week: he's been adjusting to a new city, new job, meeting new interesting people & artists (in his field of work), attending so many social events, partying every weekend, while I've felt a bit overwhelmed by the shift, not keeping up and feeling like we're not part of each other's lives as much, and like I can barely fit into his busy schedule.
* he suggested a call on a day, only to then cancel because of work party for him, which I understand was not personal but it still made me feel like I'm not as important.
* the 2nd week we decided to call each other whenever we feel like it, despite being out socially, even for just 5 minutes for a quick update/hear each other's voice (which was a compromise on my part, as I prefer to have long talks when we're both home alone).  He called me while in a taxi with his friends, as they were going from bar A to bar B and I felt like an afterthought because I had to repeat myself several times when sharing something important, and it made me believe he's only calling me during this buffer time when he doesn't have anything else better to do. I communicated vulnerably via a 3min voice note to him how that made me feel, and he replied the next morning in 10 seconds voice note that ""he gets it, and that he'll be more mindful next time"".
* I felt very low and depressed, when he was at his highest (stimulated at work, feeling happy with many opportunities and being social) and these completely different frequencies made me feel so lonely. He then felt like I wasn't happy for his achievements and struggled to understand why I can't be the supportive gf I've always been. I told him I lack emotional & meaningful depth in our conversations which comes from lack of engagement from his side: he constantly asks me about my day in a very robotic and transactional manner, but when I do share whether via a voice note or during a call, he doesn't have any follow up questions and doesn't show any kind of engagement/curiosity.
* the 3rd week we decided to send each other photo updates to feel more involved in each others' lives, I finally felt connected again and like I'm having my bf back as he's made visible effort for quality calls.
* by the end of 3rd week, we had a big fight as I felt disrespected when he ignored me on a videocall while dealing with a buyer for his bike. I was calling out to him, and he just let me shout his name 5 times making me feel foolish in front of the buyer, just because a friend was talking to him. I communicated this frustration of feeling unimportant again, especially when I'm helping him out, and that triggered him, as he felt like I was unfairly blaming him for something out of his control (which I wasn't, I was blaming him for deciding to ignore me instead of telling me to wait 3 seconds so he could tell that friend that he's on a call).

I feel like we make 1 step forward and 3 steps back. I reached a point where I truly believe that he doesn't care about me as much, and the slightest action from his side could trigger me, making me feel that I don't matter anymore. We both have built resentment over the past month and are feeling disconnected: me because of the  accumulation of disappointments and feeling undervalued, and him because he'd asked me to be patient in this transitional period and he doesn't feel like I'm making enough effort, that i'm being too demanding instead, and because I had asked for some space (I felt too emotionally exhausted). It's not helping that every time there's a glimpse of hope as we both make effort, it seems like the universe is against us (e.g. we scheduled a call on Wed, and something happens that day that makes it impossible)

Things are so bad that we're not even excited to see each other next weekend, but feeling anxious and scared of the outcome instead, because all this unresolved conflict makes us stuck in a negative loop of doubting this relationship. I really want to clear the air, move past this so we can feel connected again and enjoy our time together. I need advice on how to do that. Am I being too needy?

I didn’t think he would ever want to meet me because I was clear about my situation. I said I wanted to take things slow. Endhuko, manam “friends” laga undhamu annadu. Numbers exchange cheskunamu. I deleted the apps. He told me his is also a divorce case. We met for coffee, and then went for a movie. This was in the span of 3 weeks last year. We had this joke that we were both awkward shy types, and I asked if he was comfortable around me now. He said that he was but made sure to tell me “nenu ippudu relationship ki ready kaadu, I am only looking for casual platonic friendship, you are on the same page kadha”.

I don’t think he likes me in a romantic way. We’ve talked about being happy in another relationship again, but that’s never with each other. Yes, part of this is my fault, and I have also been playing into the friend zone and never directly saying anything.

Hi all, I recently got a Breville Barista Express and set it up this weekend. I spent probably 4-5 hours yesterday tinkering around, trying to get this thing to pour a shot of espresso, but have run into the same issue with every single pour.

No matter how course the grounds, or how loosely packed the grounds are, the portafilter cannot get the water through the bottom of the basket. Every time it spills over the sides, and I have to take everything apart and clean it again, to try a new solution that I found online, only for it to happen again. I spent $700 on this thing and can’t find any troubleshooting guides online that seem to have this same issue.

To me, it seems like there’s not a seal being created between the filter and the group head, so the liquid isn’t being forced through. As a result, it bleeds through the sides and then when I remove the filter, grounds and coffee goes everywhere. Is this a manufacturer problem, and I need to get a hold of Breville? Or is there something I’m genuinely missing here?

We’ve been friends for years, and whenever we go out whether it’s for dinner, drinks, or even just coffee I've always covered his share. At first, I thought it was just a phase, but it’s become a pattern.

I didn’t mind too much; I love treating friends, and I figured we all go through tough times. But over the years, it became clear that Jake wasn’t making much effort to contribute. He would always come up with the same excuses: “I’ll pay you back next time!” or “I left my wallet at home”

After countless outings where I ended up footing the bill, I finally snapped. I realized I was basically funding his social life. It felt unfair, especially when I would see him buying new gadgets or going on trips that I could barely afford myself.

So, I made a decision: the next time we went out, I would let him know I couldn’t keep paying for him. I braced myself for the fallout.

When the day came, I casually suggested we go to our favorite bar. When the bill arrived, I calmly said, “Hey, do you want to split this?” His face dropped. He looked shocked, then angry, saying, “Come on, don’t be like that! You always pay”

I tried to explain that I needed to set some boundaries, but he turned defensive. He accused me of being selfish and not being a real friend. The tension was strong, and I ended up feeling guilty for sticking up for myself. He stormed out, and now he’s refusing to talk to me.

Now, I’m left wondering: did I do the right thing? Should I have kept paying to maintain the friendship, or is it reasonable to expect him to contribute? Am I the bad friend here?",1,1728831909.0,AITAH,8,1.0,False

How can i move forward?,"TL;DR GF(25) sent a photo of herself with lingerie to another dude, blamed me(28) for it because I didn't give her enough attention and love. She wants space and time to think about us.


So, the start of our relationship (5-6 months) was under bad circumstances. We met through mutual friends, and vibed with each other for our love for cars and motor racing. She was in a 5 year relationship and they were living together, I was single, going through a break up. We saw each other when the whole friend group met, and our interactions were pretty minimal. At some point, we made plans for her to tattoo me, since she is a tattoo artist. When the date of the tattoo session came up, I went to her place, she tattooed me, and after that we went for a drive and talked a bit. She basically told me her whole life story in a span of 1 hour, and her life story is full of hurt and trauma. After that, we went to meet with the rest of the group to do a group drive. At one point we stopped to grab a bite to eat, and she didn't have any money and I insisted to buy her something since I knew she didn't eat anything all day. Right there i saw her eyes light up, and that was it for me. A couple days later we started talking more and more every day. I knew she had a boyfriend (who was just an acquaintance for me), I knew what I was doing wasn't right, but I didn't care. A couple of weeks later we made plans to go out for a drink. The day of, she sent me photos with outfits, and asked me which one I liked better. For me, that was the sign that she liked me as well. Later that night, one thing led to another, with the help of the drinks too, and we had some sexual activities. I got her back home at 7 in the morning, and i went to work right after. Pretty much everyday we talked, I went and hang out to her work place. We spent A LOT of time together. Need I remind you she was in a relationship all this time. Fast forward a couple months, her relationship started crumbling. Her boyfriend gave her a deadline to leave the house, and I was already looking for a place to live near her town. So we took decision to live together. We moved in together, our ""relationship"" a secret to anyone, we were just two friends living together. She and her boyfriend continued to work on their relationship, and that meant that he was coming to hang out in our house. I knew I shouldn't be feeling jealous, but I couldn't help it. Her and I had some serious talks, about what we are, how will we continue, and we both wanted to be with each other. This situation comtinued for 5 more months, and then they both decided together to end it between them. After they ended it, we made it ""official"" between us that we are a couple. From then (5 months ago), till now, both our lives had many obstacles. I had financial issues due to car problems, she didnt have a good salary because of bad employers and pretty much no options, and the house we were living in had many issues, that the home owner blamed us for. We struggled with our mental health during this time, but we pulled through. We went to a different house, she found a better paying job doing what she loves, and everything seemed to be going the right way. The thing is, that the new job she got, she got it through a guy that DM'ed her out of the blue. I told her that ""what he wants is to sleep with you, there is no other reason for a stranger to DM you like that."" She told me that she didnt think that way herself, and nothing will happen. I pulled back and let her do her thing. After starting working there, when they finished their shift, they either went to another shop to work under the table, or they went for coffee. I was seeing her for about 4 hours per day, and they were spending 10-13 hours together. My suspicions were acting up, and I checked her DMs, and i saw that she sent him a picture of herself in lingerie that we bought together, and gave him the right to start hitting on her, and she welcomed it. I confronted her about it, and her excuse was that I wasn't giving her enough attention and love, I wasn't making her feel attractive, and that she wanted to tell me that she needs some space and time to think. I told her that she broke my trust for her, and it would have been better if she just told me to break up. I asked her if she did anythingwith him and she said no. They continue to work together, they continue to spend time after work together, and I'm just sitting at home feeling like a loser. Any time she is out with him, she might take minimum 1 hour to respond to my texts, but when we are hanging out together, she responds pretty much immediately to other texts. She has kept things from me, while I show her that I'm willing to work this out. I'm willing to wait for her until she figures out what she wants, but at the same time we are living together and it is very hard for me. When I see her I want to hug her and kiss her. I want to caress her hair. But I know this might not happen ever again. One side of me knows that the logical thing to do is to ""throw"" her out of the house, but the other side of me hopes that she will come back and show me some respect when I ask and tell her about other dudes. I'm starting to lose my drive to do anything. I cant go on drives with my car, I cant play games with my friends, I cant hang out with anyone.

TLDR: My wife wants something that heats quickly, works solidly. 

We currently have the basic De'Longhi EC680M, which we’ve outgrown. We’re decently into coffee, have a pour over setup, I regularly make variations of cold brew, etc. 

I’ve been weighing options on a new machine, reading reviews, posts, about four differing machines:

• Lelit Mara X PL62X
• Rock APPARTAMENTO 
• Ascaso Steel Uno PID (have looked at the Duo as well) 
• Breville Barista Express (also looked at the Dual Broiler, as well)

The main things we’re looking for is:
• Quicker warm up - I know the Lelit can take as much as 30 mins. My wife much prefers a quick start up. 
• Ideally, no 20A power/circuit (110V) would be nice because we only have standard 15A in the kitchen. 
• My wife does make lattes most of the time, so a dual broiler feels like a nice to have, but not a requirement for us. 
• She really likes the aesthetics of the Lelit, but fears the startup time being too long. 

We do want something that:
• Is more on the ‘prosumer’ side (IE, we’re not looking at a Marzoco or Slayer or anything of that level). 
• I’d like something reliable: we’ve taken apart the De’Longhi before, so we’re use to that, but definitely don’t want it to break on month 2. 
• Consistent/quality shots. 

My thought is that the Breville would do that for us at a decent price range. Is it worth getting the Breville then later growing into something else? Is the Lelit worth it despite its warm up times? Is the Ascaso solid, I see listings about long term quality issues? 

Thank you all greatly! ",2,1728831635.0,espresso,2,1.0,False
1g2rk5o,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships_advice/comments/1g2rk5o/more_than_a_friendship/,More than a friendship?,"Hi everyone, I'm new here and I hope there will be someone patient enough to read the whole thread because I need a second opinion and I have nobody I can talk to about this. I'm going crazy and have to pretend I'm fine but I'm feeling really bad lately, as well as confused.

I'm a married lady in my early 40s. From the outside you could say I have everything: great job, great family, no financial issues, I've traveled all over the world and lived so many experiences not everyone can live, I don't look bad for my age (this is such a lame comment but at my age it matters), I'm healthy and have no serious problems in life except this one I'm posting about.

8 years ago I switched jobs and started working for this new, big corporation where I met lots of interesting people. The first year I got close to a guy that is a bit younger than me (5 years), single and really career focused. Besides, he is a great team mate and loves to help other people. We shared some strong common interests and we started hanging out at work together with a group of 3 people (meaning that we were always in a group). As time went by, we started to get closer and he started treating me in a different way, different from the way he treated the other coworkers. It was barely noticeable at first, he would ask me about my day and if I mentioned some issue at work, he would solve it for me without even asking him or he would make sure someone else would help me. He started to write me after work if he saw something or traveled somewhere and remembered about me (food we both love, a place we both liked, etc). But it still felt like a good work relationship and nothing else.

Things got ""heavier"" a year and a half ago. I noticed he would call only me for lunch, or for a coffee, and we started to talk in a separate work chat, just the two of us. He was always polite and appropriate and NEVER ever hinted at any kind of feelings from his side (just to be clear). It just felt that the friendship was becoming closer and we started having lunch alone. I noticed other people started avoiding us for lunch and left us alone in our corner in the office's kitchen. My friend started to open up and tell me about his concerns at work, private life, travels, things he didn't share with anyone else in the office and told me in confidence. I really enjoyed our lunches and found myself looking forward to our daily lunch and the hour we spent chatting.

A few months ago I noticed he would look upset if someone else approached us or joined us for lunch, our private conversations in the work chat increased and he sometimes wrote me during the weekends too. People around us started to comment or ask me why are we all the time together and things like that, so it was obvious to other people that we were very close. He has helped me a lot at work and done things for me that nobody else did, things that shocked some of our coworkers (asking a manager to promote me, for instance), and if I am absent or sick or work from home, he always asks me twice a day if I'm feeling better, etc... it feels like we need to talk every day, even if it's a short message.

Last week we had a work trip that involved the whole office, we went to a mountain resort for 3 days. He belongs to another department and there were activities for each team so I expected that I wouldn't see him at all since our schedules were different but he ended up joining my lunch table, inviting me on a drink after lunch and approaching me every chance he got.

It's important to mention we never met outside the office hours. And I say it's important because I have developed feelings for him and I didn't want to cross that line. I feel awful for having those feelings and I can't help wondering, are they reciprocated? Is his behaviour unusual or is it just me projecting and I am delusional?

It is important for me because I don't like sitting in silence next to the other parent because we have nothing in common besides being parents. I am also tired of meeting people who never show up with what they need for a playdate, like a simple snack or water for their child. I love helping, but when it becomes a pattern, it gets old. I have my own child to look after, I'm not here to be a community pantry. And being a single parent isn't necessary, but to be able to understand me on that level would be nice. I can't relate to ""we're gonna head home now. The husband is cooking dinner, and he's waiting for us."" Or ""We're taking a family vacation to Jamaica."" I just feel like I never mesh with anyone. I am introverted, I don't watch series or dating shows, I don't like drama, I don't drink coffee or go to spin class. Blah blah.

At first i wanted to get a superauto as it seems super convenient, you click a button you have a coffee. But later i realised that it might not deliver a tasty espresso(creamy and a hint of sweetness, thats my goal).

I have never made an espresso in my life and those machines seems to be a bit intimidating. It seems there is no machine that you can just go and make an espresso.

Machines i have my eye on:  
**Gaggia Classic Evo Pro(alu boiler) + Gaggia MDF55**(or different grinder) **(800eu)** but you need OPV mod at minimum and probably PID(or gaggiuino mod all together) which is not great for starters

**Gaggia Classic Evo Pro(alu boiler) + Nuova Simonelli** **615eur**

**Nuova Simonelli Oscar II + Sage Smart Grinder Pro(used) 600eur** (could be cheaper as its private sale) and upgrade grinder in a future. Problem i read about Oscar is that it is difficult to maintain it. Simple thing as descaling is complicated. Seems best value but im afraid to get machine that will be too complicated to maintain.

**Sage Dual Boiler + Sage Smart Grinder Pro(1100-1250eur)** (and upgrade grinder in the future) but needs OPV mod as well. (This one seems like a best option from what i read from reviews!)

**Rocket Appartamento+Kompac K3 (1200eur) (used but in my price range)** seems need OPV as well and too complicated for beginner(please correct me if im wrong)

**The Pavoni Mini Cellini Classic + Eureka Mignon (1200-1250eur)** seems not beginner friendly but more like a machine to grow in to.

**Sage Bambino Plus +Eureka Mignon**(or any different grinder in sub 400eur category) **(900-1000eur)** it seems what people start off but dont want to spend money just to upgrade a year later and consider as money wasted.

Please help me out to decide or suggest what else can i get as a beginner to get a lovely espresso and odd time a milky drink(or we can ignore milky drinks all together if that helps)",1,1728831225.0,espresso,3,1.0,False

1g2re0p,https://www.reddit.com/r/ussr/comments/1g2re0p/siege_of_leningrad_the_diary_of_nikolai_ribkovsky/,Siege of Leningrad: The diary of Nikolai Ribkovsky,"In the September of 1941 the german forces have completely surrounded the city of Leningrad. The initial german plan was to allow the civilian population to move from the city to the soviet territory after the city will surrender (Army Group North combat log, October 12, 1941). Soviets refused to do so, thus allowing more than 600.000 of people to patriotically starve to death. Fortunately, not all people suffered equally: soviet bueraucrats were the lucky ones.



I decided to translate the most juicy parts of the diary, which belongs to the low-ranking soviet bureaucrat Nikolai Ribkovsky, who successfully survived the siege. This diary was partially (for a reason) published in the USSR in 1975.



November 7, 1941: <...> And every time I listened to every word with bated breath. How simply, understandably, briefly and clearly Comrade Stalin answered the exciting question: what are the reasons for the temporary failures of our army.

November 17, 1941: If i wont stop being unemployed, im lost (he will be appointed as the instructor of the district party committee in December 5).

November 20, 1941: (Commenting on the reduction of the bread ration for the unemployed to 1/8 kg per day) It's difficult. That's true. There was a time when i lived on “octets” (1/8 kg) of bread, and there were also times when I not only didn’t eat, but didn’t even see bread for weeks.

November 29, 1941: <...> they say that some people were eating cats.

December 9, 1941: Now I don’t feel any particular need for food. In the morning i eat noodles, or porridge with butter and two glasses of sweet tea. In the afternoon, lunch - first soup, second meat every day. Yesterday, for example, I ate green cabbage soup with sour cream for the first course, a cutlet with noodles for the second, and today for the first course i ate soup with noodles, and for the second course - pork with stewed cabbage. The quality of lunch in the Smolny (headquaters of the Communist Party in Leningrad) canteen is much better than in the canteens in which I had to dine during the period of unemployment.

February 23, 1942: <...> In the meeting after the report, we were shown seven episodes of the film chronicle “In Defense of Moscow” and the musical film comedy “They met in Moscow”. <...> After watching this film everyone will say: “For the sake of such a life, a life full of creative work, joy and happiness, i will not only tighten my belt even tighter, strain my strength even more, but, if necessary, ill sacrifice my life.""

March 5, 1942: I have been in the hospital of the municipal party committee for three days now. In my opinion, this is simply a resort <...> Eyewitnesses say that Sergei Mironovich Kirov hunted here when he came to rest. <...> The food here is like in peacetime in a good resort: varied, tasty, high-quality, delicious. Every day there is meat - lamb, ham, chicken, goose, turkey, sausage; fish - bream, herring, smelt, fried and boiled and jellied. Caviar, smoked meat, cheese, pies, cocoa, coffee, tea, three hundred grams of white and the same amount of black bread per day, thirty grams of butter and on top of all this fifty grams of grape wine for lunch and dinner. You order food the day before according to your taste. Me and two other comrades get an additional breakfast between the first breakfast and lunch: a couple of sandwiches or a bun and a glass of sweet tea. <...> The vacation here is magnificent - in all respects. The war is almost not felt. Only the distant noise reminds me of it, although the front is only a few dozen kilometers away. **Yes. Such a vacation, in conditions of the front and a long blockade of the city, is possible only for the Bolsheviks, only under the Soviet government.**

She arrived unannounced and is staying at an Airbnb. Normally, she stays with us, which I’m totally fine with—I even encourage it. However, what bothers me a little is that when her friend is here, they tend to spend all their time together . She usually stays for at least a week, and during that time, they go out for dinners, clubs, etc., leaving me either alone or feeling like a third wheel. 

I don’t mind this too much since I’m introverted, but it can get inconvenient, especially when I don’t always feel like joining in or playing host. Also, for the entire week her friend visits (or any other friend), I barely see my girlfriend.

Here’s the rundown of this week so far:

	•	Day 1: My girlfriend stayed over at her friend’s Airbnb to catch up, so I didn’t see her.
	•	Day 2: They spent the whole day together.
	•	Day 3: My girlfriend and I went out for dinner, but that only happened because her friend had another visitor (who my girlfriend doesn’t really like). We had to cut the night short anyway because she was having really bad period pains.

Today, around 11:30 a.m., her friend showed up at our place just as I was about to have coffee and something to eat. I was in my underwear and looking forward to a relaxed Sunday at home, maybe catching up on some work. My girlfriend didn’t give me any heads-up that her friend was coming over. She just casually said, “Oh, my friend is here,” and laughed, saying she forgot to tell me.

I was visibly annoyed and ended up leaving the house, telling her I was going out to watch a football game. She could tell something was up, though. I didn’t want to make a scene in front of her friend, who I actually like, but I feel like my needs are often neglected whenever she has friends over or visiting.

Could I have handled this better? I didn’t want to cause a fuss, but I feel disrespected when my girlfriend doesn’t consider me in these situations.",3,1728830559.0,AITA_Relationships,6,1.0,False

1g2r1b3,https://www.reddit.com/r/indiasocial/comments/1g2r1b3/close_call_friday/,Close Call Friday!,"Damn ! Last Friday was something !

I was working in a different city last Friday . It was very busy in office and I lost track of time. I had a flight back on 7.30pm and the boarding starts around 6.40. There is a 2 hr travel time from the office to the airport, plus there was road maintenance going on so it would take more time. So in order to reach airport by atleast 6 o'clock I need to start by 3 o'clock to be safe . But , since I lost track of time, I fuc\*ed up. It was 3.45 by when I realised I am late. So I picked my stuff and ran to the front gate. The company campus is huge , i had to run for 10min straight to reach the front gate. There was some formalities I had to complete at the front gate which took even more time. By the time the security arranged me a cab , it was 4.00 .

I was anxious as f\*ck. I thought to myself , "" I am not going to reach the airport on time"" . Since the flight was booked by my company, I will have to give explanation to why I missed the flight and it is a tiresome process . I really don't want to go through it. So I told the driver that 6.40 is the boarding time and I have to reach airport by at least 6.15 to clear security. The driver said that it's a long shot but he will try.

So I entered the cab and put in my earphone and played some music and fell asleep. When I woke up , I was at the departure of the airport and the time was 6.25 and there was a bigger problem. My phone died. I had not taken the printout of by boarding pass as I was trying to use Digi Yatra to get through airport security.

So I asked the driver, can I charge my phone in the car for some time , we can go out and come back in afterwards, he agreed. We went out , it took 10 mins to charge my phone to about 8%, I switch on my phone . And kept the Digi Yatra app open. We went back into the airport departure. It was 6.40 already!! ""I am going to miss my flight , damn it"" I thought.

So I went to the airport security, thankfully the Digi Yatra face ID worked ( it was not working when I tried it last time ) , and the crowd in the airport was relatively less so thankfully I got through, or so I thought. My bag got caught in the screening. It was 6.55 . So I went to the cisf personal. I had to explain to him what I was carrying, show in the DC and invoice and get my bag back. And by the time I cleared security, it was 7.00.

Now , this airport is huge and my gate was on the other end of the airport. I cannot run, as i will for sure crash into someone or something as the gate regions were all crowded. All those brisk walks I took from the bus stop to my home came in handy and I walked as fast as I can. And I reached the gate , it was 7.10. Fortunately, the flight was late and they were just starting boarding. I was in zone 1 and they were starting boarding with zone 3 passengers . I was relieved, I did not miss the flight. I very dearly wanted some caffeine, it was a very tiring day. I got some coffee from the nearest coffee booth I saw and as I got back , I saw the line for boarding was short , most people already boarded the flight. I went and joined the end of the line.

Flying never suited me. I get this terrible headache when the flight lands or takes off, but the time consumed by other modes of transport is way too big , so flight was the best option for me to get back. I got back to my room by 10.40, and I went to bed. The next day I woke up by 12.00pm .

I've always been a fan of unadulterated black coffee, especially more of the complex, funky coffees that my local roasters & shops here in Philly offered.

That coffee was always the result of a typical Fetco or other commercial drip machine.  
But then last month I saw the staff at my local shop swirling and timing drips in weird funnels, my interest was piqued and I asked what they were doing and my response was ""ah that's got to be a gimmick, water and beans are water and beans.""

They made me a pour over of my favorite roast and I compared it side by side to the same coffee out of the Fetco...and now I've spent the past month going down the rabbit hole that is pour over.

I'm someone who will eventually expand out into fully turning this into a hobby and trying to experience the spectrum of what it has to offer and have a ton of tools, but for now I just want something that will cover the bulk of what I'm looking for until life settles down.

I'm torn on 1zpresso's k-ultra vs zp6 or going electric between the ode gen 2 or sculptor 078.

The manuals appealed to me for the additional element of being hands on with the brew. I've got a 2 year old and a 3 week old and I spend 60 hours a week doing telemedicine & therapy as a psych NP. I have practically no 'me time' in my day to day life and there's just something that seems so therapeutic about the grind, dialing in the pour, and just enjoying the quiet of the morning in a quality cup of coffee before the chaos starts.

But then I read all about the distinct differences of the various manual grinders: clarity vs bold and muddy, high acidity vs more tame brews, tea-like vs bold and complex. This got me thinking, is there a more well-rounded electrical grinder with a good range that will cover the bulk of my needs. Most of my reading and price point brought me to the Ode Gen 2 and the Timemore Sculptor 078 - but then I see the same ""this is better for that, that is better for this"".

I'm looking to do almost all pour over and some aeropress, not really anything else.  
I'm not currently in one camp or the other, I like pours yielding high clarity and really pulling the notes like a good wine or bourbon but then I also like thick mouthfeel complex dark roasts on occasion. With that, is there an ideal 1zpresso or one of the above two grinders that checks most of the boxes for what I'm looking for?

**TL;DR**

* New to pour over.
* Grinding almost exclusively for pour over or aeropress.
* Fan of clarity and distinct fruit and florals, but also like a good med/dark that can be full bodied and muddy here and there.
* Never really going to be making coffee on-the-go or outdoors or anything like that, if traveling I'd at most grab some local beans grounded in-shop and throw it in an aeropress at the hotel.
* Manual? K-Ultra? ZP6?
* Electric? Ode Gen 2 (stock or upgraded?) Timemore 078?

I searched, read everything applicable, but figured I'd make my own post with a few specifics.

One side will be a coffee/tea station, and the other will primarily be a desk space. The whole length is about 11'-6"" and will have walls on 3 sides. Depth is limited, due to an pass through in the room, so the counter will only be 22"" deep.

1. Should we look for a slab that runs the whole 11'-6"" length, or do I get 2 shorter ones and join them together?

2. Given it's uses, what sort of finish should I be looking to do? I was thinking of getting the counter pre finished from whatever company I go with.

3. If I do get it pre finished, will I be able to scribe and trim to fit if needed?

Has anyone successfully done anything that helped them start to lose weight faster? I don't eat in the mornings so that I can eat in a calorie deficit, but apparently if you have PCOS you're supposed to eat constantly throughout the day to keep blood sugar stable. Coffee can help increase basal metabolic rate by its thermogenic properties, but if you have PCOS it can be counterproductive because it can increase cortisol which induces insulin resistance. You can only lose weight if you eat in a deficit, but if you eat in a deficit your body starts to retain fat more as it adjusts to eating less. It's so complicated for people with PCOS smh. 

I have lost only 30 pounds in the past 2 years. I'm very happy about it, because I went from \~235 lbs to \~205 lbs, and slow progress is still good progress. But 15 pounds of weight loss a year seems VERY low given my diet and exercise regimen. 

I have a calorie tracking app (Macrofactor) and I love it, it helps me figure out what I need to eat more/less of. Currently, my calorie limit is at 1320. I've been eating around 1500 for a year, I walk 2 miles almost every day, and I do resistance training 2-4 times a week. I know it's not the most rigorous exercise routine, but as a student life gets busy, and I think this is pretty good. I eat mostly whole foods and homemade meals (to the point where if I order out, I get sick eating it). 

I am currently taking metformin (taken it for 3 years), and on ozempic at 1.5 mg (taken it for 2 years). I am very happy because my A1C went from almost diabetic (literally borderline) to being in a healthy range. I haven't seen much weight loss on the ozempic, not as much as people say. Losing 1-2 pounds a month is not crazy weight loss by any means. I think some people may recommend going up a dose but my doctor is really hesitant with increasing doses, and I'm also worried I may see side effects such as gastroparesis. 

I've heard of some people taking berberine, inositol, magnesium, and other supplements. Has anyone experienced weight loss with any of those? At this point I feel like the main variable coming in the way of me losing weight is my metabolism. Any advice helps!",1,1728829539.0,PCOS,1,1.0,False

According to the mom this was “chaos” that the husband was just being willfully blind to. The commenters, both men and women, correctly pointed out that she just seems to be neurotic and that it’s normal for a child to play on the floor and for a father to play a passive observer role while the child does so.

COFFEE (yes that's a good start). Nowadays I consume soooo much coffee because I'm always tired af (sleep deprived because I'm only hyper in the night(I can do tasks in the night). It's gotten to the point my mom is flaming me about it, and arguing with her is really not gonna help.

One experiment I did for a week is 3 days me consuming 2 cups of coffee (3in1 kopiko black) at the same time and another 3 days not drinking some. The results are, you guessed it... or maybe not.

When I drunk the coffee, in tuesday I think, after 45ish minutes while scrolling, my ass just unconciously stopped, thought about having a shower, then picking up my towel. When the towel is in my hand, I realised that my ass just automatically moved to shower itself (which is a good thing, but it's fucking scary, specially because I'm not fully aware that I'm gonna shower).

Another example is in Monday where I got so hyped doing my schoolwork activities I focused on it for 5 hours straight, that I forgot eating. Then came 4pm and my stomach is growling lmao.

Shit hits the fan in the not caffienated days. I never got up, never showered, full on doom scrolling, the dishes didn't get washed, I stank, forgot about some things, and I almost got late from school because my hand unconciously turned off my alarm.

The difference between me is CRAZY. I get so hyped about myself and what to do, while it's full 180 on the other (nasty ass brain I tell you(bro is gonna be my downfall Iif he doesnt shut the hell up).

My caff intake is slowly rising. The 3n1 is becoming sweet for me even tho it's 3n1 black, so I just add more coffee to it, which in turn makes it more bitter but not bitter much, and...yea... rising my caff intake more.

So... how the hell do I stop using coffee. Emphasis on the word USING. And how to function without it.",5,1728829372.0,ADHD,2,1.0,False

Yes, I can get them online, but was wondering if anyone had seen them for sale recently around the neighborhood.

Sex was definitely a big issue in the relationship, as in we really weren’t having it at all towards the end. 

Anyways, after my breakup I naturally have been going through a hoe phase to figure out what I like. It’s been amazing and I love exploring my slutty bottom side. But I also have been having a lot of complicated feelings about love and romance, and have been worrying if I’ll ever be able to find love again or if I’ll always be too in my own head to find it.

But as fall and winter approach this year I’ve noticed a shift in my attitude about this where I can feel my heart opening again. I miss the slow burn and the tension of sex rather than lifeless and abrupt sniffies hookups. I’m so happy and excited to let love and passion into my life again. It’s been a lonely year.

I also think I might still just be preoccupied with sex but in a new way, lol. I’m going on a Hinge date with this guy today and he is SO HOT and muscular. I want to make out with him and watch his dick get hard in his pants. I want him to put his body weight on me. I want him to spoon me while we’re both naked. It’s been a while since I’ve been on a proper date where we’re just getting coffee and talking. Is it bad that I’m already looking forward to the physical part of this? 

Tl;dr my body and I are ready and excited for this new journey of finding a man who can really love me the way I need (and who I can love the way he needs!), fuck I love being gay haha ",0,1728828911.0,askgaybros,1,0.5,False

On the coffee table that I keep my plants I’ve found some tiny mite type bugs. Not sure what these are, but upon further inspection, they seem to be in every crack and crevice. Only started noticing them maybe 1 week or so ago. Is it possible they are from a new soil I repotted some plants with? The video isn’t great, but gives an idea of the size of these things. Any help or advice would be appreciated. 
Are they bad? 
Do I need to throw away the coffee table/ all my plants? I would rather not, as I’ve spent years trying to grow these and keep them alive..

Well, 15 years later I read, that I have to lay on the right side after taking any pills. 💊 next to the coke with the pills, a pharmacist recommended once, that was the best advice ever given. And I cannot believe that the doctors don’t told me, or that it’s written on the medication box. If you have the possibility to lay down, it works for me.

I am staying 3 nights in the accommodation Proud Phu Fah Maerim with 2 kids and my partner.  We plan to stay in Chiang Mai for 6-7 days.  When I check Google maps, Proud Phu Fah seems in reasonable proximity to the attractions I am keen to do. Do you recommend I do 3 days in old town and 3 days in Proud Phu Fah ( I love mountains and nature)? Is old town best area for me? What is good place to see tea plantations and enjoy tea? How about coffee plantations? 

Attractions I am interested in:

1.  Baan Kang Wat + temples

2. Tiger kingdom + insect park 

3. Chiang Dao day trip OR Mon Jam (which has tea plantations/ rice field?)

4. Mae kampong with caves and sankhampaeng hot springs 

5. Thai cooking class

6. Ginger farm 

7. Maerim elephant sancturary  

8. Art/craft/ pottery class

9. Cafe/ restaurants

1g2qj1q,https://www.reddit.com/r/transpositive/comments/1g2qj1q/abigails_sunday_story/,Abigail’s Sunday Story,"In a world where gender fluidity had become the norm, a strange scientific mystery began to unfold in San Clemente, California. Tremors—regular, rhythmic ones—were being detected by seismologists, and no one could figure out what was causing them.

At first, they blamed tectonic activity, but the patterns were too… specific. Every time a prominent figure came out as a trans woman, a tremor would ripple through the region. The number of men embracing their feminine identities had skyrocketed, with celebrities, politicians, and athletes joining the wave. It was as if the seismic activity was synced with the rise of transgender women.

One day, after a particularly strong quake, the world-renowned seismologist Dr. Alice Tremblay burst into the office, wide-eyed and breathless.

“I’ve cracked it!” she shouted. “It’s Ronald Reagan!”

Her colleagues blinked, wondering if she had finally lost it. “What do you mean it’s Ronald Reagan?” asked her assistant.

She pulled up the data. “Every time another man transitions, the tremors intensify. I traced the epicenter directly to Reagan’s grave. He’s… he’s turning in his grave. Repeatedly.”

Suddenly, it all made sense. The 40th president, who once warned of a world gone mad with change, was now the epicenter of a literal political earthquake, unable to rest peacefully as the gender revolution unfolded. Every shake of the earth was like a cosmic “nope” from the beyond.

News of the discovery spread like wildfire. Social media exploded with hashtags like #ReaganRumbles and #ShakeItRonnie. Drag queens started hosting “Shake-a-Reagan” nights, where they would lip sync to ’80s hits in honor of every tremor.

“Someone should tell him heels aren’t that bad!” one person tweeted.

Abigail, sipping coffee one morning with Pam, read an article about it and giggled. “You know, if we keep going at this rate, we’ll probably knock the entire cemetery into the ocean.”

Pam smirked. “Maybe Reagan will finally learn to ride the waves of change.”

It became a global joke. Whenever a new high-profile man came out as trans, news anchors would say, “Well, folks, looks like the Gipper’s got some more rolling to do!”

Eventually, geologists gave the seismic event a name: The Reagan Roll. Scientists warned that if enough people transitioned at once, the entire West Coast could break off from the continental U.S., prompting one popular T-shirt slogan: Trans Rights are Earth-shattering.

And as for Reagan, the rumbling continued. Somewhere, deep beneath the earth, he was probably thinking, “I came here to rest in peace… and these fabulous women won’t let me!”",1,1728828737.0,transpositive,0,1.0,False
1g2qizf,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g2qizf,No need for a Planner Template. Just use the Calendar App,"I see people posting Planner templates here for the Supernote, and I’m just wondering why more people don’t use the built-in calendar app. Everything you need is already there, so there’s no need for a separate template.

You have the monthly view for quick-glance items or things you want to see coming up, like an upcoming concert or a birthday you don’t want to forget. Then, you can go into the larger daily view, where you can list your must-do tasks for the day—things that absolutely need to be completed, like an important phone call or a report you need to send.

You can dive even deeper into the daily schedule, which integrates with Google, allowing you to plan out every hour. I don’t understand the need for any template; I think Supernote has provided everything you need with this device.

Not saying anyone is wrong for wanting or looking for a template, I just want to make sure everyone knows that the essentials are all there. Keep things simple and use that brain power for something that matters more.

Retta, please continue improving the calendar app because this maybe your best feature  and we get a lot of use out of it .Love this device!",15,1728828732.0,Supernote,11,1.0,False
