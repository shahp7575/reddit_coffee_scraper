The back of my teeth are hurting so bad anytime I try and chew. I know that pain is inevitable because my teeth are literally being forced to move in to positions they’ve not been in for the 23 years I’ve been alive, but I’m really starting to wonder if this will even be worth it. On day two I could barely open up my jaw. Had to spend my entire 4pm-12am shift at work in tears from the pain while trying to talk and serve customers. I’m expected to do 27 trays. If all 27 weeks are going to feel this horrible, then I really don’t know if I can do it. I don’t eat with my trays in. Don’t drink coffee. Or sugary drinks. I clean them day and night, don’t allow them out of my mouth for anything but (attempting) to eat.

Jonathan Wells was an ordinary man, with an ordinary routine: coffee at dawn, a three-mile jog through the park, and evenings spent in the comforting embrace of his worn-out armchair, nose buried deep in novels. He found solace in the stories of others; they were adventures he could escape to without leaving the confines of his cozy apartment. One chilly evening, he discovered an unassuming book titled \*The Shadows Within.\*  
  
With its cover a muted blue and its spine cracked from years of neglect, it seemed to beckon him. As he opened the pages, the words pulled him in like a gently flowing river, one that promised intrigue and suspense, much like the countless thrillers he adored.  
  
As he read, a strange sensation crept over him—a familiarity that made him shiver. The protagonist, a man named Jonah, shared not only his name but also his physical traits—broad shoulders, sandy hair, and an affinity for solitude. Yet, it was not merely resemblance that unnerved Jonathan; it was the unfolding plot. Jonah was a writer, lost in his own thoughts, struggling with the mundane life that matched Jonathan’s too closely.  
  
Then came the chilling crescendo. As Jonathan turned each page, he felt the air grow heavy. The story took a darker turn. A killer loomed in the shadows, chasing Jonah through urban alleyways and empty streets. Jonathan's heart raced, every word hitting too close to home. He paused, looking around the dimly lit room. The familiar creak of old pipes echoed through the silence, reminding him of his own solitude.  
  
His thoughts spiraled. Was it mere coincidence? He chuckled nervously, shaking off the unease. After all, thrillers often drew on similar elements. Yet, as each chapter unfolded, strange coincidences began piling up. The next day, during his jog, he spotted a man in a dark hoodie lurking at the park’s edge, watching with an intensity that set his pulse racing.  
  
“This is absurd,” he whispered to himself, convinced it must just be the compelling narrative affecting his perception of the real world. But as the days progressed, the malevolent figure from the novel seemed to materialize in his life.  
  
One evening, after another gripping chapter, Jonathan looked up to find his own reflection in the window—the disheveled hair and paled skin betrayed his mounting fatigue. Was he becoming Jonah? He could not help but feel that the boundaries between fiction and reality were blurring dangerously.  
  
Unable to shake the feeling, he sought refuge with his old friend, Claire, who had always been a pillar of reason in his life. Over coffee, he shared his strange predicament, watching the steam curl into the air. ""You’re overthinking it, Jonathan,"" she said, her brow furrowed in concern. ""It’s just a story. Why let it take hold of you?”  
  
But her words did little to comfort him. That evening, as he returned home, a chill skated down his spine, the shadows stretching long across his hallway. He couldn’t shake the feeling that he was being watched.  
  
Compelled by a mix of curiosity and dread, Jonathan revisited the book, desperate to uncover any clue that would protect him from the fictional danger that felt alarmingly real. As he flipped through the pages, a small note slipped out—scribbled in hurried handwriting: “Find me before it’s too late.”  
  
Sweat gathered at his temples. Had someone else read this book? Or was it part of the story? He felt the weight of the universe pressing down on him, urging him to act. With a resolve that surprised even himself, he decided to explore this path, willing to dive deeper into both the story and its implications for his own life.  
  
Jonathan took to the streets, retracing Jonah’s steps, searching for meaning in each corner of the city. Through the flickering lamplight, he scoured landmarks he recognized from the novel, but the further he went, the more disoriented he became. It was as though the city itself conspired to mislead him.  
  
After hours of wandering, he stumbled upon a narrow alley tucked between two tall buildings. Heart racing, he ventured inside. At the end stood a figure, cloaked in shadows yet radiating an undeniable presence. The air thickened with tension as Jonathan approached cautiously.  
  
“Who are you?” he demanded, his voice trembling.  
  
The figure stepped into the light, revealing a face that mirrored his own. Jonathan gasped, falling back against the alley wall. This was no mere figment of his imagination; it was the killer from the book—the shadow that haunted Jonah now stood in front of him.  
  
“Jonah…” the figure rasped, “You’ve finally come to face me.”  
  
Jonathan’s mind raced. Was this the true manifestation of his fears? As frightening as this experience was, he recognized this was his chance. Drawing on the courage cultivated through countless stories, he confronted the figure. “You’re not real! You’re merely a creation of my mind,” he shouted, hands clenched.  
  
“Am I?” the figure chuckled darkly. “Isn’t every fear, every secret desire rooted in your deepest truths?”  
  
Ensnared in a battle of wills, Jonathan felt the walls of reality shift. With newfound clarity, he spoke, recounting his own history of doubts and mistakes, confronting the shadows that had loomed large in his life. The figure faltered, its edges blurring as Jonathan summoned his resilience, an epiphany igniting within him.  
  
“I refuse to let you dictate my life!” he declared, a roar of defiance echoing through the empty alley.  
  
With that proclamation, the figure shattered like glass, dissipating into the night air. Jonathan stumbled back, panting, the burden of anxiety lifted. He had faced his fears, recognized their hold over him, and conquered them.  
  
Returning home, Jonathan opened \*The Shadows Within\* one last time. The words blurred as he realized they were no longer about him—he had rewritten his own fate. As the final page turned, he marveled at the understanding that life was not just a series of predestined events but a canvas waiting for his brush.  
  
In the quiet solitude of his apartment, Jonathan smiled, knowing that while shadows may linger, he had learned to shine brighter than any darkness.",1,1728979928.0,u_Und3adWarl0ck,0,1.0,False

Avinash called everyone for 4 aloo ke batwaara but says “jo log coffee nahi peete”. Dude, like what the hell, I might not have it regularly but can decide to whenever I want. Ration toh sabka barabar hissa hai.

Like Shilpa was good in repeating what he said to Eisha about 4 log khana bana ke nikal lenge. It was stupid but somehow they let him override and don’t counter him properly. The girls Esha & Ali are not gonna take his side for long because they know he’s not in the right but I’d like someone like Vivian or KV to fight with him. He somehow is scared of Vivian as he never answers him back in the tone as he does with Shehzada or KV too.",3,1728979480.0,biggboss,1,1.0,False

I can have the odd splash of milk in tea or treat myself to a milky mcds frappe but ngl I also don't really like dairy anyway, nevermind the morals of it (I'm not vegan by choice!),but dairy does always seem a bit nasty to me health wise, the growth hormones potentially added, it always gives me acne, makes me feel rough and the majority of my friends, now in their 30s have now one way or another, become lactose intolerant. Plus there is sooo many dairy alternatives in coffee shops and supermarkets. My husband also doesn't really have much dairy, not being a fan of milk or hot drinks like tea or coffee. Just really only has cheese, so we just don't have dairy in the house.
So basically while weaning I've only really given my 10mo for pudding or snack my dairy free yoghurt, or oat milk with porridge etc. (while making sure they've got all the vitamins needed etc) As while she was eating such small amounts, one meal a day with mainly bottles, I didn't want to go put buy whole pots of yoghurt or bottles of milk that won't last because no one else was using them. The only time I've given her dairy is in cheese with mashed potato or a shared a little bit of my ice cream on a day out as a treat. 
With her increasing appetite I thought shed needed something more protein heavy, so gave her a yoghurt pouch I made from normal Greek yoghurt and fruit but that night she had a really upset stomach, which she's never had before. I realised it must be the lactose and how much I've limited lactose dairy in her diet.
I've since avoided dairy again at that quantities, she's still had a small amount of cheese with bread or whatever dairy is in some weaning snacks. I know this isn't an allergy because she doesn't have a reaction to these smaller amounts but I know when she had upset stomach she had two Greek yoghurt pouches over two days. 
Having a restrictive diet myself, I don't want to make her life unnecessarily awkward by meaning she can't have dairy, so should I be encouraging her to have dairy? But also there are so many dairy free options, society does seem to be going that way for when she grows up and she as doesn't have to worry about protein content, I can get any dairy free item she needs really?
Would love to hear thoughts.

Thus, i’ve never kissed or had sex. I come from a home that involved domestic violence. When I was 6, my mom finally left my dad and we began a new more peaceful life together. As I got older, especially when I hit puberty, my mom would come into my room a few nights per week to warn me about boys and how I shouldn’t have a boyfriend until im 18. I knew she was worried I might lose my virginity as a minor and not be able to handle it (mentally/emotionally) if i started dating young like her, (she was 14, my dad 19 when they started dating). 

I know she was way too young for my dad. I am glad now as adults she and I have talked about how messed up that was but also she has told me she has no regrets cause then I wouldn’t have been born. 

Anyway, those talks continued until I turned 18. Then she said it would be better to wait to have a boyfriend until I turned 21 since it would be up to me to break the cycle of young pregnancies in the family (like literally for 6 straight generations, all the women in my family had kids by age 19-20, including my mom, all without ever marrying). 

I obliged but when i turned 21, this time it was my maternal grandmother who came to me telling me how as an actual adult women now I need to be careful and save myself for marriage only, as that is something she regrets not doing.

I think all their trauma dumping on me since I was a kid did a number on me cuz by the time I was 21, I knew how to be super anti social mainly towards men and draw a clear line even though sometimes they were probably being just nice talking to me in class or when sometimes a random guy would ask to buy me a coffee. Like instead of feeling flattered i felt repulsed like they wanted to attack me and always answered in a cold manner. 

I didn’t realize I was intentionally doing an RBF at all social setting except when out with my friends, would literally stop my dating life. i always figured I’d meet someone out and about lol oh man how stupid and naive of me. How, when I was driving them all away? 

I am confessing this here because I am now an adult who struggles to date because I am too scared my ‘future partner’ will undermine or look down on me for having zero experience. I’ve been on dating apps before but I always end up deleting the apps since after a few days, sometimes 2 weeks of chatting, guys always ask about my favorite positions and get graphic with me. Some have more tact than others but when they want to meet or tell me how they can’t wait to hold my hand or spend the night gazing at stars (not even sex), I immediately get sick to my stomach and delete my profile. 

What scares me is that they’ll rush to want to ‘pop my cherry’ once they find out I am a virgin and have zero experience in everything from kissing to holding hands and obviously sex. I think by trying to not disappoint my mom and grandma I ended up disappointing myself since I’ve lived a life filled with other people’s rules and expectations. 

I am also struggling to understand myself and see if maybe my fear of being intimate with a man is the reason I’ve considered dating women instead. I just feel like a woman wouldn’t rush me and would try to be understanding more so than a man. 

Or is my fear of being intimate with a man stem from me being a closeted lesbian? Idk anymore. I mean I have fantasized about having sex with men, (from celebrities to fictional characters) so I know I am attracted to men, and only once have I fantasized about doing it with a woman but didn’t make my heart race or anything.

I wanted to share an unexpected but welcome change I've experienced recently. At 42, I've had dozens of lipomas on my body for years, particularly on my arms. To my surprise, I've noticed a dramatic decrease in their size, with some practically disappearing.

This wasn't my goal when I started, but it's a fantastic side effect. At the beginning of the year, I made some significant lifestyle changes to boost my energy levels for work. Here's what I did:

1. Lost 10 kg through diet changes
2. Drastically reduced carbs, especially fast carbs
3. Started mornings with tea/coffee with butter (plant-based (black cumin or other cold pressed) or dairy). Didn't cut calories from fat.
4. Increased high-quality protein intake (turkey breast, plant proteins, meat, fish)
5. Significantly upped my fiber intake (veggies, herbs, salads, just a little bit of fruits and berries)
6. Improved my microbiome with fiber and fermented foods
7. Worked on increasing my VO2 max through training, including HIIT
8. Started doing hot yoga

I can't pinpoint exactly which of these changes (if any) led to the reduction in my lipomas, but the overall improvement is undeniable.

This experience has reinforced my belief in our body's incredible self-healing abilities. Even if these specific changes don't directly affect lipomas, focusing on overall physical health can lead to significant improvements in other areas.

Has anyone else experienced something similar? I'd love to hear your thoughts or experiences.",3,1728977954.0,Lipoma,1,1.0,False

(Just for fun, what do they do when Adam leave on his trip?)



Jork and Vorts watched as Dream took off and vanished up into the cloudy sky.

“There he goes again,” Jork commented, and Vorts grinned. 

“So now we can work. Okay, let's see that list he left.” He turned from the window, walked back to his desk, and brought up the list on the screen. They were alone in the administration office, and Jork looked up at the screen. Well, that one he can just forget about. “ Vorts agreed, and they deleted it. 

“What about that?” Vorts said, and Jork thought for a moment before he replied

“If we have time, put it last. Oh, and hell no on fifth, not like that, I don’t have time.” 

“Can the droids do it?” Vorts asked, and Jork thought about it. 

“I need to print a new one just for that task. Okay, I hope he never finds out we copied those 3-D printers of his. He better not find out about the warehouse.” Jork said, a little worried.

“You really think he would care so much?” Vorts replied

“Yeah, I think he will care that I helped you build a cave system on Mount Lisha; you know it’s the size of a small city, right? He better not ask where all those twenty droids and equipment went.”  Jork replied. 

“Well, when it's done, I will tell him. I know he wants that shiny new city, but have you seen those specs? Only the rich can afford it. You ever think he will let us live there?” Vorts said, and Jork laughed.

“Yes he would. He would give you a mansion if you ask. You still haven’t figured him out, have you? I know you distrust people in power, but he just wants to do the right things. For all we know, the city he wants to build might be a typical human city. And not a noble village.” Jork countered, and Vorts thought about it. 

“Yeah, you're right. He is not like the nobility, but I still started that project before he even thought about it. What should I do about it? Leave it? “

“We turn it into a factory complex, parts productions, and then we make a worker's city outside. And we base it on the middle-class city. I can have the blueprints ready in a few days.” Jork replied.

“Okay, so what about that ocean-nitrogen project?” Vorts asked, and Jork sighted. 

“Well, it's going to fail, so we have to adjust it.”

“Yeah, you need the nitrogen mixed into the gravel, made into fertilizer, and then seeded. I think I can find the recipe, and you can find a way to make it work.”   Vorts replied, as Jork chuckled. 

“You just love making me work, don’t you? What about the clone machine? Is it working?”

“Yeah, just a few last tweaks, got perfect bacteria fish eggs; they are trying to hatch them. If it works, then I think I can get what dog thingy you want. How did you get that anyway?”

“He gave me access to his design and blueprints. He forgot that it included his clone cell library. Not my fault.”

 Vorts laughed. “He is such a moron about these things.”

“Or he is playing us. Have you thought about that? He might do all of this on purpose. My guess is that he will return with at least ten new strays and some new great idea.”

“I agree with the strays, but playing us? No. He is just lucky. I guess is that some deity is watching over him. Just wait, and he will start some religion. He is probably a prophet from one of those earth religions.” Vorts countered, and Jork thought about it.

“Maybe some of both. You heard what the farmers called him, right?” 

“No? what?” Vorts turned and looked at him.

“Galios!” He shook his head slightly at the words.

“Galios? Him?” Vorts laughed, then stopped. “Wait, you serious?”

“Yeah, they call him the savior that will walk out of chaos to bring order.  He is human, after all, remember. Children of Chaos, and here comes Adam, who will bring life and order to this planet. Showing us how to do it.“ Jork was serious now.

“Yeah, but Galios? That’s a myth, and he isn’t showing us; we are doing it. He is just bumbling around.” Vorts replied as he stopped his work on the screen and turned to look at Jork.

“Or is he? Look at his newest plan. Dump nitrogen in the ocean, we go ‘That’s dumb. You have to do it this way. ‘ He will reply with ‘Oh, that’s smart I should have thought about it.’ “ Jork imitated Adams's voice, and  Vorts smiled then got serious. 

“Frack.. yeah, then we get to take the credit, we do it more, and he can pretend to be a bumbling idiot, hiding in plain sight.  But that doesn’t explain everything. Nobody knows what's happening here, and he always tries to hide us.” 

“What happens if you try to hide something in the galaxy?” Jork asked, and Vort hung his head in defeat.

“People get curious and try to find out so they can copy it. He is teaching us how to terraform, isn’t he? Then, we will teach the rest. Hell, the students want to travel the galaxy to explore planets, and their whole point is that the planetary scaling system is broken. He might not be Galios, but he is doing something right.” Vorts said.

“You know Galios is not one person, right?” The voice came from the door, where Hara was coming in with Miker. She let him down, and he ran to his dad. 

“What do you mean?” Jork said as he picked up his son and put him on his lap.

“Galios is a god of many faces, appearing when needed, always a stranger, and always bringing change for the better. It's just people trying to explain how new ideas can bring benefits; strangers can be Galios or Burimo, who bring chaos and disaster. He is from Earth. They have many new ideas for us.  He is bringing them to us. He is a Galios, not the Galios. If he was, he had to be born without parents, left discarded among the unwanted , and saved before traveling the ocean of night after gaining the love of the goddess of luck and the god of wealth.  He also has to die to meet his wife so he is son can be born. Does that sound like Adam? If so, where is his Wife? He is also supposed to have the protection of the Knight of the gods, as well as the crafter and gods of life. Where are those gods?  Gods surround the real Galios; do you see any others around? No, he is A Galios, a stranger bringing new ideas. And there are many of those.” She explained, looked at the screen, and shook her head.  “I’ll do the seventh, but he can forget about the eight.”

They looked at her and agreed. “Yeah, it's just farmers talk. Anyway, I will go talk to the students, "" Jork replied as he headed out with Miker, who had now climbed to his shoulders.



In the following days, they worked on different small projects. The students were checking out the lakes and trying to figure out which one to use and where to start; when they found a place, they borrowed two droids to build a small observation post. It took a week while Jork worked on repurposing some of the farming seeding tractors they had acquired from the pirates to be both aquatic and able to seed underwater. Then, they had to make the fertilizer producer, which was easier than they had thought.   It was basically carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, potassium, calcium, and magnesium. All they had access to, it did, however, divert from the other project.  Jork was tinkering with making a mega hauler if he could get a crew. It would need a lot of resources, but it should be able to cut down a lot of the time that was needed. 

Unfortunately, he started to get a little distracted as he started to spend more time with the farmer.  So Vorts had to have a talk with him about not fraternizing with the workers. Beside wasn’t Skee married.  Of course, when they found out she also worked with the students, Jork started spending more time with them as well. 

Vorts and Hara had to take Skee aside to discover what was happening. They found out she was not married and didn’t mind Jork's attention; in fact, she liked it.  So they gave up and just reminded them to not forget the work. 

Miker also seems to take to Skee, Something Hara first got a little upset about until she found out that she was expecting, which made Vorts panic as his child would be born into slavery. It took all of them to talk him out of it. Even Mir-na had to sit down with him and call her grandma to check the contract. It was first when she told him Adam had already put that into the decoration. No child would be born into slavery on Dirt.  It surprised them as it was not included in their contract. What was this declaration? Then they found out Dirt declared that they were tasked with writing into legal language for the official input in the federation databank. It’s not to be released yet as it will reveal the location to the galaxy as well.

When they found out, they looked at each other as Adams's urgency for defensive systems made sense. Some of the things they had ignored started to make sense now, and they started going over all the lists, and it all fell into place. Those extra storage houses underground was for hiding and storage of weapons. The redundant satellites around the system were warning systems, as were the constant drone scanning on in all the asteroid fields. He was building defense without them even knowing it.  Every small project he had not personally assigned was suddenly put on hold as they had a long list of things to complete. 

“You called him a bumbling idiot? I guess we were the fools all along.” Jork commented as they sat in the administration office, Vorts agreed. “Yeah maybe he is the smart one?”

“Smart? I think this is his human part; he probably is unaware of what he is doing. Humans like their defense and are very good at war. Children of Chaos also means they are children of war. “ Barro replied, he was the pilots’ cyberwar expert and was working on securing the systems.

“I thought warriors were the deathworlders?” Jork replied, and Barro chuckled.

“Deathworlders are shaken troopers, good at war, like us and the Haran. Chaosworlders are more dangerous. They are unpredictable, and they expect and plan for chaos. He doesn't know if he will be attacked or how, so he is just trying to predict any type of attack and is probably going overboard. If we follow his plan, we will immediately know if anybody enters the system from any entry point, even above or below.  He seems to treat this as a game.” He said and they looked at him.

“Are you sure?”  Vorts asked.

“Yeah. This is what gamers do, nobody would do it in real life as it's mostly a waste of resources, but he has those resources we need in abundance. I mean, this system would be perfect to make a military outpost, not so much a colony for people.” Barro replied as he grabbed his cup of coffee. “The bastard got me addicted. I would take my pay in coffee by now.”

They all laughed. “Thank the gods he made it free, or he would have a rebellion on his hand.”

“So where would you build a military base here then?”

“Some barracks and a hidden city for R&R, probably make it underground. Then, a few manned satellites were placed in the asteroid field, and a space station was placed above the planet. The only problem is the lack of iridium. We will need a few tons of the stuff. “ 

“Yeah, real piety. “ Jork replied.

“And it would take about a thousand worker droids and about a hundred crafting ships about a year to make it.”  He continued. “But it would be pretty nifty. Imagine Dirt protected by a proper military force. Hells, he could turn the whole place into a free state and do as he pleases. And the rich and famous would love to use it to escape prying eyes. That’s what I would do: Build a few casinos and enjoy life.” Barro said, then shrugged. “But I'm not Adam; he will probably do something insane that turns out for the better.”

“There is a problem with your dream. Where can you get all of the materials? I mean, you're talking about a space station that’s a lot of materials, and you said we only need Iridium?” Jork replied.

“Well, the next system out is dead. Just a son and asteroids, filled with all you need. Except. You guessed it, Iridium. We use that system for training exercises, just four light years away; that’s a short jump of about half a day.  And we scanned it. It's not tech, and we have seen no trace of iridium either. Everything else, just not that damn stuff. “ He replied as he worked, and Jork and Vorts looked at each other.

“Just a sun and asteroids? No claim? no tech? Are you sure?” Vorts said.

“Yeah. Well, it's only fighter scans, so you should do a proper scan. But you know how they are. That’s a rubble system, with a high risk of destruction, so they leave it open. Anybody could mine it unless somebody claims it.” He replied, and Jorks grinned. 

“Don’t tell anybody about it; we must talk to Adam about that. We can set up a mining operation there.” Jork demanded, and Vorts thought about it.

“He needs more people. “

“Let's see how many he brings this time. Hopefully, he brings some ships as well.” Jork said.

1g4273p,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvicecanada/comments/1g4273p/surveillance_question/,Surveillance question.,So for years now with the advancements in technology I’ve had people talking to me everyday in the privacy of my own home and at work. It’s like talking to someone over the phone without a phone. I figured “who else could have this kind of technology and simply abuse their power and fuck up this bad to simply brag about?” Well this leads to an arrest I had a few years later where the officer let slip I was under surveillance but I had never done anything above that arrest I had that day (assault for throwing a girls coffee out of her hand who purposely bumped into me at a 7/11.) My file as I was sitting in the back of a police cruiser also said “suspicion” of doing other things. But I had no criminal record. The question is not whether or not I broke a few drunk in public laws. The question I’m having is how do I get police surveillance to stop harassing me everyday when in their investigation they didn’t find anything they accused me of and I never did anything above public drunkenness (fyi: I’ve been sober for 4 years now) what do I do to stop this? It’s clearly personal. Do I start with consulting with a lawyer? What kind of lawyer? There’s things that have happened to me during the passed 7 years they’ve been doing this to me and I believe they only started talking to me because they just wanted to mess with my head because i was struggling at the time and I was always alone. It’s for a lot of different ridiculous reasons now like attention I get from other people because I’m in recovery now. And the fact that I through out “how stupid do you have to be to let a civilian know what your capabilities in police surveillance are?” I’m not someone that struggles with any kind of mental illness. Let’s just say if you don’t believe me don’t comment. But let’s say this is happening? Police are extending a surveillance for way too long just so they can talk to me all day. And it is not pleasant conversation it’s police surveillance really out to get me because I simply figured out they were police to begin with. They’re are so many ridiculous things that have happened over the years and I just need to know where could I turn to to just get some advice. Because it’s been years now and I just want to move on from this.. I’m in Edmonton Alberta,1,1728977230.0,legaladvicecanada,2,1.0,False
1g426rq,https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/1g426rq/how_should_we_respond_to_heinous_criminal_acts/,How should we respond to heinous criminal acts?,"When the news reports a heinous and abhorrent crime, something unconscionable such as throwing boiling coffee on a baby, the response is normally unanimous outrage and condemnation. It's a visceral reaction. It's easy to believe such a reaction is justified. But that's what my question is about - is it really justified? Or do we need to react with compassion, both for the victim as well as the perpetrator, equally?

We are all capable of becoming monsters, but we are still human. We know for example that childhood adversity influences the development of abnormal behaviour in adulthood. Why shouldn't our gut reaction to these crimes be compassion, or at least pity, first and foremost? Why should we not instead consider the event tragic on both sides?

I often see people respond by wishing harm on the perpetrators and wonder if they realise that would only exacerbate the problem. Suffering begets suffering, but compassion breaks and reverses that cycle. Is the absence of compassion for random acts of violence (and other abhorrent acts against humanity) a sign of emotional immaturity? Is it a lack of insight into one's own capability for committing those same atrocities? And what is the proper way to react?

I tired to shrug it off and live my life with him, pero hindi kaya ng sikmura magtolerate, we broke up. Then, after the break up, ang bilis niya maghanap ng iba, eh nakita ko ulit na nakikipag SOP pa siya sa mga nakakausap niya sa telegram from yellow app. One of them, is my friend. hehe, so she sent me their convo and nagali ttalaga ako, kasi ang bilis naman niya makipag tutut sa iba. So fast forward, february 2023, I learned from our common friend na in a relationship na ulit siya, samantalng ako, I am still dwelling sa emotional pain na naramdaman ko from the cheating issue. Inaway pa ako ni ate girl nung april, saying na baka daw sa pag cope ko, nasisira ko yung mental health niya, when in fact, sira na mental health ko since then (haha jokes on you.) Then fast forward, may mga sumusundot sundot pa rin na urge skain to check yung mga profile nila, they seem to be happy together. Nagawa na ng ex ko lahat ng mga bagay na gusto kong gawin niya sakin pero di niya ginawa. Nabibilhan niya na ng gusto niya si girl, and everything. Nakaramdam ako ng ouch. so habang umuusad ang buhay, nagrereview ako sa boards and I have a very supportive suitor around may 2023. I passed the board exam and my suitor became my boyfriend (until now). He is very supportive, a giver, lahat na and very mature. (my ideal man). So as our time passess by, a year after, this year of october, chinat ako ni ate girl na naging jowa ng ex ko, apparently they broke up. The reason? they were living together for 8 months and sinabi ni guy na wala na raw siyagn time sa sarili niya. I also learned that the guy cheated on her sept 2023 but she shrugged it off, tapos ngayon they really broke up. A day after the broke up, the girl said na binalikan ni guy yung ex fubu niya and nakikipag SOP ulit siya. so nandiri na si girl sa mga nangyayri. not until this girl decided to share a tiktok video of the guy exposing him as a cheater. Tas ayun, ang daming nagsulputang kwento. Around 2020, this guy was talking to a minor, tapos hinihingian niya ng Nxdes. He was 21 that time i think, and more story unfolds. yung mother ni guy? pinapabura kay ate girl yung post niya, and his mother even said ""Sa lahat ng yan alam ko wala na natira s aanak ko. Baka lagi na yan nakatungo pag lumabas. Kung nawalan, mas madami din nawala kay Sam, Wala pa naman ako dyan, Kung may magmamahal na lang sa kanya ako nalang cguro yon"" Mother, you raised a pathlogical liar, a cheater and a manipulator, so di niya deserve ng love from everyone.

Ngayon, I learned from my ex's ex na ang kwento pala ni guy kung bakit kami nagbreak is because ako yung unang nagcheat. Meron daw sumusundo sakin at nag SB daw kami, and meron daw nagbibigay ng cake sakin tas ineentertain ko raw. Ay sana true na lang na merong nagsusundo sakin para libre pamasahe anoh. Sana tru na may free cake. That time, busy ako sa work and kakareview. Nagwowork ako kasi I want to give him the best life and to help him din kasi that time puro ako sumasagot ng dates namin, even pamasahe niya kapag sinusundo niya ako sa work kasi wala siyang trabaho that time. nagkaurge lang siya mag apply ng work nung nagkaron na ako ng work ko. then same story ang ginagawa ni guy s akaniyang ex ngayon. Nauna raw kasing magloko si girl kaya siya nagcheat LOL. That girl gave everything to you, all the love and support, pero nagawa mo pa rin yun s akaniya. then you have many victims pa. hahaha more story to unfold. I hope may bumili sa zus coffee sa greenhills tapos itapon sayo yung mainit na kape. ",2,1728976865.0,OffMyChestPH,2,1.0,False

# Her Sudden Departure, and the Weight of Guilt

>  
*I have changed some names and locations for anonymity.*  
  
*At the time of writing this, I am a 32 M, my wife is a 28 F, and the character known as Shev is a 26 M. My wifes friend known as  Katerina is a 30 F.*

My wife and I shared what felt like a fairy-tale relationship. After nine incredible months together, including one living together, we eloped! Soon after, she returned to Russia to settle her affairs, but she had to quickly flee back to Canada following the invasion of Ukraine. I supported her fully—covering her immigration costs, medical bills, and living expenses. When she secured a well-paying government job in March of this year, we both felt like our relationship was on solid ground. For these first two and a half years, we were happier than we ever thought possible.

[My wife and I sharing a kiss.](https://preview.redd.it/l1j9863sbvud1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=17295acad7baa22fa64433f167fbbd8ee5e01013)

However, we had one recurring issue: she felt threatened by a close female friend of mine. While I respected her wishes through my actions, I kept insisting verbally that we shouldn’t control each other’s friendships. Unfortunately, I made her feel unheard, and she only heard my words rather than seeing my actions. It wasn’t until years later, in one of our final therapy sessions on September 24th, 2024 that I finally understood what I had mistaken for jealousy was her expressing hurt and a need for more support during an incredibly challenging time. When we both came to terms with this, we cried together, finally resolving something that had quietly hurt us both.

About 4-5 months ago, in early June 2024, I encouraged her to join a new Russian friend group she met at a concert. I thought these friendships would help her feel less isolated and provide her with the support network she’d been missing. Among this group was a man named Shev. Within a few weeks, he began aggressively pursuing her—sending post-shower selfies, kissy-faces, long messages about how wonderful she was, and constantly asking her to ""hang out."" The first time I met him, I could see he had a strong crush on her, and I told my wife as much. She brushed it off, assuring me nothing would ever happen, saying he was “too lacking in the looks department” or “looked too much like a potato” for her. But as they grew closer, he quickly became her best friend and confidant, using the trust and personal issues she shared with him to deepen their connection.

[Shev sending a \\""casual\\"" morning selfie.](https://preview.redd.it/dvx942bwbvud1.jpg?width=945&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ac3238402456326d935f0744a77da2a3bbcaccd9)

Around this time, her behaviour changed dramatically. It was like she became a different person overnight. She started staying out until 9 AM, stopped helping with household chores, began spending excessively, neglected her hygiene (even stopped brushing her teeth), barely slept, became guarded when I tried to hug her, refused to let me clean her lunch or coffee containers, stopped exercising, and her sexual preferences changed abruptly. She even would have me cook food that she'd then refuse to eat. These sudden shifts left me feeling confused and hurt, as though the woman I had known for almost four years was disappearing

As their connection grew stronger, Shev used what he knew about her to fill spaces in her life where I hadn’t before. Where I wouldn’t sing, he would sing for her. Where I avoided loud, late-night concerts, he’d buy her tickets. Instead of buying a car, I was focused on saving for a home where we could eventually start a family (something my wife wanted dearly), spending hours working with banks to secure us a mortgage, while he’d take her on long road trips in his Lexus. I could feel her pulling away. When I confronted her, she responded with contradicting stories, lies, and denial, accusing me of being paranoid and controlling. At one point, one of the friends from this new group (Katerina) even suggested to her that I’d installed tracking devices in her belongings or hidden cameras in the house—claims that were both hurtful and absurd. Whenever her stories didn’t add up, she’d blame me for “not listening” or brush it off as a simple misunderstanding. Yet each time we talked, I held to my values, assuring her that I trusted her, believed she’d make the right choices, and apologised for any misunderstandings on my part. It was at this time, she stopped talking about Shev all together, and started talking about her new hang outs with Katerina.

This went on for months. Coincidentally, around the same time she met this new friend group in June, we began seeing a couples therapist. But she never mentioned her friendship with Shev or the real issues between us until that pivotal session on September 24th. By August, about two months into their friendship, her relationship with Shev had become sexual, and the emotional distance between us only grew.

[Shev driving my wife to a concert, his hands deep into her thighs \(early August\). Concert planned since July.](https://preview.redd.it/wi3iy700cvud1.jpg?width=567&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=816aaaa3ffc5f4ad37417d3a784293a41b8b9f97)

I discovered her affair in the worst possible way. While going through photos on my own phone, I was revisiting moments from our recent trip to Calgary (September 27th-29th), where we celebrated my grandfather’s 86th birthday and had paid a photographer to shoot family photos. To my horror, I stumbled upon explicit photos and videos she’d been sending Shev, along with intimate, happy moments of them together. Somehow, she’d been accidentally sending them to me as well for months. Seeing those photos—especially the ones where they looked genuinely close and in love—shattered me. It felt like she’d been living a double life right in front of me, one warm and loving, the other cold and cruel. I also realised that every story she told me where she was with Katerina, was actually with this Shev fellow instead.

I kept the information to myself for over a week, feeling a part of me wear away each day. I thought therapy would be our best hope—a calm and accepting environment where we could try to work things out. The day after our third anniversary (October 9th), I finally confronted her during a session, pouring everything into a heartfelt letter. I told her I’d forgive her if she chose to stay, that I was still committed to our vows. She barely reacted, showing almost no emotion, and admitted she had already planned to leave without a word that very night—a decision she’d made even before our Calgary trip in September. She listened, eventually saying she “needed time to think” and would stay for now. Later that evening, we talked more, cried in each other’s arms, and connected on a level we hadn’t before. It felt both beautiful and hopeful. 

Then, early the next morning, she let me know her friend Katerina would be coming by to help her pack and that she would, after all, leave temporarily at least (30 days) to “clear her mind.” This was despite what we’d discussed in therapy the day before, where I’d expressed concern that her friends seemed biased against our marriage, many of them already scheduling couples events for her and Shev. But as I’m a 6-foot male and she’s only 5'3"", I agreed, trusting her assurances that her friend would be respectful and friendly. The reality, though, was far different.

Watching them pack her things was an excruciating three hours. Her friend refused to look at me, treating me like I didn’t exist. I asked if they’d mind speaking in English, but her friend said she “wasn’t in the mood to talk,” then started speaking a mile a minute in Russian. After almost two hours, desperate to understand what was happening, I started using Google Translate to follow parts of their conversation. I didn’t hide it; I even said, “I got it,” and waved my phone to show my wife when she asked if I wanted to say something.

Through their conversation, I learned my wife had been lying about her plans. She had told me and our therapist that, if she left, she’d move in with her Katerina, but she was actually still planning to live with Shev. Her friend encouraged her to take as much as possible, saying she could just throw out whatever she didn’t want later, even though my wife had insisted on packing light. Her friend even told her that, once settled with him, she didn’t need to show me any respect. She went on to brag about stealing things from one of her own exes when she moved out. When my wife realized I’d been translating, she was devastated, refusing to look at me and collapsing in tears. Taking it as a huge invasion of privacy and trust.

Her friend, right there in my own bedroom, then began lecturing me about how I was a disappointment, and turned to my wife and saying, “See, I told you!” as if this justified her earlier suspicions about hidden cameras and trackers. Seeing my wife’s hurt, I couldn’t even register the irony of me being the bad guy, and I felt utterly drained. I had hurt the person that meant the most to me.

Despite her friend’s attitude, my wife didn’t take everything. She mostly packed items that were definitively hers, although they briefly discussed taking things I had bought for the home or was given before we met, like measuring cups, pots, pans, power bars, and drawer organizers. I stayed close during the move, partly so my mind wouldn’t later imagine that they’d taken things that weren’t theirs. I had communicated this to my wife beforehand, and although she felt uncomfortable with it, she agreed it was reasonable.

Since she left, I’ve felt destroyed. She never offered back the engagement ring I proposed with—a family heirloom from my aunt, who passed away from multiple sclerosis. I don’t think she took it to sell, but it feels like she’s holding onto it as collateral until she comes back for the rest of her stuff. The night before she left, she pleaded with me not to change the locks, cancel our credit cards, or drain her bank account, but after seeing how her friends treated me and what they are saying, I realize they don’t care about my well-being or our marriages. And just a day after moving out, she’s already out buying new furniture.

She claimed this move was just for 30 days to regroup her thoughts, taking us into mid-November. Yet now, she’s refusing to contribute to November’s rent, despite leaving many of her belongings behind. I’m still paying her phone bill, which renews in two days, and our shared credit card—holding a substantial balance due mostly to her expenses—is due the day after. These new friends have taken her away from me, and I’m left here, forced to start over alone.

The irony is painful: Shev himself was once betrayed by a fiancée who left him for a friend, something that still makes him angry and aggressive if it’s brought up, yet he knowingly did the same to me. I want to feel anger and decisiveness, but all I feel is guilt, like I somehow let my wife down, even though she’s the one who betrayed me. I keep wondering if I could have done more—listened better, included her in the little things, spent less time planning our future and more time just being there.

The night before she left, she gave me a list of half a dozen things I’d need to change if I wanted her to stay, but by then, it felt like it was already too late, I don't even understand the point of it... As she finished packing what she could, the betrayal she felt over my translating their conversation weighed on her so heavily that she didn’t even say goodbye. She collapsed outside by the car in tears, and her friend picked her up, ushering her into the vehicle. She just looked back at me with hurt and tears in her eyes—a look that will haunt me forever.

If anyone has been through something similar, I would deeply appreciate any advice. Right now, the pain feels endless. I’m confused and scared. I want her back, truly, and I’d do almost anything to make that happen. But more than anything, I want her to be happy… and I’m struggling to accept that this might only be possible if she builds a life without me in it.

","Creating a beautiful yet practical bedroom for your child is a fun experience. As a parent, you would love the room to reflect that unique personality, but still, in a safe, practical, and stylish manner. Whether with a compact layout or with a spacious haven in mind, there's so much that can be done to make up a bedroom that your child will adore. If you are into HDB renovation Singapore and plan on having an expert guide to help in your renovation work, an experienced [HDB renovation contractor Singapore](https://www.urbannest.sg/hdb-renovation-contractor-singapore) will bring to life your dreams. From cozy nurseries to creative teen rooms, here's a look at some inspiring ideas to get you started.

https://preview.redd.it/8v2xsydccvud1.png?width=740&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0d389dfb8ccfaebea2b5806204dc8c622eff074

# A Contemporary Space with Safety in Mind

Always the concern for parents with young children, it is great to design around this concept, and sometimes it will yield outstanding results. A well-designed 3 room HDB renovation optimizes the space using playful elements and ensures safety features are always on top. In this design, arched wall panels covered in soft materials, like tufted fabric, add a playful touch and create a safe environment. Calm and serene, with soft lavender-colored walls, this young child's bedroom is a perfect retreat for someone. A wooden built-in bed with a storage area underneath is great for fully utilizing the space at your disposal.



This type of bed also includes added storage space. It can be accompanied by a grey upholstered accent chair, creating a nice reading nook or sitting area for parents. The options include recessed and cove lighting to help warm the room but not make it too dark for reading or playing. It means the sharp or breakable light fixtures are out of reach, hence another level of protection.



Storage is another essential element, especially for a child's bedroom. Built-in storage shelves that combine open and closed shelving can be integrated into the headboard wall, providing space for books, toys, and supplies. Mixing closed cabinets and open shelving keeps the room from being cluttered but still accessible to the child. Completing the room's aesthetic, a playful circular multicolored rug and wooden floors predestined for a nursery or a growing child's space warm up the room, making it kid-friendly with a fresh approach.

# Teen-Friendly Design with a Modern Twist

A bedroom is sure to change as the child grows into adulthood. This room is for a modern teenager. A teen bedroom must be flavored with its style and have functionality. An expert HDB renovation Singapore would create a sophisticated yet cozy space for your teen. It's perfect to begin with a queen-sized bed whose headboard is grey-toned. Such a bigger bed size comfortably grows with your child from preteens into their teenage years. It can also be combined with a study table as a bedside unit, wherein one can relax and work simultaneously. The room is kept well-lit without overwhelming the aesthetic by employing a simple ceiling lighting system.



An under-bed storage unit may keep extra blankets, clothes or school supplies for added storage. A blue wall-mounted shelf becomes an additional storage place and is a unique design element. A wallpaper can be a great design to accentuate the personality of a teenager's bedroom. The scene of blue rafters against a wall creates a focal point and brings the room together. It combines practical furniture and unique design elements to keep the room fresh and suitable for teenagers.

# Minimalistic Yet Playful Space

Sometimes, the most straightforward design should be good enough for a child's room. Then, a [3 room HDB renovation](https://www.urbannest.sg/hdb-renovation-contractor-singapore) can afford to embrace some minimalist principles of cleanliness, functionality, and aesthetics. A white sofa-cum-bed is a multifunctional furniture for a minimalist room. A white sofa-cum-bed is beneficial as a bed but a seat during the day. Printed cushions in different colors bring playful touches without a messy attitude to the design. There is also an organized study table with a small drawer for school supplies and toys.



The room remains clutter-free, yet there is enough storage space. The interior design is all-white. On the walls, there could be paintings such as cloth-printed designs, having the tiniest texture and color to break the monotony in the room. This minimalism with fun elements creates a fabulous space that fits both boys and girls.

# Bold Blue and Wood-Themed Kids' Bedroom

The blue and wood design is fashionable and time-honored for parents who want to inject color and fun into their child's bedroom. This design is particularly effective in smaller spaces, often in HDB apartments. Regardless of your child's evolving preferences a single bed with a white and wood finish offers a neutral foundation that will last for years. A blue wooden study table with built-in storage is ideal for the space because it is fashionable and useful.



General lighting can be provided by ceiling lights, and focused lighting for homework or reading can be achieved with a table lamp on the study desk. The walls are one area where ingenuity is evident. Striped blue-white wallpaper and some patterned decorations create quite a visually vibrant area without feeling cluttered. This design fits perfectly with a boy, or any other color scheme can make the design fit for different preferences.

# Scandinavian-Inspired Bunk Bed Design for Twins

Maximizing space becomes crucial when designing a shared bedroom, especially for twins. An HDB renovation contractor Singapore will help you maximize your 3 room HDB renovation by using space-saving solutions like bunk beds. A Scandinavian inspired design featuring a white bunk bed with wooden staircases is practical and stylish. Bunk beds provide room for two sleeping places without taking up the floor space that two separate beds would take up. The stairs can also be used as further storage units, using the available space to its fullest potential.



Adding to the practicality, two round coffee tables and white open storage with fluted paneling and drawer storage ensure that every part of the room serves a purpose. It was the perfect blend of functionality and elegance. Elegant textured white and green wallpaper adds a soft touch to the design, while wooden flooring complements the white furniture of this home for welcoming twin babies.

1g41ory,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueScaryStories/comments/1g41ory/an_explosive_day_at_the_gas_station/,An explosive day at the gas station.,"This encounter actually happened a few years ago from when I was a youth back in my small town. Since then, I've moved onto bigger and brighter things but still receive lots of amaze when recanting this story so I figured I'd write it down.

To understand it properly, you might want a bit of context. I worked at a lowly, local gas station that sat on the edge of my small remote town. Due to a lack of words to describe it, I would have to call it 'weird' because of the things that would happen there. Sometimes a few boxes within the inventory room would fall over; whether because of the local paranormal phenomenon or the huge mice that we had no idea on where they were coming from. We had numerous encounters with law enforcement which usually ended with someone being arrested and detained in the store. Lastly, I've had my well-being generally threatened more than once within the establishment.  Regardless, the point I'm trying to get at is that the place wasn't exactly unknown to strange happenings, and I was quite frankly accepting of the fact because the lack of options on where to work, and the coworkers were pretty cool people.

It was a dim and rainy day when I walked into work. I had just finished with a tedious routine of high school crap and was honestly rather done with the day, but I was scheduled and nobody wanted to take my shift from me. The instant I stepped through the door, I recall recoiling at the rather pungent smell of gasoline which was prominent throughout the entire gas station. I immediately went to ask my bosses (supervisors), and the morning shift about the matter. Neither of the pairs knew what was actually making the smell, and simply told me and my coworker  to 'power through it.' I had shrugged it off and went straight to my usual duties, like refilling the slush machine, stocking the chips and serving about anyone that would walk in.

It's safe to say that the shift was passing fairly well and quick. It was hardly a secret that we were high from the smell/fumes present throughout the building, but in all honesty that just made dealing with annoying customers way more easier than it actually is. I was sitting behind the till eating from a full tray of nachos and taking the occasional sip from a slush (cherry, obviously). It was then that my coworker, R, told me that they had finsihed with their assigned task and was going to head out for a smoke break. I offered them a nacho, but they politely declined and went out back. It wasn't even five minutes later when R came back inside holding two things in their hands. The first was a destroyed vent lid, and the second was an open propane tank. The following interaction was quite a funny one; or so I'm told.

R: ""Hey man, look what I found behind the store.""

: ""Woah, that's pretty cool man.. What are those.. exactly??""

R: ""Well, it's the vent lid for the back and a half-full canister of propane..""

: ""Sick!.. What does that mean??""

R: ""For the last few hours, this is what we've been breathing. Right now? The whole store is filled with this crap.""

: ""Ooh.. So what??""

R: ""God.. If someone lit a match, sparked a lighter, or even turned on the fu*cking coffee machine, we'd go kaboom!""

: ""Ahh.. I see.. So I reckon we call our boss?""

We did as such. Half an hour later, our parking lot was full of police, firemen, and our supervisor. While the men in uniform ran around and investigated the building, me and R sat in our usual spots and did what we usually did. R sat on their phone, probably scrolling away through Tik-Tok, while I sipped on my crappy gas station coffee and read my book. After sitting there for a few minutes, I gathered the courage to ask my boss the question on what to do next. We clocked out and went home for the rest of the day. I might've been mad, but I completed the majority of the shift so I had my money for the day already. Plus I was high as a kite so I couldn't stay bothered too much even if I wanted. When I got home, I scarfed down a whole pot worth of Mac and cheese then passed out. I never really found out who left the propane tank there, albeit I never really had the care to ask months later.

I hope you enjoyed. If you liked the story, maybe I'll share a few more of them.",3,1728974869.0,TrueScaryStories,0,1.0,False

1g41lb7,https://www.reddit.com/r/LesbianActually/comments/1g41lb7/ghosted_after_losing_my_virginity_to_a_hookup/,ghosted after losing my virginity to a hookup,"Throwaway account because this is extremely embarrassing 😭 Also English is not my native language so please excuse any mistakes!!

I [22F] recently hooked up with a girl [22F] I met on the HER dating app. We were both on the same page that we wanted casual hookups or maybe a friends with benefits situation if we got along well. 

I was a complete virgin before this hookup. I’m a late bloomer in general and I was in the “am I gay or bisexual?” debacle for years before I recently figured out I’m a lesbian. I’d never done anything sexual with anyone, partially because I don’t think I’m attractive and I’m VERY socially awkward/anxious, and partially because of body dysmorphia and insecurities (I have an eating disorder which fucks up my perception of my appearance so much) The one and only time I had ever kissed anyone was 3 years ago, it was a man and I absolutely hated it so I never tried again.

However, I was feeling super insecure about being a virgin at my big age (stupid I know) and I thought I must be extremely unloveable and ugly if no one has ever wanted to date me. So I decided I would just get it over with and find a random hookup and never speak to them again, that way I won’t have to deal with the embarrassment of it all.

We talked for about a week before we agreed to meet up at her place. We got coffee beforehand and actually got along super well and spent more than an hour just talking. I should probably mention that I did tell her I was inexperienced and might need some guidance and she was totally fine with it, actually responded very kindly and said it didn’t matter to her at all. Afterwards we went to her place and eventually hooked up.

Long story short, she ended up going down on me and then I went down on her, then I had to go to work so she kissed me goodbye and I left. The whole time I thought everything was fine, and we both later texted each other that we had a great time. I will say I was extremely anxious when I was on the receiving end, I couldn’t relax and I think I was too quiet for her liking but it just felt so embarrassing in the moment. I didn’t want her to think she was doing something wrong so I kinda “forced” myself to come and it wasn’t satisfying but honestly I didn’t mind at all since it was my first time and I expected to be super nervous anyway.

When it was my turn to go down on her I kinda just did what felt right and asked her to tell me if something was or wasn’t working. From what I’ve gathered I did a pretty good job because I made her come twice in a row and she even said she can’t remember the last time someone was able to do that to her. She also called me pretty multiple times and wanted to go down on me again but couldn’t because I had to leave for work. We even spent the last 20 mins after eating snacks and talking about random shit which was very nice, it didn’t feel awkward at all. She even jokingly asked if I could call in sick to work so I could stay with her.

Afterwards I asked her if this was a one time thing or if she wants to meet again, and she said she definitely wants to hookup again but isn’t sure how long term this would be. She said she would sleep on it and let me know in the morning. Then the HER app apparently crashed because she said she couldn’t text me anything for a day or two and we hadn’t exchanged numbers or social media or anything. When the app was fine again, she texted me that she wants this to be a “cute casual thing” and basically hookup more but isn’t sure if it will be a fully friends with benefits longterm thing. I was okay with that, so we exchanged social media and she even texted me first.

Well I replied and now it’s been almost three days and she hasn’t replied since. She’s been active on Instagram multiple times but hasn’t seen or replied to my texts, and I don’t want to be pushy or weird and text more. Sure, there’s always a chance that she’s just very busy, but I can’t help but feel like I somehow fucked it up and I’m being ghosted. 

I genuinely thought we both had a great time, and she said a lot of nice things about me during and after. I don’t understand why she would do that and show interest and then suddenly disappear. I’ve been ghosted many times before and I really don’t know what’s wrong with me because clearly I’m the common denominator in these situations. It might be my appearance, or awkwardness, or maybe even my personality, but the thing is I genuinely tried so hard to make myself look “good” and be confident and outgoing and shit. And she told me herself that I made her feel good, so it can’t be that either unless she lied to make me feel better :/

Anyway I’m not even sure what I’m even asking for, I guess I’m just confused. This experience had really given me a confidence boost after an entire lifetime or not being desired/asked out/etc. and now I’m undoing everything by overthinking and being a little bitch about it 😭😭😭",2,1728974432.0,LesbianActually,1,1.0,False

She asked if I wanted to have breakfast together so I said ""sure, that sounds lovely"".

She already started preparing hers, cutting up a pear for her musli and setting her stuff up at the table. I figured ""great, she already used a cutting board then i can borrow that real quick for cutting my own pear, 20 seconds tops"". And she got mad, she rushed out of the kitchen started doing stuff in the bedroom. Came back to the kitchen threw the lid to my coffee mug in the sink and aggressively said. ""This just doesn't f\*g work, we can't prepare breakfast at the same time. I wasn't done with that cutting board."" 

I got annoyed as I do when she gets like that. And said I'm sorry, it won't happen again. 

She kept on pushing trying to start a quarrel, but I just kept saying ""Sorry, it won't happen again"".   
Then I put all my stuff in the fridge again, took my coffee and just said ""have a nice day, I'm going to school early"". 

And I could see her through the window when leaving, she was ugly crying by the kitchen table. And I feel like such an a-hat. But I just don't have the energy for these battles every other day.   
I told her I was sorry and that I wont do that again. 

TLDR; Partner got pissed I used the same cutting board as her and started getting aggressive, so I left for school instead of having breakfast with her.

Essentially, the comic depicted a character disliking the 'taste' of canon, and being invited to the 'fanon buffet', if you will. I don't remember specific details of the first section, but there was a later section involving a different character seeking out fluff, as represented by whipped cream and coffee shop AUs, a section where another character found the 'taste' of fluff too sweet and sought out darker settings, involving I believe pine tree shaped cookies as a tongue-in-cheek representation of pining, and then the final section where a character was metaphorically 'thirsty', and so went to the bar, which had tastes such as lemon, lime, and different sizes of cup representing different varieties of participant.",3,1728974018.0,tipofmytongue,2,1.0,False
