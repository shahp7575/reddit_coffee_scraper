It was around midnight a few years ago when I heard the sound of someone breaking into my house. I don’t think I had more than twenty minutes of sleep but as soon as I heard the window being broken I was wide awake and looking for my phone to call the police. 

My heart sank when I remembered that I left it downstairs, charging in the kitchen. The source of the break in. 

I live alone, had no one as backup and didn't have a gun, so I grabbed the only thing that could pass as a weapon: a baseball bat. Once I had that, I psyched myself up to go downstairs to face the intruder. 

Once I reached the bottom step I saw the silhouette of a man sitting at my kitchen table. It was dark so I could not see what he looked like but the stink coming off him was enough to curl my nose hairs. It was obvious even without the lights on that he was, at best, a drifter and at worst a vagrant. Either way, even a blind man could see that whoever broke into my house fell on hard times. Not that that was going to change my mind about kicking him out of my house. He did break in after all. 

When I turned on the lights I could see that his clothes were old, dirty and torn. It was as though he pulled them out of a dumpster. He was so skinny that I wouldn't be surprised if the man was sick on top of being malnourished. His hair was long and stringy and, just like his beard, it grew in patches. The way he sat there motionless with his thousand yard stare and tears forming in his eyes made me think that he had given up on life. 

I was about to tell him to get out but as soon as I opened my mouth I noticed that he had a shotgun on his lap. 

Upon seeing this I lowered the bat and nervously asked him what he wanted. However he didn’t answer me. Instead, he just sat still and stared straight ahead as if I wasn't even in the room with him. 

Scared, I asked him if he was hungry and that I could make him something. As a kid I was instructed to give the homeless food instead of money since they might buy booze or drugs with it, but the man didn't answer. So after a long awkward silence I took the initiative and went to heat up some leftovers in the microwave. As I was doing this I prodded the stranger with questions, what his name was, what he wanted and if he wanted me to call anyone. 

He did not answer for a long time and hardly noticed the food I placed in front of him once it was ready. However, once he started talking he told me a story that would change my life forever. 

He said his name was Cole Dyer and admitted to killing twenty people. 

I’m not at all embarrassed to say that I cried and begged for my life at this point. This only angered Cole.

“I have something I need to fucking get off my chest. So sit the fuck down and shut up.”

Doing what he said, I sat across from Cole who told me how he got started killing people. His first victim was a hooker who he choked to death when he thought she was stealing from him. With the shotgun in his lap I didn't want to anger him so I just sat there and didn't ask any questions. 

Cole would go on to explain that this victim wasn't killed like the others because, at that time he didn't know how he wanted to murder people, or for that matter, knew that he had a taste for it.

“I figured it would be just a matter of time before some cop showed up at my doorstep or came to my work to ask questions. But after a few weeks of no one coming around and not even a mention in the obituaries, I figured I was in the clear” Cole explained. “It shouldn't be surprising that no one gave a shit about her. If anyone cared for her she wouldnt have been a fucking hooker, you know?”

Finally having a way to vent his frustrations and no longer feeling like some cog in the machine, Cole’s murderous fantasies took on a life of their own. 

“When I tried going after the second person, I tried to strangle her with a piece of guitar string. That was messy and loud and I nearly got caught. Not long after that, maybe five or six people later I came up with my own preferred method of killing people” Cole explained. “I even gave myself a silly name: The ‘Pass It On Killer.’”

It was the first time I spoke in what seemed like an hour. A single word. 

“Why?”

“Why what? The name?” Cole asked but I was too afraid to answer. 

Annoyed with my silence, Cole went ahead and explained his reasoning by justifying his twisted sense of righteousness and questionable moral compass. The gist of it was that if he killed enough “pests” good things would come back to him. 

Symbolizing this he would replace the head of his previous victim with the most current.

“Cutting off a head is hard. Even if you have power tools it's messy shit. Took a while before I got the hang of it though” Cole confessed, oblivious to my disgust. “I rigged a bike pump to a catheter, snaked it through the axillary nerve until it reached the superior vana cava. It only took about two minutes before the blood stopped flowing and by then removing the head was pretty much blood free”.

Realizing killing people he knew was a sure way of getting caught Cole learned what questions to ask complete strangers to discover the “pests” in their lives. This was easier than Cole would have guessed because in the end who didn’t like talking about themselves?

“I was always good at talking to people, you know? I could talk the devil into lighting himself on fire. Because of that it was easy to learn where the pests lived, worked, drove and more.""

Since the murders were spread out nationwide and none of his victims had any connections to each other or Cole, the authorities were at a loss. When there was a news article talking about a murder no one ever mentioned that they were connected. 

“They didn't want to cause a panic, you know? It wasn't often, but when the newspapers said the head was removed, they would say it was removed with a sword or an ax or whatever. They did this so when someone tries to take credit, they say the wrong tool and the police know it's bullshit and a waste of time. Obviously I never called any of the hotlines or tried to taunt authorities. That would just give them more clues to work with.”

I felt sick. This man was crazy and dangerous. More than that, he had a gun and was sitting across the table from me. 

“At first hearing and reading about the police chasing down leads terrified me. However after so much bullshitting they did to the public, their claims that they were closing in on a suspect didn't bother me in the slightest” Cole said with a rotten tooth smile that quickly evaporated. 

A flood of tears started filling his eyes and he blinked them away before taking the first nibble of food.

Just when it seemed that he was calm, Cole shouted at me, demanding that I grab a pen and paper and jot down his tale. 

Who was I to say no? Even though he had his hands on the table there was still a shotgun in his lap. I didn’t want to bet that it wasn't loaded or that I was faster. The safe bet was just to write the story he was telling me and hope he would show me mercy.

“I was doing this for a long time. Nearly ten years at this point. And while scouting for the twenty-first victim I found myself behind a small series of apartment buildings” Cole said, shaking his head as if he was in disbelief of his own tale. “I heard a small group of people huddled around someone's basement apartment, whispering to whoever was inside. They were a ways away so I couldn't make out the details at the time but I could see that something wasn't right about them. They were dirty. Long greasy hair and beards. But there was something else about them. Something… something evil.”

“Why do you say that?” I asked without thinking. To this day I don't know if that outburst was because I was curious or tired.

“One by one they stopped their hushed whispering and turned their gazes towards me. It was creepy as fuck so I got the hell out of there” Cole responded as though he didnt hear my question. “When I took a peek over my shoulder they were following me but stayed just out of the cone of light the street lamps provided.”

I had to admit, that sounded pretty scary, but evil? I kept my thoughts to myself and kept writing.

“It creeped me out. I was already thinking of finding someone else to kill because I don’t like killing in apartment buildings. Too many neighbors to see you or hear you when you're using the saw, you know? When I saw them though, that sort of settled it. I wasn’t going to go back there. I kept looking back in the mirror on the way home to see if I was being followed but in the five hour drive I didn’t see a thing behind me. The next day, however, I noticed a car driving slowly though my parking lot every few hours. I was smoking lots of weed at the time and figured I was just being paranoid but the next night I woke up to tapping on the door”.

As Cole explained to me what happened next he started to rock back and forth the way I’ve seen children do in an effort to calm himself down before continuing his story. 

“Thought it was my imagination at first but then I started hearing my name being whispered from the hallway. When I realized I wasn't imagining the noises I looked out the peephole.”

Cole took a moment before continuing but before he spoke he swallowed and took a drink of water from the glass I gave him. 

“There were at least five of them that time. Dirty, long hair and dark sunken eyes that seemed to glow with the hatred of some sort of hellist pit. They spent the entire night begging me to come out.” 

With the exception of the eyes, it was as though Cole was describing himself. Again, this was a thought I kept to myself.

“In that building it wasn't uncommon to hear drunken exes pound on doors demanding to be let in so their begging went on for hours. Eventually a neighbor I never bothered to get to know decided to open the door to tell the strangers to keep it down. She stopped mid sentence the moment she saw them,” Cole explained. “They pushed her back into her apartment and all piled in. Through that thin wall I could hear them tearing through her place and when she cried or begged or groaned they just laughed. Eventually they made the woman beg me to come out from my apartment. Whenever she did they would laugh and instruct her to say it louder. She would comply with their demands and her reward would be getting hit more.”

“Jesus” I blurted out.

“When I refused to open the door or even respond they grew bored and started getting even more violent with the woman. First the sounds of punches and things getting broken, but then… Jesus. They were eating her. It was loud and wet and lasted until the sun came up”.

“How did you know they were eating her? They were in a different apartment.”

“They didnt close the fucking door,” Cole answered. “Saw it when I was leaving.” He was clearly annoyed with the interruption, reminding me that I didn’t want to interrupt someone who was obviously crazy. The best course of action for me to take was to remain silent and allow Cole to go on for as long as he wanted. 

Cole then quickly ate the rest of the meatloaf I heated up for him and asked for more. When I grabbed him another piece, he stopped me from heating it up so I set it in front of him instead. Considering how he looked I thought he was going to inhale it like the other piece, but it sat there for a long time before he touched it. 

“I didn't leave my room until I was confident they were gone and that it was safe to leave. There was no way I was going to stay there. No fucking way. I packed my car and took off. I didn't know what I would need at the time, so I took my camping gear, my tools, a few guns and of course, the head of the previous pest who I kept on ice. After that I went straight to some army surplus store to get the rest of what I needed.” 

At first I assumed he was going to go out in the woods, but it became obvious that what he really meant was staying at a seedy hotel that didn't take credit cards or require ID’s. 

“About a week later I was getting some grub at some grocery store, just walking in the parking lot and minding my own business, right? They drove up right behind me and laid on the horn. I didn’t even bother getting something to eat after that. I just wanted to get the hell out of there. By the time I remembered that I left the head back in the hotel's mini fridge I had already crossed two state lines.”

I could tell this bothered him greatly and I assumed it was because now the police would have a lead and find the identity of the Pass It On Killer. However, as if reading my mind, Cole let out a dry laugh and told me the reason he was sour about it, even years later, was because he has “completion anxiety.”

At this point of the story Cole had to take a moment, and knowing that he had a shotgun on his lap I gave it to him. Hoping that my kindness would be repaid and I could keep my head once he finished his tale I poured him some milk and offered him the rest of the baby carrots I had in the fridge.

Since I live alone, I don't have much food for unexpected guests. At the time I was sure the food I was offering him would be enough of an excuse for this psycho to kill me. When I set it down in front of him, my hands were trembling.

“They had to know what I was driving, so I traded my car for a van. At least I could sleep in the van, right? Saves money on hotels and shit” Cole explained. “About five weeks later I crossed their paths again. This time I was in a deep sleep when I heard them say my name. In my dream the name was like an echo and when I woke up my eyes were immediately locked on the dark eyes of a woman with the same sinister resemblance as the men I saw back at the apartment. Without a beard, however, this woman's disfiguration was more noticeable.”

“Disfiguration?” I asked.

Cole gave a grunt that might have meant nothing, something or everything. “I might as well tell you everything, right? You are writing down my tale after all” Cole said, clearly not excited to relive the experience. “At first I thought it was a cleft lip and chin but it wasn't. The few teeth that she had were small and brown and grew fucking everywhere” Cole explained as his dirty fingers were fidgeting with the gun in his lap. “Like the gums and the inside of the cheeks and shit. Even in the dark I could see their black eyes and when I jumped into the front seat and turned over the engine the headlights revealed dozens of her family. They were all standing ten or so feet apart from each other, scattered around. Some were naked but they were all standing still, smiling and just looking at me. Like they were giving me permission to leave.”

Gooseflesh covered my entire body and I was having trouble keeping up with Coles story because he was talking too fast. 

“I tried to swerve and hit a few with the front tire or to at least clip them with the van’s fat ass; however, they all stepped to the side, effortlessly avoiding getting run down.”

As Cole took a moment to catch his breath, I asked what he meant when he said “Her family.”

“Thats a recent term I gave them. At the time I thought they were demons or vampires but not any longer.”

I wanted to ask him why he no longer thought this was the case, but I kept this question to myself. I felt I pressed my luck enough at this point with all the questions I had been asking. After all this man was insane and armed.

“After that encounter I abandoned the van and stole a car. I would do this every so often, whenever I felt that they were closing in on me. A gut feeling. This was triggered by anything from something I imagined seeing in the corner of my eye to the cries coming from a murder of crows.”

Again, I had a bunch of questions but didn't dare ask them. What did crows have to do with these people after Cole?

“Zig zagging across the country I made every effort to forever rid myself of these people. I would stay inside at night and if I could I would sleep during the day. I would pass the time by reading and listening to music. You know, good music. Peter Warlock? Bach?”

I knew who Bach was, but never heard of the other name. 

“Classical?” I asked, surprised because of Cole's appearance.

“Vivaldi Concerto No. 5 is my favorite. Bet you wouldn't have guessed that I also play the cello.”

I had no idea if Cole was pulling my leg or not, but I didn't have time to react, Cole was back to telling his story.

“While on the run I would take odd jobs here and there to pay for what I needed to survive. A tractor assembly line in Michigan, a toll booth operator in Florida and a semi weight station in Nevada. Whatever job paid in cash and as long as I didn’t have to work at night. No matter where I found work I would not stay long before feeling that they were closing in on me. More often than not I would leave before getting a paycheck.”

Up to now he had been talking to me, a captive audience due to the shotgun on his lap for well over four hours. I was tired but Cole seemed to be wide awake. During a moment of silence I asked Cole if he wanted any coffee. He accepted so I made a pot for the two of us to share. 

I could feel Cole stare at me as I made the coffee and my heart was beating so loud I swore Cole was able to hear it. The silence went on for what felt like hours. Finally I couldn't take it anymore and had to break the silence. 

“How do you take your coffee?”

“Very strong. No cream. No sugar.”

As the coffee started brewing, the tension was so thick that it made the room feel as though I was breathing through a hot wet rag. This went on for some time and I think Cole was enjoying the sight of making me uncomfortable because he only continued his story when I started filling the cups.

“Before coming here I was staying at a place up in northern Canada for about three months. A loft above a bar. Figured that a bar full of people at night would keep me safe” Cole said, again fidgeting with the gun. “I had an arrangement with the owner. In exchange for the room, I would work as the janitor, unload trucks, do some deliveries, etcetera. I kept to myself and people left me alone, the only time I was ever bothered was when there was work to be done. It was nice while it lasted, however when they finally arrived they… they were under the window in the alley, softly calling out to me. With all the music being played downstairs I have no idea how long they were there, but the moment I knew it was them the giggling began.”

For some reason, giggling as soon as Cole noticed them creeped me out far more than anything he said so far. 

“They tried to flatter me by saying they were my biggest fans and tried to prove it by telling me details that only the Pass It On Killer would know” Cole said, his eyes looking into the darkened room behind me. 

“I told them off. Called them vampires because they couldn't come inside without permission. That was the first thing I ever said to them and as soon as I said that, everything went silent. I must have been used to the sounds they were making because I didn’t notice it until it stopped. That’s when someone with a strange accent told me that they were not vampires but in fact something else. Something that I---”. 

Cole never finished this thought. In the silence that followed I didn't know what he was going to do and this terrified me. 

It might have been lack of sleep on my part, possibly even momentary insanity but I had to know who, or what was chasing Cole. When I asked he didn't answer so I pressed my luck and asked him a second time 

“What else needs permission to enter a house other than vampires?”

Again he didn't answer and even though I knew it was a mistake to poke the bear I started to ask again. As soon as the words started to leave my mouth Cole reached into his inner breast pocket and pulled out what I thought at the time was paper napkins. After inspecting it for a moment with an expression I have never seen before, Cole slapped them down on the table between us. 

Written on them in everything from pen to marker to pencil were the messages “Let us in”, “Open the door” and more. It was hard to tell what else was said because the writing overlapped. However, it was clear to me that these messages were written by dozens of people.

As I picked one up to look at it closer and ascertain what else was written down on them, my finger rubbed the glossy underside. Turning it over I saw that it was a photograph showing Cole sleeping in what appeared to be a small apartment, the next appeared to be him in an abandoned bus, a dirty attic and so on. 

In some of the pictures Cole looked twenty years younger and it made me wonder just how long he was on the run for. I know that stress can prematurely age people but I had a hard time believing that the person in the picture and Cole were one and the same.

“They don't need permission to enter someone's house” he said as his gaze returned to the empty space behind me. 

I had to look back to see if anything was there and was more relieved than words could explain when I saw nothing behind me.

We sat there quietly for what seemed like an eternity before Cole said anything else. When he did it was as if he suddenly remembered that he was telling me a story and picked up where he left off. The part where they then cut the power to the apartment and the bar under him. 

“It didn’t take long before the woman tending bar that night was shouting at them not to come closer. They just laughed. They tore her apart and all I could do was listen and wait until morning to come” Cole confessed with a shake of his head as if to eject the thoughts from his mind. “Thing is, Canada has some long nights during the winter and I only had enough food for a few days”. 

Cole didn’t tell me how long he stayed in that room for and I didn’t want to ask. It was obvious from the thousand yard stare that these events were still fresh in his mind so I kept my mouth shut.

“When I finally left my room I saw gore sprinkled everywhere. Like a trail of breadcrumbs that started from behind the bar and led right to my apartment. I had seen blood before, but this was something else entirely. I was careful not to touch anything with my bare hands as I emptied the cash register and stole a toolbox from the back office so I could switch license plates to throw them off my scent.”

“Do you know how to kill them?” I asked.

Cole shook his head. “I don’t know how to stop them but I think I have a good idea how to slow them down,” but before he could elaborate he noticed that the sun was shining through my kitchen window. Grateful that he went another night without seeing them and having someone he could talk to, Cole thanked me for listening.

I didn’t know what to say to such a story. What could I say? In the pregnant silence that followed I filled the void by rambling about whatever came to mind. My job, the annoying coworkers and how my boss is always looking over my shoulder. 

As if this was at all similar to Cole's own story.

I didn’t think anything of Cole asking me if I liked my job or where I worked at the time and soon I was answering all of his questions. 

After a short while Cole thanked me again, then he stood up, took my car keys off the counter and left without another word.

It might have been ten minutes after Cole left before I called the police and all I said to them was that my house was broken into and that my car was stolen. After all, the truth was so unbelievable that if I said anything else it might make me look as crazy as Cole. 

Maybe I didn't say anything else because I was tired? I don't know for certain.

The more distance I put between myself and that night the less real it felt. But then reality set in once I learned that my boss was found dead a few days later.

According to the local newspaper, Whisper Alley Echos, pieces of my boss were found all over his bedroom. Most people in town considered this to be an exaggeration to stir up newspaper sales and I wanted to agree but it was hard to, considering Cole's tale. 

In the back of my head the idea of what Cole told me being true kept teasing me. It bothered me so much that I ended up hiring a private investigator, a decision I came to regret. I would rather be ignorant of what came next. A week after hiring the PI, I received a phone call informing me that my boss's head was found in the middle of another bloody mess all the way in Cleveland. 

Not only that, but the private investigator also informed me that the local newspaper apparently withheld the fact that a different person's head was discovered in my boss's freezer. I assume it was the head Cole left in the hotel fridge but kept this to myself.

Over the next few weeks I kept thinking of the story Cole told me. If those thoughts weren't front and center they were creeping in the back, ready to pounce on a happy moment to turn it sour. 

It didn’t take long before I started seeing dark patches dart from one shadow to the next, disappearing as soon as I turned to look at it. At first I chalked this up to being a mouse, the reflection off of my glasses or lack of sleep (After all it was much harder to sleep in a house that was broken into). Hoping it wasn't mice because of my hatred towards them I bought some medicine in town so I could get some rest at night. It worked wonders when it came to getting shuteye but did nothing to stop me from seeing these shadows.

With an embarrassing frequency I would imagine the reflecting eyes on the side of the road were Cole's night visitors or think of them whenever I heard the house settle. 

It was as though toying with the idea of them being real was enough to invite them into my life.

I don’t recall what came first, hearing my name being called out in public, a sound similar to a murder of crows cawing or the soft scraping at my screen windows at night. However once I realized that the noises and the visions were real there was no way to block them out.

At night the soft whispers were hard to make out and the more I tried to ignore them the more I thought about them.  

I could not tell you how many nights I stayed up just so I could put my ear up to the wall but I can tell you it was worth the effort, because unlike Cole, I know what they want. 

They whispered of a message that took months before I understood it fully, but in those words that only someone with a certain madness could grasp, I understood. You see, they aren’t a family like Cole said. They are more akin to nomads who will only accept members with certain propensities to join their roving community.

It wasn't as long as you might think before I did the one thing Cole was never brave enough to do and opened the door. 

The first night I opened the door for them was terrifying, like losing one's virginity. Even with Cole's descriptions there was no way I could have been prepared for their appearance because they resembled humans the way sharks look like dolphins.

During these conversations they instructed me to share Cole's story with the world so some of his madness could rub off on others and “season the meat.”

In this partnership of ours they gained a buffet of people, while I gained so much more. Not only would they tell me tales I would pass off as my own, but in time I could join their ranks. 

Heralding their coming will include everything from seeing shadows in the corner of your eyes, the sounds of whispering and something similar to the cawing of crows.

Okay, so this happened literally yesterday, and it’s been living rent-free in my head ever since.

I was traveling alone on an early morning flight from Delhi to Hyderabad. Since I apparently enjoy suffering, I reached the airport 5–6 hours early. While going through baggage check, I saw this girl, and wow. She had these really enchanting eyes behind glasses, a brown top with a black sweater, black jeans, black sandals, and a little pink purse. She looked effortlessly put together and had this calm, happy energy about her.

We exchanged a couple of quick glances, you know, that awkward, yet-electric kind of eye contact where both people look away too fast but then secretly hope it happens again. And then… she vanished. Probably while my dumb self was still on a phone call.

Fast forward a few hours, I’m at my gate, scrolling aimlessly, sipping coffee, pretending to read. And there she was again. Sitting a few gates away, working on her MacBook, looking like she owned the world. I thought she might be a couple of years older than me, maybe more. We made eye contact again, but I figured she was on another flight.

Boarding starts, and I find my seat, the middle seat, because the universe has jokes. A few minutes later, she walks in and sits right next to me. The aisle seat. My heart actually skipped a beat, and It happened when I least expected.

After takeoff, she started nodding off, and before I knew it, her head was on my shoulder. I froze. Do I wake her up? Do I move? Do I… just exist quietly? I ended up slightly adjusting to make her more comfortable. Eventually, even I fell asleep. Pretty sure at some point we were both just… sleeping on each other like two tired strangers pretending it wasn’t the most unexpectedly wholesome thing ever.

After landing, we walked together to baggage claim. I thought about saying something, anything for that matter. But my introvert brain was like, “Nope, not today.” She grabbed her bag, smiled faintly (I think?), and walked toward the exit while I stayed behind for my connecting flight.

And just like that, she was gone.

Maybe she thought I was shy. Maybe she was shy too. Maybe it was just one of those tiny coincidences life throws at you to make you feel something for no reason.

Anyway, to the girl from the 4:45 AM indigo Delhi–Hyderabad flight yesterday :
""You were really cute. My dumb self was just too nervous to say hi""

PS: I used Chat gpt for refining text

TL;DR :Saw a cute girl at the airport, ended up sitting next to her on my flight, she fell asleep on my shoulder, and I didn’t have the guts to talk to her. Now I can’t stop thinking about it.",3,1762139031.0,delhi,4,1.0,False

Recently, I referred her to my law firm and, although she's a lawyer in a different team, it's become very difficult and suffocating having her around... and I'm seeing her in a very different (negative) light.

Her work ethic is very different to mine and her team is apparently quite gossip-y and toxic (which I didn't know since my team is very pleasant and professional, albeit intense). She started texting me lengthy essays every day about the petty things that happen in her team (which sound like immature high school dramas) and she sounds like a toxic mean girl... very hateful and dismissive (which is out of character for her). 

It almost sounds like they don't do much work either, given that she has so much time to spam me on every social media platform possible during work hours. Most of it is pointless or TMI - like the fact that her coffee was too cold today, or Becky ""stole"" her look by wearing a ponytail to work or she had an uncomfortable morning dump (with details). Why do I need to know this?! And it's 50+ texts basically talking to herself the entire day! She was not like this beforehand. 

I usually do not have the time or capacity to respond to all her messages. If i do respond, it's mostly grey rocking because I don't agree with her constant rants, aggression and pettiness (like I might say ""oh no that sucks - hope it gets better!""). I also politely make my work boundaries, such as reminding her that I don't go on my phone at work (or rarely at all) and that I'm usually very busy at work which requires a lot of focus. She'll respond to this in a polite and understanding way, but her actions will say otherwise...

For example, i'll return to my desk and find her waiting for me. Despite me saying I'm busy, she's now resorted to rocking up at my desk to give me the gossip about a colleague or personal matter (like her dating life) in our OPEN PLAN office, or to follow me up and nudge me to check my phone about some messages she sent earlier. 

If I'm not available at all that day, whether that's being at Court, in meetings, at a work lunch, etc she will proceed to send me texts about how sad she is that I'm not around (for context, I'm not completely neglecting her - we hang out frequently on weekends and with other friends so it's not like I've stopped talking to her entirely). It's even more suffocating when apparently I'm the only person she will talk to at work and refuses to mingle with anyone else.

The worst ""fight"" we've had so far was right before I had a hearing in Court (prep madness while on 0 sleep) she proceeded to try show me funny tiktoks and I kept saying I will watch after Court because I don't have time. To her frustration she kept saying ""it's only quick! it's funny!"" and I had to say ""I'm sorry, but NO"" very loudly and she proceeded to play the videos out loud in the office anyway while I was madly typing/prepping. It was embarrassing, inconsiderate and infuriating. I could feel my whole team looking at me too...

I can't stand her anymore so I muted her on everything she could contact me on. I permanently changed my work accounts to ""busy"" or ""out of office"" which doesn't really work since she'll still hover around my desk. 

I'm also really suss with all this because I'm very mindful and precious of my career. I'm conscious that colleagues will notice her antics (or worse, the horrible things she says about them) and assume I'm part of it. ",3,1762138877.0,EntitledPeople,2,1.0,False

We often perform the role of secondary characters in our own lives, doing little to impact or direct the overall plot. In some cases, we even play the part of the villain by self-sabotaging ourselves. If this sounds like you, then it’s time to recast yourself as the hero of your own life.

The hero’s journey always contains struggle. Without a struggle to overcome, you can’t even be a hero. Be glad that having something to struggle over gives you this opportunity instead of complaining about it.

There are heroic choices constantly being presented to you. Think of how a hero would act when faced by them.

Would a hero introduce himself to a cute girl sitting at a coffee shop, or choose to say nothing and have the opportunity forever slip away?

Would a hero hide his true beliefs and desires, or unapologetically let them be known?

Would a hero work to get better, or instantly give up at the first sign of defeat?

Be a catalyst for things occurring. Organize events. Be the one that asks others to join you in doing something. And if no one else wants to join an activity, be brave enough to still do it by yourself.

Don’t wait for someone or something else to save you. Do your own bit of saving.

Sure its not an original fantasy world like Middle Earth or the Cosmere, but still its very unique and its one of the things that inspired me as a fantasy writer. For one its not the generic ""Chosen One"" stereotype where someone finds a sword or something like that and then the main character meets a princess who is sometimes an elf or something like that.

Also it’s weird in the best possible way. Like, Dragonlance doesn’t care about fitting into your neat little fantasy box, it has  wizards having emotional breakdowns, knights with too much honor for their own good, and kender who make you want to lock up your shiny things and your sanity. It’s messy, dramatic, occasionally tragic, and somehow feels like your chaotic D&D group actually pulled it together long enough to write a novel. Also i love how the main characters and how you see them grow, for example take Raistlin.  This man starts out as this frail, sarcastic wizard who looks like he’s allergic to sunlight and basic kindness, and somehow turns into one of the most complex, morally confusing characters in fantasy. Like, half the time you want to slap him, and the other half you’re like, “Wait… is he right though?” He’s basically what happens if sarcasm and ambition had a baby, then raised it on black coffee and existential dread.

Then there’s Caramon, the ultimate himbo with a heart of gold and a brain made of mashed potatoes sometimes. The way their relationship evolves is just beautiful, it’s tragic and it’s heartwarming. Even Tasslehoff Burrfoot, the walking embodiment of ADHD energy who feels more human than most “serious” fantasy protagonists. He’s stealing things, asking too many questions, and somehow surviving every situation by sheer narrative luck, he's like if chaos had a favorite child. But even the worldbuilding its like you've seen it before but you haven't, like its so beautiful and unique that it would be impossible to truly create a movie like this. I mean we could and it would be awesome to see a movie or series based on ""Dragonlance"" (I mean their has been one but we don't talk about that movie, I'm talking about a real good live action adaptation).

Started with DM-32 UHF/VHF. Best $60 I ever spent. That radio helped me pass both exams just by learning to hit repeaters and program stations. Then came FT991A, the magical HF radio. I bought it because it covered all bands in one set up and that was huge, remembering the initial goal.

  
However, HF has been  nightmare. 4 months in, I almost quit today. I live in condo in Miami. I dreamed of an antenna that worked indoors. Easier said than done. I found a VHF net that checks in every day. I listened at first, then I started participating. An Old HAM offered to give me parts to create a magnetic loop. After watching every talking head on youtube throw random 60ft wires in the grass and talk to Indochina, The Loop, in contrast, seemed like a great option. Neat and effective. It was anything but. 

Mr. Ham invited me over, great dude, however he handed me and dirty grimy variable air capacitor, a 6 inch square recovered board with a coil on it and wire that I had to manually move to change bands. I was in shock, but grateful. I wasn't shy, I said Mr. Ham, look I need simple Loop. I can solder a little, but this isn't what I do. I'm a photographer. 

  
He said here, take this fishing net, he took out of the pile and said make it from this. I grok'd and Chat GPT'd the design and did everything it said to do, with full attention. Mind you, I had  not one tool for this project, every move required a new purchase. It adds up quick. 

Well I built it, love. I followed his instructions for wiring and it didn't register on the radio. So, I redesigned it. Cleaned the capacitor carefully, with the old coke soak and degreaser. These parts must have come from a smokers radio. It was bad dirty. The stators were tough to clean and not bend them. So, it was clean and parts lubed. The wiring was crisp with clean runs and perfect connectors. Hooked it up, not a sound came out of the radio. My waterfall was having a drought. Sooo. I decided to skip the fishing net set up and buy an expensive roll of copper. I don't buy the cheap stuff. I got what I needed to make a long term solution. I was a disaster. I make a 4ft diameter loop, after watching a youtube make one and have great success. Now I'm miserable. Money should fix this problem. 

So, I spent a lot of money on a Loop from AA, the biggest baddest custom Coax I could  buy, and it was a bust indoors and out. I dug a hole climbed in and consoled myself with ""you're new to this"". Yep new, but quitting wasn't an option, I'm competitive and balls deep in this now.  

So, it was back to the UPS store for a return sticker. Indoor was a fading dream, fresh flowers left in vase for far too long. Now, I just needed to make HF contact, basic balun and wire for inside test and learning.. I could hear some but couldn't transmit. My AI friends said get an OHM meter, didn't have one and now more money to test everything. 

Balun read .000 my ""AI advisors"" said if it's not OL, it's bad.  Back to Amazon, for a 1/64.. It came, it also read .000. I assumed it was bad also. Amazon sent another. It tested the same, 000. My faith, and trust for AI was gone. 

I was beginning to realize the FT991A antenna tuner wasn't doing the job. So, Amazon here i come again. Ordered the tuner. 

I set it up in the house and got signal right away. I still couldn't transmit. What I could do was set my $400 SMEG coffee maker on fire. I did it like a pro. Total electrical fire. 

On accident, I switched the CW- MOV mode ""on"" to auto transmit, to tune the antenna. It was on 100 watts. I heard eggs frying and smelled smoke. Thick black smoke. I was in disbelief, my power source was a Bluetti battery, not even plugged in the wall. 

RF is no joke.  

My with is with me, in regards to, preparing for future bullshit. We are both aware. She's from a  rich country destroyed by Socialism. We have a few things just incase. However, she isn't fond of setting the house on fire .  

Why Ham? well, being  prior service and  movies like Quiet Place, 40 Acres and others, use radio when fragile systems fail. It makes sense to us and well we've had weeks with no power during storms. HAM seemed like the right move. 

After making a longer 25ft Coax( for counterpoise ) and putting that together. 

Today was the day. New A-tuner, Coax, 1/64, 550 cord to sling in the trees. I had a gallon coffee, I was ready. 

  
I got everything up and NO JOY, nothing but static. I was out of my mind. I see youtube potato heads making contacts globally and I could yell clearer than my signal. 

I have 500ft of wire cut to every length my AI Advisors said to do. 

  
My only focus today was 20m with a wire to match. At first, nothing. 2 hours in I was ready to pack it up. However, I made 4 contacts and heard a bunch of contesting, which doesn't interest me all. 

The one NET I want to communicate with started at 5pm. The Caribbean and South American. When they started, we could hear them, but when I tried to transmit, the SWR meter pegged and radio gave a warming. WHY?????? We've been here for 2.5 hours hanging out. We didn't touch anything but the dial. Why isn't this working?? We've spoken to people in Maine, TN, NC,and IN and heard many other states today. Why is the radio NOW not performing?? 

HF is not fun at all for me at the moment. I read and watch videos, I put in a lot of effort.     I research and follow instructions. It's been misery:)

I see people having success with  random wire tied to goat, pure madness. 

 However, I'm done spending. Is it really this hard?

Have you dealt with this? 

What's the solution? 

Work arounds?

Magic Trick?

	•	Fast dolly shots gliding past gas pumps, reflections in car windows.
	•	Wide cinematic shots catching the Wawa sign and orange autumn trees.
	•	Medium handheld shots for intensity and realism.
	•	Close-ups on Diana’s face, her earrings swinging, breath visible in the cold air.
	•	Cutaways to locals reacting, kids on bikes, and a man walking out with a hoagie.

Lighting & Tone:
Golden-hour sunlight mixed with fluorescent gas station lights, giving a warm-meets-cool cinematic glow. Tone is darkly comedic, raw, authentic Delco pride—gritty but charming.

1on0klw,https://www.afr.com/companies/retail/how-shoplifting-became-the-crime-of-the-nation-20250827-p5mqa0,We met a professional shoplifter to understand this crime’s popularity,"Steve \* first went to juvenile detention when he was 12 years old and between then and now, in the arc from puberty to middle age, he’s spent 16 years behind bars. That’s given him plenty of time to ponder the profits and pitfalls of risk versus reward. His preferred crime used to be breaking into commercial premises and shops where he’d pick open safes for the cash, or plunder cartons of cigarettes. “Don’t ever buy a safe from Bunnings,” he advises, “cause they’re f---ing terrible, they’re so unsafe it’s not funny.”

The rewards for this crime were often very high. “I could get 600 to 800 packets of cigarettes and I’d get $28 a packet,” he says. But the risks were considerable, and he’s ticked them off on a prison wall. There’s surveillance cameras and DNA testing and teams of detectives on your tail. “The penalties,” he says, “are full on.”

Tall and wiry, Steve, 43, habitually tinkles a spoon in his coffee as he chats with The Australian Financial Review Magazine outside a cafe in Woolloomooloo, not far from the terrace house he grew up in, and where he still lives. Miraculously, this patch of harbourside public housing has survived, a relic from when the inner city was a slum, although the Woolloomooloo of today is very different from the suburb of his childhood, with its brothels and the then-drug bazaar of Kings Cross next door. He first tried heroin at 15. “A lot of kids like me didn’t have a father around,” he says. “A lot of the parents were junkies and alcoholics. And the kids around here were just bad little thieves.”

One of the skills he acquired, back when he was one of those “bad little thieves”, was how to shoplift. The rewards were lower than his preferred activity of breaking and entering, but so too were the risks if he got caught. Shoplifting became his bread and butter. If Steve was asked to fill out a form and list his occupation since his teens, it would say “professional shoplifter”. He pulls up a photo on his phone. It’s a picture of a large birthday present wrapped in sky-blue paper with a blue bow and a big red envelope for the card. He flicks through a couple more photos to reveal that, when flipped open, the box is lined with hairdressing foil. This, he explains, was his shoplifting box. He’d walk into a store, lift the card and fill it with whatever he’d been tasked to steal. The foil lining muted the security tags.

Many tens of thousands of dollars worth of stolen goods were carried out of stores in this foil-lined gift box. He’d drive from Sydney to Wollongong, or up to Newcastle, pulling into shopping centres and stealing goods to order – baby formula, medicines, creams, vitamins – from Coles, Woolworths and Chemist Warehouse. On his best day, he got $6000 for the goods he stole, “taking them to a Chinese bloke at Ashfield” who would ship them to China. He spent the money on heroin. If he had any left over, after shooting up, he’d pour it into the pokies at the many pubs of Woolloomooloo. “If I’d have bought shares in Aristocrat, instead of feeding their machines, I’d be a f----n’ millionaire,” he says.

In practice, Steve says, shoplifting has been decriminalised. “These crims know that. And they’ll run with it until something changes.” It’s a view he shares with many of the country’s highest-paid executives helming our biggest retailers.

One of the first to sound the alarm about what has become one of the biggest retail trends of the 2020s was Coles chief executive Leah Weckert. In August 2023, at the company’s results, Weckert said theft had risen by 20 per cent over the previous year, so much so that it was affecting margins. She was a lone voice at the time. No longer.

The FY2025 reporting season that’s just passed will be remembered as the Season of Lightfingers. Wesfarmers chief Rob Scott told investors that gangs had become a major problem, targeting expensive power tools at Bunnings and tech products at Officeworks. He called for a crackdown by police and tougher laws, particularly in Victoria, to combat the theft and violence. “The vast majority of the threatening situations that are impacting customers and team members are actually perpetrated by organised crime gangs,” he said.

Anthony Heraghty, when CEO of Super Retail – owner of Rebel, Supercheap Auto, BCF and Macpac – said “industrial-scale theft” had been the driving force behind a 7.6 per cent fall in net profit. He echoed Scott in saying Victoria was the centre of the problem. “This is not kids stuffing a T-shirt into a schoolbag,” he told the Financial Review in August. “This is gangs taking tens of thousands of dollars’ worth of stock, threatening staff, and then reselling online.”

Such is the problem of abuse and assault to staff that the company is trialling body cameras. Woolworths CEO Amanda Bardwell reported a 26 per cent rise in violent incidents at its supermarkets in the past year, many related to shoplifting and some involving knives. Myer executive chairwoman Olivia Wirth in September said her business has spent $25 million in two years in an attempt to minimise the targeting of cosmetics, perfumes, Lego and Tommy Hilfiger. Incidents of staff being threatened had risen by an alarming 80 per cent.

This retail crime wave is likely to get worse before there’s a turnaround, Matt Swindells, Coles’ chief of operations and supply chain, tells AFR Magazine. Organised crime gangs began targeting retailers two years ago and the losses have been staggering. “If I gave you a number, you’d be horrified,” he says. Coles has spent “a couple of hundred million dollars” in the past two years in an attempt to arrest it. Before COVID, Swindells says, losses from theft were seen as part of doing business. But now, it’s cutting deep into company profits. “There’s almost a commercial operating model behind it. They know who their end customer is before they come to us.”

Teams of thieves come in with lists and “sweep” entire sections of meat, beauty products, electric toothbrushes or medicines, and blatantly wheel it out. Retail crime, he says, is vastly more acute in his home state of Victoria than in any other state, “and the gap between second from the bottom and bottom is big – it’s not a small gap”. The state is home to a quarter of the population, yet Coles’ data indicates a whopping 71 per cent of its organised crime losses occur in its Victorian stores.

Intelligence gathered by Coles security staff, and handed over to police, recently uncovered a syndicate of more than 100 alleged thieves in Victoria. The syndicate had been tracked and mapped, working in various and ever-changing groups, stealing products to order. It led to police arresting 19 people for stealing more than $10 million worth of baby formula, medicines, skincare products and toiletries from supermarkets across Melbourne. The alleged thieves were mostly on student or temporary visas from India. The receiver, the criminal kingpin, was suspected of either shipping the stolen goods overseas, on-selling them to smaller retailers in Australia or simply hocking them on Facebook Marketplace.

One offender in an unrelated case, identified by Coles, stole more than half a million dollars worth of stock from its stores. Despite the widely held belief that things were rosier in the olden days, there’s actually been a decline in property crime. According to a 2016 study published in the Australian Journal of Social Studies, between 1974 and 2000, rates of robbery, theft and break-and-enter rose year after year, almost without interruption. And then it fell, drastically. By 2014, robbery was down by 63 per cent compared with 2000, burglary fell by 69 per cent and motor vehicle theft fell 62 per cent.

How did it happen? In 2016, when the study was published, Australia had experienced 25 consecutive years of continuous economic growth. Unemployment, particularly affecting youth, had fallen dramatically and kids were staying at school longer and more were going on to university. The glut of cheap heroin, which peaked in 2000, began to decline. Cars became almost impossible to hotwire. Policing became more professional and moved from being reactive, to proactively targeting offenders using DNA testing and CCTV. An avalanche of cheap goods from China meant stolen stereos and televisions – and almost everything else in your house – became virtually worthless to thieves.

And then in 2020, Australia’s three decades of continuous economic growth came to an abrupt halt. The lockdowns, the panic, the mandates, the isolation and the weirdness of COVID led to an unravelling at the edges. It was followed by high inflation. Grocery prices soared, as did rent, electricity and petrol bills. Many feared for their jobs. Bunnings managing director Michael Schneider says something changed during that time.

“I don’t know what it was in our society that people were short-focused or frustrated or out of work, and maybe there was a shift from physical interaction to digital interaction, and people got used to writing things on keyboards, and being courageous from the kitchen table or bedroom. But definitely, post-pandemic, we have seen a really steady rise in crimes and in aggressive behaviour.”

Swindells says grocery stores and their workers were seen as heroes during the pandemic, keeping the country fed. For a time, shoplifting plummeted. But then inflation took off, and supermarkets were accused of price gouging. Their frontline staff felt the wrath. “We went from being essential services heroes to inflationary economic villains,” he says. “It swung really quickly.” Since the lockdowns of 2020, rates of residential theft, residential burglary and car theft have either stagnated or declined. But retail theft or shoplifting has almost doubled.

According to criminologist Michael Townsley, a professor at Griffith University, there’s been a great shift from house burglary and car theft to retail crime, and organised crime has followed the thieves. “The reward for a crime like house burglary, and other acquisitive crime, has really plummeted,” Townsley says. House burglary is a difficult, risky crime, particularly with more people working at home. “Whereas retailers, they’re welcoming. If it’s a department store, it’s really porous with multiple exits. It’s perfect if you want to get in and out quickly. And there’s all this gear, all out on display.”

Accompanying the rapid rise in retail theft has been an escalation of violence and abuse towards frontline staff, as evidenced by those “treat our staff with respect” signs now Blu-Tacked on shop entrances and at points of sale everywhere. The soldiers on the front line in this battle include 17-year-old school kids at Rebel Sport, 20-year-old Nepalese students at Bunnings, and 63-year-old grandmothers, topping up their super before retirement with shifts at the FoodWorks checkout.

Carly, an 18-year-old service supervisor at an inner-city Coles in Sydney, has been working in the store for three years and is now at university. “There’s just lots of people who get really frustrated,” she says, often at the smallest things, such as price discrepancies. “They’ll shout at you and berate you, even when they’re wrong. You feel very intimidated and shaken.” She says it’s often older people in their “50s and 60s” who are the most abusive. “We call them the Karens and the Kevins,” she says. “There’s lots of Indian and Nepalese workers in the store and people are really racist towards them.”

If the current trajectory of crime is not corrected, the future of supermarket shopping will look like Maribyrnong Coles, in Melbourne’s inner north-west. This is the retail giant’s “loss innovation store” where its boffins and crime fighters get to try out their new kit. It’s here in the aisles and checkouts that new anti-theft technologies such as gates at the checkouts are put into play and, if they work, they’ll be rolled out soon to a supermarket near you.

One recent Tuesday morning, AFR Magazine was given a tour, accompanied by a platoon of Coles’ national chiefs of innovation, security, technology and staff safety. The tech, we’re told, is designed to not affect “customer experience”.

We are shown first to the meat section, a prized target for thieves, particularly expensive cuts of steak. Above the meat cabinets are television monitors that stream high-definition images of everyone approaching, signalling to potential thieves they’re being watched. A brand-new technology, “weighted shelving”, will detect if anyone “sweeps” a shelf, quickly taking a large volume of meat (legitimate shoppers tend to examine one tray of rump at a time). For our benefit, a Coles executive deploys the tactics of a thief, swiftly removing three or four packets of steak. An alarm rings in the store and over the loudspeaker a voice says: “CCTV cameras operate in this store for your safety.”

That alarm is picked up by the store security guard and by the centralised Coles operation centre. Body cameras on the uniformed guards are activated (other frontline staff wear body cameras too). The guards will attempt to get the person to pay, but, like most Coles staff, the store guards are trained to “de-escalate” situations and to avoid putting themselves in danger.

Coles now also has teams of covert security guards who are specially trained for the task, including the tricky legalities when making apprehensions. There are detection lasers in the vitamin and deodorant sections that trigger alarms. The expensive cosmetics sit behind clear cabinets. “Press to open” says a sign next to a button. A monitor at the checkout shows the person wanting access, and if there are suspicions, access is denied.

The Coles security team, like those of other major retailers, uses a retail crime intelligence platform called Auror that records theft and violence and helps the retailers to identify prolific offenders, organised networks and crime trends. Coles also employs its own crime analysts who track repeat offenders attached to syndicates pilfering tens of millions of dollars worth of stock.

They’ve also got professional surveillance teams who will follow known thieves after they’ve left the store, we are told by the security staff. These thieves steal to order from detailed lists of specific brands. It might be a particular brand of baby formula favoured in China or a make of electric toothbrush sought after in Vietnam. The heads of crime syndicates have dozens of thieves working for them, bringing in many trolley-loads of stolen goods daily. Stolen goods worth many tens of millions of dollars flow through the hands of these crime bosses.

There is a seemingly endless supply of people willing to shoplift, we are informed, and many steal to support their drug habits. The aim of the security staff is to “cut off the head of the snake”, the syndicate’s criminal kingpin. And when this person is taken out, they see a dramatic and instant reduction in crime in their stores. But that noose tightens slowly, and sometimes not at all.

The Coles security staff say there have been instances where they’ve taken evidence to police of a major syndicate in action, including the address of where the stolen goods are warehoused, and with information, videos and photos about the thieves and kingpin. “It’s all wrapped up in a bow,” we are told. It then may take six months for the police to act, while the security staff watch on as their stores “get pounded” day after day.

Lincoln Wymer has been working in supermarkets for 33 years, since he got a job “on the trolleys” in Year 12, and now manages a supermarket chain with two IGAs and 23 FoodWorks, mainly in Victoria. The recent rise in shoplifting and violence in his shops, he says, has been astronomical. “I’m getting as many phone calls a week from my team \[about shoplifting and violent incidents\] that I used to get in six months,” he says. He ticks off the knife attacks, the abuse, the gas bottles through windows, and says these violent thefts not only cut into profitability but take a terrible toll on his staff who are frightened to come to work. Some can’t come back and others are on long-term “mental distress” leave.

His store managers will regularly call the police, he says, but officers rarely come to the store, unless there is an assault on a staff member. Small supermarkets like FoodWorks can’t afford security guards, weighted shelves, locking gates and clear cupboards with all their beauty products locked away. They are at the mercy of the thieves, with a police force that, Wymer says, rarely turns up to investigate theft. “There’s just got to be some consequences . . . the system is broken.” When the big supermarkets introduce new measures, like trolley locks or gates, there’s an increase in theft in his stores.

He directs AFR Magazine to the IGA at Werribee, in Melbourne’s south-west, to talk to its manager, Leigh Campbell, and duty manager Heather Markovic. “This used to be a nice place to live,” says Campbell. “And now it’s just gone to shit, and there’s a lot of junkies.” What’s changed, they say, is the brazenness of the thieves. Years ago, police used to attend every shoplifting incident. Now, it’s only if there’s violence. Back in the day, they say, if they approached a shoplifter, the person would shamefully hand over the stolen goods and leave. Now, they tell the staff to “f--- off” and walk out with a trolley full of goods, knowing the staff are trained not to intervene and police will not attend.

In a besser-brick office out the back of the store, Markovic pulls up a video of one of their regular thieves. He’s a big, solid man who heads straight to the store’s bottle shop, where he puts a six-pack of beer in a cloth shopping bag. He grabs another beer off the shelf and opens it. The man wanders out past the checkout, sipping on the beer. An employee behind the counter says something, and the man stops, takes a swig from the can and then raises it towards the employee, as if to say “cheers”. He casually strolls out through the front door with a free beer in one hand and stolen six-pack in the other.

So how do retailers change the equation to increase the risks and lower the rewards for brazen crooks? South Australia and Western Australia are preparing to adopt the ACT’s system of “workplace protection orders” which ban repeat offenders from stores in a manner that’s akin to personal safety intervention orders that protect victims of family violence. Retailers in the ACT can gather evidence such as staff and witness statements as well as security camera footage and apply to a magistrate for an order banning someone from their store for 12 months. If granted, the order is served by police on the offender and if they come to the relevant store they can be arrested on the spot.

Woolworths has applied for 14 workplace orders in the ACT since February 2024 and said it had recorded a 99.6 per cent reduction in reoffending. Overall crime at Woolworths’ stores in the ACT fell 23 per cent compared to last year. NSW Premier Chris Minns has said he’s looking closely as the ACT laws. Victoria, however, has refused to adopt them.

Retailers are also clamouring for facial recognition technology (FRT), to identify professional thieves as soon as they enter their stores. Chris Rodwell, CEO of the Australian Retailers Association, says it is vital that regulators work with retailers to responsibly deploy FRT to protect frontline workers and customers from violence and abuse. The retailers point to a 2024 trial in New Zealand where, in 25 supermarkets over six months, FRT was used to identify repeat offenders.

The trial was overseen by the Office of the Privacy Commissioner, which reported that the technology reduced “serious harmful behaviours” by 16 per cent, and led to a 21 per cent reduction in shoplifting. But the NZ privacy commission, as might be expected, does not see FRT as a silver bullet. “It is hard to overstate the privacy implications of a technology that, if widely deployed in supermarkets, would capture images and process the faces of millions of New Zealanders going about their daily lives,” its report said. “The risks of overcollection, scope creep, surveillance, misidentification and bias are well documented.”

Cameras above Woolworths’ self-checkouts. The company reported a 26 per cent rise in violent incidents at its supermarkets in the past year, many related to shoplifting and some involving knives. 

In Australia, both Bunnings and Kmart have been sanctioned by the nation’s privacy commissioner for illegally capturing the biometric details of “hundreds of thousands of individuals” in their stores through FRT and were ordered to cease the practice. Bunnings is appealing against the finding. “It’s time for stronger protections and smart technology, like the responsible use of FRT, to keep people safe,” says managing director Schneider. Swindells, from Coles, says he would take facial recognition technology if it was available, but that it’s “not in my top 10 priorities” because the technology “doesn’t replace a trusted legal system and a supported police force”.

Should we allow for all of us to be surveilled whenever we’re out at the shops? “The use of facial recognition in public spaces is a pretty significant change in the way that our society has been run,” says Carly Kind, the privacy commissioner. “The current law sets quite a high bar for using technologies like this, and in my view for good reason. If the bar is going to be lowered, it should be through legislation and a proper democratic process.”

When we ask Steve to show us his old shoplifting box, he says he doesn’t know where it is. “I think Mum chucked it out,” he says. He’s no longer in the game, having eventually gotten into a rehab program and gotten off heroin (as well as quitting the pokies). “I’d just thought that that was my life, that I was a crim,” he says. “It’s still really hard, but I’m not an addict now. I can save money and I can do things with it,” he says. “They need more rehabs instead of more jails. Jail is f---ing terrible.” There will be fewer shoplifters, Steve reckons, if there are more off-ramps for people like him seeking help with drug addiction. That said, he agrees with the retail executives that it should be harder to steal.

The states, meanwhile, are beefing up their approach to dealing with organised crime’s fondness for five-finger discounts. In NSW, police have appointed Detective Inspector Phil Hallinan to co-ordinate a “new retail crime strategy” to take on the “co-ordinated groups, the co-ordinated syndicates” that have moved into high-end retail theft and to go after the receivers. “Ten per cent of offenders account for 62 per cent \[of stock losses\],” he says. His unit is concentrating on that 10 per cent.

South Australia, which has the lowest rates of retail theft, has a collaborative body that has digital reporting protocols, and police that are quick to respond and have a dedicated retail crime squad. It also has meaningful punishments for offenders. “It’s proven what works,” Swindells says, approving of the SA approach. Last year, assault, threats and abuse in Coles’ Victorian stores rose 45 per cent. In SA, they fell 13 per cent.

Victoria has passed new bail laws to make it more difficult for repeat offenders, and is increasing penalties for people who abuse retail staff. The decision to lift penalties came after more than 20 major retailers co-signed a letter to Victorian Premier Jacinta Allan in late August, warning that urgent reform was needed to address the growing impact of retail crime on the state.

Victoria Police declined a number of requests to interview Chief Commissioner Mike Bush, or other senior officers overseeing retail crime. Police Minister Anthony Carbines initially agreed to a request for an interview, but then his staff cancelled and said we’d have to submit questions in writing. When we did, the minister would not address questions about why things were so bad in Victoria.

According to Swindells, Victoria has the most questions to answer. “The process for us to report crime in Vic is so antiquated,” he says. “A store manager has to go to a police station to report retail crime. There’s no IT system. It’s archaic.” And the sentences handed out in Victoria, compared with other states, “are as anemic as it gets” which leads to “the same people just continually performing the same crime without any real consequence”.

He doesn’t believe Victoria is doing enough to punish offenders or to support its police, and that theft is getting worse. “We’re becoming the crime state of the nation . . . I’m passionate about this because it’s my team members in stores and I want to keep them safe,” Swindells says. “I’m also a dad with two boys who work in Coles. They’ve rung me because things have happened in the store that should never happen. It is unacceptable.”",2,1762138062.0,aussie,1,1.0,False

I ranked Alkemia with a few other people as well, so I'll provide multiple inputs! **I will put it in my order but add an \*asterisk\* if there was disagreement or if it is not my taste but has potential.** I am not reviewing how they smell on me, just in the bottle. I will also edit it if some improve with time. Google also was crashing so I kept having to rewrite these ....

I'm looking for a petrichor scent, so reccomendations are appreciated! I describe my petrichor taste when reviewing Tempestarii. I like musky, rich, and woody scents. Also more foresty, amber, or incense smells. I like some gourmands but generally do not like scents like  chocolate, popcorn, caramel or other very food reminiscent scents. I do not like florals, but my friends do, so I'll show their input.

**Alkemia** (intro set) - Silken tent, gothique, elixir of aphrodite, arabesque, enigma, moss maiden, lilacs along the winding drive, luminae, cherries of the night

Free samples: afterglow, fallen snow angels

**Demeter** \- thunderstorm 

**Andromeda's Curse** \- Firefly Hollow, the tower, wyvern, tempestarii, sea of trees, the magician, death, blood moon, neptune, venus

Free samples: Hot chocolate and candy canes, wheel of fortune

\- Some of these bottles were insanely hard to open and sea of trees broke :(

\- A considerable number of these smelled pretty sunscreeny; I'll put **S next to it if it smelled like sunscreen**

**Le Labo** \- Baie 19

This list is in order from most liked to least liked.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

***WOW that is amazing***

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

1. **Silken tent - Alkemia**

If you have ever smelled Amika Perk Up Dry Shampoo, it is so similar to this perfume, just minus the typical dry shampoo smell. If you haven't smelled that, this is honestly one of the harder ones to describe. I think it is just a scent everybody could love, super inoffensive. It is the fragrance of a pretty girl walking by, and you double-take to ask, ""What is that perfume?"" It is welcoming and pretty/gorgeous, not sexy/cute. It is so rich in a caramel type of way, layered with mild spices. There is one note I am struggling with; it is almost between a floral and peach smell, and it just adds a more delicate note into the rich caramel.

2) **Firefly Hollow - Andromeda's curse**

It is just so nostalgic to camping. It isn't the stereotypical scent of a raging campfire; however, it is still a camp air scent, like a while after the campfire has gone out, but without the smoky note. It smells like you are surrounded by pine trees with the crisp-aired starry night that comes with the end of the campfire. There is also a kind of smell that reminds me of walking into a Lush store—not super strong, but it is noticeable. This scent will probably go lower in rank because as it sits it is leaning to be a more Lush bathbombs type of scent. :(

3) **Gothique - Alkemia\***

I personally really like the incensy nature of this but could see people disagreeing; nobody in the group hated this scent, but it wasn't as favored for them as it was for me. This one is harder to describe. I would describe it as entering a fortune teller's tent who is definitely a maximalist and has an eye for unique items. Alternatively, a flea market where each shop is close to the other and connected by draped cloth roofs with a brick floor; it is a very maximalist scent, which feels cozy (in an incense way) and small.

4) **Elixir of Aphrodite - Alkemia**

PEACHES. Really gorgeous peaches. It is summer, and you just had the juiciest peach ever. It lies in between a real and fake peach smell but leans way more realistic, just with a little exaggeration, which I personally think is a perfect blend. There is also a slight bubblegum scent at the base while the peach is hovering on top. The website does say it is an apricot scent, but I could see it interpreted as peach or apricot. I think overall it gives the vibe of juicy fruit in general, not even just limited to peach. If this helps, the closest scent I have to Elixir of Aphrodite is Skylar's Peach Fields which smells a lot more like peach leaves of sorts and the atmosphere around and is definitely more of an artificial peach—I prefer Alkemia's.

5) **Sea of Trees - Andromeda's Curse**

It is a very soft-wood scent. It is like walking into a green grassy field surrounded by tall, white, skinny trees. You can smell every single plant and each leaf. It is spring, and although the sky is blue the shade from the leaves leads it to be a darker but still light atmosphere. Since the circle of trees surrounds you and the leaves cover the sky, it leads you to feel like you are in a small area in the forest that is all yours. It feels personal and like you are by yourself but satisfied. It has a water-like feel; it hasn't just rained, but the forest is so lush that it has retained water, and the grass is therefore cold and fluffy.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

***I like these perfumes***

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

6) **Fallen Snow Angels - Alkemia**

I actually really quite like this one; it is definitely a seasonal winter scent. It could be worn at different times if you really wanted to, though. It does smell like thin mints to me, which could be positive or negative, to be honest. It is also like peppermint gum with chocolate way in the distance. It is very peppermint-based, but there are accents, which keep the scent unique and fun. Overall, it is a solid winter scent but not my personal choice for an everyday scent.

7) **Moss maiden - Alkemia \***

It captures the spicy sweetness of damp moss and soil perfectly. It is like walking into a green mossy forest where the sky is blocked by tall tree's leaves and the damp mulch + moss squishes as you walk on it. Some trees are collapsed and have became damp and have already started decaying back into the earth. Achieves what it is supposed to perfectly with no weird scents! Another person I smelled this with was obsessed, it genuinely captures the damp, mossy, woodsy, forest so well, highly reccomend! It isn't higher because it isn't my dream scent but for what it is it is perfect.

8) **Wyvern - Andromeda's Curse**

A subtle, but elegant/sexy scent. The base is black pepper which gives it a slightly spicy base. Getting a little massage oil smell but it isnt too overpowering and I can smell the incense as well. It smells like whatever a female wyvern would smell like, this one is spot on to how it is described so there isn't much to add!

9)??? **Arabesque - Alkemia \***

Hands down the most confusing scent ever. Initial smell was just so sweet I hated it, then second smell I fell in love. I hate sweet scents but I was intrigued by the sweet wood type of scent. I honestly could rank this anywhere beacuse I don't really know what is going on. To me it smells like sweet wood and licorice and I really dig it but the sweetness can be weird and I do not think it is a wearble scent. I think this is one of the most unique scents and is a rarer scent to find.

10) **Tempestarii - Andromeda's Curse**

This scent definitely achieves wet grass. It is like sitting in the hot sun in the grass at a summer camp. The grass was watered hours before by the sprinklers and it is just barely damp. I could see it faintly smelling like rain in the summer but the petrichor notes aren't that strong so it falls to smell more like sprinklers than actual rain. It overall suprised me of how green and summerish the scent was. I prefer petrichor scents which are based on the crisp atmosphere of the rainy air and maybe even the smell of rain hitting the concrete, this is quite the opposite so I therefore did not care for it as much.

11) **The Magician - Andromeda's Curse**

Saunf candy. Which is basically sugar-coated fennel seeds + fennel seeds. It is at Indian restaurants a lot, and that is exactly what it smells like to me. Smells great, but it just depends if you like fennel or not!

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Scents I don't hate but don't love**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

12) **Blood moon - Andromeda's Curse**

I probably ranked this higher than I should I have because it smells like old roses that haven't fully rotted but are getting there and it has a spiciness that burns the nose like smelling a lot of bug-spray does. I just love how unique it is and I know somebody could pull this off.

13) **Afterglow- Alkemia \***

This smells like how just getting a massage smells like. The faint spiciness and rose, the oils, and a lotion type of smell, it is literally identical. It isn't a bad scent but it is kind of a weird scent to wear out because of its resemblance with spa scents. It could probably be achieved using stuff good for your skin which would last longer and be good for you as well so I think it is redundant.

14) **Thunderstorm - Demeter\***

Didn't really know where to place this one, to be honest, because it smells like freshly sprinkled grass and just raw DIRT. However, not in a positive way; it's kind of just an odd scent that is interesting to smell but not really wearable. I like scents that are dirty, but this is just almost too realistic to be worn. It doesn't smell like petrichor at all to me, however, which brought it back a little more. It is over Baie 19 because it is closer to achieving what it advertises since it does achieve earthy notes, and you can smell the water droplets on the grass. It also layers suprisingly well, not sure why, so it is useful for that.

15) **Baie 19 - La Labo**

A solid scent, sure, but I do not get ANY petrichor vibes. To me it is a musky, clean—but not aquatic—scent. Overall, it isn't a special scent for me, and for the hefty price tag it has I don't think it is worth it, but I don't dislike the smell.

16) **The Tower- Andromeda's Curse (S)**

Smells like the waiting room of a darkly lit spa with black walls and hardwood floors. Also I can weirdly imagine a fishtank there, probably the minor aquatic notes, and the uniqueness of the way that fishtanks glow blue and cast that cool shadow. It smells like a modern scent to me and like just a really cool designed spa. It would be higher if there wasn't a sun-screen smelling base.

17) **Death - Andromeda's Curse (S)\***

It doesn't remind me of death but it is a cold, sad scent. It has florals which are a bit weird for me but that is my own preference. Basically it has incense, floral, and tea which comes to form a spicy sad scent. I think it is the coldest, saddest scent which is fitting but the way it is achieved isn't to my taste, for wearability that is also a struggle. Again I do get a little bit of sunscreen which I am not liking.

18) **Neptune- Andromeda's Curse (S)**

It smells like a hotel room, specifically one near the beach, but it doesn't have a salt note or an aquatic one. It is like a linen room spray, which is very light. It does have a slight sunscreen scent, but not nearly as bad as some of the others, and it doesn't clash with the overall vibe of the scent.

19) **Lilacs along the winding drive - Andromeda's Curse\***

I was the odd one out on this one, and I think it is because I do not care for florals. It is like smelling a very strong-smelling lilac, very realistic. I also got a little bubblegum, but it was a minor accompanying scent. It is simple: if you like florals, you will probably like this scent; if you don't, you probably won't. I didn't think it smelled bad by any means; I'm just not a fan of floral. For people who liked florals they ranked this pretty high!

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**I don't like**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

20) **Wheel of Fortune - Andromeda's Curse\***

This is going to be VERY specific; it smells like a christmas candle warmer or a christmas candle. It is the red christmas scents and is not like the evergreen or green scents at all. Specifically a christmas red Yankee Candle, which I do not recall the name of. Nutmeg, vanilla, caramel just really all the christmasy spices I could smell I smelt in this. There is one additional note which smells like a specific Bath & Body Works Wallflower I had when I was younger that I was OBSESSED with. It was a strong, perfumey apple scent. The reason why it is so low is because this scent is everywhere, quite strong, and I don't know how wearable it is. If you like food scents this might actually be pretty enjoyable, though.

21) **Hot Chocolate and Candy Canes - Andromeda's Curse\***

I think it is an inferior version of Fallen Snow Angels. It focuses more on chocolate/coffee (?) notes than mint notes, whilst Fallen Snow Angels focuses on mint. The chocolate scent is definitely artificial. If you prefer a more chocolate-based scent, however, you would probably prefer this one. It is like candy-cane chunks in hot chocolate, very true to its name.

22) **Luminae - Alkemia (S)**

This one's description is the furthest from what I smelled; to me it was quite strong. This is a different variation of Wheel of Fortune, but it lacks the Bath & Body works Wallflower note, so it is more one-dimensional. I do think this scent is going to change over time, though; I already smell a small shift to a more vanilla scent and even, concerningly, a bit more sunscreeny.

23) **Enigma - Alkemia**

I personally just smell straight Elmer's glue it even captures the slight sourness that glue has. Besides that it is just a generic masculine scent. Not everybody smelled the glue but even if they didn't it wasn't rated highly it is just a weird scent and not in a good way.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**No.**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

24) **Venus - Andromeda's Curse\* (S)**

This smells like nacho cheese to me. it just has a weird saltiness to me. I also smelled strong sunscreen which makes it smell like an amusement park, but in a weird way that isn't positive. I showed it to one other person, and they didn't get that, but even so, they didn't like the smell.

25) **Cherries of the Night - Andromeda's Curse\***

This smells like cherry medicine and honestly makes me sick when I smell it. It is such a medicinal syrupy cherry and makes me gag when I smell it. I love cherry scents usually but this was rough. Everyone agreed except one person who actually ranked this more in the mid ranks and I have no clue why.

Whether to drown the sorrows of the world out or to explore their primal desires. All needs were exploited by the neon sign.

Off to the side of the local watering hole, in the parking lot, sat the hunter and its prey. Eyes followed every movement of the target, examining each step from the brushing of their hair to stepping out of their orange convertible. Silently the stalker sat, waiting until the black industrial door shut behind them, sealing their prey’s fate.  
  
In the blood red convertible across the lot sat the stalker, their mind ran over the steps they so carefully thought of. The poison, the interaction, the witnesses, every piece had to be in their place at the right time. This was of no concern to the chasseur, maybe if this was their first time the mind would race and beads of sweat would appear on the palms. This, however, was far from their first time, many before had fallen into their web. Their soul lifted from this earth, their body given a new purpose.  
  
After a long and well deserved cigarette, the hunter decided to move into the bar. Walking up the red neon sign glowed, staring at the heedless killer. The glass tube working outlined the shape of a beautiful showgirl, her breasts round and perky like a mountain. Beside it the glass calligraphy spelt out the name of the establishment, “The Siren’s Song”.  
  
The metal creaked open but no one heard or saw the predator enter, their ears could hear but their eyes chose not to look. Couples surrounded the bar kissing sloppily, saliva dripping off the corners of their mouth. Men gathered near their short term lovers, awkwardly grinding and dry humping their legs.   
  
Some though sat alone, their concerns left at the door replaced with cheap ecstasy. The prey lay among that row of men. Thoughtless and ignorant to the world around him. While he had money to buy that nice convertible sitting out back, he was so pompous and brash no one ever wanted to even talk to him for a second. This unintentional self induced loneliness led him to fill the infinite hole with booze.  
  
Every night around 9:30 pm, the prey drove his stumpy figure over to any bar that let him. He ordered a bourbon on the rocks then flirted with anything that had a nice pair of legs. He would do this until he was kicked out of the bar, all to repeat it again the next night. Sometimes a bar would let this go on for a while, but nowhere was permanent.  Our hunter was also wary of this information after spotting the ogre like oaf on another one of their outings. Their loud mouth and unfavorable attitude made them a blip on their radar. Causing their every movement to be watched, given the spare time, for 2 weeks. Their patterns became the hunter's,and slowly they encroached onto their own grave.   
  
The hunter grew ever more concerned with this one. Every movement or touch could set him off or cause a scene. If too many eyes latch on they become anomalies, making the risk ever higher. This though, didn’t upset or deter the hunter from their prey. No, their own selfish desire, one similar to their prey’s, only grew with the ever prevalent risk. It made them crave him harder. Dream of his life squeezing out his eyes. Their desire to murder him grew so great that violent dreams would pop up at work.  
  
Now though their ugly present sat slobbishly on a stool, only a few feet in front of them. They grew closer, keeping their growing excitement invisible on their emotionless face. No one paid much attention to the hunter either, as according to the plan. Their red clothes blending into the background, a blur to the breathing crowd. Finally though after chasing their prize, dreaming of it, and craving it, it sat right in front of them. Rolls of fat piled onto each other like a human slug.  
  
His bald spot gleamed in the bar's dim overhead lighting. His skin was a consistent pinkish red, as if his body was working double time.A gold watch clung to his wrist, paired with two gold chains on his melting neck.  As the cherry on top he wore a black track suit, looking like a forgotten member of the Italian mafia.

“Is this seat taken?” the hunter said seductively. The prey moved their large orbs staring at her breasts immediately. “All yours honey.” The hunter smiled delightfully back, holding vomit in the pit of her throat. 

“What’s your name sweetheart?” The hunter gave a stand-in name for the night. “Bianca.”   
  
“Ain’t you just beautiful Bianca.” she giggled with a forced laugh. Anyone could smell out the insincerity in her laugh, but this drunken idiot couldn’t decipher it. “Aren’t you just the sweetest, what’s your name baby?” By the time the hunter sat in her seat she already had the prey in her pretty little hooks. 

“The names Tony, hon,” He picked her hand up and kissed her pale skin,” anyone get you a drink yet?” 

“No not yet, but a cosmopolitan would be nice.” 

“Then a cosmopolitan you shall get,” the prey lifted their hand sloppily in the air trying to get the attention of the bartender. Flags flew up in the predator’s head, she wanted to keep this unsavory interaction on the down low. Even an underpaid bartender may be the determinant of her night out. 

Quickly she thought of an excuse before the tired worker came over,”I need to use the ladies room real quick.” The heaving hog stared at her irritation twitching in his eyes, in a slurry of drawn out words he replied,”alright, just be quick, I did buy you a damn drink.”  
  
“Oh don’t worry baby, I’ll be right back,” her pouty voice calmed the situation down, like a mother taking care of a tubby toddler.  
  
Like that, before the bartender came to take their order, she disappeared. Sliding into the bathroom without making a sound. She stood in front of the mirror standing in between a woman doing lines and one doing their make up. She fixed her hair and reapplied parts of her makeup that started to wear away. Sneakily she slid a hand into her coat pocket grabbing a clear bottle. This little vial of liquid with a convenient dropper on top contained a serum, a serum powerful enough to knock out any large land mammal. 

All she needed was a single drop, enough to slowly activate later when no one was near. When she had him at his most vulnerable.

“OOO Goddamn!”, the woman to her left raised her head, rubbing her nose. In the background you could hear Nancy Reagan on the news, spewing about her war on drugs. The woman continued,”stupid bitch, can't stop me from powdering my nose.” This was met with silence, with the hunter and the other woman just glancing at the poor addict.

“Well I better get out there,” she grabbed her purse and still sniffed obnoxiously,""wouldn't want to keep them waiting, you girls have a fun night.” As she walked out, each step almost seemed to scream confidence, she walked as if she ruled the world. The hunter looked at her with pitiful disgust, to her this woman was only a pawn to the pig headed men that waited outside. Waiting to get home to drunkenly ravage her body for their own fulfillment, not caring for her own pleasure. Instead of taking power for herself, the woman drowned in substances that clouded her true thoughts. The narcotics numbed her into an obedient servant.

After the hunter did her makeup though she sat in the stall and lit up. She enjoyed her cigarette, finding it as a good motivator to finish her duty. She smoked half and flushed the rest down the toilet. 

She walked out the bathroom as more women  flooded to use their sinks as powder stations, finding herself back in the main room of the bar. She headed back to her ruse of a date. Walking up she saw the coked up broad from the bathroom, being fondled from some random man. His hands violated every inch of her body, snakes creeping lower and lower.

“Glad to see you didn’t get stuck in the toilet,” Tony let out a haughty chuckle,” was about to go check on you.” The hunter giggled feeding into the prey’s desires. “Well sometimes a lady needs to re-adjust herself, men just don’t understand.” He pointed his sausage-like appendage at her,”that’s cause men don’t concern themselves with needless things.” She held a reaction of disgust, wanting to yell that an oaf like him should concern himself with his appearance more.

They sat for what was like hours, in reality it had been 10-20 minutes. The hunter continued the facade, giggling at every remark and just nodding her head. Tony kept babbling on, taking the opportunity to even talk to a beautiful woman. He rambled on and on about his political beliefs, commented on her body, and his children’s accomplishments. Most of these children hadn’t conversed with their father in many years, making him only bitter with time.

In the midst of this great trauma dump, not once did he ever ask a question about the lady herself. The hunter noticed this as well, only making her craving ever more dire.  She sat unstable, like a kettle blowing steam. 

She thought her temper couldn’t be handled, it felt as though doing this over and over only led her to become more malice. That she was only filling herself with more pointless hate. Each one and every one of her prey seemed to be getting worse as she moved along. Each one being more vile, more grimy and sweaty. It felt like the men she hunted grew farther from the idiotic bear. The men she hunted seemed to grow more fat and slimy, like an overgrown slug.

Right as the top of her head was about to blow  off, Tony stopped himself. “ I need to fucking piss.” The hunter just nodded her head and smiled as she had before. Tony almost fell off the stool trying to move his disproportionate body. He drunkenly stepped, grabbing the hunter by her shoulder.

“Don’t you go anywhere b..aby,” his tongue tripped on each syllable slurring every consonance that came out.”

“With pleasure honey,” she smiled with the most genuine toothy grin in her entire life. He patted her dainty shoulder,”Good girl.”

She watched as the slimy man slithered away. Slowly approaching the men’s latrine. He stumbled about like a newborn, grabbing random civilian’s chairs to stabilize himself. Glares from bar goers glued onto Tony, but of course he was too intoxicated to notice anything. 

As soon as that door closed, the hunter got straight to preparing her trap. Slyly she reached into her red coat, pulling out her special serum. A slow acting drug that will put her prey under while she transported his gargantuan body. She uncapped the top, only putting a single drop in his glass of bourbon.

The hunter looked around, looking for any witnesses to her empowering action. To her relief all of those around were focused either on their drink or date. Even if anyone saw her movement, no one would think much of it. Her small stature and the organ that sits between her legs makes it easy to catch her prey. They underestimate the hunter, believing she is weak. There is nothing weak though with the hunter, weakness is only a perception. With that false representation, lies a deadly consequence.

Suddenly she was reminded of her goal as  a belch broke her thoughts. The slob moved back over to his stool. The hunter put back on her fleshy mask. She told herself that this will soon be in her control, trying to keep her attitude positive.

“I never should’ve broken the damn seal,” each word combined with a grunt as he sat down. His hand reached for the glass. The hunter’s eyes widened as the prey’s meaty paw grasped the cool cup. 

Time seemed to grow slower and slower, becoming more viscous as it went along. The brown glossy liquid trickled down, entering his thick bull neck. The hunter held back a gasp of excitement. For the first time, Tony was found attractive in the eyes of the predator. As he drank the spiked drink, his features decayed before the hunter. His eyes fell out and skin began to peel. Flies stuck to his ajar mouth. Excitement blossomed, Tony was growing closer and closer to her image. Beauty born out of rot.

His drink was dry, and his stupor enhanced. The hunter took advantage of this as soon as she could.

“Why not leave this place and go somewhere, say, more personal?” She fluttered her eyes trying to seduce the prey out of safety. Tony grabbed her ass and burrowed his brown eyes into her’s,”Mmm, nothing I would like more.” She forced the instinctual bile back down, continuing on her performance. “Why not my place,” she held back laughter as the irony hit,”let me treat you baby.” Tony chuckled,”Shit sounds good with me, as long as you drive.”

“Planned on it,” the hunter muttered to herself.”Huh?” her eyes met his,”Oh nothing, just head to my car, it's the red convertible.” The prey slapped a couple dollar bills on the bar and nodded agreeingly,""With pleasure!”

As Tony stumbled out, the red lady watched. Now the excitement dug under her skin, he had so perfectly fell into her trap. This transition of power that she so ever craved had been fulfilled again. 

Quickly she shifted out of the Siren’s Song, heading to her makeshift hearse. The blood red car sat there in the asphalt bed. Its headlights staring at their master, waiting to transport the live corpse.This car was a part of the hunter. Ever since her first victim in the mid 70’s, the car was there. It transported the butchered to their end, acting like Chiron , transporting the dead across the Styx.

She opened the door where Tony sat. He was half asleep and grumbled inconsistent vowels and random sounds. He beckoned to the hunter and asked her, “Give me a kiss baby.” She bent over, starting to kiss the prey keeping him calm as she waited for the serum to set in. He sloppily smacked his lips upon hers, acting like he was trying to eat her face off. She kissed back unwillingly, vomit waiting for the go ahead to be released. Tingles ran through her, as if her body rejected his very presence.

Luckily though his mouth started to move slower and slower. His tongue stopped trying to barge its way down the hunter’s throat. His lips kissed ever so slowly, as if the batteries in his body had been dying. Finally Tony sat there, motionless and frozen in a pathetic fetal position.

The hunter spat on the sad excuse for a man and started her car. With blissful silence, it pulled out the bar’s parking lot and headed down the street. The hunter sat in darkness as she carried the ignorant pig. The occasional street light shined on her pale skin, her dark eyes scanning the vacant streets. 

Her body eased up and her muscles relaxed, she sat back and enjoyed the quiet ride. The shameless hooker or the weary drugged out homeless man suspected nothing. The car just strolled right along. Even if the straggling lonesome cop pulled her over, the charisma of the hunter could pull them out of most situations. 

The car turned onto the hunter’s street, pulling into the empty driveway. She got out and opened her garage door,  driving the car inside. The house was a large one, a dark purple hue covered the wooden walls. It bore two great spires of that of the Victorian age. A great porch spun around the front end of the house, with a long staircase spilling into the yard. The roof was tiled black, adding a final cherry on top to the house's atmosphere. Dogs whimpered as they walked past and children didn't even dare to walk onto its lawn. 

The house was a gift the hunter gave to herself. She was the sole inheritor being an only child making competition low. After her mother had died her father only became more abusive, drinking more and becoming a larger nuisance. Her father only grew on her nerves more and more, she wished to be alone more and more. So one day as her father sat down to drink his morning coffee, unknowingly the hunter laid the trap. After one sip, his heart swelled up, constricting the arteries. As his body squeezed the life from his soul the hunter laughed. The last image he would see was his daughter laughing at his twitching corpse. After the coroner's office declared it a heart attack and the property was hers. The house became her butcher shop ever since that day, and Tony was the next hog lined up for slaughter.

The door flung open to her car, the hunter dragged over the metal cart placing Tony on it. His flabby figure melted on the tray of the trolley. The hunter carted the meat wrapped in a track suit out of the garage. The door to the basement flung open, and carefully, step by step, she hauled the piggy down. She dodged all the objects and got to the Butcher’s room.

In the middle, like an altar at a temple, stood a large metal pole. Adorned on the top of was a cage to hold their large bulbous heads. A lock was attached to the bottom, used to keep their wriggling necks still. Blood covered the pillar like a crimson Dalmatian. The floor below held a splotchy brown pattern, a product of them ever so rudely spilling their bile and blood.

The Hunter prepared her meat for slaughter, stripping the hideous hog. Its pale belly stood out like a white hot cauldron. Bad tan lines, like a tattoo, branded his skin. The hunter gagged the piggy’s mouth,she didn't care too much for their squealing. Finally, whether it be adrenaline or luck, the hunter heaved Tony's body into the pole. She stood him up tall, locking his head in the cage. Chains, as strong as metal pythons, wrapped his wrist binding them together with a metal loop holding it down. The pig had no chance of escape.

The hunter walked to her table, looking over the tools, deciding which was best for tonight. A sewing needle? Perhaps the bowie knife, good for a little carving. Maybe the brutish yet clean meat cleaver? The hunter thought why not all? Hell, after all this stalking and god awful kissing, she thought deserved to have a little fun.

She skipped over, giggling with the smelling salts in her hand. She held them up to the pig’s cage, snapping them in front of their snout. Suddenly eyes burst awake, a groggy demeanor slowly grew into realization and panic.

Grunts tried to run through the cloth but were stopped, only being heard as muffles. The hunter giggled, ”Glad to see you’re awake, I was worried you were going to miss the show.” Her knife gilded across his stretched out skin, cries whimpered pleadingly. 

 ”Not like I was going to let you miss it,” she sighed taking in the horrifically beautiful sight, “it feels so good not hearing you fucking snort in my ear.” Her laughter kept spilling into her words, “I can actually fucking talk!” 

Tony fought his bondage, attempting to curse at the hunter all that he could. Quickly the hunter’s blade made a shallow incision down his stomach. Tony cried louder and louder his gag only doing so much. Spit and tears streamed from orifices in his face. The knife continued, the hunter used the prey as a canvas, her blade as the brush. 

“You all act so tough” The hunted said with revulsion,”until you meet the Butcher.” The hunter backed away, Tony cried as he pulled at the ground in vain. “You aren’t the first little piggy,” the hunter remarked,” and you won’t be the last.” She flipped the light switch, showing a countless amount dolllike corpses. Their eyes gleamed a petrified look of fear. Across their bodies words like whore, slut, and cunt were carved in. Various appendages were replaced with that of a pig, with some having snouts to little curly tails. Their skins sewn tight, like a botched plastic surgery. Some  were even missing arms, legs, feet, and hands.

‘All of them were too ignorant,” the hunter said reminiscently,” it led them right to me, like you little piggy!” She walked back towards the man, standing like a witch in Salem. He closed his eyes and waited for the end.

His screams danced in the vacuum of the concrete. Slow strokes of her steel brush tore through his skin. Satisfaction filling the hunter’s hole. The prey wriggled all that he could in his position, all of it no use. As the torture went on, the seed of hope died in the prey’s heart. He knew his fate. Rather than fight the metal ropes, or try to scream, he reflected. 

In this the prey could only cry, for it was his own actions that ended his life. It was too late though, as the tears of regret wasn’t what the hunter wanted, only his life would satisfy. The hunter continued to pull and chop at her fleshy mannequin, molding it to her desire. She lopped off globs of flesh and sewed pieces of skin tighter in different places. This was all after she skinned it off her mannequin of course. 

By half way through it the prey died, his name destined to be forgotten in the sea of missing people. The hunter was sad when he died remarking,” Gone so soon little pig?”. She continued to work though, turning him into one of her finest dolls. She gleamed over his corpse, basking in the result of her mundane stalking.

She would play with this doll for a long time, longer than any before it. Just like all the others before, he eventually got thrown into the ground as space became tight. His body decomposed into the earth, only becoming a pile of rotting bones. 

The hunter though would continue her endless cycle of violent gratification, the neon sign leading more pigs into the Butcher’s room. Time though would creep unknowingly, aging the hunter until she could no longer stalk her prey efficiently. She would live her last days among her work. This didn’t help the hunter, only making her more bitter. She’d lock herself up in her house, sealing her in the wooden tomb. She would die from the lack of purpose she found in her age. Lying lonely with her dolls, a furrowed look of anger carved into her face.

In the following years, her crimes would be found. New articles blasted the hunter’s name to the whole world. Her work was viewed all over the globe, enduring many to watch. The true number of victims was never found and her name would become that of a folktale. The effects though would fail to teach the oblivious crowds, and the neon sign would continue to glow.",1,1762137395.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

I'm from an orthodox family back in India. My parents had already advised me to not to get into any relationships/flings during my stay in USA. I never had any relationships in India also.

But as a guy, I do feel attracted to white girls here. I don't dislike or hate my own race or anything, but maybe due to watching a lot of Hollywood movies and being exposed to white women here, I kind of like them and find them sexually attractive. So, I asked out a few white girls who I liked, but got rejected. I felt very bad and depressed. It even affected my studies.

God seemed to have other plans. A black girl from my university approached me for a date. Not out of the random, as we had some classes together. So we went for a coffee date. She's from Illinois. I learnt a lot of things about her place and stuff to impress her, and she too was impressed.

She's cute, intelligent, and all. But in my mind a black girl felt like a downgrade. I'm sorry this sounds racist and harsh, but I am just being honest. I wanted a white girlfriend. So, I've been telling myself that I'm being a prick. Why can't I just be happy with what God gave me?

Honestly, she's a nice girl. Very well educated. She's funny and witty. But it's just that in my mind, it feels like a downgrade when I wanted a white girlfriend in the first place.

I know I'm being racist. I don't want to be like this. I need advice on how to overcome these racist thoughts, and accept this woman for what she is and not judge her based on her skin colour.",0,1762137275.0,dating_advice,6,0.5,False

We love:
☕️ Coffee farm experiences
🌋 Scenic nature + light/medium hiking
🧘🏻‍♀️ Yoga / wellness
✨ Romantic / honeymoon vibes
🐒 Wildlife
🛁 Chill luxury time (spa, hot springs, private dinners, etc.)

Here’s our itinerary:
	•	Papagayo (Waldorf Astoria) – 5 nights
	•	La Fortuna (Nayara Tented Camp) – 5 nights
	•	Perez Zeledón / Hacienda AltaGracia – 4 nights

We definitely want at least one coffee experience + some light hiking in each region, but also don’t want to over-schedule — we want time to just enjoy the resorts and each other 💕

What’s one standout, must-do activity in each area?
Could be adventure, spa, nature, romantic dinner, wildlife tours — whatever feels iconic to you for that part of Costa Rica.

Also open to any local experiences or smaller boutique coffee farms vs big tours!

I am posting many times because I really am very serious about finding someone! I have been on my own way too long now I do not mind where you are located

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone please be aged between 25 and 35 hanks and please don't be shy to send me a message

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I’m now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps.

I just haven't found a woman that is suitable enough for me yet to want to be in a relationship with

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine.

You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. And please have maturity and decency.

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy.

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class. 

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one.

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life.

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy.

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do.

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. I could never cheat on someone I loved and cared about

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling.

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful.

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that.

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible.

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way. 

It’s very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after.

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test having a car is way too expensive and i have never been that interested in driving.

I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive.

I will also tell you that I am taking a break from work I am in a new country learning the language is my focus at the moment. I’m not lazy or anything like that and I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work which was hard In England

1on075b,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1on075b/neon_seduction/,Neon Seduction,"The night was a drab one. The rain pitter-pattered on the asphalt, greasing the ground. Its smooth surface reflected the luminescent lights of the street. Cars flew past, the water parting on the street.The streets were sparsely populated, drifters and drunks stumbled about. Periodically a woman of the night would stroll down. Each straggler sat or walked under the great neon sign. The red saturated light glowed on the skin of all. Its round elaborate patterns seducing bystanders, a lotus flower luring in the innocent. Vagrants and degenerates alike gathered here. Whether to drown the sorrows of the world out or to explore their primal desires. All needs were exploited by the neon sign.

Off to the side of the local watering hole, in the parking lot, sat the hunter and its prey. Eyes followed every movement of the target, examining each step from the brushing of their hair to stepping out of their orange convertible. Silently the stalker sat, waiting until the black industrial door shut behind them, sealing their prey’s fate.  
  
In the blood red convertible across the lot sat the stalker, their mind ran over the steps they so carefully thought of. The poison, the interaction, the witnesses, every piece had to be in their place at the right time. This was of no concern to the chasseur, maybe if this was their first time the mind would race and beads of sweat would appear on the palms. This, however, was far from their first time, many before had fallen into their web. Their soul lifted from this earth, their body given a new purpose.  
  
After a long and well deserved cigarette, the hunter decided to move into the bar. Walking up the red neon sign glowed, staring at the heedless killer. The glass tube working outlined the shape of a beautiful showgirl, her breasts round and perky like a mountain. Beside it the glass calligraphy spelt out the name of the establishment, “The Siren’s Song”.  
  
The metal creaked open but no one heard or saw the predator enter, their ears could hear but their eyes chose not to look. Couples surrounded the bar kissing sloppily, saliva dripping off the corners of their mouth. Men gathered near their short term lovers, awkwardly grinding and dry humping their legs.   
  
Some though sat alone, their concerns left at the door replaced with cheap ecstasy. The prey lay among that row of men. Thoughtless and ignorant to the world around him. While he had money to buy that nice convertible sitting out back, he was so pompous and brash no one ever wanted to even talk to him for a second. This unintentional self induced loneliness led him to fill the infinite hole with booze.  
  
Every night around 9:30 pm, the prey drove his stumpy figure over to any bar that let him. He ordered a bourbon on the rocks then flirted with anything that had a nice pair of legs. He would do this until he was kicked out of the bar, all to repeat it again the next night. Sometimes a bar would let this go on for a while, but nowhere was permanent.  Our hunter was also wary of this information after spotting the ogre like oaf on another one of their outings. Their loud mouth and unfavorable attitude made them a blip on their radar. Causing their every movement to be watched, given the spare time, for 2 weeks. Their patterns became the hunter's,and slowly they encroached onto their own grave.   
  
The hunter grew ever more concerned with this one. Every movement or touch could set him off or cause a scene. If too many eyes latch on they become anomalies, making the risk ever higher. This though, didn’t upset or deter the hunter from their prey. No, their own selfish desire, one similar to their prey’s, only grew with the ever prevalent risk. It made them crave him harder. Dream of his life squeezing out his eyes. Their desire to murder him grew so great that violent dreams would pop up at work.  
  
Now though their ugly present sat slobbishly on a stool, only a few feet in front of them. They grew closer, keeping their growing excitement invisible on their emotionless face. No one paid much attention to the hunter either, as according to the plan. Their red clothes blending into the background, a blur to the breathing crowd. Finally though after chasing their prize, dreaming of it, and craving it, it sat right in front of them. Rolls of fat piled onto each other like a human slug.  
  
His bald spot gleamed in the bar's dim overhead lighting. His skin was a consistent pinkish red, as if his body was working double time.A gold watch clung to his wrist, paired with two gold chains on his melting neck.  As the cherry on top he wore a black track suit, looking like a forgotten member of the Italian mafia.

“Is this seat taken?” the hunter said seductively. The prey moved their large orbs staring at her breasts immediately. “All yours honey.” The hunter smiled delightfully back, holding vomit in the pit of her throat. 

“What’s your name sweetheart?” The hunter gave a stand-in name for the night. “Bianca.”   
  
“Ain’t you just beautiful Bianca.” she giggled with a forced laugh. Anyone could smell out the insincerity in her laugh, but this drunken idiot couldn’t decipher it. “Aren’t you just the sweetest, what’s your name baby?” By the time the hunter sat in her seat she already had the prey in her pretty little hooks. 

“The names Tony, hon,” He picked her hand up and kissed her pale skin,” anyone get you a drink yet?” 

“No not yet, but a cosmopolitan would be nice.” 

“Then a cosmopolitan you shall get,” the prey lifted their hand sloppily in the air trying to get the attention of the bartender. Flags flew up in the predator’s head, she wanted to keep this unsavory interaction on the down low. Even an underpaid bartender may be the determinant of her night out. 

Quickly she thought of an excuse before the tired worker came over,”I need to use the ladies room real quick.” The heaving hog stared at her irritation twitching in his eyes, in a slurry of drawn out words he replied,”alright, just be quick, I did buy you a damn drink.”  
  
“Oh don’t worry baby, I’ll be right back,” her pouty voice calmed the situation down, like a mother taking care of a tubby toddler.  
  
Like that, before the bartender came to take their order, she disappeared. Sliding into the bathroom without making a sound. She stood in front of the mirror standing in between a woman doing lines and one doing their make up. She fixed her hair and reapplied parts of her makeup that started to wear away. Sneakily she slid a hand into her coat pocket grabbing a clear bottle. This little vial of liquid with a convenient dropper on top contained a serum, a serum powerful enough to knock out any large land mammal. 

All she needed was a single drop, enough to slowly activate later when no one was near. When she had him at his most vulnerable.

“OOO Goddamn!”, the woman to her left raised her head, rubbing her nose. In the background you could hear Nancy Reagan on the news, spewing about her war on drugs. The woman continued,”stupid bitch, can't stop me from powdering my nose.” This was met with silence, with the hunter and the other woman just glancing at the poor addict.

“Well I better get out there,” she grabbed her purse and still sniffed obnoxiously,""wouldn't want to keep them waiting, you girls have a fun night.” As she walked out, each step almost seemed to scream confidence, she walked as if she ruled the world. The hunter looked at her with pitiful disgust, to her this woman was only a pawn to the pig headed men that waited outside. Waiting to get home to drunkenly ravage her body for their own fulfillment, not caring for her own pleasure. Instead of taking power for herself, the woman drowned in substances that clouded her true thoughts. The narcotics numbed her into an obedient servant.

After the hunter did her makeup though she sat in the stall and lit up. She enjoyed her cigarette, finding it as a good motivator to finish her duty. She smoked half and flushed the rest down the toilet. 

She walked out the bathroom as more women  flooded to use their sinks as powder stations, finding herself back in the main room of the bar. She headed back to her ruse of a date. Walking up she saw the coked up broad from the bathroom, being fondled from some random man. His hands violated every inch of her body, snakes creeping lower and lower.

“Glad to see you didn’t get stuck in the toilet,” Tony let out a haughty chuckle,” was about to go check on you.” The hunter giggled feeding into the prey’s desires. “Well sometimes a lady needs to re-adjust herself, men just don’t understand.” He pointed his sausage-like appendage at her,”that’s cause men don’t concern themselves with needless things.” She held a reaction of disgust, wanting to yell that an oaf like him should concern himself with his appearance more.

They sat for what was like hours, in reality it had been 10-20 minutes. The hunter continued the facade, giggling at every remark and just nodding her head. Tony kept babbling on, taking the opportunity to even talk to a beautiful woman. He rambled on and on about his political beliefs, commented on her body, and his children’s accomplishments. Most of these children hadn’t conversed with their father in many years, making him only bitter with time.

In the midst of this great trauma dump, not once did he ever ask a question about the lady herself. The hunter noticed this as well, only making her craving ever more dire.  She sat unstable, like a kettle blowing steam. 

She thought her temper couldn’t be handled, it felt as though doing this over and over only led her to become more malice. That she was only filling herself with more pointless hate. Each one and every one of her prey seemed to be getting worse as she moved along. Each one being more vile, more grimy and sweaty. It felt like the men she hunted grew farther from the idiotic bear. The men she hunted seemed to grow more fat and slimy, like an overgrown slug.

Right as the top of her head was about to blow  off, Tony stopped himself. “ I need to fucking piss.” The hunter just nodded her head and smiled as she had before. Tony almost fell off the stool trying to move his disproportionate body. He drunkenly stepped, grabbing the hunter by her shoulder.

“Don’t you go anywhere b..aby,” his tongue tripped on each syllable slurring every consonance that came out.”

“With pleasure honey,” she smiled with the most genuine toothy grin in her entire life. He patted her dainty shoulder,”Good girl.”

She watched as the slimy man slithered away. Slowly approaching the men’s latrine. He stumbled about like a newborn, grabbing random civilian’s chairs to stabilize himself. Glares from bar goers glued onto Tony, but of course he was too intoxicated to notice anything. 

As soon as that door closed, the hunter got straight to preparing her trap. Slyly she reached into her red coat, pulling out her special serum. A slow acting drug that will put her prey under while she transported his gargantuan body. She uncapped the top, only putting a single drop in his glass of bourbon.

The hunter looked around, looking for any witnesses to her empowering action. To her relief all of those around were focused either on their drink or date. Even if anyone saw her movement, no one would think much of it. Her small stature and the organ that sits between her legs makes it easy to catch her prey. They underestimate the hunter, believing she is weak. There is nothing weak though with the hunter, weakness is only a perception. With that false representation, lies a deadly consequence.

Suddenly she was reminded of her goal as  a belch broke her thoughts. The slob moved back over to his stool. The hunter put back on her fleshy mask. She told herself that this will soon be in her control, trying to keep her attitude positive.

“I never should’ve broken the damn seal,” each word combined with a grunt as he sat down. His hand reached for the glass. The hunter’s eyes widened as the prey’s meaty paw grasped the cool cup. 

Time seemed to grow slower and slower, becoming more viscous as it went along. The brown glossy liquid trickled down, entering his thick bull neck. The hunter held back a gasp of excitement. For the first time, Tony was found attractive in the eyes of the predator. As he drank the spiked drink, his features decayed before the hunter. His eyes fell out and skin began to peel. Flies stuck to his ajar mouth. Excitement blossomed, Tony was growing closer and closer to her image. Beauty born out of rot.

His drink was dry, and his stupor enhanced. The hunter took advantage of this as soon as she could.

“Why not leave this place and go somewhere, say, more personal?” She fluttered her eyes trying to seduce the prey out of safety. Tony grabbed her ass and burrowed his brown eyes into her’s,”Mmm, nothing I would like more.” She forced the instinctual bile back down, continuing on her performance. “Why not my place,” she held back laughter as the irony hit,”let me treat you baby.” Tony chuckled,”Shit sounds good with me, as long as you drive.”

“Planned on it,” the hunter muttered to herself.”Huh?” her eyes met his,”Oh nothing, just head to my car, it's the red convertible.” The prey slapped a couple dollar bills on the bar and nodded agreeingly,""With pleasure!”

As Tony stumbled out, the red lady watched. Now the excitement dug under her skin, he had so perfectly fell into her trap. This transition of power that she so ever craved had been fulfilled again. 

Quickly she shifted out of the Siren’s Song, heading to her makeshift hearse. The blood red car sat there in the asphalt bed. Its headlights staring at their master, waiting to transport the live corpse.This car was a part of the hunter. Ever since her first victim in the mid 70’s, the car was there. It transported the butchered to their end, acting like Chiron , transporting the dead across the Styx.

She opened the door where Tony sat. He was half asleep and grumbled inconsistent vowels and random sounds. He beckoned to the hunter and asked her, “Give me a kiss baby.” She bent over, starting to kiss the prey keeping him calm as she waited for the serum to set in. He sloppily smacked his lips upon hers, acting like he was trying to eat her face off. She kissed back unwillingly, vomit waiting for the go ahead to be released. Tingles ran through her, as if her body rejected his very presence.

Luckily though his mouth started to move slower and slower. His tongue stopped trying to barge its way down the hunter’s throat. His lips kissed ever so slowly, as if the batteries in his body had been dying. Finally Tony sat there, motionless and frozen in a pathetic fetal position.

The hunter spat on the sad excuse for a man and started her car. With blissful silence, it pulled out the bar’s parking lot and headed down the street. The hunter sat in darkness as she carried the ignorant pig. The occasional street light shined on her pale skin, her dark eyes scanning the vacant streets. 

Her body eased up and her muscles relaxed, she sat back and enjoyed the quiet ride. The shameless hooker or the weary drugged out homeless man suspected nothing. The car just strolled right along. Even if the straggling lonesome cop pulled her over, the charisma of the hunter could pull them out of most situations. 

The car turned onto the hunter’s street, pulling into the empty driveway. She got out and opened her garage door,  driving the car inside. The house was a large one, a dark purple hue covered the wooden walls. It bore two great spires of that of the Victorian age. A great porch spun around the front end of the house, with a long staircase spilling into the yard. The roof was tiled black, adding a final cherry on top to the house's atmosphere. Dogs whimpered as they walked past and children didn't even dare to walk onto its lawn. 

The house was a gift the hunter gave to herself. She was the sole inheritor being an only child making competition low. After her mother had died her father only became more abusive, drinking more and becoming a larger nuisance. Her father only grew on her nerves more and more, she wished to be alone more and more. So one day as her father sat down to drink his morning coffee, unknowingly the hunter laid the trap. After one sip, his heart swelled up, constricting the arteries. As his body squeezed the life from his soul the hunter laughed. The last image he would see was his daughter laughing at his twitching corpse. After the coroner's office declared it a heart attack and the property was hers. The house became her butcher shop ever since that day, and Tony was the next hog lined up for slaughter.

The door flung open to her car, the hunter dragged over the metal cart placing Tony on it. His flabby figure melted on the tray of the trolley. The hunter carted the meat wrapped in a track suit out of the garage. The door to the basement flung open, and carefully, step by step, she hauled the piggy down. She dodged all the objects and got to the Butcher’s room.

In the middle, like an altar at a temple, stood a large metal pole. Adorned on the top of was a cage to hold their large bulbous heads. A lock was attached to the bottom, used to keep their wriggling necks still. Blood covered the pillar like a crimson Dalmatian. The floor below held a splotchy brown pattern, a product of them ever so rudely spilling their bile and blood.

The Hunter prepared her meat for slaughter, stripping the hideous hog. Its pale belly stood out like a white hot cauldron. Bad tan lines, like a tattoo, branded his skin. The hunter gagged the piggy’s mouth,she didn't care too much for their squealing. Finally, whether it be adrenaline or luck, the hunter heaved Tony's body into the pole. She stood him up tall, locking his head in the cage. Chains, as strong as metal pythons, wrapped his wrist binding them together with a metal loop holding it down. The pig had no chance of escape.

The hunter walked to her table, looking over the tools, deciding which was best for tonight. A sewing needle? Perhaps the bowie knife, good for a little carving. Maybe the brutish yet clean meat cleaver? The hunter thought why not all? Hell, after all this stalking and god awful kissing, she thought deserved to have a little fun.

She skipped over, giggling with the smelling salts in her hand. She held them up to the pig’s cage, snapping them in front of their snout. Suddenly eyes burst awake, a groggy demeanor slowly grew into realization and panic.

Grunts tried to run through the cloth but were stopped, only being heard as muffles. The hunter giggled, ”Glad to see you’re awake, I was worried you were going to miss the show.” Her knife gilded across his stretched out skin, cries whimpered pleadingly. 

 ”Not like I was going to let you miss it,” she sighed taking in the horrifically beautiful sight, “it feels so good not hearing you fucking snort in my ear.” Her laughter kept spilling into her words, “I can actually fucking talk!” 

Tony fought his bondage, attempting to curse at the hunter all that he could. Quickly the hunter’s blade made a shallow incision down his stomach. Tony cried louder and louder his gag only doing so much. Spit and tears streamed from orifices in his face. The knife continued, the hunter used the prey as a canvas, her blade as the brush. 

“You all act so tough” The hunted said with revulsion,”until you meet the Butcher.” The hunter backed away, Tony cried as he pulled at the ground in vain. “You aren’t the first little piggy,” the hunter remarked,” and you won’t be the last.” She flipped the light switch, showing a countless amount dolllike corpses. Their eyes gleamed a petrified look of fear. Across their bodies words like whore, slut, and cunt were carved in. Various appendages were replaced with that of a pig, with some having snouts to little curly tails. Their skins sewn tight, like a botched plastic surgery. Some  were even missing arms, legs, feet, and hands.

‘All of them were too ignorant,” the hunter said reminiscently,” it led them right to me, like you little piggy!” She walked back towards the man, standing like a witch in Salem. He closed his eyes and waited for the end.

His screams danced in the vacuum of the concrete. Slow strokes of her steel brush tore through his skin. Satisfaction filling the hunter’s hole. The prey wriggled all that he could in his position, all of it no use. As the torture went on, the seed of hope died in the prey’s heart. He knew his fate. Rather than fight the metal ropes, or try to scream, he reflected. 

In this the prey could only cry, for it was his own actions that ended his life. It was too late though, as the tears of regret wasn’t what the hunter wanted, only his life would satisfy. The hunter continued to pull and chop at her fleshy mannequin, molding it to her desire. She lopped off globs of flesh and sewed pieces of skin tighter in different places. This was all after she skinned it off her mannequin of course. 

By half way through it the prey died, his name destined to be forgotten in the sea of missing people. The hunter was sad when he died remarking,” Gone so soon little pig?”. She continued to work though, turning him into one of her finest dolls. She gleamed over his corpse, basking in the result of her mundane stalking.

She would play with this doll for a long time, longer than any before it. Just like all the others before, he eventually got thrown into the ground as space became tight. His body decomposed into the earth, only becoming a pile of rotting bones. 

The hunter though would continue her endless cycle of violent gratification, the neon sign leading more pigs into the Butcher’s room. Time though would creep unknowingly, aging the hunter until she could no longer stalk her prey efficiently. She would live her last days among her work. This didn’t help the hunter, only making her more bitter. She’d lock herself up in her house, sealing her in the wooden tomb. She would die from the lack of purpose she found in her age. Lying lonely with her dolls, a furrowed look of anger carved into her face.

In the following years, her crimes would be found. New articles blasted the hunter’s name to the whole world. Her work was viewed all over the globe, enduring many to watch. The true number of victims was never found and her name would become that of a folktale.

It was around midnight a few years ago when I heard the sound of someone breaking into my house. I don’t think I had more than twenty minutes of sleep but as soon as I heard the window being broken I was wide awake and looking for my phone to call the police. 

My heart sank when I remembered that I left it downstairs, charging in the kitchen. The source of the break in. 

I live alone, had no one as backup and didn't have a gun, so I grabbed the only thing that could pass as a weapon: a baseball bat. Once I had that, I psyched myself up to go downstairs to face the intruder. 

Once I reached the bottom step I saw the silhouette of a man sitting at my kitchen table. It was dark so I could not see what he looked like but the stink coming off him was enough to curl my nose hairs. It was obvious even without the lights on that he was, at best, a drifter and at worst a vagrant. Either way, even a blind man could see that whoever broke into my house fell on hard times. Not that that was going to change my mind about kicking him out of my house. He did break in after all. 

When I turned on the lights I could see that his clothes were old, dirty and torn. It was as though he pulled them out of a dumpster. He was so skinny that I wouldn't be surprised if the man was sick on top of being malnourished. His hair was long and stringy and, just like his beard, it grew in patches. The way he sat there motionless with his thousand yard stare and tears forming in his eyes made me think that he had given up on life. 

I was about to tell him to get out but as soon as I opened my mouth I noticed that he had a shotgun on his lap. 

Upon seeing this I lowered the bat and nervously asked him what he wanted. However he didn’t answer me. Instead, he just sat still and stared straight ahead as if I wasn't even in the room with him. 

Scared, I asked him if he was hungry and that I could make him something. As a kid I was instructed to give the homeless food instead of money since they might buy booze or drugs with it, but the man didn't answer. So after a long awkward silence I took the initiative and went to heat up some leftovers in the microwave. As I was doing this I prodded the stranger with questions, what his name was, what he wanted and if he wanted me to call anyone. 

He did not answer for a long time and hardly noticed the food I placed in front of him once it was ready. However, once he started talking he told me a story that would change my life forever. 

He said his name was Cole Dyer and admitted to killing twenty people. 

I’m not at all embarrassed to say that I cried and begged for my life at this point. This only angered Cole.

“I have something I need to fucking get off my chest. So sit the fuck down and shut up.”

Doing what he said, I sat across from Cole who told me how he got started killing people. His first victim was a hooker who he choked to death when he thought she was stealing from him. With the shotgun in his lap I didn't want to anger him so I just sat there and didn't ask any questions. 

Cole would go on to explain that this victim wasn't killed like the others because, at that time he didn't know how he wanted to murder people, or for that matter, knew that he had a taste for it.

“I figured it would be just a matter of time before some cop showed up at my doorstep or came to my work to ask questions. But after a few weeks of no one coming around and not even a mention in the obituaries, I figured I was in the clear” Cole explained. “It shouldn't be surprising that no one gave a shit about her. If anyone cared for her she wouldnt have been a fucking hooker, you know?”

Finally having a way to vent his frustrations and no longer feeling like some cog in the machine, Cole’s murderous fantasies took on a life of their own. 

“When I tried going after the second person, I tried to strangle her with a piece of guitar string. That was messy and loud and I nearly got caught. Not long after that, maybe five or six people later I came up with my own preferred method of killing people” Cole explained. “I even gave myself a silly name: The ‘Pass It On Killer.’”

It was the first time I spoke in what seemed like an hour. A single word. 

“Why?”

“Why what? The name?” Cole asked but I was too afraid to answer. 

Annoyed with my silence, Cole went ahead and explained his reasoning by justifying his twisted sense of righteousness and questionable moral compass. The gist of it was that if he killed enough “pests” good things would come back to him. 

Symbolizing this he would replace the head of his previous victim with the most current.

“Cutting off a head is hard. Even if you have power tools it's messy shit. Took a while before I got the hang of it though” Cole confessed, oblivious to my disgust. “I rigged a bike pump to a catheter, snaked it through the axillary nerve until it reached the superior vana cava. It only took about two minutes before the blood stopped flowing and by then removing the head was pretty much blood free”.

Realizing killing people he knew was a sure way of getting caught Cole learned what questions to ask complete strangers to discover the “pests” in their lives. This was easier than Cole would have guessed because in the end who didn’t like talking about themselves?

“I was always good at talking to people, you know? I could talk the devil into lighting himself on fire. Because of that it was easy to learn where the pests lived, worked, drove and more.""

Since the murders were spread out nationwide and none of his victims had any connections to each other or Cole, the authorities were at a loss. When there was a news article talking about a murder no one ever mentioned that they were connected. 

“They didn't want to cause a panic, you know? It wasn't often, but when the newspapers said the head was removed, they would say it was removed with a sword or an ax or whatever. They did this so when someone tries to take credit, they say the wrong tool and the police know it's bullshit and a waste of time. Obviously I never called any of the hotlines or tried to taunt authorities. That would just give them more clues to work with.”

I felt sick. This man was crazy and dangerous. More than that, he had a gun and was sitting across the table from me. 

“At first hearing and reading about the police chasing down leads terrified me. However after so much bullshitting they did to the public, their claims that they were closing in on a suspect didn't bother me in the slightest” Cole said with a rotten tooth smile that quickly evaporated. 

A flood of tears started filling his eyes and he blinked them away before taking the first nibble of food.

Just when it seemed that he was calm, Cole shouted at me, demanding that I grab a pen and paper and jot down his tale. 

Who was I to say no? Even though he had his hands on the table there was still a shotgun in his lap. I didn’t want to bet that it wasn't loaded or that I was faster. The safe bet was just to write the story he was telling me and hope he would show me mercy.

“I was doing this for a long time. Nearly ten years at this point. And while scouting for the twenty-first victim I found myself behind a small series of apartment buildings” Cole said, shaking his head as if he was in disbelief of his own tale. “I heard a small group of people huddled around someone's basement apartment, whispering to whoever was inside. They were a ways away so I couldn't make out the details at the time but I could see that something wasn't right about them. They were dirty. Long greasy hair and beards. But there was something else about them. Something… something evil.”

“Why do you say that?” I asked without thinking. To this day I don't know if that outburst was because I was curious or tired.

“One by one they stopped their hushed whispering and turned their gazes towards me. It was creepy as fuck so I got the hell out of there” Cole responded as though he didnt hear my question. “When I took a peek over my shoulder they were following me but stayed just out of the cone of light the street lamps provided.”

I had to admit, that sounded pretty scary, but evil? I kept my thoughts to myself and kept writing.

“It creeped me out. I was already thinking of finding someone else to kill because I don’t like killing in apartment buildings. Too many neighbors to see you or hear you when you're using the saw, you know? When I saw them though, that sort of settled it. I wasn’t going to go back there. I kept looking back in the mirror on the way home to see if I was being followed but in the five hour drive I didn’t see a thing behind me. The next day, however, I noticed a car driving slowly though my parking lot every few hours. I was smoking lots of weed at the time and figured I was just being paranoid but the next night I woke up to tapping on the door”.

As Cole explained to me what happened next he started to rock back and forth the way I’ve seen children do in an effort to calm himself down before continuing his story. 

“Thought it was my imagination at first but then I started hearing my name being whispered from the hallway. When I realized I wasn't imagining the noises I looked out the peephole.”

Cole took a moment before continuing but before he spoke he swallowed and took a drink of water from the glass I gave him. 

“There were at least five of them that time. Dirty, long hair and dark sunken eyes that seemed to glow with the hatred of some sort of hellist pit. They spent the entire night begging me to come out.” 

With the exception of the eyes, it was as though Cole was describing himself. Again, this was a thought I kept to myself.

“In that building it wasn't uncommon to hear drunken exes pound on doors demanding to be let in so their begging went on for hours. Eventually a neighbor I never bothered to get to know decided to open the door to tell the strangers to keep it down. She stopped mid sentence the moment she saw them,” Cole explained. “They pushed her back into her apartment and all piled in. Through that thin wall I could hear them tearing through her place and when she cried or begged or groaned they just laughed. Eventually they made the woman beg me to come out from my apartment. Whenever she did they would laugh and instruct her to say it louder. She would comply with their demands and her reward would be getting hit more.”

“Jesus” I blurted out.

“When I refused to open the door or even respond they grew bored and started getting even more violent with the woman. First the sounds of punches and things getting broken, but then… Jesus. They were eating her. It was loud and wet and lasted until the sun came up”.

“How did you know they were eating her? They were in a different apartment.”

“They didnt close the fucking door,” Cole answered. “Saw it when I was leaving.” He was clearly annoyed with the interruption, reminding me that I didn’t want to interrupt someone who was obviously crazy. The best course of action for me to take was to remain silent and allow Cole to go on for as long as he wanted. 

Cole then quickly ate the rest of the meatloaf I heated up for him and asked for more. When I grabbed him another piece, he stopped me from heating it up so I set it in front of him instead. Considering how he looked I thought he was going to inhale it like the other piece, but it sat there for a long time before he touched it. 

“I didn't leave my room until I was confident they were gone and that it was safe to leave. There was no way I was going to stay there. No fucking way. I packed my car and took off. I didn't know what I would need at the time, so I took my camping gear, my tools, a few guns and of course, the head of the previous pest who I kept on ice. After that I went straight to some army surplus store to get the rest of what I needed.” 

At first I assumed he was going to go out in the woods, but it became obvious that what he really meant was staying at a seedy hotel that didn't take credit cards or require ID’s. 

“About a week later I was getting some grub at some grocery store, just walking in the parking lot and minding my own business, right? They drove up right behind me and laid on the horn. I didn’t even bother getting something to eat after that. I just wanted to get the hell out of there. By the time I remembered that I left the head back in the hotel's mini fridge I had already crossed two state lines.”

I could tell this bothered him greatly and I assumed it was because now the police would have a lead and find the identity of the Pass It On Killer. However, as if reading my mind, Cole let out a dry laugh and told me the reason he was sour about it, even years later, was because he has “completion anxiety.”

At this point of the story Cole had to take a moment, and knowing that he had a shotgun on his lap I gave it to him. Hoping that my kindness would be repaid and I could keep my head once he finished his tale I poured him some milk and offered him the rest of the baby carrots I had in the fridge.

Since I live alone, I don't have much food for unexpected guests. At the time I was sure the food I was offering him would be enough of an excuse for this psycho to kill me. When I set it down in front of him, my hands were trembling.

“They had to know what I was driving, so I traded my car for a van. At least I could sleep in the van, right? Saves money on hotels and shit” Cole explained. “About five weeks later I crossed their paths again. This time I was in a deep sleep when I heard them say my name. In my dream the name was like an echo and when I woke up my eyes were immediately locked on the dark eyes of a woman with the same sinister resemblance as the men I saw back at the apartment. Without a beard, however, this woman's disfiguration was more noticeable.”

“Disfiguration?” I asked.

Cole gave a grunt that might have meant nothing, something or everything. “I might as well tell you everything, right? You are writing down my tale after all” Cole said, clearly not excited to relive the experience. “At first I thought it was a cleft lip and chin but it wasn't. The few teeth that she had were small and brown and grew fucking everywhere” Cole explained as his dirty fingers were fidgeting with the gun in his lap. “Like the gums and the inside of the cheeks and shit. Even in the dark I could see their black eyes and when I jumped into the front seat and turned over the engine the headlights revealed dozens of her family. They were all standing ten or so feet apart from each other, scattered around. Some were naked but they were all standing still, smiling and just looking at me. Like they were giving me permission to leave.”

Gooseflesh covered my entire body and I was having trouble keeping up with Coles story because he was talking too fast. 

“I tried to swerve and hit a few with the front tire or to at least clip them with the van’s fat ass; however, they all stepped to the side, effortlessly avoiding getting run down.”

As Cole took a moment to catch his breath, I asked what he meant when he said “Her family.”

“Thats a recent term I gave them. At the time I thought they were demons or vampires but not any longer.”

I wanted to ask him why he no longer thought this was the case, but I kept this question to myself. I felt I pressed my luck enough at this point with all the questions I had been asking. After all this man was insane and armed.

“After that encounter I abandoned the van and stole a car. I would do this every so often, whenever I felt that they were closing in on me. A gut feeling. This was triggered by anything from something I imagined seeing in the corner of my eye to the cries coming from a murder of crows.”

Again, I had a bunch of questions but didn't dare ask them. What did crows have to do with these people after Cole?

“Zig zagging across the country I made every effort to forever rid myself of these people. I would stay inside at night and if I could I would sleep during the day. I would pass the time by reading and listening to music. You know, good music. Peter Warlock? Bach?”

I knew who Bach was, but never heard of the other name. 

“Classical?” I asked, surprised because of Cole's appearance.

“Vivaldi Concerto No. 5 is my favorite. Bet you wouldn't have guessed that I also play the cello.”

I had no idea if Cole was pulling my leg or not, but I didn't have time to react, Cole was back to telling his story.

“While on the run I would take odd jobs here and there to pay for what I needed to survive. A tractor assembly line in Michigan, a toll booth operator in Florida and a semi weight station in Nevada. Whatever job paid in cash and as long as I didn’t have to work at night. No matter where I found work I would not stay long before feeling that they were closing in on me. More often than not I would leave before getting a paycheck.”

Up to now he had been talking to me, a captive audience due to the shotgun on his lap for well over four hours. I was tired but Cole seemed to be wide awake. During a moment of silence I asked Cole if he wanted any coffee. He accepted so I made a pot for the two of us to share. 

I could feel Cole stare at me as I made the coffee and my heart was beating so loud I swore Cole was able to hear it. The silence went on for what felt like hours. Finally I couldn't take it anymore and had to break the silence. 

“How do you take your coffee?”

“Very strong. No cream. No sugar.”

As the coffee started brewing, the tension was so thick that it made the room feel as though I was breathing through a hot wet rag. This went on for some time and I think Cole was enjoying the sight of making me uncomfortable because he only continued his story when I started filling the cups.

“Before coming here I was staying at a place up in northern Canada for about three months. A loft above a bar. Figured that a bar full of people at night would keep me safe” Cole said, again fidgeting with the gun. “I had an arrangement with the owner. In exchange for the room, I would work as the janitor, unload trucks, do some deliveries, etcetera. I kept to myself and people left me alone, the only time I was ever bothered was when there was work to be done. It was nice while it lasted, however when they finally arrived they… they were under the window in the alley, softly calling out to me. With all the music being played downstairs I have no idea how long they were there, but the moment I knew it was them the giggling began.”

For some reason, giggling as soon as Cole noticed them creeped me out far more than anything he said so far. 

“They tried to flatter me by saying they were my biggest fans and tried to prove it by telling me details that only the Pass It On Killer would know” Cole said, his eyes looking into the darkened room behind me. 

“I told them off. Called them vampires because they couldn't come inside without permission. That was the first thing I ever said to them and as soon as I said that, everything went silent. I must have been used to the sounds they were making because I didn’t notice it until it stopped. That’s when someone with a strange accent told me that they were not vampires but in fact something else. Something that I---”. 

Cole never finished this thought. In the silence that followed I didn't know what he was going to do and this terrified me. 

It might have been lack of sleep on my part, possibly even momentary insanity but I had to know who, or what was chasing Cole. When I asked he didn't answer so I pressed my luck and asked him a second time 

“What else needs permission to enter a house other than vampires?”

Again he didn't answer and even though I knew it was a mistake to poke the bear I started to ask again. As soon as the words started to leave my mouth Cole reached into his inner breast pocket and pulled out what I thought at the time was paper napkins. After inspecting it for a moment with an expression I have never seen before, Cole slapped them down on the table between us. 

Written on them in everything from pen to marker to pencil were the messages “Let us in”, “Open the door” and more. It was hard to tell what else was said because the writing overlapped. However, it was clear to me that these messages were written by dozens of people.

As I picked one up to look at it closer and ascertain what else was written down on them, my finger rubbed the glossy underside. Turning it over I saw that it was a photograph showing Cole sleeping in what appeared to be a small apartment, the next appeared to be him in an abandoned bus, a dirty attic and so on. 

In some of the pictures Cole looked twenty years younger and it made me wonder just how long he was on the run for. I know that stress can prematurely age people but I had a hard time believing that the person in the picture and Cole were one and the same.

“They don't need permission to enter someone's house” he said as his gaze returned to the empty space behind me. 

I had to look back to see if anything was there and was more relieved than words could explain when I saw nothing behind me.

We sat there quietly for what seemed like an eternity before Cole said anything else. When he did it was as if he suddenly remembered that he was telling me a story and picked up where he left off. The part where they then cut the power to the apartment and the bar under him. 

“It didn’t take long before the woman tending bar that night was shouting at them not to come closer. They just laughed. They tore her apart and all I could do was listen and wait until morning to come” Cole confessed with a shake of his head as if to eject the thoughts from his mind. “Thing is, Canada has some long nights during the winter and I only had enough food for a few days”. 

Cole didn’t tell me how long he stayed in that room for and I didn’t want to ask. It was obvious from the thousand yard stare that these events were still fresh in his mind so I kept my mouth shut.

“When I finally left my room I saw gore sprinkled everywhere. Like a trail of breadcrumbs that started from behind the bar and led right to my apartment. I had seen blood before, but this was something else entirely. I was careful not to touch anything with my bare hands as I emptied the cash register and stole a toolbox from the back office so I could switch license plates to throw them off my scent.”

“Do you know how to kill them?” I asked.

Cole shook his head. “I don’t know how to stop them but I think I have a good idea how to slow them down,” but before he could elaborate he noticed that the sun was shining through my kitchen window. Grateful that he went another night without seeing them and having someone he could talk to, Cole thanked me for listening.

I didn’t know what to say to such a story. What could I say? In the pregnant silence that followed I filled the void by rambling about whatever came to mind. My job, the annoying coworkers and how my boss is always looking over my shoulder. 

As if this was at all similar to Cole's own story.

I didn’t think anything of Cole asking me if I liked my job or where I worked at the time and soon I was answering all of his questions. 

After a short while Cole thanked me again, then he stood up, took my car keys off the counter and left without another word.

It might have been ten minutes after Cole left before I called the police and all I said to them was that my house was broken into and that my car was stolen. After all, the truth was so unbelievable that if I said anything else it might make me look as crazy as Cole. 

Maybe I didn't say anything else because I was tired? I don't know for certain.

The more distance I put between myself and that night the less real it felt. But then reality set in once I learned that my boss was found dead a few days later.

According to the local newspaper, Whisper Alley Echos, pieces of my boss were found all over his bedroom. Most people in town considered this to be an exaggeration to stir up newspaper sales and I wanted to agree but it was hard to, considering Cole's tale. 

In the back of my head the idea of what Cole told me being true kept teasing me. It bothered me so much that I ended up hiring a private investigator, a decision I came to regret. I would rather be ignorant of what came next. A week after hiring the PI, I received a phone call informing me that my boss's head was found in the middle of another bloody mess all the way in Cleveland. 

Not only that, but the private investigator also informed me that the local newspaper apparently withheld the fact that a different person's head was discovered in my boss's freezer. I assume it was the head Cole left in the hotel fridge but kept this to myself.

Over the next few weeks I kept thinking of the story Cole told me. If those thoughts weren't front and center they were creeping in the back, ready to pounce on a happy moment to turn it sour. 

It didn’t take long before I started seeing dark patches dart from one shadow to the next, disappearing as soon as I turned to look at it. At first I chalked this up to being a mouse, the reflection off of my glasses or lack of sleep (After all it was much harder to sleep in a house that was broken into). Hoping it wasn't mice because of my hatred towards them I bought some medicine in town so I could get some rest at night. It worked wonders when it came to getting shuteye but did nothing to stop me from seeing these shadows.

With an embarrassing frequency I would imagine the reflecting eyes on the side of the road were Cole's night visitors or think of them whenever I heard the house settle. 

It was as though toying with the idea of them being real was enough to invite them into my life.

I don’t recall what came first, hearing my name being called out in public, a sound similar to a murder of crows cawing or the soft scraping at my screen windows at night. However once I realized that the noises and the visions were real there was no way to block them out.

At night the soft whispers were hard to make out and the more I tried to ignore them the more I thought about them.  

I could not tell you how many nights I stayed up just so I could put my ear up to the wall but I can tell you it was worth the effort, because unlike Cole, I know what they want. 

They whispered of a message that took months before I understood it fully, but in those words that only someone with a certain madness could grasp, I understood. You see, they aren’t a family like Cole said. They are more akin to nomads who will only accept members with certain propensities to join their roving community.

It wasn't as long as you might think before I did the one thing Cole was never brave enough to do and opened the door. 

The first night I opened the door for them was terrifying, like losing one's virginity. Even with Cole's descriptions there was no way I could have been prepared for their appearance because they resembled humans the way sharks look like dolphins.

During these conversations they instructed me to share Cole's story with the world so some of his madness could rub off on others and “season the meat.”

In this partnership of ours they gained a buffet of people, while I gained so much more. Not only would they tell me tales I would pass off as my own, but in time I could join their ranks. 

Heralding their coming will include everything from seeing shadows in the corner of your eyes, the sounds of whispering and something similar to the cawing of crows. 

Once these or any dozen of other signs occur, it's the beginning of the end. And when that happens you can thank me, a better and far more successful Pass It On Killer than Cole ever was.",1,1762136795.0,CreepCast_Submissions,1,1.0,False

I have avoided caffeine for the most part because it makes me feel yucky but thought since it was small I would be okay. 

I drank almost all of it and throughout the day i started to feel so bad. The eye floaters got worse, nausea, dizziness, indigestion, and just an overall yucky feeling. Like something bad was going to happen and I started shaking a bit in my hands. 

Now it’s a few hours later and I still feel bad and have no appetite. Is this normal and will it go away? Should i just avoid coffee/caffeine altogether at this point?",1,1762136674.0,prozac,2,1.0,False

Saturday felt slow in the best way—sunlight spilling through the blinds, the world outside unhurried.  
Oliver was still half-asleep beside her, one arm heavy across Idalia’s waist, his breath steady against the back of her neck. She could feel the warmth of him through the sheets, the soft rasp of his morning voice when he murmured, “Five more minutes.”  

She smiled into the pillow. “You said that forty minutes ago.”  
“Yeah, but now I mean it.”  

Weekends were the small kind of heaven they lived for. The weekday grind—her endless phone calls and spreadsheets, his long hours under Florida sun and engine noise—melted into these slow mornings. Here, time didn’t have edges. Just laughter and the smell of coffee drifting in from the kitchen.

He eventually rolled over, squinting at her. “You know I still can’t believe I married the bossiest woman alive.”  
“You love it,” she teased.  
“I do,” he said, grinning. “Don’t tell anyone, though. Gotta keep up appearances.”  

In public, he looked like the one in charge—broad shoulders, that easy confidence—but at home she was the quiet gravity everything orbited around. He liked it that way. She did too.

Sampson jumped onto the bed, tail wagging hard enough to shake the blankets.  
“Morning, buddy,” Idalia said, scratching behind his ears.  
Oliver groaned. “He’s jealous again.”  
“Then move over.”  
“Never. I’m the favorite.”  
Sampson barked, clearly disagreeing, and she laughed until her chest ached.  

By noon, the kitchen smelled faintly of toast and sugar. The house felt lived-in: socks on the floor, sunlight painting lazy stripes across the walls. Idalia leaned against the counter, scrolling through her phone, while Oliver measured out the shrooms on the scale. They’d read guides, compared notes, tried to be careful. Curiosity wasn’t recklessness; they just wanted to share something new together.  

“You ready?” he asked, crushing the pieces down with the back of a spoon.  
“As I’ll ever be,” she said.  
They took them at one o’clock, together—his fingers brushing hers as they swallowed.  

For the first hour, nothing but warmth. The world softened at the edges, colors blurring into a low hum. They stretched out on the couch, watching one of their comfort shows, something light and familiar.  
Oliver’s laugh filled the room; it was deep, easy, the kind that always made her feel safe.  

By two, the trip began to bloom. The air shimmered faintly. The sunlight looked thick, golden, almost syrupy. They snacked on chips, laughed until they cried at jokes that weren’t even funny, scrolled through videos and kept showing each other their favorites. Every touch felt electric but tender—his thumb tracing the edge of her hand, her head tucked under his chin.  

“See?” she said. “This is perfect.”  
“Told you,” he murmured, brushing her hair from her face. “You and me, always.”  

They talked about everything and nothing. The cats kept trying to wedge themselves between them, tails flicking across their laps, while Sampson sprawled at their feet, snoring gently. The house was peaceful, time liquid.  

Hours passed that way—smooth, seamless. At some point, Idalia realized how much she trusted him; how even in this strange, shifting state, his presence anchored her. She felt safe, completely.  

At 5:30, Cameron came home.  
“Hey, you two still alive?” he joked, dropping his keys by the door.  
“Barely,” Oliver called, grinning. “It’s been great, though.”  
Idalia laughed, “Everything’s just… warm. Like the world finally got the memo to chill out.”  

Cameron grabbed a drink, kicked off his shoes, and joined them in the living room. They talked for almost an hour—joking, sharing stories, telling him how gentle the trip had been. The house buzzed with laughter. Everything felt right.  

Then, at 6:30, the sound.  
A sudden, wet gag from the corner.  

Sampson.  

Oliver sat up immediately. “He’s choking—hey, hey, come here—”  
Cameron was already on his feet. The laughter vanished.  

Idalia turned her head. The room swayed slightly, but not in the dreamy way from earlier. Something in her chest shifted—an unfamiliar weight pressing inward. She stood to help, but the sound of Sampson retching hit her like a punch. Her stomach clenched. The air thickened.  

“Hey, it’s okay, we got it,” Oliver said, crouched beside the dog.  
But the sound wouldn’t stop.  
Her throat locked in sympathy. Heat rushed up her neck.  

“Babe?” Oliver’s voice blurred.  
She tried to answer, but nausea overtook her. She staggered toward the trash bag by the couch, barely made it before she threw up.  

And then everything began to slip.  

Her pulse swung wild—too fast, then too slow, her body caught in between. The air thickened. Her knees buckled.  
She tried to speak but the words dissolved, her breath trapped somewhere too far to reach.  

“Hey, I’ve got it, it’s okay—” Oliver’s voice, breaking through the noise—  

The world tilted. The couch blurred out of focus. The colors she’d found so beautiful moments ago curdled into static.  

Then strong arms caught her.  

And the world went dark.  

---

Heat clawed up her neck, her skin slick with sweat. Her pulse swung wildly—first too slow, a dull echo in her ears, then too fast, hammering against her ribs. The couch dipped beneath her knees. Oliver’s voice blurred through the ringing, somewhere behind her. Then his arms were around her, lifting her before she could fall all the way.  

“Hey, I’ve got you,” he whispered, his voice shaking. “It’s okay, I’ve got you.”  
But it wasn’t okay. The room spun, the air too thin, her body too heavy. The heat kept flashing to cold, and the nausea rolled through her like waves.  

He carried her down the hall, each step jarring, his breath catching in uneven bursts. When he laid her on the bed, the sheets felt like ice.  
“Let me change you, you’re burning up.”  
She tried to nod, but the cold came rushing in so fast it hurt. The chill sank deep, and she gasped. “Don’t—please—it’s too cold.” The words barely made it out, half-breathed, half-thought.  

Her teeth chattered. She was drenched in sweat but freezing. The contrast made her dizzy. Oliver’s hands hovered, helpless, and she could see the fear in his face—the kind that comes from not knowing what to do.  

“I should take you to the hospital,” he said, voice breaking.  
She shook her head weakly. “No… can’t… you’ll get in trouble.”  
“Baby, please—”  
“No hospital. Just… let me close my eyes.”  

But every time she closed them, her body stopped. The breathing reflex vanished. She drifted somewhere dark and still until his voice yanked her back.  

   “Breathe, baby. Come on. Look at me. Please—”  

The panic in him bled through the words. He was crying now, shaking her shoulders gently, tears falling onto her collarbone.  

She wanted to speak, to tell him she was sorry—for scaring him, for puking, for being so damn difficult—but her lips wouldn’t move right. Everything felt slow, syrup-thick. Her arms were heavy and tingling, her chest squeezed tight.  

She caught fragments of his voice—“I love you, I need you, I can’t do this without you”—but they came in waves, fading in and out like a bad signal. Her mind was fracturing under the noise. Thoughts split apart before they could finish. And underneath them all was that sound—*hahxydbjsiansbehcucnej*—a string of nonsense syllables that looped endlessly, behind every thought, between every word, rising until it was all she could hear.  

She tried to cry but no tears came. Her body was past the point of release. She shivered, then burned, then shivered again. Oliver kept adjusting her—propping her up, laying her down, trying to keep her breathing steady—but she felt like she was drifting away each time he moved her.  

Her consciousness flickered in and out. Sometimes she saw the ceiling, sometimes nothing at all. Each time she surfaced, her mind begged for rest, but rest felt like dying.  

“Oliver?” she managed to whisper.  
He leaned close. “I’m here. I’m right here.”  
“What happened?”  
“You got sick, baby, it’s okay, I’ve got you.”  
But she couldn’t remember. Each time she asked, the answer slipped away. The confusion felt like drowning.  

She could feel his heartbeat through his chest where he held her, could feel his breath against her temple, fast and unsteady. The air around them pulsed. She was shaking so hard she thought her bones would rattle apart.  

“I’m sorry,” she whispered, over and over. “I’m so sorry.”  
“Stop. Don’t you dare apologize,” he said, voice cracking. “You just breathe. Please, just breathe.”  

She tried. She really did. But the static roared louder, the world spun faster, and her chest clenched until there was nothing left but white noise and the faint memory of his hands—warm, desperate, unrelenting—holding her to the world as she slipped further from it.  

---

The static rose once more—then broke.  

Silence.  
Real silence.  

When she finally drew in a breath that reached all the way down, it startled both of them. The air was heavy but real. Her chest ached. Her skin prickled. The world existed again.  

Oliver had her wrapped in every blanket he could find, his body curved protectively around hers. She was on her left side, his arm slung over her waist, his chest pressed against her back. His breath trembled against her ear.  

   “You’re okay,” he whispered, voice raw. “You’re safe. Just breathe with me. Inhale… exhale…”  

She followed his words—clumsy, uneven. The world slowly reassembled itself: the hum of the fan, the faint whine of Sampson outside, the salt on her lips. Her body was sore, her mouth bone-dry, her skin slick with sweat. But she was breathing.  

Oliver’s voice steadied with every count.  
   “Inhale… exhale…”  
   “That’s it, baby. You’re doing so good.”  

Her mind cleared just enough to whisper, “I’m here.”  
“I know,” he said, pressing his face into her hair. “You scared me to death.”  

When her trembling eased, he lifted her carefully, carrying her to the bathroom. The mirror caught her reflection—eyes glassy, skin pale, hair clinging to her forehead. He cleaned her gently, wiping her face with a damp towel, his hands trembling.  
   “I love you,” he murmured. “You’re so beautiful. You’re okay.”  

He brushed her hair back, kissed her temple, and guided her back to bed. He tucked her in, pulling the blankets up to her chin, making sure not a single corner slipped loose. Then he ran to the kitchen, grabbed a cold drink, pressed it to her lips until she could sip.  

When he climbed back into bed, he gathered her close again, his chest against her spine, his hand splayed over her heartbeat.  

He didn’t sleep. He just watched her breathe, every inhale a silent thank-you, every exhale a release.  

And as she drifted off, exhausted and sore, the last thing she felt was his breath in her hair and the whispered rhythm of the words that carried her through the dark—  
   “I love you. You’re safe. You’re still here.”

The light was gray when she woke, not gold.  
Thin, colorless morning pressing through the blinds. The room smelled of salt and sweat and something metallic—fear that hadn’t quite faded.  

Idalia blinked slowly. For a moment she didn’t know where she was, only that her body hurt. Her chest ached with each breath, but the breaths were steady, real. The blankets were tangled and damp. Her head throbbed, her throat scraped raw. But she was alive.  

Oliver was beside her, half propped against the headboard, still awake. His eyes were swollen and red; he’d been crying long after she’d fallen asleep. A lamp still burned on the nightstand, its light harsh against his hollow face.  

“Hey,” she whispered, voice rough.  

He looked down instantly, relief breaking across his exhaustion. “You’re awake.”  
“I’m here,” she said, though her voice trembled on it.  

He exhaled like someone letting go of a held breath that had lasted hours. “You scared me so bad,” he said. “You stopped breathing so many times…” His voice cracked, the words unraveling.  

She reached weakly for his hand. “What time is it?”  
“Just after six.”  
“So I was out for… what? Eight hours?”  
“Since around ten. You kept fading in and out. I didn’t sleep at all.”  

He rubbed his face, the motion shaky. “Every time you stopped moving, I thought it was over. I was sure I’d lost you.”  

Her heart twisted. She squeezed his hand, thumb tracing the callouses across his knuckles. “You didn’t lose me,” she said softly.  
“I almost did,” he murmured. “And it’s my fault.”  

“Oliver—”  
“I said it would be fine. I said we’d be safe. You trusted me.” His voice rose, cracking into anger that was really grief. “You trusted me, and I almost—”  

She pressed a trembling hand to his cheek, forcing him to look at her. “You saved me,” she whispered. “You held me here. You didn’t let me go.”  

He closed his eyes, jaw flexing, tears sliding down again. “I kept thinking—if you died, it would’ve been my fault forever.”  

Her thumb brushed the tear away. “You kept me alive.”  

He didn’t answer, only pulled her gently against him. His heartbeat pounded hard beneath her ear. She could feel the exhaustion in it—the long, sleepless night carved into its rhythm.  

They stayed like that for a long time. No words. Just the hum of the fan and Sampson whining faintly outside the door. The world was waking up—birds, cars, the slow light of another day. But inside their room, everything still felt suspended.  

When she finally stirred, it was to the feeling of his fingers tracing idle circles on her back. He looked dazed, half-hollow, but softer now.  

“You need to rest,” she murmured.  
“I can’t,” he said. “Every time I close my eyes, I see you stop breathing.”  
“Then let me hold you,” she whispered. “It’s over.”  

He hesitated, then nodded, the fight leaving his shoulders. He lay down beside her, still fully dressed, one arm around her waist. His breathing slowed for the first time since the night before.  

The sky outside began to lighten. Gold threaded through the gray. The house creaked, alive again. Sampson scratched at the door, and one of the cats meowed from somewhere down the hall—sounds of ordinary life creeping back in.  

Idalia’s body still trembled now and then, echoes of the fear that had lived in her bones for hours. But she was breathing. He was breathing.  

After a while, Oliver finally drifted off, his body heavy and warm against hers. His face softened in sleep, the sharp lines of worry fading. She could still see the salt tracks where his tears had dried.  

She lay awake, staring at the faint gold strip of light growing across the ceiling. Her chest still hurt, but it was the ache of being alive, not the pain of dying.  

She thought of how close she’d come to not hearing him breathe again—how easily the world could have kept spinning without her. The thought hollowed her out and filled her up all at once.  

Her eyes stung. She pressed her face into his shoulder and let the tears come—quiet, grateful, alive.  

Outside, the morning grew brighter. The hum of the fan mixed with the sounds of life—Sampson’s tail thumping the floor, Cameron moving through the kitchen, the faint clink of mugs.  

And in the small, still world of their room, Idalia whispered into the space between their hearts:  

   “I’m still here.”  

Oliver stirred slightly, even in sleep, his hand tightening at her waist.  

   “I know,” he murmured.

***Thoroughly enjoyed***
- **1. Victoria:** Shocked by how much I enjoyed it, like everything about it. Even the Uber Eats drivers were the nicest people ever. 
- **2. Calgary/Banff:** Stampede, mountains, pretty self-explanatory in a lot of ways I think. It's a part of the world where you can just tell that people really *want* to be and are happy to be. 

***Enjoyed, would go back easily***
- **3. Vancouver:** Stunning environment, amazing hiking, Granville Island, friendlier locals than I expected.
- **4. Lake Huron, Ontario:** Ontario has some splendid provincial parks and nice small towns. So much serenity around there. 
- **5. Whistler:** Expensive, and I don't ski, but it's still Whistler.
- **6. Windsor/Essex County:** Shocked the hell out of me that I enjoyed it so, but I enjoyed the War of 1812 history, Amherstburg, Leamington, Pelee, and pizza.

***Enjoyed overall, but no rush to return***
- **7. Montreal:** Easy enough to bike around in, great views of the city abound, great coffee, people are mixed, shitty airport.
- **8. Ottawa:** I loved the Fairmont Chateau Laurier hotel, the parliament tour, and the views across the Ottawa River. The locals were friendly enough with the VAST exception of the airport staff, whose rudeness put Pearson or US airports to shame, IMO. 
- **9. Niagara Falls:** Really junky city, but the falls are always worth it. Niagara-on-the-Lake is neat.
- **10. Toronto:** There isn't a real ""there"" there, IMO. ROM is a world-class museum. Never have had a bad visit in the GTA, but greater Torontonians are either as sweet as pie or quite nasty. Older Torontonians tend to be much kinder than younger ones, IMO. 

***Terrible trip***
- **11. Halifax:** The only redeeming points were Peggy's Cove and Lunenburg, both nearby. Otherwise, the food was mediocre. The hotel was expensive yet somewhat dated. Customer service wasn't a thing. The only friendly and warm people I met were other tourists. The airport had very poor signage for buses and rideshare and very slow security for such a small airport, not to mention oddly aggressive taxi drivers not afraid to approach people waiting at the baggage carousels. I even had a total asswipe of an Uber driver right in town who I didn't bother tipping. Not to mention, the rain and wind were torrential for most of the trip and when it wasn't raining, the harbourfront still felt somewhat desolate. ***Seriously, I was extremely disappointed in Halifax and I have no desire to return.***

The last few weeks have been brutal deadlines, pressure, stress. I’m behind in almost everything. My history essays are sprawling and aimless. My artwork looks lazy and uninspired. I’ve been putting in hours but getting nowhere.

And I haven’t been sleeping.

Not because of nightmares. Just… time. There’s never enough of it. I know that sounds like a cliché “I’m a student, I don’t sleep” but it’s true. My schedule’s a mess. I’ll spend an hour trying to start a painting, then spiral into panic because I haven’t done the reading for a lecture I forgot I even had. But this week, somehow, I managed to submit everything.

Not well. Not proudly. But done. For the first time in ages, I could finally breathe. No more all-nighters. No more caffeine-fueled essay sessions or crying over unblended acrylics at 3AM. So I slept And then I dreamt somethinh wrong.

It wasn’t just unsettling. It meant something. It felt like a message.

I was in a wheat feild. It was overgrown and dry, flowing one with the wind. The clouds hung high above me pale, loose, not threatening rain. The strangest thing was the sun: it was both rising and setting at once, dancing between golden and pink light like the sky couldn't make up its mind.

There was nothing on the horizon. Not a tree. Not a distant barn or faraway city tower. Just wheat. Endless painted waves of dry gold rolling over hills and hills of fertile land. And I,  I was the first thing to ever touch it.

The stalks brushed against my legs. They felt sharp at first. But over time, they softened. I left a long trail behind me as I wandered, the pods hissing gently with every step.

I walked for what felt like hours. The only sound was a shallow melody from a type of bug crickets, maybe. Or something else that sings.

Then I saw it.

A blur. Dark. Human-shaped. Far in the distance.

I ran to it like a moth chasing fire. I don’t know why. Something about it pulled me in. But then I tripped and when I got back up. it was gone. I called out. Nothing answered, just a breeze passing through the place where he had stood. Still, I walked on. I crested the hill where the figure had been, and that’s when the land shifted.

The wheat was gone. All of it. In its place, a cold, barren field. Dead grass and pale dirt. The only thing in sight now was a building, a castle. The young golden pink sky now grown, red and dark blue 

It rose in front of me like a monument to madness. Its towers leaned on one another. Its bridges led to nothing. The structure looked ancient, impossible. It wanted to be seen. It was now called to me.

I turned back, just once, and saw that the trail I had left in the wheat was gone. The land had healed. The stalks stood tall again, like I’d never touched them. Like I was never there

I went toward the castle.

The doors were impossibly tall. They didn’t budge at first. I pushed with all my strength, and eventually, they gave just enough for me to slip through.

The inside was dark and choking with dust. Fire lit the walls. Sunlight bled through stained glass the color of rich gold. The air tasted old.

A hallway stretched out before me, lined with huge paintings, each one covered by a sheet. One was only half-covered I looked beneath the cloth.

A knight. Full silver armor. Every inch of it carved with strange, violent incantations  that looked hammered in. Old, evil symbols I didn’t recognize. I couldn’t tell if the armor was meant to repel or welcome darkness.

I didn’t dare lift the cloth to see who or what wore it. At the end of the hall was another set of doors. These opened easier.

Inside: a vast, candlelit dining room. The ceiling stretched upward forever. A chandelier dangled over a table that could seat eighty. Forty chairs on each side. Portraits hung from every wall kings, queens, kingdoms and the lay of the land. All of them staring down with petrified strokes of paint.

And at the far end, before a massive stone fireplace, there was a throne.

Slumped in it was the thing I had seen in the field.

It wasn’t human.

It wasn’t anything.

Its flesh looked sewn together, stretched like old leather or poorly stitched textiles. Its jaw was long. almost animalistic but just plain wrong. Too many teeth. No nose, just a hole. No eyes either Just skin-wrapped sockets that never ended, infinity deep.

And misplaced horns twisted like deer antlers, black and overgrown. Its arm, long and bony, reached toward something in front of it a old, silver, crown with sharp peaks almost like it was forged out of daggers 

Its fingers were skeletal and ended in talons. The arm was wrapped in armor like the knight’s, but cracked and darkened. Similar but warped into a different time.

The creature wore a thick, black cape. The collar was fur, mismatched  prey and predator, hunter and hunted.

It was lifeless.

Hunched.

Dead.

I don’t know why I walked closer. I dont know why I reached out and Touched that crown.

Becacuse That’s when its hand twitched.

I fell backward, scrambling away. Its arm twitched again sharper this time, jerking like a broken puppet. Then it leaned forward, using the table for support.

A sharp crack echoed as its other arm landed with weight. Then, like something rising from a grave, it started to stand.

Its joints popped. Snapped. Every vertebra in its back cracked like breaking branches. Eight feet tall, maybe more with the horns.

I backed away. It was still waking up, if you can call that thing waking.

Its neck bent up, far too slowly. Its jaw opened, wide and yawning. From its throat came a gasping noise that became a growl.
And then unmistakably the word “Who” it sounded angry like a pharo raising to meet a tomb raider

Its eyeless head faced me now. Somehow, it saw me.

It took a step. Dust poured off its robes like falling ash, it was heavy and looked like a toddler taking its first steps but its second step looked sturdier and the third was muscle memory 

I turned. The door wouldn’t open. I slammed into it, again and again. The steps behind me were slow but growing faster. the door burst open. I fell through and landed on my stomach 

I don’t remember crawling. I just remember being on my feet, running through the castle entrance.

The creature didn’t follow. Not fully.

Back in the feilds I turned to look once I was far enough.

He was standing there. Looking at me like an aristocrat. Watching and studying.

For the first time, those eyeless sockets burned. A pair of yellow lights stared through the dusk. Then slowly… he put on the crown and closed the door.

I collapsed in the wheat.

I became part of the land again.

And then I woke up.

I gasped back to life and sat up in bed, covered in a cold sweat. It was still dark out I’d woken up before even my earliest alarm. There was no way I was going back to sleep. Not with that thing still fresh in my mind.

But it wasn’t fear keeping me up. It was infatuation.

I reached for one of my old sketchpads, thumbed through the blank pages, and started drawing.

I didn’t have a name for it yet, but later I started calling him the King.

The kettle boiled and I poured myself a coffee. Three pages of sketches the impossible castle, his face (or what I think was a face), the crown, the painting in the hallway. None of it was my best work, but something about it felt alive. There was potential.

My first class that day was my art workshop. Nothing special just standard uni stuff. But as I packed up, my professor came over to give me some pointers on the mess I’d been working on.
My sketchbook was poking out of my bag. She saw it, casually asked if I’d drawn anything new.

Proud of the chicken scratches I’d made that morning, I flipped to the King’s horrid visiage.

She stared for a moment. Then she gasped not in horror, but excitement.
Within minutes, we were talking about scrapping my current piece and starting a new final project, built around what she called “this surge of inspiration.”

That was it. The King’s portrait was now my new final piece.

And for the first time in weeks maybe months  I felt good. Like I had something real to work toward. Like I’d earned that dream.

But I didn’t know then what I know now.
That it wasn’t just a dream. That he wasn’t just some nightmare.

That he was something older. Something hungrier. Something primordial.

I’ll have to continue this later. I’ve got a lecture in ten minutes and I really can’t afford to fall further behind.",4,1762136478.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

I looked to see what came through the door, it was Amy, seeing it was just her I put my head back into my pillow. I will admit her smile and joyful radiance poisoned my attitude almost making me green. “Good morning Sarah.” Amy said happily walking to her half of the dorm. “Mmmh” I growled softly into my pillow of protection. “Oh come one Sarah” she said sitting on my bed, I think the foot of it. It was hard to tell from how light she was, her thin hand rubbed my back “I’m sorry about your parents.” She said for the first time, frowning at the words, as if they stung her the same way it pierced me. “It’s fine, we always joked that I would go to college and forget about them” I chuckled the tears building a small parapet. “Guess they forgot about me.” I broke down, and Amy held me as if she were family keeping me close and comforting me, I hugged her “thank you Amy, I am glad we met again.” “Me too, Sarah.” She stood up and walked over to her desk, her smile returning from its short holiday. “So I have something for you.” She said holding something behind her back. “Yeah what is it?” I asked waiving my hand over, she always kept my mail from me and after the episode I just had I was not really ready to go back to playing friendly games. “Merry Christmas” she said handing me a plane ticket. “What’s this for?” I asked reading it over. She giggled “well since my you won’t be able to spend christmas with your parents, I talked it over with mine, and they would love to have you.” She said leaning against her desk her eyes begging for a positive response. I mulled it over for a second, the choices, go with her and have a nice warm and semi religious holiday, or go and eat ramen in an empty house with my dog. “I’ll go” I said, my eyes blank and wet, I needed an escape, any escape would satisfy me. Amy and her family would be my escape. Amy of course was overjoyed, I smiled rolled over and slept off the rest of previous nights party. The airport was sterile, bright, loud, I now understood the feeling of limbo, but after the tsa prechecks and heading over to our gate I bought Amy and I some coffee, it was good, warm, smooth, bittersweet. Amy made a christmas playlist, her cheer was infectious. She made christmas seem magical, like those old stop motion specials. We boarded, Cain stayed by us, our little guardian angel through our flight making sure I took my meds and nosing me reminding me that the turbulence was normal and I would be fine. “Thank you Amy” I whispered, tapping her shoulder, “for what?” She said sitting upward into a lean to have those bright shining blue eyes staring in mine. “For being so kind to me, I know we live different lives but, thank you.” I said smiling. I placed my hand on hers, just to give some small amount of kindness back to this heaven sent guardian angel.

I was in a 6 year, ONLINE relationship before my current relationship with my boyfriend (2 months irl). Me and my ex were texting almost 24/7 because we both were,  basically, homeschooled and unemployed. We broke up, blah blah blah,.now I'm with my boyfriend. He's, an absolute angel. I really, REALLY do love him, but I have a small issue. He's, WEIRD. He is extremely dry over texts sometimes, to the point it's like, he seems annoyed I'm taking up his time by texting him kinda dry. Like Roblox is more important than texting his girlfriend, sorta dry, BUT, then we hang out in person and he's talking to me and he's all cute and lovey and sweet and oh my god he's so precious. We haven't seen each other in about 2 weeks, and today after work, I decided to go to his work place and get a coffee. Low and behold, he gave me my coffee (and made it 😳). We spoke non stop for two minutes, he did this thing where he looked down at my coffee, at me, back at my drink, back at me and like, I swear a massive smile grew on his face. I told him I got hurt at work today and he seemed so concerned and looked at my hand where I was hurt. My question is, is this... NORMAL for guys? Especially irl relationships. Please help because I keep seeing videos talking about signs that guys aren't interested and the texting thing is like that, but then he's so adorable in person.

so there’s this guy right. kashmiri, nit warangal, decent looking, quiet, clean vibe i sent follow req and he accepted right back and we started texting he felt like. the kind of guy who doesn’t chase attention, doesn’t follow random girls. looked like the calm type, the “i mind my own business” type. i liked that about him. maybe too much.
20 mins later i just asked for his pic. yeah, that’s it. not flirting, not weird. just curiosity. and he literally called me absurd. 💀 like bro relax, i didn’t ask for ur aadhaar card. i swear that word stuck in my head for days. absurd?? me?? for asking for a damn photo?

anyway, i still don’t even know why i cared so much. maybe coz i had a bad day, maybe coz he felt like something normal in all my chaos. so i texted him again, something honest, something real. poured my heart out, said it wasn’t about him, it was about me trying not to fall apart. it wasn’t some dramatic confession. it was just me trying to stay sane.
Which is like 
[hey
i know this msg probably feels unnecessary maybe it is but i needed to write it anyway
that day when i texted u it wasn’t about flirting or curiosity it was just a bad day where everything felt too heavy and i wanted something that felt normal u just happened to be there and i reached out not coz i thought u were special but coz i was falling apart and didn’t know what else to do
u can think it was stupid honestly i agree it was but it was also human ppl break down in diff ways mine just showed up as a text
i’ve replayed that moment too many times wondering why i said anything at all and i realized i wasn’t tryna start something i was just tryna not disappear inside myself
so this isn’t abt u this is an apology to myself for being harsh for calling my own heart too much for thinking that feeling things makes me embarrassed
u don’t need to reply or understand i just wanted to close the loop quietly without shame
if u ever remember me don’t think of that random girl who texted think of someone who had a weak moment and chose honesty instead of silence
that’s all nothing dramatic just someone forgiving herself]

and what did he do? blocked. straight up blocked. 💀💀 didn’t even say a word. not a “hey i’m not comfortable,” not even a “lol ok.” just vanish. like bruh.

i sat there wondering if i was the villain in a story that didn’t even exist. like he didn’t even know me. i’m a literal stranger. but somehow he had the power to make me feel stupid for feeling anything at all.

maybe he’s got a gf. maybe he’s just emotionally stunted. maybe i was just too real for someone who lives behind filters and “professional student” energy. idc anymore. coz at least i know i was honest.

he can go be mysterious and silent and drink his black coffee or whatever. i’ll be here building my life, studying, glowing up, writing this rage out instead of begging for a text.
roast me sympathize or tell me the best one liner i can use in my revenge poem i want all opinions

Today coincidentally after I ate eggs and toast around 4 pm (didn’t consume anything else besides my usual coffee around 10 am) I broke out with the worse hive like rash ever had in my whole life… mainly on my whole torso, arms, back, a bit on chest. I seriously thought was gonna go anaphylactic or something because of how intense and how fast it was spreading for no apparent reason. Been home all day. Did nothing different. No laundry new detergent perfume nothing like that.

I will put mostly zoomed in photos to spare me embarrassment bc had a C-section 7 months ago and still learning to love my new stomach after two kids lol. I have more pics in camera roll if anyone would wanna talk priv for whatever reason/ see.

The rash on arms were more bumps rather than welts but the ones on my stomach were INTENSE huge welts. After about hour or two after taking some Zyrtec is went down and is just pink now no bumps or welts.

I also alwayssss had pretty intense and inconvenient GI issues but never really went to doctor over it or ran any tests on that just been something I always just dealt with and ignored. Treated at home with electrolytes and just enduring it lol. Zofran in past for nausea. I also always have heavy brain fog which been something struggled with for awhile. GI issues since was teen. And the hives on and off for years but getting more intense this last year.

Some other symptoms always had but not sure if related: 
Migraines, weird pressure in head all time, sometimes achey, brain fog/forgetfulness, diarrhea all time like and when ever have to use bathroom it’s usually sudden and painful cramps, sometimes I get shakey like low blood sugar feeling random, itchiness, blurryish vision??, cramps intense, acid reflux, spasms. 

Is this rash giving gluten allergy tho? Do you get rashes like this with food allergies???

Would a simple allergy test give me my answers if can get my ignorant doctor to give me one? (I say ignorant bc brushed off my ongoing on and off hive episodes years ago as poison ivy despite me never leaving house) he never runs tests on me just blames everything on anxiety and throws random medications rather than testing etc.  I should probably switch doctors but I’m on state insurance and they are limited lol.

This implies that it's a parody of, or Hazbin Hotel's version of, something called ''Behind closed doors''.

I looked into it, and the only result I could find was a book behind the same name written by B.A. Paris. I've never read it, but based on the description it seems to be about a man and a woman who are newly married and seem perfect. The man is a dedicated and respected attorney, and the wife is a great homemaker/cook/gardener. However, the two are completely inseparable, and nobody ever sees the wife on her own. She never answers her phone. She doesn't work, but she can never meet for coffee. She remains slim despite cooking so many meals. I'm assuming that it's about an abusive domestic situation.

**hdfidelity presents**

# *The Langley Directive*  

---

# **Episode 2 — “The Coup That Wasn’t”**

Morning at Langley began, as always, with the sound of nothing.
Nothing but the hum of a thousand fluorescent bulbs, the shuffle of papers that would never be read, and the faint hiss of the HVAC system desperately trying to circulate the same recycled air that had been there since the Cold War.

Director **Leonard Graves** sat behind his desk, reading a memo he’d written himself thirty years ago. It was yellowed and irrelevant, but at least it had been written by someone competent.
He took a sip of bourbon-laced coffee, reread the phrase *“Plausible Deniability”*, and smiled faintly. There was poetry in that.

Across the compound, **Deputy Director Conrad Vale** was rehearsing his speech to camera.
Not a press conference — no, not yet — but a *pre-recorded internal message to all CIA employees*, to be distributed as a “motivational address.”
He stood before a digital backdrop of the American flag dissolving into binary code.

“Today,” he began, adjusting his tie, “we face not only external threats, but the challenge of remaining relevant.”
He paused, gauging his own reflection in the teleprompter. “Legacy leadership,” he continued, “has brought us far. But legacy also means… letting go.”

He smiled. It was a politician’s smile: polite, photogenic, venomous.
The camera crew nodded approvingly.
Vale liked that.

---

Denise Ward had already seen the speech. Twice.
She’d been the one to sign the studio booking, after all, and she knew what it meant. Conrad Vale was preparing the coup he thought Leonard Graves wouldn’t see coming.

She typed a short note into her personal folder labeled *“Insurance”*:

> **VALE — INITIATING SUCCESSION PLAN (AGAIN).**

Then she printed the note and filed it under *Miscellaneous*. Denise trusted paper more than clouds. Clouds were for weather and fools.

---

By 10:00 AM, rumors had begun to circulate.
Someone in Strategic Comms claimed Graves had already agreed to step down.
Someone in HR said they’d seen a “draft farewell memo.”
Someone else swore they overheard Vale calling a reporter “buddy.”

No one noticed that the rumor trail all led back to Denise.

---

Graves received the news with the same mild irritation as one receives a parking ticket.
He was on his second cigarette of the day — a habit that had survived both policy bans and three Surgeon Generals.

“They think I’m resigning,” he said flatly.  
Denise nodded. “It’s a popular theory.”  
“Am I?”  
“Not that I know of, sir.”  
“Good,” Graves said, extinguishing the cigarette in his coffee cup.   “Then let’s make it official that I am.”

He smiled. Denise smiled back. She understood perfectly.

---

The next morning, *Politico* published a headline:

> **Sources: CIA Director to Step Down Amid Leadership Transition**

Vale nearly choked on his protein smoothie.  
“Who the hell leaked that?” he barked.  
Nadia Quinn looked up from her tablet. “You did, technically. We just… pre-briefed the press.”  
“Pre-briefed?”  
“It’s what you told me to do!”  
Vale paced in circles, eyes darting toward the glass wall of his office as if the transparency itself were a betrayal.

He stormed down the hall to Graves’ office.  
Graves was reading *Politico*, glasses perched low, utterly serene.

“Leonard, I can explain—” Vale began.  
“No need. I’ve already congratulated you.”  
“Congratulated me?”  
“On your promotion,” Graves said, folding the newspaper.   “I assume you’ve already written my eulogy.”

Vale blinked. “You’re not resigning.”  
Graves smiled thinly. “No. But you might be.”

---

That afternoon, a second story broke.  
Another leak — this one to *The Washington Post*:

> **Deputy Director Under Investigation for Unauthorized Media Disclosures**

Vale read it twice. Then again.  
His phone buzzed: a text from Denise.

> “Rumor control memo drafted. Should I release?”

He typed back furiously:

> “No leaks came from me.”  
> She replied instantly:  
> “That’s exactly what someone who leaked would say.”

---

By evening, Langley was in chaos.  
Half the staff believed Graves was retiring.  
The other half believed Vale was being investigated.  
Avery Lott, still traumatized by last week’s “Morning Brief,” tried to mediate by emailing both sides a peace memo titled *“Restoring Institutional Trust.”*
He attached the wrong file.

Within minutes, the National Security Advisor’s office received a PDF titled *“Succession Contingency:   Post-Graves Era (DRAFT).”*  
It included detailed notes about Vale’s planned “strategic transition” — plus, somehow, Graves’ bourbon order.

---

At 8:45 PM, an emergency video call was convened.
Vale, Graves, Nadia, and two congressional aides appeared in pixelated boxes.  
Everyone talked at once.

Vale insisted there was “a campaign of disinformation.”
Graves calmly nodded and said, “Yes. Yours.”  
The aides muttered something about “internal cohesion.”
Nadia tried to freeze the video feed — pretended it was lagging.

Finally, Graves spoke clearly:

> “This Agency has survived coups, counter-coups, and committee hearings. It will survive this. What it may not survive is LinkedIn.”

Then he clicked “Leave Meeting.”

---

Hours later, Vale sat alone in his darkened office.
The television flickered — CNN’s late-night anchor reporting:

> “Confusion at the CIA tonight as conflicting reports suggest both Director and Deputy may be under internal review…”

Vale muted it.  
In the reflection of the glass, he saw his own face, pale and furious.  
Behind him, the shadows of the office stretched long and thin — like surveillance cables reaching across time.

He poured himself a drink. Bourbon, neat.  
He hated that it tasted like Graves.

---

Meanwhile, in the basement archives, Denise methodically shredded three folders — two labeled *VALE* and one labeled *GRAVES (For Later).*  
She hummed an old Sinatra tune and fed the papers in, one page at a time.  
When she was done, she wrote a single note in her ledger:

> **Day 2: Both sides leaking. Order restored.**

She switched off the light and closed the file room door.  
From the darkness, the hum of the shredders continued — steady, rhythmic, eternal.

The hardest part of it all. Was how easy it was to start talking. To find ourselves laughing together over the bad drinks (picked a shitty coffee shop that wouldn't get 'tainted'). 

I told him how unfair it was the way he ended things without leaving me a moment to speak up. How sure, for him was long time coming. But to me, unexpected considering we were planning trips yesterday. How as his girlfriend and long time friend, I deserved more than the way he handled things. 

I didn't expect anything to come from me saying it, besides getting to finish what I never had got a chance to back that day. Closure if you will. 
And yet I was still surprised at how he didn't react to me once again opening up my heart and being vulnerable about this and offer any apology. 

I'm not okay. Nowhere near. I love him with every bit of my soul still. And would have done/did everything for him...But in that moment. I knew I was better off without him.

I will always be a little broken. He will always carry that little piece of me.
 I hope I will hear his name or bump into him and not crumble at my door and sob for hours. 

I hope one day I can look back at our time together and not fall apart. Not feel the emptiness and pain that I'm feeling now. 

Does it get better?

1omzp0v,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1omzp0v/only_once_have_i_seen_the_door/,Only Once Have I Seen the Door,"Hey everyone. My name’s Jack. I’ve decided to write all this here. Maybe it’ll help me make sense of it all and keep a solid track on my chronology of things. Maybe someone out there has felt something similar. I doubt it, but hey, the internet can be a strange place.

First, some background. I’m not a crazy person. At least, I’d like to hope I’m not. I’m a pretty normal guy. I’m going to college. I have a part time job at a fast-food place, I’ve got ex-girlfriends, I drive a ford focus, blah blah blah. But, my whole life, I’ve had these moments. They’re hard to describe, so I’ll pose you this analogy to give you the right foundation.

I have a lot of these vague glimpses of memories, from when I was a very young child, of my own parents socialising, having a drink with friends, hosting events, whatever, where I’d wander downstairs to get a snack or something and I’d feel a little bit caught off guard for a moment by the sight of strangers in my house that my parents seemed to be getting on fine with. My parents would try to introduce me to their friend or cousin that I didn’t recognise, but I’d forget about whoever they were shortly after. I feel like a lot of people have early childhood memories like that, because when we were very young children, our parents were naturally younger too and were spending more time keeping up with friends and whatnot.

Sometimes, I’ll get a glimpse of something like a wine glass or a lit candle on a table and feel myself floating away, back into vague flashes and feelings of a dinner party my parents had one night with the in-laws or something like that. And that’s what I’m getting at: random feelings of recognition in your surroundings that give you hard to pin down senses of familiarity, leading you back to half-formed memories. But the way I experience it is a bit different. It’s not Déjà vu. It’s more like a stutter. A momentary glitch in my own perception. I like to call it static.

It usually happens when I’m run-down, sleep-deprived, or after smoking too much weed too quick. Like, for example, I’ll be lying in bed hungover, listening to the low hum of my desk fan, and for a split second, the hum will resolve. It’ll sound like a distant crowd of people cheering excitedly about something, or a woman singing a song in a different language. The weirdest part, then, is the feeling that follows. The absolute, bone-deep realisation that I’ve been listening to those noises for the last five minutes, I just hadn’t realised it yet. It’s like a retroactive certainty. My conscious mind is always the last to know.

I’ve felt this “static” with sights, too. Like, a particular shade of peeling yellow paint on a bus stop that I gazed at for a few minutes before suddenly feeling sure I’d seen it on the wall of a hospital room somewhere I’d been in once when I was a kid. The feeling is never, “Hey, that looks familiar.” It’s “There it is again. It’s been here the whole time.”

I’ve always written it off. A trick of a tired brain. My synapses misfiring. It’s always been so easy to disregard, because it was so rare. That was before everything that’s happened.

How it starts is I’d already been feeling hungover and out of it from the house party I’d been at the previous day. It was 2 pm by the time I was up from the couch. I started my day, just like Anthony and the others waking up at his flat, with a breakfast of leftover Chinese poorly re-heated in the microwave, a glass of Dr. Pepper from the bottle we’d been using last night for mixers, and a few bong rips. So, by the time we’d gotten ourselves sufficiently baked, it was 4 pm and I was walking to the bus stop with our group. Anthony’s flat is in an estate about a twenty-minute walk down some barren roads and suburbs away from the town where me and him grew up. We were walking with some of the other guys and gals from the party with the intention of getting a bus back over to where our community college is, an hour or so away, where most of us were living in student accommodation. But somewhere along the way, in the scorching heat of the day and our hazy state, we took a wrong turn. Even Anthony wasn’t sure exactly where we were. We had a loose idea, since we were still near the huge woods of the state park that enclosed around much of the area between Anthony’s estate and our hometown. As we kept walking and chatting aimlessly, we eventually stumbled upon a strange pub, a sort of half-bar, half-arcade that was set up across from an empty, dusty yard or lot. There were only a few run-down bungalows nearby.

We stared at the odd pub. I felt sure it was just a lame dive bar with a few arcade machines shoved in the corners to get 80’s nostalgic types all horny and drain them with shitty bar prices, but we were so bored and stoned that we saw the possibility of arcade games and freshly poured beers and thought, “Sure, why not.”

While everyone spent the following hours throwing back drinks in our elegantly dishevelled state in that crummy place, a strange sense of premonition in my mind, and Anthony’s too, I think, seemed to have sprouted. A strange feeling of growing dread, a sense of anticipation for some huge revelation. That feeling kept growing, something completely unknown and yet undeniable, as time passed into evening and then nightfall, as I continued drinking, trying to make conversation with people, chatting with girls I liked the look of, normal bar stuff. I remember there was this fat, nasty spider in one of the corners of the ceiling. It hadn’t made a web, it was just slowly skulking about in circles. I couldn’t take my eyes off it.

Now, my buddy Anthony is what you’d call an experienced tripper. He believes in expanding the mind, so to speak. I was always the cautious one. Anthony tapped on my shoulder late into the night and took me outside, where he showed me the tabs of acid he’d been talking about. I remember feeling that the moment was important. I mean that moment, standing outside that strange pub at night, staring across the road at that dusty yard and, behind it, the woods – I knew that I would remember that moment for the rest of my life. Even though nothing that special was really even going on. I knew I’d remember Anthony’s Marietta t-shirt. I’d remember the pile of tires scattered in the yard. I’d remember the rusty storm drain a few feet from where we stood at the pub’s entrance. We decided my first acid trip should be somewhere peaceful, in nature, so we picked one of the winding country roads around and through the state park woods, and started walking. Then we partook.

The come-up was fine. A little giddiness, the trees looking a bit more vibrant. Then I hit the peak. The world started to breathe. The asphalt of the road pulsed like a vein. Anthony was walking beside me, talking about the lifecycle of moss or something, his voice a steady, grounding presence. But then, a second voice started up.

It was also Anthony’s voice. But it wasn’t coming from beside me. It was inside my head, clear as day, as though he were sitting in an empty room right behind my eyes. He was commenting on my thoughts, narrating my panic.

“He’s thinking about the fan now,” the internal Anthony-voice said as I looked in utter disorientation at the real Anthony, calm and conversational. “He’s wondering if it’s all connected.”

 I stared at the real Anthony. His mouth was moving, talking about how the universe is all connected and that means busting a nut and getting a girl pregnant is basically the same as planting a tree sapling. The voice of Anthony in my head, however, was speaking directly to me.

“Dude, you okay?” the real Anthony asked. “You’re looking a little pale.”

That’s when I saw a third man off in the distance. About fifty feet ahead, standing off the path under the canopy of an ancient oak tree, was a man. He was tall, gaunt, looked to be in his forties, wearing a brown suit that looked decades out of date. He was just standing there, staring at the bark of the tree, running his fingers over it like he was reading Braille. There was something about his facial features, the exact movements of his hands. At first, it was just a vague sense of familiarity, and then I felt a spark within me. I felt those same feelings of static I’ve described throughout my life.

Something about a kid I’d known briefly in the early days of my childhood… his name was Douglas, I’m pretty sure. A third cousin, I think, or maybe a family friend’s son? Or was he some imaginary friend I had? No, he was definitely real, and he was in the family, but he wasn’t a close relative. I saw him maybe twice in my life. My one solid memory of him is from a family gathering when I was six. All the other kids were playing tag, but I found Douglas, who was a few years older than me, sitting alone by the creek. He was meticulously stacking these smooth, grey stones into a perfect, freestanding archway of sorts. Like a little depiction of a skyscraper jutting up from the ground. It was impossibly delicate. When he saw me watching, he didn’t smile. I thought it was cool and impressive, I remember, so I asked him how he’d made it. He just looked at me with these ancient, tired eyes and said, “It’s a door. But you mustn’t open it.” Then, he kicked it over and walked away.

The man standing underneath that tree was a grown-up version of Douglas. There was no doubt in my mind. I don’t know how I knew; I just knew it.

“Anthony, I slurred, my tongue feeling thick. “Do you see that guy? Under the tree?”

Anthony squinted. “What guy, man? There’s no one there. Hey, dude, constellations. They’re weird. It’s like they’re people in the sky. Or in the things between.”

I didn’t understand what Anthony meant. It felt all wrong. I saw movement in the distance. The man – Douglas – turned his head slowly and looked directly at me. His face was a mask of sorrow so deep it felt geological. Like he wasn’t really a brain behind it all, just pure misery.

*“This isn’t possible,”* I thought, my mind reeling. I realised how little this made sense, even if I was tripping. This couldn’t be Douglas. Douglas had only been a few years older than me as a kid. So this fortyish looking guy obviously can’t be him. And something else. My mom had told me about it years later. This memory took even longer to dredge up. It was the thought of constellations that brough it back to me. I don’t even know where the connection is in that. Douglas had had some mental break at some point, my Mom told me once years ago. He’s been in an institution since he was a teenager. He couldn’t even ne here right now, on top of him not being the right age. So why was my brain constructing all of this?

As I continued locking eyes with the stranger, as Anthony stared off into space beside me, the internal Anthony-voice answered that last question the second it’d occurred to me. “He’s the devil.”

The real Anthony was now looking across at me, concerned, asking if I needed to sit down. But in that moment, I knew two things for sure. The voice in my head was absolutely not my friend. And that man under the tree, whether he was Douglas or the devil or both or neither, was certainly real in a way that Anthony, the road, and the trees suddenly didn’t feel like they were. The filter wasn’t just down, it’d been torn off somehow, and I felt I could finally see the static that was there all along, even if I didn’t understand what that really meant.

Anthony decided to call things off then, and we went and got a motel to wait out the rest of the trip, Part of me wanted to forget about everything, to pretend it just never happened or that, like Anthony said, I’d just gotten unlucky and had an awful first trip. But the other part, the part that’s been listening to the hum of the static my whole life, knew that wasn’t an option. The door was open, and I couldn’t just close my eyes on what was inside.

Coming down from the trip was like being thrown back into a world made of cardboard after seeing the real scaffolding and foundations underneath. Everything felt thin and fake. Anthony drove me home, freaked out. He was saying, “Dude you were just having a bad trip. Even though it sucks that it was your first time, it happens.” But he wouldn’t look me in the eye.

The problem is, it didn’t stop when the acid wore off. The filter was gone. Permanently. Now, the static was everywhere.

The first time it happened, I was making some coffee for myself. I was listening to the background noise of the *drip-drip-drip* of the coffee machine while going to the fridge for the milk. I realised the sound had, somewhere in the background, suddenly sounded unmistakably like the unintelligible voice of someone from long ago in my past. Some girl, I think, some girl called Molly from my elementary school that I hadn’t really been friends with and could barely even remember at first.

I could suddenly make out what her voice was saying as it coalesced into three clear and whispered words before it vanished from my mind right as I’d realised it. And even today I can’t remember the tone of voice or punctuation as she spoke them, just the words themselves.

*Ask your grandpa*

I stood there, frozen, the carton of milk feeling somehow warm in my hand. This could’ve been nothing. It could’ve been exactly like before, just a random intense recognition, just like the moments of static I’d gotten in the past. “Ask your grandpa,” is a perfectly normal phrase in and of itself, after all. And it’s the kind of thing I might have a vague, mostly forgotten memory of someone almost completely irrelevant to my life saying once. And yet I felt sure that it wasn’t just a memory. I felt sure it meant something. That it was an instruction. I felt I had no real choice to make.

So I went to visit my grandfather. Me and Grandpa Francis have a good relationship. He’s seventy, but his mind is still mostly sharp, no signs of decline. He just gets a little wistful sometimes is all. I meet up with him at his house every few months to have a glass of something and a chat. He lives in a quiet, detached house about an hour away that smells of old books and liniment.

I gave him a call and said I was passing through his neck of the woods and was wondering if he wanted to catch up for a bit. He was more than welcome to it. When I arrived, he ushered me inside as always with a firm handshake. I didn’t know how to bring it all up. I just tried to stay engaged with Grandpa’s initial small talk and questions as he poured us each a glass of Captain Morgan’s spiced gold, before trying to subtly pivot and steer the conversation over. I did the only thing I could think of and asked him casually enough if he had any interesting or weird stories from when he was younger. Grandpa Francis is full of stories, and swapping them is something we’d often do. He got a suddenly distant look in his eyes.

“Well,” he said, and I could almost hear it in his relatively steady voice. Underneath the lazy composure, the sound of the cogs in his head gradually kicking into action.

“There was my old friend Petey. This was back around when we were no older than you are now. Just two guys with everywhere to be and nowhere to go. The two of us, working in the old autoshop all day long. Boy, you remember how it was, amount of times you’ve seen that dump over the years. But I was always happy with how things were. Quiet, you know. No fuss. That’s the life I wanted. But Petey thought there had to be more to the world. More to see, more to feel, more to experience. Always more with that fella. God, Jack, you remember all the stories I’ve told about the road trips, and the hiking, and the folks we’d meet at bars… wouldn’ta happened without Petey. He rattled my nerves to no end but I woulda lived a less full youth without him, no doubt.”

I leaned in. Grandpa had talked about his old friend Petey before. I felt this was going somewhere, but I played it cool. Grandpa took a sip and continued.

“Petey would go exploring when he was free. Exploring the roads, the abandoned houses, everywhere. ‘Specially the woods, the big state park, not far from where that friend of yours lives, actually.” At that, I had to supress a chill.

“Petey was stupid. You hear me? Stupid kid. Always poking his nose where it didn’t belong, hoping he’d find something new. And eventually, he found something alright. Something strange. He took me into the woods one summer day, wanting to show me.

“It was a door,” Grandpa said after a pause. “Just a door, made of old, dark wood, standing all by itself in a clearing. No house, no was. Just this door. It was in good nick, fresh paint job on there, and the bottom of the doorframe was nailed securely into the topsoil of the ground, so it stood perfectly upright, just like a normal door. Petey, he was always the brave one, he walked right up to it.”

Grandpa paused again, taking a longer sip. The house was silent except for the ticking of the clock. I realised I’d stopped breathing.

“What does that make Petey?” Grandpa asked.

“Stupid,” I answered, trying to force a jokey voice.

“He gets closer and closer to the doorframe, and I’m thinking it’s a bad idea. I’m thinking he’s putting himself in danger. But, I mean, why would I even have thought that? It’s just a door. But it felt all kinds of wrong. Petey’s almost able to reach out and touch the door when it opens up. A man stepped out. Or, well, I suppose he was always standing in that clearing in the woods, behind the door. You wouldn’t call it stepping out of the door so much as walking through it. No way to know which way’s in and which way’s out, right?

“He was dressed in normal enough clothes, but there was something wrong with his eyes. Petey told me later it was like looking into a well that had no bottom. He looked at us, and he had this expression of anguish on his face so profound it was almost alien. And then, his voice, it… it sounded exactly like the voice of someone I could remember, but I don’t know who. There was something about it that had been changed, something made poisonous. The whole clearing smelled like an electrical fire. “It’s worse inside,” he said. Petey fell back and grasped my arm and whispered to me like he just knew it, “He’s all bad.” And he was. We ran all the way home and never spoke of it again,” Grandpa finished. “I knew that day that the Lord works in strange ways, but I wonder sometimes, does the devil work in stranger.” He made the sign of the cross in an unfocused way as he gazed out the window. We both drained our glasses.

I tried to keep myself in check while Grandpa and I carried on having a generally fine chat for the next ten minutes or so. I could tell it was time to leave. Grandpa was more zoned out now than before. We said our goodbyes. I knew why it was. He was brooding. I’d heard about Petey in a good few of Grandpa’s old stories from back in his day. If I was remembering correctly, Petey Jackson had died less than a year after that story Grandpa just told me, when he was around twenty. 1976. The exact details of his death are the only part that Grandpa himself had never actually told me. He’d never needed to. I’d heard it all before, because Petey’s death is still a mystery. I couldn’t help but think about it as I drove home.

Petey vanished one day. After a day’s work at the autoshop, him and Grandpa parted ways as always, but Petey’s family never saw him come home. Only a few hours later, Petey was found naked and dead in a ditch by some teenagers who were out camping a whole state away. Petey didn’t even have a car of his own. Nobody had any idea how he could’ve gotten there on his own.

I only knew about this part from Grandpa Francis, but a few weeks after that, a bartender in our hometown opened up for the day and set about to work one morning as usual before he noticed, in the dusty, barren yard across the road, there was a small, slightly damaged and pitiful looking fridge standing by itself. He'd no idea who dumped it but wanted to get rid of it, since he thought it was an eyesore. He dropped it on his first attempt, and the door snapped open, spilling its contents. Stuffed inside that fridge had been some of Petey’s clothes, neatly folded and pristine. There were that clothes that didn’t belong to him at all in there too. A deck of magic the gathering cards, Petey’s baseball bat, and the shed skin of some kind of tarantula. Grandpa told me the bartender just left the fridge in the yard after that. Didn’t want to go anywhere near it. Grandpa called the police himself when he heard about the clothes and baseball bat, but nothing ever came of it. Petey’s death was never solved, and they never found out why his things turned up after the fact in that manner.

When I got home, the investigation began. I’m in the process of working through my sociology thesis for my sophomore year of college. I’m used to research. I started digging into local records, old newspaper archives. I wasn’t looking for shit about “the devil” or “strange doors in the woods”. I was looking for patterns. And believe me, I found them. It took many, many hours of digging, but eventually I stumbled upon them.

The first was an article from 2016 about a boy a few counties away from my area named Douglas Pickman, who, not long after his sixteenth birthday, was committed to a mental institution after being found wandering in that same state park. I’d heard bits and pieces of the story before, though I was shaky on the details, trying to pull at threads I could mostly remember from overheard conversations as a child.

Douglas had seemed disoriented and strange for weeks beforehand, according to his parents. They said he’d been refusing to eat anything that had colour. It was rice, bread, mashed potato and milk every breakfast, lunch and dinner. He’d sneak out constantly at night, but there were no signs that he was meeting girls, partying, doing drugs, anything. His grades remained fine, near-perfect, actually.

He'd sneak outside and just stand outside his first-floor bedroom window, staring out into the night. Why even bother going outside? By day, when he thought nobody was looking, they’d sometimes see him out on the road leading out from the house, stooping over, staring down into a particular storm drain. They’d heard once from a postman that he’d been whispering things down into the drain. One thing the postman could remember hearing was “I remember I was killing you but it’s all different inside”. Douglas’ friends at school said he’d kept trying to give away his things to them, saying he’d just be throwing them away otherwise. Things they knew he was proud of, like his signed band t-shirts and magic the gathering cards.

Once, his dad had heard him skulking about at night and went to investigate. He couldn’t find him in his bedroom or anywhere in the house for that matter. Staring out the window into the night – a terribly stormy one – lightning flashed for a few seconds. In the blue, white-hot light, illuminating momentarily the fields across from their house, he saw Douglas, a hundred feet away, running around carefree, going in and out from behind the many haybales scattered about. When the man got out to his son, he found him lying unconscious on the golden soil. He was wearing different clothes, somehow. Both his parents said they’d never bought or seen them before. They were old school, like 70’s high school style. There was a dead cat on the ground next to him.

One day he snuck out and never came back. There was a search, and a day later the police found him in those woods of the state park, having climbed up a tree and refusing to come down, claiming he’d “found where it sounds right.” He was violently thrashing a long, rusty nail at any of the officers who tried to pull him down. He was only collected after he’d started bashing his forehead against a thick, jutting stump in the tree branch and dented his skull, falling down onto the ground about ten feet below. He was apparently very lucky to survive and had done permanent damage to his skull.

I suddenly remembered something else as I read – something my mother had mentioned to me years ago when she told me about all of this. The memory was still foggy, but I remembered her telling me something Officer Dell had said to her once. He’s married to a friend of my mom’s, Caroline Dell, so they know each other well enough. According to him, as Douglas fell from the tree, and after he landed before passing out from shock and blunt force trauma, he kept screeching incoherently. “Screeches like a fax machine”, Dell had said. I’ve got no idea what that could mean but it didn’t sound good. And one thing, intelligible in the screeching, over and over. “Where’s the boy?”

Dell said he seemed to be staring right at him, and his eyes were like “every pair of eyes he’d ever looked into but different.” And as he stared down at the boy being cuffed, he was startled when the air suddenly reeked of something like an electrical fire. All the other officers denied that detail when he mentioned it afterwards. A few months later, Caroline miscarried their child. As the doctors broke that information to them, Dell said he remembered that exact smell again, seeping into every crack of the maternity ward. He's never smelled it again, apparently. They never did end up trying again for a child.

I’d no idea what to make of all this. It was all just strange things I could half-remember hearing about before, suddenly being spurred forward. But I felt sure it meant something, and it was plaguing me. I felt if I could get to the bottom of it all I might understand everything else that’d been happening to me, both as of late and throughout my life. The end of the article mentioned Douglas’ family’s – *my family’s –* long history of “nervous mental conditions”. I’d never heard anything about this before in my life.

I dug deeper. Census records, obituaries, police blotters. A great-uncle of mine I wasn’t aware of who’d vanished on a hunting trip in 1952. A daughter of a *great*\-grand-uncle who apparently died in a “domestic accident” after neighbours reported her screaming about a man in the attic. It’s all the same. An unnavigable breadcrumb trail of mental breakdowns and inexplicable tragedies, all leading seemingly to nothing, and yet it all felt connected somehow.

It's hard to explain how cagey I was at this time. It was getting more and more invasive to my daily life, too. Like, one time I was walking to my house from the college library where I’d been doing my research, when I saw that there was a dude walking up the street against me. Seemed like another college guy from the backpack and the direction he was headed, towards campus. Way off into the distance – this particular street is long and straight – he’s walking up towards me. As we kept approaching one another, he came more into vision and the guy’s face was now less hazy from the distance, He was starting to look exactly like a guy called Ritchie who’d been in my year back in high school. I hadn’t really been super close friends with him and I never saw much of him after starting college, since he hadn’t had any interest in it and went straight to working at his dad’s autoshop.

That made this kind of strange. Since Ritchie never went to college to my knowledge, why’d he seem to be going to campus with a backpack? But that was crazy talk. Ritchie – I was certain now it was him – could be going anywhere in this direction, with a backpack, for any reason, right? It’s none of my business. And yet I felt sure there was something to this, something that meant something.

And then it got stranger, in a way. As Ritchie and I came even closer to each other, crossing paths at last, I realised I had been wrong, this guy didn’t actually look anything like Ritchie as I remembered him at all. As we fully intersected and crossed paths, I was left wondering what I’d just experienced. Whether this man was or wasn’t Ritchie, what was it about him that’d led my mind to conjuring all that up? He hadn’t actually done anything. As I thought about it, I couldn’t even remember exactly what Ritchie actually did look like. And, come to think of it, where was Ritchie? Did he even work at an autoshop at all? The only one around for miles is the one in my hometown, near Grandpas’ house, that he and Petey worked at.

This type of strangeness of thought and paranoia had been pervading my life ever since the experience during the acid trip. Little things like this kept cropping up throughout my day to day life, making me momentarily question my sense of self, and as it piled up it all felt both more and more disjointed and ontologically incompatible, and more and more like it was all connected, I just couldn’t work out why or how. It was like there was something truly, utterly terrible hiding somewhere just out of frame in the metaphorical TV screen that I was viewing my memories through.

And maybe the more I’d began to remember, defences had been put in place and all these ominous, contradictory threads had been thrown at me. Maybe I was simply not supposed to remembered. I wondered if maybe my salvation was buried deep in my memories, too – what if all I had to do was keep trying to trigger more and more memories, because if I could just remember enough about something, I could get to the bottom of it all and expose whoever was behind it? But then, what would that something even be? And something else had been growing, a feeling that it was all going to be coming to a head soon somehow.

Anthony found me at the campus library. He looked scared. “Jack, you have to stop this shit, bro,” he said, lowering his voice. He sounded the least stoned I’d heard him in a while. “I looked a bit into your family. This whole thing doesn’t feel like, just, a joke, or a weird hallucination or whatever. Everyone like you who’s gone down this thing, they’re gone. They’ve either disappeared or they… they killed themselves. You’re chasing some kind of ghost story that’s still making more.”

I heard his words. I really did. But as he was speaking, the other voice of Anthony, the one from before, the internal one, was smoother, clearer. It didn’t even sound much like Anthony anymore, it was just a calm, neutral tone, but I knew it was the same voice.

*“He is a guardian,”* it said, the voice full of hate and causing flashes in my mind of teeth, of hair, of darkness, spiders, asphalt. *“He keeps the lambs from the pasture.”*

I didn’t tell Anthony what I heard this time. I thanked him for his concern and told him I thought I was getting over it all anyway. Inside my mind, however, the size of the rift that I’d instantaneously felt open up between us was like suddenly getting dropped into the Grand Canyon. I didn’t know what to think about anything anymore.

The signals were changing. They weren’t just commentary anymore. They’re, they’re *navigational*. Like, yesterday, I was stoned and watching a nature documentary. I hadn’t been to any of my classes or my job for a while. I was trying to put myself into a foggy headspace deliberately now, trying to elicit more and more of the static in my subconscious, hoping it might trigger memories that could reveal more clues to me. I’d been denying myself sleep, deliberately zoning out to music or the TV, getting high non-stop, I’d even been experimenting with binaural beats. As I was zoning out, high, reading some texts on my phone and absorbing the background noise of National Geographic, a generally quiet and easy cacophony had filled the room. Until the sounds from the documentary of flowing water, of rustling leaves, of chirping birds, all tightened, sharpened, and became that same hate-filled voice, like friction on a carpet.

*The map the third drawer the green circle*

I walked over to my desk, my body moving almost on its own. I pulled out the topographical map of the state park I’d picked up at their gift shop while I was driving home from Grandpa’s and all but forgotten about in the drawer. It was tucked into the third drawer. In the deep woodland, where Grandpa’s story had taken place, someone had drawn a small, precise circle in green ink. I don’t even own a green pen. I knew what was in that circle. I didn’t need to check the coordinates against my memories of the acid trip. I just knew. It was all coming together now, I felt. I was going to the woods.

That brings us to the reason for my post, folks. I’m not looking for answers anymore. I’m just leaving a record. A warning, maybe, for anyone else who hears the signal. Stop reading now, if you’re smart. Go back to your life. Consider the static nothing but.

I went back to the woods. The green circle on the map was a pull I could never resist. The journey wasn’t like the first time with Anthony. There was no laughter, no intoxication, no adventurous feelings. This was like a funeral march. I told no one I was going. The woods were silent in a way that felt intentional, like the birds and the insects were holding their breath. I didn’t need the map at all. My own blood seemed to know the way, pulling me forward like a diving rod tuned to a lucid nightmare. The air grew colder, felt denser. The familiar panicky stutter in my perception I’ve experienced throughout my life was no longer a glitch, here. It was the dominant signal. And then, amongst all the thin birch trees and cracked beams of sunlight dispersing through the canopy overhead, I saw the door.

It was exactly as Grandpa Francis had described. A simple, freestanding doorframe of dark, weathered wood; no walls or house to be seen. It was just there. It was both the most utterly mundane and the most wrong thing I’ve ever witnessed. The sight of it radiated waves of something bad, just pure bad. There was something inherent to the doorframe, something hidden beneath the atoms in the different materials and components that made up its structure, something lurking within that sent my nervous system into a state or revolt. Something about the doorframe and its presence here violated reality simply by existing.

As I stood there, maybe ten feet away, the final broadcast from the signal came through. It wasn’t even a voice this time, more like a knowing, a sudden injection of utter truth. A data packet that an unknown force had suddenly downloaded directly into my soul for me. I understood. The door changed me. It changes us. It breaks our filters. When I saw who I felt, impossibly, was Douglas, I think the voice in my head of Anthony was telling the truth. In a way, I think it was. I must have seen the devil. I saw him, who had walked through the doorway and been change. He was perceiving everything like how I felt I could suddenly perceive everything. The weight of time, the memories trapped in the soil, the silent anguish of every living thing for miles. That must’ve been why it called him the devil, I thought desperately. It was the only word big enough to hold the terror.

The signal, the static, everything, I think it’s what’s on the other side of that filter. It’s the raw data of existence. Beautiful. Entrancing. Labyrinthine. Terrible. Unbearable. Stepping through the door would be to understand everything. To become a clear channel. I would know why Douglas built his stone archways. I would know the name of the woman singing in my fan. I would know what the rocks remember. I would also cease to be Jack. I would be a vessel, overflowing, forever drowning in an ocean, a psychic avalanche of disjointed truths. I stood at the threshold for a long time. I felt the pull.

The part of me that has always been curious, that has always listened, wanted nothing more than to step forward and finally, finally know. I thought of Anthony’s face then, full of fear. I thought of dead spiders curling up in on themselves. I thought of rusty nails and electrical heat and gnashing teeth and I thought of darkness, and I thought of life. I felt nauseous beyond belief and fell for a second to my knees. I thought of my grandfather, who lived a long, pleasant and normal life apart from one very strange day in the woods, because he’d ran away from this very clearing in them. I thought of the simple pleasure of a family gathering. Of getting high and goofing off with a friend. Of playing sports. Of brewing coffee in the morning. Of having a beer and awkwardly making small talk or catching up with someone.

I made my choice. I turned my back on the door. I didn’t run, I walked. One foot in front of the other, away from the clearing, away from the silence, back towards the world of cardboard and whispers.

I am home now. The world is quiet. The signal is gone.

That’s the lie I have to tell myself to get through the day. The truth is, the signal isn’t gone, I don’t think. I think I’ve done something permanent to my ability to receive it, whatever it really is. I had to. To survive. It’s like I’ve taken a weed-whacker to my own mind with a psychological scorched-tar policy. I’ve severed the connection and I’ve scarred the landscape.

The world feels grey. Flat. The colours are muted. Music doesn’t really feel like music anymore, more like an arrangement of notes and beats in an order that’s sonically pleasing to the human brain for whatever evolutionary reason. A joke is just a sequence of information drip-fed to build towards a reveal and punchline. I still laugh, but more in an “oh, that’s clever” kind of way. The deep, intuitive part of me that sometimes just felt sure of certain things is now silent. It’s a numbness that I think I will carry for the rest of my life.

I saw Anthony yesterday. We had a beer. It was a slight bit awkward and stilted. He says I seem better. More grounded. I agreed and it was almost like old times between the two of us, but he doesn’t understand, will likely never understand, that I had to cripple a part of myself forever to achieve this peace.

I am safe. I am sane. I am empty.

The door is still there in the woods too, of course. And sometimes, in the dead of the night, when the silence is absolute, I can feel the ghost of the static’s hum. A phantom limb of the soul. And I am filled with the most profound anguish and regret, so profound it feels almost alien, not for what I found but for what I had to destroy in myself to get away from it.

Don’t look for the door. If you hear the static’s hum, learn to live with it. The only thing worse than hearing that signal is the silence you have to create to make it stop.",1,1762135523.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

1omzlqv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1omzlqv/bdo_internship/,Bdo internship,"Hey everyone,
I’m a second-year accounting student, and I could use some perspective on my situation.

I applied for a few internships (Audit, tax, forensics) positions at BDO back in late August for the January 2026 intake. So far, I’ve only heard back from one, Audit (rejected), but the others still show “Under Review.”

A few weeks ago, I had a coffee chat with a forensic partne, whom I met through the assurance partner at an networking event, she introduced me to the forensics partner. The meeting was supposed to be 45 minutes, but it ended up lasting an hour and a half. The conversation went really well, we talked about the work, law and accounting, and even some casual stuff like sports, hobbies and travelling. Toward the end, she asked me to send her my resume so she could take a look.

The same day, she booked another coffee chat with me. She followed up over email, connecting me with a senior manager on her team and mentioning that the manager would be a great person to speak with as well. I emailed the senior manager the same day and introduce myself, but haven’t heard back yet. (it has been more than a week now)

The second coffee chat is scheduled over Teams, and it’s booked for two hours.

Now I’m wondering:

Is it normal to still not hear back if I applied at the end of August for a January start?

Since it’s not recruiting season anymore, is there still a realistic chance I could get brought on late?

Would this be considered a referral? From a partner to a partner to a senior manager? Does it mean much? 

Is it a good sign that both chats have been so long (the first one went 90 minutes, and the next is set for two hours)?

If I get an offer super late (like end of December or early January), is it normal for students to drop courses to take it?

For context: the partner also mentioned that next time, she’ll be asking me more questions to get to know me better, so it kind of sounds like an informal interview. So what should I prepare like? 

Would love to hear thoughts or experiences from anyone who’s been through something similar.

We often perform the role of secondary characters in our own lives, doing little to impact or direct the overall plot. In some cases, we even play the part of the villain by self-sabotaging ourselves. If this sounds like you, then it’s time to recast yourself as the hero of your own life.

The hero’s journey always contains struggle. Without a struggle to overcome, you can’t even be a hero. Be glad that having something to struggle over gives you this opportunity instead of complaining about it.

There are heroic choices constantly being presented to you. Think of how a hero would act when faced by them.

Would a hero introduce himself to a cute girl sitting at a coffee shop, or choose to say nothing and have the opportunity forever slip away?

Would a hero hide his true beliefs and desires, or unapologetically let them be known?

Would a hero work to get better, or instantly give up at the first sign of defeat?

Be a catalyst for things occurring. Organize events. Be the one that asks others to join you in doing something. And if no one else wants to join an activity, be brave enough to still do it by yourself.

Don’t wait for someone or something else to save you. Do your own bit of saving.

This is the only lyric I remember, something along the lines of “then I killed myself.” It was in the verse, NOT the chorus. It was said very blasé and undramatically.

It was a pleasant sounding song, and the killing yourself line seemed to be said in a very undramatic way, like it was just listing off many things the singer had done that day. Kind of a sardonic matter of factness.

A Request From The CEO

“HR Department,” Juniper answered the phone professionally seeing the line from the CEO’s office displayed.

“Juniper Kennedy?”

“Yes.” Her eyes widened nervously at the brusque tone of the man on the other line.

“My office. Three minutes.”

The line went dead. She removed her headset and stared at it in disbelief.

“What’s wrong?” her supervisor, Maxine, head of HR, looked at her with concern as she staggered to her feet.

“I don’t know. That was the CEO, and he just called me to his office.”

“Phineas Perez? The CEO? Are you sure?”

“Yes. It was his office display number on my phone.” She pointed to the desk phone.

“I’ve never even been to his office. What did you do?”

“I don’t know!” she threw her hands up in disbelief.

“Doesn’t your mother work for his family?”

“She’s the live-in housekeeper for his parents.”

“Maybe something happened to her.”

“Jesus, Maxine,” she flung her things on her desk and grabbed her ID pass and hung it over her neck. She walked briskly to the elevator and stepped inside.

By the time she reached the top floor every fiber of her being was vibrating with panic. Maxine’s words reverberating in her mind.

“God, Mama don’t be hurt.” She was surprised to find Mr. Perez’s assistant not at her desk and his door was ajar but barely. She stood at the desk not sure what to do. She turned back towards the elevator hoping the AA came back soon.

“Are you going to stand out there all fucking morning or are you coming in?”

She looked up to see the man who could grace the cover of GQ wearing a potato sack and still sell out every single copy, glaring at her.

“You’re late. I gave you three minutes. It’s been six.”

“Is my mother okay?”

He pulled his head back, “how the fuck would I know?” He waved at her to enter the office.

She walked in and was surprised to see two other men standing there. One of them held a chair out for her.

Her body immediately reacted to all three men. They were the caliber of men chosen for television shows like The Bachelorette or those firemen or police drama shows her mother loved to watch. All three of them completely different and yet all three of them sexier than hell. Brown, blue, and hazel eyes all stared at her while she took a seat, and she breathed in the cologne of the man closest to her. She was blaming her reaction to them on hormones. She might be married but she wasn’t blind or immune to good looking men. One of them might even make it into a role-playing session with Kyst later. She packed the thought away.

“Juniper, this is my lawyer Benicio and my private investigator Adil.”

His words snapped her out of her daydream. Private investigator and lawyer? Did they think she’d done something wrong?

“Look, I don’t know what this is about.”

“Obviously so can you sit there and listen instead of interrupting?”

“Jesus, man, it’s not her fault,” Adil griped as he sat in the chair next to her. “In fact, if anything you owe her.”

“Owe me for what?” she looked back to the blue-eyed man behind the desk. His eyes were the color of arctic ice and equally cold.

He frowned and then narrowed his gaze on her, “oh shit. Your mother. I just remembered who you are. You’re the girl my father insisted we hire because your mother is their housekeeper.”

“I interviewed for the position after graduating college.”

“Sure. Yeah, this has nothing to do with your mother. It’s about your husband fucking my wife.”

She choked on the accumulation of spit which clogged her throat at the bold accusation. Adil patted her back while Benicio rolled his eyes and went to the mini fridge to get a bottle of water.

Phineas clearly didn’t give a damn she was choking, and he continued speaking over her wheezing.

“Six months ago, my wife came to visit me here in the office and didn’t get what she wanted. She left here in tears,” his expression told her he didn’t care in the least about his wife’s emotional state. “On her way out of here, your husband who dropped you off after lunch or something, saw her sobbing outside the building and asked her if she was okay. He took her across the street to the café, and she poured her miserable little heart out to him. That was when they met. They exchanged numbers.”

“He’s a nice guy.”

“Yeah, he’s so nice he’s doing me a favor by helping me get divorced.” Phineas snorted with disdain. “He’s so nice, for the last four weeks, every Wednesday when I need to leave Toronto to visit the offices in Ottawa, he works from home, and she goes to your apartment, and they fuck.”

“Allegedly,” Benicio spoke up. “Allegedly fuck. We can’t prove it because we can’t get inside. It’s a secure building and while we can get access into it, your apartment is locked up tight.”

“You think your wife is going into my apartment to have sex with my husband?”

“No. I don’t think it.”

She started to feel a sense of relief but then he continued.

“I know it. Here’s the thing. I’ve been married a year. I consummated our marriage, mostly because I was really fucking drunk and did what my grandfather wanted me to do. I married his army buddies granddaughter. I mean it was either I do it or lose my seat as CEO. I did it but we signed a prenup. I can’t divorce her without cause and the fact my dick finds her repulsive isn’t a good one apparently.”

“What?” she was abundantly confused, and it hurt her brain.

“My wife has a voice which makes me want to shove my dick in a woodchipper instead of her. She did this wailing grunting thing on our wedding night which still haunts me. She also called herself a pillow princess, which is codeword for dead fish. She laid there and screamed like I was the antichrist. She then curled up next to me afterwards and told me it was the best she ever had. I scrubbed myself raw for three days after.” He shook his head as if trying to dispel the memory. “I can only divorce her for one of three reasons. She steals from the company or the family. She doesn’t produce an heir in five years. Which is feasible because I’m never touching her again but fuck five years seems a long time. It’s only been one and I’m already contemplating a suicide murder situation. Five years with her and I’d rather spend the time in a maximum-security penitentiary for her murder but it’s a last resort.” He was holding up two fingers and then he added the third, “she fucks someone else. It actually defines intercourse in the prenup. She needs to be having an extra marital affair including intercourse. She can participate in all the emotional affairs she wants apparently because I’m not likely to be warm and fuzzy enough for her but unless dick meets vagina, she gets to continue receiving her monthly stipend. If I divorce her for any reason but those three, then she gets ten percent of the company shares, fifty million dollars and my villa in Spain. I really don’t want the bitch to get anything.”

She shook her head in confusion.

“Here’s the thing,” he sucked his lips over his teeth. “I need the proof. I mean we all know what’s going on in their little love shack, but I need proof. This is where you come in.”

“Where I come in?”

“Yes. See, I want you, when your husband is out of your apartment tonight for ten minutes, to let my buddy Adil here in, so he can put a camera in your living room, bedroom and at your front entrance. All he needs is ten minutes.”

“My surveillance tells me your husband cleans the apartment Tuesday night, doesn’t he? He takes out the trash around nine pm every Tuesday night.” Adil spoke up. “It’s new right? He’s only been doing this over the last several weeks, but he’s been deep cleaning on Tuesday night. He takes the trash out and he takes his phone with him. He sends her messages confirming they are on for the next day. He goes back up to you and plays devoted husband until nine-twenty-five Wednesday morning.”

“And doing laundry on Wednesday before you come home so he can get my wife’s cloying perfume off your bedsheets.”

Why

“Why are you doing this?” she asked suddenly, looking at Phineas.

“I’m not doing fuck all. Don’t you want to know whether or not your husband is double-dipping?”

“You’re not a nice person.”

The words sounded lame and weak as far as insults go but it was all she had as she sat here reeling.

“Tell you what,” he leaned back in his chair and steepled his fingers over his chest. “Here’s what we’ll do. Adil will sit outside your building tonight. You observe your husband’s behavior. If you even feel the slightest bit he’s messing with your devotion, send Adil a text and he’ll wait for Kyst to walk out with the bag of garbage. He’ll install the three cameras. Tomorrow, we’ll throw a viewing party right here. If I’m wrong and the reason she is there is to simply rearrange your furniture or he’s planning a surprise interior design for you, then no harm no foul.”

“There is harm and foul if I don’t trust my husband and I put cameras in my house!”

“Wouldn’t you rather be safe than sorry.”

“I’d rather not have this conversation at all!” she was starting to feel her patience waning.

“Here,” Adil held his phone out.

“What?” she looked at it like it had three heads.

“Photos of your husband and her at a coffee shop last Friday. This is her entering the building you live in on the Wednesday before. Maybe it is innocent. As you said, he’s a nice man and maybe he’s simply cheering up a sad woman, but wouldn’t you like to be certain?”

There was no mistaking it. The man in the photo sitting across from the blonde bombshell in the café was her husband Kyst. They weren’t touching. They were each holding their own cups of coffee. The photo seemed relaxed, and the lawyer that he was, if she’d stumbled across them in person, she would presume he was simply meeting a client.

Yet, it was also no denying it was the same woman in the other photo entering her apartment block.

“Well, what’s it going to be Juniper? You in? Are we catching dirty cheating liars together or will I need to find another way to catch them?”

She glared at him, but he continued anyway.

“Before you run out of here screaming and crying,” Phineas continued, “I don’t intend to destroy your marriage callously. I know you love this guy. If you want to stay with him after we bust them, I’m sure my parents could recommend a great marital counsellor. After all, my mother has stayed with him after three, four affairs over the last forty years. I’ll pay for it. Discretely of course. However, if you find you want to be as rid of the marriage as I do, for several reasons of course, yours being betrayal, lies and the risk of an STD since she’s allegedly allergic to latex,” he made a face, “another reason I wouldn’t touch her because I’m not impregnating her, then we’re you’re there for you.”

“Get on with it,” she waved at him angrily. She was starting to think this guy got off being shocking. It was almost as if he enjoyed making her squirm with his nastiness.

“If you want to divorce him, Benicio here will oversee your divorce free of charge, and he’ll make sure you get what you deserve. You’ll also be given a one-million-dollar payment for the emotional distress for the use of your apartment for our sting operation. You will also be provided a condo of similar value to the one you currently reside in, so you are not displaced and homeless.”

“The condo was my idea.” Adil leaned his head sideways towards her conspiratorially. “I would hate to sleep in a bed I knew my partner screwed someone else in. Do you know I actually own one of those black lights forensic teams use to find seminal fluid? I have it on a keychain. When I go to a girl’s place, if the sheets aren’t clean, I’m not getting in it. No way in hell would I want to live in a house where my partner was messing around, and I would know. You’ll definitely need a new place, but Beni will make sure you get your half due to you.”

She wasn’t even sure how much of Adil’s statement she wanted to unpack. “So, if we put the cameras in and nothing comes of it, then what? What if she’s a client and since he works from home, he’s giving her legal advice from our apartment?” she was grasping at straws and she knew it.

“Then nothing. We’ll collect the cameras, and you forget this happened.”

“But I’ll know I didn’t trust him. If he finds out I didn’t trust him,” her voice cracked with the fear. Was she really doubting her husband’s love for her? He loved her. She knew it in her bones. They’d been together since high school. They were each the only lover the other ever had. They weren’t perfect but what married couple were? A feeling of unease was filling her. Was she a blind fool?

“If he finds out, I’ll tell him I threatened your mother’s job. He’ll believe you.” Phineas shrugged, “but my gut, which made me a billion dollars last year in investments alone and never fails me, is telling me this is right.”

She sat there quietly contemplating the conversation of the last ten minutes.

“Why do you hate her so much?”

“What?”

“Why do you hate your wife?”

Benicio snickered and Adil leaned back in his own seat kicking his feet straight out.

Adil shot her a look, “I love this story!” he gritted through clenched teeth his eyes bright with excitement.

“Her grandfather and mine were army buddies. Her grandfather saved my grandfather’s life and almost died as a result. He lost half of his leg. My grandfather’s family were wealthy. Hers was not. My grandfather wanted to take care of his buddy, but her grandfather was a proud man, a good man and instead of cash asked for a job when they left the army. Her grandfather worked hard. Eventually he made enough money so he could start his own business. They remained the best of friends until he died. My father and her father are good friends, with their fathers taking them on camping trips and all the manly man things. When we were kids, I was introduced to Denise. My grandfather made jokes about us finally being able to join the family, but I wasn’t interested. She does nothing for me. Regardless, he’s my grandfather. Her grandfather took sick last year. Prostate cancer and he died almost right away. My grandfather said on his deathbed the old man asked him to take care of Denise. My grandfather and father’s version of agreement was to say I’d marry her.”

“Still don’t see why any of this is her fault,” Juniper wrinkled her nose, grateful she’d grown up dirt poor in a single-family household, so she’d never been married off like this.

“The minute the bitch knew what my grandfather was plotting she saw dollar signs. Because her grandfather was such a hardworking man, he believed his children needed to work for themselves. He left most of his money to charity. Her father is the same way. They don’t give to her needlessly. She needs to work. She’s an interior designer. Decent at her job. She found out though that she was going to be hitched to a billionaire, and she was really excited. I, fool that I was, didn’t think she was such a money-grubbing bitch at first and believed she was as good of a human being as her grandfather and father. I thought I could do my grandfather proud; despite the fact I wasn’t attracted to her at all. Family and all that. Then the day of the wedding rolls around and I see her true colors.”",1,1762134704.0,romancenovels,1,1.0,False

Worked at a local shop for a few weeks. Coffee, food, gas station, convenience store all in one. It’s a well known local place that’s gone downhill since new ownership. 

Well, in my time working there I brought it to management and owners attention that 90% of the Toranis syrups were 4 months to 2.5 years expired. All the lotus expired early to mid 2023. I pulled all the expired product before I let them know. I was then told to return the products back to the shelf because “it’s just sugar” and would “cost too much to replace all at once”. 

This has to be so wrong. Expirations are there for a reason, aren’t they? If they had been taken care of as they expired it wouldn’t be a big deal but here we are. 

I no longer work there. It was very short lived, I was offered a higher paying job. But this still rubs me very wrong. Is there a certain way to report this? Health department?

I’m not trying to negative but honest in my struggles. I just wish people were less dismissive of those voicing their situations. I’m mid 20sF and poc in a major southern metro this may not apply to all.

Volunteering- It’s generally a performative act and isolated event. Companies send their employees out for street cleanups or teams up with another corporate company for a day to package meals in a back room with your colleagues… I’ve volunteered for a business by myself many nights while the owner went home to her family. Other times I was alongside teens getting  hours for school. At the animal shelter, I love the pets, but people barely even come to see them. Is there some consistent volunteer group or organization that people actually participate in That I’m missing? Assuming we’re working adults here, who actually has hours during the day to commit to the orgs with the same hours?

What good are bars/clubs if you don’t drink, smoke, or enjoy loud & crowded settings? Or introverted? I’m willing to bet some people leave out disabilities or hardships in their posts seeking advice to eliminate complexity but I think it backfires (ex getting told to join run club & your physically disabled).

I Literally only see sham + kids and seniors at the library. Occasionally homeless people if I go to the ones in the city. Events they host are for the same and during working hours.

Does everyone actually live in a city/town where there’s a kickball/softball whatever sports league that hasn’t already completed season registration, doesn’t cost money, is welcoming and not cliquey? 

Meetup platform is unbearable these days. Begging you to pay, can’t see who’s joining the event or in the group. Let’s not ignore the fact that it’s largely used by seniors. I’ve been to plenty of events and half of those reserved don’t show. Some meets are cancelled beforehand. Maybe some Facebook and Instagram groups are better but I no longer use those apps.

In dating, sure some people get lucky irl and fewer online but overall it just sucks as a serious dater facing hookup culture and the paradox of choice/lack of commitment.

I’m in cafes weekly. Maybe 2-4x. Crickets, it’s just me or a girl who dragged her bf along, a senior adult here and there. Even the staff are awkward sometimes. Coffee is getting expensive. People are face first in their laptops/phones everywhere and let’s not forget about those AirPods.

What else am I missing here?

Why are people acting like the world is still some big social scene?Don’t get me wrong, I wish it was but I think a lot of the suggestions are inspired by romcoms or novels and days of the past. I think there’s a generational issue at play here including the phones and social media. 

Back to my point of the suggestors having never been lonely-  it takes time to build platonic or romantic relationships that last and you can still be lonely during or after that process. Not to mention personality/lifestyle/circumstances etc potentially getting in the way. I wont lie as someone who is romantically lonely, I’ve been to events and felt icky talking to people as if I’m seeking friends when I really am looking for a potential date. I’ve also been “out of my comfort zone” to bars with groups and lost connections because I “changed.”

 I guess I just haven’t met people who really want or need friends and i get that. There’s nothing wrong it. while some suggestions are fair I wish people would stop acting like they acquired all their best mates/partners through “volunteering, meetups, cafes, events, clubs.” As someone who currently has no friends, Is single, & not close with family, I’m often treading water with people who have other friends, are in relationships, and have familial support because I don’t compete and often made to feel desperate when I want to hangout. So many people were graced with decent families and meeting their partners/friends in childhood/college etc and never acknowledge the luck in that.",3,1762134451.0,lonely,2,1.0,False

It started like everything else does now. With a swipe. I hadn’t fuck for a long time so I decided it was time for some Tinderfun.

Her name was Luna. Just one photo. Blurry. Looked like it was taken with a flip phone or something. No bio. No shared interests. Just her name. And those eyes — way too sharp for the resolution. Like they were watching me through the screen.

I don’t know why I swiped right.  
I wasn’t even looking for anything serious. Just bored.  
But the moment we matched, something felt… off.  
She messaged first.  
“I see you.”
(Gino): Haha okay then.  
So… what are you in the mood for?  
Like, what are you looking for on here?

Luna: Connection.  
Something that lasts.  
Something that doesn’t go away when the sun comes up.

Gino: Deep answer 😅  
Most people just say “fun” or “vibes”

Luna: Fun fades.  
Vibes vanish.  
I want something permanent.

Gino: Permanent like… a relationship?

Luna: Or something stronger.  
Something you can’t delete.

Gino: You’re intense, Luna 😄  
But I kinda like it.

Luna: I knew you would.  
You’re ready.

Jij: Ready for what?

Luna: For me.

Jij: Sooo…  
Are we meeting tomorrow or what?

Luna: Yes.  
Tomorrow night.  
Your place.

Jij: Perfect.  
Already looking forward to it 😏  
Might skip dinner and dive straight into bed lol

Luna: That’s fine.  
The bed is where it begins.  
And where it ends.

We met two nights later. At my place.  
She didn’t want to go out. Said she preferred quiet spaces.  
She walked in like she’d been there before. Fingers brushing my shelves, eyes scanning my walls. She didn’t smile. Didn’t laugh. Just watched.

We drank wine. Talked a little.  
Her voice was soft, almost too soft.  
She didn’t blink much.  
But I was drawn to her. Like gravity.  
Against all logic, we ended up in bed.

Her skin was cold.  
Not like “I’m chilly” cold.  
Like… ice

The sex was colder than her skin.  
Not distant — just lifeless.  
It felt like he was moving against something hollow, something that didn’t respond.  
No breath. No sound. No emotion.

Her eyes stayed open the entire time, staring past him, as if watching something he couldn’t see.  
Her body was stiff, unmoving, like a doll.  
Not resisting. Not participating. Just… there.

It didn’t feel like connection.  
It felt like a transaction.  
Or worse — a ritual.

When he looked down at her, she smiled.  
Not with warmth.  
But with certainty.  
Like she had claimed 

I woke up the next morning and she was sitting up in bed.  Not sleeping. Not scrolling her phone.  Just staring at me.

“You chose me,” she said.  
Her voice was deeper now. Hollow.  
Like it came from somewhere far away.

I laughed nervously. Asked if she wanted breakfast.  She didn’t answer.  
Just stood up and walked into the living room.  Sat on the couch. Stared at the wall.i tried to act normal.  0Made coffee. Asked if she needed a ride.  

She turned her head slowly and said:  
“Why would I leave? You let me in.”
I called my friend Tom.  
Told him something weird was going on.  
He came over. I pointed to the couch.

“She’s right there,” I said.

He looked confused.  
“There’s no one there, man.”

I laughed. Thought he was joking.  
But he wasn’t.  
He couldn’t see her.

Nobody could

From that moment on, she was always there.

She sat at my kitchen table.  
Stood behind me in the mirror.  
Lay next to me in bed, eyes open, every night.

She whispered things.  
Not words — just sounds.  
Sometimes I’d wake up with her face inches from mine.  
Sometimes I’d hear her footsteps when I was alone.

I moved apartments.  She came with me.

I deleted Tinder.  She laughed.

Every time I brought someone home, they vanished by morning.  
No texts. No calls.  
Just gone.

And then I’d see a new photo on Luna’s profile.  
A blurry image.  
Of them.  
With her eyes in the background.

I tried filming her.  
Just static.

I tried recording her voice.  
Only noise.

I tried touching her.  
My hand went through.  
But sometimes… I swear I felt her heartbeat inside my chest.

I don’t know what she is.  
A ghost? A demon?  
Something digital that escaped?

But I know this:

She was my match. And now I’m hers.

And every night, just before sleep takes me, I hear her whisper:

Day started okay and we went out in public, got lunch and did a Trader Joe’s run. I wore baby so he was taking short catnaps throughout the 2-3 hours we were out (normally I try to follow the sleep feed play stuff and loosely adhere to expected wake windows, but obviously not when we aren’t at home). When we got home he was so tired but refused to take a good nap. He’d fall asleep in my arms and wake up 5-10mins after transferring to his crib or bassinet. Finally I gave up and did a contact nap but then it was nearing over 2 hours and past 6pm when I try to normally put him down at 8pm, so I woke him up bc I don’t want to completely fuck up the nighttime routine. Of course he’s fussy and it was close enough to a feed time (and he was cueing) that I fed him, but then I realize my nipple shields are missing (another thing to crash out over. Can’t BF like normal). My dog ate one last week which we thought was a fluke (it was in a napkin and dog loves to eat napkins). But I know I left two shield on the coffee table and they were both gone, so at some point during the nap the dog ate my shields!!!!! I’m sick of having to constantly remember where the shields are, if they’re clean, etc and I just want to BF like NORMAL.

Anyway I decided to wear baby again because he didn’t want to do any tummy time or anything other than be held or in his bouncer (which makes me feel like I’m rotting his brain because I’m not engaging with him). The dog won’t stop following me around but I’m so angry at him and he’s a dog so he doesn’t even know what he did. And then the baby fell asleep while I was wearing him so forget trying to keep him awake. I said fuck it and put him in his crib, guess we’re done for the day early and I’m sure he’s going to be ready for tomorrow at like 4am. Not counting the night feeds of course. 

I know one bad day won’t ruin everything but I have so much dread right now that his “schedule” is completely fucked. I’m covered in spit up, have one nipple shield left which means tonight is gonna suck bc they have to be cleaned after each use, the laundry isn’t folded, and baby just spat out his paci.

Every time me, my dad, or my brother leave them unsupervised for 15 minutes they tear things up. My dad leaves his bedroom door open so they can come in and out whenever they want, and they usually sleep in there or on their couch. 

They have toys everywhere. They favor the indestructible ones that they can chew on so we bought them a bunch of those and they like them. For some reason they don't like to play fetch, I'll throw the ball and they'll chase after it but won't pick it up or bring it back. So instead, to play with them I get one of their indestructible toys and wave it around them and put it up and down in the air. If they bite the toy, they get it.

Even with the toys being accessible to them at all times, they still get bored sometimes and tear things up. We got one of the trashcans where you step on it to open it, but somehow they figured out how to open that. I went downstairs today and saw all of the dirt and dust from when I vacuumed in the morning sitting in a pile on the floor in front of the trash can, along with scraps of paper they got into and chewed up. 

They get into coffee pods, bags, cups, remotes, food, sauces, even pumpkin stems from when I carved pumpkins with my brother. 

They always have food and water with them. I refill both of those every time I see that they're empty, and every few days I'll give them a treat if they do a trick. They go outside a lot, too.

Almost every day when I come home from school, I come home to a mess because they managed to tear things up again, even if we put as many things away as possible. My brother leaves for work right after he picks me up, so as soon as I come home I have to do chores.

I have nothing against the youtuber int he video, I like her videos and her drawings. I have nothing against the commenters.

Aside from the final comment, I believe his description of her was fine. To be clear, I’m a Black woman—African American—and I don’t find his comparisons to objects disturbing. People often use comparisons like “coffee,” “caramel,” or “milk chocolate” because they’re trying to create a visual image, not to dehumanize women.

Growing up in the Black community, it was common to hear, *“Her skin’s like dark chocolate,”* or *“*Her skin color is like *caramel.”* These phrases aren’t insults—they’re ways of expressing beauty. Describing a person’s complexion as resembling coffee with two drops of milk isn’t offensive to me. It’s simply a vivid way of helping readers picture the tone.

Writers often struggle to describe colors accurately, so they rely on familiar comparisons. Saying someone’s eyes are like emeralds or their skin resembles porcelain is not inherently racist or sexist—it’s artistic shorthand. What matters is intent, and in most cases, the intent is to convey admiration, not objectification.

Unfortunately, some people twist these descriptions into negativity to appear socially conscious or gain approval. In places like Houston and throughout much of African American culture, using food metaphors for skin tone is normal. For instance, calling someone’s complexion “chocolate” is a compliment—it evokes warmth and richness, not insult.

Now, if someone said *“Her skin is like a Hershey bar,”* that would sound humorous or awkward, but still not offensive because the intent is clear. We understand what the speaker means, and chocolate is universally loved. The problem arises when people project bad intentions onto harmless expressions.

Also, pleasse don't call me a ""PICK ME!!!"" I’m not trying to gain male approval; I’m simply expressing my viewpoint. A woman can disagree without seeking validation from men. The constant labeling of women as “pick-me” for stating personal opinions is tiring.

When authors describe characters’ appearances, they’re not necessarily saying one character is superior to another—they’re just providing detail. Some descriptions are clumsy or awkward, yes, but not all are malicious. For instance, calling someone’s skin tone “coffee-colored” is fine; however, comparing freckles to “bad skin” could unintentionally insult real people, so sensitivity matters.

Context also matters. “Movie-star beautiful” or “Barbie pretty” are subjective compliments. “Flawless cream-colored skin” can be risky because readers may interpret it as favoring certain tones. Writers must be cautious since readers often assume the narrator’s words reflect the author’s beliefs, even when they’re just describing a fictional character’s perspective.

That’s why disclaimers can help clarify that character opinions don’t equal author opinions. In first-person writing, readers often confuse the narrator’s thoughts with the author’s own, which can cause unnecessary backlash. Third-person narration provides more distance and helps readers separate the writer from the character.

[Ultimately](https://voca.ro/1ne9XZof5dnj), people are sensitive and interpret things differently. A man describing a woman’s skin as “dark chocolate” isn’t automatically racist. In many Black American circles, that’s a flattering remark. But in other cultures, it might sound strange or offensive. Compatibility in relationships—even romantic ones—depends on mutual understanding of intent and culture.

If someone dislikes being compared to chocolate, that’s valid. But that doesn’t mean the speaker is racist—it just means their compliment didn’t land well. Everyone has cultural differences in how they express beauty. In the U.S., for example, describing skin as “dark chocolate” or “mocha” is affectionate, not derogatory.

At the end of the day, you can’t please everyone. Some people find color references racist; others see them as appreciation. Neither side is evil. People simply interpret words through different experiences. What’s important is intent, empathy, and understanding that not every descriptive phrase carries prejudice.

So, when I hear someone compare skin to coffee, caramel, or chocolate, I don’t take offense. I recognize it for what it is—a visual description, not a dehumanizing remark. Sometimes people aren’t bad or sexist; they just describe what they see. We all make mistakes, and we all get offended at times. The key is learning to distinguish genuine harm from cultural difference.",4,1762133266.0,rant,1,0.84,False

After the emotional storm of the video tapes and Sara’s visit, the four girls, feeling restless and confined, decided the only way to release some tension was to find the least rule-breaking way to move. They changed into their swimsuits and made their way down to the Wayne Manor’s expansive indoor pool.

​Ellie, in a frilly purple bikini, had shed the weight of her guilt for a moment, her new conviction shining through. Mia, wearing a vibrant emerald green bikini that matched her hair, looked ready for a fight even when lounging. Tara, always drawn to sharp colors, was in a dazzling fluorescent orange bikini. Rachel, the only one hesitant to fully participate, had chosen a modest blue one-piece and sat on the edge, her feet dangling in the cool, chlorinated water.

​Ellie and Mia, sensing Rachel’s reluctance, exchanged a look. Tara joined them, and the three conspired silently before launching a coordinated attack, splashing Rachel mercilessly. The water warfare lasted only seconds before Rachel sighed, her eyes glowing faintly red as she used her magic to lift Ellie, Mia, and Tara out of the water simultaneously and drop them back in with three cartoonish splashes. Laughter, genuine and unrestrained, echoed off the tiled walls.

​After their swim, the girls dried off and moved into the colossal glass-enclosed garden adjacent to the pool wing. This was technically pushing the boundaries of being ""confined to the Manor,"" but it was visible through the endless panes of glass. They set up targets among the exotic flora and began taking turns shooting Mia’s plastic toy arrows, practicing their aim while simply enjoying the movement.

​They were deep in a discussion about which Pokémon type would best counter a Zynothium Kaiju when the heavy wooden doors of the pool wing hissed open.
​The air instantly chilled, standing silhouetted against the manor’s interior lights were Dick and Kori. Dick’s expression was serious, professional, and unyielding; Kori’s was a mixture of discipline and underlying concern. The contrast between the heroes in full street clothes and the four girls in bright, wet swimsuits, surrounded by plastic arrows, was stark. The fun stopped instantly.

​Dick’s eyes swept over them, landing briefly on the toy arrows, then settling on Ellie.
​“You know you’re not supposed to be in the garden, Helena,” Dick said, using her formal name.

​Ellie, Mia, and Tara dropped their bows and stood straight.
​“It’s still inside the structure, Dick. But point taken,” Ellie replied, her own voice taking on the level of seriousness expected of the CEO of Wayne Enterprises.

​Kori stepped forward, her voice gentle but firm. “We appreciated the tapes, Ellie. They were needed. But now, we need to have the conversation about Lex Luthor, the Zynothium, and the consequences of putting your team and yourselves in mortal peril. Change your clothes. We’ll meet in the library in ten minutes.”

​The girls nodded, the reality of their situation crashing back down on them. Their brief moment of freedom was over. Ten minutes later, the four girls, now back in their comfortable but slightly rumpled pajamas, filed into the Manor’s smaller, cozier living room. Dick and Kori had chosen this room over the vast library to make the meeting feel less like an interrogation, though the tension was thick enough to cut. Dick was seated, arms resting on his knees, while Kori stood near the fireplace, radiating quiet authority.

​Ellie settled onto the nearest couch, her shoulders squared, prepared for the inevitable. Mia, Tara, and Rachel sat close, forming a tight, defiant cluster.

​Dick began, his voice low and serious. “You understand why we’re having this conversation, and why you’ve been grounded. I saw the video. I know the risk you took. I appreciate the memories you shared, but that doesn't excuse what happened last night.”

​He gestured to the open laptop on the coffee table, where a single security still of the armored Lamborghini hurtling toward LexCorp’s gate was visible.

​“Helena, you designed this entry. You drove that car. You turned a standard infiltration into an act of war against Lex Luthor on the busiest street in Metropolis. You had no exit strategy for a hostile response, and you had no intel on the security forces or the Zynothium fusion project inside. Walk us through the plan, and tell us where the risk assessment failed.”

​Ellie didn’t hesitate. She looked directly at Dick.
​“The plan was to create a diversion so massive that it would draw out Luthor’s security, giving us a clear path to the vault. We expected guards and robots. We did not expect Slade Wilson and his family to be waiting for us, and we didn’t calculate the density of the initial gate armor.”
​
She took a deep breath, her eyes flicking to Mia.
​“The failure was mine. I was overconfident. I assumed that because we had the element of surprise and a powerful breach.”
​Kori stepped forward, her expression focused on the consequences. “And the result of that failed calculation, Ellie? The result was a mission that went from zero to life-threatening in seconds, ending with a Kaiju attack and Mia losing her hand.”

​Mia gently rested her new bio-synthetic right hand on Ellie’s knee, she hadn't stopped flexing her fingers since they left Medbay.
​“It was reckless, Kori, but we all agreed,” Mia stated, refusing to let Ellie carry the full weight. “Ellie drove the car, but I was the one who wanted to go for the smash-and-grab. We were all hyped up and thought we could handle it. Slade hit me with the intent to injure, not kill. We know that. I was focused on the fight, not my defense. My hand is back. We’re okay.”

​“You are not ‘okay,’ Mia,” Dick countered sharply. “You were forced to undergo immediate bio-regeneration therapy. That is a permanent scar and that hand, while medically sound, is proof of the cost of that failure.”

​Rachel, quiet until now, spoke up, her voice steady. “The failure was in our arrogance. We compared ourselves to the Team RWBY characters from that show, assuming we could handle the impossible because they do. We forgot that they train just as hard as they fight. We let the style override the substance.”

​Tara nodded quickly. “We’ve been given everything, money, gear, training and we treated a major infiltration mission like a joyride. We underestimated our enemies and overestimated our reaction time. The grounding is justified.”

​Dick leaned back, running a hand through his hair. Their acceptance of responsibility was exactly what he needed to hear. The anger in the room began to dissipate, replaced by a somber understanding.

​“Alright,” Dick said finally. “The punishment stands. You’ll be confined to the Manor, Alfred’s security is non-negotiable. You only leave for verified, critical criminal activity. No jaywalking, no petty theft, no 'corporate crime loopholes' just to test the limits. Understood?”

​Four heads nodded in unison.
​Kori added, softening the blow slightly. “We all love you, this is about learning to value the lives under your care. Now, go to bed. The debriefing on Slade and the others starts tomorrow morning, and you’ll be present via the Manor’s video link.”

​As the girls slowly rose to leave, the silence stretched. Dick stopped them one last time.
​“One last thing, Ellie. Your father compiled those tapes because he wanted you to remember that even in the chaos, you are loved. Do not lose that lesson because of this mess. Now, goodnight.”

The next day Sara sat down on the hard, metal chair in the sterile visitors’ room at Arkham Asylum. The separation was a thick, reinforced glass pane, and the only method of communication was the cold, plastic telephone receiver she now lifted.

​On the other side, Selina was seated. She was wearing standard Arkham scrubs, but nothing could dull the sharp, predatory intelligence in her emerald eyes. She wore a smirk that was equal parts defiance and boredom.

​Selina picked up her receiver first. ""Well, well. The White Canary. I expected a visit from the Golden Boy, or maybe a stern lecture from the Alien. Didn't expect Bruce's hired help to stop by.""

​Sara’s face, usually so guarded, was etched with fatigue and a simmering rage. She didn't rise to the bait.
​“I’m not here about the Zynothium, or the break-in, or Slade. I’m here about Ellie,” Sara stated, her voice tight and low through the receiver.

​Selina’s smirk faltered only slightly. ""My daughter. My blood. Tell me, how's the hand? I hear the little archer is good at losing limbs.""

​“She’s fine. Thanks to the Waverider's technology.” Sara leaned forward, her eyes never leaving Selina's. ""I saw the videos, Selina. Bruce left them for Ellie. They showed me teaching her to drive, going to her baseball games, holding her after a nightmare. They showed her calling me 'Mama Bear.'""

​Selina scoffed, leaning back and crossing her arms. ""Oh, the home movies. Cute. You think a decade of playing nursemaid makes you a parent? You were a paycheck, Sara. A babysitter who got lucky and stepped into a void that Bruce and my life created. You didn't earn the title; you stole my time with her.""

​“I filled a hole you refused to close,” Sara countered, her voice now rising. “You chose the roofs. You chose the masks. You chose the game. I chose the braces, the school meetings, the sick days. I chose the mundane, hard, unglamorous part of motherhood. And you know what? That’s what Ellie needed. That’s what Bruce wanted her to have.”

​Selina's composure finally broke. Her eyes flashed with pain and anger. ""You don't know what I wanted! Bruce isolated her because of me! He hid her because of the things I did, and you just waltzed in and acted like you were some domestic godsend! You took my memories with her! The Crisis wiped them out, and you took my chance to get them back!""

​“And what would you have done, Selina? You’re here, aren’t you? You're locked up in a place that’s supposed to hold the insanity of Gotham. You couldn’t stop being Catwoman for her, not permanently. I did, I was the constant, I was the one she could count on to be there when the sun came up.”

​Sara softened her voice, delivering the final, devastating blow. ""Bruce didn't leave her any letters from you. He left her twelve years of proof that I was her mother. That was his final answer. He chose the stability I gave her over the drama you brought.""
​Sara stood up, placing the receiver gently back into its cradle, cutting off Selina’s enraged protest mid-scream. 

Sara looked through the glass one last time, her eyes resolute.
​""I love her, and I'll keep her safe. From Lex, from Slade, and from you.""

​Sara turned and walked out, leaving Selina alone, banging her fist against the thick glass partition in frustrated, heartbroken fury.

Later that afternoon, the four girls were back in the comfortable sanctuary of Ellie’s room, scattered across the bed, surrounded by their collection of Pokémon plushies. The plushies, a colorful array of Eeveelutions, starters, other Pokémon, provided a comforting counterpoint to the stress of the day.

​“Hey, El?” Mia asked, poking a fluffy Snorlax.

​“Yeah?” Ellie replied, scrolling through a finance report on her phone, trying to make her grounding productive.

​“Our birthdays are in a few weeks,” Mia noted, a little hopeful in her voice.

​“And you two have nothing planned, I assume, due to the imminent threat of being murdered by your loving guardians,” Tara deadpanned, arranging a small Flareon and Vaporeon into a battle formation.

​“Well, I think this grounding might overlap with it, unfortunately,” Rachel said, looking up from a worn copy of Dante’s Inferno.

​“I already have an idea for a present,” Ellie announced, setting her phone down with a decisive click.

​“It’s not more cars, is it?” Rachel asked flatly.

​Ellie shook her head, smiling. “No, our two babies are enough for now.”

​“What is the present?” Mia pressed, bouncing on the bed.

​Ellie’s smile faded slightly into a focused frown. “We’re going to have to go get it. There’s no delivery option from this jeweler, damn it.”

​Tara’s eyes widened with immediate excitement. “So, a jailbreak?”

​“Hopefully not,” said Ellie. “A controlled outing under supervision. Come on. Put on your respectful faces.”

​Ellie led the others out of the room and down to the study, where Alfred enjoyed a quiet afternoon moment.
​Alfred looked up from his reading as the four girls approached, their movements suddenly very synchronized and polite. “Do you ladies require something?” he asked, one eyebrow slightly raised.

​Ellie stepped forward, adopting a measured, serious tone. The one she usually reserved for board meetings. “Your help, Alfred. Mine and Mia’s birthdays are in a few weeks, and we are worried that this grounding will overlap with it. I just ordered a very important piece of jewelry as a present for us, but the jeweler doesn't deliver high-value items, citing security concerns.”
​She paused, making direct, sincere eye contact. “So, we were wondering if we could go get the jewelry with you? Yes, it would be breaking the explicit rules of the grounding, however, you would still be with us to make sure we are coming back straight here. No detours, no vigilante activity, just a short trip for a necessary purchase.”

​Alfred studied the sincerity in Ellie’s eyes and the eager, pleading looks on the faces of the other three. He knew the difference between youthful recklessness and an act of love. The emotional toll of the past 24 hours weighed heavily on him, too. He stood up, his silence stretching for a few tense seconds.

​He walked to the door of the Batcave and placed his hand on the newly installed scanner lock. The door hissed open.

​“Very well, Miss Ellie.” Alfred sighed, a small, knowing smile touching his lips. “But if there is even the hint of a bank robbery or a masked street brawl, we are returning immediately. And you will be confined to the panic room for the rest of the month.”

​They sped through Gotham’s streets, a ridiculous convoy of high-performance vehicles for such a sentimental errand: Ellie and Alfred in the powerful Supra, followed closely by Mia, Rachel, and Tara in the low-slung Porsche.

​They arrived at the discreet, upscale jewelry store, were quickly ushered inside, and within minutes, they were handed four small, velvet boxes.
​After they walked back to the cars, Ellie opened the boxes and handed Mia, Rachel, and Tara theirs. Each box contained a breathtaking silver necklace. The pendant was a single, perfect heart, crafted from silver but uniquely segmented. It held four heart-shaped gemstones perfectly joined together: a rich purple Amethyst, a vibrant green Emerald, a deep blue Sapphire, and a fiery golden Amber. The Amethyst and Emerald formed the top half, with the Sapphire and Amber forming the bottom half.

​“So, what are the stones?” Tara asked, mesmerized by the glowing Amber.

​Ellie smiled, watching her friends. “They’re us, silly. Amethyst for me, because I’m wearing purple and it’s the stone of creativity and clarity. Mia’s the Emerald, for the Green Arrow’s legacy and her fierce heart. Rachel’s the Sapphire, calm and wise and rare and you’re the Amber, Tara, because you’re pure warmth and light. This way, we all still have the others with us, even when we’re alone.”

​Rachel gently touched the pendant resting on her palm. “You used your birthday present money to include myself and Tara? It was supposed to be just for you and Mia.”

​Ellie shrugged, the gesture saying everything. “Why not? We’re a team. We’re family.”

​“It’s beautiful, El,” Mia said, her voice husky, already fastening the silver chain around her neck.

​Alfred, standing patiently behind the Porsche, was caught smiling at Ellie’s explanation of the necklaces. It was a brief, necessary moment of normalcy in their superhero lives.
​The five returned to the Manor, the brief jailbreak a success. But the anonymity of a trip in Gotham was impossible for the famed Wayne cars. 

It didn’t take long for pictures and video of the group, Ellie, Mia, Rachel, and Tara with Alfred, outside the jewelry store to make it onto the internet, capturing the world’s attention once again.

The communication hub on the Waverider was still buzzing with activity, even a couple days after the Zynothium Crisis. Dick and Kori were still using the link to coordinate with the rest of the League's investigative teams. Sara, Ava, Barry, Clark, and Kara were gathered near the main console, going over forensic data.
​
Suddenly, Felicity Smoak’s voice crackled over the comms from Star City. ""Uh, guys? You might want to see this. The girls were supposed to be grounded, right? Like, fully locked down?""

​“They are confined to the Manor, Felicity. Alfred is supervising,” Dick replied, rubbing his temples, clearly bracing for bad news.

​""Well, Gotham just exploded with paparazzi photos. They took the Supra and the Porsche out to a high-end jeweler, and Alfred was driving the getaway car."" Felicity said.

​Sara immediately slammed her hand on the console, a sound of pure betrayal echoing in the room. ""Alfred let them go? After everything? I swear, if he thinks this is some 'necessary life experience' lecture...""

​Gideon immediately pulled up the images on the main screen: a dazzling high-resolution photo showing the Supra and Porsche parked outside a jewelry boutique. In a close-up, the four girls were visible, followed closely by a stoic Alfred.

​“They are supposed to be learning responsibility, not flaunting their wealth after nearly getting someone killed!” Laurel fumed, slamming a fist onto a nearby table.

​Dick’s disappointment was palpable. “I’m heading back. We need to have a serious conversation with Alfred about the definition of ‘grounded.’”

​Clark and Barry shared a look of dismay. Kara shook her head. ""They looked so earnest when they took responsibility.""

​As Dick turned to leave, Gideon’s smooth voice interrupted. ""Captain Lance, I have isolated a short video clip taken by an enterprising citizen who was filming the custom vehicles. It contains audio from outside the store, playing now.""

​The audio filled the room, cutting through the heroic outrage. It was Ellie’s clear, soft voice, followed by Tara’s question.
​Tara’s voice: “So, what are the stones?”

​Ellie’s voice: “They’re us, silly. Amethyst for me, because I’m wearing purple and it’s the stone of creativity and clarity. Mia’s the Emerald, for the Green Arrow’s legacy and her fierce heart. Rachel’s the Sapphire, calm and wise and rare and you're the Amber, Tara, because you’re pure warmth and light. This way, we all still have the others with us, even when we’re alone.”

​The image froze on Ellie's face, a look of pure, selfless devotion.
​Silence fell over the bridge, heavier and more complete than before. Dick, who had been halfway to the exit, froze mid-step. Sara’s hand, which had been resting on the console, trembled slightly.

​Sara was the first to speak, her voice barely a whisper. “It wasn’t a joyride. It was a mission… a mission for their hearts.”

​Kori walked over and gently placed a hand on Dick’s shoulder. “They did not defy you, Beloved. They simply executed a plan for unavoidable emotional necessity. They went to ensure the physical representation of their family bond.”

​Felicity, still on the comms, was choked up. ""She used her birthday money to make sure no one felt left out. Oh my god, Alfie you old softie. He knew. He knew it wasn't about the jewelry; it was about the family.""

​Clark stepped forward, his expression full of understanding.
“They are young women who just discovered how deep their roots go, and they nearly lost everything. They needed a visible reminder of that bond after the emotional trauma of the attack. Alfred understood that the need for family cohesion outweighed the need for confinement.”

​Dick slowly turned back, dropping his head. The anger had completely drained away, replaced by a profound, familiar guilt. “Bruce would have done the exact same thing.”

​Sara sighed, her eyes now wet. “The grounding still stands. But Dick, Kori… tell Alfred he made the right call. And check their necks when you get there. Make sure they’re wearing those beautiful, ridiculous necklaces.”

Later that evening, tucked away in her room, Ellie was wearing her new necklace. She picked up her phone, navigated through the encrypted contact list, and dialed Sara's number. The phone connected almost instantly.

​""Hey, Cubbie. I was expecting this call,"" Sara's voice came through, tired but warm.

​""Hi Mom,"" Ellie said, using the title deliberately and without hesitation. ""I'm calling because I know you saw the news stories. And I know Dick was probably ready to march back here and lock us in the panic room.""

​Sara let out a long, audible sigh. ""We saw the pictures, El. And we saw the video of you explaining the stones. You're still grounded, but I'm going to talk to Dick. He understands that it wasn't a joyride; it was a necessary gesture.""

​Ellie relaxed slightly. ""We got them because our birthdays are in a few weeks, and we're probably still going to be stuck here. I wanted us to have something special that reminded us we're all together, even if we're technically confined.""

​""I understand, sweetheart,"" Sara said, her voice softening completely. ""It was selfless, and it was beautiful. And don't you worry about your birthday. If you're stuck in the Manor, I will be there that weekend with a giant, tacky cake, and we'll celebrate right in Alfred's kitchen. Deal?""

​Ellie smiled wide, feeling the warmth of that commitment. ""Deal! I love you, Mom.""

​""I love you too, Cubbie."" Sara smiled.

​A momentary silence passed, and Ellie’s tone shifted, becoming more cautious. ""So, did anything interesting happen after you left the Waverider?""

​Sara paused, choosing her words carefully. ""I went to Arkham, El. I talked to Selina.""

​Ellie’s voice hardened instantly, all traces of youthful softness gone. ""So what did the bitch have to say?""

​Sara had anticipated this reaction, but the intensity still made her heart ache. ""Basically, she’s jealous of me. She’s jealous of me being your mom and not her. She feels like I stole you.""

​Ellie gripped her phone, her knuckles white. ""Good! The dumb bitch had the chance, but nope, chose her thrill ride over me. She left that door wide open and you walked in, and you showed me what an actual mother is. And I'm happy that you did.""
​Ellie's voice cracked with fierce emotion. ""I'm happy you're my mom, Sara! As the videos and the memories showed, you took care of me. You were there every day to make sure I was okay, not Selina! All she did was send a birthday or Christmas card every once in a while, thinking that was enough! You are my mom and always will be, Mom. I love you, I love you, I love you!""

​Sara listened, tears welling up in her eyes across the comm link. It was the absolute validation of every decision she had made over the last decade.

​""I love you too, El. So much,"" Sara finally managed, her voice thick. ""Now, go hug the girls for me. And don't make Alfred take you to the jewelry store again.""

​Ellie chuckled, the tension finally easing. ""Promise."" She hung up the phone, her heart swelling with the fierce, protective love for the woman who raised her.

The fluorescent lights of Arkham’s secured wing hummed as Amanda Waller, clad in her severe black suit, strode through the halls. She stopped first at the cell of Floyd Lawton, then moved methodically past the enclosures holding Poison Ivy, Bane, and a surprisingly quiet Harley Quinn. She was bypassing protocol and bypassing the League. 

Lex Luthor's creation of a city-leveling Kaiju had been the final straw; Waller wasn't waiting for the Justice League to finish their bureaucratic review.
​The selected inmates were transferred swiftly to a subterranean government facility, where Captain Boomerang, Captain Cold, and Cupid were waiting in a holding cell. The air was thick with the scent of fear and ozone.

​Waller stood before the newly assembled group, a projection of the Zynothium Kaiju flashing on the screen behind her. “Lex Luthor is attempting to weaponize a stable, dimension-shifting energy source. He is a threat to global security, and the League is taking too long to organize.”

​She didn't waste time on motivation; she went straight to the hardware. A team of technicians swiftly implanted the necessary high-grade explosives in the necks of all seven criminals.
​“You are now part of Task Force X. Complete the mission and live. Fail, or deviate, and I detonate the charges. Your task is simple: take down Luthor’s suborbital launch facility and retrieve the Zynothium device.”
​
​Back at Wayne Manor, a moment of peaceful normalcy had settled. The four girls and Alfred were in the kitchen, eating dinner. The atmosphere was light, filled with a sense of quiet solidarity now that the emotional air was clear.

​Ellie's hand was resting on the gemstones heart pendant when her customized phone began to vibrate violently. It wasn't a standard text or call; it was a highly encrypted Bat-Family security alert—the kind Bruce developed for mass-casualty events. Ellie picked it up, her cheerful expression dissolving into a mask of cold fury as she viewed the raw security footage streaming from the Arkham servers.

​“SHIT!!!” Ellie yelled, throwing her napkin onto the table and jumping up.

​“What is it, El?” Mia asked, instantly on alert, her hand already moving toward her shoulder where her quiver would usually rest.

​Ellie swung the phone around, displaying the chilling clips: Waller, the open Arkham cells, and the villain transfer. “Amanda Waller’s getting her little Suicide Squad together.”

​“She’s probably sending them after Luthor,” Rachel stated, her gaze dark. “She’s bypassing the League to stop the Zynothium.”

​“Exactly!” Ellie gripped the edge of the table, her mind already racing through tactical options. “She is sending a bomb-collared crew of psychopaths after a dimensional energy source. They will not only fail, but they’ll make the situation a thousand times worse.” She looked desperately at Alfred. “Grandpa!”

​Alfred, who hadn't moved a muscle but had already deduced the situation from Ellie's single word, put down his fork. He looked at the four determined faces, four girls who had just committed to a life of emotional responsibility and saw four heroes who couldn’t stand by while the government made a catastrophic mistake.

​Without another word or a change in expression, Alfred simply inclined his head toward the door to the Batcave. “Get going.”

​The change was instantaneous. The girls suited up in a blur, rushing down to the newly secured Batcave. Ellie, navigated the complex bio-locks Alfred had installed and fired up the Batmobile. In less than three minutes, Team Emerald was speeding toward the known government facility.",1,1762133066.0,Arrowverse,0,1.0,False

How should I begin this ? Well, I'm a 31 year old man, looking for a committed long term relationship. The apps are terribly unkind (I've had a few matches, however) and people aren't willing to give each other a chance at all I feel. It's a bit of a catch-22 really, to build a connection with someone requires a little bit of patience and understanding, it's a two way street... So I figure I might as well try reddit, can't hurt right ?! I would like someone to show affection and a little bit of tenderness towards.

A little bit about me in dot point form:

* University educated, I have a double degree, engineering + science, now work in IT full time doing operations/infra work. 
* 173cm (5ft8in), black hair, brown eyes, I would call myself (somewhat?) conventionally attractive. I will let you decide that of course ! 
* Trying to get fitter, I go to the gym 4-5x a week, not overweight, but a little husky I guess? I have a powerlifting coach helping me to achieve a 2-plate bench within the next year. 
* I try to get enough sunshine, exercise, sleep, water, eat lots of fruit & veg. I hope you do too !
* Friendly, chatty, empathetic, curious, deep thinking (almost to a fault), emotionally available, honest and principled is how I would describe my character. 
* I prefer tea before coffee in the morning, I play acoustic guitar (but not enough, so I am terrible, still, I could sing you a song though !), I love my EDM of all varieties, trying to get my 5K time down, and I am also vegetarian. I drink socially. I have some vices, but happy to chat about that also. Just being upfront.
* Just fyi - never been in a relationship. I hope that's not a red flag ! It just hasn't happened, for whatever reason. 
* Progressive and left leaning, with some caveats, happy to explain. I believe in a higher power. 
* Not a gamer, into manga, anime, or super nerdy at all. I dont mind if you are though =)
* The book I am currently reading is *Siddhartha* by Herman Hesse. 

What I value, and hopefully you are:

* In that 25-35 age bracket, and from Australia. I don't mind where.
* Kind, curious, emotionally available, someone that rolls with the punches and doesn't sweat the small stuff.
* Employed, full time, preferably university educated.
* Looking for a monogamous, long-term relationship, built on mutually shared values, respect, integrity, and laughter (important!).
* I don't mind your cultural background, or skin colour. 
* Has an appreciation for science, art, music, technology ! 

Hopefully, we're not here for endless reddit chats lmao, shoot through a DM or chat request ! If we click, let’s meet in real life or close the gap if it’s a LDR (only open to this if it feels right), but lets talk ! I am happy to exchange pictures upon the first message =)

Hoping to hear from you soon =)",1,1762132983.0,r4r,1,1.0,False
1omyrgx,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1omyrgx/one_of_gods_best_soldiers_has_been_killed_pt_1/,One of God's Best Soldiers Has been Killed Pt. 1,"Hello all who may be reading this, I cannot promise constant updates as I do not have frequent access to a computer. You see I am a homeless man.

The reason I am writing is because Father Mathew, a good man by all metrics, has been murdered. The church often times throws community outreach programs, feed the homeless, community gifts for families who cannot afford much around the holiday season, clean the southside of Billings, etc.

When I first met Father Mathew, I had just finished an entire bottle of liquor and stumbled into the steps that lie before the church. I could not say what time it was; it was winter about three years ago. I was cold but the warm whiskey down the ol' gullet helped mightily. In my drunken state I figured the stairs would be as perfect of a place to lay my head and catch some ZZ's. Until I heard the door open from behind me. There he was, and in my drunken state I failed to realize that Saturday, turned to Sunday.

However, Mathew did not yell, he didn't tell me to leave. Instead, he asked me if I would like to come inside. He had coffee going.

""Uhh I don't think you want me. I don't believe in your God.""

""Nonsense, everyone is welcome in the house of God. You're going to catch cold if you stay out here.""

He was right, but ya see being a homeless man you're always going to be very cognizant of who was around, and where your stuff was in relation. Can't afford for some punk to steal my stuff and at the time, I saw another homeless man making his way down the street. His grocery cart was shitty lookin, ""HA"" I thought with some sad pride in the fact my grocery cart across the street had all four wheels functioning and didn't make that annoying cart noise those fuckers always make.

I sprinted back across the street from the church where my cart was without a word to the father, to make sure that HOBO didn't touch MY shit. Even if all I owned was shit. It was mine; it was the idea of control over my own ownership.

Then I saw the homeless man from before walk up to the father. Mathew shook his hand and lent him a hand with his cart up the stairs. That was the kind of man Mathew was. However, at the time I thought it was a brilliant way to use the man's kindness. Maybe any other homeless people would be too afraid to steal in church, but I am not like them I thought. At the time, I just thought God wasn't real. I am living proof of *His* cruelness.

I went back across the street and said I'd give it a try. Mathew just like for the man before helped me with the cart. When we got inside a fire was going and it was significantly warmer. The dirty hobo from before was up against the fireplace hording the heat like a selfish pig. Mathew was saying something, but I didn't process it I just went and bumped into the other hobo to scoot and let me in.

He looked up at me, took a minute to really look me up and down. Then he smiled.

""My bad for taking all the heat, here ya go brother.""

I just looked at him in disbelief. Okay maybe I have been a little cruel.

""Thanks.""

""The names Garret."" He shook my hand.

Garret up close was a jolly old timer, probably 50's although it's hard to truly discern due to his large Hobo beard. Despite his jovial attitudes I did not lower my guard of where he was in relation to my shit.

Mathew came up with three mugs and some bread with peanut butter.

""Ah I am glad you were so eager to meet with Garret. I never actually caught your name?""

""Alden""

""Nice to meet you, Alden."" He handed me black coffee and the peanut butter.

It has been so long since I had caffeine. The coffee, the fire, and the bread definitely warmed me up. However, I was still drunk off the whiskey, and after I finished the coffee, I think I slammed the mug on the ground, started mocking Mathews and Garrets God, then running and tripping over one of those stupid church row seats with the stupid pads that are usually purple or some shit. I hit my head real bad and passed out.

When I woke up my head was throbbing, and I was in bed. There was a cross engraved into the door and I knew I never left the church.

""Ah fuck, my shit""

""You mean this 'shit'.""

Mathew was sitting perpendicular to my bed dumping out my duffle bag onto the bed where my legs lay. Pathetically I saw the point he was trying to make. A total of 30 bucks, one glove, one mitten, a tattered flannel, and my pocket watch. He then handed me another mug of black coffee and some Advil. I grabbed the pocket watch immediately before snagging the mug from Mathew.

""Don't worry, I didn't look. It ain't my business.""

""Why didn't you just throw me out?""

""Because Garret is a better man then myself. I wanted to, in fact your words actually did a brilliant job offending me and my faith. Then Garret reminded me how I don't understand what it's like on the street, especially during winter.""

""Who gives a shit or cares what that hobo thinks?""

""Garret lives here at the church. He wanted to get clean, so he stayed here, found his faith. Now he works for us, he knows the street better than I ever could and I might just get stabbed and mugged if I go out alone. He tells people in the community about the churches events we throw so we can really help the best we can. So, I care quite a bit of what Garret thinks, you should be grateful. He sees a lot of himself in you.""

""What time is it?""

""10:30 AM, still Sunday. We have service soon and you are welcome to stay. If you stay and listen, me and Garret are willing to let you stay. Garret wants you to work for him.""

""And you?""

""Like I said, I give a 'shit' about what Garret thinks.""

I went to the service. I still thought it was all shit, but I figured it was a way for me to get a bed to lay on at night, and the church had a kitchen where Mathew, Garret and I would eat. I thought I swindled them. However, it was Garret and Mathew who had me in the palm of their hands. After a couple of weeks, the services started striking a chord for me.

Three years later I with Garret would frequently go out to the community. Mathew and I had grown close as well. I was clean. Would smoke way too much but listen, every man has a vice.

One day on our way back to the church we heard sirens. When we arrived, police surrounded the area. On the same steps where I laid my head three years ago, lay Mathews' cold corpse. Blood streamed down his eyes, his ears, and his nose. No marks, bruises, cuts, and no prints. Garret was strong, I on the other hand wept.

When the police saw two men dressed as hobos walk up, there were some questions to say the least. Once Garret explained they stopped their interrogations. When we got inside Garret looked at me and said we should pray. After we finished, he was crying.

""Mathew performed an exorcism.""

Unfortunately, I have to end it here. I will describe what that bastard Garret told me when I can. The librarians are on their way; they probably can smell the booze from here.",2,1762132877.0,creepcast,2,1.0,False

How should I begin this ? Well, I'm a 31 year old man, looking for a committed long term relationship. The apps are terribly unkind (I've had a few matches, however) and people aren't willing to give each other a chance at all I feel. It's a bit of a catch-22 really, to build a connection with someone requires a little bit of patience and understanding, it's a two way street... So I figure I might as well try reddit, can't hurt right ?! I would like someone to show affection and a little bit of tenderness towards.

A little bit about me in dot point form:

* University educated, I have a double degree, engineering + science, now work in IT full time doing operations/infra work. 
* 173cm (5ft8in), black hair, brown eyes, I would call myself (somewhat?) conventionally attractive. I will let you decide that of course ! 
* Trying to get fitter, I go to the gym 4-5x a week, not overweight, but a little husky I guess? I have a powerlifting coach helping me to achieve a 2-plate bench within the next year. 
* I try to get enough sunshine, exercise, sleep, water, eat lots of fruit & veg. I hope you do too !
* Friendly, chatty, empathetic, curious, deep thinking (almost to a fault), emotionally available, honest and principled is how I would describe my character. 
* I prefer tea before coffee in the morning, I play acoustic guitar (but not enough, so I am terrible, still, I could sing you a song though !), I love my EDM of all varieties, trying to get my 5K time down, and I am also vegetarian. I drink socially. I have some vices, but happy to chat about that also. Just being upfront.
* Just fyi - never been in a relationship. I hope that's not a red flag ! It just hasn't happened, for whatever reason. 
* Progressive and left leaning, with some caveats, happy to explain. I believe in a higher power. 
* Not a gamer, into manga, anime, or super nerdy at all. I dont mind if you are though =)
* The book I am currently reading is *Siddhartha* by Herman Hesse. 

What I value, and hopefully you are:

* In that 25-35 age bracket, and from Australia. I don't mind where.
* Kind, curious, emotionally available, someone that rolls with the punches and doesn't sweat the small stuff.
* Employed, full time, preferably university educated.
* Looking for a monogamous, long-term relationship, built on mutually shared values, respect, integrity, and laughter (important!).
* I don't mind your cultural background, or skin colour. 
* Has an appreciation for science, art, music, technology ! 

Hopefully, we're not here for endless reddit chats lmao, shoot through a DM or chat request ! If we click, let’s meet in real life or close the gap if it’s a LDR (only open to this if it feels right), but lets talk ! I am happy to exchange pictures upon the first message =)

However, I’m finding less and less time to make my own crafts to sell (I do hand embroidery + illustration). I have a lot of passion in connecting people with a craft they can really love and do think there’s a gap where I live for a decent craft supply store (there are local sewing shops of course) outside of Michael’s / Hobby Lobby.

I keep going back to a pop-up / mobile art supply store selling some basic & niche art supplies along with beginner kits to get people started (made by independent artists, not mega wholesalers) and potentially pairing it with classes/activities during markets or outside of markets. I love the idea of connecting people through classes with local makers being able to share their craft with the community.

I also love the idea of having a donation/reuse aspect to it as well — people can bring lightly used supplies for others to sift through. That may be something else entirely

My thought was maybe a cute trailer or something to make set up/tear down easy. Ultimate dream goal would be a brick & mortar combined with a (very minimal/simple) coffee shop concept — tables to bring your craft, grab a lil coffee, pick up supplies on your way out, & also being able to host those classes & events.

I live in a moderately sized city with only 1 Michael’s & Hobby Lobby — both are sort of “destinations” for people.

1omylqf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Chainsawfolk/comments/1omylqf/a_freudian_analysis_of_chainsaw_man_death_drive/,"A Freudian analysis of Chainsaw Man. Death drive, eros, and death","I don’t know why i am finding these relations between freudian concepts to chainsaw man part2 specifically, and I don’t think the author has actually thought any of this out. Just wanting to share an point of view

I have found that part 2 has many themes relationed to freudian psychoanalytical concepts, regarding specifically death and sex drives
Freud defines these concepts as the internal stimulus that come from an organism, ranging from hunger to the need of love or connection. He found that people follow what he called the pleasure principle, that makes the individual move towards desire, love, fulfillment, PLEASURE, in all of it ways. The desire is always ahead, it is never truly fulfilled, it what keeps us moving forward and wanting to live and change, to transform. But he also later found that there is a tendency, one that is mute, that we do not perceive or symbolize within our own minds that wants stagnation, to return to a previous state, to avoid any external or internal tension. It leads us to self destruction, to our trauma, to the ways we have been hurt and convinces us that we deserve it, and wants to keep being in that state. Is a force that drives us into depression, stagnation, is averse to change or improvement, and it leads to thing like self unaliving. He called it death drive. He believed that sex drive(sexual in freud does not means just coitus), the one which follows pleasure is at constant battle with the death drive to keep the organism living. The sex drive is the guardian of life

I think Denji and Pochita represents SEX DRIVE. Is pretty obvious that he wants sex, but that is just the tip of the iceberg. Denji is for himself and the people around him, the guardian of life, he fights for connection, desire, pleasure, to enjoy everything that lifes offers him, he will est anything, love anyone, do anything to keep on living, not surviving, living. He is at a constant struggle with those that represent the death drive
Makima, Death devil, falling devil, and also Asa, Aki, Reze. Some he fights as enemies, but he fights also to the death drive inside the people around him.
He gave aki a family and made him overcome his drive for self destruction and sacrifice and helped him find a motivation in life, connection and family. He made Reze, a person consumed by violence and made her strive for the life she really wanted, with love, coffee, omelett and penguins, she started to get on track of the sex drive. 
And Asa, in the Falling Devil arc, i think is the most clear example of Sex drive (Eros) vs Death drive (Thanatos) and how denji saved asa by protecting her from the self destructive thoughts by putting her back on the principle of pleasure, on the way of desire, connection, love and life. The falling devil for me is much more important than we think. She doesnt represent just falling, she is the Thanatos itself, she is the god of dead, she is the encarnation of the death drive. Hell in chainsaw man works weirdly, is a place where concepts that plague people’s minds manifestate and reside. Hell is like a realm of a Colective Unconscious. How i see it, falling devil represents the fear of our own Thanatos, our own tendency to self destruct, the recurring thought of suicide. She is so powerful because she is the encarnation of a constitutional tendency of humans, and i think pochita represents exactly the opposite, he is the concept of life, he is the eros, the will of living, desiring and everything i described earlier, he could be named after many things that the eros represents, love, desire, pleasure or you could say he is THE SEX DEVIL. Freud states that even if it takes many different forms, the sex drive secures reproduction of the species, it would make that chainsaws, that were used as a tool in childbirth, and the umbilical cord that wraps around black chainsawman are hinting us that what he represents is Life itself, and the unconscious representation of the will to live gave him form as a concept in hell. 
Living is hard, and desiring, connecting or loving is risky, and almost always ends up in pain, the thing we fear most in our lives, is living, because we risk getting hurt. That is why pochita is so powerful
Denji, says it, that even if he loses everything he will find another family, he will keep desiring to live. Pochita didn’t choose denji for nothing, denji is the only human in the world that doesn’t fear living, he is the only one who doesn’t fear pochita. He is the human incarnation of eros. With all its downsides and upsides 

Another thing to note is that Freud says that there is no representation in the psyche for death. We understand the concept, but as being that doesn’t experiment it, we can’t represent it in the unconscious. We in fact cannot fear death, we fear of loss, we fear our own willingness to die, the Thanatos, we fear pain, we fear rejectment, but we cannot fear death directly. The ones who can are Demons. The ones that fear Morti the most are always demons, but we humans do not fear her, she isn’t that powerful on her own because of that, and she need to rely on other demons that represent death, like falling devil, but she herself is not that strong. What scares me is that, if pochita eats Death, humans could experience dying, without having to really die, in yoru’s world, everyone will become Undead. we have seen that concepts that get eaten can come back if reinvented, what if the fear of every human alive experiencing death and not dying, is what ultimately brings Morti back, and the nostradamus prophecy becomes real. The condition to trigger the apocalypse might be pochita himself, if he were to eat Death.
