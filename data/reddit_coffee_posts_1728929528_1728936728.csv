1g3pdvx,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g3pdvx,Interactive Shopping Mall? 🛒🛍️,"So I have an idea. I think we should bring back the shopping mall, where there would be a few retail stores that we could actually go inside of, and the retail stores could sell multiple Avakin brands the way stores like Target, Academy, Dillards, JC Penney, etc, do in real life. The coffee shop in the middle of the shopping mall could be a job area where we could work for coins. In the retail stores we could go up to the clothing rack, and click a button which would bring us to the ‘Shop’ screen, and we’d be able to search through the shop, click on a clothing item of our choice, and be able to actually try it on and walk around the retail store to see if we’d be fully satisfied with it. Being able to do this could make people want to buy an item more. 👀💰. It’d be really fun trying on new releases with your friends and being able to see how each other looks in the items you picked. You could make it where we can only try on one item at a time, so that people aren’t just hanging out there everyday in full outfits + accessories without buying them. There could also be an area with ‘Posing Mirrors’ where we could see our Avakins in the item we chose more up close. Each retail store could be decorated differently with different themes and colors. For the cashiers you could put like one or two LKWD bots just standing at the registers (that we wouldn’t actually use) , and of course you could put mannequins in the front windows of the stores that showcase some of the outfits from the multiple brands. There could also be an area with shopping carts🛒, where we could choose to be put in an animation set where we’re pushing a cart while walking, the same way you can click into the wheel chair at the hospital, and roll around, just for fun. An area that promotes shopping/spending and is also a fun area to hang out in, sounds like a good business decision to me. 😌😌",1,1728936475.0,AvakinOfficial,0,1.0,False

Today I woke up alittle late but enough to go to a gas station before work. I offered to get coffees for me and my boyfriend and get us something for breakfast so we could take our mental health medicine. 

While we walked i started to talk about my car. I have recently bought a car and working on getting my license. I cannot drive it alone even though im 24. So its at my fathers house. It needs new things and I was talking about ABS and how it says its not working on the dashboard. I have been told it means 6 different things at this point. (i know nothing about cars.)

When my boyfriend explains things to me he sounds condescending especially about car things. I tried telling him he makes me feel stupid when he talks to me like that and I will just figure it out on my own and get it fixed accordingly.

He got mad and he started to just argue with me. Saying he knows its one thing and I should listen to him. Im appreciative of that but when my father tells me one thing, he tells me another and someone else tells me another thing I want to actually know what it is. We get to the gas station and the whole way there i was asking him multiple times to drop the subject because i was just getting more hurt and irritated.

We get there and I refuse to go in. I tell him to get himself something while i go home. I just wanted to be alone. Infront of other people he looks at me and says ""well i dont have my fucking wallet, ding ding."" Which I didn't appreciate especially in public. This makes me upset and i do start to cry. 

Ive been struggling mentally and have been having suicidal ideation for the past few weeks. So this didnt help.

A guy saw this interaction, he drove passed us and called my boyfriend an asshole. My boyfriend starts screaming like a psycho. I tell my boyfriend to stop and just move on, i wanted to go home. He screams in my face about what the guy said. I have ptsd. i freeze and start to cry and walk away. My boyfriend starts throwing his umbrella around and trying to just not go home when we had to go to work. 

Im starting to feel like my relationship is a constant cycle of this. He has a huge blow up, treats me like garbage and somehow manipulates me to forgive him.

Our relationship is almost 10 years old, i feel like im outgrowing him and I feel like he'll always be a child.

Hes never acted like this until he cheated on me 2 years ago. Im at a loss.",1,1728936227.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False

I drank a coffee this morning and felt good. Whereas in the past caffeine has made me feel a bit sleepy, this time I was shot awake. 

At lunch I had a pepsi, a tiny one. 6 oz. and I suddenly felt... Insane? Like jumpy and anxious and panicky.

I suppose my question is something along the lines of ""is this normal?""

Should I be concerned about the sudden onset panic or could I chalk it up to first *ever* day on ADHD meds? Is the mix of caffeine and sugar asking to feel a little strange while taking these meds?

1g3p9qe,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1g3p9qe/confused_after_a_first_date/,Confused after a first date ,"I went on a date with a girl I met from OLD. The date went great. We got coffee and walked around for over 2 hours. We sat on a bench, talked, and pretty much cuddled (she initiated). We had a lot in common from music to books to movies and there was obvious instant chemistry. I think she laughed at every joke I said and the vibes were just overall good. She told me to follow her on Instagram and start sending her some reels and she made a notes page in her apps and wrote down books I said I liked. She even bought movie tickets to see a movie I had suggested to her. 

There were talks of a second date for when she got back from her vacation next week (she brought this up). Date ended with a couple very long kisses. Told her to text me when she got back. She drove off and I went to my bike to go home. She didn’t text me but I texted her when I got back. She responded that she did and a smiley face. She asked me what I was doing the rest of the day. I responded and told her and asked her the same. No response. The next day I get a late text from her where she says she’s not ready to date cause of her previous breakup. But this just feels like a token excuse. I understand with OLD this kinda stuff happens but I’ve been given this excuse before. It was obvious there was chemistry and she was the one talking about another date so I’m just confused. Also like her profile is still there and I doubt she’ll delete it (none of my business but just annoying). Part of me wants to just ask if there’s something more but I know I should just move on. 

How do you handle these? It has happened so many times and it’s so disheartening. Is it worth asking for real feedback instead of the bs reason? Why flirt with me after the date if she’s not interested. Dating has really started to feel like a brick wall. ",1,1728936193.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False
1g3p9oo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stories_with_a_lesson/comments/1g3p9oo/how_can_a_coward_overcome_cowardice/,How can a coward overcome cowardice?,"https://preview.redd.it/r3wc1jxm2sud1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=42136781b79a0d6654d63d1c0fba39dbad5b2792

There once was a village near the biggest city in the country that was very special. What was so special about this village was that every villager there was an early adopter of technology and the village was even more advanced than the big city near it. The village had everything automated, robotized, optimized, and every other “ized” there is. The people in the village had one thing in common and that was their affinity for new technology and the courage to implement new things all the time. They also were the happiest in the whole nation, and even though they were “geeks” about the technology they were a very tight-knit community that knew and helped each other with everything. But there was an outlier. A man that everyone called the “village coward”. It may seem cruel but no matter how much anyone tried to help this young man he was always afraid of everything and anyone he didn’t know well. The villagers helped the young man with different therapies and techniques, but they always failed. Even the village spiritual guru couldn’t help him when the villagers brought the “village coward”. Then one day the young man had enough and asked the village spiritual guru for help himself, “I want to overcome cowardice and I am willing to do anything you ask of me. This is not like the last time I was forced to see you I promise.”

The spiritual guru looked at the young man and said, “I’m ready to teach you how to overcome cowardice but under one condition.” The young man promised he would do what the spiritual guru would ask of him. So the guru continued, “First you must go and live in the big city for one month. While you are there you must tell every person you meet that you are a coward. When you go for coffee, or a walk, or to a movie you must look every person you meet in their eyes and loudly but friendly say that you are a coward. After you have done so for one month you can come back for further instructions.” The young man went home and thought over the task he was given by the guru. Naturally, he felt scared and overwhelmed by it, but he kept thinking about it for the next couple of days. Finally, he decided to do as he was told by the guru and he traveled to the city. In the first couple of days in the city, the young man couldn’t talk to anyone, not even to say “Hi”. Whenever he tried to talk to someone he lost his voice as soon as he looked at the person’s eyes. After about a week he felt like giving up, but the thought of being afraid all the time was just not acceptable to him.

So he tried again and finally one day he mustered up the courage to tell one random person that he was a coward. After doing so he decided that it was enough for one day. The next day he managed to tell more people that he was a coward. So he continued, and with each day passing, his voice sounded louder, his eye contact with the person improved and his body stopped shivering when talking to a different person. Soon the young man was not scared anymore to talk to strangers and admit that he is a coward. Even though he had no more issues of telling others his condition he continued to do so as he had promised the guru. Finally, the month passed and the young man could return to the village. Once there he immediately visited the guru and told him that he does not feel fear anymore about anything. He told the guru that not only had he admitted his lack of courage to everyone he had met, but he had also made many new friends. The young man felt proud that he had overcome cowardice but was wondering how the guru knew this task would help him do so.

The guru replied, “You see cowardice is like a habit. If you want to overcome it you have to practice by doing things that scare you. That is what you did each day until you came back and as a result, you have overcome cowardice with the habit of courage. Now that you have learned this secret you can implement it everywhere. All you need to do is replace one habit with another. Step by step.”

The lesson I got from this story:

 - You shouldn't be ashamed of feeling fear. But like the young man in the story, you need to start making those first steps to start overcoming it. You shouldn't do foolish things to prove to yourself or to others how brave you are. Do ""small things"" ... Make ""small steps"".

1g3p590,https://www.reddit.com/r/MSCCruises/comments/1g3p590/very_good_mediterranean_cruise_with_msc_seaside/,Very good Mediterranean Cruise with MSC Seaside - october 2024,"We just returned from a cruise aboard MSC Seaside, and here’s our overall impression:

* Delicious food
* Excellent cabin (balcony on the 15th deck)
* Easy+ Drink Package – great value for money
* Incredibly kind and service-oriented staff, especially in the main dining room

Given the negative reviews MSC often receives, I was pleasantly surprised by our experience. I suspect much of the criticism comes from either competitors or overly picky travelers who complain about minor details.

Here’s a more detailed, step-by-step review of our 7-day cruise, which followed this itinerary:

Rome - Palermo - Sea day - Ibiza - Valencia - Marseille - Genoa - Rome.

We traveled as a couple: myself (61) and my wife (53).

**Embarkation in Civitavecchia**  
We chose the first embarkation slot (11-12) and highly recommend it. There were no lines, and to our surprise, our cabin was ready upon arrival. The embarkation process was smooth and polite, with a short briefing provided in English. 

**Tip**: Take the train from Rome Termini – it's affordable (€17.50 per person), and includes a bus transfer to the MSC terminal.

**Balcony Cabin on the 15th Deck**  
Our cabin was spacious, featuring a large bed, a couch, and a workspace. The bathroom was a bit snug but still manageable for two tall people (181 cm and 191 cm). The couch could use a cleaning, but otherwise, the cabin was spotless. For us, the balcony was a must-have, large enough for two and a lovely spot to enjoy the scenery. Cabin service was provided twice a day, with towels changed if left on the bathroom floor. There are two European electrical outlets at the desk and one near the bed, plus USB-B ports for charging.

**Tip**: Deck 15 is located directly below the restaurant on Deck 16. Some faint morning noise was noticeable, likely from cleaning, but it wasn’t an issue for us. If you’re concerned, consider Deck 14 or below.

**Buffet Restaurants**  
We enjoyed breakfast and lunch at Biscayne Bay on Deck 16 whenever possible. It’s brighter and airier than the Marketplace on Deck 8. The food quality is very good, comparable to that of a nice hotel in Norway. The pasta, pizza, and bread were excellent, and the hot dishes and vegetables were well-prepared. While it’s not a gourmet experience, if you appreciate hearty, well-made meals and Italian cuisine, this is the place for you.

**Tip**: Buffet restaurants can get crowded. If you prefer a quieter setting, you can always have your meals in your assigned main dining room (we only did this for dinner).

**Main Dining Room**  
We had dinner in the Seashore Restaurant at the same table with the same waiters each night. The food here was also very good, though not gourmet (which we prefer to avoid anyway). The wait staff were attentive and efficient, with dinner service taking about 1 to 1.5 hours from start to finish. Each evening, the menu offered 4-5 appetizers, 5-6 main courses, and 4-5 desserts, with the selection varying daily. The main dining room provided a quiet, relaxing dining experience, a nice contrast to the occasionally noisy buffet.

**Specialty Restaurants:** We didn't dine at any of the specialty restaurants on board.

**Pools, Bars, and Other Public Spaces**  
Although the ship was fully booked, we never had any issues finding a place to sit, whether indoors or outdoors. The Miami Beach area on Deck 16 is lively and bustling, featuring a stage with various forms of entertainment and activities. In contrast, South Beach, located aft on Deck 7, is smaller but much quieter. One morning, we enjoyed a peaceful reading session in an almost empty Sports Bar before it opened. Despite this, the staff from the adjacent Piano Bar were happy to serve us.

**Drink Package**  
We opted for the Easy+ Drink package, which includes non-alcoholic beverages, coffee, Heineken beer, two types of red and white wine, sparkling wine, and a variety of other drinks. It's convenient to have unlimited drinks for a fixed price, but it's important to calculate whether it’s worth it for you. As a rule of thumb, if you consume at least two beers, two glasses of wine, and some soft drinks or water per day, the Easy+ package offers good value. If you drink less than that, it may be more cost-effective to pay as you go. You can easily find detailed information about MSC’s drink packages and prices online. Occasionally, the Easy+ package is available at a discount when booking your cruise, making it an even better deal.

**Wi-Fi Package**  
Offshore internet bandwidth is limited, but it's sufficient for basic tasks like emails, web browsing, and social media of your choice. However, if you plan to watch your favorite TV shows or movies, it's best to download them while still within range of cellular networks. The Wi-Fi package is tied to the first device you log in with, and you won’t be able to switch devices or share the connection unless you're familiar with MAC spoofing. You'll definitely need the Wi-Fi package if you want to stay connected, especially on the stretch from Palermo to Ibiza when you spend a full day at sea.

**Disembarkation in Civitavecchia**  
Our schedule was tight for the final leg of the journey, with the ship arriving at 8:00 AM and our flight from FCO at 11:30 AM. However, the crew handled everything smoothly: we were allowed to carry our own luggage and disembark at our convenience. We had a car waiting for us at 8:30 AM and reached the airport in plenty of time for our flight.

What We Liked:

* Bus tickets for the shuttle service next day were conveniently placed in our cabin the night before arrival, and we were only charged if we used them.
* Despite the buffet restaurants being crowded at times, there was always plenty of good-quality food.
* The MSC For Me app provided a wealth of information and was accessible even without an internet package.

**Overall: This was a highly enjoyable cruise experience and excellent value for money!**",1,1728935895.0,MSCCruises,0,1.0,False

We all started talking as we were all new and so I made a groupchat with us all. He dmd me separately and we started talking about music. Soon we would meet up during uni and eat lunch together and walk and talk as well. Then we started to hug, which I did first since im a very affectionate person. He told me he wasn’t used to that but I asked him if it was fine and he said yes. Then he would ask to meet near the station and we would talk alot and he would tell me how he liked to talk to me so much. Then one day I was late and he was a bit annoyed and so I wrote him a note on paper saying sorry. He seemed to enjoy my notes. recently (last 2 times) he decided to stay with my train until the end and told me how he loved to talk to me. On last Friday especially we hug on the train. I always said to me you’re a really good friend and stuff. I meant this all platonically. Today he bought me a coffee and everything was going fine. This guy who flirts with me did so in front of me and I got told how he is a bit jealous of other guys talking to me. He asked me to meet him in the parl after the lecture and asked me ‘what does it all mean’. I told him I had no feelings for him, it was platonic. After that he acted really strange, saying ‘the sun has set’ and that we have overstepped boundaries and it’s a bit embarrassing for him. I told him that I dont feel any difference but I feel sort of disgusted for him thinking like that. i left and just before that he said that he thinks that things can’t go back to normal and how the notes I gave him were ‘weird’ and how when I told him he was my fav person in the world that was a lie. He said he doesn’t know who I am and it’s better for us to just be mutuals. I was hurt bc I loved spending time with him. I unfollowed him on socials but couldn’t stop thinking about him.

My roommate and I often buy groceries separately, but sometimes would buy the basics together. Let's just say her appetite isn't the smallest, so most of the essentials like bread, milk, eggs, coffee, etc. would run out quickly before I can even get a proper taste of them.

When it comes to separately bought stuff, I never eat any of her food or use anything of hers without taking permission. The same cannot be said for her. She often helps herself to any of my groceries and food without asking me. At first, I didn't bring it up, but eventually I had to start announcing if I'm saving something in the fridge for me to eat later in fear of it disappearing overnight.

For example, I usually buy instant ramen in a pack of 5. There have been several instances where I'd only get the chance to have one pack and find the other four gone because she helped herself without asking! So I started to hide them in my room. Many similar occurrences happened which resulted in me having a stash of groceries in the corner of my room.

Last week, I bought some pretty expensive sliced sourdough from a bakery to try out, and left it at the kitchen counter the night I bought it to have it for breakfast the next day (I should've known better). Imagine my surprise when I found three slices gone the next morning. I brushed it off but forgot to move the bread to my room in my rush to head to work. That day, I came back and found only 1 slice left of the whole loaf. 1 slice!!!

We already had some sliced white toast in the kitchen. She chose to ignore it and finish my entire loaf. That made me snap and tell her not to eat my stuff without asking, and move all of the groceries in the pantry I bought myself to my room.

Throughout the week, she has been asking me if I've got any left from my groceries, and I just feel so awkward handing stuff out to her from my corner, and generally guilty about hiding it. Especially considering the fact that she earns significantly less than I do. My family has also been telling me that it's just food, and I overreacted severely and caused unnecessary hostility between us.

I genuinely feel so guilty, but I couldn't handle it after she laid hands on my sourdough.

AITH?

  
Edit: she's been struggling a lot financially lately so that just adds significantly to the guilt as well. ",2,1728935773.0,AITAH,3,1.0,False

For the first 2 weeks of our breakup I didn't beg but I did say I wanted us to try again. She said she didn't want to. Initially, she wanted us to remain friends, but realised that breaking up with me would mean that would be unlikely. So we ended up saying our goodbyes because I said I'd have to cut her out of my life to move on. It was very traumatic. I then said I wouldn't contact her again, but if she ever needed me she knew where I was. Since then, I've accepted the breakup and I can admit it was the right thing to do.

We've been no contact now for 30 days. I still want us to reconcile but I am also getting desperate to contact her. There's still things I want to say and get off my chest. I also want to see her and speak with her. I'm not naïve to the fact that if she wanted to reach out then she would have, but I also feel that I'm the one who started NC in the first place. We are still both on social media. Neither of us have blocked each other.

She told me that she loves me but isn't in love with me. She told me she doesn't know how to contemplate a life without me. It wasn't a messy relationship or a messy breakup. We also both admit we have this deep emotional connection with each other so I don't feel like there's any bad blood.

I don't intend to reach out now. I am thinking about breaking NC in 2-3 weeks time. By then we'll have gone roughly 50 days or so without any contact and I (hopefully) will be even stronger.  I've also read 45-60 days/8 weeks is the ""sweet spot"" for *some* dumpers to start to question their decision. There comes a point for me where I feel I have nothing left to lose. I would send something like this:

*I know I said I wouldn't contact you again, but it still feels so surreal you're not part of my life anymore. I want you to know that I have accepted our breakup. It was the right thing to do. That's been a really painful conclusion for me to reach. I know you might not want to hear from me again, but I still think about you a lot and it would be nice to have a chat, or perhaps meet for coffee. I have zero expectations and simply just want to gauge how we feel about doing that. If you're not comfortable with that, I understand.*

I think it's fairly non-threatening. I don't want to put any kind of pressure on her by saying I want to get back together - not straight away. I'm also well aware she could ignore my message or say no.

Being in charge meant that Blake could ask someone else to drive him if he desired. The passenger role was excellent as it meant sleeping through the journey. Private Tyler was a godawful driver, and the journey was filled with unnecessary bumps and twists. Leaving Blake awake begging to take over, but Tyler refused to relinquish the wheel citing protocol. When they reached Ura city hall, Blake was traumatized by the experience. 

""Right this way sir."" Tyler exited first to open the door for his supervisor who stayed in the car staring at nothing in particular.

""I am going to grandma's house. Aren't I?"" Blake muttered. Tyler laughed and unbuckled the Colonel's seatbelt.

""Don't worry about that. Let's get you inside."" Tyler grabbed Blake's arm and pulled him out of the vehicle. Thankfully, Blake still remembered how to walk, but he had to be guided inside.

Paint and food covered the interior walls of city hall. A cat stood on the highest perch licking a patch of suspicious looking meat. A painting on the wall had been taken off and replaced by a crude stick figure in red marker. Another stick figure was drawn next to it in blue holding a knife. It was childish anarchy everywhere. Tyler and Blake took a few steps forward.

""Gotcha now."" Someone yelled and tossed a slice of ham. Tyler ducked, but the meat collided with Blake's face. The shock of pork shook him from his existential crisis.

""Who defaced me with spam?"" Blake's voice bellowed through city hall and across Ura. The call notified Derrick and Becca of his arrival who left their safe-haven in the restrooms at the back of the main hall.

""You are finally here."" Becca ran forward and hugged the Colonel tightly. ""It's been chaos."" Blake shrugged her off out of a despise of human touch. 

""I thought there was a power struggle over a mayoral position."" Colonel Blake looked around the room. ""This looks like two children squabbling over their favorite toy.""

""My report indicated the mayor had an immature temperament."" Tyler held up a finger and smiled. Derrick and Becca's face twisted as they both realized the kind of person that accompanied the Colonel.

""Which one threw food on me?"" Blake asked.

""That would be Peter. He found the cafeteria supplies and weaponized it,"" Derrick said.

""Get them both in here. I need to tell him that he isn't going to be mayor,"" Blake replied.

""That's going to be hard sir. They fortified themselves well,"" Becca said.

""I don't care. You."" Blake pointed at Derrick. ""Let's go find Evelyn. You two, get Peter."" The four separated to retrieve the combatants.

Derrick led Blake through a series of halls and doors. That wing wasn't meant to be confusing. The architect was inebriated during construction. Their adventure was in complete silence which both men appreciated. When they reached Evelyn's hiding spot, Colonel Blake opened the door. He was greeted by a golf ball which hit his stomach. 

""Ha, you're dead meat."" Evelyn's victory was cut short when she realized who she had assaulted. The officer gritted his teeth and glared at Evelyn.

""Get back to the hall, now."" He never raised his voice, but Evelyn felt compelled to obey. Derrick smirked as she ran by in fear.

Becca learned Private Tyler Tyler V's entire biography in the comparatively short distance to Peter's hideout. She learned why Tyler Tyler was a family name (great-great-grandfather changed it to appeal to a forgetful general), the secret to his mom's cake recipe (baked beans, sounded awful), and how he liked his tea (espresso, he didn't realize this was coffee). When they reached Peter, they found the door shut. Tyler knocked on the door.

""I am here with the military to-"" Tyler couldn't get the next word out as Peter left the room. Peter immediately opened the door.

""Finally, we can resolve this."" Peter started walking towards the city hall. Tyler and Peter lectured about their lives during the journey; Becca wondered if this was the worst day of her life. In the middle of city hall, the two sides came to meet. Peter smirked in victory while Evelyn shook in fear. 

""I was here for five minutes. In that timeframe, I was hit by both of you. I expected to be caught up in hours long argument and prepared accordingly. Now, I don't want to waste another second here. Let's resolve this quick and easy,"" Blake said.

""Couldn't agree more,"" Peter smirked and put his hand on the Colonel's shoulder. ""I accept the position that I am immensely qualified for. I look forward to you working for me. I mean working with you to drive this city and soon the world back into prosperity. It's my desire that-""

""Shut up. She's the mayor not you,"" Blake retorted. Peter looked at the man in shock.

""I was told that I had the position."" Peter looked at Tyler.

""I never said that,"" he replied.

""It's true. He didn't."" Becca nodded her head having heard every word the verbose private said.

""But why? She's awful."" Peter pointed at Evelyn who was smiling from ear to ear.

""I was going to resolve this by flipping a coin, but you decided to interrupt me. I decided to go with the person who angered me once,"" Blake said.

""This isn't fair,"" Peter shouted. Evelyn wanted to mock him, but she had enough sense to not press her luck yet. ""You are all morons. You'll all be wallowing in your droppings. I'll show you. I'll lead someone else to success."" He ran out of city hall waving his arms in a dramatic fashion. 

""Alright, that settles this. Let's get back to base. I'll drive,"" Blake said.

""But policy says-"" Tyler started. Blake gave him look which shut him down. Evelyn, Becca, and Derrick were left alone. Evelyn let out a loud whoop.

""I'm the boss still."" She began dancing dramatically. ""Everyone has to obey me. Cause I am the queen."" She continued her dance for a prolonged period. ""Alright, now clean this up."" She said to an empty room. Everyone left glad that the nightmare had ended.

1g3ophy,https://imgur.com/a/uUi39QI,Chicago food diary - 6 days of overindulgence,"TLDR at the end. Apologies in advance for mobile formatting, the poor food photography and the massive essay lol. I have adjusted some scores after eating and comparing to other products in the same category as I do tend to rate too high in the moment. 

A bit about me
I work in the food service industry as back of house in the UK. (I believe the position is called expo over here for those in the know)
Bit of a foodie, despite being a slightly picky eater. But I know what I like and I can tell when food is made with care and passion.

You’ll notice the scores are .5 or .0, I really don’t care for scores like .2 .6 etc, not a fan of this trend. If you’re gonna do that just rate /100.

1) Allez Cafe (ate outside)
Good breakfast sando 7.5/10 
(probably 8.5/10 if food was hotter and had extra bacon)
The texture contrast between the hash brown and fluffy soufflé egg was really good. The jalapeño jam really completed it, more spice would be welcome though.
I’d probably like some extra bacon if I went back (not sure if this can be added) and the sandwich was a little cold, can be forgiven as they were busy.

Coffee here wasn’t to my liking, it had quite a harsh acidity although I won’t be rating coffee as I’m not that knowledgeable about it. 

Impulsive purchase of brown butter miso chocolate cookie, absolutely fantastic 9/10.
There isn’t a photo of this… I wonder if this is going to be a recurring thing on this trip.
Crunchy but soft inside, gooey melty chocolate. I couldn’t taste the miso but the top was sprinkled with Maldon sea salt. It was gone before I had a chance to take a pic.

2) Tempesta Market (takeout)
#10 Porchetta sandwich, bread was good, meat was well seasoned, juicy and crispy. Overall well balanced, maybe slightly too salty by the end, nothing that can’t be remedied by pairing with a sweet soda! 
Came with a rosemary au jus that I felt didn’t add anything. 7/10

3) Output Bar & Lounge (delivery)
Wasn’t feeling very sociable, so I got delivery of 10 wings (lemon pepper and sweet & spicy) and their infamous onion rings. 8.5/10 (9.0 if wing variations were more evenly distributed)
Wings were great, crispy outer shell and seasoned well. Definitely want to try their other flavours. Quite disappointed I got 4 drums and 1 flat with each flavour, not sure if this is the norm but it’s a bit strange to me.

Onion rings were slightly sad due to delivery but I could tell they were overly heavy/greasy and the batter was a bit beaten up during frying. (No rating as it’s mostly my fault for ordering delivery)

4 & 5) Egg Tuck
Egg bacon and cheese. Wow. What an amazing breakfast sandwich. Difficult to eat despite the great packaging, almost had to slurp the eggs like ramen broth!
Only thing I’d say is I’d like the bacon to be crispy! It was all flop, I still throughly enjoyed it though!
9.0/10 (9.5 with crispy bacon) 

6 & 7) Ramen-San happy hour
Karaage is great, hot and crispy with a nice lime aioli. For $6, it was amazing! 9/10

Ice cold Asahi, goes down real easy. 9.5/10 Also my bartender Gabi was great to chat to!

Thai tea creme brûlée had a great rich Thai tea flavour but lacked the typical glassy sugary crunch I’d expect from a creme brûlée which you could crack with the back of a spoon. However this was comped, so no rating. With extra sugar and slightly more burnt it would be a very good dessert, I’m a sucker for flavour variations on creme brûlée.

8, 9 & 10) Armitage Ale House
Wagyu double cheeseburger with bacon 9/10 
Great burger, beef tasted great (although I don’t think the “wagyu” added anything) and the bacon was amazing, thick-cut, juicy and glazed with maple. 

Sticky date cake 10/10
Oh my lord it is amazing, the hype is real. It’s got a crispy edge, tender inside, kinda like a brownie. The brown butter gelato was pretty good, could maybe do with some extra brown butter bits and a sprinkle of salt. The crumble really added some great texture to the dish which ticked all my boxes. 
I’m a Brit so I’ve had my fair share of sticky toffee puddings, this is very likely the best one I’ve ever had.
I was so full I waddled out of that place…
If you were there on Monday 7th October, I was that guy at the bar trying to forcefully finish that damn date cake 😂

11) Metric Coffee
Again, harsh acidity for me personally, maybe I’m going to the wrong places for my coffee taste. Sad there were no croissants or kouign amann’s left.

12) Hendrickx 7/10
Second attempt at getting a laminated pastry for breakfast. I had the pistachio chocolate croissant, not the flakiest croissant I’ve had but it was still crispy outside and the filling tasted great.

13 & 14) 3 Little Pigs
The team there is so friendly, also met Henry Cai himself, could’ve chatted with him all day but he’s a busy man, so genuinely friendly though!

Salt and pepper chicken sandwich 9.5/10
This is one of my favourite Chinese seasonings and to put it in a chicken sandwich is just amazing food innovation. 
The chicken was juicy, crunchy and was paired with a sweet mayo and jalapeños giving it a slight kick. 
It could’ve used more S&P seasoning but that’s just my taste buds! 
The curly fries are pretty damn perfect too, really crispy and well seasoned.

BBQ pork 8.5/10
I consider myself an expert in char siu/BBQ pork. 3LPs version is excellent, it’s tender, fatty and smoky, the glaze is something else too! However it’s not a traditional version, as it’s been smoked at a low temp. The high heat roasted version is my favourite as it gets caramelised with dark crispy edges. 
(I think by now you can tell I’m a big texture and texture contrast guy!)

15, 16 & 17) Akahoshi Ramen
I may still be slightly bitter about being charged $2 for togarashi, the same price as a ramen egg.

Miso ramen 8/10
Great chashu, very tender. Noodles had a great bite, absolutely amazing noodle making, you can’t get that texture without freshly made noodles. The soft boiled egg is impressive too. You can absolutely tell they take pride in their ingredients and use them to the fullest extent.
I don’t think miso ramen is for me personally but I still really enjoyed this bowl.

Soupless tantanmen 9.5/10
This is amazing, right up my street with the nutty sesame paste and the numbing sichuan peppercorns, they don’t skimp on the spice! I can see why people love it with rice at the end, I wish I had the stomach capacity.

My neighbour got the special, the black garlic tonkotsu, I definitely had food envy.
I do think there’s a chance my tastebuds have been overwhelmed by over-seasoned food on my US trip, at home I’d probably appreciate the subtle flavours of their miso more.
Even after all this I wasn’t as full as after Armitage Alehouse last night!

18) Margie’s Candies 
Hot fudge sundae with butter pecan and praline ice cream. 7/10
Nothing mind blowing, but solid ice cream and it was my first time trying hot fudge, loved it!

19, 20, 21) Kasama
Longanisa breakfast sando with hash brown. 9.5/10
Really damn good. Egg is denser but silky and custardy compared to Allez’s soufflé which is more airy and fluffy. Longanisa tastes great, subtle sweetness with a fragrance of something I can’t quite put my finger on.
Good temperature compared to Allez.
Hash brown has a great texture but it is basically a McDonald’s frozen hash brown (which is one of the greatest pleasures in life, especially when it’s piping hot).
However I prefer Allez’s hash brown, which is more finely shredded and made in house.
I’m imagining Kasama’s sando with Allez hash brown which sounds amazing to me.

Sticky pecan bun 7.5/10
Crispy, flaky, nutty and sweet, can’t ask for much more but it doesn’t excite me and I would get something else instead next time.

Ube Huckleberry Basque Cake 10/10
Wow! I had no idea what to expect, it’s kinda fudgy like a brownie but with a buttery crunchy biscuit/cookie vibe and a fruity, fragrant jammy inside.

I had the iced ube latte too but I felt the coffee drowned out the ube. The kalamansi lemonade looked really good too, I feel like that would pair well with their savoury breakfast/lunch plates.

22) Carnitas Uruapan 7.5/10
Great vibe from the place! I got the carnitas especial. Chicharron was amazing, light, airy and crunchy!
I got the mix of everything carnitas which were tender and juicy, although I wasn’t a fan of the soft pork skin which I felt wasn’t rendered properly and was a bit chewy for my taste. I felt it could use some more salt just to enhance the flavour of the meat more.
Tortillas were hot and fresh, really enjoyed them with the carnitas.

23) Fatso’s Last Stand (delivery)

Polish 9/10
Great snap on the sausage, the mustard and grilled onions really enhanced it. Really enjoyed this.
(Really wishing I had time to go to Jim’s Original for their Polish now)

Double char dog Chicago style 4/10
Char dog was maybe too charred for me and I like my food quite dark and caramelised. This was closer to burnt than charred. 
I don’t think Chicago style is for me, bit too much going on for me (I’ll probably get some hate for that lol) but I don’t think the tomato and pickle added anything to it. I’d be much happier with mustard, onions and relish only. 4/10

Mac & Cheese
Definitely a great mac, good bite to the pasta, not mushy at all. Good cheesy flavour with a silky smooth sauce. Maybe would’ve been nice with a breadcrumb topping for some crunch. 8/10

I barely touched the fries, they were pretty decent but I ordered way too much for one person.

24) Good Ambler
Fantastic croissant 9/10
crispy and flaky, with a lovely buttery smell. Definitely one of the better croissants I’ve had, I’d maybe like it taller though.

Kouign Amman 7/10
This was kinda like the diet soda of kouign amanns, not quite buttery rich or sugary enough to be a real kouign amann. I get why it’s like that, they have to appeal to a wider customer base. I didn’t dislike it but it’s not quite what I was looking for.

25) Al’s Beef
Regular beef, dipped and sweet. 8.5/10
I ordered so smoothly the guy thought I was a UIC student, I was so proud haha!
Really enjoyed this sandwich, the beef was tender and well seasoned. Mushy bread isn’t for me though.
Next time I’d just get it wet and I don’t think the sweet peppers added much, maybe the hot peppers would have some more acidity? which I felt was lacking from the sandwich, needed something acidic to cut through the richness of the meat.
At least I know how to order for my personal preference in the future!

26) Kurimu
Thai tea soft serve cone 7/10
Quite nice, less airy than most soft serves. They don’t have the best reputation I think but I’m a sucker for soft serve. 
The Thai tea could probably be stronger but it was still very smooth and a nice cooling sweet treat.

(No picture) Firecakes donuts
Apple cider donut 5/10
Heard so much about this but it turns out I don’t like cake donuts, yeasted are my preference. Nice flavour to it but too dense in texture.

27 & 28) Monk’s Pub
Stopped in for a pint? a beer? Not sure what Americans call it now I think about it 😂

Tempura cheese curds 7.5/10
Hot, fresh and crispy, I enjoyed these! Ranch was good, not sure if these curds would’ve paired better with marinara or ranch but they were nice.

29) Nancy’s 
Thin crust with Italian sausage and roasted peppers 8.5/10
Really enjoyed this a lot, glad I tried this over deep dish, thinner crusts are generally my preference. Really liked the herbiness of the Italian sausage, the tomato sauce is great, peppers were sweet and the cheese held it all together.

30) Sawada Coffee
Thanks to my seat neighbour at Akahoshi Ramen for this recommendation.
This was actually my 2nd time here, the first time a few days ago, I got a hot military latte (pictured) which is matcha and espresso together. That was my first time having it and the combo is interesting. 8/10

Today I got the iced military latte with vanilla syrup which helped balance the bitterness, I really enjoyed this drink and it would be the order I’d recommend to everyone. 9/10

31, 32 & 33) Alla Vita lunch menu $25
Probably my final meal in Chicago, at least in the city. Cute vibe, service is lovely, fine dining ish? but not pretentious which is what I was looking for. Good vibes too, they don’t rush you. I don’t eat much pasta but when I do, I really like it to be of a higher quality.

After eating here, I do think I should make more of an effort into finding sit down meals that are good value and serve good food like this place. 

Fall apple panzanella 9.5/10 (with more croutons I’d give it a 10/10)
A really well balanced salad. Sweet, salty, acidic and nutty from the brown butter vinaigrette and shaved parm. 
Slight bitterness from the leaves but the sweet apple slices balanced that out. 
Loved the (brown butter?) croutons, those were really the cherry on top. 
I’ll be trying to recreate this salad at home for sure.

Rigatoni Alla vodka 8.5/10
Great cooking on the pasta, definitely al dente, really good bite to it. It’s got to be fresh pasta right? 
First time having vodka sauce, I do like it but I feel like the flavour is quite one-dimensional to me. It doesn’t quite pop like a good tomato sauce does, maybe the cream washes out too much of the tomato and spice from the pepper flakes. I’ve never been a cream in pasta sauce kinda person though, so maybe a more traditional Italian pasta is more to my taste than American-Italian food.
I’ve seen a video on alcohol in pasta sauces, which suggested that gin is a better addition to this style of sauce due to the botanicals in gin, so I may give that a try at home. 

Maple syrup gelato 10/10
I’m a sucker for anything flavoured with real maple syrup.
This gelato is amazing, in the top 5 ice creams I’ve ever had. The maple fragrance and flavour comes through really strongly without being overwhelming sweet. The gelato is dense but smooth and creamy as it should be.

What I regretted not having time/stomach space to try:
Deep dish
Italian sub from Fontano’s or J.P Graziano 
Jibarito’s y mas 
Bayan Ko diner
Cinnamon roll pancakes from Sweet Maple
Jeni’s ice cream
Crisp for Korean fried chicken
Taqueria El Milagros
Chiu Quon Bakery for the bolo char siu bao
Qing Xiang Yuan or Jiao
Daisie’s onion dip and Caesar wrap
The Purple Pig
Little Bad Wolf
 
TLDR/the best stuff: 
Allez Cafe: choc chip cookie - 9/10
Egg Tuck: bacon and egg - 9/10
Ramen-San: Chicken Karaage - 9/10 (happy hour $6)
Armitage Ale House: 
Burger with bacon - 9/10
Sticky date cake - 10/10
3 Little Pigs: salt and pepper chicken sandwich - 9.5/10
Akahoshi Ramen: soupless tantanmen 9.5/10
Kasama: Breakfast sandwich - 9.5/10

He seemed nice enough although a bit shy (I am quite shy too so I don't mind). When I didn't carry on the conversation he would go quiet at first and I thought he wanted to leave, but it seemed as time went on he got more comfortable and kept looking for excuses to keep hanging out. I noticed towards the end of the date he would keep staring into my eyes for long periods of time until I broke eye contact, and held my hand for a while which was unusual for a first date but quite sweet.

What I'm confused about was whether I should message him when I'm free again or if he just wants to be left alone? He hasn't messaged since the date so I would generally assume no. But during the date he did ask three or so times about meeting during this week if I was free, and I kept saying probably not as I was busy. Especially at the end he said see you soon, and I said probably not because I'm busy. Prior to the date he also asked me out a couple times as well.

As a man would you still message a woman first in this scenario if you wanted to see her again?",1,1728934837.0,relationship_advice,5,1.0,False

I started getting sick in February this year. I have been in pain ever since. I was originally diagnosed with an ulcer. After all kinds of tests, they couldn’t figure out what I had. I had a physical reaction to the drink for a hyda scan so my surgeon was sure it was my gallbladder… got that yeeted Aug 14th and it really didn’t do much. Surgeon said it was inflamed and had polyps and Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses ( outpouching of the gallbladder wall), so basically, it was good we had it removed . Finally was able to get in with the GI dr and I had the scopes done. Colonoscopy was on Thursday… had polyps and diverticulosis. I have my appointment on the 29th to discuss results. I’m at such a loss as I’ve seen on here that there’s flare ups and triggering foods. However my pain has never stopped since February. It doesn’t go away unless I don’t eat. I changed my whole diet when I started having symptoms. No carbs, sugar, fried foods, or caffeine. I’ve lost about 30lbs. I have to eat, which I do… but I’m in pain after. I’m so frustrated. Will this ever become manageable?! After my gallbladder was removed salads have become the most painful thing I eat so now I can’t even have that. The only plus is that I suffered chronic constipation before gallbladder surgery and now i always have loose stool… I do take miralax in the am, everyday in some mushroom coffee. I’m just so over this! Anyone have a similar experience? Any tips? ",2,1728934826.0,Diverticulitis,3,1.0,False

I’ve been searching for an alternative source of caffeine that won’t shave 10 years off my life (like monster energy or something). 


So I do some light research and hear about Green Tea. I got regular Tesco Green Tea and brewed in with 2 bags boiling water and drink it with the bags left inside. For a few days it was fine, nice ritual.


then Last night i had 2 cups at 9pm and found it difficult to sleep -too awake, which was strange and not like me. Then this morning I woke up, it’s Monday, I feel super tired as usual and I have a pain in my arms from the gym so I took 2 paracetemol/caffeine tablets (120mg caffeine) and then I had 1 cup of green tea -so that’s maybe 3 cups in a 12 hour period. 


i leave to head to work - a 15 minute drive and I notice at the start of the drive that i feel very alert and awake, I feel focused and pretty good. Well on the 15 minute drive to work that feeling increased and increased until i was basically on the edge of a panic attack and felt kind of weak and hollow. And it lasted all day?

I was very productive in work but more to distract myself. I left work at 6pm and why am I still “strange”? It’s not jittery it’s sort of dissociative. So obviously i messed up here and i will be more careful but could this actually be caused by just L-theanine??",1,1728934778.0,tea,1,0.67,False

Hello everyone,

I’m looking to understand how repair services work in Dubai, particularly for items like coffee machines or other household appliances.

Is there a property management service that typically handles repairs for residents, or do we need to deliver the items directly to a repair center? Additionally, I’m curious about how long the repair process usually takes and the general costs involved.

Any insights or experiences would be greatly appreciated!

Thank you in advance for your help.

I am a 29 year old man living in the South West of the UK. I've been here all of my life, I was born and raised here and I can't see myself leaving any time soon.



The below text has been tight to my body for nearly two decades now and nobody knows it, but here I am spilling it out on the Internet. But I think it's a good move to make considering I WANT to be a better person.



Growing up, I had to watch fights between my parents. I was subjected to a lot of abuse from my father, and was used as a pawn in custody and financial battles between my parents. I lived with my mother throughout my teenage years, and a couple of months with my father. I did well at school. I was never gifted, but I enjoyed it and I was happy with my progress. 



I walked in my mother a few times after she had tried to take her own life, I was maybe 13/14 at the time. I had to watch her bring home so many different men, hearing her have sex a lot of the time. I repressed my feelings and emotions and just sat and played on my Xbox. This was something I was good at, and took great pleasure in coming home from school and jumping on with my friends. I was an avid BMX rider too during my teenage years and I thoroughly enjoyed the summers down the skatepark. I didn't have many friends, just one, J, who is still my best friend to this day, nearly twenty years on.



I got into my first relationship when I was 13. First proper relationship. We were also our firsts. Yes I lost my virginity when I was 13. We stayed together for about 2 years and as we were children growing up I didn't know how to control my emotions. We'd often physically fight. That ended and I thought it was the end of the world. Being a child, I had lots to do to take my mind of things. I quickly got over her, aaaaaand pretty much immediately jumped into another relationship. Same thing happened there. I was about 15/16 and dating this girl who didn't even live in the same city as I did. We'd have sex and it was a fun experience being young and in love. She fell pregnant, and miscarried. This was a hard time for both of us. Around this time, my education started to slip. I felt confused about everything going on, and knew that the only time I felt safe was with another person. 



I met M when I was 16, and she was everything I wanted at the time. She was 15, and we continued to date throughout the end of the year. It was another enjoyable experience where we spent a lot of time together. We had sex, although it was not her first time either. I cheated on her. I was still a kid and didn't know how to handle my emotions that were now building up in such a way that they were starting to sit front and center. After that relationship ran it's course, she accused me of r\*\*ping her. This was a convoluted process where they waited for me to be tried as an adult. I went through the UK court system as I became an adult, worrying if I had just ruined my life, forever. The allegations were proven wrong as they were, and I was instead tried for underage sex with a minor as I was 16 and she was 15 (or something like that). I was handed a suspended prison sentence and needed two years of probation with a 9 month curfew.



I grew up in my teenage years in what seems completely less and ideal circumstances. I could never be alone with myself because of my racing thoughts and feelings. Something I'd later take into my adult life.



During this time of my life, I met A. I was 18, and she was 17. We met through mutual friends. We met on Halloween 2013. We spoke every day, all day. About anything and everything. We fell in love pretty quickly. She was so understanding of me and matched me with the energy I was putting in to the relationship. We hung out a lot. I got my driving licence and first car so this opened up so many opportunities for us both. We started going on holidays together, doing really grown up stuff. I had met my soul mate after all these years. We lived together with her mother for a bit after her mother's boyfriend at the time suddenly died. Were were in our early to mid twenties at this point. Yeah we had our fair share of problems together and argued from time to time but we were happy and always spoke about stuff. We were secure. I was secure. 



We rented our first place together in March 2020, just as the pandemic came about. It meant that we were stuck inside a lot because I worked as a trainee manager in a hospitality job and she worked in elderly care. We shared the space but kept to ourselves most of the time. I opted to play games with J and other friends, while she preferred to watch TV. I had been made redundant from my hospitality job and that meant I needed to pick up some extra work so I jumped on the Amazon bandwagon and starting delivery driving. This made sure the bills were paid on time every month. This took a bit of a strain on the relationship because I was always stressed with work and dealing with long days, while we didn't hang out much. I ended up quitting shortly into the new year of 2021 after I couldn't take the job anymore as they were piling more and more work on me without extra pay etc.



She was working on starting up in the tattooing world and wanted to pursue that as a career. Something I was very supportive of. I picked up another van driving job which was much better on my mental health. We were slowly coming out of the pandemic so she began picking up odd jobs before settling on a tattoo apprenticeship. This put a lot of strain on the relationship as we didn't see eachother as much, but we made sure to put in the work to make time for one another. 

  
I had the fortunate turn of events to be invited back to work at my hospitality job now that the pandemic was dying down so I very much jumped on that straight away and rejoined the team - this time as a salaried full-time manager. We're now up to August 2021. She continued her job tattooing and we were both still under a lot of stress. We decided to give light swinging a go as we were both secure with one another, and she wanted to explore another woman. We started frequenting clubs and experimenting with other people. I had no jealousy, and likewise neither did she. It brought life back to our relationship and we had another year of good fun and laughs.

  
I fucked it up in July of 2022 however. I also fucked things up with my best friend, J. I had kissed J's long term girlfriend after a drunken night which left a longing impact on both mine and J's relationships. I was distraught by my actions. I had never felt the way I did. I was wrong for what I did, and that's on me. It's a mistake I never wanted to make, and never plan to make again. J cut contact rightfully so. A and I continued to make things work as best we could, but we broke up in October/November time of 2022, after 9 years together. We continued to share the same space and live together as neither of us could afford to move out any time soon. We continued this for about 4/5 months. She moved out in February of 2023. 

  
It's very important to know that around this time I was more financially stable, so I purchased a performance car on finance, with a £450/month payment. I also splurged out on money because I had it. I quickly realised that I could not afford both over £1000 on rent and bills, as well as the car, so I opted to look for shared accomodation. Around this time, I had been very depressed and I think I was repressing these feelings and not approaching them head on. I felt lonely. I turned to dating apps and quickly found someone to spend some time with in February. This turned out to be a FWB situation, and I'm still friends with her today and see her often. This did fill my time and helped me with repressing these feelings. We went on road trips and did kinda relationship stuff together like dates and eating out. We had lots of sex, and life felt pretty good. For the first time though, once we had the conversation about what was going on with one another, I couldn't commit. I was not ready to date. This was a new feeling to me that I had not felt, ever. She was understanding, and we continued as things were. I regret doing that as I never wanted to lead her on in the way I did. 

  
I moved out in the March of 2023 to shared accomodation. It was a lot better on my finances, freeing up about £600. I did however have to dip into a scheme from my workplace called Wagestream where I can withdraw up to 40% of my monthly earnings in advance. I needed £800 to pay a deposit. This is extremely important information for later on. I moved into this new place, and began unpacking my new life. I was still paying for my car, alongside the expensive insurance and fuel usage, as well as beginning to modify it as a I was into that sort of thing. I quickly realised that this Wagestream withdrawal meant that that my monthly pay was reduced, thus beginning a snowball. I couldn't control myself and began to spend more and more money. I never missed a bill payment though, ever.

  
I spent the summer of 2023 in my new place, living with someone I barely spent time with. I kept to myself and just played games and worked. I played the new Zelda at the time which I thoroughly enjoyed (I even have two Zelda tattoos!). Money was sparse because of the Wagestream situation but I didn't care at the time. I always had money when I needed so I didn't give it a second though.

  
Around this time I had seen someone called C. Not in the sense of dating, or relationship. She had a nice car and I had pulled in next to her at a Tesco one day and took her Instagram handle and followed her. We had some small talk about cars and left things at that.



The summer drew to an end and I felt like I had the time and ability to look for another relationship. I started seeing a girl who I used to hang out with at the park when I was a teenager and it was great. It was so great to be with someone who fancied me and wanted to spend time together. She invited me over to her house a few times and we would just speak and chat about everthing. She had recently come out of a relationship, so after we had slept together after a party in Oct 2023 she called things off. I had known this girl for about a month, but I was devastated. I cried in front of work colleagues and though my life was over. 

  
Shortly after this I had plucked up the courage to meet with some old car friends and start going out to socialise more often. This is when I realised C was part of this group. I come on hard to her because I was fascinated by her, more and more each day. I'd initiate conversations and we we'd just talk and talk. The weeks went by and it was obvious that we both liked eachother so I pursued this. We spent Christmas at my mother's, and the next day we made things exclusive. It was around this time I learned that she had BPD. I had no idea what this was at the time, but I did my best to understand her and her head. In January of 2024 we had an arguement and she started to withdraw. The hanging out slowed down, the sex slowed down, everything. She was hard to get ahold of and I could barely get a conversation out of her sometimes. The day after Valentine's day she left my place in a huff and this sparked my anxiety. We spent the second half of February arguing and we broke up at the beginning of March. A couple days later she messaged and we started talking again and we kinda got back together but took things slow. I didn't like this and tried to continue as normal. It wasn't until the end of March I made a stupid, silly mistake.

  
After my anxiety got the best of me, I acussed her of cheating on me basically. I had gone through her phone and found nothing, but my head was still telling me that she had. I was a paranoid wreck, and I followed her home one night. She was 'escorted' by friends and they caught me when she wanted to be alone. I cried and cried and tried to explain I just wanted to talk, but the reality is that I wanted to know if she was cheating or seeing someone else. I immediately withdrew.

  
My tenancy on my shared accomodation was up a week before C and I broke up, and I didn't have the money to afford a deposit on another place as I was too fixated thinking that if I threw more money at the relationship it would thrive. I had nothing, barely a penny to my name. I slept in my car for weeks. After two weeks after this incident at the end of March, she messaged me. She forgave me. She saw that my anxiety was sky high and she wanted to work to make things work between us. I went straight back into it with my anxious mind. This is when I started to sit outside her house at night, and watch the house to see if anyone was coming or going. My car is a particularly loud car so she would hear me coming and going, and I told her it wasn't me. I lied to her to cover my own tracks. I would park a street over and walk around to her house so she wouldn't hear me. I would sit on the curbside and watch her house until I knew she was asleep and then sleep in my car, waking up just before she left for work so I didn't see anyone leave. She didn't know I was doing this at the time. My anxiety was sky high that I could not focus on anything but her. I was giving so much into this failing relationship and was oblivious to the red flags, both hers and mine.

  
I started to skip work. I had no money still to afford a deposit on any place. I was unable to think logically and think the right way. I was so absorbed with not losing this person who I had built things with for the past six months that I lost myself. I went a shop to get a vape one day and hoped I would bump into her. I did, and she was there with friends. She lost it and called me a prick and I left. I had heard things from mutual friends that she was going to call the police and have me in trouble for stalking and harrassment, but this did not deter me from harassing and stalking her. I completely lost myself.

  
Around June, I had skipped worked for a few days and this immediately rang alarm bells to my management and other senior management. They offered help, pointing me in the direction of charities that could help hospitality workers find deposit money for places, and they even offered to fund private counselling for me. I took them up on their offer and managed to wrangled enough money for a deposit on a studio flat, somewhat close to work. I gave up on the counselling.

  
I moved into my place on June 19th of this year. I sent my last message to C at this point. She messaged me a bit afterwards and quickly blocked me after I didn't respond. I though this was the time I was going to make better of myself and move on. After a few weeks of wallowing in my self pity and spending my 29th birthday alone, I joined a Discord server looking for friends. I didn't realise that C was a part of it and quickly had me booted. A couple of days later I was called by the police to attend an interview at the station where they had cautioned me for harassing C. I cooperated as I didn't have anything to hide and told the truth. I was issued a caution and had to attend a six week course on partner abuse, to which I completed at the start of September.

  
Here's the kicker. In the middle of July, when I wasn't prepared or looking for anything to be able to get over this crazy relationship, I met JR. We worked together. She is a performing artist at my place of work. I was obsessed with her instantly. She took a bit of warming up to me, but soon realised my intentions of wanting to date.

  
We met up on her birthday, and had coffee. We would text all day and night, and we would hang out more and more often. We had a staff party towards the end of July which is where we kissed for the first time. We started doing everything together. We would go out for drives and get dinners together. We had sex within two weeks of really talking. Two weeks later we made things exclusive and called eachother partners at the start of August. 

  
One day she had explained she was going out with a beer with someone that she used to have sex with after moving to the city. She had previously explained that they are friends and she bumped him off a few times and felt bad so wanted to buy him a beer to say sorry. She TOLD ME that they were nothing but friends. My anxiety started to shoot up. I explained that I felt uncomfortable with this, to which she further iterated that they were friends, and I left it at that. As the weeks of August went by, we still hung out a bunch, she had an operation and I supported her through it all while helping her with every day tasks like cooking. We texted every day all day. We hung out so much and I grew attached so quickly, as did she. At the start of September, we delcared our love for one another. We were so head over heels in this magical love story and we were unseperable.

  
At the end of August, C messaged me. She apologised for the way she had treated me and understood it was because of my anxiety and she should've been a better supporting partner at the time. I never replied to her. Instead I went to see JR and cried in her arms, explaining that C had messaged me. JR was so supportive, only strengthening our bond at the time.

  
JR suffers from chronic loneliness she told me, and has bad anxiety too so she'd often ask me if I was okay with her. I always replied yes. However, around this time I began to snoop on her phone. I looked at conversations between her and this person she told me not to worry about because I was so worried she was cheating on me. I never found anything, ever. But I kept digging, looking for an answer to my own insecurities and doubts and anxiety. I was distant a bit more, but she kept putting in the effort and so did I. It was going great until the last few weeks of September when she started to withdraw somewhat. 

  
October 6th, I blew up a bit after she said she didn't want to hang out the following week. I sent a follow up message to say that I was sorry for how I reacted and went to bed. I woke up to a message from her saying she didn't know if she could give me what I was looking for and needed some time and space. I was distraught. I wanted answers and to talk to her. I wanted to see her and talk to her so bad like she was my next hit of heroin. I should've left her alone, but what did I do? I stalked her.

  
I started to hang out near her house. Watching for when she came home. Watching to see if she brought anyone home with her. Watching her socials like a hawk. Refreshing every social media and checking to see if she was typing a message EVERY minute. I was obsessed and borderline addicted to the rush. I couldn't sit at home because it would allow my thoughts to linger and wander. I was unable to overcome the feelings of wanting to watch what she was doing. I never intended for any harm or any wrong doing, I was just looking for answers. 

  
Which brings me to today. My manager called me into the office and sat me down. Explained that JR had seen me lingering around her house and wanted to question me on some things. It was an uncomfortable conversation. I answered truthfully. I understand that JR isn't coming back, as much as I love her. I'm aware that the behaviours I have been exerting are not right, and that I am unable to control my emotions very well. I miss her so much, and just wanted to be the best person I could, but on reflection I am so broken.

  
Which is why I am here. I want to do better. I am very fucking aware that I have low self esteem. I'm lonely and desperate for that closeness, but somehow I end up fucking it up one way or another. I haven't eaten in a week, and barely slept and I am fucking fed up of feeling this way, but I cannot change myself. I do not know how to. Remember that Wagestream snowball I was in? It's still very fucking much there and I hate it. I can barely afford to live, let alone support a relationship. My anxiety is still sky high and I still am refreshing JR's socials and looking for answers. In hindsight, it was my anxiety and controlling behaviour that pushed her away.

  
NO FUCKING MORE. I want to look after myself, and do what is only best for my own interests and find my own self worth again. I do not want to feel this way anymore because I am one step away from ending it but do not have the balls to do so as much as I want to. I want to run away and never be seen by anyone again. I want to disappear and just ghost this life and leave it behind for something new and better. I have constant thoughts of ending my life, but I know I want to get better. I'm depressed nearly 100% of the time and the only thing that seems to bring me joy and regulation is another person. 

  
I must tell you also that I am in about £20,000 worth of debt. I have defaulted on several things and I ignore all correspondence. I find if I compartmentlise it and chuck it aside, it does not exist. I know it will come and beat me in the ass, but I still cannot find the ability to address it, no matter how hard I try.

  
I'm at my fucking wits end and I cannot find it in myself to do the right thing. I'm scared of my own thoughts, and I don't know what else there is to life anymore. I'm failing at work, starting disciplinary proceedings for missing work again because of my own stupid fucking head, yet I just want to die, but also get better. I can't lose my job, I can't afford to lose my place. I'm stuck and I hate myself more and more every fucking day because of my actions and I can't find a fucking break. 

  
I wish I wasn't this way, but I really do what to end things. Nothing brings me joy, or help, or anything in any way and I hate myself. I fuck up everything I touch and nothing seems to work. I don't even drink or do drugs but maybe life would be better if I did.

  
I want to get better. I want to be able to live a happy life and earn lots of money and do things I've always wanted like drive nice cars, go on holidays, eat expensive food, look good, attract people and just be fucking happy. I'm at the lowest I've ever felt in my life and I just don't know what to do anymore and I need someone to fucking tell me what I need to do step by step. 

  
Lay into me all you want but about this entire story but do not expect me to react. I'm numb and feel nothing. I know I'm scum and a pitiful excuse to society already.",1,1728934721.0,DecidingToBeBetter,0,1.0,False
1g3onpk,https://www.reddit.com/r/StateOfDecay/comments/1g3onpk/question_about_beds/,Question About Beds,"Hi all, just a quick question about beds in SoD1.

TL;DR Is keeping your population down so everyone has a bed worth it compared to other facilities?

I know when you fix up a pre-built sleeping quarters you get 8 beds. You can then build another sleeping quarters facility (which apparently just helps reduce the rate at which your non-played survivors tire out?). Then you can upgrade that extra sleeping quarters into a Bunkhouse, which adds 8 more beds per Bunkhouse, so with a pre-built one you now have 16 beds.

Looking at the actual perks of a Bunkhouse, it only says that you get 10 additional maximum Stamina on all survivors if you have enough beds for everyone to get their own. Is that all this does?

The reason I ask:

Lately, I've been regretting my base layout and thinking of trying to dump one of my facilities for a cooking area to convert some of my extra food into snacks (my survivors can't seem to find anything else on their daily scavenge runs when I log in, so even though I'm breaking down every food rucksack I find while I'm out scavenging, I'm still over capped with Food, and running low on snacks too).

So I was looking at the Bunkhouse and saw it only gave +10 Stamina and thought ""That doesn't sound like much.""

I'm currently in the trucking company if that helps, and it has a built-in sleeping quarters already, so I assume that covers the whole ""Survivors won't tire as quickly"" thing a sleeping area would, so do I need that extra Bunkhouse? Is 10 Stamina really worth it compared to the ability to make my own snacks, coffee, and prepare a meal that gives me more maximum stamina anyway (I have 2 cooks, one of them is my counselor too, and the other is a random NPC I picked up with an enclave that I accepted because they had a researcher for my Library).",1,1728934721.0,StateOfDecay,2,1.0,False

GW: first goal was 150lbs, new goal: 140lbs

I've been waiting to share my story and I think now is as good of time as any since I've met my first goal of 150lbs (down 60lbs since Feb). Never in my entire adult life have I been this weight or even close to it...in fact I've been overweight my entire life.

I started with 18:6 for approx 4 weeks then transitioned to 20:4 mostly with some 24hr, 36hr, 42hr and 48hrs sprinkled in weekly. I've also tried a 68 hr fast in Sept. 

My window is often 12-4pm or 2-6pm. Sometimes I have longer windows on the weekend as I find it harder to stick to around the kids and fun things we plan.

My kids are 5 and 1, my youngest was 7 months old when I started IF. I work from home for our family business and use black coffee and warm water to help curb hunger. I don't restrict any foods but find I naturally eat protein, good fats and veggies/fruits for carbs as opposed to the ultra processed food I used to eat all day long. I still like my desserts and chocolate but have cut way, way back.

I enjoy running and have had some of my best exercises in the fasted state. I hit a personal best of 5km in 32 mins which I was stoked about.

I think I have about 10-20lbs to go but I'm so relaxed in to the process that I know it'll happen eventually. I just bought my first ever bikini and I know I'll be able to wear it by next summer! I look OK in it now but I know I'll wear it with great confidence next summer!

Hey everyone!  First wanted to start out thanking everyone for their opinions, honesty, and community support.  This group is awesome and really pushed me across the line to get started.  Thanks for the inspiration!

I’ve always been a bigger guy for my size, I’m 5’10” with broad shoulders so being heavier than I should just looked like I was bulked up, but I felt otherwise.  Always self conscious, depressed over that fact when I shouldn’t be.  Can’t help it!!!  I love to work out, lifting weights, playing sports, going for walks…whatever.  I used to be able to lose 10-15 lbs if I worked out like crazy and had a strict diet…..never lasted and it would always come back.  Over the last few years I’ve really made an effort to have scheduled gym days, being consistent, and the scale kept going up.  Now let me say I added a ton of muscle, but I have fatty midsection and upper body that just never changes, or it gets bigger.  How defeating. 

Also I hear the food noise, I never knew what that was.  I just always thought I was hungry.  Or man this food tastes great, I need to keep eating until I’m stuffed.  I didn’t realize I had a problem.

So I talked to my PCP about my weight/BMI which after bloodwork was the only concern besides a slightly elevated cholesterol.  I knew I wanted to be on Zep but was skeptical before I found you guys and gals! Plus they kept telling me if insurance didn’t cover it, which was unlikely, that it would be crazy expensive.  So knowing I couldn’t afford it I opted for phentermine to try and boost health journey.  After a month, I couldn’t do it anymore.  I like caffeine like the next person, but holy crap I felt like I drank 20 coffees at once, have anxiety from that, and then would crash in the afternoon.  So hesitantly I asked about it Zep again, she told me to call my insurance and find out if it was covered.  Well it is!! With a copay but hot damn I don’t care it’s incredibly cheaper than they made it seem, WINNING 😄

I just took my 3rd dose of 2.5, I’m down like 6 lbs to start on Zep.  Nothing crazy like some of what I’ve read but…. I feel great, I feel like I can do it, I feel like there’s a light at the end of the tunnel.  I hear the food noise a lot LESS!  I get full faster and I’m relieved.  Combined with my exercise routines and healthier eating style that I started a couple years ago I’m really confident I can have the body and lifestyle that my mind thinks I should already have!

Is it weird that I’m already looking forward to shot day next week?  After that I’m titrating up to 5 mg!

The thing is, I hate the kind of person I am. I'm very angry, conflicted, I literally have no kindness and love and nothing light in me. People shy away from me and because of that I have literally no one around me. I have no friends or even acquaintances that I can have a cup of coffee with. I quit my job, which I hate, and they won't take me anywhere else, and I don't have the energy to look. I've never had a healthy relationship, no one has ever loved me, I have no friends who love me and ask me how my day went. I have parents, but they don't give a fuck about me. They only tell me to take pills, but they don't want to ask me what's on my mind.

To be clear the brownie was in my bag all wrapped up, not left out unattended. I’m unsure as to how long the brownie had been out of my bag and under my coffee table for but during the morning he seemed absolutely fine.  Then after looking away for 5 minutes as both my kittens were playing I noticed the smaller one start to limp and drag his legs, not only that his head was wobbling and his eyes couldn’t focus. He became skittish as if I was a stranger to him. He ran away from me to hide but could barely run. I called my partner to come home so we could take him to the vets and then I noticed the wrapped up brownie uncovered beneath the coffee table. 
After the full assessment with the vet she confirmed they would be okay. We asked if the chocolate could be the reason for his stumbling but she didn’t give us a definitive answer. When we got home we gave him his activated charcoal and his symptoms started to go away. I’ve googled the similar symptoms but nothing seems to indicate chocolate intake. All of this happened within 2 hours and today he’s back to walking completely fine.

All the women that I come across at my workplace are much older than me. I am an introvert so I don't enjoy going to pubs and parties.

I can't wait fantasizing that a random women will fall in love with me in a coffee shop like in ""Meet Joe Black"". So dating apps are my only option. Coming from a Hindu culture (You can say that in Hindu culture we don't have a concept of dating but I am just desperate to experience love. Maybe I should just wait a couple of years more and my parents will find me a match), I am neither interested in hookups nor short term stuff. I am looking for serious long-term relation. I had almost 60 matches (Finnish and Estonian women mostly) on Tinder, out of them \~10 replied and one acted as if genuinely interested. She gave me her insta and we were talking since past two weeks. The conversation was smooth, she used to me msg everyday by herself, send pics of the desserts she made, things she was doing etc. She said she like Indian and middle eastern cuisine and we planned a date tomorrow at an Indian restaurant. Today, for no reason, she blocked me everywhere giving me no reason. I invested a lot of time and connected with her emotionally because of the way she projected herself. On top of it, may be her friends, made some fake accounts and sending me messages to play with my emotions more. I blocked them all but it still hurts.

The air was thick with anticipation as I arrived in Bangalore, ready for a reunion trip with my college friends. The vibrant city felt alive, bustling with energy as I navigated through the streets. Mitali’s upcoming wedding was the perfect excuse for us to gather once more, and this time we were headed to Coorg.

After months of planning, the excitement bubbled over as we all gathered at a central spot before hitting the road. Mitali and Raj, who had started dating after college ended, were the most enthusiastic. Their love story had been a delightful surprise to all of us, and now we were looking forward to celebrating Mitali’s impending nuptials.

“Are you ready for the wedding, bride-to-be?” I teased, giving her a playful nudge.

“Only if you promise not to embarrass me in front of Raj’s family,” Mitali shot back, her smile wide.

“Me? Embarrass you? Never!” I replied with mock innocence.

As the last of us arrived, we piled into a rented SUV, our laughter filling the vehicle as we set off toward the rolling hills of Coorg. The scenery transformed rapidly as we drove, the city giving way to lush green landscapes dotted with coffee plantations and majestic hills.

The journey was filled with friendly banter, each of us sharing stories from our college days, reliving our most ridiculous moments. Tara turned up the music, and soon we were singing along to old favorites, our voices harmonizing and clashing in a delightful cacophony.

After a few hours of driving, we finally reached our destination. Coorg was stunning. The hills rolled endlessly, covered in dense forests and sprawling coffee estates. The aroma of fresh coffee wafted through the air, mingling with the cool breeze. We checked into a charming homestay, our cozy retreat nestled between sprawling plantations.

The first day was filled with exploration. We visited the famous Abbey Falls, where the water cascaded down rocks, creating a symphony of sound that soothed our souls. We took photos, striking goofy poses, capturing moments we would cherish forever. The sun dipped below the horizon as we returned to the homestay, and a warm dinner awaited us, filling our bellies and spirits.

As night fell, we gathered around a fire pit outside, roasting marshmallows over the flames. The stars twinkled above, a dazzling blanket spread across the sky. Mitali leaned against Raj, her happiness radiating like the firelight. “You guys, can you believe I’m getting married?” she asked, her voice a mixture of excitement and disbelief.

“I can hardly believe you’re getting married before me!” Tara joked, throwing a playful glance at Karan. “You better step up your game, Karan.”

“Hey! I’m not the one who’s engaged!” Karan replied, throwing his hands up in mock surrender, laughter erupting from all of us.

As we sat there, the warmth of friendship enveloped us, and I felt a sense of peace wash over me. Everything was perfect.

The next day, we planned to visit a nearby temple, a famous attraction in the area. As we drove through winding mountain roads, the scenery shifted to dense forests, the trees towering above us. The sunlight filtered through the leaves, creating patterns of light and shadow on the ground. We chatted excitedly about the wedding plans and our favorite moments from college.

After exploring the temple, we drove further into the mountains, taking in the breathtaking views. But as we ventured deeper, the road became narrow and winding, surrounded by dense trees that loomed ominously. The air grew cooler, a noticeable chill creeping in as we rolled down the windows.

“Why is it getting so cold all of a sudden?” Mitali asked, rubbing her arms.

“Maybe the mountains are just reminding us who’s boss,” Raj replied, grinning. “But it’s good weather for a wedding, right?”

I laughed, but there was something unsettling about the silence that enveloped us. The chirping of crickets and the rustling of leaves faded, leaving an eerie stillness in its place. I glanced out the window, the shadows of the trees thickening as we continued our drive.

Suddenly, without warning, an old man stepped into the road, causing Raj to slam on the brakes. My heart raced as I took in the sight: a Caucasian man in a flowing white kurta pajama, his long, snow-white hair falling past his shoulders. He held a flashlight that cut through the darkness, the beam illuminating his weathered face.

“What the hell?” Karan exclaimed, gripping the edge of his seat.

The man stood in the middle of the road, eyes wide and wild. “You shouldn’t be here! Turn back!” His voice was raspy, filled with urgency.

“Should we call the police or something?” Tara suggested, her voice laced with concern.

“He’s probably just lost or mentally ill,” Mitali whispered, her eyes darting to the rearview mirror. “Let’s just go.”

Raj hesitated for a moment, but I felt a growing sense of dread. The forest felt too quiet, the air thick with an unshakeable tension. We needed to move. “Let’s go,” I urged.

Raj revved the engine, and we sped past the man, who stood in the middle of the road, his flashlight flickering as we left him behind. My heart raced, but I tried to shake off the feeling of unease creeping over me. “Did you guys get a weird vibe from him?” I asked, looking around at the others.

“Definitely,” Radha said, her voice low. “That was unsettling.”

We drove further, the darkness swallowing the road as the trees loomed closer. But soon, the unsettling atmosphere shifted again, the chill intensifying as we approached a clearing. Suddenly, we came upon a ruin of a Hindu temple, the crumbling stones illuminated by the dim moonlight.

“Oh my God,” I whispered, a chill racing down my spine.

“It looks just like the temple in Gokarna, but... older,” Mitali breathed, her eyes wide with fear.

The temple, though in ruins, was hauntingly beautiful. Vines snaked around the stones, and the air felt heavy with history. But there was something else—an aura of sadness and despair that seemed to cling to the crumbling walls. The faint outline of ancient carvings decorated the stone, but the details had faded with time, lost to the ravages of nature.

We didn’t stop the car. There was an unspoken agreement that we should keep moving, and I felt my pulse quicken as we drove past the temple. The silence was suffocating, pressing down on us like a weight. The cold seemed to seep into the vehicle, and I wrapped my arms around myself, shivering despite the warmth of the SUV.

“Did you guys see that?” Tara finally broke the silence, her voice barely above a whisper. “It felt... wrong.”

“Yeah, I felt it too,” I admitted, my heart racing. “That temple—it was like something was watching us.”

Raj accelerated, eager to put distance between us and the ruins. As we drove, the darkness outside seemed to close in, the road winding tighter around the hills. The trees blurred together, shadows flickering at the edges of our vision.

“Let’s just get back to the homestay,” Mitali said, her voice shaking slightly. “We’ll forget about this.”

But as we drove, the feeling of dread clung to us. The cold grew more intense, and the silence outside was unnerving. I glanced back at the road behind us, half-expecting to see the old man or some other ominous figure lurking in the darkness.

Finally, we arrived at the homestay, the warm glow of lights spilling from the windows, but the sense of unease lingered. We piled out of the SUV, laughter and chatter trying to mask the tension in the air.

“Let’s just have a drink and relax,” Karan suggested, trying to lighten the mood. We settled around a table, the warmth of the fire and the taste of whiskey helping to ease the anxiety that had settled in our bones.

But as the night wore on, the images of the temple and the old man haunted me. I could feel the cold wrapping around my thoughts, whispering doubts and fears. I glanced at Mitali and Raj, who seemed lost in their own world, oblivious to the lingering shadows.

At midnight, I stepped outside for a breath of fresh air, the chill biting at my skin. The stars sparkled overhead, but the night felt heavier than before. As I stood there, I couldn’t shake the feeling that we had stirred something that should have remained undisturbed.

I took a deep breath and decided to head back inside, the warmth of the homestay calling me. As I rejoined the group, we shared nervous laughter, trying to push aside the events of the day.

“Let’s make a pact,” Tara said, raising her glass. “No more forests for us!”

We all nodded in agreement, but I could sense a lingering hesitation in the air. The thought of returning to the forest felt daunting, the memories of that chilling encounter lingering in our minds. 

As we settled in for the night, I glanced out the window toward the dark trees, shadows dancing in the moonlight. The forest stood silent and still, hiding secrets that felt too dangerous to uncover. 

[We had made it through the trip safely, but the unease remained. In that moment, I knew we would never look at forests the same way again.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/JhLWS3lLBF)",2,1728933916.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

We became friends in grade eight or nine. In a way you were the only one who genuinely cared about me when everyone else was abusing me almost daily to copy my homework. Yes she also wanted to copy my homework but she didn't just treat me like a homework dispenser.

Chatting and spending time with her was something I always enjoyed.
Typically you would come to me with something either mundane or something that was bothering you or something you wanted my help with and I'd always try my best to be there for her and she knew very well how much I was there for her.
At some point she didn't go to the same classes as me anymore and at some point she had to change schools and we would still chat and stay friends.

Lol, at some point she called me a friend for life.

But at some point she kept reaching out less. I never wanted to make her uncomfortable but I was probably to clingy and I lost my ease of being around by trying to get you to see that I would like to keep chatting with her such that we would stay in touch.
In 2018 we only had very little contact but she was on my mind constantly because I was used to chatting with her daily.
I sent her a stupid video of me crying and confessing I loved her. 
I think it had a core truth that yes I cared deeply about her for years but we hadn't seen each other in a year and so her response was basically: you don't love me and you made me very uncomfortable.
A month later we basically agreed there was nothing I could say or do to make things right between us. This was January 2019.

I'm very sorry for how I made her uncomfortable by my actions.
I reached out to her in July three months ago, she said she wanted to meet for a coffee.
Well we didn't, I should have stopped myself from trying to reach out to her again and again.
I was blinded by my own emotions and memories of the past that I didn't see how much I bothered her.
To the point where she blocked me and when I asked her on a different platform I offered her distance which she wanted.

I don't know if my wishing her well will be the last time, we ever spoke. I would hope not but still I'm sorry for all the times I made her uncomfortable.",1,1728933871.0,lostafriend,0,1.0,False

In college I took woodworking classes and built furniture like end tables and coffee tables. I had to step away from woodworking because it was an expensive hobby and I couldn’t justify the cost at the time. I just bought a house so now I can finally justify spending money on classes and materials for woodworking again because its for my forever home.

I thought a good place to start would be cabinet making. I’ve found two local classes, both of which cover different approaches to cabinet construction, and I’d love some advice from folks who have experience with these techniques.

**Class 1: Beginner/Intermediate: Introduction to Cabinet Making with Kreg Systems**

* Focus: This class is all about using the Kreg pocket hole and cutting systems to build a basic cabinet carcass from plywood, with a solid wood face frame. We’ll also install a door and drawer with hardware on the second day.
* Tools: table saw, planer, jointer, and router table.

**Class 2: Four Step Cabinet Making**

* Focus: This class goes into traditional woodworking techniques, including dovetailing, with more emphasis on making durable drawers and doors. We’ll also work on a cabinet carcass and use a mix of hand and power tools.
* Tools: jointer, planer, table saw, chop saw, hand planes, and router table.

My goal is to pick up some new techniques and rekindle my passion for woodworking. Any insights from those who have experience with these methods or tools would be much appreciated! Thanks in advance for the advice!",1,1728933865.0,woodworking,1,1.0,False

2.5 months ago i had a big pain in my chest and i was thinking about some stomach problem. Then the pain came to just under my hearth and ribs i couldnt fight with and head to er. They run test and find 5400 lipase with sludge in gallbladder. They offer me gallbladder removal but I refused because my wife 7 months pregnant. Also I wasn't sure I asked them are you sure gallbladder is the problem they said suspect is gallbladder, now you dont have and infection we can do it. But it doesnt make sense to me and I sign the papers I left to ER. When I arrived home doctor call me from my phone he said we run your blood test again, labs was wrong my lipase is 540 which is nice and no need surgery strick with diet. I said okey and sleep well ( i went to hospital 9 pm and came home 6 am). I woke up around 1 pm and i check my chart app and i saw my lipase tedt result change again ( they run another test with same blood) and it is final result 7400 lipase. I call ER they said please come back here immeadilately. I went there another test and result was 700ish. 2 weeks with pain I couldnt eat anything and I call gastroentrology they said nothing to do with us, call GI for galbladder removal. I call surgery doctor we did a visit he explain me. Then couple days later I had another big pain i couldnt sleep sweating all night next day i went to ER again. They run tests and now my AST ALT  was over 1500 and lipase 746. Also they check my gallbladder they said it is look like normal no inflamation some small stones (ct scan and ultrasound). They said might be some sludge on common bile or stone need ercp mrcp test. And this time I said yes for surgery and everythung and they sent me another hospital same night. I was waiting they going to do me some ercp or mrcp to me but then my surgery doctor came and said no need ercp they gonna remove my gallbladder and FL scan after that. And after the surgery they said my common bile clear. Doctor did not give me any diet and said eat whatever you want. I was shocking and I didnt eat first day. Couple days later i start to eat 3 months ago like fatty foods. Then my all pain come back and end it up in ER. They run blood test again everything was normal except lipase. It was 1470 this time. Same recommendation stay clear liquid . It was 15 days ago and i still have pain. And i fight all this pain without any pain drug from begining. Still 20 opioid sitting on bag. From the begining it wasnt gallbladder it was pancreas. I read a lot and now i am scarred. Because now it is 2.5 months past with this high lipase levels, still pain happening and last time luckly they sent me to mri and they saw some fatty psrt of my pacreas has infection. All ducts are clear biles are ok. But 2.5 months it is too much and make me nervous. Am I eveluated to CP now ? Because still pain in my chest under ribs.i didnt eat anything last 3 days only 1 cup coffee per day and 2 cup apple juice. This night i ate half bread (homemade no oil no sugar inside kind of lavash or pita-naan) and i have big pain in my chest and i cant sleep now 4 am.

I want to talk about my problem. I am a typical 15 year old teenager who goes to school. On Friday and Monday we have classes until 15:00, and on other days until 16:00, sometimes electives until 17:00. So, for a person with IBS it is hell. I started taking the pills 3 weeks ago? and I have been on the diet for 1.5 weeks, I think. I am on the Fodmap diet. Everything seems to be fine and I am very happy about it, because last year I had THE SAME PROBLEM. Only it was worse. Now I am trying to change my thinking and find the positive in everything, which has a good effect on both my physical and mental health. I do not have a specific diagnosis, but 3 doctors already suggest that I have IBS. Today I went to school and I started having gas. The situation is that I have gas and I hold it in, sometimes even for 2-3 hours. And when I am at home and I think, here it is!! now I will go to the toilet and do my business. and what do you think? NOTHING. because of this, it is difficult for me to attend classes, my attendance is 92%. it is difficult for me to go on trips (for example, 4 hours or more), it is difficult to go to the cinema, it is difficult to just live a full life. my condition has improved in the last week, but today I had gases again, I do not understand why. although last week, everything was +/- normal. I ate a sweet potato, a piece of chocolate and noodles with GARLIC, it turns out today. I am checking what products I react to, but I found out one thing for sure, gluten, lactose and ... drum roll!!!! COFFEE. My intestines cannot tolerate it.

* DF64 Gen 2
* Bambino plus
* 20g IMS basket
* WDT
* Normcore metered tamper

Extraction: 20g in 40g out 40s time

Puck prep

* grinder turned off add 20g beans
* invert cup with ground into portafilter with funnel
* WDT in concentric circles then vertically and horizontally
* spin distributor to level
* double tamp without polishing

I’m keeping the settings as consistent as possible for each run but I’m getting different results each time.

From the spraying at the end I know I need to grind finer. But the previous shot before this one pulled without spraying (same settings).

Flavor is good, a bit of bitterness but full body and strength.

Beans are roasted only 3 days ago, will CO2 from off gassing impact the channeling that much?

DF 64 is brand new, maybe 1/2 pound in beans run through it from dialing in.

Getting pooling even with the right amount of coffee (any more will touch the group head)

Maybe a burr alignment is necessary?

So I can’t tolerate coffee but it’s not the caffeine that bothers me it’s something to do with the actual bean (I think). I’ve tried to get into coffee multiple times in my life and every time it results in me hunched over the toilet bowl vomiting my life out. I used to assume it was some sort of caffeine sensitivity but it just isn’t. I got into Monster energy and even pre-workout that could have like 250mg+ of caffeine and it doesn’t bother me it just wakes me up. But everything about coffee makes me gag. 


I’ve been searching for an alternative source of caffeine that won’t shave 10 years off my life. I’ve also done something I know is very bad; to be blunt I’ve used paracetemol/caffeine soluble tablets in the morning purely for the caffeine… 


So I do some light research and hear about Green Tea. It’s meant to have moderate amount of caffeine and some L-theanine, which I basically assumed is a placebo. Well I’ve certainly been proved wrong


Last night i had 2 cups at about 9pm and found it difficult to sleep -too awake to do so, which was strange. Then this morning I woke up, it’s Monday, I feel like shit as usual and I have a pain in my arms from the gym so I took 2 paracetemol/caffeine tablets (120mg caffeine) and then I had 1 cup of green tea with 2 bags in it (something i have never done before in the morning before work.) so that’s maybe 3 cups in a 12 hour period. (Pretty dumb probably)


So I get up and shower and everything and i leave to head to work - a 15 minute drive and I notice at the start of the drive that i feel very alert and awake, and I think “wow maybe i am onto something here!”, I feel focused and pretty good. Well on the 15 minute drive to work that feeling increased and increased until i was basically on the edge of a panic attack in traffic and felt kind of weak and hollow. So I’m a bit freaked out now but i get into work and i feel so strange like I’m at the start of an acid trip mixed with the tail end of an amphetamine trip. It felt supremely unpleasant but there would be times where it felt kind of nice too and it waxed and waned ALL DAY?! 


Because i was so anxious and wanted to distract myself i threw myself at my work and damn i was more productive in the first 2 hours of the day then maybe the last 3 days - so yeah if green tea is meant to help you focus it definitely did that -but not in the pleasant focus, this was somewhat frightening and unpleasant. 


I left work at 6pm and WTF WHY am I STILL “high”? It’s not jittery it’s sort of dissociative actually, and its mellowed out some after i drank some chamomile tea when i got home.

So obviously i fucked up here and i will be more careful but could this actually be caused by just L-theanine??",0,1728933616.0,NooTopics,1,0.5,False

They are always in need of basic necessities and often times it is not for lack of caring, but what and how to donate.

You can visit shelter websites for any specific donations they need, or you can donate something you think of yourself.  One of the easiest ways to find items is on Amazon.  If you search for Homeless supplies they will bring up tons of options and all are very reasonably priced.  The best part of all this, you can have the items shipped directly to the shelter!!  

Whether it is gloves, hats, socks, underwear, toiletries, food, blankets, scarfs, rain gear, anything you think someone could use.  You can even include snacks, coffee, hot chocolate, even toys for children, or what ever.

Please remember those who have little to nothing when gift shopping for friends and family and Amazon makes it easy.  Getting a needed gift during the holiday season helps people feel included and less alone.  It does not matter the size of the donation, even 1 pair of gloves or 1 hat will go to someone who does not have one.  It does not matter if all you can spend is $5.  The item does not even need to be wrapped.  

I could not find a website that included statewide shelter lists so I have put a link for WMUR that has a decent list of shelters.

As I said last week, I've been a part of bad teams, and you know you're bad, and you practice bad, and you go play bad. I've seen that, been a part of it. I've been a part of teams where you just know you're better. You practice at a really high level, and you go out and you play just like you practice. T\****his is the first place I've been around where we practice at a very high level and then don't come close to playing anywhere near that. So I'm asking myself are we practicing the right way? Things like that. Are drills transferable? Are practice sessions transferable? Is the messaging transferable? Obviously, no, because we're not getting the results that we want, and we're not putting our players in a position to where they can do what they do in practice on the field on Saturday.*** *I think that's the easiest way to explain it.""*

Asked about conversations with coordinators about change:

*""You hire people that you believe have the same values as you, and I believe both of my coordinators do. They're both problem solvers. That's one of the things I look for. They have actively worked on problem solving. They're frustrated too because they feel as if they keep trying to address the problem, trying to make the corrections, doing what they have in their tool belt to fix what is plaguing us. I think they're like I am, OK, then help me grow and find better ways to do it because obviously our ways are not working. I think we're all in this growth mindset that we're willing to change in any way we need to change to help our players be more successful on Saturday. That's really what this comes down to, taking all agendas aside. Our job, as I've defined it in this building, is to help them reach their potential.* ***We're seeing growth off the field, but we're not seeing that growth on the field. Therefore, we need to change our ways of how to try to pull that out of them on gameday so they, as Coach Saban said, and I think he said it brilliantly, is to create value for themselves. They have to understand that we want them to create value for themselvs, not just NIL value but value as people, value as players.****""*

Have the people you talk to that have told you you're doing things the right way given you ideas to change practices?

""*Yeah, and I'm wrestling with a couple of things* ... (the rest of the answer was totally unrelated to the actual question).""

Seems like in games something bad happens early and that sets the tone. Is that accurate?

*""It's incredibly accurate. It's the thing that hurts my soul as much as anything. One of our core values is life-bringing energy, and I think that's been lost. And that's my fault.

I am passionate to a fault sometimes, but I find myself on the sideline ... (talking about TV copy of game) About six times during the game, they show me randomly. I can't hear what they're saying. They just show me randomly. I watch myself, and I'm like, 'That's not me.' I look academic. Trust me,  I'm not real academic. Where's my passion? Where's my enthusiasm? Where's my fight? Internally, I'm doing that. There's times that I'm trying to do that, but I own the fact that I haven't been the best version of me on the sideline from an energy standpoint either. That's just another self-growth that I need to look at and say maybe they're feeding off my lack of passion, my lack of intensity.****""*

I work mostly in Central Java though i have friends all over the country. I have a passion project in a small village that traditionally farms cash crops  like tobacco and veggies for their own use. We are trying to reforest the area as it has basically been gutted. Though, coffee is not the best option for bringing back native species it is a good start in the right direction. The farmers needed a way to still live off the land but also reverse some of the negative affects that generations of commercial farming has brought about. I will probably write a much longer post about this in greater detail should anyone be interested.  My main question now is; if I sent some coffee to the states from some of these farmers who would be interested in buying? Just a shot in the dark. I can offload it locally but the local population (not all) has a hard time seeing the value in such things. I will not see any of this money as it will go back into the village to keep growing their operation.

# 10.1 刘团长的死讯 News of Liu’s Death

二零一一年五月，我到高德联合公司（Golder Associates Inc.）的实验室工作。高德是家上市了的国际性岩土工程公司。我只在实验室里工作，不下工地，接触的人少。

In May 2011, I went to work in the laboratory of Golder Associates Inc. Golder is a publicly traded international geotechnical engineering firm. I only worked in the lab, not went to the job site, had little contact with people.

实验室的经理玛丽的名字很长，我不能拼读。在面试我时，她同意我称呼她玛丽（Mary）。她来自一个我不知道在哪里的国家。她再次解释；我还是想不出来，就不好意思再问了。工作一段时间后，我发现人们称呼她玛丽亚、罗密欧什么的，再次问应该怎么称呼她。她回答她的生活里就这样，不同的人叫她不同的名字，习惯了。我常观察她，她是个标准健壮的欧洲血统白人，行为端庄得体，传统西方人的世界观，性格不紧不慢，没有地方口音，没有民族和地域的特质；我分析不出她来自何方。

The lab manager, Mary, had a long name that I couldn't spell. When I was interviewed, she agreed to let me call her Mary. She was from a country I didn't know where. She explained again; I still couldn't figure it out, so I was too embarrassed to ask again. After working for a while, I realized that people called her Maria, Mario, or whatever, and again asked what I should call her. She replied that that was how it was in her life; different people called her different names and got used to it. I often observe her. She is a standard, strong white woman of European descent. She behaves in a dignified and proper manner, has a traditional Western worldview, a leisurely personality, no local accent, and no ethnic or regional characteristics. I cannot analyze where she is from.

开始的两个月还好，可工作中，我又接触到了达弗罗克（Davroc）和大佛印（Dufferin）公司的人和业务，渐渐的我的觉思失调症又成长起来了。我和同事之间有了矛盾，对黑社会的担心越来越重。刘健君研究灵魂转世，雇佣黑社会的人，黑社会的人办事不成，丢了面子，或者什么人矜持不住了，就可能出现谋杀事件。

The first two months were fine, but at work, I met people and business from Davroc and Dufferin, and gradually my schizophrenia worsened. I had conflicts with my colleagues, and I became more and more worried about the black society. Eve Liu studied soul reincarnation and hired black society people. If those mafias failed to get tasks done, lost face, or someone lost their composure, there might be murders.

一天的喝咖啡休息时间，听同事们在唠嗑。事后，不知为什么，我回忆起了玛丽讲她开会时看的录像。

One day during a coffee break, I listened to my colleagues chatting. Afterwards, for some reason, I recalled Mary's talk about the video she watched in the meeting.

刘健君回答桫椤派去调查我的人：“卢岩心理的社会环境和别人不一样。他念研究生的时候，他同屋那个人是我爸爸安排的。他们就一起骗他；他就信了。” 

Eve Liu answered the person sent by Sal Fasullo to investigate me: ""Luyan's psychological social environment is different from others. When he was a graduate student, the person he shared a room with was arranged by my father. They lied to him together; he believed it.""

调查的人问：“现在你爸爸在哪儿？”

刘健君回答：“死了！我爸爸做的事儿与我没有关系。那时我不在国内，我在美国读博士呢！”

调查的人问：“那你为什么不告诉卢岩？”

The investigator asked, ""Where is your father now?""

Eve Liu replied, ""Dead! What my father did has nothing to do with me. I was not in China at that time, I was in the United States studying for my doctorate!""

The investigator asked, ""Then why didn't you tell Luyan?""

刘健君回答：“我爸说，卢岩很犟。他不亲眼看见，谁告诉他，他都不信，就只能是别人在他旁边唠嗑，或者路上的人唠嗑，他听见了，就想。一点儿点儿地，他想明白了，就没事儿了。” 

Eve Liu replied, ""My dad said that Luyan was very stubborn. If he didn't see it with his own eyes, he wouldn't believe anyone who told him, so he could only think about it when others chattered next to him or people on the road chattered, and he heard it. Little by little, he figured it out, and then he was fine.""

调查的人问：“你爸爸想让卢岩干什么？”

刘健君回答：“他说我这辈子命运中没有丈夫，除了卢岩，别人都不行。说我不是他的女儿，卢岩是他的儿子。他就想让我和卢岩结婚。我爸说，看不见我和卢岩结婚，他死不瞑目。你看，我不迷信，不信这个。”

The investigator asked, ""What did your father want Luyan to do?""

Eve Liu replied, ""He said that I had no husband in my life, and that no one else would do except Luyan. He said that I am not his daughter and Luyan is his son. He then wanted me to marry Luyan. My dad said he can't see me marry Luyan, he dies with eyes open. You see! I am not superstitious and don't believe in this.""

我回忆起来玛丽亚所说的话之后，感觉奇怪：如果这是我以前想过的事，想象与现实混淆了，那不应该有我根本不知道的事。我回忆起了本书[第2章中《桃花劫》](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeTree/comments/1f7ssof/21_桃花劫之一_peach_flower_catastrophe_1/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)的故事，是我妈妈给我讲的。她不记得 “前世姻缘，命中注定” 这八个字了。那玛丽亚说的这八个字是从哪里来的（注2）！？而且玛丽说的是英语，她的用词和我英语用词的习惯根本不一样。我回忆、分析刘团长已经五、六年没对我做过什么了，认为他真的已经过世了。

After I recalled what Marry said, felt strange: If this was something I had thought about before, and imagination was confused with reality, then there shouldn't be something I didn't know. I recalled the [story of ""Peach Flower Catastrophe"" in Chapter 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeTree/comments/1f7ssof/21_桃花劫之一_peach_flower_catastrophe_1/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) of this book, which my mother told me. She didn't remember the eight words “Former Generation’s Marriage Factors, Predetermining Fate”. So where did Mary's eight words come from (Note 2)!? And Mary spoke English, her word usage was completely different from my English verbal habits. I recalled and analyzed that Troupe Leader Liu had not done anything to me for five or six years, thought he was dead.

注10.1-2，环境形成后，相关的语言就会出现。在前文第2章，我两岁时听这样的词当然不理解，记忆也很少，但这时有了相关的环境，这词就冒出来了。

Note 10.1-2, after the environment is formed, the related language will appear. In the previous chapter 2, when I was two years old, I didn’t understand such words and I had very little memory, but now there is a related environment, so the words pop up.

我认为刘团长真的早就过世了，心情很不好，两三天里像似病了一样。我怀疑刘健君收买了我的妻子，并委托人照顾我的孩子，我总发现他们在变化。

I thought that Troupe Leader Liu had really passed away a long time ago. I was in a very bad mood and seemed to be sick for two or three days. I suspected that Eve Liu bribed my wife and entrusted someone to take care of my children. I always found that they were changing.

As of today, I am 33 weeks. This is my fifth pregnancy (with two previous babies delivered at 34 weeks each time because of pre-e, and two miscarriages). This time, my team has already let me know that we'll be delivering between 34 and 37 weeks due to blood pressure concerns. While my body and I have never gotten on, it's at least pretty good at telling me when something is wrong. That's why, for the first two trimesters, I actually had what I would consider a very easy pregnancy despite being medicated through the roof for my blood pressure, among other things.

I am under Maternal Fetal Medicine care and, frankly, my MFM doctors have been awesome. They listen when I tell them something is wrong, they respond appropriately, and they've been cautious without being ridiculous. But I have been sent to triage probably fifteen times in the past month and a half for blood pressure (and admitted twice). Love my MFM doctors. Triage? Hit and miss, with a strong emphasis on miss. They take one look at my chart, see that I've been there many times, and do whatever they need to to scoot me out the door.

Since Friday, I've been experiencing a very intense, disturbing symptom that I remember from both of my run-ins with pre-e before. It's an intense feeling of physical agitation -- kind of like if you might drink four pots of coffee and combine that with restless legs syndrome, except all over my body -- combined with a strong feeling of annoyance and irritation for no reason. It comes and goes, but it's very disturbing, since I am an extremely chill person.

This morning, I woke up feeling that from head to toe. I went downstairs, sat for a while with a drink to try and chill out, and when it didn't subside, I took my blood pressure to discover a very lovely 164/88. Called the doctor, they sent me to triage, told them what all had been going on and... was given tylenol to treat a headache and sent home after they took a single blood pressure.

Something isn't right and I'm well aware of it. I do have an appointment with MFM tomorrow morning and I'm damn sure my doctors will listen to me there, but... yeesh. Stop bringing me in if you're not going to do anything! Argh!

And for bonus points, they want my husband to drive me every time, which means he loses time at work every time too. I'm also working, but it's ridiculous that two people have to stop work to take me in to be given two Tylenol.",1,1728933193.0,PlusSizePregnancy,0,1.0,False

1g3nr81,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/1g3nr81/bosses_at_jobs_i_cant/,Bosses At Jobs? I Can't,"Bosses at jobs, huh? Can't even begin to understand the kind of twisted, power-hungry monsters that some of these so-called ""leaders"" turn out to be. It's like they were all picked on in high school, and now they've got their own little kingdom to rule with an iron fist. They strut around the office or factory floor like peacocks, pecking at anyone who dares to question their ""wisdom."" And let's not even get started on how they treat their employees—like disposable pawns in their corporate chess game.



You've got these fresh-faced interns or new hires, full of hope and enthusiasm, ready to contribute to the company, and what do they get? A verbal beatdown from the boss who's still trying to relive their glory days of... what? Being the hall monitor? The office tyrant who thinks a promotion means they can treat people like crap. It's like watching a sad, twisted reality show where the prize is a lifetime of bitterness and resentment.



And it doesn't matter if you've put in 20 years of blood, sweat, and tears for the company. Oh no, not at all. You could be the most loyal, hardworking, and dedicated employee, but if the mood swings the wrong way, you're on the chopping block. It's like bosses have some kind of sick pleasure in watching their employees squirm and beg for approval. They're the kings and queens of their own little fiefdom, and everyone else is just a peasant to be used and discarded.



But what takes the cake, what really sends me over the edge, is when these heartless oafs refuse to prioritize safety. Take, for instance, the boss at Impact Plastics Gerald O'Connor in Tennessee during Hurricane Helene. What kind of sociopath keeps their workers on site during a natural disaster? It's not enough that Mother Nature is throwing her worst at you; you've got to deal with a human tornado in a suit telling you to stay put because productivity trumps your life. This isn't just bad management; it's criminal negligence!



These bosses are like the kid who never got picked for the basketball team, so now they're the coach who benches the star player for not fetching them coffee fast enough. It's sickening how they abuse their power, especially in a situation where people are desperately trying to survive. The company's bottom line isn't worth a single human life, but apparently, that memo got lost in the corporate shuffle.



And don't get me started on the office politics. Backstabbers and brown-nosers get promoted while the actual hard workers are stuck in the trenches, getting the metaphorical shit thrown at them. It's like watching a game of corporate Hunger Games where the prize is a slightly larger cubicle and a pat on the back. Meanwhile, the real heroes are the ones who somehow manage to keep their dignity in the face of such blatant disregard for their well-being.



Why can't we all just get along and work towards a common goal without the need for power trips and emotional manipulation? Is it really that hard to be a decent human being and treat your employees with respect? I guess for some, the only way to feel significant is to make others feel insignificant.



Well, let me tell you something, bosses of the world: your days of treating us like your personal punching bags are numbered. The tides are turning, and we're not going to stand for it anymore. We're waking up to the fact that our time and effort are worth more than a measly paycheck and a pat on the head. We demand to be treated with dignity and respect, not like a stepping stone on your path to corporate supremacy.



So, to all the bosses out there who think it's still the 1950s, wake up and smell the burnt coffee. The world has changed, and it's time for you to evolve or get left behind. We're not your playthings to be used and discarded. We're human beings with families, dreams, and a desire to not be treated like shit at our jobs.



And to those who have suffered under the tyranny of a terrible boss during a disaster like Hurricane Helene, I stand with you. Your bosses should be ashamed of themselves, and if they're not, then it's our job to make sure the world knows their true colors. Maybe then, just maybe, we can start to change the toxic culture that allows these monsters to flourish in the workplace. Until then, keep your heads up and remember: you're worth more than the bottom line.",1,1728932497.0,rant,0,1.0,False

He’s worked in marketing for a while, but I could tell he was itching for something different. One day, we grabbed coffee, and he casually dropped, “I’m thinking of becoming a pilot.” I nearly spit out my drink. A *pilot*? Where did *that* come from?

Turns out, he’s been researching it for months. He found a blog post that broke down everything about becoming a plane pilot. He was talking about the thrill of flying, the challenge of navigating the skies, and how he’s tired of staring at screens all day. The salary part wasn’t bad either, with entry-level pilots making around $60k and more experienced ones pulling in $100k+.

Of course, it’s not an easy path—there’s loads of training, long hours, and certifications—but he seemed totally fired up about it. He said something like, “Imagine being paid to travel the world and actually feel alive.” I could see it in his eyes—this wasn’t just some phase. He was serious.

If you’ve ever felt like switching gears or just want to know more about what it takes to become a pilot, you’ve got to check out the article that sparked Mark’s obsession: [MySmartCareer Blog on Becoming a Pilot](https://www.mysmartcareer.site/career_pilot?utm_campaign=BlogArticlesPosts&utm_source=reddit.com&utm_medium=social&utm_content=PilotCareer-Oct132024-21:50).

What can I do to help him change that?,"Bf (25 M) and me (26 F) have been dating for more than a year now. We started our relationship long distance. He’s a gem of a person, but he has been a horrible communicator for a long time now. 
He does take out ample time in his day for me and takes interest in my life. However, he barely shares anything about himself anymore. 

I on the other hand overshare sometimes. I initially thought I am maybe not asking him enough questions or giving him enough space to talk about his day so I even asked him if this is the case and took conscious effort to make sure to ask him about his day etc consistently. I would press him but wouldn’t get more than “my day was good”.
A few months ago I shared with him that I’ve been feeling this lack of communication from his end and he said his friends in the past have shared the same concerns with him. He said that he’ll take more effort but the change lasts for two days. I keep bringing it up and let him know we can work on it together. But nothing really changes. 

I’ve tried to tell him how much I love to hear about the mundane parts of his life and he broke down hearing this. Saying things like no one before has told him such things and that means so much to him. However, he still doesn’t share anything and in long distance these things can lead to stressful issues. For example, one time he fought with his family and around the same time I was working for a work deadline. I’ve been asking him the usual how his day has been etc and I communicated with him that I have a deadline coming up so I might be busy over the week. He doesn’t share anything with me but the day before my deadline he calls me and snaps at me that I don’t give him enough time etc and I was shocked. It was literally the first time I took some time off for my work and I even let him know. Later he tells me he had a fight with his family and was feeling very vulnerable and so he snapped at me. We have had two such other incidents after that, something would come up at his work or life, he wouldn’t share it with me and then snap for some other issue. One time, I was recovering from COVID and did not pick up his calls as frequently I would (my health was terrible and I was managing so much alone). One of those days I finally felt better, the first thing I did was that I called him. He did not answer, I called another friend and she was free so we grabbed some coffee together. He called me back while I was seeing my friend, I picked up his call, my friend said hi to him too and he didn’t say much other than have fun we’ll talk later. The next day he fought with me again, saying the whole week I didn’t talk to him and when I got better I decided to go see a friend instead(honestly I find this statement very concerning too. I was isolated for a week man! I needed to see people). I couldn’t see his pov at all and got very stressed. Two days later I was hospitalized because my health took a horrible turn. I don’t know if it was the additional stress or that I hadn’t recovered properly. It’s been a few months and my health still hasn’t recovered. He later mentioned that he was going through something the days I had Covid and ended up snapping at me instead. 
I am tired of asking him to communicate and I don’t know anymore what else I could do. It almost feels like he has a new excuse every time. His last one was that we end up fighting if he tells me about his day. We end up fighting because he snaps at me first and then later tells me something happened. How is this proper way of communicating?! And then he continues to say the fighting is not my fault it’s his. There is no way I can know what’s going on in his head unless he shares. Especially the times I am going through something and cannot coerce the details of his day out of him. I don’t know what else can I do to get home to communicate?

He seemed nice enough although a bit shy (I am quite shy too so I don't mind). When I didn't carry on the conversation he would go quiet at first and I thought he wanted to leave, but it seemed as time went on he got more comfortable and kept looking for excuses to keep hanging out. I noticed towards the end of the date he would keep staring into my eyes for long periods of time until I broke eye contact, and held my hand for a while which was unusual for a first date but quite sweet. He complimented my clothes but not my appearance if that means anything.

What I'm confused about was whether I should message him when I'm free again or if he just wants to be left alone? He hasn't messaged since the date so I would generally assume no. But during the date he did ask three or so times about meeting during this week if I was free, and I kept saying probably not as I was busy. Especially at the end he said see you soon, and I said probably not because I'm busy. Prior to the date he also asked me out a couple times as well.

First time posting on Reddit, here is an quick overview of my background:

27yo Female, Asian-Canadian

UG: non-target uni in Canada, 3.44 GPA

Extra curriculars: VP at a student club, volunteer at career service at uni, 2nd place in an trade competition (comp itself is bs honestly)

WE: 4 years in asset mgmt BO, my current title is analyst with comp 100k (base is higher bc it's a contract)

Have earned the CFA charter

GRE score: V161 Q165 AWA 3

  
Current dilemma - I unfortunately was dumb and not aware of all the high finance roles out there during my undergrad. With a combination of being clueless, lack of confidence and networking skill, I didn't recruit for any FO, IB or consulting roles and took the first job I got out of school which is in BO. Now after working for 4 years, getting my CFA chartered, applied to 200+ jobs (targeted application with cover letter and sample valuation case for each app), and countless coffee chats I feel truly stuck and depressed about my outlook and am seriously considering doing an MBA to unfuck my life. 

My target after MBA would be either IB or MBB so would like to focus on schools that are good feeders for both. I know they are pretty different but both fits what I am looking for in terms of the work, exit opps, pay --> the most important factor because my parents will be relying solely on me, and of course, prestige.

So far, the only thing I can think of to have my application stand out is probably an emotional personal story I can spin around with being a first-gen immigrant at 16, a somewhat abusive childhood, struggles with mental health, my aspiration to support my family financially, and my defeat in career advances and determination to never give up, which I believe ties well into why I want to pursue an MBA.

Am I delusional about getting into M7 with my profile? (fyi - will also be applying to UofT, McGill, and potentially York)

Food and drink was very expensive, but we expected it ($19 for a turkey leg, for those wondering). We came across a new-to-us coffee spot and decided to take a break there. Nyte's Coffee. Beautiful place, but the service and beverages were awful. $14 for a blended coffee and it was probably the worst one I've ever had. My sister bought an iced coffee and had the same reaction. So, if you're looking for coffee, go to the cafe by the entrance that's been there for years.

1g3nfaj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Weightlosstechniques/comments/1g3nfaj/intermittent_fasting_and_normalcy/,Intermittent fasting and normalcy,"I’m trying to get back into my weight loss journey because I want to be around for a long time. I seem to yo-yo quite a bit, which I know is extremely unhealthy.

I was on a great roll at the beginning of the year, basically from January to May, but unfortunately I got hurt at work and have been unable to do much until very recently. This year I had been trying to gain more muscle, which I was doing well with. In the gym regularly, eating better. But I really do believe I need to work more on dropping weight than gaining strength right now. 

My diet this year I had been more focused on gaining muscle and strength, so I’d start my day right when I woke up with a protein shake, fiber bar, oatmeal, and coffee/water and I was very regular. But doing this, and working out pretty good for that long, I didn’t lose any weight. I know it’s probably a little muscle, but I was also hoping to drop some weight. 

Here’s my question. My best results for weight loss have always come from intermittent fasting. I’d generally have nothing but black coffee and water until about noon, at which time I’d eat until dinner time, anywhere from 530-7. The only issue I ever had with this, was that I was very irregular with my bathroom visits. Does anyone else have ideas on how to get around this? That was my only drawback to going back to intermittent fasting.

I think most guys focus on texting strategies because it’s *the easiest way* to get in contact with a woman by potentially avoiding an ""in person rejection"". 

But here’s the problem: **Texting is a non-human way of communicating**;

it doesn’t involve all of your senses, your body language, your tonality, leaving 90% of the ""full message"" completely undelivered.

I know it’s tough to swallow, but if you struggle in person, texting can lead to even worse results. Why? Because when you're behind the screen, it's 10x easier to fall into the same traps that lead to awkward, unengaging, flat interactions.

Those who don’t get results focus on the wrong things while texting. They: 

• Spend too much time building rapport, trying to keep the conversation alive.  
• Constantly try to reinitiate the conversation when it dies out.  
• Obsess over the verbal content of their messages, stressing over every word.  
• Either wait too long to ask her out or rush to set the date too soon.  
• Fail to build momentum in the interaction, leaving everything to chance.

What’s the output? You may get ghosted, ignored, or find yourself in a never-ending loop of ""small talk.""

You need to approach texting with a completely different mindset:  
• Use texting as a tool, not as a way to get to know someone – with the only goal of leading the conversation towards a real life, offline, in-person meeting.  
• Become the person who's chased, rather than constantly chasing the girl.  
• Focus on bringing the other person into your life rather than jumping into her world.  
• Create emotional experiences through texts instead of sharing facts about yourself.  
• Read the woman’s level of interest and act accordingly.  
• Understand that texting isn’t real life, so don’t waste all your energy, focus, and hopes on it. Prioritize real-life interactions and don’t be needy or desperate for options.

If you’ve been struggling to get a good response rate from your texts, or if you feel like you’re always chasing conversations that lead nowhere, it’s time to make a shift.

Here are three things you can start doing immediately to get better texting results:

1. Don’t be predictable. Don’t follow the same routine, the same questions, and the same safe topics. Be playful, spontaneous, and take risks.
2. Don’t be afraid to disagree. Show her that you have your own opinions and that you’re not afraid to challenge her thoughts in a confident way. It will create a more dynamic interaction.
3. Invite her to something you’re already doing. Instead of creating an elaborate first date in some overly planned setting, invite her to something you were already planning to do – whether it’s grabbing coffee at your favorite spot or attending an event you're interested in. This takes the pressure off the situation and makes the interaction feel more natural.

It’s time to understand that success in texting isn’t about memorizing perfect lines or over-analyzing each message. It’s about shifting your focus from having a conversation on your screen to create an opportunity to have a conversation face to face.

P.S. If you’ve noticed that women seem to lose interest after the first or second date, or if you have no idea how a first date should even work, I have something for you. I’ve put together a free eBook that will show you exactly how to create more meaningful connections on your dates and avoid the common mistakes that kill attraction.

We dated since we were 14 until 21, so 7 years.
She started dating one of her closer friends 3/4 months after we broke up.
We talked about our entire relationship because we knew we loved each other a lot but there were some issues we couldn’t get past through because we were a little immature I guess.
It’s been 1 year and 3 months since the breakup and she’s about to reach 1 year mark with her new bf.


She didn’t tell him she was meeting me because “she didn’t want him to thing stuff that is not going to happen” which for me it’s a little disrespectful for her bf but ok.


She tried to explain to me that she misses having me in her life because besides being boyfriend and girlfriend at the same, we considered ourselves best friends aswell. I feel the same.
But I also told her I could never have a friendship with someone that I already envisioned a future with. Which she agreed aswell. I think there were some lingering feelings when we were saying our goodbyes and she texted me next morning with a photo of her niece. I told her I appreciated the update on her but that’s beyond my boundaries and cut contact :/

But she texted my mom this week. She said she has been feeling some stuff for the past few months and feels like her head is stuck and that she can’t be happy.
I find this weird because I thought her and her new bf got along pretty well.
I don’t think she’s into me anymore, or at least she’s too proud to admit that maybe she moved on a little fast and if she waited a bit longer, we could’ve worked things out.

She said she wanted to meet my mom to talk about this because she feels like she can help her but I don’t think it’s true. Somehow I feel like she’s just trying to get my moms approval of her new relationship so she can move on “freely” and it’s eating me inside because, deep down, I would do anything to make our relationship work.

My mom agreed to meet her for coffee.

I want her to be happy but I keep thinking about a possible reconciliation and, honestly, I know it’s not going to happen. It just sucks because the way she phrased her thoughts to my mom, sounds like she is not content with her life right know and that she misses us.

I feel like I’m starting to become delusional about this situation and I’m also feeling stuck because I think any outcome will hurt me a ton lot, and I don’t want to go through that pain again…

I have a quick question regarding the Water Package for my upcoming Celebrity cruise (Reflection, 3 nights). We are a party of 4 in 2 staterooms. Currently, I see two options for water. 

  
1. Water package (Acqua Panna 12 bottles) @ $37.99 (one time setup)

2. Non-alcoholic drink package  @ $39.99 pppd totals (1 room - $240 and 2 rooms - $480) - which includes a multitude of non-alcoholic options. 

  
Now, the question I have is what is the size of the 12 bottles mentioned in the water package. Are those 1L bottles OR 500ml bottles. This information is NOT provided in the description. If they are 1L, 24 bottles among 4, should be sufficient for the entire trip. Otherwise, we are planning to take non-alcoholic package for 1 room. None of us drink any soft drinks Or speciality coffees daily in general. We are planning to purchase alcoholic drinks / juices a la carte. 

Also, I heard that we can take 12 pack soft drinks per person while boarding the ship. Does this also applicable for water?

Ooof I’ve been having a lot of pain from sciatica recently, and I’ve also been going to the gym to try and reduce weight and aid sleep.

However, yesterday I also had a very strong coffee and had a rage fit in a supermarket. Very upsetting, as I have been working so hard on my mental health and practicing all the strategies and doing all the things. I also have ADHD and autism, and yesterday I had a full on meltdown at a mum from my daughter’s school who has been just horrid, but I was taking the moral high ground. That ended yesterday as I turned into Satan and told her to fuck off, among other things. I am usually so good at managing my triggers, but I was tired and in pain and it just all came out.

I went to the gym later that afternoon after a cry and a chat to a couple of friends. I was exhausted and fell asleep at 10pm, only to wake at 1.15am, wide awake. I’ve been trying to sleep since then and it’s 5.30am here in Australia, and I have an appointment at 9am. Gonna have to push through until bedtime tonight, if I nap I’m done for.

It’s been one of those horrid “dark nights of the soul”, where I feel sad and alone and quite frankly, ashamed of myself for losing my temper in such a horrible way yesterday. My sciatica and neck pain has been horrible, too, and I’ve struggled to get comfortable. My kids have their week with my ex this week and even the cats have abandoned me!!

Now, from revisiting the Bloody Sweet Promo, man I wish Loki had actually shown a calm, poised Chocolatier like shown in the promo, in that very look, and explored his side where he forges, but no instead what we got was some glimpses of him forging in between a song, and just him being a cafe owner dealing with chocolates and chocolate coffee, thats it.

Flashback etho aachu we’ve discussed that a lot, but man I really wish it was either non-LCU or the LCU integration had been done better. Like Vikram calling “Leo”, for having destroyed a Datura factory, well he should’ve known he did it just to protect his identity and now you’re calling “Leo” to fight against drugs? And now that Vijay na is calling his acting career ends, now that’s an open end in LCU. 

From the Bloody Sweet BGM on the interval post, I realised how much more the movie could have been gripping if they hadn’t blasted Leooooo on Parthiban before the interval. I think it was quite predictable that parthiban is leo and it would’ve been even better if Leo did exist separately, like a glimpse at Leo in the end  or if Leo just died and Parthiban just fought for himself, but no they had to take the same old route.

**Step-by-Step Recipe for Chocolate Raspberry Cupcakes**

**Step 1: Make the Chocolate Cupcakes**

1. Preheat your oven to 350ﾰF (175ﾰC) and line a muffin tin with cupcake liners.
2. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
3. In another bowl, mix the melted butter, eggs, and vanilla extract until well combined.
4. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, then slowly pour in the buttermilk and hot water, mixing until the batter is smooth. If using, gently fold in the raspberry preserves.
5. Divide the batter evenly among the cupcake liners, filling each about two-thirds full.
6. Bake for 18–20 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake comes out clean. Allow the cupcakes to cool in the pan for 5 minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.

**Step 2: Prepare the Raspberry Frosting**

1. In a large bowl, beat the softened butter until light and fluffy.
2. Gradually add the powdered sugar, one cup at a time, while continuing to mix on low speed.
3. Add the raspberry puree and vanilla extract, beating until the frosting is smooth and creamy. If the frosting is too thick, add a little more puree; if it’s too thin, add more powdered sugar.

**Step 3: Frost the Cupcakes**

1. Once the cupcakes are completely cool, pipe or spread the raspberry frosting generously on top of each cupcake.
2. Garnish with a fresh raspberry on top of each cupcake for an extra touch of elegance.

**Tips for Making the Best Chocolate Raspberry Cupcakes**

1. **Use fresh raspberries:** Fresh raspberries enhance both the flavor and the presentation of these cupcakes. You can also use frozen raspberries if fresh ones are not available.
2. **Room temperature ingredients:** Make sure your butter and eggs are at room temperature before baking to ensure a smooth batter and even baking.
3. **Adjust the frosting consistency:** If your frosting is too thick, add a splash of milk or cream; if it’s too runny, add more powdered sugar.
4. **Experiment with fillings:** For a surprise inside, you can fill the center of each cupcake with a spoonful of raspberry preserves before frosting.

**Why This Recipe Works**

The combination of rich, moist chocolate cake and tart raspberry frosting creates a perfect balance of flavors. The hot water in the cupcake batter helps to intensify the chocolate flavor, while the raspberry puree adds a natural fruity taste to the frosting. These cupcakes are not only delicious but also visually stunning, with a vibrant pop of color from the raspberries.

**Serving Suggestions for Chocolate Raspberry Cupcakes**

* **Perfect for celebrations:** These cupcakes are great for birthdays, anniversaries, or Valentine’s Day.
* **Pair with coffee:**ﾠThe rich chocolate flavor pairs beautifully with a cup of coffee or hot cocoa.
* **Store leftovers:**ﾠKeep any leftover cupcakes in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.

**Conclusion**

**Chocolate Raspberry Cupcakes** are a delightful treat that combines the richness of chocolate with the tart sweetness of raspberries. With their soft, moist texture and creamy frosting, these cupcakes are a perfect dessert for any occasion. Easy to make and even easier to enjoy, they’re sure to be a hit with anyone who loves the classic combination of chocolate and fruit.",1,1728930480.0,u_Zdigitalkeys,0,1.0,False

I'm on week 3 now of 5mg and I've been eating super clean and on a deficit, I consume about 1200 calories a day and have been loosing an average of 4/5lbs per week since starting MJ. 
My start weight was 22 stone and my BMI was 45.5. Just for context.

I woke up Saturday with some pretty uncomfortable stomach ache, I didn't think too much into though and got ready for work as normal. In the time it took to get ready and make a coffee, the stomach ache worsened and suddenly felt sick.
I ran to be sick but it was just a little glass of water I'd consumed moment prior. BOOOM!!!
My upper abdomen was in tatters, felt like someone was reaching into me and squeezing and twisting me.
I couldn't catch my breath and after a while had no choice but to get my wife to call an ambulance.
This lasted for about an hour and a half and subsided enroute to the Hospital.

It turns out being over weight or loosing weight too quickly can cause the bile chemistry in the Gallbladder to make Gallstones and this can cause Acute Pancreatitis if a Gallstone gets stuck in the pancreatic tract. Which is what happened to me.

This wasn't caused by MJ by any means but was a byproduct of being over weight in the first place and rapid weight loss.
Keep yourselves hydrated and stay clear of alcohol if your loosing weight quickly guys and if you find yourself in the position I did, then try to stay calm, breath through it and call 999.
Get checked out and the all clear to continue MJ. 
I'm continuing MJ but going for some scans tomorrow, hope it was a one off event which these things can be but failing that I will have to either have the Gallstones or Gallbladder removed.

Stay safe guys and don't underestimate the power of body chemistry and healthy weightloss.",14,1728930407.0,mounjarouk,3,1.0,False

My normal diet consists of coffee and nothing until dinner which is usually a handful or this and that out of the cabinet. I only drink water if I get a headache and otherwise live in a permanent state of dehydration. As far as exercise- I do none unless you count chasing a toddler around as a workout.

At this point I am begging for help on how to get going. I am really interested in weights and building my strength but overall I just want to improve my health. A few questions:

Do you start extra protein from the beginning? I think I’d do best with a powder to begin as I don’t eat much. 

Maybe some easy but good foods that could be beneficial?

","Sorry if this is the wrong sub for this, but does anyone know how governments can possibly find individuals who only do their business on a separate laptop, in a busy area, using public wifi?

Or if the guy is in the toilet of a coffee shop, they'll have no footage at all. Assuming this guy never uses the same wifi twice, shuts down his laptop and puts it in a faraday cage before heading back home, and choses locations that are at least 1 hour away from home, how would a government agency go about finding him?

However the scenes with Jim really took me out of it. It felt to me like Jim was portrayed as an overly uptight, socially inept dork. It seemed to be playing into a stereotype our culture has, which I've also seen in the Jim Carrey TV show ""Kidding"", that men who work in children's entertainment like Jim Henson or Mr. Rogers are clueless namby-pambys who live in some kind of fantasy land in their brains, & who are uncomfortable with acknowledging or joking about the realities of sex & violence in the way that the oh-so-mature cast & crew of SNL do. I'm reluctant to blame either the writing or the acting or any one person but it felt like whoever was responsible for Jim's portrayal had never watched a Wilkins Coffee commercial. It made him look dumb, & while I never met the guy & don't know his personality it's clear from his work he wasn't dumb. Maybe I'm too much of a fan & too attached to Jim.
