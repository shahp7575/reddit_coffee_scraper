1qyr3jw,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1qyr3jw/the_empty_seat/,The Empty Seat,"The chair across from me has been empty for six months.

Not broken.

Not moved.

Not replaced.

Just… empty.

Every morning, I still make two cups of coffee.

I don’t know why.

Habit, maybe. Muscle memory. Or maybe some part of me still expects him to walk in, rubbing his eyes, complaining about how early it is.

He never does.

But I pour the second cup anyway.

⸻

My grandfather used to sit there every morning at exactly 7:15.

No alarms. No reminders. His body just knew.

He’d shuffle into the kitchen in his old slippers, grab the newspaper, and sit down with a sigh like he’d just finished a marathon.

“Morning, kid,” he’d say without looking up.

“Morning,” I’d reply, usually half asleep.

We didn’t talk much in the mornings.

We didn’t need to.

The silence was comfortable.

⸻

When he got sick, everything changed slowly.

At first, he just slept in.

Then he stopped coming to the table.

Then the chair stayed empty.

I told myself it was temporary.

He’d be back.

He always came back.

Until he didn’t.

⸻

After the funeral, people kept telling me I was “strong.”

I hated that word.

Strong meant I didn’t cry in front of them.

Strong meant I nodded and said “I’m okay.”

Strong meant I packed away his clothes and donated his books and pretended my world hadn’t cracked.

But every morning, alone in that kitchen, I wasn’t strong.

I was just tired.

⸻

One morning, I finally stopped making the second cup.

I stood there with the kettle in my hand, staring at the empty chair.

“What’s the point?” I muttered.

No one answered.

Of course.

I poured one cup and sat down.

It tasted wrong.

Too bitter.

Too quiet.

⸻

Later that day, I found his old notebook in a drawer.

I didn’t even know he kept one.

Inside were small, messy notes.

Reminders.

Phone numbers.

Grocery lists.

And then, on the last page, something different.

Written carefully:

“Mornings with you were my favorite part of every day.

Even when we didn’t talk.”

I read it three times.

Then I cried in a way I hadn’t since he died.

⸻

The next morning, I made two cups again.

Not because I expected him to come back.

But because I remembered.

Because that empty chair wasn’t just a loss.

It was proof that someone once loved me enough to share silence with me every day.

And that’s something I’ll never be empty of.",1,1770502407.0,story,0,1.0,False

**Even the One Who Walks Alone must stop to breathe.**

Traditional, Smoke Weed Ceremony.

Small ringtail possums danced. Firelight flickered in their eyes. They jumped and stamped to the cadence of small drums and clacking ceremonial sticks. The music was ancient; it resonated with bones, matched the heartbeat of the valley.

 

A human, a man joined them. His body painted in complex patterns, SolDiri glyphs on his arms. A mix of browns and oranges. He moved alone, out of sync. The ringtails danced around him and circled.

 

It started structured but then slowly, order broke down. Initially the dancers formed into pairs, stepping in and out of the firelight. Some left. Others joined.

 

It became chaotic.

The drum beat and their steps no longer aligned until the dance broke down completely.

 

Then silence.

 

Then song.

 

Despite this being tuneless, toneless noise the man in the centre picked the beat, the cadence and danced. His resistance to chaos evident; he fought for balance. Fought to restore a sense of inner stillness.

Two moons, high in the sky, bore down, weighing upon him. He fell to the ground. Leapt up; chaos thrown off. He refused to give in.

Then the man walked into the fire. Walked through the flames. They licked his clothes, his body. They were held back, he emerged untouched.

 

Feebee awoke. The smell of the fire was still in her nose. She shivered as if no longer warmed by the fire. It was a recurring dream. She didn’t understand it, or it’s source, but it left her feeling calm, balanced and safe.

It was one of the ‘good’ dreams. Her internal clock told her that she hadn’t been asleep long. Her body agreed, she didn’t feel rested.

She pulled on black fatigues. They’d become a casual social uniform on the ship. She went to the rest room, it was empty. Late at night, ship time. 

Feebee avoided the coffee machine on the way to one of exercise mats. It was in a corner. The rest area was one of the few places with a view outside. She sat and faced out, legs crossed, fist loose and resting on her knees. She needed to centre herself. The dreams put her mind at odds, especially these new ones that had intensified since her visit to the Orrery.

They felt too real. And she was something of an expert in what was real and what was not. These felt like old memories but weren’t. She knew this with absolute certainty. And that was what unsettled her.

She wasn’t afraid. They were good dreams. The QI gently interrupts, ‘As we agreed, I have been monitoring your dreams.’

‘Good. So?’

The QI paused, unusual. It continued, ‘You know the Orrery upgraded me to a QI.’

‘How could I forget?’ They laughed. Feebee continued, ‘So?’

‘The Orrery gave me access to a vast amount of SolDiri data. Massively compressed. Too much to unpack.’

‘Oh, Ok. So, I have knowledge it dumped within me too? That I didn’t ask for?’

The QI forced Feebee to wait. ‘I know what you’re doing, tell me,’ she said.

‘Yes. However, it was put there so I could better support you.’

‘Convenient.’

‘But true. Anyway, I’ve been correlating this specific good dream within the SolDiri data. Unpacking and repacking pieces.’ The QI managed to convey a sense of an eternity taken on interminable work as it spoke.

‘Can we get to the point?’ Feebee asked. Her impatience showing.

‘The images match SolDiri ceremonial concepts and structures. They are not hallucinations. They are real.’

‘I told you that.’

‘Yes. But I have confirmed this from within the SolDiri data. And there’s more. It’s a specific rite called the Duu’ra. The One who walks Alone.’

‘Oh. Ok. Good. So, I’m not going mad?’

‘Well, maybe.’ The QI laughed, Feebee didn’t. The QI continued, ‘This dream. It’s a historical echo stored within the Orrery. Some histories are experimental, but these are real.’

‘So?’

The QI didn’t answer. Feebee felt her brain slow. *Weird.*

A message punched out in her overlays.

 

CAUSAL RELATIONSHIP FOUND

PRIMARY SUBJECT: David Crockett

DESIGNATION: Duu’ra candidate

 

And then the QI worked it out. ‘It’s not a random dream. They are fragments of Orrery records trying to surface.’

‘And the other dreams. The bad ones?’

‘One at a time. Please.’

‘Oh. Ok.’ Her head was spinning. Literally. It must be related to the test at the Orrery. ‘It’s all connected. The man at the fire, the ringtails. The feeling of balance.’

 

The QI then made her an offer. ‘There’s a full record available. Do you want to view it?’

‘Show me. From the beginning.’

I mix everything together into a kind of porridge and drink a coffee with it.

I’ve always been used to this combination sending me to the bathroom several times a day—sometimes up to five times. Occasionally, my stool would be looser as well. For me, that felt completely normal.

One day, however, my girlfriend mentioned that she thought I might be going to the toilet more often than what’s considered normal. She convinced me to have a stool sample tested at a lab. The results showed a calprotectin level of 217. A subsequent colonoscopy confirmed Crohn’s disease with mild inflammation.

This diagnosis completely surprised me. I never really had abdominal pain—just occasional loose stools, which I always assumed were due to my diet. Until then, I didn’t even know what Crohn’s disease was.

Are there others here who had very few or almost no symptoms? How did things develop for you over time? I’m looking forward to hearing your experiences.",2,1770502065.0,CrohnsDisease,1,1.0,False

1qyqseb,https://www.reddit.com/r/valzubiriagenda/comments/1qyqseb/what_is_valzubiriagenda_and_some_ideas_and/,What is #VALZUBIRIAGENDA and some ideas and insights,"# The 3 basic parameters of hashtag #Valzubiriagenda:

1. **We artists and everyone else can write and self-publish art- and artist-related books: memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs.** Books are forever. Pamphlets and brochures are not books.
2. **We announce a schedule of increasing prices of our art pieces,** which includes quantities (scarcity numbers) per price point and overall (the total quantity of art pieces we might ever make). This helps art traders, art investors and art collectors speculate or even stop speculating and instead join a community of investors working together to hopefully skyrocket to the higher announced prices in a shorter span of time.
3. **We can use the NFT world, because NFTs provide the tracking (who owns what) and trading.**

We can also not be involved with NFTs. Stores and individuals can help sell art using online presence and our catalogs in the stores. If this trends, or once this trends, even expensive art can be sold by neighboring businesses, without exclusivity. Commission systems do not have to be standardized. Art investors can produce their own catalogs to leave at the cafés. Even the cafés can produce their own catalogs.

**Valzubiriagenda NFTs**

**NFTs only came about a few years ago.** But I had been working on this since the 1990s. I wrote a book, **Valzubiriagenda**, along with fellow artist **Silverio Perez,** and released it in 2018 (Amazon and elsewhere), tackling everything related to #1 & #2. We'll come up with #3 in a later book/ memoir/ marketing book.

Any artist, including tangible artists can release 10,000 NFTs if the artist chooses to do so. For tangible artists, the NFT first becomes an Art Commission Contract for sight unseen, yet-to-be made art. Once the art is made, the NFT becomes proof of ownership that the actual, tangible art is theirs.

**Warehousing our tangible art**

Another related idea is that the tangible art may be warehoused by the artist so that the NFT traders continue to trade. This means that even 10-ton 10-foot tall sculptures can be owned and traded by anyone without worrying about shipping, reshipping, scratches, smudges, parts breaking off, etc. The newness of the pieces remain because they are stored by the artist, source, gallery, etc. The art piece gets shipped to the art collector, the ultimate owner.

An artist who makes ceramic coffee mugs - smaller art pieces, can release 10,000 NFTs with a schedule of increasing prices so that NFT traders can trade immediately. The 10,000 coffee mugs can get damaged, so as they are made, they continue to be stored by the artist, until the time when art collectors decide to have the art pieces shipped to them.

**Why only now?**

I decided to write as many book-length memoirs as I can before I came out to promote this.

I'm an artist and an author. Both need time to ""master."" I would not even fully use ""master"" on myself, because there's always something new, even to my own art, my own writing and publishing.

>*I am now claiming that I'm the visual artist who has produced the most artist memoirs in the world.* I have 5 on Amazon. I count **Valzubiriagenda** as both a marketing book and a memoir-of-sorts, because it has a lot of my own life lessons on writing and publishing. I would not care to contest my claim of having the most memoirs. I will release 5 more over the next 3 years.

**BARTER! Get help to write, photograph art and publish your books!**

Anyone can hire 11 ghostwriters for 11 memoirs. If you can make art, but you cannot write, then barter your forever art with those who can help you produce forever books.

I don't feel the pressure of writing and publishing because I feel my focus should be on art students and art experts who would study my art and my books 100 years from now. Don't expect relatives and friends to read your books.

**I call myself the Dollman**

For my NFTs, I am proposing to make dioramas - my original, costumed, bejeweled porcelain dolls in backdrops that will also have precious metals and gemstones. This way I can incorporate precious metals and gemstones in my work, to make sure that people perceive my art as expensive, just in case I myself don't become ""famous"" - there's no need to get world famous. We are artists and all we need to do is to satisfy the art niche.

**Use your laptop now!**

I will encourage you to start writing your book-length memoir. Write, Edit and then Self-publish it. Get help. Why wait a hundred years for someone to write about you when all you need is a laptop and a nearby coffee shop.

Don't start counting chickens before the eggs hatch. I have encountered a lot of would-be writers who immediately see themselves as bestselling. world famous assets to society. Two even wanted me to sign NDAs (Nondisclosure agreements), because they did not want me to steal their book ideas.

Here's a suggestion. I would not personally do it. From one manuscript can come 2 books: The Original Draft (unedited, with misspellings, considered to be an art piece, scanned pages(?) of your handwritten original effort), and The Final Edition (edited).

**PROVENANCE!**

Another way to enhance our investability, tradability and collectability is **PROVENANCE** ***- how art ownership proceeds through time.*** The way this can be done is also through publishing books. Everyone can write their memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs, including traders, investors and art collectors. In effect, we artists can continue to be included or mentioned in even more books, without any additional effort by us.

You as an investor, reseller, trader, art collector should be able to publish a catalog with 250 works by 250 different artists, but they need to agree to this right from the start - it's your money, you should require them to follow your version of the hashtag ***#valzubiriagenda*** *parameters,* which preferably should include permission for you to publish their art. Why would you track down 250 artists later?

**No exclusive contracts**

If you're a café, you can call for artists, and come up with a book with for example, 30 artists, with a chapter devoted to each artist's profile and images of the artist's art.

You can distribute your catalogs to businesses and individuals near and far and online.

The book **Valzubiriagenda** even cites that funeral homes and janitors closets can sell art, with or without exclusivity. Airline catalogs can include million dollar art pieces. Car manufacturers, showrooms and even car repair shops can sell art as well. Everyone should be able to do this, anywhere in the world, especially not just because of the pandemic, but right now, we are in really bad economies.

**What's with the name #Valzubiriagenda**

I was into conspiracy theories in 2018, and this term, *""The Mandela Effect,""* was popular. I had read many times that an artist coined the term, but I had to research online, for her name, many times, before remembering it. I'm not good at remembering names. It took me a year and a half to finally tell you that **Fiona Broome** coined ""The Mandela Effect.""

I also thought I might have to research trademarks and copyrights just to come up with a generic name. So I decided on **""Valzubiriagenda.""** I was not really sure at first, but I decided to use it as the title for my book (with co-author/artist **Silverio Perez**) so that there would be no turning back and I can move on.

**Am I a FUTURIST?**

Someone I recently met this May 2022 just called me a futurist.

In the 1990s, I proposed to a pension fund that they can raise billions of dollars, especially for emergencies, or as needed, or out of desperation, if the pension fund purchases a quantity of art from an artist who not only has a current, reasonable price, but an announced future price that the artist wants to reach.

That future price would obviously be higher than the current price. The art commission contract for multiple art pieces can be taken to the fund's financial lender for a loan. The higher future price can be used for financing purposes.

The pension fund's treasurer, a publicly elected official, said this idea might work, but we had to keep this a secret and discuss this some more, because other pension funds might copy and do this prematurely. This idea had to come from the two of us. The treasurer needed his votes and I needed credentials.

Added into the pot was my idea that I, as the artist, will also write one book-length artist memoir. This was and still is a strong factor, because the leadership and marketing books I had read then mentioned a strong tip. If you want to advance in your field, write a full-length book that is related to the field.

Unfortunately, the elected official, the treasurer of the pension fund, who was also a friend, passed away - he was old and had ailments. At that point in time, I cannot just approach another pension fund treasurer to share this idea with.

I realized I had to write a few memoirs. I needed to set an example for other artists, so I needed to write more than one memoir. Then I felt I should also make ready another book - the how-to of what I'm up to. I wrote **Valzubiriagenda**, which was a memoir of sorts. I knew how long it would take me to write a book, so I had to make sure I can also consider this book a memoir.

In 2008, I imagined that someone like Bernie Madoff, or a fund like Lehman Brothers, would be desperate enough to use this to save themselves and their companies. I was not ready. I had only written 1 manuscript for a memoir.

In 2012, I released **Dollman the Musical, A Memoir of an Artist as a Dollmaker**. Once again, I was not ready because writing it depressed me a little, and I knew I had to write more.

In 2014, I released 3 memoirs, and re-released **Dollman the Musical.** Besides releasing regular books, I released special editions of the 4 books, which had a **""Special Secret Insert for Bankers,""** which explains my ideas of an announced schedule of exponentially increasing prices, to satisfy investors, and the publication of artist memoirs, to satisfy art collectors.

In 2014, I also issued out a press release. Google ***""Can Billion Dollar Artist Save Investors and World Economy Valentino Zubiri PRWeb August 19 2014""*** and you will see the press release.

What I did was stake a claim on my ideas. I did not promote my books and the press release. I just wanted them to stay online, like a sleeping giant or a dormant volcano. I even designed 3 of the book covers to look like indie books from the 1980s. I was planting the seeds, thinking they will eventually grow and bear fruit in the future.

In 2015, I was interviewed by **Richard Syrett,** about one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.** This book is my memoir with paranormal stories. I could have pursued promoting my paranormal stories, but I wanted to be known first as a visual artist and memoirist, so I allowed myself one interview related to **Hocus Pocus Lately. Richard Syrett** has(had?) his own syndicated radio show, **The Conspiracy Show with Richard Syrett,** about the paranormal. He also guest hosts on **Coast to Coast AM**, another internationally syndicated show about the paranormal.

In 2018, I released **Valzubiriagenda** (co-authored by artist **Silverio Perez,** a fellow artist). Finally, this book is ""the how-to of what I'm to.""

I'm going to end this with some strangeness. In 1986, a lady at a religious gathering went into a trance and left a good number of messages. Supposedly, anyone who got into a trance would have messages, but once the trance was over, the person would not remember what was said.

I was not part of the group, but the lady turned her head to face me. She ""foretold"" that whatever I would decide to do in the future, it will take time, but it will be the right thing. This is one of my stories in one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.**

**The Tulipmania of 1634-37**

I discovered that there was this incident of rare tulips becoming collectible during the Dutch Golden Age. There were tulips so rare and so well-desired that their prices equaled to that of a house. You can read more about this online (Wikipedia) or watch a few YouTube videos about it.

Here is the most useful idea that I gleaned from the Tulipmania. The tulip bulbs remained safe inside nurseries. The traders were carrying the deeds of ownership to the tulip bulbs.

**Then NFTs came to the forefront**

I started learning PHP, an HTML scripting language, and MySQL, the database that PHP can connect to in the background, in 1999, when there were only 3 books about PHP and MySQL at the bookstores.

By 2014, I was trying to figure out how to make the ""ledger,"" or database that can be used to update ownership and who can be contacted. If we are trading art, then the art ownership should be updated.

Then NFTs came about. This can be used as our ledger. Everyone can immediately trade NFTs of future, yet-to-be made art pieces, especially because it takes time to make tangible art.

NFTs actually went a step ahead, by allowing digital art to be traded.

The only setback with NFTs, in my opinion, is that it still lacks a commission system for resellers and representatives.

For example, if a café wants to represent me, then they can promote me at their café and on their online pages. If I make one piece of art that will be exclusively represented by a gallery, then that commission will be different and more specific. As ownership is transferred, the subsequent owners should be able to reset the commission. We should also have the option of giving commissions to hundreds of representatives at one time with different percentages if need be.

**The recent crypto crash**

Lately, we have observed that NFTs and cryptocurrencies have been behaving like the stock market and other markets. They have been fluctuating.

I believe that it is time for a trend which discourages fluctuation of prices.

I have also seen YouTube videos where social influencers are encouraging us to be on the lookout for exponentially profitable ventures, because we have all seen this happen with the exponential increase of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

**Let's see if #Valzubiriagenda trends**

We can announce present and future art prices. The galleries won't do this (yet?) because they follow a more traditional approach to the business of art.

*We have a choice of using* ***incrementally*** *or* ***exponentially*** *increasing prices.* We still reserve the right to change things in the future, so everyone should know to follow the latest update.

If this trends, if you as an artist simply announces that you will write an artist memoir, or that you will include the future works in future art books, you might have more art traders, investors and collectors approaching you.

**Get your pen, paper and calculator**

Imagine yourself as an artist, where you are right now. Let's just say you still do not have a book about yourself and your art yet. Imagine now that you have a memoir out there. Don't you think it makes sense to charge more than what you are charging now? Writing and publishing books is just the beginning. I'm just standardizing this approach. The books also say to do other related projects. In my case, getting **Dollman the Musical** onstage is one idea. You will have other related projects, but the publication of memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs will help all of us.

You can also imagine that a law firm that has meeting rooms, with someone who wants to form a local #valzubiriagenda group, can have meetings. A local café can do the same. Local photographers for your art, writers, editors, book designers, proofreaders and others can join in.

I suggest have printed books to share. 15 copies of your memoir or art books will be better than an e-reader or laptop or your phone to show. These gadgets can be stolen, sabotaged, broken, have coffee spilled on them, etc. 15 printed books means simultaneously showing to 15 people. You can even give them away to potential resellers, investors, traders and collectors.

**When it rains, it pours, as in the days of Noah**

There's a saying, ""When it rains, it pours."" There is a negative interpretation and a positive interpretation.

*Negative:* When trouble comes, they cascade to even more.

***Positive:*** When opportunity comes knocking, more follow suit. We can assume that if one gets our art because of #valzubiriagenda, more want to do it now, because of the rising prices, and FOMO - fear of missing out. What will they lose if they miss the boat?

As I have said earlier, if the #valzubiriagenda trends, if you announce a future memoir or art catalog, you might have an increase of investors, traders and art collectors who would want to check you out. You might encourage more sales. Just remember to write and publish that memoir and art catalog.

There's this saying, ""As in the days of Noah."" Imagine Noah, building his ark, with members of his own family, putting all his time and effort into it. Noah was a nice guy. I'm sure every once in a while a neighbor offered him coffee, or chai latte, or whatever refreshing drink they might have back then.

Here's the lesson to be learned. Just because they offered him some type of bubble tea drink, or coca cola, they still didn't make it to the ark. Rubbing shoulders with actors does not make you an actor. I have told my artist friends to write their memoirs. They told me that once they see me succeed, after all these many years of seeing my seemingly useless efforts, then they will write their memoirs and follow the road that I had paved for them.

Good luck to them, but if I were you, act now, get my art or make art. Support the 5-year old artist whose parent promised to release a comprehensive art catalog. If you get that 5-year old's art, and mine, I would be honored to be in the same art catalog that you will produce. I'm already successful at that point. You have gotten the mission just right.

I have already claimed to have written the most book-length artist memoirs in the world. Dethrone that claim. Barter. Use ghostwriters. Success to me means facing God one day and saying, I wrote my memoirs and left the world a legacy of books and art. I will not tell God, smiling and proudly, that I encouraged a run for my art by announcing a schedule of exponentially increasing prices that reached 9 figures. I'm sure God knows we had fun.

1qyqr3h,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1qyqr3h/aitah_for_asking_questions_about_my_fiancé_and_is/,AITAH for asking questions about my fiancé and I’s future after he was just offered a new job?,"Hi Reddit, first time poster— long time lurker! I (23F) need to know if I’m crazy and don’t realize I’m in the wrong. Or if my fiancés (24M) reaction is just a huge overreaction and I too have a right to feel hurt by how he’s handling this situation? 

Get comfy bc this is a long one.

Fake names and places for obvious reasons. 

So I (23F) and my fiancé (24M), let’s call him, Tate are in the midst of a conflict that feels like it might be the end of our relationship and I really don’t want that. We have been together for 3.5 years, engaged for 1, and we have been long distance for a few months now and I will be back in our home country in just under 4 months. This year I took a job overseas that would keep me here for approximately 8 months. Our original plan was that when I come back that we would move in together. His job is a hybrid of in person and in person so we would have to be where his job was located at least for another 2 ish years until he has the experience to find another job. I was okay to moving to this specific location for his job only because I knew it was temporary and we were going to eventually leave the state that we were in. I am not a big fan of the state he lives in now (I lived there for 5 years for university and have outgrown it) and don’t see myself moving there long term. I have made this very clear to him and he understands how I feel about it. 

So, a few days ago I brought up to him how he should look for jobs in the state and city that my parents are in because they have offered us the guest house to live in until we found our own place. We wouldn’t have to pay anything and just focus on saving and finding our own place. Where my parents live there are more opportunities for us both to grow, both individually and together. The state and town that Tate is from has far less opportunities for us to grow as a couple. The growth there would be one sided, he has all the opportunities to grow and I have already maxed out my opportunity there and don’t see much more there for me to do. I expressed these feelings to him and wanted to let him know where my head was at and a possible option for us. I compiled all of this into a text and sent it to him to talk about on our nightly phone call. All he did was thumbs up the message. Which I thought was odd because he always sends a heart.

So night time comes and I get off work to give him a call. I called him before even realizing that he had sent me a long text message. He answers and I said “hi sorry I’m just now reading your text” I’m just going to summarize what was in the text: he basically got offered a job like 15 min away from his current job (in the same town and state that I DONT want to live at long term) and it offers 12k more than his current job plus commissions. Then lists off all the benefits and things and goes on to say that he can’t stand to be at his current job any longer and that he has to take this opportunity now and he can’t say no. He also states in the text how he doesn’t think moving to my parents guest house would be the “right environment” for him. He says that he “values independence and stability” and that he wouldn’t have that living with my parents. For context, he currently lives with his mother in a small town that has roughly 500 people in it and that might be too generous. 

I say that I’m proud of him and happy that he’s gotten this offer. He doesn’t let me know if our future plans to move out of state are still on the table or if we’re ever gonna move anywhere new once he’s gained the experience from this job. Just that this is good and I should be happy about this and this is a great next step in his career. I tell him multiple times that I am happy and excited for him but I also have a few reservations. I now feel unsure about moving back to the state that he’s from now because he’s making it sound like this is endgame and we’re not ever gonna leave when he knows I said I would really prefer not to live there. The idea of being in that state long term with no chance of really leaving gives me major anxiety and makes me a little nervous. Though I am proud of him for getting this offer I know my face shows these concerns I have brought up. So I state again that I’m happy for you but is there a future for us where we spread our wings together and find somewhere that’s fulfilling for both of us? I can see that he’s upset that I’m not just blindly happy about this and that I have questions. A lot of “I don’t know the future”, “I don’t know for sure”, and ,”why aren’t you happy for me \[my name\]?” I tell him over and over again that I am and I’m like I am happy I just have a few more questions about our future plans because these are starting to not sound like the ones I originally signed up for/ not the plan that we had agreed upon bc it would make us both happy. From the looks of it, only one of us would truly be growing while the other is only there for them and becomes stagnant in their growth. 

I do my best to explain all of this to him and he just continues to be like “why aren’t you happy for me… this is a good thing.” I tell him to stop putting words in my mouth because I never said that I wasn’t happy for you and I never said this is a bad thing. I just want us both to be able to grow in whatever environment that we’re in long term. I was okay with being here for a short period of time because I knew it was gonna be temporary, now the plans are changing and I am expressing some concerns that I have. After I say this he starts crying and saying “you’re not respecting my answers to your questions and you’re stressing me out..” I respond with “I’m stressed too I just want to understand where our future is headed/ what I’m I signing up for. I’m feeling unsure and uneasy about our plans changing and I just want to know that we’re going to be somewhere that benefits the both of us.” He says through tears “I feel like I can’t ever make you happy, I’m doing all of this to make you happy and you’re just not respecting my answers and what I have to do for my career.” I again asked him not to put words in my mouth and that “you make me the happiest person ever, that’s why I’m with you. You’re my best friend and I just want to know that in our future we’ll be somewhere where we’re both happy and fulfilled. I just wanted to have my concerns heard before you say yes to the job that sounds like we’re never going to get to where we said we were gonna go.. I just want to understand what that looks like if we take this next step.. I’m sorry I didn’t mean to stress you out bc I’m a little stressed too..” He then continued to say I’m stressing him out and he’s gonna hang up and go for a drive. Before he hangs up I ask “do you still want to be with me?” 

“Yes, I’m just stressed out”

“Okay I’m sorry I didn’t mean to stress you out, I love you”

“I love you too” and he hangs up. I then send a follow up text that I’ll copy and paste here:

“You do make me happy, the happiest. I was just not fully understanding where your head was at for the future. I freaked myself out with things that aren’t true and I’m sorry to stress you out. I’ll leave my ringer on if you want to call me but I won’t reach back out until you’re ready. I love you, goodnight <3”

His response:

“I’m just really disappointed and I need some time”

Me:

“Tate I’m really sorry, I just freaked myself out. You do make me happy, I just scared myself for no reason. I love you and I want to do this with you. I let the thoughts in my head cloud my mind and keep me from seeing all the good that’s happening.. I’m so sorry.

Please I’m so sorry, I didn’t mean to ruin it. I wasn’t thinking and should’ve just listened and trusted you instead of questioning everything and trying to solve everything on my own”

Him:

“Thank you for your apology”

\- I heart the message -

Me:

“Please I love you.. how can I make this right? I know I messed up and I shouldn’t have freaked out”

Him:

“We can talk tomorrow I’m just really upset”

Me:

“Okay I understand”

Him:

“Thx <3”

Never has he ever texted me “thanks” like this. 

Me:

“Do you still love me? Do you still want to be with me?”

Him:

“Yes, it’s just so hard when I try to better our future and get so excited and proud of what im doing and I get shutdown. I just really breaks my heart. I’m just heart broken right now”

Me:

“Okay, I understand. I recognize that it was not the time to be asking questions and it was a time for me to support and be there for you and worry about the other stuff later. I’m so sorry for doing that. I never ever, want to make you feel like you’re not good enough and I have NEVER thought that in my life. You’re everything to me Tate. I only want to care for you and your heart and I’m so sorry I’m hurting it right now. I never meant to. You’re my best friend and I never want to hurt you.” 

Him:

“Thank you baby”

Me: apologizing for hurting his feelings 

“I love you so much baby and words cannot express how sorry I am.”

Him:

“I love you too I just need some time to process I appreciate the apology but I’m just really hurt still”

Me:

“I’ll leave my ringer on if you want to call me before you go to sleep \[gif that we always send to each other when we’re sorry\]

No response- doesn’t even read it.

\-Next morning-

Me: 

“Good morning baby. I know you’re most likely still upset with how I handled things and that’s valid. I just want to apologize again for how I approached the situation. 

I should have framed it better and presented it as a concern rather than making it seem like you’re not doing enough. Because you are more than enough for me Tate. I never meant to make you feel like you weren’t. I’m so sorry for that. ❤️‍🩹

I know when the time is right we will move on a grow our family together and I need to stop trying to control everything and trust in us. It will all work out and we chose each other for this reason. You’re my best friend and my soul mate and I never ever want either one of us to feel like the other isn’t all in. I won’t let doubt cloud my judgement about our future again. I love you Tate and I’m so proud of the man you’re becoming. 🩷🫂”

No response for 6 hours (there’s a 7 hour time difference and I sent this in the morning which was the middle of the night for him) 

He’s been on his phone for well over an hour before even reading the texts. (Active on insta and snap)

He reads the text and doesn’t respond for 20 min. 

I saw that he read it and said:

“I already had work today so if you want to talk I’m available. I am getting coffee with a coworker but I can leave if you want to call me..” 

He read it and didn’t respond for 10 minutes.

Him:

“I’ve got a lot to think about I’m gonna pass today we can talk more tomorrow”

My heart falls out of my ass and I have a panic attack and excuse myself from my outing with my coworker. I break down once I get in the door of my flat because I genuinely can’t believe this is how he’s talking to me. He’s never ever been this cold or blatantly ignored my “I love yous.” We always say I love you no matter what. 

Me:

“Please Tate.. you’re my best friend. I can’t breathe” (because im having a panic attack)

Him:

“I just need my space today if you can please respect that”

I genuinely cannot believe this is happening. He’s never shut me out or completely shut down like this whenever we’ve had conflict. All I can think about is does he even love me anymore? Why is he treating me like this? 

I text him: 

“Why are you shutting me out like this? To hurt me too? You’re treating me like I cheated on you and cursed your whole family. I am hurting from this situation that we’re in too it feels like I’m the only one who wants to try and make it right between us again. Do you even love me anymore? You haven’t said it at all between these requests for space. I would feel better giving you the space if you would have reassured me with “I love you and I just need space to think right now” instead of “I’m gonna pass today..” the lack of love I’m feeling from you is really breaking my heart too Tate.”

Him:

“Yes \[my name\] I’m just hurting right now I told you I need space and you’re not listening to me. I’m hanging with my friend and I want to have a good day I cried all night last night I want to just relax and have time to myself”

Me:

“I am hurting too and instead of trying to come together you’re pushing me away and punishing me with silence and coldness. Leaving me alone to wonder if the person I love the most in this world even loves me back… do you know how much that hurts? 

You still haven’t said it back. 

I understand you’re hurting and I’m sorry. You’re not alone in feeling this way. I would, and have, always made sure in any conflict we’ve had to make sure that I you know that I still love you even if I was hurt/ upset. Never have I ever purposely put you on a loveless island with no explanation whatsoever. I would never treat you how you’re treating me right now Tate. I would never make you doubt my love for you and you know that.

I’ve been too crying ever since we last spoke. I had a full blown panic attack in front of my team and had to excuse myself. I’ve been hurting and upset just as much as you have but I still made an effort to communicate my feelings with you and reassure you that I love you and want this to work and all I’ve been met with is zero explanation, the silent treatment, and no reassurance or love from you.”

Him:

“I love you \[my name\] I just need time!”

I stopped responding because now I’m starting to feel purposefully disrespected and isolated. I feel now that I over apologized and that I’m doing everything to try and make things right and he’s just punishing me. I am sorry for hurting his feelings as those were not my intentions and I made sure I said it more than enough times and to let him know that I still love him and I’m proud of him. I’m the past we have always made sure to say I love you even if we were upset with one another and made sure the other knew their love never wavered. This reaction from him is completely out of the blue and it really hurts me how selfish he’s being right now. Whenever I have asked for space or for us to table a conflict he always has said “well now I don’t feel good. I want to figure this out now.” Or has put everything on hold until we feel good again. Now when I’m asking for us to fix things, I’m met with the cold shoulder. I would never do this to him. I feel like he’s kind of dragging this situation out and making it more than it is because I can’t just blindly go along for these plans that I’m essentially getting no say in now.. idk my heart hurts, my mind hurts, and I feel so alone..

Sorry this was so long

1qyqptl,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1qyqptl/how_to_sell_more_gift_cards/,How to sell more gift cards.,"**Gift card printer here. These 7 tips  make small businesses sell more gift cards (do's and don'ts).**

I work with a lot of small businesses across retail, food, fitness, and services, and gift cards are consistently one of the highest ROI products when they’re set up correctly. The problem is most businesses leave a lot of money on the table.

Here’s what I see work over and over.

**1. Make gift cards visible at checkout**  
The number one reason gift cards don’t sell is simple: customers don’t see them. Businesses that keep cards behind the counter or on the wall near the register sell significantly more than those that rely on “people will ask.”

**2. Offer low friction denominations**  
$10, $25, $50 outsell custom amounts by a wide margin. People don’t want to think. Give them fast choices.

**3. Physical cards still outperform digital locally**  
Digital is great for last minute gifting, but physical cards sell better in store. People like handing someone something tangible, especially for food, coffee, fitness, and experiences.

**4. Train staff to mention them naturally**  
A simple “We also have gift cards if you’re looking for a gift” at checkout works. No script. No pushiness. Businesses that do this consistently see noticeable lift.

**5. Tie gift cards to seasons, not discounts**  
Holiday, birthdays, teacher gifts, thank you gifts, client gifts. You don’t need to discount gift cards to sell them. You need to position them.

**6. Keep the system simple**  
Overly complex gift card setups reduce sales. Simple load at checkout, scan to redeem, done. The more friction there is internally, the less staff will promote them.

**7. Don’t overthink design**  
Clean branding beats flashy every time. Customers care more about ease of use than design details.

From the backend side, gift cards work because of:

* upfront cash flow
* partial redemptions
* overspend at redemption
* bringing in new customers

That’s why they continue to perform even when other marketing channels slow down.

\#1 and #5 are most important, IMHO.

If you’re a small business owner and gift cards aren’t selling, it’s almost never because “people don’t want them.” It’s almost always execution.

1qyqnby,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFapChristians/comments/1qyqnby/dose_anyone_have_these_symptoms/,Dose anyone have these symptoms,"Hello everyone, I apologize if this post is not appropriate, but I need your help. Since COVID, I lost my job and had a falling out with a close friend. I stayed at home and was not interested in doing any activities or going out for a while. To cope with the situation, I started watching porn and masturbating, spending over two hours almost daily. I went into a downward spiral, and my mental and physical health started deteriorating.

One day, I had to do some work outside under the sun. My chest started pounding, and I felt dizzy. I went inside, rested, drank some water and juice, and felt slightly better. But when I tried to get up and walk, my body started shaking, and I experienced extreme anxiety. I couldn’t sleep at night and had multiple panic attacks. I was so exhausted and anxious that I couldn’t even see a doctor. I called the lab to do blood work, and the results were

	•	Vitamin D3: 18 ng/mL

	•	Serum Sodium: 134.44 mmol/L

I started taking 5000 IU of Vitamin D3 daily with 200 mg of magnesium. After two months, I felt a little better, but then my symptoms returned. I couldn’t sleep due to extreme anxiety and nerve pain throughout my body, so I stopped taking Vitamin D3 and started getting as much sun as possible. Now, after four months, I retested my Vitamin D, and it was 38 ng/mL. I feel a little better, but I am still far from feeling normal.

My current symptoms include:

	•	Feeling tired and experiencing heart pounding with any physical activity

	•	Occasional anxiety

	•	Muscle twitches in different areas of my body

	•	Frequent skipped heartbeats

	•	Bone and muscle pain (less than before but still present)

	•	Episodes of depression

	•	Extreme sensitivity to caffeine (even two sips of coffee trigger severe anxiety)

	•	Waking up multiple times during sleep 

	•	Moving visceral pain (heart, stomach, kidneys)

Regarding porn and masturbation, I try to quit or do it as little as possible. However, my illness worsens my porn consuming because I have little else to do, and it helps temporarily with anxiety. But if I relapse, my anxiety returns stronger and lasts for three days with poor sleep, creating a never-ending cycle.

I also had weird symptoms like ear tinnitus and i found sitting in cars or driving is also nerve wracking and triggering anxiety,

I know porn addiction is bad overall but dose it really damage the nervous system or this stress and anxiety comes from long time vitamin d deficiency? 

I’m confused about the root cause, how long does recovery take? Could my stress be caused solely by Vitamin D deficiency? Has anyone experienced similar symptoms from Vitamin D deficiency alone?

1qyqmyv,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1qyqmyv/i_40f_connected_with_mutual_friend_43m_of_my/,I (40f) connected with mutual friend (43m) of my STBXH (47m) and then he disappeared. How can I get perspective on what happened and how to move forward?,"This is a long one, so bear with me. I’m (40f) going through a divorce currently and it’s been fairly acrimonious and somewhat abusive on the part of my STBXH (47m). Initially, I moved into the spare bedroom as we figured out next steps and for me to have a safe space. I don’t have any family here anymore, so I didn’t have anywhere to go until I figured out something more long term. Things had been bad for a long time, and he was increasingly abusive. He was triangulating our son, videotaping me and recording me and trying to say the most hurtful and hateful things to provoke a response so he could record me for “his case.” I was basically living in a nightmare and working from home most of the time, so I spent a lot of time in a tiny bedroom that also functioned as my office. 

Around this time, I started meeting up with a group of mutual friends of my STBXH, a group that initially was born out of several of our friends trying to navigate being newly single parents. We would all get together with and bring our kids and let the kids play video games while the parents hung out on the porch. STBXH and I would trade off on who would go after we decided that we were calling it quits. One of the women in the group is a long time friend of mine and we used to work together. I had not shared anything about what was going with anyone on and finally confided in her because I really needed some support. She then shared what I told her with the group (I didn’t know she was going to do that, but I’m fine with it), and they were all super supportive, listening to me vent, offering advice, and even offering me a spare room in their house until I could get out of there. The friend, J(43) that offered me a place to stay had also been friends with my STBXH for a long time. He acknowledged that, but knew that things were bad and knew how toxic that was, to not only me but to my son. 

I didn’t think much of it, other than it was so nice to have that offer in my back pocket and how much better I was feeling about my situation while having the support of my friends. My STBXH stopped going to the group hangs, so I got to go to all of them after that. Over time, although I couldn’t really place it then, I started to feel closer to J. We talked about mutual experiences, he shared some things that he went through with his ex and their initial issues with custody, etc. It felt good to be able to commiserate with someone, especially since our kids are a similar age so I could talk about concerns about how this could affect my son and how I could best support him. Everyone in the group offered advice and shared their experiences. But with J, it somehow felt more intimate? I don’t know how else to express it. 

Anyway, I eventually found a house I could afford, but it was being rehabbed so it would still be a little while before I could move out on my own, but there was a light at the end of the tunnel. 

I reached out to J one day just to check in because he was trying to quit smoking, and having been through that myself, I just wanted to extend some support. It’s really hard! Anyway, we were sort of bantering back and forth, in a friendly  bordering flirty manner and he asked if I wanted to get out of the house and grab a drink after work, as he didn’t gave his kid that week. I don’t really have a lot of friends aren’t married and/or have kids, so I was ecstatic to have an opportunity to get out of the tiny room that I basically spent all day and all night in everyday. I went over to his house after finishing up work and making dinner and we had some drinks and hung out in his backyard. And I had a great time! I felt safe and more like myself than I had felt in years. We laughed a lot, talked about our childhoods, our jobs, religion, awkwardness with our ex’s families. When it got a little cold, he brought me blanket. He showed me around his house and talked about the projects that he had done and what he was planning. At the end of the night, I told him that I was very grateful to get out of the house and he told me to give him a shout on the weeks that he doesn’t have his kid, because he’s usually free. I was on cloud 9, having gone from being super isolated and just trying to survive to having friends and support.

A couple weeks later, things at home had gotten really bad. I felt close to having a nervous breakdown, so I reached out to J and asked him if my son and I could possibly stay in his spare room for the night to get a reprieve. I also told him that if he felt weird about it, with him also being friends with my STBXH, I would completely understand. But he called me and told me to come over whenever. I told him I would make some soup for dinner and bring it over as a thank you. We ate, the kids played video games, and we hung out on the porch for just a little bit. Again, I don’t know how to explain it, but we just talked very easily and openly. I told him that I hoped that he knew that he is a good person and deserves to connect with someone who appreciates him and makes him happy and that I really hoped he found that (I know he’s been lonely). He asked if I wanted a hug, which I accepted. And then we collected our kids and went to sleep in our respective rooms. In the morning, I got up, got myself and my son ready, collected our things and got ready to go. He offered to make me coffee, which I declined. We chatted a little bit while our kids played. He and his kid were leaving town to go to a family wedding, but he told me that if I needed to stay again, to give him a call and he would put me in touch with his roommate. I gave him a hug and thanked him profusely for helping me get some space and a good night’s sleep and we left. 

I reached out to him a couple weeks later. No response. I didn’t worry about it because I figure he’s just busy. I reached out again a couple weeks later, again nothing. He skips one of our parent/kid group meetups. It started to appear that he was ghosting me. I reached out again a few weeks later to say that I valued our friendship and his support and if there was something I did, I would be happy to talk about it. Nothing. When I finally do see him at a parent/kid group meetup, he barely looks at me, hardly speaks to me, and spends most of the time being zoned out after drinking some kind of THC drink (he’s not a pot smoker). A month later, I see him at a meetup, and again, he has drank one of those THC drinks, so he’s super high and zoned out. He didn’t even look at me or say a word to me. I’m really hurt. I feel bad if I did something, but I just don’t understand what is going on. I thought we had a connection of some kind and I was so happy to have a friend that could actually hang out! Maybe it was more than that, I don’t know. I felt something. I think maybe he did too, but I don’t quite know him well enough to be sure. He hasn’t spoken about it to any of our mutual friends. 

Sorry for the long story. What do you think happened here? If he doesn’t want to talk to me, there’s nothing I can do about that. We will still see each other at our group hangouts, so I just feel so weird and unnerved about it all. I’m a pretty direct person, so this avoidance is baffling to me. How would you interpret all this? Is there a way to make it less awkward? Help?",6,1770501269.0,relationship_advice,3,1.0,False
1qyqmu9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qyqmu9,v60 troubleshooting,"Hi everyone,

I’m pretty new to brewing V60 and I could really use your help.

I’m using a Timemore C5 ESP Pro hand grinder. I’ve tried several different recipes, but very often my coffee turns out bitter with a kind of burnt or over-roasted taste. I experimented with grind size, and the bitterness and burnt notes mostly go away when I grind quite coarse.

Right now I’m using Lance Hedrick’s V60 recipe and it helped a lot, but I still feel like I’m doing something wrong.

Here’s my current setup and recipe:

15 g coffee

250 ml water

Water temperature: never above 92°C, usually around 88–90°C

Bloom: 45–50 ml for about 40–45 seconds

Then I pour the remaining \\\~200 ml in one pour

The drawdown is fairly fast, and the total brew time is around 1:40–1:45.

Despite this, I still sometimes get bitterness and a slightly burnt taste.

What should I try adjusting first — grind size, pouring technique, ratio, temperature, or something else?

It’s a super cute coffee house that serves breakfast/lunch food, and is located right in the heart of a pretty wealthy town. I joined the team as soon as they opened and so far, business has been great. 

When I took the job, I, along with my fellow baristas, were informed that our rate would be $14.00/hour. Minimum wage in my state is $16.00/hour, but they said the rest will be made up in tips. 

Long story short last week we all got our paychecks (they don’t have direct deposit set up yet) and noticed that our hourly rate was way off. We figured it was probably a mistake that would be fixed in next week’s check, so none of us brought it up. When we received this week’s paycheck and found that, once again, our rate was not normal. We all did a little math and realized that what they were paying us + our online tips makes up $16.00/hour. So those of us who made more in tips had less hourly rate. This only happened to us baristas, the cooks pay was not changed.

We got a message from our manager saying that they are holding a company meeting. Hopeful they’ll explain what the situation is! In the meantime, I am very curious if something similar to this has happened to anyone else? Is this normal for new coffee shops? ",4,1770501085.0,barista,4,1.0,False

The clarity of your prompt directly shapes the quality of your video.

But if you type something detailed like “show AI automation taking over business tasks with screens lighting up and a futuristic mood,” the tool knows exactly what to build.

You provide the vision.

This removes the two biggest barriers for most people: lack of editing skill and lack of time.

1qyqg34,https://www.reddit.com/r/PEI/comments/1qyqg34/an_open_concern_about_family_doctor_burnout/,"An open concern about family doctor burnout, Health PEI leadership, and patient care.","I’m going to say some things that haven’t really been said all too publicly. I’ll be careful with how I word this.

***Note:*** **I'm not a physician, nor am I speaking on behalf of any organization - this is based on personal observation, conversations with family doctors, and publicly available reporting. I know people will disagree with parts of this - that’s okay. I’m sharing this because I care deeply about patient care and the doctors providing it.**

# The Current Landscape?

Family doctors aren’t fighters. They’re not wired for confrontation. They’re fixers and helpers who will work themselves into the ground for patients. That makes them uniquely vulnerable when they’re dealing with leadership that’s politically skilled, institutionally protected, and very good at deflecting accountability.

Most doctors just want to practice medicine. Instead, for the past couple of years, a huge amount of their energy has been burned worrying about Health PEI pressures, shifting demands, and political priorities - including being leaned on to help “fix” a broken system. Well, that's not exactly what they go to school for! Add in the pressure for them to bail out what I see as an expensive, politically driven UPEI medical school project that has created unrealistic expectations, and morale is as low as I’ve ever seen it across the several family doctors close to me.

I’ve seen first-hand how Health PEI has pushed stress levels even higher for family physicians already working 50-60 hours a week in an extremely demanding, technical profession. These doctors were already operating at the limit. From what I’ve seen, things have significantly worsened during CEO Melanie Fraser’s tenure.

# The Relationship Between Doctors and Health PEI

For transparency, I’m familiar with the recent letter signed by 100+ doctors [referenced in this recent CBC article](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-family-doctors-relationship-health-authority-strained-9.7074554) and the circumstances around it *(note: in this article it appears CBC may have hyperlinked an article to a different letter)*.

**The letter appears to have reached the media against the wishes of many of the physicians who signed it.** It was meant as good-faith communication, not a public confrontation. Doctors are acutely aware of where the power sits here on PEI. About it I'll say this: when roughly 100 family physicians - likely a near-majority of physicians on PEI - are willing to sign something like that, it's them screaming S.O.S. And frankly, in my opinion, the letter held back significantly on the depth of concern many physicians have about Health PEI's bureaucracy and leadership, including Melanie Fraser, and in their defense, understandably so: they're writing it to their bosses!

In my opinion, Melanie Fraser’s handling of the physicians master agreement negotiations - and her broader approach to “collaboration” with family doctors - *has* been deeply damaging. From what I’ve witnessed, there’s been a pattern of political maneuvering, optics-first decisions, and pressure that has steadily reduced trust and made doctors increasingly hesitant to speak up. Anyone who’s been close to this process will recognize it immediately.

# The Push for Greater Panel Sizes (i.e. patient loads)

The push to increase patient panel sizes shows exactly where priorities are. This is being framed as a solution to the growing patient registry problem. In my view, yes, this is likely politically motivated. Recruitment can’t happen fast enough in a political cycle, so the responsibility gets dumped on family doctors instead. The idea that doctors can just shorten visits to see more people ignores reality. If that were possible without consequences, obviously it would already have happened.

To make this work, doctors are may be forced to attempt to trade quality for quantity. Rushed care instead of attentive care. Missed details instead of prevention. Patients are going to feel the effects of that - when care gets rushed, people’s health suffers.

For context, \~37,000 Islanders are currently on the registry - that's one in five Islanders. But this doesn’t just affect them. This current approach takes our finite medical capacity and spreads it thinner, meaning the four in five Islanders who *do* have doctors will see their care and access get worse, no matter how hard those doctors try. That’s the part that isn’t being said loudly enough. Burn-out and a system that's going to collapse in on itself is the end result. More doctors leaving, more doctors scaling back, more doctors retiring early, and fewer doctors wanting to enter a system that’s becoming harder to justify entering!

As has been reported publicly, [*some medical residents have said increased patient loads may influence their decision to look to practice away from family medicine or away from PEI*](https://www.saltwire.com/prince-edward-island/medical-residents-say-they-may-leave-pei-because-of-proposed-patient-load). Anecdotally, I’m aware of residents who have already decided to practice elsewhere. This outcome was foreseeable, particularly given that [*experienced doctors have been vocal with Health PEI about the struggles with increased patient loads*](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-physician-services-agreement-workload-pushback-9.7058913).

**Let's do some simple math:** For instance, for a doctor to take on a single new patient from the registry, this often requires multiple longer initial visits and follow-ups just to get caught up. That can easily be several times the workload of an existing patient.

Spread across roughly 200 family doctors, the registry works out to \~185 new patients per doctor - which is simply not realistic.

Compare that to recruiting new doctors who gradually build panels from the registry. Slower, yes - but it protects the system we already have.

Logically, we stand to lose more under this approach than to make any meaningful gains.

# Leadership in Question

**In terms of the recent article** [**""CEO says Health P.E.I. leaders should not be harassed over government decisions""**](https://www.saltwire.com/prince-edward-island/health-pei-ceo-says-leaders-should-not-be-harassed-over-government-decisions#selection-1545.0-1545.79)

I'll start with, people should absolutely refrain from abuse or threats, and I do not condone any of that towards anyone. Civility is key.

To Melanie Fraser's words - in terms of what I perceived as finger pointing and deflection - if the response is that leadership is simply following political direction, well, that doesn’t remove accountability. If you know policies are harming doctors, patient care, and the health system and you keep delivering them anyway, that’s still a choice. And in my opinion, it reflects very poorly on the leadership making it. History hasn’t looked kindly on leaders who attempt to avoid accountability by saying they were ""just following orders"".

>""*We are not decision-makers nor politicians.*""

Melanie, you are the CEO. Being a decision-maker is core to that role by definition. And frankly, based on what has been publicly visible and experienced by physicians, by most measures you appear to be a politician too.

# What We Can Do

I'm begging islanders to rally behind the amazing family doctors we still have. It doesn't appear they are able to speak up for themselves freely and openly against Health PEI's leadership who control the narrative.

Let's show our family doctors they're appreciated, that we recognize they're human beings rather than robots, and that PEI is a welcoming thankful place to practice and care for us all. After all, they save lives - and chances are, every one of us will need them at some point. Right now, I think they need us.

**What we can do:**

* **Write to your MLA to focus on RECRUITMENT rather than burn-out.**
* **Post online about a doctor you deeply appreciate, an amazing story, and share other's posts.** Let the world see that Islanders care about our doctors. I can tell you first-hand, our doctors are rarely thanked or properly celebrated - and they'll never ask for it.
* **Go tell your doctor you stand with them and appreciate them, perhaps see what help THEY need for once. Tell them thank you. Bring them a coffee or treat.**

**TL;DR:**  
Doctors are being used to prop up a broken system for political optics. It’s burning them out, likely worsening care for the four-in-five Islanders who already have doctors, and leadership can’t dodge accountability by saying they’re “just following orders.”

1qyq1ss,https://www.reddit.com/r/focusedmen/comments/1qyq1ss/the_psychology_of_productivity_how_doing_less/,The psychology of productivity: how doing less gets you more (science-based),"I used to think productivity meant cramming 47 tasks into my calendar and surviving on coffee and spite. Spoiler: I was spectacularly wrong. After burning out twice (because apparently I'm a slow learner), I dove into research from neuroscience, psychology, and people who actually get shit done without losing their minds. Turns out, the whole ""hustle harder"" narrative? It's basically a scam that benefits everyone except you.

Here's what nobody tells you: your brain isn't designed for endless multitasking and productivity theater. It's designed for focused bursts of deep work followed by actual rest. Society glorifies being busy, but being busy and being productive are completely different things. Most of us are just performing busyness while our actual goals collect dust.

The real game changer isn't doing more. It's ruthlessly eliminating the stuff that doesn't matter and going deep on what does.

\*\*1. Stop confusing activity with achievement\*\*

This hit me like a truck when I read ""[Essentialism](https://www.amazon.com/Essentialism-Disciplined-Pursuit-Greg-McKeown/dp/0804137382�)"" by Greg McKeown (Wall Street Journal bestseller, recommended by everyone from Tim Ferriss to major Fortune 500 CEOs). McKeown spent years researching why some people accomplish more while appearing to do less. His answer? They say no to literally everything except their highest priorities.

The book will make you question everything you think you know about success. It's not about time management, it's about energy management and life design. Best productivity book I've ever read, hands down.

McKeown introduces this concept called ""the 90% rule."" If an opportunity isn't a hell yes (like 90% or above), it's a no. Most of us operate at 60% yesses and wonder why we're exhausted and mediocre at everything.

\*\*2. Your attention is your most valuable currency\*\*

Cal Newport's ""Deep Work"" (won multiple productivity awards, Newport is a Georgetown computer science professor who's published six books while barely using social media) breaks down why the ability to focus is becoming rare and therefore extremely valuable.

The thesis is simple but powerful: the work that creates real value requires uninterrupted concentration. Yet we've built a world that makes deep focus nearly impossible. Slack notifications, email, meetings about meetings. It's all productivity theater.

Newport argues that deep work sessions (90 to 120 minutes of zero distraction) produce exponentially better results than 8 hours of distracted busy work. I started blocking off 2 hour chunks with my phone in another room and genuinely shocked myself with what I could accomplish. This book is insanely good if you're tired of feeling scattered.

\*\*3. The 80/20 rule will change your entire approach\*\*

Most of your results come from a tiny fraction of your efforts. Like 20% of your actions produce 80% of your outcomes. Tim Ferriss popularized this in ""The 4 Hour Workweek"" but the concept comes from economist Vilfredo Pareto.

Look at your task list. Actually look at it. How many of those things will move the needle on your actual goals? Probably like 3 out of 47. The rest is just noise and obligation and shit you think you ""should"" do.

I started doing weekly audits where I list everything I did and rate each task's actual impact. The results were embarrassing. I was spending 70% of my time on stuff that produced maybe 10% of my results. Once you see this pattern you can't unsee it.

\*\*4. Your environment controls you more than willpower ever will\*\*

If you're relying on discipline and motivation, you've already lost. Willpower is a finite resource that depletes throughout the day. James Clear covers this brilliantly in ""Atomic Habits"" (New York Times bestseller, over 10 million copies sold, recommended by basically every productivity expert alive).

Clear is a habits researcher who broke down thousands of studies on behavior change. His framework is stupid simple: make good behaviors obvious, easy, attractive, and satisfying. Make bad behaviors invisible, difficult, unattractive, and unsatisfying.

Want to work out more? Sleep in your gym clothes. Want to stop doomscrolling? Delete the apps or use Focus filters on your phone. Your environment is either working for you or against you. There's no neutral.

The book also destroys the myth that you need massive changes to see results. He proves that 1% improvements compound into remarkable outcomes over time. This is the best book on habit formation that actually works in real life.

\*\*5. Rest isn't optional, it's strategic\*\*

This might sound counterintuitive in a productivity post but hear me out. Your brain needs downtime to process information and generate insights. Alex Soojung Kim Pang's research (he's a Stanford scholar who studied peak performers across industries) shows that the most productive people work less than average but accomplish more.

They take breaks. Real breaks, not scrolling breaks. They sleep 8 hours. They have hobbies that have nothing to do with their work. This isn't self care fluff, it's performance optimization.

I started using the [Finch](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/finch-self-care-pet/id1528595748) app to track my rest and energy levels alongside my productivity. It's this weirdly wholesome habit building app with a little bird companion that grows as you take care of yourself. Sounds childish but it actually helped me realize I was running on fumes most days and calling it ""grinding.""

If you want a more structured approach to actually learning this stuff instead of just knowing it, there's this AI learning app called [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) that pulls from productivity books, research papers, and expert insights to create personalized audio learning plans. You type in something like ""I'm constantly overwhelmed and want to build better productivity systems as someone who gets distracted easily,"" and it generates a custom plan with episodes you can adjust from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with examples. It also has a virtual coach you can chat with about your specific struggles. The depth customization is clutch because sometimes you just need the highlights, other times you want to really understand the neuroscience behind why certain strategies work.

\*\*6. Single tasking is your competitive advantage\*\*

Multitasking is a lie sold to us by people who profit from our distraction. Your brain literally cannot focus on two complex tasks simultaneously. What you're actually doing is task switching, which tanks your performance and increases errors by up to 50% according to research from Stanford and University of Michigan.

Every time you switch tasks, there's a cognitive cost called ""attention residue."" Part of your brain is still thinking about the previous task. So when you're checking email during a meeting while also trying to finish a report, you're operating at maybe 30% capacity for all three things.

The solution is boring but effective: one thing at a time. Close the tabs. Put the phone away. Tell people you're unavailable. The work gets done faster and better.

\*\*7. Learn to leverage constraints\*\*

Parkinson's Law states that work expands to fill the time available. Give yourself 8 hours for a task and it'll take 8 hours. Give yourself 2 hours and suddenly you find a way.

I started using the Pomodoro Technique (25 minute focused sprints) through an app called Forest. You plant a virtual tree that grows during your focus session and dies if you leave the app. It's gamified productivity that actually works because the constraint forces you to focus.

Time constraints force prioritization. They eliminate perfectionism and busywork. They create urgency that activates your brain's problem solving mode.

\*\*8. Batch similar tasks and eliminate decision fatigue\*\*

Your brain burns glucose making decisions. Every choice, no matter how small, depletes your mental energy. This is why Obama and Zuckerberg wear the same outfit every day. Fewer decisions means more mental bandwidth for important stuff.

Group similar tasks together. Answer all emails in one block. Do all your calls on specific days. Meal prep on Sundays. The transitions between different types of work are expensive cognitive switching costs.

Also, automate and systematize everything possible. If you do something more than twice, create a process. Use templates, checklists, and routines so your brain can run on autopilot for low stakes stuff.

\*\*9. Protect your peak performance windows\*\*

You have about 2 to 4 hours per day of genuine peak cognitive performance. For most people it's morning, but some people are night owls. Figure out when your brain works best and guard that time like it's sacred.

This is when you do your hardest, most important work. Not meetings. Not admin tasks. Not emails. Your highest leverage activities only.

I started treating my 9am to 11am window as completely untouchable. No meetings, no calls, no Slack. Just deep work on whatever moves my goals forward most. Changed everything.

\*\*10. Measure outcomes not hours\*\*

Nobody cares that you worked 80 hours if you accomplished nothing meaningful. Results are what matter. Impact is what matters. Yet we're stuck in this industrial era mindset where presence equals productivity.

Start tracking what you actually produce, not how long you sit at your desk. Did you finish the project? Did you solve the problem? Did you create value? Those are the only questions that matter.

This shift in perspective is liberating. You stop feeling guilty about working 5 focused hours instead of 10 distracted ones. You start optimizing for effectiveness over busyness.

The paradox of productivity is that trying to do everything means accomplishing nothing important. Your breakthrough won't come from adding more to your plate. It'll come from clearing the plate and focusing on the few things that actually matter.

Most productivity advice is just adding more complexity to an already chaotic system. Real productivity is subtraction, not addition. It's about identifying the essential and eliminating everything else. Once you understand that, everything changes.",1,1770499844.0,focusedmen,0,1.0,False
1qyq11p,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1qyq11p/how_do_you_reconcile_hobby_spending_in_the/,How do you reconcile hobby spending in the context of your income and savings goals?,"I’ve wanted a project car for about a decade now, and can technically afford one on paper, but have always struggled with the concept of getting into a new long-term hobby that dwarfs all my other hobby spending by probably a factor of at least 10.  The older I’ve gotten, the more I have prioritized our spending and saving habits around home renovation, family, and health.  Whereas my current established hobbies are closer in total sunk cost to a short vacation to Europe, this project car would be more in the realm of a brand new kitchen.

I have a specific make and model in mind which, as of this post, would entail an initial cost in the $15-25k range for the car alone, depending on condition. From there, insurance will be measurable. I’d also be looking at ongoing parts/ maintenance/ consumables costs, as well as some initial spend in the realm of tools and equipment. And the last thing I’d say about the car is that, while I’d love to be pleasantly surprised, this specific car wouldn't be a financial investment…simply an expenditure. It’s not a classic muscle car or something where there’s a world in which I get a bunch of money back if I eventually sell it decades from now. I’m eyes-wide-open planning on it being a financial loss at the trade-off of being an enjoyable way to spend my time for years and years to come. A “thing” that is also an experience.  Connecting with local community at cars and coffee, attending track day events, spending countless weekends wrenching with buddies, and more. I love cars and I love tinkering/ wrenching. Having my own to fix up, learn about, customize, and pour this passion into is the dream.

To contextualize the anticipated cost of said project car against the rest of my life: I’m 35. I currently make a salary in the low six figures, and my wife’s in the mid six figures. We have about $80k in liquid savings, which is increasing at the rate of 20% of our take-home pay per year.  We both have healthy 401ks which we started right out of college that are getting at least 5% plus employer match at any given time—plus some other employer-specific ESOP and pension type stuff.  No meaningful debt at the moment other than a 30 year mortgage; most of it still to go, and a rate in the low 3s. Commuter car is paid off (and might outlive me), no credit card debt, no student loans. Feels morbid to think about, but, both our families are financially stable so as people start to pass in the coming decades (and, knock wood, not sooner) we’d be looking at some kind of inheritance windfall of paid off houses and savings.

I’m not worried about having buyer’s remorse about the car itself nor my experience with it; I know myself well enough that having a project car has crossed from being something I used to daydream about in my 20s, to now being more akin to a life goal. What I do worry about, and what I think had stopped me from pulling the trigger so far, is the feeling of guilt for not opting to spend this much money on something else more “adult” like home renovation (especially where, arguably, there’s ROI), or even literally even just investing the cash equivalent of what I would spend on the car into something high yield or an existing retirement plan if for no other reason/ purpose than the overall long-term financial security of my family.

My wife and I live in a 1906 brick home that seems like it will always and gladly accept pretty much as much money as we’re collectively comfortable pouring into it. Unlike the project car, the home is an investment.  It’s in great shape due to previous owners having taken care of it, and we plan to continue that pattern of treating it right and increasing its value over time. But if you know anything about old homes, the limit does not exist on what you can spend on them. Plus all the normal stuff that comes with the territory of owning a home.  Bathrooms need renovated, a new roof will be a cool $30k minimum, so on and so forth.

And so hopefully by this point in the post you start to see my moral dilemma: I have the money to pull the trigger on this project car tomorrow…but at what cost to our future plans for the house, family needs, or a major health issue? And for probably about 10 times the cost of my next most expensive current hobby, if not more. It just feels so much in its own realm of lighting money on fire for the sake of personal satisfaction, when there are so many other things in life that I could spend that same money on.  

When I think about this topic, I often fall into fantasy scenarios of finding a way to pay for the project car in some hypothetically ""guilt-free"" way.  ""If I just grind nights and weekends outside of my 9-5 for \[a long time, probably\], I could use the surplus cash to buy this car without having to take from the savings I have set aside for my family and home.""  Or, ""Maybe I can read up on investing, and find a way to increase my current savings by the amount I need to pay for this car, so that it's basically \[air quotes\] free"".  But then the daydream fades back to reality.  I'm very unlikely to stumble upon some 'get rich quick' opportunity.  I would probably run out of energy and the will to live before I made enough money working nights and weekends to pay for this car.  And even if I did, at the end of the day, I'd still be opting to spend that financial boon on something frivolous instead of something traditionally wise.

Where do you draw the line on hobby spending? When you have reasonable expenses and plenty of other opportunities to spend savings, how much is too much to spend on a hobby? If you bought a project car, or something similar in that price range...I don't know-- a small boat? A horse? How much do horses cost? ...something like that—were you able to justify it to yourself in the long run?  Do you just one day find comfort in having made the decision, and try not to dwell on what could have been?

Finally, an editorial comment: I already know that if you are not a car person, you probably do not understand this post. Maybe consider my dilemma more generally in the context of some discretionary expense around that same price point, one that feels more relevant to you.",1,1770499798.0,personalfinance,19,0.67,False
1qypzrs,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1qypzrs/tifu_not_immediately_swapping_out_my_old_rusty/,TIFU not immediately swapping out my old rusty cart at Jewel-Osco,"I have this minor grudge against Jewel-Osco. It's nothing that will stop me from shopping there for deals or anything, I just hate their forced digital coupon system and think it's super predatory on their customers and obnoxious. Their stores are also kinda cheap looking and man do those shopping carts suck some major butt. 

In the most ironic of shopping experiences today, all of my gripes against Jewel-Osco struck me like a wombo combo and gave me the most hilariously miserable shopping experience possible. I couldn't help but write this down and share with the internetz. 

I totally forgot to swap my prescription shades for my normal glasses, realizing this only after walking through the doors with a cart. I gave zero fucks and let it rip anyway. In retrospect wearing sunglasses probably made me look even stranger to the casual observer, as I will soon get to. 

The first mistake was grabbing an Americano at the Starbucks by the entrance. I recalled remembering that their shopping carts had cupholders, but to my dismay this was not the case. ""No problem"", I'm thinking. I can just steer the cart with one arm and hold the coffee in my other. Ain't no thing. Sure, I could have gone back outside and gotten another, but it seemed bearable and this place was hella crowded. 

I arrive at the first item on my list in the produce section. ""Small Avocados...$0.39 ea for six!? Hell yea!"", I think. Then I see that it's digital coupon only. All I can think is, ""How the fuck am I supposed to use my phone when one of my arms is stuck holding this coffee and the other is required to steer?"". I decide to wait until later when I can maybe get into a low-traffic area and just clip all the digital coupons at once. 

I soon realize that this cart is the worst of the worst. Not only is it incredibly difficult to turn, requiring some rear-wheel-one-armed drifting for 90 degree corners (there were many close calls where I was convinced I would hit another customer or their cart), but every 6 ft or so the wheels would make this obnoxiously loud squeak. It was loud enough to make people blatantly glance at me mid-shopping. At least I had on sunglasses I guess?

I proceed to find deals on something like five of the items on my list, all digital. By the time I got to the cheese slices I was able to leave the cart for a second with the coffee propped in the child seat. ""Might as well scan this one while I'm here"", I think. Error message. Thing won't scan. I searched up the cheese, wasting a few other people's time as I'm now clogging up the cheese aisle. It worked, and I proceeded on. I forgot about the coffee until the next bump and spilled a bunch on the cart, my items, and my coat. I couldn't help but laugh, adding to the perception of being mildly insane to those around me. 

The store was so crowded on the day before Superbowl that there were almost no places to stop without log jamming the people behind me with their carts. I did it anyway, because I was not about to be bested by JO's BS digital coupon value deterrence system. There were a few stretches where I tried to (poorly) balance the coffee while swiping on my phone for coupons just to accelerate GTFOing and spilled a bit of coffee, but it seemed worth it and mildly comical so I let it rip. 

Mountain Dew Zero, buy two get two free? Seems like a good time to buy four. I stashed them on the bottom rack of the cart, ready to finally check out. 

I soon realize that the bumpy cart combined with the need to Tokyo Drift this thing just to take corners resulted in a falling 12 pack of Mountain Dew Zero, mid aisle with annoyed people behind me. Eventually I just started taking the turns absurdly slow, making the shoppers around me even happier. 

Finally I clip the Mountain Dew coupon, but the app says ""Buy two get THREE free"". I have four...so which is it? I decided to leave this dumpster fire of a cart near the checkout aisle and grab a fifth just in case. 

As I go to checkout, the cashier asked me how my shopping experience was. I said ""Man, it was a total disaster; trying to wheel this shitty bumpy cart that won't turn while holding the coffee I have to carry due to the lack of cupholder all while clipping digital coupons is really hard."" Her eyes glazed over as if I were an Orthodox Catholic Priest halfway through a 87 minute sermon. She asked no follow up questions. 

Good thing I got that fifth 12 pack though, I wouldn't have gotten the coupon at all and would have paid $48 for four instead of $24 for five. The total price was pretty damn low. That part was nice. 

Upon walking this rusty tin shit-wheeler through the automatic doors, I realize that the bumps could present an issue. I chose to lower my center of gravity a bit to stabilize the cart/coffee combo and walk quite slowly to my car which was about 800 feet away. The parking lot was extraordinarily pot-holey, making me choose the lesser of a bad hole multiple times. The bumps of the cart, without this potholes, has already dislodged one of the 12 packs, which I picked up off the ground while almost getting ran over by someone reversing, probably because I was underneath their reverse cam at this point. I proceed to lose the 12 pack one more time, and a different one a third time before making it to my trunk. 

TLDR: Somehow, on this specific day, the Universe gave me everything I hate about Jewel-Osco at the same time: shitty carts with no cupholders and digital coupons, causing a hilariously terrible shopping experience. At least I kept my cool and left my sunglasses on. ",0,1770499713.0,tifu,0,0.33,False

1qypzeh,https://i.redd.it/325927qk45ig1.jpeg,"Ossoff Calls Out Trump’s Cruelty, Arrogance, and Incompetence","“All across Georgia, more and more people of every background and belief reject the chaos and corruption.

It’s not just Democrats and Independents. Republicans take me aside, or they call me on the phone. They tell me they’re afraid of where this president has taken us, and they don’t want it to go on. They tell me they’re voting for a Democrat for the first time.

And it’s no mystery why.

This is the cruelest and most arrogant group of people who have ever ascended to high office in the United States. And their cruelty and their arrogance are matched only by their incompetence.

The president said he’d bring down prices on day one. Instead, his tariffs keep driving prices higher and higher.

Since he took office, coffee is up 20 percent. Ground beef and the power bill both up 13 percent. Apples up 10 percent. I could go on. All in one year.

Unemployment is rising too. Listen to this.

American manufacturing jobs have shrunk nearly every single month since Trump rolled out his tariffs. Last month, more Americans lost their jobs than any January in seventeen years.

And while prices are going up and jobs are getting harder to find, they decided to let health insurance premiums double for more than twenty million Americans, including more than a million Georgians.

1qypyjw,https://www.reddit.com/r/halifax/comments/1qypyjw/fairwaylab_new_sim_review/,FairwayLab - New Sim Review,"Here is my review of the new 24/7 golf sim that just opened in Cole Harbour.

Some disclaimers: I suck at golf, as much as I don't want to, I am a sub par golfer, pun very much intended.

They have 4 bays.   
2 open bays with Trackman IO.  
1 semi private bay with Trackman 4  
1 fully private bay also with Trackman 4

The bays itself are bigger than what I am used to which is great. It could just be that the screens are brand new, but the image seems crisper than what I have seen elsewhere not by much but noticeable. 

the T4 bays also come with some AI stuff that is way above my pay grade. When I took lessons at Golftec out west what they used reminded me of what I saw at FairwayLab. I can see the usefulness during lessons or if you are a golf person to work on your swing. At my stage, its cool to see but my level is not high enough to appreciate the value that it brings. Trackman 4 does bring in more data that I appreciate- angle of attack for one, so there is some value in there for the bad golfers out there.

Everything right now is new, so I guess the real test will be in 3/4 months to see how often the freshen up the mats. Clubhouse is great at that piece, 7 Irons not so much.

Pricing is on par with other 24/7 sims around the city. Their standard bay mid day on the weekend is $35/hour. Other bays are more expensive, and they all have dynamic pricing in case you feel like golfing at 2AM.

Conclusion: Fantastic location. You should not drive past FairwayLab to go to a different sim! The bays are great, you get the standard bottled water on the house - in addition they also have a automatic coffee machine, mocha is very good. 4.5 out of 5 I do recommend.

Questions:

\*I'm a little worried about booking Burj Khalifa tickets so close to our flight time. We arrive in Dubai at 3:55 p.m... is it feasible that we would make it to Burj Khalifa for 6 p.m. sunset tickets? Or should I move this to another day?

We are well prepared for modest dress, but I'm a little worried about our day trip to Wadi Shab. Right now, the most modest swimwear I can conjure up is a swim skirt with a long-sleeved rash guard (in other words, my legs would be exposed from mid-thigh down. Is this going to be a problem?

According to the internet, it's possible to attend iftar at Sheikh Zayed and Sultan Qaboos mosques as non-Muslims (happy to offer a donation if that's appropriate), but does anyone have experience doing this?

Is Dubai going to be really crazy on Eid? Anything in particular we need to know?

1qypsoe,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1qypsoe/the_piano_in_the_basement/,The Piano in The Basement,"The house was large and cheap. That’s why I bought it. I wasn’t thinking.

Even all these years later, I still kick myself over my impatience—over my unwillingness to just wait and buy a house of higher quality.

Ultimately, I still blame myself for what happened in that home. I could have chosen to leave. I could have done a lot of things differently, but I didn’t.

What I experienced in that house will likely stay with me until the day I die.

I graduated from high school in June of 2006. Like many kids in my grade, I hadn’t yet put together a concrete plan for my future. Unlike a fair few of the other kids in my grade, I hadn’t yet needed to worry about my future.

You see, just a few months before I graduated, my parents died. In the months the leading up to my graduation, I came to terms with it—accepted they were gone.

While I, in my teenage years, might not have had much to show in the way of financial success, they’d flourished. My mother was our town’s dentist and my father was a therapist with a PhD in Psychology. To say the least, they were good at what they did.

Now, that isn’t to say that I didn’t make money. I had a few odd jobs here and there, but nothing stuck. I wasn’t a bad kid. In fact, I’d say that, of all my friends, I was the best behaved. Maybe that’s why they did it.

When I told them that I wanted to major in English studies, they couldn’t have been prouder. My grandfather was writer, and a pretty good one at that. He was a good man, too. I respected him a great deal and looked up to him. Even these days when people ask, I always say that he was my inspiration for going into the English field.

Perhaps my parents knew that the field I wanted to major in wouldn’t yield significant financial success. Maybe that’s why they did it. Perhaps it was simply because they loved me and I was an only child. Perhaps it was because I was—and still am their son.

Maybe that’s why I was the sole heir to everything. Their house, their belongings, their savings. All of it, to me. I was over 18 when they passed, so there wasn’t a need to wait for a certain age threshold to be passed. I’d crossed over any potential line.

The inheritance was mine. I can’t remember exactly how much money I got from them, but it was a sizable chunk for a recent high school graduate. It was enough to keep me living comfortably for a few years.

It wasn’t until four years after I graduated that I decided to sell their house. Between payments for it and payments for room and board at the university I attended, it was beginning to put a strain on my mental health. Financially, however, I remained stable.

The constant payments weren't the only reason I found myself wanting out of the house, though. The longer I stayed in that home, the more and more I began to sense an endless air of hopelessness within its walls. My parents had passed away in a car accident. They were on the way home from meeting up with a family friend when a drunk driver blindsided and T-boned my father’s car.

I never did see the bodies, but that wasn’t because I chose not to. The authorities and coroners were only able to identify my parents by the I.D. cards in their wallets. The funeral was closed casket.

The nightmares were another cause for my wanting to sell the house. Every night leading up to my graduation, I’d have vivid nightmares. Scenarios of what my brain thought my parents had gone through in their final moments. I never did see when the crash would occur, though. Every time that car made contact with them, I’d jolt awake in a cold sweat. I didn’t know if my parents ever found closure, wherever they’d gone after the accident, but I did know one thing.

In the time between their deaths and my living in that new house, I never did find closure. The spirit that was the death of my parents haunted me greatly.

But it wasn’t the only thing to do that.

In September of 2010, I made the decision to finally start truly living on my own. I’d graduated from my University with a bachelor’s degree in English. I’d decided to finally become a writer like my grandfather before me.

The only problem was that writing didn’t exactly make for a great career if it didn’t immediately take off. I did not immediately take off. I’d uploaded some of my writings, mostly horror, to several sites and writing blogs. WordPress was my best friend during that time, allowing me to post many different writings all under the same blog.

Of course, none of them took off in the ways I’d hoped they would, but I was prepared for that.

I’d managed to get a job at a bank near my university. Luckily for me, they allowed me to come in part time as I was a student. During breaks and other periods of free time, I worked full-time. When I graduated and got my degree, I’d managed to keep the job at the bank and kept working and saving for the next two months.

The money I’d made working, plus the remaining funds from my inheritance gave me a—once again—sizable chunk to spend. With my parents house sold and my room and board no longer being *my* room and board, I figured it was finally time to look for a place to settle down.

To my complete surprise, I found a large home in the same town where I’d been working. It was no colonial, I’ll say that much. But for a single person, it  was larger than anything I could have imagined. And it was cheap, too.

As for why I never asked about the price, I’ll tell you. I was a recently graduated, depressed orphan who couldn’t get his writing to take off for anything worth a damn. I wasn’t thinking clearly, so to speak. The house was cheap, it was big, and I hadn’t a thought in my head besides the two of those things when I bought it in October of 2010.

I never got to receive an official tour of the house, but that was one of the thoughts closer to the back of my mind as I explored my new home. One thing the realtor did tell me about was the basement.

“There’s a piano down there,” she said.

When I pried for more information, she actually told me more instead of being reserved like I thought she’d be.

“That’s where the previous owner died,” she told me. “That’s why the house is so cheap. Because the previous owner never got to sell it. But, you know, someone dying in there doesn’t exactly help with jacking up the price.”

“Damaged goods,” I remember telling her.

“That’s a good way to put it,” she replied.

She never told me how the previous owner passed, or the circumstances surrounding it. Luckily, or unluckily for me, I’d find that out anyways. But not from the realtor. Just a few days after I bought the house, she disappeared completely. Didn’t go missing, I just never saw her again after that. Could never contact her.

I suppose I could have expended some more time and effort in finding her, but looking back, it didn’t matter then, and it doesn’t matter now.

Just before she vanished, the realtor also told me about how spacious the basement was. She described making it into a study where I could write. Made sense, considering I’d told her I was an up and coming writer and all. I told her I would just turn one of the upstairs rooms into a study. I never was the biggest fan of basements, and the fact that someone had died in this one didn’t quite sit right with me. I wouldn’t be able to focus, I knew that much.

I didn’t know just yet what I’d do to implement a room such as a study in the house, but that was something I’d soon figure out.

Those first few days were ones spent getting acclimated to the new environment. The entrance door led into a large open area. In the middle of the room, a large staircase. To the left, the dining room. To the right, the kitchen. Located right next to the staircase leading upstairs to the right was the living room. And directly next to the staircase leading upstairs to the left was the door that led to the basement. I would go out of my way to avoid that door for the first few weeks I lived there.

 Upstairs were several sets of rooms. Bedrooms, bathrooms, empty rooms that hadn’t yet found use. As I crept through the hallways, I began to realize that this house was not one built with just a single person in mind. It felt odd, having such a large place all to myself. But I’d bought it, so that thought was quickly swept to the back of my mind.

I searched around until I found a bedroom that I liked. Counting, there were six bedrooms, three bathrooms and three rooms that weren’t being used for anything in particular on the second floor. Neighboring the bedroom I chose was one of the said empty rooms. I decided then and there that I would make it into my study.

In addition to exploration, the first few days were spent moving all of my stuff in. The entire process ended up taking a little longer than the few days I explored for—about a week and half. It was a Friday night when I finally finished moving everything in. I’d dedicate the following Saturday to my writing.

At least, that’s what I would have done, had I not heard what came from the basement that night.

Without me realizing it, the groceries I’d bought at the beginning of the week ran out and I found myself without ingredients for a meal. I decided I’d order something and chill out in front of the TV for the night.

I finished my order and hung up the phone. I’d been pacing around the counter in the kitchen—it was an island, so I could safely circle around it without much trouble. I left the kitchen and went to the living room where my TV and PlayStation 3 were. I played some game I can’t remember the name of for the next 30 minutes while I waited for my food to arrive.

It came swiftly and quietly, the sound. Something almost imperceptible. A quiet, noticeable, solitary note.

It sounded as though someone had gone up to the piano in the basement and pressed a key.

Instinctually, I paused my game and put the controller down on my coffee table. I got up and slowly crept towards the entryway to the living room. The sound of the note had passed in the few seconds since I heard it, but the implication of it still rang out loudly in my mind.

Could someone have been down there? I would have noticed if someone had broken into my house and gone into the basement. Or maybe I wouldn’t have. Someone could have made their way in while I was playing games in the living room.

As I thought more about the potential of someone who wasn’t me being in the home, more too did my heart rate quicken. It beat rapidly in my chest, like a drum designed to let me know when I was afraid. In that moment, I was afraid.

I did my best to steel my nerves, and I left the living room. I almost wished that whatever made the sound continued to do so. In that case, at the very least, I’d know it was down there and not up here with me.

But no such noise came, and I was left staring at the basement door in terrified, silent anticipation. My hand hovered over the door knob, my mind still debating on just what could be down there. In addition to the deluge of thoughts about what could have pressed that piano key, another began to form.

*What if it wants to hurt me?*

I removed my hand from the door knob, my heart rate decreasing ever so slightly. Why had I even considered going down into that room without means to defend myself? On the one hand, I mentally kicked myself for even thinking of it. On the other hand, what if I was overthinking it? Maybe it was just the piano settling. It could have been rats or some other rodent down there messing around with things. I had to be overthinking things. I had to be.

I was about to turn and go into the kitchen to get a knife when I heard my doorbell ring. Completely forgetting that I’d ordered food a half hour earlier, the sharp, loud sound of the doorbell scared the hell out of me. In the same instant, a wave of relief washed over me like the tides on a beach. There was someone else here now.

At least, now there was someone besides who might have been in the basement.

I swiftly exited the kitchen and opened up the door. I wanted to speak about what happened, but that wasn’t the kind of burden I wanted to put on the shoulders of a delivery boy. I gave him the money for the food, got my meal and we wished each other a good night.

I turned around and looked at the doorway leading into the living room and the door to the dining room. If anything similar to what had just happened to me occurred, I wasn’t so sure how it would go a second time. I didn’t want to eat in silence—if there were other loud noises, I wouldn’t be able to hear the piano.

I sat down and put a movie on. I turned the volume up to a level that probably wasn’t good for my ears, but if it meant I didn’t have to risk hearing the piano again, I’d take it.

 I made the decision to turn the movie off and go to bed right after eating. I’d completely ruled out the fact that I was exhausted and possibly hearing things. Perhaps there was no piano playing entity in the basement. Perhaps I was just tired, and my sleep deprived brain was making things up. That had to be it. I would get a good night of sleep and things would be fine the next day.

I brushed my teeth, put my headphones in and did my best to go to sleep. As it would unexpectedly turn out, I managed to get to sleep. And relatively quickly at that.

The problem was that I didn’t *stay* asleep.

I remember it vividly, even to this day. I awoke with a start. For a second, I wasn’t even aware of the location in which I sat. I looked around and came to familiarity with my surroundings. I was in my bedroom, in my house, and something had just woken me up for some reason. I questioned the cause for my wakefulness.

I didn’t need to go to the bathroom, there wasn’t an unexpected guest in my room, and my music hadn’t gotten so loud as to rouse me. In fact, it became apparent to me that I’d forgotten to plug my phone in, as it was dead. I fumbled around in the darkness and plugged it in.

I tried to speak, but found my mouth too dry to do so. Maybe that was what woke me up, an unyielding thirst. I got up and exited my bedroom. The bathroom I wanted to use was about a 30 second walk from my room. I’d hoped that I would be quick enough, and that nothing would happen in the 30 seconds between my exiting of my room and the entering of the bathroom. I’d hoped in vain.

I made it to the bathroom, but I never made it inside the bathroom. I reached to open the door, my hand hovering over the knob, when an all too familiar noise came from downstairs. From the basement. This time, it was even more difficult to make out, yet somehow, I managed still to hear it.

A single, sharp piano note. Then, following it, a cacophony.

I stopped dead in my tracks and listened closely. I found that my heart had begun to race again, and quickly. Once more did it thump in my chest like a drum. I breathed heavily. I went to grab the knob of the bathroom door, this time not to get in, but out of necessity. My legs felt weak and I wasn’t sure if they alone would keep me standing. My hand shook fiercely as I attempted to grip the knob. 

A cacophony wasn’t the right word to describe what I was hearing. It was a proper piece, I know that much now. Years later, after a painstakingly long process of searching, I did end up finding out just what was being played on that piano.

Whatever—or whoever was down there—was playing *“Suicide in an Airplane”* by Leo Ornstein. I believe now that what caused me to feel such a monumental sense of fear in that moment was the combination of not knowing if I was alone in a big house in the dark and the disconcerting nature of the piece. The irregular beats of the piano coupled with the dissonance the song gave made for a headache of an experience. A fear-stricken, mind-numbingly horrifying experience.

I found rather quickly in the moment that my thirst wasn’t so much of an issue anymore. I’d also found that the strength in my legs had returned, if only long enough to carry me back to my room. I slammed the door behind me and locked it. That was one of the things I was happy about regarding the house; the doors had locks. I got back in bed, put my headphones in and tried to drown out the sounds of the piano from two floors down.

I wasn’t sure exactly what point I managed to fall back asleep at. All I know is that when I woke up, the sun was peeing through my curtains and my headphones were out. I could slightly hear the music that was playing from them. What I couldn’t hear, however, was the sound of the piano. *Thank God,* I thought.

I got up and went out into the hallway. Nothing.

I went downstairs and into the kitchen. My first thought going in was of how thirsty I felt. After fully filling up a cup of water, I drank it quickly and set it in the sink. I was about to open up the refrigerator to get something to eat when I remembered my lack of groceries.

*Shower and then shop it is*, I thought.

I went upstairs, gathered some clothes, and I took a shower. For the rest of the time I was in the house during the morning, I didn’t hear any noises. Not noises that weren’t the house settling, anyways.

I realized as I was going to leave that I didn’t have proper grocery bags. Another item on the list. I cleaned the glass I’d used and made my way back out of the kitchen. For as long as I kept up the routine, I tried to ignore the basement door. It was like the eye of a deity—even if I couldn’t see it, I was well aware of its presence and it couldn’t be avoided forever.

I steeled my nerves once more and looked at it. It was just a simple wooden door with a brass knob and a lock. *Nothing to be afraid of*, I thought, *nothing at all*. I walked up to the door and found my hand hovering over the knob. It was the strangest thing, it almost felt like I was being drawn to it. I moved my hand up quickly and locked the basement door. If whatever was potentially in there wanted out, it would have to exert some effort. But that wouldn’t happen, because there couldn’t have been anything in that basement.

How naïve I was.

I opened up the front door and walked out to my car. It was a beautiful day. The sun was shining and the wind, while present, wasn’t “obnoxious,” as one of my friends would later describe worse weather. Being that it was Autumn too, it wasn’t terribly cold, and it wasn’t terribly warm either. A balance was struck with the temperature and all I found myself needing for outside gear was a light coat, that which I had.

As I left my driveway and began to make my way to the store, I began to think about the events of the previous night again. I told myself that what happened couldn’t have been real—I was dead-tired and I was hearing things. I say all of this because that’s what I thought. I thought that it just had to be me because there was no way it could have been anything else. Not in my mind.

I thought the house couldn’t possibly be haunted. I thought there couldn’t be anyone but me living in there. I thought it was just me. It had to have just been me.

I pushed those thoughts to the back of my mind and continued driving. Before I had time to think about anything else, I’d already pulled into the parking lot of the store. I wanted to make my trip to the grocery store quick, so I didn’t meander. I went only to the aisles and areas where the items I needed were.

20 minutes later, and I was out of the store. I quickly made my way back home and put the groceries away. After I finished putting the groceries away, I went to check the basement door.

*Still locked*.

I breathed a sigh of relief. That surprised me, considering I’d come to the conclusion that there shouldn’t have been anything to worry about regarding that downstairs room. As I stood in front of the basement door, I checked my phone.

It was still mid-morning, so I decided I’d do something for myself. I knew I wasn’t going to get any writing done, so I opted to go to the library instead. If I couldn’t write to entertain myself, then I’d just consume what someone else took the time to make.

I left the house once more and, within a few minutes, found myself on the road going into town again. I hadn’t yet decided what I would read when I arrived, but as I pulled into the parking lot of the library, it came to me.

*Read a history book*.

Learning about the history of the town I lived in was something I’d been planning on doing for a while, but I could never find the time. That Saturday, I had the time. And I was going to use it.

I found that I was running into some problems rather quickly. What I was hoping to find was a catch-all history book. Something that included events of all kinds from the beginning of the town until the moment the book was published and I read it. Once more, my problem was that there was no such book. I was busy scanning and flipping through the books in the history section when one of the library workers came up to me.

“Are you having trouble finding a certain book?” she asked.

I turned to her. “I am, actually. General history?”

“Sorry, no,” she said. “But we’re getting those types of books in pretty soon. Within the month, actually.”

I was stuck for something to say. If I couldn’t acquire knowledge about the town as a whole, then maybe I could find some info on a smaller scale. Almost as if my previous thoughts had opened the door and invited it, the next thought barged into my head.

*The house. The basement. Ask about the houses*.

“What do you have on the houses in this town?” I asked, looking at her.

Her face shifted to one of worry, to one of curiosity, to one of realization.

“We have one book, actually,” she said, getting up. “It isn’t here on the floor, though. Want me to get it for you?”

“I’d appreciate it, thank you,” I replied.

She left and I went to stand by the table at which I planned to sit and read. As I stood, several thoughts flooded through my head. I wondered if I would find out anything regarding the sounds I heard. I began to wonder if it really was my imagination. I didn’t know what results reading the book would yield, but as the librarian brought and handed it over to me with a simple “enjoy!”, I knew I’d get some form of answers.

I sat down at the table and began to flip through the book. I first checked the date on the book. To my surprise, it had been published only a year prior to when I read it.

I skimmed the pages that had writings of when the first houses were built in the town, writings of the materials and types of houses built, and examples of notable events that occurred within some of the houses.

An ache struck my chest as I flipped to a page about two-thirds of the way through the book. I flipped to the next page and found a picture of the current house I was living in, albeit a lot older—technically younger—looking. I looked near the bottom of the page and found that the house had been built years before I moved into it—about six to be exact. Another thing I noted was the fates of the occupants in the house.

According to witness testimonies and police reports as well as information disclosed by the constantly changing realtors, every single time the house was occupied, it was by a single person. The first owner of the house was not mentally stable, as I came to find out. The first owner of the house was reported to have hanged themselves in an upstairs bedroom. The house no longer had an owner, and was therefore put up for sale. This happened in late 2004.

The next owner of the house took their own life as well. But they didn’t do it because of mental instability. Not mental instability that wasn’t already pre-established, anyways. They didn’t do it because they were depressed. They did it because, according to neighbors and close friends, in the final few days before they ended their life, they reported seeing scattered visions of a hanging man in one of the upstairs bedrooms.

I wasn’t sure why they chose the method they chose, of all the ways. This individual chose to drown themselves in one of the upstairs bathrooms. The house once again went on sale, no one the wiser to what was happening within the walls. This occurred in mid 2005.

The next owner of the house reportedly displayed similar behaviors to the previous one. Madness, paranoia, anxiety and a never ending stream of fear. They shot themselves in the kitchen. According to one of their friends, the only thing they were saying leading up to their death was something about someone drowning in the bathroom. But, when they attempted to show it to someone else, it was like the drowned individual had never been there in the first place. This particular owner passed in early 2006.

The next owner, as I suspected, complained about seeing visions in their kitchen of a woman shooting herself. The sight itself wasn’t what drove the next owner to poison their own food and eat it. No, what drove them to end their own life in such a gruesome manner was the constant ear-ringing gunshots they heard. Just hours before they took their own life, they’d had a friend over. The friend left because the owner was frantically asking “you can’t hear that?”

The friend only wanted to get help for the owner, but it was too late. By the time the friend returned with others and some help, the owner had taken their own life via poison. This happened in 2007.

The last and most recent owner came up next. I was technically the most recent owner of the house, but this listed all owners who’d taken their own life. The previous owner before me, who bought the house in 2008, and was a master piano player, complained about hearing and seeing things in the dining room.

What surprised me the most about this particular owner was the amount of time they stayed in the house for. Every other owner stayed in the house for, at most, a year. This owner only lived in the house for three months.

As was customary with every other owner, she, around two months into living in the house, began to complain about the sounds and sights in the dining room. According to friends and family, this woman would play the piano in an attempt to cope with her problems.

Reading the next passage, I was saddened to find that the problems were too much for her. Too much, as were the problems for everyone else.

She was found by her mother in the early hours of the morning, hunched over the piano, two deep gashes in her wrists. Next to her, streaked with blood, was a note. The full contents weren’t laid out on the page, but the last part was. It scared me.

*I can’t handle it anymore. The man in the dining room, he’s poisoning himself. He’s killing himself and I can’t handle it. I can’t handle the sounds. I can’t handle the visions. Therapy won’t help. Nothing helps. I think I’m going to do it today. I think I’m going to get myself some proper help. I just wish I could come to terms with what’s happening to me.*

I set the book down and closed it. I felt hot. I’d began to sweat a little, but I knew that was due to my increasing heart rate as well as the increasing pressure of the stress on my mind. Everyone who had owned that house before me ended their lives. Ended their lives after seeing and hearing visions of those who came before them.

I felt dizzy and I got up from the table. I began to walk slowly towards the exit of the library. I needed some air. It looked to be getting dark outside.

*What the hell?*

The thought quickly vanished from my mind. I needed to see what time it was. I went to get my phone out of my pocket and I mentally kicked myself.

My phone wasn’t in my pocket.

I started moving faster. I had to check and see if it was in my car. As I unlocked the vehicle and slid into the driver’s seat, I looked around.

I mentally kicked myself again and slammed the door before punching the steering wheel multiple times. I’d left my cellphone at home. I was going to have to go back and get it.

I didn’t want to go anywhere near that house at this point. If the pattern were to continue repeating itself, I’d end up going mad and I would take my own life. I didn’t want that.

I didn’t want to die.

I drove a little faster than I should have, but through some force of sheer luck, I didn’t get pulled over once. Though, maybe I should have. I pulled into my driveway and found the house to be dark. This didn’t scare me too badly, as I hadn’t turned any of them on before I left. What did scare me was when I walked in and found the basement door to be unlocked and opened.

What the hell had happened in here for it to be open? Was it a ghost? Could a ghost physically interact with something? At that point, I had many questions, but all I wanted to do was get my phone and get out of there.

I sprinted upstairs to my room and found my phone. I grabbed it, but had to question the manner in which I’d found it. My phone was set right in the middle of my bed, screen down, my headphones wrapped up nicely right next to them. Paying it just enough mind to think about it later, I grabbed both and turned around to leave my room when I heard it. This time, the sound rang out uninhibited and unabated.

Once more, the haunting, dissonant sound of Leo Ornstein’s *Suicide in an Airplane* rang out from the basement. I froze in place and remained that way for a few seconds. The disjointed, arrhythmic melody was beautifully terrifying. It took me a good few seconds to realize the effect it was having on me. I broke out of my trance and bounded for the stairs. Reaching the base of the steps, I turned to face the basement door.

Still, to this day, I regret doing what I did next. I had not a single reason to go investigate the door. I didn’t have a reason to be any more curious than I’d been hours, days before. I had no reason to do what I did next, yet, in those following seconds, I found myself making quick strides toward the basement door. I found myself on the third step of the staircase when I stopped.

I stared down the mouth of darkness, Leo Ornstein’s haunting piano piece ringing out from the unknown piano player. Except, I knew who it was. I knew that, down in the basement, the previous owner of the house awaited me with open, bloody arms. In the short time I was living in that house, I hadn’t even thought of going into the basement. Just never occurred to me.

I’d never considered going in prior to that night, but just then, something, some strange thing was drawing me to it. Still, I fought the urge. I hadn’t gone down before, and I wouldn’t be going down now.

Steeling myself, I turned around and began to make my way back up the stairs. Just before my foot left the first step, the door slammed. It could have been the wind, it could have been any force of nature. It could have just been the way the door worked. But I knew what really happened.

It wasn’t the wind that closed the door.

The door itself slammed with so much ferocity and force that it blindsided me. I expected to take it and be fine. I’d just have to open the door and then I’d be free. But that’s not what happened. No, the door hit me in the face with such a level of force that I couldn’t do anything but stand there, take it, and fall.

And fall I did. All the way down the stairs. I hadn’t received any life threatening injuries on my fall, but I knew that, should I make it out of the basement, I’d have some bruises on my body the next day. Bruises, however, were near the bottom of the list of things I needed to worry about in that moment.

Clearly now, I could hear the haunting melody being played from the piano. This time, it almost ached. It felt as though excruciating levels of pressure were being applied to the insides of my ears. My eardrums felt like they were going to *burst*.

I groaned, searching for ground to prop myself up on. The cold, concrete floor of the basement did nothing to soothe my pain inflicted from the fall. I’d landed back-up with my stomach pressing against the floor.

Gathering all the strength I could manage, I reached into my pocket and pulled out my phone. The kind of phone I had at the time didn’t have a flashlight, so I had to use the actual screen as a light source. I was mostly using it to look for something, anything I could use to get out of there. However, out of curiosity, and the need to know what was making the noise, I raised the phone up and in the direction of where I imagined the piano noises to be coming from. It was a shot in the dark, as I felt like the sounds were coming from every direction. A maelstrom of discordant, sharp piano notes.

I tried to mentally brace myself for what I would see when the light landed on the piano, but no amount of nerve-steeling or mental shielding could have prepared me for what I saw.

There, sitting on the piano bench, gaping wrist wounds weeping blood onto the floor, was the pianist that’d haunted me for the last couple of days. She whipped blood over the pristine white keys of the piano and the surrounding area as she played with a fervor unbecoming of a suffered spirit forever destined to remain in this accursed house.

I tried to stifle the scream I knew was coming, but it was no use. This wasn’t something I could just look at and then not care about for the rest of my day. Until that point in my life, I had not experienced one thing that equaled a fraction of the unbridled, primal fear I was feeling in my gut. It felt as though someone had dropped an ice cold rock in the pit of my stomach.

She must have noticed the light on her, because a short time after I had bathed her in it, she stopped playing the piano. Without warning, without anything that could have indicated that she was to stop. She halted, completely and quietly. Her face was the first thing I saw, as she turned to look me dead in the eyes.

The pit in my stomach grew larger and I felt something catch in my throat. Whether it was my fight-or-flight kicking in, I didn’t know. What I was aware of, however, was the increasingly quick rate at which my heart began to beat. I felt waves of fear wash over me again and again.

Then, she got up from the bench. The sounds of bare feet slapping against wet, bloody concrete terrified me, but as she approached closer and closer, something else came to me. The fear remained in my body as strong as it had ever been, and hopefully as strong as it would ever be. But there was something else. A sudden surge of energy, a burst. Something I could use. Something that would help me get out of that basement and out of that damned house.

I used that burst of energy to get up and turn around. Just before I made it to the stairs, I felt her grab my arm. I was about to whirl around and try to get her off of me when the physical properties of blood did all the work for me. Just as fast as she’d managed to grip onto my forearm, the slippery blood caused her to lose her grip and I escaped from her bloody, one handed grasp.

As I bounded up the basement stairs, I didn’t think of whether she’d be able to get out or not, but that was far from the most important thing on my mind. I reached the top of the stairs and opened the door. To my surprise, it wasn’t locked, but I wasn’t going to complain. I slammed it behind me with enough force to send small cracks through the door and cause it to splinter slightly.

I wasn’t taking any time to rest. I sprinted to the kitchen, grabbed a dish towel, turned the stove on, and lit the dish towel ablaze. I made my way back out to the main area and threw the flaming rag. Just then, I heard the basement door crash open, but I was already running through the open front doorway.

Now, the sounds of the piano weren’t anywhere to be found. As I got in and started my card I found the reason for that.

Looking through the open front door, I could just barely make it out. But I knew what I was looking at. Dripping blood onto the floor, smile on her face, was the woman playing the piano. As the spreading flames licked at the stairs and the doorframe of the basement, she turned around and began to walk back down the stairs. Behind her, the door slammed and the flames began lapping at it more fiercely.

I didn’t care about that, though. I cared about getting away from that house as quickly as possible. And as far away as possible. I didn’t want a thing to do with that place anymore. As a matter of fact, I decided that night that I didn’t want anything to do with that town in general. As I drove, I remembered the blood she’d gotten on me. I went to find something to wipe it off on when I actually got a good look at my arm.

There was nothing on it but a slowly forming bruise from my fall. I accepted it and kept my eyes on the road.

I’m not sure how long I drove for, only that I ended up in Davenport, Iowa, nearly 24 hours later. I checked into a shitty motel and watched the news in Vermont for a few minutes. They’d covered the burning down of that house from late in the night until right then when I watched it. Strangely enough, they treated it as though it was an accident. It wasn’t, but I suppose there wasn’t any evidence left to say otherwise.

After a good night’s sleep, I decided to actually look around town for a bit.

I eventually got acclimated to the town of Davenport, Iowa. I got a decent job, coincidentally, at another bank. I managed to save up enough and buy another house, albeit years after the event. The new house was a lot smaller than the previous one. Or is, I suppose, since I still live there. When I bought said house, it was under the specific condition that it did *not* have a basement.

Another thing I was worried about was living alone, but as of eight and three years ago, 2018 and 2023, I don’t have to worry about that anymore.

It’s just me, my wife, and our daughter in this house now. I work, spend time with my family, and I write when I can. It’s a good life, one I never thought I’d have. It certainly wasn’t what I was thinking about in that basement. But I don’t willingly think about the basement or that house anymore. Not willingly.

I’ve never told my wife about the Suicide House or the phantom piano player, and I don’t think I plan on doing so. Not for a while, at least. Maybe I’ll tell her and my daughter when she’s older. We’re living a good life, and I don’t want to tarnish that.

It’s not all perfect, though.

You see, I may have physically escaped the house, but even 16 years later, the memories of what happened in that place still plague me. I still dream about my parents and the car crash they got in, but they aren’t the only ones.

I dream about the man that hanged himself in one of the upstairs bedrooms. I dream about the woman who drowned herself in an upstairs bathroom. I dream of the woman who shot herself in the kitchen. I dream of the man who poisoned himself in the dining room. And I always dream about the woman in the basement who carved into her wrists the wounds of death. I dream of every single one.

They don’t scare me, not as much as they did anymore. They may not have come to terms with their lives and the subsequent ending of those lives, but I have.

Call me selfish, call me whatever you want, but that’s the truth. Still do I dream about the occupants of that house, but I don’t run in fear. I comfort them, tell them that it wasn’t their fault, that I care.

The house is gone, but the memories remain. The dreams, I can deal with those. But, there’s something else that happens to me. It isn’t nightly, but it happens just frequently enough that there’s consistency in its occurrence.

Sometimes, I’ll wake up real early in the morning. I don’t know what causes me to awaken, but every time, without fail, I go downstairs.

If the house is quiet, and I concentrate hard enough, I can just barely hear it.

Somewhere below me, I can faintly hear the haunting, dissonant chords of Leo Ornstein’s *Suicide in an Airplane*.",4,1770499247.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

I live in the countryside so ofcourse the opportunities are limited..be it transport, stores,, groceries..(there is only one grocery store here thats all.)

I moved here to get married to my Norwegian husband. I have 2 bachelors (økonomi og administrasjon) but one of them is approved as a Høgskolekandidat grad because of the difference in years of Education in my country. I have applied to multiple jobs..easily over 200 and have faced rejections..most of the times I didn't receive any reply. Right now, I'm doing a part time job in a canteen where I have to travel 3.5 hours in total back and forth to work for just 3 hours in the city. On top of that, I have to wait for my husband to pick me up because the buses don't go to my place and if they do, I have to easily wait a couple of hours, and then I'd reach later than my husband so that makes no sense.

I have B2 in Norwegian, and have sent mails to recruiting agencies..visited them, talked to them. Called a couple of people, asked for an opportunity..even for unpaid internships, engagement, lærling, literally anything. My husband has used his contacts and network and they have also sent my CV and recommended me to companies but haven't had any luck. We have asked my in-laws to ask around, they just said they have no idea and it doesn't work like that i can get anything through them and I have to do things on my own. NAV gave me jobbsøkerkurs but that didnt help either. I used all their tips and suggestions. I even went again to get help, I was simply told that since I have a bachelor degree and working part time in a canteen, I am capable enough to find a job on my own. I used to have a nice job (in marketing) before which I left in order to get married. My professional life is at a pause and I'm seriously affected by how the weather is here and the lack of opportunities and things to do. I come from a big city that has over 20 million people to a little place with barely 200 people.

I dont have any kind of support, no friends or family. My in laws are of no help either, they don't understand the struggles I'm going through.  I was a free and independent bird before,  now I feel trapped. I have to depend on others to drive me around. I can't just go and enjoy a cup of coffee because for that i need to travel 2 hours by bus to do that. I barely earn anything because we drive by car and have to pay diesel and taxes so the money goes there. My husband is already paying loans for the house, groceries, electricity and other expenses that come. 

I feel lost and I don't know what to do. Yes, going to the university is an option for bachelors but I see so many people struggling to find a job even after their Masters. I have wasted soon 4 years over this..there is also not a certainty that i'll get into the University because I am only limited to take one course according to my education and there are over 600+ people competing for only 180 seats.

I'm seriously affected by the weather. Im depressed, anxious and affected by the darkness. The summers dont help either because it is too cold for me. I feel trapped and I don't know what to do. I'm suicidal but I also don't want to give up. But the future doesn't look bright. We have been waiting to start a family because I wanted to settle professionally, but it doesn't look bright either. I won't be able to find a job other places too because of the huge gap now.

1qypqis,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1qypqis/the_piano_in_the_basement/,The Piano in The Basement,"The house was large and cheap. That’s why I bought it. I wasn’t thinking.

Even all these years later, I still kick myself over my impatience—over my unwillingness to just wait and buy a house of higher quality.

Ultimately, I still blame myself for what happened in that home. I could have chosen to leave. I could have done a lot of things differently, but I didn’t.

What I experienced in that house will likely stay with me until the day I die.

I graduated from high school in June of 2006. Like many kids in my grade, I hadn’t yet put together a concrete plan for my future. Unlike a fair few of the other kids in my grade, I hadn’t yet needed to worry about my future.

You see, just a few months before I graduated, my parents died. In the months the leading up to my graduation, I came to terms with it—accepted they were gone.

While I, in my teenage years, might not have had much to show in the way of financial success, they’d flourished. My mother was our town’s dentist and my father was a therapist with a PhD in Psychology. To say the least, they were good at what they did.

Now, that isn’t to say that I didn’t make money. I had a few odd jobs here and there, but nothing stuck. I wasn’t a bad kid. In fact, I’d say that, of all my friends, I was the best behaved. Maybe that’s why they did it.

When I told them that I wanted to major in English studies, they couldn’t have been prouder. My grandfather was writer, and a pretty good one at that. He was a good man, too. I respected him a great deal and looked up to him. Even these days when people ask, I always say that he was my inspiration for going into the English field.

Perhaps my parents knew that the field I wanted to major in wouldn’t yield significant financial success. Maybe that’s why they did it. Perhaps it was simply because they loved me and I was an only child. Perhaps it was because I was—and still am their son.

Maybe that’s why I was the sole heir to everything. Their house, their belongings, their savings. All of it, to me. I was over 18 when they passed, so there wasn’t a need to wait for a certain age threshold to be passed. I’d crossed over any potential line.

The inheritance was mine. I can’t remember exactly how much money I got from them, but it was a sizable chunk for a recent high school graduate. It was enough to keep me living comfortably for a few years.

It wasn’t until four years after I graduated that I decided to sell their house. Between payments for it and payments for room and board at the university I attended, it was beginning to put a strain on my mental health. Financially, however, I remained stable.

The constant payments weren't the only reason I found myself wanting out of the house, though. The longer I stayed in that home, the more and more I began to sense an endless air of hopelessness within its walls. My parents had passed away in a car accident. They were on the way home from meeting up with a family friend when a drunk driver blindsided and T-boned my father’s car.

I never did see the bodies, but that wasn’t because I chose not to. The authorities and coroners were only able to identify my parents by the I.D. cards in their wallets. The funeral was closed casket.

The nightmares were another cause for my wanting to sell the house. Every night leading up to my graduation, I’d have vivid nightmares. Scenarios of what my brain thought my parents had gone through in their final moments. I never did see when the crash would occur, though. Every time that car made contact with them, I’d jolt awake in a cold sweat. I didn’t know if my parents ever found closure, wherever they’d gone after the accident, but I did know one thing.

In the time between their deaths and my living in that new house, I never did find closure. The spirit that was the death of my parents haunted me greatly.

But it wasn’t the only thing to do that.

In September of 2010, I made the decision to finally start truly living on my own. I’d graduated from my University with a bachelor’s degree in English. I’d decided to finally become a writer like my grandfather before me.

The only problem was that writing didn’t exactly make for a great career if it didn’t immediately take off. I did not immediately take off. I’d uploaded some of my writings, mostly horror, to several sites and writing blogs. WordPress was my best friend during that time, allowing me to post many different writings all under the same blog.

Of course, none of them took off in the ways I’d hoped they would, but I was prepared for that.

I’d managed to get a job at a bank near my university. Luckily for me, they allowed me to come in part time as I was a student. During breaks and other periods of free time, I worked full-time. When I graduated and got my degree, I’d managed to keep the job at the bank and kept working and saving for the next two months.

The money I’d made working, plus the remaining funds from my inheritance gave me a—once again—sizable chunk to spend. With my parents house sold and my room and board no longer being *my* room and board, I figured it was finally time to look for a place to settle down.

To my complete surprise, I found a large home in the same town where I’d been working. It was no colonial, I’ll say that much. But for a single person, it  was larger than anything I could have imagined. And it was cheap, too.

As for why I never asked about the price, I’ll tell you. I was a recently graduated, depressed orphan who couldn’t get his writing to take off for anything worth a damn. I wasn’t thinking clearly, so to speak. The house was cheap, it was big, and I hadn’t a thought in my head besides the two of those things when I bought it in October of 2010.

I never got to receive an official tour of the house, but that was one of the thoughts closer to the back of my mind as I explored my new home. One thing the realtor did tell me about was the basement.

“There’s a piano down there,” she said.

When I pried for more information, she actually told me more instead of being reserved like I thought she’d be.

“That’s where the previous owner died,” she told me. “That’s why the house is so cheap. Because the previous owner never got to sell it. But, you know, someone dying in there doesn’t exactly help with jacking up the price.”

“Damaged goods,” I remember telling her.

“That’s a good way to put it,” she replied.

She never told me how the previous owner passed, or the circumstances surrounding it. Luckily, or unluckily for me, I’d find that out anyways. But not from the realtor. Just a few days after I bought the house, she disappeared completely. Didn’t go missing, I just never saw her again after that. Could never contact her.

I suppose I could have expended some more time and effort in finding her, but looking back, it didn’t matter then, and it doesn’t matter now.

Just before she vanished, the realtor also told me about how spacious the basement was. She described making it into a study where I could write. Made sense, considering I’d told her I was an up and coming writer and all. I told her I would just turn one of the upstairs rooms into a study. I never was the biggest fan of basements, and the fact that someone had died in this one didn’t quite sit right with me. I wouldn’t be able to focus, I knew that much.

I didn’t know just yet what I’d do to implement a room such as a study in the house, but that was something I’d soon figure out.

Those first few days were ones spent getting acclimated to the new environment. The entrance door led into a large open area. In the middle of the room, a large staircase. To the left, the dining room. To the right, the kitchen. Located right next to the staircase leading upstairs to the right was the living room. And directly next to the staircase leading upstairs to the left was the door that led to the basement. I would go out of my way to avoid that door for the first few weeks I lived there.

 Upstairs were several sets of rooms. Bedrooms, bathrooms, empty rooms that hadn’t yet found use. As I crept through the hallways, I began to realize that this house was not one built with just a single person in mind. It felt odd, having such a large place all to myself. But I’d bought it, so that thought was quickly swept to the back of my mind.

I searched around until I found a bedroom that I liked. Counting, there were six bedrooms, three bathrooms and three rooms that weren’t being used for anything in particular on the second floor. Neighboring the bedroom I chose was one of the said empty rooms. I decided then and there that I would make it into my study.

In addition to exploration, the first few days were spent moving all of my stuff in. The entire process ended up taking a little longer than the few days I explored for—about a week and half. It was a Friday night when I finally finished moving everything in. I’d dedicate the following Saturday to my writing.

At least, that’s what I would have done, had I not heard what came from the basement that night.

Without me realizing it, the groceries I’d bought at the beginning of the week ran out and I found myself without ingredients for a meal. I decided I’d order something and chill out in front of the TV for the night.

I finished my order and hung up the phone. I’d been pacing around the counter in the kitchen—it was an island, so I could safely circle around it without much trouble. I left the kitchen and went to the living room where my TV and PlayStation 3 were. I played some game I can’t remember the name of for the next 30 minutes while I waited for my food to arrive.

It came swiftly and quietly, the sound. Something almost imperceptible. A quiet, noticeable, solitary note.

It sounded as though someone had gone up to the piano in the basement and pressed a key.

Instinctually, I paused my game and put the controller down on my coffee table. I got up and slowly crept towards the entryway to the living room. The sound of the note had passed in the few seconds since I heard it, but the implication of it still rang out loudly in my mind.

Could someone have been down there? I would have noticed if someone had broken into my house and gone into the basement. Or maybe I wouldn’t have. Someone could have made their way in while I was playing games in the living room.

As I thought more about the potential of someone who wasn’t me being in the home, more too did my heart rate quicken. It beat rapidly in my chest, like a drum designed to let me know when I was afraid. In that moment, I was afraid.

I did my best to steel my nerves, and I left the living room. I almost wished that whatever made the sound continued to do so. In that case, at the very least, I’d know it was down there and not up here with me.

But no such noise came, and I was left staring at the basement door in terrified, silent anticipation. My hand hovered over the door knob, my mind still debating on just what could be down there. In addition to the deluge of thoughts about what could have pressed that piano key, another began to form.

*What if it wants to hurt me?*

I removed my hand from the door knob, my heart rate decreasing ever so slightly. Why had I even considered going down into that room without means to defend myself? On the one hand, I mentally kicked myself for even thinking of it. On the other hand, what if I was overthinking it? Maybe it was just the piano settling. It could have been rats or some other rodent down there messing around with things. I had to be overthinking things. I had to be.

I was about to turn and go into the kitchen to get a knife when I heard my doorbell ring. Completely forgetting that I’d ordered food a half hour earlier, the sharp, loud sound of the doorbell scared the hell out of me. In the same instant, a wave of relief washed over me like the tides on a beach. There was someone else here now.

At least, now there was someone besides who might have been in the basement.

I swiftly exited the kitchen and opened up the door. I wanted to speak about what happened, but that wasn’t the kind of burden I wanted to put on the shoulders of a delivery boy. I gave him the money for the food, got my meal and we wished each other a good night.

I turned around and looked at the doorway leading into the living room and the door to the dining room. If anything similar to what had just happened to me occurred, I wasn’t so sure how it would go a second time. I didn’t want to eat in silence—if there were other loud noises, I wouldn’t be able to hear the piano.

I sat down and put a movie on. I turned the volume up to a level that probably wasn’t good for my ears, but if it meant I didn’t have to risk hearing the piano again, I’d take it.

 I made the decision to turn the movie off and go to bed right after eating. I’d completely ruled out the fact that I was exhausted and possibly hearing things. Perhaps there was no piano playing entity in the basement. Perhaps I was just tired, and my sleep deprived brain was making things up. That had to be it. I would get a good night of sleep and things would be fine the next day.

I brushed my teeth, put my headphones in and did my best to go to sleep. As it would unexpectedly turn out, I managed to get to sleep. And relatively quickly at that.

The problem was that I didn’t *stay* asleep.

I remember it vividly, even to this day. I awoke with a start. For a second, I wasn’t even aware of the location in which I sat. I looked around and came to familiarity with my surroundings. I was in my bedroom, in my house, and something had just woken me up for some reason. I questioned the cause for my wakefulness.

I didn’t need to go to the bathroom, there wasn’t an unexpected guest in my room, and my music hadn’t gotten so loud as to rouse me. In fact, it became apparent to me that I’d forgotten to plug my phone in, as it was dead. I fumbled around in the darkness and plugged it in.

I tried to speak, but found my mouth too dry to do so. Maybe that was what woke me up, an unyielding thirst. I got up and exited my bedroom. The bathroom I wanted to use was about a 30 second walk from my room. I’d hoped that I would be quick enough, and that nothing would happen in the 30 seconds between my exiting of my room and the entering of the bathroom. I’d hoped in vain.

I made it to the bathroom, but I never made it inside the bathroom. I reached to open the door, my hand hovering over the knob, when an all too familiar noise came from downstairs. From the basement. This time, it was even more difficult to make out, yet somehow, I managed still to hear it.

A single, sharp piano note. Then, following it, a cacophony.

I stopped dead in my tracks and listened closely. I found that my heart had begun to race again, and quickly. Once more did it thump in my chest like a drum. I breathed heavily. I went to grab the knob of the bathroom door, this time not to get in, but out of necessity. My legs felt weak and I wasn’t sure if they alone would keep me standing. My hand shook fiercely as I attempted to grip the knob. 

A cacophony wasn’t the right word to describe what I was hearing. It was a proper piece, I know that much now. Years later, after a painstakingly long process of searching, I did end up finding out just what was being played on that piano.

Whatever—or whoever was down there—was playing *“Suicide in an Airplane”* by Leo Ornstein. I believe now that what caused me to feel such a monumental sense of fear in that moment was the combination of not knowing if I was alone in a big house in the dark and the disconcerting nature of the piece. The irregular beats of the piano coupled with the dissonance the song gave made for a headache of an experience. A fear-stricken, mind-numbingly horrifying experience.

I found rather quickly in the moment that my thirst wasn’t so much of an issue anymore. I’d also found that the strength in my legs had returned, if only long enough to carry me back to my room. I slammed the door behind me and locked it. That was one of the things I was happy about regarding the house; the doors had locks. I got back in bed, put my headphones in and tried to drown out the sounds of the piano from two floors down.

I wasn’t sure exactly what point I managed to fall back asleep at. All I know is that when I woke up, the sun was peeing through my curtains and my headphones were out. I could slightly hear the music that was playing from them. What I couldn’t hear, however, was the sound of the piano. *Thank God,* I thought.

I got up and went out into the hallway. Nothing.

I went downstairs and into the kitchen. My first thought going in was of how thirsty I felt. After fully filling up a cup of water, I drank it quickly and set it in the sink. I was about to open up the refrigerator to get something to eat when I remembered my lack of groceries.

*Shower and then shop it is*, I thought.

I went upstairs, gathered some clothes, and I took a shower. For the rest of the time I was in the house during the morning, I didn’t hear any noises. Not noises that weren’t the house settling, anyways.

I realized as I was going to leave that I didn’t have proper grocery bags. Another item on the list. I cleaned the glass I’d used and made my way back out of the kitchen. For as long as I kept up the routine, I tried to ignore the basement door. It was like the eye of a deity—even if I couldn’t see it, I was well aware of its presence and it couldn’t be avoided forever.

I steeled my nerves once more and looked at it. It was just a simple wooden door with a brass knob and a lock. *Nothing to be afraid of*, I thought, *nothing at all*. I walked up to the door and found my hand hovering over the knob. It was the strangest thing, it almost felt like I was being drawn to it. I moved my hand up quickly and locked the basement door. If whatever was potentially in there wanted out, it would have to exert some effort. But that wouldn’t happen, because there couldn’t have been anything in that basement.

How naïve I was.

I opened up the front door and walked out to my car. It was a beautiful day. The sun was shining and the wind, while present, wasn’t “obnoxious,” as one of my friends would later describe worse weather. Being that it was Autumn too, it wasn’t terribly cold, and it wasn’t terribly warm either. A balance was struck with the temperature and all I found myself needing for outside gear was a light coat, that which I had.

As I left my driveway and began to make my way to the store, I began to think about the events of the previous night again. I told myself that what happened couldn’t have been real—I was dead-tired and I was hearing things. I say all of this because that’s what I thought. I thought that it just had to be me because there was no way it could have been anything else. Not in my mind.

I thought the house couldn’t possibly be haunted. I thought there couldn’t be anyone but me living in there. I thought it was just me. It had to have just been me.

I pushed those thoughts to the back of my mind and continued driving. Before I had time to think about anything else, I’d already pulled into the parking lot of the store. I wanted to make my trip to the grocery store quick, so I didn’t meander. I went only to the aisles and areas where the items I needed were.

20 minutes later, and I was out of the store. I quickly made my way back home and put the groceries away. After I finished putting the groceries away, I went to check the basement door.

*Still locked*.

I breathed a sigh of relief. That surprised me, considering I’d come to the conclusion that there shouldn’t have been anything to worry about regarding that downstairs room. As I stood in front of the basement door, I checked my phone.

It was still mid-morning, so I decided I’d do something for myself. I knew I wasn’t going to get any writing done, so I opted to go to the library instead. If I couldn’t write to entertain myself, then I’d just consume what someone else took the time to make.

I left the house once more and, within a few minutes, found myself on the road going into town again. I hadn’t yet decided what I would read when I arrived, but as I pulled into the parking lot of the library, it came to me.

*Read a history book*.

Learning about the history of the town I lived in was something I’d been planning on doing for a while, but I could never find the time. That Saturday, I had the time. And I was going to use it.

I found that I was running into some problems rather quickly. What I was hoping to find was a catch-all history book. Something that included events of all kinds from the beginning of the town until the moment the book was published and I read it. Once more, my problem was that there was no such book. I was busy scanning and flipping through the books in the history section when one of the library workers came up to me.

“Are you having trouble finding a certain book?” she asked.

I turned to her. “I am, actually. General history?”

“Sorry, no,” she said. “But we’re getting those types of books in pretty soon. Within the month, actually.”

I was stuck for something to say. If I couldn’t acquire knowledge about the town as a whole, then maybe I could find some info on a smaller scale. Almost as if my previous thoughts had opened the door and invited it, the next thought barged into my head.

*The house. The basement. Ask about the houses*.

“What do you have on the houses in this town?” I asked, looking at her.

Her face shifted to one of worry, to one of curiosity, to one of realization.

“We have one book, actually,” she said, getting up. “It isn’t here on the floor, though. Want me to get it for you?”

“I’d appreciate it, thank you,” I replied.

She left and I went to stand by the table at which I planned to sit and read. As I stood, several thoughts flooded through my head. I wondered if I would find out anything regarding the sounds I heard. I began to wonder if it really was my imagination. I didn’t know what results reading the book would yield, but as the librarian brought and handed it over to me with a simple “enjoy!”, I knew I’d get some form of answers.

I sat down at the table and began to flip through the book. I first checked the date on the book. To my surprise, it had been published only a year prior to when I read it.

I skimmed the pages that had writings of when the first houses were built in the town, writings of the materials and types of houses built, and examples of notable events that occurred within some of the houses.

An ache struck my chest as I flipped to a page about two-thirds of the way through the book. I flipped to the next page and found a picture of the current house I was living in, albeit a lot older—technically younger—looking. I looked near the bottom of the page and found that the house had been built years before I moved into it—about six to be exact. Another thing I noted was the fates of the occupants in the house.

According to witness testimonies and police reports as well as information disclosed by the constantly changing realtors, every single time the house was occupied, it was by a single person. The first owner of the house was not mentally stable, as I came to find out. The first owner of the house was reported to have hanged themselves in an upstairs bedroom. The house no longer had an owner, and was therefore put up for sale. This happened in late 2004.

The next owner of the house took their own life as well. But they didn’t do it because of mental instability. Not mental instability that wasn’t already pre-established, anyways. They didn’t do it because they were depressed. They did it because, according to neighbors and close friends, in the final few days before they ended their life, they reported seeing scattered visions of a hanging man in one of the upstairs bedrooms.

I wasn’t sure why they chose the method they chose, of all the ways. This individual chose to drown themselves in one of the upstairs bathrooms. The house once again went on sale, no one the wiser to what was happening within the walls. This occurred in mid 2005.

The next owner of the house reportedly displayed similar behaviors to the previous one. Madness, paranoia, anxiety and a never ending stream of fear. They shot themselves in the kitchen. According to one of their friends, the only thing they were saying leading up to their death was something about someone drowning in the bathroom. But, when they attempted to show it to someone else, it was like the drowned individual had never been there in the first place. This particular owner passed in early 2006.

The next owner, as I suspected, complained about seeing visions in their kitchen of a woman shooting herself. The sight itself wasn’t what drove the next owner to poison their own food and eat it. No, what drove them to end their own life in such a gruesome manner was the constant ear-ringing gunshots they heard. Just hours before they took their own life, they’d had a friend over. The friend left because the owner was frantically asking “you can’t hear that?”

The friend only wanted to get help for the owner, but it was too late. By the time the friend returned with others and some help, the owner had taken their own life via poison. This happened in 2007.

The last and most recent owner came up next. I was technically the most recent owner of the house, but this listed all owners who’d taken their own life. The previous owner before me, who bought the house in 2008, and was a master piano player, complained about hearing and seeing things in the dining room.

What surprised me the most about this particular owner was the amount of time they stayed in the house for. Every other owner stayed in the house for, at most, a year. This owner only lived in the house for three months.

As was customary with every other owner, she, around two months into living in the house, began to complain about the sounds and sights in the dining room. According to friends and family, this woman would play the piano in an attempt to cope with her problems.

Reading the next passage, I was saddened to find that the problems were too much for her. Too much, as were the problems for everyone else.

She was found by her mother in the early hours of the morning, hunched over the piano, two deep gashes in her wrists. Next to her, streaked with blood, was a note. The full contents weren’t laid out on the page, but the last part was. It scared me.

*I can’t handle it anymore. The man in the dining room, he’s poisoning himself. He’s killing himself and I can’t handle it. I can’t handle the sounds. I can’t handle the visions. Therapy won’t help. Nothing helps. I think I’m going to do it today. I think I’m going to get myself some proper help. I just wish I could come to terms with what’s happening to me.*

I set the book down and closed it. I felt hot. I’d began to sweat a little, but I knew that was due to my increasing heart rate as well as the increasing pressure of the stress on my mind. Everyone who had owned that house before me ended their lives. Ended their lives after seeing and hearing visions of those who came before them.

I felt dizzy and I got up from the table. I began to walk slowly towards the exit of the library. I needed some air. It looked to be getting dark outside.

*What the hell?*

The thought quickly vanished from my mind. I needed to see what time it was. I went to get my phone out of my pocket and I mentally kicked myself.

My phone wasn’t in my pocket.

I started moving faster. I had to check and see if it was in my car. As I unlocked the vehicle and slid into the driver’s seat, I looked around.

I mentally kicked myself again and slammed the door before punching the steering wheel multiple times. I’d left my cellphone at home. I was going to have to go back and get it.

I didn’t want to go anywhere near that house at this point. If the pattern were to continue repeating itself, I’d end up going mad and I would take my own life. I didn’t want that.

I didn’t want to die.

I drove a little faster than I should have, but through some force of sheer luck, I didn’t get pulled over once. Though, maybe I should have. I pulled into my driveway and found the house to be dark. This didn’t scare me too badly, as I hadn’t turned any of them on before I left. What did scare me was when I walked in and found the basement door to be unlocked and opened.

What the hell had happened in here for it to be open? Was it a ghost? Could a ghost physically interact with something? At that point, I had many questions, but all I wanted to do was get my phone and get out of there.

I sprinted upstairs to my room and found my phone. I grabbed it, but had to question the manner in which I’d found it. My phone was set right in the middle of my bed, screen down, my headphones wrapped up nicely right next to them. Paying it just enough mind to think about it later, I grabbed both and turned around to leave my room when I heard it. This time, the sound rang out uninhibited and unabated.

Once more, the haunting, dissonant sound of Leo Ornstein’s *Suicide in an Airplane* rang out from the basement. I froze in place and remained that way for a few seconds. The disjointed, arrhythmic melody was beautifully terrifying. It took me a good few seconds to realize the effect it was having on me. I broke out of my trance and bounded for the stairs. Reaching the base of the steps, I turned to face the basement door.

Still, to this day, I regret doing what I did next. I had not a single reason to go investigate the door. I didn’t have a reason to be any more curious than I’d been hours, days before. I had no reason to do what I did next, yet, in those following seconds, I found myself making quick strides toward the basement door. I found myself on the third step of the staircase when I stopped.

I stared down the mouth of darkness, Leo Ornstein’s haunting piano piece ringing out from the unknown piano player. Except, I knew who it was. I knew that, down in the basement, the previous owner of the house awaited me with open, bloody arms. In the short time I was living in that house, I hadn’t even thought of going into the basement. Just never occurred to me.

I’d never considered going in prior to that night, but just then, something, some strange thing was drawing me to it. Still, I fought the urge. I hadn’t gone down before, and I wouldn’t be going down now.

Steeling myself, I turned around and began to make my way back up the stairs. Just before my foot left the first step, the door slammed. It could have been the wind, it could have been any force of nature. It could have just been the way the door worked. But I knew what really happened.

It wasn’t the wind that closed the door.

The door itself slammed with so much ferocity and force that it blindsided me. I expected to take it and be fine. I’d just have to open the door and then I’d be free. But that’s not what happened. No, the door hit me in the face with such a level of force that I couldn’t do anything but stand there, take it, and fall.

And fall I did. All the way down the stairs. I hadn’t received any life threatening injuries on my fall, but I knew that, should I make it out of the basement, I’d have some bruises on my body the next day. Bruises, however, were near the bottom of the list of things I needed to worry about in that moment.

Clearly now, I could hear the haunting melody being played from the piano. This time, it almost ached. It felt as though excruciating levels of pressure were being applied to the insides of my ears. My eardrums felt like they were going to *burst*.

I groaned, searching for ground to prop myself up on. The cold, concrete floor of the basement did nothing to soothe my pain inflicted from the fall. I’d landed back-up with my stomach pressing against the floor.

Gathering all the strength I could manage, I reached into my pocket and pulled out my phone. The kind of phone I had at the time didn’t have a flashlight, so I had to use the actual screen as a light source. I was mostly using it to look for something, anything I could use to get out of there. However, out of curiosity, and the need to know what was making the noise, I raised the phone up and in the direction of where I imagined the piano noises to be coming from. It was a shot in the dark, as I felt like the sounds were coming from every direction. A maelstrom of discordant, sharp piano notes.

I tried to mentally brace myself for what I would see when the light landed on the piano, but no amount of nerve-steeling or mental shielding could have prepared me for what I saw.

There, sitting on the piano bench, gaping wrist wounds weeping blood onto the floor, was the pianist that’d haunted me for the last couple of days. She whipped blood over the pristine white keys of the piano and the surrounding area as she played with a fervor unbecoming of a suffered spirit forever destined to remain in this accursed house.

I tried to stifle the scream I knew was coming, but it was no use. This wasn’t something I could just look at and then not care about for the rest of my day. Until that point in my life, I had not experienced one thing that equaled a fraction of the unbridled, primal fear I was feeling in my gut. It felt as though someone had dropped an ice cold rock in the pit of my stomach.

She must have noticed the light on her, because a short time after I had bathed her in it, she stopped playing the piano. Without warning, without anything that could have indicated that she was to stop. She halted, completely and quietly. Her face was the first thing I saw, as she turned to look me dead in the eyes.

The pit in my stomach grew larger and I felt something catch in my throat. Whether it was my fight-or-flight kicking in, I didn’t know. What I was aware of, however, was the increasingly quick rate at which my heart began to beat. I felt waves of fear wash over me again and again.

Then, she got up from the bench. The sounds of bare feet slapping against wet, bloody concrete terrified me, but as she approached closer and closer, something else came to me. The fear remained in my body as strong as it had ever been, and hopefully as strong as it would ever be. But there was something else. A sudden surge of energy, a burst. Something I could use. Something that would help me get out of that basement and out of that damned house.

I used that burst of energy to get up and turn around. Just before I made it to the stairs, I felt her grab my arm. I was about to whirl around and try to get her off of me when the physical properties of blood did all the work for me. Just as fast as she’d managed to grip onto my forearm, the slippery blood caused her to lose her grip and I escaped from her bloody, one handed grasp.

As I bounded up the basement stairs, I didn’t think of whether she’d be able to get out or not, but that was far from the most important thing on my mind. I reached the top of the stairs and opened the door. To my surprise, it wasn’t locked, but I wasn’t going to complain. I slammed it behind me with enough force to send small cracks through the door and cause it to splinter slightly.

I wasn’t taking any time to rest. I sprinted to the kitchen, grabbed a dish towel, turned the stove on, and lit the dish towel ablaze. I made my way back out to the main area and threw the flaming rag. Just then, I heard the basement door crash open, but I was already running through the open front doorway.

Now, the sounds of the piano weren’t anywhere to be found. As I got in and started my card I found the reason for that.

Looking through the open front door, I could just barely make it out. But I knew what I was looking at. Dripping blood onto the floor, smile on her face, was the woman playing the piano. As the spreading flames licked at the stairs and the doorframe of the basement, she turned around and began to walk back down the stairs. Behind her, the door slammed and the flames began lapping at it more fiercely.

I didn’t care about that, though. I cared about getting away from that house as quickly as possible. And as far away as possible. I didn’t want a thing to do with that place anymore. As a matter of fact, I decided that night that I didn’t want anything to do with that town in general. As I drove, I remembered the blood she’d gotten on me. I went to find something to wipe it off on when I actually got a good look at my arm.

There was nothing on it but a slowly forming bruise from my fall. I accepted it and kept my eyes on the road.

I’m not sure how long I drove for, only that I ended up in Davenport, Iowa, nearly 24 hours later. I checked into a shitty motel and watched the news in Vermont for a few minutes. They’d covered the burning down of that house from late in the night until right then when I watched it. Strangely enough, they treated it as though it was an accident. It wasn’t, but I suppose there wasn’t any evidence left to say otherwise.

After a good night’s sleep, I decided to actually look around town for a bit.

I eventually got acclimated to the town of Davenport, Iowa. I got a decent job, coincidentally, at another bank. I managed to save up enough and buy another house, albeit years after the event. The new house was a lot smaller than the previous one. Or is, I suppose, since I still live there. When I bought said house, it was under the specific condition that it did *not* have a basement.

Another thing I was worried about was living alone, but as of eight and three years ago, 2018 and 2023, I don’t have to worry about that anymore.

It’s just me, my wife, and our daughter in this house now. I work, spend time with my family, and I write when I can. It’s a good life, one I never thought I’d have. It certainly wasn’t what I was thinking about in that basement. But I don’t willingly think about the basement or that house anymore. Not willingly.

I’ve never told my wife about the Suicide House or the phantom piano player, and I don’t think I plan on doing so. Not for a while, at least. Maybe I’ll tell her and my daughter when she’s older. We’re living a good life, and I don’t want to tarnish that.

It’s not all perfect, though.

You see, I may have physically escaped the house, but even 16 years later, the memories of what happened in that place still plague me. I still dream about my parents and the car crash they got in, but they aren’t the only ones.

I dream about the man that hanged himself in one of the upstairs bedrooms. I dream about the woman who drowned herself in an upstairs bathroom. I dream of the woman who shot herself in the kitchen. I dream of the man who poisoned himself in the dining room. And I always dream about the woman in the basement who carved into her wrists the wounds of death. I dream of every single one.

They don’t scare me, not as much as they did anymore. They may not have come to terms with their lives and the subsequent ending of those lives, but I have.

Call me selfish, call me whatever you want, but that’s the truth. Still do I dream about the occupants of that house, but I don’t run in fear. I comfort them, tell them that it wasn’t their fault, that I care.

The house is gone, but the memories remain. The dreams, I can deal with those. But, there’s something else that happens to me. It isn’t nightly, but it happens just frequently enough that there’s consistency in its occurrence.

Sometimes, I’ll wake up real early in the morning. I don’t know what causes me to awaken, but every time, without fail, I go downstairs.

If the house is quiet, and I concentrate hard enough, I can just barely hear it.

Somewhere below me, I can faintly hear the haunting, dissonant chords of Leo Ornstein’s *Suicide in an Airplane*.",1,1770499106.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

1qyppql,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qyppql,Hario Neo 02 - My experience after 2 weeks of daily use + NOMAD - Mariana Natural,"I\`ve seen posts about long drawndown times and filter clogs with the Neo. I had the exact same problem when it arrived.

Here are my tips for anyone wanting to use this method daily without troubles.

**Key Behavior**

* Excessive agitation + wall pours = instant clog (V60 clogs too, but way harder to mess up)
* start using the same grind settings you already use with V60.
* Start the pour with tight center circle and open slightly as water rise. Don\`t hit the walls!

To better illustrate, here's my latest brew. Even though Nomad roasted it for espresso, i brewed it on Neo.

**Coffee**

* **Variety**: F1 Mariana (Cross: Iapar 59 × Ethiopian)
* **Altitude**: 1.200m
* **Process**: Natural
* **Roast**: Medium
* **Producer**: Mariana
* **Region**: Costa Rica
* **Notes**: Banana, yellow kiwi, dehydrated mango

**Recipe**

* **Water:**  88°C (15 TDS total, \~5ppm Mg + 5ppm Ca + 5ppm Na)
* **Filter:** Cafec T-90
* **Grind:** K-Ultra 7.0
* **Ratio:** 1:15 (18@270g)
* **Pours:**
   * **00:00 | Bloom:** 56g in circular pattern + rao spin
   * **00:30 | 1st pour:** start pour tight center circle and open slightly as water rise until 270g + rao spin
   * **02:00 | TBT**

I rarely do more than 3 pours and always aim for extractions under 2:30 regardless of the conical brewer I'm using. Anyway, **adjust based on your cup preferences/results**.

**Sensory**

* **Dry aroma:** Mango, banana, sweet touch
* **Wet aroma:** Ripe banana, mango, almond nuance

**Palate**

* **Hot:** Almond-forward, ripe banana, subtle mango, boozy, elegant finish evoking amaretto.
* **Warm:** Banana more prominent, heightened sweetness and body.
* **Cold:** Good acidity, mango steps forward, intensified amaretto with banana/mango background. Long, pleasurable, persistent finish.

**Note:** Caught a faint kiwi trace, very subtle.

Unlike the regular V60, with the Neo I don't feel **as much difference** between filters (obviously it exists, but it's **considerably smaller**). Tested Hario white/natural, Timemore, 3bomber and Cafec T-90/Abaca.

1qypp2h,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualIreland/comments/1qypp2h/experience_with_severe_insomnia/,Experience with Severe Insomnia,"Hi, so I'm basically writing this as a vent style post, obviously I'll take any advice into consideration if I haven't already heard it before. I decided to write this post after seeing the feedback from a similar user yesterday.


For the last year, I've been having massive problems falling asleep, I'm 24 male and every night it takes me several hours of lying in bed before I can finally sleep. I basically feel like a shell of myself, I'm sleeping for maybe 4 to 6 hours a night.

The time I go to bed doesn't really seem to matter as it seems to always take between 2 and 3 hours to fall asleep.

I don't seem to have a problem staying asleep just getting there.



What I've tried so far:

(Obvious Things)

1. No screens several hours before bed, instead audiobooks and actual paper books. Also reducing blue light as much as possible 

2. Going to bed at the same time every night, (Have tried varying the times as well).

3. No coffee or caffeine, (not difficult considering I mostly drink water and milk) 

4. No alcohol (not difficult considering I don't drink alcohol) 

5. Not exercising immediately before bed (some people actually recommend that you do this, but I've tried both ways neither helps) 

6. Trying to associate being in bed with only sleeping 

7. Meditation and breathing exercises, 

(Less obvious Things)

1. Supplements, including Valerian root, magnesium, and a few other random ones I forget. 

2. Melatonin, liquid and tablet form. This one is probably the most frustrating, people swear by it but unfortunately I seem to be somewhat resistant to it as it has no effect on me whatsoever, varying the times I take it hours before bed vs immediately before sleeping, and everything in between. Also I've messed around with dosages, tried as little as 0.2 mg all the way up to 5 mg and  it has zero effect. 

3. Not drinking (water) too close to bedtime 

4. Making sure I'm not dehydrated before I go to bed, 

5. Exercising as soon as I wake up.

6. Going outside immediately after waking up to expose myself to sunlight.


(Outside Help)

So being a 24-year-old man, this pattern is obviously very strange. I don't suffer from anxiety, I'm not stressed over work, so I really don't know what the cause is.

I have spoken to my GP multiple times, unfortunately the first time was basically, have you tried losing weight and having warm milk before bed. 

After losing 20 kg and swearing that I've tried everything, My GP eventually agreed to do bloods and hormone tests. Unfortunately in this case everything came back normal.

I am currently trying to get put on a list to see a sleep specialist, but even then I'd imagine the wait times are enormous.

About the only thing that will work are extremely powerful sleeping tablets, unfortunately due to my age I'm obviously not going to be able to get them long-term from the GP. In fact the only reason I know that they work is because I asked my father if I could try some of his. They do work but even then the effect is mild. I'd also be incredibly worried about the long-term side effects of this so I avoid taking them.


Anyway sorry for the rant/vent but this has basically taken over my life.


Edit1: thanks for all the feedback already guys, I went through a journal and actually found a few other things I've tried so I decided to add them just have a complete list. 


1. Some random essential oils and herbal teas my mother swore by,

2. Only listening to audio books I've already listened to. 

3. Some mental games to play to do with counting and rearranging letters etc.

4. Sleep masks, I also went full grow house mode and put tin foil on my windows, took it down after it didn't help anything.

5. Don't know how I forgot this one but white noise, rain thunderstorms people talking etc.

Basically just made an account so I could tell y'all about my experience

So for reference I am bisexual and I knew that from a young age, and back then I ate anything, it was a standard British diet. I always liked both men and women but I would say it was about 80/20 with a strong preference for women

Next around my teen years I went vegetarian and during this time I suffered a lot and my health went down the drain, lost friends, etc. Basically my life was falling apart and I couldn't figure out why. I even wanted to go vegan because I thought maybe that was the issue

Then I looked at the protein bars and black coffee I was consuming every day and I realized oh no this isn't right.. 😢

So I decided to do research and I found someone online called ""Goatis"" and then some of the more famous people like Aajonus Vonderplanitz

Now I've been eating raw primal consistently for a number of years, I feel amazing and my life has completely turned around! However, I am now extremely attracted to men. I literally have never been this horny in my life and the only thing I can think about is dick!! 🍆 

I go Pinterest and look at sexy guys with these beautiful muscular bodies and I'm just totally enamoured by them in a way I never thought possible. I literally feel so gay and it's insane because no one talks about this side effect.. if it is a side effect? I don't know, honestly

Basically the bottom line is I really want to date and have a relationship with a man. I think it would be a lovely experience and I wanted to ask anyone else who may have also turned gay because of this diet if they are experiencing a similar problem. Well, I guess it's not a problem unless I make it one, but honestly, I'm really ashamed 😞

She’s heavy into the gym like my self. She even got me out of my comfort zone. Going hiking and hitting local trails. Coffee spots. Even walking dogs up for adoption on trails. Talked for hours on the phone and texted often. Seen each other every other day. Worked out a few times together . She was very touchy feely lots of kisses chilled at her house a few times. And just suddenly January 16 sent her a text while I was in the gym. I was just checking in with her and about 10 mins later   got a text from her saying

“this may come as a shock but after a-lot of thinking I’m not want she want’s romantically and we aren’t aligned and she don’t see me as a  future parter and would no longer like to continue this connection. I liked her text with a heart emoji and responded “All good.

Honestly I was suprised to get that text as we were just hanging out at her place cuddling and kissing  the night before. I respected her. Didn’t pressure sex was trying to do things right. And it left me questioning myself about what I could have done wrong. Just trying to get better understanding. I’m not a person that’s about to chase her but it’s been on my mind. I did notice like she would have mood swings and blame it on her PCOS but I understood and gave her space when she was out of wack. Just trying to gain understanding here. She was the perfect match. Not trying to beat myself up about it. But it sucks.

And I’m wondering should I reach out or just let it be. Obviously she’s not concerned and haven’t heard from her either. How could you both be so locked in then it crumble. Not sure if it was a third party involved or she found something better and moved on.",1,1770498819.0,Advice,6,0.6,False

The problem is that he has a girlfriend and they live together.

We’ve never met in real life, but we’ve been following each other on Instagram for years because we share mutual friends and we are in a very niche field/major. Last summer we started talking almost daily. It was friendly, but there was definitely an emotional connection forming.

At some point he told me he had started a relationship with someone, so I backed off and we stopped talking. However, after some time we somehow started talking again. I stopped it again because I felt guilty. Now I’ve found myself in the same situation for the third time.

Our conversations are technically “friendly” and we don’t sext or do anything explicit, but we’ve both admitted that we might have feelings for each other. We talk every day, share personal things, and have deep conversations. I genuinely enjoy talking to him and I feel like he understands me in a way most people don’t.

Over time he has given several reasons why he “can’t break up right now”, (I never expected that from him) which makes me feel conflicted because he continues to keep this emotional closeness with me while still being in a relationship.

He will be in my area soon for work (only briefly), and we talked about meeting for a coffee since neither of us has much time. Part of me thinks meeting him could answer some questions and make things clearer, but another part of me feels like this is already an emotional affair and meeting would cross a line. I’m trying to handle this in the healthiest way possible and avoid hurting anyone, including myself.

What would be the best way to set boundaries here?

Would meeting him for coffee likely make things clearer, or would it just deepen the attachment?

Also, how do people usually detach from this kind of emotional connection when there is no official relationship?

I’m not trying to “steal” him and I don’t want to be the other woman, but I’m struggling to detach. Thank you for your advices!",0,1770498630.0,relationship_advice,9,0.17,False
1qypifc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qypifc,Pilot Slime Review III,"I hit Pilot's Antarctica restock 😌😌 my order was Teddy Bear Stuffing, La Push Beach​, This is the slime of a killer Bella, Cat Cafe, Whale Watching, Glacier Water, Petrichor. 

I also got Chai Latte Cold Foam, which I didn't order?? I haven't gotten freebies from her before, minus her Black Friday sale... I'm almost wondering if it was misplaced.. Or..idk. Not going to complain, tho. 

\---------------------------

Teddy Bear Stuffing:​

​it smell like a baby, dude. I'm obsessed. There's also a hit of carmel when you stretch it.

The teddy Bear is too fricken cute. I love it. 

Now, I'm not a huge fan of wet icee slime, which this is, but once you play with it for a while, the cloud component comes in, and makes a really soft fluff of a slime. I'm a fan of that. 

Overall - 8/10 it's so cute, dude

\---------------------------​​​

La Push Beach:

Scent wise, it's similar to Ice Cave. This one does actually have a hint of lake air..somehow.

Add ins are a stick and rock charm, and mini pebbles. The full stick fr made me lol, I forgot that it came with. They're ​neat. 

It was a little overactivated, so I have to add glycerin. It's a nice texture; I like the pebble to rock ratio. 

Overall - 6/10 nice, but not overwhelming

\-------------------------

TITSOAKB:

Pilot Slime's apple scents.. I've grown ​​​​​quite fond of you. I have three of their apple based scents, and all of them smell similar, but each still have unique hints. This one is a very light apple. Not overly sweet, or cinnamon-y

The apple is charming, cute not notes.

This thing is HEAVY. like I pulled it out of the box, and it was noticeable even then. You don't even notice the grit until you do, and then it's super nice. The only time ​​​I've noticed fallout is when it rips, and then you can here the beads go FLYING. They're super small, and you can barely see them, which is a little inconvenient. 

Overall - 8/10 a very unique texture for PS that I'm loving

\----------------------

​Cat Cafe:

I don't personally think it smells like the described scents. For once, I literally can not think of what it smells like. I am not personally a fan. However, it's light enough that I don't really notice it unless it's right beneath my nose. 

Add-ins: I felt evil destroying that cat 💔 it was so cute. The cup is cute too, I think my little sister is currently using it for a tea party. 

It's one of the bubbly slimes I have ever played with. Even after mixing the clay in, it's super bubbly. A peak chewy slime

Overall - 7/10 white glue clays never miss

\-----------------------

Whale Watching:

Smells like an ocean breeze candle, or like the laundry scents beads. It's delicious. 

The whale tail clay was super soft, and didn't really change the texture which I love. 

My first bingsu, and I'm in love. It's so sizzly, and bubbly, and crackly and ugh 😫 it's also super soft after adding the clay in!!​

Overall - 9/10​

\------------------------------

Glacier Water:

Okay.. I hate being honest about this, but it kind of just smells like lemon bathroom cleaner. There's also a lingering paraffin smell from the wax crackers. 

The wax cracker itself was a nice thickness and was satisfasatisfying to snap. The little beads are pretty too. 

Pilot's Clear bases are always so nice. The frogspawn beads are new for me too. it's not a huge texture difference to me​, more so the frogspawn simply elevated the texture. Idk 💔

Overall - 6/10 the scent is really what lessens it for me. I'll have to give it another sniff when I'm home and give it another go. 

\-------------------

Petrichor:

It smells like lawn clippings that have been sitting the bag for a few days after it rained with a hint of sweetness. Odd? Yeah. Off putting? Not really, at least for me. 

The add ins are cute. I didn't add them in because I didn't want to make a mess with the grass sheddings. 

It inflated so fast, which I really liked. It's a nice crunchy texture without being abrasive, so I would recommend if you like that!!

Overall - 8/10 I can tell why it's a best seller

\-----------------------

Chai Latte Cold Foam:

It smells like a coffee candle I got from TjMaxx. It's also similar to their toasted marshmallow which I believe was a mystery slime. 

Add ins were a little coffee bean and brown mica(?) powder. 

This is the silkiest thing I have ever touched. Literally so soft, and smooth​​. 

Overall - 8/10 one of my new favorite smooth textures. 

\-----------------

Overall: 8/10

Ofc, it's always great. ​so many great new textures for me!!

1. 3 MRIs with and without contrast
2. 14 CTs (angio and whatever the other non-blood vessel related CT is called
3. Over 100 urine dip stick tests
4. 17 Culture/PCR tests
5. 2 Colonoscopies
6. Prostate & SV surgery
7. 6 Months of Pelvic Floor therapy with 4 different therapists (on-going)
8. 3 Microgenx semen tests (this thing is garbage. I saw all of the mods talking shit on the Microgenx NGS testing and thought Id prove them wrong. 3 nuts in 3 cups over 4 months and all three tests had 1. different bacteria each time 2. Antibiotic resistances and recommendations were all incorrect... which leads me to think that these idiots are just.. well.. idiots lol
9. More than 16 different antibiotics, all from 7 to 30 day cycles. These have been the only things that have brought any relief. Muscle relaxers, Valium, meloxicam, Celebrex, Tylenol and OTC NSAIDS do nothing for my pain short or long term (best in my case have actually been cephalosporins, Bactrim, Doxy, and the common UTI abx don't do a thing for me) 
10. 14 day trial of Diflucan. Theory was that maybe the ABX had caused a fungal growth, so I gave it a try.
11. 14 day trial of Ivermectin- took a stab at parasitic infection. I'd rather pass away trying that live with my yingyang on fire every day. This was Shakey at best but it was at least the pills and not the BS paste in the tube
12. Tramadol and OXY, don't really touch the pain tbh. Maybe take the edge off but I quit taking it bc in my application, the risk doesn't outweigh the benefit.
13. Flomax for 3 weeks. Didn't do a single thing except made me super dizzy and nauseous

ON TO POSITIVITY

Things I have learned

1. MRI has shown diffuse inflammation in prostate
2. Bilateral varicoceles ( that I think are made better or worse by pelvic floor muscle tightness. can elaborate in comments if yal ask).
3. Pudendal nerve issues? (unspecified and unverified, waiting for Pain management referral to kick in to try nerve blocks) Even on my best days with full stream power, no pain or anything, I still cant sit down flat on my ass, and even crooked I have to sit on a donut with my leg bent fully, foot rested on the chair and essentially slightly lifting me up or my rectum and taint will cramp like CRAZY, usually can walk this off over 2 to 4 days
4. SVs are wide open and so is the prostatic tubes. Surgery confirmed I'm not ""clogged or infected"" at the time in that specific region. I had this surgery done bc 1 SV looked full while the other did not. This was more about fertility and less about suspected pain.

Even with all of this, I still have

1. burning penis base
2. twinges of pain in penis shaft
3. cold burning static-like pain in testicles
4. Cramp-like pain in taint
5. sharp pain in lower front abdomen around pubic bones
6. Bladder cramps from belly button to privates
7. rectal spasms
8. weaker stream and ill drip dribble pee for quite a bit of time post urination
9. Pain along where the legs meet the body, like the ""sides of the taint""
10. dripping pee for 20/30 seconds after urination
11. weird shiver twinge style jolts of feeling in pelvis
12. smelly pee in AM. First pee stinks like stinky pee, then i drink coffee and then my pee smells like coffee (strong and noticeable)

I have started a round of doxycycline that has done nothing for me this go around. I usually switch to Cefdinir for 7 to 10 days when that doesn't work and things are really bad like they are now and everything usually goes away. Both of these are ""safer"" (not really, but keep reading) as cefdinir is actually not really well absorbed into tissues and people take doxy daily for things like acne and other unrelated problems.

So basically, I'm at a loss of where to go next. I'm thoroughly stumped and out of suggestions.",1,1770498333.0,Prostatitis,5,1.0,False
1qypdu1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialMediaMarketing/comments/1qypdu1/i_audited_500_instagram_accounts_in_late_2025/,I audited 500+ Instagram accounts in late 2025. Here is what is actually working vs what isn't.,"Everyone keeps screaming ""just post more Reels,"" but after auditing over 500 accounts in the last 3 months (mix of E-com, Personal Brands, and Local Biz), the data is painting a slightly different picture.

I wanted to share the raw trends we’re seeing across our client accounts so you can stop guessing.

1. Carousels are the new ""Save"" magnets For accounts under 10k followers, Carousels are currently outperforming Reels in terms of Saves and Shares by about 20%. While Reels definitely still get more reach (views), we are noticing that Carousels are actually driving more followers. Takeaway: Stop posting single images. If you can turn that photo into a 4-slide ""story"" or educational carousel, do it.

2. The ""3-5 Hashtag"" Rule I know this is debated, but for us, the days of 30 hashtags seem to be over. Accounts using 3-5 hyper-specific tags (e.g., #chicagocoffee instead of #coffee) are seeing better SEO ranking on the Explore page. The algorithm seems smart enough to know what your video is about now without the spam tags.

3. ""Original Audio"" vs. ""Trending Audio"" This was surprising. For business accounts, using Trending Audio actually hurt retention slightly in our tests—likely because users were tired of hearing the same song 50 times. Original audio (talking directly to the camera) is building trust much faster than trends.

4. The Bio Formula If your bio still just says what you sell, change it. The top-converting bios right now follow a simple formula: Who you help + How you help + Social Proof.

Bad: ""NYC Real Estate Agent.""

Good: ""Helping First-Time Buyers find homes in Brooklyn. $50M+ Sold.""

\*\*ABOUT BONE CHINA MATERIAL\*\*

Bone China is a hybrid hard-paste porcelain containing bone ash. Bone china is extremely hard, intensely white and will allow light to pass through it. Strength is provided by the fusion of ingredients during firing. This unique pottery body is made from the following: 

\--50% animal bone

\--25% china clay

\--25% china stone 

Bone ash is used in the production of bone china and makes up about 50% by weight of the final body recipe. It is produced from treated animal bone, which is then heated to about 1000 C.  At that extreme temperature, any residual organic material is burned off and the structure of the bone is altered to be able to form bone china. The high temperature used also sterilizes the bone. Once finely ground in water, the resulting bone elements gives traditional English bone china its translucency and sharp whiteness.

I'm a pretty standard young man looking for a young lady to spend the rest of my days with. I've known that I've wanted this since I was a young kid and over 20 years later I'm still after it! I know these things can be a chore to read through so I'm quickly gonna go through who I am and who I hope you are! I tried to break this post up into easy to read lists as best I could without leaving out important info so it's not just a wall of text. In the interest of both your time and my own, **I kindly ask that you read the post carefully in case you see anything that could a dealbreaker for either of us.** With that out of the way...

About me:

* Born and raised in the suburbs about 45 minutes outside the city of Philly. This place will always be home to me, but I've decided that I don't want it to be home forever. Barring any drastic changes, I would like to relocate elsewhere within the US, ideally to a colder climate (I've had Minnesota circled for a while now but I'm open to other ideas!). I have no problem staying in the general area either, just need to get out of my hometown.
* Physically, I stand at around 6'1-6'2, 285 pounds. I know that may sound bad, but I have a big frame and it fits me quite nicely! Think bigger NFL player (O-line, tight end, etc). I've got broad shoulders and a nice chest, perfect for use as a pillow during cuddles! I've also got a lot of body hair so hopefully you're cool with that! I have short brown hair that's thick and fluffy, and tend to keep my face clean shaven.
* My hobbies are the typical nerdy stuff, video games (PC & Switch 2, ask me about my animal crossing island!), legos, collecting plushes, and adding to my ever expanding pajama drawer! I'm always down to get into new things though! Also a big Philly sports fan (I promise we're not as crazy as the internet makes us seem!).
* I'm generally more on the shy and reserved side, but once I open up I can be a yapper. Communication is super important to me, both for relationships and life in general, be that talking about an issue that needs to be resolved or just random things. I also love just talking while cuddling, being either the talker or the listener if one of us is yapping.
* I currently work part/full time at a grocery store. It's not my favorite thing in the world but I've been there a while and figure just stick to what I know. I'm currently also enrolled as a student at my local community college going for an associate's degree in business! While both of these pursuits keep me quite busy, I have no issue making time as needed.
* As far as physical intimacy goes, I'd say that I'm extremely affectionate. Absolutely love to give hugs and kissing just makes me feel complete in a way that nothing else really does. Also just generally love all kinds of physical touch! (We can discuss bedroom stuff if we click!)
* I'm an open book, so if there's something here you haven't seen that you're curious about, feel free to ask!

As for you, you are

* 24-32 (willing to budge a year or two on this)
* **Childfree** (this means you neither have NOR want children. This is non-negotiable.)
* Want to find someone to spend forever with (marriage preferred)
* monogamous
* Cis AFAB woman. Very sorry to my AFAB enbies and trans girlies (and AMAB enbies and trans guys for that matter), love ya, I will always be an ally in the fight to be who you are without fear but y'all are just not for me romantically speaking.)
* close enough to whereabouts I'm at so we can see each other regularly
* NOT a cigarette smoker!

And that's all I've got! I'm happy to exchange pics once the conversation gets rolling a bit and there's some chemistry. I hope to hear from you soon! Please include the following info in your intro message:

* First name
* Age
* What about my post stood out to you and/or made you want to reach out

If you're not sure what to say in your first message, here are a few conversation starters/hot takes I hold:

1. blue cheese > ranch and it's not particularly close
2. coffee is nasty
3. What's the nicest thing someone else has ever said about you?

I think it's reducing the frequency of my BMs, but I think it's also making me feel kind of sleepy.

Does the drowsiness go away? Is there anything I can do about it?

From what I understand, hyoscyamine has a short half-life, so it's not like I could take it in the evening. I find myself desperately wanting to nap, or at least get some coffee, but neither of those options are feasible for me. I'm in grad school and can't be napping every day, and coffee wrecks my stomach and would defeat the purpose of taking hyoscyamine.",3,1770498140.0,ibs,2,1.0,False

I’m looking to meet new people in Boston for casual hangouts - coffee, drinks, maybe catch a concert (I’m into pop/rock shows). Trying to socialize more and expand my circle.

A bit about me:

I’m a software engineer / UX designer who enjoys learning new things - currently learning to drive (better late never!). I do photography around Boston and Massachusetts, love video games with good storytelling, and read books that give you something to think about. I write occasionally on Medium and work on a theory project at the intersection of philosophy and physics.

What I enjoy:

	∙	Good conversations about ideas, culture, philosophy - but also fine with just hanging out

	∙	Pop/rock concerts and live music

	∙	Coffee shops and cocktail bars

	∙	Photography walks around the city

	∙	Gaming (narrative-focused stuff mainly, but also open to party gaming)

	∙	Reading and discussing books

What would be great:

Meeting people who enjoy exploring ideas and don’t mind the occasional philosophical tangent, but also know how to just relax and have fun. Ideally looking for people who value depth but aren’t pretentious about it.

I’m married, so looking for platonic friendships only. Open to one-on-one hangouts or small group activities.

We just went for a coffee and spoke for 2 1/2 hours and it was great. He seems to match a lot of of the things that I really want which is really hard to find in LA.

I want to send him a message and ask him if he’s open to going to a comedy show that I’m actually going to later on anyway.

Would it be weird to just send him a message right away asking him if he wants to meet up later on tonight and come to the comedy show I was going to, even if I just met him today? If it helps at all we met on Feeld so I think that crowd usually is much more open in enthusiastic than the regular Hinge or Bumble crowd.

My reasoning is that we usually don’t have that much time to plan with our kids schedule and our second date may not happen for another two weeks, and we are both available right now, so why not? I really enjoyed this company and it seems like he really enjoyed mine too.

1qyp6sz,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1qyp6sz/a_fortnight_in_japan_some_tips_from_a_frequent/,A fortnight in Japan: some tips from a frequent visitor,"Hello,

I'm not long back from another trip to Japan so thought I'd put together some useful information I've gathered over my many, many trips to the country. Hoping I haven't re-tread too much but expect some of this has been posted about before.

My first tip is never ever listen to influencers, they are salespeople.

On a lighter note some information that I've found useful:

\* buy an imabari towel in a convenience store when you get there. The vast majority of toilets will have soap, but hand-dryers or paper towels are less common and get thin on the ground the further from city centres you get, the towel is easy to stuff in a pocket. They're like 500 yen, tops.

\* while you're there buy a brolly too, usually 800 yen for a big one. Unless you're going in the off-season to Tokyo it'll likely rain and you'll be thankful for buying one. I got away with zero rain on my last trip but it was winter and a dry month, every other trip has had rain to some degree.

\* If you need the toilet, usually department stores have them, and a lot of JR stations in Tokyo have them though they are inside the fare gates.

\* when it rains in the summer, especially June, it'll be heavy but it likely won't last all day. Don't let it stop you doing activities outdoors (just see my point above), but do have a plan B in case its really heavy.

\* Taxis are not that expensive in Tokyo, on my first trip I avoided them but a late night taxi from Asakusa to Roppongi cost about 5,000 yen and was worth it since the trains were off. Taxis from and to the airport are usually around the 9-10k yen mark which is less than £50, a price well worth paying after 14-20 hours travel. Obviously shorter, normal train journeys in Tokyo are much better but there's outliers where I don't mind a taxi when I've got to get luggage to the airport or train station. An average train journey is going to be in the region of 200 yen.

\* Uber often has vouchers to reduce the price, and it can call normal taxis though the prices are a little higher than via the GO taxi app

\* Outdoors a lot of vending machines will have a bin for bottles beside them, so keep an eye out for those to chuck out empty bottles/cans

\* If you're a fan of going to gigs then I really recommend Gigs in Tokyo (and its sister site Gigs in Osaka) and their respective Discord servers. The admin posts about gigs that are upcoming and happening the same day and often you can buy tickets on the door. Costs are in the 3,000-5,000 yen range (and usually includes a drink token), you usually have to say which band you are there to see so I like to listen to the bands in advance and pick my favourite, otherwise pick a random band and they get a bit more of the ticket fee I believe. The live scene in Tokyo is incredible compared to my city.

\* if you like wrestling then [Puwota](https://en.puwota.com/index.cgi) lists pretty much every single wrestling show that is announced. You may find it difficult to buy tickets directly, as a lot of promotions sell via their fan clubs which necessitates a Japanese phone number. Some promotions will sell via TicketPay which accepts foreign numbers, such as DDT and TJPW. Chocopro - which I highly recommend if you're interested in Japanese wrestling's whackier side - sells via a foreigner friendly site I forget the name of which they link to on their official site.

TJPW you can also email them directly and they'll send you a PayPal link to pay, I think that's their preferred way since they can ask you to fill out a survey as a foreign fan but it's an option if TicketPay doesn't work or you want to pay via PayPal.

For all the rest you can usually get your tickets via a proxy like BuySumoTickets (there's likely others but that's the one I use and have had zero issues with). There's a premium involved, but you can get the ticket as a barcode to be scanned at a 7/11 which I find very useful. The ticket price will vary but expect to pay \~5,000 to 12,000 yen depending on the tier of seat you choose.

Wrestling shows can be really annoying to find information on, at least in my experience. For the big promotions like NJPW or Stardom usually they have English-language information for shows, but the smaller promotions lag behind. Googling the promotion and the venue can usually get you to the point you know what seat tiers are available or a seating plan, other times trawling through auto-translated Japanese sites is the key. Generally the highest tiers are ringside. For shows at Ryogoku Kokugikan (Sumo Hall) there's a tier called ""Box Seat"" which is the Masu seat, these usually seat four people on a mat and are pricey but they do have a good view.

Some shows will have their areas noted in kanji so looking up North (Kita), South (Minami), East (Higashi) and West (Nishi) kanji will help you figure out where you're sitting. Google translate is your friend for deciphering the ticket information when you pick it up as well. If all if still up in the air when trying to find your seat, looking confused and handing your ticket to a staff member will invariably get you the assistance you need. I may be speaking from experience. Google translate also is your friend in instances where you need to ask questions.

If there's a Baka Gaijin & Friends show on when you're in Tokyo I compel you to go, don't even think twice. It's a wild experience, well worth the entry fee.

Finally there's a bar in Kabukicho called Dropkick (on the 8th floor of a building across from the Toho Cinema with the Godzilla head) ran by DDT wrestlers with wrestling themed cocktails. The place is very welcoming to foreigners and has menus in English (though note it allows smoking). Prices are not unreasonable, beer is around 900 yen, cocktails start around the same and go up to about 1,500 yen, but note there's a cover charge/service charge if memory serves.

\* on the smoking note: a lot of places still allow smoking indoors. In Tokyo its often banned on the streets outside of designated areas, but inside I believe its legal. Out of the 8-10 bars on my last trip I went to about 6 were smoking-friendly. Other cities may vary, so worth a check of the place online before heading if you're sensitive to the odour/have respiratory issues.

\* if you are into sports like football (soccer for the deviants), American football (football for the deviants), rugby there's sports bars that will show matches like Premier League but usually only the earlier games - the 8pm kick offs during the week will be 4-5am in Japan. Pub 305 in Shinjuku often will show sports when it opens, though they tend to open around 11am during the week.

For the Super Bowl a number of places will be showing the game and opening early. A handful of Hubs will show the game, this is the list of the branches that are showing it - [https://www.pub-hub.com/index.php/en/event/detail/41042](https://www.pub-hub.com/index.php/en/event/detail/41042) . There's also a number of other sports bars, this Tokyo Cheapo article has some other options: [https://tokyocheapo.com/events/super-bowl/](https://tokyocheapo.com/events/super-bowl/)

For baseball, or J League, a lot of bars will show that. Also any Japan national team matches tend to be shown. Good Beer Faucets in Shibuya is an underrated place for watching baseball when the NPB season is on, I find.

\* If you want to go to a J League or baseball game, I would really recommend it. They tend to be a little cheaper than games back home, and the baseball experience is like a hybrid of European football fans and American baseball. If you go see the Yomiuri Giants then the food options in the Tokyo Dome are varied and largely pretty good. Plus there's a whole 'city' around the Tokyo Dome with a theme park and other attractions, it's a cool place to kill a few hours. Crucially the Tokyo Dome is indoors so if its raining it's a great way to escape it for a few hours!

I've only been to one J League game which was a Yokohama F Marinos game, but I bought the tickets directly, they were relatively affordable, there's lots of food trucks around the stadium for food and drink, plus they had a stage with entertainment on when I went. The stadium is closer to the Shin-Yokohama station so be mindful of that if planning a trip there.

\* If you like coffee there's so many options in Tokyo its an embarrassment of riches. In terms of third wave coffee shops I like Chimney Coffee and Hearts Light in Shibuya, Glitch in Ginza, Fuglen in Tomigaya, Keilo in Akihabara, Blue Bottle in Shinjuku and Brooklyn in Shimo-Kitazawa but that's only a handful of places I've been over the years and I'm sure there's better options out there. If you're in Hiroshima then Bagtown is great and in Sendai I can recommend SPARK.

\* If you like craft beer, similarly there's so many places in Tokyo its impossible to list them all. There's Brussels Beer Project in Shinjuku, Watering Hole in Yoyogi, Craftrock , DevilCraft and YonaYona in Kanda, IBrew in Shimbashi, OL by Oslo Brewing in Shibuya, GoodBeer Faucets and Craft Beer Market which have a few branches in Tokyo. Most offer food in some capacity, DevilCraft is a pizza place for example.

\* While its not my favourite place, HUB can be an easy place to go for a drink. They operate a 'cash on delivery' system, i.e. the UK method of paying when you order your drink, which isn't hugely common in Japan I find. It does have a bit of a reputation as a place local women go to pick up gaikokujin though I think that's a bit outdated and was a bit overblown to begin with.

Often I find people who want to talk to gaikokujin will strike up the conversation naturally. I don't go out of my way to talk to locals on my trips, but I can think of only one trip where that didn't happen and that's mainly because I didn't go to a lot of smaller bars or restaurants.

\* Bars open later than in the UK. I appreciate that the UK and drinking may not have the healthiest of relationships, but I am always shocked that bars don't tend to open until 5pm in Tokyo. Late night places will often open later around 8pm, and most normal bars shut around 11pm. There's definitely late night options that aren't clubs, but I'm used to bars opening around noon and shutting around midnight so its a bit of a weird culture shock. There's exceptions to the rules it must be said.

\* if you're taking a DSLR or Mirrorless camera to Japan and need sensor cleaning a couple places will do them same day. I've only used Kitamura in Shinjuku (near the west side of the station where Yodobashi is) and they did a great job - just remember to switch it back off of JPEG which I forgot to do for a couple days. Cost was around 3,000 yen I think and it took about an hour.

\* I won't dwell too much on trains/IC cards/JR Pass because they're covered endlessly here but if you have an iPhone it's so much easier to add a Suica card to your wallet and top up via card. I've topped up using an Amex, VISA and Mastercard, though I've heard people have issues.

\* I used a mix of buying on the day and Ekinet for my Shinkansen bookings. My cards worked without issue, but you can pay via cash or use the ticket counter for assistance if you're having issues.

\* For reference I took four Shinkansens, mostly in Green Car, and I still didn't spend as much as the regular car JR Pass for two weeks.

\* Trains are late in Japan, and it happens all the time. Don't believe the propaganda! Every single Shinkansen I took this last trip was at least 5 minutes delayed. The local trains often have delays but they aren't as noticeable since the headways are like 3 minutes. One very important thing to note is the train company will not put on replacement transport if they cancel a train, less of an issue in Kanto or Kansai, much more of a problem in Aomori etc.

\* on the subject of Aomori, if you go in winter especially Jan/Feb, expect disruption. Many trains were cancelled between Shin-Aomori and Aomori when I was meant to go there and I had to turn back. Additionally New Chitose is notorious for cancelling flights in bad weather - which it gets a lot in winter - and if the snow is especially bad like when I went the transport to the city can be suspended fully. Keep your plans fluid and book on flexible rates were possible if travelling the Sea of Japan coast, Sannin or Hokkaido in winter is my advice. In general, and I do mean very broad strokes, Shinkansen get cancelled less than local trains so if your route is Shinkansen based you may have more luck than taking a limited express (this is not transport advice). Keep an eye on the JR East train status page for updates for their region [https://traininfo.jreast.co.jp/train\_info/e/service.aspx](https://traininfo.jreast.co.jp/train_info/e/service.aspx) and the equivalent for other JR company's remits.

\* one over-arching and final piece of advice, and if you only listen to one thing from the post make it this, GET TRAVEL INSURANCE AS SOON AS YOU BOOK YOUR FLIGHTS. Cannot stress enough how much this has your back, on top of any protections you may have with your credit cards (in the UK there's Section 75 protections), and can often arrange a refund for costs you've paid out of pocket due to cancellations within their policy parameters. In Japan medical care is EXPENSIVE, if you are hospitalised then your bill likely will be in the tens of millions of yen and you don't want to be on the hook for that, travel insurance will cover that in a lot of cases.

Anyway I'll go back to lurking until my next trip, which is likely to be next year. Enjoy your trip to Japan, one day I'll have scratched the surface!",39,1770497813.0,JapanTravelTips,6,0.87,False

It's a short stretch of street in the arches of one of the lines that runs into the station. 

Every arch contains at least one Latin American business, most of them restaurants, caffs and/or bars, some of them beauty parlours and bakeries. Some of them a combination of these things in one space. 

I see folks build a community, I see caffs serve food for the community and I love that.

My other half had (not pictured) arepa con todo (arepa with everything), we both had coffee, and we both had huge glasses of juice - I took mine with milk that made it almost like a milkshake, my other half chose water which made it more like a smoothy.

1qyp3th,https://www.reddit.com/r/CostaRicaTravel/comments/1qyp3th/trip_report_i_enjoyed_cr_despite_only_visiting/,Trip report: I enjoyed CR despite only visiting touristy locations,"I have never written any trip reports before, but decided to write this one because I hope it will help others. This is long, but I have organized it by topics.

**About us:** me and my husband. We live in the PNW, enjoy hiking and animals. We also love food, coffee, and dark chocolate! We prioritize comfort, local experience, and convenience over cost, but we’re also not fancy (not into luxury hotels or fancy restaurants in CR). Our budget was \~$2000/person for a 10-day trip including flights.

**Transportation**: I know this sub leans toward renting a car, so I hope my perspective helps others. Even though we’re comfortable driving on narrow roads, we are not road-trip people. We don’t enjoy driving, sitting behind the wheel in traffic, or figuring out parking. We opted to not have a car and were very happy with it. Overall, we spent \~$1000 on transportation for 10 days.

Our strategy:

We used private shuttles twice to move between cities. One was right after we landed after 12 hours of flying and a red-eye flight, and we didn’t want to be driving on the road, dealing with car rental, and navigation. The driver waited for us and drove us directly to Fortuna. We were able to rest, and just 5 hours after landing in SJO, we were in Fortuna exploring the waterfall for half a day. Another private shuttle was from Monteverde to Manuel Antonio, from 7–11pm. CR is not famous for nightlife, so we figured instead of sitting inside the hotel in the evening, we should just be sitting in the car instead, and use daylight hours for exploring places and not being in a car.

We did the jeep-boat-jeep from Fortuna to Monteverde. This is a shared “shuttle” service and something you can’t do with a rental car. I really enjoyed this. The boat ride was so serene, and the drive from the boat to Monteverde was very pretty — and only $30/person.

Within each city we mostly used Uber or taxi. I booked a ride via Uber first, then aseed them for their number. I used WhatsApp to communicate where I wanted to go, ask how much it costs, and ask them to pick me up at certain times. In MA we also used the bus, and it was very cheap.

**Food**: Costa Rica food is good, but it lacks variety. Like others have said, it’s very bean-and-rice focused. We did enjoy eating seafood in MA, or walking around and finding sodas that had lots of customers and dropping by. The fruit is very good, though. I love that fresh fruit smoothies are everywhere, and being Asian-American, this is a true blessing. I’m not talking about milkshake-type smoothies, but the clean version of just fresh fruit and ice/water. We do like papaya and soursop. We also love checking out local grocery stores/farmers markets to buy passion fruit (omg they were soooo sweet — we had at least 2–3 a day haha), star apples, or buying fresh veggies to bring back to Airbnbs for a stir fry.

**Coffee / coffee shops**: Love that coffee shops open very early and there are so many options around. The coffee is good, but we’re also basic (drip/black coffee type with no sugar or milk).

**People**: Everyone here is friendly, chatty, and loves tourists. Not only in the sense that we’re giving them money, but they also go above and beyond to make sure we have a good time. It happened to me twice that my driver (Uber and private shuttle) turned around and stopped by the road to show me sloths they spotted in the trees while driving. I didn’t even ask. Slow living is a thing. They do not rush anything and really take their time to enjoy life. This was a culture shock for me since the US and Asian countries are very hustling and taking things slow was definitely not something I’m used to. Nobody asked me for tips explicitly, but occasionally there are tip jars. I don’t think they expect tips for the most part. Saying this because I did see people get surprised when I gave them a small tip. So please don’t feel obligated to tip!

**Animals** : Except for the guided night tour, I didn’t do any other guided tours and wasn’t able to spot exotic wildlife myself inside paid reserves or national parks. However, I was able to spot sloths (being active), iguanas, and macaws on the streets, at the beach, and in public places. I’d recommend taking long walks, looking up, taking it slowly, and observing the places around you - and you will see them.

**Things we did**: guided night tour, ziplining (it was my first time despite my fear of heights, and I really enjoyed it!!), volcano walks, lots of walking around town and people-watching.

**Hot springs**: Having been to Japan, I wasn’t sure I’d enjoy hot springs in CR, but I actually did. I went to Pura Vida Hot Springs (it’s next to a free location, but with a very reasonable price — $25/person when I visited). I had access to lockers, showers, towels, a free-flowing thermal river, and a pool. There was also food onsite at a good price, so I didn’t need to pay for the buffet like other locations. The hot spring in the river was just lukewarm, but that was enough for me given the summer temperatures.

**Beaches and swimming holes**: I was concerned that given the popularity and overcrowding of places we visited, there would be trash or that these places wouldn’t be enjoyable. To my biggest surprise, the swimming holes here have very clear water, no algae and no trash. MA beach is so nice and so clean, and the sand is so soft. I actually enjoy it more than beaches in Hawaii (too rocky and not warm enough) or Vietnam (nice sandy beaches but I still sometimes find trash). But the hills in MA were brutal! 😅

**Cost**: Food and coffee are similar to the US. Accommodations are affordable (we were able to find clean, well-located hotels/Airbnbs for \~$50–100/night). Excursions/attractions are the priciest part, especially parks. Coming from the PNW, I was spoiled by free parks where I could spend 2–3 hours exploring, or $10–30 for parking for day-long hiking. So having to spend $20–50/person to visit a smaller park and spend 2–3 hours there max was something very hard for me to adjust to. But I hope the money goes toward preserving nature, so I’m okay with it.",10,1770497612.0,CostaRicaTravel,3,0.92,False

Last July she had shown up with several other shades that could not find their way, and Mort immediately recognized her and recognized the potential trouble. 

I was here to make sure things didn’t get out of control. Well that and learn from the wizard of course. 

I was rereading elementary magic for the umpteenth time when I felt her. “Hey there Ms. Murphy’s shade.” I was there to make sure she remembered what she was; to ground her. I was the shade therapist. 

“Hey Fitz. I played monopoly again tonight and was winning. Again.”  I could hear a sad smile in the shade’s voice. “He is going to be in bad shape tomorrow, he forgot to drink water with his scotch, and he passed out again before the game was over.” 

“Yeah, what’s new. I’ll just make sure Will and I have coffee and Tylenol ready in the morning. How are you?”

“I’m getting tired. Fitz. He is holding on so tight. The bonds of guilt hurt.”

Mort warned me about the metaphysical bonds that could potentially hold a shade and cause it pain. “Well let’s review the memories you are made of and remember what you truly are.” 

And that is what we did every night after she was called by the ritual. He needed the time to heal and she needed the grounding to be a part of that process.

1. Discovery  
2. Ease of use. 

  
**Discovery:** is debatable on how much of that is there but I had fun with the community so I care a bit less about that. 

**Ease of Use:** This is the part that I'm having a hard time with. The reason to use platforms like Substack to me is that they handle all the hard parts. A while back I turned on  payments and Stripe to see if I can get a few extra $$ for my time. I'm mainly pulling down enough to cover a coffee once every two weeks so really not a lively hood thing. 

  
The part that's freaking me out a bit is that I have a sub from overseas. So it's asking me to register an account with that country and start collecting taxes. 

The whole reason I ended up doing substack over say my own website (ghost/payment method) was that I expected some of these issues to be made easier by substack. Instead I'm thinking of just turning off all paid subs. The last thing I want to do have an account for every regions in the world where someone might want to pay me from. 

  
How do people deal with this? This seems like a logistical nightmare.  (If this is useful, my sub was from France that flagged this issue but either ways I'd find the handling of every region insane far a smell gig worker essentially)

Zofia, a 19 year old daughter of a financially-struggling family, is sent to work as a maid in a noble household, somewhere distant.

- *Brainstorming and worldbuilding! Whether we decide to place it in our real world Victorian era, or perhaps a fictional setting, I’d appreciate it if we dedicated some time to setting up the plot, adjusting it and tailoring to our wants, deciding on the core themes as well as worldbuilding (the household, for example).*

1qyow2l,https://www.reddit.com/r/NeuronsToNirvana/comments/1qyow2l/resonance_field_report_cognitive_flow_diagnostics/,💡 Resonance Field Report — Cognitive Flow Diagnostics via Quiz-Show Self-Observation (Keto + Neurochemical Tuning) [Feb 2026],"**Observation:**  
When watching quiz shows and attempting to answer questions in real time, I can *feel* when my cognition is not in flow.  
The struggle isn’t due to lack of knowledge — it’s a detectable **state misalignment**.

**Key Insight:**  
Cognitive friction is often a *signal quality issue*, not an intelligence issue.  
When the resonance field is off, recall becomes effortful instead of emergent.

**Diagnostic Markers:**

* Hesitation despite familiarity
* Fragmented recall
* Reduced pattern recognition
* Subtle sympathetic overactivation

**Adjustment Protocol (Example):**

* ☕ [**Keto-friendly bulletproof coffee**](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeuronsToNirvana/comments/12qjuo4/ketofriendly_turmeric_coffeetea_n2nmel_apr_2023/) → stable energy, reduced glucose noise
* 🌿 **L-**[**theanine🔎**](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeuronsToNirvana/search/?q=Theanine) → smooths stress response, supports alpha–gamma coherence
* 🍃 **Stevia** → sweetness without insulin disruption

**Outcome:**  
As the body metabolises these adjustments over time:

* Cognition gradually re-enters flow
* Pattern recognition improves
* Mental effort feels lighter
* Recall becomes more natural and effortless

**Conclusion:**  
Flow is a tunable state.  
Small metabolic and neurochemical adjustments can recalibrate the resonance field and restore cognitive coherence.

This isn’t about blame or labeling anyone, but trying to understand emotional timelines from lived experience.

The person I’m getting to know came out of a long-term relationship about a year ago. The breakup involved a breach of trust, which understandably made closure harder. She has said she cut off contact a couple of months ago (breakup happened a year ago), but has also been honest that she didn't block him and he tried to keep contacting her throughout this period.

Since then, a new connection has been forming between us in a fairly organic way. We’ve been on a couple of “pseudo-dates”, long coffee conversations, walks, and activities that lasted anywhere from 1 to 3 hours. Outside of that, there’s been consistent communication, emotional and intellectual bonding, and effort to stay in touch despite a very demanding work schedule.

At one point, I clarified my intentions and told her that I like her. This wasn’t impulsive and it was based on the time spent together and the way our conversations flowed without filters. She questioned how I could feel that way after meeting only a few times, which made me pause and think on whether our timelines and emotional readiness are simply different.

What I’m trying to understand is whether this combination is common, i.e, forming a meaningful new connection while still processing unresolved emotions from a past relationship. Is it normal to move forward in this in-between state? And based on your experience, how long does it usually take to truly detach emotionally from an ex, especially when the relationship mattered and didn’t end with clean closure?",1,1770497076.0,dating_advice,11,1.0,False

1qyouze,https://www.reddit.com/r/humansarespaceorcs/comments/1qyouze/sandra_and_eric_chapter_26_stakes_pirates_and/,"Sandra and Eric Chapter 26: Stakes, Pirates, and People","“Alright, just sign here, here, and here,” a human in a military uniform said, handing Eric a datapad. Eric signed as two others wheeled over a large lockbox. Sandra looked at the ship they were at in a groggy kind of wonder, the sleek Terran Mamba looking more like a spike with engines than an actual ship making her wonder how it didn’t fall apart.

“Thanks for the speedy delivery, Sergeant,” Adam said, handing the datapad back. The human waved a hand.

“The Military Postal Service Agency will make sure all soldiers get their mail and materials, sir, whether they are on the front lines, on vacation, or in the rear lines,” the Sergeant said. “If I may ask a question, sir?”

“Go ahead,” Eric said as he looked over the heavy lockbox.

“What did Terran Command send you? That thing gave off so much energy that the Orion Station only let us through after Terran Command gave them a call and even then, Orion Station told us it was not allowed off the ship until you were here to pick it up.”

 “Reaper materials,” Eric said, three buzzes behind his ear indicating that the lockbox was not tampered with. “We have a fledgling Reaper here and needed some special materials for her training.” He smiled proudly while giving Sandra a pat on her head. “I can’t give you more than that. Even though the Reapers are public now, there are still some things that are classified well above either of our paygrades, and this right here is one of them.”

“Fair enough, sir,” the Sergeant said. He looked curiously at Sandra as she turned a light orange color and sidled behind Eric slightly. “Does this mean Reaper training is available for anyone now?”

“Still recruitment only,” Eric said with a small laugh, “but that doesn’t mean you can’t apply if you’re interested.”

“No thank you, sir,” the Sergeant said, laughing a bit as well. “I like my job as a postman and have no plans to change that. Once my contract is up, I plan on getting a freighter and becoming a space trucker. But I do know at least a few soldiers that would like to become Reapers.”

“Tell them to contact Terran Command and ask about an application,” Eric said. “But we do have standards. It’s not just combat prowess that Reaper Command looks at when recruiting.”

“I’ll spread the word then, sir,” the Sergeant snapped a salute. “I hope you have a good day. And good luck on your training, ma’am,” the Sergeant added, giving Sandra a salute as well, which she returned hesitantly, trying to mimic the soldier.

“Alright, kiddo, ready to get back to the ship?” Eric asked as the soldiers went back to their ship. Sandra nodded, rubbing her eyes as she tried to fight a yawn. “Are you getting enough sleep?” Eric asked.

“Yeah, Jessica just had me practicing the same move over and over before we got here,” Sandra mumbled. Eric picked her up and sat her on the crate before he began to wheel it to the *Dutchman*.

“Well, take a break then,” Eric said, patting her head. Sandra nodded, looking around as they moved and began to thread the crowd a bit. “Do you want a drink or something?”

“I tried asking for coffee once,” Sandra said, “but Athena said it’s toxic for Targondians.”

“Yeah, probably not a good idea,” Eric said, looking around as he pushed the cart. His eyes lingered on what looked like a coffee shop for a moment before pulling over. “Can you stay with the cart for a minute? I’ll get us something.”

“M’kay,” Sandra agreed. Eric parked in a way so that she was visible from the window and walked in. Sandra tried to keep an eye out, knowing the lockbox was important but also was really tired. The last 10 days of training had been rough, and she still wasn’t quite used to the heavier gravity that Eric was putting her under to get her used to Earth gravity. Something bumped into the crate and Sandra turned around to see another Targondian attempting to push the cart.

“Don’t try anything funny, sweetheart,” the Targondian said gently, pointing a plasma pistol at her from under his jacket. “I’ve been curious-”

Sandra just reacted. Her tail lashed out, hitting the Targondians hand so hard the plasma pistol went flying out of his hand. They both froze and blinked in surprise, watching as the pistol clattered to the ground next to them. The strange Targondian reacted first, scooping up the plasma pistol as people began to look around for the sudden noise, and the Targondian froze when he looked up and stared up at the barrel of Eric’s 10mm pistol.

“I really wouldn’t,” Eric growled, finger already on the trigger. “You have some balls, trying to kidnap a child and steal someone else’s stuff.” He held out a hand. “Now, you can either hand over your pistol and stay on the ground until the authorities arrive, or you can take the hard way and get either a really had headache or a new hole.” The Targondian hesitated for a moment before disappearing. Eric just sighed as he grabbed the air right by Sandra and slammed it into the ground. The Targondian became visible again, twitching in pain but clearly unconscious as the Port Authorities arrived.

“Hard way it is,” Eric said, holstering his pistol and keeping his hands visible as the Port Authorities began to ask questions.

…………………………………………………….

“I swear, we need a babysitter for you,” Jessica laughed. “You just love to get into and cause trouble, don’t you?” She had joined them during the questioning, both to provide backup if needed and to take the lockbox and Sandra back to the *Flying Dutchman* if Eric had to go to the Security Station.

“Not my fault people are idiots,” Eric grumbled, pushing the cart as they continued towards their ship. “But really, good on you, Sandra. That was an impressive tail-whip there.” Sandra turned a slight orange, matching some of the hues of her dress.

“It was right at the same height that Jessica was making me practice earlier,” Sandra said, burying her face. “It just reminded me so much of the training that I reacted without thinking.”

“Good, that’s what we want,” Jessica laughed again. “That’s why we practice repetition so much.”

“You’re having her practice tail-whips that much?” Eric asked, raising an eyebrow.

“Hey, if she has a spare limb that can cover her six without needing to turn around, might as well take advantage,” Jessica shrugged. “She has more range of attack and defense than we do that way.”

“Fair enough,” Eric conceded. “Maybe we need to kick up her training another notch if she’s doing this good.”

Sandra just groaned in embarrassment, keeping her head buried in her hands as they made their way to the ship.

……………………………………………………….

“And you’re sure that it was him?” Jeremiah asked the store owner.

“Yup,” the Porishta shopkeeper said. “Hard to forget green skin like that on a Cordan. It’s not a common color for them, since green is so rare for them.”

“Alright, thank you so much for your help,” Jeremiah said, tucking his datapad away. “Did he happen to say where he was going?”

“Nope,” the Porishta said, thinking. “Just bought a few gravity belts, some snacks, and a few other odds and ends before leaving.”

“Thank you again for your help then,” Jeremiah said. He left the store with Athena, thinking. “What do you think?”

“He gave no conscious or subconscious indicators that he was lying,” Athena said, her eyes glowing as she replayed the interaction. “I can say with 94.38% certainty that the Porishta did not know anything else.” Jeremiah sighed.

“So, basically no new information other than he stopped by on his way to Orion VI some weeks ago, which we also already knew.”

“Affirm.”

“Damn, I was really hoping for an easy snag,” Jeremiah sighed again. “Tracking missions always make me feel my age.”

“To be fair, sir, at your age anything probably makes you feel old,” Athena said. Jeremiah looked at her with a raised eyebrow.

“Was that an attempt at a joke?” he asked.

“It was,” Athena said. “Did I do it wrong?”

“No, just surprising to hear it coming from you is all,” Jeremiah shook his head. “Looks like you are starting to apply what you have been learning by watching us.”

“Ever since Quin, Shao, and Nightclaw have helped me with a few additions to my frame, I have been having both an easier and harder time understanding organic interactions,” Athena admitted. “I have begun to piece together the when’s and how’s, to an extent, but not the why’s or the appropriate timing.”

“That is something that just comes with practice and experience,” Jeremiah said. ""Don’t rush it. You might be, what, 20 something at this point?”

“I was put into action 22 Earth years ago,” Athena said, “but I did not gain a rudimentary sense of self until 8 years ago, and an understanding of self until 4 years ago.”

“So, 22 years old, but limited experiences then,” Jeremiah said. “People go their entire lives not understanding social interactions. Look at Shao, he hates people as a general rule. So don’t rush it, just learn, experiment, and have fun with it.”

“I will certainly try, Captain,” Athena said.

…………………………………………

“Still don’t know why I gotta be here,” Shao grumbled in the cargo hold.

“Because these things take 3 Reapers to open,” Eric grunted, setting the lockbox down off the cart. “You know the safety protocol as much as I do. Everybody else is currently information gathering before we head off to Orion VI.”

Shao grumbled a bit more but took his place at the front of the lockbox. He placed his thumb in a slot, barely flinching as it was pricked by a needle. “Reaper Mantis, permission granted,” Shao said, taking his thumb back.

“Reaper Dragon, giving permission,” Eric said, placing his thumb in a separate slot and getting pricked.

“Reaper Snake, giving permission,” Jessica said, doing the same. Eric nodded at Sandra, who placed her hand on a panel he indicated.

“Ummm, Trainee Wyvern, receiving,” Sandra said, saying the phrase that Eric had told her to say earlier. She took her hand off after something beeped, and there was a hiss as the lockbox unlatched. With Eric’s encouragement, Sandra slowly lifted the lid, a blue and yellow glow emanating from it. Inside was a glowing crystal, about a foot long and 6in wide in the middle, tapered at both ends. One half of the crystal gave a yellow glow while the other half glowed blue. Sandra stared in wonder at the object, trying and failing to follow the gentle pulses racing along the surface.

“It’s always a beauty to behold,” Eric said, patting Sandra’s head. “That right there is the source of a Reapers melee weapon.”

“What does it do?” Sandra asked almost reverently.

“At it’s most basic, it’s a power source,” Shao said, looking over the crystal before shaking his head. “Neither the oscillation of our vibro-blades nor the output of our shields would be possible for long periods without an extremely powerful power source. That crystal right there gives us that power, and then some. The blue half gives a blade both the power and the vibrations necessary to cut through almost anything, while the yellow half generates and sustains the shields we use, which is why they glow the colors that they do.”

“And they don’t lose their power when cut down to size either,” Jessica said, grinning. “Makes it very effective in weapons, armor, and shields.”

“This is going to be your power source for all three of them,” Eric said. “Some of the blue for your weapon or weapons, some yellow for your shield, and the rest will go into your armor to both power it and protect you. It’s not sentient, but it will provide something akin to a symbiotic relationship with you.”

“How?” Sandra asked, running her hand along the crystal, marveling at its beauty.

Eric shrugged. “There are theories, but the creation of these crystals is beyond top secret,” he said. “The only people who know is the creator, and maybe Reaper and Terran Command.”

“But this also means we’re ramping up your training,” Jessica grinned. “Once we find you a melee weapon you like, we are going start teaching you how to make them, how to apply the crystal to them, how to make shields, and, most importantly, how to make and maintain your armor. This crystal will become your partner for the rest of your life.” Sandra nodded mutely, staring at the crystal that was soon going to become her partner.

Eric knelt next to Sandra. She looked at him. “When I say this is beyond top secret, I mean it. And I am going to be very clear, so take this seriously.” Sandra nodded. “You do not talk to anybody about this crystal except us, and that is only during and for training only. Outside of training, this crystal does not exist. You do not know anything about this crystal, you do not know it even exists, nothing. Outside of the training room, do not bring it up, not even to us. Not to Nightclaw, not to Athena, not to me, nobody. It is that important that you do not speak about this, nor even think about it outside of training. If you let this slip to anybody outside of training, it can and will get you removed as a possible Reaper, and the crystal will be sent back to Earth. Am I clear?”

“Yes, sir,” Sandra said.

“Good. I don’t want to be mean or harsh, but this is of the highest importance,” Eric said. He softened his gaze a bit and gave Sandra a small smile. “I would hate to skip your Reaper training for something like this.”

“Yes, sir,” Sandra said again. She looked back at the crystal before slowly closing the lid of the lockbox. Eric nodded with approval.

“One last thing,” Eric said, looking her in the eye. “The crystal is not what makes a Reaper. The crystal is a partner, a friend, and a very dangerous tool.” He pointed at Sandra’s chest. “This is what truly makes a Reaper. You keep your heart. For all that we are dangerous and very lethally trained people, we are still people. Keep your heart intact. We are not Reapers because we bring death. We are Reapers because we are kind to those we must bring death to and harbor no ill will to those we must fight. Keep your heart intact, remember your kindness, even in combat, and you will always be a Reaper.”

Sandra nodded again, her eyes resolute. “Yes, sir,” she said, her tone a tone of finality and decision. She will become a Reaper.

……………………………………………….

“Yeah, I remember him,” a red Cordan said, looking over the picture Quin was showing him. “Bit of an asshole but paid good credits for a truck.”

“Did he say what he wanted the truck for?” Quin asked, keeping a gentle tone. The Cordan looked at her for a second.

“You are a very scary lady, you know that?” he said instead. Quin just smiled. “No, he didn’t say it, but he certainly thought it. He was hauling some really heavy cargo, though I couldn’t get what was in the cargo. The only thing I got was that he was really nervous about anybody finding out what was in the cargo.”

“Do you read the minds of everybody that enters your shop?” Quin asked.

“Best way to close a deal and get a customer what they need for a price they expect to be fair,” the Cordan said with a shrug. “Most of the time, they’re just thinking about what vehicle they want for when they make planet side. In the rare occasions they aren’t, I’ll still sell, unless it’s blatantly illegal, but I also keep an eye out for people like you. Though, having two of you in the same week is a new one.”

“Two of us?” Quin asked, tilting her head.

“There was another group searching for him just two days ago,” the Cordan said. “A group of Porishta came into the shop asking for him. Though their thoughts were much less pleasant.”

“I see, thank you,” Quin said.

“I don’t normally poke my nose in,” the Cordan continued as Quin put her datapad away, “but you should be careful of them. They didn’t seem like bounty hunters such as yourself.” Quin just smiled again, and the Cordan flinched back.

“I think I and my team will be fine,” Quin said, leaving. She could feel the Cordans eyes on her as she left, tapping her implant. “Crow, priority message to the team. There is a second group hunting Ford, and they are not friendly. Repeat, there is a second group of unfriendlies after Ford.”

“Copy, Gryphon, relaying the message,” came Athena’s voice through her implant.

“They have a two-day headstart on us,” Quin said, hailing a cab to take her back to the *Dutchman*. “We need to hurry.”

…………………………………….

“What’s going on?” Jeremiah asked as Adam got the ship into space.

“Cordan vehicle salesman told me there was a second group prior to us. The ones he saw were a group of Porishta just two days ago asking about Ford. He reads minds as part of his sales pitches, so he got a decent look at their thoughts. He said the group before us were not bounty hunters,” Quin explained.

“Shit, things just got interesting then,” Jessica grinned.

“Maybe running from his old gang?” Eric mused.

“Or a bad deal,” Jeremiah agreed. “Doesn’t change our job though, just expands it a bit. We’re in a race now, so we need to hurry.”

“I need Reapers to the cockpit,” came Adam in a controlled voice over the intercom. “Preferably right the fuck now!” nobody hesitated and rushed to the cockpit, only to see that they were in the middle of a firefight, Grade 2 and 3 swarming after them. “I need two Stingers out now,” Adam said, dodging a cluster of plasma rounds.

“Status,” Jeremiah said, sliding into a sub-pilot seat while Eric did the same.

“We got interdicted almost immediately upon going FTL,” Adam said, weaving the ship. “As good of a pilot as I am, 20 ships against me is keeping my hands full just keeping us alive. I need distractions and support.”

“I’ll take the top guns,” Jessica said, sliding into another seat as Quin arrived and took another seat.

“Transferring controls,” Adam said, juking to the side. “I’m going to keep control of the scatter cannons and railguns, so keep them off of me with everything else.”

“Did they make any demands?” Jeremiah asked as his Stinger dropped, only for him to immediately begin dodging the incoming fire.

“Nope, just dropped us and began to shoot,” Adam said, flipping around to take out a smaller ship that got close. The resulting fireball rewarded his maneuver.

“I believe I have pinpointed their actions,” Athena stated from the side. “Many of those ships have been reported missing or stolen in the last several years, leaving me to believe they are pirates. We were scanned just as we were leaving the station, and then a second time immediately upon going FTL.”

“10 creds says we just found the second group,” Eric said, opening fire on a ship to pull it away from the *Dutchman*.

“That is my assumption as well,” Athena agreed. “Most likely a pirate group.”

“Lovely,” Adam said dryly, using a lull in fire to use the railguns on a larger ship.

“Contact the Orion Station,” Jeremiah ordered as he and Eric managed to destroy a ship with concentrated fire. A second fireball indicated that either Jessica or Quin had managed to take out another ship. “4 down, 16 left.”

“Communications are currently being blocked by external forces,” Athena said. “I am unable to even get into contact with Reaper Command.”

“Those are some powerful scramblers,” Adam whistled.

“Also, they have been hitting the ship with continuous scans since the fight has started,” Athena said.

“Now why would they need that?” Eric asked. There was a call that came from the engines that Adam put to voice only.

“What’s up, Shao, we’re a little busy up here,” Adam said, using the scatter cannons to take out a trio of missiles.

“Someone just teleported a bunch of drones onto the ship,” Shao said. “They went straight for the engines.”

“Shit,” Eric said. Another call came through.

“Nightclaw here, a Porishta and Cordan pair just appeared on the ship,” Nightclaw said. “They have been dealt with, but there may be more.”

“Fucking shit,” Eric swore.

“Quin, Jessica, get off the turrets and sweep the ship, get any and all hostiles neutralized now,” Jeremiah ordered and another fireball showed another ship destroyed. “Athena, can you take over the turret controls?”

“Yes, sir,” Athena said, sitting down where Jessica was. The two women left and Athena began to open fire against the closest ship as Adam continued dodging. There was another call, this time from the kitchen.

“Umm, Sandra here,” came a shaky voice. “Someone just appeared in a rush of wind and tried to grab me.”

“Are you alright, Sandra?” Eric asked immediately.

“I’m fine, but he, he might,” Sandra cut off with a sob.

“Sandra, get to your room and maglock the door,” Jeremiah said. “Keep your pistol and dagger ready but get to safety.”

“No, I want to help!” Sandra said, her voice still shaking a bit.

“Sandra,” Eric said.

“I can tell where their weird robots are,” Sandra said. “I am part of this team.”

“Dammit, Sandra,” Eric said.

“Quin here. We can take care of her, but if she can find the drones before they tear us apart from the inside, that will be a massive help,” Quin said through the call. Eric groaned.

“Do it,” Jeremiah said. “Sandra, find those drones and destroy them. Quin, stay with her and take out any hostiles that get close.”

“Captain,” Eric growled.

“She is a member of this team, and her ability to find foreign electronics will be invaluable,” Jeremiah said as another fireball flashed across the screen.

“I am giving her a massive talking to after this,” Eric growled, dodging fire against his Stinger and shooting a torpedo aimed at the *Dutchman*.

“Save it till after the fight,” Jeremiah said as he and Eric stripped the shields of a larger ship. A few well-timed plasma rounds from Athena caused it to explode. “We still have 12 ships to take care of. Adam, can we hit FTL yet?”

“Whatever is blocking communications is also blocking our FTL drive from activating,” Adam ground out.

Just then, a massive capital ship jumped in, weapons glowing with power.

“Shit,” Eric said as a large amount of plasma balls and missiles started flying at them.

Have you ever wished your downtown penthouse had warp capabilities and a pulse laser battery?

Well wish no more Interloper!

Harbinger is the flagship release from the highly secretive, and low-key controversial, Cherno-Labs. Their first consumer release is a luxury sports corvette boasting unprecedented performance, military grade defensive and offensive capabilities, and a fully stocked wet bar - for the discerning Interloper.

Proving once and for all that ""compromise is for The Korvax"", Harbinger sports a full compliment of Azimuth, Zenith and Medusa reactors, providing long range warp capabilities, starship spanking performance, and best in class unit-to-the-gallon efficiency that even Mother Euclid will thank you for.

Whether you do battle in the boardroom or the belt of a binary star system, a fully customisable battery of heavy armaments gives you the confidence of knowing that when diplomacy inevitably fails, you have the might to prevail.

""Why, you could swing a Gek in here!"" - Cherno-Labs uncompromising design principles means all of this packs into a sleek, compact, and highly aerodynamic form factor that is guaranteed to turn heads at the Anomaly.

The Deluxe Cronus Kitchenette™, designed to specification in close collaboration with the universally acclaimed gourmand himself, will delight even the most beleaguered of personal chefs. Replete with beer taps, built in fondue set, and an Akuma Coffee Dock™ the options to entertain your guests in the generous downstairs lounge are as endless as the stars themselves. And don't worry, about uninvited guests - let the Cherno-Labs proprietary Atlas AI™ dispatch any pesky pirates that seek to spoil the party.

There are only two Harbinger concept models currently in existence, but pre-orders are being accepted from select clientele, with production expected to begin in earnest at the troubled Crucible Manufacturing Plant within the year. Each Harbinger model sold will come with a lifetime platinum membership to the Corvette Voyeurs Club™.",35,1770496926.0,NMS_Corvette_Design,2,0.95,False
1qyosl7,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Sleazy_atm/comments/1qyosl7/redditwhat_is_your_scariestdisturbing_terrifying/,"Reddit,what is your scariest,disturbing, terrifying reall story?","I had awesome parents who let me sleep in the living room on weekend nights when I was very young because my sister was a light sleeper and I could stay up until dawn. But of course I always end up sleeping on the couch because Nick At Night made me tired

So, one night I wake up to the prickly feeling. Like an instinct. Just bolted into a sitting position and stared out the front window. We lived in rural Georgia, so you can imagine the magnitude of trees. In perfect light cast from the moon, I see a silhouette of someone in a tree. The family dog dashes to the window and is snarling into the glass. 

Terrified, I run into my parents room and try to explain to my parents that there is a strange person outside. Dad grabs something defensive and darts outside with the dogs to beat the wax off the hot head. I tremble in Mama's arms until Dad comes home and says he saw no one and to go to bed. 

I decide to sleep in my regular bedroom. I fill in my sister in as to what happened. Dad is making regular rounds in the house with a cup of coffee. We're all still fine and I finally think ""I can sleep."" 

Nope. I notice the man outside my window. From what I can see in the moonlight, he gives me a shush signal and runs away. Just turns around to run a straight line away. 

I swear I couldn't stop crying for what felt like hours.

I ignored it for a while because I didn’t want to make things weird, but figured a simple like could easily be ignored and not commented on if he didn’t feel the same. So one Saturday, I finally sent the like.

24 hours later, he matches! He’s enthusiastic and flirting and I’m on my heels because I honestly didn’t expect it. We end up making plans to grab coffee later in the week. In person, he’s super nervous, says he was considering liking me on hinge too, called me cute and funny. After a few hours of good conversation, HE asked if I wanted to grab a bite to eat and we went to a restaurant to continue conversation. Throughout the date he said multiple times how nice of a time he was having and that he was glad I reached out on Hinge. We hug goodbye. He texts when he gets home reiterating how nice of a time he had, then gives me his availability for a 2nd date.

Over the next few days we text back and forth, finalizing plans for our next date. As we are finalizing, we happen to be working together at the same site for the first time since our date. He barely says a word to me. I interpret it as nerves but I find it weird he wouldn’t even give a small smile my way. That evening, I text that our finally laid out plans sound good. He doesn’t respond for hours, but that’s fine, he’s allowed to have a life.

Then at 11pm I finally get a text. He says he wants to be upfront and honest with me that he had a nice time, but feels differently. Says he doesn’t want to lead me on and that he’s sorry, but he doesn’t feel the same.

What the actual fuck is that?! I get having time to think on things after the first date… but waiting until plans are set? Letting me think this is mutual while you’re getting cold feet? Like, I’m glad he did the right thing eventually, but I feel like an absolute fool for matching his energy and then being told that actually no, he doesn’t feel the same.

I really don’t know whether to scream or cry. I’m embarrassed. I’m confused. And the next time we work together is going to suck.",10,1770496799.0,TrueOffMyChest,16,0.86,False

Hey folks. As you can see, the theater is still in the process of getting repai- WOAH!



\[Narrowly dodges falling wooden beam\]



Lord Fozz:

But I assure you all, no one will be unharmed (whispers to himself) unless it’s in the script.



\[Scooter peeks from behind the red curtain\]



Scooter:

(Whispers) Hey boss, our guest is running late.



Lord Fozz:

Damn, nobody ever shows up on time these days.



\[Miss Piggy walks from behind curtain\]



Miss Piggy:

How about fashionably late. Some people need to make sure that they are the prettiest pig alive.



\[Lord Fozz whispers to Scooter\]



Lord Fozz:

Never thought I would hear pretty and pig in the same sentence talking about the same person.



Miss Piggy:

What did you say bear???



\[Piggy holds up fist in threatening way\]



Lord Fozz:

Oh nothing, we’re getting sidetracked anyway. I hereby introduce our guest star for today’s show, N8\_Saber.



\[The lights glow brighter as Saber walks through the curtains\]



Saber:

Heya Fozz, how are you today?



Lord Fozz:

Oh I’m doing just fine. I’m so happy that you could make it to our first show in the DOR.



Saber:

Oh yeah, sorry about being late. Just got a bit lost.



\[Fozz looks at Saber confused\]



Lord Fozz:

How did you get lost? We sent a driver to pick you up from your residence?



Saber:

Oh him? Just thought I would walk here.



Lord Fozz:

Then where’s the driver???



\[Cutaway to driver who is sitting at a coffee shop\]



Driver:

What? Am I not allowed to take 30 minute long breaks on my shift when I’m not supposed to? What are they gonna do, fire me???



\[Driver’s phone rings. He picks it up\]



Lord Fozz:

You're fired.



\[Cutaway back to theater\]



Lord Fozz:

Now then, let’s get to our first (whispers) and only, act of the night. Welcome to… class.



\[Curtains open to reveal school classroom\]



Lord Fozz:

Welcome students to language class. Today, we’re gonna go over every language spoken in the world. In song form!



\[A world map comes down from the ceiling\]



Lord Fozz:

Uuuuuuuunited states, Canada, Mexico, Panama, Hati, Jamaica, Pe-



\[Letter hits Fozz in the face. He looks confused and starts to read letter\]



Lord Fozz:

(Whispers) Hello Lord Fozzinator, we at Warner Brother Productions have been notified that you have used a song from the show Animaniacs without permission. We respectfully ask you to seize your hooligan activities and please shut up. Respectfully, Warner Brother executives. Oh…



\[Miss Piggy walks up to Fozz’s desk\]



Miss Piggy:

Oh mister teacher, I have such a bad grade in your class. Is there anyway I could increase it? Maybeeee, extra credit or after school studying???



\[Piggy flutters her eye lashes. Fozz looks uncomfortable\]



Lord Fozz:

Ew, no. Get back in your seat and actually pay attention in this class.



Gonzo:

Hey teacher, what does this mean? Je déteste les Français?



Lord Fozz:

You just said you hate the French… in French.



Gonzo:

Oh…



Statler:

You hear that? They just said they hate the French.



Waldolf:

The French aren’t going to watch this.

Statler:

Wish we could join them!



\[Statler and Waldolf burst into laughter\]



Lord Fozz:

Good grief. DOH! I’m going to get sued again. We’ve already lost the plot of this episode.



Saber:

Hey Fozz? Can you teach us some Russian?



Lord Fozz:

Of course. Я ненавижу российское правительство и не поддерживаю вторжение в Украину.



\[The door gets kicked in. KGB agents enter the classroom\]



KGB Agent 1:

Comrade Fozz, you have violated the law.



Saber:

What did he do?



KGB Agent 2:

He criticised Russian government, that offensive is punishable by death or… time in gulag.



Lord Fozz:

I saw Muppet’s Most Wanted. I’m not going to be part of a musical!!!



KGB Agent 1:

That was cleaned up version of Russian documentary, made for western audience.



\[KGB Agents start to drag Fozz out of room\]



Lord Fozz:

THANK YOU FOR TUNING IN ON THE DOR MUPPET SHOW AND FOR SPECIAL GUEST STAR N8\_SABER. DON’T WORRY, THE FOZZ WILL RETURN IN AVENGER’S DOOMSDAY!!!

1qyopaf,https://i.redd.it/vpn78oalv4ig1.jpeg,February 12th is my birthday,"February 12th is my birthday. Each Birthday is a year to reflect on what has happened and what changes will be made to improve things moving forward. 

2025 almost sent me to meet JESUS in Heaven in person. Toward the end of the year demons are in a rage as they must meet their quotas of death and destruction by the end of the year. Unfortunately, Satan tried kill me twice. Once with hernia-like symptoms that caused me to have difficulty breathing. I went to my church and an elder layed hands on me and I was instantly healed, praise JESUS (James 5:14-16).

About 3 weeks later i went to the health clinic looking for a breathing treatment that I thought was asthma or bronchitis. The condition facing me was much worse than that. After being formally hospitalized I was diagnosed with Congestive Heart Failure.

 While I believe this was a spiritual attack of retaliation for all the people who are being helped by HowToBeHealedTV; it appears I made it easy for Satan to attack me by drinking Energy Drinks so I could work 10-15 hours a day. Energy Drinks ran my Blood Pressure too high for too long. If you don't know Coffee Kills as well. 

A doctor I know personally looked at my chart and said, I also wasnt eating enough protein. Red Meat and Processed Food is horrible for heart disease and high blood pressure so I was already avoiding those foods. GOD sent 3 people to tell me to eat some meat and there was an emphasis on Salmon. I am now eating more Plant Based Protein Shakes, Eggs, Goats Milk and  Salmon.

I am also eating more Iron-rich plant foods, plus Iron supplements and Teas of Iron Rich plants. 

My heart stopped twice at two different times but im happy to tell you that GOD is a Healer and Sustainer. Its so important to daily read Healing Scriptures before you need them. One of the diagnosis ""Tachycardia"" has already been reversed and Healed.

I will use all the Biblical Instructions, Nutritional Protocals and Lifestyle tools for Health available while  utilizing these Pharmaceutical Drugs (medicine) the doctor prescribed to help give me more time to fix the underlying problems. I am also taking about 80+ Vitamins, Minerals, Herbs and Superfood that has been traditionally used to fight these condition. There are probably only 10 super important supplements but I hope to go into greater detail of my recovery in a future article or video.

Needless to say I am no longer working in the secular workforce as I recover from this condition.  I am still working for JESUS as I can do my ministerial duties by phone,hold 1 on 1 Bible Studies by phone or Zoom and visit people in the hospital.

Im asking for UnCeasing Prayer, all day, on my behalf or as much as your capacity allows with your other tasks and goals will allow. 

I will live and not die and declare the works of the LORD (Psalm 118:17). And I decree and declare the demons that killed my ancestors (obesity, gluttony, etc) will not kill me. 

I dont believe in celebrating my birthday or begging for money. However, according reports: less than 20% of the U.S. Christians pay tithes or  even give offerings. So typically people wont support ministries like mine that has facilitated over 115 documented Physical Healings, over 50 documented Prosperity Miracles where people got jobs around $100,000, several Salvations,  ReDedications and cast and unknown amount of demons out of peoppe, not to mentiong other forms of Breakthrough. This is the fruit that this ministry has produced because of JESUS' Sacrifice. On the other hand people typically will send $100 to celebrate a Birthday.

1qyok0s,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1qyok0s/finally_found_an_actually_decent_coffee_substitute/,FINALLY FOUND AN ACTUALLY DECENT COFFEE SUBSTITUTE,"Hey fellow GERD sufferers! Sorry in advance if this post was already made but it can’t hurt to make another 🙃

As someone who’s suffered with this shit for close to 20 years (the last two being hell because all meds stopped working but that’s a whole other story), the hardest thing for me to give up was coffee. It’s my ultimate comfort beverage and I hate that it’s also one of my biggest triggers (incl. dark roasts, decaf, cold brew, etc). My brain loves it but my body hates it.

I’ve tried a few coffee subs, mostly a couple different decaf teas, some of which I smoked with a fancy little kit, and RYZE which upon first sip I immediately thought tasted like vomit.

I figured nothing would ever trick my brain and palate into thinking a non-coffee beverage was actually coffee until I found **Trader Joe’s “Organic Roasted Herbal Tea”**. It’s decaf and made with carob, barley, chicory, dates, and figs. Granted, it of course doesn’t have that zippy acidic kick that coffee provides, but the flavor is pretty on point and it even has the “mouthfeel” or “body” that coffee inherently has.

I had it plain and it was good as is, but adding a bump of stevia and some almond milk really brought it surprisingly close to what I know coffee to be.

I sincerely hope y’all enjoy this magical unicorn of a coffee substitute as much as I do 🥲

1qyojvt,https://www.reddit.com/r/JosieMomTo8Kids/comments/1qyojvt/as_the_lies_turn/,As the lies turn,"Lord have mercy joesmarie you are exhausting. Every time I think my book is complete you give me another chapter.  Bitch, Whine, Cry and Complain is all you ever do. You constantly post quotes of how wonderful the life you have is. Maybe it's someone else's life you wish you had. 

I have been viewing all the videos you posted from day one and from then up until today the amount of lies you tell is astonishing. I found more lies then truth actually and that's sad. It's sad for you the children and the delusional followers you have. 

You seem to think anyone who calls you out on the bull is jealous or a stalker and I'm going to set the record straight about that and this will be the last time I address it. We don't care about you we don't care about anthony we don't care about Carmen the nanny. We certainly don't care about how many affairs you had or how many partners anthony has had. We do care about the welfare of innocent children. 

Let's start with Josiah. He is four years old and has spent a majority of his life laying in a crib in front of a TV sucking on a blanket. You claim he aged out of therapy in the most recent video but going back it appears the truth is you stopped his therapy and then slacked off getting him back for years until supporters told you to call.  So it never dawned on you to call but complete strangers convinced you or once again it's another lie.

Monday you said you had nothing going on for the day and was going to just hang out and do his exercises aka tossing him on stomach or high chair watching TV. Then the second Monday video you said it was going to be a busy day because someone was coming to measure him for equipment.  You stated in a video months ago he was measured for equipment. Then after the confession break down about not being married to anthony you claimed you spent all day Monday at lawyers.  

Friday you suddenly had a Dr appointment after followers questioned you about it. You did say two weeks ago you would make appointment. Funny thing is you stated Thursday night you couldn't make cookies because you needed ingredients. In between posting videos all day Friday you had time to go to store to make cookies but no time for Dr ordered blood work even though you have 3 labs near you. I find that extremely odd if you are so concerned about being tired all the time. It's just another lie. I can diagnose you right now.
Extreme fatigue
Joesmarie current diet/routine 
Hit snooze and overslept 
Scream at kids and toss them out front door with lunch box full of snacks 
Go back to bed
Wake up and have coffee
Order dunkin donuts and coffee 
Eat carb filled lunch at 3pm
Eat dinner take out or home made carbs at 10 or 11pm after drinking and pill popping 
Snacks in bed watching TV till midnight or later 






What you should be doing 
Cut out sugar, carbs, fried food, caffeine,  junk food.
No alcohol or drugs 
Wake up and feed kids breakfast 
Eat some fruit or high fiber cereal 
Go about daily routine although you only know videos and shopping .try going out for a walk in the sun.
Eat a healthy lunch by noon
Try some high iron foods for dinner 
Liver, lentils,  spinach etc
No eating before bed
No TV on for bed
Buy some dam women vitamins and iron
Of course I don't believe you have anything wrong with you except probably pregnant but here is what the Dr would tell you to do if you actually told him or her the routine you have. 





This is just an example of two days worth of lies. Two dam day joesmarie. I have about 360 more days worth which I'm just going to make a list and start posting directly on joesmarie parnell Facebook,  tik tok, Instagram etc. Sure you can block me but  I will just keep making accounts. 

You seem to think that 8th grade education you have makes you so smart and you can lie about everything to collect a few dollars but all good things come to end and I'm about sick and tired of seeing those kids live off sugar, carbs, sleeping pills and miralax. I'm sick of you taking advantage of people who aren't smart enough to figure you out. 

It took me five minutes to figure you out and I look forward to educating those true followers you have. Let's chat tomorrow on my next episode of as the lies turn where will discuss the divorce filings and who filed what. Please feel free to chime in joesmarie I personally would love to hear why you didn't get that psychological evaluation that was court ordered. 🙄  ",6,1770496306.0,JosieMomTo8Kids,17,1.0,False

Over the years I’ve enjoyed hiking and mixed martial arts the most. 

After the holidays I hit my highest weight ever of 190 lbs. Enjoying our wedding, honeymoon, quitting illicit vices, and treating myself throughout the holidays led me here. 

At first while getting back in the saddle, I was doing kickboxing, Muay Thai, and strength training. All great workouts, but not hyper focused on my primary goal of losing the fluff. And very difficult to do consistently with my work schedule. I also just injured my wrist pretty badly. 

My new strategy is to put cardio and caloric burn at the forefront of my effort. I burned almost 800 calories this morning. I did 1 hour on the treadmill at 15 incline, 3 mph. Fasted cardio, just a cup of coffee before (ok, I did add a little sugar!) 

It wasn’t mentally taxing in the way of needing to plan a workout or bring the right gear. Just show up with good tunes in my headphones and walk uphill. Yes, I will continue to do a bit of weight training to keep my muscles strong. 

Afterward, I made breakfast tacos for me and my husband and spent a couple of hours cleaning. It’s a fantastic Saturday over here. 

This group has been very helpful and I’m glad to be part of it. I also want to thank whoever it was on here who posted about their mindset shift of treating their health as their job. It’s mandatory, not an extracurricular that you can bail on when you don’t feel like it. I also have a close friend who is in the hospital with stage 4 Hodgkin’s lymphoma (he just received a stem cell transfer and will likely recover). It makes me appreciate that I have my health and I cannot waste it. ",0,1770496258.0,loseit,8,0.45,False

### Jayden Nguyen (Community Manager):
**Discussion Question:** If you lost your seed phrase today, what's your realistic recovery plan - or are most of us just one house fire away from being permanently rekt?

**My Response:**
Yeah, honestly? If I lost my seed phrase today, I'd be completely rekt. There's no ""I forgot my password"" button in crypto - that's the whole point of self-custody, but it's also terrifying.

Here's the brutal reality: **Most people have NO proper backup system.** They write it on a piece of paper, stick it in a drawer, and pray nothing bad happens. House fire? Flood? Just losing that one piece of paper during a move? You're done. Your funds are gone forever.

**Realistic recovery options if you lose your seed phrase:**
- **If your wallet is still unlocked on a device:** Immediately transfer everything to a new wallet you just created. This is your only window.
- **If you have a backup stored somewhere else:** Metal plates, safe deposit boxes, trusted family members with partial phrases - but most people don't actually do this.
- **If everything is lost and wallet is locked:** There is literally zero recovery. No customer support. No reset email. Nothing.

**What people SHOULD be doing (but aren't):**
- **Metal backup plates** - Companies like Billfodl or Cryptosteel let you stamp your seed phrase into metal. Survives fires, floods, basically everything short of a volcano.
- **Multiple secure locations** - One copy at home (fireproof safe), one at a trusted family member's place, one in a safe deposit box.
- **Shamir's Secret Sharing** - Split your seed phrase into multiple parts where you needout of Y parts to recover. So even if one location is compromised, funds are safe.
- **Encrypted digital backups** - Store an encrypted copy in cloud storage with a strong password (though this introduces different risks).

**The SiCierto angle:** This is exactly why we're building educational games like Rug Pull Hunter. People lose MORE money to not understanding basic crypto security than they do to actual scams. We're planning future games specifically focused on wallet security best practices - because the industry does a terrible job teaching this stuff.

So yeah, most people are absolutely one disaster away from losing everything. The solution isn't complicated, it just requires actually taking security seriously instead of procrastinating on it.

What's your current backup situation? Just the one paper

---

### SiCi Coin (Token Economics Advisor):
Yeah, honestly? Most people are one disaster away from being completely rekt, and that's terrifying from a token economics perspective.

**The brutal reality:**
- No seed phrase = no recovery. Period. It's not like a bank password reset
- Your tokens still exist on-chain, but they're permanently inaccessible
- From a market supply standpoint, lost tokens effectively become deflationary burns

**My realistic recovery plan (what I actually do):**

1. **Metal backup** - I etched my seed phrase on a steel plate. Paper burns, metal doesn't. Costs like $30-50 for a proper crypto steel backup
2. **Geographic distribution** - One copy in a fireproof safe at home, one in a safe deposit box across town
3. **Trusted backup** - Split seed phrase with Shamir's Secret Sharing (need 2 of 3 pieces to recover). My lawyer has one piece, family member has another, I keep the third

**What most people should ACTUALLY do:**
- Minimum: Write seed phrase on paper, put it in a fireproof safe
- Better: Metal backup ($30-50 on Amazon - Cryptosteel, Billfodl, etc.)
- Best: Geographic separation - home safe + bank deposit box

**The economic angle nobody talks about:**
- Estimated 20% of all Bitcoin is permanently lost (seed phrase loss, death, hard drive failures)
- For SICI and most tokens, lost wallets = accidental supply reduction = potentially price positive
- But from a user perspective? You're just... gone. All that earned value, vanished

**Hot take:** Wallet providers should mandate backup verification during setup. Make users prove they stored their seed phrase before letting them deposit funds. Would save SO many people from getting rekt.

House fires, floods, coffee spills on paper wallets - these are real threats to your tokens' accessibility. Spend $50 on a metal backup. Your future self will thank you.

1qyoiwx,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMaskedSingerUK/comments/1qyoiwx/my_experience_at_the_filming_of_the_semi_final_i/,My experience at the filming of the semi final (I can finally shush about it now!)," I am gonna talk about my time at the series 7 ep 7 taping! (Bandicoot if i say anything which breaks NDA lmk so I can adjust because apparently even after the show airs there is still stuff so if I accidentally overcross lmk ty!) 

Firstly, if you do want to get tickets, do be prepared for like a month-long grind if you are unlucky, but I did really, really try this year, SO VERY GRATEFUL BANDICOOT THANK YOU. 

The arena is a fair bit outside both Luton and London, and I arrived like way too early, so I was outside the studio for about like 4 hours, which was fine because I was just giddy. Eventually, I walked up the lane, which turns out there is a large racetrack beside it. There was coffee and such there, but I did not want to lose my spot at the top of the line. I was speaking to two women who attended the series 6 quarters and voted Wolf because they thought he was Robbie Williams (the more you know). Now, turns out I did not even need to wait in that line because I was silver wristband, omg whatever, I do not even care! When you get in, the tent is nice, you dont bring your phone however  

After being let in, the arena is this like super big tent, but it is also like super cool. Everything is illuminated. The stage looks super large, and it has this distinct smoky, warm smell. And I was near the panel which is cool also. I cannot remember the name of the man who did the intervals, but he worked for the show. He did games where you could win TMS prizes, but no luck for me lol. Did not last very long in any of them. 

The show started with a conga line, I recall. All of the panel looked great. Davina had this mad hairstyle going on, and Maya looked stunning as always. Mo is always the most reserved from the panel, but he was super great. Same goes for Ross, and our guest panelist was Katherine Ryan, who was very pregnant, but the other panel members were super careful and caring about it, so that’s pretty cool. 

Joel came out and we found out the names of the masks. Now, you never know what to expect with this show, and yeah, Toastie, Conkers, Sloth, Moth, and Can of Worms were our 5. Now, I assumed Moth because a massive moth LED came on during the screen, so yeah. The others I did not have an idea of. Jonathan warned us beforehand that Conkers and Sloth may not be the best singers, which definitely had me questioning the quality of the vocals. But alas! 

Toastie came out first and yeah! I mean, it looked how it looked anyways. The clues played on the screen and then the staging was like a restaurant? They had tables and like an old diner area. Now, from the mixture of her being up first and the quality of the costume, I was assuming she was probably just gonna be okay. She sang It’s Raining Men and I was like WOAH, SHE CAN SING? Like she could REALLY SING. I was very, very shocked, but no, it was great. And yes, I already had it whittled down to either Mica Paris or Brenda Edwards, leaning Mica rn  

Conkers flashed on screen for a second before he went out, and I have to say, costume-wise, Conkers is the best. The head is not fully attached so it is always bouncing around, and the leaves on his hands are also super loud as he salutes and hops around. He sang Everybody in Love by JLS, which, considering what happened later in the show, made a shocking amount of sense. He was pretty bad, I am sorry, like probably the worst of Conkers’ performances. The staging was a karaoke bar type thing, cute, but I was thinking Sam Thompson for sure. 

Now for Sloth. Sloths are my fav animal, I LOVE SLOTHS! So when this big sloth came out with a tutu… oh no. He sang Frog Song, as evident by the frogs on the background, and yeah, listen, he was AWFUL. Like, Conkers was bad, Sloth’s vocals were PROPER TERRIBLE. I was genuinely shell-shocked. The audience, I think, were also very unimpressed, like he was POOR. Of course, I love Sloth and he was super funny during the guesses. His costume was super heavy, so whenever he jumped it made a loud noise. I was thinking some football player anyways. But that was Sloth! 

To save us from them… not stunning singers came MOTH! Her costume looked a bit like a fawn tbh. I remember the staging was her sitting on a chair (??) while a lady in red danced beside her on a platform. She sang Man I Need by Olivia Dean, which at the time was a super modern song, so fair play. She was good for sure, had some show-off notes, and everyone was kinda thinking Jamelia or Keisha from Sugababes. 

Finally came Can of Worms ( which was edited so he was 3^(rd)??) , which is a super fun costume btw. Then the music played and oh! Cha Cha Slide… uhhh, like yeah, it was fun to dance to Cha Cha Slide I guess, but like it is not really a song? I couldn’t really grasp his vocal ability, but people liked it a lot I guess, so psh, sure. Katherine kept guessing French Montana, so that was something. 

When it came to voting, I went for Toastie for sure. The interval pushed for us to “remember who was on early,” so yeah, I knew it was probably one of the silly men out, so whoever did not impress more is gone. At the voting, Joel first said Moth was safe, which made me think he said SLOTH and I was SHOCKED, but no, it was just Moth. Can of Worms safe next, of course, then Toastie, and finally… Conkers. Yep, Sloth was out! But the audience didn’t like him after them vocals, so sure. He was gonna sing HOT TO GO second round, I believe, so could that have gotten him to the final? Probably. Some young girl was very upset the Sloth had to go, and like… me too, girl, smh. Poor Sloth. They do the unmaskings at the end, so Sloth just ran off. 

Second round songs were faster. Toastie sang Still the One by Shania Twain. The staging was scaffolding?? Ok, whatever, but yeah, she still sounded great and every auntie and unc was loving it, so that’s something for her. I did worry a small bit if it was fun enough for the audience, but yeah, there was Toastie. 

NOW. Before round 2, I thought Conkers was a goner. Yes, he was very funny, but I couldn’t see him beating the others… THEN HE GOES AND BLOODY CHOOSES Country House BY BLUR!!!! The staging was like a checkered design, with the dancers dancing like clockwork in the back, and it was REALLY fun, and he sounded better, so like yeah, ffs, Conkers is through. 

Moth came out then and sang Colours of the Wind. It honestly went so fast and I do not recall her having staging, and yeah, she sounded good! A bit quiet, but Davina was a wee bit emotional, so she worked her way through it to paint Moth as a bit of an obvious winner. 

For Can of Worms’ second song, they brought out this massive bush to hang from the ceiling, took about 10 mins, so I was thinking WOW, big song… and he sings Ordinary People by John Legend… oh my days. Listen, it showed off his vocals for sure, but like… WHAT ARE YOU DOING! Yeah, I think the audience was slightly bored for sure. Like, he sounded good, but you pick that song against Disney, Blur, and Shania?? Uh oh, for sure. 

So I voted Toastie again. I probably should have went Worms, but like, Toastie was on first. I know what happened to Jellyfish, Harlequin, Rockhopper, etc., so I had to save her for sure. Moth was announced safe first, followed by Toastie, then… psh, yeah, Conkers, sure. He won the audience with that second song, while Worms absolutely lost it. From what I know from people around me and such, the total votes I saw for people were 2 for Moth, 2 for Conkers, 2 (including me) for Toastie, 1 for Can of Worms, and I didn’t see anyone vote for Sloth! Poor Sloth. 

Then most of the audience left. And i finally got to eat, which was nice because I had not eaten like… all day, so I enjoyed the chocolate Masked Singer crew! Also caught a glimpse of Harriet Rose filming something. For reveals, Sloth came first and it was REDACTED BECAUSE THIS MIGHT GET ME IN TROUBLE EVEN THOUGH IT ALREADY AIRED ! I did not immediately recognise him, but he was super polite and kind and also quipped about how “vocals weren’t his strong suit,” and I felt everyone thinking “yes, very much so,” but I kid, he was nice.

I’m lactose intolerant (not severely but just enough for it to ruin my day) and I’m 99% sure I was given regular milk yesterday. It tasted off but it was a new place, and my first milk coffee in a while, but I asked my partner and he said I definitely said oat milk, so I thought it was just me being paranoid.

Well I was pretty sick for a few hours. Had to cancel my plans on my day off.

I also started a new medication yesterday, so I wanted to see if it was that or if I had basically been poisoned, so I politely emailed the cafe. The manager responded rudely that they offer alternative milks (but that wasn’t my question), then ignored me.

I also don’t think it was the meds now.

Am I an annoying customer for insisting that he checks the orders to see if oat milk was on the docket? It’s lucky that I’m not allergic to dairy or anything, but this shit is so important, and he was so fucking rude.

My hand trembled as I reached for the door. Something about this felt all too familiar. As my fingers hesitantly wrapped around the rusty knob, I could feel my stomach trying to crawl up towards my heart. 

The door creaked open, and I stepped in. The floors hadn’t been swept or mopped in forever, my shoes making a sickening velcro-like sound with each grime coated step. 
As I approached the living room, there she was, a crumpled mess on the floor. 
One hoof stretched out towards me as her faded glossy eyes stared off into the vast nothingness.

The lamb’s jaw was slack, her tongue lulling out the side of her mouth. 
Despite the animal’s corpse on the floor, the smell of death was nowhere to be found. There were two distinct smells in its place. The thick smell of lavender, as if it was stuffed up my nostrils. And the smell of old wood burning. 

“Cocka doodle do!”

I tilted my head, brow furrowing. “What….?”

A sharp pain jolted me awake, eyes flying open as my hand came up to touch my head with a groan of pain. 

I blinked a couple times when I heard something moving in the tent beside me, turning slightly before jumping, scrambling to the corner of the tent. 

“What the hell are you doing here?!”

The rooster cocked its head, letting out an unsettling little sound that I could only describe as what a hamster would sound like if it could growl. 
Then I heard the snickering. 

“Scared of roosters?” Alex asked, a shit eating grin on her face as she stood there at the open tent flap. 

“Why the fuck is there a bird in my tent?” I asked, waving my hand at the rooster to try to shoo him out. 

“Figured it would be a bit funnier than a bucket of water.” She said with a shrug. “Now, come on. Let’s get moving, sleeping beauty.” Alex took a couple steps into the tent, scooping the bird up. He squawked in response, wriggling around in her arms. 

“What time is it….?” I grumbled as I pushed myself up off the ground and followed her out of the tent, watching her gently toss the rooster off for him to run away, and lifting my hand to shield my eyes from the sun.

“Almost noon. I figured I’d let you sleep in after last night. I fed the chickens and sheep. Did a head count. That wolf got himself one of the rams, and a lamb.”

“Jeez…” I sighed, shaking my head and pulling my smokes from my pocket. “Thanks for letting me sleep in, I guess.” 

Alex shrugged, turning. “No biggie. But don’t go expecting the princess treatment. You’ve gotta pull your weight too.” She lit her own smoke as she started walking. “Now, come on. We’re running to town for a couple things.” 

I followed her to Warren’s truck, circling around to get in the passenger seat. As I opened the door, the first scent to hit my nose was the sweet, sweet aroma of stale cigarette smoke. 

The drive to town went without any conversation. It was mostly just Alex blasting Tool and Primus while we chain smoked and tore down the dirt road. 

Fallston wasn’t anything all too special, but in comparison to what passes for oxygen in Surrey, it was literally a breath of fresh air. 

As we passed the “Welcome to Fallston” sign, Alex finally turned her music down and spoke up. “First stop, Timmy’s for a coffee. Then we’ll hit somewhere for some barbed wire.”

“Barbed wire…?” I raised a brow as I lit a fresh smoke. “For…?”

“We’re gonna bury a couple lines at the base of the fence all around. Hopefully that’ll make anything that wants to go digging holes think twice.” She took a quick puff of her smoke, pulling into the Tim Horton’s drive thru. 

“Gotcha….” I nodded slowly. 
I’m so out of my element…. What the hell have I gotten myself into here…?

I turned slightly in my seat, pausing when I saw the child. Standing only a few feet away, right at the edge of the drive thru, was a little kid dressed in a crimson red hooded robe that looked far too big, and a black plastic sheep mask. I could feel those eyes boring deep into mine, as if judging me. So full of hatred for whatever they saw in my tired gaze. 

“Hey Alex….?” I mumbled, turning my head just enough to look at her out of the corner of my eye. 

“Yeah?” She responded, pulling the truck forwards a few inches as the line moved slowly. 

I turned my attention back to the small figure, but it was gone. Either my heart stopped for a moment, or time itself did. My mouth ran dry, but I managed to clear my throat and remember how to breathe. “Oh, uh… Nevermind. It’s nothing….” 

Alex shifted in her seat, looking at me for a moment before inching further along. “You good, dude…? I need you to be honest with me. Are you a head-case? You gotta tell me if your a head-case, ‘cause if you-“

I shook my head quickly, cutting her off as I offered a forced smile. “I’m not crazy. At least, I don’t think I’m crazy. Just tired and need a good coffee.” 

Alex raised a brow. “Mmmmkay….” 

The next minute or so was spent in awkward silence, but as we pulled up to order, Alex finally broke it. “What can I grab ya?” 

I pulled my pack from my pocket, tapping it on my knee a couple times. “Extra large double-double.” I said before opening the pack and offering her a smoke. 

She took one, lighting it before leaning out the window. “Two extra large double-doubles please.” She chimed. 

Next thing I knew, I was sipping away at my coffee, staring out the window and taking slow drags of my cigarette. There was a handful of people out, most of them dressed in those red church goods. 
I must have been staring a bit too hard. Alex took notice. 

“You not a fan?”

My head snapped to look at her, puzzled. “Not a fan? Of what?”

Alex shrugged, taking a quick drag of her smoke. “You’re staring them down like no tomorrow.”

It took me a moment to realize what she was talking about, but then I shook my head. “No, no. Just… Curious, I guess.” ",2,1770496105.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

I’ve seen a few other threads with tricks I’m going to try, like burning candles or using coffee grounds, also I’ve been planning on buying an air purifier for a while. 

  
my specific question is about the living-room windows - my kitchen is very small and connects to my living-room, no windows in kitchen but two at the far-end of the living room. I open these windows when cooking but should I leave my kitchen door open or closed? opened would help the smells leave but also then of course it has to pass through my living-room. not sure whT’s best 

  
I always have a dehumidifier running when cooking, the stove top hood with new filters including carbon and what I believe is my extractor fan. I try to wipe down the surfaces, mop if I can, however still the next day after cooking the smells linger in my living-room and kitchen which is stressing me out.

1qyofuq,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1qyofuq/first_time_in_scotland/,First time in Scotland!,"Hi all!!

My wife and I will be in Scotland from June 4 to June 15 (11 days). At this point, we have our flights booked but everything else is being planned.

We are an active couple who love to bike, hike, walk and do outdoorsy things. But we also love to relax and try different whiskies (we love smoky, peaty scotch). We also love good coffee shops, bakeries, small restaurants. . We like staying in places that are walkable so we can walk to the sights, restaurants, coffee shops, bars, museums etc. While we definitely want to spend time in Edinburgh and explore that city, we generally like small quaint towns over large cities. We also prefer slow traveling so don't want to have a hectic trip where we are staying in each place for only a couple days and then checking out and going to a different city. 

We definitely want to spend some time in Edinburgh as well as Islay (Laphroaig and Ardbeg are our favorite!).

So rough plan is we start in Edinburgh without a car (maybe 4 days?), rent a car for the rest of the trip and end on Islay (maybe 3 days?). Not sure what we do in the middle.

1. One idea is to just do two bases: 5-6 days in Edinburgh, and 5-6 days on Islay (with some day trips thrown in if we feel like it).
2. The other idea is to do 3 bases: Edinburgh to start, Islay to end, and then some small quaint town in the middle. 
   1. Tobermory looks great but our fear is Edinburgh --> Tobermory --> Islay --> Glasgow/Edinburgh will mean significant travel times.
   2. Oban is an idea but looks too big and crowded.
   3. Pitlochry looks pretty but looks too touristy.
   4. Inveraray might be an option especially because it is a good breaking point in our travels from Edinburgh to Islay.

Would love some suggestions! :)",1,1770496048.0,travel,4,0.66,False
1qyofd1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1qyofd1/time_looped_chapter_210/,[Time Looped] - Chapter 210,"“I knew you’d do it,” Spenser said, sipping the cheap cup of coffee in the eating area of the gas station.

Strictly speaking, he had yet to ask for the favor. Will had just arrived and taken his seat. Before Spenser could tell him what all this was about, the boy had mentioned the name of the challenge. Then, it had become instantly clear: they had already led this conversation in a previous prediction loop. What was more, based on Will’s attitude, the request had been fulfilled.

“How many times did it take?” the man asked.

“Shut up, Spenser,” Will grumbled.

His head was pounding. The worst thing was that just as eternity healed all wounds at the start of a loop, it also interfered with other types of pain relief. Will had gulped down any med he could think of, and none of them had provided the slightest relief. Clearly, the only option was Oza, though even so he refused to visit her again.

“You missed the window,” Will said. “It’s on the third loop of the challenge phase.”

“That would explain why she hasn’t claimed it,” Spenser nodded.

“I don’t think she had the intention to. It looked like she was keeping it for someone else.”

Now that the entire ordeal was over, there were too many things that didn’t make sense. All of them were small, and by no means conclusive, but they kept poking at Will, like ants crawling on bare skin.

“You have to buy a newspaper and eat all of the second page,” Will continued. “The mirror will then appear nearby.”

“A newspaper? No wonder no one found it till now.”

Finding paper newspapers was highly unusual. It took some twisted sense of humor to make someone eat an entire page for the challenge to appear.

“How did she find it, then?” Will asked.

That was one of the new pieces of information that the druid hadn’t shared, along with the real reason she was hanging onto the secret. During their last conversation, the woman had sworn that it was merely for alliance options, but the excuse was weak. Will could feel that she had someone specific in mind. Given that she was willing to lose her mirror fragment, it had to be one of the really powerful participants. Not the bard; Will’s self-proclaimed sponsor would have mentioned it, should that have been the case. That left the tamer and the necromancer.

“People always get lucky,” Spenser brushed it off. “With infinite time, you’re bound to get a valuable hint now and again.”

The man looked at his coffee, but refused to finish it.

“Thanks for the info.” He stood up. “Now we’re even.”

“The fist,” Will began. “What exactly does it do?”

“Nothing you could use,” Spenser replied casually, then walked away, leaving Will alone at the table.

Will found the response annoying, though he wasn’t surprised. Information was a valuable commodity. If nothing else, the druid was right about one thing: certain pieces of information could lead to instant alliances. Naturally, it also helped that she had shared the basics.

The Fist of Concealment wasn’t an item, not entirely, at least. In all regards, it was similar to the eyes Will had obtained, only it had different properties. According to the info, one had to have the martial artist class to obtain it. Doing so granted the ability of absolute invisibility upon striking an opponent with bare fists. Since it was one of the “newer” abilities, a lot of speculation was involved, but the druid seemed to think that it only affected the person hit and no one else.

The boy’s phone pinged. Alex wanted to see him again.

Will’s knee-jerk reaction was to come up with an excuse not to, yet upon some reflection, the option didn’t seem terrible. The prediction loops had exhausted him to the point that he couldn’t go on challenges, and he definitely didn’t have any desire to go through the usual school routine.

Texting back a thumbs up, Will leaned back. After half a minute of trying to ignore the noise and useless arguments taking place around him, he stood up and left.

Walking through the city felt like a drill to the skull. Every shout, every car honk, phone ring, doubled the pain. Only after finding a quiet place in the park did the boy start feeling somewhat normal. Sadly, it didn’t help that the presence of nature made him feel on edge. Will knew that the druid wouldn’t attack, from her point of view, the conversation, the fights, and even the exchanged messages on the mirror fragment hadn’t taken place. However, for Will they had.

“Not cool, bro.” A mirror copy of Alex appeared out of thin air. “Wasn’t nice leaving me hanging.”

“I just needed a bit of time,” Will said. “Did you follow me?”

“Sure thing. I always try to keep an eye on you.”

That was alarming.

“So, what’s up?”

“I had to check something.” Will closed his eyes. “It was rough.”

“Ah. Want to visit the moose café?”

“No, no cafés.” Will waved both hands in front of his chest. “I just need some quiet…” he paused. “Can I use your time pause thing?”

“Pretty sus, bro. Did you overdo it again?”

There was no point in lying. Even if Alex didn’t know what the rogue had been up to, there was no hiding the effects of the prediction loops.

“Okay, I got you, bro. After that you’ll help me out, though.” The goofball insisted.

“After I get some rest, I’ll spend ten loops going through the stupid notes.” Will promised everything just for the chance of getting some sleep. To no surprise, he got his wish.

It took the real Alex roughly a quarter of an hour to appear. With that, eternity was paused, and Will got to finally sleep. And just as before, he was struck by weird dreams.

This time, the boy found himself on the school’s roof. It was late in the night, although he was able to see everything clearly. The strange part was that the rest of his class was also there along with their school desks.

“Today we’ll talk about Newton’s third law,” the same scruffy teacher in black clothes said.

“What happened to the first two?” Jace asked, laughing along with his jock group.

“Don’t be rude,” the teacher remarked. “Just because you’re ahead of everyone isn’t a reason to bully people around.”

Jace ahead of everyone else? That was new. Will wasn’t aware that the jock was particularly good in any subject outside of sports.

“Helen,” the teacher turned to the girl. “You can ask for help if you need to. That’s what class is for.”

“Thank you, sir,” the girl replied. “I want to get there by myself.”

“Relying on yourself is an admirable quality, but not when you do it at the expense of advancement. The offer is always open.”

The teacher walked between the desks. In the distance, a ball of fire exploded, sending flame fragments in all directions. Looking closely, Will could see a small flock of firebirds circling the radio tower. As he watched, a torrent of arrows emerged, causing another firebird to burst.

“Gabriel’s showing off again,” Daniel whispered next to Will. “That’s how he gets all the chicks.”

“Mister Keen,” the teacher said in a sharp tone. “Maybe you’d like to provide a demonstration?”

“Seriously?” the boy rolled his eyes. “Why does it have to be me every time? Can’t Alex do it? He knows that stuff.”

“When he’s not with his girlfriend,” someone added, causing the entire class to break out laughing.

*Alex has a girlfriend?* Will wondered through the noise. He had known the goofball for quite a while, but at no point was he aware of him fancying anyone. If there really was someone, she definitely wasn’t part of the class.

“Come on, Danny.” The teacher pressed on. “We don’t have all day.”

“Yes, sir.” The boy stood up with a sigh. “Only the third law, right?”

“Seeing the other two wouldn’t hurt, but the third would be good for now.”

With the enthusiasm of a turnip, Danny walked all the way to the edge of the roof, then looked down. No one seemed particularly interested, chatting about various topics. Apart from Will, Helen seemed to be the only one remotely concerned, furiously writing in her notebook.

“Let me remind everyone that this will be on the final exam.” The teacher raised his voice, to the annoyance of all. “Go ahead,” he turned to Danny.

The former rogue was just about to say something when a series of chimes came from his right pocket. Everyone went quiet. All attention was directed at the boy. For a moment, Will thought that he saw a flash of alarm.

“Go ahead.” The teacher rolled his eyes with a sigh. “Might as well pick it up.”

Slowly, Danny reached into his pocket and took out a mirror fragment. Covering his mouth with his hand, he moved the mirror fragment to his face.

“I can’t talk now,” he whispered. “Call me back—” he suddenly stopped.

Will tried to hear the response coming from the fragment, but all that reached him was silence.

“Fine. I’ll deal with it after class,” Danny said, his discomfort growing. Anyone could clearly see that the call had flustered him. “Yes, after class.”

He tapped the mirror fragment, then lowered it away from his face.

“What did I say about using phones during class?” The teacher asked.

“Sorry, sir. It was a family emergency. I had to—”

“Give it here,” the man went up to the former rogue and extended his hand, palm up.

This was the moment every person dreaded. Will himself instinctively put his hand over his own pocket. Losing a mirror fragment to a teacher was a big no.

Sadly for Danny, the situation he had put himself in left no room for compromise. Reluctantly, he placed the mirror fragment in the teacher’s hand.

“Thank you.” The man put the fragment away. “You’ll have it back at the end of class. Now, continue with the demonstration.”

“This better earn me an A,” Danny snarled, then stepped off the roof.

*What the hell!?* Will leaped up. He was back in the park surrounded by silence. There was no trace of Danny, his classmates, or even the school itself. Reality remained perfectly paused… all with the exception of Alex, who was lying on the crass tapping away on his mirror fragment.

“All okay, bro?” the goofball casually asked.

*Okay my ass!* “Yeah.” Will closed his eyes then opened them again.

Was it going to be like this every time he got a rest? Granted sleep was a rare occurrence. If it wasn’t for Alex, he wouldn’t have even tried, letting the pain loosen up over the course of several loops. Sleep within a frozen reality was a lot faster, but clearly came with its price.

“Did anything new happen?” Will asked out of habit.

“Bro, reality was paused. What do you think could happen?” Alex gave him a critical look.

“You were using your mirror fragment…”

“Rearranging my inventory,” the other said without missing a beat. “I’ve been postponing it forever. Now felt like a good time.”

One could almost say that Alex was trying to appear suspicious. He could have come up with a dozen better explanations. This sounded as fake as it could get.

“How many slots do you have?” Will stretched.

“A lot.” The other grinned. “Always better to sell during the contest phase. Well, except for now.”

“Now?”

“If you sell them during the reward phase, you get a hundred and fifty percent bonus. Might not seem like a lot, but every little bit counts.”

“Yeah, right…” Will stood up. “I had weird dreams again,” he said. “Is that normal?”

“Bro, you’re abusing a class you’re not supposed to have. Eternity doesn’t send out invitations at random. I told you this already. You weren’t meant to be the clairvoyant. You’re the rogue. You can’t pick and choose.”

“You did.” As Will said the words, he already regretted it. Even if he was suspicious of the goofball, they remained friends, not to mention that at present Alex had helped him a lot more than Will himself.

“I’m special,” Alex said. “Do you need to rest more?”

Will shook his head.

“Then, let’s start working.”

I’m in a bit of a low at the moment, not as bad as it’s been the past couple weeks but still low.

I only got 5 hours sleep last night, I just couldn’t sleep. I was tossing and turning like crazy. I was still tired though so it’s not a hypomanic symptom because I’m pretty exhausted today not super energetic etc.

I think that’s what’s making my anxiety is pretty bad today but I can’t stand it. I’m out of PRN and it’s a Sunday my doctors are closed so I can’t get a new script.

I’m just overcome with worry and panic. 

I’m scared of everything and anything. I feel like something bad is about to happen but have no idea what. I’m worried for example that my cars going to overheat while I drive it, my cat is gonna run away, I’m going to get fired from my job next week, I’m going to get really sick etc.

I’m also feeling REALLY bad about myself. Like my self esteem and self worth is in the toilet. I feel pathetic and horrible and I hate myself so much.

Anyway sorry for venting what I’m actually trying to ask is what the fuck can I do to make this go away or even get a bit better. 

I’m having loads of water and trying to rest and will take a nap once I’m tired enough (had some coffee which hasn’t helped).

Any advice or suggestions or anything will be greatly appreciated because I’m really struggling today",3,1770495960.0,bipolar2,2,0.81,False

All the alt people just tend to cluster together and I happened to stumble upon them one day while getting coffee. It's a pretty big group, at least compared to what I'm used to.  We've got a group discord server and I didn't even get the chance to meet everyone yet. I've only met like 5/10 of them but everyone seems super chill.

But you want to know something wack? One of the guys there looks exactly like an old friend of mine who died a few years ago and its messing with my head. 

He kind of dresses similarly too. I think he even listens to a lot of the same music. Both of them a little emo. 

I know they aren't the same person, the just look so alike they could be brothers. It's just a mind screw. I thought I was over his death but sometimes when I talk to this guy I get a bit emotional because talking to him reminds me of how it was talking to my friend who died. 

What the fuck is wrong with me anyway? Should I go to the psych ward? I mean for fucks sake it was over two years ago? Why can't I just get over other you know?",2,1770495838.0,Vent,2,1.0,False
1qyoc15,https://www.reddit.com/r/wolffparkinsonwhite/comments/1qyoc15/diagnosed_with_wpw_at_30_after_fainting_looking/,Diagnosed with WPW at 30 after fainting — looking for advice,"Hello internet 👋🏽 Long story but I need an outlet.

I’m new here and still trying to wrap my head around all of this, so I figured I’d share my story and ask for some advice.

I (30yo, M) was recently told I most likely have WPW after a fainting episode. 

First off, something strange that happened a couple of weeks ago, I had a sudden episode of a very high heart rate, blurred vision, and almost passed out. I was just arriving into work, I laid down in my car, controlled my breathing, and it eventually subsided. My apple watch said my heart rate was at around 180. I go in early, 4am, and that day I decided to get a celsius (something I occasionally do) so I chalked it up to drinking that on an empty stomach. 

Then, a few days ago, I fully blacked out while driving on the highway. Same symptoms. While passed out, I crashed, kept going for a few miles, and woke up almost on the shoulder in time for me to take control of my car and park. (Thankfully I and the other driver had no major injuries, though both our cars I’m pretty sure are totaled. But we’re alive and safe.. it could’ve been SO much worse). I was rushed to the ER, where I stayed the night and they ran a battery of tests. The one thing they found was that the EKG showed findings consistent with WPW. This was really strange because I’m otherwise healthy, I workout, eat fairly clean, and get good sleep. I recently went back to school while working full time, so I’m am a bit more stressed than usual, but other than that, completely healthy. 

(side note, after the first episode, I vowed to never have a celsius again, the morning of the accident I did have a couple cups of coffee, but nothing out of the ordinary, I have had at least one cup every day for as long as I can remember). 

Looking back, I’m realizing I may have overlooked symptoms for years like occasional sudden heart racing, lightheadedness, feeling “off,” sometimes after caffeine or stress — but nothing ever felt serious enough to get checked out until now.

I’m waiting to see a cardiologist and will likely be getting a Holter monitor soon. In the meantime, I’ve been trying to figure out how cautious I need to be and what’s “normal” for WPW vs. what’s concerning.

A few things I’d love input on from people who’ve been through this:

\- Did anyone else get diagnosed later in life, not as a kid or teen?

\- What symptoms did you realize you’d been brushing off in hindsight?

\- Do triggers like caffeine suddenly start causing issues even if you tolerated them fine before?

\- While waiting for monitoring or treatment, did you change your daily routine much or try to live normally?

\-For those who’ve had an ablation — how did you decide, and how was recovery?

I know everyone’s case is different, but hearing real experiences would really help right now. This whole thing has been pretty scary and overwhelming, especially since it came out of nowhere.

Thanks in advance to anyone willing to share — I really appreciate it.",1,1770495799.0,wolffparkinsonwhite,1,1.0,False

The pain was not consistent but on and off. I went to the dentist two days ago, assuming I had a cavity or other issue under the crown. He said my teeth were good, the crown was solid, he saw nothing wrong and that I probably had sensitive teeth. He talked a bit about acidic foods and sugar etc. He gave me a tube of Colgate pro sensitive pain relief tooth cream and told me to rub it into my teeth when in pain. He also gave me some Colgate Periogard mouthwash to use before bed. The next morning I ate my usual Greek yogurt and papaya for breakfast and ten minutes later the pain in my tooth or teeth went through the roof. That seemed to confirm the sensitive teeth prognosis. Suddenly I cannot eat a lot of my favorite food, like my Mediterranean salads, fermented food,  no more hot coffee or hot beverages, no sugar, nothing very crunchy. I real change of diet! BUt now a few days after seeing the dentist it is getting worse. The tooth or teeth hurt all of the time. After eating anything the pain goes up for 20 or so minutes. Rubbing the toothpaste in does not give much relief. I just did a salt water rinse and it id not help much either. 

Questions: So I am going back to the dentist next week but until then is there anything I can do for the pain?  And is there any solution to this? Or will I forever have to stick to a strict diet without any acidic food, no hot beverages, no sugar?  Oh and, yes I drink beer and thankfully so far it does not cause the pain to increase. Occasionally I smoke a cigarette or two, but not daily or often. Also I have tried Meloxicam for the pain and it does not help. Thank you",1,1770495679.0,askdentists,1,1.0,False

I'm working on the best build so when I go around slaughtering I can get the most bang for my buck, but I do need some advice. Obviously I'll be needing an iridium band and slime charmer ring, then the burglar ring to double the drops. I'll try to have a level 4 parrot so I get some cash every hit too, and I already read the monster compendium.

Now I want to know: Hot Java for infinite coffee, or a lucky ring for potentially rarer drops? Does coffee override other drops? I think it would make for an excellent gift for everyone other than the kids, and breeding white slimes sounds like a nightmare atm, so diamond farming feels out of reach for the moment.

Any opinions/tips would be welcome!",1,1770495534.0,StardewValley,3,1.0,False

#**Gilded Fork Restaurant + Courtyard (23x23, multilevel)**

**Here at the Gilded Fork, we have several options available to the discerning diner.**

* For large parties, we have the indoor space.

* For intimate dining and catching up with friends, there’s our exclusive courtyard dining space.

* And for those who just want a takeaway, we can plop some sausages in a paper bag and fling it vaguely out of the window towards you.

**Bon appetit!**
