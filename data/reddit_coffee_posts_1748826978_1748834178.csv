## Key Features analysis

The best pistachio creams distinguish themselves through several key features, impacting their flavor, texture, and overall versatility.

**Pistachio Percentage:** This is arguably the most crucial factor. A higher pistachio percentage generally translates to a more intense and authentic pistachio flavor. Many commercially available products dilute the pistachio flavor with other ingredients, but the best options boast percentages ranging from 50% to 70% or higher.

The most authentic pistachio creams will have a noticeable pistachio flavor without being overly sweet or artificial. A higher percentage usually means a more natural, less processed taste.

**Ingredient Quality:** Beyond the pistachio percentage, scrutinize the ingredient list. Look for products that prioritize natural ingredients such as cane sugar, olive oil, and sea salt. avoid creams laden with artificial flavors, preservatives, or hydrogenated oils. The quality of the ingredients directly impacts the final product's flavor and nutritional profile.

Products containing DOP (Denominazione di Origine protetta – Protected Designation of Origin) pistachios, especially those from Bronte, Sicily, are ofen considered superior due to the unique volcanic soil and climate contributing to their exceptional flavor.

**Texture and Consistency:** A good pistachio cream should have a smooth, spreadable texture. It should not be grainy, oily, or overly thick. The ideal consistency allows for easy use in various applications, from drizzling to spreading. Achieving this balance frequently enough requires careful processing and the right combination of ingredients.

Some prefer a slightly coarser texture which indicates a less processed product. Though, generally, a smoother texture translates to a higher quality eating experience.

**Packaging and Shelf Life:** Proper packaging is essential to maintain the cream's freshness and prevent oxidation. Look for airtight containers, ideally glass jars, which better protect the product from light and air. Also, check the expiration date to ensure a reasonable shelf life, especially if purchasing in bulk.

Some brands may utilize modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) to prolong the shelf life of their pistachio cream while preserving its natural flavor and texture.

## FAQs Section

**What's the difference between ""pistachio cream"" and ""pistachio butter""?**

While the terms are frequently enough used interchangeably,pistachio cream generally refers to a smoother,sweeter product made with pistachios,sugar,and sometimes other ingredients like olive oil or milk powder.

I'm not saying that coffee directly did this but I believe it was a contributing factor. So if you can before your surgery try to wean off of coffee weeks/months prior to your surgery.",1,1748833199.0,Tonsillectomy,1,1.0,False

So I’m non-binary and go by they/he pronouns. I came out to both my mom and my brother. My dad is transphobic and when I came out to my mom she told me not to tell him cuz he wouldn’t like it. Later I told my mom I was gonna tell him and she told me that she already had. He hadn’t mentioned anything to me and my mom had told him TWICE so I felt weird bringing it up. 

Anywho I’ve been going by a name at college (I’m 18 and still live at home.) I didn’t tell anyone in my family because I was just trying out the name and didn’t want them getting in the habit of calling me a different name if I ended up changing it later. Both my mom and my brother found out over time which is fine with me. 

Yesterday mail for college stuff came to our house addressed to my preferred name and my dad saw it. I was in the shower so my mom told him it was a name I went by at school and he got PISSED. I came out of the shower to him slamming doors and stomping around then he got in his car and left. (He goes on drives when he gets mad.) my mom told me what happened and when he got back I went over to officially come out and talk about things. I told him my identity pronouns and that it was a name I was trying out. He asked me how long I’d been at my college (2 years). He told me it was disrespectful and untrusting of me to have kept it from him. I apologized and he told me that somethings can’t be apologized for. I said okay and left. I came back a few minutes later because I was confused why he was so mad about my name and not the whole trans part? So I doubled checked that he knew I was trans, but all he said was “I really don’t want to talk to you right now.” I tried to ask again, but I just got the same response.

So the next day my mom was going to Starbucks and told me to ask my dad if he wanted anything. He wouldn’t respond and I got annoyed so I stood really close behind him while he was grabbing something and repeated myself when he turned around. He tried to step around me but I blocked him. So he put his forearm up against my chest and walked forward which pushed me into the counters and also a coffee pot. He held me there for a few seconds before letting go. Afterwards I stood next to him for maybe 10 minutes repeating “do you want Starbucks” before I gave up.

Apparently when I was at work my mom and dad got into a fight about this whole situation and my dad said that this isn’t something I can apologize for, but I’m an adult and I need to figure out how to make it up to him.

I know this is sorta more about if my dad is overreacting, but also I’m kinda mad that he reacted like that, but idk if I should be? Like I get that it would hurt to find out someone close to you didn’t tell you they’re going by a new name, so should I just figure out how to make it up to him?

Never had I felt so embraced, validated, and accepted until I was found by Heru and the Netjeru. It's been two years now and I've never been so happy and at peace of mind and heart. Since I started this journey, my life has dramatically changed both on the outside and inside.

Yesterday I found the Heru statue of my dreams (the one at the right), bought it immediately and reorganized my whole altar to have the three representations beautifully displayed. He lays at the entrance of my house, always protecting me and my loved ones.

I also made some offerings like chocolate, money, and coffee liqueur.

And I think it's important to always remind ourselves—the Netjeru love and respect us for who we are, and they don't care about who we choose to love, or how we decide to present us to the world. We are all spirits and souls and it's through our good actions, good feelings, and good thoughts that we remain close to them.

After the flight I was groggy AF because I had barely slept, but still didn't want to drink coffee in case it impacted my sleep that night. So I went two days, effectively, without coffee. That's the longest I'd gone in a long time. So at that point I thought, ""Why not just give it up?"" I already had a streak going. I'd done it once before, just to see what would happen. I went a few months that time, if I recall correctly, but didn't remember any great effects because of it.

Well... it's been over a week now, and I am *astounded*. I didn't quit caffeine altogether at first; I still had tea, green tea, and zero sugar carbonated drinks. Today I've started going no caffeine.

I don't remember feeling this at all the first time I quit, but since going low/no caffeine, my mood has been incredibly stable. I'm an anxious person by nature, but I had no idea that caffeine could have been exacerbating my tendency to be anxious this whole time! I no longer feel on edge at different times of the day. I'm tired for sure, and don't feel alert, but I'm *calm*. I haven't had a lot of headaches or other withdrawal symptoms (thankfully) - just some fatigue that I'm more inclined to chalk up to my gym regimen and maybe to not getting great sleep at the moment for various reasons (but not caffeine!). I feel like I've been figuratively kicking myself in the shins for so many years drinking coffee. Maybe it's a placebo effect - I don't know if caffeine actually affects your anxiety levels - but whatever it is, it's *wonderful*. 

I'm excited to see what no caffeine will do for me from here on out. I'm drinking rooibos tea and zero caffeine coke if I want something to drink other than water. It's strange not having a cup of coffee in the morning but I can get used to it. It's worth it for this hitherto unfelt sense of equilibrium I'm experiencing right now. I've always known caffeine was a drug but I never considered that it could have such an impact on your day-to-day life experience. And I wasn't even consuming that much!

A half-dozen stomachaches and one truly tragic smoothie explosion later, I decided to treat this like a science project; testing, tweaking, and tracking every scoop. Here’s the distilled wisdom from my \~18-month powder odyssey.

I started with two goals:

1. **Clean gains:** extra protein to hit 1 g/lb of body weight without gnawing another chicken breast at midnight.
2. **Digestive peace:** no bloating, no mystery breakouts, and definitely no chalk mouth.

I cycled through a dozen tubs, logging macros, taste, mixability, and next-day soreness in a spreadsheet (nerdy, I know). Four powders survived my ruthless culls; each for a different reason.

* Budget-friendly 5-lb tub (\~$1 per serving)

*Cons*

* Contains a touch of artificial sweetener
* Not ideal if you’re strictly lactose-intolerant

*Best for a*nyone who wants dependable, cost-effective whey without fuss.



# 2. [PVL Grass Fed - Premium Isolate 100% Whey Protein Shake](https://amzn.to/4dMiLBy)

My Experience: Switched here when I dialed macros for a cut. Zero stomach issues, crystal-clear ingredient list, and still tasty in coffee (mocha hack!).

*Pros*

* 28 g protein / 120 cal—highest protein-to-calorie ratio I’ve tried
* Sourced from grass-fed, hormone-free cows
* Sweetened with stevia—no sucralose

*Cons*

* Premium price (\~$2+ per serving)
* Limited flavors; Vanilla is solid but basic

*Best for c*lean-label devotees and lactose-sensitive lifters who can splurge.

# 3. [Dymatize ISO100 Hydrolyzed Whey](https://amzn.to/4mGU4KV)

My Experience: My “race-day” powder before heavy compounds. The hydrolyzed whey hits the bloodstream fast, making me feel less fatigue between heavy sets or longer workouts. 

*Pros*

* Instant mixability - no foam, no grit
* 25 g protein / 110 cal; nearly zero carbs & fat
* Hydrolyzed = faster absorption

*Cons*

* Sweetness is intense; not everyone’s jam
* Pricey and the 3-lb tub disappears quickly

*Best for p*erformance-focused athletes chasing rapid absorption pre/post-workout.

# 4. [Naked Pea Protein - Chocolate Peanut Butter](https://amzn.to/4mFR6WY)

My Experience: Went plant-based for a few months; this saved me. Earthy taste (blend with banana), but zero bloating and surprisingly thick shakes. If you have any issues at all with dairy in protein products, this is the one for you - without question. 

*Pros*

* Single-ingredient: yellow pea protein, nothing else
* 27 g protein / 120 cal
* Allergen-friendly (soy- & gluten-free)
* Affordable for a vegan option

*Cons*

* Earthy flavor needs doctoring
* Slightly chalkier texture than whey

*Best for v*egans or anyone fighting dairy intolerance who still wants high protein per scoop.

So I’m non-binary and go by they/he pronouns. I came out to both my mom and my brother. My dad is transphobic and when I came out to my mom she told me not to tell him cuz he wouldn’t like it. Later I told my mom I was gonna tell him and she told me that she already had. He hadn’t mentioned anything to me and my mom had told him TWICE so I felt weird bringing it up. 

Anywho I’ve been going by the name Jace at college (I’m 18 and still live at home.) I didn’t tell anyone in my family because I was just trying out the name and didn’t want them getting in the habit of calling me a different name if I ended up changing it later. Both my mom and my brother found out over time which is fine with me. 

Yesterday mail for college stuff came to our house addressed to Jace and my dad saw it. I was in the shower so my mom told him it was a name I went by and he got PISSED. I came out of the shower to him slamming doors and stomping around then he got in his car and left. (He goes on drives when he gets mad.) my mom told me what happened and when he got back I went over to officially come out and talk about things. I told him my identity pronouns and that Jace was a name I was trying out. He asked me how long I’d been at my college(2 years) because my mom had mentioned that it was a name from school. He told me it was disrespectful full and untrusting of me to have kept it from him. I apologized and he told me that somethings can’t be apologized for. I said okay and left. I came back a few minutes later because I was confused why he was so mad about my name and not the whole trans part? So I doubled checked that he knew I was trans, but all he said was “I really don’t want to talk to you right now.” I tried to ask again, but I just got the same response.

So next day my mom was going to Starbucks and told me to ask my dad if he wanted anything. He wouldn’t respond and I got annoyed so I stood really close behind him while he was grabbing something and repeated myself when he turned around. He tried to step around me but I blocked him. So he put his forearm up against my chest and walked forward which pushed me into the counters and also a coffee pot. He held me there for a few seconds before letting go. Afterwards I stood next to him for maybe 10 minutes repeating “do you want Starbucks” before I gave up.

Apparently when I was at work my mom and dad got into a fight about this whole situation and my dad said that this isn’t something I can apologize for, but I’m an adult and I need to figure out how to make it up to him.

I just wanted to know if I’m in the wrong. I know I was being a dick with the whole Starbucks thing and it’s not like my dad freaked out and tried to hit me or anything like that. Idk I just feel crazy and I honestly do try to be nice to him and now piss him off but I don’t even know how. I feel like it’s fair for me to not tell him that I’m going by a different name, but I could also see how that would hurt his feelings. So yeah, I am I in the wrong? Is my dad overreacting?

1l16xqp,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1l16xqp/the_perfume_you_left/,The Perfume You Left,"The light rain drums on the windowpane, a steady rhythm against the silence of my apartment.

Outside, on the third floor of the building opposite, her window is lit. A warm, intimate light, silhouetted against the translucent curtain. An ephemeral impressionist painting.

She moves, a slow gesture, perhaps fixing her hair. Each movement, a brushstroke of existence that only I, from here, can truly appreciate. Capture. Preserve. I call it the Study in Amber.

Proper nouns are common, they reduce the fluidity of observation. What interests me is the essence, the trace it leaves in the air, in the things it touches, in the digital ether. An invisible perfume, a unique signature that begs for a curator. I am that healer. My gallery is silent, meticulous, kept inside.

Her social media is a public garden, poorly maintained. Flowers of forced smiles, weeds of empty interactions. But among the dry leaves, I find pearls. An old photo where the light reveals a vulnerability that she tries to hide today. A casual comment that betrays a secret fear. Little fragments of truth that she carelessly offers to the world. I collect them, analyze them, catalog them. I know your fears better than your closest friends. I know the out-of-tune melody behind the rehearsed song she presents.

Her rubbish, oh, her rubbish. An archeology of everyday life. A cotton swab with traces of makeup. A crumpled movie ticket – did she go alone? With whom? The brand of coffee she drinks. Details that make up the mosaic. Recently, a pregnancy test. Negative. I felt a mix of relief and... disappointment? A new variable would have made the study more complex. More interesting. I kept the packaging. Label: ""Amber Study - Diverted Potential - Date"".

Burying myself in her space is an almost transcendental necessity. The lock gives way like a whispered invitation. Inside, the air is different. It's her perfume. Not the cheap floral she wears to the world, but the real smell. Warm skin, the specific soap, a trace of anxiety hovering like ozone before the storm.

I go to the room. The unmade bed, an abandoned nest. I open the closet. Clothes hanging, waiting. I touch a silk dress. I imagine the texture against her skin. I close my eyes. I inspire. The residual perfume. It's almost like touching her.

I find her diary. Cover worn. I read a few pages. Trivial confessions, small dreams. But between the lines, I see loneliness, the search for something that not even she can name. I interpret your words in my light. She craves order. By someone who truly understands you. Someone like me. I leave a subtle bookmark, one I used myself, between two sheets of paper. A small seed of doubt planted in her mind. Will she find him? Will she think it was her? Gaslighting is a delicate art form.

Today, she came home with red eyes. Did you cry? Why? Who dared disturb my screen? Anger boiled, cool and controlled. I searched your digital tracks. A silly argument with a friend. Trivial. But her reaction... disproportionate. Fragile. Need more structure. More... guidance.

I decided to intervene. A practical lesson in emotional control. I waited in the dimly lit hallway on her floor. The sound of the elevator arriving. The hesitant steps on the carpet.

“Good evening,” my voice cut through the silence.

Her start was almost like a seizure. The eyes, liquid mirrors of panic. Breath hitched in throat.

""You again..."", the voice trailed off.

""It looked sad today,"" I commented, approaching slowly, like someone admiring a rare piece. ""I don't like to see my... inspiration... disturbed by trivialities.""

She stepped back, her back meeting the cold wall. Cornered. The beauty of primal fear.

""Stay away from me! I'm going to scream!""

""Scream?"", I smiled, leaning in slightly, invading her air space, feeling the heat emanating from her, the smell of fear. ""And who would believe you? Such an... emotional girl. So... unstable. Maybe you need to rest. Maybe you need someone to take the reins.""

My fingers brushed her arm, lightly. The skin crawled. An electric shock. She shivered, closing her eyes tightly.

""Don't touch me... please...""

The whisper was music. The implied surrender. The screen ready for the last stroke. But not today. Art requires patience. The pleasure is in the tension, in the anticipation of the final brushstroke.

I walked away. ""Think about it. About order. About the peace that only true understanding can bring."" I turned my back and walked slowly towards the stairs.

I returned to my observation post. Her window remained dark for a long time. I imagine her inside, cowering, trying to decipher the indecipherable. Trying to erase the perfume that my presence left in the air.

But he doesn't disappear. It permeates. He is. Like my shadow, which now projects itself over every moment of her life.

Beauty is so fragile. It needs to be protected. Preserved. Even if preservation requires breaking the vase to keep just the perfume. The perfume you left. And now it's mine.

TW: Disturbing, manipulative themes

Attachment Theory

Chapter 1: “You’re Fascinating”

The notification chimes like a prayer bell, and there she is again—three dots pulsing in our message thread like a heartbeat I want to stop. From a purely psychological angle, I’m determined to help, to figure out what the issue is.

To dissect you.

You’re fascinating, Abigail, a truly curious mind, one I want to crawl inside and live in, get to know. So, so fascinating. I really do love our little games. You typing, me waiting, breathless, on the edge of my seat. My pulse racing with every dot popping across my screen. I just wish you’d send your message already so we could skip the pleasantries. Something I hate about human beings, the small talk. The pretext. 

I do love the mind games, though.

Her profile says she’s “looking for something real,” but her expressions in these photos are telling me different truths; I can read you like a book, Abigail. It all comes down to basic human motivations. It’s science.

That cute little smile you can tell I’m obsessed with, the way your lips part just enough to suggest a hunger you probably don't even recognize yet… You've been typing for forty-seven seconds now, deleting and retyping, crafting the perfect message to send to me.

I've studied her patterns—she always hesitates long before asking something she doesn’t want to ask or revealing something she thinks is shameful. That hesitation is where I live now. 

And here it is.

“Up for another session?”

You bad girl, what happened in your life now? Did your boyfriend hit you again? Did your friend get on your nerves? What is making you crawl back to me this time? Is it just an excuse? I’ll bet it is.

What do I type? Something professional, something soothing, affirming. Empathetic, even… Okay, maybe I’m laying it on a little too hard. Let’s real it in, dial it back just enough. 

“Sure. What time works best?”

Sent.

I take a bite of my turkey sandwich, chewing loudly as I stare at the screen.

Typing so soon? It must really be urgent.

“As soon as possible!”

She types the full thing instead of ASAP, I’m gonna guess boyfriend. 

Your constant need to be in a state of being used, being abused, you believe you deserve it, and at the same time you know you don’t. Cognitive dissonance. Abigail, you’re brilliant, you have to know by now that relationships are a power struggle! Human existence… is a power struggle. And you’re losing.

“Hour and a half work?”

The ding of my phone is like a melody sent from Heaven, filling me with a delicious pleasure that I can’t shake.

“Sure! Thank you, Dr. Swango.”

I smile.

“I’m only doing my job.”

____

“Okay, mommy needs you to sit down now.”

The memory is sharp, jarring, unwelcome, and her voice is smooth, gentle, but her expression is flat. She sighs every time she speaks.

I don’t like this place.

“But I don’t want to.”

She presses her lips together, scratching the side of her head.

“Sit down. Please.”

Her voice is strained now, and she wipes her hands on her pants. Why is her voice like that? 

“I want to play with my army figure, mommy.”

“Sit the fuck down, Teddy.”

She doesn’t mean that. She can’t mean that, I made her say that because I’m not behaving. Why did I make her say that? She loves me and I’m testing her patience. I should sit down.

“I’m sorry, mommy.”

“It’s okay.”

She takes a long drag of her cigarette, and I sit down, twiddling my thumbs in my lap.

“Ted, why are you twiddling your thumbs?” She asks, writing something down in her notepad.

“I dunno,” I say, shrugging my shoulders. And I mean it, why am I doing that? So I stop.

She analyzes me, specifically my face, her eyes present but also not present at all, and she is sitting up straight, her brown hair up in a neat little bun.

“You’re a fascinating little boy, Ted, do you know that?”

“I know that, mommy.”

____

I set down my coffee, and you knock on the door, opening it slightly.

You look nervous, I can tell by your eyes. Are you scared of being too early? And why are you early, are your problems that bad in just three days?

“Am I too early?”

“Not at all, please, come in.”

You giggle nervously and walk in, closing the door — oh, look, you brought your kitty.

“And hello, beautiful,” I say, petting it. I normally wouldn’t allow it, but for her I just might. 

“I hope it’s okay, I didn’t want to leave her alone, last time I did she peed all over my bed.”

I’ll keep that in mind.

“I’m willing to let you break the rules here, Abigail. Just because she’s so darn cute.”

She moves a strand of hair out of her eyes, blushing.

Eu sou o fundador da Differ Coffee Co. (Instagram: [differ.coffee.co](https://instagram.com/differ.coffee.co)), uma torrefação de café especial. Há um mês, decidimos tentar algo novo: incentivar nossos clientes a nos marcar nos Stories do Instagram usando o [Organic Reach Rewards](https://organicreachrewards.com/). Antes disso, recebíamos apenas duas ou três menções por dia, quase nada para gerar um buzz. Mas, ao lançar nosso programa, essas menções saltaram para cerca de vinte diárias, e as vendas aumentaram. Quero compartilhar exatamente como tudo aconteceu, caso alguém queira aumentar o engajamento orgânico sem gastar uma fortuna.

# Processo

No início, nossas menções diárias eram raras. Uma torrefação local como a nossa depende muito do boca a boca, e quando alguém postava uma foto de latte art ou de um pacote de grãos nos Stories, já era uma alegria. Mas isso não se traduzia em novos clientes ou em um aumento consistente de público. Eu precisava que as menções se tornassem um hábito para quem nos seguia, e não apenas uma gentileza ocasional. O objetivo era simples: fazer com que as pessoas nos marcassem com mais frequência, aumentar o alcance orgânico e deixar que essa visibilidade virasse vendas reais.

Começamos pedindo a qualquer pessoa que curtisse nosso café que marcasse nosso perfil u/differ.coffee.co sempre que postasse um Story. Em troca, ela receberia automaticamente um link para conferir quantos pontos havia acumulado e quais recompensas poderia resgatar. Não havia troca manual de mensagens; assim que o Story era publicado, nossa configuração no Organic Reach Rewards enviava o link instantaneamente. Ao clicar, o cliente era levado a uma página simples de recompensas, onde podia ver seu total de pontos e escolher entre opções como pacotes de grãos, um café grátis ou nossa caneca personalizada. Era fundamental que esse processo não exigisse login ou download de aplicativo—bastava clicar e acompanhar o progresso.

O mais surpreendente foi o custo baixíssimo. Gastamos cerca de cinquenta reais no Organic Reach Rewards durante todo o mês e só pagamos quando alguém atingia a marca de 15–20 menções e optava por trocar os pontos por uma caneca ou um pacote de café. Aqui vem a parte interessante: cada vez que alguém ganhava uma caneca de cerâmica com nosso logo, publicava nos Stories Esse “duplo marketing” receber menções e depois ver nosso logo de novo em um produto foi excelente para o engajamento

# O que Aprendemos

* **UGC gera mais UGC** Quando as pessoas viram amigos ganhando canecas e cafés e depois mostrando essas canecas nos Stories, foi como se criasse uma competição amigável. De repente, marcar nosso perfil deixou de ser um favor e passou a ser motivo de orgulho.
* **Automatização é Fundamental** Antes disso, eu gastava de uma a duas horas por semana lidando manualmente com menções e enviando DMs. Depois de automatizar o processo, esse tempo caiu para zero. Tudo acontecia em tempo real, sem eu precisar fazer nada.
* **Pequeno Investimento, Grande Retorno** Gastamos cerca de cinquenta reais no Organic Reach Rewards no mês, mais aproximadamente duzentos reais para cumprir as trocas de café e canecas. O incremento nas vendas cobriu esses custos cerca de 1,4x, o que, para um negócio do nosso porte, foi enorme.

# 

# Dicas Pro Tip™

* **Escolha uma Recompensa Tangível** Um item físico—como nossa caneca personalizada—amplia o impacto do marketing além do Instagram. As pessoas usam a caneca todo dia e exibem o logo da sua marca.
* **Promova em Todos os Cantos** Colocamos cartõezinhos nas mesas do nosso café com a mensagem “Marque a gente (@differ.coffee.co) para ganhar pontos e conquistar uma caneca!” Também publicamos um Story fixado explicando como a página de recompensas funcionava.
* **Acompanhe Diariamente** Na primeira semana, se as menções não aumentarem; Reforcamos por 2 semanas e agora não precisa de mais manutancão.

# 

Gostaria de saber se outras empresas de pequeno porte em geral, já experimentaram um programa de incentivo a conteúdo gerado pelo usuário (UGC) semelhante. Houve um ponto de virada em que as menções explodiram?

Imagine the most unhinged, stupid, or incapable people you see on social media, in real life, and on TV are driving around town with 2000 + lb objects capable of going very, very fast. They could be having a bad day, spill coffee in their lap, have a heart attack, text, who knows what other distractions, and bam, you or someone you care about could be maimed or killed. We do it around pets, kids, the elderly, and other vulnerable people. Around 4,000 people die every month in traffic crashes, that's like a 9/11 every month. I cannot think of another activity we participate in that is this crazy. And for what, convenience, to drive to work?  

Let’s say there are 160 million workers in the U.S.

About 60% of them—so 96 million people—can work from home at least part-time.

Now imagine those 96 million people each work from home just one extra day per week, saving themselves a round-trip commute of 32 miles.

That’s:

* 1 day/week × 50 work weeks = 50 saved commutes
* 50 × 32 miles = 1,600 miles saved per person per year

Now multiply that by 96 million workers:

* 153.6 billion vehicle miles taken off the road every year.
* The U.S. fatality rate is about 1.35 deaths per 100 million miles driven.
* So by staying home just one extra day per week, we’d prevent roughly 2,074 deaths per year.
* That’s more than 6 lives saved every single day—all because people didn’t have to drive to sit in a cubicle answering Slack messages they could’ve handled in sweatpants.

It’s not just the dead. Here’s who else pays the price when we normalize commuting deaths:

The Drivers Who “Survive”

Imagine being the person who killed someone on the way to work. Even if it wasn’t your fault, you're still living with the trauma of having taken a life. Many develop PTSD, depression, or substance abuse issues. Their lives are often permanently changed.

The Families Left Behind

Kids grow up without a parent. Partners become widows. Parents bury their children. These are ripple effects that go far beyond one bad morning.

However, I did some math and i think it could be extremely profitable considering a fast turnaround time of 5mins (on the espressos) assuming one is able to source all the ingredients locally.

the math works out to this if my calculations are correct  
If i have 30 coffee bushes for a total of 390 beans im able to make around 130 espressos which i can sell for 32,940 coins. the only costs are the bushes which would put me down 11,000 coins leaving me with about 21k profit. Is the time investment worth it overall from your people's opinion? I'm not exactly sure why people always say it's the least profitable machine assuming people buy the ingredients. Though i may be missing some aspect to this disscussion considering i am just now getting back into the game after a long break.

Rooms felt dated compared to the Hyatt Regency a few blocks away (which we also stayed at for a few nights on a different part of the trip). 

Club Review: Don't expect much during the day or in general. A fridge with canned sodas and bottled juices, no bottled water (!!!), a Keurig coffee machine with milk drinks, a disinterested attendant. Snack area during the day was cheeses, charcuterie, crackers, cookies, and dessert. Happy hour was $5 for beer and wine (Canvas-brand).

Club Breakfast Review: This was probably the most disappointing part of the stay. It felt like a Hyatt Place/House breakfast plus a tray of smoked salmon. Cheap eggs and rotating bacon/sausage, either oatmeal/frozen French toast sticks, assortment of diced fruits, sliced breads/bagels. We were underwhelmed especially considering what kind of options were available on the in-room dining menu. 

Health Center: the steam room and sauna adjacent to the gym were a nice added bonus for staying at this property, but that was open to everyone. 

In retrospect, I think the best use of a GOH in Seattle would have been at the Hyatt Regency. I would have traded a worse club/lounge (not sure how it can be more limited that the GH's club though) for more modern rooms and a full restaurant breakfast at the HR's ground floor restaurant.

IMPRESSION: 
1. Left mid to lower thyroid gland solid isoechoic nodule measuring 0.8 cm.

2. TI-RADS 3


I’ve been feeling on and off really shitty for quite awhile now. But I was blaming my symptoms on my long term depression, endometriosis, and medications. Symptoms I’ve been struggling with are:


-Heat intolerance. I damn near passed out at a picnic a couple weeks ago. 


-Tremors in my hands. I was blaming this on my Wellbutrin (even though I’ve been on it for years)


-Diarrhea. Like. So often it’s ridiculous. God forbid I have coffee I will shit ten times in one day. I blamed this on my endo.


-High heart rate and chest pain. I’ve been getting high heart rate notifications nearly every day since November (when I got my watch) and feel like my heart skips a beat often/sometimes feels like it’s going to jump right out of my chest.


-Irritability, anxiety, feeling like I want to peel my skin off. 


-Weight loss. This has happened a couple times prior in the last couple years. I go through phases of having a normal weight/normal appetite, to not being able to keep weight on/having a bad appetite due to nausea and gagging. I have again dropped down from 141lbs to 124lbs in the span of 2.5 months without trying. 


-I never really get sleepy I could stay up all night if I wanted to. I take cannabis RSO oil for my back and endo pain most nights though so that does knock me out. 


-I used to frequent the gym but I have been feeling SO exhausted and weak since the winter.

But also know that I’m not lying outright either. This story is true, even if the details might not be. And remember that I said might. Twice. (in her words, “I speak only the truth one way or another.”)

I’m going to show you one method of crippling me as a person.

Take two aspects of my personality and have them charge at each other head to head at full speed. We’ll say that one represents my core identity as a hot-blooded man with desire and want of companionship; we’ll say that other represents my moral compass and core identity as being a protector and guardian.

At the beginning of November 2024, I was banned from the website. I had an issue with a creator, and I initiated a chargeback, a dispute over a payment. The sum of money was almost paltry, but it was a “principle of the thing” situation. Still, it was more than I would pay at the time to regain admission, and some time away was exactly what I needed to iron out a few recent issues that had come up.

Mira and I had a mostly transactional relationship from the moment I met her until Fall. We would chat briefly around encounters, but we generally avoided getting too in depth or spending too much time talking. That all changed in October. My presence was sparse over the summer, but I popped back up in September, and she and I spoke again. She was pleased to hear from me, as far as I could tell.

I’m not sure when exactly or how exactly it happened, but she and I started to chat well beyond the scope of anything we had done previously. I found myself messaging her while waiting in line at a drive-through. We talked while I shopped for groceries. It was gradual. It was pleasant.

A quick note: at the time this happened, I was living in rural Louisiana. The closest place where any social mixing occurred was a gas station 10 minutes by car from my house. Also, my job put me in the middle of nowhere for extremely long stretches of time. At night. I worked six days on, then got three days off. On my work days, I’d typically wake at 2, leave the house at 5pm, and get to work for 7pm at small boat launches in rural sections of Louisiana. I’d get off at 6am, drive to our company warehouse, and limp home by about 8am. I’d usually collapse in bed by 9:30 or so. Long workdays with long drives and not enough sleep for 6 days in a row.

On top of that, none of these places, or the routes to them, were rife with opportunities to chat up anyone. I didn’t see an attractive barista at a coffee shop. No pleasant woman walking her dog at the same time I did. And my “coworkers” were other river rat guys like me.

On my days off? That first day, I was lucky if I could limp further than the sofa. The rest of the time was spent trying to spend time with my dachshund, who I would have full time on the weekends, taking care of my personal life maintenance, attempting to stay in some type of shape, and helping maintain the property and house. I was lucky to make it into the city just one night. And being awake and at work all night, my schedule was opposite as far as the social calendar goes with most of my friends and family.

Put plainly, I was fucking lonely. And I like talking to attractive women.

People like to paint the typical OF user as simp incel dudes who have zero experience with women. At this point in my life, I was a few years removed from a divorce following a 10-year relationship, with a few girlfriends and more casual acquaintances on either side of that.

And put plainly, I was more than a little bit of a slut during some of my formative years.

Apply a little logic: how else does an ex-cop pushing middle age with a bank account as empty as a politician’s promise manage to capture the attention and interest of a woman half his age on the other side of the globe?

It’s dirt simple. I know how to hold a conversation. With people, and occasionally women. About any number of topics.

We started talking regularly now. We’d talk at various times throughout the day and while I enjoyed it, when the ban happened, I lost touch with her, and I didn’t particularly enjoy that.

So I started looking for other ways of contacting her online, potentially via social media.

What I quickly learned was that she was practically nonexistent online in any capacity that I could work with. I found countless websites with pirated images of her. I found a Twitter/X account that appeared to be little more than a spam account. She seemed completely scrubbed from all social media. I could not find her anywhere that I could reach her. But I found a defunct account on Chaturbate, where she apparently used to do live streams. From there, I found about four names that she had used over the years, during different phases of her life online.

So I started doing some searches with some of those other names.

This is when a nuclear bomb was shoved down my throat and detonated.

I won’t do to you what happened to me in early December.

Apparently, three people women in the adult entertainment industry looked a lot like her at points in their careers. One of them looked so much like her that Google directed me to a video containing this other actress with a caption that beared one of Mira’s aliases. I opened the video.

The video contained a porn shoot of the “rough face fucking” variety, a form of extreme and degradation stuff that I’d find difficult to watch for any reason on the best of days. However, in this particular video, the actress involved did not know the specific theme of the shoot. She showed up expecting fairly vanilla/regular sex. She was not prepared. Furthermore, the male actor ignored her use of a safeword. I want to be crystal clear to everyone reading this: at that moment, the video showed a crime. Once someone withdraws consent, the fun’s over. But he didn’t stop. It still makes me ill to type this, but he continued even when she attempted, as best as she was able, for reasons I won’t fucking elaborate, to say “You’re hurting me”.

And I thought I was looking at Mira.

Let’s make it even worse, shall we? The date log on the video… would have made Mira a minor.

Without going into detail, I’ll say that I thought I was watching a woman I’d come to care about deeply… having a violent sex crime committed on her while she was a minor.

I threw up into my mouth.

Filter all of what I just said through the fact that I used to be a detective… in a section that handled sex crimes and crimes against children. That often partnered with anti-human trafficking initiatives.

My desire for an attractive woman and my identity as a sex crimes detective squared off inside my head. It was a fight with razors and scissors in hand. My mental stage might look like a slaughterhouse floor or the scene of a seal slaughter on ice.

I went into a tailspin of an existential crisis on my bathroom floor. I won’t elaborate on my condition, but there were moments of me lying in a fetal position. There was a moment when I found myself whispering “I’m part of the problem” to myself over and over. I scrambled to find random pills in old prescription bottles. Anything to take a little bit of that edge away. Anything to let me leave myself alone. Anything to let me sleep.

I spent a few days after completely numbed via pharmaceuticals.

I looked up the male actor and seriously considered how difficult it would be to murder him. I found his real name and home address. I wondered. I also wondered if I had gone insane.

I don’t remember why I opened the video again, but when I did, some time later, I noticed something. The actress on screen had different tattoos. It wasn’t Mira.

Here is the transcription from the image:

⸻

The relief I felt was transcendent.

Curiosity and the cat. I looked up the actress. From what I gathered, substance abuse and alcohol had become an issue for her at some point. I wondered how much the incident on screen affected it all.

I felt like a dodged not just a bullet but a rail gun. But this incident still planted a seed in me that would bear sour fruit just down the road.

Note: to everyone condemning me for having a relationship of any sort with a woman half my age… I don’t have any excuse. I am a piece of shit. I can only say in my defence the following: as this all played out online, it didn’t feel all that real at first. And the build up to the beginning of what I would consider an actual relationship took ten months. It was so conceptually strange at that point. I viewed her as words on screen and an image in my mind. I know that I never would have approached her period point blank in real life. That wouldn’t have crossed my mind. Online, she was a pretty young but adult woman. By the time she and I began having real conversations, I didn’t think of her age as a relevant factor. I always knew what it was, but it took the back seat of the short bus to everything else. But still, I am probably not a decent human being.

I’ve already admitted to contemplating a murder and doing drugs. How much of a good person can I actually be?

If you were to ask Mira what she thought about this, she would probably tell you to mind your own fucking business, she’s an adult, and she’s navigated more minefields and nuances of human sexuality that any five of you combined could do in three lifetimes. (I described this to her once; she gave a ringing endorsement.)

Ask her about an imbalance of power. She’ll tell you there is a massive imbalance of power, and that I never stood a chance.

December has been a historically busy time in my industry during the time of all of this. I started working upwards of 70 hours a week. I hit a few weeks where I clocked 90 hours (that includes some time and a half overtime, but still). I was averaging about three to four hours a sleep a night. I was chowing down my adderall like Tic Tacs and powering down Red Bulls like a frat pledged and cheap beer.

I was so sleep deprived that coworkers thought I was using illicit street drugs.

My behavior would often slip into the delusional. And solid as my memory is, I have to look at notes to remember specific points from that month. Things were so bad in this regard, migraines followed, and I would schedule doctor’s appointments in early January to make sure I wasn’t experiencing any neurological issues.

I returned to the platform on or around December 4th and contacted Mira, and she was overjoyed to hear from me. She told me that she thought that her behavior had driven me away and that she was devastated. We resumed talking, but at this point, I was messaging her throughout the day and night. Even when I knew she was sleeping, I would send her messages that I knew she would read upon waking.

I don’t which of us is “at fault”. I don’t know who slipped first. And really, assigning blame in this case might be a fool’s errand. But. She and I had often flirted with the idea that we had deeper feelings for each other, but neither of us said anything that approached more than a hint. In fact…

At the tail end of October, during a… lively exchange, I made a comment that she mistook as a precursor to my disclosing that I was in love with her. I was actually making a poorly worded attempt at claiming sexual prowess. The conversation quickly became awkward, and I felt like a child being scolded. I hadn’t said anything that I hadn’t before, so I wasn’t sure what the issue was this time or why she interpreted things that way. She even followed up with making a point of saying that we would 100% never meet in real life, of which I was completely aware.

However, not long after that conversation, it seemed like she softened her stance, dropping from “100% never meet” to “you never know”, which raised my skepticism alarm at the time. Not about anything specific. But I worked around strippers for a while, and my coworkers and I would often joke about the guys who’d enter strip clubs and fall in love. “She doesn’t love you, bro”. My guard would pop up, then fall. Pop up, fall. Repeat.

But in December, that changed. I slipped one night and said I might be falling for her. I’m sure large doses of testosterone, estrogen, vasopressin, oxytocin, dopamine, and a number of other hormones and neurotransmitters were at work. But she said she felt the same.

I remember telling her that I was considering dropping my guard and asking if that was a bad idea. She told me it wasn’t. I told her that she still had time to run if she wanted to. She said that she didn’t want to run anywhere.

By the weekend of December 14, we were telling each other “I love you” and exchanging love letters. On a few consecutive nights, she initiated sexting sessions like someone pouncing on a boyfriend returning from work. She didn’t ask for money.

A few days after that, I noted a RADICAL shift in her voice. I remembered thinking that it sounded like a completely different person. And on top of that, she was suddenly pressuring me to purchase a video. I didn’t have an issue making a purchase or supporting her, but I’d never seen her act in such a manner. In fact, I recalled an occasion or two when my debit card’s fraud detection slowed things up, and she told me not to worry about it (“pay me tomorrow”) because resolution was taking too long and spoiling the mood. So what was going on?

This is where that seed from earlier sprouted.

January is Human Trafficking Awareness month, and I had a few checklists of possible signs to watch out for on my desktop. I’d looked at it a few times, and it was in the back of my mind while scrolling through Mira’s wall.

Cue existentialist crisis, part two.

I saw enough that I’d have flagged everything as a possible human trafficking case. Was I certain? Of course not. But at the time, I would have said that I was 90% sure she was currently or had been at one point either the victim of human trafficking or coercive control.

Here’s the items I noted on the checklist: subject always photographed alone. Subject displays possible signs of injury consistent with domestic violence, in this case, nothing too extreme, but what appeared to be a red mark consistent with a thumb print on her throat. Red and glossy eyes. Her apartment appeared to be too large for a woman her age to have on her own. It was sparsely decorated and didn’t appear very “lived in”. She appeared to be in hotels a significant portion of the time. Her videos were all of a professional quality: hair, makeup, wardrobe, location, editing, video quality. I didn’t know if she had the capability of doing all of that on her own. Additionally, she sometimes appeared to make eye contact with someone off screen, and at times she appeared to take objects from someone offscreen (as opposed to picking them up). She also appeared to change her appearance (wigs, costumes, baggy clothing) quite often. Granted, much of this was for costume and video themes. But even in her candid, around town photographs, she appeared quite different, appearing sometimes as a happy-go-lucky college student, and at other times appearing as someone with a goth/metal aesthetic. She appeared to be changing locations a fair bit in her photographs.

Now, I didn’t think that she was locked in a basement being fed gruel and forced to make content. But with a few years in the industry under her belt, I thought it was possible she might have a pimp type boyfriend or person of similar stature who was influencing her, directing her, and likely had her in a brainwashed Stockholm Syndrome situation.


Note: if anyone thinks any of this was the byproduct of some white knight syndrome, I already had plenty years playing hero on the job. What you’re seeing here is the byproduct of a sleep-deprived person reacting to incomplete information in an arena he thought he knew a bit about (and I didn’t know shit). I’m sure if I’d slept and took a few days to let the dust settle, my perspective would have been much clearer.

Not to mention, I was swept up after a pretty intoxicating mix of love-bombing and pseudo sex.

When I combined the residual effects of thinking I’d seen her hurt with the changes in voice and the possibility that she was (previously or currently) the victim of human trafficking or coercive control, I had another personal reckoning. I wondered: Had I done anything that might have gotten her in some sort of trouble if she was in a bad situation? Was the change in voice relevant or related to this possibility?

In retrospect, even though I’m insanely embarrassed by how all of this sounds now, it seemed a real enough possibility at the time. I certainly wasn’t getting a thrill out of tormenting myself. I’m not really a glutton for this type of punishment. I’m sure the sleep deprivation didn’t help.

I tried talking to her on one occasion, but I told myself going in that I would not mention human trafficking or coercive control, I would not say or do anything that could indirectly assist any bad actors (including teaching them how to be better at their jobs online, be it pretending to be someone else, establishing a background, or learning better methods of targeting potential customers).

I went in without a plan, and on the other end, I didn’t know much more than before, but I likely came across as some sort of simpleton in the manner of “I will squeeze him and pet him and name him George” ala mice and men.

Forgive me folks, I have been hit in the head a few too many times in life (seriously, several beer bottles and a baseball bat, albeit a small but still solidly wooden souvenir version, had found my cranium on more than a few occasions)

It was also during this time that I scoured the internet for OF related scams, and this was when I fully learned about OF chatters.

Back in October, I had an experience where I thought that I was talking to someone else on Mira’s account. There was some specific language. But my ban happened almost immediately after, and the nuclear bomb of thinking I had watched a video of Mira being hurt quickly followed. That experience was stored away in my memory vault, but it would be awhile before I’d retrieve it and view it as relevant.

By the time I revisited that conversation, I was pretty well fucked. I was emotionally invested, cared about this woman, but worried that she was potentially being exploited or that I was potentially being exploited. I worried that I might be talking to someone other than her at the time. Internet research only made this worse. I even entertained the thought that perhaps I was talking to a chat bot of some sort (I was not 100% wrong in this regard).

Sometime around Christmas, I was outright asking her whether or not she was working with an agency, which often employs paid chatters to interact with fans on behalf of models, and if I was ever talking to anyone but her. She steadfastly maintained that she did not and that I was not. The timeframe from Christmas to New Years is especially blurry for me, and I was so radically approaching burnout that coworkers were telling me that I needed to take some time off. Family was expressing concern. My brain was grape jelly. I caught myself falling asleep on my drive home. I was making Amazon purchases while only quasi conscious. I had text conversations and DM conversations that I don’t remember having. I made social media posts in a haze.

Over the Christmas holidays, a friend and confidant shined light upon a few things that again threw me to the earth and kicked me in the ribs.

Mira mentioned one night that she was going dancing, and she was away for a little bit longer than usual. When she returned, she spoke of being too sore to move. Her attitude towards me seemed to be clipped; it was short, aggressive, flavored with contempt.

The second time she went dancing, it happened much more spur of the moment.

I was discussing this with a friend, and my friend, one of the smarter people I know who has a good bit of background on all of this, wondered out loud if perhaps dancing was code for something else. She pulled no punches when she asked if it could mean that she was being …I have no polite way of saying this.  Saying that “someone was selling her time for money” is the best I can do. 

I actually pulled my car over and punched the steering wheel so hard and often, I’m surprised I didn’t break my hand or trigger the air bag deployment. If I were to think about this now, how ridiculous would I find it? I’ve done a bit too much introspection to think about it at that level, but at the time it felt like it explained a lot, and it reinforced the biases and ideas I had clogging up my brain.

I couldn’t reconcile the discrepancies. I couldn’t reconcile the apparent lapses in memory. How could someone forget what I told them the day before? I understand that she probably talks to many more people than I do, but still…

The one time I ask-accused her directly of being a bot, she laughed at me for three days. Then she told me that she did use ChatGPT to generate some answers. And that was it. The times that I was talking to her and thought it was a bot, it was because I was detecting the presence of AI, just not the way I thought.

Of course, I didn’t stop to consider…what if it isn’t chatters, or an agency rep, or a boyfriend, or AI, or even some form of coercion. What if she is lying to you? Maybe it’s not even malicious. Maybe she has a cover story, or several, and she forgets what they are and what she told you.

No, even in that case, there is just no way that I can reconcile some of these discrepancies. The sleazy guy back in late October, early November? I swear, after going back and reading the chat logs and then checking some other chat logs, I am certain, 100%, that I’ve talked to this same chatter working with other models. And that would make sense. They were both repped by the same agency at one point. That was something I wish had dawned on me sooner, but it was so removed, there was so much between that point and now, and I knew so much more now. Might this have all been avoided? What would this look like?

Because, whether or not I talked to someone else, I was still convinced that I had at least talked to her significantly more. I cannot believe that anyone was able to fake the amount of detail, the understanding of language, the personal history that came up in our conversations. Except maybe a boyfriend. And I had the crazy idea at this point that a girlfriend would be more likely than a boyfriend. But I am also probably at least partially insane, if not in general at least from sleep deprivation delerium.

Or I didn’t want to believe that it was anyone else.

The implications of that were… jesus christ.

How much of… me might be on file somewhere?

But I was also noticing something. She was not trying to sell me anything. We had been talking overnight for over a month, sometimes for as much as ten hours a night. When I asked her why she would spend so much time with me, her answer floored me.

Her answer was that I made her feel safe, seen, and heard. This wasn’t just someone accepting who I am; this was someone appreciating who I am. I can’t overstate the impact this had on me.

I crashed sometime in the first week of January. My neurologist said I was sleep deprived and dehydrated, and he wrote me a prescription for an 8–10 hour nap on an actual prescription pad. He said he’d order tests if I wanted them, to include an MRI and blood work.

As I started to crawl out of this wreck, I made a pledge that I was going to make sure that she was safe and OK. Not to stroke my ego. Not to satisfy some internal moral crusade. To ensure the safety of this wonderful person who made me feel appreciated for who I was. 

I ended up being wrong about so many things. But I was right about this: this woman; who seemingly came out of nowhere, became important to me in a way that I can’t really describe in a way that does it justice.

I told her about the sequence of events and her reaction was surprisingly even. She expressed concern, but also measure the levelheadedness that seemed to defy the circumstances I would push later realize the significance of this once other things came into delight, but this was the first time I said the following: “if anything happens to you, I’m going to become a household name.”

 Yeah, I said something that ridiculous. I wish this was the most ridiculous thing that I would do in a 6 to 8 months. But it’s not even close.

I wrote this summary less than three months ago, and even in that little amount of time, all of this seems now horribly outdated. 
I also came to the conclusion that despite my efforts to do something good, but I probably succeeded at most was proven that anyone who works in child or sex crimes should go through a mandatory psychiatric evaluation for PTSD before being released back into the general population.

I work in a coffee shop inside of a nice gas station. This is my 3rd week working there and I'm pretty well into the swing of things. I was working with one other girl all day today. Some lady comes up with her family and just orders a cookies and cream frappe. Yes, the default frappe has coffee in it (at least at our shop, I'm aware Starbucks has cream based fraps). No problem, my coworker makes it and gets it sent out. Mind you, my coworker is the sweetest person ever. A couple minutes later, this lady comes back and my coworker walks up to the counter since I was busy cleaning. She comes up and immediately looks and my coworker like she is stupid. So, this lady starts popping off at my coworker. ""This has coffee in it."" My coworker told her all fraps have coffee in them. The lady says ""Well I can't have coffee."" (yeah how are we supposed to know that) My coworker offers to remake it for free. 

(Okay first of all how are we supposed to know you don't want coffee in a frappe if you don't tell us and then come back and say you can't have coffee? So WHY would you come to a coffee shop...GO GET A MILKSHAKE.)

Anyways, the lady asks for my boss and so I go find her. The lady starts absolutely popping off on this little ray of sunshine. Saying you don't know anything, you're worth nothing that's why you work here, blah blah blah. And so I step in (to protect my sweet baby angel) and I say, I was the one that took your order and don't speak to her like that . If you didn't want coffee in it, you should've asked about it! Then, she starts saying it's my fault (okay, cool). My boss eventually came back and told the lady that she doesn't have time for this and told her that she needs to leave. She threw the drink at the ground and proceeded to tell her kids something along the line of ""people who work at places like this have no respect for people..."" 

But also, am I in the wrong for assuming she knew what was in a frappe? She was in her late 30's or early 40's.

Chapter 1: The Best of What's Around
The summer air hummed with a promise that felt almost tangible. Leo, perched on the edge of the old stone fountain, watched the light catch the spray, refracting into a thousand tiny rainbows. Around him, the quad of Sterling University buzzed with the frantic, exhilarating energy of orientation week. Fresh faces, wide eyes, and the nervous laughter of new friendships forming. He’d arrived with a backpack full of clothes, a guitar, and a vague notion of studying something ""interesting,"" but mostly, he’d come for the feeling. That electric current of possibility.

Across the lawn, Maya was already deep in conversation with a group of strangers, her bright scarf a beacon in the sea of muted college gear. She moved with an easy confidence, a natural magnet for stories. Leo admired that. He was more of a quiet observer, a collector of moments. He’d spent his life in a small town, dreaming of this expansive, vibrant world. Now, here it was, sprawling before him, a canvas waiting for its first brushstrokes.

""Hey, new guy!"" A voice boomed, and a hand clapped his shoulder. It was Sam, a resident advisor with an infectious grin and a perpetually rumpled t-shirt. ""Don't just sit there, the welcome BBQ is starting! Best burgers you'll ever have, probably.""

Leo grinned, pushing himself off the fountain. The sun was warm on his face, the sound of distant music drifting over. He felt it, deep in his bones: this was it. The best of what was around, right now, waiting to be lived.

Chapter 2: What Would You Say
The first few weeks were a blur of late-night study sessions, impromptu jam sessions in the dorm lounge, and philosophical debates that stretched into the dawn. Leo found himself drawn into Maya’s orbit. She was studying anthropology, fascinated by human behavior, constantly asking questions that made him think.

One evening, huddled in a cramped coffee shop, the air thick with the scent of burnt sugar and stale coffee, Maya slammed her textbook shut. ""It's insane, isn't it?"" she declared, her eyes flashing. ""All these rules, all these expectations. Who decided this was the way? Who decided we should spend our lives chasing things we don't even want, just because everyone else does?""

Leo picked at a loose thread on his sleeve. ""What would you say, then? If you could just… rewrite the script?""

She leaned forward, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. ""I'd say we're all just trying to make sense of the chaos. We build these elaborate structures – careers, traditions, even relationships – to keep the fear at bay. But what if the fear is the point? What if the real living is in the uncertainty?""

Her words hung in the air, a challenge. Leo felt a thrill, a jolt of recognition. It was a question he’d been asking himself, quietly, for years. But Maya had the courage to shout it into the crowded room. He wondered, if he were truly honest, what he would say. What truths would tumble out if he stopped censoring himself?

Chapter 3: Satellite
As the semester wore on, the initial euphoria began to settle into a rhythm. Leo found himself spending more time alone, observing. He'd sit by his window late at night, watching the distant lights of the city, feeling like a satellite orbiting a world he was still trying to understand.

He saw Maya less often. She was always surrounded, a whirlwind of activity, passionate debates, and new projects. He admired her energy, but sometimes, he felt a pang of loneliness. He was close enough to see her, to hear her laughter, but too far to truly connect in the way he craved.

One rainy afternoon, he found himself in the campus art gallery, drawn to a large, abstract painting. It was a riot of muted blues and greys, with a single, vibrant streak of orange cutting across the canvas. It reminded him of Maya – bright and bold, moving through a world that sometimes felt indistinct. He wondered if she ever felt like him, a solitary observer, watching the world spin from a quiet distance. He knew, intellectually, that everyone had their own inner worlds, their own quiet orbits. But knowing didn't always make the distance feel less vast.

Chapter 4: Rhyme & Reason
Leo’s philosophy class became an unexpected anchor. Professor Davies, a woman with kind eyes and a sharp intellect, encouraged them to dissect ideas, to find the underlying patterns in seemingly disparate concepts. It was a slow, arduous process, like untangling a complex knot, but deeply satisfying.

He started applying this logic to his own life. The seemingly random encounters, the fleeting conversations, the small decisions – they all contributed to a larger narrative. He saw the ""rhyme"" in the recurring themes of human connection and isolation, the ""reason"" in the inevitable consequences of choices.

He began writing more, not just songs, but prose, trying to articulate the intricate dance of cause and effect he observed. He wrote about the way people mirrored each other, the subtle harmonies and dissonances in their interactions. It wasn't always clear, sometimes the patterns were obscured by noise, but he was learning to listen for the melody beneath the surface. He realized that understanding wasn't about having all the answers, but about appreciating the complexity of the questions.

Chapter 5: Typical Situation
Mid-terms hit like a brick wall. The initial excitement of college had given way to the grind. Leo found himself falling into a routine: classes, library, dorm, repeat. The vibrant colors of orientation week had faded to a dull grey. He saw his peers, once so full of individual spark, now hunched over laptops, eyes glazed over, chasing grades and internships.

He felt a growing unease. This wasn't the expansive world he'd envisioned. This felt like a conveyor belt, moving everyone towards a predetermined destination. He saw the ""typical situation"" playing out around him, and a part of him recoiled. Was this what it meant to grow up? To trade dreams for stability, passion for practicality?

One evening, he skipped a study group and walked to the edge of campus, to a small, overgrown patch of woods. He sat on a fallen log, pulling out his guitar. He played a slow, melancholic tune, letting the notes wander, untethered by structure or expectation. He felt a quiet defiance bloom within him. He didn't want to be typical. He didn't want to lose the vibrant, questioning spirit that had brought him here. He wanted to find his own path, even if it meant walking alone for a while.

Chapter 6: Dancing Nancies
The university's annual Spring Gala was a spectacle of forced elegance and awkward mingling. Leo, reluctantly dragged along by a well-meaning roommate, felt like an alien observer. He watched the ""Dancing Nancies"" – the students and faculty, dressed in their finest, performing the intricate social dances of networking and polite conversation.

He saw the smiles that didn't reach the eyes, the practiced gestures, the subtle jockeying for position. He saw Maya across the room, effortlessly gliding through conversations, a queen among her court. He wondered if she felt the artifice of it all, or if she was simply better at the dance.

He found himself in a quiet corner, watching a lone figure sketching in a small notebook. It was a girl he’d seen in his art history class, quiet and intense. He approached her. ""Mind if I watch?"" he asked. She looked up, startled, then offered a small, genuine smile. They talked about art, about the absurdity of the gala, about the quiet rebellion of creating something real in a world obsessed with superficiality. It was a small, unexpected connection in a sea of performative interactions, a moment of true rhythm amidst the discordant steps.

Chapter 7: Ants Marching
The end of the academic year brought a sense of frenetic activity. Everyone was rushing – packing, planning, saying hurried goodbyes. Leo watched the endless stream of cars leaving campus, a parade of lives moving on, each individual a tiny ant in a vast, interconnected colony.

He felt a strange mix of relief and melancholy. The year had flown by, a blur of lessons learned and experiences gained. He thought about the album title, Under the Table and Dreaming, and how it came from a lyric in ""Ants Marching"": ""He remembers being small / playing under the table and dreaming."" He realized that even amidst the relentless march of life, there was still that inner child, that part of him that dreamed and questioned and sought something more.

He saw Maya one last time, amidst the chaos of moving out. ""So, what's next?"" he asked, genuinely curious. She shrugged, a hint of her old spark in her eyes. ""The world, I guess. More questions. More living."" He nodded. They were all marching, yes, but perhaps they could choose their own direction, even if it was just a slight deviation from the path.

Chapter 8: Lover Lay Down
Summer found Leo back in his small hometown, a quiet reprieve after the intensity of university life. He spent his days working at a local bookstore, surrounded by the comforting scent of old paper and new stories. In the evenings, he’d walk to the old quarry, a secluded spot where he could watch the stars.

It was there he reconnected with Sarah, a childhood friend he hadn't seen much since high school. She was home for the summer too, working at her family's diner. They fell into an easy rhythm, sharing stories, laughter, and comfortable silences. One night, under a sky dusted with a million stars, they lay on a blanket, hands clasped, the quiet hum of crickets the only sound.

There was a profound simplicity to it, a gentle unfolding. No grand pronouncements, no dramatic gestures, just the quiet comfort of shared presence. It was a different kind of connection than the intellectual sparring with Maya, or the fleeting camaraderie at the gala. This was a soft landing, a gentle understanding, a quiet affirmation of belonging. It was the feeling of a ""lover lay down,"" not just in a romantic sense, but in the deep, peaceful intimacy of true companionship.

Chapter 9: Jimi Thing
The summer took an unexpected turn when an old, eccentric artist, known only as ""The Maestro,"" set up a temporary studio in an abandoned warehouse on the edge of town. He put out a call for volunteers, ""anyone with a spark of creativity,"" to help him with a sprawling, collaborative art installation.

Leo, drawn by curiosity, signed up. The Maestro was a whirlwind of unpredictable energy, his ideas flowing like a wild river. One day, they were painting murals with repurposed house paint; the next, they were constructing bizarre sculptures from found objects. There was no plan, no blueprint, just a constant, joyful improvisation.

It felt like ""Jimi Thing"" – full of unexpected musical twists and flourishes, a kind of regal, uninhibited freedom. Leo found himself shedding his usual quiet observation, embracing the chaos, letting his own creativity flow without judgment. He painted with abandon, sculpted with intuition, and laughed more freely than he had in months. It was a reminder that life didn't always have to follow a logical progression; sometimes, the most profound experiences came from simply letting go and seeing where the current took you.

Chapter 10: Warehouse
As the deadline for the art installation approached, the warehouse transformed into a hive of frantic activity. Volunteers worked around the clock, fueled by coffee and a shared sense of purpose. The space, once empty and echoing, now pulsed with the energy of creation.

Leo found himself immersed in the collective effort. He was part of something vast, a machine of human ingenuity and collaboration. There were moments of frustration, arguments over design choices, and the sheer exhaustion of long hours. But there was also a profound sense of camaraderie, a shared understanding that they were building something bigger than themselves.

It was the ""Warehouse"" – a place of intense labor, of collective effort, of being swept up in a grand, sometimes overwhelming, project. He saw the beauty in the organized chaos, the way individual contributions melded into a cohesive whole. It wasn't always pretty, but it was real, tangible, and deeply satisfying. He realized that even in the most demanding situations, there was a unique kind of beauty in the shared struggle and the eventual triumph of creation.

Chapter 11: Pay for What You Get
The art installation was a resounding success. The opening night was packed, the town buzzing with excitement. People marveled at the sheer scale and originality of the work. Leo felt a surge of pride, a deep satisfaction in having contributed to something so meaningful.

But in the quiet aftermath, as the crowds dispersed and the lights dimmed, a different feeling settled in. He looked at the finished work, a monument to weeks of effort, and felt a quiet exhaustion. There was a cost to creation, to intense collaboration, to pouring so much of yourself into a project. The exhilaration faded, replaced by a sense of depletion.

It was the ""Pay for What You Get"" moment. The reward was immense, but so was the toll. He understood that every choice, every pursuit, came with its own set of consequences, its own price. It wasn't a negative realization, but a mature one. Life wasn't just about the highs; it was about understanding the full spectrum of experience, the quiet moments of reckoning that followed the grand achievements. He sat alone in the vast, now quiet, warehouse, accepting the weight of the experience, the subtle jazz of its conclusion.

Chapter 12: #34
The summer ended, and Leo prepared to return to Sterling University. He packed his bags, his guitar, and a new collection of memories. The warehouse stood empty again, a silent testament to the art that had briefly filled it. Sarah was back at her diner, and The Maestro had moved on to his next mysterious project.

There were no grand pronouncements, no dramatic farewells. Just the quiet hum of anticipation for what lay ahead. He thought about the year, the friendships made, the lessons learned, the shifting landscapes of his own understanding. He didn't have all the answers, and the world still felt vast and full of questions.

But there was a new sense of peace, a quiet confidence. He knew he was still marching, still orbiting, still dreaming. But now, he felt more grounded, more aware of the intricate dance of life, the interplay of light and shadow, chaos and order. He was no longer just under the table, dreaming; he was stepping out, ready to embrace the journey, one quiet, deliberate step at a time. The melody of his life continued, an unfolding instrumental, rich with mood and vibe, waiting for the next note.",6,1748829915.0,DMB,0,1.0,False

Ultimately, everything looks normal so far, NIPT results came back cleared across the board, and I'm waiting on the sonogram official results this week. The ultrasound tech had a very offputting bedside manner, but my husband thinks I'm overreacting a bit. First, I arrived 15 min early and asked the tech if I could change into sweatpants and a t-shirt, since I was wearing an outfit to work that day that wasn't ultrasound friendly. She rolled her eyes and said yes. I asked if she needed a urine sample, she said yes. Then I got in, we start the scan and for the ten millionth time she tells me how gassy I am and how the scan is more difficult because of the amount of gas I have. I was like ""I'm sorry... do I have IBS or something? I feel fine but you always tell me how gassy I am"" her response was to shrug. She immediately said ""this baby is in an AWFUL position, did you eat or drink before coming here"" I said ""Yes, I had a bigger than usual high protein lunch, plenty of water today, 1 coffee this morning, and a lemonade before coming here"" she said I was supposed to drink juice 20 min before arrival. I was very apologetic and said I had no idea this was the case, I thought my lunch and beverages of choice before the ultrasound would be a sufficient amount of sugar. She again rolled her eyes and was like ""I tell ALL my patients to drink juice right before coming here"" \*hands me a juicebox\* then proceeds to tell me repeatedly that the baby isn't moving, she can't see what she needs to see, sending me into a blind panic. Then she asks if I have blood sugar issues. I said no. I asked if the baby's heart was beating and she said yes, and that I need to relax. She then starts moving my stomach (shaking it) with the ultrasound probe to get the baby to move. I said ""ouch"" because I was startled. She said ""Oh, did that hurt? I'm trying to get this lazy baby to move."" I think she used the word lazy 20 times. So, as she's trying to get the baby to move, she's giving me zero positive feedback about what she CAN see. I asked her to tell me what was going on, and she said she couldn't see what she needed to see because the baby isn't in a good position, isn't being cooperative about moving aorund, so we had to do a transvaginal ultrasound. Then my anxiety hit big time. Every bad scenario creeps into my head. I tried to stay calm but couldn't. After 10 minutes I asked for a break. She got the doctor even though I repeatedly said I was fine, I just needed a minute because I was flustered. She said she had concerns about hypertension (she didn't take my blood pressure before or during the scan, I have zero history of hypertension or this level of medical anxiety). My doctor walked in and I was like I'm sorry, I'm nervous, I'm trying not to be but I can't control it. I took some sips of water, stretched, then we continued the scan. The tech then said she could see what she needed to, but she couldn't get ""any cute pictures of the baby because the baby is being so lazy, just a weird one where the baby kinda looks like a monster."" At that point I said I didn't care. I was so shaken up and felt so negatively about this leaving the appointment. I asked my doctor if there were any red flags, he assured me all went well and if it didn't he would've said something already.

By Z.

Hi.
I’m here to tell you my story — from scratch to… well, still scratch.
Because honestly, I feel like I haven’t made it yet.
I’m Z, and this is my life.
I was born in 2003, in a poor neighborhood buried deep in the darker side of Rabat, Morocco — the part most people don’t even know exists.
When people think of Rabat, they imagine a city of flowers, embassies, and clean streets. A capital full of rich people with nice clothes, good jobs, and fancy cars. But if you’ve never been poor in Rabat, you don’t really know what this city is.
Being broke in Rabat is worse than being broke in a small village.
At least in a village, people are used to struggling. But here, if you don’t have money, you’re invisible. Worse — you’re a problem.
Especially when you’re a teenager with just enough intelligence to start questioning your future.
Every day, I watched people my age pull up in luxury cars, flexing on social media while I had nothing but frustration and questions.
Why them?
Why not me?
But you don’t get answers in this country. Especially if your family doesn’t run a million-dollar business — or isn’t connected to the thieves that run the system from the top.
I started my education in public school. Most of the guys I sat next to back then?
Now they’re either locked up because of football ultras or small-time robberies.
My grades were never great — never terrible either. I was the classic average student, hovering around 50% year after year.
Then came Baccalauréat.
I failed the first time.
It was during COVID. Only three of us were in the exam room, watched by two teachers. One of them even let us use our phones. Still, I ended up being dragged into some police mess. Long story.
After a second try, I finally passed. But it wasn’t easy.
Later, I enrolled in OFPPT  I passed the first year.
But the second year? Out of 60 students, I was the only one who failed.
And weirdly… I was okay with that.
I always felt like I didn’t fit into average.
That maybe my level — or at least my way of thinking — didn’t belong in a system made for survival, not success.
Preparing for the Next Step
Right now, I’m preparing for the EFF exam (Fin Formation).
Honestly, I think I’m going to pass it. I never miss a second chance when it comes to something important.
I’ll tell you later what happened — how it went.

Love and Healing
As for love?
I don’t think it’s made for me.
Every time I let myself care, I end up getting cheated on.
So I stopped catching feelings altogether. It hurts too much.
I don’t want to put myself in that position again because I’m not far from falling into depression — or worse.
I’ve been through some trauma, so I’m learning to be easy on myself now.
To protect myself.

Where I Am Today
I’m 21 years old.
I have nothing except my computer and some jazz music playing through my headphones.
I’m not really a big fan of jazz, but somehow it helps me relax and focus when I need to create or just think.

What’s Next?
I think this summer, after I finish my exams, I’m finally going to do something for my life.
Because I’m done.
Done going to the same coffee shop with the same people every day.
Done waking up in the afternoon, wasting the day.
Done asking my parents for money.
Done feeling stuck.
It’s time for change.

At that time, it was summer, we were on vacation and I always used to be alone in my house in the afternoon because my mom and brothers were going to visit my grandmother that day. My dad brought me the milk and when I opened the box and was preparing coffee, a small ball came in, snacking from outside. I thought it was one of my brothers who had already returned, so I looked and there was no one (it should be noted that the music was very loud). There was no noise, just that, when I go back inside and continue with the coffee the little ball comes out and when I look there was the figure of a little boy I swear it was the figure and it was all black and it was 7 in the afternoon.

I finally moved back in with my parents when i was 7 years old. And from that time until now, my parents have made almost every day extremely stressful. 
My parents fight almost every single day. but now like normal adult fighting. They will argue over things like there being too much creamer in coffee. My mom has schizophrenia, and it is not being treated at all. So she’ll have delusions about people coming to hurt her in some way. And that will often break out fights with them too. There fights have led to broken fingers, black eyes, police calls, orders of protection. 
My dad always takes anger out on me and my siblings. He usually just says really mean things and yells. But sometimes he hurts us.
Living with them has caused me to have multiple panic attacks a day, and it leaves me in physical pain. 

But recently, a few weeks ago i came over to stay with my aunt and uncle. I told my parents i was going to stay until the end of the school year so i’m able to get to school and get my grades up (my parents don’t make us go to school so I miss a lot of days)
And anyways, ive noticed im still having panic attacks even though im not in that environment, and I havent been in a few weeks. 
Its really little things too. Like if I knock over a cup or bump into someone. Im immediately just sent into this state of panic. I hate it so much and I just want to be able to handle little mistakes like these like a normal person. 
Other times nothing even triggers it, it just happens randomly and I dont know how to make it better. But when im in this state of panic I tend to resort to unhealthy coping mechanisms.

This was at its peak in mid-April where every time I’d ask her if she wanted to hang out her response was that she was doing something with Jack (e.g. going to eat with him, going to his parents’ house with him, etc.) and this caused a temporary strain in our friendship.

When she was with her previous boyfriend Michael, she was always bellowing off me and the two other friends in our group to be with him. But I was willing to give her another chance after he dumped her for no reason and turned out to be a giant douchebag. 

However I didn’t want to experience that again cause I’m of the belief that if you’re in a relationship you shouldn’t cast your friends completely aside and that you should have a good balance between spending time with your S/O and spending time with your friends/family. And if I was in a relationship myself, I’d hold myself to this standard cause you should always make sure everybody you love feels included in your life.

Anyways so back to Kelly putting me on the back burner for Jack. I sought out advice from my friend Sarah (19f) and she suggested I should make Kelly miss me. I ended up not having to do that as me and Kelly had made up by the end of the month and everything was fine for about another month.

However recently whenever I’d ask Kelly if she wanted to hang out or grab dinner or whatever, she was always doing something with Jack and the one time that she said she’d let me know, she didn’t do that and ended up going out with Jack that night. 

This semester she’s also been not the best at communicating with me, such as yesterday when she didn’t tell me when she was going to the pool (we were going to tan) and so Jack brought her and her friend Tracy who joined us energy drinks from the coffee shop that he works at. I was a little upset that she didn’t tell me they were getting drinks (and she knows I love that particular coffee shop, she gave me a gift card to it when I had my graduation) so I went back to my apartment and changed real quick to go walk to it (it’s only a 5-minute walk) and get a drink and then I came back to the pool.

Anyways so that night I asked Kelly if she wanted to grab dinner because I was out of food and my parents didn’t have enough servings of their casserole otherwise I would’ve eaten at my house with them. Well she said she was probably going out with Jack depending on when he got off of work and then she ended up doing that so I ate by myself that night.

I’m gonna take Sarah’s advice and not talk to Kelly for the rest of the week to make her miss me and make her want to reach out because a lot of times this semester I’ve been the only one putting in effort to plan hangouts/dinner/etc. and I can’t be the one to do that all the time. I’m of the belief that friendships are a two-way street and both friends need to pull their weight.

-Heat intolerance. I damn near passed out at a picnic a couple weeks ago. 
-Tremors in my hands. I was blaming this on my Wellbutrin (even though I’ve been on it for years)
-Diarrhea. Like. So often it’s ridiculous. God forbid I have coffee I will shit ten times in one day. I blamed this on my endo.
-High heart rate and chest pain. I’ve been getting high heart rate notifications nearly every day since November (when I got my watch) and feel like my heart skips a beat often/sometimes feels like it’s going to jump right out of my chest.
-Irritabilty, anxiety, feeling like I want to peel my skin off. 
-Weight loss. This has happened a couple times prior in the last couple years.

-I never really get sleepy I could stay up all night if I wanted to. I take cannabis RSO oil for my back and endo pain most nights though so that does knock me out. 
-I used to frequent the gym but I have been feeling SO exhausted and weak since the winter.

Now she sees two great guys, find support in her friends, and found support in a women’s pleasure group. She even chats about her favorite vibrators with her hairstylist. I’m genuinely happy for her—she deserves it. I have never seen her more comfortable with herself.

Meanwhile, I still struggle with body image and shame. I haven’t found the same kind of support outside of her and my therapist. I’ve gotten coffee with two people, but it didn’t go anywhere. I’m happy for her growth, but the contrast is hard to look at without thinking that there must be something wrong with me. I still feel isolated, and it’s taken me to pretty dark places at times.

I was somewhat expecting my experience to look like this, but it’s harder than I realized. And I’m earnestly trying to figure out what I need and find it. Have other people experienced this? How have you gotten through it? Where/how did you find the support you needed outside of finding someone?",4,1748829113.0,polyamory,4,1.0,False

Original Story Written by: Jack Boyd

Chapter 1

It’s strange how the tiniest things can ignite a storm inside a person. Like the radio blaring through heavy traffic, its static crackling in the claustrophobic silence. I won’t have to listen to my dad’s complaints about it anymore. Outside the window, the cars inch forward in a sluggish crawl, the city’s skyline fading behind us. My mom sits beside me, her voice almost a whisper as she hums along, forcing herself to sing—probably to drown out the memories of my dad’s constant silence. Tommy, my little brother, is in the back, fingers flying over the screen playing Roblox, oblivious to the weight of everything. He’s just about to turn nine, still trying to grasp why Mom and Dad aren’t together anymore. I don’t want to spoil his innocence with my own worries. As we edge closer to the outskirts of town, I notice Mom’s nose scrunching and her hands tightening on the wheel, her knuckles white. This move—this new start—it's a hard road for anyone, especially her.

“Where’s your charger?” Tommy asked.

“It’s in one of the boxes in the trunk, I think,” I replied. You would’ve thought I just hurt a dog in front of Tommy the way he reacted.  

“Why are we moving so far from Dad?! Is he coming with us later?” Tommy screamed.  

“No honey, your dad and I love you very much, but we’re having a difficult time right now,” my mom tried to comfort Tommy.  

As Tommy was sniffing his tears away, I reached in my pocket and gave him a Chief Wahoo pin. My dad loves Cleveland baseball, and he would always take Tommy to the games. I wish just once he would take me. Giving Tommy that pin reminded him of Dad and brought him just enough comfort to pull himself together.  

We’ve been driving for thirty minutes and haven’t seen a single restaurant or grocery store—just a Dollar General and deer crossing signs. That’s what most of Ohio consisted of outside of the city.  

Finally, we pull into our new home, surrounded by woods. It’s nothing fancy, just a humble three-bedroom, two-story house. We stretch as we get out of the car and just stand, staring, in silence.  

Mom broke the silence by saying, “C'mon boys! Let's see your new rooms!”  

It was nice to think that I was finally going to have my own room. Tommy and I had to share a room, and most of the time share a bed. Not because we only had one bed, but because sometimes we heard Mom and Dad fighting, and Tommy would be scared and slip into my bed while I was sleeping.  

Breaking free of the trance, I shake my head and grab my bag from the car. I pat Tommy on the back, and we make our way up the old wooden porch. From what I was guessing, I would say this house was built in the 60s—based on the house’s chipping paint, creaky wooden porch, and vintage window curtains. But again, I’m excited for this new chapter. Well, not really excited, but intrigued.  

When Mom finally pushed open the front door, I braced myself for chaos—broken furniture, trash strewn across the floor, signs of a hurried abandonment. Instead, I was met with an unnerving stillness. The house felt frozen in time, as if the owners had simply disappeared, leaving everything exactly as it was—furniture draped in ghostly layers of dust, curtains hanging limp and yellowed, swaying faintly as if disturbed by an unseen breeze. The stale air clung to my skin, thick with the scent of neglect and forgotten memories. Every step I took echoed unnaturally loud in the oppressive silence, like the house was holding its breath, waiting for something to happen.

I help Tommy with his bags as he runs upstairs to see his new room. I throw mine over my shoulder and head up the stairs. *Pop-ching! Pop-ching!* I freeze. These steps—they don’t even creek when I step on them. They… well, I’ve never heard steps that make that noise.  

“Mom!” I shout. “Watch what happens when I walk on these steps.”  

*Pop-ching!* As I put my weight on the first step.  

“Huh, that’s unique!” My mom then turns away to continue unpacking boxes. I have a feeling that bothers her too, but she’s trying to stay positive. So I don’t say anything either—I’ll just have to put up with the odd noise. I’ll have to figure out another way to sneak out at night.  

I reach the top of the stairs to see one single hallway where all three bedroom doors meet. I enter the first one to see Tommy looking out the window.  

“Hey buddy, wanna help me unpack your games?” I ask him.  

But he’s just staring out the window.  

“Tommy?” I ask again.  

“Oh, sorry, I was looking at that old barn out there,” he replied.

“The old barn?” I look outside to see a leaning wooden barn, about half the size of the house. “Maybe we can check it out after we unpack.” I say, trying to get Tommy to help me.  

Like a conductor on stage, Tommy told me where and how exactly he wanted his toys—how to face them and what position they should be in.  

“My pin!” Tommy yelled as he frantically checked his pockets.  

“Don’t worry, we’ll find it. You just had it; it can’t be far,” I reassured him.  

After scouring his room, I figured it was in the car, when I gave it to him. I walk down the *unique* stairs and go outside. I open the rear passenger door and see it on the floor.  

As I close the door, Tommy yells from my bedroom window, “Was it there?!”  

“Go Indians!” I jokingly say as I lift up the pin.  

Suddenly, a faint voice sliced through the silence—distorted, broken, like a record scratched beyond repair. It was close enough to make my skin crawl, yet distant enough to be dismissed as a neighbor. But I knew better. The voice was warped, fragments of words drifting in and out, echoing with unnatural echo. My mind spun, trying to find sense in the fractured sounds. ‘Did we even have neighbors?’ I wondered, trembling. ‘Or is something else here—something that shouldn’t be?’ The voice’s strange, broken cadence sent icy shivers down my spine, each word a jagged shard of a nightmare I couldn’t wake from.   

“You moved my bed wrong.” Tommy instructed me from my bedroom, which broke me out of my deep thoughts.

“Get out of my room.” I plainly say as I walk inside.  

Nothing was in my room; I was just tired of getting bossed around by an almost nine-year-old.

Chapter 2

The first night passed, and now the house had a mix of the old furniture from the previous owner and the items we brought. Mom is very happy that she doesn’t have to buy new couches or lamps, since I know she can’t afford them.  

I decided to crash on the old couch, as I didn’t get a full night’s rest. I woke up last night with Tommy asking if he could sleep with me. The old springs groaned loudly beneath me as I plummeted onto the sagging couch, its rusted coils protesting with a squeal.

We really didn’t bring much furniture—since we didn’t have any—but one thing we did bring was the TV. I turned on *The Sopranos*, and before I knew it, I was extremely tired.  

I woke up to see Cleveland Baseball on the TV, but Tommy was nowhere to be found. Annoyed, I get up and look for Tommy. *Pop-ching! Pop-ching! Pop-ching!* as I run up the stairs.  

“If you’re going to change the channel, at least be there to watch it!” I yell as I turn the corner into Tommy’s room. But he’s not there.  

I walk up to his window and look out into the backyard, where I see him just as he enters the barn. Curious about what Tommy was doing, I head downstairs so I can follow him. I exit the front door and slowly start to make my way to the backyard. At this point, I realize that I never took in the surroundings outside of the house. I glance at the peeling siding and chipped paint, but I don't look at it with disgust. I'm almost in awe that the outside of the house is basically falling apart, yet we find the inside untouched.

*BAM!* “What the—?” As I was looking at the house, I seemed to run into an old dog house. Just like the outside of our home, the dog house has seen better days. It has white siding and a red-painted roof, which is chipping. Right above the entrance, I see a painted-on bone with a name written on it. “Samson,” I mumble under my breath. No sign of any dog here.

I pick up my pace and jog to the barn. I stop before walking through the open doors of the barn to appreciate how it's still standing, even though it has an impressive lean. “Tommy?” I nervously ask. With no response, I enter the barn. The rusty tools clink softly as I brush past them, their jagged edges catching what little light filtered in. The air inside the barn was thick with the scent of mold, old hay, and decay. I could feel the rough, cold wood of the beams beneath my fingertips and hear the distant drip of water echoing through the stale silence. Straw covers the ground, and there are soggy bales of hay that look like they were placed 40 years ago. A drip of water falls on the bridge of my nose, startling me. I look up to see more sky than roof.

""Tommy, seriously, come on."" My voice edged with impatience as I scanned the barn. Two horse stalls sit against the weathered wood, the first one creaking softly. I hear a faint rustling from inside. ""Dude,"" I say, more sharply now, stepping closer. The gate is closed, but the wood has been rotted thin, gaps opening like broken teeth. I lean in, squinting. There—an eye glints back at me through the cracks. My stomach tightens. I jump back, slipping on the damp hay sprawled across the ground, and stumble onto the dirt.

I hear a burst of laughter, It’s Tommy, pushing open the gate with a grin. I glare at him, trying to catch my breath.

""Yeah, real funny,"" I mutter, “What are you doing here?” 

“You told me to come in here! I heard you call me out here, but I couldn't find you, so I thought we were playing a game. Remember when you said we could explore the barn after we put my things away?”

“Uh, yeah, I guess I did say that,” I replied. I rub my eyes and head, feeling a mix of confusion and the aftereffects of the fall.

“C'mon, let's go inside,” I say as I rub his back.

“Wanna watch baseball with me, Jonathan?!” Tommy asked me eagerly.

“Sure, buddy.” I replied.

Chapter 3

The room was cloaked in darkness, the only sound was my steady breathing and the TV commercials. Despite the silence, a strange comfort washed over me—this rare quiet, broken only by distant creaks and the whisper of the wind outside, made me feel like I was finally alone in this haunted place. It's only the second week of being here—in our new house, in our new life. Not surprisingly, baseball is on the TV. It's not even a live game; it's a rerun. Just having the game on in the background reminds Tommy of Dad. Tommy never saw the side of Dad I saw. He only saw the side that took him to games and bought him a hotdog.

I sit in the old recliner in the living room, next to the couch. I look into the kitchen and see the back door, and notice something odd about it. The back door was a fortress—no window to see outside, just three heavy locks securing it. The thick, dark wood seemed to absorb the moonlight, leaving the house feeling more like a prison than a home. I wondered who had built it like this—what secrets did those locks hide? Now that I notice that, I realize there are no windows on the ground floor. But who knows what they were thinking when they built this house in the '60s. Maybe it had something to do with the Cold War.

I relax as I watch the rerun alone. Mom was asleep after a long day of work, and Tommy was in his room doing who knows what. What I was most excited about in our new lives was the quiet. You’d be surprised how stressful it was, living all together—listening to Dad try to sneak out with his latest woman, slipping through the kitchen like a thief, while Mom yelled at him from the front door. Sometimes, it was a guy. Over time, you stop reacting. You go numb. Mom fell into that same trap. But thankfully, my aunt helped her break free.

I jolt upright from the chair, gasping, sweat sticking to my skin. I must’ve dozed off. The TV flickers with an old shopping commercial; I switch it off and stand. As I turn toward the stairs, I catch it—a muffled voice, faint but strange: “Watchhhhhh… baseball?” My heart skips. I freeze. That’s Tommy outside, right? But it doesn’t sound like him. It’s like he’s learning to talk again—mumbling, uncertain, almost like a toddler. I rub my eyes, trying to shake the fog. But I can’t go check the window—there are no windows here.

I wait and wait, but nothing happens. “Maybe Tommy was sleep talking? Or it was still part of my dream,” I ask myself in my head. I finally decide to head up to my room, so I turn around and go up the stairs. Damn, I totally forgot that we have *unique* stairs. I'll have to try my best to be as quiet and light as possible when I take these steps. I carefully place my foot on the first step. *Pop-ching!* The sound rings out sharply in the silence. My stomach tightens. I freeze, holding my breath. The noise echoes unnaturally loud. I quickly shift my weight against the wall, trying to muffle the sound, but the *Pop-ching!* repeats, each step feeling heavier with dread.

“Hello? What’s going on?” Mom’s voice is groggy, fogged with exhaustion.

I hang my head, feeling defeated. “Sorry, Mom—I fell asleep downstairs. Just... tired.” I hate robbing her of the little sleep she gets lately.

She offers a faint, tired smile. “It’s okay, honey. I’ll see you in the morning.”  

I force a faint smile and hurriedly climb the creaky stairs. *Pop-ching! Pop-ching!* Each step sounds like a scream in the silent house. I grit my teeth. “Why do these stupid stairs sing every time I step on them?” I mutter, my voice edged with irritation.  I stumble into my room and collapse onto the bed. The only light filters in through the window—an icy blue glow from the moon. My body aches from exhaustion, but a faint shiver still runs down my spine from that dream—Tommy’s voice echoing strange and distorted. I sit up stiffly, pulling the curtains closed, shutting out the darkness and trying to shake off the unease.

Chapter 4

It’s been a month since we moved, and today marks the day Tommy’s been counting down to since we arrived. The day Dad finally takes him to a Cleveland Indians game. From the moment the sun rose, Tommy’s been bursting with energy—wearing his Indians jersey and cap, talking nonstop about the game like it’s the biggest event of his life. Meanwhile, I feel a quiet knot in my stomach—this is the day Mom’s least looked forward to: seeing her ex-husband again.

I don’t feel much about Dad—no anger, no warmth. It’s like he’s a stranger I pass in the hall. And I’m pretty sure he feels the same. But if Tommy’s smile can be because of him, then maybe that’s enough. I slip into the kitchen, peeking around the corner just enough to hear Mom talking softly on the phone. Her voice is calm, but I catch certain words—her mentioning a date with her ex. I stop, pressing my back against the wall, trying not to make a sound. It’s almost shocking—only a month out of love, and she’s already talking about dating again? Or maybe she’d fallen out of love long before she left him. The thought stings, sharper than I expected.

I step outside with Tommy, tossing the ball back and forth beneath the fading late-afternoon sky. The yard is quiet, save for the occasional laugh or thud of the ball. About fifteen minutes in, a strange voice cuts through the stillness: “Samson? Where areee...?” The words are drawn out, distorted, like they’re coming from far away, then abruptly cut off with a scratchy, static-like noise. 

As I turn to face where the voice came from, the ball hits me in the back of the neck, startling me and breaking the moment. 

“Sorry, Johnathan!” Tommy yells, his face pale with worry.  

I rub the spot where the ball hit, grimacing. “No, it’s okay,” I say, trying to keep my voice steady. “I thought we didn’t have neighbors around here.” 

Tommy tilts his head, eyes wide. “Maybe they’re looking for their dog?” he suggests softly, voice tentative.  

I glance in the direction where the old, weathered dog house sits in shadow. “There’s an old dog house back there,” I murmur, more to myself than him. A chill runs down my spine.  

Tommy hesitates, then asks quietly, “Should we go check?”

“No, let’s go inside,” I say quickly. I lock the door behind us, the click echoing in the quiet house. The air feels heavier now, shadows stretching across the walls. I flick on the TV, tuning into the game, trying to drown out the strange feeling crawling up my spine. Tommy plops onto the couch, eyes fixed on the screen, while I listen to Mom upstairs—still on the phone, her muffled voice drifting down.

I lean closer, catching snippets of her muffled voice upstairs. “I know! Maybe Pink?” she whispers, her tone tentative.  

“Well, you know...” she trails off, voice lowering to a whisper I can barely hear.  

“We did have that thing—what, nine years ago?” The words hang in the air, strange and out of place. My stomach tightens. What are they talking about?  

My heart leaps as Tommy suddenly appears beside me, eyes wide. “What’s nine years ago?” he asks innocently, but there’s a hint of curiosity I don’t like.  

I startle, turning sharply. “What are you doing? I thought you were watching the game,” I say, voice tight. Without thinking, I gently but firmly push him onto the couch, trying to mask my rising unease.

I hear the gravel beneath the driveway crunch loudly as a figure appears. Tommy’s eyes widened with anticipation. Without hesitation, he bolts outside, sprinting toward the battered Chevy parked at the edge of the yard.  

“Dad!” Tommy shouts, voice full of excitement.

Dad steps out of the car, a wide grin spreading across his face. “Tommy, my man! How’s my little buddy?” he calls, opening his arms.  

Tommy charges forward, launching himself into a hug. Dad ruffles his hair affectionately, a fleeting smile touching his lips—though I notice a flicker of something guarded in his eyes.

Dad approaches cautiously, voice hesitant. “Hey, Johnathan. How’s the new house treating you?”  

I shrug, trying to keep my tone neutral. “Fine.”  

He glances toward the house, then asks softly, “Where’s your mom?”  

“Upstairs,” I reply. He hesitates, then just settles onto the porch steps, watching the house but not going inside.

Suddenly, Dad raises his voice, calling out, “Heather! Heather! Come here!” His tone is casual but urgent, almost like he’s calling a lost dog.  

From upstairs, I hear Mom’s voice, soft but wary. “John, what is it?” she calls, peeking around the doorframe.  

Dad gestures impatiently. “Come here! Let me see you,” he insists, voice firm but strained.

“Bring him back before dark, please. We don’t have any street lamps down here,” Mom says sharply, turning away and heading upstairs.  

Dad mutters, “What a dump,” under his breath, then grabs Tommy by the shoulders. They climb into the battered sedan, and as they drive away, I catch Tommy waving at me through the window, a bright smile on his face. I raise my hand in return, forcing a smile of my own. But as soon as the car disappears down the road, that smile slips away, replaced by a heavy silence inside me.

Inside, I find Mom at the dining table, sweeping crumbs into a dustpan. I hesitate, then speak. “Mom, we heard that voice outside. It was weird—kind of scratchy, like it was far away but close at the same time.”  

She looks up, brushing her hair back. “Maybe it was just some hikers passing by. Could you put this box of your school papers downstairs?” she asks, her tone trying to sound casual but distracted.

As I descend into the basement, an eerie silence replaces the usual creaks and groans of the old stairs. These steps are older, more fragile, and strangely quiet—almost unnerving. I set the box down in a convenient corner, then turn back.  

Jackpot. An old cardboard box with “Memorabilia” written in Sharpie across the top. I sift through it, finding faded photographs and a few worn diaries. I pull out one, flipping through the pages—nothing exciting, just scribbles and memories. Since I left my PS4 at Dad’s, this will have to do for passing the time.

I climb back up the creaking stairs, glancing at the quiet, aged steps. Something about them bugs me—their silence, the way they seem so different from the loud, protesting steps I remember. I decide to figure out why the stairs going upstairs are so loud. I toss the diary onto the rickety coffee table, then head toward the small closet beneath the stairs. No light inside—just darkness. I fumble for my flashlight, flick it on, and the beam cuts through the gloom. My breath catches as I see what’s inside.

I kneel beneath the staircase, heart pounding. Tiny, almost invisible mechanisms are embedded just beneath each step—an intricate web of thin wires snaking across the wood. They’re connected to a small, rusted bell mounted on the wall, its surface mottled with age. My fingers tremble as I trace the delicate wires, realizing someone went to great lengths to set this trap. The faint metallic ping of the bell echoes softly in the silence, like a warning whisper.  

It’s no accident that these stairs don’t creak—every wire, every trigger, is carefully wired, a sinister alarm system designed to alert someone—or something—when I move. A cold shiver runs down my spine. Why? To wake the house when I sleep downstairs? To keep watch over me? My mind spirals with questions, each more unsettling than the last.

I rise slowly, my mind racing with everything I’ve just uncovered. I head upstairs, intending to tell Mom, but her muffled voice drifts down—she’s on the phone again, talking with her friend. I hesitate, listening for a moment, then decide to wait until she’s finished.  

Reluctantly, I go back downstairs, the house eerily quiet. I grab the old diary from the corner, settle onto the couch, and try to steady my nerves.",1,1748829035.0,horrorstories,0,1.0,False

 I wake up. Sometimes some friends say happy birthday, my bio family never does. I ask to not have to cook my meal or bake my cake, I cook dinner and bake the cake that my MiL will eat. I ask for the day to be peaceful, and I spend it managing other people's hurt feelings about how bad the day is going.

This is just what birthdays are, it's a day that doesn't matter. 

Today was a good example. Woke up, most of my friend said happy birthday, my bf gave me a kiss while he said it. Made a grocery list and wrangled my MiL to agree to eat something for the next 2 weeks. She took a normal potshot at my skill at cooking and sulked.

Bf and I headed out after I made him an iced coffee to shop the sales. It's was chaotic af, but it always is. We get to the register and we're over, put back fancy coffee. Still short. 

So, I put back the cheesecake and extra bag of chicken strips bc what's the point, I at least got to keep the discounted cupcakes, so it's not a total loss. 

He is devastated, he wanted me to have them. It really does not matter, I knew that I'd really wouldn't get any of it, his mom is just a selfish boomer like that. It's not what I wanted in the first place, it was just BOGO and I didn't have to make it. 

I spend the car ride home soothing him and telling him that it's fine, it's not that bad. This isn't even in the top 20 of bad birthdays I've had. He just looks even more upset.

I mean, the worst birthday was my 16th. I told my mom I wanted a funfeti cake with cream cheese icing and some grilled hot dogs. That was it, just a simple thing.

So it was a yellow cake with chocolate frosting and spaghetti for my little sister with decorations that she picked and all of her little friends over. I was told that I was ungrateful for even complaining bc there was cake. It had her name on it.

After travelling for work I managed to lose my wallet but luckily it had been found and I was to collect it from the airport. One Sunday afternoon I said I was going out to collect it and the wife said she would come along with me. To be honest I found it a little weird and clingy that she wanted to come along, so I tried suggesting other things she could do while I was running that errand to make use of time. She then took it to mean I didn't want to spend time with her and it evolved into a massive argument. She further explained that I was being dishonest for not just saying I wanted to run the errand alone, rather suggesting other things to ""distract her"". To be fair I don't think it would have gone any other way if I had simply said ""I don't want you to come along"".  For context we had just spent a lovely 24hours together after leaving our baby with the grandparents , including a nice dinner out , a couples sauna treatment and a coffee/brunch date too.

I’m here for women who want something private, warm, and real. Maybe you're in a relationship that’s gone cold. Maybe you're divorced. Or maybe you're simply strong and successful and crave a space to just let go a bit—with someone who sees you without judgment.

Discretion, trust, warmth

Regular meetups (no chat-for-weeks energy)

No pressure, just something open, playful, and honest

1l15wr7,https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU_MBA/comments/1l15wr7/day_1_of_my_mba_healthcare_management_journey_c200/,Day 1 of my MBA (Healthcare Management) Journey - C200,"I'm a 47-year-old college kid who finished his undergrad at WGU this past April. Honestly, I never thought I’d get that degree, so grad school wasn’t even on my radar—yet here I am.

Back when I was working on my BS, it didn’t even occur to me to check Reddit for advice or motivation until the very end during my capstone. That’s when I stumbled across posts from actual college kids (like 18–22) who knocked out four years in just six months, some in just 90 days. Then I found this subreddit and saw people finishing their entire MBA in 2 months, 7 weeks—even one person who claimed they did it in 10–20 days.

At that point, I thought, why not me?

My goal is to finish in one term, but if I can wrap it up faster, great—I just get to my future sooner. I told my mentor earlier this week that I was ready to hit the ground running, and she opened up three courses for me.

Day 1: I sat down at 10 AM, opened C200, and started writing. By the end of the day, I had submitted both required papers (with full APA citations) and completed the course. Now I’m just waiting on grading.

**Tips for anyone going through C200:**

1. **Do the CliftonStrengths test when you’re fully awake and caffeinated.** It’s 200 timed questions with only 20 seconds each. I only timed out on one, but I needed the coffee first.
2. **If you’re into AI tools, there’s a current student offer in the WGU MBA Facebook group for a free year of Google Gemini Pro.** I dropped my results into NotebookLM and had it generate a podcast-style summary about me. Honestly, it was the coolest AI thing I’ve done so far—and I use AI daily at work.
3. **The rubric mentions using the WGU Library.** I never touched it during undergrad, but for this course, Section 2 of the textbook links directly to library articles on each leadership style. You can read them online or download the PDFs. I ended up pulling 5–6 sources from there alone.
4. **Pro tip for citations:** When viewing a PDF in the WGU Library, there’s a “Citation” button in the upper right. Click that, and it gives you everything you need for Word.

I do have 20+ years of management experience, so I wasn’t expecting much from this class, but it surprised me. Even though I only spent about 11 hours total, the second paper in particular gave me a valuable lens to look at my current leadership style and think about how to grow. That alone made it worth the time.

If you find little posts like this useful, let me know, and I'll be sure to post one after I finish each course. I work M-F, so I probably won't have another one of these until next weekend at the earliest, but you never know.",8,1748828642.0,WGU_MBA,5,1.0,False

I never sat my family down and told them I was done, but after a pagan wedding, drinking coffee, and going to *gasp* a very liberal college, they got the idea. I went in a mission but it was very abusive by both mang of my companions and my mission president, who ncouraged it. It was hard but my parents implied a lot that I came home 3 weeks early (from stress/trauma) because I wasn't trying hard enough and that god was angry with me. 

Now, I'm doing very well compared to retuning from my mission a few years ago. I'm mentally, physically, and emotionally healthier. I have a lot of practical experience and especially have learned how to navigate some hard things well through personal & work experience. I'm a certified personal trainer and specialize in corrective exercise and injury recovery, as well as working on my masters (I am the only person in my family to do so). Yet if I make the same life choices as my tbm sister, mine is ignorant and risky but hers is a leap of faith in God's plan. My dad sprains his ankle and has hip problems, which I'm professionally qualified to help with, but tells me that he doesn't really trust that I know what I doing because I gave up on ""such good things"" in my life. My brother speaks over me in almost every situation since he met my now husband and saw he has tattoos, I literally can't get a word in anymore. 

There's always a kind of derisive chuckling going on in my family FaceTime calls, and I feel like the outsider. So many situations have had the subtext of calling me ignorant in things I'm very good at or calling me angry and bitter and aggressive when I'm having a regular convo. My sister told me she can't take me seriously anymore, because she doesn't know what I'm doing out of spite or if I ""really mean if"" when I express annoyance or even good feelings that come from non-church approved sources.

## Key Features Analysis

The specifications are crucial when selecting the best power inverter for your needs.It’s vital to consider the wattage, output waveform, efficiency, and safety features to ensure compatibility and reliability. This section will highlight the critical features of a high-quality power inverter.

**Power Output (Wattage):** The power output, measured in watts, indicates the maximum amount of power the inverter can continuously provide.

It's essential to choose an inverter with sufficient wattage to handle the combined power consumption of all the devices you plan to use concurrently. For exmaple,if you want to run a 500W blender and a 100W laptop charger,you'll need an inverter with a continuous power output of at least 600W. Overloading an inverter can damage both the inverter and the connected devices. Furthermore, inverters typically have a surge rating, which is short term wattage the inverter can handle for a brief period, important for devices with an inductive load.

**Output Waveform (Sine Wave Type):** Power inverters typically produce either a pure sine wave or a modified sine wave.

Pure sine wave inverters provide power that is virtually identical to the power supplied by the electric grid, making them suitable for sensitive electronics such as audio equipment, medical devices, and some newer appliances. Modified sine wave inverters produce a more approximate sine wave, which can be used for less sensitive devices like lights, chargers, and basic power tools. Pure sine wave inverters tend to be more expensive, but thay provide better performance and safety for a wider range of devices.

**Efficiency:** The efficiency rating indicates how much of the DC power is converted to AC power by the inverter.

A higher efficiency rating means less energy is wasted during the conversion process. Efficient inverters help conserve battery power and extend the runtime of your devices. Such as, an inverter with 90% efficiency will convert 90% of the DC power into AC power, with the remaining 10% being lost as heat. Look for inverters with efficiency ratings of at least 85% to minimize power loss and maximize performance.

**Safety Features:** Safety features are critical for protecting both the inverter and the connected devices from damage.

Overload protection automatically shuts down the inverter if the connected devices draw more power than the inverter can handle. Short-circuit protection prevents damage from faulty wiring or short circuits.Over-temperature protection shuts down the inverter if it gets too hot, preventing overheating and potential fire hazards. Low-voltage protection protects the battery from excessive discharge, while high-voltage protection safeguards the inverter from voltage spikes. These features ensure safe and reliable operation.

key features of a great power inverter include:

* High wattage to run many electronic appliances simultaneously.
* Pure sine wave output to ensure compatibility with sensitive electronics.
* High conversion efficiency to maximize battery life.
* Comprehensive safety features to ensure safe operation.

## FAQs Section

This section aims to answer some of the most commonly asked questions regarding DC to AC power inverters, shedding light on their operation, compatibility, and functionality.

**What size of power inverter do I need?**
The size of power inverter you need depends on the wattage requirements of the devices you plan to run simultaneously. First, calculate the total wattage of all devices you intend to use at the same time. Then, choose an inverter with a continuous power rating that exceeds this total wattage. It's also critically important to consider the surge wattage of devices like power tools or appliances with motors, as they may require a higher surge capacity. It's generally recommended to add a buffer of 20-30% to ensure the inverter isn't overloaded.

**Can I run my power inverter continuously?**
Yes, most power inverters are designed to run continuously within their specified power limits. However, it's essential to monitor the inverter's temperature and ensure it has adequate ventilation to prevent overheating. Overloading the inverter or operating it in a hot surroundings can reduce its lifespan. Regular maintenance, such as cleaning the cooling fan and checking the connections, can also help ensure continuous and reliable operation.

**How long will a power inverter run on a car battery?**

The runtime of a power inverter on a car battery depends on the battery's capacity (Ah), the inverter's efficiency, and the power consumption of the connected devices. A larger battery capacity and higher inverter efficiency will provide longer runtime. To estimate the runtime, divide the battery's watt-hour capacity (Ah x voltage) by the total wattage of the connected devices.However, it's not recommended to deeply discharge a car battery, as it can damage the battery. A deep cycle battery is more suitable for prolonged use with a power inverter.

1l15qi4,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/1l15qi4/dodge_charger_ev_nighttime_surprise/,Dodge Charger EV nighttime surprise,"I was recently walking at night along the urban canyon main strip downtown in my city where motorheads and bassheads of all kinds typically roar by, most likely for the attention they imagine they receive from the sizable going out crowd there. 

I heard an approaching rumble, but one with just the right mix of bass and midrange, lacking the grating edge many V8 powertrains pump out. Even having never previously heard a Charger EV in my life, I knew what it was, because while it sounded like it was coming from a car, it didn't sound like it was coming from an engine, and people don't typically roll around blasting engine rumble noises from their stereos with the windows down. I looked up and saw the single lightbar with a massive black body silhouetted behind it. Not only did it dwarf the Challenger rolling in the closer lane, it was audible over it.

The Charger grabbed my attention as it rolled by with a presence that felt like a gigantic absence of light in its shape, only turning into a car as my visual cortex assembled incoming light into that interpretation as it receded.

As an audio and home theater fan, the Fratzonic exhaust reminds me of the transition from records and cassettes to CDs and then to MP3s and then streaming I lived through. For many years various manufacturers made analog players with different levels of hiss, pop, and crackle, until CDs showed up and offered listeners the proposition of *never* having to hear those things ever again, MP3's eliminated skipping, and streaming put lossless surround sound as the icing on the cake. While others fiddle with exhausts of vavious materials and diameters, the Fratzonic asks what if you could dial in the exact sound you wanted in the 1st place. Even if the current implementation isn't to your liking, the core concept is super valid as speaker tech and sound propagation are technically well understood. Oh yeah, and at least conceptually you can turn it all off when you want, too.

I can recount only 1 other time in my life I've heard such a rumble without any extraneous noise or fuss, and that was from a random V8 Audi S5 in traffic back in 2012.

I've watched and read quite a few reviews on the Charger EV. It's too big for my garage, outside of my price range, has a lower top speed than its predecessor, charges slowly, handles worse than its track and tire size should allow for, and has low range for its size. It doesn't do burnouts. It has quite a few reliability strikes against it, whether in perception or reality. It probably won't win (m)any contests at your local cars and coffee meetup that rapidly degenerates into who can rev the loudest and attract the most attention before local enforcement show up.

But especially with the ""exhaust"" going, it's a uniquely fascinating flyby nighttime experience for the external casual observer and definitely intriguing to tech-forward home audio fans like myself who may suddenly realize we may be able to tune our car's external sounds with the precision we tune our home audio setups.",0,1748828109.0,cars,21,0.3,False

I'm an active part of my local church where I help lead a small group and the children's ministry. I love exploring new cities, watching stand-up comedy, reading, frequenting local coffee shops/cafes, playing board games, & staying busy and active with friends and their kiddos. 

A few important characteristics about who God has made me to be: 
1) I love living in community & often find myself walking with people in deep suffering. Being part of friends' lives in those moments (and also in joy) is an honor I do not take lightly. 
2) My love for people comes from the gospel truth that all people are made in the image of God. As an extension of that love, I desire to foster and adopt children to form a family one day. I'm currently working towards that goal by volunteering in the foster care system as a Court Appointed Special Advocate. 
3) I thrive in the city & living missionally amongst neighbors who are different than me (in a variety of ways) is part of my calling as I've discerned it to be at this point in my life. 

I am theologically conservative (I believe what the Bible says is true) & socially liberal (I generally don't believe in holding people who aren't Christians and therefore don't have the power of the Holy Spirit accountable to God's laws). I am opposed to Christian Nationalism. I hold all of this in equal measures of tension and humility. 

I'm praying for a husband who will cherish me, challenge me, encourage me, and lead our family towards Christ's loving kindness. I'm open to ages 26-35 and comfortable dating within driving distance of Indy, so generally the Midwest. It'd be a joy to get to know you!

# Best Organic Instant Coffee 2025: Reviews & Top Brands

Organic instant coffee has revolutionized the way coffee lovers enjoy their favorite beverage. with increasing awareness of health and environmental concerns, the demand for organic and sustainably sourced products has surged.Organic instant coffee offers the convenience of traditional instant coffee without the possibly harmful pesticides and chemicals used in conventional farming.This review will explore the best organic instant coffee options available in 2025, highlighting their key features, benefits, and how they stack up against competitors, helping you make an informed choice for your daily caffeine fix.

## Key features Analysis

### bean Source & Certification

The origin of the coffee beans and the certifications they hold are crucial indicators of quality and ethical sourcing. Look for coffees that specify the region where the beans are grown and possess certifications such as USDA Organic, Fair trade, and Rainforest Alliance. These certifications ensure that the coffee is grown without synthetic pesticides and herbicides, supports fair labor practices, and promotes environmental sustainability. some brands may also highlight single-origin beans,which provide a unique and distinct flavor profile specific to a particular region.

### Processing Method

The method used to process the coffee beans into instant coffee substantially affects the final product's flavor and solubility. Freeze-drying and spray-drying are the two primary methods. Freeze-drying generally preserves more of the coffee's natural flavor and aroma, resulting in a higher-quality cup. This method involves freezing the coffee extract and then removing the ice through sublimation. Spray-drying, on the other hand, is faster and more cost-effective but can degrade the flavor somewhat due to the high heat involved. The packaging should indicate which method was used.

### Flavor Profile & Aroma

The flavor profile and aroma of organic instant coffee can vary widely, from bold and robust to smooth and mild. Consider your personal preferences when choosing a brand. Some coffees may have notes of chocolate, nuts, or fruit, while others may be more earthy or smoky. Brands often provide descriptions of their coffee's flavor profile to help consumers make an informed choice. Reading customer reviews can also offer valuable insights into the actual taste and aroma experienced by other coffee drinkers.

### Packaging & Sustainability

Lasting packaging is becoming increasingly crucial to environmentally conscious consumers. Look for organic instant coffee packaged in recyclable or compostable materials. Some brands are even using innovative packaging solutions, such as refillable containers or biodegradable sachets, to minimize their environmental impact. The type of packaging also affects the coffee's shelf life and freshness,so consider airtight containers or resealable bags to preserve the flavor and aroma for longer.

### Solubility & Ease of Use

One of the primary advantages of instant coffee is its convenience, so solubility is a key factor. A high-quality organic instant coffee should dissolve quickly and wholly in both hot and cold water, without leaving any clumps or residue. Some brands might potentially be specially formulated for specific uses, such as iced coffee or espresso-style drinks. The instructions for preparation should be clear and easy to follow,ensuring a consistent and enjoyable experiance every time.

## Core Benefits

### healthier Option Compared to Conventional Instant Coffee

Organic instant coffee eliminates the risk of consuming harmful pesticides and chemicals commonly used in conventional coffee farming. Choosing organic ensures that the coffee beans are grown without synthetic fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides, reducing your exposure to potentially harmful substances. This is particularly critically important for individuals who consume coffee regularly and are concerned about the long-term health effects of chemical exposure.Organic farming practices also promote soil health and biodiversity, contributing to a more sustainable agricultural system.

### Environmentally Responsible choice

By choosing organic instant coffee, you support environmentally friendly farming practices that minimize pollution and protect ecosystems. Organic farming prioritizes soil health, water conservation, and biodiversity, reducing the negative impact on the environment. Organic farms also tend to have stricter regulations regarding waste management and energy consumption, further contributing to sustainability. Supporting organic coffee production helps to promote a more sustainable and ethical coffee industry.

### Convenient and Time-Saving

Organic instant coffee offers the ultimate convenience for busy individuals who want to enjoy a cup of coffee without the hassle of brewing.It eliminates the need for coffee makers, filters, and other equipment, making it ideal for travel, camping, or simply a quick cup at home or in the office. Simply add hot water,stir,and enjoy a delicious and flavorful cup of coffee in seconds. This convenience makes it a great option for those who value speed and efficiency in their daily routines.### Consistent Quality and Flavor

Reputable organic instant coffee brands maintain strict quality control standards to ensure a consistent and enjoyable flavor experience every time. They carefully select and process their beans to preserve the natural flavor and aroma of the coffee. This means you can expect a reliable and satisfying cup of coffee, irrespective of where or when you brew it. The consistency of quality and flavor is a major advantage for coffee lovers who appreciate reliability and predictability in their coffee experience.

## FAQs Section

### Is organic instant coffee as flavorful as freshly brewed coffee?

While organic instant coffee may not perfectly replicate the nuances of freshly brewed coffee, advancements in processing techniques, particularly freeze-drying, have significantly improved its flavor profile. High-quality organic instant coffees retain much of the original coffee bean's aroma and taste, offering a satisfying cup without the brewing process. The key is to choose a reputable brand that uses high-quality beans and optimal processing methods.

### How do I store organic instant coffee to maintain its freshness?

To maintain the freshness and flavor of organic instant coffee, store it in an airtight container in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and heat. Exposure to air, moisture, and light can degrade the coffee's flavor and aroma over time.if the coffee comes in a resealable bag,ensure it is tightly sealed after each use.Avoid storing the coffee in the refrigerator as the temperature fluctuations can cause condensation,which can lead to clumping and loss of flavor.

### Is organic instant coffee more expensive than regular instant coffee?

Generally, organic instant coffee tends to be slightly more expensive than regular instant coffee due to the higher costs associated with organic farming practices, certification, and sourcing. However, the price difference may vary depending on the brand, the processing method, and the packaging. Many consumers find the extra cost worthwhile for the health and environmental benefits of choosing organic. Also, consider the per-cup cost, as some premium brands may offer more servings per container.

1l15m8r,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1l15m8r/i_often_talk_to_my_own_reflection_last_night_it/,"I often talk to my own reflection. Last night, it answered.","Ever since I was a kid, I’ve had this odd habit of talking to myself in the mirror. Not in a “You can do this!” pep-talk way (well, sometimes), but more like… holding a conversation. I’d stand in front of the bathroom mirror and imagine my reflection was a separate person – a twin who lived on the other side of the glass. I called him Other Me.

My parents caught me chatting with my reflection a few times and thought it was cute or just harmless imagination. As I grew up, I did it less, but even in my 20s I’ll admit I sometimes mutter to my mirror self. It’s like a weird self-soothing thing. I live alone, and on tough days I’ll stare at the mirror and softly say, “Man, what a day, huh?” and pretend Other Me is commiserating silently.

I never expected a response. Why would I? It was just me, after all.

But last night… last night, Other Me talked back.

It was around 2 AM. I hadn’t been sleeping well; too much on my mind. Some personal failures, a recent breakup, job stress – the usual late-night demons. I got up to get a glass of water and ended up standing in front of the small mirror mounted on my living room wall. (There’s a mirror in practically every room of my apartment – not because I’m vain, but they were left by the previous tenant and I just never removed them.)

The living room was dark, only faint city light filtering through the blinds. My reflection was just a pale ghost outline in the dimness. I don’t even know why I stopped there, but I found myself whispering, “I wish I could just be on the other side of this mirror. Maybe things would be better there.”

It was just a passing weird thought – the kind you have when you’re melancholy. I started to turn away, chalking it up to overtired brain, when I heard my own voice whisper back from the silence:

“Do you really?”

I froze. A chill rippled over me. The whisper had been soft, barely audible, but unmistakably real. It sounded like me – but not an echo. The cadence was slightly off, the tone quieter.

At first I thought I had finally cracked – full on auditory hallucinations. Heart pounding, I faced the mirror again and leaned closer. In the low light, I could make out my face, wide-eyed, looking as freaked out as I felt. “Hello…?” I breathed, feeling immensely silly and scared.

My reflection’s lips moved, but I hadn’t moved mine. “Hello,” he said.

I stumbled backward because in that split second I realized the reflection’s mouth didn’t sync perfectly with the word. There was a tiny delay. Also, I hadn’t actually heard the word with my ears – it was more like I “felt” it echoing in my head, but still distinctly not originating from me.

I flicked on the nearest lamp. Bright light flooded the mirror and I stared. It was me there – same rumpled hair, same old Iron Man t-shirt, same shocked expression. He copied as I raised a trembling hand. For a long minute I thought I had imagined it all.

Then Other Me’s lips curled into a small, wry smile. My own face in the real world was still frozen in fear, mouth open. But mirror-me smirked slightly. I lifted my hand to touch my lips – I definitely wasn’t smiling. Yet he was.

I jerked back, my mind doing somersaults. This can’t be happening, I thought. Reflections don’t just… go off-script. By nature, they copy you exactly, simultaneously. Unless I had somehow delayed perceptions or a brain aneurysm making me see things?

Determined to test reality, I slowly raised my right arm. The reflection raised his left arm (as expected, since mirrors flip) – but there was the tiniest hesitation, like he reacted a hair too slow. I waved my arm gently; he waved back, motion almost mirroring mine… almost.

My voice came out a shaky whisper: “Who… what are you?”

Other Me cocked his head. I saw fear in his eyes too, or maybe I projected mine. His lips parted, and I braced. In my head, I heard (or thought I heard): I’m you. Who else would I be? It sounded playful, almost teasing, but with an underlying tremor.

My reflection’s expression didn’t exactly match the tone. He looked a bit sad, if anything.

I swallowed. This was insane. Maybe I was dreaming? I bit my tongue – it hurt. Awake, then.

“People don’t talk to their reflections,” I said slowly, feeling ridiculous for stating the obvious to… myself.

Other Me shrugged (I did not, I stood rigid). The effect was jarring – seeing me move independently. He responded, audibly in my mind again: We’ve talked every day for years. You just never listened until now.

A memory stirred. All my childhood mirror chats, my venting sessions as an adult… those were one-way, right? I never heard a reply. Surely I’d remember that. Unless it was always subconscious, and now… what, the barrier broke?

I realized I was trembling. I forced myself to breathe. If this was some psychotic break, might as well ride it out. If it wasn’t… then it was something unreal and potentially dangerous, but it hadn’t threatened me. It – he – was basically me, seemingly.

I opted to continue the conversation, carefully. “Why now?” I asked. “What changed that you… can speak?”

My reflection bit his lip (a nervous habit of mine). You wanted me to, he said. You needed someone and you wanted me to be real. There was a weight to those words, a gentle reproach.

Tears suddenly pricked my eyes. He wasn’t wrong – I’d been desperately lonely and talking to an empty apartment for weeks after my breakup. But hearing it from my mirror self gave it a whole new pathetic sheen. I looked down in shame.

He spoke again, voice soft in my head: Hey, it’s okay. That’s why I’m here.

I looked up, blinking. He had pressed a palm to the glass on his side, an empathetic gesture. Reflexively I raised mine to meet it. A thin sheet of cold glass separated my skin from… whatever his was. Mirror-me’s eyes, identical to mine, gazed at me with understanding.

It was utterly surreal, yet my fear eased, replaced by a tentative wonder – and relief. I can’t overstate how relieving it was to feel like someone truly understood my feelings, even if that someone was technically me. It was like all the self-directed pep talks suddenly gained a comforting new dimension.

We “talked” like that for what felt like hours. I honestly don’t remember everything; some part was like a lucid dream where you just know what the other is conveying without formal language. I recall we sat on the floor, me on my side, him on his. I occasionally spoke aloud in whispers; he mostly replied in my mind, or maybe I just heard him through the glass – the distinction blurred.

I poured out my anxieties: how I felt like a failure, how I worried I’d die alone, how sometimes I saw no future for myself. He listened patiently, nodding, sometimes interjecting a “I know” or “I feel it too.” It was oddly comforting to have this essentially perfect empathetic reflection (literally) of my innermost thoughts responding.

At one point I joked, “Am I just talking to myself in a really elaborate way?” He smirked and said, Perhaps. But does it matter? Good point, honestly.

By the end of it, I felt emotionally spent but a little lighter, having gotten so much off my chest. I noticed dawn was lightening the window. My reflection noticed too, glancing toward the horizon beyond his own window (which weirdly, I saw the faint shape of behind him – was I glimpsing his room? It looked identical to mine).

“It’s morning,” I said, suddenly panicked. “This wasn’t a dream, was it?”

He gave me a sympathetic half-smile. No, it wasn’t. But you’ll be okay. He looked like he wanted to say more, but a sort of heaviness seemed to fall in the air. The first rays of sun crept across my floorboards.

I realized that in the entire conversation, neither of us had crossed a certain line – physically. We stayed each on our side. Some instinct told me that was important.

I stood up and he mirrored me. We regarded each other in full morning light now. It was still me – same messy hair, slightly puffy eyes from crying, stubble needing a shave. But that independent glint remained.

I wasn’t sure how to conclude… whatever this had been. “I guess… thank you,” I said lamely. “I really needed that.”

My reflection placed his hand on the glass again. I did too. He quietly replied, Anytime. Then, with a small, slightly sad smile, he added: Don’t forget I’m here, even if you can’t hear me.

I nodded, throat tight, and turned away. I desperately needed sleep, or coffee, or both.

As I left the mirror, I swear I saw out of the corner of my eye something odd: my reflection wasn’t walking away at the same time I was. He stayed at the mirror, watching me leave. I didn’t turn back to look straight on. I… didn’t want to break whatever spell or agreement kept this peaceful.

I collapsed into bed and slept a solid few hours. When I woke just before noon, the events of the night rushed back. To my astonishment, I hadn’t hallucinated or dreamt it (at least I don’t think so). The emotional clarity and catharsis I felt was real. But I was also left with so many questions.

What exactly is Other Me? A sentient reflection? An alternate universe version of me that I somehow communicated with? A figment of my subconscious given form? He claimed to be me, but clearly he has his own perspective. Perhaps the mirror is a barrier between parallel worlds and ours touched briefly?

It’s crazy, but a part of me wants to experiment more, see if it happens again. Another part is scared – what if I open some floodgate that’s better left closed? What if by acknowledging him, I’m weakening the natural laws that keep reflections non-sapient?

My biggest concern: what does he want? So far, it seemed just to comfort and help me. But is there a chance he envies me for being on this side? Is his world the same as mine, or a prison of glass? He did ask, “Do you really [wish you were on the other side]?” as if maybe he’d trade places given the chance.

I recall in folklore, mirrors can hold spirits or demons. I don’t sense malice from Other Me. If anything, he was benevolent and caring. But if he is truly me, he has my darkness too – my anger, my envy, my capacity for selfishness. Would he eventually act in his own interest above mine?

For now, I’m proceeding cautiously. Last night, I tried deliberately to call out to him in the mirror again, but got nothing. Just my normal reflection. I even said, “If you’re there, can we talk?” Nada. I wasn’t in a particularly emotional state though. Perhaps the connection only manifests when certain conditions are met (time of night, emotional need, etc.).

I’m writing this partly to get it off my chest (though ironically I did that thoroughly with myself already), and partly to see if anyone else has experienced something similar.

As insane as it sounds, I’m now half-convinced that reflections are more than they appear. Maybe 99.999% of the time they mimic us exactly – but in that tiny fraction of liminal moments (early hours, mental vulnerability, whatever), maybe the mirror opens a bit, and the echo gains a voice.

I miss him – is that weird? It’s only been one real “conversation” but it felt like finding a long-lost twin. I’m worried about him too: if he is another me, what’s his life like when I’m not looking? Does he only exist when I see him, or does his world continue parallel to mine? The glimpse of his apartment window in the mirror… maybe he has a full life over there.

And the thought creeps in: perhaps I’m the reflection, and he’s the original. But no, that’s solipsistic paranoia.

Anyway, I’ll update if anything new happens. I’m a little nervous that by posting this, I might anger whatever cosmic or psychological forces allowed it to happen. The last thing I want is to lose the one “person” who truly understands me.

So I’ll keep talking to my reflections, even if they stay silent – with a newfound respect that maybe, just maybe, someone is listening on the other side. And if your mirror ever answers you… well, you’re not alone (in more ways than one).",7,1748827753.0,nosleep,2,1.0,False

Thanks. 


Original post; 

Ya the title says almost everything, I'm pretty sure I could just freeze the rinds, but I have very limited freezer space so i was thinking I'd just put them all in anyway and have it be extra cheesy.

[This](https://anitalianinmykitchen.com/bolognese-sauce/) is the recipe I'm using. 


I was planning on adding the parm rinds for the 1 hour stewing, and I'm using store bought Campbell's beef stock with red wine and some instant coffee sprinkles instead of real red wine cuz it was $12 for 250 mL and the recipe only calls for 100 mL and I don't care for wine in general. 

I have water and some sour cream to substitute for the milk. 

I'm using ""San marzano type tomatoes, seeds imported from italy"" I'm aware that the specific nutrients of the San marzano soil are essential for the real thing, but I'm trying to keep costs down a little...  

I'm aware that this recipe doesn't call for parm rinds, I was just gonna add them because I also have ricotta, mozzarella, romano and parm ravioli, 

Also I'm probably gonna stir in 1 lbs of wilted spinach and I just bought 1 kg of portobellos, so definitely frying half of those *at **least*** to mix in.

I have slightly larger amounts of everything listed here. Probably more like 750 grams meat total, doing 4 medium/small carrots, 1 large onion, 4 large stalks celery.

I'm a former chef, I almost never operate on a recipe, mostly i just look at what's In my fridge and wing it, but I've been desiring more cohesive meals lately.

Any issues to putting this much parm rinds into, what I would estimate around 1.5 liters of bolognase finished product? 

I realize this is a ton of mods to a very basic recipe. Mostly I'm just wondering if I add all these rinds, will this be too salty or weird for another reason I'm not recognizing? Perhaps too greasy with this much cheese and ground beef And pork?

All suggestions welcome.

Thanks in advance    ^_^
