Is there a name for this?","My best friend and I have been practically joined at the hip since we were kids. We're talking finish-each-other's-sentences, know-what-the-other-is-thinking-with-a-single-glance kind of close. Life happened, as it does, and now we live on opposite sides of the country, but that bond has always felt as strong as ever.

About a year ago, I was just going about my day—making coffee, answering emails, the usual boring stuff. Suddenly, out of absolutely nowhere, I was hit by this overwhelming wave of pure dread. It wasn't just a bad mood; it was a physical sensation, like the air was being sucked out of the room. My chest got tight, and I had this horrifying feeling of drowning, of just absolute, soul-crushing despair. It was so intense I had to sit down. The only thought in my head was, 'I have to call her. Right now.'

My hand was shaking as I dialed her number. She picked up on the second ring, and I could tell immediately she was crying. Before I could even ask what was wrong, she told me. Her mom, who had been sick but was thought to be stable, had passed away unexpectedly just moments before. The timing was exact. The wave of grief I'd felt wasn't mine—it was hers. I had felt the most painful moment of her life from a thousand miles away.

We've talked about it a lot since then, trying to make sense of it. It was both terrifying and strangely comforting to know our connection is that deep. It’s one thing to be emotionally in sync with someone, but another to physically feel their emotional state from a huge distance. It’s left me wondering, has anyone else experienced something like this? Is there a psychological term for this kind of intense empathy or connection?",1,1763576258.0,u_Leather-Buddy-7902,0,1.0,False

Some background info. I bought the house and decided to get roommates as it was becoming hard to pay the mortgage on my own. They have been renting from me for almost a year now.

I’m the only one cleaning anything, and I’m starting to feel like the exhausted mother of three fully grown adults. I don’t care how they keep their rooms, as long as weird smells aren’t spreading into the halls so that isn’t an issue. However, they don’t clean anything. Rarely, do they even clean up after themselves. They’ll leave food wrappers, crumbs, and food spills (not like full spills but like dried sauce spills) on the counters. Dirty dishes on the coffee table and dining table. We have a dishwasher but they just leave their dishes in the sink until I do it. I bought one of those “dirty/clean” signs for the dishwasher and left a note saying “when the sign says “dirty”, please put your dirty dishes in the dishwasher”, but they still leave them in the sink and the dishwasher is completely empty.

### 1. Parse the Odds: A Tale of Two Tired Teams

The **Washington Capitals** (-115) are slight favorites, but don’t let that fool you—they’re playing on fumes. Since November 12, they’ve played every other day, and their “balanced schedule” sounds like a dare. Their defense is decent (2.5 goals allowed per game), but their offense is only average (2.8 goals per game). Key players like Tom Wilson (18 points) and Dylan Strome (16 points) are their best hope, but Pierre-Luc Dubois’ absence (abdomen injury) leaves a hole in their attack.

The **Edmonton Oilers** (-105) are the underdog, and for good reason. Their defense is a sieve (3.5 goals allowed per game), and their goalie, Stuart Skinner, is statistically the NHL’s version of a sieve with a PhD in “I give up pucks.” Connor McDavid (30 points) and Leon Draisaitl (24 points) are elite, but injuries to Ryan Nugent-Hopkins and Kasperi Kapanen have left their attack depth looking like a deflated balloon.

**Key Statistic**: The combined average goals per game between these teams is **5.8**, just shy of the 6.0 total set by bookmakers. Fatigue and defensive lapses? That’s a recipe for a high-scoring, chaotic game.

### 2. Digest the News: Injuries, Fatigue, and the Curse of Back-to-Backs

* **Washington’s Woes**: The Capitals are playing their 5th game in 9 days. Their “balanced schedule” is a lie. Pierre-Luc Dubois is out, and their defense relies on Logan Thompson’s .924 save percentage to hold the line. Think of them as a leaky dam holding back a hurricane—eventually, water (goals) gets through.
* **Edmonton’s Exhaustion**: The Oilers are coming off a brutal stretch, including a 1-5 loss to Buffalo. Their “rebound” game? More like a rebound from a trampoline that forgot to bounce. With Ryan

1p1f8db,https://www.reddit.com/r/travelchina/comments/1p1f8db/25_days_in_china_an_absolute_horror_trip_and_what/,25 days in China: An absolute horror trip! And what I've learned.,"Hey.   
I just came back from a **3,5 weeks trip** from China last week.   
It was my first time in China, the longest and most expensive vacation I've ever done.  
And it was absolutely horrible - but that was not China's fault, I was just INSANELY unlucky.  
  
**Why it was horrible:**   
\- I was sick the first week with a sore throat and a cold, so was limited in what I could do.  
\- Out of 25 days, it was constantly raining (a lot!!!) and even a snowstorm on 22 days (I was constantly wet, had to throw away my shoes as they didn't survive never being completely dry throughout the entire trip and having wet feet when it's quite cold didn't really help recover from my cold ....) - is it ever sunny in China? .....  
\- In Jiuzhaigou it was so incredibly crowded - even for Chinese standards - I couldn't see the stairs properly slipped with my foot and injured it so from week 2 I couldn't walk properly ...  
\- And upon arriving at Shanghai airport (my last stop) I started throwing up the second I arrived at the airport hotel, was out cold for 2 days with a high fever and hotel staff wasn't very helpful in getting me some toast and bananas once the throwing up stopped, I almost starved to death as I couldn't leave the bed and was travelling alone, absolutely miserable ...

  
**Important take away:**  
A lot of the recent information I found on Reddit was not up-to-date anymore:  
  
\- It says you can visit **Tiananmen Square** on the same day of your Forbidden City ticket. This is not true. You need to get a separate reservation at least a day ahead to be able to visit Tiananmen Square, it has nothing to do with your visit to the Forbidden City. Consequently, I couldn't go, unforatunely.  
  
\- **Jinshanling Great Wall** section: is supposed to be less touristy. I can't confirm. I went during the week in mid-October and it was pretty crowded and loud there - still quite nice.  
  
\- **Crowds:**   
Yes, there are a lot of crowds, but not where I expected them.  
Here, I was told that especially **Tianmen Mt.** and **Zhangjiajie National Park** would be insanely crowded, but they weren't, at all...... and it was quite easy to navigate as there were a lot of foreign tourists and a lot of the signs were in English.

On the contrary, **Jiuzhaigou National Park** was the worst experience I've ever had in my life in terms of crowds. I should have known already when the highspeed train tickets sold out the second they were released on 12306...... I didn't see any other foreigners when I went there. I was at the park's entrance gate before opening time and yet had to line up with billions of people. It took at least 1h to get in, just to then line up for the shuttle busses. So much squeezing, pushing etc ... this is also when I finally injured my foot .....   
The nature there couldn't be enjoyed due to the massive crowds. At each viewpoint you had to line up for 20-30 minutes until you got close enough to even take a photo.   
Also, getting tickets for a shuttle bus back to the highspeed train station was also utterly difficult and they were booked out quite fast, had to opt for a more expensive option and the driver was an hour late etc. HORRIBLE!  
I would NOT recommend going there it's NOT worth it - there are similar sceneries in Europe or Canada etc. without entrance fees and crowds ....  
However, I would recommend going to Huanglong, it's easier, it's not as crowded and it's a truly special sight that you don't get anywhere else (apart from maybe Turkey).

**VPN / esim:**  
I had 2 phones on me. Both Pixel phones. Big mistake. I couldn't get my Pixel phone to connect to any WiFi not even with (**Mullvad**) VPN. I had a Xiaomi tablet with me that could connect to most WiFi with the VPN just fine ... I did try some of the tricks mentioned online for Pixel phones, but Google and China ... it just doesn't work. Also, walking into phone accessory shops, they have so much stuff but NOT for Pixel phones. Just be aware.  
With the esim I never had any issues. There were 2 times when I didn't have any reception for some time and that was near the Yangshuo Railway Station and between Huanglong Railways Station and Huanglong Scenic Spot. I opted for 50GB for 30 days, but ended up only using about 14GB for 25 days.

**Alipay / Wechat:**  
Mostly it worked for me. For payments I mostly used Alipay and only when it didn't work switched to Wechat. Sometimes when you have to scan something to pay it wouldn't work on either of them ... eventually they gave me something else to scan and then I could pay.  
**Didi didn't work properly** for me, so I had to take taxis instead on serveral occasions. The GPS within the app was completely off, so sometimes when I needed a pick-up, the pick-up location was so far off that I had to cancel the Didi (which costs a fee) and then had to find a taxi instead. I never figured out why the GPS was so off ... maybe because I have a Google phone? ... but that was extremely annoying especially when you were in a hurry ....  
I once had to **rent a powerbank** using the mini app in Alipay which is all in Chinese .. it worked, but I didn't know that I had to scan the code again after I had returned the powerbank. I found out hours later, but apparently you can just go to any other Meituan powerband station and scan the code there, luckily ... I just had to pay more because a few hours have passed ... AND I never got my deposit back. I found out that you have to actively demand the deposit back in the app - which I did and then it worked.

**Trains and subway:**  
I saw so many foreigners in front of ticket machines in the metro and never understood why. You can simply activate a metro card for most major cities within Alipay free of charge(!!) and then you just swipe the QR code and it automatically pays the travel fee. It saves so much time, why buy individual tickets and waste time?? It's easy to set up. Just navigate to the ""Transport"" tab and choose the city and you're good to go. In the beginning you might need some verification process.

For trains I mainly used **12306** although I have to admit that I had various issues with the app. First, I couldn't verify any of my e-mail addresses and then when I was already in China not all of my booked tickets were showing up (I had to use the website instead because you need to be able to access those if you want to change anything - which I had to do constantly...). Changing tickets in the app (given that it works) is super easy. Especially, if you just want to take a later train (same destination) you can do that without any additional cost (as long as tickets are not sold out). But you can change a ticket only ONCE. After that you can only cancel it and book a new one - and cancelling comes with a fee, esp. if it's 48-24h prior to your actual trip.  
Considering how often I changed or cancelled train tickets it would have been waaaaay to expensive to use Trip.com. I would only recommend doing that if you don't have too many train trips or you can't get the 12306 app to work.  
I found it sad that you cannot choose your seat in the English version. I always ended up in a coach furthest away and usually never got a window seat.  
As for, how early you should be there, it completely depends, really. I never had to wait long at security check, but for bigger stations it takes some time to get from A to B and then to find your ticket gate, to actually go there and for bigger train stations they often start 20-30 mins prior to departure with the ticket check while for smaller ones, they won't start until 10 mins before departure ... but it's always better to be there too early rather than too late.   
As a foreigner, you always have to use the ""manned"" ticket gate and on some ocassions there were SO MANY foreigners that we were about to delay the train as we couldn't all check in on time, so at some point they were just letting all the foreigners through without checking their passports.... ;) ..... 

**Food:**  
Well, I can't eat spicy, but have no other food restrictions. I ended up eating meat almost every day. Not always was the meat of good quality.. But most of the dishes were delicious. But I ended up with food poisoning and to this day I don't know what it was because when I started throwing up I hadn't eaten anything for 8h+ .... and I didn't have any street food on that day either.... (and no I didn't drink tab water...)  
They have some really interesting coffee variations there like with sparkling water, plums inside, mixed with orange juice ... but all of them were interesting and surprisingly delicious. 

**Language barrier:**  
Wow, this was huge! Much bigger than expected.   
I used to live in Japan for many years and worked there as an English teacher and we were always told that China and South Korea are far ahead when it comes to English education. Now, I know this was a lie. Uff ...  
I was expecting that at least people working in tourism in the big city would have some proficiency in English, but nope. They don't even know ""yes"" or ""no"".....   
As I was travelling alone, I was so happy when I met other foreigners, not matter from where because naturally they all could speak English - mind you my native language isn't English either .... so it was nice to have a proper conversation without any phone translation.   
That being said I still had some nice conversations with locals, taxi drivers etc. but it was all via the phone translator which felt a bit weird. :)  
Being fluent in Japanese, I could understand some of the Chinese characters of course, but in terms of conversations this doesn't help at all. And oh boy, do they hate the Japanese! I saw some food stalls with text like ""Japanese are not welcome"". Uff .....  
But I met a few Japanese tourists and at certain tourist spots they had explanation signs in Korean and Japanese, sometimes even Russian, so ....

**Safety:**  
Female solo traveller. Just like in Japan, I felt absolutely safe in China and I knew it wouldn't be an issue. Crossing streets was probably the most dangerous thing because zebra corssings and red lights won't stop them from overrunning you. Haha ....   
Also, I felt the air quality was much better than I thought it would be.   
I probably wouldn't recommend going to China and to AAAAA-ranked spots when you're pregnant because of all the squeezing and pushing it might be a bit dangerous for the unborn child ... I myself got quite a few bruises through that, so ....  
And I never understood why they're doing it. They were walking super slow the entire time, so obviously they'e not in a hurry, but as soon as it was about to board a shuttle bus (coming every 2 mins), they were pushing and shoving around as if their life depends on it because they couldn't wait for the next bus.   
  
**Noise:**  
There was not much traffic noise because of the many electric cars, but it was still super loud because they honk constantly. Also, I feel that Chinese people have not understood the concept of headphones. In trains or subways, nobody seems to use them, they all just have their phones on max volume while watching videos etc. It's always super loud. And needless to say, that they're speaking very loudly wherever they are, so my ears are still ringing from all the noise. ;)

**About the places I've visited:**  


**Beijing:** (3 days, see above)  
  
**Datong: (2 days)**  
I really liked it there. For me, the Hanging Temple was totally worth the trip. I've never seen anything like it.  
Datong City was also impressive. All the new skyscrapers and then the old ancient city center within the city walls. I quite liked it, although again it was raining heavily on my second day there, so I couldn't explore much .... the grottoes and the wooden pagoda are also a must-see.  
I had a private driver for day 1 where I visited the pagoda and the hanging temple and it wasn't super expensive, I think I paid like 500yuan.

**Xi'an (2 days).**  
Apart from the famous army I didn't see anything else because of torrential rain and flooding when I was there. Every other day before and after that - still to this very day was absolutely lovely, sunny and great .... how much bad luck can you actually have? ... I stayed there 2 days and those were the ONLY two days with horrible weather ...

**Chengdu Pandas: (1 day)**  
As I was there on a weekend I decided not to go to the huge base close to the city center, but to the Dujingyuan panda valley which only has around 10 giant pandas. But I'd rather see 10 of them close-up without too many people vs. not being able to see 100+ pandas due to the masses. Pandas were still active and eating at around 10:30, I entered the park shortly after 8:30. The only difference is that in the beginning I almost had the pandas to myself and the later it got, the more crowded it became. And yes, they also have red pandas roaming around freely. :)  
Also, the Dujingyuan Irrigation System and Ancient Town are very beautiful, you can do that and the panda valley in one day and the waterway is lit up in the evening, so you might want to stay until it gets dark. :)

**Leshan Buddha (1 day):**  
Friends of mine visited just a few days before me and told me as it's dry season the water levels are so low that no tourists boats are running anymore. Due to the constant heavy rain wherever I went, I was at least ""lucky"" that the water levels were suddenly so high that tourists boats were running again ... I did both, the hike and the boat tour and it was not rushed at all. Unfortunately you couldn't walk down beside the Buddha as the trail was closed off ....

**Huanglong and Jiuzhaigou (2 days, see above)**

**Fenghuang and Furong (0,5 days each):**  
I liked both, but if I had to decide on only one I'd personally go with Furong. It's more compact, it's more picturesque and I just liked the waterfall a lot. :) But you can't go wrong with either of them. Didis and taxis were no problem at all, although Reddit tells you a different story... Especially in Furong they're VERY used to foreign tourists! They even hand you a map in English right when you leave the train station. Fool-proof.  
For either of them half a day is enough. You should stay until the evening when they light up everything, it's quite nice and there are night performances as well. It was a bit hard as it was raining a lot (as everywhere I went...), but still nice ....  
It was not a problem to leave my luggage at Fenghuang Railway Sta. for a small fee (I think it was 20 yuan), I think it was also possible in Furong.

**Zhangjiajie (1 day):**  
Mt. Tianmen was supposed to be the absolute highlight of this trip (besides the Great Wall). Unfortunately, although I went in the early morning and stayed until sunset, I couldn't see anything. It was so cloudy / foggy the entire day and never cleared up. In fact, it was scary because you couldn't see more than 5m ahead of you. I chose route B and when I arrived at the platform from where you can see the stairs and the heaven's gate, I just heard people's voices, but I didn't know where to go, I tried to find a restaurant or something to sit to wait for it to clear up, but unless you were standing RIGHT in front of it, you couldn't see shit .... I'm so, so disappointed. Consequently, it wasn't crowded at all ...

**Zhangjiajie National Park (2 days):** It was not crowded. Yes, of course, there were a lot of people but nothing compared to Jiuzhaigou .... I was there on a Friday and a Saturday. I spent 2 days in the park itself. Not sure if you really need 2 days, because the views become somewhat redundant to be honest. But I didn't have the energy to go to the Grand Canyon due to all the bad luck, the foot injury, the constant rain ....   
I managed to see Yuanjiajie, Yangjiajie and Mt. Tianzi on day 1 without being rushed at all (plus a few viewpoints that are between Yangjiajie and Mt. Tianzi (get off the bus at the intersection and take a mini shuttlebus to the viewpoints, which costs extra money).  
On day 2 I explored the Yellow Stone Village (which is nice but REALLY redundant at this point..) and walked along the Golden Whip Stream. This is actually nice because you get a different perspective, walking along the stream looking up to the rocks, so if you have time, that's also nice. There are a lot of monkeys along that trail, be careful.   
Finally, I walked along the Ten Mile Gallery, but I would say this can be skipped. Again quite redundant.

**72 Wonders Building in Zhangjiajie:** This looks amazing, especially when lit-up at night. I wouldn't pay the high entrance fee. Taking photos from the opposite street should be enough, especially if you're short on time.

**Guilin / Yangshuo / Xingping (3 days changed to 4 days):**  
This was supposed to be another highlight of the trip and the relaxing part, but .... again heavy rainfall and it was quite cold. Guilin had 27°C and sunshine on pretty much every day apart from when I was there, when it suddenly dropped to 13°C and due to the heavy rain it felt even colder ....  
Consequently, I couldn't do or see that much ....   
  
**In Guilin (0,5 days)** I went to see the Elephant Trunk Hill (free admission). You can also go up the hill which I recommend because you get some nice views, but when I was there, the ""normal"" way up was closed, but there was still another way to go up there. The Sun and Moon Pagoda are also nice. You can either just take photos from far away or pay an entrance fee to go up to both pagodas for interensting views and the two pagodas are connected via an underwater tunnel that you walk through, so that's quite cool.

The next day I was in **Xingping (1 day)** where I wanted to do a few hikes, but the weather was so horribly bad .. I just took a quick photo of the 20 yuan bill view while my actual 20 yuan bill was dripping wet after only a few seconds ... I took a bamboo tour but that was very unpleasant due to the heavy rain and cold weather .... I assume it's amazing on any other day .... I hiked up Laozhai Mt. but didn't see anything because the weather was so bad. There are signs everywhere telling you it's a super dangerous hike. Nope! I did it in the WORST weather ever with rain covers over my shoes and even then it was not difficult at all (but I'm an avid hiker, so ...)  
Getting off at Yangshuo Railway Station was one of the very few ocassions when my [Trip.com](http://Trip.com) esim card didn't work, so I had to pay the bus to Xingping with cash. Keep that in mind if you go there.

**Yangshuo (1 day changed to 2 days)** was nice. Still, the weather sucked. On my second day there it finally stopped raining and I was able to do a bicycle (not electric bike!) tour. That day, due to lack of information and lost in translation I started first at the G. Bridge cycling along the Ten Mile Gallery to the Moon Hill, but it's not very beautiful there. Then I took a shuttle bus to Jima Pier, from where I started walking - the area there is SO BEAUTIFUL! Luckily, at some point I came along another rental shop and got a bicycle and then rode it all the way to Fuli Bridge (which I also recommend).  
I spontaneously decided to stay another day, so I had to cancel my super expensive train ticket to Shanghai (or rather postpone it) which did cost mit almost 200yuan .... but instead of going to rainy Shanghai I opted for ONE rain-free day in Yangshuo instead.  
I then did the TV tower hike which I didn't want to do, but it was better than nothing. Honestly, the view is not that great and if you have the chance, I'd rather do some hikes in Xingping (which I couldn't due to the super bad weather).... and then I took a taxi to Cuping Hill which I HIGHLY recommend. However, it's in an absolutely remote area, so I asked the taxi driver to wait for me, because NO TAXI OR DIDI would come to pick you up there ever .... he then showed me another viewpoint as well.   
I then decided that I needed to get the lost day in Shanghai back, so I cancelled my train ticket yet again (another 200 yuan byebye) and spontaneously booked a flight for the late evening from Guilin to Shanghai which was absolutely no problem and it was actually cheaper than the highspeed train ticket which was interesting because when I planned my trip the plane tickets were three times the price of a train ticket, but oh well ... I had to pay for overweight luggage because I didn't plan to take the plane and my luggage was already quite heavy at this point ... once I arrived at Shanghai airport I got a Didi to a nearby hotel and then I started throwing up, having the most miserable time yet of the entire trip.   
The next day, having a high fever, I could not possibly leave the bet, let alone check out and move to the next hotel in the city center of Shanghai ... so half-dead as I was, I had to chat with the hotel I was currently staying at if I could just stay another night in the current room, had to kindly ask to cancel the other hotel, they wanted 80€ cancellation fee .... it was a nightmare ... eventually I didn't even know if I could fly back home in that state ....

**Shanghai (4 days, but 2 of them sick in bed)**  
Eventually, I recovered and had 1,5 days to explore Shanghai. I went to a watertown, went to Suzhou for half a day and checked out the famous skyline of Shanghai. That's about it. Everywhere it was croweded although it was during the week. Absolute madness.....



I know this was a loooooot of text, but I hope that this is still helpful for some of you.  
Feel free to ask me any questions. :)

1p1f6zi,https://i.redd.it/e8eaxah7992g1.jpeg,🌅✨ Waking Up Spiritually: The Ultimate Morning Routine! ✨🌅,"So, I decided to spice up my morning routine by adding a little ""spiritual awakening"" to the mix. You know, instead of just hitting snooze 5 times and wondering if coffee counts as a spiritual guide. 

Here’s how it went:

1. **Meditation**: Sat cross-legged on the floor, trying to channel my inner zen. Ended up channeling my inner ""why did I skip leg day?"" instead. 

2. **Affirmations**: Repeated “I am powerful and unstoppable” while simultaneously contemplating whether I should order breakfast or just wait for lunch. 

3. **Nature Walk**: Took a stroll outside to connect with Mother Earth. She seemed to be saying, ""Can you keep it down? I'm trying to grow some trees here!"" 

4. **Gratitude List**: Wrote down three things I’m grateful for, but only managed to think of two. Gotta love that third spot pressure! 

5. **Spiritual Selfie**: Captured the moment with a filter so bright, I might just blind my followers. #BlessedNBlurred

In conclusion, waking up spiritually is a journey, not a destination. And if all else fails, at least I’ve mastered the art of looking deep in thought while sipping my coffee!

Thank you Nice lady.,"So there is a lady that comes to the coffee shop (Tim’s). She is so thoughtful and sweet . She had asked me the other day if I wanted coffee and I politely replied thank you but I am fine. I was preoccupied and on the phone and she looked jilted and she said next time then and I said sure. Well today was the day and she again asks “you want coffee”? And I look up and said sure , remembering my promise last time. She said medium and I said sure and I added with cream. So away she goes and comes back with my coffee. ☕️ I said where is yours ? She said “ oh you don’t worry about me I just took pills and I am off to get my snow tires on”. She went away again and drove away with a box of donuts for the tire shop for while she waited. This lady clearly was on a mission of kindness  tis the season for receiving the unexpected. I am glad that I could make nice lady’s day by accepting. She seemed so happy when I did. It made me feel special too knowing that she seemed happy that I accepted her offer today. 
It might be a simple cup of coffee but it was the idea 💡 that a simple agreement of sure could make someone’s day when it was me who was benefiting from the kindness but rather not prehaps, in this case it seemed to go both ways with giving and receiving and a win win to brighten the day ☀️ ",2,1763576093.0,randomactsofkindness,1,1.0,False

Este post va dirigido a todos aquellos que como yo, gustan de escuchar buenos bajos, pero que dudan de cuánto es demasiado y tienen la curiosidad por escuchar esos IEMs, que pregonan poder reventar los oídos y dejarnos en estado catatónico pero con una gran sonrisa en los labios... 

Pues bien, no sufran más porque ya lo probé por ustedes, y aquí les comparto mi agradable experiencia... después de recuperarme un poco del dolor de cabeza y poder poner en orden mis ideas, antes de correr el riesgo de decir incoherencias!

El reto ha sido resuelto identificando lo que es tolerable para mis oídos y como poder controlar esos excesos. Los implicados en este ejercicio han sido tres ""voluntarios"" que retumban con agrado, uno más de lo esperado a pesar de ser el de ""menor"" presencia. Comento mi escucha realizada con los tres...

En la mesa de estudio se encuentran los QKZ x HBB, Whizzer OC1 y las ""mini rocas"" iRock. De acuerdo con la comunidad audiófila y las referencias encontradas, amén de la publicidad, el QKZ es un ""basshead"" declarado, el Whizzer es un ""basser"" aspiracional y el ""rocky"" pues no se destaca específicamente. Todos integran DD's, de 10mm. para los mayores y un ""couple"" de 8 y 6 en línea para el pequeño de la muestra. 

Para mis oídos que gustan de escuchar unos bajos presentes, que abracen a la melodia y acompañen las voces, les es complicado escuchar por mucho tiempo unos ""bajos pesados"". De esta manera y tal como se presentan estas pequeñas bestias golpeadoras, puedo escuchar el QKZ x HBB por casi una hora, el Whizzer OC1 un poco más, pero el pequeño iRock solo pude tenerlo retumbando alrededor de 40 minutos. Durante esta audición utilizé las mismas Easytips del Whizzer. 

Para aclarar, la música se escucha bien y de forma agradable, pero el ""rumble"" termina por abrumar...por eso necesito domar un poco la brutalidad. Y esto ha sido posible, al menos en cierto nivel, con un pequeño ajuste, el cual se puede observar en la imagen. Identifiqué 3 eartips que modulan un poco el sonido de cada uno de ellos, y así es posible escucharlos por más tiempo. Para los QKZ, con las puntas Bambú, se prolonga la escucha sin cansancio por unos 90 minutos, para los Whizzer con las TRN-T ya puedo escucharlos alrededor de 2 horas, pero con los más pequeños tuve que acoplar unas tips ""short/wide"" (como las KBear coffee) y así se vuelve factible utilizarlos por más de 1 hora cómodamente...

Me gusta el sonido de los tres, pero su uso lo haré con medida, en el día a día pienso utilizar más frecuentemente al Whizzer, los otros los contemplo para ciertos momentos...y quién hubiera pensado que el ""peque"" resultaría ser un ""pocket rocket"", un rebelde sin causa aunque no un James Dean. 

Gracias por leer, nos seguimos escuchando...

My question is how are you guys (who got laid off) holding up? I don't have a family in Denmark and love entirely alone. Even though, i have lived in Denmark for 7 years, I still find it hard during the holiday season. Given the recent layoff, I feel I have a lot of time that I do not know how to use. The job market is very bad in Denmark, i get rejected by the HR system despite 10+ years of experience.

Anyways, what are you guys doing to keep sane? Traveling is an option but I want to save up because I am assuming that next year will be tricky.

1p1eykj,https://i.redd.it/hpchziyp792g1.jpeg,Living with ADHD and the corruptionl *PLEASE READ*,"After years of being called an A-Hole, W*nker, annoying and being told to get lost, I'm too much, you talk to much, leave me alone, I found out at 32 years of age, I have ADHD, although unofficially diagnosed as I am still waiting for the assessment, it's just common sense. 

My name is Rhys and I finally eased my ADHD into something a little easier to handle. 

So after years of what I said above, failing school, failing everything I push to achieve because my attention span is shorter than a spark on a wet fuse. 

I recently came across a lot of health issues, mental and physical, after having a motorbike accident a few years ago which didn't help. 4 months ago I was 15st 8lbs heavily over weight. I went to a party which I never go to, drank too much alcohol and ate too much food. The next morning I bled out of my back passage for 4 days straight when going to the toilet which led me into panic mode, (bare with me as this does involve ADHD), out come the gloves and say goodbye to my weight issues. From April 13th until now 19th November, i have been doing a strict diet, no carbs at all, Carnivore. Meat and Dairy with the occasional apple, banana and honey in my coffee. 

This led to my weight dropping to 13st in just over 3 months. I go to the gym 3 times a week and Muai Thai once a week, never would have done this before. My ADHD hyper focus was on point with this. Then I realised, my ADHD has been easier to manage. My thoughts, although still extremely loud and busy, they seem easier to hear, no echos in my head. I still struggle with it, but I've reduced my head stress by at least 30% which feels absolutely great! 

Now I'm not telling you to go and do a carnivore diet, but what I am saying is change your lifestyle, especially your diet. I was on medication for a few years before this, heavily meditated, suicidal, attempted suicide 3 times, one of those attempts were failed because I had to save someone's life. I went to take my van off the side of a cliff, I had a note written and everything, as I was coming up to the corner I could see orange flashing lights, I slammed on my breaks to see a car flipped on its roof. I had to get out and help. Little did they know, they just saved my life. Although I was annoyed, I also thought about God and was he telling me that I'm not ready, was this actually a sign? Because that's a pretty big sign. 

That aside and other attempts at suicide, my suicidal tendencies have reduced dramatically, my pains in my joints although still there, are improved to a point I can bare the pain, before I was on heavy pain meds. Although I still have to take them, it's once every few days compared to every day. 

I know most of you won't make it this far with your ADHD, I know I wouldn't have before my lifestyle changes, but try something new, change what you eat, cut all processed garbage out of your body, whether you do Carnivore or Keto, they are both amazing and the real way you should be eating. It has changed my life in a good way, I can't vouch for Keto and ADHD, but carnivore I can. But it's not for everyone. 

I hope you managed to read this and I hope it helps you find a new and right path, if I have helped please let mekl know, would be amazing to see who would listen to this. P. S. Groups don't let me share this because they think I'm promoting an unhealthy lifestyle... Can't be further from the truth and they wouldn't batter an eye lid at someone saying this if it was Vegan. So why with carnivore or Keto. ",1,1763575606.0,healthcare,0,1.0,False

I had it repaired by Mr John Fitzgerald over at Fitz Cyclez (side note... I've had a frame built by him so I already had a working relationship so he graciously agreed to help me out. I don't think he does this sort of work regularly). Being as the frame is on the larger side, I decided to bump the downtube size from a 31.8 and 9/6/9 to a 34.9 and 8/5/8 wall thickness. So larger diameter and thinner walls. Hit it with some clear coat and off we go.

My sister and I are in a loophole for the past 24h trying to find an old browser game we used to play as kids.

It was a pixelated 2D virtual world game with chatrooms where you'd personalize your little cafe/bar and then open it for others to join and chat.

I remember having issues with javascript with this game, it was around the 2000s-2010s.

The colors we're mostly neutral shades of brown, but I vaguely remember putting down red barstools for people to sit on and green plants in my cafe.

I'd like to precise that it is not Habbo Hotel, but another game completely.

I've literally made a little quick paint sketch to give you an idea of what it looked like. It was just a diagonal square like this where people would come through the door and hang out and sit. There was a coffee\\bar at the back and then you could put tables and stools around, I also vaguely remember being able to buy a jukebox.

The chatbox was at the bottom, I remember being able to whisper to people directly without others seeing what was said, and i vaguely remember being able to emote.

Recently, we decided to begin a formal Bible study because we genuinely want to draw closer to Jehovah and become part of the organisation.

Our study is conducted by a brother who is a long-time family friend of my husband. Although he does not attend our congregation, he knows an active elder within our congregation, and that elder has been joining our studies as well. Over time, we’ve also gotten to know the elder’s wife, whom I’ve invited over for tea or coffee as she seemed very kind.

However, after our meeting today, the elder approached my husband and asked if he would like his wife to conduct my Bible study instead. My husband clarified that we prefer to study together.

I’m unsure why the elder and his wife are so persistent about separating my study from my husband’s. We are both learning the same material, and the request felt unusual.

Hi! My name is Stephanie! I’m 35 and live in Western Canada (Specifically - Alberta). I am hoping to make a new online friend that is fun/funny, genuine, willing/able to put effort into conversations(I will do the same!). I would prefer to chat with people around my age, or older(please no one under 30!), that is able to text/write full words lol - a bit of slang is cool, but I can’t do the whole “u” instead of “you” thing etc all the time! 

Some things I enjoy that could give an idea if we have interests in common, or just to start a conversation: music! My favorite band is blink 182, and has been since I was 14 - also pretty into Alkaline Trio, mgk, Taylor Swift etc etc. I enjoy shopping and getting my nails done - I see a very talented nail tech that makes all my nail art dreams a reality. I love coffee, movie and tv shows, with a preference for anything horror. I love to exercise daily, and love to go for long walks. Other things too, but I don’t want to give everything away here, or make this intro too long. 

If this interests you and you’d like to have a chat, please send me a message with a quick introduction!

When plugged in a USB drive it wouldn’t mount and an error about ‘read access’ came up (sorry can’t remember exactly) so I decided to restart the machine. However it booted back into GNU GRUB so I googled it and using commands worked out the kernel is on (hd0,msdos1). I then tried the various commands to get it to load but unfortunately failed.

I know very little about Linux and typically use windows for it’s simplicity. That said with some guides I managed to trace the error to “failure reading sector 0x800995 from hd0)” which AI seems to say is a HHD failure.

My question have I lost everything on my laptop, is it worth throwing money into saving it or should I cut my losses and recycle the laptop?

Side note: I can’t afford much money and the data is only 8GB worth of old photos but would love to get back if possible. If this sub allows it I’m willing to buy some coffees etc if someone can help.",0,1763575255.0,datarecovery,0,0.5,False

1p1erkr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmic_Latte/comments/1p1erkr/cosmic_latte_the_universes_true_color/,Cosmic Latte — The Universe’s True Color,"When we look up at the night sky, we see darkness sprinkled with stars. But scientists once asked a fascinating question:  
**“If you mix all the light in the universe together… what color do you get?”**

The answer surprised everyone.

# ☕ Cosmic Latte — The Universe’s True Color

In 2002, astronomers studying the light from more than 200,000 galaxies discovered the average color of the universe. They named it **Cosmic Latte**.  
It’s a soft, warm, creamy beige — like the first light of morning or a cup of warm milk coffee.

Not white.  
Not black.  
Not blue.  
But something gentle… something human.

# ✨ What Cosmic Latte Means

Cosmic Latte tells us something amazing:

* The universe is full of **stars and galaxies burning with ancient light**.
* Their combined glow creates a warm tone — a reminder that the cosmos is not cold and empty.
* Even the universe carries a quiet beauty, a simple color, a soft whisper of creation.

# 🌠 A Color Made of Everything

Cosmic Latte feels special because it’s made from **every star, every nebula, every galaxy** all together.

It represents:

* Unity
* Harmony
* Balance
* The story of billions of years of light

It’s the color of *all existence mixed into one*.

# 🎨 Why I Love This Color

Cosmic Latte is peaceful.  
It feels like the universe saying,  
“Relax… breathe… you’re a small part of something beautiful.”

Today, let Cosmic Latte remind us:

Even in a huge universe, we have a place.  
Even in endless space, there is warmth.  
Even in cosmic darkness, there is light that blends into something soft and comforting.

1p1eqak,https://www.reddit.com/r/INFPIdeas/comments/1p1eqak/how_to_stop_replacing_things_too_early_and_why/,How to Stop Replacing Things Too Early — And Why It’s One of the Most Powerful Climate Actions You Can Take,"Most households and workplaces replace expensive, high-impact items years before they actually wear out. This has huge environmental consequences because nearly all the carbon footprint of electronics, appliances, and furniture comes from manufacturing, not use. By extending the life of what we already own, we cut emissions, reduce mining pressure, shrink landfill waste, and save hundreds or thousands of dollars. Below is a list of the most commonly replaced items, what their real lifespan should be, and simple ways to maintain or repair each one so you can avoid unnecessary upgrades.


1. Smartphones

Typical replacement: 2–3 years
Potential lifespan: 5–7 years or longer

Smartphones are replaced early due to slowdowns, battery issues, and marketing pressure, yet most only need a cheap battery swap or storage cleanup. Environmentally, phones are one of the most resource-intensive products we own because they contain lithium, cobalt, gold, copper, rare earth metals, and complex circuitry. Maintaining them is simple: recalibrate the battery, replace the battery when needed, uninstall unused apps, clear cache, reduce background activity, keep storage below 90%, and protect the phone in a solid case. These steps reliably extend life by several years.


2. Laptops and Tablets

Typical replacement: 3–4 years
Potential lifespan: 8–12 years

Laptops are often replaced because of slow performance, battery decay, and cosmetic wear. The environmental footprint is massive due to aluminum production, battery mining, and energy-intensive manufacturing. Most slow laptops only need a solid-state drive upgrade, a RAM upgrade, or a battery replacement. Cleaning internal dust improves performance and stops overheating. Refreshing the operating system every few years restores speed. Tablets last far longer with storage cleanup, background-app management, and battery replacements if possible.


3. TVs and Computer Monitors

Typical replacement: 5–7 years
Potential lifespan: 10–15 years

Large screens are frequently swapped for newer models even though older ones work perfectly. Manufacturing a TV requires glass production, metal extraction, rare earth phosphors, and fossil-fuel-intensive shipping. To extend life: turn down brightness, avoid constant static images, dust vents, and use eco-modes that reduce panel stress. Most minor issues — dimness, color tint shifts, power-button failures — are cheap to fix.


4. Printers

Typical replacement: 2–4 years
Potential lifespan: 8–12 years

Printers are typically discarded because of ink costs or minor mechanical problems. Yet most are fully repairable. Their manufacturing footprint includes metal rollers, motors, plastic casings, chips, and heavy packaging. Clean clogged print heads, update drivers, empty internal waste-ink containers, and use refillable ink systems to keep them running for many years.


5. Desktop Computers and Accessories

Typical replacement: 3–5 years
Potential lifespan: 10–15 years

Desktops can easily last a decade or more with the occasional RAM upgrade, drive upgrade, or cleaning. Accessories like keyboards and mice are often thrown out for minor issues such as sticky keys or frayed cords. These items contain plastics, wiring, PCBs, and metals that are rarely recycled. Cleaning and repairing cables or switches keeps them functional for years. And pre-emptively taping or rubberbanding wire sections that typically fray can greatly extend their lives.


6. Kitchen Countertop Appliances

Typical replacement: 3–5 years
Potential lifespan: 10–15 years

Coffee makers, microwaves, blenders, and toasters often fail due to clogged internal components or cheap replaceable parts. These items mix steel, plastic, electronics, and motors — difficult to recycle and expensive to manufacture. Cleaning heating elements, descaling machines, replacing gaskets, and fixing power switches can extend life dramatically.


7. Large Home Appliances (Refrigerators & Dishwashers)

Typical replacement: 8–12 years
Potential lifespan: 15–20 years

Homeowners often replace major appliances early for cosmetic reasons or small performance drops. These machines require steel, insulation foam, copper, refrigerants, and high-energy industrial assembly. Maintaining seals, cleaning coils, replacing small parts (fans, switches), and fixing leaks prevents unnecessary early replacement.


8. Office Chairs and Furniture

Typical replacement: 5–7 years
Potential lifespan: 15–20 years

Chairs and furniture are replaced early because of fabric wear or mechanical looseness. Their environmental footprint is huge because they rely on foam, plastics, steel, and long-distance shipping. Reupholstering, tightening bolts, replacing casters, or cleaning surfaces extends lifespan for years.


9. Clothing and Shoes

Typical replacement: Months to 2 years
Potential lifespan: Several years

Fashion cycles, small tears, or worn soles lead to premature discarding. Textiles generate massive pollution, microplastic shedding, and chemical waste during manufacturing. Repairing seams, patching holes, resoling shoes, and line-drying to preserve fabric extends lifespan significantly.


10. Carpets and Rugs

Typical replacement: 5–7 years
Potential lifespan: 15–20 years

Carpets are rarely worn out; they’re replaced due to stains or style updates. Manufacturing synthetic carpets requires petroleum-based fibers and harsh dyes. Professional cleaning, spot treatment, and rotating rugs keep them looking good for years.


11. Mattresses

Typical replacement: 7–8 years
Potential lifespan: 12–15 years

Mattresses are often replaced early due to impressions or discomfort, yet most can be revived by rotating regularly, adding toppers, or reinforcing support slats. Disposal is environmentally harmful because foam and springs are rarely recycled.


12. Light Fixtures and Lamps

Typical replacement: 5 years
Potential lifespan: Decades

Fixtures are replaced for aesthetic reasons rather than function. Manufacturing requires metal, wiring, and glass. Replacing only the shade, rewiring a socket, or tightening joints keeps fixtures functional nearly indefinitely.


13. Headphones and Small Electronics

Typical replacement: 2–4 years
Potential lifespan: 7–10 years

Batteries, frayed cables, or loose ear pads are the main failure points. These devices contain metals, plastics, and circuit boards that create complex e-waste. Replacing batteries, pre-emptively taping or rubberbanding the section on wires that typically fray, soldering cables, or swapping ear pads often restores them completely.


14. Power Tools

Typical replacement: 3–5 years
Potential lifespan: 10–20 years

Power tools are replaced almost exclusively due to battery failure. Yet rechargeable battery packs are inexpensive and easy to replace. Proper cleaning and lubrication also extend motor life dramatically.


15. Office Supplies and Organizational Items

Typical replacement: Every 1–2 years
Potential lifespan: Decades

Binders, storage units, and other supplies are replaced during reorganizing or aesthetic refreshes. These items are almost all plastic-heavy and extremely durable. Cleaning, repairing, and reusing avoids unnecessary waste.


Why Extending Lifespan Matters So Much for the Planet 🌼 

1. Most emissions occur before the product ever reaches your home.

Manufacturing electronics, furniture, and appliances accounts for 70–90% of their lifetime carbon footprint. Extending life even one more year dramatically reduces total emissions.


2. E-waste is the fastest-growing waste stream on Earth.

Less than 20% is properly recycled worldwide, and much is toxic.


3. Mining for metals drives deforestation, water pollution, and habitat loss.

Lithium, cobalt, copper, and rare earth mining all carry severe ecological costs.


4. Household purchases are the #1 driver of global ecological degradation.

Reducing consumption is one of the most effective climate actions individuals can take.


5. Maintenance is cheaper, easier, and far more powerful than replacement.

1p1epfe,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1p1epfe/aio_bf_projecting_insecurities_then_blaming_me/,AIO bf projecting insecurities then blaming me for my reaction,"This is a longer post but worth the read because I’m at my wits end with all of this. 

So my (27F) boyfriend (27M) is still working with his insecurity and projection. Last night I told him about a guy at work who is overly friendly and offered to buy me a coffee (I politely declined) which I explained I’m not naive about and it seemed he was testing the waters. My boyfriend thanked me for telling him about that and it led him to say “this doesn’t have to do with what you just told me but I have something I want to ask. it’s insecure though and I don’t know if I should.” I told him yes it was okay to do so. He asked if there were to be an attractive man I know or work with, if I would change my behavior toward him. The way he explained it “would you be not as friendly and just completely professional, nothing else.” I told him no, I wouldn’t act any differently with someone who is objectively attractive (I am a very extroverted, friendly, outgoing woman and he’s mentioned this can mislead men thinking I am interested in them) I told him if I were to feel like I HAD to do that, that’s problematic and shows I cannot trust myself around an attractive man, so I reiterated I wouldn’t be less friendly than I am with anyone else. I could tell he didn’t like my answer, he continued to ask the question in different ways and even asked “what if your partner asked out of respect to do that?” And I was baffled and stood my ground: “then we clearly have bigger problems if my partner is threatened by another man and doesn’t trust ME to handle my interactions appropriately.” I then turned his question on him and asked if he was projecting, if he would change his behavior being around an attractive woman because his thought process seems like it would apply to him. Which then made me question HIS trust of himself and the ability to be faithful in a similar situation. Then he goes to ask “if someone shows interest in you would you still hang out with them in a group setting (outside of work, etc)?” I said it depends, did he disrespect you, me, or the relationship? Or did he just ask if I was seeing someone? Because if it’s the latter, that’s completely appropriate and I wouldn’t change our dynamic. My boyfriend disagreed and said “that person will always want you and will always be waiting to get at you” and I got so fucking angry with him and told him I couldn’t disagree more. I’ve been on that end of the scenario and once the guy told me he wasn’t single I no longer saw it as a possibility and let it be. Just because someone is seeing if I’m in a relationship doesn’t mean I will no longer be friends with them unless of course they disrespect my relationship as mentioned earlier. But he disagrees and says “men are different you don’t understand they will keep trying until they get you”, he even mentioned he’s done that in the past with a woman he knew was taken. But like what the fuck I’m a grown woman who can handle my own and even in the past he’s made it clear he thinks I am naive and I don’t see things the way a man does and how my friendliness = interest and gives them the wrong idea. All of this just tells me he STILL doesn’t trust me even though I’ve given him ZERO reason not to and it hurts so much. It’s also concerning how much we see this differently and disagree and that he has these ideals in the first place which again make me think he himself cannot control his actions if he was in the scenarios he proposed to me. After I explained to him my aforementioned concern he panicked and asked why it’s so concerning and what the big deal is. After I explained further he literally said “I told you I was asking all of that in an insecure mindset so I purposely played devils advocate with how I asked things, but that’s not how I really feel about all of that” and I told him that’s crazy behavior and it makes ME feel crazy but the way he justified it was it helped his insecure side know my answers but like… I told him his “insecure side” is still HIM and they’re not two separate things. This all concluded with him partially spiraling, guilt tripping me, assuming I now I view him differently because he did that and he was just trying to be vulnerable and he screwed himself over by saying all of that.

1p1ej40,https://www.reddit.com/r/mormon/comments/1p1ej40/is_cafeteria_mormonism_possible/,Is Cafeteria Mormonism Possible?,"Even after distancing myself from the church, I keep learning more about Mormonism and the Mormon experience. I've heard people say, ""There is more than one way to Mormon."" I've tried to figure out how to view the world through a non-Mormon lens, and while I don't think I'll ever get the stains wiped off the lens, I feel like it's getting clearer the harder I try.

One question I've debated in my head is whether Cafeteria Mormonism is really possible. Many on this sub have said they've tried, but it simply didn't work. Quotes from General and Area Authorities are posted showing that we are expected to fully live the gospel. We have temple recommend interviews that carry very explicit expectations.

Since I was raised in the church, my experience has always been an understanding that being LDS is an ""all-or-nothing"" experience. My (adult) daughter has friends who recently were chatting and some suggested that someone who doesn't wear their garments regularly or who drinks coffee, notwithstanding full activity, ""really isn't Mormon."" (The irony is that one of the ""pious"" ones hasn't attended church in years.)

But I've had the question for some time... **""Is dogmatic, all-or-nothing rhetoric from religious leaders, combined with nuanced practice by members, a uniquely LDS phenomenon?""**

Upon further study, it appears that most major religions (including Catholicism, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Evangelical Christianity, and Orthodox Judaism\*) preach strict adherence, while the members actually practice their religions selectively. Religious leaders preach high-demand rhetoric in an effort to *create boundaries and define who they are*, but members across *practically all members of these denominations interpret and live their religion as they personally see fit*.

Mormons really are no different. My wife's house growing up was a no-caffeine household. They got up every morning at 6:00 AM (11 kids) and read scriptures. No shopping, for any reason, on Sunday. No playing in the backyard on Sundays. Religion was the absolute center of their life. On the other hand, there are ladies in my ward who are fully active (Primary President) who I see wearing nothing but exercise clothes ALL week... so no garments. I've even seen her wearing dresses at church that clearly don't work with garments (i.e. almost backless).

\*Back in the 18th/19th Century there was enough pressure within Judaism to modernize and break with the strictest levels of conformity AND YET maintain Jewish tradition that Reform Judaism and then Conservative Judaism--a middle ground--was created. Even within Orthodox Judaism, there are sub-groups that all feel like THEY have a monopoly on how Orthodox Judaism should be practiced.

My Orthodox Rabbi friend is annoyed that Hassidic Jews look down on his practices, while in the same breath criticizing others who ""think they're Jewish, but aren't.""

On the other hand, we have The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives. Are ***they*** Mormon?

So what's your experience? Are there many ways to Mormon? Does the inherent judgement within Mormonism make it impossible to participate? Would you participate more if nuance was more culturally acceptable? Is judgment a necessary evil? Do you judge as an active member? Do you still judge as an exmo? Is the church having a cultural revolution (i.e. The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives) wherein more and more active members just don't care what people think?",2,1763574677.0,mormon,6,1.0,False

He's obviously bored, tries to get into new stuff or get my attention constantly wandering and meowing loudly. It's these days where i'll play with him or give him treats or puzzles or new toys or whatever, but nothing makes him happy, that I just can't take it. It's not terribly often that it gets to me super bad, but it does happen. 

  
My solution has been to close him in my bedroom where there's nothing he can hurt himself with or damage, with a few of his favorite toys and a bowl of food. He usually just goes right to sleep, and I'll let him out a couple hours later. Since I'm not in there, he's got no reason to act out. 

I've seen people say that locking them up in ""jail"" just makes it worse, but this honestly seems to be the only thing that works for him when he's like this. It's less jail so much as it is ""go play by your self"" since he's got toys and food and such, and he literally never cries to be let out. I usually find him sleeping on my bed or near the heat vent. I see it similar to as if I was leaving for work (I work from home).  I've tried just closing him out of my office but that actually does make him yell, and me having to go in and out of the rest of the house usually riles him back up

I only do this if it's been like 3+ hours of him being insatiable and it's pretty infrequent. Maybe once every 10 or more days. Sometimes when I let him out he's calmed down enough to be normal, sometimes he's still a mongrel. 

Is this okay? I kinda just don't have any other options I feel like, aside from literally just going to a coffee shop to work away from him.",6,1763574427.0,CatAdvice,6,1.0,False

It is too often used as a cut through and it is not safe or friendly for pedestrians despite the fact that there are many people who walk, run and cycle that street daily. 

After complaining about it to my wife for the past 6 years, I decided it's finally time to start making some headway and see what I can do. Started with a small step of calling the county, they said that road is under state jurisdiction and I should call SCDOT. Upon calling SCDOT they said they could submit a request for sidewalk repairs but any new sidewalks would have to be discussed with local government (which we don't have) so... maybe some progress but a bit of a dead end. 

Has anybody been through this process that could share some insight? I would love to see Taylors become it's own official town/city so that we could self-govern but I know that's a long fight.

We brought an ex-OpenAI employee (70% chance of catastrophe) and a Princeton AI professor (basically no chance) together to debate if AI will kill us all. Ask Us Anything.","We're Anna Rothschild and Brooke Borel, [hosts of Entanglements](https://undark.org/podcast/) from u/UndarkMagazine. We're both answering from this account and will sign our responses.

In November 2024, we brought together Daniel Kokotajlo, a philosopher and former OpenAI forecaster who quit over safety concerns and Arvind Narayanan, a Princeton computer scientist and director of the Center for Information Technology Policy, to debate whether [artificial intelligence poses an existential threat to humanity.](https://undark.org/2024/11/11/podcast-will-artificial-intelligence-kill-us-all/)

Their positions couldn't be more different:

* Daniel puts a 70% probability on some form of AI catastrophe and thinks there's a 50% chance we'll reach AGI (artificial general intelligence) by the end of 2027
* Arvind gives less than 1% probability we'll reach AGI by 2030 and argues people have been wrong about AI doom for 70 years

During our conversation, they discussed: why we don't actually understand how our own AI algorithms work; whether ""alignment"" (making AI obey humans) is even possible; what happens when AI can automate its own research; the difference between large language models and true AGI; and what policies we need now even though they radically disagree on timelines.

Surprisingly, they found significant common ground on transparency requirements and international cooperation. They even made plans to get coffee.

We're here to answer questions about: the debate over AI existential risk; how scientists with opposite views can find common ground; what AGI actually means; why AI doomers and optimists disagree so sharply; the current state of AI safety research; and why this conversation was less terrifying than we expected (but still pretty scary).

Our podcast explores controversial science debates, from gain-of-function research to Mars settlement to whether psychedelics should be medicine, by bringing experts with opposing views together to search for nuance.

This is my second pregnancy (39 years old) and the first time I started at 250, went down to 240 and after delivery was in the 220s. I don't eat much junk food, but am a soda addict. The stress of expecting made me quit Dr. Pepper cold turkey for the health of my baby and I craved Kale salads.

This pregnancy started at 265 and now at 33 weeks I'm at 256. I'm actually excited to have this kid in January because I'll probably be another 20 pounds lower once I'm healed post-partum and all the baby weight, fluids, etc are gone. Again - cut back on the caffeinated drinks and am sleeping more - for my unborn child.

I've been lucky to have 2 fairly easy pregnancies- no complications, and they end up being weight loss programs....lol. It's not that I don't want to eat, or that I'm not. I eat a variety of foods in my diet and am not a big takeout person. Its just when I'm NOT pregnant I sleep very little and drink a lot of sugar. My career is demanding.

the problem I kept having: I’d wake up, start my routine, then completely blank on what comes next. check my phone to see the time and boom - 20 minutes gone scrolling instagram. panic. rush everything. leave feeling like garbage.

here’s what I finally figured out - my brain doesn’t need motivation or discipline or whatever. it needs someone to just tell it “do this for 5 minutes, now do this for 7 minutes, now do this.”

so I broke my morning into tiny chunks:

- get up + water (3 min)
- bathroom + teeth (5 min)
- dressed + meds (7 min)
- coffee + something to eat (7 min)
- open laptop + write 3 tasks (3 min)

then I set it to run on my phone’s lock screen so I never have to unlock it. just glance and see what’s next.

the game changer? not unlocking my phone. seriously. the second I used to unlock it to check a timer, I’d end up on reddit or texts and my whole morning would derail.

I’m still late sometimes. I still ignore it on bad days. but it’s the first routine that’s lasted more than like 4 days in years.

anyone else do something similar? what’s working for you?

I'm at that point where you've been staring at the screen for two hours and you can't remmeber your own name, much less if you finalized the grade for ""Argumentative Essay Unit 4.""

Today, the digital grading system decided to prank me. I opened the same students’s essay. Three times. Not because I was checking for plagiarism, which is its own special hell, but because I simply could not remember if I had finished the job.

I use this LMS, and I swear, the little checklist boxes are meaningless. Every time I see ""Aiden K."" I have a mini-panic attack.

I click, I read the introductory paragraph again. I see my own comments from an hour ago. I think, ""Wait, why is his grade blank in the book then?"" I close the document, I check the grade book (which has the lag time of a dial-up modem, by teh way). It's blank.

So I go back to the submission folder. I see Aiden's name. It looks suspicious. Maybe I only commented but didn't put in the 87/100. So I click again. And I read the same thesis statement again. And I waste five more minutes again.

You know what I finally figured out? I had entered the grade. But I hadn't refreshed the screen. Or maybe the sync hadn't caught up. The system tricked me into reading the same drivel three times. All of that extra work was for nothing. Nothing!

It was a pretty out of left field move by the software, honestly. Just wasting my time and making me question my entire existence. So I kind of laughed, closed my laptop, and realized I need to drink more coffee tomorrow.

So, seriously: How do y'all stay orginized and keep track of what you've actually scored versus what the LMS thinks you've scored? Because I need to stop giving this student three full readings of his paper.",3,1763573658.0,OriginalityHub,0,1.0,False

1p1e15o,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1p1e15o/question_about_discovery_in_fault_nofault/,Question about discovery in fault / no-fault divorces (TX),"Location: Texas

My wife and I “separated” in May this year - by which I mean told family and friends, moved to separate bedrooms in the shared house, agreed that we would file for a divorce but held off because I didn’t have a job at the time and it was more convenient for health insurance / didn’t want unnecessary expenses hitting the  am account. We also stepped back from prying into each other’s private lives. We agreed that we wouldn’t date others / start a relationship until the divorce, but stepped back from “where are you going tonight, who will you be with”. Pretty cordial and normal. At that time  I also got a prepaid debit card as part of the unemployment system in Texas. My unemployment benefits were deposited to the card and it was in my name. She didn’t have access to the account, and didn’t ask at that time.

A couple of weeks ago she asked for access to the online account and I didn’t share the username and password with her. I added her to text notifications so she sees how our shared money is being spent but didn’t retroactively give her all the places I’ve been and things I had bought while I thought the account was private. Again - for me - I felt that was part of our prior agreement. She suspects that I’m hiding evidence of an affair and that’s why I won’t disclose the password. Shes now told me she intends to file for an “at-fault” divorce because she believe that the legal process will give her lawyers full access to those accounts in order to prove an affair - evidence of buying gifts, meals out, hotel rooms, etc. I should state very clearly that there is no affair. Emotional, physical or otherwise. I do have a group of friends who I socialize with - so there are some meals bought on there, but they’re not all with the same person, and certainly not romantic dinners for two. More brunch, lunch, coffee meet-up. There is one woman in my friend group that my wife believes I’m having an affair with (and believes it predates the separation agreement), because this woman dislikes my wife / my wife distrusts this woman, but there is nothing there.

I’m still not disclosing the account details because I don’t want to have to justify every dollar I spent over the last six months, and  I don’t see how it would be proof (or otherwise). I could share the account with her, and she could ask me about every transaction, and my answers would be “that was brunch with Steve”, “that was coffee with Silvia”. 

On the divorce part (and the legal advice question). If she files for an at-fault / infidelity divorce without any incriminating evidence - text messages, witness statements, photographs, bank transactions prior to and outside of this one card over the last six months, can her lawyer really go on a fishing expedition and subpoena these records without some kind of probable cause? Am I just being stubborn for no practical reason, and setting myself up for a messy divorce? I don’t think it will make any difference to division of assets - since there was no affair, the division of assets will be settled as it would in a no-fault. I just would rather avoid paying a pair of lawyers to investigate this crap-fest and come to that conclusion, and don’t think it’s necessary.

My reservations are that some of the expenses on that card while small would be considered unnecessary by her, and she will bitch at me for buying things for myself when money was tight. Even coffee with friends when I could have just not had coffee with friends, a new shirt for a social event, etc. Definitely somewhat selfish purchases, but also what I needed / wanted for support while unemployed.

1p1dx36,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cloverdale/comments/1p1dx36/embracing_wellness_supporting_your_body_through/,Embracing Wellness: Supporting Your Body Through the Busy Holiday Season and Colder Weather,"The shift into the holiday season and the colder months brings a unique set of changes to our daily lives. From bustling social calendars and gift preparation to the simple fact that we’re moving less and spending more time indoors, these transitions can quietly impact our **mobility and movement**, as well as our overall sense of **well-being**. This time of year often heightens stress, both physical and mental, which can directly influence how our **nervous system** functions and how easily we navigate daily activities.

This post will explore how you can proactively care for your body and **nervous system support** during this busy and sometimes challenging period, focusing on simple, **holistic lifestyle** adjustments that keep you feeling your best.



# Why This Topic Matters: The Connection to Daily Function

During the holidays, your routine changes dramatically. You might be carrying heavy bags of groceries and gifts, standing for long periods while cooking, or sitting in an unfamiliar posture during travel. In the colder months, the natural tendency is to reduce outdoor physical activity, leading to stiffness and less natural movement throughout the day.

These shifts—the sudden demands of holiday errands, the travel, the change in physical activity—all feed into your **nervous system's** state. The nervous system is the master control system of the body; it monitors and coordinates everything from movement and posture to how you handle stress. When your body is under increased pressure, whether from physical demands or mental strain, the nervous system works harder. Prioritizing **everyday body support** becomes crucial to maintaining your composure and physical comfort as you move through the season's activities. Focusing on small, consistent acts of self-care is the key to managing this busy time with greater ease and energy.



# Understanding the Impact of Seasonal Shifts on Your Body

The colder weather naturally leads to a slight change in how we hold and carry ourselves. When the temperature drops, we often instinctively tense up or round our shoulders, pulling them inward to stay warm. We might bundle up in heavier clothes, which can restrict natural movement and subtle shifts in **posture and alignment**. Furthermore, the reduction in daylight hours can impact our mood and energy levels, sometimes making us less motivated to engage in regular movement or exercise.

It's important to recognize that the cumulative effects of these changes—reduced natural light, heavier clothing, less physical activity, and increased holiday stress—can place a quiet burden on your physical frame. This is why maintaining a high level of **body awareness** and committing to consistent **wellness habits** is so beneficial. A body that is supported and moving well is better equipped to handle the demands of travel, hosting, or simply enduring a long winter. The goal is not just to survive the season but to thrive through it by empowering your body's natural capacity for function.



# Actionable Tips for Holiday and Cold-Weather Wellness

Taking small, **actionable** steps can make a significant difference in your physical comfort and peace of mind during this season. These tips focus on simple adjustments you can make right now to support your body's function and manage the increased demands of the season.

* **Mindful Movement Breaks:** Even on the busiest days, set a timer every hour to stand up, walk around for two minutes, and perform a few shoulder rolls and neck stretches. This simple act helps counteract the effects of prolonged sitting, such as while working on a computer or wrapping gifts, and promotes better **mobility and movement**.
* **Optimal Posture While Standing and Lifting:** When cooking or standing for a long time, shift your weight from foot to foot and use a low stool to prop up one foot. When lifting heavy objects like groceries or boxes of decorations, bend with your knees and keep the object close to your body. This minimizes strain and supports better **posture and alignment**.
* **Stay Hydrated and Nourished:** The change in weather and the increase in festive drinks can sometimes lead to neglecting water intake. Commit to drinking a glass of water for every cup of coffee or celebratory drink you consume. Maintaining proper hydration is fundamental to all body functions and supports your **holistic lifestyle**.
* **Prioritize Nervous System–Supportive Habits:** Schedule in small moments of calm. This could be five minutes of deep breathing before bed, a mindful walk (even a quick one) outside, or simply turning off screens 30 minutes before sleep. These habits directly help manage **stress** and support the resilience of your **nervous system**.
* **Workspace Ergonomics for Home-Based Tasks:** If you are working from home or spending hours on a hobby, ensure your setup supports your body. Use a cushion for lumbar support, elevate your laptop to eye level with a stand or stack of books, and ensure your chair allows your feet to be flat on the floor. Proper **workplace ergonomics** reduces unnecessary physical stress.



# How Chiropractic Fits In 

At FFC, we use gentle, neurologically-focused chiropractic techniques to help support overall function and awareness of the body. Many people choose ongoing chiropractic care as part of their **wellness lifestyle**. We often utilize techniques like the **Torque Release Technique (overview only)**, which offers a non-invasive, gentle approach to encourage greater ease and balance within the nervous system. Our focus is on supporting your body’s inherent ability to adapt to physical, emotional, and chemical stressors, which are often heightened during the busy holiday and winter season.

Posting here after a long time, and it’s that sad part of winter again where we all start worrying about our destiny. Lost in thoughts… overthinking life as usual. Or maybe enjoying good cup of Tea/Coffee…

Some of us are worried about our careers (I’m definitely one of them).
Some of us are confused about life, relationships, and family…
And honestly, most of us have no idea where we’re heading.

I just scared myself one night. My hands were shaking so bad I could barely hold a cup. My heart was going fast. I was sweating through my clothes. I remember sitting on the bathroom floor and thinking this is how people die and no one would find me until the morning.

That was the point where something in me snapped. I poured everything down the sink the next day and told myself I would just try to make it through twenty four hours. That’s all I could think about.

My drinking didn’t happen all at once. I started with wine in the evenings. Then stronger stuff. Then hiding it in a coffee mug so no one would notice. Then drinking in the mornings when I thought I could get away with it. I pushed away the people who cared about me, and the people I kept around were only the ones who wanted to drink with me.

Now that I’m sober, I can see how fake all of that was. None of those friendships survived me quitting. And the real relationships, the ones that actually mattered, I damaged for years. I don’t blame anybody for keeping their distance. I just didn’t understand how bad it had gotten until my head cleared.

Most days now are quiet. Too quiet. I wake up early because I can’t sleep right, and I sit at the table and stare at my phone. I don’t know who to call anymore. I don’t know who to talk to. I have a son, and he’s the reason I’m trying so hard not to slip, but he has his own life and I don’t want to dump all this on him. I’ve been writing things down & talking to that Luna sober companion app when I get too overwhelmed.

I’ve had some rough moments. Shaking. Crying. Wanting a drink so bad it made my teeth hurt. I don’t know how to explain that level of wanting something that is killing you at the same time.

I know I can’t fix everything I ruined. I know people won’t just come back because I stopped drinking for a few weeks. I’m just scared. Sobriety feels like standing in the middle of the wreckage and seeing all the things I ignored for years.

I want a better life. I want to be someone my son can be proud of. I want to wake up without fear in my chest. I don’t know what comes next, but I’m trying to stay sober today. That’s all I can do right now.",55,1763573259.0,stopdrinking,20,1.0,False

- Medium roast espresso beans pour over (tasted bad)
- Decaf pour over (😔)
- Light roast (Colombian, Natural Process) double pour over, using the first pour over as the water for a second pour over with the same coffee but freshly ground.

So far the double light roast pour over was as sacrilegious as it was actually cool. It was an incredible waste of money for a worse drink that just a traditional pour over, however it actually tasted like a batch brew version of the light roast I used and still maintained the notes surprisingly well. It also was STRONG. I felt it for the rest of the day, and I have a high tolerance. I would not recommend this to anyone because it’s stupid and wasteful, but I would love to know, does anyone else get a morbid curiosity with weird pour overs? What are some ideas you wouldn’t try but a part of you is curious about?

- The last pour over experiment I’ve done was actually inspired by how I like to brew tea (three short dense steeps, using a Gaiwan, a tiny teapot), as well as it being late in the day, craving coffee but not wanting to be wired. I had about 10g of leftover grounds, so I set up my 4oz glass, and poured hot water through the grinds. Drank. Second pour. Drank. Third pour. Drank. And the fun of that was tasting how the flavor changed with each steep. I want to do it again honestly.

1p1duxd,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1p1duxd/updating_of_delonghi_doppio_max_dose_weighing/,Updating of Delonghi Doppio + Max Dose / Weighing Dose in Eletta Explore,"There have been rumors and perhaps misinformation by online affiliate sales youtubers.  This can be easily cleared up with a little help.  It will also help me update this [Various Brands Max Dose List](https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1efsz4y/machine_max_coffee_dose_list_including_current/) with new info.  

**The question is; does the Delonghi Doppio+ use 16g-18grams of coffee?**  Prior to the Doppio the Delonghi machines had a max dose of 12g on single services, 14g on x2 (doubles the fluid volume too).  The question is if the Doppio recipe adds to it.  I don't have a Eletta, I don't really want to get one so I am hoping one or two of you can help. 

**If you'd like to participate please follow the below method to measure the actual in cup coffee dose.**  Please use this method if you are wondering why, the note below explains it. 

Please treat this as a science experiment. 

1. Ensure your grinder is set to a find espresso grind setting. Doses can vary +/\_ 1.5g if you use a coarse setting vs espresso.  Espresso is generally as fine as the machine can go without clogging. 
2. Clean/dry your puck bin, and weight it empty in grams. 
3. Verify the coffee strength settings on your machine is set on max coffee strength amount with 1 single grind. Make sure your coffee hopper is at least 1/4 full to ensure proper feeding.
4. Run a shot with full coffee strength - the drink type doesn't matter, your machine brews espresso for all drinks.
5. When the machine is done brewing, remove the dredge bin and set it aside to allow the puck to dry out. You can use a butter knife to cut the puck up a little to help it dry faster be careful to not remove coffee grinds.
6. Please report back with your machine, grind setting from your dial and your results. 

Grind size can affect your dose by +/- 1.5g.  If you set your grinder to the most coarse setting, yes your dose will increase because your grinder can grind more coffee faster, however this more of a drip grind and not espresso. It would be weak espresso. 

**Note About Hoffman's Method:** Contrary to James Hoffmann's Video how to dial in a super auto, the only universal way across brands to verify your dose is listed below. What I found when you used Hoffmann's method of turning off the machine after the grind was it was generally unreliable across different brands.  My findings were;  1) Turning off the machine seems to cause some sort of power surge where the grinder grinds faster spilling coffee grounds outside of the brew units.  This was repeatable every time on some machines I tested. 2) Some machines also start to cycle where it is very difficult to catch the machine before a brew unit locks the dredge bin in place.

1p1duii,https://i.redd.it/esvfs3kcz82g1.jpeg,As Winter Burns White in Alternative Magazine (2008),"This is a magazine clipping of Adam's old band As Winter Burns White. Here is a transcript, typos and all:

""2008 has barely dragged its sorry ass out of bed and made its first coffee, so it seems crazy that a new Death metal and Grind core band, As Winter Burns White formed at the beginning of this year yet have already created such a complete sound.

They say, 'it was down to pure dedication from the start with non-stop writing and practicing. Jakkh and Kane started the band from playing in past bands together, we wrote a couple of songs and then auditioned relentlessly for 8 months, first finding Pip (vocals) and later finding Adam (drums) after auditioning 26 drummers. Soon after we found Ed (bass) who joined us after leaving his last band. We all wanted to achieve the same sound from the start which made writing very fun for us.'

To add to their crazed speed freak development, the band say they are currently in discussions with 'a few' independent labels. Their belief in the band is obvious and with that comes the desire to not be surgically implanted into sterile music genres. 'We just play heavy music and are passionate about it, if people want to say we're a certain genre they can, but we don't want to perceive our music as one category.'

Even their image jars with the traditional Death metal long haired beefier hardness of Sikth and Cephalic Carnage, (two of the band's heroes.) AWTW look like the kind of guys you'd take home to meet your gran.

1p1dudx,https://i.redd.it/17lsie2f092g1.jpeg,Shoulder to Shoulder men's community update (it's been a very surreal couple of weeks),"Shoulder to Shoulder – a quick update (and a very surreal week…)

A few weeks ago I posted here about a men’s community we’d started called Shoulder to Shoulder. I honestly thought a handful of people might be interested.

Since then… things have got a bit mad. In the best possible way.

1. Reddit actually invited us to their London office
They asked us to come in and talk to their team about what’s been happening here, how the post went viral, and how real community can grow on Reddit.
We shared stories from the group, showed some of your comments, and talked about how powerful it is when strangers decide to help each other. (Got a pic of us in their office!)

2. Spontaneous meetups all over London
This is the bit that blows my mind.
Men who met through that one thread have been grabbing coffees, doing local walks, evening meetups, even little micro-groups of guys in the same neighbourhood hanging out.
None of this was planned. People are just… showing up for each other. Got loads of pics but can't add multiple into the post annoyingly. 

3. Sauna + cold dips + pilates happening this week
We've always tried to organise cool events for our members, and this week we've got sauna and cold plunge tomorrow (now sold out!) and the a pilates taster on Saturday (nearly sold out!)

4. Interflora sent flowers for International Men’s Day
Still not over this. They saw what the group was doing and sent bouquets to some of the men who’ve been supporting others. It was such a thoughtful gesture and meant a lot to the guys involved.

5. Lucky Saint are hosting our Christmas get-together
They reached out and offered to host our Christmas meet-up at their pub on December 19.
If you want to come along, you’re absolutely welcome, we've still got a few tickets left, it’ll just be a relaxed evening of chats, no agenda.

I've got to give Reddit some credit here, it's one of the only places left on the internet where people talk like humans. Been amazing seeing the community connect through this platform, we're now up to 1,200 members.

So… thank you. If you're a guy interested in joining, our IG is the best place to start: https://www.instagram.com/shouldertoshouldercommunity 

One final point, I've been an occasional Reddit user for a while and want to make I'm abiding by the community guidelines. For anyone reading, do you find these updates interesting and do you want to hear more as the community grows?",85,1763573149.0,london,10,0.91,False

After delivery I went to fill petrol and went to the temple after for the usual blessings from God.

Then me my wife and son wanted to celebrate with some coffee and croissants.

Well was well and dandy till we left the coffee place and just a few minutes down the road a drunk or stoned guy in an e rickshaw that's used for transporting stuff not people was coming the wrong way and that too on far right side (from my perspective) and made a deep scar on the right side of my brand new barely driven less 20kms car.

My wife and I both try to stop the guy even try to break the windows but he didn't bother with anything and just drove the wrong way down the entire road. This the road in Prashant vihar from North ex mall t point till the ring road.

I also contacted the police at the naka he didn't much just asked me to calm down.

It is little devastating for me but I feel even we would have managed to stop and take him to the police nothing much would have come out of it.

We can’t fit a ramp on the couch because of our coffee table. I of course do not mind letting my dog up when she wants, but the couch is way too high for her to jump off, and she often does with little to no warning. So far, we have kept her on the floor and just petted her head when she wants up and she seems to be ok with it. Is this cruel? Not letting her snuggle with us on the couch?

No doubt  they have other wonderful things on the menu too but I don’t know what they are, I’m completely blind and the menu isn’t online and while I’m sure a member of staff could read it to me, that would just make me feel awkward and besides I’d rather know what’s there in advance so I can choose what I want to have before I get there.
Luckily for me, AI technology and OCR in particular has improved dramatically so that if someone takes a picture of text, the software can extract that text from the image.
So if anyone’s passing through that way and goes  there, would you be able to discreetly take a photo of the menu for me and then post it here and then I can use the AI magic to get the text.",15,1763573035.0,brum,9,1.0,False

1p1dqcz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Winnipeg/comments/1p1dqcz/a_love_letter_to_winnipeg/,A Love Letter to Winnipeg,"I know this town gets a lot of hate, but I just want to share how much it has changed my life in only one year. 

In May 2024, I was at the end of my rope in Alberta. I was a recent widow (2020), and I was miserable. My husband was the Albertan, and I did NOT want to stay. Trying to date there was a nightmare of rig pigs, misogynists, rabid right wingers or a combination of all three.  

I considered multiple places, but with Wab's election and the cost of living being lower here, I began thinking of Winnipeg. Until my first visit to house hunt in August 2024, I'd never been to Winnipeg before. People laugh when I tell them I moved here voluntarily, but my best friend's sister, daughter, and granddaughter also live here, so she's here all the time visiting. At the time, I also thought it would be nice to cross border shop (put on hold for the time being). 

I wanted to live in River Heights, and also looked at places in Crescentwood and Scotia Heights, but when my real estate agent showed me my current place and took me to Bonnie Day for brunch, I knew Wolesley was the place for me. 

The first winter was brutal as I endured SO MUCH home renovation, plastering, painting, electrical, plumbing, trying to create storage, and most of all the kitchen renovation! 

But when spring and summer arrived, things began to turn around. I explored every chance I got...brunch at different spots, multiple coffee joints, fun and quirky shops around town, bookshops and thrift stores, live music at the Park, Assiniboine Park, the Exchange, the Forks, the farmers market, the Human Rights Museum, and all the cool little local businesses near me. I introduced myself to every neighbour I could meet, and also met some great folks here on Reddit in person (shoutout to Jason and Willem)!  

The people in this neighbourhood have been a joy. Walking the streets here, I'm just filled with such a sense of peace and belonging. Despite being laid off my job last month, I'm still in better shape financially here than I was in Alberta.

Last night, I went and saw Terry Fallis at McNally Robinson and we had a lovely chat, since I had met him at the Surrey Writers Conference several years ago. I was brimming with good vibes and didn't feel like going home yet. I couldn't really afford it, but I was starved after, so took myself to Fionn's for dinner. When I went to pay, the waitress smiled and told me someone took care of it.   :O  She wouldn't tell me who it was, but I was just floored. And near tears. The universe just keeps giving me reasons to love it here. 

Whoever you are, if you're on Reddit, you have no idea how much that meant to me. 

So just to say, if anyone wants to meet for whatever reason-- coffee, drinks, just hanging out, shoot me a DM. I've never met a stranger. Loves me some Winnipeggers! ",93,1763572912.0,Winnipeg,8,0.98,False

I was let go from my last marketing job a few months back because they said it wasn’t the right fit and they needed someone with more experience. So now I’ve been unemployed for a bit, and a website marketing coordinator role popped up near me. It's mostly Shopify/CMS stuff, updating product pages, keeping the site running. People in my life keep telling me I’d regret passing up at least applying to it.

But, honestly, I’m burned out from marketing. I didn’t love the culture at my last few jobs, one of which was in house and the one I was fired from was agency. I haven’t been excited by any marketing positions I’ve seen, including this one. 

I've just been wanting something simpler, less stressful, even just part time, to get me back into the workforce.
I actually have an interview at a local coffee shop tomorrow.

I'm just looking to see if there's anyone else who's felt like this and skipped out on a job just because it didn’t feel right, even if it looked good on paper and sort of aligned with your previous experience.

I obviously just have a lot of external pressure from family and friends to go back to the field I spent most of my career in, but after being hurt by it so recently, I'm just not sure I'm ready.

1p1doi4,https://www.reddit.com/r/HangDogCityLimits/comments/1p1doi4/meet_me_at_hangdog_city_limits_8/,Meet me at Hangdog City Limits 8,"Something that has quietly been bothering Rahal suddenly clicks into place. A few days ago, in what seems now like a completely different life, she and May had sat in May’s quarters on “Halloween”, talking. A bird had flown in, not one of the pigeons, said birds couldn’t talk, then May had let it out the window and it had flown away. 



You can’t “fly off into” a display screen, it’s a screen. It’s a flat surface, if you try to go “through” it just breaks. You can’t step through a display any more than you can step through a TV. It had been showing a view of trees with bright fall foliage, there had been animals in that one, eating from feeders, birds and deer and some smaller furry ones she wasn’t sure about, they looked a little like cats but were eating birdseed. The bird or whatever had flown over the other animals, making some of the other birds scatter, and off into the woods.



“Why are you paying rent on an apartment  if your house isn’t even on the station!” Rahal says abruptly. 



“I’m not.” May says. “I’m paying rent on the door to an elevator that is perpetually out of service.” 



“So, it’s an elevator door that looks like the door to a house, sure, right.” Rahal says. 



“Why the hell is a wooden door in a space station? Why is it the only wooden door on that entire deck?” May asks. 



“I don’t…” Rahal stops. “Wait, why? That doesn't even make any sense.” 



“It doesn’t, does it. You’d think people would notice something like that.” May says. “It’s rather jarring, when you think about it, this big rectangle in the middle of all this…swoop. You know what else is really strange? Nobody ever comes to see me in my quarters, nobody but you. It’s almost like they have no idea it’s there, even though I’m listed in the staff directory. They can just never find it, they can find the one before it, and the one after it, but where is May’s place?” 



“But it’s right there.” Rahal says. 



“I know.” May says. 



“I can see it.” Rahal persists. 



“Indeed.” May says. 



“Ok, fine, the window in your bedroom really does go…” Rahal says. 



“Outside Over There.” May says. 



“Explain.” Rahal says. 



“Outside over there is wherever the gate exits, or, well, yeah, the gate, that’s good enough.” May says. 



“No, not that. Why do you say it like that. Tell me about the phrase ‘outside over there’.” Rahal says. 



“And then, Ida made a serious mistake.” May says. “She climbed backwards through the window, into Outside Over There. The goblins stole her sister, you see, and left a babe all made of ice. Ida had to go fetch her back. Maurice Sendak.” 



“Memes.” Rahal says, rather quietly. 



“Yes, why?” May says. 



“That’s…that’s the way you talk, isn’t it. Your native language, it’s one of those where it’s all just like a bunch of references to…” Rahal says. 



“That’s not all it is.” May says. 



“But that’s part of it.” Rahal says. “And you’ve got some seriously retro accent.” 



That gets a burst of laughter from everyone. May shrugs. “I am not learning a bunch of bullshit pop culture for your dumb ass, sorry.” 



“They understand it, though.” Rahal says. “These weird history freaks-” 



“Hey!” Dusty says. 



“Because they watch all that old stuff.” Rahal ignores him. “Hang on…Hang on! Those birds, the ones you talk to all the time, they talk exactly the same way.” 



“Fancy that.” May says. 



“Who does that black one belong to?” Rahal asks. 



“JJ.” May says. 



“Is she really your sister?” Rahal asks. 



“Not biologically.” May says. “Hey, has anybody seen a weather report for over there?” 



“It’s supposed to start snowing sometime tomorrow.” Vincent says. 



“Beautiful, perfect.” May says. 



“For how long?” Rahal asks. 



“Days, weeks, who knows, not Windows.” Vincent says. 



“It’s gotta go for, what, three days minimum for them to spore out?” May asks. 



“Yeah, might be longer, I don’t know which one is going. If it’s Big Red, it could be weeks.” 



“Awesome.” May says. “You getting a TV signal from that thing yet?” 



Diesel pokes at a control panel, shakes her head. “Nah, it’s just broadcasting AM/FM.” 



“Not bad. Do we have overlapping ranges yet?” May asks. 



“Some.” Diesel says. “It’s spotty.” 



“Yeah, that’s not worth it. I wanna wait until we’re getting the visual broadcast, anyway.” May says. 



“Why?” Rahal asks. 



“I’m setting up a network of gates.” May says. “They’re gonna be tied with the signal, they’ll stay on and stable as long as it’s broadcasting. We’ll turn around on this side and jack the signal, send our own right back. Not literally, but we’re functionally going to be going from tower to tower. There’s a gate under each one, it’s gonna be a bunch of really short hops instead of one long one, and that means it’s going to have a really hard time wandering off course.” 



“To…get to Hangdog?” Rahal says. 



“The weather is terrible.” May says. “I’m gonna set the gate on that end somewhere inside so-” 



“This is all so you don’t get wet!” Rahal shouts. 



“And cold, it’s gonna snow.” May says. 



“You are…you are…” Rahal says. 



“Warm and dry.” May says. “And I intend to stay that way.” 



Rahal gets up slowly and walks out of the room. May watches her leave, a slightly amused smile on her face. 



“Is she OK?” Vincent asks. 



“Oh, I’m sure she is.” May laughs. “She’s pretty good at adjusting her view of reality, it just takes a minute for it to kick in.” 



“She’s cute.” Mac says. 



“Yeah, she is. You know, she never learned how to sing?” May shakes her head. 



“Yeah, most of them don’t, now.” Dusty says. 



“What?” May says. “That’s ridiculous, why?” 



“They’re all convinced it’s some special thing, I guess. I dunno.” Dusty shrugs. 



“Oh, poor thing! She asked me to teach her how to sing, I thought she just never bothered or her siblings were dicks or something. That’s terrible!” May shakes her head. “Oh, good Lord, they don’t dance anymore, either, do they.” 



“Not most of them.” Mac says. 



“Well, shit.” May says. 



“You gotta train your monkey.” Dusty says. 



“Looks like it.” May says. “Ah well.” 



Rahal comes back in, she’s changed into civilian clothing and has her hair down. She motions Rick to move over and flops down on the couch next to him. 



“Hello!” May says. “Who’s this stranger I see before me!” 



“I’m off duty until you decide to do your job.” Rahal says, then turns to Rick. “Hey, you know Mallory, used to work down at Mango? Yeah, he got fired the other day, he was the one letting everybody in the back.” 



“Seriously?” Rick says. 



“Yeah, some idiot was like ‘well Mally always does it’...” Rahal shakes her head. 



“Did you ever find out who that goat belonged to?” Rick asks. 



“It stole a shuttle, so, no.” Rahal says. 



“Hey, D, can you get Z-TV here?” May asks. 



“Yeah, which channel you want?” Diesel pulls out a control pad and starts poking at it. 



“Drop It Like It’s Hot.” May says. 



The screen comes up with flashing lights and pulsing music. Someone is singing very quickly in English.  



“Get your ass up.” May grabs Rahal’s hands. 



“May…” Rahal says. 



“Oh my God, she knows my name!” May gasps. “Get up.” 



“Boss…I can’t-” Rahal says. 



“Aaand she forgot it again.” May says. “This is club dance, it’s super easy. Come on. Ok, here, just bounce on one leg. That’s it. Right? Yeah, now the other one…and back and forth…step forward…back…right….left…now two steps... Put your hands up. Way up! Not so high up…left…right…You’re a pony! You’re a pony!” May starts skipping.  



“I feel stupid.” Rahal says. 



“Yep.” May says. “Luckily, everybody else is too busy feeling stupid to care. Hey, check this out, y’all, come up here.” 



The Rycacians get up and arrange themselves. May starts a pattern of movements again, calling them out. She makes Rahal do them with her, then after a minute, motions for her to stop and turn around to watch.



 May is dancing in front of the group, who are all standing there, watching her, looking slightly amused. She adds a few sequences that are a little more complicated, then makes eye contact with Rahal, lifts her hand and counts down with her fingers. The Rycacians pick up the movements, and when they're all doing the same motions in sync, it doesn’t look stupid anymore. Diesel grabs Rahal’s waist and tugs her back and forth until she starts moving with the beat again. The music changes and they stop the coordinated movements. 



Dusty grabs May, spins her around and they start dancing together. 



“How do they know where to go?” Rahal asks. 



“He’s leading. It’s just a quickstep, they’re bein’ all fancy but it’s easy.” Diesel says. “Here, I’ll show you. Gimmie your hand…”

  


“What is that!” Walker spins the volume all the way down. 



“Sounds like a club mix of Avicii.” JJ says. “Oh, good, she is actually coming.” 



“Oh, for the love of…” Walker says. “Can’t she ever just be normal?” 



“I think she’s a little gun shy, particularly with the Controller about to go and throw shit everywhere. She’s gating up the whole damn planet, girl is not gonna get lost again.” JJ says. “On the good side, it probably means this isn’t an emergent situation.” 



“Why does she even care?” Walker asks abruptly. “Last time we blew a gate, she vanished off the face of the universe and we found her in the 1990s,  she’d been just bumming around for fifty years and only came with us because they were renovating the building she was in and she didn’t want to move.” 



“Did you talk to her right after she got back at all?” JJ asks. 



“No.” Walker says. “Not right away, couple weeks later when we did a show up there. She seemed normal, got up with us in the lounge and everything.” 



Walker is referring to the same performance Diesel’s drone had found and fetched back from Falcron. They had been in a band together for awhile, and May has a habit of deciding to insert herself into shows. He isn’t thinking about her singing, though, he’s thinking about earlier and later, when they’d been sitting and talking. Her performance was, for him, nothing special and completely unnoteworthy. If he had been thinking of those few minutes in particular, he might have remembered that May’s comment that someone was “making” her do it was not directed toward the audience, or the band. It was, rather, directed at a pair of large, scraggly pigeons who had landed on either shoulder and attempted a freestyle rap of “Go Your Own Way” until she had finally relented and gotten on stage to shut them up. 



“Man, when she realized how long it had been on this side, she flipped her shit. She had a fucking break down, I’m serious, like, crying and everything.” JJ says. 



“Why?” Walker shakes his head. 



“Dusty.” JJ says. “She’s in love with him, for real for real. It’s a good thing he’s still so young, I don’t even know what she would have done if he died while she was gone.” 



“He’s, what, sixty? Something like that?” Walker says. “How long do they live?” 



“Couple hundred years. They were touring and doing shit over at their place until pretty recently.” JJ says. “The bridge went out and they never put it back.” 



“How long, exactly?” Walker asks. 



“Um, three, four years, somewhere right in there.” JJ says. 



“The same time May came back.” Walker says. “He’s got that brown coat, can he…” He makes a vague motion. 



“Yeah, his kid, too.” JJ says. “You know there’s a gate over there, right? That’s why they gave it to him so cheap. It’s still got the lift down into it.” 



“Is it active?” Walker asks. 



“Not yet.” JJ says. “There’s a Controller sitting over there right now, though.” 



JJ stops the truck, which they’ve driven here because there’s a real driveway now. It’s stopped raining for the moment, the air is getting colder and the sky has taken on a particularly heavy look. It’s going to start snowing soon, probably in a few hours, and won’t stop until the Controller completes this stage of its life cycle. 



The front yard isn’t draining properly and their feet splash in a thin layer of standing water as they approach the house. It still looks the same, old and slightly grumpy about being disturbed. 



Walker holds the door for JJ and they go in. The clock is still sitting at 13:00, the timer obviously isn’t running yet, it’s just been taken out and set on the table. There does seem to be something different about the interior, though. Walker and JJ both notice it, but they have a great deal of trouble figuring out what exactly they are noticing. The place seems brighter than it had last time somehow, in a way that isn’t quite consistent with it just not being raining. 



JJ runs her finger along a table top and looks at it, then holds it out to Walker. “It’s clean.” 



And then Walker realizes it, too, the interior looks brighter because the layer of dust has been removed. The polished wooden floor is reflecting the light, as are the few remaining gilded objects. He slowly walks over and flips the switch on the wall next to the door, the overhead light comes on. 



“We have power.” Walker says. 



JJ holds her hand out over a radiator. “Heats on, too.” 



“Can’t have the pipes freezing.” Walker says. 



They go upstairs, the office is empty except for a large wooden desk. Walker opens a bedroom door and looks in. 



“What was that about the beds?” Walker asks. 



JJ sticks her head in. “Someone has changed the linens. After burning the old mattresses. What in the world is going on here, we’ve got security drones all over here, nobody has been in or out.” 



“Unless they’re doing it through that door that isn’t there.” Walker says. 



They aren’t particularly surprised to see that the latch to the basement door has been repaired. They are slightly more surprised to see a small sign taped to it- “Please Do Not Kick Door”. Walker tries the knob and it opens. 



Water immediately splashes through, soaking him. There is the sound of people clapping and cheering, a high pitched whistle and series of laughing calls, Walker slams the door shut. 



“What was that?” JJ asks. 



“Sea World.” Walker says. 



JJ laughs. “Well, guess that answers that question.” 



“Why do they have a gate to a marine animal park?” Walker asks. “What the hell are they doing?” 



“Aren’t the Controllers aquatic?” JJ asks. “For part of their life cycle, at least.” 



“Yeah.” Walker says. “They are.” 



“Justin!” JJ screams. “Justin!” 



A crow flies down through the chimney, lands on her shoulder with a puff of soot. “Chill, sheesh.” 



 JJ tugs the door open. “Get in there.”



“How did her parents die in a fire at Sea Parks?” The crow comments, then flies through the door. “Hey, watch it, ya big fish!” 



They look around the house while they wait. There isn’t really much to look at, aside from the books on the shelves. Most of them look like typical Victorian era texts, which JJ suddenly realizes is odd since it has all these electric appliances. They’re old, but obviously more recent than the house itself. She pulls one of the books down and opens it. 



“*Carrie*.” She reads the title on the printed page. She pulls another one down, then another. “*Christine, Misery, Insomnia*...” 



Walker grabs books and opens them, reading the actual titles. “*International UNIX Environments? Wicked Cool Bash Scripts*? What are these?” 



JJ shakes her head. “I have no idea.” 



They pull books down, looking at the first page then putting them in a pile on first the table, then the floor. It’s mostly a mix of fiction novels that are very old but, with the exception of the Sherlock Holmes books, had been written around a hundred years after the house was built, and what are obviously guides to something that Walker and JJ can’t understand, it looks like most of it is written in some sort of literal code, and the explanations clearly expect the reader to know what they’re talking about already. There are some random books thrown in there, coffee table type stuff, guide books filled with pretty pictures, a few about animals but it’s all surface knowledge. 



“What’s this?” Walker says. “It’s got a horse on it, but it’s a bunch of…” 



JJ takes the book, it’s very small, and looks at it. “Dressage tests.” 



“And that is?” Walker asks. 



“Exersises for training a war horse.” JJ shakes her head. 



“You know, I once saw May jump off a running horse onto a moving train.” Walker says. 



“I believe it.” JJ says. “She can get them to do all sorts of crazy shit.” 



“Is that one of her tricks?” Walker asks. 



“No.” JJ says. “No, Jim taught her to do that.” 



Justin swoops back in and lands on the pile of books. He has a pastry in his beak, which he begins to peck apart messily. Crumbs and frosting trickle down onto the books. 



“Well?” JJ says after a moment. 



“The fries are terrible.” Justin says. 



“Anything else?” JJ rolls her eyes. 



“Someone dropped their bearclaw.” Justin says. 



“I see that. How fortunate for you.” JJ says. “Did you see Adrian Kelsey?” 



“Nah, not his little creep, either.” Justin says. “Can I have some money?” 



“What do you need money for?” JJ asks.

So I thought I would just tell me experiences so far in my neighborhoods, the good and the not so good. Below is a lost of places I've snagged bags from with my personal view of them. Let me know if there's any other places you've tried or ask me anything about these places. No particular order.

1. Paris Baguette - If you can get it, it's phenomenal. Get 4 or 5 pastries usually but also have gotten sandwiches and fruit.

2. Whole foods- I go to 2 different whole foods. The seafood and refrigerator bag are my favorites. Prepared foods are hit and miss. Bakery is good (not a huge sweets guy so I stick to bakeries for my fix). Meat bag have mostly been shrimp and salmon (which is amazing). Meat bag has been prepared ""kevins"" meals and sausages. Floral bag is great,  as my wife loves have fresh flowers at home. 

3. Cupitol Coffee- Usually get 4 or 5 pastries. The best part is they let you pick them. 

4. Molly's cupcakes - Get there as early as possible to get your bag, as you get first choice of what is available. We usually get ones with 4 filled cupcakes (creme brulee is our favorite).

5. Eataly (so hard to get). The bakery bag is exhausted, just tons of focaccia bread. The made in eataly and pasta bags are awesome. Usually a lasagna or soups.

6. Stans donuts- it's alright, usually get 6 donuts but could be anything (I'm picky about my donuts). I just save my donuts days for Beacon doughnuts.

7. Bombay eats- Definitely do not get they value they claim, it's decent but usually just chicken swarma and a small big of veggies. Cheaper than buying off the menu but still short of claimed value.

8. Chip city- Is a steal, how there are always bags is baffling. You get 7 big cookies (sometimes some are filled). I buy these and bring them to work to share. Great buy.

9. Beatrix- Was worth it when they first got on the app but now they've dropped the value of what they put in. Last time it was a cookie and a salad, technically met their ""value"" but the salad was not great.  

I recommend this app to everyone but for the ""good stuff"" you have to be quick. I have 5 whole foods bag tonight I'm getting. I'll upload the loot tonight.",4,1763572787.0,toogoodtogo,3,0.67,False

(All values are approximate and normalized to 1 troy ounce ≈ 31.1 g)

⸻

Table: Purchasing Power of 1 Ounce of Silver Across Civilizations

Era / Civilization	Approx. Year	What 1 oz of Silver Could Buy	Evidence Basis
Early Bronze Age Mesopotamia	3000–2500 BC	~1,000–1,200 lbs (450–550 kg) of barley	Prices from Sumerian cuneiform tablets (silver used as account unit)
Old Babylonian Period	2000 BC	~300–400 lbs (135–180 kg) barley OR a month of skilled labor	Hammurabi-era price tablets
Late Bronze Age Egypt/Levant	1500 BC	~200 lbs grain OR several sheep	Amarna letters, grain-silver ratios
Neo-Assyrian Empire	1000 BC	~150–200 lbs barley; ~½ goat	Assyrian commercial tablets
Classical Greece	500 BC	~6–10 days of skilled labor OR 100–120 lbs wheat	Athenian wage & wheat price records
Roman Empire (High Empire)	1 AD	~1 month of soldier wages (denarius) OR 200–250 lbs wheat	Roman edicts & wage data
Late Roman / Diocletian Era	300 AD	~80–100 lbs wheat (inflationary era)	Diocletian Price Edict
Early Medieval Europe	1000 AD	~2 sheep OR ~100 lbs grain	English & Carolingian manorial records
High Medieval Europe	1200 AD	~1–2 weeks of artisan labor OR 10–12 chickens	Medieval price lists
Late Medieval (Black Death Era)	1400 AD	~2–4 weeks of labor (higher wages due to plague)	English wage-price compilations
Early Renaissance	1500 AD	~1–2 days’ unskilled labor OR 40–60 lbs bread	Florentine & English price archives
Colonial America	1700 AD	~1–2 days skilled labor OR 10–20 lbs sugar/coffee	Colonial commodity pricing
Early Industrial Era	1800 AD	~2–3 days labor OR 5–10 lbs tea OR basic tools	London bullion & commodity records
Gilded Age (U.S.)	1900 AD	~$1.30 purchasing power: 2–3 loaves of bread, 1–2 hours labor	U.S. historical CPI conversions
Late 20th Century	2000 AD	~$5 purchasing power: small meal or 2 gallons gasoline	Silver price ~$5/oz
Early 21st Century	2024 AD	~$25–30 purchasing power: 1–2 hours labor or modest groceries	Modern silver prices


⸻

📌 Key Takeaways
	•	Ancient silver had enormous purchasing power, often worth hundreds of pounds of grain.
	•	Wages in many eras were extremely low, so silver equated to large amounts of labor.
	•	Purchasing power steadily declined from antiquity → medieval times → modern era due to:
	•	population changes
	•	inflation
	•	industrialization
	•	silver mining booms (e.g., Potosí in the 1500s)
	•	decoupling from monetary standards

This post has two distinct purposes: 1.) to see if there is any interest among the lovely folks of this community and 2.) to ask for additional recommendations of how to spread the word.

1.)    I would like to (attempt to) run a [West Marches Campaign](https://arsludi.lamemage.com/index.php/78/grand-experiments-west-marches/) type experience using an adjusted format of the [Call of Cthulhu](https://cthulhuwiki.chaosium.com/rules/#player-roles) tabletop role-playing game (TTRPG). The version of the game that I have in mind is more in-line with Pulp Cthulhu (a more forgiving variant that focuses more on adventure), but with adjustments to the rules to make things more comfortable for players who either have a background in D&D or who are new to TTRPGs entirely (no meat-grinder here, at least to begin with…). The only restriction to player pool is requiring players to be 18 years of age or older.

 

The setting of this episodic and exploratory gameplay I have in mind is based on H.P. Lovecraft’s *At the Mountains of Madness*, which is a 1930’s under-explored Antarctica.

 

2.)    I have some flyers mocked up that I will be asking permission to post at various community style boards at college campuses, coffee shops, nerd stores (said as a nerd/lovingly), bars, and library branches. I have a designated email and depending on level of interest garnered, am planning on making/maintaining a discord server. Any other advice or ideas are to find interested people are appreciated!

1p1dhzn,https://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/1p1dhzn/some_of_the_hobbies_that_i_like/,Some of the hobbies that I like,"I watched the intense reaction of an extrovert being pranked by his friends pretending that he became invisible, and how another one on YouTube trying so hard to project shamelessly his needs on everyone desperately asking for acknowledgement by strangers in public places by greeting them and how happy they get when he initiates cringe chitchats with randoms. I picked a pattern there, those extrovert...and observed them from far away.

Most of them are adults whose brain stopped developing at the age of 7, but one of them expresses their need for acknowledgement with gaslighting others into believing they are the ones benefiting from this free angelic service they are providing. They walk to you as representatives of peace and love (\*cough\* cringe chitchats \*cough\*) but if you ignore that or just not into it, they quickly turn into a resentful mad kid. Turning from the good fella into little spawn of devil trying to do something they can't handle. And when I tell them this happens usually because this acknowledgement ""service"" they are providing is more about them not the others, the shit show turns into an episode of exorcism. And oh man how much I enjoy that! However, I got some abnormalies going on before and I almost got myself into some serious troubles. That's the punishment for not only trying to gaslight INTJs, but also using cheap tricks to do that. At least, do it in a way that I can learn something new from it. 

Then there are the ""Mom Dad look at me please"" extroverts who are asking for adoption in the street. I learned to spot them from far away. As soon as they see reserved introverts, they start wiggling their tails like a dog waiting for the master who has got a bunch of treats in the hand. I can only imagine it as a request for adoption from an adult. Yikes. But the thing is, it also turns into passive aggressiveness behind the back when I ignore it in a hurry. So I thought that I need take time ignoring this request. Making them feel like they are invisible for me is going to be fun and just the right punishment for stupidity that thinks it has the right to protest when it's not given what it wants. I make sure to get closer around them, but not too close. Contemplate carefully the air around them and the background behind it. Be it a wall, a coffee shop or anything...And my goodness. It drives them crazy...The panic and confusion...Asking me why am I starring at them while they are bothered why I am starring at everything around them but not them LOL. Wild reactions, like trying to get in the way of my insight...Yes! those are adults and I am not even exaggerating. They try so hard to enforce eye contact, but It just doesn't happen. When I manage not to giggle, I get some intense reactions but I just withdrawal when I see a mental breakdown about to happen for my own safety.

* $1518 total rent (incl. internet, trash valet, other fees)
* starting around end of January/early February until May 15, 2025, with the option to renew 

The apartment is on the 6th floor of a new building (2022, I believe) that has lots of community space to work on your laptop or hangout, a roof terrace with the most incredible view, a pool and sundeck, a great gym and lots of super cool events (if you like things like free breakfast, craft night, bingo at a bar etc.). Parking is also available (not included in my rent). Location is awesome, there’s coffee shops, bars and cool events in Central Park literally right around the corner. 

Apartment comes with huge bathroom that’s very new and very nice, a new kitchen with loads of storage space and new stainless steel appliances (think fridge with water filter, also a dishwasher), HVAC (though I didn’t have to turn the heat on yet!), tons of natural light because of huge windows (also best view in the building imo), high ceilings, washer/dryer in unit, and a lot of closet space. Management is incredibly nice and maintenance is super quick. My rent is $200-300 less than the units with the same floor plan currently for lease.

1p1ddhz,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHDUK/comments/1p1ddhz/running_out_of_medication_options_is_it_worth/,"running out of medication options, is it worth trying IR methylphenidate?(currently on Amfexa)","So I was diagnosed back in 2020 and immediately started on Concerta, which was effective however the side effects weren’t tolerable and sent me to a&e so it was a short run
Then tried Atomoxetine, which was probably my favourite in terms of improving ADHD symptoms but unfortunately gave me even more severe physical side effects(I now suspect based on my genetics i’m a CYP2D6 poor metaboliser as almost every medication i’ve had extremely bad reactions to happens to be predominantly metabolised by CYP2D6) 

Elvanse was a lot better but only after quite a bit of tweaking to get it to last long enough and avoid the crash, i seem to metabolise it quicker than most people and 60mg would still only be effective for 6 hours or so and i did notice my autistic traits becoming more difficult to deal with on it so i started struggling more socially

Then in 2023 I had to switch to Amfexa which initially seemed perfect, I don’t get any side effects from it and this is the one that made me feel the most calm however that became a problem and I needed dosage increases over time because i kept falling asleep on it(almost like it would do enough to calm my brain down but not quite enough for me to actually focus on things or feel motivated), at one point i had a fourth dose added to help me sleep at night because it was more effective for that than zopiclone even. I can nap on elvanse too which is interesting since I see more people complaining it keeps them awake at night(I think for me my ADHD is what keeps me awake at night so only being able to sleep listening to heavy metal music as a teenager makes sense to me now, even as a child I’d frequently drink coffee to help me sleep)

Now I’m mostly struggling with a lot of executive dysfunction and despite being on 20mg amfexa 3x a day, I can’t seem to get work done or stay organised but at least it helps my anxiety still

I’m hesitant to try IR methylphenidate after my experience with concerta but given that I had side effects on elvanse yet none on dexamfetamine, maybe it’s worth a try? Are there people that just respond better to IR in general? 

I think my only other hope is potentially convincing my NHS psychiatrist(who isn’t an ADHD specialist) to switch my antidepressant to bupropion as i’ve tried most of the usually prescribed ones over the past 14 years with no improvement. That one is a bit of a long shot I know, but I think I can potentially make a case for it especially since my consultant previously worked in the US where Vyvanse/Wellbutrin is a commonly prescribed combo that a lot of people do really well on

I also know one person prescribed off label modafinil for her ADHD because nothing else worked but my case is a bit different because everything has technically worked it’s just that nothings been effective enough without unbearable side effects

Apologies for the long post I just feel a bit hopeless and unsure if it’s worth risking the change to try ritalin basically

The lead singer enters stage left and the crowd breaks into cheers and applause. Benni looks him up and down and makes a face. He’s not particularly tall, rather gangly, with uniform tawny brown fur. He also looks like he’s been rolling around in the dirt. 



He takes a mic. ""What?""



""How'd you get so dusty?"" Benni asks. 



He looks down at himself, slaps his pants. A cloud of dust rises up and the crowd laughs. 



""I live on a dirt road."" He shrugs, then winks at the crowd, eliciting laughter and cheers. 



""And after his long, loooong, loooong ride down that dirt road to get here-""



Benni stops mid sentence and coughs, goes over to get a bottle of water and takes several swallows. Dusty rolls his eyes and motions ‘wanking it’. Benni returns to center stage, gives him a stern look, then raises a hand. “Two.. three…four!”



A little female Rycacian child, around five years old is standing at the window. It’s the middle of the night, the street lights are on but most of the houses are dark. Her name is Diesel, and she’s Dusty’s daughter. 



Dusty enters the room.  ""Hey, I thought you were supposed to be in bed.""



Diesel shakes her head absently. ""It's too loud.""



“Up here?” Dusty motions to her head, and she nods. He leaves briefly and returns with a pair of headphones. ""Do NOT tell Mommy I did this.""



He runs into his wife, Sophia, in the hall a minute later. ""Where have you been?"" 



""Up on Factory Road."" Dusty says. 



""Doing what?"" Sophia asks. 



""Fixin that old clunker Mac's dad left him."" Dusty says. 



Sophia groans. “Oh, come on. That piece of shit is never gonna fly again.”



Dusty shrugs. “Sure it will, it’s all mechanical. We can make parts.”

  


Several days later, the clunker is in repairs. It...does not look amazing. The ship is old, and it’s been allowed to sit in a barn for decades. But it was made by some human somewhere, and machines made by humans can be fixed. Human machines don’t care where something came from or what it’s made of, it’s about pushing and pulling and moving electricity from one place to another. You can cannibalize other machines, even replace parts with organic components, if it works it works. There are plenty of human machines around here, old cars and trucks and the occasional ship. 



They could theoretically just replace the mechanical components with organic ones, you can buy a kit that will supposedly do it from the Marasats. But it’s not just about having a working method of transportation, it’s about aesthetic. And besides, they all like the human tech, you can see what things do, and humans spend a lot of time documenting everything. There had been piles of paper instructions stashed in the cockpit repair box, apparently the human that made it had been sure to keep everything that came packaged with the components. 



It was legitimately a bit of a mess, everything that wasn’t made of metal had fallen apart and it’s definitely got some rust issues, but it’s far from a lost cause. Mac is the only one in his family who can understand any of the human languages without a translator, which is why he’d eventually been saddled with the ship. He’d just let it sit there for years, Vincent had a ship they’d been using, but he had to sell it earlier that year. Mac definitely wouldn’t try to go long distances, and theres no way its safe for actual space travel right now, but the engine does turn over and they’ve gotten her in the air a couple times.  



A beat up pickup bumps up along the road, Dusty gets out and pulls Diesel through the drivers side. 



""Well hey there, babydoll!” Mac takes the child. “You gonna hang with us today?""



“Yeah, Mommy had to go visit her sister for awhile.” Dusty says. 



They’ve been there for about an hour when Diesel gets Dusty’s attention. ""What's that, daddy?""



The adults all stop what they are doing and look where she’s pointing. Vincent slowly lowers the tool in his hand. ""Fuck me.""



Huge black worms are swarming toward them, moving incredibly fast. They topple and roll over trees, leaving slimy wreckage that emits a noxious chemical mist. There’s nowhere for the Rycacians to go but into the ship and hopefully up. The engine catches immediately and Vincent yanks the controls upward, the stabilizers aren't working correctly and they rock and shudder but the ship is able to rise and hover. There is a rough circle of destruction, structures collapse, something is on fire, vehicles tear away as people frantically flee the area. 



""What the everloving fuck!” Dusty says angrily. “Why are there so many of them? Where the fuck did they all come from!""



A few miles away, Benni is standing in front of her bar, a hand shading her eyes. She’d heard the alert go off and is now watching as emergency vehicles stream by in both directions. The affected area covers where Dusty lives, she’d tried to contact him but first gotten no answer and then a message that the system was temporarily down. Mac and Vincent hadn’t answered, either, she’d gotten hold of Rick but he was miles away at some symposium. 



These things, whatever they are, had started appearing a few years ago but have now become a massive problem. They seem to shake off most of what the Rycacians can throw at them, the response has been growing steadily more aggressive.



A particularly gnarly POS limps over and stall/lands in the lot behind the bar. Benni goes back to see if it's somebody she knows and is very relieved to find her missing friends. Mac takes Diesel, and they and Vincent go inside. 



""How bad is it?"" Benni asks. 



Dusty shakes his head. ""It's bad. BAD bad.""



An emergency siren begins to wail. Dusty grabs her hand and pulls Benni inside, slams the door. Ship engines roar overhead, followed by a thin mist of falling particulate.  



""Does that shit actually do anything?"" Benni asks. 



""Besides killing our kids?"" Dusty asks.



Benni looks over at Diesel, who is at the bar drinking a soda and kicking her legs in time with the drums of whatever is playing through the headphones. 



Dusty is being somewhat dramatic, the various chemicals they’re using tend to irritate mucus membranes and cause digestive upset and will make a kid thoroughly miserable for a day or two, but won’t kill them. Not even Diesel, who has a medical condition that her mother insists is severe. Benni isn’t sure about that, though. Not the part about Diesel having a diagnosis, that’s true and she was typically symptomatic when she was a little younger. She’s suspected for awhile, though, that quite a few of Diesels persistent ‘symptoms’ aren’t directly related to her illness. Sophia hovers over the child, treating her like she could break if someone breathed on her too hard, and had her on some sort of intense regimen of medicine and supplements and specialized exercises that were supposed to do…whatever. 



Dusty completely ignores the instruction sheets that are always pinned to the girl’s shirt, and follows what is actually medically best practice- which, for a child Diesel’s age, is to treat them as much like a normal child as possible. Dusty carries her around into the wastelands, bars, shows, and wherever else he wanders off to, and if he doesn’t have her in his arms or on his shoulders, one of the others does. This has led to the general assumption that the child has limited mobility or tires easily, but the truth is that the second anyone puts her down, she immediately finds something to get into. 



The door opens and a male human steps in, he’s wearing a uniform that marks him as belonging to ISTC, the organization aiding in the current extermination effort. He looks around, taking a head count, then leaves without saying anything. That isn’t surprising, most of them don’t speak Rycacian very well, and they’re too far from a base for them to assume the Rycacians here would speak a human language. 



Dusty has a keen interest in humans, but it’s focused almost exclusively on ancient Earth culture and the English language circa the 20th century. It is effectively a dead language, mostly used as part of historical reproductions or novelty acts. Most of the humans that come here, therefore, don’t hold much interest for him. There had been one he was very interested in for awhile before he met Sophia, nasty little thing, even for a human. She’d eventually been fired or thrown in jail or murdered or something. Good riddance to bad rubbish. 

  
  


Twenty years later…



A female officer is sitting in one of the generic security stations on Falcron Station with her feet up on a panel. Her name is May, she looks human and thoroughly bored. She sits up abruptly and leans forward, taps a display, Dusty’s ID from the system on Falcron comes up. May pulls his file, accesses the information for his transportation and looks at the ship specs, then footage of it from the landing bay. It’s a piece of shit, it’s amazing it even makes it up here. 



She taps the display several more times and pulls up the complete inspection report, then details of the ‘audio equipment’ and looks down the list. There are a few things that stand out, though they aren’t illegal, just odd. The guitars are made to accept ‘vintage’ equipment, there’s an adapter that is usually sold with them, it should just plug into some Rycacian organic audio mixer or something, or link to it without a cable. But they have the cables listed, and after a second she finds a few amplifiers. And here, the mics, most folks like these guys would use ones that look ‘vintage’ but aren’t, there are a bunch of different models available. These are real mics, though, ones with cables that will snake across the stage and get tangled between the legs of singers who aren’t careful. A list of ‘recording equipment’ contains what she would expect, the Rycacian audio capture devices, but there’s also an old rig that records via magnetic tape. They’ve got the standard drone setup listed, it looks like they have a dozen that operate largely autonomously, but they also have a camera that records on VHS cassettes. She spots a few other things, they seem to have collected quite a bit of ancient recording equipment of various types, the majority of it using magnetic tape. They aren’t using it, though, at least, when she runs though the stage equipment checklist, they aren’t on it. She supposes they could probably just hit record on one of these old boom-box style radio cassette rigs they have and it might not be on the list, but the quality would be horrible, and they’d still have to convert it. 



""Computer, will you bring up security footage from their last visit ordered chronologically, please?""



The screen goes black, then begins with the bay security cameras. 



“Spin on.” May says and the footage speeds up until she motions for it to return to normal speed. The drone security at Club Mango, following them as they go through the maze of backstage halls. They veer off when the band enters a green room and the footage switches to the show floor feed, the drones circling the stage and getting close ups of the band members. Dusty is absent, a drone finds him just off stage, talking to one of the dancers. 



May has the footage back up and slow down, gets a good look at the setup. It looks like the instruments and mics are vintage, but the cables run into modern audio equipment. She manages to catch a few frames of his kid sitting backstage at some sort of control setup, she’s got some adaptors rigged up to accept the audio input from the instruments and mics, but it looks like she’s using modern processing equipment as well. 



""Wake up!"" Someone jostles her seat hard enough to make May jump. 



""What!"" May twists around to find Rahal. 



Rahal is a security officer as well, though she’s considerably younger than May. She was assigned to Falcron a few years ago, and quickly became what the station supervisor referred to as May’s Minion. 



“He's hot, isn't he.” Rahal says. 



“Adam?” May asks. 



“Adam? Who’s Adam, wasn’t that…oh my GOD you KNOW him!” Rahal squeals. 



May grabs her arm. ""Shut up! You want everybody to know?""



""Kinda"" Rahal giggles. 



“Look, that was a really long time ago.” May says. 



“Did you just, like, know him socially or…” Rahal prompts. 



“I refuse to answer that question.” May says. “Don’t you have work to do?” 



""Sir, yes sir."" Rahal salutes and squawks like a chicken. 



It takes a very special sort of person to live and work long term on this particular station. Falcron was originally manufactured during eradication efforts on the planet below, controlled by ISTC, who regulates travel and shipping between planets, and a hospital. 



After the eradication, the station was expanded and is now largely dedicated to shopping and entertainment. There are around a thousand permanent residents, around half of which were displaced by the infestation. The expansion was done by Marasats, who were very well meaning in their attempts to create a pleasant human habitat but missed the mark slightly. 



The aesthetic modeling hides it in the civilian areas, but you’ll still start to see things that are just a bit off after awhile. The way things don't “start” and “stop”, they grow from each other, the way nothing ever seems to have a straight edge, the way the layout of the corridors doesn't actually make any sense. The material behind the manufactured panels is a network of glowing roots and bulbs that twitch and flash as signals run through. In the lower decks, it doesn't even look vaguely like a station anymore, just tunnels of flora occupied by Marasats and the occasional other bizarre life form. 



For some reason which has baffled everyone, the place is also home to a thriving colony of pigeons. They perch, nest, and poop where they like, and are impossible to get rid of. 



""Computer."" May says when she’s alone again. 



""Yes, Captain?"" The computer speaks in a soothing but no-nonsense female voice. 



""Oh, I like that one."" May says. ""What voice is that?""



""This voice is labeled ""Ship Computer Wife Classic"", Captain.""



""Do you always have to call me 'Captain'?"" May asks.



""Yes, Captain."" The computer says somewhat sarcastically. 



May makes a face. ""Fine, whatever. Can you look up this band, Factory Deal?""



""What would you like to know?""



“Let me see their finances.” May says. “That can’t be right. They’re flying around in a fifty year old hunk of junk, why would they…is it just aesthetic? Do they own properties or something?”



“Factory Road Productions, registered landowners.” A flyover comes up. 



It looks like it was an actual industrial facility at some point, and it's clearly out in the wastelands somewhere. It looks effectively inaccessible except by ship, surrounded by jagged canyons. She can see the remains of a road, it looks like there had been a bridge at one point but it’s either washed out or been destroyed some other way. 



“Do we have better footage?” May asks. 



The computer thinks for a few seconds, then begins to play various clips from interviews and music videos. There is definitely a professional feel to at least the interior of two of the buildings, but it looks like most of it has just been maintained enough to keep the weather out. 



“He’s got a kid, doesn’t he?” May asks. “Can you bring them up?” 



“Diesel, ‘Baby D’, age 25.” A video comes up. Diesel is on stage in front of a crowd, a banner behind her reads “Falcron Hospital Annual Benefit Concert”. She looks very much like her father, same solid tawny coat, same slight scruffyness, same big expressive movements. She’s very small, with a rather high pitched voice. 



At 25, she’s adult, but probably still living with her parents. They don’t tend to leave until they have a good reason, which is generally lack of space. Given the size of their facility, it’s likely anybody she’s involved with will end up moving out there. The Rycacians always live in groups, it’s very rare to see less than three at any given time.  



“When I was little, little little, I got sick, y’all. Bad. I thought I was gonna die. Everybody *else* thought I was gonna die. But then, the power of music cured me.” Diesel pauses to let the crowd react. “No, seriously, y’all, let's hear it for the excellent staff at Falcron Hospital, they save lives, please donate generously.”



May leans back, shakes her head slowly. “Computer, can you bring up IDs for the rest of the band, please?” 



They come up on the screen, Dusty, Vincent, Mac, Rick, and Benni. May taps Benni’s ID and looks at it, brings up more images. She’s pretty, May thinks, with an elaborate pattern of stripes and spots on her visible coat, her mane alternating between black, white, and silver gray. 



“Could she be…no. There’s no way.” May murmurs, shakes her head. “Computer, is Adam ma-” 



""Misuse of company resources!"" A male voice from behind her. 



May turns around to find Neil jabbing a finger in her face. He’s Falcron’s resident bureaucrat, and seems to have made a hobby of finding reasons to write May up. Doing so has absolutely no effect other than him occasionally receiving memos about excessive paperwork. 



""Oh, blow me."" May says. ""537B, Cornelia Robinson, refuses to clean up after her dog. You can catch her if you hurry, he's five million years old and it takes awhile for him to pop a-""



Neil throws his hands up. ""OK, ok, you don't need to look at the screens. Fine. That still doesn't make watching a show work related.”



“It might be, though.” May says. “You know anything about this ‘Dusty’ character?” 



Neil blinks at her in surprise. “The singer? I’ve heard they do a lot of charity stuff and he’s supposed to be pretty nice. Was that who you were looking at?”



“I knew him, about a million years ago.” May says. “We lost touch.”



“That is *super* not work related.” Neil says. 



“Well, no. But…look at that ship, and they apparently live in an actual, like, factory. Or what's left of one.” May says. 



“I mean, I think that's sort of their thing. They leaned into the post-apocalyptic vibe pretty hard.” Neil says. 



“But they get paid, right? The statements show transfers.” May says. “So where is it all going?”



Neil sighs and brings the records up. “Well, RCV and GER are both environmental restoration, GRNR and CRME are nature management, RBR and TWS are family and housing…looks like the last time they hit Mango the profits went to the hospital here on Falcron, here’s a couple that look like local clinics. I’d say offhand the most likely thing would be petty tax and fee evasion, hardly something nefarious and definitely not our jurisdiction."" 



“I saw him at Mango.” May says.



“Ok.” Neil says. “And he was flashing wads of cash?”



“No.” May laughs. 



“Then it was probably nothing. Get back to work.” Neil says. 



May had been at Club Mango last night to look at the stage, but had been called away to deal with a situation in another establishment. The place is closed for patrons this time of day, but the doors open automatically to let her in. She hasn’t seen it with the lights up since it was constructed. The ceiling is so high, it vanishes into shadow. The wall across from the main entrance is occupied by a large stage, three sections making a slight curve. Behind the center section, a rectangular scaffold extends thirty feet into the air. Several pigeons are sitting on it, more are scattered around on the support beams for the lights and effects. 



There is a Marasat crouched at a panel, messing with something.



“Hello.” May says. “What's your designation?”



“Code.” A mix of voices, male and female. 



“Do you like music?” May asks.



“Yes, we enjoy music.” The Marasat says. 



“Were you here for Factory Deal?” 



“Program 23 sequence 8.” The Marasat says. 



“Oh, for the stage?” May says. “Can I see it? Up close?” 



“Your clearance allows it.” Code says. 



A few minutes later, May is standing on a narrow platform, looking out over nothing. She’s taken off her shoes, jacket, and most of the random crap she carries around. 



The frame in front of her is completely empty. She had expected to see *something*, but there aren't even crossrails up right now. She reaches out and puts her hand through, nothing but air. 



“Activating.” Code says. 



The air shimmers slightly, like a heat mirage, and the pigeons fly away making disgruntled sounds. When May puts her hand out again, it gives slightly then becomes solid. She steps up onto the frame, then puts a foot out and tests the surface. It feels like a gymnastic mat, gives a little but obviously solid. She steps out onto nothing and walks across to the middle. 



“Three, two, one.” Code says. 



The invisible surface vanishes and May yelps as she drops sharply, convinced for a second she is going to splat on the floor below. She stops in the middle section. Just, stops. No surface to stand on, she can twist freely. Gravity gently returns, but now it's pulling her to stage left. She turns to orient herself, and her feet hit an invisible wall/floor. May kicks off and the gravity vanishes, returns to orient her toward the other side. 



She plays around until her radio beeps and she’s dispatched to break up yet another domestic dispute between Kevin and Brittany. As May is returning to her quarters later, she sees a band poster has been stuck to her door. Factory Deal, of course. It’s not for an upcoming show, though, or the most recent one. This poster is old, printed off at someone's house on paper that’s starting to yellow and crumble at the edges. 



In her quarters, May pokes the display screen at the bottom of her bed with a foot. “Hey, you got a discography for Factory Deal?”



“Sure, hun, got that right here for you.” The computer says. 



“Oh, that’s….which voice is that?” May asks. 



“It’s called ‘That One Lady Dontcha Know’.” The computer says. 



May shakes her head. “Play something.”



“This one’s called ‘Lady at the Fuel Stop’, hun.” 



May huffs a laugh. The tune is catchy, but the lyrics leave something to be desired. They’re mostly in Rycacian, with a few common and easily recognizable words and phrases in English- “sexy lady”, “pickup truck”, “pump my gas”. 



“What about something else? They have anything that's not hot chicks and fast cars?” May asks. 



“The title of this song is ‘Roof for Relaxing’, it's very popular, dontcha know.” That One Lady says. 



The lyrics of this one are certainly more interesting, telling a somewhat rambling story in which the band repeatedly receives noise complaints from irritated neighbors which eventually devolve into a feud, riot, and May thinks the universe might explode at the end. 



The door opens and Rahal comes in. “What's that?”



“Your favorite band.” May says. 



“Play a video.” Rahal says. 



“Sure, hun, which one you want?” The computer asks. 



“Do you have one from Blue Star?” May asks. 



“Sure, hun. Here you go.”



Blue Star is on Rycacia, May had picked it because she knew he used to play there. The place has obviously undergone some renovations and updates, but it’s still only big enough for maybe two hundred people. The house lights are on low, even though the stage lights are fully up. Most of the patrons are standing close to the stage. The band is already up there, sans Dusty who comes out fashionably late. He starts talking to the crowd, getting down at the edge of the stage to pass things back and forth. Rahal is listening to his schtik, which is quite entertaining, but May is watching Dusty closely. After awhile, Benni breaks up the socializing and they start playing music. Dusty is dancing around with the mic, getting up close with the other band members, making eye contact and gesturing to the crowd. They’re obviously all just having a good time out there. 



“That looks like fun.” Rahal says. 



“Yeah, little local shows are awesome.” May says. “These ones up here are nice and all, but it’s all on such a tight schedule. Those places, you can just fuck around up there until the owner kicks you out.”



They’ve stopped playing, and Dusty is addressing the audience again. “I was down in Hangdog the other day. You guys know where that is?”



May leans forward and frowns. 



A smattering of applause. Dusty points and waves at them. “Hey, y’all! How's your mom n ‘em?” Laughter, someone shouts an answer, more laughter. “Oh, well when they get out the hospital you tell them that's why we don't drink n drive. So I was out there, five million miles from nowhere, cause my dear old Mama lives there.”



The audience makes cooing sounds and he waves them off. “Oh, no, y’all, she ain't that kind of mama. No, no, she’s great though, seriously. Anyway, I was down there and she told me, she said ‘Son, I don’t like your music.” The audience laughs as Dusty arches an eyebrow. “Right? She said ‘Son, I don't like your music but there must be something to it because they play it on the radio here. All. The. Time.” The audience cheers. “And she turned on the radio and goddamn, ‘Road Home’ was on!” He lets the audience react for a few seconds, then talks over them. “And I said, that's just a fluke and she said ‘oh, no, this is *request only*. So if anybody from over there is watching, we appreciate it, guys.”



“Est-ce que ça va?”?” Rahal asks. 



May doesn’t turn from the screen. “Fine, why?”



“You’ve been kind of…” Rahal hesitates. “Interested in Dusty.”



“It’s nothing.” May says. “How much do you know about him?” 



“I mean, I read tabloids sometimes.” Rahal says. “Apparently he has trouble with women, can’t imagine why.” 



“He’s always broke, for one.” May says. “Money goes in one hand and right out the other, always has, looks like it still does.” 



“He does…like…girls, right?” Rahal asks. 



“As far as I know, why?” May asks. “Are you interested?” 



“Me? No, that’s…they’re hot and all, but…” Rahal shakes her head. “They’re a little…furry…for me, I think.” 



“That’s fine, you don’t have to want to fuck them.” May says. “You can like the way someone looks in a not-sexy way, that’s OK.”



“He’s, like, *with* Vincent, though, isn’t he? Like, it says stuff about him dating and shit but…” Rahal says. 



“I don’t know him anymore.” May says. “I have no idea. What about other stuff?”



“Didn’t he get arrested for environmental terrorism or something?” Rahal asks. 



“That was a long time ago, and he didn’t get arrested.” May says. “He got questioned because he was in the wrong place at the right time.”



“I thought Vincent had to sell his ship to bail him out.” Rahal says. 



“Nah, they got rid of it because it was costing them an arm and a leg to maintain. Those things look great but break down all the time, and you have to get them fixed at a dealer.” May says. “I was there for that.”



“Security to Deck 12 for a…disturbance.” The dispatch comes in, stopping their conversation. “126 and Oak.”



Deck 12 is lower rent civilian shopping, and designed to look like a street with storefronts. The ceiling is made of video panels, theoretically they’re supposed to show a view of a sky but the powers that be like to play random but aesthetic footage. Right now, it’s a mass of pink jellyfish. A group of people have gathered in front of two businesses, they can hear female voices shouting at each other, presumably the owners of said businesses. One is a pet store, the other sells herbal remedies. 



“Arrest her!” The pet store owner screams when she sees the officers. “She’s killing my babies!”



“Ma’am…” May says. 



“She’s crazy!” The other woman shouts. “The smell of imitation chocolate can not poison her dogs!”



“What about the other stuff! It’s toxic to animals! Your tea is killing my fish!” Pet Store lady screams. 



“Are you dumping it in the tank?” Tea Lady retorts. 



“Y’all…” May groans. 



“She has to move!” Pet Store Lady insists. 



“You move!” Tea Lady snaps back. 



“How many of your animals are dead?” May asks. 



“Well, none yet but…” Pet Store Lady admits. 



“And you’ve both been here how long?” May asks. 



“Five years, but…” Pet Shop Lady says. 



“So, you want me to arrest her for not killing your animals for five years?” May asks. “I’m confused.”



“The fumes are bad for them!” Pet Shop Lady says. 



“So, you have veterinary documents for their health issues?” May asks. 



“I don’t sell animals with health issues!” Pet Shop Lady says, affronted. 



“Ah, so you put them down.” May says. “Do you have the reports on hand, or does Millie still have them down in the morgue?”



“That’s disgusting!” Pet Shop Lady says. “My animals are all in excellent health, I don’t need to have them euthanized.”



“So, there is literally no problem here aside from you don’t like the way it smells.” May says. 



“I’m allergic to-” Pet Shop Lady starts. 



“Stop.” May says. “If you’re having medical issues, go to the hospital. Otherwise, deal with it.”



May turns to Tea Shop Lady. “Do you have anything in there that would hurt her animals?” 



“I suppose coffee isn’t good for them.” Tea Shop Lady says. “But it’s never hurt any of mine.”



“No peppermint oil or anything?” May asks. 



“The Marasats don’t like it.” Tea Shop Lady says. 



“You burn incense?” May asks. 



“Certainly not.” Tea Shop Lady says. 



“Ok, I’m gonna give the two of you a choice. There’s an empty store two blocks down. Either you figure out how to get along here, or one of you is moving. I’m gonna give you a few days to decide between yourselves, but if I hear anything else about this I’m gonna flip a coin and the loser relocates. You don’t like that, I’m gonna ticket both of you for disorderly.” 



The women grudgingly go back into their respective businesses. The crowd seems to agree overall with the tea shop owner, some follow her but none of them go into the pet store. A drone that had been circling flies away in search of something else interesting. 



They get called over to the commercial shuttle area, where May has to explain that a llama is not “carry on” and would at the very least need it’s own ticket. Then to deck 9, where Kevin and Brittany are duking it out yet again. 



“Holy fuck, you guys, just get a divorce!” May shouts as she and Rahal approach. 



This place is supposed to look like a subdivision, which means the houses have individual roofs with the ceiling above them. The video panels here are showing an actual sky right now, a red sunset with golden clouds. Brittany is on the roof, looking very dramatic against the backdrop. 



“Look, baby, I told you, I didn’t let her borrow it, she-” Kevin dodges a shoe. “Stole it.”



“Who stole what?” May asks. 



“Monica took my Roamer.” Kevin says. 



“Did you file a report?” May asks. 



“Not yet, it just happened like thirty minutes ago. That’s why I’m late.” He raises his voice and directs the last part at Brittany. 



“ISTC dispatch, we have a report of an accident. Ship has impacted the station in quadrant 847, no injuries reported. Pilot appears intoxicated.” The voice comes in through May and Rahal’s radios. 



May puts a finger against her ear, a visual cue that she’s activated her radio and isn’t talking at nothing. “Dispatch, can you give me the make and model of that ship and the driver’s name?” 



“DelMade Roamer, model f38. Pilot is Monica Fremmel.” Dispatch responds. 



“Well, she just crashed your ship.” May says to Kevin. 



“Shit, no! I just paid it off!” Kevin wails. 



“Put in a claim with ISTC. They’ll cover stolen vehicles here.” May says. “You can probably get a pretty decent payout if you include pain and suffering. I’ll say you and Brittany both appear distressed.” 



Brittany climbs down from the roof and comes up to comfort her husband. They go back into the house together, May makes a rude hand gesture after they’ve closed the door. 



“You ever just want to smack someone?” May asks. 



“All the time.” Rahal says. “Don’t you get tired of this?”



May shrugs. “It’s not all that I do, you know.”



“Yeah, you sit around and watch security video and read passenger manifests and shit.” Rahal says. 



“Yep.” May says. “I am a nosey bitch.”



“Are you, like, investigating Dusty or something?” Rahal asks. 



“No, can you please just drop it?” May says. 



“So, you’re just watching videos and stuff for entertainment? I thought you didn’t like their music.” Rahal says. 



“I didn’t say that.” May says. “Their music is fine.”



“You like it.” Rahal says. 



“Fine, yes, are you happy now?” May rolls her eyes. 



She does actually like the music, that’s true. And she does like watching him on stage, they put on a good show. But now, Falcron seems to keep nudging him into her awareness again, band posters on the walls, music in a random store, reminding her to talk to the dancers at a time when she wouldn’t be able to help but see him in Mango. This place can talk to you, both in words and with actions. Once you get below the functional decks, down to the part where the Marasats live…well, things down there don’t work the way humans expect them to. 



They pass a merchant stall set up on the side of the civilian walkway, a Rycacian with an extremely puffy mane is selling bootleg merch. Among badly translated phrases in various languages and licensed character knockoffs is a shirt for Factory Deal. May stops and pulls it out, the merchant notices their uniforms and immediately starts stammering. 



“Gimmie the shirt and I forget about you.” May says. 



“Yeah, yeah, it’s yours. Gift from me for our hard working police force.” The merchant says, then hastily pushes his cart away. 



Rahal rolls her eyes. “You’re not allowed to accept bribes.” 



“No bribery here.” May says. “You heard him, hard working police, that’s me.”



“What, I don't work hard?” Rahal asks. 



“Here.” May hands her the shirt. “Careful if you wash it or the decal will come off.” 



There is a horse and cart coming down the walkway. Or, what looks like a horse, this one is actually a machine. Horses can survive on Rycacia and there are some down there, but large animals are generally dissuaded on the station due to the amount of waste they produce. The pigeons might be happy about the horses’s leavings, but nobody else would. One of the idiot birds has made a nest between the mock-animal’s ears and is riding there, looking around like it’s a homecoming queen. The cart looks like something from an old western, with a slogan painted in bright red across the sides, “Doctor K’s Curing Solution- all natural- tastes great- safe for children”. May rolls her eyes, all that is true, since it’s basically just sugar water with some electrolytes. It probably does make you feel better, it’s easy to get dehydrated up here, but it’s definitely not worth the exorbitant price. 



The “Dr K” brand is desperately trying to recoup it’s losses, though. It’s now owned by ‘PowerHydration Super Good Liquid Drinks Company’, who spent a lot of money only to find out the formula they had purchased was one hundred percent illegal everywhere that can grasp the concept of “toxic”. The bottles themselves are pretty nice, which is probably what they’re really selling in the end. Once they finally run out, it’s unlikely they’ll go to the trouble to produce more. ",1,1763572062.0,HangDogCityLimits,0,1.0,False

Disclaimer: If you don’t believe in love work or don’t have advice related to what I’m specifically asking, please just keep scrolling. Every witch has their own beliefs and boundaries, and I’m comfortable with the work I’m doing. I’m only looking for guidance from people who understand or practice similar work.

-I’ve been practicing for about four years, i do divination before spells
- I’m currently working on reconciling with a past partner. Our ending was very abrupt and unwanted
-We’ve been in off and on communication for the past four months and had our most recent conversation last night.

For our connection, I made a sweetener jar
(includes honey, coffee grounds, sugar, lavender, his necklace initial, a written petition and sigil, bay leaf ash with a petition written on it, moon water, cinnamon, ginger, rose, jasmine, rose oil, cinnamon oil, chamomile oil, and dill. I sealed it with red wax and burned a red candle over it.

I’m not sure if any sweetening has happened yet, and I’m trying to understand where my block might be coming from. I did a block buster and a communication spell simultaneously recently. I did receive communication afterward, so something definitely moved, but I still feel like something is resisting.

This person is avoidant and has told me they’ve thought about coming back many times. They’ve said they’re in a very bad place without me, but that our past petty arguments make them feel like I would never forgive them or feel comfortable with them again, which is not true at all.

I’ve done reconciliation work before making the jar, but I think I need some insight or outside help. If anyone can see what I might be missing, or if you know any trustworthy witches or Etsy practitioners who take spellwork seriously and are easy to hire, I’d really appreciate recommendations.

Thank you so much.

As you know, Weddings (whether in the US or international) have their own trend cycles. The biggest shift in 2025/2026 DW planning is moving from a ""wedding day"" to a ""wedding week"", and making every moment count for your traveling guests. Your loved ones are spending significant time and money to celebrate with you, so making their experience more curated and fun is the new top priority.

I've gathered the most impactful trends focused purely on making your guests feel immersed in the experience.

You went through all the effort of gathering a group in an international vacation together. Instead of sitting by the pool all day, organize some small but fun activities that feel authentic to the destination. Some ideas can be completely free of charge like a pickleball, ping pong, or volleyball tournament with the guests. Want something less active? Try a private Taco and Tequila tasting for the group. A little more romantic? A sunset catamaran is always a special addition. The goal is to facilitate natural mingling among the different friend groups before the wedding day.

To make guests feel special upon arrival, DW couples have started getting more creative with weaving local culture into welcome gifts for the guests. Think custom curated local spice blends, possibly local coffee/chocolates, or even a candle/oil diffuser with the hotel's signature scent to bring them right back to the trip when they get home. If you're in a especially hot destination, think about a personalized fan to keep your guests cool during events.

Another way to enhance guest experience from the jump is being intentional with Guest Communication. As an advisor, I begin this with a Wedding Website that provides all the information guests need for booking. With my contact information on the website, guests are immediately able to feel like they have a personal concierge to ask questions and make changes (taking all this stress off you as the leaders). I love to customize my sites to include all additional activities and timelines that are important for guests. All DW guests I assist get a customized travel itinerary includes group events, travel logistics (immigration info, tipping guide, transportation details), and timelines again to prepare them right before travel. In addition, What's App is a great way to send live updates to guests during the trip, like a ""heads up, the wedding is in 30 minutes!"" to avoid any mishaps.

There are so many ways to make a DW feel personal to the group. I truly believe being intentional prior to the trip and adding finishes like these lets the guests know how much you appreciate them. Discussing this with your Travel Advisor can be an amazing way to get ideas and turn them into the fondest memories.",1,1763572022.0,WeddingTravelAdvisors,0,1.0,False

It’s also across the street from an office building and a hotel. Everything is within a 5-minute walk.

This is in one of the more expensive parts of town, so the area has a lot of residents and workers who are willing to pay for convenience. The 400-unit building doesn’t have any vending machines, and I’m still checking whether the high-rise, office building, or hotel have mini-marts or vending options.

The closest competition is a Kroger about a 15-minute walk away, and you have to cross a busy intersection to get there. 
There is also a couple restaurants ($20-$50 range) on the ground floor of the apartments and a coffee shop so I wouldn’t consider them direct competition

1p1d6yc,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1p1d6yc/blood_in_the_water_pt14_the_ichor_pit/,Blood in the Water Pt.1/4 The Ichor Pit,"On the first day, there were likely only a few drops of blood, not even enough to be noticed by any of the tourists or fishers that frequented our placid lake. Following that, a thin trickle that would've dispersed before it had the opportunity to climb to the surface. Day by day, more and more of the crimson liquid was released, tainting the otherwise crystaline waters; or at least that is what everyone in town believed. It otherwise seemed unfeasible for the clear water of such a large pool to become so murky and wretched over the course of a single night.

Ever since the spring closed up, business had been miserably slow, so I didn't learn about the milky red water until today. On Saturday mornings, I normally dusted all the rarely used equipment and sanitized the regulators and facemasks that had been used or would be needed for the weekend. No one had booked any dive lessons or tours in the past week and a half, and my phone hadn't even thought about ringing with potential clients, so I was slacking on my duties this morning.

 I had barely made a dent in the coffee swirling in my novelty Alexandria Springs mug when there was a polite but forceful knock on the front door. Had I forgotten to unlock it when I came in? I allowed myself one final drink of the coffee before hustling across the small shack towards the door. 

""Jay? You in there?"" A familiar, gruff voice belonging to the shadow darkening my door called through the closed entryway. It was Michael, a park ranger at the Springs who I drank with occasionally.



""Mike, Hey. Everything all right?"" It was extremely uncommon for any of the rangers to show up at my humble little shop - usually only coming by if they needed someone to retrieve a precious item or animal body out of the lake.



""Heard what happened?"" I simply shook my head when he asked, quirking my brow inquisitively. ""Whole lakes gone red. Saw a bit yesterday, but thought some fish may have got at it. This morning though...""



""And you were hoping I'd dive and figure out what is going on?"" I finished his thought before taking a long sip from my coffee. Had it been anyone other than Mike asking for this favor, I wouldn't have believed them, but Mike was a straight shooter. He was a grumpy old Afghanistan vet who didn't like to waste his time on pranks or games; it was the whole reason he had picked up a job as a ranger in the first place. Poor guy just wanted to take it easy in retirement, but now he deals with petty camper problems almost daily.



After a moment longer of deliberation, I sighed and nodded. Mike looked exceptionally relieved when I told him I'd get down there in the next twenty minutes or so, and we separated. He hopped into his pickup to head back to the park, and I retreated into my office to collect the gear I would need. Since the water was likely contaminated with an animal body, I would need my dry suit and full face dive mask; two items I generally disliked diving in.



As promised, I was pulling through the front gate of the park in just under fifteen minutes, equipped with all of the tools I thought I would reasonably need and two one hour tanks. Sandra was at the booth and waved me through as soon as she saw my Van. On the opposite side of the little wooden shack was a line of loaded SUVs, minivans, and pickup trucks trying to leave. Had the rangers emptied the park, or were the campers just fleeing of their own volition?



The answer to my question awaited me at the beach, as a gaggle of less fearful visitors swarmed around the ranger vehicles. The youngest ranger, Dave, stood atop one of the trucks trying to command the herd of people with a megaphone, barely keeping them out of the water. The rangers seemed to be having no luck with clearing a space for me to pull up to, at least until Mike started shouting. The commanding presence he carried required no amplification to get everyone's attention, and shortly after he began to cry out, a large space beside the retention wall was cleared away.



That was the first time I got to see the water.



This pool was about three hundred feet wide, four hundred feet long, and stretched nearly forty-five feet down at the deepest point. Roughly a year ago, the natural spring in the deepest part of the lake suddenly seemed to seal off - we expected the water levels to recede and the flow of the river to slow heavily, however, neither of those things happened. The river flowed the same as it always had, the pool remained crystal clear, and the water temperature never rose past seventy-three degrees. The only reason this was ever even noticed was because I had been diving to take new photos of the vent for the campground's informational billboards. When I had descended fully into the depths, the crevice was simply missing, covered with sand as though it had never been there in the first place.



Rusty was the best term I had to describe the color of the water. It was also cloudy, as though something had kicked up the sand and silt that covered the floor, yet this time it simply wasn't settling. The sun was just breaching the tops of the mangrove trees that bordered the cove, its orange rays painting sections of the water a  much brighter shade of crimson. Sunrise on the beach was usually peaceful, but today, everyone only felt unnerved. From where I stood atop the stone wall, I couldn't see any of the usual signs of life that typically decorated the spring. The reeds where the alligators made their nest were still; there were no ripples in the water from the tiny fish that darted around, and all of the birds were festooned amongst the trees instead of trying to catch breakfast.



The crowd of spectating campers pressed forward like a crushing flesh wall, murming questions and statements at me or towards each other. Even the shouted words didn't quite reach my ears, arriving only as shattered fragments of speech. I chose to ignore them, instead focusing on slipping into my diving gear. Dave and Chris put themselves between the crowd and my van, giving Mike the opportunity to approach and speak privately.



""Can't thank you enough for this. I tried to get on the horn with the park services, but the calls weren't going through, radio shit the bed too."" It was a sobering statement to realize that we were essentially cut off from the rest of the world. The prospect of diving into an unknown substance suddenly seemed much more terrifying, and it made the lake that I grew up playing in seem far more alien and hostile.



""Yeah, don't mention it. Not like there's anyone else who could do it."" I was the only person with the experience to take this dive in at least a hundred miles. During the summers, my brother and his son would typically come help out at the shop, but this year they had gone off to dive in the Maldives. While I did enjoy their company, I didn't mind their absence since there wasn't much money to split this year. Now, though, as I am being forced to venture into the crimson abyss, I desperately wish one of them were here.



Mike offered a soft smile and a gentle, reassuring pat on the shoulder, which did absolutely nothing to warm the growing Ice in my stomach. Without anything else to say to stall, I slipped the mask over my head and started down the steps into the water of the lake. There didn't seem to be any difference in the water as I ambled into it, but then again, I couldn't feel much through the neoprene material.



I hand-carried my fins for the first fifty feet or so, as the gradual decline didn't deepen quickly enough for me to swim. Through the suit, at this distance, I couldn't hear the beach anymore. Isolated. There wasn't a time that I could remember where I had felt so alone.



Hesitantly, I lowered into the water in a vaguely seated position, tugging and pulling at my fins until they slipped over my boots. I really should've sealed off my mask first; it would've made the whole maneuver much easier, but I managed to equip the last piece of gear without dipping below the water. Quickly, I ran through my checks, ensuring all of my buckles and straps were fastened tightly and that my gear was secured. I wasn't bringing much down with me - just an underwater camera which was attached by cord to my wrist, and a dive knife tucked neatly into a holster on my calf. Finally, I pulled the mask down over my face, tightened the straps to make sure it was sealed, and checked my breathing. The pressure gauge was nominal, and I didn't feel like I was struggling to breathe.



I wanted to feel excited about this dive; it should have been thrilling. This was probably my one and only chance to experience something that no other human ever had, but I couldn't get the fear out of my mind. With a final thumbs up towards the rangers on the beach, I plunged face-first into the unknown.



The murky water above was a warning about what awaited below the surface, with extremely poor visibility. I couldn't see more than an arm's length ahead of me, which meant that my journey would be agonizingly slow and would feel suffocating. I focused on pulling myself along the bottom of the water, kicking gently and trying not to disturb the sand any further. Beneath me, littering the pure white sand were copious fish corpses, all sharing the same pallid green color. Nothing seems to have escaped the cold clutches of death as minnows shared their Graves with bluegills, trout, and the occasional gar. Would I be joining them? One misstep is all that it would take for this place to become my watery resting place; that thought alone was enough to make me question whether I had properly secured my gear or not.



I drew up the camera, got as close as I dared to the fish, and snapped two photos, one with the flash on and one without. With the poor quality of the water, I wasn't exactly hopeful that either picture would clearly show its subject. Aside from bringing one back, there wasn't anything else I could do but continue swimming forward.



The murk seemed to lessen as I reached the lip of the spring's sunken cove, but the reddened color of the water darkened. Now it wasn't the color of rust, it was a darker and richer maroon. I paused over the now inactive boil and just peered into the depths. The light from the sun wasn't in the right position to fully illuminate the gulch, leaving the source of the color a mystery. Even though I had been to the bottom of this gorge over a hundred times and knew it like the back of my hand, it felt otherworldly and wrong. Occluded by shadow and thick snaking strands of maroon smoke, there appeared to be something at the precipice of its depth. I flicked on the dull light on my mask and began to crawl down the edge of the rock, using it as an anchor and a guideline.



The yellow beam of my light helped carve my way into this darkness, but not enough. I wasn't sure how much light would have been enough to calm my nerves. The rocks were slick as though they were coated in algae, even in places where there was none. My light finally illuminated the figure at the bottom of the water, its scales glinting dully as the headlamps' beam washed over them. The alligator didn't react as my searching beam connected with its form. Similarly, I froze.



Everything I had been taught by my old man was to give Alligators space, especially if you found yourself in the water with one. Gators could hold their breath for hours, much longer than both of my air tanks combined.



Maybe it was dead? Everything else in the water seemed to be; what if this was the cause of the discoloration? If that were the case, I could wait days, and it wouldn't move. Against my better judgment, I needed to try and get closer. If I could just descend a few more feet, maybe I'd be able to catch a shot of the creature on the camera. Then I would have a much better idea of whether it was alive or not.



Each inch that I pulled myself closer added five more thumps to my heart rate, until it trembled like the rattle of gunfire. I didn't dare to get any closer than fifteen feet, hopeful that it would be close enough to get a clear photo. The reptile still hadn't moved, still seemingly slumbering peacefully in the sandy depths. On its forehead, just between the eyes, it seemed to have a gash wound, but it must have been old, as I didn't see any fresh blood weeping through. While the statue-esque figure wasn't leaking any red, I did find what I believed to be the source of the corruption.



Directly in front of the snout of the alligator was a slashed open slit in the sand, the length of my arm, with fleshy protrusions clinging to the edges of the site. This was where the color was darkest. Flowing freely from the gouge in the Spring's bottom was a deep brownish-red liquid. The way the vapors wisped through the water led me to believe that it wasn't just some colored water. In fact, I was uncomfortably familiar with the way that this ichor floated. It mirrored blood leaking from a cut, dancing and curling through the water, nudged along by the currents.



I struggled to pull the camera up to my face, vaguely peeping through the viewfinder to ensure that my subject was in frame. One click, one flash, one startled beast. The old wound on his head splintered open to reveal a third eye, which instantly snapped onto me. Before I had a moment to even consider reacting, the ambush predator launched straight up, blistering past me towards the top of the water before falling still again. Its body lulled to the side, fully capsizing so that the newest eye could keep watch over me from high above. I was now at an impasse. I was reluctant to descend to the bleeding spring, and I certainly did not want to swim up and risk another encounter with the unusual alligator. After a moment of further thought, I found it in my best interest to descend anyway. Despite how disconcerting the experience, I was sent to investigate the source of the crimson pool.



Swiping through the water, the cold blood curdled through my fingers, staining all of the parts of the dive suit it touched. My knees hit the sand next to the peeled fleshy segment and I brought the camera up again, making sure to catch a few shots of the source of liquid. Then, I stowed the device and equipped my dive knife. The last thing I wanted to do was poke and prod at the anomaly with my hands. An extension of myself, the dive knife prodded into the wavering strands of seaweed like flesh, effortlessly tearing through. Next, I stabbed at the center of the wound, praying that the flesh wouldn't try to grab my hand like some kind of demented Venus flytrap. My knife scraped and gouged against the soft stony substance, and I continued to scrape and pull until a small wedge of rock came away. I collected the rock, sliced a piece of flesh, and began to slowly ascend.



The silhouette of the malformed alligator still hovered threateningly above me, but as I ascended, it began to descend. As I clung to one side of the gorge, it similarly crawled down the opposite rock wall. We passed by each other with little more than raucous anxiety. Clutching my trophies, I darted back towards the shore, collecting two of the deceased fish on the way.



It was a far faster journey back to the edge of the waters as I only needed to pause to pull my fins off my feet. Striding up the stone stairs to the top of the retaining wall, I was met with expectant campers and towel-carrying rangers. The latter group helped ensure the seams around my mask were dry and free from the strange liquid before I pulled it off.



""Dave! Take his camera and go get those pictures printed off."" Mike commanded, causing Dave to take the camera in a towel and rush towards the ranger station just up the hill. ""What did ya see?""



""What's going on with the water? Are we going to get refunds if we can't use the amenities?"" Before I had the opportunity to respond to Mike, a middle-aged woman with a blonde bob stepped forward and demanded. Clinging to her side was a pudgy child muttering something about wanting to swim, wearing a pair of inflated cartoon floaties and thin goggles.



""Ma'am, please join the other campers on the other side of the vehicles."" There was a frustrated edge to Mike's voice, clearly present beneath the customer service voice he tried to put on. ""We don't know what's going on right now. If you would like a refund for your unused days, please speak with Cindy at the station just up the hill.""



""My unused days?! No, this has soured my whole vacation, and I want all of my money back! Don't make me call the forest services!"" She berated my friend, complete with a pointed finger wiggling and wagging towards his gray-bearded face. I stood by awkwardly, holding onto my wretched prizes from the heart of the lake, not wanting to do anything to excite the situation any further. But I wouldn't have to.



As the mother cried rage to Mike, her child darted from behind her leg, aiming to leap off the retaining wall into the shallow water. Mike and I both reacted, far faster than the child's own mother. Mike reached him first, catching the child just as his feet had left the wall's lip. However, as Mike shoved the child back into the mottled sands, he went teetering over the edge. I tried to catch him, but fell short, our fingers narrowly missing each other. I turned to yell at the woman to get back, but she was already gone, dragging the ten-year-old into the crowd of now horrified onlookers.



Mike was flat on his back in the water, coughing and sputtering and choking out whatever liquid had gotten into his mouth. It was only a four-foot drop into two feet of water, but that was still enough for him to hit the bottom and be temporarily submerged. There was terror in his eyes as he realized exactly what had happened; it was a look I hadn't seen on anyone's face before.

In a panic, he pulled himself up to a sit and then scrambled to climb up the rough stone wall, reaching out for assistance. I caught his hand and dragged him up the edge of the wall, both of us disregarding the stairs just a few feet to his left.

Once he finally clambered over the top of the wall, the look of fear in his eyes melted and gave way to dread. He opened his mouth to ask for help and collapsed, face down in the sand, the pleading look frozen in place.

I’m new to Dhaka and settling in for work, and I’d really like to meet some new people here — both socially and for good conversation.

A little about me (without getting too specific):
I’m originally from India and I work in the fashion/luxury retail & business consulting space. My work takes me between a few countries, and now I’ll be based in Dhaka for a while. I enjoy discussions around design, entrepreneurship, travel, culture, and anything intellectually interesting.

Outside of work, I’m quite social — I like exploring cafés, trying new food spots, weekend trips, and meeting people who have a positive mindset and are open to good conversations.

I’m hoping to connect with educated, like-minded people in Dhaka — men or women — who enjoy hanging out, grabbing a coffee, dinner, or just meeting new people in the city. I’m open to building a small circle of friends here (and who knows, maybe even meeting someone special 😄).

Location: staying around the Gulshan/Banani area.
If anyone’s interested in connecting, feel free to DM — happy to chat first before meeting.

Looking forward to connecting with some good people here!

I got diagnosed with hypothyroidism and Hashimoto's in April. Four other family members have it. My TSH at time of diagnosis was 14. I started Synthroid, had a terrible intolerance to it and went off. Went hyperthyroid as the starting dose an inexperienced doctor gave me was 75mcg which was way too high. In August, I started 13mcg Tirosint. All good. Started feeling better IMMEDIATELY, even though I was super cautious and only took two a week to start out. Went up to taking 13mcg every day about two months ago. My TSH went down to 11, then 7.5 where it is now. Well, about two weeks ago I started mixing in 25mcg Tirosint on alternating days, taking 12mcg every other day. And three days ago started taking 25mcg every day. But I don't feel better. Strangely, I feel more sleepy than before. This was happening sometimes before, but generally I crash around 6pm and am too fucking tired to even get up and do the dishes. It completely sucks. I am so tired of being tired!!! And another thing, I piss all the time. LIKE ALL THE TIME. Like more than twenty times a day. Some of this was due to coffee intake and I'm trying to decrease that. But this happened when I first went on 13mcg too. My new doctor said that should go away after a few weeks -- it's my body adjusting to a higher metabolism again. But I have a little belly fat again, which is weird because it had gone away when I first started 13mcg. What's going on??? I want my TSH to get down to 1, 2. It's at 7.5 now. I'm still tired as fuck and feeling even more sleepy (weirdly) since going up to 25mcg. Is this normal????

I'm so scared I'm never going to feel normal again... I need some hope. Thank you in advance.

Have not had significant progress and cannot figure out why. 
Started 15th September! (10 weeks or so) 

I am eating in a calorie deficit at about 1200-1300/day, 90g ish of protein a day give or take, and sticking below 20g net / day. (Often 10-17g) 

I am learning that eating in such a deficit could be causing my body to hold onto weight given that I have pcos, I am doing this for weight loss & I will say that drop is the first time id ever seen a scale move without a glp1. (Started 210-182 came off due to cost and chose to do keto) could artificial sweetener like a Sprite Zero or sugar free sweetener in coffee could be a hold back? 

Now I’ve been told that maybe I need to go back up in calories and maybe do 30g-50g carbs to reset my metabolism and then go back into a 20g net carb, but I’m not sure if that’s accurate. 
I picked up jogging & have been going to the gym to weightlift and I’m wondering what I might be doing wrong. I am not seeing significant changes yet. 

A couple questions:
- if you are past keto flu, do you still need electrolytes? I think I was over supplementing and it was giving my not a good time on toilet. 
- can artificial sweeteners cause problems with weight loss? 
- is a blood monitor more accurate than urine sticks and should I get one? 
- should I come up to reset my metabolism or is that a mistake? 

If anyone else is in here who has had success on pcos, I would love to hear your story. I’ve been on this journey since my diagnosis 3 years ago and I’m so sick of my body being on hard mode all the time. Doctors are useless so I’ve been navigating this pretty much solo. I just want to be happy, healthy & be comfortable in my skin. I am committed to this lifestyle of keto & I am perfectly content doing it long term! ",2,1763571552.0,keto,0,1.0,False

There might be a few fan theories or details from previous episodes, which is why I marked this as a spoiler. My version of a 20-minute Episode 9 that follows the *Invisigal Hero & Shroud Mercy route*.

Ep 9: Laid Back (Tuesday after the final fight)

A letter floats in the air, drifting to a balcony, but making a blunt sound as it crashes into the glass window, dropping to the ground. Coincidentally, Robert notices it and picks the envelope up. Upon ripping it, the letter’s SDN logo gleams, and opening up the letter cues the ***Dispatch*** title. Robert takes a deep breath, rips off the recovery stipend for the days the Z-team will be off, and then goes back to shaving.

A knock on the door and a familiar voice emerges from the door.

Mandy (muffled): You awake yet? 

Robert: I wasn’t asleep for most of it, but yeah, give me a second.

Robert runs toward the door with an excitement he could only express with a dimly lit smile. Mandy waves, wearing a light-blue knit sweater and a set of gray double-pleated dress pants to make for a comfortable outfit.

(If you’re romancing Mandy) >!She jumps forward with a matching energy, and they hold each other, rocking gently side-to-side as they hug. They pull away, and Mandy immediately brings an idea to mind. !<

M: Seeing how I’m free today, I came to see if you were too.

R: I don’t know when the next time I’ll be in front of a desk again, so you could say I don’t have anything planned.

M: I’ve got you covered. Do you want to go pick up a pastry at “Pitchoun”? It’s really nice out, and plastic utensils are more appropriate there. 

Robert has to say something (it’ll be a yes anyway, “illusion of choice”, everyone, even BB haters \[I see you\] earned this after all this time):

1. I’m down. (All choices would give +5 Mandy trust)
2. Where’s that? 
3. >!No Michelin star brunch?!< (Mandy Romance Exclusive)

*Choice 1 (default) result:*

>!*R: A café trip is right up my alley. I’m down.*!<

Choice 2 (still professional) result: 

>!R: Where’s that? I don’t leave my place much.!<

>!M (begins to tug your arm firmly): It’ll be easier if I show you. You won’t regret it. !<

Choice 3 (Mandy Romance exclusive) result: 

>!R: Was hoping for a Michelin-star breakfast this morning.!<

>!M (making a sarcastic mhm): That sounds like something you can treat the entire Z-team to. I’ll add that to the agenda once we get back on the clock.!<

>!R: I’M KIDDING! I’ll need to sell these lamps for something like that.!<

>!M: Well, I’m kidding, too. Let’s lower the bar a little bit, Michelin Man. !<

M: (face lights up) I’ll go start up the car, it’ll be sad Prism can’t build a highway for us. (Before Robert closes the door) And bring along Beef, you can’t just keep him home on such a nice day.

Robert bolts back inside, returning with an imitation of Chase’s stance with Beef tucked closer to his bent elbow. His mind didn’t cross the idea that he wouldn’t be flying there. Mandy gives a light laugh while interpreting his face, and the lights go out inside the closed room behind them.

At an outside table in front of a glass window, a line gathered at the other end, but the scenery was interrupted with a loud crunch from Robert’s \[insert donut type he picked from Ep 2\]. 

R: These work really well with coffee. 

He makes this clear comment as he rips parts of his pastry and dips them into a mug. Gradually, a small cloud of glazing/jelly builds up, which he then swirls and takes a big sip of the sugary mixture. He shivers a bit from the rush and wipes his tissue and notices that Mandy’s drink was barely touched. 

R (pointing with his eyes): What’s up with your coffee? 

M (hanging her head down a bit): Not enough Whiskey, I can take down a ton of cups of these without feeling anything, but that’d be extremely uncomfortable.

R: Even without the vigorous lifestyle you had, you can still fly by these? I don’t know if that’s impressive or a problem.

M: Sounds a lot like the latter. 

Mandy’s eyes pan over past the line of customers who were drooling on the walls at the sight of the table’s open box of sweet treats. The clouds were thin and shaped like petals, and she held her head in her hand, elbow on the table. Robert met her gaze and immediately thought of what she wanted: to get up there and touch them. Mandy soon recollected her thoughts and pushed the box of remaining pastries over to Robert. 

M: You should take them. I don’t think there was much food at your place last time I was there.

Robert insisted not to, but had to make another choice. Beef stared at the  He looked to the line of waiting customers, then back at the pink box. 

Choice 1: Ask for a take-out bag and hold onto it 

*Choice 2: Give some away, keeping some for himself* 

*Choice 2 exclusive result:* 

>!*Robert hands them out to the people at the very back, exchanging “Thank you’s” and “You’re welcomes” while Mandy beams back at Robert on their way to their car.*!<

Choice 1 or 2 exclusive dialogue: 

>!R: I have people in mind who would probably want these.!<

>!M: I might know who in particular you’re thinking of.!<

A metal detector makes a snappy beep, and footsteps follow along the floor. Robert then takes a turn to a crossroad of hallways decorated with mural wall paint and succulents. He instinctively goes for the turn towards the left wing. As he approaches the room, the sounds of video games and TVs fill the area.

The door opens to Invisigal, sitting with her legs crossed, hands messing with controllers, and eyes peering at a TV screen. The upper half of her body is still wrapped with stained bandages.

R: Guess what I brought- 

Robert lifts Beef in the air, and Beef starts panting and meandering around the room. None of this catches Courtney’s attention. He stands there waiting patiently until she takes off her headphones to reach for a service bell. Only then does she notice the auburn-haired man in a bomber jacket, also with his eyes glued to the screen. 

C: I didn’t expect you to answer the service call.

R (Courtney Romance): >!You didn’t expect me to have your powers?!<

R: I also didn’t expect you to be so absorbed in the game you’re playing; it would take five minutes for you to notice me here.

C: Well, I can’t stay still. I just can’t wait to get out of here.

Courtney shakes her head in disappointment, glancing at the window outside, and then at a plastic box with some metal inside. Robert’s eyes light up as he notices the metal parts and red LED lights finally stop flickering.

R: I didn’t know you got those attachments removed. How are you feeling now?

C: So much better. I can run around and jump scare my service workers all the time now… well, thanks to the stronger inhaler I have now.

(Courtney Romance) >!If you still have some pastries left, she’ll notice.!<

>!C: Are those... for me?!<

>!R: Well, I wouldn’t bring my own meal to eat in front of you. Of course they are. Blazer picked them out for you.!<

>!C: Oh shit, let’s go. I fucking need 'em!!<

>!Once Robert is in range of exchanging the box with Courtney, she immediately pulls him in for a hug and only lets go of his face once Robert is sitting on the side of the hospital bed. !<

>!C: You’re always here at the same time, I should have known…!<

>!Robert remains quiet but attentively intimate, encapsulating himself in the moment. She moves back with a warm look, but is alerted by Golem on the other end, his jaw dropping as he witnesses PDA in front of Courtney’s webcam.!<

Golem: Yo, Robert, you into any video games?

Golem’s faint voice comes out of the headphones. Robert looked at the controller on the far bedside and shrugged. 

R: When you aren’t interested in things after the second week, I find it hard to say I’m “good” at them.

G: It’s fine, sounds just like a two-week Minecraft phase.

R: Sure… whatever that is. What do you normally play?

G: Let’s try this. 

Golem and Robert go against each other in a 1v1 with Golem through different stages of hacking stages, with each player being able to send traps and obstacles at each other. (I don’t have a gameplay idea, puzzles kinda made more sense.)

Courtney slowly takes Robert’s stolen headset off and beams a smirk at him. 

R: What?!

C (Courtney Romance):>! So, Mr. Seasonal Depression, you got too busy this time. Thanks for the treats, though. I’ll pay you back with something else sweet. I also saved you one.!<

C: I think Golem should go back to taking care of his baby Kaiju.

(Courtney Romance Exclusive) >!She hands you back the pink box, tying it up with a heart-shaped knot. Before Robert leaves, she makes a bratty yet playful wink at him before running up, trying to restrain Robert with her arms again. However, that trap falls short when her injured shoulder starts aching, and Robert helps her back into bed.!<

Robert stares blankly at his last remaining croissant in the box and makes his way to the opposite wing of the same floor. He finds himself a rollable chair to drag around, and his expression starts to reflect tension, rather than warmth. 

He knocks on the door, and the hatch unlocks, but the door opens to a set of steel bars. Behind those bars was a frail old man still with the red splotches along his face. He slowly pans his head in the direction of the new light.

Elliot: Oh, it’s you. Is there enough torture keeping me alive? 

Elliot chokes his words as if the life support was malfunctioning.

R: I’m here to ask a few questions. Eat up, you don’t want to answer them on an empty stomach.

Elliot, in his blue ward gown, runs over to the last baked good and scarfs it down without hesitation. The door slowly creaks open behind Robert, but it shuts itself without anyone passing by. Robert feels a cold wisp of air graze his face, but doesn't divert his attention from the man who was sobbing and stuffing his face.

TLDR; Over time, the behavior of my girlfriend of 5 years made me feel emotionally completely drained. But I feel way too responsible for her well-being to leave her, due to her chronic disease/disability and her current situation that makes her very socially anxious. Now I met a wonderful woman, that I want to meet again. I don't know, how I can make everyone happy.

Hi all,

I am in a very unfortunate situation in my relationship and I don't know how I can make everyone happy, including me. Or at least, how I can make sure that this is not turning into a shit show.

So, currently my girlfriend [F25], lets call her A, is studying in a foreign country for a few years. She left in September and will be back in March. Shortly after she left, I started living completely on my own and I noticed, that I didn't miss her. And that I can not imagine moving together with her.

I started understanding some things I have been feeling for months already, and now I cannot see a future with her anymore. Some things that are really draining me emotionally are the following:

- I feel completely invisible in this relationship. Whenever we see each other, she just talks for 2 hours, emotionally unloads every little thing on me, and doesn't let me even answer. When I try to get a word in, she is silent for a few seconds to let me speak, and then completely ignores what I said. She doesn't give me a chance to even talk about what stresses me or weighs me down. And afterward she is either too tired and goes to sleep or is completely distracted by her phone. I only feel like I am of interest, when she is feeling lonely

- She commented on my body way too often, I started feeling incredibly insecure and do feel uncomfortable changing around her. She often said I should suck in my stomach/belly more. I am quite athletic, I normally wouldn't care, but over time it got under my skin

- I think of myself as a very romantic person and made it clear that I want to marry someday, without specifying when. This prompted her to repeatedly emphasize that I shouldn't propose to her, which hurt me quite a bit

- We haven't had sex for a few years due to her chronic disease. Her doctors gave her a prescription and explained to her what to do, to (hopefully) overcome the problem (with sex, not the chronic disease). I supported her for years and never considered this a reason to leave her. But at some point, it became clear to me, that she isn't even following the directions of her doctors. This makes me feel awful, like she doesn't even want to be intimate with me

- Repeatedly saying how I need her way more than she needs me. After telling her about something emotional, she made fun of me for it a few months later. And some other things come on top. I don't want to go into the details too much.

I always talked myself into believing that this is all my fault, that I am having the wrong feelings, and that she doesn't mean it that way. Now, after living alone for a few weeks and being way more happy, I realized that maybe this relationship is beyond fixing.

However, I am afraid of ending things, because I know she needs me right now. Living abroad amplified her anxiety. In her first days abroad, we regularly called, and she always cried or was on the brink of crying. I don't want to leave her while she is so vulnerable and doesn't feel good. I also don't know when to breakup. She will come to me to live with me over Christmas, which is also a problem because the flights are already booked.

Today, I met another woman (lets call her E) for coffee. It was clearly planned as a date, and we hit it off immediately, talked for hours. I never expected this to happen, and never told her that I am in a relationship. I know that it was wrong to go on a ""date"" while already being in a relationship, but I just expected to have a nice chat over some coffee and get to know an interesting person.

I really want to meet her again. But if I tell her about the relationship, that will probably and bad. If I don't, it will also end bad. When and how do I break up with my girlfriend? Or is this relationship not lost after all?

I don't think she is a bad person. She is (or was) always very caring and putting effort into this relationship. She has to wrestle her own insecurities, too.

Dr. Elias Merin was preparing a cup of coffee while soft, calming music played in the background. Outside his window, birds chirped their morning songs.

As he lifted the mug toward his lips, his eyes drifted to the stethoscope hanging behind his console. He hadn’t used it in two years, yet it remained there — a small plastic relic from a past version of himself.

Before he could take a sip, a flicker on his diagnostic display caught his attention. The calm blue frame froze, then collapsed into a single line of text:

**NETWORK CORE OFFLINE — DECISION AUTHORITY REVERTED TO HUMAN CLINICIANS**

His stomach tightened. He hadn’t made a fully independent medical decision in… three years? Four? It didn’t matter. The message felt like a personal accusation.

Alarms rang out upending the quiet. Nurses called across the hallways, monitors reverted to fallback modes, and patients asked why nothing on their displays was updating. Elias pushed himself up, his knees aching as if they had aged overnight.

Moving down the corridor, he spotted Alina behind a half-closed door, already moving briskly between beds.

“System’s down?” she asked without pausing.

“Completely,” Elias replied. “Diagnostics, treatment generator — everything.”

“Okay,” she said simply. “We’re going manual.”

Manual. The word felt almost prehistoric.

A patient groaned nearby. The man’s sallow skin, shallow breaths, and beaded sweat painted a clear picture — one Elias struggled to interpret without the comfort of digital overlays.

“He’s slipping,” Alina said. “Probably sepsis. But something’s off.”

Elias stepped closer, asking routine questions, with a hollow, monotone voice. Out of habit, he reached for his tablet. Another error message.

Alina tilted the patient’s arm slightly. “His rash — it’s lacy. Started yesterday, he said.”

Elias blinked. He hadn’t even noticed it. Hadn’t thought to check.

“Check his neck,” she said.

He did. Lymph nodes — swollen, unmistakable. The pieces slipped into place in his mind, slower than he liked.

“Endocarditis,” he murmured. Then, catching himself: “Probably.”

“Good,” Alina said, already drawing up antibiotics. “He’s unstable. Start broad coverage.”

He hesitated — not doubting her, but fearing the weight of making the call without an Agent-generated confidence score.

“I’ll sign off,” he said at last.

Alina gave a quick nod; she had real work to do, and she moved on without waiting.

The ward churned as the morning unfolded.

Patients crashed, monitors reverted to clunky legacy modes.

Doctors clustered in glass rooms, whispering their discomfort — how much they had forgotten, how dependent they had become.

But the nurses moved like water, filling every gap.

They lifted patients with practiced precision.

They found veins Elias would have missed repeatedly.

They soothed distraught families with steady assurance.

They were the gravitational center of the ward.

During a rare lull, Elias leaned against the wall, sweat cooling on his skin. Through the glass, he watched Alina adjust a frail man’s oxygen tubing. She looked up, gave him a genuine, unforced smile.

It hit him harder than expected.

She was doing the part of medicine that still mattered.

The part Agents couldn’t touch.

The part he had quietly abandoned.

And she was rewarded accordingly now — flexible schedule, double his hourly rate, first pick of shifts, training stipends. She was the one hospitals fought to hire.

Envy crawled up his chest like heat. Shame followed close behind.

By noon, the network returned. His console chimed, the familiar blue frame re-formed, and the Machine resumed its quiet dominance, smoothing uncertainty into neat percentages.

But Elias didn’t sit.

He found Alina in the supply corridor, tying her hair back.

“You saved that patient,” he said.

“We did,” she answered gently.

“No,” Elias said. “You did. I just followed.”

Alina shrugged. “I’ve been doing more hands-on work than you lately. That’s all. You’ve been… upstream.”

Upstream. The polite version of “out of practice.”

“I want to relearn it,” he said. The admission felt raw. “The real work. What I let go. I don’t want to be just a… button-pusher anymore.”

Alina studied him for a moment, her expression softening.

“You can,” she said. “If you’re willing to get your hands dirty again.”

“I am.”

“Then start simple,” she said. “Follow me on rounds tonight. Watch. Ask questions. You’ll remember more than you think.”

She walked toward the ward.

He followed.

And for the first time in years, something stirred beneath the layers of automation and diluted responsibility. A pulse of purpose… or maybe the faint memory of it.

Either way, it was enough.",1,1763571314.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

When plugged in a USB drive it wouldn’t mount and an error about ‘read access’ came up (sorry can’t remember exactly) so I decided to restart the machine. However it booted back into GNU GRUB so I googled it and using commands worked out the kernel is on (hd0,msdos1). I then tried the various commands to get it to load but unfortunately failed.

I know very little about Linux and typically use windows for it’s simplicity. That said with some guides I managed to trace the error to “failure reading sector 0x800995 from hd0)” which AI seems to say is a HHD failure.

My question have I lost everything on my laptop, is it worth throwing money into saving it or should I cut my losses and recycle the laptop?

Side note: I can’t afford much money and the data is only 8GB worth of old photos but would love to get back if possible. If this sub allows it I’m willing to buy some coffees etc if someone can help.",1,1763571175.0,linuxquestions,5,1.0,False
1p1cxso,https://www.reddit.com/r/Epilepsy_Universe/comments/1p1cxso/the_walls_that_wont_come_down/,The Walls That Won't Come Down,"Setting: A two-lane highway cutting through endless cornfields. The sun’s going down in streaks of orange and purple. Wind turbines turn lazily in the distance. Ringo, the sentient hippie van, hums an old Grateful Dead tune through his radio. Stickers cover his bumper: “Peace, Not Pieces” “Neural Energy or Bust” “I Brake for Turtles.”

 

Inside, Desdemona sits in the passenger seat with her boots on the dash, arms crossed, sunglasses sliding down her nose. Rick drives, one hand on the wheel, the other on a bag of chips.

 

Desdemona: “Last week my dad took me to dinner, right? Margarita night. Guess how many I got?”

 

Rick: “Judging by that tone? One.”

 

Desdemona: “One! Just one! He said, ‘Gotta keep those meds happy, kiddo.’ Like Keppra’s sitting in my liver with a clipboard.”

 

Ringo’s voice sounds through the static, low and mellow: “Maybe it is, man. Internal quality control.”

 

Desdemona: “I used to outdrink half the mechanics in town. Now I’m the girl who sits in by the jute box with a virgin glass.”

 

Rick laughs: “Sounds to me like you’re living the high life in moderation.”

 

Desdemona: “Oh, bite me.”

 

Rick: “I would, but I’m scared your doctor will file a report.”

 

Ringo’s radio giggles, soft and analog. A string of fairy lights around his windshield blink like they’re in on the joke.

 

They drive in silence for a while, just the hum of the road and the occasional crunch of a chip. Fireflies start showing up, tiny lanterns in the dusk.

 

Desdemona sighs: “It’s just… weird. Having limits. I used to be unstoppable. Now I have to plan my life around pill alarms and tracker apps. Feels like I traded freedom for functionality.”

 

Ringo downshifts gently, voice low and kind: “Freedom’s not what you drink, bro. It’s that you still get to be on the road.”

 

Rick glances over, surprised by the sudden wisdom from the dashboard: “He’s right, you know. You’re still on the road. You’re still here.”

 

Desdemona looks out the window at the fields blurring by.

 

Desdemona, voice soft with thought: “Yeah. Guess I am. Even if I’m not the one driving anymore.”

 

Ringo hums again, softer now “Bubbles Up” by Jimmy, a song about finding your own way.

 

Rick: “You know, one margarita’s not bad. Means you’re pacing yourself for the next adventure.”

 

Desdemona smirks: “Next adventure better involve tequila and no parental supervision.”

 

Ringo: “Permission denied, Captain Liver Safety.”

 

They all laugh. The van’s engine purrs contentedly, headlights stretching across the road like lazy comets.

 

Desdemona leans back, eyes half-closed: “Maybe this is fine. Maybe growing up just means learning how to enjoy the ride.”

 

Ringo: “Now that’s the spirit.”

 

Rick grins: “Or what’s left of it after one margarita.”

 

Ringo honks once, a cheerful, musical beep-bop!. and the three of them disappear into the sunset, singing along to “Peaceful Easy Feeling.”

 

Later…

 

A neon-lit diner somewhere off Highway 41.

The sign outside flickers OPEN between the O and the P, and the jukebox hums low in the corner. Ringo naps outside under a canopy of stars, his headlights dimmed like eyelids.

 

Inside, Desdemona sits in a booth, half-finished cheeseburger in front of her. Rick has coffee, cold fries, and a pile of road-maps no one uses anymore.

 

The place smells like sugar and gasoline, feels like comfort and motion.

 

Rick stirs his coffee idly: “You know, most people wouldn’t still be out here. New meds, new rules… they’d hole up, call it quits.”

 

Desdemona picks at a crumb, voice softer than the clatter of dishes: “Sometimes I think I should. Stay safe. Be sensible. Then I remember how loud it gets inside my head when I stop moving.”

 

Rick: “Yeah. The silence screams louder than the engine.”

 

They sit for a moment, the jukebox shifting songs, a scratchy vinyl crackle. Then Jimmy Buffett’s ‘Coast Of Carolina’ starts to play, as if the universe queued it on purpose.

 

Desdemona leans back, listening to the words: “And the walls that won’t come down…”

 

She smiles, that tired, fond smile of recognition.

 

A voice calls from the shadows: “That one always hits you, doesn’t it?”

 

Desdemona blinks and turns. Melancholy is leaning against the table. There is a soft smile playing at her lips. Rick smiles and stands so she can sit.

 

Dez nods: “Yeah. He had a way of making stubborn sound holy.”

 

Desdemona rests her chin on her hand, watching the reflection of neon pink on the window.

 

Desdemona: “That’s what it feels like sometimes. Life. Like there’s a wall between me and the version of me that used to exist.”

 

She gestures around the old bar: “The one who could stay up all night, eat junk, not worry about seizure triggers or missing a dose. That wall’s not coming down. Not ever.”

 

Rick sets his coffee down and says quietly: “Then we decorate it.”

 

She looks at him, surprised: “What?”

 

He shrugs, grinning: “That’s what Jimmy said, right? ‘And the walls that won’t come down? We’ll decorate, or climb, or find some way to get around.’ If you can’t break it, make it beautiful.”

 

Desdemona’s eyes sting, but in the good way: “Yeah. Maybe I can hang some glitter on it. Paint it with grease and neon.”

 

Melancholy: “Add some stickers. Maybe a ‘Still Standing’ decal.”

 

They laugh quietly. The jukebox hums on.

 

Desdemona sighs, lighter now: “You know what? Maybe I can’t be who I was. But I can still build something with who I am now.”

 

Rick raises his mug: “To the decorators.”

 

She clinks her juice glass against it: “To the stubborn ones who find a way around.”

My daughter suffers from bpd and her airway is approximately the size of a coffee stirrer. She struggled even when intubated which eventually resulted in her getting a tracheostomy and g tube put in. It was terrifying, but with the training we received it turned out okay. We've had a couple close calls with her trache being clogged. A life flight at one point. She spent a total of five months in the hospital, then nearly another month due to emergencies and so on. Now she has a larger trache and we have a good system and things finally feel somewhat normal.

1p1cu12,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p1cu12,I made my brother a motorized kayak cart.,"Hi everyone. First post here. It's just for you guys.

My brother (who's 50) has an Old Town Saranac 146 canoe/kayak like this one; https://www.dunhamssports.com/old-town-saranac-146-xt-canoe-W0000045014.html
Seats 3, is 14ft long and 3ft wide. Weighs 80 lbs dry and over 100 with poles and gear....Not something very easy for one person to move any distance.....Not particularly fun but totally doable for two people to drag it on soft ground 300-400ft or so, but you're winded.

He commented on our last outing about getting a kayak cart. ""Cool"" I thought. It would make moving it about way way easier. So when I got home I started kinda poking about on Google. About like you'd expect, I saw all the same things you guys did Ozark Trail at Wallys for $55, Vevor for $75, and Railblaza for $160!!! And they all just kind of looked plain, and to honest, kind of janky....Thin aluminum tube, plastic wheels, really low to the ground, yuck.

So, Like everyone else, I started looking at homemade ones thinking if consumer ones were so ""blah"" surely the makers of the world would have done something! And they had....Pvc mostly but there were some others. You've all seen them. Functional, nothing more, why would it need to be?

As I sat there thumbing through image after image, watching a couple videos, I was...unimpressed to say the least. A simple thought kept overshadowing every search result I could think of...""$65-165 for a kayak cart?? Seems ridiculous, I bet for $100 I could just have one motorized."" *buzzer* WRONG! No one makes a motorized kayak cart. I saw that one ""beach cart"" or whatever with the big Grey inflatable wheels for sand and got my own wheels turning.....""I know I'm smart enough to make one of these, I just know it"" 

After a lot more searching and not finding much I thought the simplest way would be to take something that exists, add to it, and make it what I want instead of the ""build it from scratch"" mentality. Quickly, I came across the Razor Dirt Quad https://razor.com/product/dirt-quad/

""WOW"" I thought ""Perfect!"" Metal frame, 24v, goodly pneumatic tires, and the pièce de résistance....the entire drive train is attached to a swing arm!!!! I danced around the room with finger-guns ablazin' with the ideas swirling in my noggin about how absolutely cool this thing could be, I set to Facebook marketplace. 

To my immediate disappointment, every unit I found was $300+ ""ugh, figures"" I muttered, but I kept scrolling. Eventually I came across one....just,...one. Nearly 2 hours away from home. But, it had listed 19 hours before, and was only $100...""My kids outgrew"" ""just needs batteries"". And it was now Sunday morning, I knew it wouldn't last the day. I lept into action, hurriedly typing away, giggling to myself like an evil villain. I sent a message and explained my need offering a cool $50. To my shock, he replied...""$75 and its yours"" short, and sweet. 4 hours, 2 cups of coffee and 3 potty breaks later...I had my donor.

I immediately set to removing the plastic body, followed by the electrics and wheels. ""This is good"" I thought ""I can work with this."" The rear swing arm is only held on by a single bolt and the shock....too easy. I now had my main piece of hardware.

I made some cuts to what was left of the front of the machine leaving myself with the basically the foot rests, the shock mount, and the lower swing arm mount. From there I pretty much just flipped it upside down and rotated it 90 degrees from its original orientation and bolted it back onto the drivetrain portion. That left me with a flat, perpendicular ""base"" on top to which I could attach some runners ""No way it could be this easy"" I kept thinking, an hour into the project. I moved the electrics over to my new frame and made the connections I needed. I already had a 24v 10ah lithium battery that I had purchased from Amazon for another project, pretty much this unit https://a.co/d/8zegA2h so I added the original connector and strapped it in with velcro straps...done and done

I screwed a 6"" 2x4 chunk of wood to the top using the metal foot rests and the existing holes that was now turned upside down for a wider platform, and went with 24"" of 1"" pvc for my runners (but honestly could be halved to 12""), strictly out of convenience and availability. You could use A LOT of stuff. In fact, besides the quad, I had everything else on hand. Lucky me.

We loaded his kayak last evening (11/18) and we're able to find easy hook locations on the unit too! BONUS! he noted that it felt terribly well balanced and was ""light as a feather"" in his hand. With a twist of the throttle we began to ease our way slowly forward in the yard. To our delight, It worked! And it worked SOOOOO well. (Side note, we learned that with some tight turns the kayak would shift a bit, sitting a little cross-ways. Strapping it via X pattern instead of parallel solved that.)

You can walk with it and the throttle will keep up with that speed....up to a staggering 8mph and 120lb worth of weight....That's light jogging speed fellas, its unreal smooth. We sat and hee-hawed like a couple of jack-asses about it after too. Like it was the best thing man had every created, Lol. Him, proud of his ""baby"" brother. Me, just happy it worked.

We now have at our disposal, a totally portable (40lb with battery), compact, motorized cart that allows one person to now travel with a 100 lb+ loaded kayak.....for over an hour. One guy can load it and unload it if they have to, it goes in seconds with 2. I added a little kickstand with an extra piece of metal tube I had and put the brake lever back on too, at some point I'll find a way to make that a locking/unlocking parking brake which will keep the wheels locked when parked for even easier loading/unloading. The only thing I have to do to it right now is lengthen the wires for the throttle so one person can do it all. (I'm going to order a thumb throttle instead of using the half-twist that came with it, will just be easier.   I'll lengthen those wires to about 8 or 10 feet. (3 meters)

Its just a simple 6pin harness, razor makes them in all 3 flavors, full twist, half twist, and thumb with that same connector, so its cheap and easy to source.

Well, that's it I think. That's the thing I made. I just wanted to share with everyone and let you know how easy it would be to make your own. Reddit has been good to me about having the info I need and the people I've encountered are just top notch.....I wanted to give something back. I encourage all comments and will happily answer any questions about it. Cheers everyone!",13,1763570932.0,Kayaking,4,0.85,False

1p1cn5r,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_LiveMates-AE/comments/1p1cn5r/hidden_costs_of_living_in_dubai_most_expats_dont/,Hidden costs of living in Dubai most expats don’t expect,"Living in Dubai looks predictable from the outside. People imagine clean roads, fast bureaucracy, predictable bills, and a kind of all-inclusive lifestyle where everything comes bundled into the rent. But once you actually move here, the picture gets sharper — and a bit more complicated. At LiveMates, we spend a lot of time talking to newcomers and long-timers, and the same pattern appears again and again: most expats underestimate how many small (and not-so-small) costs slide into daily life.

Housing is the first surprise. Everyone expects high rent — that part’s not hidden. What catches people off guard are the extras around it. The security deposit that’s somewhere between a shrug and a negotiation. The agency fees that add one more chunk on top. And DEWA — the electricity and water bill — which goes up brutally fast once summer kicks in. One user told us he almost fell off his chair the first time he saw his July bill. He wasn’t even home most of the day. AC consumption doesn’t care.

Another place where costs sneak in is transportation. Tourists think Dubai is built for cars, and in many ways it is. But owning a car means insurance, registration, occasional Salik charges, and a very Dubai-specific habit of suddenly needing a ride because the heat makes a ten-minute walk feel like a survival challenge. Several people in our community mention that they tried to rely purely on public transport at first — and gave up once they had two late-night commutes in a row or missed a bus connection in the summer months. Relying on taxis “just when needed” turns into a noticeable monthly expense.

Food is another one. Groceries aren’t shocking on their own, but the price difference between imported and local products adds up quickly. And eating out, even in simple places, becomes a habit for many expats who work late or live far from big supermarkets. One member told us she didn’t expect the “Dubai convenience tax,” her term for the extra 20–30% that slips into almost every delivery order. Not because the restaurants are expensive — but because delivery fees, service charges, and occasional minimum order requirements combine into something larger than you planned.

A less obvious cost sits in visa and residency maintenance. Even people who arrive through a job contract sometimes forget the smaller attachments: the cost of renewing an Emirates ID, the medical test fee, the occasional stamping fee, and the time off work it requires. And if someone is sponsoring family members, the totals grow quickly. These aren’t hidden in a shady sense, just easy to overlook when you’re calculating your first-year budget.

Then there’s the lifestyle drift. Dubai has this weird ability to make reasonable people say yes to things they wouldn’t usually consider — brunch culture, weekend outings, waterparks, gyms with hotel-level facilities, all the little impulsive extras. Nobody forces you to participate, but the social rhythm around you nudges you anyway. A few users mentioned that their spending didn’t explode from “big purchases”; it was the slow accumulation of small outings, coffees with colleagues, and random events that filled up their weekends.

Another thing people forget is home setup. Moving into a new apartment means buying everything — literally everything. Curtains, kitchen basics, rugs, appliances, cleaning supplies. And a lot of it costs more than you think. One person shared that he budgeted for furniture but completely overlooked things like lightbulbs, shower hooks, a drying rack, and a decent vacuum — all together, those became a small investment of their own.

Some neighborhoods also come with community fees that tenants don’t always understand at first. Many buildings pass maintenance charges indirectly through rent or additional service costs. It’s not universal, but it appears often enough that newcomers get confused the first time they hear the phrase “chiller charges.” Sometimes cooling is included in rent, sometimes partially, sometimes not at all. This alone can shift a budget by hundreds of dirhams per month.

There’s also the cost of staying connected. Mobile plans, home internet, and streaming services stack up. Packages look cheap until you realize you need add-ons for international calls or a faster home connection. And then there are spontaneous travel costs — almost everyone flies out at least once a year, because Dubai is perfectly located and temptingly connected. But flights, especially during holidays, are far from cheap.

A few observations we hear constantly from LiveMates users:

• People underestimate how much cooling affects their overall spending. Many reduce rent by choosing older buildings, then pay it back through higher DEWA bills.  
• Groceries look affordable on shelves but grow noticeably once you track spending for a full month.  
• Most expats start with a “strict budget,” but after three or four months, they adjust it upward because they finally see how life actually functions here.

None of this is meant to scare anyone away. Dubai’s lifestyle can be fantastic, and many people find ways to balance everything once they settle in. But the hidden costs are real, and being mentally prepared helps you avoid the month-three panic that so many newcomers experience.

If you’re already living here — what surprised you the most? And if you’re planning to come soon, which costs are you most unsure about? Feel free to share your experience or ask questions — we’d love to hear how others navigate these unexpected parts of Dubai life.",1,1763570515.0,u_LiveMates-AE,0,1.0,False

My idea is a love seat with a coffee table. I’m looking at white (more modern) love seats. Because the living room gives off a modern vibe. I’m fine with a little modern but nothing crazy. 

We are planning to put a big Christmas tree there soon but for Thanksgiving I want the love seat and coffee  table facing the dining room behind me. 

I want to fill it but not over fill it because my idea is once we place the tree we flip the love seat and coffee table around to face the tree so we can open presents there. 

The other side of the platform has a small white bar. 
I want to make it a tiny sitting are but also am considering putting a bar with bar stools there I don’t know. Is that kitschy?

I like Art Deco/ Hollywood regency but that won’t fit there I don’t think. 

It might be hard to see but we have a huge navy blue sectional down in the main living room which is for watching movies etc but the platform I want to be used as more a functional guest area.

A lot of people in long-term relationships are quietly panicking. Not because of cheating or screaming matches, but because the romance has slowly deflated. You’re not fighting, you’re folding laundry together. You’re sharing space, not sharing passion. It feels like living with a very polite roommate. And no, it’s not just “how long-term relationships go” or “real love is boring,” that’s a lazy narrative.

This post is for anyone quietly wondering, “Is this it?” Or worse, “Are we just co-parents or co-tenants now?” The good news? Relationship ruts aren’t destiny. They’re feedback. And they can be reversed. This is a practical guide based on relationship research, top therapists, and neuroscience, NOT TikTok pseudoscience or hookup podcasters trying to go viral with hot takes.

Here’s what actually helps, backed by insights from real experts who study this for a living:

- **Treat intimacy like a skill**  
Esther Perel, one of the most cited relationship experts today, says modern couples demand security and passion from the same person. But passion and predictability rarely coexist naturally. This means if you want desire back, you need to actively cultivate mystery, play, and novelty. Not in a gimmicky way, but through experimentation, surprise, and letting go of control sometimes. _Mating in Captivity_ is her go-to book on this.

- **Relearn your partner**  
According to Dr. John Gottman (University of Washington), the number one factor in relationship success is “love maps,” knowing your partner’s inner world. In long-term relationships, we assume we already *know* them. But people evolve. Instead of only dividing chores or planning logistics, ask deeper questions again. What are they scared of lately? What’s exciting them? Gottman even has a free card deck app with prompts.

- **Interrupt autopilot with intentional rituals**  
Dr. Alexandra Solomon (author of _Loving Bravely_) talks about “relational mindfulness.” It’s about pausing everyday patterns to ask, “What am I bringing into this interaction?” Create daily or weekly rituals that are sacred. No phones, no multitasking. It can be as simple as a 10-minute coffee check-in or looking into each other’s eyes before bed. Sounds cheesy but these micro-moments rebuild emotional safety.

- **Touch before talking**  
Touch isn’t just foreplay. It’s the foundation. Functional MRI scans from UCLA (study led by Dr. Naomi Eisenberger) show that physical touch can lower cortisol and boost oxytocin, even before any verbal repair happens. Start with non-sexual but present touch. Hand on the back. A long hug. This isn’t foreplay. This is safety.

- **Intimacy isn’t just sex, but sex still matters**  
A huge study by the Kinsey Institute found that couples who initiate sex even once a week feel significantly more connected. Not because of orgasm count, but because of shared vulnerability and emotional availability. Don’t wait until it “feels natural.” You might have to schedule intimacy at first. Desire often follows action, not the other way around.

- **Redefine novelty**  
Novelty isn’t just kinky toys or exotic vacations. It’s anything that interrupts familiarity. Dr. Arthur Aron’s famous “36 questions to fall in love” experiment is based on this principle. But it only works if you *both* show up with curiosity. Try new activities together. Even walking a new route in your neighborhood while sharing memories can spark fresh energy.

- **Audit the roommate dynamics**  
A 2022 survey by the Pew Research Center found that over 30 percent of cohabiting couples who report satisfaction also have clearly divided responsibilities and personal time. If your entire connection is logistical, bills, groceries, school runs, intimacy doesn’t stand a chance. You're not just lovers, you're also co-CEOs of a household. But if all you're doing is “managing,” you’re not relating. Share the work AND protect the connection.

- **Fix resentment before it calcifies**  
Sexless relationships often stem from unspoken resentment, not low libido. According to a research review in _Journal of Marriage and Family_, emotional withdrawal is a stronger predictor of sexual decline than physical issues. If you’ve been bottling up minor injuries (“You don’t listen,” “You don’t initiate,” “I don’t feel sexy anymore”), it will leak into every interaction. These things don’t disappear. They fester. Name them with compassion. Use “I feel…” statements, not blame dumps.

- **Stop waiting for motivation**  
Desire isn’t always spontaneous. It’s responsive. Dr. Emily Nagoski (author of _Come As You Are_) explains this with the dual-control model of sexuality. Most people require context, signals of safety, and emotional cues to feel desire. If you're waiting to “feel in the mood” before taking action, you might wait forever. Create the conditions first.

- **Build the erotic, not just the romantic**  
Romance is sweet. But passion is feral. Sometimes what the relationship needs is less “I love you” and more “I want you.” This requires creating deliberate separation and edge. Give each other space. Let them be a mystery sometimes. Reflect on what first attracted you. Don’t just say “thank you,” say “that was hot.” Signal desire. Let flirtation live again.

Real intimacy isn’t effortless. It’s built. And rebuilt. Over and over. But that’s what makes it meaningful. The roommate phase isn’t a failure. It’s just a signal your relationship is asking for a reboot.",1,1763570260.0,AtlasBookClub,0,1.0,False

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

1p1ch11,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheFounders/comments/1p1ch11/why_i_quit_chasing_vanity_metrics_on_x_twitter/,Why I quit chasing vanity metrics on X (Twitter) and found $1.2K by helping on Reddit.,"Four months ago, I was ready to throw in the towel. My SaaS projects were barely making enough to buy a coffee, let alone hit any payout thresholds. After months of trying to make X (formerly Twitter) work, I was still stuck at under $100/month.

I’d spent endless hours crafting threads, trying to go viral, engaging with the usual ""build in public"" crowd. Crickets. Or worse, just other founders trying to promote their own stuff. It felt like shouting into an empty room. Total ego bait.

My first two months, June and July, were brutal. Barely broke $100 combined across both apps. I was tracking every penny, and it felt like I was just burning time and energy on a channel that gave zero ROI.

Then, out of sheer frustration, I decided to pivot my entire marketing grind. I started genuinely engaging on Reddit. Not just my own subs, but relevant communities where my target users actually hung out and talked about their problems. I didn't post once for like a week, just observed the hive mind.

Instead of overtly promoting, I focused on helping. Answering questions, sharing real insights based on my experience, and occasionally, very subtly, mentioning one of my projects if it was directly relevant to a solution someone was seeking. The change was immediate. It felt like I was finally speaking the language the actual customers understood.

Since September, my revenue has climbed steadily. This month (November), I'm projected to hit **$400** across my two SaaS projects. It's not unicorn money, but going from barely $100/month to over $1.2K in just a few months feels like a massive win for a solo builder juggling two things.

**Here's what I learned from this hard pivot:**

* **Go where your users are actually talking.** Don't chase vanity metrics on platforms full of other founders doing the same. Find where your target audience *complains* or *asks for help*. That's where the real pain points, and therefore the real solutions, are.
* **Give value, don't just promote.** Be a peer, not a marketer. Solve problems for people, answer their calls, and they'll naturally be curious about what you build. This builds trust, which is the ultimate currency.
* **Be patient.** Reddit isn't instant virality, but it builds genuine, high-quality interest and trust over time. It's a marathon, not a sprint, but the users you get are sticky.
* **Don't be afraid to pivot your marketing strategy.** What works for one person won't work for everyone. Be flexible and test different channels. My X strategy was a dumpster fire; Reddit was the unholy growth hack.
* **Juggling multiple projects is possible**, but focus your marketing efforts. One strong channel is better than five weak ones. Consolidate your grind.

I'm still figuring out most of this, but the shift from X to Reddit was a game-changer for me.

Lights on. TV on. Coffee cold and bitter in my hands.

Around 3:14 a.m., someone touched my shoulder.

Cold fingers. Deliberate. Not imagined.

I couldn’t move.

My limbs wouldn’t respond. My eyelids felt glued shut. I heard breathing—slow, steady, right beside my ear. And underneath that, something else:

A faint scraping sound.
Like nails dragging across glass.

I tried to open my eyes. I begged myself to move.

But I kept sinking.
Deeper.
Colder.
Away from the room, away from my body.

The next morning, I woke up on the bathroom floor with a new note pressed beneath my palm.

“You’re almost gone.”

I didn’t go to work.
Didn’t eat.
Didn’t speak.

Something was wrong with my reflection that day—not enough to pinpoint, just enough to dread. My movements lagged half a second. My smile didn’t reach my eyes. My pupils were slightly… wrong.

Dilated.
Too dark.

It didn’t feel like mine.

That night I tried to stay awake again, but sleep dragged me under like drowning.
Darkness pressed against me—heavy, suffocating, full of whispers I couldn’t understand.

When I finally surfaced, it wasn’t morning yet.

I was standing in front of the bathroom mirror.

But I wasn’t moving.

My reflection was.

It raised its hand slowly, deliberately, and pressed a new note to the glass—on the inside of the mirror. Behind the surface.

The handwriting was still neat.
Still gentle.

But now it was unmistakably mine.

The note said:

“Stop fighting.
It’s my turn.”

My reflection smiled.

I didn’t.

1p1cg5f,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticSpouses/comments/1p1cg5f/gf_calls_me_lazy_stupid_not_a_man/,"GF calls me ‘lazy, stupid, not a man’","So… I don’t even know where to start. I’m a pretty reasonable person (at least I think so), but lately my(27m) relationship with my gf (33f) has me questioning what’s normal and what’s not.

A bit of context: A mutual coworker told me about a part-time job opportunity. He said he’d put in a word for me and send me the number of the person to contact. A few days go by, and last night at around 21:58, he sends me the number and then two minutes later, at 22:00, he also messages my girlfriend to tell her he sent me the number.

Mind you, we were watching TV. I didn’t notice the message. My phone wasn’t in reach, and it was almost 10 PM. I figured it was way too late to bother the guy, so I’d text him first thing in the morning to set up the interview.

She sees the message on her phone and immediately asks why I’m “not watching my messages.” I explain exactly that: phone wasn’t on me, it’s late, I’ll text in the morning, and she basically calls me lazy and irresponsible. Says I have time for reels and to talk to my friends but not for “real life stuff.”

Fast forward: I go to the interview today. The guy literally tells me we could’ve handled everything in the morning and there was zero need to message him last night. Not urgent at all.

I tell her what he said and she blows up, claiming she is the reason I got the job interview in the first place because she “made me” text him. Like… what??

And that wasn’t even the only argument. Before I left today we fought because I like to have my coffee in peace before starting the day. No drama, no rushing — just a normal human routine. Apparently that’s “stupid,” according to her, asking me what if something urgent came up? I said if there’s something urgent, that’s and exception and of course I’ll deal with it first.


Now, here’s the part I’m actually kind of embarrassed about. A year ago, I started keeping a list of stuff she said to me. Not because I’m petty, but because whenever she’d ask for examples of hurtful things she’s said, my mind would go blank. So… yeah, here’s some of the stuff I wrote down:
	•	“I’ll never marry you. I can’t wait for you to propose just to say no.”
	•	“If you can’t do the job, just go upstairs and tell them you’re a fat, lazy POS and to give the job to someone else.”
	•	“You’re not a man at all, you’re too sensitive. I’m more of a man than you.”
	•	“Maybe I don’t want kids with you anymore, God forbid we’re gonna have kids.”

I don’t even know what to think anymore. I feel like I’m walking on eggshells over the smallest things, and somehow everything becomes my fault.

Is this normal “relationship arguing” or am I in something way more toxic than I want to admit?",1,1763570101.0,NarcissisticSpouses,2,1.0,False
1p1cfzh,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/poll-voters-favor-democrats-by-double-digits-if-midterms-were-today,This poll number hasn’t been so favorable for Democrats since before the last blue wave,"Riding a wave of recent election victories, Democrats have another reason to hope for a repeat performance in next year's elections. According to a new PBS News/NPR/Marist poll, a majority of voters say they would rather elect a Democratic candidate if the midterms were held today.

- Meanwhile, there are several warning signs for Republicans looking to make up ground before Americans cast their ballots next year.

- The poll found that if registered voters were choosing today, 55% would elect a Democratic candidate to represent them in Congress, while 41% would vote for a Republican. The 14-point advantage is the largest since November 2017, a year before Democrats won more than 40 seats in the House of Representatives during President Donald Trump's first term.

- Independent voters in the latest poll said they would select a Democrat over a Republican by a 2-to-1 margin.

- As the party out of power in Washington, Democrats are seen as ""the other guy,"" said Lee Miringoff, the director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion. That means voters are more likely to want to give them a chance to govern in the midterm elections.

- High-profile election wins for Democrats in New York, New Jersey and Virginia also had ""consequences in invigorating Democrats"" and potentially dampening Republican enthusiasm, said Amy Walter, editor-in-chief of The Cook Political Report with Amy Walter. She pointed to Trump's sagging popularity and economic frustrations for waning Republican support, particularly among independents.

- The winning Democratic candidates this year largely centered their campaigns on the rising cost of living in their cities and states. Since the election, the president and his administration have begun to address affordability issues more explicitly, including reversing course on some tariffs on beef, coffee and other foods, in a tacit acknowledgment that grocery prices are worrying for consumers.

- ""The Biden administration started the affordability crisis, and my administration is ending it,"" he told a group of McDonald's franchise owners on Monday.

- Given a list of issues, a majority of Americans (57%) think lowering prices should be the top priority of the White House right now. Majorities of Democrats and independents, as well as a plurality of Republicans, held that view in the latest poll. Controlling immigration, a major focus of Trump's second term, came a distant second in the public's list of presidential priorities — 41 points behind No. 1.

- The Trump administration has been ""out of step with where the public is"" on issues of affordability, Miringoff said. The president's focus has been on other issues including reducing crime, ending wars in Ukraine and Gaza and eliminating drug trafficking from Latin America, Miringoff added, ""but they don't resonate"" with voters.

- That has led, in part, to a drop in Trump's approval rating. Thirty-nine percent of poll respondents approve of the job he is doing. Another 56% disapprove of his job performance so far, including 48% who strongly disapprove.

- Since reentering White House, his job approval has dropped a few points to the lowest of his second term. It is also the lowest since the waning weeks of his first term, after a mob of his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol in an effort to overturn the 2020 election results.

- ""He's lost some of the groups that he had put together to win last year,"" Miringoff said. Voting blocs that Trump made gains with in the 2024 election, including young voters and independents, ""have now reverted to where they were before the campaign.""

- The poll was conducted from Nov. 10 to 13 as Congress reached a deal to end the longest government shutdown in U.S. history. As government reopens, paychecks begin to be delivered to federal workers and air travel returns to normal, 6 in 10 Americans say either Trump or congressional Republicans are to blame for the shutdown. Another 39% lay the blame on Democrats in Congress

- After the 43-day stalemate, 1 in 5 Americans has confidence in Congress. It's part of an overall distrust in American government and institutions captured by this poll. The presidency, Supreme Court and media are also underwater with the public. Sixty-one percent lack confidence in the presidency; 62% in the justices and 75% in the media.

- That negative sentiment extends to the two major political parties as well, with 65% lacking confidence in the Republican Party and 71% saying the same of Democrats. While Democrats garner less confidence overall, that is driven in part by 43% of their own party lacking confidence.

- Despite that frustration, which recently played out in public intraparty disputes over whether to end the government shutdown, Democrats still have the advantage in the binary choice ahead of the midterm elections.

- Bleak opinions of the Democratic Party are ""not preventing voters from preferring a Democratic Congress,"" Walter said.

- Still, everyone in power has reason to worry, Miringoff said. ""This is also an anti-incumbent message.""

- As Washington grows more polarized and political fights more heated, voters' frustrations with government extends to the ways Republicans and Democrats view members of the opposite political parties.

- Sixty-five percent of Democrats say Republicans are mostly dishonest, and 85% say Republicans are closed-minded. Seventy-two percent of Republicans say Democrats are dishonest, and 82% say Democrats are closed-minded.

- With Republicans controlling government in Washington, independent voters are more likely to side with Democrats on these measures of trust. Half of independents say Democrats are mostly open-minded while nearly a third say the same about Republicans. Half of independents also say Republicans are mostly dishonest while about a third say the same about Democrats.

- This fracturing of trust and the political disagreements exposed are likely to deepen as the country prepares to enter a divisive midterm election year.",26,1763570091.0,Defeat_Project_2025,1,0.94,False

Premise – “The Veil Must Hold.”
Most people in Harrowgate think it’s just another tired river city:
bad weather, worse politicians, a downtown that won’t admit it’s rotting, and sirens at 3 a.m. that everyone’s learned to ignore.

They don’t know about the Pact.

Centuries ago, when humans first realized monsters were real, the world almost tore itself apart. Out of that chaos, an agreement was hammered together between ancient Vampire Houses, the hidden courts of the Fae, witches, shifters, demons, and a handful of humans who were willing to burn their souls for peace.

The rules were simple:
	•	Monsters stay hidden.
	•	Magic stays out of the spotlight.
	•	Humanity gets to keep pretending nothing lurks in the dark.

Anyone—human or otherwise—who breaks those rules gets a visit from one of the many human organizations made up of what are known as Slayers. Men and women who have taken it upon themselves to make sure what lives on in the horror stories and legends of humanity stay exactly where they belong. As stories and myths outside of the limelight of the world stage. 

Between them and the fragile peace are:
	•	Four ancient vampire Houses (Vernescu, Solayne, Ashur, Kuroda) quietly running the world’s undead politics.
	•	Packs of shifters holding onto territory by their teeth. Werewolves and skinwalkers who live on the literal edge of humanity
	•	Fae courts hiding behind perfect coffee shops and shady contracts.
	•	Ghouls, cryptids, demons, ghosts, and things under the river that don’t have names anymore except the ones humanity uses in their ghost stories. 

The Veil is cracking. Bodies are turning up in ways even mundane cops can’t hand-wave. Someone is testing the limits of the Pact, and Harrowgate is the pressure valve that’s about to blow.

That’s where you come in.

⸻

What You’d Be Playing
You’ll create a character rooted in the Hidden World of Harrowgate, working with or against the powers and forces of the dark.

 Possible concepts include:
	•	Another Slayer (human or something “else”) on the payroll who doesn’t trust monsters.
	•	A monster trying to be better: a spawn vampire, a guilt-ridden shifter, a fae exile, a specter bound to someone’s bad decision.
	•	A Pact functionary (lawyer, fixer, investigator) trying to keep this fragile agreement from collapsing.

Tone-wise, think:
	•	Urban horror + character drama – neon-soaked alleys, bodies in storm drains, arguments in 24-hour diners after hunts.
	•	Morally grey choices – protecting the Veil sometimes means letting terrible things slide… or becoming one yourself.
	•	Found family / found enemies – complicated alliances, reluctant partnerships, “I hate you but I will die for you” energy.

⸻

Table & Player Vibes
Looking for players who:
	•	Enjoy dark themes (violence, horror, moral ambiguity) but can handle them respectfully.
	•	Love character-driven stories, flawed PCs, and slow-burn relationships (friendship, rivalry, romance if we all vibe).
	•	Are okay with a mix of action, mystery, and emotional fallout scenes.
	•	Are 18+.

*Time stopped and you lost everything. The fire burned your home, your livelihood, your neighbors friends, and family. In a single, endless, moment of panic and choking smoke your village was reduced to ash. You survived, but your life will never be the same.*

*Weeks later. Others survived. Now the refugees look to you for guidance. You haven't lost everything, but you still might. Winter is nipping at your heels as you make your way to the city hoping to sell what few possessions you have for food and shelter.*

*Months later. You are still together. Still surviving. All overcrowded into a makeshift tenement trying your best to stay warm. The Duke heard your petition, given you assurance he will appeal the Assembly for resources to help you rebuild by spring. It's in the hands of the bureaucracy now. While the powerful debate your situation without you, fever is beginning to spread.*

*Spring comes. Not everyone made it through winter, but most did. You get the news, you won't be returning home. The Assembly is giving your homeland to the church where they will build another temple in the name of the Wright. They will give you resources to rebuild along with land grant of five farlongs in the wild frontier beyond the long wall. This is a blessing, they say, an opportunity to spread civilization in the name of the republic. You may not like it, but you accept. The powers that be are not kind to those who refuse their generosity. Besides, you have nowhere else to go.*

*Now. You, along with a few other survivors, have arrived in Mort- the last town by the sea at the end of the wall. Soon you will venture into the frontier beyond the border. You've heard rumors of a land primal and strange. How much is true remains to be seen. Your task is to scout out a new home, a place to rebuild. Maybe this is a real opportunity after all. Maybe there exists a promised land where you can build a new home and live a new life. The first step is finding it.*

# Who

I'm Conor. Online I go by Roy. I have no pronoun preference, and I'm very supportive of LGBTQ+ folks. 

I have a lot of experience running ttrpgs, but I've never run Zweihander and never run a play-by-post. I want to try doing both.

# What

A Zweihander: Reforged play-by-post. Zweihander is a low-fantasy roll-under percentile system that seems to blend a lot of old school and new school design. It intrigues me and I want to see how it feels to run.    

I've got an original campaign rolling around in my head and I need to get it out somehow. The game would focus on exploring a wild frontier and meeting the people who inhabit it. I've been heavily inspired by the 2022 text-based game: Roadwarden. I believe that Zweihander's low-fantasy, morally ambiguous, and humanity focused vibe all mesh well with the source material.

# Where 

Private Discord server with Dice Maiden for rolls and a shared cloud drive for character sheets.

# When

The plan is to play ongoing and asynchronously. I plan to dedicate an hour each day with my morning coffee to check in, set the scenes, call for checks, respond to players, move the narrative forward, etc. The idea is to have a game where players post daily without making it a major time commitment.

# Why

Couple of reasons:
1) I've got this campaign brewing in my head and I know I won't be able to get it out until I run it, and my usual table is booked solid for the foreseeable future.
2)I've always liked the idea of play-by-post and I really want to try running one. It's also something I think I can fit into my schedule now- where a proper weekly session just wouldn't work.

# Interested?
 
If you want to play, I'm looking for between 2 - 4 players. You don't need to have experience with play-by-post, or Zweihander. I'm going to keep the game very rules-lite and add complexity as we go.

If you are interested, or have questions, you can DM me here or on Discord (@roy_rock_on). Happy to chat with folks. Thanks all :)",0,1763569866.0,pbp,0,0.5,False

1p1c962,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p1c962,Reze Movie/Arc analysis Part 1,"Warning: What I've written is quite a lot and contains spoilers.

I think most people would agree that this film, and this arc in general, is a masterpiece.

It starts right in the first few seconds of the film, where Denji has another dream about the door, which is meant to hint at an important plot point: Denji's killing of his father, something he'd kept buried deep inside due to his trauma. However, it's not particularly relevant to this arc.

In the intro, we see Denji, Aki, and Power going to work, but we also see rats highlighted, suggesting that Makima is always somehow present. Which is actually quite creepy.

Afterward, Makima offers Denji a date. When they start their movie marathon, Makima always rates the film afterward, saying, for example, that it's rather average, etc. This is probably meant as a critique of modern times, because there are many films that are simply soulless. Which wasn't the case before. Of course, there were bad movies back then too, but there were more good ones.

Denji had always wondered why, for example, he didn't laugh or feel sad during a particular movie while others did. And he'd been wondering for a while if he even had a heart, which is a big part of his character development.

For example, when Himeno died, he felt nothing and wondered if that was normal. And yes, it is normal, because Denji simply hadn't known Himeno for very long or had much to do with her; after all, she wanted to kill him too. That's human nature; you can't feel deeply sad if you had no connection to that person.

But back to the movies. Denji just couldn't connect with them. Because nothing like that had ever happened to him, and he couldn't understand it. But then, during the last movie, a simple, short scene that could have such a powerful effect made him cry, and Makima too. He didn't know why he suddenly started crying, but deep down he understood because the film scene depicts a profound connection between two people, which can be interpreted on different levels. For him, Pochita was also that connection, and at the same time, he too is searching for love.

Regarding the film scene again, this film actually exists, and it's a Russian film (which is a little teaser for a certain Russian character who appears shortly). The film is about a son and his mother. I don't know what else happens in the film. But the way this scene was portrayed was very important because there was no unnecessary music, no dialogue, nothing just the gestures of finally seeing each other and embracing. This scene becomes important again later, which is what happens at the end of the film.

It was somewhat similar with Makima because, as the control devil, she finds it difficult to have an equal relationship with someone who is on her eye sight. This moment gave us deeper insights into her character. As at the end of Part 1, Pochita said that Makima needed hugs. But she was raised by the PS, and as a result, her nature fully developed under control. She's envious of people who get that. But this isn't meant to be a Makima analysis.

After the movies, Denji asked Makima if he even had a heart, and she touched his chest and said yes. This scene becomes even more profound when you know what happens later. She simply wanted to feel/hear Pochita and didn't care about Denji at all. This gives the scene a completely different meaning.

If you've already read Chainsaw Man, you have to imagine some scenes as if you don't know what happens next. If you do that, you'll find a lot of foreshadowing, which is really crazy.

Then there's the moment when Denji and Reze first met in the phone booth. It was either a genuine coincidence, which is why Reze was laughing, or she was following him. But I think it was a coincidence. She was probably about to kill Denji at that moment, but he'd unleashed his Rizz abilities, and that's why she fell in love. I've often read that Reze fell in love later or something, but it happened right then and there. After two weeks of seeing each other at the coffee shop, Reze wondered why Denji wasn't in school, because in her eyes, it's completely messed up to have a 16-year old boy working as a demon hunter, which is true, and something she can relate to, but we learn more about that later. It's just a little hint that she's been thinking about it a lot.

When they finally got to school, they both really enjoyed that moment, enjoyed school a bit, and so on. But then came a very important scene for the movie, the beautiful pool scene. I've often read that many see this as fan service, which it isn't. This scene simply depicts the freedom of that moment, how they're free from thoughts outside the scene and simply enjoy it. They're just two teenagers in love having fun. And both of their guards were down, firstly, of course, because they were naked in the water, but mostly for Reze, who couldn't properly use her ability in the water. She wasn't Bomb Devil in that moment, she was Reze and the same goes for Denji.

Meanwhile, we also see a spider and a moth getting caught in its web. This can be interpreted in several ways because the people representing the spider and the moth are often changed. On the one hand, it could be that Reze is the moth because falling in love with Denji instead of taking his heart was her downfall from the beginning. On the other hand, Denji is also the moth because Reze is the Bomb Devil. Then again, both are the moth and the water is the spider, because at the end of the film, Denji wraps Reze up and jumps into the water with her. Or Makima is the spider and the moth is Reze and Denji, because their plan wouldn't have worked from the start, since Makima is there. You see, you can use this back and forth.

I'd stop with the analysis for now, because there's already a lot to take in. 💀 I'd be very interested in your opinions and interpretations. I'd be happy if you like this post and want a Part 2 that goes all the way to the end of the film.

And, seriously, y’all’s comments and reviews have definitely opened my eyes to DT skincare and beauty! 
This is probably my 3rd DT trip focused on finding some of the items that have been mentioned here, but first time to share a haul ☺️

I have already repurchased some items that I have tried and loved and are now part of my routine, so thank you to all the members who share their reviews, swatches and hauls ❤️

I just came back from a 2-week long trip, and prepping for a week-long trip coming up in less than a month so some of my buys are kinda travel-focused while the learnings from the recent trip are fresh ( I’m a reformed serial overpacker who now tries to stick with carry-on + personal item only)

What I got:
1 - tech bag (has a mesh front and a strap handle, I almost did not buy this but now regretting that I did not get more! It’s surprisingly sturdy, and will be used to corral everything but tech items 😅)
2 - quilted sunnies bag - so pretty and the squeeze opening works well
3 - Odoban spray - will need to decant, but hoping this will work on clothing items that I will not be able to hand wash on my trip
4 - Revive Rx body spray - saw so many posts praising this, and hoping my chronically dry skin will do well with it!
5 - biopure 70% alcohol wipes (when the tiny alcohol pads are not enough)
6 - penguin silicone squeeze bottle - silicone bottles have been a conundrum for me since they honestly take up a lot of room, but they also work best for getting out product. This one is a little bit more compact but long, and not to mention, cute ☺️ 
7 - hair clips
8 - Freeman candy cane cocoa sheet masks, pack of 4 - not sure if they’re good, but it’s a 4-pack y’all!
9 - bpure clean beauty mascara - tried this based on reviews from the sub, and so far liking it on my super straight, super sparse lashes
10 - 2-pack pill boxes with the dividers, love these particular ones for storing jewelry
11 - finally found more of the cases!! Both stores were fully stocked with brown/tan ones to go with the mocha and almond vanilla scents (shown #13), one store had solid pink ones that I’m going to use with my passionfruit scented spray 
12 - repair foot cream - I think I have seen good reviews for this, just need to remember to apply regularly to my poor feet that are still recovering from all the walking
13 - mocha coffee and almond vanilla sprays
14 - Dermasil eczema relief lotion, have also read good things about this one, haven’t tried but their OG Dermasil lotion have worked for me
15 - Vit C jelly eye masks - repurchase! Love these, not sure how effective they really are, but they feel good and seems to somewhat help with my under eye puffiness
16 - travel silicone dressing bottle - purchased this before the penguin, and since it’s a lot bulkier, probably won’t take on my trip, and will use for something else
17 - coloring bookmarks - just thought they were cute and I may bring some on my trip in case I decide to not watch yet another movie in the plane
18 - bpure hyaluronic lotion - probably my new holy grail. I know my skin loves hyaluronic acid and it’s been responding so well to this one - definitely will be repurchasing 
19 - makeup blender and case - honestly bought more for the case, but now questioning if I even want to add the bulk to my packing. lol, will probably end up stuffing my blender in a sandwich bag 😅

2.) Do not step outside after 8pm. You will cease to exist

3.) Make sure all nighttime staff are on task

4.) Give nighttime staff breaks

13.) Check the camera feeds regularly to manage the staff

I got a new job recently, and all in all, it's a pretty solid deal. I manage the graveyard shift at a few sites, but the most frequent is at a big office building. 

Aside from the sentient shredder and chaotic evil coffee maker, it was pretty straightforward. Sure, the building doesn't technically exist overnight, but the pay is incredible and the employees are… something else.

I didn't quite know what to make of the cryptic instructions laid out for me, but I was committed to making this job work. The hazard pay alone meant I could retire in my early forties, and how bad could helping some crazy so-called necromancer be? How was I supposed to know the job really meant it?

My first shift was about what you'd expect. I sat down in the security room, with the list of instructions. First and foremost, I had to monitor the building as the daytime employees exited. The moment the clock struck 8pm, the external camera feeds all fell to static. I checked my instructions, unsure of whether to really accept that this would happen. They claimed it would, but it was still alarming.

I swapped the feed to the time clock, then did a double take. The floorboards were shaking fiercely. I braced for an earthquake, but it never came. Then the floorboards began to crack, then they shattered. Desiccated arms reached upwards, grasping at the edges of the holes they'd made.

Then they pulled themselves upward. 

My rationality swooped in, assuring me it was some special effects or a prerecorded film, or something. There was no way the undead were loose in the building. Right? RIGHT?!

I grit my teeth as my survival instincts fought my legs. I committed myself to seeing the basement for myself. I made my way down the ungodly amount of steps (the elevator was out of service), stopping on the first floor to peer outside. A wide, empty expanse lay beyond the doors. I tried pushing them open, but they wouldn't budge. I tried unlocking it, but the keyhole was missing. It wasn't covered, it seemed to have vanished altogether. 

Down the last flight of stairs, and I came to a door. This one was different from all the others. It was built from scrap wood, appearing closer to a flattened wine barrel than a door in an office building.

Through a crack between the boards, I peered into the basement. Then I turned around and ran. Up the steps, all the way back to the security room. I didn't know it was possible to climb twenty some odd flights of steps that quickly. I dove into the room and slammed the door behind me. I pushed a filing cabinet in front of the door, then fell to my knees.

I wasn't out of shape, per se, but the adrenaline was quickly flushing out, leaving me sore and regretting many life choices. My main regret at that moment was taking this godforsaken job. I crawled over to the monitors, barely managing to pull myself back into the rolling chair.

I cycled through the cameras until I located them. I checked the corner of the screen to see the floor number. They had already climbed to floor seven. They would soon be upon me.

I tried dialing 911, but there was no service. Not even a network capable of emergency calls. Hopelessness crept in as I began accepting my fate. My last lifeline was the list of instructions. Watch everyone exit before 8pm. Do not go outside. Greet your staff. Send your staff on their breaks… the list continued, but was incredibly useless. I had half a mind to rip the paper to shreds, but I figured it was useless, so why bother. I tried dialing the police again and again, until a knocking began on the other side of the door.

I tried to ignore it. I tried staying calm as the knocking continued. Every twenty seconds, like clockwork, a single bang reverberated through the steel door. I hadn't cycled the cameras to follow the group's ascent, instead hiding underneath the desk.

Five minutes in, and fifteen knocks later, something changed. “Buh-ah-sss” a raspy voice hissed. Great, I went and lost my mind. “Wha-tuh isss ow-er jah-buh to-nigh-tuh?”

Tears began streaming down my face as I shivered. The voice was dry and gravely. As if it were forced over frayed vocal cords. “Ju-just leave me be!” I cried, pulling the chair closer in a futile attempt to protect myself.

I heard muffled shifting, then silence, on the other side of the door. Some time passed, and I slowly inched out from below the desk. The silence remained, so I scrolled through the cameras, finding the one just outside the security room. 

There they were. All fifty or so of them, lounging around patiently. The one closest to the door leaned against it, its one good eye staring directly into the camera. Something inside of me, maybe morbid curiosity, stirred. “Wave to the camera,” I called, loud enough for the things in the hall to hear me. All at once, fifty half decayed hands waved.

“Buh-ah-sss, pu-lee-suh give usss orr-dursss,” the one eyed ghoul called through the door, after turning to face it. For some reason, I tried it. “You, in the corner,” I started, using the microphone. The zombie I addressed pushed itself upright, although one leg was mostly bone. “Please go empty the garbage in the cubicles. Floor two.”

The zombie saluted, then marched out of view. I cycled backwards, watching the thing march down a flight of stairs. It then pushed a wheeled gray trash bin, reaching below each desk and dumping the contents into the gray bin. Once the bin was full, the undead paused, staring up at the camera, expectantly.

“Grab another bin, and continue,” I instructed, slightly annoyed at the obvious course of action, yet more amused at my newfound power. Sure enough, the zombie returned the full bin, and swapped it for an empty one. Then it returned to its rounds.

The whole while, I kept one eye on the hallway feed. The undead maintained their positions, sitting eerily still. Dead still.

“Bah-sss, what el-sss wa-duh you have usss do?” The zombie at the door slurred in its gravel throat.

Unsure of what to do or say, I gave my next order. “Each of you, by the steps,” I called. “Pick a floor and empty those garbages. If your bins fill, swap them for an empty one and continue. Recycling too.”

Just then, a searing pain screamed from the hand holding the printed instructions. My hand was glued to the page, my fingers refusing to let go. After what felt like an eternity, the purple glow faded, leaving behind a smooth, crisp brand. I hugged the hand close to my chest, writhing on the floor. The pain disappeared, and I gingerly appraised the mark.

It was skull shaped, with teeth clenched. Around it, bordered an intricate circle with tiny symbols at five points, evenly spaced apart. I gently rubbed the tender area, but it did not smudge. I tried to use more force, but it only stretched the skin and that was painful, so I gave up.

The zombie on the other side of the door said something again… but it wasn't broken anymore. “Boss, there's a lot to do. What would you like the rest of us to do?”

My heart skipped a beat as I peered up at the hallway feed. The crowd had thinned, but there were still zombies.

“Come again?” I asked, dumbfounded.

“Boss, we don't have all night. Can you please direct us?”

I felt a twinge of annoyance, but quickly accepted the reality that I had wasted the better part of an hour, since the doors had closed. I grit my teeth and gave an order, “You, at the door, help me straighten things up in here. The rest of you,” I paused, nerves wavering. “Um… straighten up the floors, clean the bathrooms, then report back to me.”

The door began to shake immediately. My eyes shot to the screen, and I watched the undead army march out of view. Save for the one at the door, which rattled it by the knob. 

A twinge of pain shot through my hand, and I glanced down. My brow furrowed as the brand glowed a dull orange. Against my better judgement, I unlocked the door. Like clockwork, the creature pushed inside. It effortlessly breached the filing cabinet, extending one gnarled hand towards me.

I recoiled, but the zombie froze. Its hand remained outstretched, one unblinking eye trained on my eyes. Hesitantly, I accepted the disgusting handshake. My brows furrowed at the flash that occurred when our hands touched. While we shook our hands, I didn't see the rotting corpse. I saw the man he once was. The very man who had arranged for me to land this position.

My stomach dropped as I understood my fate. So long as I lived and wherever I went, this would be my final resting place. 

If the necromancer is out there, can I at least get an assistant manager? Fifty employees are a lot to keep track of. Also, can we get the basement door fixed, the employees say there's a draft during the daytime. ",2,1763569521.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

I'm a non-coding tech founder building an app that allows you to see when your friends are free, request a hang out with them, and ultimately see your friends more in real life. I've had this idea for over a year and finally figured it's time to try my hand at bringing it to life with vibecoding tools. 

  
This is my first time building anything or starting a tech venture, and I think I'm at the validation stage now of this prototype/mvp. Right now, it's a vibecoded web app that's super ugly (currently trying to figure out how to get my Figma Make mock UI to sync up with my working codebase, lol), but I have plans to turn this into a full fledged mobile app if people like it. It's something that I personally need in my life, but I'm curious if other people have the same problem. Think, busy millennials coordinating scheduled between babies, work trips, weddings, hobbies, etc, but without having to share your entire Google Calendar with everyone you've ever met. It's more private: you just share your availability with the people who you want to see it, and it's intentional: you say exactly what type of hang you have energy for. 

[App link here](https://avaleoriginal.vercel.app/) 

Main features: Create an account -> add friends -> create availability time slots to share with specific people, dictated by type of activity or vibe -> send requests to friends who share their availability to you and book time with them

Secondary features: create groups of friends, create a bookable link to send to a friend for a one-off purpose (i.e. catching up with an old coworker over coffee, they don't need to see all your avails and such), chat in the app to coordinate hangs.
