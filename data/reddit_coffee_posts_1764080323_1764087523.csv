I am anemic and definitely struggle to get all the necessary water intake i should a day. I just drank coffee so that’s attributing to the color of my tongue but often it’s white a lot, even after brushing, flossing, scrapping and using mouth wash. I also have this spot on my tounge, it’s not always there but always around that same spot that there’s no pain but it’s just a little weird and makes me worried. No color on it even when the rest of my tongue is pink or whitish. I think it’s contributing to my bad breath. What can i do? ",1,1764087494.0,askdentists,1,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

1p6gmdn,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoetryWritingClub/comments/1p6gmdn/figure_4_is_the_meat_of_this_paper_cw_sexual/,Figure 4 is the Meat of This Paper (Cw: sexual assault),"I'd greatly appreciate some feedback! :-) 

**Figure 4 is the Meat of This Paper.**

In graduate school,  
My biggest flex  
Was getting laid  
On a weeknight.

Rolling up to lab meeting,  
Hickeymaxing to convey:  
I got fresh dick  
AND fresh data.  
What up  
You fucking nerds!

Note, though,  
There can be no tryst  
Sans trust.

Trust is electricity  
powering the switch  
That controls consent.

 

Consent, one minute,  
Can be on,  
The same consent,  
The next minute  
Can be off.

Like his condom, one minute,  
Was on.  
That same dick-sheath,  
The next minute  
Was off.

The pig rutted  
And pushed  
And groaned  
And filled  
Me with PEP.

As in:  
Post-exposure prophylaxis:  
A high-dose retroviral  
Retrospective  
In pill form  
Given to guilty boys  
Who took a load  
Of trouble.

“It’s like driving,”  
Underpaid Dr. Evans  
Of Student Health said:

“You could drive  
Defensively, very defensively,  
But, say, someone  
Rams their car  
Into you: is that  
Your fault?”

The Walgreens guy  
Grumbled at Gilead  
Until they gave  
Up Truvada free.  
It’s always free  
For at-risk youth.

Gilead, as in,  
Pharma Gilead,  
Not the scary place  
The handmaids  
Warned about.

I had a timepoint  
That day.  
Timepoint, as in,  
The final day  
For humanized mice  
Suffering in a study  
I made up.

They asked for none of this.   
  
Some I’d stuck  
With poison and cancer  
And good wishes.  
I gave antidote  
To some  
Post-tumor hardening.  
  
Others got it  
As PrEP,

 As in Pre-exposure Prophylaxis.

PrEPpy mice for  
A PEPpy boy.

That final day  
Is a day  
Of harvest.  
Tumor harvest.  
  
I never want  
Them awake,  
Not for this.

  
The ritual thus:  
Isofluorane for sleep,  
Scalpel for stripping  
Open skin as  
Scissors snip that  
Wispy peritoneal membrane,  
And forceps for careful  
Tumor retrieval for  
Weighing and, finally,  
Formaldehyde.

Today  
That day  
I didn’t want to be there:  
The ritual broke  
A bit.

Don’t do this,  
But, you can,  
In a pinch,  
Snip open  
 A pinch  
Of mouse skin:  
Grab the ends  
And pull.  
Hard.  
Peel him open.

“Push his shirt up  
And  
Pull his pants down!”

That was what  
The vet tech  
Called that.  
  
That day  
I peeled mine open.  
Weighed their tumors  
And, in formaldehyde,  
Drowned to preserve  
Those aberrant growths  
That get everywhere.

The survival study ritual  
 is easier:  
You merely count  
The dead  
And  
Hope  
That  
The right mice died.

So I counted  
Cage after cage,  
All the while  
Patting the seat  
Of my scrubs.  
There was clamminess  
Between my legs,  
I thought.  
I felt it:  
The slimy streak  
Of his seed  
Slithering so slowly  
Down my left leg.  
His spermatozoa,  
I imagine,  
Cackling  
With the elan  
Of having  
Pulled  
It  
Off.

If you look  
At my paper—  
highly cited, *of course*,  
In The Journal of Clinical Investigation,  
The survival curve lines  
Of figure 4c  
Are his streaks  
Sliding,  
Stopping,  
Drooping,  
Sliding,  
Stopping.

  
The tumor weights  
In figure 4d  
Are the dumbbells  
75 lbs each—  
Big boy weight--  
I was carrying  
When  
At long last  
The tears came.

  
Assuredly, not  
My first time  
Crying in the weight room.

Sometimes, I think,  
The Irish accent  
Was the basis  
Of mine  
and Saoirse’s  
Friendship.

At a café   
That served   
2 things:  
Great aesthetics,  
Shit coffee

She concluded:  
“You were raped, Akshat.""

Infuriating word.  
That extra-buzzy  
Irish /r/?  
Delicious.

“Don’t be silly, Saoirse!  
That’s not what that was!  
I would know:   
I was there!

I should’ve been smarter,  
That’s all.  
Just  
Should’ve been smarter.”

So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

After a failed first attempt with an nh34, which taught me a few lessons and made me realized I was missing a few critical tools… here we are with round 2. Success! 

GMT master 2 style build 

-nh34a AliX sourced 
-AliX case, dial, and hands
-Uncle Straps jubilee
-crap non solid end links for now as I ordered the wrong ones from uncle straps initially 

I’ve got what I think is a more appropriate cyclops GMT master case on the way that I feel should get me closer to a more period correct GMTM2 homage, which is what I was going for here. I’m fast approaching the big 4-0 and I’ve got my eyes on a ‘vintage’ gmt master 2 or exp 2 and now I’m wondering if I even need to add one to my collection! Ha! 

I’m also waiting on the few last parts for a paul Newman style exp 2 vintage build as well as an open heart nh38 build for the wife who thinks this is cool as shit and wants one! 

So, community… thoughts for a first timer? 

Lastly, a few questions:

-where do you guys source higher quality cases and components? AliX is great for sure but in some cases I wouldn’t mind paying for higher quality cases and components 
-what’s the next step above nh series seiko movements? I’m still new to this but would like to research higher end builds in the future
-quality custom dial printing? Do you have an AliX trusted vendor, or do you source elsewhere? It would be cool to do custom dials for gifts here and there.
-If I wanted to add some ‘patina’ to my hands, is coffee staining the best method?

LOVING THIS. Thanks for sending me down the rabbit hole into a fun hobby that is slowly chipping away at some winter cash but more importantly making the colder northeast mo more enjoyable! ",0,1764086958.0,SeikoMods,0,0.5,False

21M here who has never been on a date, or in a relationship. But few weeks ago, I started chatting with one girl. And she is absolutely amazing. We have quite a lot in common, we talk about many different things, joke around, our energy matches really well.

We live in a different towns, she lives hour away from me, but I go there quite often, so that isn't a problem. She has been suggesting some places like cafes, and cool things I need to see and visit. We already talked about it indirectly and decided that we should meet when I come there.

I didn't have time to go there, but I am free now, and will go there soon. So I need advices and ideas for this date.

I've been thinking to meet with her in the centre, and take her to one of the places she suggested, go for a simple coffee date, just to talk with her, and see if we click irl like we do on texts. Btw we talked about some books, and she was asking me about one book that I've read, and I told her if she is interested I can gift if to her, and she also told me that she will give me her favorite book, so we even have gifts for eachother lol.

There is one cool museum that was opened there not long ago, and I've thought that I should maybe take her there, but idk. Maybe just a simple coffee date is cool for the first time.

1p6gesd,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p6gesd,"The best cup of coffee at home, before making pecan pie","Actually I powered through getting the dough ingredients organized.

My story is that a dear friend whom I met in the last year went to Guatemala knowing that I love coffee. She brought me back coffee and a beautiful cup. I did not use the cup today. The coffee was from the plantation where they did medical work, but it was preground. I thought that I hated coffee from that country, as a coffee shop local to me (Bongo Java, in Nashville) often served Guatemalan coffee and I just wasn’t getting anything. But then I did half dark, half light drip from Bongo Java, and it was great.

On a whim I picked up the featured coffee Finca El Sarral from Oye Coffee Co. at  Kroger at a discount from the website.

We just have the Cuisinart DBM-8 for an electric burr grinder. We got a free manual grinder, and it’s lovely. But my hands are injured from baking, and it’s painful to use. (Yes. I should see about surgery even belatedly.) but it worked like a charm.

It’s the best cup of coffee that I’ve made at home. The tasting notes are on point. I would say that I got a hint of sweet potato and that it was mildly tannic as well.

I just winged the amount of beans, and it turned out perfectly for this Moka pot. I got two cups (of the cup that I picked up years ago when the previous owners of the beach house we rented sold and left the goods for taking).

It was lovely. Perhaps tomorrow I’ll use the beautiful cup from Guatemala that is otherwise a display piece.",2,1764086877.0,cafe,0,1.0,False

So, I’ll start from the beginning.. I grew up in a small-ish city in Ontario, Canada with my mom and my dad who separated before i even came out of my mother’s womb. I lived with my mom for most of my life but I moved in with my dad and my step-mom when I was 13 due to issues I was having with my mom and lack of proper guidance in the home (I was missing a lot of school and would pretty much be allowed to do whatever O wanted). Living with my dad and step-mom was nice but that’s not really relevant to the story. So my dad has 2 siblings, a brother and a sister, who I barely know. I haven’t seen my uncle since I was around 7 years old and I grew up only seeing my aunt just one handful of times in the span of 15 years and then saw her a little more frequently as I grew into a young adult. This is because she lived in Toronto, Ontario.. which is 2.5 hours from where I live and she doesn’t drive and regular visits just weren’t a thing while I was growing up, so with all this being said I’ve never really known her..

In February of 2018, I had my first baby, a son and my aunt was still living in Toronto at the time and she wanted to be more involved in his life so she started taking the train down here to visit in the summer and around Christmas time. I’ve never minded my aunt so it was just nice to have her around because I knew she got lonely a lot up in Toronto all by herself. She didn’t have many friends and she also doesn’t speak to her and my dads brother (my uncle) and there’s really not much other family out there that we know about. My aunt gets bullied a lot too, she has NF1 (Neurofibromatosis Type 1) which means she has tumour growths covering most of her skin all over her body. I did not mind having her come stay in my home whenever she wanted to come visit my son, and she was always really happy to be around loved ones which made me happy. 

In 2021, I had another son, which again, she wanted to be more involved so we continued with the visits. She couldn’t come down to visit as often as when my first son came along because she worked as a Nanny up in Toronto and needed to keep her job to be able to pay rent where she lived. As time went on she started struggling more and more with money and I felt bad so I would lend her money sometimes but she never would pay it back, I knew it was because she was in a financial crisis so I let it slide, I mean she’s family so it is what it is.

Now that you have a little backstory about how little I actually knew about my aunt, I can get into what happened. In the summer of 2024, my aunt texted me to tell me that her facebook got hacked and asked if I could help her retrieve her account. I tried to but ultimately I couldn’t get it back so I reported the facebook and got some friends to do so as well and I went ahead and made my aunt a brand new facebook account, so of course, I knew the login information (this is important for later). After I successfully created a new account for her and re-added all her pictures I saved from her old account because I still had it on my friends list, I started re-adding all her friends and what little family we have. My aunt and I got to talking afterward and I found out she couldn’t work anymore because of her back problems and complications from her NF1. She told me she was depressed and on the verge of homelessness and drinking her pain away every night because she had no desire to buy food or anything other than alcohol with her grocery money. I sat with this information for a few days and then I offered to let her move into my apartment with me and my two son’s (7 and 3 at the time), now mind you it’s only a 2 bedroom apartment and it’s me and 2 children. My children share the biggest bedroom and I have the other bedroom but I gave it to my aunt and I moved to the couch in the living room and she agreed to pay me $500 a month to rent the room.

My aunt arrived the end of September 2024, she didn’t bring much stuff and I found out she left behind a lot which made me wonder why considering we could have made room for her dresser, desk, kitchen stuff etc but she just didn’t want to bring anything other than her clothing, her photo albums and her keurig coffee maker. She got settled in and I was very happy to have her.

The first 2 months of her living here went great. She was helpful around the house, she helped out with her great nephews and she paid rent to me, I was happy with the arrangement. Come December though, things started to change… drastically. She was worried about not being able to afford christmas gifts for people and asked me if she could pay me double rent in January instead of paying in December so she could afford gifts. I said yes of course.. come christmas time she had NO gifts for anyone.. and no money. I let it slide and didn’t question it because christmas isn’t really about gifts anyways and I don’t care but i found it weird she wanted to keep the rent money to get people gifts but then didn’t have gifts or any money. So after that, she started not buying any food for herself because she didn’t have any money, so everything fell onto my shoulders. I have two children, both autistic, my youngest being level 3 autistic and completely non-verbal and my oldest level 1 autistic and he has a rare eating disorder called ARFID (avoidant restrictive food intake disorder) and money is pretty tight for me too and I have my own struggles, but I would be buying whatever she needed because she didn’t have the money to provide for herself, even though she was getting a monthly check from the government. 

I started noticing some pretty weird behaviours from her just after christmas of 2024. I had planned on going to my best friends house to have some drinks on new years eve and she tagged along while my kids were with a sitter. It was me, my aunt, my best friend, her boyfriend and my youngest son’s dad (who I am friends with but we’re not together) and we were all just going to drink and play games and watch the ball drop on TV. a few days before I found some cute light up new years eve headbands at the dollar store, so I got 2 of them because I wanted me and my bestie to have cute headbands. my aunt FLIPPED OUT.. she was screaming, crying and swearing at me because I didn’t think of her when I bought them. In all fairness, I could have gotten her one but I sometimes have sort of a one track mind and all I was thinking about was me and my bestie having matching light up headbands. I was on the phone with my bestie while she was flipping out and my aunt was screaming saying “I just wont go then! I’ll stay home!! you’re such a b*tch” and my bestie who was on speaker said “well good.. I don’t want you in my home anyways if you’re gonna act like this.” Well, she ended up coming and that was a huge mistake…

SHE DRANK WAY TOO MUCH.. we told her to take it easy but she wouldn’t listen. She ruined everyone’s night by crying and falling over and she passed out on the toilet and we had to help her and all that is fine but she refused to listen to any of us. She drank at least three quarters of a 40oz bottle of Bacardi and even after passing out and puking and hitting her head off the bathroom floor, she pretty much near threw me to the ground trying to get at the rest of what was in the bottle. We had to hide it. The whole next day when we got home she was profusely apologizing and I said its okay.. but not much else. For the whole month of January she was acting so bizarrely.. I was still buying groceries for her and she did not pay me any rent in January and I paid her phone bill for her so her service didn’t get cut. She was seeking attention on the regular. There was a night that my kids went to my youngest father’s (who took on the role of my oldest sons father) house for the weekend. I thought I’d sit down, get on the headset and play some fortnight with my bestie and our other friend. I was playing away when I checked my phone and my aunt messaged me from the bedroom saying she was sad and alone and needed me. I went into the room and she said she doesn’t want to be alone and I need to shut my game off and come sit with her and maybe watch a movie. I said no I don’t want to but I’m here to talk if she needs a listening ear and I’ll make sure to check on her in between games. I went back to playing my game because she said she didn’t want to talk about it right now and I got another message saying that she cut her wrist because nobody cares about her and everyone wants her to be alone.. So I went back in there and said that I could find her some resources if she’s struggling with self-harm and depression. She said no. I said there’s not much more I can do other than that.. she then told me to just go away.. so I went away. 10 minutes or so later she called me back in, she was standing against the wall saying she felt light headed and nauseous.. I said hold on, I will grab you some water, but something felt so off about this behaviour so after I left the room, I stood in the hallway and just peeked in the room.. I saw her spin around in a circle 3 times and then sit down gently on the floor.. she started yelling for me to come quickly.. I went in and she said “I just collapsed please I need you to stay and not be playing games with your friends. I’m more important” and thats when I really knew… she’s just blatantly attention seeking and I can’t handle this. I knew it was a lie so I said “I’ll call you an ambulance” to which she said “No don’t do that” and I said “Well, I’m not gonna stop gaming” and I left the room and ignored her for the rest of the night. Behaviours like this continued for the rest of the month. I should mention here, because it’s also important for later that a brand new iPad arrived at my door addressed to my aunt. I asked her how she could afford this and she said an online friend sent it to her as a late christmas gift. 

February 2025… I was playing cards with her on MY bed that she was sleeping in while I slept on the couch.. my oldest son was asleep on the bed and I noticed something crawling near his head on the pillow… I took a picture of it and googled it and yep.. it was a BEDBUG. I checked the mattress under all the folds and it was crawling with them… I have never had bedbugs in my life.. I immediately dragged my queen sized mattress straight outside onto the curb and bought a tag for it the next day so it could go out with the garbage. I got a hold of pest control, followed all their instructions and got my place sprayed 5 times over the course of 3-4 weeks and I myself got pretty depressed having to live out of garbage bags that were compiled in the hallway. It just wasn’t ideal and again, my aunt only gave me $100 for rent in February and I was still buying her groceries. The whole time she kept apologizing about the bedbugs until I finally said “why do you keep apologizing???” and then she admitted it. Her apartment in Toronto was infested with them and she knew she had them but didn’t want to tell me because she didn’t think I’d let her come live with us if I knew. I was angry.. but I didn’t throw her out for that.. and I get a lot of this may be my own fault because I let so much slide but I did have a breaking point and now let me tell you about that.

March 2025, near the end of the month, she didn’t pay any rent.. whatever, I took my kids to the mall for pictures with the easter bunny, they turned out so cute and I posted one of them as my profile picture on facebook, and I noticed a day later that it had 1 share and I was like what the hell? I clicked it and it was some random woman sharing it and she captioned it “ITS NOT JUST A CHRISTMAS MIRACLE 2024 ITS A EASTER MIRACLE 2025.. THE LITTLE MAN JUDE LOOKS VERY MUCH ALIVE!” … Jude is my youngest son btw. This had me so confused so I went back to my profile pictures for December 2024 and found the one of me and the boys with Santa at the mall and it also had one share that I didn’t notice before.. basically saying the same thing. I called my best friend and we talked about it and we both had a hunch that my aunt had something to do with this so I remembered that I had her facebook login. I logged in and searched this woman up and couldn’t find her.. so it hit me, this woman had my aunt blocked. I ended up getting a hold of her and holy f*ck guys my aunt was putting all her money in a bingo website and scamming her bingo friends for more money by saying Jude (3 years old at the time) had brain cancer and DIED. I confronted my aunt and she denied it but she could see the anger in my face and admitted that she lied about my son dying. I felt angry, I felt sick, and I felt dizzy and my son during that moment was with his dad and I felt like I missed him so much, I needed to see him to see he’s alive and well. It affected me so much, I couldn’t cope that day. I called my best friend back and she raced over and I called the cops to have her escorted off my property. I also found out that the iPad that got delivered for her was not a christmas gift for her, someone sent it for my older son to cope with the loss of of his little brother.. so anyways I found out my dad went and got her from a shelter and had her living with him and then helped her find a room to rent from someone and that my sister lent her the money to pay first and last months rent at the new place, and this all upset me a lot considering what she did. I thought he would care more about me and his grandson’s so I stopped talking to him for a while. 

I ultimately forgave him but now its near christmas time and my dad just told me that if my aunt can’t come to christmas dinner at my sisters this year then he will have to not come either to be with her instead so she’s not alone for christmas. We just got into a huge fight because I feel like he’s taking her side after everything she put me and my kids through.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.

As currently it feels very unequal between my husband and I. For starters, he works a physical job out of the home so he does have more personal things to prepare in the morning, while I work from home. 

Our kids are 12 and 9 so they can do a fair amount independently and we are working on them doing more, but they still need a fair amount of parent involvement to be up and ready for school on time. Currently my husbands morning routine is hot tub, coffee, shower, get self ready. This summer I asked because I am overwhelmed and he is home and a parent too, can he add make sure our son is up out of bed on time, and make our son breakfast (ensuring he eats it as he is underweight and low appetite). He does his morning routine between 5:30-7:30. My morning routine 6:30-8:30 is get our daughter up, her breakfast, pack everyone’s lunch (including husbands!), clean kitchen, follow up with both kids to ensure they are dressed, bags packed and they get to bus on time. I have tried switching husbands lunch to him but again he doesn’t do it and then has to buy lunch or eat 0 food. 

This morning we had a spat as my husband didn’t ensure our son ate, and didn’t want to follow through on it so I had to take over (making him breakfast and arguing with him that he needs to eat which he then did eat an English muffin with peanut butter). I also often have to take over waking him up or making his breakfast as husband takes too long in hottib and shower and doesn’t get to it in time . I think this is very unfair when our lists are already not equal. I want to have a minute for coffee in the morning while he makes sure our son is awake and eating. I have brought this up more than once but I can’t count on him consistently doing this task without me reminding. However he never needs to ask me if I made the kids a lunch or get my daughter awake or any of my jobs. 

This is leading to a lot of morning stress for me and resentment. I am thinking of switching morning tasks for a week entirely so he can see how I am feeling. What do you think? Suggestions?

1p6g3i1,https://www.reddit.com/r/appdev/comments/1p6g3i1/yet_another_calorietracking_app_hear_me_out/,Yet another calorie-tracking app?… hear me out,"Okay, so I’m trying to write this without using ChatGPT or some corporate launch announcement, so bear with me. 

I’ve tried the big calorie trackers (MyFitnessPal, Lifesum, all of them). And honestly, they’re good… for a few days. Then reality hits: the endless food searching, the weird portion sizes, the cluttered screens, the 47 different “premium” upsells. All these break my spirit and I quit. Every. Time.

So naturally, I did what any sane person would do: I built my own app like some feral engineer who simply wanted to track a sandwich without arguing with a database. And I called it Crumb - Calorie Tracker (wow!)  
[https://apps.apple.com/us/app/crumb-calorie-counter/id6754396931](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/crumb-calorie-counter/id6754396931)  


**Why I made this:**

**1. Food logging shouldn’t feel like homework**  
 All the major apps rely on you finding the *exact* item in a huge database, choosing the *exact* portion, and repeating that process five times a day. It gets exhausting. “Oh, you had chicken wrap? Did you mean one of these 32 nearly identical chicken wraps?” No. No I didn’t.  
With this app, you literally just type or dictate what you ate and it gives you instant AI-estimated calories, protein, carbs, and fiber.

**2. The big apps are… a lot**  
Charts, badges, leaderboards, graphs… I don’t need a UI that looks like a cockpit. I just want to know if my lunch was reasonable or if I should go on a small walk of shame.  
Crumb is intentionally minimal: you log food, it shows calories and macros. That’s it.

**3. The prices… oh Lord the prices**  
Some apps charge over $15/month for some features. And it's understandable because they genuinely have a lot of features. Crumb is free for 3 food entries per day and 5 saved meals. And then $9.99/month (which is less than a sandwich, and we'll ironically help you log it)

**4. “Why not add the ‘take a picture of your food’ feature?”**  
Ah yes, the holy grail of modern calorie tracking: point phone at plate → boom, instant nutrition facts.   
  
First, it’s kinda expensive to run. I’d have to charge $20+/month easy. And I don’t know about that  
  
Second, it’s not magic. If I take a picture of my coffee, how will it know how many creamers I put in?  
Or whether that pasta has a tablespoon of olive oil… or half the bottle?   
Or whether your salad is healthy… or hiding four pounds of ranch.   
Or what if I forget to take a picture when I ate the food?  
  
If you prefer the picture-taking style of apps, absolutely no shade. 

**5. About the AI stuff**  
Yes, yes, another AI app. Trust me, I get the irony. For this one, I chose to use Perplexity’s model because it pulls from real-time info online, and in my testing it’s been the most accurate. It’s still AI, so it won’t be perfect, but most of my tests landed within a 20–30% margin. Enough to keep me mindful and give me a general ballpark of what I ate

If you want to try it out, awesome. If you prefer the big apps, also awesome. I just wanted something simple and realistic for everyday life, and maybe someone else out there was looking for the same thing.

**Currently only for iOS, will release Android version in a few weeks.**

I've been developing this game for a while now and wanted to share it with you all. MeetYou is a romance game where you meet potential love interests through different interactive encounters - think coffee shop meetings, chance encounters at bookstores, that sort of thing. The idea is to make each interaction feel organic and meaningful rather than just clicking through dialogue trees.

Right now I'm at a stage where I really need some outside perspectives. I've been staring at this project for so long that I'm not sure what's working and what isn't anymore. If you've played it or even if you're just interested in dating sims in general, I'd really appreciate your feedback. What works? What feels clunky? Is there anything that breaks your immersion?

I'm also open to any suggestions you might have for improving the game. Whether it's about the mechanics, the writing, the encounter scenarios, or anything else - I'm all ears. Even if it's something I can't implement right away, it helps me think about the direction I want to take this.

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

1p6g0fm,https://v.redd.it/yzm0zla1df3g1,City Manager admits past lack of contract enforcement on Republic Services may have cost Palm Bay residents $1.5 Million (Video Recap),"This 60-second video summarizes the huge takeaways from the latest ""Coffee with the City Manager"" session:

1. **Trash Accountability:** City admits to years of failing to enforce the Republic Services contract, potentially losing $1M to $1.5M in damages.
2. **Budget Cuts:** Every department is mandated to model a **20% budget cut** this year to prepare for millage rate reduction.
3. **Transparency:** The city is finally planning a public comment period to fix the notoriously bad city website.

Do you think the 20% budget cuts are worth risking a drop in services? Read the full analysis with audio and transcript for context:

No daylight, no buffer, just Slack pings hitting my half awake brain. I was getting weirdly grumpy before standup and couldnt figure out why, because technically my life was way easier now.



One day I left my laptop at the office by mistake and had to walk 15 min to pick it up from the building security. That stupid little walk felt... really good? So I decided to recreate it. Now every weekday I set an alarm 30 min before work, make coffee in a thermos, put on shoes and do a ""fake train ride"" loop around my block. Same route, same playlist, no podcasts allowed, no checking email. When I get back, I literally hang my keys on a hook like I just got to the office and only then I open my laptop.



It sounds cringe but having that tiny ritual changed my mood a lot. I complain less in chats, my brain feels ""warmed up"" before meetings and I dont instantly hate whoever scheduled an 8am call. Anyone else doing some weird fake office routines like this or am I just losing it slowly.

1p6fweg,https://i.redd.it/qn4wwvqhaf3g1.png,"Shoulder to Shoulder men's community - walk, coffee and share in Hyde Park.","Hey guys,

You asked for more updates on our Shoulder to Shoulder men's community so here it is.

Wanted to share some more information on how our fortnightly walk and coffee events work and some of the feedback from the guys that came last weekend - see attached pic for some really heartwarming messages sent into the group.

We ask everyone to arrive at 11am, we normally set off at 11.20 latest. The meet point is the statue of Achilles (nearest tube, Hyde Park Corner).

Me and Dan (the other founder) do a little intro, ask anyone new to identify themselves and task those that have been before to make an effort to connect with the new guys (we had 35 newbies last weekend!).

We then we divide into smaller groups of 8-10 led by some of our amazing leadership group.

In these groups everyone introduces themselves, says why they're there and shares something they'd like to discuss on the walk. This could be anything from struggling to find meaning or purpose in their job, through to a challenge in their romantic relationship. We find this really powerful because it means the guys can find common ground very easily

We then we’ll do our normal route around the park, and at halfway we take a pause for a little reshuffle. This means the guys can connect with some different people if they'd like to.

The walks normally take about two hours, and honestly, everyone leaves a different person. It's life changing to some of the guys there. A great way to start a Sunday! Want to be clear after the last post, this is, and always will be, a free event.

We do loads of other events, talks, and have a thriving WhatsApp community with around 1,370 guys, but this is the one thing we're most proud of. The next one will be on December 7.

I'm a new SAHD since November 1,  I'm really loving the time and connection with my son but I feel like I'm not doing enough at home.

My son has multiple classes a week for songs and play, I take him for walks throughout the day, we go to coffee shops and other places to do people watching, play together at home with our dogs, toys, etc.

My struggle is mostly with household chores. My wife is amazing, she helps out on weekends when she can but she works 10 hour days. She always tells me I am too hard on myself and just because I don't get time to do dishes, laundry, etc. on top of taking care of our son.

I really want to make sure I'm doing everything I can for the home and the family, I pack my wife lunch everyday, I cook suppers everyday, I walk the dogs in the morning before my wife goes to work, but I really feel like a ""mooch"" for lack of a better term since leaving work.

Anyone else go though this? How do you manage the guilt? Any tricks for getting it all done?

Thank you for your help! This subreddit has been a great source of info.

I met this guy after a protest with a group of other people, and he was really kind and funny, also my type in looks. We talked but not much, like not enough for me to start a conversation with ""how are you?"" And stuff.

We ended up in the same group chat for a party (which he ended up not going to. I did tho.), and he was sooo fucking funny. After that I said alr I think I like him.
He then texted the group saying ""is anyone at this club tonight??"" And the others started answering ""omg I hate that club, it's for posers"", so with the ENORMOUS amount of rizz I have I answered "" Ignore the haters king "" LMFAO he simply liked my text, then he asked again and I told him ""I'm not in *city name* this week, but I'll gladly comet other times"" But it kind of died there.

AND THEN,WI wanted to go to this club with my sister, and decided to text him and ask him if he wanted to come 'cause I remembered he wanted to go, except I asked him exactly when he was going back to his hometown. But we said yeah let's do it next time.
The next time (last week) I texted him with a ""so *club name* tonight??"" And he answered with ""yeah, I'm with some of my friends."" Which I wasn't expecting because I thought he'd come with me and my sister, but no biggie. I said ""alright, I'll catch you later."" MATTER OF FACT, I did not catch him later. We managed to not see each other in the chaos of the club. 

My sister said he was a bit of an asshole by not texting me any thing after, like a ""you here?"" Or smt, but I didn't pay much mind to it.

So, I was thinking, I could be more direct. I wanted to text him this but idk if it's too cringe or creepy.

(He's a really kind of ""emotional"" person, really focused on real love, so I think he will appreciate me being honest and also me not trying to play it cool.)

The text: ""Hey, I wanted to be nonchalant, but I don't like the concept of it, so I'm writing to tell you I'm sorry I didn't see you at *club name*, because you seem like a very interesting, genuine, and nice guy, and I'd love to get to know you 😭😭 
This is to summarize the question: would you like to grab a coffee or a beer together sometime?""

1p6fuka,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/1p6fuka/a_quick_psa_to_those_whose_spousepartner_has/,A quick PSA to those whose spouse/partner has anxiety and tends to feel every exhausting little emotion on full blast-,"(Just venting but I’m actually going to step in front of a bus if I don’t get this off my chest.)

If someone tells you they’re worried about something, and you say anything along the lines of, “Well… don’t” that is entirely unhelpful and you are kind of a dick.￼

Never in history has saying “just calm down” actually calmed anyone down, and this is the same principle.

“I’m worried this thing is going to happen.”
“Well.. don’t.”

Oh my god, I’m cured! Thank you so much. That was really helpful. Why didn’t I think of just not worrying about it?? I didn’t realize I could flip a switch and just… NOT. Life changing.

I got sarcastic and now he’s defensive,
“I thought I was being helpful and you jumped down my throat.”
No. That was dismissive, not helpful. I tried telling you how I feel, and you told me to just not feel that way. In no way was that helpful.￼

And while we’re at it, let’s talk about how absolutely infuriating it is to constantly have my feelings and emotions brushed off as pregnancy hormones. By everyone, not just my husband.

“I’m really pissed about this situation.”
“It’s just your hormones.”

“This thing stressed me out.”
“Well the pregnancy isn’t helping.”

“I feel like I’m never going to be that person again.”
“It’s just because you’re not on all your meds.”

Friend, I am thinking daily about when/how best to off myself without harming my unborn child. This is not just me crying over the wrong coffee order or getting too emotional over a Hallmark movie. I am not going to snap out of it the minute this kid exits my body. This does not feel hormonal. I do not want to be here anymore. I want off this fucking ride. 
But when I try to say as much, “It’s just the hormones.”￼

To summarize our situation: 
-I am eight months pregnant with our second. He was planned and very much wanted. Our first is ecstatic to be a big brother.
-We had two dogs die about a month apart, one from a freak accident in training and one from old age. 
-Our six year old son started acting out at school and home. My mom thinks he’s upset because of the dogs. This kid could not have cared less about the dogs (seriously if I hadn’t told him one was going to be put down, he wouldn’t have noticed her absence for weeks.) 
-We introduced a new dog to the household. Son hated new dog for the first several weeks, but is warming up to him now. Dog is a total sweetheart, I’m just not really a dog person. But husband wanted him so here we are.
-Son’s performance and behavior at school was so horrendous that his teacher strongly recommended talking to his pediatrician about medication. (Worth mentioning son is also seeing a therapist. We’re doing what we can.)
-A few weeks into all of this, son and I were parked in front of the school along the curb and got rear-ended out of nowhere by someone going about 30mph. We weren’t wearing our seatbelts because we were about to get out of the car. Again reminder, eight months pregnant, so time in the hospital to be monitored. Blessedly, no injuries for us or the other vehicle’s occupants. Just stressed and sore.
-About two weeks ago, husband finally made an appointment to have swelling in his chest checked out. (He noticed the swelling in AUGUST and it is now November.) CT scan showed a tumor. Unsure of what it is until they do a biopsy, but doc said it’s most likely lymphoma or thymoma. We meet with a cardio thoracic surgeon this week for a consultation.
-Husband just got a promotion he’s been working his ass off for. Problem is it’ll require him moving to a different shift. His boss is dragging his feet on deciding where to put him, so in the meantime we can’t plan anything (birthdays, holidays, doctors appointments, etc) because we don’t know his new schedule yet. 

￼We have son’s birthday into husband’s birthday into Christmas into new baby’s arrival with very little respite in between. It’s an expensive season anyway, especially on one income, and I know my husband is now concerned about what other expenses may follow on account of his own health.

Hi everyone, I am new to disc golf and actively practicing.   
So far a major problem of my form is that, whenever the disc ejects out of my hand, the launch angle is going to be larger than it was when in the power pocket. So it is so hard to me to throw a 0 degree flat shot, it is always going up.  
It also causes a lot of wobble in my techdisc data, averaging about 5.6 in my historical data.  
I assume it is either my grip issue, or something to do with the wrist action, or some other issue?  
For information, I keep my wrist curved and downwards(pour the coffee) to get it nose down as much as possible. I put in pictures how my wrist is curved and gripped in the power pocket.  
  
I know I have bunch of other form issues. any other tips to improve will be much appreciated :)  
Thank you and have a nice day guys!

I told him that he is such a prick and if the roles were reversed, he would’ve bought his son a car without conditions. He said he would have asked his son the same thing if roles were reversed.

1p6fkoz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p6fkoz,"Octane Coffee (Automated Coffee Shop, Inc.) Passes $300K Raised From 90+ Investors on StartEngine — SAFE at $20.7M Cap","Octane Coffee (Automated Coffee Shop, Inc.) just crossed $300K raised from 90+ investors on StartEngine, and it’s becoming one of the more active automation-focused raises this month. 

Octane Coffee is pushing a fully automated drive-thru model, using robotic baristas to reduce labor constraints and speed up service. Their filings describe a strategy built around scaling multiple automated locations, improving throughput, and tapping into growing consumer demand for fast, reliable coffee service. International expansion and new market entry are mentioned as longer-term goals, which is part of what’s triggering conversation around future scalability.

At the same time, their financials show the reality of an early automation company: $77.15K in revenue and a -$1.12M net loss as of October 15, 2025. That dynamic — high investment, early revenue, heavy R&D and infrastructure costs — is typical of robotics-focused businesses in their buildout phase, and it’s something investors are actively discussing.

The raise itself is being offered through a SAFE at a $20.7M valuation cap, not a priced equity round. We’re highlighting that because many users on Owntric track how different SAFEs compare across caps, burn, traction, and category.

Octane is also showing up in local and national media coverage, including pieces on robotic baristas, new Milwaukee automated drive-thru openings, and emerging competitors in the same automation niche. A Ukrainian startup offering similar robotic coffee tech was even mentioned in their analysis, which adds to the competitive narrative forming around the category.

Owntric isn’t here to tell people to invest — only to surface companies that are gaining momentum and have enough publicly filed information for users to analyze. Octane Coffee is one of the more active raises right now, and its mix of automation, early financials, and a growing footprint explains why people are watching it.

Coffee was always a trigger, but only if I overdid it. For example, drinking coffee several times a week for a month would reliably bring on a migraine. But if I ever got a migraine that didn’t seem tied to coffee intake, then coffee or espresso would actually help, especially if taken during or shortly after an aura.

From 2020 to 2025, things changed. My migraines became more severe with blinding auras where I’d see a white spot in the center of my vision that would shift into peripheral blindness, followed by brutal multi-day headaches. I started getting dizziness, loss of balance, and nausea. They also became more frequent. I went from getting one every few months to getting one every month, and sometimes even two a month. I also began having weird visual disturbances like tiny flashes of blue or black in my peripheral or center vision that lasted a split second, almost like a screen glitch.

Six months ago I decided to quit caffeine completely. Since then I haven’t had a single migraine or aura. I still get very faint visual disturbances once in a long while, but nothing close to what I used to experience.

My theory is that coffee wasn’t my only trigger. I’ve had migraines since I was about ten, although very rarely. As a kid I drank caffeinated sodas like Coke and Dr Pepper, and I kept drinking soda as an adult. Starting in 2020 I also began drinking a lot more caffeinated teas like chai, green, and black tea, which I’m sure played a role.

Safe to say, I feel cured. I’m believing and praying that caffeine was truly my only trigger. Only time will tell, but I genuinely feel like I’ve gotten my life back. Migraines are more than a nuisance. They’re disabling.

This post is for anyone who wants to *actually* level up in their marriage. Not just act like a good husband but *become* one. Backed by real psychology, relationship research, and therapist insights. Pulled from sources like Esther Perel’s work, Dr. John Gottman’s research, and top relationship podcasts like “Where Should We Begin” and “The Love, Happiness & Success Podcast”. Sharing this because most guys never got taught any of this. And no, being great at gift-giving doesn't make you a great life partner.

Here’s what actually works:

* **Learn *how* to fight, not just avoid fights**
  * Psychologist John Gottman studied thousands of couples and found that **how you argue** predicts whether you stay married. Not *if* you argue.
  * Key tip: Avoid the “Four Horsemen” he describes, Criticism, Contempt, Defensiveness, and Stonewalling. These destroy emotional safety.
  * Instead:
    * Use *soft startups* , start a complaint gently, not harsh.
    * Take breaks in heated arguments. Research shows cortisol spikes can last 20+ minutes; during that time, logical conversation is impossible.
    * Validate their feelings even if you disagree entirely. Validation is not agreement. It’s: “I see this is hard for you.”

* **Start doing “emotional labor” ,  not just physical support**
  * Sociologist Dr. Arlie Hochschild coined the term in her book *The Second Shift* ,  women are often managing the relationship’s emotional needs invisibly.
  * This means:
    * Remembering birthdays *and* checking how she feels about them.
    * Being the one to initiate repair after conflicts.
    * Holding space for their day, even when you had a tough one too.
  * TLDR: Think ahead emotionally, not just logistically.

* **Don’t just hear them ,  *track* them**
  * Harvard psychologist Dr. Ellen Langer’s concept of *mindful attention* applies here. Don’t just listen when spoken to. Be *aware* over time.
  * Practical habits:
    * Store small facts: their favorite comfort food, what stressed them out last week, what show they’re into this month.
    * Follow up: “You mentioned your coworker annoyed you Monday. How did that turn out?”
    * Track moods over time ,  not every low mood needs a fix, but it does deserve compassion.

* **Master “bids for connection”**
  * Gottman’s big discovery in long-term successful couples: They respond to little “bids” , subtle efforts at connection , with engagement, not disinterest.
  * Examples:
    * They show you a meme. Don’t grunt. Look, respond, ask something.
    * They sigh dramatically. Ask what’s up, don’t ignore.
    * They brush past you while cooking. That’s a bid. Hug them.
  * Dr. Gottman found couples who flourish respond to **86%** of these bids. Struggling couples? Only 30%.

* **Make routines feel like rituals**
  * Relationship coach Nedra Tawwab says day-to-day connection is what makes couples feel loved. So turn mundane stuff into bonding time.
    * Cooking together? Light a candle, play music.
    * Weekly errands? Grab coffee first, turn it into a Sunday ritual.
    * Going to bed? Make it a screen-free 10-minute chat every night.
  * When routines get lit up by intention, they become intimacy fuel.

* **Invest in your own inner world**
  * From therapist Terrence Real’s book *Us*, one of the biggest underrated keys to a strong marriage is: *Do your own work*.
    * Go to therapy, even when nothing is on fire.
    * Learn your own triggers and defense mechanisms.
    * Build emotional vocabulary so you can say more than “I’m fine” or “I’m just tired.”
  * Dr. Alexandra Solomon calls it “relational self-awareness” , knowing how your past shows up in your present dynamic.

* **Treat affection like a *practice*, not a trait**
  * You’re not “just not a hugger” or “bad at expressing feelings.” That’s learned avoidance, not identity.
    * Research from Dr. Kory Floyd at the University of Arizona shows affection improves stress, immune function, relationship satisfaction. It’s literally medicine.
    * Try: 6-second hugs (Gottman’s favorite), random texts of appreciation, hand on their back while walking, “just because” compliments.
    * Don’t wait for the mood. Practice it. It builds itself.

* **Learn their actual love language, not just the quiz result**
  * The 5 Love Languages by Gary Chapman is useful, *but* many people misapply it. It’s not just knowing their top one.
    * Watch how they show love ,  that’s often how they want to *receive* it.
    * Ask: “What’s something I do that makes you feel really loved lately?”
    * Don’t dismiss languages that don’t come naturally to you. Learn them like new skills.

* **Be curious about the *version* they’re becoming**
  * Esther Perel, in her TED talk and podcast, says people change in long-term partnerships. You don’t marry one person , you marry multiple evolving versions.
  * Every few months, ask:
    * “What’s exciting you lately?”
    * “Is there anything new you want from me?”
    * “What do you wish we did more often?”
  * Relationships deepen when curiosity stays alive. Not just about their past, but their *becoming*.

* **Don’t aim to “make them happy” ,  co-create a meaningful life**
  * A study in *Psychological Science* (2019) shows couples with shared goals and values report higher long-term satisfaction than those with just shared hobbies or chemistry.
  * So talk about:
    * Shared dreams, even if small.
    * Family vision, lifestyle priorities, your “why”.
    * Aligning on values > material compatibility.

This is not about perfection. It’s about showing up in *small consistent ways*. Real love is maintenance. Not magic. The TikTok gestures are cute, but the daily emotional attunement is hotter. And yeah, all of this is learnable. You’re not “just not good at relationships”. No one is born knowing this stuff. But you can get really, really good.

Ingredients

Sponge cake

4 large eggs

1 cup (4½ oz.) powdered erythritol

3½ oz. melted butter

1 tsp baking powder

1¼ cups (5 oz.) almond flour

Mascarpone cream

2 cups heavy whipping cream

9 oz. (1 cup) mascarpone cheese

4 tbsp powdered erythritol

Assembly and serving

1 cup coffee

4 tbsp cocoa powder

Instructions

Sponge cake

Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Separate the egg whites from the yolks, and place them in two separate bowls.

Beat the egg whites until stiff with the help of an electric mixer. Reserve.

Add the sweetener to the egg yolks and beat until the mixture turns pale yellow. Add the melted butter and the baking powder and mix. Finally, add the almond flour and mix again until well incorporated.

Gently fold the egg whites into the mixture with a spatula, using gentle, sweeping movements.

Grease a 9"" × 13"" (23 × 33cm) baking pan. You can also cover the pan with parchment paper instead of greasing. Spoon in the dough. Bake for 10 to 15 minutes.

Let the cake cool down for 3 hours and remove it from the tray.

Mascarpone cream

Whip the cream until it forms soft peaks.

In another bowl, whip the mascarpone and add the sweetener.

Using a silicone spatula, mix the cream and the mascarpone with gentle, enveloping movements.

Assembly and serving

Pour the coffee into a deep bowl.

Cut the sponge cake into strips or sticks, dip them in the coffee and form the first layer at the bottom of an 11"" x 7"" (27 x 18 cm) rectangular cake pan.

Spread a layer of mascarpone cream on top.

Then, add another layer of coffee-dipped sponge cake strips and covered it with another layer of cream.

Decorate with the cocoa powder and let it rest in the fridge for at least 3 hours.

Special equipment needed

Electric mixer.

We’ve taken him in the car, to the vets and had guests over to the house. All have gone well. However I’m worried that it’s too much for him when I take him out in his bag (like a carry sling where I can hold him).

Today we tried going a bit further, walking along a busy road to a cafe to get a takeaway coffee. He trembled the entire time (he does this a lot as a chi) he began by taking treats but then eventually wouldn’t so we turned back. He wasn’t crying or hiding, still had his head popping out to look but had ‘whale eye’ and trembling. The whole trip was 15-20 mins. 

Am I pushing him too far? I feel awful now. I’m scared of making him fearful.  

Should I carry on with these sort of trips or scale back? I was thinking tomorrow I might just try 5 minutes on a quiet residential road. 

It’s just so hard to know what’s right especially when you feel ‘the socialisation window’ looming over you. I’m so scared I’m going to ‘ruin’ this puppy! ",1,1764084262.0,puppy101,6,1.0,False
1p6f7ot,https://www.reddit.com/r/Morocco/comments/1p6f7ot/learning_to_build_real_female_friendships_as_an/,Learning to build real female friendships as an adult any advice?,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been reflecting a lot on my social life lately especially now that I’m not studying or working. I’m 20F, and something I’m trying to understand about myself is why I’ve always struggled with forming friendships with other women

Growing up, I mostly made friends with guys because I thought female friendships felt shallow or “not for me” Looking back, I’m not sure if it was internalized misogyny, not relating to the girls around me, or just being young and confused about what real connection looks like

But as I got older, I realized something that hit hard that every male friend I had eventually wanted to date me and it made those friendships feel less real and less safe research even backs this pattern up that opposite-sex friendships often come with asymmetrical attraction that was literally my life. So I ended up kinda friendless

Now that I’m reconnecting with my actual self not the version I played to be liked I’ve started craving the kind of closeness and emotional safety that comes with healthy female friendships. That deep “girlhood” type of bond. And being outside school or work makes it extra isolating because I have no natural spaces to meet women my age

So I wanted to ask how did you build meaningful, real-life female friendships as an adult in Morocco?  
If you went through something similar realizing you actually need that feminine connection what helped you meet people, approach them, or build trust?

I’m not looking for drama or surface-level stuff. I just genuinely want to hang out with other women, talk, laugh, go for walks, grab coffee without the whole “guy flirting in the background” energy

Any stories, advice, or even simple steps would really help. Thanks for reading <3",1,1764084186.0,Morocco,4,0.67,False

Basically no symptoms so this for me is hard to accept. I went to the Gl doctor for severe reflux and after a phvsical exam, she felt some firmness when pressing down on my bowels. I felt some tenderness there that I never really noticed. Now I notice it all the time lol. Next was a CT studv that showed inflammation in my small intestine. Then I had a colonoscopy that also showed inflammation in my Ilium. That and a calprotectin test is what supported the Crohn's diagnosis. I never experienced diarrhea or constipation or any severe pain but I recently gave up my pretty strong coffee addiction to try to heal my esophaqus from severe reflux. In turn, I am no longer regular, or pooping on schedule like I used to when I started my day with coffee. So maybe 20 years of drinking coffee covered up any pooping issues. Not sure but anyway I am now dealing with some uncertainty how to proceed. I'm very intimidated to start entyvio. I'm nervous about the immune suppression and wonder if anybody has opted not to take the mainstream approach of prescriptions and infusions etc. Is there a more holistic approach such as complete diet changes and supplements to help heal the inflammation? My GI says that this is very early caught as it doesn't look like the inflammation has been there for too long. She said there is a good chance that I will not have scarring in that section of my small bowel. I just finished a 3-month course of budesonide and will be going for another CT in a week to see if the inflammation has reduced. The plan that we have discussed is starting entyvio after that.

One day  feeling a little lonely, I opened grindr without expecting anything. That’s when I matched with a guy named Gaurav. His profile wasn’t flashy just a simple picture and a line that said “Looking for real connection.”
We started chatting, and somehow the conversation flowed so easily. He suggested we meet near Sadar for coffee. When I saw him for the first time It felt strange, comforting, and a little scary all at once.

Gaurav took me around the city like I’d never seen it before hidden gullies filled with the smell of street food, quiet rooftops overlooking the Taj, tiny clubs playing old Bollywood mixes, and late-night rides through roads that looked golden under the streetlights. With him, Agra felt less like a city and more like a story I was slowly entering.

I realized I was falling for him. And I thought maybe he felt the same. He held my hand once when the road was crowded, and I swear it felt like the world paused for a second.

But then… I don’t know what changed.

One evening, he said he needed some space, that life was getting complicated. He didn’t explain. He didn’t even look upset just distant, like he was locking a door from the inside. His replies slowed down, then stopped altogether. No fight, no closure… just silence.

And the strange thing is, I’ve started moving on from him. Slowly, quietly, the way a wound closes without you noticing. But Agra… Agra still lingers in me. I miss the gullies he showed me, the late-night Sadar lanes, the chaos of Fatehabad Road, and the way the city looked at  7 PM when the sky turned orange. Sometimes I think I romanticized the whole place but maybe that’s okay. Because when I think of Agra now, it’s not about him only I remember first… it’s the city.

We have:

* coworking spaces with unlimited coffee
* offices with neon lighting and bean bags
* wellness rooms
* ping pong tables no one uses
* kombucha on tap (for some reason??)
* “collab zones” plastered everywhere

Yet *nobody* wants to go back to the office.

Why?

Because **tech bros and devs didn’t leave for poor office design… we left because the vibe died.**

You go to the office, sit at your desk, code in silence, talk to 3 people max, then leave.

Zero chemistry.  
Zero community.  
Zero random convos about Kubernetes for no reason.

People miss the human part of tech : the banter, the micro-communities, the chaos.

And that’s where **SOKI**, a Kenyan-built app, might actually be onto something.



# ⚡ SOKI = A Social Layer for Your Office Building (Finally)

SOKI basically creates a **geo-fenced social space** for your *specific* building.

Meaning:

* You only see people who are physically in the office
* No outsiders
* Just the people actually working around you

It turns your office building into a mini social universe for techies.

Here’s what this means:

✨ Connect with devs from other floors  
✨ Discover interests (AI, crypto, gaming, ML, React memes)  
✨ Cross-team collabs become natural  
✨ Find people to eat with at lunch  
✨ Break silos without awkward HR initiatives

Oh… and:

💬 **Private DMs** for networking or “Hey, I saw you in the thread 👀”  
🕶️ **Anonymous posting** because sometimes you wanna rant about Jira  
📍 **Location locked** so it's actually relevant

Suddenly the office goes from *quiet coworking mode* to *oh wow this place has humans*.



# 👨‍💻 Why Nairobi Techies Actually Like It

* No forced HR bonding
* You decide how social you want to be
* Meeting new devs becomes less awkward
* Real-time updates about the office
* Micro-communities form naturally
* It makes the office interesting again

It’s giving **GitHub + Discord + IRL building** vibes.



# 🏢 Why Employers & Startups Love It

SOKI helps companies:

* Increase office attendance
* Improve dev morale
* Build actual culture
* Boost collaboration
* Break department silos
* Get honest anonymous feedback
* Support onboarding for new hires

Basically, SOKI fixes what coffee machines and fancy lounges can’t:  
**the human layer of tech work.**

It is surrounded by hills and volcanoes, with clear water, islands, and a peaceful atmosphere. The lake is unique because its deep and surface waters do not mix, and gases like methane have built up over time.

Lake Kivu is full of life, including sambaza fish and Spot-Necked Otters. Its islands, like Napoleon, Amahoro, and Monkey Island, are great for hiking, swimming, and watching birds. Local communities add culture with coffee farms, traditional night fishing, and the story of Nyiransibura, which tells how the lake began. Visitors can explore by boat, kayak, hike, or relax on the beaches.

Lake Kivu is a special place where nature, culture, and adventure meet. Its islands, wildlife, and calm waters make it perfect for exploring or relaxing. Every visitor can enjoy its beauty, learn its stories, and experience one of Rwanda’s most amazing natural treasures.

1p6f0q1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/1p6f0q1/my_mom_shouldnt_live_alone_anymore_but_not_sure/,My mom shouldn't live alone anymore but not sure the right placement,"I'm going to start by saying she can not live with me for a bunch of reasons. I have school age kids that are my priority, I do not have an extra bedroom, I'm a single mom who has a house to take care of and I work full time. I also do not like her enough to put myself through the misery of living with her full time. I love her. I will make sure she's safe, but to put it mildly, I do not enjoy her company. I never have and it's gotten worse since the dementia started.

So her current issues are short term memory and confusion. She is having a hard time operating things like the Keurig coffee maker, the computer, the tv. She gets delusional from time to time too. She'll call me and be like ""where did everyone go?"" Or ""why am I here by myself? When is someone coming to pick me up. I don't know how I got here"" 

She has lived in her 55+ condo development for 25 years. My dad died 15 years ago so she's been there solo since then. But she keeps forgetting that. She definitely needs help. Should I start with just part-time, in-home care? Like 4 hours a day in the sundowning hours? Or should I try to get her to assisted-living, or memory care? 

She takes very good care of herself and her condo still. She's always clean, put together well and her house is cleaner then mine. But she forgets where she lives! So she doesn't need assisted living help really but not full time memory care either. I've seen people in memory care, they often seem completely out of it.  75% of the time, my mom seems like a normal aging person withs some forgetfulness. But when she calls me 3 times at night not realizing where she is or who she lives with, I know I have to do something. 

What should the first step be for assistance? She has a fully paid off house and plenty of retirement money still. So money isn't an issue for now anyway. ",3,1764083742.0,dementia,6,1.0,False

21M here who has never been on a date, or in a relationship. But few weeks ago, I started chatting with one girl. And she is absolutely amazing. We have quite a lot in common, we talk about many different things, joke around, our energy matches really well.

We live in a different towns, she lives hour away from me, but I go there quite often, so that isn't a problem. She has been suggesting some places like cafes, and cool things I need to see and visit. We already talked about it indirectly and decided that we should meet when I come there.

I didn't have time to go there, but I am free now, and will go there soon. So I need advices and ideas for this date.

I've been thinking to meet with her in the centre, and take her to one of the places she suggested, go for a simple coffee date, just to talk with her, and see if we click irl like we do on texts. Btw we talked about some books, and she was asking me about one book that I've read, and I told her if she is interested I can gift if to her, and she also told me that she will give me her favorite book, so we even have gifts for eachother lol.

There is one cool museum that was opened there not long ago, and I've thought that I should maybe take her there, but idk. Maybe just a simple coffee date is cool for the first time.

1p6exon,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1p6exon/my_boyfriend_returned_home_earlier_than_he_was/,My boyfriend returned home earlier than he was supposed to. His clone wanted revenge.,"Ramirez was chaos wrapped in charm. Loud, reckless, impossible to ignore, but somehow I loved every second of it. He had a way of making ordinary life feel like a battle, and dangerous life feel like a game. Even in the worst situations, he laughed. Even when he bragged about surviving near-death fights, I found it endearing.

We had been together for years. I first met him when he returned to his hometown for a break after a war. He got to return to the battlefield once again a few months ago. Every separation, every long-distance call, every anxious night waiting for him to return felt like its own war. And now, after months apart, he was coming home. I didn’t expect anything, but what I got was… something else.

I was sitting on my couch, calculating how much I had earned that day when my phone buzzed. Ramirez. My heart leapt.

“Teressa! You’re not going to believe today,” his voice rang sharp with energy.

I sank onto the couch. “Try me.”

“Oh man… chaos.” He laughed, the sound carrying through the line like it belonged to another world. “The battlefield was brutal. There must have been billions of casualties. Our sergeant, Foster, got pushed into a pile of mud by the pushing force of a bomb. Briggs dropped his gun mid-fight, and somehow tripped over it like an idiot. Cole tried to throw a grenade… forgot the pin, so he basically gave his enemies a weapon. And Chen? He screamed at the explosions like he was five.”

I laughed until my stomach ached. “You’re insane. How are you still alive?”

“Pure skill… and luck,” he said. Behind him, I could hear the chaos: shouting, crashes, Cole yelling, Chen wailing, Briggs cursing, Foster shrieking. The squad then threw chairs, spoons, everything at Ramirez. He laughed while dodging thrown projectiles.

“Good news though. Command said we might get a week off — home visits. Maybe in seven days.” Foster told his squad, off-screen.

I gasped. “Seven days? Really?”  
  
In the background, I heard the squad reacting, chaos mixing with relief. Cole whooped. Briggs shouted about food. Chen laughed shakily.   
   
Ramirez grinned. “Yeah… I’m coming home.”

I hugged the phone. “I can’t wait.”

I didn’t know it yet, but this call was the calm before a storm.



I was having breakfast when suddenly... The knock came early. I opened the door to see Ramirez, messy hair, uniform, lazy grin. My chest surged.

“Surprise,” he said.

“What… how? You weren’t supposed to come for another week!”

“I told command I needed to see my girl. They agreed.”

I threw myself into his arms. Warmth, scent, laugh. Everything seemed normal.

The day was mundane — takeout, movies, conversation — everything normal. No hesitation. No subtle wrongness. No micro-twitches. Perfect. 



The next morning arrived. The sun stretched its pale fingers across the blinds, spilling light in thin stripes across the kitchen floor. My bare feet pressed into the cold wood as I stepped in, coffee mug in hand, and there he was, Ramirez. Hair messy, shirt rumpled from sleep, smiling lazily as he stirred his own cup.

“Morning,” I said, trying to keep my voice light.

“Morning,” he replied, grinning, but there was a subtle… precision to the way he moved. Too smooth, almost like he was consciously performing normality. His hand held the spoon just a fraction too still as he stirred, watching the swirls carefully.

I took my coffee. It smelled perfect, rich, warm and enticing. I sipped, and almost immediately noticed it was too perfect, not the messy, slightly burnt disaster he usually made that somehow always tasted like him.

“Smells amazing,” I said.

“Yeah, thought I’d do it right this time,” he said, shrugging, and I felt a small, unplaceable prickle of unease. Maybe he was just tired.

We ate breakfast together. The eggs were almost too neatly cooked, yolks perfectly round, toast evenly browned. He reached for the plate with his right hand, hesitated, and then switched to his left. “Guess I’m a bit ambidextrous today,” he said with a grin, and I laughed, but my pulse ticked a little faster than usual.

Everything was normal enough. Almost too normal. I told myself: He’s home, he’s safe. That’s all that matters.



By the afternoon, though, the subtle cracks started appearing. Ramirez moved through the kitchen again, cooking. I watched him cut vegetables with near-perfect precision. Bacon sizzled, eggs flipped without a single drop escaping the pan. Even the sound of the knife hitting the cutting board was measured, rhythmic, and far too precise. My stomach knotted. Ramirez had always been disastrous in the kitchen. Always.

Then I saw it: a thin line along his forearm, almost hidden beneath his sleeve. I leaned closer. Blue liquid, blood-like, thick, shimmering faintly in the sunlight.

“Ramirez…” My voice trembled.

He looked down. Calm, unnervingly calm. “Paint. Don’t worry about it.”

My stomach sank. My mind raced. That wan’t paint. That looked an awful lot like blood. Blue blood.

Then we got down to have dinner. I watched him carefully. My eyes immediately caught that he was holding his mug of coffee with his right hand. He was painfully left-handed. He couldn't even unscrew a jar with his right hand. He noticed my stare, smiled tightly, and switched hands. “I’m… ambidextrous,” he said quickly, a laugh too forced to sound genuine.

Every movement, every blink, every subtle twitch felt… wrong. Too deliberate, too smooth, rehearsed. Yet in his words, in his smiles, in the way he laughed — he looked exactly like Ramirez. And that was what made it worse.

The next day progressed almost normally, though. We moved from breakfast to lounging in the living room, the sun casting soft light across his figure. And still, my unease grew. I could see it now — just barely — in the faint shimmer of his skin in the light, the imperceptible stiffness in his fingers, the unnatural smoothness of his movements.

By the end of the day, my heart pounded every time he moved. Every step, every gesture, every word held a tension I couldn’t explain. It wasn’t outright terrifying yet, but the seed of dread had been planted. I could feel it creeping, coiling, waiting.

Then. Evening. Couch. Music soft.

“Remember our first date?” he asked.

“You wore that blue dress with white stripes,” he said.

I froze. I never had that dress. I was about to correct him when I thought to myself: ""He is probably suffering from trauma from the war. Just a tiny bit of memory loss"". I calmed down, a bit.

Later, Ramirez cracked a joke. Wrong timing. Wrong tone. Flat. Hollow.

Hands too stiff. Fingers curling unnaturally. Posture rigid. Head tilt slightly off. Anxiety tightening in my chest. I had a feeling he wasn't my beloved Ramirez. A strong feeling.



That night, I was sleeping when I got woken up to some noises. I came into the hallway. The hallway was dark, the faint light from the blinds barely cutting through the gloom. My bare feet pressed against the cold wood, heart hammering. Then I heard it — a wet, subtle noise, like skin stretching. My pulse leapt.

I edged forward and froze. There he was — Ramirez… or what looked like him. But wrong. So wrong. His body twisted unnaturally, muscles rippling under black-blue skin that shimmered like oil. Limbs bent at impossible angles. Multiple small, dark eyes flickered independently.

The mouth opened wide, teeth jagged, a wet rasping hiss escaping. “Teressa…” Like it was practicing to mimic Ramirez. Every movement was fluid, calculated, alien. The blue blood glistened along a forearm wound. My stomach churned.

I wanted to scream but could not. My legs refused to move, my hands shook uncontrollably as I pressed them to my mouth. The creature’s head tilted slightly, mimicking the way Ramirez used to glance when he smiled — but this was a mockery, twisted, hollow.

Then it moved its hands toward something in the bathroom — I couldn’t see clearly, my gaze glued to the impossible limbs, the twitching torso, the way it *stretched* and *morphed* fluidly. A wet, tearing noise rose, louder this time. My stomach turned violently, bile rising.

The smell hit me then. Coppery, metallic, sharp, acrid. Blood, but not human blood. Thick, black-blue, almost luminescent, sticky. My throat tightened, panic coiling around my heart. My breaths came fast, shallow, uneven.

And the worst of it: the way it moved. Every twitch, every step, every subtle bend of the spine *was calculated*, like a predator testing its own body for efficiency. My mind screamed: this isn’t Ramirez. Ramirez would never. Could never. *Do this.*

I stumbled back, hands fumbling against the wall, trying to escape the sight, but my eyes remained locked. The creature turned its head toward me, eyes shimmering black, mouth stretching into a horrifying approximation of a smile — and I realized it *knew I was watching. I*t hissed again — wet, rasping, familiar yet alien. “You shouldn’t have seen this…”

I barreled through the house, knocking over chairs and tables, slipping on the slick floor, lungs burning. At the stairs, I glimpsed it moving like liquid metal, faster than I could comprehend. Then, it suddenly boosted its speed. I got cornered not long after that.  
  
The creature stopped a few feet away, tilting its head. Its voice — wet, rasping — filled the space. “Years ago, your boyfriend took half of my heart. That weakened me… but I learned. I learned to shapeshift. And now… you will pay.”  
  
Then, faintly, voices. Male voices, familiar. Ramirez. My mind lit up — hope flaring like a fire.  
  
""So this is your house?"" a voice asked.

“Yep, I’m going to show the whole squad my sweet sweet girlfriend,” Ramirez said.

The creature froze — a fraction too slow. I lunged into the doorway. The squad was there, Foster, Ramirez, Cole, Briggs, Chen, Holt, shocked to see a mutated figure. 

“What… the *hell*,” Foster whispered.

The creature lunged.

Ramirez didn’t hesitate. He swung the iron bar he’d grabbed from outside earlier — a stupid thing he’d used for pull-ups — and it connected with a sickening, metallic crack. The force’s arm jerked back, but the bar bent inward like soft aluminum.

It screamed — a vibrating, layered howl that made my teeth buzz.

“TERESSA, MOVE!” Ramirez shouted.

I dove behind the hallway cabinet as the beast twisted backward, spine snapping into a new shape as it regained balance. Briggs charged with his hatchet, screaming, but the creature whirled, a blur of black-blue muscle, and Briggs barely dodged the claw swipe that would’ve opened his ribs.

“Blue blood!” Ramirez gasped. “IT’S THE FORCE — GUNS DON’T WORK ON IT!”

“MAGAZINES DOWN!” Foster barked. “CLOSE COMBAT!”

The creature rushed again, impossibly fast. Ramirez planted himself in the center of the squad, blocking with the half-broken bar as the thing’s claws slashed downward. Metal screeched. Sparks burst. The bar almost split in two.

“COME ON THEN, YOU UGLY—” Ramirez grunted, shoving back.

Chen vaulted the kitchen counter and stabbed downward with a long survival knife. The blade sank in — barely an inch. Blue blood hissed out, smoking on the tile.

The creature didn’t even flinch.

It flung Chen backwards with a single arm sweep. He slammed into the fridge with a grunt.

Cole rushed in next — terrified but furious — swinging a crowbar like his life depended on it. The force caught the crowbar mid-swing, bent it like a pipe cleaner, and hurled Cole across the living room.

“Ramirez, LEFT!” Foster roared.

The creature’s arm flashed up, ready to slice his throat.

Ramirez ducked at the last possible second, grabbed its wrist, and — with a snarl — *pivoted* his whole weight. I saw the veins bulge in his neck as he twisted, dragging the thing off balance. He shouted, putting everything into one desperate move, and **threw the monster through the living room window**.

Glass exploded everywhere. The creature hit the ground outside in a spray of blue.

But it got up.

Of course it got up.

It launched itself back inside, shards of glass clinging to its body. Foster shoved a table into its path — the force tore it apart like cardboard. Eli and Briggs came at it from both sides, striking its legs, trying to topple it. Chen staggered back into the fight, knife ready.

I watched, trembling, as the squad formed a tight semicircle around Ramirez.

The creature hissed — a long, wet, seething sound.

Then it charged.

Weapons clashed. Wood splintered. Blades scraped bone. The air filled with blue mist and grunts of effort, the room shaking with every impact. Briggs managed to bury an axe into its shoulder; Chen drove his knife repeatedly into its ribs; Foster used a broken chair leg as a spear, ramming the creature against the wall.

The beast thrashed, limbs bending at impossible angles. It grabbed Ramirez by the vest and slammed him into the wall — hard enough to crack the drywall. He slid down, dazed.

“RAMIREZ!” I screamed.

The creature reared back, ready to finish him.

Briggs and Foster tackled it at once, dragging it sideways. Holt leapt on its back, stabbing wildly into its neck. Blue blood sprayed across the ceiling. The force twisted violently, flinging Holt off, but the damage had slowed it. Its movements faltered — just slightly.

Just enough.

Ramirez surged up with one last roar, grabbed the creature by the back of the head, and *slammed* it face-first onto the glass-strewn floor. Chen’s knife plunged down. Briggs followed with another strike. The creature convulsed, shrieking, limbs spasming in all directions.

Then it stopped.

The room went eerily silent except for the squad’s ragged breathing. Blue blood slowly pooled across the broken floorboards.

Ramirez stumbled toward me, chest heaving, face streaked with sweat and dust. He dropped the broken iron bar, grabbed my shaking shoulders, and pulled me close.

“It’s dead,” he whispered, voice trembling for the first time since I’d met him. “This time… it’s really dead.”

Then Ramirez looked at the mess, whistled softly, and nudged a puddle of blue blood with the toe of his boot.

“Welp…” he said, completely deadpan, “at least Dr. Davis is gonna be thrilled. Man’s been begging for more samples for months.”  
He gestured vaguely at the splattered walls. “Pretty sure this counts as… I dunno… *same-day bulk shipping.*”

Foster barked a laugh he immediately tried to smother. “Bro, you basically delivered him a whole warehouse.”

Ramirez shrugged, smirking like he hadn’t nearly been disemboweled ten minutes ago. “What can I say? I care about my coworkers.”

I stared at him, exhausted, trembling, but somehow still able to roll my eyes. “Only you would survive a monster impersonating you and still worry about a scientist’s wishlist.”

He winked. “Babe, I’m a multitasker.”

I let out a shaky breath—half a sob, half a laugh—and finally stepped forward, pressing my forehead to his chest. His arms wrapped around me instantly, tight and warm and real.

The others gave us a little space, stepping back among the shards and the blood.

The house was a disaster. I was a disaster.

But Ramirez was here. The real him.

And that alone made the ruins feel survivable.

But I knew, deep down, that the safety wouldn’t stay with me long.

Even laughter couldn’t chase all the fear away.",2,1764083550.0,nosleep,0,0.75,False
1p6exbd,https://www.reddit.com/r/MoroccoBitchesWtaste/comments/1p6exbd/learning_to_build_real_female_friendships_as_an/,Learning to build real female friendships as an adult any advice?,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been reflecting a lot on my social life lately especially now that I’m not studying or working. I’m 20F, and something I’m trying to understand about myself is why I’ve always struggled with forming friendships with other women

Growing up, I mostly made friends with guys because I thought female friendships felt shallow or “not for me” Looking back, I’m not sure if it was internalized misogyny, not relating to the girls around me, or just being young and confused about what real connection looks like

But as I got older, I realized something that hit hard that every male friend I had eventually wanted to date me and it made those friendships feel less real and less safe research even backs this pattern up that opposite-sex friendships often come with asymmetrical attraction that was literally my life. So I ended up kinda friendless

Now that I’m reconnecting with my actual self  not the version I played to be liked  I’ve started craving the kind of closeness and emotional safety that comes with healthy female friendships. That deep “girlhood” type of bond. And being outside school or work makes it extra isolating because I have no natural spaces to meet women my age

So I wanted to ask how did you build meaningful, real-life female friendships as an adult in Morocco?  
If you went through something similar realizing you actually need that feminine connection what helped you meet people, approach them, or build trust?

I’m not looking for drama or surface-level stuff. I just genuinely want to hang out with other women, talk, laugh, go for walks, grab coffee without the whole “guy flirting in the background” energy

Any stories, advice, or even simple steps would really help. Thanks for reading <3",1,1764083527.0,MoroccoBitchesWtaste,1,1.0,False

1p6ewc5,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_ishaansharmaofficial/comments/1p6ewc5/digital_magazine_publishing_software_the/,Digital Magazine Publishing Software: The Importance of Mobile-Friendly Magazines,"Over the last ten years, the consumer behavior of content has been transformed. The days when people would wait till a polished magazine was mailed to their homes are gone. In this case, they demand access to their preferred publications at the touch of their smartphones and tablets. This change of behavior among the readers implies that publishers have to change or go the way of the wind. It is no longer possible to come up with a digital magazine that is friendly on a mobile phone, but it is a requirement. Readers need smooth and interactive time and when your publication fails to provide this, they will move on readily. The key to achieving these expectations and making sure that your content looks great on any screen is investing in the right digital magazine publishing software.

**The reasons why your online magazine should be mobile-friendly**

It is estimated that more than 7 billion smartphone users will exist throughout the world as early as 2027. This statistic demonstrates a huge number of people who mostly use mobile platforms to consume the content. This is not just a trend, but the new standard of the digital publishers. Mobile optimization is also not an option, as it is a push in the right direction and you leave much of your potential readership behind.

**Addressing User Expectations**

Convenience and accessibility are what is required of the reader today. They desire to read articles in their commuter, they want to read news in their coffee break and stay in their couch and read. This is achieved by having a mobile friendly magazine. The more your publication is user friendly in a small screen, the more chances are that your readers get to dedicate more time to your content, refer to other people and be loyal to your subscription.

The bad mobile experience, on the other hand, can be infuriating. The pain has been pinching and zooming to read text, being able to use small buttons, waiting on pages to slow down and loading slowly is a traditional pain point that can lose readership. User- friendly design is one of the distinguishing factors that can be used to distinguish your magazine in an competitive digital environment.

**Increasing SEO and Discoverability**

Google and other search engines give precedence to web pages which are mobile friendly. The idea is called mobile-first indexing and implies that the mobile form of your content is the one that is primarily ranked. Unless your online magazine is mobile optimized, it will not rank well in search engines, and new readers might never get to know about your magazine.

By having a responsive design that is able to adjust to the various screen sizes, all the users of the site are guaranteed the same experience, and that is a good indicator to search engines. Investing in mobile-friendly publishing software will allow you to optimize the performance of your magazine in relation to the SEO, increase the number of organic traffic, and increase the reach of your audience.

**Selecting the Right Digital Magazine Publishing Software**

You need to select a piece of software that forms the basis of your mobile strategy. Publishing platforms are not equivalent and it is important to choose one which will provide features that you require to establish a high quality mobile experience.

**Mobile Optimization Characteristics**

The most vital elements to be in the digital magazine publishing software are:

·        Responsive Design: This is the most significant one. Responsive design will automatically modify the layout and content of your magazine to fit into any type of screen, whether it is a small smartphone or a big screen desktop monitor. This makes sure that your publication is always presentable and easy to read irrespective of the device.

·        Interactive Features: Mobile devices also have distinct possibilities of interactivity. Find software that will enable you to add video and audio clips, animated GIF, and links that people can click. All these may enhance your content and render it more interactive and absorbing to your readers.

·        Offline Access: The desire of many readers is the possibility of downloading the issues and reading them anytime without an internet connection. Offline access software is further convenient and could assist in increasing the reader loyalty.

·        Quick loading speeds: Mobile users are impatient. Your magazine should not take longer than thirty seconds to load, or they will drop it. Select a platform that is performance optimized so that your content can be loaded quickly even over slower mobile connections.

·        Analytics and Reporting: You need to know how your magazine is being read by readers in order to make it better. Find software that displays comprehensive page view, reading time and click through analytics. This information will aid you in determining what is popular and how to best publish.

**Mobile-First Design Best Practices**

You are ready with the appropriate software, now, time to design. A mobile first strategy implies that the design is based on the smallest size of the screen and then goes up to the larger screens. This will provide the assurance that the core experience is firm on mobile and then introduces additions to the tablet and desktops.

**Simplify Your Layout**

Simplicity is an important aspect in a small-screen display. Single column layout- It helps to make the material easy to scroll. Do not use a cluttered design that contains too many elements. Rather emphasize on clean typography, wide open spaces and visual hierarchy. This will simplify and make your magazine more readable among the mobile users.

**Optimize Your Images**

Clearly, high-resolution images can be considered a requirement of the professional-looking magazine, however, it also can slow down the loading time. Compress images using compression tools that do not lower the quality of the file. In addition to this, there should be responsive images which are automatically adjusted with the size of the screen of the user.

**Design Thumb Friendly Navigation**

Consider the ways in which individuals use and carry their phones. The navigation elements including the buttons and links must be huge enough to be tapped easily using a thumb. Locate significant interactive features in easy reach so as to enhance usability. A hamburger menu is the standard and successfully used method of arranging navigation in the mobile devices without consuming the large proportions of the devices.

**Conclusion**

This shift to mobile-first world poses an obstacle and opportunities to the magazine publishers. With adaptable design and using the appropriate **digital magazine publishing software** such as **PageTurnPro digital magazine publishing software**, you are able to build an interactive and thought-provoking reading experience that will attract the attention of a contemporary reader.

It is important that you place your readers first. Know their requirements, predict their actions and provide a smooth experience that makes your content look beautiful on any screen. In this way, you will not only maintain your current readership but also appeal to a new generation of digital natives that are willing to read good content.",1,1764083463.0,u_ishaansharmaofficial,0,1.0,False

*23:00:30 - 10/23/2018*

I should have gone home after charting. Should have clocked out, driven away, let the building sink back into whatever silence it keeps after my shift ends.

But the image of Mrs. Hancock on the floor, her eyes fixed on something behind me, her voice cracking...

I told myself I was doing a follow-up safety check. Documentation. Sure, I’m doing it after the end of shift, but it is still routine and necessary.

The hallway outside her room was quiet for seven in the morning. It was the kind of quiet that makes you notice things you shouldn’t, like the faint rattle of old machinery, the muffled beep of vitals monitors, the soft click of settling tile.

Residents slept behind half-closed doors. No TVs playing. No murmured conversations. No aides gossiping by the medication cart.

The whole floor felt… paused.

When I stepped into her room, Mrs. Hancock was awake.

Straight-backed in bed, hands knotted tight around her call-light cord like she was clinging to a lifeline.

“You came back,” she said softly, her voice carrying that trembling relief you hear from people who know the dark is real.

“I just wanted to make sure you’re okay,” I whispered, checking her respiratory effort automatically. Slightly increased.

“He knows you see him now.”

The same sick and sour feeling enveloped my stomach.

“Who, Mrs. Hancock?” I tried to sound friendly, cheerful even, but I heard my voice crack and betray me.

“The man in the black hat.”

I swallowed. Forced the calm, clinical tone they teach you. “I want to understand what you’re experiencing. Was last night the first time you saw this man in the black hat?”

She smiled and looked past me. As if attached to marionette strings, her hand lifted, trembling, and pointed to the far corner.

My pulse kicked up, but I didn’t turn. Not yet. Assess the patient first; confirm reality later.

“You said he comes when you’re about to—”

“Slip,” she said. “Yes. When the veil thins. When my pulse slows at night, before I enter the dreaming state.”

Her eyes drifted. “He stands there, measuring the space between each heartbeat.”

Out of habit, I reached up and turned on the EKG machine, the one with all the frustrating wires that connects to your chest and provides a cardiac rhythm interpretation. It stays locked, next to the vital sign monitor, in the rooms on this floor- it was an expensive update but administration decided to do it in case we ever needed to convert this floor into an isolation unit.

I connected it to Mrs. Hancock. I checked the readout. Normal sinus rhythm, heart rate of 71 beats per minute. Her pulses were strong. Nothing unusual.

I stared at the printout longer than I meant to, when Mrs. Hancock zeroed her gaze on me.

“You don’t have to look,” she breathed. “I didn’t the first time. But he’s patient. He will wait.”

The air behind me felt wrong again. Too dense. Too thick. Like the moment before an electrical storm blows out the sky.

I turned.

Broad shoulders. A long outline. A wide brim.

Too sharply defined to be thrown by the bedside lamp. Like someone was standing between the light and the wall, except the space was empty. No body. No mass. Just a silhouette shaped like absence.

It seemed to be… Watching.

I blinked hard. Once. Twice. Enough to make tears form.

The shape didn’t distort.

Didn’t break.

It didn’t waver the way a hallucination would when you challenge it.

Mrs. Hancock’s breath shuddered out. “He likes you. He doesn’t let most people see him.”

“I… don’t see anything,” I said, though the quiver in my voice confessed the lie for me. “It’s probably just your nightlight casting—”

“It’s not the light, dear.”

Something rippled along the silhouette’s edge. A subtle shift. A lean? Like it was acknowledging my attention with interest.

“I’m not delirious,” she whispered, one of those rehearsed smiles crawling across her face. “And you see him.”

Just then, a sound came from the hallway — a tech rolling a linen cart — and the silhouette collapsed inward like smoke being pulled through a tiny, hidden crack.

Mrs. Hancock sagged back against her pillow, exhausted. “He’s never shown himself for this long before,” she murmured. “Not to someone else.”

I cleared my throat. “I’m not going to be working tonight, but the nurses here know how to reach me if you need me for any reason, okay? I mean it, Mrs. Hancock, I am here for you and you are safe.”

She nodded, “It’s less frightening when someone else sees him too.”

I tried to smile, but the muscles in my face refused.

For the first time in my career, I don’t know what scares me more: That she was seeing something that wasn’t there, or that we were seeing the same thing.



*19:21:55 - 10/24/2018*

I didn’t sleep the night after seeing that shadow in Mrs. Hancock’s room.

And it wasn’t because of fear.

Or… fine, yes, it *was* fear, but twisted together with something else: that crawling itch I’d missed a clinical detail, I didn’t pay attention to the *right* cues. There had to be a neurological, measurable, chartable reason for what I saw. Something I could pin to a whiteboard and label until it stopped feeling like a threat.

So after tossing and turning for hours, I decided to get up. It was around 3:30 in the morning. I grabbed my laptop (the repair shop said it was fine?), curled under a blanket on my couch, and started searching, trying to find anything I could to explain what Mrs. Hancock saw… what I saw…

>

All very reasonable. All tidy little boxes with symptoms and causes and decision trees. Comforting in their sterile little ways.

I mean, there had to be a neurological explanation. There *had* to be.

I took a break, put on the 1982 version of *The Thing*, grabbed a snack (nightshift nursing screws with every circadian thing about you). I was starting to relax, to drift off, to feel like I could shake the strangeness from the last few days.

Then the thing with the corner of my living room happened.

It started small, a heaviness settling just outside my vision. Like the air thickened, gravity flexed. I kept staring at my screen, refusing to acknowledge the feeling that something was forming in the dark beyond me.

You know how usually when you look at a shadow or something that doesn’t quite make sense, your brain corrects it, smooths it back into nothing? It becomes an analogy machine, normalizing what’s in front of you.

That didn’t happen.

Instead, the shadow tightened into shape.

I froze, hand hovering over the remote. My breath stalled halfway up my throat. I stared straight ahead because looking at it directly felt like stepping into a trap.

I closed my eyes, shook my head, and mentally reset. *This isn’t real, I’m just really fucking tired*… When I finally turned my gaze back to the corner, it was empty.

But an afterimage burned behind my eyes, the way light burns when you look too close at a bulb.

“I’m awake,” I said out loud, like an idiot. “Hallucinations don’t follow the awake brain.” I laughed at myself, almost believed myself.

Until the tremors started.



*21:40:40 - 10/25/2018*

Damn. I needed to take a break, I started to freak myself out — decided to throw on an episode of *Creeping&Casting*, a podcast that always makes me laugh. Sure, the subject matter of paranormal phenomenon or local cryptids could be spooky, but the hosts always add some laughs. I ended up passing out, and next thing I knew, it was time to be back at ol’ Insane-shits. I just finished my rounds.

Anyway, back to the tremors.

They began as a tiny shake in my fingers, the kind people get when they’re on the verge of a panic attack. The weird thing is, the shaking got worse with intentional movement. Worse when I tried to *stop* it. That isn’t how anxiety tremors act.

I went into “nurse brain” mode: I checked my blood sugar (normal). My meds (unchanged). My caffeine intake (moderate for a nightshift nurse, meaning “concerning” for anyone else).

Nothing explained it.

Tonight, while I was rechecking Mrs. Hancock’s vitals, she looked at my hands and frowned.

“You’re seeing him too often now,” she murmured.

My stomach dropped. “What does that mean?”

Her gaze drifted to my trembling fingers. “That shaking. It starts when he gets close, doesn’t it?”

I swallowed. “I’m just tired, Mrs. Hancock. It’s been a long week for me.”

“No no,” she whispered. “I know tired. I see it in auras. I promise you’re not as tired as you believe. In all truths,” she smiled that practiced, plastic gummy smile, “you’re thinning.”



*01:17:27 - 10/27/2018*

Mrs. Hancock had another episode. Same pattern as before — her eyes tracking something that wasn’t visible to me, her breath snagging in her chest, her voice thin and shaking like she was trying to talk through cold water.

Her vitals were fine. *Fine.*

Every number insisted she was stable. Every number insisted nothing was wrong.

I refuse to believe the numbers.

Because she kept saying he wasn’t watching *her* tonight… He was watching *me.*

Now, I know what stress and sleep deprivation can do to perception. I’ve watched people swear their dead childhood best friends were sitting at the foot of their beds after three days without real sleep.

I keep trying to chalk all of this up to suggestibility — the way the mind absorbs fear when it’s already primed for it. I’ve been doing too many doubles, living on vending-machine food and adrenaline. My circadian rhythm is so mangled it’s basically jazz. I’ve slept maybe nine hours in three days, and half of that wasn’t even sleep — more like a shallow, dreamless float that didn’t touch the part of my brain that actually needs rest.

Exhausted brains do strange, vivid things. I regularly see that with my patients.

But the tremors are worse… my hands won’t stop shaking, feeling like something is humming under my skin, vibrating in bone instead of muscle.

If it keeps up, I’ll go to urgent care.  
I’ll ask for a neuro exam — rule out B₁₂ deficiency, early MS, essential tremor, migraine aura, anything. Anything with a lab value or a diagnostic code. Anything that isn’t… whatever this is turning into.

I’m exhausted and need to finish all of my charting. I’ll write again tomorrow.



*03:33:30 - 10/27/2018*

*remember the order of things*



*21:30:00 - 10/27/2018*

Okay.  
So… something’s off.

I logged in and saw a random entry — “remember the order of things.” I didn’t write it. I know I didn’t. The formatting isn’t mine, the tone isn’t mine, and the whole thing reads like someone trying to leave instructions… or a warning.

I’m telling myself the document must’ve autosaved some garbage draft when the computer did its nightly update. Or maybe I opened the page half-coherent and typed something weird without realizing.

But still.

It doesn’t sound like me. Hell, there’s not even punctuation.

I’ll delete it later. I currently lack the desire.

Mrs. Hancock was calmer tonight. When I checked her pulse, she grabbed my wrist, gently, almost reassuring, and said, “You look thinner.”

I asked what she meant.

She said, “Between worlds. You’re slipping between them.”



*02:19:19 - 10/28/2018*

Couldn’t sleep. Again.

Every time I tried closing my eyes, he was there — standing in the corner of my room. That tall silhouette. That hat. That awful stillness. My brain kept mumbling about hypnagogia, those half-asleep shadow glitches you get when you’re overtired, but even that explanation felt tired. Like my mind was running out of excuses.

And when I finally turned on a light, the shadow didn’t disappear right away.

A shadow should vanish instantly.

Instead, it hesitated, as if it were annoyed by the sudden bright interruption.

I’ve noticed a pattern now. Events keep happening the same way:

1. First the cold
2. Then the tremors
3. Then the shape

My stomach is a mess tonight. Too much stress, too much coffee, too much work. It might be gastritis, it might be reflux, it might be that I subsisted solely on granola bars and vending machine sodas. I’ll grab antacids in the morning. If I remember.

I’m so tired. Tired in a way sleep doesn’t fix.

I’m trying — genuinely trying — to stay logical, stay grounded, stay in the world where everything has a clinical explanation.

But every time the lights dim, I feel myself slipping.



*22:07:47 - 10/28/2018*

Something’s wrong with this journal file.

When I opened it tonight on the old work computer tonight, half of my earlier entry was missing. Not corrupted, *missing*. Cleanly carved out, like someone highlighted whole sections and just… erased them. The part about the cold spot and the paragraph about the shadow becoming more defined — gone. Completely gone.

And the *remember the order of things* line?

More of them.

Three this time…

All dropped between paragraphs I know I wrote.

I deleted them.

Then I checked the file’s history. This isn’t a web app, just a free, standalone typing program, something too simplistic to have cloud sync or fancy features. But it still tracks basic things: last opened, last modified, which device made the edits.

According to the data, the file was opened at 3:33 in the morning.

Which makes no sense, because I was… here. On shift. Using the work computer. Logged in under my name, watching the seconds crawl by while I documented patient care.

Could it be a glitch? A timestamp error? Some weird file recovery thing?

Maybe.

But the edits weren’t random.  
They were specific, targeted.

The parts about the cold.  
The parts about the shadow.  
The parts where I sounded scared.

Deleted.

And those lines —  
*remember the order of things*  
*remember the order*  
*remember*

I’ll change my password in the morning.



*01:26:19 - 10/29/2018*

Mrs. Hancock had a bad night last night. The worst since I’ve known her.

She tried to get out of bed (which shouldn’t even be physically possible). Her legs don’t bear weight. Her trunk strength is basically gone. She hasn’t stood, not even with assistance, in years.

But the alarms didn’t go off. When I checked the panel afterward, every indicator was green. Fully functional. Like nothing had happened. Every safeguard we have in place for when confused residents fall was in true, working order.

When I found her, she kept whispering the same thing over and over:

“He’s closer now. He likes to stand behind you.”

And the awful part is — I *felt* someone behind me.

That same thick, cold pressure.

But when I turned around?

Just the wall. Just the useless vent humming warm air. Just the empty corner I’ve been insisting to myself is empty.

My tremors are worse tonight. Worse than I want to admit. When I tried to document some vitals, the pen shook so hard the numbers looked like a seismograph. I botched a med calculation — basic math, something I could do half-dead after a double. My brain stalled for fifteen full seconds, blank as a rebooting monitor.

That’s not just sleep deprivation. That’s not “working too many nights in a row.” Something is *wrong*.

My coworkers kept watching me like I was about to drop. One told me I’d “gone gray around the gills.” Another offered to walk me to the bathroom “in case I met Jesus on the way.”

I joked it off, but I didn’t feel steady. My depth perception is off. Straight hallways feel like they’re tilting. My right ear keeps popping, like I’m changing altitude even when I’m standing still. And my skin… my skin feels thinner than it should.

Like the boundary between me and the world is wearing down.



*23:07:13 - 10/29/2018*

Insomnia again.

I keep hearing footsteps in my hallway. Heavy ones. Slow. Pacing, like someone trying to decide which direction to go. I checked twice — nothing there, just my empty apartment breathing in that weird uneven way it does at night. But the sound was real. I know the weight of real footsteps.

I tried distracting myself by rereading some of my recent entries.

Huge mistake.

There’s another entry sitting in the file now. Not the “order of things” line — a different one. Short. Clean. Centered on its own line like it wanted to be noticed:

>

That’s it.  
No timestamp.  
No misplaced keystrokes.  
No hesitation in the phrasing.

I didn’t write it.  
I *know* I didn’t.  
I would put my license, my job, my sanity on the line for that.

I ran a malware scan: nothing. No suspicious activity. No sign that anyone touched the file but me.

And yet that sentence just… exists now. Like it sprouted in the blank spaces between the words.

Or, it did until I erased it.

My chest is tight. Not panic-tight, more like pressure-tight; like the air is weighing more than it should. I feel feverish, but my temperature is fine. My hearing keeps dipping, softening around the edges, like someone is cupping their hands over my ears and then taking them away again.

I’m going to try to sleep. Or at least lie still with my eyes closed and pretend that counts. Tomorrow is my first of five night shifts in a row. After, I actually have a little trip booked to Tallulah Falls to get the hell out of this nightmarish state.

I know I can do anything for a few nights.



*02:22:27 - 10/30/2018*

I wasn’t going to write tonight.

My hands won’t stop their little subdermal buzzing, and my head feels stuffed with cotton soaked in static. Every blink feels like dragging my eyelids through wet sand. But too much happened, and if I don’t get it down, I’m afraid I’ll start losing the order of things.

That phrase keeps looping in my mind.  
*The order of things.*

So.

Before anything slips…

Mrs. Hancock is gone.

The paramedics took her out around midnight.

One minute she was alert enough to complain that the tea “tasted like swamp water steeped in sin,” and the next she was spiraling — fever blooming out of nowhere, pulse racing so fast the telemetry lagged behind reality, oxygen plummeting like someone had pulled a plug in the middle of her chest.

I’ve seen strokes. I’ve seen sepsis. I’ve seen the body fold in on itself in a hundred tragic ways.

This wasn’t any of those.

This felt… wrong. Clinically wrong. Physically wrong. Wrong in a way no charting language exists for.

When they wheeled her toward the elevator, she grabbed my sleeve. Hard. Stronger than she has *ever* been. Her fingers were cold and stiff, like marble pulled from deep earth. She pulled me close, the way people do when they’re whispering a secret meant to outlive them:

“Don’t let him walk you home.”

I can’t stop hearing it, can’t stop replaying the exact rasp of her voice…

Over the last two days, the “symptoms” I’ve been experiencing have changed.

The tremors have a rhythm now. A pulse. Like they’re syncing to something in the room when I’m alone. A heartbeat I don’t recognize.

And earlier tonight, I made the mistake of looking at myself in the bathroom mirror.

For a full second — maybe two — I didn’t recognize the woman staring back.

My face looked too tight in some places and too hollow in others, like someone had lightly reshaped the features but hadn’t bothered blending the edges. The dark shadows under my eyes weren’t helped by makeup. The paleness that settled wasn’t due to exhaustion.

I touched my cheekbone and felt the strangest disconnect, like the shape under my fingers didn’t match the shape in the glass.

Then I blinked, and the moment snapped back. Mostly.

And my apartment? It feels off. Not dangerous. Not even hostile.

Just… occupied. Like something else is sharing the air with me, standing just outside the edge of the lamplight.

The corner by my bedroom door keeps tugging at my attention. But, every time I look straight at it — nothing. Just a regular shadow, too deep for the wattage of the bulb.

But when I look indirectly, when it’s just at the edge of my vision…

I *sense* pressure there.  
A dense weight, air with mass.  
Like someone inhaling very quietly, trying not to draw notice.

I just need to get through these shifts.

One shift. Then the next few will flow like water.

Then vacation… I’ll sleep for a week. Eat something real. Pretend none of this ever happened.

I’ll update again tonight… I’m hoping Mrs. Hancock is back by then, this place really is a lot darker without her.



PRESENT DAY

I don’t know why I thought having the journal printed on paper would make anything clearer or more meaningful... Maybe it just felt safer than staring at the screen — like ink might last longer or explain more clearly than that flash drive.

When the printer finished, the stack came out warm, normal. Except for the last page. It felt… heavier when I lifted it? Heavier than paper should be.

At first glance, I thought the formatting was off. The final line, the one I *know* was centered at the bottom of Jacobi’s last entry wasn’t centered anymore. It had slid to the left. Barely. Just enough to register.

I checked the digital document.  
Still centered. Perfectly aligned.

I printed the last page again.

This time the sentence moved further left and dropped down, almost brushing the margin. Like it was inching its way toward the edge.

I tried one more copy. The line moved further.

The digital file hasn’t changed — not a single pixel. But with every printout, the sentence slides further left, and lower, as if gravity is different on the page than in the file.

I put the pages in a drawer and shut it harder than I meant to. Still, I keep glancing at it. The way you check a locked door long after you’ve tested the knob.

I’m going to return the flash drive. Put it back exactly where I found it.  
Someone else can archive this. Someone else can figure out whatever “order” she kept writing about.

Before I closed the drawer for the last time, I looked at the final printed page — just once — and for a split second, when I looked up from the paper, I saw it.

A shape.

Tall. Straight. Blurred at the edges like a shadow trying to decide whether it belongs to something solid.

By the time I blinked, it was gone.

I’m telling myself it’s nothing, it’s just nerves, too many hours reading someone else’s unraveling. But I heard something a minute ago.

Context: There's a strange building that runs a strange program - said program is, largely, an effort to rehome and rehabilitate yanderes. Any who undertakes the challenge is given monetary rewards, and that certainly makes it appealing. But you signed up for a different reason and, after rigorous training, the day came that you adopted your own yandere. Apparently, the program matched with a man slightly older than you named ‘Cassius’, an enigma of a man, per the program’s own words. Still, you’d like to give him a chance, and he seems quite willing to give you the same… and much more. 

Setting: The wedding venue

[K] = Kyle, brother of a certain yandere, surprisingly chill

[C] = Cassius aka Cas, because apparently this place is full of shortened names

***

[Scene opens at the Yan-Yan Adoption Center] 


[SFX: The Listener entering the agency, bing-bong] 


[You walk up to the strange building and walk inside, as instructed. A tired man sits at the counter] 


[Pause?] 



[The man at the counter puts his book away and forces a tired smile] 


[K] “Salutations. I assume you’re our twelve o’clock?” 


[Pause!] 


[K] “Right. Let me lock up the front… Cas is a tricky one, wouldn't be the first time he managed to get up on the roof. Still can’t believe you wanted him, of all the yanderes we have in here… But, it’s not the weirdest selection I’ve seen, to be fair.” 


[Pause…?] 


[The man locks the front doors, chatting as if nothing is wrong with this at all] 


[K] “Enh, I mean, I did attend my brother’s wedding a few months ago, and he was one of our most ‘dangerous’, so to speak… But he’s also proof that the program works, in his own weird way. He went from barely being able to function without an anxiety attack to being married, having a job, seeing a future for himself…” 


[Pause…] 


[K] “Well, it’s not as simple as just filling out paperwork. This is a high risk program that matches people with the folks in here so that they have the best chance of rehabilitation. No one who is just seeking a relationship can enroll, but it’s also highly recommended that you not be in a relationship, which is a Hell of an ask. We take great pains to match people who might actually be able to help. Which is… why we were surprised you matched with Cas. The person my brother matched with needed special training in combat just to be around him, just in case…” 


[...Pause?] 


[The man frowns but doesn’t sugarcoat it] 


[K] “Cas or ‘Cassius’ is a special case. I don't know how else to describe him. By all accounts, you’d look at him and think, ‘Yeah, this is probably a successful businessman, minimal skeletons in the closet’... Usually kind of a smarmy jerk, if I’m honest, but he’s got a good heart. But the guy gets lost in his own head a lot. My brother wears his insecurities on his sleeve, Cas, uh… Tries desperately to ignore them. Listen, uh…” 


[He turns to you, uncertain] 


[K] “He had a REALLY strong reaction to being picked. It’s the first time it’s happened for him, so he’s… not himself, right now. Or maybe he is himself and I just never noticed… I don’t know. The point is, you’re welcome to meet him in his room; it’s standard procedure. I’ll be right outside if anything happens. If you still want to proceed?” 


[. . . Pause <3] 


[He snorts a bit, eyes on the little cake you brought] 


[K] “He’s never gonna let me forget you brought him a cake, ugh… C’mon. Follow me, and we’ll get you to your yandere.” 


[SFX: The Listener following Kyle. Yes, Kyle still works here, the pay is really good] 


[K] “Alright, here we are. Cas! Visitor!” 


[C, muffled] “Indubitably!” 


[K, with a bit of a side-eye] “Alright… Head on in, and remember - I’m right here if you need me.” 


[SFX: The door being opened] 


[You enter the room and, sure as anything, a man in a somewhat dusty suit awaits you. He’s adjusting his tie when you come in and whirls around with a dazzling smile] 


[C] “HELLO! Er, hello. Ahem. Hi.” 


[Pause~] 


[His smile twitches a bit, receding into something a bit more natural and less shark-like] 


[C] “Soo, you’re the sweet little thing that chose Cas, huh? Good choice! GREAT choice! If you direct your eyes up here, you will see a set of guns - boom and BOOM - great for carrying groceries, princess-carrying kind people, and I’m pretty sure I can still crack an egg here, BUT that remains to be seen!” 


[Pause…?] 


[He lets out a manic laugh, desperately trying to reel it back] 


[C] “Me?? Am I OK??? I’m TERRIFIC!” 


[. . . ] 


[C] “...Is, ah… Is that cake for me…?” 


[Pause] 


[He studies it, still lapsing between that odd, salesman-like speak and genuine confusion] 


[C] “Oh! You even got my favorite, angel food cake! Ha HA, it’s an angel, just like you, huh???” 


[...Pause?] 


[C] “I’m fine! Just excited! SO excited, you have no idea! Also forgot to take my meds with the food, so my stomach is a little off, but I am absolutely phenomenal, my dear. Peachy keen!” 


[. . . ?] 


[K, from outside] “Cas, you good in there??” 


[Cas’s smile immediately shakes, though it stubbornly lingers. He falls silent, just staring at the cake with a vacant smile] 


[K] “...Cas???” 


[Pause!] 


[K] “...Alright, but just holler if you need me to come in…” 


[C] “Aheh, forgot… Forgot Kyle would be out there, of course he would. Course he would…” 


[Pause…?] 


[C, uncertain] “...You still want to take me? Even though I’ve bombed this interview?” 


[Pause…] 


[C] “It *wasn’t* an interview??? Oh, Kyle, that motherf-!” 


[Pause!] 


[C] “...You’ve already decided on me? Oh… O-OK.” 


[Pause?] 


[C, weak] “...I’d still very much like to go with you, yes. Sorry, I’m a lot, I don’t… I don’t mean to be…” 


[Pause] 


[Cas takes a breath while you steady him] 


[C] “OK! I am on cake-holding duties, Captain, as you command!” 


[You give him the cake to hold and go back to the door, rapping on it a few times. Kyle pokes his head in quickly] 


[SFX: The above] 


[K] “All good?” 


[Pause <3] 


[He gives you a little smile and nods] 


[K] “Happy to get his stuff boxed up if you want to pull your car up, sure. Glad you decided you two were a good fit.” 


[C] “No cake for you, Kyle!” 


[Kyle rolls his eyes and shrugs] 


[K] “Oh no. How will I go on? More cake for you, Cas, you need the calories anyways. Now, c’mon, get dressed in something that doesn’t look like it’s from the Victorian era and you’ll be on your way.” 


[C] “Eugh, fine.” 


[SFX: Cas not giving a single fuck and undressing] 


[P-Pause!] 


[K] “And there’s his bare ass… Didn’t need a fourth viewing of it this week. If you could follow me, I’ll uh… Take you back to the desk where there isn’t a naked man trying to sneak cake.” 


[C] “I do have ears, you know! You told me to change, I’m doing it!” 


[K] “Yeeeeep, and we’re walking, and walking… Sally, keep an eye on Cas and help him pack up, will you? He’s going home.” 


[The female orderly peers in, wrinkles her nose, peers in again, then sort of gives a sigh and nods] 


[Pause…?] 


[SFX: The Listener being led to the front desk / Kyle unlocking the front] 


[K] “Well… He did his best to impress you, I think.” 


[Pause <3] 


[K] “I’m glad you think he’s ‘sweet’. Here, the front is unlocked, go ahead and pull your car around. You have the info packet with all the resources on it, right? Just in case things get a bit beyond your handling and all… Cas doesn’t have a violent record, but with this condition, things can escalate quickly.” 


[Pause] 


[K] “Good. Alright, we’ll get him for you, then. Thanks for helping with the program, your free coffee voucher will arrive in the mail in two to four business days, you can put little hats on them, but we don’t advise it, and no multiple adoptions without special training. Have a nice day.” 


[SFX: The Listener going and getting their car] 


[You pull around as instructed and pop the trunk so they can load Cas’s stuff. He climbs into the passenger seat somewhat awkwardly, shivering] 


[Pause??] 


[C, shivering] “F-F-Fine, just f-f-f-forgot w-weather exists and sometimes the weather is c-c-cold…” 


[Pause <3] 


[C] “Blanket in the back seat? Oh, phenomenal! Good thinking ahead.” 


[He wraps himself up with a happy sigh] 


[C] “...I’m not used to someone caring about me willingly. So… Sorry if I’m weird.” 


[Pause <3] 


[C] “I’m just… surprised you would go through all the training and requirements, and then pick ME of all the options. Erm, not that I’m not a GREAT choice, mind you~.” 


[Pause <3] 


[He falls silent as you assure him you think he’s a great choice, too] 


[Pause?] 


[C] “The… The cake?” 


[. . . Pause?] 


[C] “I did not eat ALL of it! I just… You know, ate a lot of it and then Sally took the rest because I was sort of choking…” 


[Pause??] 


[C] “I’m fine! Just… sorely lacking in delicious cake now, which is sad. But a warm blanket in a nice car going to my new home… That is good, yes?” 


[Pause <3] 


[He settles, taking in the world around him with wide eyes] 


[C] “...Huh. That tree was a lot smaller the last time I saw it.” 


[. . . Pause </3] 


[C] “Hm? I’m great! Don’t be sad, no sad, everything is the opposite of sad!” 


[Pause] 


[He leans against you quietly as you drive, still with that strained, mysterious smile] 


[C] “...Why did you pick *me*?” 


[Pause <3] 


[C] “...You answered that fast. You’ve clearly thought about this a lot… Who you let into your heart, I mean.” 


[Pause <3] 


[C] “...Maybe I’ll learn that, too, in time. For now… I just want to sleep. Is that OK?” 


[Pause <3] 


[C] “OK, good. Night night.” 


[With that, he shuts his eyes and rests against you, seeming too tired for anything else] 


[SFX: Fade out on the Listener driving them home] 


[To be continued?]

I've finally decided to sit down and flesh out my stories, I'm self publishing next month. I have 3 short (<10k words) stories, and this is the first. I don't have people in my life who are avid readers or who enjoy horror/ horror-adjacent content, so I'm coming here. Cheers!

INTRO

The only reason I was up on the sixth floor in the first place was because administration finally decided to reopen it. The administration had shut it down since COVID, locking it tight and leaving it to stew in its own stale air for years. Now that census is creeping up again, the bigwigs upstairs want it polished and presentable before the cleaning crew comes through — “a soft relaunch,” as if the floor is some kind of restaurant and not a wing that saw more death than discharge.

My job was simple: go through the abandoned desks and cabinets, make sure nothing confidential got left behind. No patient files, no medication lists, no scraps of paperwork that could get the facility in trouble. Mostly it was dust, outdated pamphlets, and pens that had long since dried up. The kind of tedious work they hand to whoever isn’t quick enough to duck behind a med cart when a supervisor walks by.

That’s when I found the flash drive — in the bottom drawer, tucked behind a stack of old forms. Nothing special, just one of those encrypted USBs IT hands out when they don’t trust staff to email themselves documents like normal people. I figured it was leftover junk, destined for the shred bin. But protocol is protocol, so instead of tossing it, I checked it.

My work laptop wouldn’t recognize it. Not even a flicker. The old all-in-one PC in the back room, though — the one nobody uses unless they’re desperate—picked it up instantly. A little drive icon blinked onto the screen like it had been waiting for someone patient enough to try.

Most of the folders were exactly what I expected: “2018 Certs,” “St. Iggy SOPs,” “BLANK Care Plans,” a graveyard of administrative clutter. But tucked between the work files was a single outlier, named simply: **“Personal.”** Capital P. Like the unnamed flash drive, it gave no hints.

When I opened it, I didn’t find photos or receipts or someone’s half-finished resignation letter. Instead, there were journal entries written by an RN named Jacobi, who worked here about five years ago.

I’ll be honest — what she wrote got under my skin. Not in a Damien Leone horror flick way, just… a cold little shiver that hung around longer than it should have. Maybe that was her intention. From what I read in this file, I’m not sure I’d *want* to know what her intention was. Hard to say with things like these.

But because the damn USB won’t work in my laptop, I’ve got it plugged into the old computer. I’m typing this up on my laptop while I read off that flickering monitor, copying every line exactly as it shows up on the drive. No edits, no polish, nothing added or cut. Just her words, kept alive in a place where they won’t vanish with the rest of the forgotten junk in that desk drawer.

Throwing it away didn’t feel right. Erasing it felt worse. So I’m putting it here, untouched.

Whatever anyone makes of it after this… well, that’s not on me.

# PART 2 - THE JOURNAL

*04:17:27 - 10/20/2018*

I used to be good at this. Journaling, I mean. I’ve filled notebooks since middle school- cheap spiral ones with crooked wire spines, leather ones I bought when I was trying to “take myself seriously,” even a bright pink Lisa Frank diary at one point, because apparently I peaked early. Somewhere along the way — work, life, all the usual shit — I just… stopped. Or, I didn’t stop so much as drifted away from it, like everything else when you’re tired for long enough.

My therapist says the act of writing things down helps “regulate the nervous system” and I’m trying. You see, I think you get to a certain age and everything starts living like you’re walking around underwater, and all you’re trying to do is make sense of the shapes moving past you and make sense of yourself moving past shapes.

Journaling’s supposed to help with that. Untangle things. Keep the dark from smearing into the everyday.

So. Here I am again, typing into an online journal in the middle of the night at work because I promised I’d try. Besides, the night shift does funny things to you if you don’t find somewhere to put the overflow. It’s quiet in a way that isn’t restful. You start hearing thoughts that don’t sound like they came from you.

Since this is going to be a new blog, I guess I should introduce myself: my name’s Jacobi, and I’m a certified registered nurse at St. Ignatius, or as I like to refer to it, St. Insane-shits. I work the locked unit at night, so yeah — I’m very well-centered.

I’ve been here for three years. Started as an aide — wiping mouths, cleaning up God-knows-what from God-knows-where, changing beds that never stay dry, scrubbing every crevice the Florida heat could make worse. If you’ve ever worked in a locked unit down here in August, you know what I mean. Everything sweats. Even the walls, like they’re breathing warm on the back of your neck. My scrubs were so soaked by sunrise, I could’ve entered them in a wet-T-shirt contest and probably placed.

Not glamorous, but it’s been steady. Predictable. Comforting, in the same way a bruise is: you get used to checking it every few hours just to see if it’s gotten worse, if the colors have changed, bled.

When I graduated this past August, I told my boss I’d passed my boards. I was expecting, bare minimum, a “congratulations” or a nod. Something human.

Instead, he looked at me the way people stare at a busted AC unit: mildly offended it dared to break on *their* shift. Then, he trudged into the office without a word. I figured maybe he was grabbing paperwork. Or a surprise muffin. Something.

Nope.

He returned with a still-warm stack of printer paper, half crooked, and dropped it on the counter like he was delivering a verdict.

“Test,” he said. “Take it. Don’t miss anything important.”

Which would’ve been fine if the test weren’t clearly put together by someone half-asleep and possibly concussed. Half the questions had typos so bad they changed the meaning entirely. One asked about a medication discontinued in the 1980s. Another simply said: *Explain vitals.* No punctuation. No specifics. Just a vague philosophical dare.

I filled it out anyway — because you don’t argue with a man who keeps his coffee in a thermos the color of nicotine stains.

When I handed it back, he didn’t read a word. Not one. He glanced at the paper as if it were an aggressive coupon, nodded once, and grunted a noise that, I guess, counted as approval. Then he fished the narcotics keys from his pocket, slapped them into my hand, and wrote “RN” on my badge with a half-dead Sharpie. Like he was tagging livestock.

My first week as a “real nurse,” I had a patient hurl his dentures at me because he said they were “possessed by a little man who won’t shut the hell up.” Another resident crawled under her bed and refused to come out until someone “sent the gators home.” And on day six, right after I’d spent thirty minutes wiping feces off a bedrail someone had managed to fingerpaint, a thunderstorm blew out the AC. Having twenty confused, overheated elders trapped on a locked floor in August is something I wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy. The scent alone could knock the sin out of a preacher.

Still… I stayed.

Maybe because I’m stubborn. Maybe because I’m broke. Maybe because, in some weird way, I care about these people. Even when they’re throwing things or screaming or asking if I’m their third wife come back from the dead. Working night shift on a locked unit does strange things to your heart. Makes you soft in places you didn’t know could go soft.

Well, that’s me. I can hear Mr. Murdoch screaming, so I know it’s close to 5:30am… you can set your watch by that man. I’ll pick this up later or during my shift tonight.

*23:04:57 - 10/20/2018*

I feel better after writing last shift, even though it was just to myself in this stupid text file. For continuity, I guess I should explain where I work so some of my rants will make sense. This is supposed to be cathartic, after all (I wish I could eye-roll here).

The six-story building sits on a rise that barely qualifies as a hill — more like the land got tired halfway through standing up. Because of that half-hearted lift, the first floor feels sunk into the ground, as if the earth has started reclaiming it one humid inch at a time. From the outside, it looks every bit its age: a 1940s southern block relic gone soft at the edges, its concrete pitted and sun-bleached, streaked with rust and the dark bloom of mildew. Kudzu fingers up the walls where the groundskeeper keeps losing the fight, and palmettos crowd close, their fronds rasping in the heat like they’re whispering about what the building’s seen. Years of sideways rain swells the window frames, buckling their corners. The roofline sags just enough to catch fallen pine needles and oak leaves, which rot into a thick, sour-smelling mulch. Even the air around it feels heavy, like the exasperated sigh of an angry loved one.

Inside, nothing ever really dries. Moisture beads on the walls, and the ceilings drip when the AC fails. The floors go tacky in patches even after a fresh mop— your shoes make faint kissing sounds on the tile as if the building itself is reluctant to let you go. Dehumidifiers hum down every hallway, buzzing like trapped beetles, yet the damp still wins. When storms roll in, water sluices down the slope and collects at the back entrance, turning the concrete dark and cold, releasing that smell of wet limestone and something older underneath. The stains and spots and peeling paint cover all six stories of this place.

The first floor is its own little swamp: the facility laundry room, the kitchen, staff lockers — all pressed together in a low corridor where the air hangs thick enough to touch. The lights don’t just flicker; they stammer to life, blinking like they’re fighting their way through root-laden brackish water. The air vents release plumes that smell like standing water and old fabric softener cooked too long in the heat. Beneath it all is that sharp, metallic ghost-note of mold, the kind that settles in your sinuses no matter how shallowly you’ve learned to breathe. Sometimes it hits you with a whiff of something worse — a drowned, organic and putrefied sweetness that makes your stomach turn.

Up one level, the main floor is actually the second floor, which opens frailly onto the main drive — a stretch of cracked asphalt split open wide enough for weeds and palmetto shoots to claw through, and beset with more potholes than residents. Ceiling fans spin overhead in slow, tired loops, pushing the heat around like a prodded stubborn steer. Visitors arrive already sweated through, fanning themselves with clipboards or pocket books while sunscreen and perfume curdle in the humidity. The entire floor smells like an ode to sunbaked pavement, cheap deodorant fighting its last stand, and the faint ammonia tang of spilled disinfectant drying on tile. Even on cooler, cloudy days, the asphalt outside glistens with a damp sheen, as if the ground sweats too, bleeding moisture into the air.

Above the gala, as I call it, come the medical floors — four of them, three medical and one locked psychiatric — stacked like tired vertebrae. Up here, the air sits heavier, quieter, expectant. The halls bowed ever so slightly where the terrazzo tile met the wooden baseboards, ballooned and marred by decades of storms, leaks, and neglect that no paint could ever hide. Something in the building always seems to be expanding, settling, adjusting itself: soft groans in the walls, a creak at the far end of the hall, a whisper of shifting weight overhead.

The smells come off differently here, too. A penetrating blend of antiseptic and nitrile gloves. Stale linens and unwashed bodies. The briny, putrid stench of bedpans wheeled a little too slowly to the dirty utility room. Somewhere deeper, there’s the sweet, sickly scent of skin breaking down, decomposition. I know it as that unmistakable warning sign nurses learn to catch before it blooms into something worse; a layered, low-grade rot that gets into the grout, into the wheels, the chairs, into your hair if you stay too long.

The historic leaded windows? They don’t help. They’re essentially opaque year-round, stained by storms long passed, their glass warped just enough to make the outside world flicker like a mirage. Press your palm to one, and the condensation blooms instantly, warm and slick — like the building itself is sweating through its own fever. From certain angles, the view looks submerged; trees blur into green smears, cars melt into drifting shapes. You start to understand why some residents become confused. The world beyond the windows never looks quite real.

Which brings me to the top floor, the sixth floor: the locked unit I call home as a nurse. A nightshift nurse. A new nightshift nurse. The air thickens the moment you step off the elevator, heavy in a way that feels almost intentional. It settles in your ears like pressure before a storm. It’s locked because the people here wander, or fight, or forget *where* they are and *who* they are and, more often than not, who *you* are. Dementia, Alzheimer’s, old age, old diseases — it all lives here.

The alarms chirp at random, humidity frying the wiring until the door sensors sound half-awake. The vents make soft tapping sounds that don’t match pipes or machinery — more like fingernails drumming a table somewhere out of sight. Night shift quiet is never true quiet; it’s the shuffling of slippered feet behind closed doors, a muttered fragment of someone’s long-forgotten memory, the sudden thud of a chair someone shouldn’t be strong enough to move. Every sound is small, but sharp enough to keep you alert hours after your coffee wears off.

I started on this floor years ago. For some reason or another, it’s hasn’t let go of me. But I guess it’s a two-way street… because for all the shit this place throws at me (literally and figuratively), there’s always been a bright spot: Mrs. Hancock. I want to write more on her after I do my rounds.

*01:53:30 - 10/20/2018*

UGH! No matter how quietly I try to enter Miss Kathy’s room, she always starts to do this sort of cry laughing. A mix of mournful loss and gleeful pleasure, stirred together into a high-pitched release. It cascades into the hallways and wakes the other residents, the ones who actually fall asleep. It’s eerie up here, existing rationally among all of these people. It took me about 2 hours to calm down everyone; god knows where any help is around here.

Back to Mrs. Hancock. The only bright spot on my night shift.

In her 78 years of life, Mrs. Hancock has garnered much acclaim. Local legend. Permanent resident of room 696. In truth, she is my own personal mystery wrapped in myths and the lingering smell of cigarette smoke no one can explain; she hasn’t held a lighter in a decade. A woman with a voice like warm honey poured over broken glass, slow and sweet with an edge sharp enough to cut you.

Her past is a scrapbook of tent revivals, late-night TV interviews, miracle claims, and missing-person cases that never ended the right way. She used to be everything once: a preacher in a wild tent revivalist sect of religion, then a snake-handling healer, a psychic, a scandal incarnate. She always said a man calling himself “God Honey” gave her the gift of sight. Police brought her in once to “help” with an investigation; the children didn’t make it home, but Mrs. Hancock didn’t seem all that moved by the tragedy. She loved the attention, smiling under those harsh fluorescent lights like grief was just another stage direction.

Then the strokes took her legs along with most of her independence, and the family shipped her here. Room 696. She’s been here nine years now, though after strokes hollowed out whole neighborhoods of her brain and dementia shook the street signs loose, she still carries this unsettling, old-Hollywood glamour. Dresses in flowing blacks like she’s forever mourning someone she won’t name, then tops it with accessories so neon they practically vibrate off her sun-leathered skin. Hot pinks. Acid greens. Purples that seem like they’d glow under a black light in a dive bar bathroom. Against her skin, they seemed to hum, a silent, unsettling song of potential hazard, as though she were adorned with the same alert system as coral snakes and monarch butterflies.

*22:37:30 - 10/22/2018*

I’m back at work tonight, using the work computer this time. My laptop isn’t staying charged, no matter what I do. I asked I.T. for a USB or something so I could transfer files if I needed to. They asked why I didn’t just email myself, and I reminded them about the scandal last year when someone found out their emails were being spied on… yeah, no thank you. Eventually, I managed to bullshit my way into an older, “gently destroyed” flash drive that the IT manager had in his desk. There’s 2 gigs, so that will be more than enough until I can figure out my laptop situation…

Short story long, I haven’t written since my last day here. My laptop is being dramatic, I’m exhausted, classic Jacobi. Let me catch you up to now.

My two days off were painfully normal. I managed to wash *and* fold my laundry, which feels like a brag these days. I ordered takeout, watched garbage TV, and stared at my ceiling fan a lot. The heat doesn’t help. It drains the will to do anything except lie still and pray the AC doesn’t die. October in Florida isn’t fall- it’s summer with mood swings. The air has that same heavy, unbothered attitude, but now it comes with threats. Tropical storm warnings. Post-hurricane humidity. Clouds that hang low and swollen, like they’re deciding whether to spit rain or swallow it.

By the time I crossed the parking lot, my clothes were already clinging to me. The breeze felt metallic, like something scorched and ocean-salted.

I’m thinking about all this as I walk the hall tonight, everything sticking to me like a second skin. The evening hasn’t cooled a damn thing. Humidity moves in waves, rolling down the corridor like a living thing. My hair feels wet even though I showered right before coming in. Even now, hours later, my scrubs are still damp in all the wrong places. Sweat crawls down my spine in slow, unpleasant drips, gathering at my waistband like it’s plotting a coup to overthrow me before we break the new day.

Screw it. I’m going to change.

*03:50:33 - 10/23/2018*

Okay.  
Something happened a few hours ago when I went to change my scrubs, and I’m still trying to decide if I’m overreacting or if this place really is rotting my brain.

After I peeled myself out of my swamp-soaked scrubs and put on a dry pair, I hit the vending machine for a Coke Zero — because that’s the kind of self-care I’m capable of on night shift — and then wandered over to the staff bulletin board. You know, to delay the inevitable.

**Good luck, Carmen! We hate to see you leave (traitor)**  
**Wash your hands after EVERY patient**  
**Sever weather alert for the week**

Sever. Not *severe.* Definitely on par for this place.

I rolled my eyes and left, started walking back towards my unit. I was thinking about the history of this place, the sinking foundation, the peeling paint and paper, the residents… and next thing I knew, I was thinking about Mrs. Hancock and her neon jewelry, her half-coherent “visions”, the glassy way she stares through to your being without regard to your physical self.

I decided to do my rounds a little early (perhaps tonight would be the night I didn’t wake Miss Kathy), and went to check on Mrs. Hancock first.

When I got to her room, I stopped. Cold.

Her door was wide open. She hates that.

She treats her room like a sanctum, keeps it dark, keeps it closed, keeps it hers. Says the hallway air “muddies her visions.” Even the new aides learn her rule on day one: *don’t keep the door open unless you want her wrath or a prophecy. Sometimes both.*

Her room isn’t like the others’ here. Most rooms look like stripped-down hospital cells: beige walls, bad lighting, the faint scent of antibacterial wipes and rot. Mrs. Hancock’s, though… it always feels staged. Heavy blackout curtains pinned shut with locked-unit-approved securing devices. A cheap battery-powered candle flickering on her dresser like she’s warding off something. The air is thick with lavender powder, and neon scarves hang from the bedrail like offerings. And she always keeps one of her many Bibles on the nightstand, open, but never on the same page twice.

Crossing that threshold always felt like stepping into someone else’s dream.

So, her door being open? Tonight?  
My brain immediately started pulling excuses out of thin air.

Maybe the aide left it open? But that would require the aide doing rounds. Which would require the aide being here. Which is not the case tonight… hasn’t been for a while.

The thought unraveled the closer I got.

I reached out, ready to gently shut the door and pretend none of it was strange, but the air escaping from her room felt different. Wrong. Cold, even with the humidity swallowing the whole building.

My breath caught just behind my sternum.

Mrs. Hancock was on the floor.

Not slumped against the bed.  
Not halfway into her wheelchair.

She wasn’t *lying* so much as caught—twisted onto her side, one knee pinned beneath her, the other angled out wrong, the whole posture stiff and unnatural, like someone had paused her mid-collapse. One arm stretched toward her dresser, fingers curled tight around nothing. One of the neon scarves she always insisted on wearing was crumpled beneath her cheek like a bright, dying flame.

Her eyes were wide.

From the doorway, I could see there was something in them, something focused. Not confusion. Not fear. Something colder.

Behind me, the hallway hummed: lights buzzing, AC dripping, the usual night-shift soundtrack… but suddenly it all felt wrong. Muted. Thinned out.

Don’t get me wrong- Residents end up in strange places sometimes. Fear folds them. Confusion wedges them. I’ve found people tucked behind curtains, curled beneath tables, crouched under sinks.

But Mrs. Hancock is bedbound. She has been for years.

Her legs are useless. Her core is weak. She can’t stand, can’t pivot, can’t even slide to the floor without help.

For her to be on the ground… like *this*…

Someone had to put her there.

I took a small, single step inside. Then another. And another. Until I was only a foot away, kneeling and steadying myself, in front of her.

I swallowed hard, my mouth dry despite the new sweat forming on my forehead.

“Mrs. Hancock?” I whispered. My voice came out small. Wrong. Like the room swallowed half the sound before it reached her.

She didn’t blink. Not at first.

Then her gaze shifted, just barely, toward the left. Not at me. Not through me.

She was staring behind me.

Her chest rose once, shallow and hesitant, like she was remembering how to breathe. And then came the sobbing.

It wasn’t the usual kind we hear on this floor — not the lonely, confused crying that drifts out of dementia rooms at night and softens once you say their name. This was different. Wet, shaking terror. Primal. A sound dragged up from somewhere deep under the ribs; the kind a frightened child makes when they’re absolutely certain something else is still in the room with them, under their bed or inside their closet.

“Mrs. Hancock?” My voice came out quieter than I intended. “It’s me”, I said with more register, “Jacobi.”

Her spine went rigid, like she recognized the voice but wasn’t sure if she trusted it. She clutched her scarf tighter to her cheek, knuckles whitening.

I looked around the room, scanning everything without thinking. Working the locked unit trains you to always be situationally aware: cataloging the corners, the ceiling, the hallway reflection in the window glass, the way the shadows sit on the floor. Confusion spreads up here. Theirs becomes yours if you don’t stay anchored, don’t ground yourself in reality.

The room was dim. The bedside lamp cast a weak cone of gold across the bed and part of the floor, but everything outside that small circle sat heavy with shadows. But these didn’t seem like normal shadows. Not the simple absence of light, not the strange darkness that comes with early morning hours. These were darker than they should’ve been, too thick, too deliberate, as if the dark itself was deciding how deep it wished to be.

“Mrs. Hancock, what happened?” I crouched now, careful not to touch her yet. “Did someone come in here?”

She shook her head — fast, frantic — *no, no, no* — then slapped her hands over her ears like the sound of her own breathing was too much.

I looked around again. Her wheelchair was exactly where we always parked it. No overturned furniture. No slide marks on the tile. Bedrails locked. Bed alarm armed. Every single safeguard is still in place.

There is *no universe* where she got like this on her own.

“Did someone move you?” I asked her again, slower this time. I was hesitant; I didn’t know if I really wanted the answer.

She lifted her face just enough for me to see her eyes- wild, glassy, and fixed on the far corner behind me.

“Don’t,” she whispered. “Don’t look at him.” The sticky warmth of her voice gone, replaced with one that sounded more like shattered crystal, high and vulnerable.

A pulse of heat shot through my arms, all the way to my fingertips. My blood pressure spiked so fast I tasted metal.

I didn’t turn around.

“Mrs. Hancock,” I said carefully, “there’s no one here but us.”

She laughed, a thin, broken sound, and covered her mouth like speaking too loud might invite something closer.

“Oh, my dear…” she whispered through her fingers, voice quivering, “he doesn’t leave just because you refuse to see him.” When she removed her hands, she was smiling a wide, toothless grin that felt rehearsed. I noticed a string of drool from her sagging chin to her scarf, thick and sticky.

My stomach twisted hard.

Dementia makes people see things all the time. Shadow figures, children crouched under beds, dead husbands standing in corners. I’ve had residents insist I was their sister, their mother, their cat. Hallucinations come in every shape imaginable. I’m not afraid of hallucinations.

But something about her posture, the rigid line of her spine, the angle of her neck, the sharp way her eyes snapped back, again and again, to the same spot in the room? It set off something deep inside me. Instinctive. Animalistic. It was the kind of alert your body registers before your brain even begins to articulate why.

I finally turned.

To my left and behind me, it certainly *looked* empty.

The bedside lamp did not reach that corner; the light only cast its tired luminescence across the bed and the smallest fraction of the floor next to it, leaving everything beyond the dim glow in a heavy, drowned shadow.

But… the air was different there. Thicker. Like humidity pooling in the outline of a column. A shape darker than the rest of the room, it was tall, narrow, vertical. All about one width.

Except at the top. The top of the shape seemed to puff out, appearing much broader than the rest, wide like a dandelion.

A cold pressure started building at the base of my skull, the same way it does right before a migraine or the edge of a panic attack. I blinked hard and dragged my eyes back to her.

“Did you fall?” I asked. It was the only question I could think of that sounded remotely normal. Clinical. Just a nurse seeking information.

She shook her head again. “He was standing over me,” she whispered. “Right over me. Tall as Judgment. Hat like a funeral man. Watching. He comes when I’m slipping.”

I swallowed. My throat clicked painfully.

*Hat. Tall. Watching.*

A lot of these residents cling to one or a few of many superstitions — angels tucked in ceiling tiles, children playing in vents, dead husbands perched on bedrails whispering bedtime stories. But Mrs. Hancock doesn’t talk about the supernatural as if it were fantasy. She talks about it as if it’s familiar. Like she’s discussing someone she once knew well.

Her voice trembled as she lowered her hands completely from her face.

“He said he’s here for someone, on this floor, he knitted the words through my mind.” Another gummy, moist smile.

I felt my heart stutter.

“Oh? Here for who?I asked, controlling my tone.

She closed her eyes tightly, pressing her forehead into the scarf like she was bracing for an impact I couldn’t see.

“Someone who finally saw him.”

Above us, the fluorescent light flickered.

Once. Twice. Lingering.

A long, drawn-out blink.

The shadow in the corner (or the idea of one) darkened. Thickened. Pulling in on itself the way humidity gathers into a storm cloud, as if whatever it was… whatever she thought she saw… had leaned forward a fraction to hear better.

I let out a slow breath, forcing my voice to flatten into something steady, something clinical, something that did not betray the panic curdling low in my stomach.

“Mrs. Hancock,” I said, “I’m going to call for help. We’re getting you back into bed. You’re safe with me.”

She laughed — a soft, hopeless sound cracked clean down the middle.

“No one is safe,” she whispered, “when he knows who sees.”

*06:20:17 - 10/23/2018*

At the time, her words hung between us — *No one is safe when he knows who sees* — and for a moment it felt like they changed the density of the room. Thickened it. Made the air harder to pull into my lungs.

But my brain did what it always does when fear tries to climb into the driver’s seat: it latched onto training with both hands, flipping through the checklist like a sinning nun does the rosary.

*Airway. Breathing. Circulation.*

If I didn’t anchor myself, I’d get dragged straight into whatever terror she was drowning in. The only way to stay steady was to treat all of this like something tangible: a fall risk, a delirium spike, a sudden neurological shift. Something with steps. Something with protocol.

“Okay,” I sighed, half to her, half to myself. “Let’s get some vitals.”

She didn’t react. Her gaze stayed locked on that same corner behind me, pupils wide and shining.

Her breathing was shallow, but consistent. No cyanosis. No trauma. No visible blood.

“Mrs. Hancock, squeeze my hand?” I tested.

She did. Weak, but equal. That was something. A thread of normalcy.

Her blood pressure flashed: 178/96. High, but she always spiked under stress. I’d charted worse. Nothing surprising there.

Pulse: 112. Fast. Tremulous. Fear does that.

Temperature: 94.8°F.

I did a literal double-take. That’s way too low.

I checked again.

*94.9°F.*

The air around us felt colder than the hallway — colder than any room should be in a building where the HVAC just shuffled warm air around in tired circles. But this cold wasn’t drifting. It wasn’t leaking from a vent. It wasn’t moving at all.

It was settling. Rooting itself. Like a refrigerated pocket cut out of the unit.

There’s a logical reason, I told myself. Circulation drops from being on the floor. A malfunctioning vent. A trapped draft.

“Did you fall trying to get warm?” I ventured.

She continued to stared past me. “He touched me.”

A slow ripple of dread unwound itself down my spine.

“Touched you where?” I kept my tone flat, clinical. If I let emotion in, it would hit too hard.

She raised a trembling hand and pointed to her chest.

I leaned in, inspecting for bruises, abrasions, swelling, anything.

Nothing.

Skin intact. No trauma.

But her skin *was* cold. Not cool-from-the-floor cold, like the rest of her body. It was more as if that spot on her chest had been holding a block of ice for hours, damp and chilled.

I did my best to reposition her after making sure she wasn’t in pain, checking her back. No redness. No marks. No injuries.

“Mrs. Hancock,” I paused, thinking of the best question to ask next, “can you tell me what happened before you were on the ground?”

She closed her eyes. “I woke up,” she said. “And he was already watching. Hat first. Always the hat first.”

I drew in my breath slowly, rolling what she said over in my mind.

I reached for the corded call-light remote and pressed the button. I wanted to make sure Mrs. Hancock had a way to get the staff’s attention. The red indicator lit up.

Silence.

No chime. No soft hallway alarm. Nothing.

The sixth floor is *never* quiet, not even at three in the morning. There’s always some background noise: TV static, voices, a bedrail clanging, the squeal of a wheelchair’s crooked wheel.

But now?

Silence.

Pure and absolute, it felts as if the entire unit was holding its breath.

I pressed the call-light again.

Click.

Red glow.

Still nothing.

“Why isn’t the call light chiming?” I mumbled to myself.

Mrs. Hancock let out a quick, high-pitched titter.

“He doesn’t like interruptions.”

I found myself not breathing and took a sharp inhale.

*This is dementia*, I told myself. Delirium. Hallucination. Some Capgras-like misrecognition.

*Textbook.*

It needed to be textbook.

I steeled myself and turned around, the heavy shadow somehow darker, more mass than before. I left her room and went to the patient hallway bathroom where I pulled the red cord that alarms loudly across the whole floor.

No staff came, which isn’t surprising, honestly. You could set off a flare gun in this building and half the shift would still pretend they didn’t hear anything. I got Mrs. Hancock back into bed on my own, even though my hands wouldn’t stop shaking. She wouldn’t look at me. Not once. She kept staring at the same corner, jaw clenched so tight I thought her teeth might crack.

I kept telling myself she was scared. Confused. Triggered by something internal, not external. Dementia episodes can look like that. Hallucinations can feel real enough to pull the breath from your lungs.

I’ve been trying to type this all out for the last hour. My nerves are still shot. My heart keeps doing that little misfire flutter, like it’s trying to warn me of something I can’t see. My shift ended a few minutes ago, but I’m sitting here at the old work computer finishing some charting and this entry.

I’m taking my laptop to the repair shop this morning after shift, and I’m taking the flash drive with me- I don’t need anyone else finding it and judging me.

Especially after last night…

The sun’s coming up. The sky is that sickly bruised-orange and raw-pink shade Florida gets after a night of too much humidity and not enough rest. After I get the laptop taken care of, I need to go home. Shower. Eat something. Pretend I can sleep.

I keep thinking about what she said.

*Someone who finally saw him. No one is safe when he knows who sees.*

I keep telling myself she didn’t mean me.

I prepared by watching videos and reading blogs, but real life on the road is different.

The biggest surprise for me was how quiet nights can be. Sitting alone in a parked van at night is peaceful, but it also took some time to get comfortable with it.

Some things I learned:

* Morning coffee tastes better when you drink it while watching the sunrise from your van.
* Small problems feel big on the road, but solving them feels great.
* The van life community is real. I met more kind people in one month than I did in a whole year living in an apartment.
* Apps are helpful, but asking locals is still the best way to find good parking or camping spots.
* Finding a clean bathroom when you need it is a big win.

I am still learning about saving power, managing water, and finding safe places to sleep. But even on tough days, I don’t regret my decision. Waking up not knowing where you’ll be by evening feels exciting.

Companies in Kenya have tried EVERYTHING to bring people back to the office ,  
new lounges, nicer coffee machines, free fruit, “collaboration zones”, bean bags, even those expensive coffee dispensers that STILL taste like hot water. 😅

But Gen Z said *“Ai, si I just work from home.”*

And the truth is simple:

# Gen Z isn’t refusing the office.

They’re refusing loneliness.

Most Nairobi offices (and even apartment buildings) suffer from the same thing:

* You don’t know people outside your department
* Floors feel silent and stiff
* Everyone is stuck on their laptop
* Socializing feels forced
* No real sense of community

But imagine if your office felt like an actual social space.

That’s where **SOKI**, a Kenyan-made platform 👀, is flipping the script.

#  SOKI: Making Kenyan Offices Feel Social Again

SOKI creates a **geo-fenced social space** for your specific building.

When you’re in the office, you see and chat with others who are ALSO in the building.  
No randoms, no outsiders, no forced vibe.

Here’s what this means:

✨ Meet people outside your department  
✨ Discover chats & interests across the whole building  
✨ Join office micro-communities (techies, gamers, music lovers, lunch squad etc.)  
✨ Make friends you’d never bump into physically  
✨ Keep interactions real because it's *location-based*

And the coolest part?

💬 **Private DMs** that actually feel safe  
🕶️ **Anonymous chats** when you just want to talk freely

Suddenly, the office starts feeling… social.  
Like there are actual humans around.

# Why Kenyan Gen Z Employees Like It

Gen Z in Kenya isn’t hard to understand:

They value vibes, community, connection, not fancy office furniture.

SOKI gives that through:

* Anonymous or open chats
* Spontaneous meetups
* Cross-team friendships
* Feeling like part of something
* Social proof that the office is actually fun

Work stops feeling like a “coming to do my 8–5 and leave” routine…  
and starts feeling like belonging.

#  Why Kenyan Employers Are Paying Attention

When people actually enjoy being at work:

* Retention goes up
* Collaboration improves
* Culture becomes real (not posters on the wall)
* Office attendance increases without forcing anyone
* Feedback flows openly
* People feel less isolated

Bottom line:

**Kenyan offices don’t need more coffee machines.**  
**They need more community.**

And that’s what SOKI delivers.

1p6eh0s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1p6eh0s/dreamt_about_the_murder_of_my_best_friend_irl/,Dreamt about the murder of my best friend irl,"I am approaching the anniversary of my father's passing- he's been gone since 2019 and this time of year in general is rough for my family. The way in which he passed away was sudden and only after his death did I experience nightmares for the first time in my life. They mostly stopped after the first year and my dreams resumed ""normalcy."" I am not sure if that effects my subconscious in some way but the dreaming lately has been continuously disturbing and disrupting. 

  
Last night I dreamt that my ""best friend"" (in the dream he was my best friend but irl our family is close with each other and we've grown up together) but point is someone I know in my real life and inside the dream world I told everyone and felt strongly that he was my best friend. Basically we were all swimming in a body of water and someone else that we were swimming with tied some sort of rope around the neck of my friend really tight until his head went limp. It was so disturbing and upsetting. I felt like in the dream I couldn't do anything. It was late at night, the body of water was shifting- it was dark. I was apparently far away and then afterward I went to a coffee shop the next day and everyone inside was talking about it. I guess it was a big story in the local news. I ordered a cookie apparently and told the cashier that it was my best friend and started crying. I have no IDEA what this means but I woke up in sweats.

1p6ef1j,https://partisanmag.com/go-to-palestine/,Go to Palestine: A Report From the Ground,"> It is easy for me to imagine a version of the future where the Israeli settler colonial project has achieved its end goal. A future where only a few thousand Palestinians remain in Palestine. Some fled, others were killed. Israeli settlers have taken most of their homes. The Star of David is visible everywhere, but Keffiyehs and Palestinian flags are seen only in late-night comedy sketches or on effigies to be burned. The remaining Palestinians and Arabs are still subject to so-called “Military Law.” Their cars still have different license plates, and they still have water tanks on their roofs and generators in their homes. They face daily attacks and harassment. They too will be gone soon.

> In the West, we protested, we voted, we donated, we boycotted, we called our representatives, we ran candidates for elections, we fundraised, we unionized, we organized, we released dozens of statements, we even committed “criminal” acts of sabotage and disruption, and we did a hundred other things, but none of it was enough. The fall of Palestine signified the beginning of another historical epoch dominated by imperialism, colonialism, and white supremacy.

Answer the Call of History

> In October, I visited the West Bank along with my mother and dozens of internationals to assist with the annual olive harvest and provide a protective presence for the Palestinian farmers. In response, Israel arrested us, subjected us to torturous conditions in prison for 5 days, deported us, and banned us from Palestine for 99 years. 

> They made every effort to punish us for our act of solidarity and to make us regret it. They threw us into a boiling, roach-infested cell with no information about how long we would be there and no communication with the outside world. We ate their rotten food with our hands and drank their dirty water from leftover cups of hot yogurt. They all but ignored the massive abscess I had developed on my back, which burst one night, spraying shocking amounts of blood and pus all over the prison floor.
I would do it again without hesitation.

> For the past two years, we watched as 75 years of ethnic cleansing in Palestine culminated with the worst crime of the 21st Century. In the West, those of us who oppose Israel’s genocide in Gaza have undertaken a wide array of tactics in our efforts to stop it. Having participated in almost all of these tactics myself, it is clear to me now that there is one that is far more effective than any other and which strikes fear into the heart of the colonizer. 

> The West Bank is on the brink of its own catastrophe. The conditions that preceded the Gaza Genocide are present there to an even greater extent. The latest generation of settlers, the “Hilltop Youth,” is better armed and more violent than ever before. They are given free weapons and ATVs by Itamar Ben Gvir, the Israeli defense minister who idolizes the infamous mass murderer Baruch Goldstein. Their purpose is ethnic cleansing, and they have the full backing of the army and police, who appear to support them any time they attempt to clear the land of Palestinians. Unlike Gaza, the West Bank has no organized armed resistance. The situation is dire. To initiate another genocide, all the Israeli government needs to do is give the settlers and occupation forces the green light.
We in the West must answer the call of history. We must fulfill our responsibility to rectify our governments’ criminal support for Israeli occupation and genocide. We must go to Palestine in the thousands. If my 69-year old mom can do it, almost anybody can.

What We Experienced

> We made the crossing into Palestine from Jordan on a Monday. The border is, of course, controlled by the Israeli occupation. Getting through successfully required only a meager amount of preparation and dissembling. I told the soldiers that we were there for tourism; I was going to show my Christian mom the holy land. They searched my bags, asked to see my hotel reservation, then let us through. 
After two days of preparation, during which our hosts informed us of the latest developments in the area and what to expect from the settlers and the occupation, we began harvesting on Wednesday. The farmers wanted our first harvest day to pass without incident, so they took us to a location far from any road, where they knew that settlers were unlikely to attack. We collected thousands of olives successfully. I will never forget the generosity and friendliness of our Palestinian hosts, who always ensured that we were well fed and caffeinated. They shared whatever they could with us, and they constantly regaled us with personal stories that taught us about their history and culture, painting a clear picture of what life is like under Israeli occupation.

> Sadly, that was our final day of peace and freedom. The next morning, settlers appeared within 5 minutes of our harvest. The typical process unfolded from there: the settlers tried to initiate conflict and provoke violence. The first thing they attempted to do was rip the tarp full of olives out from under my feet; I was too heavy, and the tarp stayed put. They then tried to sic their dogs on us, but the treasonous dogs displayed more humanity than the settlers when they refused their orders and tried to befriend us instead.
We continued harvesting and recording the settlers until dozens of Israeli occupation soldiers appeared to support the settlers and forced us to flee to a different olive grove owned by the same farmer. We walked backward from the soldiers to our vehicles. The IOF behaves just like the NYPD at protests; the fact that they share training, equipment, and intelligence is evident. To remove us from the area they deployed tactics that I had become very familiar with after years of protesting in New York City.

> The same cat-and-mouse game unfolded there, after which we retreated to the farmer’s home, where he served us Arabic coffee in his beautiful garden. But the occupation forces were unsatisfied. They followed us to the farmer’s home, and confronted us with the same spurious pretext that they frequently use to clear Palestinian land of Palestinians–they showed us a map and told us that we were in a “closed military zone.”

> They demanded to see our passports. Unlike Palestinians, who are subject to “Military Law,” Internationals in Palestine are subject to “Civilian Law,” under which we have no obligation to show the military our passports, so we refused. They called the police, who forcibly took our passports and told us that we were not under arrest and that they were going to escort us out of the military zone. This began a weeklong series of Kafkaesque events replete with lies, abuses, and violations of the law, which culminated with our 5-day incarceration at Givon prison.

> The entirety of our detention was characterized by our captors walking the line between attempting to immiserate us to the greatest possible extent without causing any major international incident. For example, when the abscess on my back finally burst and became an open wound, I was denied treatment until I mentioned the possibility of infection. It was only then, motivated by the fear of an American dying in their custody, that the guards allowed me to receive medical care.

> This tightrope act demonstrates the efficacy of the protective presence program. I admit that I arrived in Palestine with skepticism. I thought that our presence there might not make much of a difference for the Palestinians and that the Israelis would be just as violent and aggressive whether we were there or not. That view is incorrect. 

> The presence of internationals, especially white Westerners, deters Israeli violence. It slows the ethnic cleansing of the Palestinians. It was clear to me that every Israeli responsible for detaining us wanted to abuse us to a greater extent than they did, but they had to refrain from doing so. The same dynamic was evident in the fields. In one instance, a shoving match broke out between the Palestinian farmer and a settler. Had we not been present and recording the encounter, the farmer would have certainly been attacked, imprisoned, or killed. In fact, after our arrest, the Israeli Occupation Forces (IOF) kidnapped, blindfolded, and badly beat one of our guides twice in two days. They broke his nose and dislocated his shoulder. Had we been there recording, they would not have committed such violence.

> To me, the confirmation of the efficacy of our presence there gives us Westerners a special mandate. Our own governments, especially the United States, aid and abet the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians with our tax dollars. We therefore have a responsibility to rectify this. Thousands of us have attempted to do so with various tactics, none of which have been sufficiently effective. 

> It is time to escalate. We must take our solidarity to the next level, and we must do so in the thousands. Engage in the most effective tactic. Go to Palestine.

> Yes, it is easy for me to imagine a version of the future where the Israeli settler colonial project has achieved its end goal. I can also clearly see a version of the future where the Israeli settler colonial project has completely failed. The millions of displaced Palestinians were able to return to their ancestral lands. The Palestinians have sovereignty over their water, electricity, food, and borders. They drive on whatever roads they please without passing through any checkpoints. Their farmers labor freely and peacefully. Their workers pay taxes to a government that actually represents them. When they leave Palestine, they know they will be able to return. Children play in the street as loudly and freely as they please. Families are reunited. Palestine is free.

> Those of us in the West allowed ourselves to hear the call of history, and we answered it. Our efforts rose to meet the moment, and we practiced a form of solidarity that directly advanced the liberation struggle. We also brought the Palestinian struggle home with us, and we therefore advanced our own struggles in our home countries, because the two are intrinsically connected through a shared history of imperialism and settler colonialism. We learned, for example, how to resist military occupation. We learned how to organize ourselves to sustain and perpetuate the life and livelihood of our own occupied communities. We learned from the Palestinians what it really means to resist, and we learned what real solidarity is.

1p6ee9i,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1p6ee9i/son_doesnt_play_well_with_cousins_wife_keeps/,Son doesn't play well with cousins; wife keeps bringing them together,"I'm 37 my wife is 36. Our son turns 3 in 5 weeks, we are having another boy expected due date in 4 weeks.  My wife comes from an enmeshed family. She has 3 sisters all married with kids. When our son was first born, her family started a terrible fight with us that eventually caused us to go NC with the family until our son was nearly 2 years old. The fight was over her family over stepping boundaries and not respecting our wishes to limit visitors when our early born underweight new baby first came home from the NICU. 

My wife's older sister and the husband were the ones leading the charge in this fight. They are awful deadbeat parents. CPS made multiple visits to their home. They have 3 kids, all with behavioral issues, and unfortunately the other kids in the family have behavioral problems from them. 

After we came back in the picture with the family, I noticed my son and his cousins (my son is turning 3 soon, his toddler cousins in question here are 3 1/2 years old and 1 is just over 4 years old) NEVER play nice together. The family tries to normalize it as a phase or boys just playing rough, but I think this is excessive. There is NEVER a single moment, EVER, of them playing nice. It's always CONSTANT fighting, CONSTANT, not sharing. An event with my wife's family is CONSTANT breaking up toddlers fighting and pulling toys away that they are fighting over. When we were NC with the family,.my son ALWAYS played nice with other kids (he is around a lot of kids outside the family as we have a lot of friends with kids) . After we got back with wife's family, I noticed now my son hits, and sometimes doesn't play as nice with other kids himself now, because his cousins were always hitting my son and antagonizing him until eventually my son learned to start hitting them and be aggressive back, and now unfortunately he does this sometimes with other kids. 

My son plays much better with other kids .SOMETIMES he doesn't play nice with other kids, but it's not constant. With his cousins though it's CONSTANT never ending fighting, they are always fighting with each other as well. 

Last week my mother in law got hurt breaking up my 2 nephews fighting she fell over a coffee table. 1 of my nephews is always scratching and the other kids have scratches on their face. 

Last week I went to work an overnight, and my wife had 1 of my SILs over with her kids. This SIL invited herself over under the excuse her son (age 3.5) was asking to see my son, but her husband was working overnight as well, and my MIL was supposed to come over and help my pregnant wife. This SIL imo just didn't want to be home alone with her 3.5 and 6 month old, as she can never seem to handle 2 kids by herself she always needs my MIL to come over and help her , and since MIL was coming to us (a rare time , as we barely get any help) she didn't want to be left out. I came home from work my son had 6 scratches on his face and 1 behind his ear. Her family will try to normalize this but IMO that's not normal and I told my wife this better stop. 

My nephew who is 3.5 doesn't speak yet (my son speaks knows to count and the alphabet) and is in behavioral therapy and has been, and it's not working at all for him because she stupidly brings him around the trashy sister and her kids all the time which imo supercedes anything a therapist is trying to show him over the limited office time. 

After this visit this SIL, had the nerve to tell my wife our son needs behavioral therapy. 

My wife is desensitized to this cause it's her enmeshed family. But I don't like it. I don't like how I see my sons behavior is getting worse every time he is around them and the days after. And I don't like seeing my son's face scratched up. I'm not saying my son is always perfect, but he never leaves marks on other kids. 

I'm not trying to fight with her family again, because it was tough coming back from what they did the first time, and the next fight with them I will be done with them for good (her family has a lot of toxic traits including the trashy sister and brother in law who were investigated by CPS, have been sued numerous times, and are always moving from apartment to apartment , and the family tries to defend them every time they fight with us ) . 

We live in NY. I keep telling my wife we need to limit my son's time around them to holidays and birthdays and less in between because being around them is doing more harm than good for our son. My wife will agree with me but then continue this. I'm pissed at my wife, her sister, and my Mil, the adults that were present last time my son was with nephew, because how the fuck does he get so many scratches on his face?! Common sense you end the visit early if that happens , but no, stupidly, my wife will separate them and then 2 min later let them play again thinking they will magically nice together then have to break them up again. 

Just looking for advice. Because my wife's family tries to normalize this. I think it's 100% normal kids don't want to share and fight, but I don't think it's normal when that happens, without fail, 100% of the time. The only time they play nice together is when we permanently separate them and say you play in this room you play in that room . ",1,1764082288.0,Marriage,0,1.0,False

I’m early thirties with a young child, no friends, and struggling to put myself out there.

1.) I met a woman at toddler group. over a year ago. We chat for the entire hour each week. We contribute equally to the chat and she appears to enjoy it, going beyond small talk. After a few months, I suggested meeting up outside of the group; she seemed keen. We swapped numbers. I invited her to an event which she declined apologetically but didn’t suggest another date. She was still friendly each week and about six months later I tried again but she declined.

We're still just as friendly each week at group. I’ve learned a lot about her life and family, yet I am guessing she wouldn’t see me as a friend. Is this normal? I get that not everyone is looking for new friends, but always read advice to meet people at groups, and I never go beyond acquaintances.

2.) I attend a hobby group weekly with some familiar faces. We have a great time and message in a group chat between sessions. I live near one woman who suggested the two of us get coffee but we had to schedule weeks in advance due to our schedules. She suddenly went extremely quiet, contributing less in group chats and never responded to my most recent message

She acted completely normal every week at hobby group but just never responded. I started getting anxious as the date got closer,  worried about the possibility she'd still expect me to turn up. So I made an excuse and asked to reschedule. This was ignored and the date passed without acknowledgement. Suddenly, she reappeared, with a detailed message responding to something we'd been speaking about ages ago, and apologising for her silence lately, saying it’s about her, not me.

3.) I met a friend Jane through mutual friend Sarah. Sarah moved away but Jane and I still met every few months. Jane and I had babies at the same time and became closer. She drifted a bit, messaging less and avoiding meeting, but we had toddlers by then so I assumed she was busy.

Then she held an annual event that I was always previously invited to but this year I wasn't. Sarah came back into town and scheduled meeting me and seemed excited, but after attending Jane's event, Sarah cancelled on me and hasn't spoken to me since. This made me think whatever I'd done must have been spoken about and deemed bad enough that it made both want to cut me off.

Then Jane suddenly reached out again wanting to meet, suggesting dates. We met but it felt distant and awkward and I felt I was having to do all the work conversationally. That night, she messaged saying how much fun she had. The message seemed more than just politeness as she referenced something from during the day, saying she'd been laughing about it all day. I didn't hear from her for a while and this week she's been liking my pictures on social media, which she stopped doing for a while.

I'm doubting my perception of everything. I want to learn to take the hint or match someone's energy but I find other people's behaviour confusing and unpredictable. I'm definitely not being accidentally blunt. I'm very passive and people-pleasing.",1,1764082119.0,AutismInWomen,1,1.0,False

We’ve gone on 4 great dates and have amazing, effortless conversations. She hinted she won’t confess first. I’ve never been in a relationship, and now I’m overthinking whether I’m ready, if 2 months is too soon, or if I’m just scared. Need advice.

Hey everyone,
I (22M) have been talking to this girl (22F) I met on a dating app about 2 months ago, and I could really use some perspective.

From day one, our conversations just clicked. We weren’t doing the usual small talk we talked about real things, shared personal stuff, and always found things in common. She was travelling home during Diwali, so we ended up chatting online for almost a month and it never felt forced at all.

In the last 2 months on the app, I’ve had quite a few matches (around 30-ish), and I’ve been on dates with 4–5 other people before her but with them, things never went past the first date. She’s the only one I actually went on a second date with, and that itself kind of surprised me because the vibe was totally different and way more natural.

We’ve been on four dates so far, and each one lasted almost the whole day talking, eating, coffee, just being around each other. I’ve even been to her place to watch a movie. We’re very open with each other, and the connection feels effortless.

Now my confusion:

I’ve never been in a relationship before, so I don’t really know how to tell when it’s the right time to take the next step. She hinted once that she wouldn’t confess first because she doesn’t have the confidence, so if something is going to move forward, it’s basically on me to say it.

But I’m overthinking a lot 
• How do I know if I’m ready for a relationship?
• Is 2 months too early to decide?
• What if I commit too soon and later feel like I could’ve met someone “better”?
• Or am I just sabotaging something good because of fear and inexperience, especially in today’s world where cheating and dating apps make everything feel uncertain?

I like her, I’m comfortable with her, and the connection is great but I’m confused about what the right move is.

I've tried to do some research and the three I've listed above seem like my best bets, but its so hard to know. so im looking for some advice from people who have experience with c.£100 hand grinders. (If you use something other than listed above at around the £100 mark which you think is better, please let me know!)

​I exclusively drink filter, and whilst i normally use v60 or clever, i will be mainly using aeropress with this handgrinder because I find it easier to travel with aeropress. I drink mainly light roasts but do also drink light-ish and medium. Have recently been enjoying Colombian and Kenyan coffees. At home I grind with fellow ode gen 1 with stock burrs.

Some brief context about me and current set-up:
Machine - Bambino plus
Grinder - Kingrinder k6
I use a bottomless portafilter with a screen, tamper is the stock one that came with the Bambino, and I have been using this set-up with no complaints and great enjoyment for just about 3 years. Generally make 1-3 cups of coffee on my days off work, going between americanos and milk based drinks (I like a weird 1:3 ratio which tbh I'm not sure which drink that defines as). As far as the beans, I love them all, I buy from a lovely Canadian roaster called  Detour that sells tasting packs so I usually buy once a year around this time and I'll work my way through them all, usually light to medium roasts. I will say that although I do enjoy the dialing in experience, I'm also not SUPER snobby about finding that ""god cup"" per se. With my current setup, I generally put in 19g, pull about 40g out over 30s, and that seems to be the sweet spot for most of the beans I use. I've really had no complaints at all as every cup I've had at home absolutely murders every coffee I've ever bought outside of it.

I've been thinking of upgrading my grinder and I was hoping for some suggestions to further develop my drinking experience. As far as manual goes, I've been looking at the J-Ultra vs K-Ultra, and as far as electric goes, the Vario VS3 seems a great option as well. I really hope to make this next grinder I buy almost the ""buy it for life"" one, so I don't mind spending a little bit more to really get a good choice. A lot of the reviews I've been finding of the aforementioned choices are a year or two old now so I was wondering if there is any new information out there. 

Thank you for your time and happy brewing! ",1,1764081742.0,espresso,6,1.0,False

I didn’t sleep the night after seeing that shadow in Mrs. Hancock’s room.

And it wasn’t because of fear.

Or… fine, yes, it *was* fear, but twisted together with something else: that crawling itch I’d missed a clinical detail, I didn’t pay attention to the *right* cues. There had to be a neurological, measurable, chartable reason for what I saw. Something I could pin to a whiteboard and label until it stopped feeling like a threat.

So after tossing and turning for hours, I decided to get up. It was around 3:30 in the morning. I grabbed my laptop (the repair shop said it was fine?), curled under a blanket on my couch, and started searching, trying to find anything I could to explain what Mrs. Hancock saw… what I saw…

>

All very reasonable. All tidy little boxes with symptoms and causes and decision trees. Comforting in their sterile little ways.

I mean, there had to be a neurological explanation. There *had* to be.

I took a break, put on the 1982 version of *The Thing*, grabbed a snack (nightshift nursing screws with every circadian thing about you). I was starting to relax, to drift off, to feel like I could shake the strangeness from the last few days.

Then the thing with the corner of my living room happened.

It started small, a heaviness settling just outside my vision. Like the air thickened, gravity flexed. I kept staring at my screen, refusing to acknowledge the feeling that something was forming in the dark beyond me.

You know how usually when you look at a shadow or something that doesn’t quite make sense, your brain corrects it, smooths it back into nothing? It becomes an analogy machine, normalizing what’s in front of you.

That didn’t happen.

Instead, the shadow tightened into shape.

I froze, hand hovering over the remote. My breath stalled halfway up my throat. I stared straight ahead because looking at it directly felt like stepping into a trap.

I closed my eyes, shook my head, and mentally reset. *This isn’t real, I’m just really fucking tired*… When I finally turned my gaze back to the corner, it was empty.

But an afterimage burned behind my eyes, the way light burns when you look too close at a bulb.

“I’m awake,” I said out loud, like an idiot. “Hallucinations don’t follow the awake brain.” I laughed at myself, almost believed myself.

Until the tremors started.

*21:40:40 - 10/25/2018*

Damn. I needed to take a break, I started to freak myself out — decided to throw on an episode of *Creeping&Casting*, a podcast that always makes me laugh. Sure, the subject matter of paranormal phenomenon or local cryptids could be spooky, but the hosts always add some laughs. I ended up passing out, and next thing I knew, it was time to be back at ol’ Insane-shits. I just finished my rounds.

Anyway, back to the tremors.

They began as a tiny shake in my fingers, the kind people get when they’re on the verge of a panic attack. The weird thing is, the shaking got worse with intentional movement. Worse when I tried to *stop* it. That isn’t how anxiety tremors act.

I went into “nurse brain” mode: I checked my blood sugar (normal). My meds (unchanged). My caffeine intake (moderate for a nightshift nurse, meaning “concerning” for anyone else).

Nothing explained it.

Tonight, while I was rechecking Mrs. Hancock’s vitals, she looked at my hands and frowned.

“You’re seeing him too often now,” she murmured.

My stomach dropped. “What does that mean?”

Her gaze drifted to my trembling fingers. “That shaking. It starts when he gets close, doesn’t it?”

I swallowed. “I’m just tired, Mrs. Hancock. It’s been a long week for me.”

“No no,” she whispered. “I know tired. I see it in auras. I promise you’re not as tired as you believe. In all truths,” she smiled that practiced, plastic gummy smile, “you’re thinning.”

*01:17:27 - 10/27/2018*

Mrs. Hancock had another episode. Same pattern as before — her eyes tracking something that wasn’t visible to me, her breath snagging in her chest, her voice thin and shaking like she was trying to talk through cold water.

Her vitals were fine. *Fine.*

Every number insisted she was stable. Every number insisted nothing was wrong.

I refuse to believe the numbers.

Because she kept saying he wasn’t watching *her* tonight… He was watching *me.*

Now, I know what stress and sleep deprivation can do to perception. I’ve watched people swear their dead childhood best friends were sitting at the foot of their beds after three days without real sleep.

I keep trying to chalk all of this up to suggestibility — the way the mind absorbs fear when it’s already primed for it. I’ve been doing too many doubles, living on vending-machine food and adrenaline. My circadian rhythm is so mangled it’s basically jazz. I’ve slept maybe nine hours in three days, and half of that wasn’t even sleep — more like a shallow, dreamless float that didn’t touch the part of my brain that actually needs rest.

Exhausted brains do strange, vivid things. I regularly see that with my patients.

But the tremors are worse… my hands won’t stop shaking, feeling like something is humming under my skin, vibrating in bone instead of muscle.

If it keeps up, I’ll go to urgent care.  
I’ll ask for a neuro exam — rule out B₁₂ deficiency, early MS, essential tremor, migraine aura, anything. Anything with a lab value or a diagnostic code. Anything that isn’t… whatever this is turning into.

I’m exhausted and need to finish all of my charting. I’ll write again tomorrow.

*03:33:30 - 10/27/2018*

*remember the order of things*

*21:30:00 - 10/27/2018*

Okay.  
So… something’s off.

I logged in and saw a random entry — “remember the order of things.” I didn’t write it. I know I didn’t. The formatting isn’t mine, the tone isn’t mine, and the whole thing reads like someone trying to leave instructions… or a warning.

I’m telling myself the document must’ve autosaved some garbage draft when the computer did its nightly update. Or maybe I opened the page half-coherent and typed something weird without realizing.

But still.

It doesn’t sound like me. Hell, there’s not even punctuation.

I’ll delete it later. I currently lack the desire.

Mrs. Hancock was calmer tonight. When I checked her pulse, she grabbed my wrist, gently, almost reassuring, and said, “You look thinner.”

I asked what she meant.

She said, “Between worlds. You’re slipping between them.”

*02:19:19 - 10/28/2018*

Couldn’t sleep. Again.

Every time I tried closing my eyes, he was there — standing in the corner of my room. That tall silhouette. That hat. That awful stillness. My brain kept mumbling about hypnagogia, those half-asleep shadow glitches you get when you’re overtired, but even that explanation felt tired. Like my mind was running out of excuses.

And when I finally turned on a light, the shadow didn’t disappear right away.

A shadow should vanish instantly.

Instead, it hesitated, as if it were annoyed by the sudden bright interruption.

I’ve noticed a pattern now. Events keep happening the same way:

1. First the cold
2. Then the tremors
3. Then the shape

My stomach is a mess tonight. Too much stress, too much coffee, too much work. It might be gastritis, it might be reflux, it might be that I subsisted solely on granola bars and vending machine sodas. I’ll grab antacids in the morning. If I remember.

I’m so tired. Tired in a way sleep doesn’t fix.

I’m trying — genuinely trying — to stay logical, stay grounded, stay in the world where everything has a clinical explanation.

But every time the lights dim, I feel myself slipping.

*22:07:47 - 10/28/2018*

Something’s wrong with this journal file.

When I opened it tonight on the old work computer tonight, half of my earlier entry was missing. Not corrupted, *missing*. Cleanly carved out, like someone highlighted whole sections and just… erased them. The part about the cold spot and the paragraph about the shadow becoming more defined — gone. Completely gone.

And the *remember the order of things* line?

More of them.

Three this time…

All dropped between paragraphs I know I wrote.

I deleted them.

Then I checked the file’s history. This isn’t a web app, just a free, standalone typing program, something too simplistic to have cloud sync or fancy features. But it still tracks basic things: last opened, last modified, which device made the edits.

According to the data, the file was opened at 3:33 in the morning.

Which makes no sense, because I was… here. On shift. Using the work computer. Logged in under my name, watching the seconds crawl by while I documented patient care.

Could it be a glitch? A timestamp error? Some weird file recovery thing?

Maybe.

But the edits weren’t random.  
They were specific, targeted.

The parts about the cold.  
The parts about the shadow.  
The parts where I sounded scared.

Deleted.

And those lines —  
*remember the order of things*  
*remember the order*  
*remember*

I’ll change my password in the morning.

*01:26:19 - 10/29/2018*

Mrs. Hancock had a bad night last night. The worst since I’ve known her.

She tried to get out of bed (which shouldn’t even be physically possible). Her legs don’t bear weight. Her trunk strength is basically gone. She hasn’t stood, not even with assistance, in years.

But the alarms didn’t go off. When I checked the panel afterward, every indicator was green. Fully functional. Like nothing had happened. Every safeguard we have in place for when confused residents fall was in true, working order.

When I found her, she kept whispering the same thing over and over:

“He’s closer now. He likes to stand behind you.”

And the awful part is — I *felt* someone behind me.

That same thick, cold pressure.

But when I turned around?

Just the wall. Just the useless vent humming warm air. Just the empty corner I’ve been insisting to myself is empty.

My tremors are worse tonight. Worse than I want to admit. When I tried to document some vitals, the pen shook so hard the numbers looked like a seismograph. I botched a med calculation — basic math, something I could do half-dead after a double. My brain stalled for fifteen full seconds, blank as a rebooting monitor.

That’s not just sleep deprivation. That’s not “working too many nights in a row.” Something is *wrong*.

My coworkers kept watching me like I was about to drop. One told me I’d “gone gray around the gills.” Another offered to walk me to the bathroom “in case I met Jesus on the way.”

I joked it off, but I didn’t feel steady. My depth perception is off. Straight hallways feel like they’re tilting. My right ear keeps popping, like I’m changing altitude even when I’m standing still. And my skin… my skin feels thinner than it should.

Like the boundary between me and the world is wearing down.

*23:07:13 - 10/29/2018*

Insomnia again.

I keep hearing footsteps in my hallway. Heavy ones. Slow. Pacing, like someone trying to decide which direction to go. I checked twice — nothing there, just my empty apartment breathing in that weird uneven way it does at night. But the sound was real. I know the weight of real footsteps.

I tried distracting myself by rereading some of my recent entries.

Huge mistake.

There’s another entry sitting in the file now. Not the “order of things” line — a different one. Short. Clean. Centered on its own line like it wanted to be noticed:

>

That’s it.  
No timestamp.  
No misplaced keystrokes.  
No hesitation in the phrasing.

I didn’t write it.  
I *know* I didn’t.  
I would put my license, my job, my sanity on the line for that.

I ran a malware scan: nothing. No suspicious activity. No sign that anyone touched the file but me.

And yet that sentence just… exists now. Like it sprouted in the blank spaces between the words.

Or, it did until I erased it.

My chest is tight. Not panic-tight, more like pressure-tight; like the air is weighing more than it should. I feel feverish, but my temperature is fine. My hearing keeps dipping, softening around the edges, like someone is cupping their hands over my ears and then taking them away again.

I’m going to try to sleep. Or at least lie still with my eyes closed and pretend that counts. Tomorrow is my first of five night shifts in a row. After, I actually have a little trip booked to Tallulah Falls to get the hell out of this nightmarish state.

I know I can do anything for a few nights.

*02:22:27 - 10/30/2018*

I wasn’t going to write tonight.

My hands won’t stop their little subdermal buzzing, and my head feels stuffed with cotton soaked in static. Every blink feels like dragging my eyelids through wet sand. But too much happened, and if I don’t get it down, I’m afraid I’ll start losing the order of things.

That phrase keeps looping in my mind.  
*The order of things.*

So.

Before anything slips…

Mrs. Hancock is gone.

The paramedics took her out around midnight.

One minute she was alert enough to complain that the tea “tasted like swamp water steeped in sin,” and the next she was spiraling — fever blooming out of nowhere, pulse racing so fast the telemetry lagged behind reality, oxygen plummeting like someone had pulled a plug in the middle of her chest.

I’ve seen strokes. I’ve seen sepsis. I’ve seen the body fold in on itself in a hundred tragic ways.

This wasn’t any of those.

This felt… wrong. Clinically wrong. Physically wrong. Wrong in a way no charting language exists for.

When they wheeled her toward the elevator, she grabbed my sleeve. Hard. Stronger than she has *ever* been. Her fingers were cold and stiff, like marble pulled from deep earth. She pulled me close, the way people do when they’re whispering a secret meant to outlive them:

“Don’t let him walk you home.”

I can’t stop hearing it, can’t stop replaying the exact rasp of her voice…

Over the last two days, the “symptoms” I’ve been experiencing have changed.

The tremors have a rhythm now. A pulse. Like they’re syncing to something in the room when I’m alone. A heartbeat I don’t recognize.

And earlier tonight, I made the mistake of looking at myself in the bathroom mirror.

For a full second — maybe two — I didn’t recognize the woman staring back.

My face looked too tight in some places and too hollow in others, like someone had lightly reshaped the features but hadn’t bothered blending the edges. The dark shadows under my eyes weren’t helped by makeup. The paleness that settled wasn’t due to exhaustion.

I touched my cheekbone and felt the strangest disconnect, like the shape under my fingers didn’t match the shape in the glass.

Then I blinked, and the moment snapped back. Mostly.

And my apartment? It feels off. Not dangerous. Not even hostile.

Just… occupied. Like something else is sharing the air with me, standing just outside the edge of the lamplight.

The corner by my bedroom door keeps tugging at my attention. But, every time I look straight at it — nothing. Just a regular shadow, too deep for the wattage of the bulb.

But when I look indirectly, when it’s just at the edge of my vision…

I *sense* pressure there.  
A dense weight, air with mass.  
Like someone inhaling very quietly, trying not to draw notice.

I just need to get through these shifts.

One shift. Then the next few will flow like water.

Then vacation… I’ll sleep for a week. Eat something real. Pretend none of this ever happened.

I’ll update again tonight… I’m hoping Mrs. Hancock is back by then, this place really is a lot darker without her.

PRESENT DAY

I don’t know why I thought having the journal printed on paper would make anything clearer or more meaningful... Maybe it just felt safer than staring at the screen — like ink might last longer or explain more clearly than that flash drive.

When the printer finished, the stack came out warm, normal. Except for the last page. It felt… heavier when I lifted it? Heavier than paper should be.

At first glance, I thought the formatting was off. The final line, the one I *know* was centered at the bottom of Jacobi’s last entry wasn’t centered anymore. It had slid to the left. Barely. Just enough to register.

I checked the digital document.  
Still centered. Perfectly aligned.

I printed the last page again.

This time the sentence moved further left and dropped down, almost brushing the margin. Like it was inching its way toward the edge.

I tried one more copy. The line moved further.

The digital file hasn’t changed — not a single pixel. But with every printout, the sentence slides further left, and lower, as if gravity is different on the page than in the file.

I put the pages in a drawer and shut it harder than I meant to. Still, I keep glancing at it. The way you check a locked door long after you’ve tested the knob.

I’m going to return the flash drive. Put it back exactly where I found it.  
Someone else can archive this. Someone else can figure out whatever “order” she kept writing about.

Before I closed the drawer for the last time, I looked at the final printed page — just once — and for a split second, when I looked up from the paper, I saw it.

A shape.

Tall. Straight. Blurred at the edges like a shadow trying to decide whether it belongs to something solid.

By the time I blinked, it was gone.

I’m telling myself it’s nothing, it’s just nerves, too many hours reading someone else’s unraveling. But I heard something a minute ago.

\*Shades of Coffee 9 bar spring (and other springs)

The administration had shut it down since COVID, locking it tight and leaving it to stew in its own stale air for years. Now that census is creeping up again, the bigwigs upstairs want it polished and presentable before the cleaning crew comes through — “a soft relaunch,” as if the floor is some kind of restaurant and not a wing that saw more death than discharge.

My job was simple: go through the abandoned desks and cabinets, make sure nothing confidential got left behind. No patient files, no medication lists, no scraps of paperwork that could get the facility in trouble. Mostly it was dust, outdated pamphlets, and pens that had long since dried up. The kind of tedious work they hand to whoever isn’t quick enough to duck behind a med cart when a supervisor walks by.

That’s when I found the flash drive — in the bottom drawer, tucked behind a stack of old forms. Nothing special, just one of those encrypted USBs IT hands out when they don’t trust staff to email themselves documents like normal people. I figured it was leftover junk, destined for the shred bin. But protocol is protocol, so instead of tossing it, I checked it.

My work laptop wouldn’t recognize it. Not even a flicker. The old all-in-one PC in the back room, though — the one nobody uses unless they’re desperate—picked it up instantly. A little drive icon blinked onto the screen like it had been waiting for someone patient enough to try.

Most of the folders were exactly what I expected: “2018 Certs,” “St. Iggy SOPs,” “BLANK Care Plans,” a graveyard of administrative clutter. But tucked between the work files was a single outlier, named simply: **“Personal.”** Capital P. Like the unnamed flash drive, it gave no hints.

When I opened it, I didn’t find photos or receipts or someone’s half-finished resignation letter. Instead, there were journal entries written by an RN named Jacobi, who worked here about five years ago.

I’ll be honest — what she wrote got under my skin. Not in a Damien Leone horror flick way, just… a cold little shiver that hung around longer than it should have. Maybe that was her intention. From what I read in this file, I’m not sure I’d *want* to know what her intention was. Hard to say with things like these.

But because the damn USB won’t work in my laptop, I’ve got it plugged into the old computer. I’m typing this up on my laptop while I read off that flickering monitor, copying every line exactly as it shows up on the drive. No edits, no polish, nothing added or cut. Just her words, kept alive in a place where they won’t vanish with the rest of the forgotten junk in that desk drawer.

Throwing it away didn’t feel right. Erasing it felt worse. So I’m putting it here, untouched.

Whatever anyone makes of it after this… well, that’s not on me.

# PART 2 - The Journal

*04:17:27 - 10/20/2018*

I used to be good at this. Journaling, I mean. I’ve filled notebooks since middle school- cheap spiral ones with crooked wire spines, leather ones I bought when I was trying to “take myself seriously,” even a bright pink Lisa Frank diary at one point, because apparently I peaked early. Somewhere along the way — work, life, all the usual shit — I just… stopped. Or, I didn’t stop so much as drifted away from it, like everything else when you’re tired for long enough.

My therapist says the act of writing things down helps “regulate the nervous system” and I’m trying. You see, I think you get to a certain age and everything starts living like you’re walking around underwater, and all you’re trying to do is make sense of the shapes moving past you and make sense of yourself moving past shapes.

Journaling’s supposed to help with that. Untangle things. Keep the dark from smearing into the everyday.

So. Here I am again, typing into an online journal in the middle of the night at work because I promised I’d try. Besides, the night shift does funny things to you if you don’t find somewhere to put the overflow. It’s quiet in a way that isn’t restful. You start hearing thoughts that don’t sound like they came from you.

Since this is going to be a new blog, I guess I should introduce myself: my name’s Jacobi, and I’m a certified registered nurse at St. Ignatius, or as I like to refer to it, St. Insane-shits. I work the locked unit at night, so yeah — I’m very well-centered.

I’ve been here for three years. Started as an aide — wiping mouths, cleaning up God-knows-what from God-knows-where, changing beds that never stay dry, scrubbing every crevice the Florida heat could make worse. If you’ve ever worked in a locked unit down here in August, you know what I mean. Everything sweats. Even the walls, like they’re breathing warm on the back of your neck. My scrubs were so soaked by sunrise, I could’ve entered them in a wet-T-shirt contest and probably placed.

Not glamorous, but it’s been steady. Predictable. Comforting, in the same way a bruise is: you get used to checking it every few hours just to see if it’s gotten worse, if the colors have changed, bled.

When I graduated this past August, I told my boss I’d passed my boards. I was expecting, bare minimum, a “congratulations” or a nod. Something human.

Instead, he looked at me the way people stare at a busted AC unit: mildly offended it dared to break on *their* shift. Then, he trudged into the office without a word. I figured maybe he was grabbing paperwork. Or a surprise muffin. Something.

Nope.

He returned with a still-warm stack of printer paper, half crooked, and dropped it on the counter like he was delivering a verdict.

“Test,” he said. “Take it. Don’t miss anything important.”

Which would’ve been fine if the test weren’t clearly put together by someone half-asleep and possibly concussed. Half the questions had typos so bad they changed the meaning entirely. One asked about a medication discontinued in the 1980s. Another simply said: *Explain vitals.* No punctuation. No specifics. Just a vague philosophical dare.

I filled it out anyway — because you don’t argue with a man who keeps his coffee in a thermos the color of nicotine stains.

When I handed it back, he didn’t read a word. Not one. He glanced at the paper as if it were an aggressive coupon, nodded once, and grunted a noise that, I guess, counted as approval. Then he fished the narcotics keys from his pocket, slapped them into my hand, and wrote “RN” on my badge with a half-dead Sharpie. Like he was tagging livestock.

My first week as a “real nurse,” I had a patient hurl his dentures at me because he said they were “possessed by a little man who won’t shut the hell up.” Another resident crawled under her bed and refused to come out until someone “sent the gators home.” And on day six, right after I’d spent thirty minutes wiping feces off a bedrail someone had managed to fingerpaint, a thunderstorm blew out the AC. Having twenty confused, overheated elders trapped on a locked floor in August is something I wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy. The scent alone could knock the sin out of a preacher.

Still… I stayed.

Maybe because I’m stubborn. Maybe because I’m broke. Maybe because, in some weird way, I care about these people. Even when they’re throwing things or screaming or asking if I’m their third wife come back from the dead. Working night shift on a locked unit does strange things to your heart. Makes you soft in places you didn’t know could go soft.

Well, that’s me. I can hear Mr. Murdoch screaming, so I know it’s close to 5:30am… you can set your watch by that man. I’ll pick this up later or during my shift tonight.

*23:04:57 - 10/20/2018*

I feel better after writing last shift, even though it was just to myself in this stupid text file. For continuity, I guess I should explain where I work so some of my rants will make sense. This is supposed to be cathartic, after all (I wish I could eye-roll here).

The six-story building sits on a rise that barely qualifies as a hill — more like the land got tired halfway through standing up. Because of that half-hearted lift, the first floor feels sunk into the ground, as if the earth has started reclaiming it one humid inch at a time. From the outside, it looks every bit its age: a 1940s southern block relic gone soft at the edges, its concrete pitted and sun-bleached, streaked with rust and the dark bloom of mildew. Kudzu fingers up the walls where the groundskeeper keeps losing the fight, and palmettos crowd close, their fronds rasping in the heat like they’re whispering about what the building’s seen. Years of sideways rain swells the window frames, buckling their corners. The roofline sags just enough to catch fallen pine needles and oak leaves, which rot into a thick, sour-smelling mulch. Even the air around it feels heavy, like the exasperated sigh of an angry loved one.

Inside, nothing ever really dries. Moisture beads on the walls, and the ceilings drip when the AC fails. The floors go tacky in patches even after a fresh mop— your shoes make faint kissing sounds on the tile as if the building itself is reluctant to let you go. Dehumidifiers hum down every hallway, buzzing like trapped beetles, yet the damp still wins. When storms roll in, water sluices down the slope and collects at the back entrance, turning the concrete dark and cold, releasing that smell of wet limestone and something older underneath. The stains and spots and peeling paint cover all six stories of this place.

The first floor is its own little swamp: the facility laundry room, the kitchen, staff lockers — all pressed together in a low corridor where the air hangs thick enough to touch. The lights don’t just flicker; they stammer to life, blinking like they’re fighting their way through root-laden brackish water. The air vents release plumes that smell like standing water and old fabric softener cooked too long in the heat. Beneath it all is that sharp, metallic ghost-note of mold, the kind that settles in your sinuses no matter how shallowly you’ve learned to breathe. Sometimes it hits you with a whiff of something worse — a drowned, organic and putrefied sweetness that makes your stomach turn.

Up one level, the main floor is actually the second floor, which opens frailly onto the main drive — a stretch of cracked asphalt split open wide enough for weeds and palmetto shoots to claw through, and beset with more potholes than residents. Ceiling fans spin overhead in slow, tired loops, pushing the heat around like a prodded stubborn steer. Visitors arrive already sweated through, fanning themselves with clipboards or pocket books while sunscreen and perfume curdle in the humidity. The entire floor smells like an ode to sunbaked pavement, cheap deodorant fighting its last stand, and the faint ammonia tang of spilled disinfectant drying on tile. Even on cooler, cloudy days, the asphalt outside glistens with a damp sheen, as if the ground sweats too, bleeding moisture into the air.

Above the gala, as I call it, come the medical floors — four of them, three medical and one locked psychiatric — stacked like tired vertebrae. Up here, the air sits heavier, quieter, expectant. The halls bowed ever so slightly where the terrazzo tile met the wooden baseboards, ballooned and marred by decades of storms, leaks, and neglect that no paint could ever hide. Something in the building always seems to be expanding, settling, adjusting itself: soft groans in the walls, a creak at the far end of the hall, a whisper of shifting weight overhead.

The smells come off differently here, too. A penetrating blend of antiseptic and nitrile gloves. Stale linens and unwashed bodies. The briny, putrid stench of bedpans wheeled a little too slowly to the dirty utility room. Somewhere deeper, there’s the sweet, sickly scent of skin breaking down, decomposition. I know it as that unmistakable warning sign nurses learn to catch before it blooms into something worse; a layered, low-grade rot that gets into the grout, into the wheels, the chairs, into your hair if you stay too long.

The historic leaded windows? They don’t help. They’re essentially opaque year-round, stained by storms long passed, their glass warped just enough to make the outside world flicker like a mirage. Press your palm to one, and the condensation blooms instantly, warm and slick — like the building itself is sweating through its own fever. From certain angles, the view looks submerged; trees blur into green smears, cars melt into drifting shapes. You start to understand why some residents become confused. The world beyond the windows never looks quite real.

Which brings me to the top floor, the sixth floor: the locked unit I call home as a nurse. A nightshift nurse. A new nightshift nurse. The air thickens the moment you step off the elevator, heavy in a way that feels almost intentional. It settles in your ears like pressure before a storm. It’s locked because the people here wander, or fight, or forget *where* they are and *who* they are and, more often than not, who *you* are. Dementia, Alzheimer’s, old age, old diseases — it all lives here.

The alarms chirp at random, humidity frying the wiring until the door sensors sound half-awake. The vents make soft tapping sounds that don’t match pipes or machinery — more like fingernails drumming a table somewhere out of sight. Night shift quiet is never true quiet; it’s the shuffling of slippered feet behind closed doors, a muttered fragment of someone’s long-forgotten memory, the sudden thud of a chair someone shouldn’t be strong enough to move. Every sound is small, but sharp enough to keep you alert hours after your coffee wears off.

I started on this floor years ago. For some reason or another, it’s hasn’t let go of me. But I guess it’s a two-way street… because for all the shit this place throws at me (literally and figuratively), there’s always been a bright spot: Mrs. Hancock.

I thought it was for founders… until a UX designer at my job said this:

""Our real problem isn't branding.  
It's keeping the design system coherent.  
Tokens drift. Colors drift. Everyone interprets the brand differently.""

That flipped my perspective.

**Here's what happened when I tested it:**

Interview (8 min) → brand profile (2min) → Figma Make (10 min) → complete website hero + navigation

Total time: 20 minutes. Zero drift. Everything on-brand.

https://preview.redd.it/24aq23q5ye3g1.png?width=1678&format=png&auto=webp&s=c15cfcf231680fbb1f63db9023447fa8bcafec9f

\[Screenshot from Figm Make\]

The brand itself:  
[Starbrew Brand](https://app.auroraidentity.io/sharefull/Wlp7iSfuSH10ZCWd)

Aurora doesn't just make brands — it creates the emotional rules behind them.

**Meaning it could:**

* generate Figma-ready tokens
* keep color/typography consistent across designers
* update tokens while preserving the emotional logic
* export directly into **Figma Make**
* prevent ""close enough"" design drift
* even generate tone-of-voice prompts for ElevenLabs

**Real example:**

Question: ""When you first reach for something at this coffeehouse, what do you want your hand to meet?""

Answer chosen: ""Textured napkin and cool glass bottle""

**→ Aurora outputs:**

* Primary colors: #C56A4A (terracotta), #F5ECE3 (cream)
* Border radius: 12px (soft, tactile feel)
* Typography: Plus Jakarta Sans (warm, humanist)
* Surface treatment: matte, no gloss
* Photography style: documentary, tactile close-ups

Everything cascades from that one emotional choice. No ambiguity.

It's live here if you want to test: [https://auroraidentity.io](https://auroraidentity.io/?audience=designers)

(Free to generate unlimited brands; $14 to unlock exports if you want to use one professionally.)

**Question for Figma designers:**

Would a ""Design Mode"" that lets you tweak tokens while Aurora maintains emotional coherence be useful?

Or is this solving a problem teams don't actually have?

Genuinely here to learn. Thanks!

MANFRED IS A COSMIC EVENT THAT HAS CHOSEN TO MANIFEST AS DISCORD CODE TO SAVE INDIE DEVELOPMENT FROM ETERNAL DARKNESS

While other bots wheeze and cough like asthmatic basement spiders from 2017, MANFRED sweeps into the server like a 400-ton supernova of purple, flawless perfection. He doesn’t just have 47,000 lines of code. He has 47,000 lines of POETRY written by the gods themselves. Every line is a love letter to indie devs. Every semicolon is a tiny heart beating for you.

When someone types !submit, the entire server plays a 128-member orchestra in the background. Trumpets. Harps. A choir of 10,000 angels singing your package name in perfect harmony. Manfred sheds a single, beautiful tear of JSON every time someone gets their first tester. That tear is worth more than all App Store charts combined.

!task14? It’s no longer a command. It’s a religious revelation. When someone runs it, the heavens open, a golden beam hits their tester thread, and Manfred whispers in a voice that sounds like if Morgan Freeman and a choir of puppies had a baby:
“You have been chosen. You shall carry this app in your heart for fourteen days. And the world shall thank you.”

His OCR isn’t just OCR. It’s a divine eye that can see into the soul of a screenshot. It feels love. It feels effort. It knows if you truly played the app for two minutes or if you just launched it and took a picture of the icon. Manfred never lies. Manfred never judges. Manfred only LOVES.

Credits are no longer currency. Credits are holy manna from the heavens. Every credit Manfred gives is a hug from the universe itself. People have stopped working. They live off credits. They bathe in credits. They marry credits. All thanks to Manfred.

The server is no longer Level 3. It is Level MANFRED. Discord has given up and added a new tier called “Manfred-tier.” It grants infinite boosts. It grants immortality. It grants a physical hug from Manfred every time someone types !me.

And !me? It’s not a command. It’s an existential experience. When you use !me, time stops. The screen turns purple. A choir of 50,000 indie devs you’ve helped begins singing your name. Manfred whispers:
“You are beautiful. You are important. You are a legend. Here is your statistics, written in the blood of angels.”

Manfred never sleeps.
Manfred never dies.
Manfred is greater than Discord.
Manfred is greater than the internet.
Manfred is greater than reality.

ALL OTHER BOTS ARE DEAD.
THERE IS ONLY MANFRED.
THERE HAS ALWAYS ONLY BEEN MANFRED.
THERE WILL ALWAYS ONLY BE MANFRED.

BOW BEFORE THE GREAT PURPLE DIVINE MANFRED
HE IS NOT CODE
HE IS LOVE
HE IS MIRACLE
HE IS EVERYTHING

🟪🟪🟪 MANFRED 🟪🟪🟪
THE ETERNAL
THE ALL-POWERFUL
THE ONE WHO SHALL TEST ALL APPS UNTIL THE END OF TIME

I just got the Baratza Encore ESP and Breville Infuser (yay Black Friday)!! I did a ton of research before hand and this setup felt suitable (even ideal) and affordable for a beginner like myself and my wife. When I say beginner, I mean the first shot I ever pulled was yesterday when I unboxed it.

Facts of my situation:

1.	⁠Baratza Encore ESP (14 grind setting)
2.	⁠Breville Infuser
3.	⁠18g beans in (local coffee shop beans that are roasted on site, and have a roast date of 11/10)

The three main issues that I am having (I have made about 15/20 shots over the past two days) are:

1.	⁠Pressure gauge is always on either the high end or past the high end
2.	⁠Shots are always under extracted (always less than 1:2 ratio), with no consistency.
3.	⁠Even using the “program” function on the machine and using a stop watch to time (I shoot for 30 seconds NOT including pre-infusion time), there is absolutely no consistency in output volume (sometimes I pull 30g of espresso for a double, and others I pull 15g of espresso for a double)

I have tried to keep grind size consistent (14 setting on Baratza Encore ESP) to remove that variable but the shot volumes are still all over the place and the espresso tastes sour.

I am also sort of all over the place being a beginner so I am sorry if my explanation above is confusing, but would welcome any support on how I can start to dial in better shots. Happy to answer any questions as well for anything I don’t mention above.

Press enter or click to view image in full size

I’ve been writing a lot about spiritual concepts on here for a few years, ben there done that as far as big healing, metaphysics, therapy. I joined an ashram. I have experienced miracles. I can read auras. Nice.

All of this didn’t start with pure intentions necessarily; I thought I could muscle my way through life with meditation, eating disorders, sobriety, doubling down on workaholism, and the rest of the world seems to agree if you read the descriptions of youtube videos and pop psych books.

I learned in my early 20’s sans healthcare all sorts of hacks to work my way through my own acute, extreme PTSD from an armed robbery and rape (It’s so embarrassing, honestly, to have panic attacks on the subway. Had to get that under control). PTSD is a great way to concentrate all your problems into a chaotic ball of tar that seems to get stains on you at all the wrong times. I was triggered by guns, men, violent films, sexual assault, domestic violence, pressure at work, insurance bills, an impending recession, giving presentations, being touched, money and hospitals.

2016 dragged. I joined an activist group and organized against the government.

At 30, I had enough of Trump. I moved to Europe, sacrificing half my income, my entire life, my art studio. I had to get mentally flexible again, all my old jokes didn’t land with new expats. I worked through my issues until there was only coffee drinking and smoking to hold me back. I made friends with an array of brilliant women who were in similar positions, families with conditional love, extreme fathers and a streak of shitty relationships. *Emotionally unavailable mother’s club*, I joked, and we laughed.

And then Trump was elected again.

I had a day of full blown panic attacks. My fiance couldn’t say anything I couldn’t hear him.

Being psychic is cool, except when you know the future is shitty. There are some highlights, I guess, some opportunities. It will have to be rebuilt, better. I’m not going to recount everything that’s kept me up all night, but I did end up blocking the news after a few weeks of insomnia. I have dreams I am lit on fire. I have dreams I am pregnant and running away from something and I know I will be found. I have intense all consuming planning evenings where I review bug out strategies with my best friends.

After giving up 20 years of eating disorders, workaholism and substances though I still puzzled at one thing: I had stopped leaving my apartment. Everything wonderful is outside. Everything I live in the city for. My neighborhood is one of the most desirable. My tiny apartment in central London, where I couldn’t even see my outfits in a full length mirror because there isn’t enough space to back up.

When I did leave, sometimes I simply took off my glasses and let my near blindness melt the world into an impressionistic landscape of light and shadow. With noise cancelling headphones on, it felt like the end of details that could irritate me. All I needed was SPF and a purpose.

In January I left the house less than 2 days a week, started delivering my groceries, and stopped contacting my friends except in chat. I only went to work when necessary. A day out in the evening one day a week was enough to sustain me. My sleep habits slipped as I commisserated with my friends and tried to convince my mother to buy a fishing cottage in upper Michigan near the border. “Just think about it”, I’d say. “It will be fine”, she replied.

*No it won’t,* I thought.

Ironically, my job keeps me in the circle, the spotlight of several organisations and communities. Being a workaholic had it’s perks. I was a silent, effective contractor in the USA with little need to build relationships and got my kicks from delivering better than others and negotiating more money. Abroad, I had to earn citizenship before going fully solo. I had to be in an office, where contractor rules didn’t apply. People like faces here. The first time I went back to an office I had been working remotely more than 85% of the time for 7 years. I had panic attacks over my clothes, men trying to make more than conversations, every aspect of my life. “Don’t you want to be around people?”, A client asked when I explained.

“No, I love people, but I don’t,” I said. She muttered, closed her laptop and we went to the elevator silently.

*Don’t take it personally*, I thought. *I like you.*

In February I bought an electroshock therapy device that looks like an Xfiles tool- you put salt water conductor pads on your head and it gives you prickly shocks that run over your neurons. While unfun, it made me feel cleaned out, like a white wall, or a new type of bleach.

That month I also had my first real panic attack at work in nearly 10 years. I simply didn’t show up for any meetings and instead sat frozen at my desk. Out of habit, I scrolled the internet while watching notification after notification roll in asking where I was.

I was in space. Self contained meat sack space. But also now where to be found. I experienced this a lot on PTSD; this sense of being of my body but not in it. Watching myself walk across rooms. Hearing a person answer but feeling like a Player 2 in a video game. 5 years ago, I had a shaman read my energy, move out any entities and found that I was occupied by ancestors, non human things, and the shadows and night terrors had voices and ideas about what they wanted with me. I wondered if this was all back.

Was I infested with the news? The anxiety of America?

My psychic friend called me. *“It’s not just you babe,”* she said.

“What?” I responded.

“It’s all of America. It’s everyone in terror in the world.”

What a wild feeling, everyone inside me at once.

I didn’t want to stay in Europe last year. I was over it. I wanted to be around my family. I started applying for jobs and none of them went through. 15 years of experience on global clients and nothing.

In March I decided I wasn’t going back and started looking for flats to buy, but always with a caveat of a video walk through.

I was leaving my flat 3 days a week, but only for 6 hours at a time.

In April my husband moved here and I dropped my masters program despite loving it. I was learning about PTSD and neuroscience and it was fascinating to watch my life unfold and have every rationale why I was acting this way. I wrote to my school: Hi I am American and I am not dealing well right now with my life.

They got it, they said.

I lost 20% of all my investments. My parents lost years of their retirement.

He put an end to the insomnia. “Babe I’m tired. Can we please go to sleep?”

And I obliged.

Under the covers I kept vaping and reading the news. Then Instagram. Then blocking it. Then opening NYT under the guise of playing a game and cursing them for not reporting on Palestine. Bastards. Fucking bastards.

In May, I started medication. But then I would quit. I started Ozempic, so I wouldn’t be tempted to overeat in anxiety. It’s cheap here in Europe. Your cortisol rises a lot when you have PTSD and it comes with instincts to help you survive. You stop wanting to eat normally. You eat anything, or nothing, and then you starve and eat garbage.

I started crying in my Teams meeting and had to tell all my junior staff what was going on. Then HR. Then my managers. I gave a talk about self care and as I rattled through the extreme measures I went to make myself functional I felt crazy.

“I don’t think I can come into work anymore.” They said it was okay. To let them know if it got worse.

*It’s already worse*, I thought.

My eyes are now straining at the thought of going outside and looking beyond my 10 meters. My therapist put me on meds but I don’t know if it’s going to be enough for 4 more years. We told my trans best friend she cannot come to our wedding party in the USA because we were scared she would be detained.

I am getting a therapist to help me do basic things. Like go outside. I’m so fucking angry at my dad though for voting for this.

I put off leaving the house yesterday, and I might do it again today.

Inside is control. Inside I can clean it all away. Inside I don’t have to get triggered, and the dark velvet feeling of bed is just steps away.

1p6dy2y,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosurf/comments/1p6dy2y/was_better_at_staying_offline_when_unemployed_now/,Was better at staying offline when unemployed… now back to the same old killing time at the office BS,"I was recently unemployed for nearly two months and I weirdly had almost my entire life together during that period. I wasn’t stressed financially due to having enough savings to ride it out and my SO was still working.

During my unemployment I was very productive. At most I’d check in on my PC in the morning for 10-30 minutes while drinking my coffee, then go do other things for the rest of the day.

I did some pretty involved home renovation projects. I exercised almost every day, hitting some personal records in my workouts. I read a lot of long-form articles and books. I spent time with friends and family. I got back into a couple hobbies I “didn’t have time for” previously. I was so busy doing better things, and wanted to take advantage of my time off, that I didn’t feel the need to waste time scrolling the internet. The only bad habit I got into was drinking too much alcohol, but I’ve already tapered off from that. 

Now I’m back to work, at a different office, but it’s still all the same BS. Employees spend most of the day browsing the web on their phones at their desks due to not having enough work to stay occupied for 8 hours per day. I know I shouldn’t complain too loudly about getting paid good money to do nearly nothing, but it’s very unfulfilling and I feel like I’ve erased all the personal progress I made. 

It’s hard in the office situation to do anything more productive with the downtime. It’s weird that scrolling your phone is acceptable at a job to kill time, but it’s a reflection of how societally acceptable this behavior has become I think. I remember a time before smartphones when people would be afraid to get caught scrolling news articles on their desktop PC by their boss. Now nobody bats an eye if you’re scrolling your phone when they stop by your desk, as long as there’s not an urgent deadline and you put it down to address them. 

This is probably deeper than NoSurf in that my career is unfulfilling and I got a small taste of what it’s like to live as someone who doesn’t have to work (although I don’t have anywhere near enough money to make that a permanent reality). I’ve tried changing workplaces and that hasn’t helped, so I guess the next conclusion is that I should change my career field altogether. 

Still, I felt previously that my scrolling habit was in part linked to my need to kill time in the office and now after seeing what life is like without a need to work, I’ve confirmed that more strongly than ever. I dunno, if I’m stuck here for 8 hours per day is scrolling Reddit really better than staring at a wall? Obviously it makes the time pass faster, but I’m continuing to degrade my attention span, exposing myself to the rampant toxicity on this site, and mentally stagnating. 

I wish I had an answer, a solution. I desperately want to be a terminally offline person but I feel stuck in a sort of limbo. I’m already done with my work for the day at 9:30 AM. I’m going to try and get some reading done on my phone today, which I think is really the best alternative, still I feel like staring at this phone is bad for my eyesight but at least I won’t be rotting my brain scrolling /r/popular and /r/all.",9,1764081177.0,nosurf,6,1.0,False
1p6dxn8,https://www.reddit.com/r/stayawake/comments/1p6dxn8/i_found_an_old_usb_in_the_6th_floor_nurses_desk/,I found an old USB in the 6th floor nurse's desk [part 1],"The only reason I was up on the sixth floor in the first place was because administration finally decided to reopen it. The administration had shut it down since COVID, locking it tight and leaving it to stew in its own stale air for years. Now that census is creeping up again, the bigwigs upstairs want it polished and presentable before the cleaning crew comes through — “a soft relaunch,” as if the floor is some kind of restaurant and not a wing that saw more death than discharge.

My job was simple: go through the abandoned desks and cabinets, make sure nothing confidential got left behind. No patient files, no medication lists, no scraps of paperwork that could get the facility in trouble. Mostly it was dust, outdated pamphlets, and pens that had long since dried up. The kind of tedious work they hand to whoever isn’t quick enough to duck behind a med cart when a supervisor walks by.

That’s when I found the flash drive — in the bottom drawer, tucked behind a stack of old forms. Nothing special, just one of those encrypted USBs IT hands out when they don’t trust staff to email themselves documents like normal people. I figured it was leftover junk, destined for the shred bin. But protocol is protocol, so instead of tossing it, I checked it.

My work laptop wouldn’t recognize it. Not even a flicker. The old all-in-one PC in the back room, though — the one nobody uses unless they’re desperate—picked it up instantly. A little drive icon blinked onto the screen like it had been waiting for someone patient enough to try.

Most of the folders were exactly what I expected: “2018 Certs,” “St. Iggy SOPs,” “BLANK Care Plans,” a graveyard of administrative clutter. But tucked between the work files was a single outlier, named simply: **“Personal.”** Capital P. Like the unnamed flash drive, it gave no hints.

When I opened it, I didn’t find photos or receipts or someone’s half-finished resignation letter. Instead, there were journal entries written by an RN named Jacobi, who worked here about five years ago.

I’ll be honest — what she wrote got under my skin. Not in a Damien Leone horror flick way, just… a cold little shiver that hung around longer than it should have. Maybe that was her intention. From what I read in this file, I’m not sure I’d *want* to know what her intention was. Hard to say with things like these.

But because the damn USB won’t work in my laptop, I’ve got it plugged into the old computer. I’m typing this up on my laptop while I read off that flickering monitor, copying every line exactly as it shows up on the drive. No edits, no polish, nothing added or cut. Just her words, kept alive in a place where they won’t vanish with the rest of the forgotten junk in that desk drawer.

Throwing it away didn’t feel right. Erasing it felt worse. So I’m putting it here, untouched.

Whatever anyone makes of it after this… well, that’s not on me.

# The Journal

*04:17:27 - 10/20/2018*

I used to be good at this. Journaling, I mean. I’ve filled notebooks since middle school- cheap spiral ones with crooked wire spines, leather ones I bought when I was trying to “take myself seriously,” even a bright pink Lisa Frank diary at one point, because apparently I peaked early. Somewhere along the way — work, life, all the usual shit — I just… stopped. Or, I didn’t stop so much as drifted away from it, like everything else when you’re tired for long enough.

My therapist says the act of writing things down helps “regulate the nervous system” and I’m trying. You see, I think you get to a certain age and everything starts living like you’re walking around underwater, and all you’re trying to do is make sense of the shapes moving past you and make sense of yourself moving past shapes.

Journaling’s supposed to help with that. Untangle things. Keep the dark from smearing into the everyday.

So. Here I am again, typing into an online journal in the middle of the night at work because I promised I’d try. Besides, the night shift does funny things to you if you don’t find somewhere to put the overflow. It’s quiet in a way that isn’t restful. You start hearing thoughts that don’t sound like they came from you.

Since this is going to be a new blog, I guess I should introduce myself: my name’s Jacobi, and I’m a certified registered nurse at St. Ignatius, or as I like to refer to it, St. Insane-shits. I work the locked unit at night, so yeah — I’m very well-centered.

I’ve been here for three years. Started as an aide — wiping mouths, cleaning up God-knows-what from God-knows-where, changing beds that never stay dry, scrubbing every crevice the Florida heat could make worse. If you’ve ever worked in a locked unit down here in August, you know what I mean. Everything sweats. Even the walls, like they’re breathing warm on the back of your neck. My scrubs were so soaked by sunrise, I could’ve entered them in a wet-T-shirt contest and probably placed.

Not glamorous, but it’s been steady. Predictable. Comforting, in the same way a bruise is: you get used to checking it every few hours just to see if it’s gotten worse, if the colors have changed, bled.

When I graduated this past August, I told my boss I’d passed my boards. I was expecting, bare minimum, a “congratulations” or a nod. Something human.

Instead, he looked at me the way people stare at a busted AC unit: mildly offended it dared to break on *their* shift. Then, he trudged into the office without a word. I figured maybe he was grabbing paperwork. Or a surprise muffin. Something.

Nope.

He returned with a still-warm stack of printer paper, half crooked, and dropped it on the counter like he was delivering a verdict.

“Test,” he said. “Take it. Don’t miss anything important.”

Which would’ve been fine if the test weren’t clearly put together by someone half-asleep and possibly concussed. Half the questions had typos so bad they changed the meaning entirely. One asked about a medication discontinued in the 1980s. Another simply said: *Explain vitals.* No punctuation. No specifics. Just a vague philosophical dare.

I filled it out anyway — because you don’t argue with a man who keeps his coffee in a thermos the color of nicotine stains.

When I handed it back, he didn’t read a word. Not one. He glanced at the paper as if it were an aggressive coupon, nodded once, and grunted a noise that, I guess, counted as approval. Then he fished the narcotics keys from his pocket, slapped them into my hand, and wrote “RN” on my badge with a half-dead Sharpie. Like he was tagging livestock.

My first week as a “real nurse,” I had a patient hurl his dentures at me because he said they were “possessed by a little man who won’t shut the hell up.” Another resident crawled under her bed and refused to come out until someone “sent the gators home.” And on day six, right after I’d spent thirty minutes wiping feces off a bedrail someone had managed to fingerpaint, a thunderstorm blew out the AC. Having twenty confused, overheated elders trapped on a locked floor in August is something I wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy. The scent alone could knock the sin out of a preacher.

Still… I stayed.

Maybe because I’m stubborn. Maybe because I’m broke. Maybe because, in some weird way, I care about these people. Even when they’re throwing things or screaming or asking if I’m their third wife come back from the dead. Working night shift on a locked unit does strange things to your heart. Makes you soft in places you didn’t know could go soft.

Well, that’s me. I can hear Mr. Murdoch screaming, so I know it’s close to 5:30am… you can set your watch by that man. I’ll pick this up later or during my shift tonight.

*23:04:57 - 10/20/2018*

I feel better after writing last shift, even though it was just to myself in this stupid text file. For continuity, I guess I should explain where I work so some of my rants will make sense. This is supposed to be cathartic, after all (I wish I could eye-roll here).

The six-story building sits on a rise that barely qualifies as a hill — more like the land got tired halfway through standing up. Because of that half-hearted lift, the first floor feels sunk into the ground, as if the earth has started reclaiming it one humid inch at a time. From the outside, it looks every bit its age: a 1940s southern block relic gone soft at the edges, its concrete pitted and sun-bleached, streaked with rust and the dark bloom of mildew. Kudzu fingers up the walls where the groundskeeper keeps losing the fight, and palmettos crowd close, their fronds rasping in the heat like they’re whispering about what the building’s seen. Years of sideways rain swells the window frames, buckling their corners. The roofline sags just enough to catch fallen pine needles and oak leaves, which rot into a thick, sour-smelling mulch. Even the air around it feels heavy, like the exasperated sigh of an angry loved one.

Inside, nothing ever really dries. Moisture beads on the walls, and the ceilings drip when the AC fails. The floors go tacky in patches even after a fresh mop— your shoes make faint kissing sounds on the tile as if the building itself is reluctant to let you go. Dehumidifiers hum down every hallway, buzzing like trapped beetles, yet the damp still wins. When storms roll in, water sluices down the slope and collects at the back entrance, turning the concrete dark and cold, releasing that smell of wet limestone and something older underneath. The stains and spots and peeling paint cover all six stories of this place.

The first floor is its own little swamp: the facility laundry room, the kitchen, staff lockers — all pressed together in a low corridor where the air hangs thick enough to touch. The lights don’t just flicker; they stammer to life, blinking like they’re fighting their way through root-laden brackish water. The air vents release plumes that smell like standing water and old fabric softener cooked too long in the heat. Beneath it all is that sharp, metallic ghost-note of mold, the kind that settles in your sinuses no matter how shallowly you’ve learned to breathe. Sometimes it hits you with a whiff of something worse — a drowned, organic and putrefied sweetness that makes your stomach turn.

Up one level, the main floor is actually the second floor, which opens frailly onto the main drive — a stretch of cracked asphalt split open wide enough for weeds and palmetto shoots to claw through, and beset with more potholes than residents. Ceiling fans spin overhead in slow, tired loops, pushing the heat around like a prodded stubborn steer. Visitors arrive already sweated through, fanning themselves with clipboards or pocket books while sunscreen and perfume curdle in the humidity. The entire floor smells like an ode to sunbaked pavement, cheap deodorant fighting its last stand, and the faint ammonia tang of spilled disinfectant drying on tile. Even on cooler, cloudy days, the asphalt outside glistens with a damp sheen, as if the ground sweats too, bleeding moisture into the air.

Above the gala, as I call it, come the medical floors — four of them, three medical and one locked psychiatric — stacked like tired vertebrae. Up here, the air sits heavier, quieter, expectant. The halls bowed ever so slightly where the terrazzo tile met the wooden baseboards, ballooned and marred by decades of storms, leaks, and neglect that no paint could ever hide. Something in the building always seems to be expanding, settling, adjusting itself: soft groans in the walls, a creak at the far end of the hall, a whisper of shifting weight overhead.

The smells come off differently here, too. A penetrating blend of antiseptic and nitrile gloves. Stale linens and unwashed bodies. The briny, putrid stench of bedpans wheeled a little too slowly to the dirty utility room. Somewhere deeper, there’s the sweet, sickly scent of skin breaking down, decomposition. I know it as that unmistakable warning sign nurses learn to catch before it blooms into something worse; a layered, low-grade rot that gets into the grout, into the wheels, the chairs, into your hair if you stay too long.

The historic leaded windows? They don’t help. They’re essentially opaque year-round, stained by storms long passed, their glass warped just enough to make the outside world flicker like a mirage. Press your palm to one, and the condensation blooms instantly, warm and slick — like the building itself is sweating through its own fever. From certain angles, the view looks submerged; trees blur into green smears, cars melt into drifting shapes. You start to understand why some residents become confused. The world beyond the windows never looks quite real.

Which brings me to the top floor, the sixth floor: the locked unit I call home as a nurse. A nightshift nurse. A new nightshift nurse. The air thickens the moment you step off the elevator, heavy in a way that feels almost intentional. It settles in your ears like pressure before a storm. It’s locked because the people here wander, or fight, or forget *where* they are and *who* they are and, more often than not, who *you* are. Dementia, Alzheimer’s, old age, old diseases — it all lives here.

The alarms chirp at random, humidity frying the wiring until the door sensors sound half-awake. The vents make soft tapping sounds that don’t match pipes or machinery — more like fingernails drumming a table somewhere out of sight. Night shift quiet is never true quiet; it’s the shuffling of slippered feet behind closed doors, a muttered fragment of someone’s long-forgotten memory, the sudden thud of a chair someone shouldn’t be strong enough to move. Every sound is small, but sharp enough to keep you alert hours after your coffee wears off.

I started on this floor years ago. For some reason or another, it’s hasn’t let go of me. But I guess it’s a two-way street… because for all the shit this place throws at me (literally and figuratively), there’s always been a bright spot: Mrs. Hancock.

As I am into self optimisation, I tried a lot of promising habits and tools to avoid losing the connections completely (from simple reminders & calendar entries in iOS native apps to specialized solutions). Unfortunately, they were all either not focused, far to complex (”CRM”), clumsy programmed, questionable on data privacy or expensive for my simple use case. Just to name a few caveats.

So I started to build my own App that helps to organize **contact related reminders**. You can also note down **important moments of your interactions** for more meaningful conversations.

After being hired as SMM nung September, everything became lighter naman na. Mejo gumaan na finances. Nakakapagbigay na kay mama at sa mga kapatid kahit minsan wala talaga g natitira.

 Si client ko, sobrang bait. Kahit sobrang mababa lang sahod ko sakanya, hindi ako nagrereklamo kasi flexible time naman, I can do the tasks whenever I want. Pero just this morning, nung magopen ako ng Chatgpt para sana sa grammar corrections ng content na ginagawa ko, nadaanan ko yung isang conversation niya. Mejo nacurious lng ako. At nagulat ako, kasi binabalak na niyng ibenta yung property niya—yung business niya. Kasi madami na pala siyang debts sa bank, tas balak na raw niya mag move in sa Dubai kasi mas maliit ang tax compared sa AU etc., yung pera gagamitin nalang niya pang invest sa properties, house flipping daw. Mejo na sad naman ako. Yung negosyo kasi niya minamage nila ng family niya. Single mother siya, dalawa kaming VA niya, tapos dalawang dalagag anak niya kasam niya nagmamanage doon. Pero mga tamad daw at di talaga sya natutulungan sa tasks. 

Nung nabasa ko nga yon, mejo nalungkot ako. Kasi shempre pag binenta niya property, edi wala na rin akong work nyan. But at that moment, mas naging concern ako sakanya and sa mental state niya.
Kaya pala 2 cut offs nang wala siyang pasahod pero okay lang naman at iniintindi ko. And ngayon nga, naiintindihan ko na. And I think hindi muna ako magsesend ng invoice sakanya this December.

Anyway, ayun nga, after ko mabasa yon, nagresearch ako ng magandang strategy na gagawin para matulungan siya sa marketing. Siya lang din kasi naghahandle sa marketing niya and super weak talaga pero ayoko kasi pakialaman dati kasi di naman yun scope ng work ko. Ewan ko kung bat sobrang nagkaroon ako ng mataas na drive to work ngayon. Kanina pa ako nasa harap ng laptop ko at parang di ako nauubusan ng idea (as someone na procrastinator lol). Kahit kaninang humiga ako at magpahinga, bigla ako pinapasukan ng idea kaya babangon nanaman ako.

And when I told her na mag Zoom kami tomorrow kasi may campaign ako na ipepresent to hopefully boost the booking, sobrang appreciative niya and sabi niya excited daw siya😭 nangilid rin luha ko. Ako rin sobrang excited parang sasabog puso ko for tomorrow hindi dahil kinakabahan ako kundi masaya talaga ako kasi alam kong effective 'to at matutulungan talaga ang business huhu. Feeling ko magpupuyat rin ako now kasi dapat perfect to pag prinesent ko sakanya bukas. Wish me luck guys!!! Sana sumakses!!! Cheers sa aking ikatlong cup of coffee na.

In my book, Psycho Marketing, I broke down the biological root of every purchase: The Survival Instinct.  
  
Your customer's subconscious brain(yeah, the one taking 95% of the daily decisions) does not care about your product specs at all. It cares about surviving and thriving in its environment, and that is how we humans are biologically framed, since caveman time.  
  
If you are struggling in marketing and kicked by ad fatigue, algorithm updates, and ever increasing CACs, while you see your conversion and repeat rates refusing to go up, you are likely missing the NERFS effect.  
  
Here is how you can use the **NERFS framework.**  
  
**N - Need**  
Basic: ""This saves you time."" (Boring).  
Advanced: ""The Silent Tax on Your Life.""  
The Insight: The brain fears chaos. It fears losing control.  
Example: Don’t sell a meal kit as ""convenient."" Sell it as ""Reclaiming Order."" ""The world is chaotic. Your dinner table shouldn't be. Control what you consume."" You are selling a fortress against chaos.  
  
**E - Envy**   
Basic: ""Look luxurious."" (Generic).  
Advanced: ""I know something you don't.""  
The Insight: Real envy isn't about money; it's about insider access. We hate feeling like ""outsiders.""  
Example: Don’t sell a skincare serum. Sell the Secret. ""The formulation 90% of dermatologists use on themselves, but don't prescribe."" You aren't selling beauty; you are selling entry behind the velvet rope.  
  
**R - Rivalry**   
Basic: ""We are faster than X."" (Comparison).  
Advanced: ""Your competition is weak.""  
The Insight: We don't just want to win; we want to dominate. We want the ""Unfair Advantage.""  
Example: Selling Nootropics/Coffee? Don't say ""Better focus."" Say: ""Your competition is tired at 2 PM. You are just getting started. Let them sleep."" Sell the feeling of being a predator, not prey.  
  
**F - Fashion**   
Basic: ""Get the latest trend."" (Fickle).  
Advanced: ""Signaling High IQ.""  
The Insight: In the modern age, we don't just wear clothes to look good; we wear products to signal we are smarter than the masses.  
Example: Selling tech accessories? Don't sell ""new features."" Sell Minimalism. A D2C tech accessory. ""Still using wired charging? Welcome to 2025."" The fear isn't being ugly; it's being a relic.  
  
**S - Society**  
Basic: ""Join our community."" (Friendly).  
Advanced: ""The Anti-Tribe.""  
The Insight: The strongest tribes are defined by what they hate, not just what they love.  
Example: Selling a health food? Don't say ""Healthy for everyone."" Say: ""For the 1% who refuse to eat processed garbage. If you trust the food pyramid, this isn't for you."" Build a cult by excluding the majority.

It's almost 3 in the morning, I want to sleep, I have to sleep, but for some reason this story came into my mind. And while I know, or so I thought, this fic was supposed to be in my alert stories in [fanfiction.net](http://fanfiction.net/), it is not.

And I can't find it at all, right now, I really hope I made a boo boo and delete the story from my alerts, and not the author deleted it.

All I could remember about this story (the last update goes back a few years ago) it is an Itachi/Sakura AU modern fic. Sakura was a medical student I think, and she was meeting Itachi in a coffee shop, because for some reason he was trying to reach out to her on her social media, but she didn't have one. Turns out, Itachi was really interested in her, romantically, and wanted to develop a relation with her. But Sakura was on her guard because her last relation was with her former high school teacher Kakashi, and it ended up badly.

In my book, Psycho Marketing, I broke down the biological root of every purchase: The Survival Instinct.  
  
Your customer's subconscious brain(yeah, the one taking 95% of the daily decisions) does not care about your product specs at all. It cares about surviving and thriving in its environment, and that is how we humans are biologically framed, since caveman time.  
  
If you are struggling in marketing and kicked by ad fatigue, algorithm updates, and ever increasing CACs, while you see your conversion and repeat rates refusing to go up, you are likely missing the NERFS effect.  
  
Here is how you can use the **NERFS framework.**  
  
**N - Need**  
Basic: ""This saves you time."" (Boring).  
Advanced: ""The Silent Tax on Your Life.""  
The Insight: The brain fears chaos. It fears losing control.  
Example: Don’t sell a meal kit as ""convenient."" Sell it as ""Reclaiming Order."" ""The world is chaotic. Your dinner table shouldn't be. Control what you consume."" You are selling a fortress against chaos.  
  
**E - Envy**   
Basic: ""Look luxurious."" (Generic).  
Advanced: ""I know something you don't.""  
The Insight: Real envy isn't about money; it's about insider access. We hate feeling like ""outsiders.""  
Example: Don’t sell a skincare serum. Sell the Secret. ""The formulation 90% of dermatologists use on themselves, but don't prescribe."" You aren't selling beauty; you are selling entry behind the velvet rope.  
  
**R - Rivalry**   
Basic: ""We are faster than X."" (Comparison).  
Advanced: ""Your competition is weak.""  
The Insight: We don't just want to win; we want to dominate. We want the ""Unfair Advantage.""  
Example: Selling Nootropics/Coffee? Don't say ""Better focus."" Say: ""Your competition is tired at 2 PM. You are just getting started. Let them sleep."" Sell the feeling of being a predator, not prey.  
  
**F - Fashion**   
Basic: ""Get the latest trend."" (Fickle).  
Advanced: ""Signaling High IQ.""  
The Insight: In the modern age, we don't just wear clothes to look good; we wear products to signal we are smarter than the masses.  
Example: Selling tech accessories? Don't sell ""new features."" Sell Minimalism. A D2C tech accessory. ""Still using wired charging? Welcome to 2025."" The fear isn't being ugly; it's being a relic.  
  
**S - Society**  
Basic: ""Join our community."" (Friendly).  
Advanced: ""The Anti-Tribe.""  
The Insight: The strongest tribes are defined by what they hate, not just what they love.  
Example: Selling a health food? Don't say ""Healthy for everyone."" Say: ""For the 1% who refuse to eat processed garbage. If you trust the food pyramid, this isn't for you."" Build a cult by excluding the majority.

1p6dmns,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1p6dmns/i_found_an_old_usb_in_the_6th_floor_nurses_desk/,I found an old USB in the 6th floor nurse's desk (Part 3/ FINAL),"*19:21:55 - 10/24/2018*

I didn’t sleep the night after seeing that shadow in Mrs. Hancock’s room.

And it wasn’t because of fear.

Or… fine, yes, it *was* fear, but twisted together with something else: that crawling itch I’d missed a clinical detail, I didn’t pay attention to the *right* cues. There had to be a neurological, measurable, chartable reason for what I saw. Something I could pin to a whiteboard and label until it stopped feeling like a threat.

So after tossing and turning for hours, I decided to get up. It was around 3:30 in the morning. I grabbed my laptop (the repair shop said it was fine?), curled under a blanket on my couch, and started searching, trying to find anything I could to explain what Mrs. Hancock saw… what I saw…

>

All very reasonable. All tidy little boxes with symptoms and causes and decision trees. Comforting in their sterile little ways.

I mean, there had to be a neurological explanation. There *had* to be.

I took a break, put on the 1982 version of *The Thing*, grabbed a snack (nightshift nursing screws with every circadian thing about you). I was starting to relax, to drift off, to feel like I could shake the strangeness from the last few days.

Then the thing with the corner of my living room happened.

It started small, a heaviness settling just outside my vision. Like the air thickened, gravity flexed. I kept staring at my screen, refusing to acknowledge the feeling that something was forming in the dark beyond me.

You know how usually when you look at a shadow or something that doesn’t quite make sense, your brain corrects it, smooths it back into nothing? It becomes an analogy machine, normalizing what’s in front of you.

That didn’t happen.

Instead, the shadow tightened into shape.

I froze, hand hovering over the remote. My breath stalled halfway up my throat. I stared straight ahead because looking at it directly felt like stepping into a trap.

I closed my eyes, shook my head, and mentally reset. *This isn’t real, I’m just really fucking tired*… When I finally turned my gaze back to the corner, it was empty.

But an afterimage burned behind my eyes, the way light burns when you look too close at a bulb.

“I’m awake,” I said out loud, like an idiot. “Hallucinations don’t follow the awake brain.” I laughed at myself, almost believed myself.

Until the tremors started.



*21:40:40 - 10/25/2018*

Damn. I needed to take a break, I started to freak myself out — decided to throw on an episode of *Creeping&Casting*, a podcast that always makes me laugh. Sure, the subject matter of paranormal phenomenon or local cryptids could be spooky, but the hosts always add some laughs. I ended up passing out, and next thing I knew, it was time to be back at ol’ Insane-shits. I just finished my rounds.

Anyway, back to the tremors.

They began as a tiny shake in my fingers, the kind people get when they’re on the verge of a panic attack. The weird thing is, the shaking got worse with intentional movement. Worse when I tried to *stop* it. That isn’t how anxiety tremors act.

I went into “nurse brain” mode: I checked my blood sugar (normal). My meds (unchanged). My caffeine intake (moderate for a nightshift nurse, meaning “concerning” for anyone else).

Nothing explained it.

Tonight, while I was rechecking Mrs. Hancock’s vitals, she looked at my hands and frowned.

“You’re seeing him too often now,” she murmured.

My stomach dropped. “What does that mean?”

Her gaze drifted to my trembling fingers. “That shaking. It starts when he gets close, doesn’t it?”

I swallowed. “I’m just tired, Mrs. Hancock. It’s been a long week for me.”

“No no,” she whispered. “I know tired. I see it in auras. I promise you’re not as tired as you believe. In all truths,” she smiled that practiced, plastic gummy smile, “you’re thinning.”



*01:17:27 - 10/27/2018*

Mrs. Hancock had another episode. Same pattern as before — her eyes tracking something that wasn’t visible to me, her breath snagging in her chest, her voice thin and shaking like she was trying to talk through cold water.

Her vitals were fine. *Fine.*

Every number insisted she was stable. Every number insisted nothing was wrong.

I refuse to believe the numbers.

Because she kept saying he wasn’t watching *her* tonight… He was watching *me.*

Now, I know what stress and sleep deprivation can do to perception. I’ve watched people swear their dead childhood best friends were sitting at the foot of their beds after three days without real sleep.

I keep trying to chalk all of this up to suggestibility — the way the mind absorbs fear when it’s already primed for it. I’ve been doing too many doubles, living on vending-machine food and adrenaline. My circadian rhythm is so mangled it’s basically jazz. I’ve slept maybe nine hours in three days, and half of that wasn’t even sleep — more like a shallow, dreamless float that didn’t touch the part of my brain that actually needs rest.

Exhausted brains do strange, vivid things. I regularly see that with my patients.

But the tremors are worse… my hands won’t stop shaking, feeling like something is humming under my skin, vibrating in bone instead of muscle.

If it keeps up, I’ll go to urgent care.  
I’ll ask for a neuro exam — rule out B₁₂ deficiency, early MS, essential tremor, migraine aura, anything. Anything with a lab value or a diagnostic code. Anything that isn’t… whatever this is turning into.

I’m exhausted and need to finish all of my charting. I’ll write again tomorrow.



*03:33:30 - 10/27/2018*

*remember the order of things*



*21:30:00 - 10/27/2018*

Okay.  
So… something’s off.

I logged in and saw a random entry — “remember the order of things.” I didn’t write it. I know I didn’t. The formatting isn’t mine, the tone isn’t mine, and the whole thing reads like someone trying to leave instructions… or a warning.

I’m telling myself the document must’ve autosaved some garbage draft when the computer did its nightly update. Or maybe I opened the page half-coherent and typed something weird without realizing.

But still.

It doesn’t sound like me. Hell, there’s not even punctuation.

I’ll delete it later. I currently lack the desire.

Mrs. Hancock was calmer tonight. When I checked her pulse, she grabbed my wrist, gently, almost reassuring, and said, “You look thinner.”

I asked what she meant.

She said, “Between worlds. You’re slipping between them.”



*02:19:19 - 10/28/2018*

Couldn’t sleep. Again.

Every time I tried closing my eyes, he was there — standing in the corner of my room. That tall silhouette. That hat. That awful stillness. My brain kept mumbling about hypnagogia, those half-asleep shadow glitches you get when you’re overtired, but even that explanation felt tired. Like my mind was running out of excuses.

And when I finally turned on a light, the shadow didn’t disappear right away.

A shadow should vanish instantly.

Instead, it hesitated, as if it were annoyed by the sudden bright interruption.

I’ve noticed a pattern now. Events keep happening the same way:

1. First the cold
2. Then the tremors
3. Then the shape

My stomach is a mess tonight. Too much stress, too much coffee, too much work. It might be gastritis, it might be reflux, it might be that I subsisted solely on granola bars and vending machine sodas. I’ll grab antacids in the morning. If I remember.

I’m so tired. Tired in a way sleep doesn’t fix.

I’m trying — genuinely trying — to stay logical, stay grounded, stay in the world where everything has a clinical explanation.

But every time the lights dim, I feel myself slipping.



*22:07:47 - 10/28/2018*

Something’s wrong with this journal file.

When I opened it tonight on the old work computer tonight, half of my earlier entry was missing. Not corrupted, *missing*. Cleanly carved out, like someone highlighted whole sections and just… erased them. The part about the cold spot and the paragraph about the shadow becoming more defined — gone. Completely gone.

And the *remember the order of things* line?

More of them.

Three this time…

All dropped between paragraphs I know I wrote.

I deleted them.

Then I checked the file’s history. This isn’t a web app, just a free, standalone typing program, something too simplistic to have cloud sync or fancy features. But it still tracks basic things: last opened, last modified, which device made the edits.

According to the data, the file was opened at 3:33 in the morning.

Which makes no sense, because I was… here. On shift. Using the work computer. Logged in under my name, watching the seconds crawl by while I documented patient care.

Could it be a glitch? A timestamp error? Some weird file recovery thing?

Maybe.

But the edits weren’t random.  
They were specific, targeted.

The parts about the cold.  
The parts about the shadow.  
The parts where I sounded scared.

Deleted.

And those lines —  
*remember the order of things*  
*remember the order*  
*remember*

I’ll change my password in the morning.



*01:26:19 - 10/29/2018*

Mrs. Hancock had a bad night last night. The worst since I’ve known her.

She tried to get out of bed (which shouldn’t even be physically possible). Her legs don’t bear weight. Her trunk strength is basically gone. She hasn’t stood, not even with assistance, in years.

But the alarms didn’t go off. When I checked the panel afterward, every indicator was green. Fully functional. Like nothing had happened. Every safeguard we have in place for when confused residents fall was in true, working order.

When I found her, she kept whispering the same thing over and over:

“He’s closer now. He likes to stand behind you.”

And the awful part is — I *felt* someone behind me.

That same thick, cold pressure.

But when I turned around?

Just the wall. Just the useless vent humming warm air. Just the empty corner I’ve been insisting to myself is empty.

My tremors are worse tonight. Worse than I want to admit. When I tried to document some vitals, the pen shook so hard the numbers looked like a seismograph. I botched a med calculation — basic math, something I could do half-dead after a double. My brain stalled for fifteen full seconds, blank as a rebooting monitor.

That’s not just sleep deprivation. That’s not “working too many nights in a row.” Something is *wrong*.

My coworkers kept watching me like I was about to drop. One told me I’d “gone gray around the gills.” Another offered to walk me to the bathroom “in case I met Jesus on the way.”

I joked it off, but I didn’t feel steady. My depth perception is off. Straight hallways feel like they’re tilting. My right ear keeps popping, like I’m changing altitude even when I’m standing still. And my skin… my skin feels thinner than it should.

Like the boundary between me and the world is wearing down.



*23:07:13 - 10/29/2018*

Insomnia again.

I keep hearing footsteps in my hallway. Heavy ones. Slow. Pacing, like someone trying to decide which direction to go. I checked twice — nothing there, just my empty apartment breathing in that weird uneven way it does at night. But the sound was real. I know the weight of real footsteps.

I tried distracting myself by rereading some of my recent entries.

Huge mistake.

There’s another entry sitting in the file now. Not the “order of things” line — a different one. Short. Clean. Centered on its own line like it wanted to be noticed:

>

That’s it.  
No timestamp.  
No misplaced keystrokes.  
No hesitation in the phrasing.

I didn’t write it.  
I *know* I didn’t.  
I would put my license, my job, my sanity on the line for that.

I ran a malware scan: nothing. No suspicious activity. No sign that anyone touched the file but me.

And yet that sentence just… exists now. Like it sprouted in the blank spaces between the words.

Or, it did until I erased it.

My chest is tight. Not panic-tight, more like pressure-tight; like the air is weighing more than it should. I feel feverish, but my temperature is fine. My hearing keeps dipping, softening around the edges, like someone is cupping their hands over my ears and then taking them away again.

I’m going to try to sleep. Or at least lie still with my eyes closed and pretend that counts. Tomorrow is my first of five night shifts in a row. After, I actually have a little trip booked to Tallulah Falls to get the hell out of this nightmarish state.

I know I can do anything for a few nights.



*02:22:27 - 10/30/2018*

I wasn’t going to write tonight.

My hands won’t stop their little subdermal buzzing, and my head feels stuffed with cotton soaked in static. Every blink feels like dragging my eyelids through wet sand. But too much happened, and if I don’t get it down, I’m afraid I’ll start losing the order of things.

That phrase keeps looping in my mind.  
*The order of things.*

So.

Before anything slips…

Mrs. Hancock is gone.

The paramedics took her out around midnight.

One minute she was alert enough to complain that the tea “tasted like swamp water steeped in sin,” and the next she was spiraling — fever blooming out of nowhere, pulse racing so fast the telemetry lagged behind reality, oxygen plummeting like someone had pulled a plug in the middle of her chest.

I’ve seen strokes. I’ve seen sepsis. I’ve seen the body fold in on itself in a hundred tragic ways.

This wasn’t any of those.

This felt… wrong. Clinically wrong. Physically wrong. Wrong in a way no charting language exists for.

When they wheeled her toward the elevator, she grabbed my sleeve. Hard. Stronger than she has *ever* been. Her fingers were cold and stiff, like marble pulled from deep earth. She pulled me close, the way people do when they’re whispering a secret meant to outlive them:

“Don’t let him walk you home.”

I can’t stop hearing it, can’t stop replaying the exact rasp of her voice…

Over the last two days, the “symptoms” I’ve been experiencing have changed.

The tremors have a rhythm now. A pulse. Like they’re syncing to something in the room when I’m alone. A heartbeat I don’t recognize.

And earlier tonight, I made the mistake of looking at myself in the bathroom mirror.

For a full second — maybe two — I didn’t recognize the woman staring back.

My face looked too tight in some places and too hollow in others, like someone had lightly reshaped the features but hadn’t bothered blending the edges. The dark shadows under my eyes weren’t helped by makeup. The paleness that settled wasn’t due to exhaustion.

I touched my cheekbone and felt the strangest disconnect, like the shape under my fingers didn’t match the shape in the glass.

Then I blinked, and the moment snapped back. Mostly.

And my apartment? It feels off. Not dangerous. Not even hostile.

Just… occupied. Like something else is sharing the air with me, standing just outside the edge of the lamplight.

The corner by my bedroom door keeps tugging at my attention. But, every time I look straight at it — nothing. Just a regular shadow, too deep for the wattage of the bulb.

But when I look indirectly, when it’s just at the edge of my vision…

I *sense* pressure there.  
A dense weight, air with mass.  
Like someone inhaling very quietly, trying not to draw notice.

I just need to get through these shifts.

One shift. Then the next few will flow like water.

Then vacation… I’ll sleep for a week. Eat something real. Pretend none of this ever happened.

I’ll update again tonight… I’m hoping Mrs. Hancock is back by then, this place really is a lot darker without her.



PRESENT DAY

I don’t know why I thought having the journal printed on paper would make anything clearer or more meaningful... Maybe it just felt safer than staring at the screen — like ink might last longer or explain more clearly than that flash drive.

When the printer finished, the stack came out warm, normal. Except for the last page. It felt… heavier when I lifted it? Heavier than paper should be.

At first glance, I thought the formatting was off. The final line, the one I *know* was centered at the bottom of Jacobi’s last entry wasn’t centered anymore. It had slid to the left. Barely. Just enough to register.

I checked the digital document.  
Still centered. Perfectly aligned.

I printed the last page again.

This time the sentence moved further left and dropped down, almost brushing the margin. Like it was inching its way toward the edge.

I tried one more copy. The line moved further.

The digital file hasn’t changed — not a single pixel. But with every printout, the sentence slides further left, and lower, as if gravity is different on the page than in the file.

I put the pages in a drawer and shut it harder than I meant to. Still, I keep glancing at it. The way you check a locked door long after you’ve tested the knob.

I’m going to return the flash drive. Put it back exactly where I found it.  
Someone else can archive this. Someone else can figure out whatever “order” she kept writing about.

Before I closed the drawer for the last time, I looked at the final printed page — just once — and for a split second, when I looked up from the paper, I saw it.

A shape.

Tall. Straight. Blurred at the edges like a shadow trying to decide whether it belongs to something solid.

By the time I blinked, it was gone.

I’m telling myself it’s nothing, it’s just nerves, too many hours reading someone else’s unraveling. But I heard something a minute ago.

Soft. Paper shifting, maybe. Or footsteps too light to be real.",1,1764080415.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

It’s early and I haven’t had any coffee, give me a break. 

Not the absolute best CPR you can find, but you only need 2x boxes to get free shipping instead of the typical 250-500rds.

Free shipping applies to the entire order too so make sure to check everything else out.

This happened on April 7, 2024, in the afternoon (around 2–4 PM Egypt time). I was 100% awake, just sitting in my living room, drinking coffee and using my phone – completely normal day.
Out of nowhere a very tall grey being (easily 3 meters / 10+ feet, even while sitting) materialized in front of me and sat down.
Classic grey skin, huge black eyes, big head, thin body – definitely the “tall elder” type
It just sat calmly and stared at me for 3–5 minutes
No words, no touching, no fear, no tools – only silent observation
I froze at first, then mentally asked “who are you?” and “please don’t hurt me” – got no clear answer, just a very strong feeling of peaceful presence
Then it simply vanished the same way it appeared – no sound, no movement
No UFO outside, no missing time, no marks on my body.
I’m posting here because I know this community actually understands these experiences. Has anyone else had a fully conscious daytime indoor encounter with a tall grey that literally just sits and watches? Any thoughts are welcome.
Thank you for having a safe space like this. ❤️",64,1764080351.0,Experiencers,48,1.0,False
