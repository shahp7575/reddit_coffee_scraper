1na9gj2,https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerOnReviews/comments/1na9gj2/should_you_invest_in_the_best_coffee_maker/,Should You Invest in the Best Coffee Maker Technivorm Moccamaster,"Setting up my shiny Technivorm Moccamaster 53923 KBGV was more exciting than I care to admit. Coffee aficionados often promise that a brewer of this caliber can transform dreary mornings into a moment of pure bliss, and I was ready to test that claim. This ten-cup coffee maker, stylishly drenched in its Juniper hue, undeniably boasts elegance. But beyond aesthetics, it's advertised as more than just a pretty face ‚Äì precision brewing, quiet operation, and thoughtful features all point to it being a workhorse in the world of coffee machines.

**Flawless Design and Build Quality**  
Right out of the box, this coffee maker feels like a premium product. Constructed with durable, high-quality materials, it embodies sturdiness. The glowing metallic finish not only looks fantastic on the countertop but also resists fingerprint smudges. I‚Äôve been particularly impressed by how well the design strikes a balance between modern curves and timeless simplicity. The Brew-Volume Selector switch is a genius addition for versatile brewing‚Äîwhether I‚Äôm alone or hosting guests, it caters seamlessly.  

[Check Technivorm Moccamaster 53923 KBGV price on Amazon.](https://mgplab.com/p/b0bpjqs63w/)

**Brew Performance and Coffee Quality**  
Let‚Äôs be honest, the real test of any coffee maker lies in its brewing prowess. The machine doesn‚Äôt just heat water; it reaches the perfect temperature for coffee extraction, somewhere between 196‚Äì205¬∞F. This results in rich flavors without bitterness. The Moccamaster lives up to the promise of brewing a 40-ounce pot in just four to six minutes, and more surprisingly, it achieves consistent results every time. Whether I used a medium roast or something darker, the flavors shone through beautifully.

**Energy Efficiency and Modern Features**  
What truly sets this coffee maker apart for me is its ability to combine modern convenience with great functionality. Quietly operating in the morning, this machine doesn‚Äôt jolt the entire household awake. Plus, it has an automatic shut-off feature that activates after 100 minutes, ensuring safety and energy efficiency. As someone who often rushes out the door, this gives me peace of mind.  

**Pluses**  
The coffee brewing experience on this machine has earned it a spot as my go-to appliance.  
- Consistent brewing temperature for optimal coffee extraction  
- Speedy operation without compromising flavor  
- Brew-Volume Selector is perfect for both small and large households  

**Areas for Improvement**  
Nothing in life is perfect, right? While this brewer has lived up to expectations in many ways, it‚Äôs not free from flaws.  
- The carafe lip design can lead to uneven pouring, especially if you‚Äôre not careful.  
- Its price point may deter casual drinkers who don‚Äôt consume coffee daily.  
- Lack of programmable brewing can be inconvenient for some users.

**Other Options**  
Competition among coffee makers in this price range is stiff. Machines like the Breville Precision Brewer and the Bonavita Connoisseur come to mind. While the Breville offers advanced programmable settings, it doesn‚Äôt have quite the same handcrafted charm. The Bonavita, although comparable in ease-of-use, feels less premium in build. What‚Äôs unique about the Moccamaster is its blend of simplicity and performance. For those who value consistent, high-quality coffee over additional features, it holds its ground impressively.

**Bang for the Buck**  
A good coffee maker isn‚Äôt just about the upfront savings; it‚Äôs the long-term experience. Although the Technivorm Moccamaster may feel like a stretch for some budgets, its build quality and brewing reliability make it worth the expense. It‚Äôs the type of machine that pays for itself over time, sparing me bad coffee from subpar devices or expensive caf√© runs. Plus, their five-year warranty is a cherry on top.

Coffee doesn't make me shit. I've never had diarrhea once in my life. Taco Bell? Never had an issue. It's a blessing and a curse.

Now, I've been having horrible chronic illness problems for the last couple of weeks, and taking medicine that increases constipation. Which, is not good for me. I haven't had a full shit in two weeks. I've pooped twice and it was three pathetic rabbit turds at best, after 20 minutes of pushing like I'm giving birth.

So, I hit my breaking point and did an enema. Just a saline enema, since the laxative enemas always give me stomach cramps as fuck. And after two minutes, it just flushes it all to my rectum, and I can finally feel the relief. All of the trapped gas, feces, mucus, just gets sucked out.

Now, it's a violent, gut wrenching, nauseating process. But, once it's over, and I stop shaking, and I can breathe, i always feel better. I hate doing them because they're such a hassle, but it's always worth it. So, if you're backed up, the fleet saline enemas are the way to go man.",2,1757189174.0,Constipation,0,1.0,False

I started developing chest pain every now and then noticeably after hitting the evil penjamin but I continued smoking, then over the span of months the pain started happening more often and became more painful. The pain I usually feel is a tightness like it‚Äôs being squeezed, heaviness, and sometimes it‚Äôs a sharp pain. It has radiated to my back and my neck in the past, but not as much anymore. It has no real rhyme or reason for why it comes, but I found sometimes it got worse at night, when I‚Äôm stressed, if I was breathing any kind of smoke, sometimes after cardio exercise, after heavy meals, drinking coffee, or if I go a while without food I think? I got an ekg, lung x ray, and echocardiogram done only to show nothing wrong with my heart or lungs but the pain keeps persisting. I completely stopped carts and switched to 10mg edibles, and I went clean for a month and a half recently (I‚Äôm weak and the full stop method left me wanting it almost every day I was clean so I‚Äôm trying a wean off method right nowüíÄ) and I still found I had the pain almost every day at least once a day. I got a 10 pk of edibles with the intention to slowly take myself off of it (I know I‚Äôm weaküòî) and I‚Äôm finding that the chest pain again has become more intense but hasn‚Äôt happened more often than it was when I was clean. I believe I may have stomach issues that may influence this pain as I was told my general dr I have diverticulitis that needed antibiotics (might be related idk, food and coffee affect it, and sometimes the chest pain also felt in between my stomach and chest. I‚Äôve tried looking up if maybe I have gerd bc some meals can give me phlegm, I‚Äôve noticed that sometimes the chest pain starts after meals, and I have found antacids have helped stop the pain from continuing as long but it has a variable success rate. I know I need to stop weed bc it also has negative effects on the heart that much is obvious to me but I‚Äôm wondering if this could have some relation to stomach or lung issues I don‚Äôt know about? Or if there are more cardiac tests I need done to get a better idea? I‚Äôm also trying to find ppl going through something similar. Heart issues run in both sides of family so I‚Äôm paranoid this is an issue specific to weed use that hasn‚Äôt been discovered yet and I just fucked my future self over.

He integrates there, communicates with other Hydes, starts reflecting on his past and wanting to change for the better. So he goes back to his roots, he makes coffee, cakes, and other pastries for the community. And he becomes well liked in it, until one day Wednesday Addams shows up looking for information from Ms. Capri on how to help Enid.

She immediately sees Tyler and is shocked until Capri explains what is going on and how much Tyler has changed for the better.

Wednesday spends days at this community learning about werewolf alphas and while she's doing that, Tyler begins making her quads again and she hesitantly takes them.

Until one day, she overhears that some girl was looking for Tyler and she hears someone say how much this girl loves Tyler, and how Tyler spends a lot of time with this girl.

And Wednesday pretends she doesn't care, but she's lowkey jealous.

So one day disaster strikes and the hyde community is being raided by the next big bad or something.

And Wednesday is gearing up for a fight because anyone crazy enough to attack a Hyde community must be a new type of crazy.

So she's prepping for a fight and Tyler finds her and offers to help.

And Wednesday is like,

""Focus on getting your community and girlfriend out."" 

And Tyler is confused.

""What girlfriend?""

And before Wednesday can say anything.

This little girl maybe around 7 or 8 comes running up to Tyler in panic and is like.

""Tyler what's going on!?""

And Tyler is trying to calm her down and explain what's happening and Wednesday realizes this is the girl everyone in the community was talking about.

Tyler has become like a big brother to this little girl hyde.

And she feels completely stupid for letting herself get all worked up for nothing.

And then the icing on the cake the little girl would look at Wednesday and be like..

""Is this Miss Wednesday, Tyler?"" 

And Tyler would smile slightly and nod.

""Wow she's just like you describe her!! Spookily Beautiful!""

And that would be the moment I promptly pass out. üôÉ

It‚Äôs coming time for a flooring refresh, and sadly that means we‚Äôll need to bring in entirely new wood.

Our floors are a really lovely hexagon parquet, with individual 2‚Äù wide planks laid four-up and cut on a 60¬∞ angle into 16‚Äù long diamonds, with three diamonds together creating a single hexagon. The floors are part of what we originally loved about the house, though we knew we‚Äôd need to redo them someday. I‚Äôm hoping to maintain the pattern with new wood, but that‚Äôs a whole other post.

Today‚Äôs post is about whether I can reuse the old wood for a dining table. Each piece will be only about 0.25‚Äù thick, which is quite limiting, but I will have about 4-5 rooms‚Äô worth of it. 2‚Äù wide is about the right thickness for a dining table, and I could theoretically glue up the many pieces into an LVL-style lamination, with the side edges of each board becoming the new top and bottom of the table.

Honestly, just typing this up, I am convincing myself I don‚Äôt want to commit to this technique for a dining table. It‚Äôs a whole lot of milling and gluing for what would likely end up looking like a tabletop made of plywood edges. I love the idea of having a piece of the history of the house as furniture, but perhaps a coffee table or a sideboard would be a more appropriate use, and would be of a scale that doesn‚Äôt cause too much self-loathing.",1,1757188894.0,woodworking,0,1.0,False

1. $JOE Represents Everyone

We all know a Joe -your neighbor, your coworker, your gym buddy, your uncle at the BBQ. Joe is the guy who works hard, cracks jokes, pays bills, and dreams big. He‚Äôs not flashy, but he‚Äôs real.

$JOE was made to represent the everyday hero - the 9-to-5 grinder, the coffee addict, the dreamer, the doer, the underdog. By owning $JOE, you‚Äôre not betting on a corporation or an elite .you‚Äôre investing in the idea that ordinary people matter.

2. It‚Äôs More Than a Coin ,It‚Äôs a Movement.

Memecoins have rewritten the rules of finance, culture, and community. From Doge to Pepe, the power of memes has shown us that community is above everything.

$JOE is the next evolution. It‚Äôs not about worshiping a dog or chasing hype .it‚Äôs about celebrating us. The community is made of real people, building something fun, inclusive, and real.

When you buy $JOE, you‚Äôre not just holding a coin ,you‚Äôre part of a movement where every average Joe has a voice.


3.Simple, Honest, Real

$JOE isn‚Äôt trying to be your financial overlord. There‚Äôs no overcomplicated whitepaper or false promises. It‚Äôs as straightforward as the guy it‚Äôs named after: no fluff, no scammy nonsense, just a memecoin that‚Äôs fun, honest, and easy to get behind.

And in a space full of rug pulls and vaporware, that kind of honesty is rare.

4.Early Days = Big Potential

We‚Äôre still early. $JOE is just getting started. The community is growing, memes are flying, and momentum is building. Remember when everyone laughed at Dogecoin? Or missed the Shiba wave?
Don‚Äôt sleep on Joe. 
This might be the most down-to-earth coin on the market, but its potential? Anything but average.


Everyone‚Äôs chasing the next big thing. But sometimes the biggest thing is the one right in front of us: the average, hardworking, humble guy who shows up every day.

That‚Äôs Joe. That‚Äôs $JOE.
And that‚Äôs why it just might be the smartest coin you ever bought.

Buy $JOE. Be a part of the everyman revolution.
Because sometimes, the most powerful thing you can be is yourself.

1na981l,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1na981l/the_horror_in_the_cabin_part_1/,The HORROR in the CABIN ( part 1 ),"There is something I truly wish I forget even though i never will . Last year I went on a vacation with my family , me , my dad and my mom. It was a bnb cabin deep in forest. There were lakes rivers and the best of all ... Mountains . When we got there , it felt really peacefull and all quiet . Inside the cabin , there were some weird paintings hung on the wall which looked kinda off .I was really sleepy as it took a long ride to reach here so i just ignored them, I went to the bathroom , did my business and then went to sleep .



Next day when I woke up I saw 3 black cats sitting right in front of me at the end of the bed , staring at me , I shooshed them ,¬†¬†they walked off without flinching, then i told my mom about it , She said dad has gone hiking and probably left the backdoor open ""maybe he didn't wanna wake me up that's why he didn't take me hiking with him "" . My mom made me breakfast and pancakes , I bought a bunch of dvds so i plugged them in and watched some tv. 


As time kept passing , dad wasn't back , it went from dusk to dawn but he still wasn't back . Worried I told my mom to dial 911 ( my phone's battery was dead ) but she didn't¬†¬†"" MOM PLEASE DIAL THE NUMBER"" she told me she didn't wanna make such a big scenario out of it and assured me that he's gonna be okay telling me that he has went hiking DRUNK without telling us a million times before . Mom worked for the forensics , called 2 of dad's friends ( they were cops off duty) , it was already dark when her friends got here , one of them was a 6'3 blonde and the other one was a black dude .


We left the cabin (except my mom) and started searching for dad . I was with the blonde and the other guy went the seperate way which was really stupid . There was barely any network in the woods so we talked through walkie talkies , I shouted "" DAD?"" ""DAD"" ...there was no voice except the sound of owls , BUT THEN I SAW A FIGURE , HE LOOKED LIKE HIM , I CHASED HIM and I lost him . He could have been an outsider maybe a robber ? There was a basement outside of the cabin, ""What if dad's in there , maybe he was high you know¬†¬†tripped or something? "" I said to the blonde . It's locked kiddo , zero chances "" he said . At around 3 pm , My mom finally agreed to dial 911 except there was no signal. 



""Was i hallucinating who was that guy .. ? , Dad is gonna be okay , he is a really strong guy"" I said to myself alot of thoughts running in my mind ... A while later they all sat on the dining , chatting . "" This is the 3rd time he has went missing "" ~cop ,¬†¬†"" You know he probably got drunk like always and lost directions"" ~Mom , I said "" yeah but he never took this long to come back .

yesterday was the first time all week that we got to call for a substantial amount of time (2 hours), and he was rude the entire time. he said i wasn‚Äôt motivated, i told him i got a job at a coffee place, and he said ‚Äúit‚Äôs a minimum wage job, it won‚Äôt further your career.‚Äù at the time it made me cry, but now i‚Äôm just angry. like yeah, no shit, i‚Äôm saving up to go to engineering school, being a barista does not give me fucking engineering experience. 

then i was explaining why i thought he was rude and of course he shut down, only saying ‚Äúok.‚Äù ‚Äúsorry.‚Äù and that‚Äôs kinda where we left off.

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pok√©mon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf üôÉ

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

There is something I truly wish I forget even though i never will . Last year I went on a vacation with my family , me , my dad and my mom. It was a bnb cabin deep in forest. There were lakes rivers and the best of all ... Mountains . When we got there , it felt really peacefull and all quiet . Inside the cabin , there were some weird paintings hung on the wall which looked kinda off .I was really sleepy as it took a long ride to reach here so i just ignored them, I went to the bathroom , did my business and then went to sleep .



Next day when I woke up I saw 3 black cats sitting right in front of me at the end of the bed , staring at me , I shooshed them ,¬†¬†they walked off without flinching, then i told my mom about it , She said dad has gone hiking and probably left the backdoor open ""maybe he didn't wanna wake me up that's why he didn't take me hiking with him "" . My mom made me breakfast and pancakes , I bought a bunch of dvds so i plugged them in and watched some tv. 


As time kept passing , dad wasn't back , it went from dusk to dawn but he still wasn't back . Worried I told my mom to dial 911 ( my phone's battery was dead ) but she didn't¬†¬†"" MOM PLEASE DIAL THE NUMBER"" she told me she didn't wanna make such a big scenario out of it and assured me that he's gonna be okay telling me that he has went hiking DRUNK without telling us a million times before . Mom worked for the forensics , called 2 of dad's friends ( they were cops off duty) , it was already dark when her friends got here , one of them was a 6'3 blonde and the other one was a black dude .


We left the cabin (except my mom) and started searching for dad . I was with the blonde and the other guy went the seperate way which was really stupid . There was barely any network in the woods so we talked through walkie talkies , I shouted "" DAD?"" ""DAD"" ...there was no voice except the sound of owls , BUT THEN I SAW A FIGURE , HE LOOKED LIKE HIM , I CHASED HIM and I lost him . He could have been an outsider maybe a robber ? There was a basement outside of the cabin, ""What if dad's in there , maybe he was high you know¬†¬†tripped or something? "" I said to the blonde . It's locked kiddo , zero chances "" he said . At around 3 pm , My mom finally agreed to dial 911 except there was no signal. 



""Was i hallucinating who was that guy .. ? , Dad is gonna be okay , he is a really strong guy"" I said to myself alot of thoughts running in my mind ... A while later they all sat on the dining , chatting . "" This is the 3rd time he has went missing "" ~cop ,¬†¬†"" You know he probably got drunk like always and lost directions"" ~Mom , I said "" yeah but he never took this long to come back . I dialled 911 yet again there was no signal , I was sure at that moment the only way we can call the cops was by reaching a signal area . Frustrated I asked mom "" Why won't your friends drive to the city or anywhere near where there is network?"".

He is two years old, keeps scratching and biting our kids, gets into and onto things he should not (and knows he shouldn‚Äôt!), and is constantly knocking stuff off shelves and counters, getting onto the kitchen counters and ripping open packages and destroying food. We have 5 other cats and 4 young kids. I do not have time for this awful little menace. I have loved every other cat I‚Äôve ever met in my life but my God do I hate this one. 

The problem is my partner just loves this awful piece of distended rectum. I‚Äôve tried explaining the issues to him but then this little fart looks at my partner with the ‚Äúhelp me she‚Äôs so mean to me‚Äù eyes and they shine with absolute dishonesty while my partner thinks this potty-pawed gremlin hung the moon. Meanwhile I am quietly aneurysing in front of them because all I did was tell him to get off my dang shelves. 

But we just got some new furniture and Mr. Mischief was up on top of it about to smash several jars of cremated remains and a unicorn my daughter painted and I am done. I have no other place to keep this stuff. Every surface of our house is covered in crap because he won‚Äôt stay down and if we don‚Äôt block it off so he can‚Äôt get up there in the first place, he jumps up and knocks off everything we set down. 

We‚Äôve lost important bills because of this cat. He has smashed sentimental items, shredded baked goods in bags and opened containers I made for my children or my partner made for us, broken my favourite coffee mug, and put his gross bare butt on the kitchen counter and the dining table. I SAW THE BUTT PRINT AND I KNOW IT WAS HIM BECAUSE THE PAW PRINTS WERE THE SAME SIZE. He also keeps us awake half the night scratching uselessly at the sides of the litter box and surrounding walls, trying to force himself through the blinds, and starting fights with the other cats. Or scratching at the door if we try to shut him out. 

I want so badly to just let him run outside (he was born outside and my partner brought him indoors but this cat rushes the door every time it‚Äôs opened) and be rid of him forever but I know it would break my partners heart and I just can‚Äôt bring myself to do it. But I seriously cannot live with this cat anymore. It would kill my partner to give him away. They bonded when we lost a cat last year, and one of my kids has bonded with him too. We‚Äôve tried Ssscat and it does nothing. Water guns, completely ineffective. As soon as you leave the room, and half the time while you‚Äôre still watching, he‚Äôs back on his nonsense. Tape, spiky mats, tin foil, citrus scents, none of it works. 

So AITAH for wanting to get rid of him? I‚Äôve tried talking to my partner so many times but he just makes excuses and gives him a melatonin treat to calm him down. (Am I also TA for thinking a cat shouldn‚Äôt need melatonin every day just to not scratch my kids or break stuff???)",0,1757188325.0,AITAH,9,0.4,False

I wanted to share my story in hopes that it will help someone else. I've known a guy for seven years. We met online at a time when he was just getting out of a serious relationship with the mother of his child. At first, I wasn't that attracted when we met for a coffee. He seemed nice enough, but I knew he was dealing with a lot emotionally. I remember calling my sister after the meetup and telling her, ""Eh, he's not really my type."" But, I continued to date him. The first time we slept together it made me more attracted for obvious reasons. We had amazing sex. As time went on, we continued dating and having sex. It wasn't really a relationship, because we both acknowledged that we were dating other people. After a year of dating, we started to get more serious. He brought be over to meet his kid. I started to meet his family. But, deep down I knew he wasn't over the mother of his child. A lot of our fights would be centered around this. We'd stop talking and take several breaks for a short time of about two months here and there. It never lasted longer than a couple of months. He'd always come back because he wanted to have sex. Of course, I'd give into it as well. It's now been seven years. I'd say we've definitely grown closer as friends, but I don't think he truly cares or loves me. I think he is comfortable with me. We can't seem to let each other go. I will say, he's finally gotten over his ex, but he still seems to be attracted to a certain type of woman. He seems to be attracted to promiscuous women. I can tell he's not attracted to me. I've also learned that over the years of knowing him, he has a ton of trauma he's never fully dealt with. All my friends keep telling me to let him go. I know deep down, he doesn't fully respect me. He's told me I'm the one and that he loves me, but he won't commit to me. He still wants his freedom. I've learned to deal with his moods, and I've realized how much I care about him. I just deep down have doubts. I worry that he cheats. I worry that he still has feelings for his ex. I don't know if I'm paranoid or not. He's also not the best communicator and may have narcissistic traits, so everytime I bring up my concerns he gaslights me or says I'm trying to make drama where there isn't any. I just wonder if there are other women who are dealing with this type of situationship. The kind where it feels so real, but deep down you know it's not. I wouldn't say I have rose colored glasses on. I see everything very clearly. I just love a man who doesn't love me romantically. ",1,1757187417.0,Situationships,0,1.0,False

She doesn't quite recall where it's from, her best guess is a promotional party recipe (think Tupperware party for baking in 90s Europe). My mom is known for altering and putting her own spin on recipes so this is one of those family recipes. There's another recipe from the same bit of paper that I also love but it's more time consuming and I don't always have the ingredients on hand.

The bottom is a light and sweet chocolate cake. It has a coffee glaze and is covered in shredded coconut.

At the beginning of last year, we ended up fighting because I had fallen in love with her, which messed up the friendship dynamic. We no longer lived in the same city, but in December, I ended up having to move to hers because of some family issues. In February, we started talking again, being friends, and spending time together.



We always had a good connection and intimacy, as she was the kind of friend who talked about everything. Plus, we're both autistic and were diagnosed as adults, which made me understand why we identify with each other in so many ways. Anyway, for four months, we talked a lot every day. We'd meet up weekly to chat, have coffee, smoke, play games, and so on, and also exchange affection‚Äîsomething that was always very difficult for me because of my disorder, but I always felt comfortable with her. In short, she was very important to me, and even though I was in love before, and that feeling certainly still existed, even if not so superficially, I knew it wasn't what she wanted, so I was pretty calm about it and just wanted to enjoy the time we would have together, because I knew she wanted and intended to move to another city.



The last time we saw each other, she came over and we were talking about jobs because I was looking to change jobs. She told me she was too, and that she had an interview. I asked where, and she just said it was the same kind of place she already worked. She didn't want to ask more because she always had this thing of wanting to talk about something she's trying to do only after the process is over and she either succeeds or fails. That was on a Thursday, so we arranged to meet the following Thursday.



On Tuesday, I asked her if the job had worked out, and she said yes. On Wednesday, she canceled our hangout because she said she needed to take care of work. On Saturday, she told me her new job was in another city and she had already moved. I was very upset but tried to play it cool. We talked about it somewhat, but she said she needed to think about what to say and couldn't talk right then. Two weeks later, after I'd processed everything better, I brought it up again and said I was really upset, that I felt really bad, and that she should have just told me. After all, I'm sure I would have just supported her. In this regard, I also ended up bringing up a situation that happened that made me feel the same way. One of the months she was here, we went the entire month without seeing each other because she said she was overwhelmed with so many things. I respected that, obviously, because she's not obligated to see me or anything. I'm also autistic and understand this overload. However, she posted several stories about herself hanging out with other people, and I ended up feeling sad.



 I think I was wrong to tell her that, because honestly, it's none of my business. But I felt left out in the same way, especially since she told other people she was leaving, but not to me. Anyway, she told me she didn't tell me anything about the move because it wasn't about me, but that I made it so, and that she was very grateful for our friendship and for everything she learned from me, and so on, but that she didn't want to be friends andd keep things like that, didn't want to be pressured, and that she didn't like what I said about she disappearing for a month, and now we're no longer friends and don't talk anymore.



During that time when we were close again, she was super considerate of me, she said really nice things to me, she said she loved me and that she understood herself better and liked herself more because of me, she gave me lots of gifts, she was really an angel and I acted the same way, that's why I was really shocked by the sudden change in behavior and I can't understand if I'm really being such a jerk for ""demanding"" something so basic, which was telling me she was moving.",1,1757187230.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False
1na8iy5,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1na8iy5/girlfriend_has_bpd_not_sure_how_to_handle_an_issue/,"Girlfriend has BPD, not sure how to handle an issue","I [22M] have been with my girlfriend [21F] for little under a year now. She has been diagnosed with BPD few months after we got together and has been managing it really well - she has medication from her psychiatrist and attends therapy regularly. Overall, she has put in a lot of effort to get her diagnosis under control and she has been doing really well - she can regulate her emotions and communicates really well.

For the year or so, we have not run into any substantial issues and the relationship has been very fulfilling as well as pleasant. As a matter of fact, she has been an absolutely amazing girlfriend and her diagnosis never posed any issues. However, yesterday evening she turned into a completely different person in the matter of minutes and I am unsure how to approach this.

The issue is as follows: On the weekend we are supposed to travel abroad to visit a city in a neighbouring country. Her parents are supposed to meet us there, too. (They live abroad but over the year I have already met them several times on different occassions). The thing is, that one of my university classmates /(Female) also lives in the city and I made plans to go grab a coffee with her. For context we are arriving on Saturday, then in the afternoon me and my girlfriend will split up - I will visit the said friend and my gf will hang out with her parents. In the evening, the four of us are planning to have dinner togerther.

Initially everything was alright, my GF did point out that she is not 100% happy with my decision to visit a friend instead of being with her and her parents, but because it is a rare occassion for me to see the classmate and I am joining my GF and her parents in the evening, she is okay with it. At the same time, as she was describing how the situation is not ideal for her, she let me know that she does not want to be a controlling girlfriend and that my ask is completely reasonable.

So far so good, but then, suddenly, something switched yesterday evening. She confessed, that she is absolutely not happy with my decision to join my friend. The problem seems to be the following:

She has these negative emotions about our meeting

She logically understands that me meeting a friend that lives in a specific city abroad is reasonable

Because of this she would also feel very uncomfortable if she had to order me not to meet her as she would feel as a bad partner

She feels that her only options thus are: let me meet her and feel uncomfortable because of that, or ask me not to meet her and feel uncomfortable because she will feel controlling

The issue then stems from this perception that no matter what she does, she will feel negative, which she told me makes her feel really stressed and anxious. I understand that the brain of a person with BPD functions differently and I can see why being stuck with only two options that are both uncomfortable is rising her anxiety through the roof.

It then sort of escalated from there, she told me that, as her brain perceives me as the source of this absolutely horrible situation, she does not want to be close to me. She has suggested we do the trip separately and has asked me to sleep in the kitchen yesterday if possible. Unfortunately, we are both working full-time so me sleeping on a mattress in the kitchen felt unreasonable and so I declined and explained my point of view. I offered her to sleep in the kitchen if she feels uncomfortable in my presence.

Based on her words, she currently feels the love for me has dissappeared as she now has this negative connotation with me, although she understands that it is not logically based and is not acting on it. At the same time, she has explained, that because she was put in this unfortunate position by my existence she does not feel she likes me anymore, does not like our flat anymore, does not like the idea of travelling this weekend anymore and just overall feels like she would prefer that the whole situation just dissappears (as she does not see a solution that would be acceptable).

My question to those for you who have experience with BPD or partners with BPD, can you advice me on how to procced in this case? I want to make her feel as comfortable as possible, but I also do not see an easy way out. Is there something specific I can do to help her manage this? Maybe some way to effectively communicate with her that everything is going to be alright? Or is a better solution to give her space now and let her figure it out on her own? Tbh, I am completely lost as what to do, but still want to be a partner that she can rely on in these difficult situations. Any advice is highly appreciated, thank you!

Mount Paozu is a beautiful mountain on the outskirts of civilization. It is home to many megafauna and beautiful flowers. On this night however, this mountain would be anything but beautiful. The full moon illuminated the summit of the mountain. A very simple hut could be seen with 2 beds inside one made for an adult and one made for a child. In the house we see two people, an old man with a green hat, a jacket with yellow ring patterns and a white zipper, and wearing a black shirt underneath. The man also had a big grey mustache showing his age. He had quite a lot of wrinkles¬† and seemed to be pushing 90. The grandpa is accompanied by a little boy.¬†



	This lil boy is a 6 year old kid named Kakarot, but the name his grandpa gave him is Goku. Goku is very small wearing a blue gi with white rope strung around it and seems to have a brown tail. He is right now seen eating a bowl of rice happily, using his bare hands to gobble down the little grains of rice. Goku just smiles as he does so just as happy as can be. The boy then says,‚ÄùThank you Grandpa, this rice is so delicious.‚Äù¬†

Gohan just chuckles and simply says,‚ÄùOh you‚Äôre very welcome my boy. Now we‚Äôre going to rest for the night because tomorrow It‚Äôll be our most intense training session yet.‚Äù Goku glances back with excitement, his tail perking up as he responds by putting his fist up in a fist pump, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so excited. I can‚Äôt wait to train more with you.‚Äù Goku just happily chuckles before slowly getting ready for bed. Goku only has 1 other piece of clothing, a set of pajamas seemingly made to be slept in. Goku‚Äôs clothing is a simple set of a pajama shirt and pajama pants.¬†



Goku then cutely gives his grandpa a hug before saying,‚ÄùGoodnight grandpa. I love you.‚Äù Gohan happily hugs him back and pats Goku on the head saying, ‚ÄúGoodnight Goku.‚Äù¬†

With that Goku tries to go to sleep as Gohan happily dozes off.¬† Goku is seen trying to go to bed but no matter what he can‚Äôt. Goku for a bit can‚Äôt put his finger on it until‚Ä¶he feels himself needing to relieve himself. Goku out of naivety and knowing what time of the month goes outside. Goku then hums to himself and finds a bush before pulling his pants and peeing on the ground. Goku hums as he pees, hoping to just pee and be back. However, as he pees he is then met with something, he hears the sound of a laser rifle and goku, not knowing what it is exactly but knowing a bit dodges.¬†

The laser rifle comes from a mysterious man who seems to be small and has blue skin with yellow eyes that are in the shape of candy corn. The man is wearing a white suit with a mysterious symbol. The man then simply states, ‚ÄúGalactic Patrol Jaco. You are the saiyan Kakarot, correct?‚Äù Goku then nods but then asks, ‚ÄúH-how do you know my name?‚Äù Jaco then says, ‚ÄúI am the one responsible for this quadrant and I have come to make sure you‚Äôre neutralized. You are a saiyan and a threat to earth?‚Äù¬†

Goku then innocently asks,‚ÄùA- a Threat?‚Äù Jaco nods before pointing his blaster at goku, ‚ÄúYes, the saiyans have caused widespread havoc and destruction across the cosmos and right now. You can either come quietly or I can make sure you‚Äôre never a threat.‚Äù Goku, who looks a bit irritated and enraged by Jaco then gets into a fighting stance. Goku was so nice and kind with Grandpa Gohan. Why was this man thinking he was a threat? Goku‚Äôs mind was confused but then goku states, ‚ÄúNo I‚Äôm never leaving my grandpa!‚Äù Jaco then guffaws and says,‚ÄùGrandpa? Kakarot, do you remember your parents.‚Äù Kakarot then nods before smacking Jaco with a great punch which surprises Jaco. 	Track 2:[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3\_hFpr3FvuI&list=PL9A888F268625E56E&index=7	](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_hFpr3FvuI&list=PL9A888F268625E56E&index=7)With this Jaco duels with Kakarot. The little boy is getting in close and while he isn‚Äôt as strong as any of the saiyans Jaco has seen, Kakarot is still quite formidable. However, Jaco feels a bit odd. Kakarot doesn‚Äôt seem bloodthirsty.¬† Kakarot is fighting pretty defensively all things considered. He is purposely using punches smacks and finger pokes made to just injure and not even gravely injure or do any permanent damage. The way he dodges seems also way to graceful compared to other saiyans. He dodges with skill rather than just raw power. Jaco then pulls up a scouter to see his battle power since the galactic patrol has scouters too.¬†

Goku‚Äôs Power Level apparently reads 25. Jaco reads this and it‚Äôs almost baffling. It should be way higher considering how he‚Äôs fighting. If he didn‚Äôt see the scouter‚Äôs reading, he‚Äôd think goku‚Äôs power level was 300. Goku simply asks, ‚ÄúPlease, I don‚Äôt want to fight. I just want to go to bed. Can you please just stop?‚Äù¬†

Jaco then shoots a hole through goku‚Äôs shoulder saying, ‚ÄúNo way saiyan scum! I cannot allow you to live on this planet. Resisting arrest means you‚Äôve signed your death warrant saiyan.‚Äù Then slams goku to the ground and prepares to fire a laser blast through the kid‚Äôs head. Goku thinks its all over and looks up at Jaco but in doing so, he looks up at the moon.¬†

Grandpa Gohan is seen waking up in a cold sweat sensing this. Gohan then panics, ‚ÄúNo it can‚Äôt be!‚Äù Gohan then rushes outside to see goku turning into an Oozaru. Gohan had been fearing this and then saw something, that random guy beside him. Gohan knows goku wouldn‚Äôt intentionally look at the moon. Especially knowing how it could mean going great ape. So something must‚Äôve forced him. Gohan rushes over and tackles jaco with Jaco winded. How was this earthling stronger than him by so much?! Jaco even gasps for air asking, ‚ÄúWhat are you doing citizen?! You are not to interfere with a patrolman‚Äôs duty.‚Äù¬†



Gohan however was having none of this. Knowing goku can‚Äôt control this form he shouts, ‚ÄúWhat have you done with my grandson?!‚Äù Jaco simply says, ‚ÄúThat is not your grandson, that is a saiyan.‚Äù¬†

Gohan then smacks Jaco saying, ‚ÄúI raised him since he was 2, he looks up to me, he cares about me. We spar together, train together. He is my grandson. He is my responsibility. So let me ask again.‚Äù Gohan then slams Jaco to the ground; ‚ÄúWHAT DID YOU TO HIM?!‚Äù¬†

Jaco coughs up blood astounded by how protective this random earthling is to Goku. Jaco then responds, ‚ÄúI was here to arrest him and was going to kill him when he fought me.‚Äù Gohan‚Äôs eyes widened and looked almost rageful. Gohan usually had a calm head but this was different. Goku was just minding his business and Gohan saw what goku was doing. Goku was simply out here to potty. Gohan then says with a calm rage, ‚ÄúLeave this planet immediately. I don‚Äôt want you to ever hurt my grandson again.‚Äù¬†

Jaco wanted to protest but, he didn‚Äôt want to die. Not like this, not to some earthling he couldn‚Äôt account for. Jaco with that retreats to a spaceship.¬†

[Track 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmp2R4ZDNHk)

Gohan then look over and saw it. Goku was now fully transformed into a great ape. His eyes looked feral and he just started stomping and rampaging without thought or anything. It was like Goku wasn‚Äôt even there anymore and the feral malice of the war-like saiyans were in control. Goku screamed and screeched, banging his chest as he started tearing down trees. Gohan without hesitation rushes downwards to face goku. He knows he could die but if Goku is left unchecked he could destroy the forest or even worst kill so many people. Gohan couldn‚Äôt allow that.¬†

Gohan rushes down and gets into a fighting stance. He knows from before he can‚Äôt face this beast headon but he might be able to cut off Goku‚Äôs tail. He then rushes over and takes a deep breath. Gohan then says, ‚ÄúMy Grandson, I‚Äôm sorry for what I must do.‚Äù Gohan then stretches his hands out when he gets near Goku and shouts,‚ÄùTHUNDER SHOCK SUPRISE!‚Äù¬†

Gohan then shoots out static electricity from his hands which paralyzes Goku in place. He can‚Äôt move¬† but he then stares at Gohan. Goku‚Äôs mouth charges a beam and goku is being weakened out of being a great ape just by this. Gohan might not need to cut off his tail after all. However before goku fully detransforms a beam is fired which blasts a hole through gohan‚Äôs chest as Gohan screams in pain. Goku fully transformed and now is weakened but still okay. However, seeing gohan he realizes what happened and knows what he did.¬†

[Track 4:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWXtdYwLFSA)

Tears fall from goku‚Äôs eyes as he cries, ‚ÄúGrandpa! No, please! Don‚Äôt die. Please don‚Äôt go.‚Äù Grandpa then says, ‚ÄúGoku, I‚Äôm glad to have met you.‚Äù¬†

Goku then cries and punches himself and cries, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all my fault, if I wasn‚Äôt a stupid saiyan. If I was a good-‚Äù¬†

Grandpa then slowly hugs goku and gives a smile saying, ‚ÄúKakarot, listen me to my grandson, my beautiful boy. Those tears show your kindness. Other saiyans wouldn‚Äôt feel remorse. They‚Äôd just turn the other way and move on. That kind heart you have, it‚Äôs always present.‚Äù Goku then cries before whimpering, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry grandpa.‚Äù Grandpa then whispers, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, I forgive you. I just want you to remember, to keep training, keep growing in mind and strength. And for my sake, for everyone‚Äôs, never lose that caring heart.‚Äù With that grandpa gohan passes on and goku‚Äôs tears fall even more. Goku knew Grandpa Gohan isn‚Äôt his actual grandpa but his kindness was so heartfelt.¬† Goku had learned so much and felt so moved by his Grandpa.¬†

With that happening, Kakarot goes to a secluded area of the forest. His tears never stop falling as he walks. The guilt is overwhelming, the guilt of killing his grandpa but he presses on for his grandpa. With his own two hands he builds out of wood a casket to put his grandpa in.¬†

A casket with the symbol of one of his gi though he doesn‚Äôt know what the gi symbol his. He also uses his own fist to slowly and methodically carve away a stone. It takes several days for the stone but he eventually makes it into a tombstone. The tombstone then reads, ‚ÄúTo Grandpa Gohan, a wonderful strange man who had a great mind, great heart, and great strength who made me the kind person I am now.‚Äù Goku then looks at the finished gravesite. With the clasp of his two hands he makes a vow. A vow to himself and his grandpa. ‚ÄúI swear to you Grandfather, I will keep training and surpass my limits every day, to become stronger than before, to make new friends, and to protect this world you called home. I promise you, compassion.‚Äù¬†

OP Variant 1:[ Makafushigi Adventure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROnd7d4axHo) (Though as this is the first chapter this isn‚Äôt going to be the standard intro and instead a montage of various characters we‚Äôll see. The intro would be footage of goku doing some training over the course of 4 years, Bulma scolding Jaco and finding out about the dragon balls from Tights and finding she has 1 in her basement. We also see Oolong doing his kidnapping of the 3 girls and being shocked at how much they push him around. Yamcha is in the shadows doing his usual bandit stuff with Puar oddly fighting alongside Yamcha. It also shows chi-chi ruling fire mountain with her father before eventually getting bored and wanting to find something other than diplomacy to do and deciding to find a friend.¬†

It also shows what happens with King Gurumes starting out as just a simple asshole with good rules to a straight up villain when he finds 1 ruby and wants more and the power and his own ambitions corrupting him showing how he corrupts himself. We see Pansy‚Äôs father being killed by Bongo and Pansy going on a journey to find people to help her fight while also training. We also see a mysterious woman showing 1 of the dragon balls to Gurumes with a stoic face while showing she can shapeshift before being fitted with some military outfit. All of this being within the 4 years between the death of grandpa gohan and when Bulma sets out for mount Paozu when she turns 16.) 

The montage has finally ended and we see Kakarot doing some prayer to kami before clapping his hands together. Kakarot comedically polishes the dragon ball with a towel and feather before seeing it sparkle greatly. Kakarot looks about the same as he did those 4 years ago and seems to be the same naive happy go lucky saiyan with the great heart. Kakarot just chuckles before declaring, ‚ÄúAfter I find an apple and a fish to eat, I‚Äôm going to start doing some intense training. Crystal Ball, I‚Äôll see you again soon.‚Äù Kakarot is seen hopping around the forest. The sunlight is shining brightly, the pterodactyls are flying and so are the birds and bees. The tigers, panthers, wolves and other wildlife scurry around finding food and the winds blow calmly over the greenery. The sky is blue and sunny and the clouds leisurely stroll by in the sky. The waterfall rush down with excitement as the waters rapidly swim by.

[Track 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzNeFUMQZ5E&list=PL9A888F268625E56E&index=5)¬†

	He then finds a tree and happily eats an apple from it. The apple seems very tasty and he eats it with glee. The soft juicy flavor of it plus the crunchy texture of the skin makes his eyes widen with glee. Kakarot takes a moment while sitting on the tree to gaze at the sun. The sun feels so warm and so comforting compared to the moon. The sun smiles down at goku and goku just simply chuckles. *It‚Äôs great to be here.*¬†

	As Goku finishes his meal of an apple he exclaims, ‚ÄúThat was go delicious. Thank you tree!‚Äù Goku gives the tree a hug before throwing his clothes onto land near a ravine. He then dives happily into the ravine, a big splash being made from Goku diving from so high and displacing a lot of water. Water splashes all around even creating a bit of a rainbow. In the water, giant fish and sealife could be seen, with the biggest fish being an biggest one. Goku then grabs it and says, ‚ÄúAlright, you‚Äôre coming with me.‚Äù Goku then punches the fish and yanks it out of the water which knocks it unconscious. Goku with that dries himself off with¬† some leaves before putting back on his clothes.¬†



	Meanwhile, Goku is simply stretching and before saying, ‚ÄúAlright, when I get back home you‚Äôre going to last quite a while. I bet you‚Äôll last a couple days.‚Äù Goku just chuckles before softly and gently patting the fish. Before he leaves though he¬† reaches down into his pocket and throws the apple core.¬†

It‚Äôs not much but goku throws it in as a gift for the other sealife. Goku is seen humming to himself as he throws the fish over his back, strutting back up the mountain with a gleeful smile. As this is happening, a teenage girl is seen checking a radar while driving around the mountain. The girl is dressed in a pink dress with the name bulma written on it, a red ribbon bow on her blue hair, a purple scarf and purple socks that go with her blue sneakers. The teenage girl simply takes out a device that looks like a stopwatch but has a green grid interface with 2 yellow dots showing. The girl then smiles before muttering happily to herself, ‚ÄúGood. So I‚Äôm going in the right direction.‚Äù 

The teenage girl then gets into her car before turning the key to it and drives up the mountain. The teenage¬† girl was focused and she remembers back a bit. The girl pondered, ‚ÄúJaco warned me about some sort of monkey kid in the forest. Jaco called it a saiyan, but Jaco‚Äôs always been weird. I don‚Äôt know if I should trust him or not on this. Eh, I‚Äôll figure that out when it comes a lot.‚Äù The girl had become so lost in thought but then soon realized a little boy was in front of her. The teen started to scream and Goku tried to run away but then got hit by the truck and slammed into a rock.¬†

The teen looked around thinking,‚ÄùHuh, did I kill him? I really hope I didn‚Äôt. My dad would ground me for life if I-‚Äù Thankfully goku is seen dusting himself off. Goku then looks angry. The teenage girl asks, ‚ÄúWait, you‚Äôre still alive?!‚Äù Goku grunts and says, ‚ÄúYes I‚Äôm still alive, and if you wanted some fish you could‚Äôve asked me nicely.‚Äù Goku then goes to lift the car with the teenage girl screaming, ‚ÄúWhat are you doing?!‚Äù Goku then throws the car far away with the teenage girl looking shocked as Goku does it.¬† Goku then pulls out the power pole before saying, ‚ÄúNow that should teach you a lesson monster.‚Äù¬†

Goku then felt something plink off his head. It hurt a bit but he just turned around. She is seen poked out the car with a gun drawn. Goku then realizes, he might‚Äôve hurt someone. ‚ÄúWait, are you a human?‚Äù¬† The teenage girl asking, ‚ÄúWait, did you not know?‚Äù Goku looks a bit horrorstruck as he tries to hit himself with the powerpole but realizing goku isn‚Äôt a threat, and they just got up on the wrong foot, Teenage girl grabs goku trying her best to restrain goku but goku looking confused. The teenage girl then asks, ‚ÄúWhat are you doing hurting yourself you idoit?‚Äù Goku then answers, ‚ÄúI promised my grandpa to protect this place and if you‚Äôre a human and I hurt you I broke that promise.‚Äù¬†

[Track 7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vODHNCYC3e8&list=PLksHfEhfGHr394kCptbS-0NZC59dsKFVN&index=12)

Bulma then sees the saiyan tail goku has. At first, Bulma is conflicted but still she says, ‚ÄúWoah woah woah. I‚Äôm fine.‚Äù Bulma puts her hands up and goku looks around to check. Goku takes a deep breath and puts the powerpole back before apologizing, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry I threw you.‚Äù The teenage girl then reassures him, ‚ÄúNo it‚Äôs fine. I should‚Äôve paid more attention. I‚Äôm surprised at how you could lift that car.‚Äù Goku then asks, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs a car?‚Äù The girl then points to the damaged vehicle. Goku then says, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a car, i thought it was a monster.‚Äù¬†

The teenage girl looks agitated before taking a deep breath. This whole encounter was a bit odd for her. She decides to walk with goku. She then asks, ‚ÄúSo kid, what‚Äôs your name?‚Äù Goku then asks, ‚ÄúWhich one?‚Äù She then asks a bit shocked, ‚ÄúWHAT DO YOU MEAN WHICH ONE!?‚Äù Goku then says, ‚ÄúThe one my mom gave me or the one my grandpa gave me.‚Äù The girl then responds, ‚ÄúThe one you go by the most often!‚Äù Goku then says, ‚ÄúOh my name‚Äôs son Goku then.‚Äù The girl then takes a deep breath before saying, ‚ÄúWell my name is Bulma.‚Äù Goku starts laughing a bit. Bulma then asks, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs so funny?‚Äù Goku answers while giggling as he strolls, ‚ÄúWell it‚Äôs such a weird name.‚Äù Bulma pouts before crossing her arms saying, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not that weird.‚Äù¬†

Goku then asks as he walks, ‚ÄúSo Bulma, what were you coming here for?‚Äù Bulma then gives a smirk back at goku before saying, ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm looking to find 7 crystal balls called Dragon Ball. It‚Äôs said if you find all 7 and say a certain set of words you can make the eternal dragon shenron appear, and he‚Äôll grant you any wish.‚Äù Goku then looks very intrigued and asks, ‚ÄúAny wish?‚Äù¬†

Bulma then nods saying, ‚ÄúYep! Any single wish.‚Äù Goku then asks, ‚ÄúSo what are you going to wish for?‚Äù Bulma then answers, ‚ÄúI wanna wish for the perfect boyfriend.‚Äù Goku tilts his head asking, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs a boyfriend?‚Äù Bulma almost falls down hearing this. Bulma then asks, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know what a boyfriend is either?!‚Äù¬† Goku shakes his head saying, ‚ÄúNope.‚Äù Bulma facepalms before thinking in her head, ‚Äú*This kid is so clueless. I‚Äôm going to have to see what he does and doesn‚Äôt know.‚Äù* ¬†¬†Goku then adorably asks, ‚ÄúSo Bulma what does this dragon ball look like?‚Äù¬†

Bulma then grabs one and says, ‚ÄúOh I can show you because I have one.‚Äù Bulma pulls out a dragon ball and it is some orange crystalline ball with two red starts inside it. Goku looks astounded before exclaiming, ‚ÄúOh I have 1 I have 1!‚Äù Bulma then asks, ‚ÄúYou do?‚Äù Goku then rushes off jumping from tree to tree while holding his fish. Goku is seen rushing ahead and Bulma realizing she‚Äôs being left behind rushes behind goku comically running and screams, ‚ÄúKID WAIT UP!‚Äù¬†

Bulma and Goku are seen running but soon goku stops because his stomach starts grumbling. It‚Äôs been a bit of time but he‚Äôs already kinda hungry. Goku looks at the raw fish and says, ‚ÄúWelp I was going to wait but-‚Äù Bulma then sees goku about to eat into the raw fish and despite being okay with eating some wildlife, Bulma then asks, ‚ÄúWhat the hell are you doing?‚Äù Goku then asks, ‚ÄúAbout ot eat it why?‚Äù Bulma then says, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not going to cook it or anything?‚Äù Goku then asks, ‚ÄúHow do you cook?‚Äù Bulma‚Äôs eyes widen alot. Bulma then asks, ‚ÄúDo you know how to cook?‚Äù Goku then responds, ‚ÄúNo I usually just grow plants and eat whatever food I want that day. I thought you just kill the fish and eat it.‚Äù¬†



	Bulma smirks and says, ‚ÄúGoku, I want to have the dragon ball when we get to where you have it.‚Äù Goku then holds his pole defensively screaming, ‚ÄúNo way I‚Äôm just going to give it to you!‚Äù Bulma then says, ‚ÄúOh I have an offer you can‚Äôt refuse.‚Äù Bulma then flashes herself for a bit thinking this might entice him but she does have a backup plan. Goku however looks and asks, ‚ÄúWhy do I want your butt?‚Äù Bulma then sighs realizing she can‚Äôt just seduce Goku. Bulma then simply says, ‚ÄúThen how about this, I‚Äôll make this fish taste better than anything you‚Äôve ever tasted!‚Äù Goku eyes widen in surprise and intrigue but then he simply responds, ‚ÄúWhat? There‚Äôs no way you can do that.‚Äù Bulma chuckles smugly making a face that mixes cute and prideful as she declares, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Bulma, the cutest and smartest scientist ever. Of course I‚Äôll be able to!‚Äù¬†

	[Track 1 plays here again.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6995upmiavg&list=PL9A888F268625E56E&index=4)

	With that bulma gathered firewood. It was a huge slog because Bulma isn‚Äôt used to doing such manual labor. However, Bulma also was determined. She wouldn‚Äôt stop until she got all 7 dragon balls. She wanted the perfect lover and she started daydreaming about the perfect lover. Goku meanwhile sat down while drawing in the dirt, trying to occupy his time. Goku‚Äôs attention span when not in combat wasn‚Äôt the greatest.¬† Goku hums to himself and his tail waggles a bit.¬†

	 Bulma expects to simply hate this, doing this manual work and having to collect wood just to satisfy this little boy and get the dragon ball but oddly, she starts getting into it. Bulma finds random logs and pieces of wood and feels herself growing slightly stronger as she does this simple thing. It‚Äôs odd. For someone from the city like her, it felt both exhausting yet also invorgiating. Her goal motivated her but something slight to this, something intrinsic in the back of her head kept feeling pumped. Bulma eventually brings all the wood to the area near where goku and the fish is.¬†

Bulma then rumages into her bag and grabs a lighter and some seasonings. Bulma usually uses salt and stuff sparingly but she did promise goku to make the best tasting fish. Bulma isn‚Äôt the biggest culinary expert but she does know her stuff when it comes to it and does know how things cook being a very well read woman.¬†

When Bulma returns Goku then asks, ‚ÄúHow long is it going to take?‚Äù Bulma then says, ‚ÄúWait a bit, it‚Äôs going to take 1 hour at the latest to finish this fish.‚Äù Goku reaches near the flame before feeling a sharp pain goku then screams,‚ÄùYEOWCH!‚Äù Goku blows his hand and asks, ‚ÄúWhat is this magic?‚Äù Bulma sighs saying, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not magic, it‚Äôs fire. How much do you know?‚Äù Goku then says, ‚ÄúI know how to read, I can write a bit, and I can count up to 10.‚Äù Bulma then asks, ‚ÄúSo you don‚Äôt know much.‚Äù Goku nods a bit embarrassed. Bulma then groans to herself realizing how arduous it‚Äôll be.¬†

A woman in an air force outfit is seen walking by with a big man in the some outfit walking by too. The woman simply says, ‚ÄúAh well that was easy. I thought this place would be more guarded.‚Äù The big man chuckles saying, ‚ÄúOnce king Gurumes gets all the dragon balls we‚Äôll be living in luxury.‚Äù Close up the woman‚Äôs eyes are seen which seem to be completely black. The woman chuckles and remarks, ‚ÄúThat is, if he still is alive.‚Äù¬†

	After 1 hour, Bulma is seen finishing the fish and goku‚Äôs eyes are locked right onto it. Goku was hoping to see what Bulma was feeling. Bulma then sighs before saying, ‚ÄúThe fish is done.‚Äù Goku then manages to chop the fish into little pieces. With that goku tries to taste the fish. He was hopeful and he was even more excited. His eyes glistened and he almost shed tears. Goku‚Äôs tail started wagging like an excited puppy. Goku then exclaims, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so delicious!‚Äù Goku then in an instant hugs bulma. Bulma pushes goku back saying, ‚ÄúGet off of me kid!‚Äù Bulma then groans before checking her radar. Bulma decides to put the rest of the fish in a capsule and when goku sees this his eyes look surprise. Goku then exclaims, ‚ÄúYou must be a magician!‚Äù Bulma then chuckles a bit before saying, ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm not. This is just a device I use to shrink into small lil pellets for storage and use later. It‚Äôs a system my mother and father designed and I improved upon.‚Äù Goku‚Äôs eyes are in wonder. Bulma then sighs before snarkily saying, ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre done gawking, I‚Äôve got some bad news for you.‚Äù Goku then asks, ‚ÄúHuh what is it?‚Äù Bulma then says, ‚ÄúIf my radar is correct, your dragon ball isn‚Äôt there anymore.‚Äù Goku then rushes off and Bulma screams, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt just leave me behind!‚Äù¬†



	After a bit of time they get to the hut and Goku sees instead of a dragon ball there‚Äôs a coin. Goku looking utterly angered smacks the grown throwing a temper tantrum. ‚ÄúNo. NO! NO! NO!‚Äù Bulma felt the ground shake a bit as goku pounded the ground. Goku teared up a bit but before Goku could do anything rash Bulma gave a giggle. Goku wipes his face asking, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs so funny.‚Äù Bulma then says, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going after them, goku!‚Äù Goku then says, ‚ÄúBut where did they go?‚Äù Bulma then points to the sky and it seems like a bird. Goku then asks, ‚ÄúIs that a bird?‚Äù Bulma then responds, ‚ÄúNo you dummy it‚Äôs a plane. And we‚Äôre going to follow it.‚Äù Goku then tilts his head in confusion. ‚ÄúHow?‚Äù Bulma then throws a capsule outside with the number on it being labeled 5. Goku then sees a giant contraption with engines and hears the bubbling of water. Goku then screams, ‚ÄúANOTHER MONSTER?!‚Äù Bulma then screams, ‚ÄúFor KAMI‚ÄôS SAKE! This isn‚Äôt a monster, this is a water-powered jet jet. They're everywhere.‚Äù Bulma then goes and grabs goku carrying goku into the hydrojet saying, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to follow that plane!‚Äù¬†

The two then rocket off into the sky and on a bit of the other side is the woman from before and the man. The woman is seen locking the box where the dragon ball is. The woman says, ‚ÄúAlright so you know where we‚Äôre headed to next?‚Äù The man then nods saying, ‚ÄúYep, I know exactly where. We‚Äôre headed to one of the various villages near east city, why do you ask Pasta?‚Äù Pasta takes off her helmet for a bit before saying, ‚ÄúBongo, I‚Äôm sick and tired of working under Gurumes. He‚Äôs always so vague and always makes us do random shit. We‚Äôve been loyal to him for 15 years and nothing has gotten better.‚Äù¬†¬†

Bongo then sighs and replies, ‚ÄúYeah but with this he may look at us with favor.‚Äù Pasta rolls her eyes but then checks the radar. ‚ÄúWhat the?‚Äù Pasta then looks to the side and sees a teenage girl and a little boy. ‚ÄúGive us back the dragon ball!‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôll give you back your coin too!‚Äù Pasta then smirks before saying back to the two, ‚ÄúOh you wanna make demands to me, keep following and I‚Äôll make sure you‚Äôre shot out the sky.‚Äù Bulma says, ‚ÄúNo way in hell!‚Äù Pasta then says, ‚ÄúBongo, you steer, and I‚Äôll fire and charge the bazooka.‚Äù Bongo then says, ‚ÄúGot it!‚Äù¬†

[Track 8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwuqlC32EHs&list=PLksHfEhfGHr394kCptbS-0NZC59dsKFVN&index=16)

Bullets then rain from down there and Goku and Bulma feel the brunt of it. Bulma evasively steers the jet and Goku says, ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt seem to wanna give it back.‚Äù Bulma then says, ‚ÄúI guess we have to fight then!‚Äù Bulma then starts firing bullets from her own water jet. Bullets keep flying across the blue sky. The two pass through clouds and soar around. We see sights of pterodactyls and one such one tries to grab onto the hydrojet but gets shot away.¬†

Bongo is looking quite nervous and whispers, ‚ÄúPasta, we‚Äôre going to be shot down ourselves if we take any more damage and they have faster bullets so we can‚Äôt dodge or outgun them.‚Äù Pasta then says, ‚ÄúThen it‚Äôs a good thing I have the bazooka ready.‚Äù Pasta aims a bit with the scope of the bazooka targeting closely while standing atop it. With a bit of skill she fires the giant explosive round.¬† Bulma at first is confident and even dodges with the plane. Bulma then taunts, ‚ÄúHah you missed!‚Äù However, the round seems to curve and hits Bulma‚Äôs plane from behind.¬†

Pasta grabs a rose and chuckles before sniffing it. ‚ÄúAhh the scent of victory. There‚Äôs no way they survived that explosion.‚Äù The plane indeed explodes but goku grabbed bulma and secretly jumped out. Bulma then asks,‚ÄùGOKU?! Are you crazy?!‚Äù Goku then asks, ‚ÄúDid you wanna be blown up?‚Äù Bulma then says, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm surviving a fall from this height.‚Äù Goku then says confidently,‚ÄùDon‚Äôt worry we will.‚Äù¬†

Goku then expertly grabs the powerpole and wedges it into the edge. Bulma and Goku then slide down the cliff edge before getting near the edge.¬† Goku then asks, ‚ÄúYou okay bulma?‚Äù Bulma then nods but realizes she‚Äôs urinating and shouts, ‚ÄúYeah, I pissed myself though.‚Äù Goku then chuckles a bit and Bulma despite the adrenaline chuckles too. Goku then with expert grace and precision launches himself off the wall before saying, ‚ÄúThere, but how are we going to find them.‚Äù Bulma then shrugs saying, ‚ÄúOh we‚Äôll find them eventually. I think we should just find the other dragon balls first though.‚Äù¬†

Goku nods saying, ‚ÄúSounds like a plan.‚Äù Bulma then asks, ‚ÄúI do wanna ask why you were so confident? We literally could‚Äôve went splat against the water.‚Äù Goku then simply says, ‚ÄúOh I knew by digging my powerpole into the edge I could slow down the descent of us enough to survive. I do it sometimes when I‚Äôm training.‚Äù Bulma‚Äôs eyes widen, Goku might be as dumb as he thinks. Bulma then uses a different capsule and creates a car. With that the two are off. Bulma rides with goku across the forest and far away.¬†

Nothing of note happens for the rest of the day as they simply just ride on. Though when its nighttime goku seems a bit panicked. Goku‚Äôs tail twitches in fear. Bulma groans angrily as she hears this. Goku‚Äôs been such a wildcard and though charming is an irritant at this point. Bulma then asks, ‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù Goku then whispers, ‚ÄúI need to be inside.‚Äù Bulma then asks, ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù Goku then responds, ‚ÄúTrust ME! I do!‚Äù Bulma decides for once not to question it and pulls over at a clearing. Bulma then uses one of her capsules to pop out a small house. Bulma then sassily says, ‚ÄúHere we go, now you don‚Äôt have to be a big baby.‚Äù Goku looks pissed off but then lets it go. Bulma tilts an eyebrow seeing this. When they get inside Bulma can see how bad goku smells. Bulma never noticed before because other scents blended it away but now it‚Äôs clear. Bulma then asks, ‚ÄúGoku you smell terrible. Have you ever taken a bath?!‚Äù Goku then asks, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs a bath?!‚Äù Bulma then asks a question in the back of her mind. ‚ÄúGoku how old are you?‚Äù Goku then counts on his fingers and says, ‚Äú10.‚Äù Bulma blushes a bit realizing she not only tried to seduce a 10 year old but literally showed goku her panties. Bulma also realizing because of his age and his clear lack of knowledge about certain stuff, Bulma tells Goku, ‚ÄúAlright then, I‚Äôm going to bathe you and tell you all about girls okay.‚Äù 



	Goku tilts her head a bit. Goku then gets naked and so does Bulma. Goku looks at Bulma at shock saying, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have balls?‚Äù Bulma then says, ‚ÄúGoku, women don‚Äôt have balls. This is our private part kay. It‚Äôs called a vagina.‚Äù Goku then asks, ‚ÄúWhy does it look different.‚Äù Bulma then says, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs because it‚Äôs made for birthing stuff. It‚Äôs where pee and stuff come out too.‚Äù Goku then reaches over but Bulma smacks goku‚Äôs hand scolding, ‚ÄúGoku no.‚Äù  Goku tilts his head asking, ‚ÄúWhat why?‚Äù Bulma then explain, ‚ÄúThis is my private part. You aren‚Äôt allowed to touch it without permission.‚Äù Goku then asks, ‚ÄúIs it the same for my balls?‚Äù Bulma nods and asks, ‚ÄúSo then goku, can I bathe you. You‚Äôll feel so much better.‚Äù Goku nods. So Bulma takes a bubble bath and helps goku take a bubble bath. Bulma is both irritated but relieved. Bulma realizes how bad things could‚Äôve went if she didn‚Äôt explain this fast because Goku from what she can tell just tends to do stuff and doesn‚Äôt know alot. As She washes goku‚Äôs back Bulma asks, ‚ÄúSo Goku, do you know who your parents are?‚Äù Goku then sighs before saying, ‚ÄúYeah,but they‚Äôre long dead now. I remember a lot about them but they told me one thing before they died. They told me to survive.‚Äù Bulma‚Äôs eyes widen as she asks, ‚ÄúGoku, what is your other name?‚Äù Goku then sighs before responding, ‚ÄúMy other name, my saiyan name, it‚Äôs kakarot or Kakarotto depending on who says it.

	Bulma then sighs before thinking, ‚ÄúThis guy really is a saiyan, but he‚Äôs not like any saiyan I‚Äôve heard of. And Jaco did seem to be reckless. Maybe I don‚Äôt need to be as cautious.‚Äù Bulma then says, ‚ÄúWell then goku, I‚Äôm going to find you a great home to stay in once we‚Äôre done with this journey.‚Äù Goku then asks, ‚ÄúWill I be able to train and push my limits like before.‚Äù Bulma nods and happily responds, ‚ÄúEvery single day.‚Äù 



	 With that Bulma dries off goku with a towel and Bulma herself dries off. Goku is then given some panties, some pajama pants, and a normal t-shirt. Bulma doesn‚Äôt have underwear so this will have to do for now. Bulma just wears a pink night gown with panties underneath. Bulma is just seen using a hairdryer while alone in thought. A Bunch of thoughts of annoyance but also a slight but not huge amount of empathy. She was just going to use him to help her get the dragon balls but maybe, she can have more of a relationship than just that. Maybe she can be goku‚Äôs friend. Goku is seen running around before trying some of the coffee. Goku then spits it out asking, ‚ÄúWhy is this soup bitter?‚Äù Bulma then says, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs coffee you dummy, It‚Äôs not the sweetest drink ever. It‚Äôs just meant to kickup your energy and make you overstimulated.‚Äù Goku then asks, ‚ÄúWhy drink something just for the effect?‚Äù Bulma then responds, ‚ÄúIf the result is good enough you‚Äôll be willing to be disappointed.‚Äù 

	Bulma is styling her hair as Goku runs around the house. Bulma however then says, ‚ÄúGoku, please stop running around.‚Äù Goku then exclaims, ‚ÄúBut I wanna train!‚Äù Bulma then sighs pressing her temples to her forehead. ‚ÄúGoku, just‚Ä¶listen. I‚Äôd be fine with it to an extent if you just were training. BUT WE‚ÄôRE IN A SMALL HOUSE! There‚Äôs no room for training.‚Äù Goku then says, ‚ÄúI promised my grandpa I‚Äôd train every day.‚Äù Bulma sighs before saying, ‚ÄúLet me think of something.‚Äù Bulma looks in the the drawers trying to find something to use to try and at least prevent goku from being bored and causing her more of a nuisance. She does find some heavy tungsten bricks she was using and then she finds a wielding mask. Bulma then sculpts them into dumbbells and tells goku, ‚ÄúAlright, try lifting these.‚Äù 



These bricks were quite heavy and way heavier than cars. Goku looked ready to train his lifting but then decided to put it in his clothing. Maybe that‚Äôll be good training and sure enough. They weighed him down a lot. Bulma soon finished herself and finished brushing her own teeth before telling goku. ‚ÄúAlright, we‚Äôre going to have dinner now.‚Äù Bulma then unloads the capsule with the fish. Bulma and Goku then eat the fish happily. Goku seems excited to eat it. 

Bulma looks on goku‚Äôs fix with a bit of amusement. For all the headaches this day has brought, seeing goku get excited to eat fish is not one of them. Bulma again had alot of thoughts but she set those aside.  After a bit, Goku is seen taking out the tungsten dumbbells from his clothes. Bulma watches as goku seems minutely stronger. Bulma shrugs before saying, ‚ÄúAlright, its bedtime goku.‚Äù Goku then says, ‚ÄúBut I wanna train more.‚Äù Bulma then responds, ‚ÄúWell if you wanna feel big and strong in the morning you wanna get some good rest.‚Äù Goku then chuckles before trying to sleep in the big bed but Bulma grabs goku screaming, ‚ÄúYou aren‚Äôt sleeping in my bed!‚Äù Goku then says, ‚Äúbut you said.‚Äù Bulma then points to an inflatable mattress that seems kinda mediocre but also doesn‚Äôt seem bad. 

Goku blows up the mattress, figuring out how to pretty quickly to Bulma‚Äôs shock. Bulma says, ‚ÄúI again thought you were dumb.‚Äù Goku then giggles saying ‚ÄúI pick up on stuff very fast.‚Äù With that Goku is given soft blankets and so is Bulma. 

Bulma then sleeps on her bed but then thinks, ‚ÄúGoku. I thought he was just a dumbass. You know meathead hick who just loves fighting. But then again. He seems so oddly proficient. And when I had him blow up that mattress, it only took 2 minutes. Most mentally impaired people don‚Äôt have that quick of a pick up. Maybe he‚Äôs not dumb, maybe he just doesn‚Äôt know stuff. Whatever the case is, this won‚Äôt be as annoying as I once thought.‚Äù Bulma then finally says, ‚ÄúGood night goku.‚Äù Goku then says in response, ‚ÄúGood night, friend.‚Äù

I‚Äôm glad being single has gone well for *her*‚Ä¶ it has been agonizing for me, who didn‚Äôt expect a breakup and who had been planning a future together.

Honestly, the rejection would‚Äôve sucked no matter how she approached it, but it really hurt for her to basically tell me that life has been better since she removed me from it. Why does she even want to ‚Äúperiodically check in‚Äù? Why does she say that she ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt know‚Äù if her rejection of me is permanent? I know it‚Äôs breadcrumbing, and like everyone else who has been breadcrumbed, I‚Äôm too hopeful and blinded to acknowledge it‚Äôs likely just her letting me down easy.

It feels like an addiction‚Ä¶ I know every time we speak that I subject myself to breadcrumbs and false hope, yet it‚Äôs nice to just hear from her and feel like she still cares about me. But what does she get out of enabling it, knowing I‚Äôm still interested? I wish I could say that it‚Äôs because she misses me, but she literally told me that life has been good while single. I‚Äôd say validation, but she hasn‚Äôt been the one initiating. It‚Äôs always self-inflicted by me, with her leaving the door open

Not looking for criticism, I know this isn‚Äôt a healthy dynamic. It has been a work in progress since day 1.

I am currently 255# down from about 320# 7 months ago. I am moderately active in my daily life. I'm a full time farmer and work outside 7 days a week moderately to very physical labor nearly everyday. I can out work any of the healthy weight teen and 20 somethings that work for me. If I've had an easy work day, I'll get 20 minutes on the exercise bike to get more activity in. 

I've been meticulously tracking my calorie intake for the last 6 weeks. Utilizing a scale and tracking on an app. If I struggle with my appetite I still manage a 16/8 fasting schedule and might eat a couple times during that 8 hours. But must days I eat one meal a day in the evening. 

Over the 6 weeks using the app I've lost 20 pounds, 3.33# a week.  I have two issues, in the last couple weeks that lose has only been 1-2# a week. Inspite of the fact i average about 900 calories consumed a day over that 6 weeks. I will see weight loss on the scale if I eat 800 calories a day and i gain weight at 1000 calories a day. 

Because it will be asked I only drink black coffee and water, nothing else. Any condiments with calories get recorded. I try to eat few to no carbs on most days. And focus on protein rich food. 

If COCI is so fail proof why am I having to eat 800 calories a day to lose weight. My BMR is 2300-2500 calories a day, and I am definitely not sedentary. Even IF I under calculated calorie intake by double I should be losing weight every single day.",1,1757186607.0,WeightLossAdvice,1,1.0,False

Yet, I was always cast that way. Violent. Unpredictable. Unstable.

I wasn‚Äôt abused, I was the abuser (at 9? Sure. Because seeing a therapist is the same as seeing a fortune teller, astrology and psychology basically the same thing, says the Nparents) and all the bad things they did I just lied about for attention. 

I wasn‚Äôt standing up for myself to a lifetime of mistreatment, I was being bad.

I had little choice except to try to escape their rampant attempts to have access to every piece of my life, as they constant bulldozing past every boundary I ever tried to set. 

I was defending myself and that was viewed by the narcissists as an attack. So gossip was a weapon.

You know how I know for sure these days? That I was never the violent one, just a scared woman who felt she was matching threat level, not instigating or escalating? 

That point where it feels so overwhelming. SO LOUD. The doubts. The fears. The insecurities. The self loathing starts creeping in‚Ä¶ 

I don‚Äôt get mad. I don‚Äôt start crying. Or screaming. 

I paint. Everytime. I can picture the other yards I lived at when I was younger and alone. How I set out drop cloths and what I grabbed for blank canvas. Where I bought paints, or found them, 

Abstract. Colorful. Big. Bold. 

Textures, different mediums, and adhesives. 

Hot glue sticks have the full rainbow and then glitter versions too.

 MI have gloss and matte finishes for what I feel are my ‚Äúcoffee shop sale‚Äù pieces. Actual canvas. More thought than others. 

I make bad art when I hit emotional capacity. 

So no. When I was dragged into someone else‚Äôs ugly way of deflecting their panicky feelings by attacking me then DARVO‚Äôing so fast you get whiplash, I do not feel that is ‚Äúmy true nature‚Äù - not in the least. 

I studied myself. Alone. Traveling. I learned deeply what I like and don‚Äôt. How I can manage a surprise of the stressful kind in a relatively healthy way. I would drive to a town or city I never been to before.

I‚Äôd buy over priced at a coffee shop i stumbledw into for directions to a music venue somewhere walkable from where I stashed my car. Gotten quickly chased out of some more high end art galleries I had no business being in, if you haven‚Äôt accidentally interrupted a multimillion dollar sculpture sale or two, have you really lived? 

Making art these days - any thing from scrap wood, to cardboard, to canvas, to walls, to furniture I fished out of a dumpster on move out day a town over from the university. This more for the soul soothing aspect less of the profitable theory - I never intend to profit off my passions or hobbies. 

Business is business and painting is my refuge from the worst of my emotional disregulation. 

I wish I could be the calm centered version of myself mixing colors when I‚Äôm around other people, to any degree. 

I‚Äôm really stepping up to stand up for myself as best I can. Especially to ALL the people that benefit casting me as the instigator‚Ä¶ I am not. If I was leading the emotional out bursts and they were following me, they‚Äôd be a lot more versed in paint and communication theory.

This hits the spot for just the right amount of chocolatey flavor without being overwhelming. The coffee liqueur rounds out the flavor and adds a depth chocolate alone wouldn‚Äôt have. If desired, I think up to 3 tablespoons of liqueur would work well.

I was worried about developing a bartholin cyst, so my doctor had be come in for an ultrasound to confirm it. There‚Äôs a high probability of one based on the imaging, but it‚Äôs small so we‚Äôre not terribly worried about it now.

The awesome thing is that he wanted to repeat the Q tip test to see if there was already improvement. And‚Ä¶ THERE WAS. Oh my god. I was so terrified, but everywhere he touched was like, max 1/10 pain if not lower (keep in mind I‚Äôve still got stitches in, and am very much still healing so some discomfort is expected). That test used to be a 8/10 in the worst spots. 

And, on top of that- my urinary pain is gone. I used to get burning when I urinated, which was always sooo much worse after friction (intimacy or working out), and so much worse when I ate or drank caffeine, alcohol, even spicy foods. I can drink coffee now. I can use hot sauces again. If nothing else, I‚Äôve been given some of my favorites foods and drinks back. 

I‚Äôve still got a long ways to go in healing, but having quantifiable proof that things have improved from this surgery‚Ä¶. Things are good.

Not sure if this belongs here, pero gusto ko lang i-share. Alam ko medyo loser na to still live in the past. Happy naman ako ngayon, don‚Äôt get me wrong, pero minsan gusto ko lang talaga ma-experience ulit yung vibe noon. Since ilang months na lang 2026 na, naisip ko lang i-recall.

For me, 2016 was the best year ever, Pok√©mon Go everywhere, EDMs, Chainsmokers and Alan Walker nonstop, GSW blew a 3‚Äì1 lead lol, Kimi no Nawa sa sinehan‚Ä¶ it honestly felt like the closest we‚Äôve gotten to world peace lol. Parang ang gaan talaga ng mundo non, as if we were all in sync kahit sandali lang. 

Fast forward, isa sa mga solo trips ko sa Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam. First time kong mag-travel mag-isa. Pag-check in ko sa hostel, ako lang nasa room. Habang nakahiga, iniisip ko pa lang kung anong una kong gagawin, biglang may pumasok na girl. Halatang galing sa stressful na situation, mabilis yung hinga niya, hawak mahigpit yung bag, parang nagulat pa siya na may tao sa room.

Lumapit siya at sabi, muntik na raw siyang ma-snatch-an ng purse. Buti na lang hindi nakuha at hindi rin siya nasaktan. Kita ko sa mata niya yung takot pero pinipilit niyang maging okay. Pinakalma ko siya, sabi ko if gusto pa niyang ipagpatuloy ang kanyang travel, baka wag na lang niya muna sabihin sa parents niya, baka pauwiin siya agad. Napangiti siya, natawa ng konti, parang gumaan yung atmosphere.

Nagpakilala siya, let‚Äôs call her Nikki. American,   Japanese parents. She was 20, on a gap year before mag-college. She wasn‚Äôt the ‚Äúwow, super model‚Äù type, pero meron siyang presence na hindi mo basta-basta malilimutan. Slim, maputi, long black hair, naka-glasses. Yung tipong kahit stressed, maganda pa ring tingnan. May simplicity na striking.

Habang unti-unti siyang kumakalma, nilabas niya Oreos, sabay alok sa akin. Tumanggi ako kasi nahihiya, pero natawa siya, ‚ÄúHaven‚Äôt really met anyone who refused an Oreo, haha!‚Äù Tumawa na lang din ako, and just like that, nag-flow na usapan namin. Kwento about life, travel, bakit siya nasa Vietnam. Hanggang sa niyaya ko na rin siyang lumabas para mawala yung bad vibes niya. 

Wala kaming specific plans, so nag-explore na lang kami ng city. Caf√© hopping sa paligid ng Ph·∫°m Ng≈© L√£o, tasting all the small pastries and iced coffee. Ang init ng araw, but the smells of fresh bread and street foods made it feel alive. Sa park, we sat on the bench, watched kids play and adults exercise, and just talked. Medyo awkward ako at first kasi mahiyain ako, hoy! imagine, last na girl na nakausap ko seriously was my high school ex pa, 2010 yun lol! Pero later on, naging comfortable na.

That night, nag-dinner kami sa isang maliit na eatery sa gilid ng kalsada. Plastic stools, maingay ang motor sa paligid, ilaw ng signage na kumikindat-kindat. Umorder kami ng b√∫n b√≤ Hu·∫ø, beef noodle soup na parehong first time naming tikman. Tahimik lang kami habang kumakain, sabay tingin at tawa kasi nag-struggle ako sa chopsticks at dumudulas ang noodles lol.

Pagbalik sa hostel, hindi pa kami nauubosan ng energy. Lumabas pa kami ulit, bar hopping naman. Doon mas naging personal yung usapan, she told me how she hustled just to fund her trip, her big dreams, the things that scared her, even stories about our past relationships. Ang saya kasi hindi siya nag-hold back, and for once, I felt like someone actually wanted to hear me too. Naglaro pa kami ng foosball, tag-team against other travelers, then one-on-one. Sa dami ng tao sa bar, pakiramdam ko kami lang yung naririnig ng isa‚Äôt isa.

Umuwi kami magkahawak-kamay. Walang kiss, walang anything alasjuicy, wag kang ano jan, HAHAHA. Pero masaya.

The next day, instead of sticking to separate plans, nag-decide kaming mag-stay pa together sa HCM. Nag-book kami ng private room and nag explore ulit ng city since 2PM pa naman ang check-in time. Museum ng Ho Chi Minh first, the air-conditioning felt like heaven after the heat outside. She kept leaning a bit closer while reading the plaques, and I realized I wanted to know everything about her. Next, Notre-Dame Cathedral, its redish pink bricks glowing under the morning sun. We took photos together, I also took candid photos of her on my phone. Then, the post office, huge vaulted ceilings, intricate designs. Sa bawat building, ang dami naming natutunan, pero mas gusto ko yung kwentuhan namin habang naglalakad sa paligid, holding hands across street crossings, laughing at tiny mistakes in pronunciation.

That night nag decide kami mag party ulit hehehe syempre hindi mawawala ang walwal lol, habang sumasayaw kami sa club, duon nangyari yung first kiss namin, first kiss ko din ito. Awkward, sloppy, but full of laughter, excitement, and that electric connection you only feel once in a lifetime.

The next few days, ganoon lang routine namin. Explore sa umaga, window shopping sa B·∫øn Th√†nh Market, caf√© hopping, street foods, herbs, grilled meat, lemongrass, spices na ang lakas ng aroma. She laughed at me trying to figure out how to eat some local snacks, wala kasing toothpick yung snail nila kaya ang hirap kainin lol. Pagdating ng gabi, night market, neon lights, tawanan, ingay ng mga tao sa street at motorbikes. Hawak kamay habang naglalakad sa madaming tao sa B√πi Vi·ªán Walking Street. Hindi na kailangan ng maraming activities, sapat na yung presence ng isa‚Äôt isa. Honestly, it felt like time stopped. The city was ours. I was full of life.

Pero dumating din yung inevitable. Kailangan ko nang bumalik ng Pinas, siya naman may flight papuntang Da Nang, this flight was actually rebooked, hehe, kasi binago niya yung plans para mag-match sa schedule ko. Sabay kami sa airport, at hindi na napigilang maluha bago maghiwalay. Hinawakan niya kamay ko ng mahigpit, parang ayaw ko nang pakawalan. Niyakap ko siya ng mahigpit, hanggang sa parang gusto ko nang i-freeze yung oras.

Before we finally let go, we shared our last kiss, quick, awkward, sweet, and full of everything we hadn‚Äôt said over the past few days in Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam.

Yung flight pabalik ng Manila, sobrang bigat. Kahit nasa bus na ako pauwi, naiiyak pa rin ako, hahaha!

It wasn‚Äôt just a travel fling. Hindi lang basta fleeting excitement or kilig. That was the time I felt the deepest connection with someone, sa pinaka-unexpected na place, at sa pinaka-unexpected na moment. There‚Äôs something different, almost magical, about meeting someone when you‚Äôre both strangers, away from everything familiar. I‚Äôve only ever felt that kind of connection while traveling, when the world feels both vast and intimate at the same time.

Yes, there‚Äôs always a price to pay when separation comes. But the memories, they last.



PS:
To Nikki, I know you‚Äôll never read this, but I actually let you win in foosball that night just to see you smile wider, hahaha! Sometimes, I still look at our selfies and remember those days as the happiest time of my life.",1,1757186271.0,OffMyChestPH,1,1.0,False

I have RCPD and have done for years since childhood. I'm 35 now and in the last 18 months its got a lot worse to the point I'm miserable and uncomfortable, not to mention the anxiety that comes along with it.
I just came back from a fantastic cruise holiday, which included all inclusive food and drink, which sounds amazing and it was, but I was SO unbelievably uncomfortable, & its prompted me to get something done. In the mean time I'm wondering if anyone else can relate to the same symptoms as me:

- Gurgles, these can be after drinking fizzy drinks, after drinking only water, sometimes I've had nothing and they happen with just talking and breathing! 

- Gas pains, all the time! This is probably the one that I find the hardest. If I'm hungry I get really uncomfortable, I'll get sharp pains in my ribs, back, stomach that move with all the air thats in me. Of course I then eat, and the cycle starts again but from the food I've eaten. I can feel the gas moving through me and it pops and gurgles in my stomach, until it finally comes out the other end. A lot of the time it gets stuck and I suffer trapped wind due to the sheer Volume thats in me. Sometimes I'm lucky and it passes through quick, other times it gets trapped in me and I get really bad stomach pains and aches around my lower stomach and it can take hours to move through. It can be so bad its like labour pains! Sometimes I wake up with gas pains purely just because I've lied in an awkward position and the gas has no where to go! Aside from this sometimes the passing of wind does.not.stop ü§£ don't get wrong this is amusing, especially to my 7 year old, however its not fun when its acompponied by pain.

I've even had people ask when my baby is due. My trousers get super uncomfortable and to be honest I never look nice in anything I wear because of this. 

- Painful hiccups/acid type burning in throat/difficulty vomiting. Unlike the other symptoms, these aren't on a daily basis, but I do experience these occasionally. Sometimes when I'm really full up with air I will do a random hiccup thats really painful, it feels like its my bodies way of releasing the air but obviously it doesn't work. 

So, after such a long post explaining how I suffer with RCPD, I was firstly wondering if anyone else experiences symptoms like this day to day, morning til night? 

Lastly I wanted to ask how do I get the ball rolling to get botox because I'm at the end of my tether now? Admittedly I'm skint, but I will do anything to try and get some relief, I heard the botox is about ¬£800, but theres a few months wait, therefore I'm hoping to save in this time to be able to go ahead with it. How do I go about contacting for it? Do I simply just explain all of my symptoms in an email and explain I want the botox, or do they have to do tests to see if you have it first? (I know 100 percent I do have it.) I've attatched a short video of the gurgles I experience. This was recorded after having a few sips of coffee and nothing else (please ignore my children in the background, they were playing!) imagine this all day every day ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Terraria Mod Pet Concept - Hoshigiri Akane (Light Pet)

Item: Cosmic Reality Tea (Rare Light Pet Summon Item)

Tooltip: ‚ÄúHaving this item tends to attract a certain anomaly from another world.‚Äù

Use: Summons Hoshigiri Akane - The Anomaly of the Boundless Void. Research Unlock: 9999 (Good. Luck) Buff: Anomaly‚Äôs Watch

Idle Animations:  
Sipping the Void: Akane materialises her own invisible teacup, sipping idly as her feet dangle over nothing, swaying back and forth.  
Temporal Glitch: Every few seconds, she blinks out for a frame or two, reappearing offset by a tile, almost as if reality hiccupped.  
Gifting Stardust: When the player is motionless for \~8 seconds, Akane floats in front, offering a tiny star or cosmic candy. The object flickers, then vanishes in a puff of void sparkles.

Movement:  
Phasing Float: Akane never walks; she glides, but with a slightly jittery effect, as if skipping through invisible cracks in space.  
Blink Teleport: When the player moves quickly or teleports, Akane always lags by half a second, then reappears in a burst of nebula mist, sometimes upside-down for a moment before correcting herself.  
Stardust Trails: Wherever she goes, faded trails of galaxies, constellations, and purple mist follow for a short distance, fading quickly.

1na83r6,https://www.reddit.com/r/lebanon/comments/1na83r6/i_tried_dating_3x_in_lebanon_in_the_span_of_2/,I tried dating 3x in Lebanon in the span of 2 months and results were disappointing,"I am a guy in my 40s so don't know where one would go to meet singles since the nightlife is dominated by the generation much younger than me.  In most of the world dating apps is the answer and finding that in Lebanon its worse than anywhere else in the world.  I don't believe for a second that there aren't any single gals but somehow a day goes and I am only presented with 5-7 new profiles daily to swipe left or right on.  In other countries I could go on forever swipping.

I feel Lebanon is imbued with shame of being on there if anyone you know spotted you there, I get it that the possibility of running into someone you know is more likely here than anywhere else in the world but who gives a damn?? I did learn that many women pay extra for the feature to make themselves invisible to everyone except whomever they match but the ones publicly putting themselves out there they do the bare minimum meaning they put non-clear pics of themselves and waste their profile by putting up photos of things other than themselves.  Sad thing is they do not offer much to make up for the lack of effort by engaging in tantalizing conversations or asking good questions.  I digress since that is a problem you find elsewhere in the world.

The best one I've come across was this beauty that liked that I had the question on my profile that asked what are the green flags and red flags in relationships.  I thought I was going to get something insightful, wait for it, she typed ""green flag is someone with emotional security, red flag is someone without emotional security"".  Somebody shoot me!! At that point I knew I couldn't take that person seriously.  I really wanted to say my green flag was intelligence and red flag is someone lacking intelligence but didn't wanna be harsh.

There is another one where we reached the point of agreeing to go out on a date.  While suggesting coffee shop ideas she suggests going to Starbucks to which I replied there must be better options out there.  I meant that that I wanted to go somewhere authentic and fancier than a Starbucks, nothing to do with boycotting the business, some people are silly!! Here is the thing I don't go out of my way of buying coffee at a Starbucks, especially if in a crunch but I digress.  She got so offended by my statement that I get accused of being political, I was like what gives?  The thing being that she can't get along with anyone who is political, I was like you don't know anything about me.  Her feeble argument was that someone she knew said the same statement and was political and therefore I have to be also.  Yea its as silly as it can get, she was like sorry its unfair but that is the way it is.  I responded with well you have control over what you think but what am I saying she doesn't even have the capability of thinking whatsoever.

Suffice to say that its sad that dating apps are the only way to meet singles.  Somebody ought to come up with Meetup events, single mingles or speed dating events so there are more options for these eligible singles in their 40s.",12,1757186091.0,lebanon,15,0.8,False

I'm fairly new to Premier Pro, so please be gentle:-)

I shoot with an iphone, airdrop it to my mac and move it to it's folder, then drag it to my premier pro timeline. The colors from the original film turn either yellowy with high exposure or grainy with low exposure in premier. When I export the video, it changes colors one more time, this time to more yellowy with high exposure. My project color settings are set to 2.4 Broadcast, when I changed it to 2.2. Web, the exposure got worse when exporting. 

I've attached two instances (screenshots) here. One with coffee mug (turned yellowy) the top frame is the original, the middle one is when it's in premier, and the bottom one is after exporting. Same order with the shoe frame, but it's an example where the film gets washed out. 

I'm editing on an iMac nowadays, when I edited on my MacBook, I used to never have this problem. I just feel like some color settings are off. Could someone please help?

1na7yat,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1na7yat,Review of Penhouse.in's Royal Blue 'Coffee Flavored' Water Resistant Ink.,"Cost of the ink is Rs. 169.49 with delivery charges separate for a 60 ml bottle. Written review is on 65 GSM paper (Classmate Youva A4 388 notebook paper), written with a Pierre Cardin Napoli which has had its tines separated a bit for extra wetness.

It is a very wet ink that will feather, ghost and bleed through paper, especially when written with a wet pen (like the modified Napoli I've written with). Of course, because of its wetness, it does dry almost immediately because the ink soaks into the paper.

It does have a coffee aroma, which is pleasantly faint on paper, but will leave your pen smelling sickly strong of coffee.

This ink will react with other inks, pen flushes, soap etc that may get left in your pens and will clog them. If you want to use this ink try using it in a cheaper pen that can be easily disassembled and cleaned. Example, the Pierre Cardin Napoli can have its nib and feed removed and has a shallow cartridge section which fits the typical syringe perfectly for flushing.

This ink stains. It will stain your pen, your sink, your hands. The stains can be removed with mild detergent or bleach and scrubbing but be wary while handling of course.

Its not quite UV light resistant and in my testing would be obliterated completely in a week in the sun and starts fading within a day of direct sun exposure. But it hasn't shown any signs of fading in a typical use notebook for a month",3,1757185715.0,DesiPens,0,1.0,False

I've had Autism for a very long time now, and now my horrid restrictions to my diet are catching up with my health in a very bad way. My liver is almost completely ruined by my forced diet of unhealthy sugary snacks and bad processed meats, and especially my aversions to taste AND texture which makes eating almost anything impossible.

I want to try and eat healthier before my health nose-dives past the point of no return, but even now in my adulthood, I have horrific struggles with eating almost anything healthy. The textures and tastes of almost every single fruit and vegetable makes me vomit if I try to eat what's considered a healthy amount of it. I absolutely hate seafoods, I've never found nuts to taste good, and I can't even drink something as basic as black coffee without it tasting like I'm putting literal dirt into my mouth. No matter what I look up to try something new, it's all the same garbage lists with the exact same foods that I physically can't stomach.

I keep getting mixed informations with the ones I do find, and my current diet has so much sugar snuck into even the most basic of food items that I can't stop eating it no matter what foods I try. I want to eat healthier so badly, but if I can't even get it into my stomach without vomitting, what am I supposed to do? If anyone has any help that isn't just forcing myself to eat these foods, or if you have any brand named foods that you buy to help yourselves out, could you tell me?

[Original Post - rareddit](https://www.rareddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7ak8dr/me_34m_with_my_wife_35f_10_years_we_are_taking/)  **Nov 3, 2017**

Hello everyone, using a throwaway.

My wife and I are about to leave on our first vacation since we've had kids 8 years ago. We've planned for over a year and we leave the Sunday before thanksgiving. Both sets of our parents are coming to our town to have a huge thanksgiving and get the kids to school while we get some time away. We are heading to Hawaii and while we are not ""scrimping"" by any means, we aren't super wealthy people and we are having to look for deals in order to get to do everything we want to do.

Over the weekend my wife aparently talked to her best friend who imparted on her that we NEED to take separate flights because if the plane were to crash our kids would be without both parents. I actually thought she was kidding at first and made the mistake of saying ""that's so ridiculous it's not even funny."" She got really mad at me and didn't speak to me until Tuesday morning. I realized that she was really upset so I started looking into changing the flights.

Basically for us to get there on the same day it would cost us $1094 extra from the tickets we've already purchased. There are other options but the option that's affordable would mean one of us would miss about 4 days of the 10 day vacation.

She is insisting that this is so worth it to her that she's willing to forgo some of the activities we had planned (stuff I was really looking forward to doing like scuba and surf lessons, even a helicopter ride).

She is unwilling to bend and every time I tell her how safe it really is she gets really mad at me and even broke up a coffee cup this morning she said she was so tired of hearing my ""bullshit.""

Do I need to just bite the bullet and exchange one ticket and make her happy?

**tl;dr:** My wife and I are going on our first vacation in 8 years. she is insisting at about the last minute we get two separate flights in case of a plane crash. Should I just buy the ticket despite the cost?

**Reisevi3ber**

>> OP should show his wife this thread. If she doesn't realize how ridiculous she is being after that then you have bigger problems than a vacation. And I mean fuck, she even broke a coffee mug? And she wants one of you to miss 4 days of the vacation? Something is wrong here. Is she always like that? How does she treat you generally?

**thei5guy**

> Is this the first communication problem the two of you have had in the last 10 years?

> How close are you with the friend that put this idea into her head? Call the friend and ask the friend to do a little research on air flight safety and the real data involving plane crashes in the last 10 years. Hopefully after she does a little real research she will call your wife and remove that idea from her head?

>I'm not sure it's been posted here but I wanted to point out that the last fatal crash of an AMERICAN commercial flight was almost 10 years ago. Any accidents you've heard about in the past 10 years have been non-US airlines or corporate or what not. It's been almost 10 years since anyone has died from an airplane crash on an American carrier. The level of safety is the highest it has ever been.

**OOP**

1na7or2,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_RogueWaveCoffee/comments/1na7or2/sept_6th_update_rogue_wave_coffee_new_coffee_gear/,"Sept 6th Update - Rogue Wave Coffee - New coffee, gear, and tariff","Hi Everyone, 

It's Ply here. I took sometime off from Reddit. Apologize for all the missed messages. I will go through them in min. 

The code for the month of Sept and Oct is - FALLINGINTOCOFFEE25 - or use this [link](https://roguewavecoffee.ca/discount/FALLINGINTOCOFFEE25) for 10% off coffee, drinkware, and until the next update, OREA brand products as well. 

There are a bunch of new coffees and products go check them out. The co-fermented Sumatra is surprisingly good. The new Abu Geisha natural is banging, and the Kenya washed is quite classic. To name a few. 

We got bunch of new gear. The Orea Z1 is here as well. Glassware and paper filters are enroute by ocean so it will take a bit more time. 

Cafec shortage - there is a bit of cafec shortage. More stock coming in about a month. 

Origami shortage - we have a small restock coming in. Big restock is being push back to winter. 

**US TARIFF** - not sure where to begins. Aug 29th was when USA eliminated de minimis, meaning all shipment going into USA are now subject to duties. While there are some things that are tariff exempted we are currently do not have anything that would be in that exemption. HOWEVER, the[ latest executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/modifying-the-scope-of-reciprocal-tariffs-and-establishing-procedures-for-implementing-trade-and-security-agreements/) from Sept 5, have some modifying scope of reciprocal tariffs and added more exemptions. Coffee, green and roasted, are included in this executive order as... maybe, its depends. It will be up to the Secretary of Commerce to decide, and we do not know if/when this will come into effect if it goes through. 

This is the actual wording from the EO - ""Note: All products that are properly classified in the provisions of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule
of the United States (HTSUS) that are listed in this Annex are potentially eligible to be exempted
from duties imposed by Executive Order 14257, as amended, as determined by the Secretary of
Commerce and the United States Trade Representative for each trading partner that has concluded
an agreement on reciprocal trade, based on the scope and nature of the trading partner‚Äôs
commitments under that agreement."" - part of Appendix III from the EO. 

So.. i guess we are hoping for the best out come. 

**Here are the list of Tariff rate for some of the common items we sell:**

- Canada - 35% (all roasted coffee from us are considered product of Canada)

- China - 54%

- Japan and Korea - 15%

- Taiwan 20%

- Australia - 10% 

- Indonesia - 19%

**Duties calculation** - these are done automatically in the system based on CBP data base. We include the country of Origin and HSTS code in our products, and the duties rate apply automatically. This will show up at checkout for our US customer. We will then ship the order out as DDP (delivered duty paid) so no additional charge should be showing up unless there is human error along the logistic route. 

So right now we are shipping stuff to the USA. The only things we are not shipping is Subscription. This is because internal system will not calculate duties on recurring orders. We are trying to see if there is any alternative method that doesn't requite huge amount of manual work. We will be updating our subscribers separately via emails. 

That is it for now. 

Also if you are in Montreal, I'll be doing pop at at White Heron on Sept 13th! 

Let me know if you have any questions. Thanks for reading the long post.

1na7oan,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1na7oan/i_just_killed_my_main_character/,I just killed my main character.,"Two years ago, in a small coffee shop, I fell in love with three strangers.

The group of roommates sitting nearby were loud, obnoxious, and yet so human. 

I fell in love. They smelled of old books, pastries, and peeling paint. I imagined their house was old. Victorian, maybe.

Crumbling walls, mold under the floorboards. Cozy.

They had all the stereotypes: the pretentious asshole making quips, the quieter, more observant one who was clearly into the pretentious asshole. 

The girl stood out. 

Red lipstick, a risqu√© dress, and fishnets.

The guys were more copy-and-paste, brunette and blonde. 

Opposing personalities, but through awkward glances, sly smiles, and brushing shoulders, clearly into each other. Every conversation, every quip, every laugh, pulled me closer. 

Their clothes looked warm and lived-in, tangled scarves, winter coats, baseball caps hiding unwashed hair.

So, I named these strangers. 

Rose. Wylan. Penn. 

Names became a story; sloppily edited, and full of typos. 

Then a bestselling novel. 

And now, 

A movie. 

I *hated*  the actors. 

Rose was written as Korean. So, why was the actress white? 

Penn‚Äôs actor was a fucking nepo baby. 

Wylan‚Äôs actor, Ewen, was self explanatory when he mimicked my lisp. 

On day one of filming, I cornered Ewen in his trailer. 

Zero resemblance to Wylan, except his attitude, rolling his eyes through scenes. 

‚ÄúYou're not Wylan,‚Äù I told him through my teeth. ‚ÄúIf you can't take this seriously‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúSooooo, *kill* me.‚Äù

Lifting my head, his expression twitched, bleeding into familiarity. 

The scrunched up nose and permanent smirk, the raised eyebrow. Not Ewen. 

Not even Wylan. 

I was staring at the stranger from the coffee shop. 

The brunette with the baseball cap.

His inspiration. 

‚ÄúWhy did you even write me in the first place, hmm?‚Äù he murmured. 

He took a step, closing the space between us until his breath brushed my cheek. ‚ÄúIf you were going to mess me up this badly‚Ä¶ I mean, seriously? This guy?‚Äù 

He jabbed a finger at himself. 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not *serious*, right? He‚Äôs not me! You worked so hard to get us right, and yet you think these guys are us?‚Äù

I was suddenly aware of the blade between my fingers. 

I felt his fingers brushing mine, teasing the blade over his heart. ‚ÄúKill me, and start all over again.‚Äù

I nodded, dizzy, and plunged the blade into his heart.

I heard his cry, his breathy sobs, and drove it deeper.

*‚ÄúEwen?‚Äù*

The voice slammed into me, my vision blurring. 

I stared down at the body at my feet, at blood pooling in my palms. 

Ewen. 

‚ÄúBabe, are you in there?‚Äù Lya, Rose's actress, knocked again. ‚ÄúEwen!‚Äù

‚ÄúHe's in there,‚Äù Sam, Penn‚Äôs actor, groaned. ‚ÄúI can hear him.‚Äù

Fuck.

‚ÄúThey're not *us*.‚Äù Penn stood behind me, his breath in my ear. 

Rose's giggles prickled the back of my neck.  

He was right. 

They weren't *them*. 

I found my voice, tightening my grip on the knife.

I‚Äôm currently 37 weeks and wokeup one day with EXTREMELY swollen ankles and hands 
Give or take a couple days I have a blood pressure machine at home so I used it twice and my blood pressure read 144/94. My normal is typically in the 130/70 range sometimes high 130/80 range if I drank coffee before my ob visit. Now tuesday when I had two high blood pressure reads accompanied with blurry vision and the extreme swelling out of nowhere, I went to triage. Now of course right when I get to triage my blood pressure was normal and not concerning to them at all. I told them all my signs and they didn‚Äôt run any blood work or test my pee either. All they did was look at my TWO WEEK OLD BLOOD TESTS and told me they looked normal then and not much would change from then to now and that I just need to take iron supplements basically. I was discharged  after being there for an hour max. But luckily for me I have an appointment with my ob the next day which was this past Wednesday and when they took my blood pressure twice it was 140/ night 80 something then told me to lay down relax and came in the room to take my bp while I was relaxed and it was still high. This concerned my OB so she came in the room asking if the hospital did any blood tests, I told her no and what the nurse at triage said so my ob left the room and gave me an order form to go get my blood work don‚Äôt to see if my liver and kidneys were okay basically. Then my ob said well have to induce me within the next week if I even make it a week without needing to me induced. I left, got my blood work done and didn‚Äôt get the results till Thursday afternoon when the office had already closed and Fridays my ob is off so I haven‚Äôt heard anything and I probably won‚Äôt till Monday or when I have my already scheduled appointment next wednesday on the 10th.

1na7jjx,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1na7jjx/half_a_decade_and_theres_still_feelings/,Half a Decade and there‚Äôs still feelings,"Six years ago, my ex (M33) and I (M31) broke up because he needed to get sober. It wasn‚Äôt about a lack of love, but about him needing to focus entirely on his recovery. We never had a clean breakup; it was more of a fade-out, and later I got an apology as part of his Step 9 amends. I accepted it, and I honestly thought that was the end of our story.

Out of nowhere, he recently reached out and asked to meet. It was on his sobriety anniversary. He told me he needed ‚Äúclosure,‚Äù that the ‚Äúdoor was never closed,‚Äù and he wanted to shut it so he could move on. Instead of a quick coffee, we ended up on a four-mile walk that lasted over an hour. During that time, he admitted that he still feels love for me as his first real love, that he‚Äôs never felt the same with anyone else since, and that what we had was intense and meaningful. He even apologized again for ghosting me when he left. I told him that it was painful but also happy to see him, and that I never really got over him either.

Since that walk, things have only gotten more confusing. He reacted with jealousy when I mentioned I had been with someone else, literally joking ‚Äúgross‚Äù and laughing. He asked me not to attend an upcoming event because he didn‚Äôt want gossip or drama in front of his conservative family and friends. They might remember me and piece together what happened in the past. I get it probably is awkward i will be around all of those people he introduced me to without him there. I reassured him multiple times that I would never disrespect him, but he kept circling back to make sure I‚Äôd stay quiet. He practically jumped when I first told him I planned to go. And mind you I told him while we were on our walk - unexpected he would act that way. Later, he backtracked, saying, ‚ÄúI never said don‚Äôt go. It‚Äôs your choice. Just keep it low key. Don‚Äôt make your decision about me.‚Äù But the reality is that his comfort clearly dictated everything. Then, after I sent him a thoughtful message about how I‚Äôd protect his peace, he went completely silent.

This is now two weeks in a row where my emotions have been completely shaken up by him. He says this was about closure, but nothing about his actions feels like closure. To me, closure should be clean, short, and final. Instead, I got confessions that he‚Äôs never found what we had again, jealousy and protectiveness, long texts unpacking family shame, gossip, and control, and then silence when I tried to reassure him. I keep asking myself: if he doesn‚Äôt want me back, then why do all of this? His actions and words don‚Äôt match. It feels like unfinished love, but he‚Äôs too scared or ashamed to admit it.

The hardest part is that despite all of this ‚Äî the anger, the confusion, the emotional rollercoaster ‚Äî if he told me he wanted to try again, I would. I‚Äôd take it slow, I‚Äôd work on it, and I‚Äôd get to know the ‚Äúnew‚Äù him as a sober adult. That‚Äôs how much I still love him. But right now, I feel stuck in limbo, where his words say ‚Äúclosure,‚Äù but his actions keep me hooked and emotionally invested. It‚Äôs exhausting and it feels deeply unfair.

TL;DR: My ex came back after six years saying he wanted ‚Äúclosure,‚Äù but instead admitted he never found anyone like me, acted jealous, tried to control me going to an event, and then went silent. Nothing about this feels like closure, and I still love him. Do I try to get him back, or finally close this chapter myself?",1,1757184743.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

What I understand: I power on the machine, and wait for the power circle to shine solid instead of blinking. From there I can either turn the knob to the right for the wand feature, either selecting hot water or steam. To the left is for brew obviously 

But here‚Äôs where I‚Äôm confused: When I turn to brew, it‚Äôs like the water keeps coming and coming and it pours usually a heaping cup of coffee. The coffee itself always turns out mediocre, I‚Äôm using good beans and a good grind, I feel like I‚Äôm tamping it properly (my girlfriend works in a coffee shop seasonally and I worked a few shifts with her, so I sorta know how to do espresso properly). 

Basically, it always comes out as a dull Americano fully poured, instead of a dense, small shot of espresso. 

I‚Äôve changed the filter, tried different espresso baskets, and different grades of grind and nothing turns out. If someone could point me in the right direction that would be greatly appreciated ",1,1757184185.0,BrevilleCoffee,7,0.67,False

I‚Äôm actually shaking a little bit writing this cause I really don‚Äôt know what to think.

For as long as I known my husband, he‚Äôs been a little weird with his phone. I remember when dating, he would always turn his phone down and take it with him wherever he goes. I confronted him and he told be that it‚Äôs just a habit, I said I can see notifications from women and he showed me said women before actually his friends and showed the conversations too and they was nothing fishy‚Ä¶

We got married, and still the same. He takes his phone everywhere. Rarely leaves it alone. Again, I got upset seeing notifications from women (like women names, female bitmojis etc..) and I confronted him again that obviously it makes me feel some type of way, even if they‚Äôre friends, I don‚Äôt like seeing that. I told him you don‚Äôt ever get to feel like that, you‚Äôre lucky I don‚Äôt have male friends and if I had, they wouldn‚Äôt been popping like that in our lives. 

He told me a bit about his friendships and said you can even go through my phone if you like. He gave me his passcode. One time, he went to shower and I couldn‚Äôt resist. So I took his phone and went through it but didn‚Äôt find anything suspicious or bad. I went through his messages with one female friend that pops up the most (others were mostly online friends texting or se do transom videos or memes), and to my liking, there was a tiny bit of flirting but onion more biased and most people wouldn‚Äôt see it that way. Just yesterday this girl called him while we were out having coffee and his didn‚Äôt pick up. On the way back he was texting till we got home but I don‚Äôt know who.

Today, he went to shower and I thought let me go through it again. Is aw some texts but nothing weird, just random stuff. 

BUT!! I did my first mistake and if there was something to find out, I‚Äôm never gonna be able to find out. 

I opened on iMessage a text from her and went through the convo, but I left it like that. I thought about doing the ‚Äúleave as non read‚Äù but I thought he might not remember, it was just a thank you text. BIG MISTAKE!!

Cause I only looked for literally 30 seconds, I panicked he‚Äôd some out of the bathroom. I put the phone away. 

He went to the bathroom again just now, I thought okay now I‚Äôll have time. I went to iMessage and now it asks for Face ID.

I couldn‚Äôt see any of his messages, nor calls or access any apps (I really wanted to check his WhatsApp and insta), nothing accessible anymore. I thought let me check Safari and he searched for ‚Äúhow to add Face ID to apps‚Äù üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠

Now, I really feel stressed cause although he could just do this to protect his privacy (which I want to respect but his behaviour was weird I‚Äôm sorry), I feel very anxious that he might be hiding something.

And if I ever want to bring up the conversation, I can‚Äôt even do it without saying I went through his phone. Even though he said I could and gave me his passcode but then why add Face ID to everything? Even photos and notes

I feel paranoid right now, I don‚Äôt know what to do or think. 

Please help me, I can‚Äôt think straight right now and I‚Äôm hoping for the best but as a woman, I just want to feel safe and know I‚Äôm not getting played or cheated

*Today I'm sharing Linda's heartbreaking story about finding love at 68, only to discover that sometimes Prince Charming is just a master manipulator. This is a cautionary tale about senior romance, red flags we missed, and the devastating reality of being used by someone you trusted with your heart. Make sure to watch until the end - the twist will shock you.*



# Chapter 1: Meeting Prince Charming

Hey everyone, welcome back to my channel. Today's story is going to be heavy, so grab some tissues. This is about Linda, a 68-year-old widow living in coastal South Carolina, who thought she'd found her second chance at love.

Linda had been alone for three years after losing her husband of 42 years to cancer. She'd moved to a modest senior community, downsized everything, and had even given up her car the year before because her pension just wasn't stretching far enough. She was lonely but had accepted that romance was probably behind her.

Then she met Michael at the community center's weekly coffee social. He was 71, silver-haired, impeccably dressed, and had that confident charm that some men never lose. Michael was what locals call a ""snowbird"" - he spent winters in South Carolina and summers back home in Connecticut.

""I'm old-fashioned,"" Michael told Linda on their first coffee date, insisting on paying despite her protests.

""A gentleman always takes care of a lady.""

Those words made Linda's heart flutter in ways she'd forgotten were possible.

# Chapter 2: The Whirlwind Courtship

Michael's courtship was like something from a romance novel. He brought Linda flowers every few days not gas station bouquets, but beautiful arrangements from the expensive florist downtown. He took her to the nicest restaurants in town, always ordering wine and treating her like she was precious.

""I've been waiting my whole life to spoil someone like you,"" he'd say, squeezing her hand across candlelit tables.

Michael was generous in ways that took Linda's breath away. When he learned she'd given up her car, he immediately bought a reliable Honda and had it registered in both their names. ""I can't have my girl walking everywhere,"" he said, handing her the keys like it was nothing.

But the most shocking gesture came six weeks into their relationship. Michael handed Linda a check for

$15,000. ""Buy yourself whatever car you want, sweetheart. You deserve to have independence.""

Linda stared at the check, overwhelmed. ""Michael, this is too much. I can't accept this.""

""Please,"" he said. ""It would make me happy to know you're taken care of.""

Linda's response revealed everything about her character. Instead of keeping the money, she handed the check back. ""Use this toward that car you're trying to sell up north. I don't need two cars, and you've already done so much.""

Michael seemed touched by her thoughtfulness, pulling her into his arms. ""You're incredible, Linda. Most women would have run straight to the bank.""

# Chapter 3: Moving Too Fast

As winter progressed, Michael began talking about their future together. He owned a beautiful threebedroom house in an upscale neighborhood, complete with a pool and manicured gardens that he paid someone to maintain.

""This place is too big for just me,"" he'd say during their evenings together. ""It needs a woman's touch. It needs you.""

Linda felt nervous about the pace of their relationship. They'd only known each other four months, and moving in together seemed like such a big step at their age. But Michael was persuasive.

""At our age, sweetheart, why waste time? We know what we want. I want you here with me, sharing this life I've built.""

When Michael mentioned he'd be returning to Connecticut in early May for his summer season, Linda felt panic. Six months apart seemed impossible now that she'd grown used to his daily presence.

""Come live here,"" he urged. ""Make this your home too. When I go north, you can take care of the house, enjoy the pool, live like the queen you are.""

Despite her reservations about moving so quickly, Linda agreed. She gave up her apartment and moved into Michael's house in April, a month before he was scheduled to leave for the summer.

She was excited to play house, to cook in his beautiful kitchen, to tend to his gardens, to finally feel like she belonged somewhere again after years of downsizing and making do.

# Chapter 4: The Mask Comes Off

The change in Michael was immediate and shocking. The moment Linda's belongings were unpacked in his house, his entire demeanor shifted.

Gone was the attentive, romantic man who'd courted her so sweetly. In his place was someone cold, critical, and controlling. He complained about where she put her things, criticized her cooking, and made snide comments about her cleaning habits.

""I thought you'd be more helpful around here,"" he said when Linda struggled to figure out his complicated sprinkler system. ""Most women know how to maintain a house.""

When Linda suggested they go out to dinner - something they'd done regularly during their courtship Michael suddenly became concerned about expenses. ""We need to be more careful with money now that you're living here rent-free.""

The man who'd thrown around $15,000 like pocket change was now counting every dollar when it came to their shared expenses. But Linda noticed he still went golfing with his friends, still bought himself whatever he wanted.

""You're getting a free place to live,"" he reminded her when she questioned the sudden penny-pinching.

""The least you can do is contribute by cooking and cleaning.""

# Chapter 5: The Devastating Truth

Two weeks before Michael was scheduled to leave for Connecticut, Linda discovered the truth that shattered her world completely.

While cleaning his study, she accidentally knocked over a file folder. Papers scattered everywhere, and as she gathered them up, she saw documents that made her blood run cold.

Real estate listings for his house - the house she was living in, the house he'd convinced her to call home.

The listing was dated three weeks ago, with a sale price that made Linda's head spin.

Michael wasn't just going to Connecticut for the summer. He was selling the South Carolina house and had never intended for Linda to stay there. She'd been living in a house that was already on the market, playing housewife to a man who was planning to disappear from her life entirely.

When she confronted Michael with the listing, he didn't even try to deny it. ""Business is business, Linda. I got a good offer.""

""But what about me? What about us? You asked me to make this my home!""

Michael's response was chilling in its casual cruelty. ""You can find another place. You managed before you met me.""

That's when Linda realized the full scope of Michael's deception. He hadn't been courting her for love he'd been auditioning her for the role of live-in housekeeper and caretaker. Someone to maintain his property, cook his meals, and provide companionship during his winter stay, all while he planned his exit strategy.

# Chapter 6: The Final Betrayal

The worst part came when Linda tried to retrieve her belongings and discovered that Michael had changed his story about everything, even their financial arrangement.

""That car is in both our names,"" Linda pointed out when Michael suggested she had no claim to the Honda he'd bought her.

""I need to sell it to cover the expenses of having you here all these months,"" Michael replied coldly. ""Do you have any idea how much it costs to feed and house another person?""

This from the man who'd insisted on paying for everything, who'd claimed to be old-fashioned, who'd made her feel guilty for even offering to contribute.

Linda realized that every generous gesture had been calculated. The car, the meals, even the $15,000 check he'd known she was too honorable to keep - it was all part of establishing a narrative that he'd been financially supporting her, giving him leverage to justify taking everything back when he was ready to discard her.

# Chapter 7: Starting Over at 68

Linda found herself essentially homeless at 68 years old, with no car, no apartment, and no safety net except her small pension. The man who'd promised to take care of her had systematically dismantled her independence and then abandoned her.

But Linda's response to this betrayal revealed her true strength. Instead of wallowing in self-pity, she got angry - not bitter, but righteously furious at being manipulated and used.

She contacted a lawyer who confirmed that while Michael had been technically within his legal rights, his behavior was morally reprehensible. She couldn't get the house or the car, but she could get her story out.

Linda started telling other women in the senior community about her experience, warning them about the red flags she'd missed. The excessive generosity that came with strings attached. The rushing of the relationship. The immediate personality change once she'd committed.

""I ignored my instincts because I wanted so badly to believe in love again,"" Linda told her support group.

""But real love doesn't disappear the moment you're inconvenient.""

# Conclusion: Lessons Learned

Linda eventually found a small apartment she could afford and even saved enough to buy a used car. But more importantly, she learned to trust herself again.

Michael had targeted her specifically because she was lonely, financially vulnerable, and grateful for attention. He'd love-bombed her with generosity to make her feel indebted, then used that manufactured debt to justify his cruelty when he was ready to move on.

The saddest part? Linda later learned from neighbors that she wasn't Michael's first victim. He'd run this same script with other women in previous winters, always finding someone new to take care of his house and stroke his ego until he was ready to return north.

As Linda puts it now: ""At 68, I learned that predators don't retire. They just change their hunting methods.""

Her advice to other seniors looking for love? Trust slowly, keep your independence, and remember that real love enhances your life - it doesn't require you to give up everything that makes you feel secure.

Do we ‚Äútake away‚Äù the task, or let him keep bungling it, even if it is expensive?

Other times, he tries to pour water in the coffee grinder, but was stopped before he could ruin it. Other times, he‚Äôs brewed coffee, then added more water to the machine to brew again, flooding the kitchen. Yesterday, it was making a PB&J and spooning peanut butter onto the floor instead of the bread, then walking away.

Some incidents are potentially hazardous, like trying to butter toast directly over the toaster or trying to use a baking sheet as a frying pan on the gas range.

Growing up, my social circle was wide but not deep, and now I‚Äôve found myself with basically zero close friends. I‚Äôd love to change that.

What I‚Äôm looking for is pretty simple: someone to talk to. But I believe that there are two very different connection types I am hoping to make. For some of you that may mean just sharing the everyday stuff; what‚Äôs going on at home, what shows you‚Äôre into, swapping stories about parenting (bonus points if you relate to the chaos of autism parenting). But I am also in need of a place to vent, and there are plenty of spaces for that but I am wary of forming a close personal relationship while also ""spilling all the tea"" - so my preference would be to keep things anonymous if what you are looking for is someone to share hard things with as I hope to too. I feel I am very good at being objective and a safe space to talk. 

I know those are two very different vibes, so I‚Äôd always want to be clear which lane we‚Äôre in to start!

Interests-wise, I‚Äôm into music (especially metal/punk/hardcore shows), reading (huge Brandon Sanderson fan, also love Tolkien and Pierce Brown), and nerdy stuff in general. I used to be more into gaming, and I‚Äôve got a background in religion and philosophy ‚Äî though I‚Äôm in a bit of a shaky spiritual place right now, I still love a good conversation. Don't like the history fool you, my previous friends all came from very different backgrounds, I do not judge or preach. 

Honestly, starting up a new hobby with someone would be awesome too!

I‚Äôm open to anonymous online friendships where we can keep things light or deep depending on the day, and also open to real-life connections ‚Äî if you‚Äôre in Michigan and want to grab coffee, hang out, or catch a concert, after we've gotten to know each other really well and feel safe, I‚Äôd be into that.

Platonic connection only. Just looking for someone who gets the value of sharing life, whether that‚Äôs laughing about something dumb, geeking out about books/music, or (lightheartedly) trauma-dumping now and then.",1,1757183618.0,r4r,1,0.66,False

Let me preface with I'm a frequent customer of Starbucks. I live in a small town with two relatively close locations to me and Starbucks is way better than Dunkin so it's typically my go to even though I have to drive an extra 15/20 minutes to get it. I know my baristas at both locations well enough, I always try to be polite and tip, and my orders are never crazy (I'm a basic latte girly at heart, no matter where I'm getting coffee). That being said, I'll say I get my cup written or drawn on probably 1 in every 10 times I go? If that. I also took a trip to NYC for a week and I think out of the 2/3 times I got starbucks I only had my cup written on once. So, is this normal? 

I genuinely don't care if they write on my cup. Honestly, until like 3 days ago, I didn't even know this was a policy, I just thought baristas did it if they felt like it because it would happen randomly to me or someone I knew. I just happened to stumble across this subreddit and I saw all the things about the CEO and forcing baristas to follow these new policies that seem...absolutely insane? And so me with all of my curiosity needs to know like what the reality of this policy is. If anyone wants to clarify that would be cool :) 

If you guys are literally getting written up for not writing on a cup during a rush, I am so sorry. The new Starbucks overhauls sound like literal hell and as a former food service worker- I will be tipping all of my baristas double in honor of all the BS you have to put up with daily.

Found ways to significantly reduce calf twitching. Happy to answer questions for anyone going through this.**

Hey Reddit,

I wanted to share my journey with¬†**Benign Fasciculation Syndrome (BFS)**¬†because I know how isolating and frustrating this condition can be. If you're dealing with constant muscle twitches, fasciculations, or have recently been diagnosed with BFS, this post is for you.

# What is Benign Fasciculation Syndrome?

For those unfamiliar,¬†**Benign Fasciculation Syndrome**¬†is a neurological condition characterized by persistent, involuntary muscle twitches (fasciculations) throughout the body. The key word here is ""benign"" ‚Äì while incredibly annoying and anxiety-provoking, BFS is not life-threatening or progressive like ALS or other serious neurological conditions.

**Common BFS symptoms include:**

* Muscle twitching/fasciculations (most commonly in calves, thighs, arms, and eyelids)
* Muscle cramps
* Muscle stiffness
* Perceived muscle weakness (usually anxiety-related, not actual weakness)
* Fatigue
* Sleep disturbances due to twitching

# My 7-Year BFS Journey

It started in 2017 when I was 28. I noticed persistent twitching in my right calf that wouldn't stop. Within weeks, it spread to both calves, then my thighs, arms, and occasionally my face. Like many of you probably did, I immediately went down the Google rabbit hole and convinced myself I had something terrible.

**The first year was the worst.**¬†The constant twitching was exhausting, both physically and mentally. I saw multiple neurologists, had EMGs (electromyography tests), blood work, MRIs ‚Äì everything came back normal. That's when I received my official BFS diagnosis.

**Years 2-4 were about acceptance.**¬†I learned that stress, caffeine, lack of sleep, and dehydration made my twitching significantly worse. I started tracking patterns and triggers.

**Years 5-7 have been about management and recovery.**¬†This is where I finally found what works for me, especially with calf twitching.

# How I Reduced My Calf Twitching (What Actually Worked)

After years of trial and error, here's what significantly reduced my calf fasciculations:

# 1. Magnesium Supplementation

* **Magnesium Glycinate 400mg before bed**¬†\- This was a game-changer
* Magnesium deficiency can worsen muscle twitching
* Glycinate form is better absorbed and less likely to cause digestive issues

# 2. Targeted Calf Stretching Routine

* **Morning and evening calf stretches**¬†(3 sets of 30 seconds each)
* **Wall push-ups**¬†focusing on calf stretch
* **Foam rolling**¬†my calves daily
* Tight muscles twitch more frequently

# 3. Hydration and Electrolyte Balance

* Minimum 2.5L water daily
* Added¬†**electrolyte powder**¬†to water (not just sports drinks)
* Balanced sodium, potassium, and magnesium intake

# 4. Sleep Optimization

* **Consistent 7-8 hours**¬†of sleep
* No screens 1 hour before bed
* Cool, dark room
* Sleep deprivation was my biggest trigger

# 5. Stress Management

* **Daily meditation**¬†(even just 10 minutes)
* Regular exercise (but not overtraining)
* Therapy to address health anxiety
* BFS and anxiety feed off each other

# 6. Dietary Changes

* **Reduced caffeine**¬†from 3-4 cups to 1 cup of coffee daily
* Limited alcohol consumption
* Increased anti-inflammatory foods
* Regular meal timing (blood sugar stability helps)

# What Didn't Work (Save Your Money)

* Expensive ""twitching supplements"" marketed online
* Elimination diets (unless you have known food sensitivities)
* Excessive vitamin supplementation without deficiency
* Trying to completely stop twitching (acceptance is key)

# Current Status After 7 Years

I still have BFS ‚Äì it's a chronic condition for most people. However, my calf twitching has reduced by about 80%. I might get a few small fasciculations daily instead of constant, visible twitching. Other areas still twitch occasionally, but it's much more manageable.

**The biggest change has been mental.**¬†I no longer panic when I feel twitches. They're just part of my body's quirks now.

# For Those Recently Diagnosed or Worried

**If you're new to this journey:**

1. **Get properly diagnosed**¬†‚Äì See a neurologist, get the tests done
2. **It's probably not what you're afraid of**¬†‚Äì BFS is much more common than serious neurological diseases
3. **Join support groups**¬†‚Äì r/BFS, Facebook groups, and forums help immensely
4. **Focus on triggers**¬†‚Äì Track what makes your twitching worse
5. **Be patient**¬†‚Äì Management strategies take time to show results

# Questions I Often Get Asked

**""Will BFS ever go away completely?""**¬†For some people, yes. For others, it becomes very manageable. Everyone's journey is different.

**""Is BFS related to anxiety?""**¬†There's definitely a connection. Anxiety can trigger twitching, and twitching can cause anxiety. It's a cycle that needs to be addressed holistically.

**""What tests should I ask for?""**¬†EMG, blood work (B12, magnesium, thyroid), and clinical examination are usually sufficient for diagnosis.

**""Can exercise help or hurt?""**¬†Moderate exercise helps me. Overtraining makes it worse. Listen to your body.

# Reach Out If You Need Support

Living with BFS can feel lonely, especially in the beginning. If you have questions about my experience, want to talk about symptoms, or need someone who understands, please don't hesitate to reach out. I'm not a doctor, but I'm someone who's walked this path for 7 years and learned a lot along the way.

**You can DM me or comment below with questions about:**

* Symptom management strategies
* Dealing with health anxiety related to BFS
* Supplement recommendations
* Exercise routines that help
* Finding the right medical professionals
* Coping strategies for work/daily life

# Final Thoughts

BFS is frustrating, scary at first, and can significantly impact quality of life. But it's manageable, and you can absolutely live a full, normal life with it. The key is finding what works for your body and not giving up hope.

For anyone currently in the thick of worry and constant twitching ‚Äì it does get better. Not necessarily because the twitching stops completely, but because you learn to manage it and it loses its power over your life.

Stay strong, trust the process, and remember that you're not alone in this.

*Disclaimer: I'm not a medical professional. This post shares my personal experience with BFS and shouldn't replace professional medical advice. Always consult with healthcare providers for proper diagnosis and treatment.*

We're planning our wedding for next summer. The ceremony at town hall will be at 11:30am, then we'll go to a ch√¢teau that's 40 min away for the reception.

So between the ceremony and the photo session, I think we'll be arriving at the ch√¢teau at 1:30 or 2 pm.

We think of starting with a ""tea party"" maybe at 3:30pm (that would leave the time for the vendors to install everything). We plan to offer some canap√©s, finger snacks and to serve the cake.  There'll be coffee, tea and champagne.

Then we thought on serving dinner around 8pm (three course meal). We'll start the party after dinner.

Does this seem OK ? We fear guests are going to be hungry until 3pm but I don't know how can we start sooner since there must be someone to greet the vendors.

My dear brothers and sisters in the Kolkata community,

I was reading an ancient text - and let me tell you, this text contains profound wisdom that applies directly to our life in the City of Joy.

The text categorizes blessings into three types. Number one: Natural blessings - the Ganges flowing through our city, the monsoons that cool our summers, the fertile Bengal delta that feeds us. Number two: Daily rhythms - the morning fish market at Shyambazar, the evening adda at College Street, the seasonal pujas that mark our calendar. Number three: Everything we need - including cultural heritage and intellectual tradition we don't even realize we possess.

Now the text makes a very profound statement: ""If you tried to count all your blessings, you could not finish counting them.""

Let me ask you a question. How many treasures does Kolkata offer you? Can you count them? We have Victoria Memorial and Howrah Bridge as architectural marvels. We have College Street - the largest second-hand book market in the world. We have Kumartuli where clay becomes Durga Ma's murti. We have tram rides that no other Indian city can offer. We have rosogolla and mishti doi that Bengalis worldwide crave.

But what does this ancient text say about human nature? It says humans are ""ungrateful and transgressive.""

Is this not exactly what we see even among Kolkata people? Someone posts about our heritage buildings and comments are ""government should maintain better"" or ""Delhi has better metro."" We complain about power cuts when we have intellectual discussions that continue by candlelight. We say ""Kolkata is declining"" while living in a city that produced Nobel Prize winners, film directors, and poets who influenced entire subcontinent.

This is not to ignore real challenges - no, my friends. Infrastructure needs improvement. Employment opportunities are limited. But this is to point out a logical inconsistency in our thinking.

We have Rabindra Sangeet being sung in every para. We have football passion that makes Maidan come alive during Mohun Bagan vs East Bengal. We have Durga Puja that transforms entire city into art gallery. We have Coffee House where revolution was once planned. We have hand-pulled rickshaws - unique transportation heritage.

Yet we focus on what's missing instead of celebrating what makes Kolkata the cultural capital of India.

The person who wrote this text lived when people rarely left their village. Yet he understood something about human psychology that we, living in this culturally rich metropolis, still struggle with.

Think about it logically.

Are we truly grateful for the privilege of living in Kolkata - where every street has history, every corner has a story, every festival becomes a celebration of humanity? Or are we proving the ancient author's point about human nature?

I'm curious what other collections or hobbies are competing for your wallet's attention. Are you also deep into:

* **Mechanical or automatic watches?** (That satisfying click of a fountain pen cap has the same energy as a watch's sweep second hand)
* **Quality leather goods?** (Because if you're carrying a beautiful pen, it deserves an equally beautiful case/wallet/bag)
* **Mechanical keyboards?** (Another ""why would you spend that much on something to write with?"" hobby)
* **Vinyl/HiFi audio?** (Analog appreciation society, anyone?)
* **Pocket knives or EDC gear?** (Tools with soul)
* **Vintage clothing or quality shoes?** (r/goodyearwelt calling...)
* **Coffee/espresso equipment?** (The morning ritual pairs well with journaling)
* **Film photography?** (More analog love)

Despite this it only cost's 1 microfusion cell per shot, who's ammo consumption can be dropped even further with it's Re-charger Chip.

Now you may be thinking ""But it breaks after like 5 shots."" This is true, but it's actually not that much of an issue. With 50 Repair, you can craft repair kits. It just so happens that the very DLC the LAER is in gives you a TON of resources that could be crafted into repair kits.  
  
Muggy can turn Coffee Mugs and Plates into Wonderglue and Scrap Metal respectively, while also being able to produce 5 Scrap Electronics a day. When Upgraded, the Book Chute can convert Clipboards into Duct Tape and Scrap Metal, as well as converting Pencils into Lead and Scrap Metal. And finally, the Toaster gives 1 Scrap Electronics for every toaster it receives. That accounts for 4 out of 5 of the materials needed to make repair kits. The only thing missing are wrenches, and you can still find plenty of those through out the DLC.

And that's not even getting into Lonesome Road's upgrades to EDE, which allows it to repair up to 35% your weapon's durability for free.

If a stranger took $35 from your wallet without asking, you‚Äôd call the police. If they did it over and over, you‚Äôd expect the justice system to step in.

But over the last few decades, a shift occurred. With technology lowering the cost of providing banking services, banks faced a problem ‚Äî how to keep revenue high without actually offering more. The solution? Instead of charging for services rendered, they began charging for¬†*mistakes.*

Overdraft fees. Late payment fees. Minimum balance penalties. Returned item fees. The list grew longer and more creative, with banks learning they could rake in billions from customers who made small, human errors ‚Äî errors the bank‚Äôs own systems could easily prevent.

Today, overdraft fees alone bring in billions annually, despite the fact that modern banking software could simply decline a transaction before it triggers a penalty. But why prevent the fee when you can collect it?

# The ‚ÄúService‚Äù No One Asked For

Imagine a grocery store that lets you walk out with a bag of groceries knowing your card won‚Äôt go through, then mails you a bill for five times the cost of the food. Outrageous, right? Yet that‚Äôs essentially how many overdraft programs work.

Banks frame these fees as a ‚Äúcourtesy‚Äù ‚Äî covering your shortfall so your transaction goes through. But this ‚Äúcourtesy‚Äù is rarely optional, often applied automatically, and far more expensive than the shortfall itself. In some cases, customers end up paying more in fees than the actual amount overdrawn.

And while some banks claim they‚Äôve reduced or eliminated overdraft fees in recent years, many have quietly replaced them with¬†*new*¬†fees that achieve the same goal: transferring money from the customer‚Äôs pocket to the bank‚Äôs balance sheet.

# Fine Print as a Weapon

The legality of fee farming rests on one thing: the contract. Buried deep in the fine print of your account agreement ‚Äî an agreement you ‚Äúaccepted‚Äù by opening the account ‚Äî are the clauses that give the bank the right to charge these penalties.

Of course, no one actually reads these agreements. They‚Äôre deliberately long, confusing, and full of legal jargon. This isn‚Äôt an accident; it‚Äôs a design choice. The fine print exists not to inform you but to protect the bank when you inevitably protest.

In court, the bank doesn‚Äôt have to prove you understood the terms ‚Äî only that you agreed to them. And thanks to lobbying, the laws governing these agreements almost always favor the institution over the individual.

# The Government‚Äôs Role in Protecting the Harvest

If fee farming is so blatantly exploitative, why hasn‚Äôt it been outlawed? The short answer: money and influence.

The financial industry spends hundreds of millions of dollars each year on lobbying. That money buys access to lawmakers, shapes the regulatory environment, and ensures that any ‚Äúreform‚Äù efforts are watered down before they ever reach the president‚Äôs desk.

Consider the Credit CARD Act of 2009. While it did place limits on certain fees, banks quickly found ways to offset the losses by creating new ones. Why? Because the law was riddled with loopholes, thanks to heavy industry involvement in its drafting.

# The Human Cost of Penalty-Based Profit

For those living paycheck to paycheck ‚Äî nearly 60% of Americans ‚Äî a single overdraft fee can trigger a financial spiral. That $35 charge might mean less grocery money, a missed bill, or another overdraft as you scramble to recover. The bank‚Äôs system doesn‚Äôt care; in fact, it‚Äôs designed to maximize the number of times this can happen in a single day.

Some banks process larger transactions first, draining your account faster and triggering more overdrafts from smaller purchases. They call this ‚Äúhigh-to-low processing‚Äù and claim it helps customers by ensuring important payments go through first. In reality, it‚Äôs a tactic to multiply fees.

The result? People who can least afford it are paying the most ‚Äî a regressive tax collected not by the government but by private corporations with government-approved power.

# Why Is This Acceptable?

The ugly truth is that fee farming is acceptable because it‚Äôs invisible to those who don‚Äôt experience it regularly. Middle- and upper-income customers rarely overdraft, and if they do, they can absorb the cost. Lawmakers, regulators, and lobbyists all fall into this category, making it easy to dismiss the problem as a ‚Äúpersonal responsibility‚Äù issue.

This narrative ‚Äî that overdrafts and penalties are the result of bad financial habits ‚Äî serves the banks well. It shifts blame from the institution to the individual, ignoring the fact that the system is¬†*engineered*¬†to produce these outcomes.

# What Needs to Change

Fixing fee farming would require more than capping fees or tweaking rules. It would require dismantling the incentive structure that makes penalty revenue so profitable. Some possible reforms include:

1. **Real-Time Declines**¬†‚Äì Require banks to decline transactions that would overdraft an account unless the customer opts in.
2. **Proportional Fees**¬†‚Äì Limit penalty fees to a percentage of the shortfall, preventing $35 charges for a $2 overdraft.
3. **Fee Transparency**¬†‚Äì Mandate clear, upfront disclosure of all fees in plain language, not buried in fine print.
4. **Ban Predatory Processing**¬†‚Äì Outlaw transaction reordering designed to maximize fees.
5. **End Mandatory Arbitration**¬†‚Äì Allow customers to challenge abusive fees in court rather than being forced into bank-friendly arbitration.

These changes wouldn‚Äôt destroy the banking industry; they‚Äôd simply shift it back toward making money by¬†*serving customers*¬†instead of exploiting them.

# The Bottom Line

Fee farming isn‚Äôt a glitch in the system ‚Äî it¬†*is*¬†the system. It‚Äôs a business model that thrives on customer mistakes, backed by legal frameworks designed to protect the harvester, not the harvested.

As long as lawmakers continue to prioritize campaign donations over consumer protection, banks will keep sowing penalties and reaping profits. And as long as the public accepts the narrative that fees are a personal failing rather than a structural trap, the harvest will continue.

The next time a $35 fee shows up on your statement for a $1.50 coffee, remember: this isn‚Äôt an accident, and it isn‚Äôt inevitable. It‚Äôs a deliberate choice ‚Äî one your bank makes every day, with the government‚Äôs blessing.

Why is this acceptable?

When we first moved in, a towel that we had brought over had a huge gash in it, and my coffee pod portafilter' handle for my espresso machine had huge, ragged slashes in it. I tried to recreate the slashes with scissors or a knife but they barely made a scratch on the material. I ended up taking some lavender, catnip, and pipssewa and sprinkling it in the corners of every room, and at the edges of every doorway. I went into the basement and spoke to the energy and told it that my partner and I want to live there harmoniously with them, we do not want to kick them out of the space they have been in before them, and that I hope we can be at peace. I said I would do an offering every Sunday, which I have not upkept, as maybe once or twice a month I do an offering. These usually consist of baked goods, sugar cubes, flowers, and tea. 

This past Sunday, our male cat got out. There has been no sign of him since. A few false hopes but nothing real. Today, Saturday, while my partner and I were getting ready for a market I was going to take place in, our female cat got out. They are a bonded pair and they are my partner's babies. They are the reason he called an ambulance when he attempted suicide before we met. We are devastated.

I know I need to make it up to whatever energy is in this house, so I plan on making an entire loaf of banana bread with the rest of my favourite honey as an offering, along with flowers, tea, herbs, and sugar cubes. I need to know what else I can do. What kind of spells can I do to bring the cats back, if they can be brought back? If they can't, if they're gone for good, how can I bring peace to my partner?

I‚Äôve spent the last 6 months really working on myself. I know everyone says that, but I‚Äôve been doing therapy twice a week, daily practice, and actually facing the things I used to avoid. I‚Äôve learned how much my insecurity, anxiety, and overreactions got in the way before. It wasn‚Äôt fair to you, and it wasn‚Äôt healthy for me. I‚Äôm more grounded, more secure, and I finally feel like I can stand on my own. 

The closer we got the more you pushed away. I needed closeness and reassurance, while you needed space and independence. We fell hard because the pull was so intense, but it got toxic because neither of us had the skills to handle it. I believe it‚Äôs the fear and habits that got in the way of a potential healthy connection.

Unfortunately, because of this, I still hold hope you‚Äôll come back. I‚Äôve tried everything to forget, detach, and move on, but I care about you so fucking much. 

There‚Äôs a reason I always had your coffee ready in the morning, left notes in your lunch, and surprised you with the things you told me you liked. You‚Äôre the first person I‚Äôve done those things for, and you showed me how much I could love someone.

I don‚Äôt expect anything from sharing this. I just wanted you to know that I‚Äôve grown, and I truly wish you the best. You deserve good things. You deserve unconditional love.

Natalie‚Äôs backpack.
He looked down at his feet and realized they were bare, cut up and swollen. Each breath came as a faint cloud in the cold.

His shirt stained with something dark. 
It was Thomas.
Earlier that night, at a mom and pops grocery, the fluorescent lights buzzed overhead. 
A soft hum of refrigerators. The store was nearly empty. Thomas stood in line, barefoot. His clothes mismatched, gray sweatpants, a wrinkled button-up, unbuttoned.  His face was slack, eyes unfocused. A bottle of bleach dangled loosely in his hand.
In front of him, a woman, early 20's who reminded him of his mother, dark brown hair tied back. She placed a few items on the conveyor belt: Redbull, a bag of Middlesworth chips, and ramen noodles. The register beeped. ""$33.00 even,"" the cashier said flatly. Thomas blinked.
The woman reached into her purse. Thomas tilted his head, staring at the glowing digital screen.

The woman turned slightly, uneasy. ‚ÄúExcuse me?"" He didn‚Äôt respond. Then suddenly, he stepped forward. Close. Too close.  The bleach bottle slipped from his hand, crashing to the floor with a dull thud. ‚ÄúSir?‚Äù the cashier said, her tone rising. The woman in front of him gasped. ‚ÄúWhat are you...?‚Äù Thomas‚Äôs hand reached into his pocket, slowly. The cashier reached for the phone under the counter. But before anything more could happen, A store employee rushed over. ‚ÄúHey! Sir, you, okay?‚Äù Thomas blinked rapidly.
Again, his body stiffened, awareness crashing into him like ice water. He looked down. 
The bottle of bleach. The cold tile beneath his bare feet. The frightened faces around him.
He backed away. ‚ÄúI.... I don‚Äôt know how I got here...‚Äù The manager‚Äôs voice softened. ‚ÄúSir, are you hurt? Do you need help?‚Äù Thomas looked at the register one last time. $33.00... still blinking on the screen. He turned and fled out the automatic doors, into the night.

Chapter 4: On The Razors Edge

Moments later the streetlamps flickered as Thomas ran from the grocery store on 17th and Derry... barefoot, breath ragged.  He looked up and seen he was standing at the address ""1733"". His eyes were vacant again.  Something inside him had shifted. His vision blurred. 
 The world shimmered.  Dreamlike.... He wandered into a side alley near the store. Trash bins. Flickering neon from a nearby bar. 
A woman‚Äôs voice echoed‚Äî ‚ÄúHey Thomas, are you okay?‚Äù Thomas turned slowly. The same young woman from the store... Redbull and chips still in hand...she had followed him, concerned.  ‚ÄúYou dropped this,‚Äù she said softly, holding out a bottle of bleach. She took a step closer. Thomas blinked, long, slow.  His pupils dilated. Something behind his eyes turned off. THOMAS (confused)... ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs always thirty-three.‚Äù, She froze. ‚ÄúSir? ‚ÄúHe stepped forward. 
Close.  Unblinking. In his hand: a small utility razor. He didn‚Äôt remember pulling it out.
The woman says ‚ÄúWait....what are you?‚Äù, Her voice cut short. A dull, wet sound. Blood hit the concrete.  Her body slumped beside the dumpster. Thomas stood over her, breathing shallowly.  No expression, Then, slowly, he crouched down. His fingers trembled... then steadied. He carved something into her chest.  A symbol 33, The same one from his mother‚Äôs crime scene. From the others. Then, as quickly as it came, reality snapped back in place.

Chapter 5: Coming Home

THOMAS (gasping) ‚ÄúNo... no, no, no...‚Äù He looked at his hands. Bloody. Shaking.
The woman‚Äôs lifeless eyes stared back. A siren wailed somewhere in the distance.  He bolted, vanishing into the night. After coming home, his eyes were wide, blank, distant. 
He was sleepwalking.  He moved slowly, almost animalistic, clutching a razor blade in his right hand.  As he passed the living room mirror, his reflection followed.... but he didn‚Äôt notice. Without a sound, Thomas climbed the stairs...
At the top of the stairs..., Natalie‚Äôs bedroom, a soft nightlight glowed. Stuffed animals surrounded the sleeping girl.  Peaceful.  The door creaked open. Thomas entered, razor blade in hand. As he takes a step closer, he hears Natalie whispering in her sleep ""Daddy, is everything okay?‚Äù From down the hall... ‚ÄúAiesha (groggy): ...
Thomas...? 
What are you doing?‚Äù ....
Aiesha stood in the hallway, squinting through the dark. Thomas turned slowly. 
He blinked. 
Once. 
Twice. 
Woke up. ‚ÄúAiesha?‚Äù Thomas muttered. 
Then Thomas looked at the razor blade, and down...his feet were soaked in blood. 

Chapter 6: The Clock Repair

That morning when Carla got off work from PENNHURST Institution her kitchen smelled like lemon cleaner and cinnamon toast. Thomas sat at the table, cross-legged in a worn sweatshirt, carefully unscrewing the back of a broken mantel clock. His mother hummed behind him, stirring a pot of soup.
‚ÄúCareful with that spring,‚Äù she said, without looking. ‚ÄúYou know it‚Äôll snap your finger off if you rush it.‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôm not rushing,‚Äù Thomas said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm being surgical.‚Äù
She chuckled, setting a bowl beside him. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre something alright. A nine-year-old surgeon with sleep in his eyes and jelly on his elbow.‚Äù
Thomas grinned and wiped it off. ‚ÄúI want to fix it before 3:33p.m.‚Äù
His mother froze for just a moment, spoon mid-air. ‚ÄúWhy that time?‚Äù He shrugged; eyes locked on the tiny gears. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs just stuck there. Maybe if I fix it, time will start again.‚Äù She looked at him then, a shadow of worry passing behind her smile. ‚ÄúWell... maybe you‚Äôre right.‚Äù They sat in companionable quiet for a moment, the ticking of another wall clock in the background the only sound. Outside, kids yelled faintly down the block. Inside, Thomas finally clicked a piece into place, and the clock‚Äôs hands twitched.
‚ÄúDid you hear that?‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe tick?‚Äù He nodded. His mother leaned in, kissed the top of his head. ‚ÄúMaybe you‚Äôve got a little magic in you, Tommy. Or maybe you‚Äôre just my little engineer.‚Äù Thomas smiled. ‚ÄúLike Dad?‚Äù Something faltered in her face, but only briefly.
""No,‚Äù she said softly. ‚ÄúBetter.‚Äù She tousled his hair and turned back to the stove.
He looked at the clock again. The hands had moved, now they sat at 3:32p.m.
	Carla carried the soup pot to the counter, her movements slower now, thoughtful.
‚ÄúDo you know what time I hate most, Tommy?‚Äù she asked softly. He shook his head,

‚ÄúThree thirty-three.‚Äù

The words made the kitchen seem colder, though the stove still glowed.

Thomas glanced at the mantel clock he was fixing. ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù

	Carla hesitated, chewing the inside of her cheek. Finally, she set the ladle down. ‚ÄúBack at Pennhurst, the night staff used to whisper about it. They said if you were in the east wing when the elevator doors opened at 3:33 in the morning, you‚Äôd end up on a floor that didn‚Äôt exist. They called it the third floor.‚Äù

Thomas blinked. ‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶ every hospital has a third floor.‚Äù

	She shook her head quickly. ‚ÄúNot this one. Pennhurst had only two, at least on the blueprints. But the stories never stopped. Some swore they saw lights above the second floor, where no lights should be. Others heard a bell ding in the middle of the night when the elevators weren‚Äôt running.‚Äù

	Her voice grew lower. ‚ÄúOne nurse‚Ä¶ she was on shift the night of November third, 1973. She took the service elevator to deliver linens. The log said she pressed for the second floor. But when the doors opened, she never came back out. They searched everywhere. Cameras caught nothing except the doors closing at 3:33. They ruled it a disappearance. Some of the staff swore she stepped onto the third floor.‚Äù

	Thomas stared at the clock gears, his small fingers trembling. ‚ÄúDid anyone find her?‚Äù
Carla‚Äôs smile faltered. She touched his cheek, too quickly. ‚ÄúNo. And that‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt work nights anymore.‚Äù
Her voice dropped, almost a whisper. ‚ÄúSome doors aren‚Äôt meant to open, Tommy. Not at 3:33.‚Äù


Chapter 7: Crime Scene 

The next morning at the Homicide Division, the coffee pot gurgled, and phones rang. Thomas sat at his cluttered desk, pale and exhausted. Detective Darlene Coefield, early 30s, sharp and efficient..., approached.  ‚ÄúAnother one.  Off Derry Street... Looks like our guy again.‚Äù Thomas didn‚Äôt speak. He stood and grabbed his coat.  ‚ÄúYou sleep at all?‚Äù Darlene asked.  ‚ÄúSome. Maybe. I don‚Äôt remember.‚Äù  She raised an eyebrow but let it go. 
During the car ride over, Darlene‚Äôs suspicion starts to grow towards Thomas. Randomly questioning his actions from earlier in the day.
As they arrive a yellow tape flapped in the breeze on a dark, gloomy side street. Officers moved around quietly as forensics photographed the body of a woman.  The symbol 33 had been carved into her chest. No signs of abuse.  No signs of struggle.  Just blood and silence... Thomas crouched near the body. His eyes locked onto one of the symbols. Something twitched in his brain.  A flicker of fire...
A symbol scratched into wood, A child‚Äôs sob echoing in the dark... Thomas gasped and snapped out of memory. ‚ÄúNo prints.  No DNA.  Just like the last two,‚Äù a forensic tech said. ‚ÄúWhoever this is...‚Äù Darlene whispered to him, ‚Äúthey know how to vanish.‚Äù, Thomas‚Äôs hand trembled. He slipped it into his pocket. 

Chapter 8: The Night Visitor

The streetlight buzzed faintly over a quiet duplex on Rudy Road at 3:33 a.m. Inside, the glow of a television lit the living room, where a young schoolteacher named Marsha Woodward had dozed off grading papers. Her front door was locked.  Her windows shut, But the sliding back door creaked open. Bare feet padded across the hard wood floors. Thomas moved in silence.  Unblinking, His eyes distant, dead to the world.  He stepped through the kitchen, passing family photos and sticky notes. 
In his hand, a small razor blade, rusted, pulled from a shed he didn‚Äôt remember entering.
Marsha stirred on the couch, sensing something... She sat up, groggy... ‚ÄúHello?‚Äù, Thomas stood motionless in the doorway, shadowed. Her eyes widened. ‚ÄúWhat the hell, who are you?‚Äù She reached for her phone. Thomas moved fast. A dull crack echoed through the room as the razor blade deepened to the flesh. 
Once... Twice.... Blood spilled across her grading sheets. Her body collapsed to the floor.
He kneeled.... Unblinking.... And carved.... A symbol... 33, etched into her shoulder blade, deep and precise. Then the fog lifted. Thomas looked down in horror.  At the body.  There Marsha laying lifeless, motionless, with a faint heartbeat. The blood on his arms.  The razor blade trembling in his grip.
