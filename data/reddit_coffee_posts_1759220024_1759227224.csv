I‚Äôm 44 and my wife is 44. She works on an art advisory committee, so attending galas, events, and client meetings is part of her job. She often meets clients for coffee, lunch, or dinner, and I don‚Äôt always know the details and that‚Äôs completely normal because it‚Äôs part of her work. She‚Äôs always professional, transparent about her friendships, and I trust her judgment completely.

Recently, she mentioned she‚Äôs going to a gala with a friend, S. He‚Äôs a wealthy client she met about a year ago, and they became friends professionally. She introduced me to him once, and he seems like a genuinely good person. He invited her as his ‚Äúdate‚Äù to this gala, and my wife said it‚Äôs fine.

I fully trust her, and I know that interacting socially with clients is part of her job. But I can‚Äôt help feeling a bit uncomfortable about her attending as someone‚Äôs ‚Äúdate.‚Äù I don‚Äôt want to stop her or come off as controlling, because I know she‚Äôs completely trustworthy and this is a professional relationship.

I think I did't add full context 

This isn‚Äôt just any gala it‚Äôs a high end event organized by a billionaire, with lots of wealthy guests and even some Royal family members. My wife had mentioned months ago that she was excited to attend this gala, and going will be excellent for her networking and attracting future clients.

I wanted to see if it was possible to go from an idea ‚Üí to a full personalized book in minutes.

After a bunch of late nights and way too much coffee, I ended up with something that actually works: an AI book generator that creates custom books on literally any topic you feed it.

I‚Äôve been testing it with friends (one made a ‚ÄúDad jokes survival guide,‚Äù another did ‚ÄúAI investing 101‚Äù), and the results have been pretty wild.

I‚Äôd love some feedback from you all‚Äîwhat kind of book would you generate if you had the chance?

The air cushion has a very obvious cushioning effect. It is soft when stepped on and feels very comfortable when walking. Even if you go out for a long time, your feet will not feel tired.

shoes2:The canvas and suede stitching material is very textured, the sole is light and supportive, and the foot feels particularly light when walking. The shoe shape is very wrappable and does not rub the ankles at all.

shoes3:The dark green upper with a white hook gives it a retro feel. Although the sole is not heavy, it is very light when walking. The foot feels like it is being gently supported and the foot does not feel tired even after walking for a long time.

shoes4ÔºöThe red and gold color combination is very striking! The rich red upper is matched with the golden snake, and the cushioning feedback is sharp. The sole follows the foot tightly when starting, giving you a full sense of security when playing.

shoes5ÔºöThe overall look is simple yet refined, and the workmanship is solid. The foot feel is still comfortable, and the support gives a sense of security. The black and white tones are very fashionable when paired with sports pants or casual pants.

First five days 5mg, now five days 10mg them 15mg etc. The very first dose of 5mg made me super tired. Now after increasing it‚Äús the same again. 
On the plus side I feel calmer inside. I don‚Äôt have the need to fidget as much and things that would make me extremely nervous now don‚Äòt stress me out as much. I also don‚Äòt feel irritated and impatient as fast as before taking medication. Which comes back as soon as it is out of my system so I do think it is the effect of the medication.
My problem: it makes my head super slow. When before I could not stick to a thought because the next one would come too fast, now I can‚Äôt stick to a thought cause there is none?  
So even though my head is more quiet, I can‚Äôt focus better. The last two days I added some coffee 2hrs after taking my medication, because I am at an internship and need to be able to think. With coffee, my focus is better but then my inner restlessness and nervousness come back. 

Does anyone have similar experiences? Will it get better with higher dose? Does my body need to get used to it? Or is this medication simply not for me?

1nu8y0g,https://www.reddit.com/r/KoreaSeoulBeauty/comments/1nu8y0g/my_honest_review_on_a_korean_skin_clinic/,My honest review on a Korean skin clinic,"Hey guys!!

So I went to a skin clinic in Seoul last week and honestly had such a good experience that I thought I‚Äôd share. They just opened recently and I noticed there weren‚Äôt any reviews, so maybe this helps someone who‚Äôs debating where to go.

My hotel was near Sinnonhyeon, and my original plan was to hit up PPEUM Clinic since that‚Äôs the one everyone knows. But idk‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs SO famous that the reviews felt kinda ad-y, and I wasn‚Äôt sure if I wanted to trust that. While googling around I found out there‚Äôs a brand new clinic in the same building as PPEUM, so I decided to give that a shot. It was called ‚ÄúSeye Clinic‚Äù.

OMG the second I walked in, I was shook. The place is HUGE and the interior design is sooo aesthetic. I‚Äôve watched a million TikToks about Korean clinics, but this was my first time actually visiting one, and it was way bigger and prettier than I expected.

The staff greeted me right away and were super sweet. Also‚Ä¶ why are all the staff so pretty?? Like it instantly made me feel like I was in good hands lol.

Before choosing treatments, they did a skin analysis. I‚Äôve seen on TikTok that most places either use a 2D scanner or the doctor just eyeballs it, but here they used a legit 3D machine. Lowkey hated how the pics looked (brutal lol) but it was super detailed and felt very scientific.

Based on the results, we did a consult and I ended up getting Ulthera, Thermage, and Rejuran as a package. I originally thought I‚Äôd just do Ulthera + Rejuran/JuveLook, but they had so many package options. So even if you‚Äôre not 100% sure what to get, don‚Äôt worry‚Äîthey‚Äôll figure out what your skin actually needs.

Now here‚Äôs the wild part: in the US this would‚Äôve been at least $4k, but I paid under $2k. INSANE. And the best part? The prices matched exactly what I saw on their website beforehand‚Äîno hidden fees, no sketchy add-ons. Everything was super transparent.

Okay but real talk, girls‚Ä¶ it HURT. I mentally prepped but yeah, it was still painful. I‚Äôve heard some clinics lower the energy for foreigners (so it doesn‚Äôt hurt as much), but I think they went full strength on me lol. One week later though, my skin is literally glowing like a K-pop idol‚Äôs, so honestly worth every second. No pain, no gain, right? ‚ú®

Also loved that every treatment was done in a private room. It wasn‚Äôt like a big open area‚Äîjust me and the medical staff in a private space, which made it easier to like‚Ä¶ ugly-cry through the pain üòÇ. At first I thought it was some princess treatment just for me, but turns out that‚Äôs their standard for everyone.

Afterwards I chilled at the little caf√© inside the clinic and had a free coffee made by an actual barista (and it was GOOD??). They even had a tax refund machine inside, which was super convenient.

1nu8xg3,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpotlessSecrets/comments/1nu8xg3/explore_if_method_liquid_laundry_detergent_really/,Explore If Method Liquid Laundry Detergent Really Beats Tough Stains,"**A Fresh Take on Laundry Day with Method 1793901490**  

Washing clothes used to feel like such a boring chore for me‚Äîuntil I started testing products regularly. Enter Method 1793901490, a liquid laundry detergent with a bold Ginger Mango scent and an impressive reputation for being eco-friendly. I had read reviews raving about its biodegradable formula and plant-based cleaning power, so naturally, I had to see if it lived up to the hype in my daily laundry routine. Spoiler: it was good, but not without its quirks.

**An Attractive and Functional Bottle**  

The first thing that caught my eye was the stylish, compact bottle made from 100% recycled materials. It‚Äôs not just pretty to look at; it‚Äôs also incredibly practical. The handle and spout design made it super easy to pour without spills‚Äîeven when I was rushing to throw the laundry in before running errands. The downside I noticed, though, is that the colorful branding doesn‚Äôt immediately tell you how potent this detergent is. At first glance, you might mistake it for a fancy juice bottle! 

**Tough on Stains Without Being Harsh**  

Let me just say, I wasn‚Äôt prepared for how strong yet gentle this detergent is. My partner tends to spill coffee on everything, and my kids think every shirt is a canvas for ketchup experiments. Method‚Äôs plant-based formula handled it all‚Äîwhether it was dark stains on denim or smelly gym socks‚Äîwithout fading bright colors or roughening up fabrics. If you‚Äôve been burned before by a liquid detergent that left your favorite tees in a sad, faded mess, you won‚Äôt have to worry about that here.  

[Check Method 1793901490 price on Amazon.](https://blog.senaar.com/p/b00wkwt47q/)  

**Boons**  

- Hypoallergenic formula, perfect for my sensitive-skinned youngest kid.
- Keeps whites white and colors vibrant.
- A concentrated formula that lasted me well past a month for a family of four.
- Contains a biodegradable formula, which made me feel better about its environmental impact.

**The Ginger Mango Fragrance: Sweet, but Strong**  

The Ginger Mango scent deserves its own paragraph because, wow, is it powerful. When I first opened the bottle, the tropical, spicy aroma quite literally filled the laundry room. Some people love an intense, lingering fragrance, and while it smelled great on our towels, I found myself avoiding it for bedsheets. I lean toward subtle, neutral scents for items that are used daily, and this one left a strong aroma behind. If powerful scents aren‚Äôt your thing, you may want to skip it or dilute the recommended dose.  

**Areas for Improvement**  

- The scent might be overwhelming for those who prefer milder fragrances.
- The bottle doesn‚Äôt come with a precise measuring cap, making it tricky not to overuse the concentrated formula.
- Not the most budget-friendly detergent on the market, particularly compared to store-brand alternatives.
- While it‚Äôs great for home use, taking this bottle to a laundromat isn‚Äôt the most travel-friendly option due to its size. 

**Peer Products**  

I must admit, Method‚Äôs liquid detergent has some competition. Tide, for instance, offers detergents that specialize in deep cleaning, particularly for greasy messes, and they often come with a wider range of scent options, including unscented. On the other hand, Seventh Generation has a plant-based formula like Method but lacks the same vibrancy in fragrance. In terms of sustainability, Method is leagues ahead with its use of 100% post-consumer recycled bottles. If you love eco-consciousness and bold scents, it edges out the others, but for stain-fighting on heavy-duty messes, I‚Äôd still give Tide an honorable mention.

**True Value**  

For someone like me who is trying to juggle parenthood, work, and a conscious effort to use eco-friendly products, I‚Äôd say Method's liquid detergent strikes a solid balance between performance and environmental responsibility. Is it the cheapest option available? No, but with 66 loads per 53.5-ounce bottle, the price aligns with its premium formula and sustainable packaging. Considering how effective it is, I didn‚Äôt feel like I was wasting money buying this as part of my regular routine.

However, navigating FanDuel's geographic restrictions can be confusing‚Äîand making the wrong choices could cost you your account, your winnings, or worse. This comprehensive guide explains how to access FanDuel safely and legally while protecting your personal and financial data.

# Where Is FanDuel Legal? The Complete State Breakdown

As of September 2025, FanDuel operates legally in specific U.S. states, but availability varies depending on which FanDuel product you want to use.

# FanDuel Sportsbook Legal States

FanDuel Sportsbook is currently available in **23 states plus Washington D.C.**:

Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia, Wyoming, and Washington D.C.

# FanDuel Casino Legal States

FanDuel Casino has more limited availability, operating only in:

* Connecticut
* Michigan
* New Jersey
* Pennsylvania
* West Virginia

# FanDuel Daily Fantasy Sports (DFS) Legal States

Daily Fantasy Sports enjoys the broadest availability across the United States, with **FanDuel Fantasy available in 45+ states**. The notable exceptions where DFS is NOT available include:

* Hawaii
* Idaho
* Montana
* Nevada
* Washington

**Important Update**: Missouri is expected to launch FanDuel Sportsbook in Fall 2025, representing the platform's next major expansion.

# Why These Restrictions Exist

FanDuel's geographic limitations aren't arbitrary‚Äîthey're mandated by state law. Each state maintains independent authority over gambling regulation, creating a patchwork of different rules across the country. FanDuel must comply with these regulations to maintain its licenses and legal standing.

Some states prohibit online gambling entirely, while others permit only specific forms (like fantasy sports but not sports betting). FanDuel carefully monitors these regulations and adjusts its service availability accordingly.

# Legitimate Ways To Access FanDuel

If you want to use FanDuel legally and safely, here are your options:

# 1. Travel to a Legal State

**You can use FanDuel in any legal state even if you're not a resident**. The requirement is simple: you must be physically present within state borders when placing bets or joining contests.

For example, if you live in California (where FanDuel Sportsbook isn't available), you can legally use the platform while visiting Arizona, Nevada (retail only), or any other legal state. Your winnings remain accessible even after you return home.

**Pro Tip**: FanDuel uses advanced geolocation technology called GeoComply to verify your location in real-time. This system combines GPS, WiFi signals, and IP address data to ensure you're genuinely within legal boundaries.

# 2. Consider Relocation

If accessing FanDuel is important to you, consider whether living in a legal state aligns with your other life goals. **23 states now offer FanDuel Sportsbook**, providing numerous options for potential relocation.

# 3. Use Available FanDuel Products in Your State

Remember that FanDuel offers multiple products with different geographic restrictions:

* **Can't access Sportsbook?** Try FanDuel Fantasy (Daily Fantasy Sports), which operates in far more states.
* **Looking for alternative entertainment?** FanDuel Faceoff offers skill-based games available in many states where Sportsbook isn't permitted.

# The VPN Temptation: Why You Should Never Use One to Bypass Restrictions

Many online articles suggest using a VPN to access FanDuel from restricted states. **This is dangerous advice that could have serious consequences.**

# Why VPNs Are Prohibited

FanDuel's Terms of Service explicitly prohibit users from using ""proxy servers or any other software or technology to misrepresent your identity or location."" Using a VPN to bypass geographic restrictions constitutes a clear violation of these terms.

# Real Consequences You Face

**Account Suspension or Permanent Ban**: FanDuel actively detects and blocks VPN usage. If caught, your account will likely be suspended immediately.

**Forfeiture of Funds**: Perhaps most devastating, **FanDuel may withhold your entire account balance**‚Äîincluding deposits and winnings‚Äîif they determine you violated their Terms of Service by using location-masking technology.

**Legal Complications**: Depending on your state's laws, online gambling in prohibited jurisdictions could result in criminal charges. For instance, Utah law imposes up to six months imprisonment and $1,000 fines for illegal gambling.

**KYC Verification Issues**: FanDuel requires identity verification through Know Your Customer (KYC) processes. Even if a VPN initially works, you'll face significant problems during account verification, withdrawal requests, or customer service interactions when your real location doesn't match your account activity.

# How FanDuel Detects VPNs

FanDuel employs sophisticated detection technology that makes VPN circumvention nearly impossible:

**GeoComply Technology**: This industry-leading system performs **over 1.2 billion geolocation checks monthly** across gaming platforms. It analyzes:

* GPS coordinates
* WiFi network triangulation
* IP address databases
* Device integrity signals
* Historical location patterns

**The system can detect**:

* VPN servers and data centers
* Proxy services and anonymizers
* Tor exit nodes
* GPS spoofing attempts
* WiFi emulators
* Remote desktop connections

Even premium VPNs with ""obfuscation"" features struggle against GeoComply's multi-layered verification approach.

# How To Secure Your FanDuel Account (For Legal Users)

If you're already in a legal state and using FanDuel legitimately, security should be your priority. Here's where a VPN like NordVPN serves a completely legitimate purpose.

# Legitimate Security Uses for VPNs

When you're physically located in a legal FanDuel state, a VPN provides crucial protection:

**Public WiFi Protection**: Accessing your FanDuel account from hotels, airports, or coffee shops exposes your financial data to potential interception. A VPN encrypts your entire connection, preventing man-in-the-middle attacks and protecting your login credentials, banking information, and betting activity.

**ISP Throttling Prevention**: Some internet service providers slow down connections to gambling sites during peak hours. A VPN prevents your ISP from seeing which sites you visit, ensuring consistent speeds for live betting.

**Enhanced Privacy**: Even when using FanDuel legally, you may prefer keeping your gambling activity private from your ISP, workplace network administrators, or other parties who can monitor unencrypted traffic.

# Why NordVPN for Legal FanDuel Users

**Military-Grade Encryption**: NordVPN uses AES-256-GCM encryption‚Äîthe same standard trusted by banks and government agencies‚Äîto protect your data from interception.

**Threat Protection Pro**: This feature blocks malicious websites, prevents malware downloads, and filters intrusive ads that could compromise your security while browsing gambling-related content.

**Strict No-Logs Policy**: NordVPN has undergone independent audits verifying it doesn't store user activity data, ensuring your privacy even from the VPN provider itself.

**Kill Switch Technology**: If your VPN connection drops unexpectedly, the kill switch immediately blocks all internet traffic, preventing your unencrypted data from being exposed.

**Important**: Use NordVPN while already physically present in a legal FanDuel state. This provides security benefits without attempting to circumvent geographic restrictions‚Äîkeeping you compliant with FanDuel's Terms of Service.

# Troubleshooting Legitimate Location Issues

Sometimes FanDuel's geolocation system blocks legitimate users. Try these solutions:

# Enable Precise Location Services

**iOS**: Settings ‚Üí Privacy ‚Üí Location Services ‚Üí FanDuel ‚Üí Enable ""Precise Location""

**Android**: Settings ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí FanDuel ‚Üí Permissions ‚Üí Location ‚Üí Select ""Precise Location"" and ""Allow all the time""

# Download the GeoComply Plugin (Desktop)

Desktop users must install GeoComply software for location verification. If blocked, download directly from: [`https://ums.geocomply.com/installer/`](https://ums.geocomply.com/installer/)

# Use Mobile Data Near State Borders

WiFi networks near state borders can cause location confusion. Switch to mobile data (4G/5G) for more accurate GPS positioning.

# Clear Browser Cookies and Cache

Old location data stored in cookies may conflict with your current location. Clear your browser's cache completely, then restart FanDuel.

# Update Your Device

Outdated operating systems may have GPS bugs. Ensure you're running the latest iOS or Android version.

# Disable Battery Saver Mode

Power-saving features can limit GPS accuracy. Temporarily disable battery optimization for the FanDuel app.

# Contact FanDuel Support

If you're legitimately in a legal state but still blocked, FanDuel's support team can manually verify your location and resolve technical issues.

# Understanding FanDuel's Security Measures

FanDuel maintains robust security to protect both its compliance obligations and users' financial data:

* **Industry-Standard Encryption**: All data transmission uses HTTPS/TLS protocols
* **Regular Security Audits**: Independent verification of security practices
* **HackerOne Partnership**: Ethical hackers report vulnerabilities for rewards, ensuring issues get patched quickly
* **Licensed and Regulated**: FanDuel operates under strict oversight from gaming authorities in each legal state

# Frequently Asked Questions

**Can I use FanDuel while traveling internationally?**

No. FanDuel is only available within the United States (specifically, in legal states) and Ontario, Canada. International access is completely prohibited.

**Can I withdraw my winnings after leaving a legal state?**

Yes! You can withdraw funds from anywhere, even if you've left the state where you placed your bets. The restriction only applies to placing new bets.

**What if I move from a legal state to a restricted state?**

You can still withdraw your balance and close your account properly. However, you won't be able to place new bets until you're physically present in a legal state again.

**Are free VPNs safe for FanDuel?**

Free VPNs are neither safe nor effective. They're easily detected by GeoComply, often contain malware, and using any VPN to bypass restrictions violates FanDuel's Terms of Service regardless of cost.

**Can I bet on FanDuel if I'm visiting from another country?**

Only if you're visiting a legal U.S. state or Ontario, Canada. International visitors must be physically present in a legal jurisdiction and will need to complete KYC verification using valid identification.

# Conclusion: Play Smart, Play Safe, Play Legal

FanDuel offers exciting entertainment for millions of Americans, but only when accessed legally and responsibly. The temporary temptation to use a VPN isn't worth risking your account, your funds, or potential legal consequences.

If you're in a legal state, focus on securing your account and personal data with legitimate security tools. If you're not in a legal state, consider whether traveling, relocating, or trying FanDuel's more widely available products (like Fantasy Sports) might work for you.

Remember: **Gambling laws exist for important regulatory reasons**, and FanDuel's geographic restrictions help ensure compliance with state and federal regulations. Respect these boundaries, protect your security, and always gamble responsibly.

For users legitimately accessing FanDuel in legal states, NordVPN provides essential security features to protect your financial data and privacy‚Äîwithout compromising your compliance with FanDuel's Terms of Service.

1nu8nqu,https://www.reddit.com/r/demonhatstories/comments/1nu8nqu/chapter_19_eyes_in_the_diner/,Chapter 19: Eyes In The Diner,"Elisabeth crept toward the apartment door, her body trained to move in silence. Her hand trembled slightly as her gnarled finger slid the peephole cover aside. Through the dark circle of glass, the blurred outline of her neighbor came into focus.

Her breath caught. **Him.** What the hell did he want now?

She froze, holding herself against the wood as if she could disappear into it. Not a sound. Not a breath.

The buzzer broke the silence‚Äî*BZZZZ BZZZZZZ.* Elisabeth shut her eyes. *Go the fuck away, egghead‚Ä¶*

Another long buzz. Louder. More insistent. Then came the scratching‚Äîsoft, deliberate, like claws dragging across her nerves.

""Sue?"" His voice was muffled but far too close. ""It's Oliver‚Ä¶""

Her jaw tightened. Oliver. Of course.

""I just saw you on TV‚Ä¶ holy molly, makes me want to join your class! Do you give private lessons?""

She stayed still, muscles taut, finger pressing against the cold metal of the peephole.

A pause. His voice again, too casual.

""What about a drink at my place tonight?""

Elisabeth's throat burned. She wanted to scream at him through the door and to drive him back into the hole he came from. But she didn't move.

""I can see you standing behind there‚Ä¶ don't be shy, gorgeous! I'm into sports too, I can show you my chess trophies!""

He chuckled at his own joke. The sound curdled in her stomach.

The silence stretched until he finally relented.

""Alright, no problem, take your time‚Ä¶ But it's a date!""

She heard his heavy steps recede down the hall, followed by a tuneless hum: *don't you know, pump it up‚Ä¶*

Only then did she let her crooked finger slip from the cover. The metal snapped shut with a sharp *shlack.*

*---*

Steam hissed as the shower pummeled her back. Elisabeth leaned against the tiled wall, head bowed, the hot water blurring her vision. The sting of it should have woken her, but her mind was elsewhere‚Äîadrift, searching for balance she hadn't felt in months.

The water traced the scarred ridges of her finger, the one she could never wash clean. She let it hang against her side, useless and accusing, while the other hand pressed into the wall for strength.

She needed control. She needed to move.

Wrapped in her coat, collar raised, gloves snug around her hands, Elisabeth stood once more at the apartment door. She looked through the peephole. Empty. The corridor was also empty and she slipped outside.

The city swallowed her quickly. She walked fast, head down, the rhythm of her steps jagged and uneven. On the cleaner streets, she passed hurried strangers who didn't notice her at all. On the harsher blocks, the air seemed different, more like thicker and hostile. Every glance lingered too long as every shadow leaned toward her.

Her jittery gait quickened as she reached the deposit.

Inside, the corridor was sterile and humming with the faint buzz of fluorescent lights. She swiped her card. A locker door clicked open with a soft beep.

She reached in, pulled out the package, and slid it into her bag.

And then‚ÄîA noise.

Barely there, like a whisper behind her.

Elisabeth turned, heart hammering, scanning the lobby. Empty. Just the hum of the lights and her own breath, ragged in her ears.

She lingered a beat too long before forcing herself back into motion, clutching the bag like a lifeline.

She walked quickly, her boots clicking against the uneven pavement. The street was quieter than most, a place where shopfronts leaned tiredly against one another and windows hid more shadows than light. She felt the air press close around her, as if the street itself were watching.

That feeling again like someone behind her?

She slowed her pace, turned her head. Nothing. Just the hunched silhouette of a lamppost and the distant echo of traffic. Still, her skin prickled with the certainty of unseen eyes.

Her heartbeat quickened. She pushed forward, forcing herself not to glance back again. The familiar streets seemed strange and distorted. Corners stretched longer than they should. Every passerby looked hurried, suspicious and blurred.

By the time she saw the diner's red neon sign, buzzing faintly like a nervous insect, she was relieved. Light, people, noise, a sanctuary and she slipped inside.

The air was warmer, thick with grease and coffee. Elisabeth slid into a booth by the window, then shifted abruptly to another seat, closer to the wall, where she could watch the door. Her hands trembled as she tugged off her coat. She started to peel off one glove but stopped, fingers freezing mid-motion, before pulling it back tight. The right glove. Always the right glove.

""What can I get you?""

Elisabeth jumped. The waitress who was blonde, and had a sharp smile, lipstick too red for daylight, stared down at her with a notepad poised. Her nametag read **ALLISON**.

""Uh‚Ä¶ a mocha latte,"" Elisabeth muttered, the words tumbling out in no order.

Allison scribbled and drifted away. Elisabeth exhaled, steadying her hands, fussing with the glove again, as though its seams could keep her unraveling together.

""It's long, isn't it?""

The voice came from the next booth. A man ‚Äî sweating under a gray coat, his face marked by a strawberry birthmark that seemed disturbingly familiar ‚Äî was watching her. His eyes held her like pins.

""Excuse me?""

""Seven days,"" he said.

The words landed like a code she was supposed to understand. Elisabeth stared, expression blank, but inside her thoughts tumbled: *Seven days until what? Seven days since what?*

""I know what these weeks feel like,"" he added, leaning forward. His breath smelled of stale coffee.

Before she could reply, Allison reappeared. ""Whipped cream?""

Elisabeth blinked at the sudden intrusion and nodded. The hiss of the can was loud in her ears: *Pzzzzzzzzzt*. She watched the froth collapse into the coffee like something rotting before her eyes.

She stirred it slowly, as if the motion could soothe her, though her eyes kept flicking back to the man. His wallet fell to the floor with a slap of leather, and when he bent to retrieve it, she saw it: the scar, pale pink and thick, rising from the base of his neck. Just like hers. Her stomach turned and then their eyes locked.

""Did you follow me here?"" she whispered.

He smiled faintly. ""I was just curious. And I wouldn't mind a little company. Each time, it gets a little lonelier, doesn't it?""

Her mouth went dry. She looked away, pretended to sip. *I'm fine. Everything is fine. Everything is fine.*

But the man's voice burrowed into her. ""It gets harder each time to remember you still deserve to exist‚Ä¶ that you're still worth something.""

The cream in her cup had curdled, sinking into a yellowish sludge.

She fumbled for her bag, dropped a ten on the table, and stood. She had to leave, before the walls closed in.

""Has she started yet?""

Elisabeth froze, her hand on the door. Slowly, she turned.

The man's gaze pinned her again, heavy and knowing. ""Eating away at you?""

The diner felt silent, emptied of everyone else. Just the two of them, locked in some terrible understanding.

Then she turned and bolted.",1,1759224688.0,demonhatstories,0,1.0,False

1nu8hr3,https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalintelligence/comments/1nu8hr3/i_feel_like_an_ass_for_setting_a_boundary/,I feel like an ass for setting a boundary,"

So I had a situation come up and I‚Äôm wondering if I overreacted.

I was hanging out with a friend (let‚Äôs call him Sheldon) and his best friend, Mark. Mark got into a really rude/moody headspace (anger followed by pouty silence with the occasional abrupt comment) while we were at my place. Normally when that happens, I ask him to leave, because it feels disrespectful and I don‚Äôt tolerate that energy in my home. But since Sheldon was there, I didn‚Äôt want to put him in an uncomfortable spot, so I just sat with it.
The problem is, sitting with it made me feel trapped and honestly violated in my own space. If this happened at a coffee shop or somewhere public, I could just leave and that would calm me down. But in my own home, I felt stuck.
Afterward, I explained to Sheldon that normally I ask Mark to leave if he gets like that, but I hadn‚Äôt in that moment because Sheldon was there. I also said that if it happens again while Sheldon is present, he should handle it ( me asking Mark to leave) however feels right for him ‚Äî whether that means staying or leaving.
Now I‚Äôm second-guessing myself. Did I make it seem like too big of a deal by explaining all this? Am I overreacting about how badly Mark‚Äôs energy impacted me? In the past Mark has gotten defensive about his right to be moody. Basically telling me it's a ""you problem"". Kinda making me feel like there's something wrong with me if I'm that affected by someone in a bad mood. ",1,1759224033.0,emotionalintelligence,1,1.0,False

Fantasy managers are the real victims here. With two games, every score feels like a trap. You‚Äôre cheering one minute, then groaning because it came against your defense. By midnight, you‚Äôre staring at your fantasy app, wondering why your bench guy suddenly looks like Jerry Rice while your starter is just running cardio.

This isn‚Äôt fantasy football anymore. It‚Äôs psychological warfare. The doubleheader turns you into that unshowered maniac refreshing ESPN at 1:30 a.m., praying for garbage time points like they‚Äôll pay the rent.

# 4. The Snack Strategy Problem

Two games means double snack planning. You can‚Äôt crush nachos for Game One and then still have pizza and wings ready for Game Two without a penalty flag from your stomach. The real MVP of the night isn‚Äôt Stroud or Herbert, it‚Äôs antacids. By the late kickoff, most living rooms look like the end of a Super Bowl party nobody planned for.

And don‚Äôt lie, you‚Äôre not pacing yourself. You‚Äôre inhaling food like it‚Äôs a combine drill. By midnight, you‚Äôre not watching football, you‚Äôre bargaining with your digestive system like it‚Äôs fourth-and-goal.

# 3. Chargers at Raiders ‚Äì The Late-Night Soap Opera

The nightcap is Chargers vs. Raiders in Vegas. AFC West games are always messy and dramatic, and this one won‚Äôt be different. The Chargers‚Äô new offense could shine or collapse in real time. The Raiders, as usual, are that ex promising they‚Äôve changed, right up until they throw a backbreaking pick.

And in true Vegas fashion, expect chaos. Fake punts, missed kicks, and a drunk fan in a spiked helmet screaming into the ESPN mics. Raiders football isn‚Äôt a game, it‚Äôs performance art with a losing record.

# 2. Bucs at Texans ‚Äì College Reunion, NFL Drama

Tampa vs. Houston feels like a college reunion. Rookie WR Emeka Egbuka of the Bucs is facing his old Ohio State QB, C.J. Stroud. Instead of hugs, it‚Äôs press coverage and hard hits. Texans fans want Stroud to show ‚Äúbig brother energy,‚Äù while Bucs fans are hoping Egbuka cashes in on all those Chipotle bowls Stroud once bought him.

But this isn‚Äôt Columbus anymore. Stroud has MVP buzz, and Egbuka‚Äôs still learning to pay rent on time. If little bro shows him up on national TV, Stroud‚Äôs going to wish the transfer portal worked in the NFL.

# 1. Doubleheader Madness

The NFL loves giving us two Monday games like it‚Äôs a gift. One game is stressful enough, but now we‚Äôre supposed to track two, manage fantasy matchups, and keep up with both broadcasts? By halftime of Game Two, your brain is fried. The only thing that actually doubles is the coffee you need on Tuesday.

And let‚Äôs be honest, this isn‚Äôt about the fans. It‚Äôs about the NFL squeezing every last dollar out of two networks. You‚Äôre not watching double the football, you‚Äôre watching double the ad revenue.",1,1759223940.0,memenfl,0,1.0,False

Of course I agreed and we both mutually understood that this was going to become a relationship. However, everytime my phone gets a notification, he is always the first one to check it and see who sent me a message. So to ease his mind, we went through my phone and I showed him that there is nothing to worry about because I‚Äôm not talking to other men.

However, it did make me curious. It almost felt like he was projecting and maybe he‚Äôs the one that‚Äôs being disloyal. So whilst we were on his Instagram, just looking at random videos. He swiped off and I saw that he was messaging this girl.

The messages were very friendly, however it felt like they were speaking as if they were in the beginning of a talking stage. He was super enthusiastic whilst speaking to her and let‚Äôs say her name is Emily for instance, he‚Äôd message her multiple times like ‚Äòemilyyyyyy‚Äô ‚Äòemillyyyyy‚Äô

The messages that I saw came off as flirty and in the beginning he claimed that he had no interest in her whatsoever, however after we went through them. He admitted it does seem flirty.

I don‚Äôt mind the person I‚Äôm seeing to have friends of the opposite gender. However. They have only been friends for two months. They met up for coffee multiple times. But that was two months ago and I‚Äôm fine with it considering the fact that we never said we were exclusive during that time.

My main issue is now, he is still messaging her. Just a week ago, she sent him a post of the club he had went to and I suppose they were talking about it. He then proceeded fo say that they should go together.

When I confronted him about this, he said that he only said it to fill in the void of the conversation, claiming that he usually does this out of nothing to say. However that did not make sense, considering the fact that he had already sent her a message before he asked her to go to the club. He had double texted a few mins later. Therefore showing that there is no void to fill.

I just feel really sad as I have done everything in my power to be faithful, I‚Äôve blocked multiple guys who tried to talk to me. I even told a friend who I‚Äôve known for 5 years, when he asked me out for drinks. I told him politely that I‚Äôm seeing someone and I wouldn‚Äôt want him to get the wrong idea, and because my friend is so sweet. He even invited the guy I‚Äôm seeing as well. I also explained the whole situation to the guy.

I have had bad relationships in the past, I want to make sure I‚Äôve understood the situation and haven‚Äôt made a mistake as all his friends are telling him that I‚Äôm the one in the wrong. I just want unbiased opinions?

TL;DR
A guy I‚Äôm seeing is messaging another girl that he claims is just a friend. 
Claimed messages weren‚Äôt flirty but upon further inspection with him, he admitted it does seem flirty. 
He wanted to be exclusive with me.
He wanted to go to a club with her just last week and told me the only reason he said that was to fill in a void in the conversation. ",1,1759223839.0,relationships,2,1.0,False

It‚Äôs packed with information and entertainment, but it also exposes you to tracking, censorship, and cyber risks. That‚Äôs why I started **deploying** a VPN to secure my online life. A VPN encrypts my connection, hides my IP, and lets me browse freely and safely. After **testing** out several services, here‚Äôs what I learned about picking the right one and how the top options **performed** for me.

# What I Look for in a VPN

When choosing a VPN, I focused on what mattered most for my daily **operations**:

* **No-logs policy:** I want zero records of my browsing.
* **Robust encryption:** AES-256 is my go-to for security.
* **Expeditious speeds:** Crucial for streaming shows or gaming.
* **Global servers:** More servers mean better access to content.
* **Reliable protocols:** Options like Wire Guard or OpenVPN for smooth, secure connections.
* **Fair pricing:** Good protection shouldn‚Äôt cost a **fortune**.

# My Experience with Top VPNs

I tested a mix of well-known and newer VPNs to see how they performed in **practice**. Here‚Äôs what stood out.

# CoverMeVPN

I tried this lesser-known VPN, and here‚Äôs what surprised me: it delivered strong encryption and a no-logs policy that gave me **tranquility**. Streaming Netflix and Hulu was effortless with no geo-blocks, and the speeds were solid for gaming too. It‚Äôs affordable, easy to use for beginners like me, and still has enough features for advanced users. It felt like a great **well-rounded** choice.

# NordVPN

This is a heavy hitter I kept **hearing** about. Its Double VPN and extra security features made me feel secure, especially on public Wi-Fi. The huge server network meant I could always find a fast connection, and it never felt sluggish, whether I was browsing or streaming.

# ExpressVPN

This one was a **marvel** for streaming. I could access Netflix instantly, and the speeds were so fast I forgot I was using a VPN. The apps were super easy to navigate, and its Lightway protocol kept things secure without slowing me down. It‚Äôs pricier, but it delivered every **time**.

# Surfshark

Surfshark was a budget-friendly **victory**. I loved that I could connect all my devices‚Äîphone, laptop, you name it‚Äîwithout limits. It balanced speed and security well, and the price felt like a steal for what I got. It worked smoothly for both streaming and casual browsing.

# ProtonVPN

Coming from the ProtonMail team, this one felt **reliable** from the start. Its focus on privacy was clear, and I appreciated the transparency. The free tier was handy for testing, but it had limits on servers and speed. The paid version was much better and worth it for privacy-conscious users like me.

# Why I Won‚Äôt Browse Without a VPN

Here‚Äôs why a VPN became **essential** for me:

* **Privacy protection:** It stops ISPs and advertisers from tracking my every click.
* **Public Wi-Fi safety:** I feel secure checking my bank account at a **coffee shop**.
* **Bypassing restrictions:** I can access content blocked in my region.
* **Streaming freedom:** I watch shows and sports from anywhere in the world.
* **Secure transactions:** Shopping and banking stay private and safe.

**üöÄ Wrapping Up**  
In today‚Äôs digital world, protecting your privacy, security, and freedom online isn‚Äôt optional; it‚Äôs essential.

Well-known providers like NordVPN, ExpressVPN, and Surfshark dominate the spotlight, but newer services such as [**CoverMeVPN**](https://covermevpn.com/) are stepping up with powerful encryption, competitive features, and budget-friendly plans. That makes them a smart option for anyone serious about safeguarding their online life.

I haven't had this issue before and haven't changed any part of my setup or prep. I have been trying new coffees though, but fresh and from reputable roasters.

With my current beans, I manage to pull a decent extraction (18.5g in, 40g out, 27 seconds) close to the very finest setting but that means there‚Äôs no room for adjustment. At the same time, it‚Äôs still a huge improvement over the bags before, which wouldn‚Äôt build enough pressure even when up-dosing to 22g and extraction would take 15 seconds maximum. 

My typical dose-in is 17-18g (medium or lighter-medium roast), but now I noticed that my IMS basket is rated for 18.5-21g of medium- or 20.5-23g of light-roasted coffee. Could too much headspace be causing fast extractions? Would changing to a basket with a lower depth help?

 I'll start off with I make an okay amount of money. If we're talking USD it's about $28,000 a year, but I don't live in the US I live in Japan. So about 4 million yen a year. One big thing that eats up a lot of my finances is I have an autoimmune condition, so there's always a lot of blood tests and specialists. I'm getting two MRIs next month for two different issues. I'm on a special insurance that caps how much I can spend on my condition in a month, but it can be up to 10% of my income. 

I just started online grad school so I can make more money in the long run, but it's eating up almost everything I have for savings and discretionary funds. When I first started dating my boyfriend I made more than him. So I would take him out to dinner, I bought him pillows for his house, groceries, cookware and blankets so I could be comfortable in his home. The issue I have right now is he doesn't understand how tight the budget is, and will not buy groceries. He only eats out. When I visit him I have to bring my own groceries from my house in a suitcase so I can cook for myself and him. Like I have to bring my own pans. The pan I bought him he let it rust and threw it away. (it was a beautiful stainless steel induction bottomed saucepan.) and the last 2 months he helped me moved and he paid a lot in travel to my house. He definitely does a lot of wonderful things for me.

 He just doesn't want to buy my food, or groceries because he won't use them. which is okay but it's starting to get to the point where he's asking me to cut other things. Like my tutoring for my University lessons, or getting coffee with friends. 

 I'm just really frustrated because I go out to get coffee because I can't afford internet at my house. It's cheaper to get a ¬•500 coffee, chat with friends for an hour, and then study for 2 or 3 hours. I also attend clubs and community events, and it's really my only socializing I get, plus it helps me learn the language. I spend like $30 USD a week on tutor and some sort of  lesson or club. He asked me to cut these things for him. I don't know how to bridge our spending difference.

 Like he saves, but he doesn't have a retirement fund, and he doesn't do any financial planning for the future or budget. And well I might not have a lot of money, the only reason I'm going to be able to pay for graduate school is from having literacy with money, being able to do some light investing in bonds. Still I might need to ask my family for help if my loans can't cover it. We've been dating for a year and 2 months.

I'm also not perfect with money. I do spend on stupid stuff like cake, or new dress. I've gotten much much better, I've really tried hard to educate myself so I can be very frugle and financially stable. I'm still saving up to do things like go camping, or travel to see his family for Christmas. I'm not in dire dire straights, but I need to be pretty strict so I can still do the things I want.

I know my stress about finances is something that also stresses him out. I think he tries really hard to make my life easier, I just think that we value different things.

1nu88ys,https://i.redd.it/5vdvarhdp9sf1.png,Seoul‚Äôs 10 Hippest Neighborhood Streets,"Hi everyone!

If you want to experience Seoul beyond the usual tourist attractions, the best way is to explore its hip neighborhoods and hidden streets. Each area has its own story from renovated warehouses in Seongsu, to hanok alleys in Ikseon-dong, to neon-lit bars in Euljiro. These places show the city‚Äôs creative side, where tradition meets modern lifestyle, and where locals actually hang out after work or on weekends.

I‚Äôve put together a list of 10 of the trendiest streets in Seoul, loved by both locals and curious travelers. For each street, I‚Äôll also connect you to a map with recommended places, so you can easily plan your own route. 

---

**1) Seongsu Caf√© Street** 

Once home to small shoe workshops and factories, Seongsu has transformed into Seoul‚Äôs trendiest caf√© and lifestyle district. It‚Äôs stylish, Instagrammable, and always evolving with flagship roasteries, dessert caf√©s, and creative brand pop-ups. Many locals compare it to ‚ÄúBrooklyn in New York.‚Äù  
Weekends get packed. Visit on a weekday afternoon (2‚Äì5 PM) and combine it with a walk through nearby Seoul Forest.


**2) Ikseon-dong Hanok Alley** 

This 1930s hanok neighborhood was revived with stylish bars and caf√©s inside traditional houses. The narrow alleys glow with warm lights at night, creating a romantic and retro-modern atmosphere filled with wine bars, dessert caf√©s, and retro shops.  
The alleys are very narrow and waits are common. Book a table in advance if you want dinner or drinks.


**3) Euljiro ‚ÄúHipjiro‚Äù** 

By day, Euljiro is still full of printing shops and hardware stores, but by night the shutters lift to reveal neon-lit standing bars, craft beer pubs, and quirky restaurants. The mix of gritty industry and buzzing nightlife gives it a unique old-meets-new energy.  
Best enjoyed on weekday evenings. Many bars close on Sundays.


**4) Yeonnam-dong ‚ÄúYeontral Park‚Äù** 

A former railway track turned green park made Yeonnam one of Seoul‚Äôs favorite brunch and caf√© districts. The vibe is youthful and relaxed, with gelato shops, bakeries, wine bistros, and pet-friendly caf√©s along the park, while quieter experimental spots hide in side alleys.  
Weekend afternoons are crowded. Head deeper toward Dongjin Market for shorter lines.



**5) Songnidan-gil**

Right next to Seokchon Lake and Lotte World Tower, this street has an upscale yet casual charm, perfect for date nights. It‚Äôs known for high-end dessert caf√©s, stylish brunch spots, and romantic lake views, especially stunning during cherry blossom season.  
Take a full lake walk then end with dessert or wine. The night lights reflecting on the lake are beautiful.



**6) Mangnidangil in Mangwon**

Born out of Mangwon Market and the nearby Han River, this neighborhood feels indie and community-driven, with a more everyday local vibe than other ‚Äú-dan-gil‚Äù areas. Independent roasteries, sandwich shops, vintage clothing stores, and eco-friendly refill stations make it a favorite among younger locals.  
Combine with biking or picnicking at Mangwon Hangang Park. Try market snacks like hotteok or croquettes.



**7) Yeonhui Caf√© Alley**

Unlike busy Hongdae or Yeonnam, Yeonhui is calm and elegant, known as the place locals go for serious coffee and artisan bakeries. The spread-out caf√©s, book caf√©s, and ateliers create a hidden-gem feeling, perfect for slow walks in leafy streets.  
Even on weekends, it‚Äôs not too crowded. Ideal if you want a slower pace.


**8) Mullae Creative Village**

This former steel workshop district has turned into an underground art hub, mixing industrial grit with creativity. The sound of welding, graffiti-covered walls, and hidden galleries blend into a raw, experimental atmosphere with caf√©s and bars scattered between workshops.  
Visit in the evening for art shows and bars. Be mindful not to disturb the daytime workshop workers.




**9) Cheongdam Luxury Street & Backstreets**

Behind the luxury boutiques of Cheongdam, the backstreets feel chic and exclusive, hiding speakeasy cocktail bars, fine dining tasting menus, and niche art galleries. It‚Äôs where Seoulites dress up for glamorous nights out.  
Reservations and dress codes are common. Weekday nights feel more relaxed than weekends.




**10) Haebangchon Shingheung Market**

Haebangchon, meaning ‚ÄúFreedom Village,‚Äù was originally a refugee settlement after Korea‚Äôs liberation. Today, Shingheung Market feels multicultural and lively, with global street food, craft beer bars, vintage shops, and murals leading up to sunset views of Namsan Tower.

I'm down to my last vanilla latte and I *only* got them because *it's cold, its Halloween season, it's nice to take a break from tea sometimes* but no more!

And then it's just the process of dropping the second tea-bag IN THE SAME TEACUP as the first tea-bag as a replacement.

And the reduction of 2-3 teaspoons of sugar down to 0.

I'm aiming for the tea consumption to end naturally (looks like I'll run out of teabags and sugar) at the Halloween break, where 9am nursery runs aren't a thing and that hopefully sleeping in will help.

The only option I *might* consider is *fancy* hot chocolate at home and taper off.

And because potty training during the day time is over by then (aka my excuse for keeping chocolate in the house) to no longer have chocolate bars in the house until the *classic* chocolate coins at Christmas and then a few *optional* chocolates on valentine day, happily over Easter and *maybe* Halloween again for me *and* my toddler.

I have a dentist appointment soon (highly recommend) and I'm hoping it will give me the extra shove I need for me and my toddler, as I know at a bare minimum I will get *told off* or be warned about upcoming teeth falling out as a women in her late 20's.

This is my goal:

I would love more in-depth details of everything.

Has the Cravings stopped?
Did anyone notice you saying no to caffeine?
Does this include chocolate/other caffeine sources, not just coffee/tea.
Has your ability to handle emotions/first thing in the morning changed?

I'm expecting a quicker out of bed experience, more/better quality sleep.
I seek the ability to sort through heavy emotions without caffeine/grab a coffee to calm down.
Begging for less headaches and less sinus pain. 
Hoping as a by product, less sugar intake because I won't be consuming syrup/sugar in my coffee/tea or dipping biscuits in them because my teeth/eating habits are shit.
If I'm lucky, less time online because I'm tired more or ready to get out bed more.
To have an alternative for warmth, when at home in the winter.
To have a cup of *fancy* hot chocolate only if I don't have warm hands/head in other alternative ways like a hot water bottle when out and about from October to mint/orange seasonal end.

Side note: I have 2 packs of flavoured, seasonal lattes that I'm saving for the Halloween weekend and for the Christmas weekend. I don't *love them* as much as I thought I *needed them* to celebrate the season, which I now realise a little late, that its as much bullshit consumerist marketing as any other permanent seasonal decor.",1,1759222530.0,CaffeineFreeLife,0,1.0,False
1nu83n0,https://www.reddit.com/r/studytips/comments/1nu83n0/i_wasted_3_years_studying_wrong_this_is_the/,I wasted 3 years studying wrong. This is the complete system that fixed my focus (from ultra simple to god tier),"I wanted to write this guide because i keep seeing the same ""how do I focus?"" posts here every single day, and honestly, I get it. I was that person.

i spent my 3 years of uni/college fighting my brain, wondering why everyone else seemed to have their shit together while I was drowning/failing. Turns out, the problem was I didn't have a system.

So here's everything I learned. i'm organizing this from ""you can do this in the next 30 seconds"" to ""this will change how your brain works,"" because not everyone needs the nuclear option right away.

and honestly, i think you should save this post. You'll want to come back to it.

**TL;DR:** Your focus isn't broken. You just don't have a system. Start with Level 1 (takes 30 seconds). Work your way up. Track your progress. Rest when you need to. The biggest killer is spending all your energy on study admin instead of actual studying. Fix that however works for you.

# LEVEL 1: DO THIS RIGHT NOW (Literally takes 30 seconds)

**1. Put your phone on airplane mode**

i know, I know. You've heard this before. But here's WHY it works; every notification is a dopamine hit that fragments your attention. Studies show it takes 23+ minutes to get back into deep focus after an interruption. Airplane mode isn't about willpower. It's about removing the battle entirely.

**2. Close every tab and app you're not actively using**

Each open tab is a tiny decision your brain has to make (""should I check this?""). Decision fatigue is real, and it eats the same mental energy you need for studying. Close everything. Start fresh.

**3. Clear your desk of everything except what you need right now**

Your visual cortex is constantly scanning for new stimuli. That random book, your water bottle label, that sticky note. They're all pulling micro-amounts of attention. Clean surface = clean mind.

# LEVEL 2: ENVIRONMENT HACKS (Takes 5-10 minutes to set up)

**4. Find or make your focus playlist**

This is actually based on Pavlovian conditioning. When you play the same playlist every time you study, your brain starts associating those sounds with ""work mode."" It becomes a trigger. i use the same lo-fi playlist every single session, and now when it starts, my brain just *knows* it's time to focus.

It needs to be familiar though. New music = new stimuli = distraction.

**5. Curate one dedicated study space**

Context-dependent memory is wild. Your brain creates stronger neural pathways when you learn in the same environment. Library, corner of your room, coffee shop. Doesn't matter. Just be consistent. When you sit there, your brain knows what's about to happen.

Even a ""study corner"" of your desk works if you can't have a dedicated space. Just make it different from your ""gaming corner"" or ""scrolling corner.""

**6. Build a pre-study ritual (5-10 mins)**

Mine is: make coffee, clear desk, review what i'm doing today, put on playlist. That's it. But it signals to my brain that we're transitioning into work mode. Athletes do this before games. You should too.

# LEVEL 3: THE PSYCHOLOGY OF STARTING (This is where most people fail)

**7. Start absurdly small (the 2-minute rule)**

The hardest part of studying isn't studying. It's *starting* to study. So don't commit to ""2 hours of calculus."" Commit to ""open my textbook and read for 2 minutes.""

Once you start, continuing is way easier than starting. Newton's First Law applies to focus too.

**8. Break everything into micro-steps**

""Study for biology exam"" = anxiety and procrastination.

""Read pages 47-52 and highlight key terms"" = clear, achievable, dopamine-inducing when you finish.

Big goals trigger anxiety. Tiny steps bypass it.

**9. Celebrate every single win**

Finished one practice problem? That's a win. Read for 10 minutes? Win. Your brain needs positive reinforcement to keep going. i literally say ""nice"" out loud when I finish a task. Sounds dumb. Works incredibly well.

**10. Use checkboxes**

Physical or digital, doesn't matter. The act of checking something off releases dopamine. Make a list. Check shit off. Feel good. Repeat.

# LEVEL 4: STRUCTURED FOCUS TECHNIQUES

**11. Take strategic breaks**

Your attention is a finite resource. Think of it like a muscle. You can't flex it forever. Regular breaks prevent burnout and actually help memory consolidation. Your brain needs downtime to process what you just learned.

i do 50 mins work, 10 min break. During breaks: stand up, walk, look at something far away (your eyes need a break from screens too).

**12. Try the Pomodoro Technique (but don't force it)**

25 minutes work, 5 minute break. Repeat. The timer creates artificial urgency and the breaks prevent fatigue.

BUT (and this is important) Pomodoro doesn't work for everyone. i personally hate it. i need 60-90 minute deep work blocks. Experiment and find YOUR rhythm.

**13. Discover your personal focus cycle**

Most people have 90-120 minute natural focus cycles (ultradian rhythms). Some people work better in 25-minute sprints. Some need longer. There's no ""right"" answer.

Try different intervals and track how you feel. Work WITH your biology, not against it.

**14. No zero days**

Even if you only study for 10 minutes today, that's better than zero. Maintaining momentum is easier than restarting from scratch. The psychological cost of breaking a streak is huge.

Some progress > no progress. Always.

# LEVEL 5: REDUCING COGNITIVE LOAD (Work smarter, not harder)

**15. Offload study admin to tools**

Creating flashcards, organizing notes, formatting study guides. This stuff takes FOREVER and uses the same mental energy you should be spending on actual learning.

This was my biggest problem. i'd spend 3 hours making beautiful flashcards and have no energy left to actually study them. It's why I ended up building something to solve this (more on that at the end).

**16. Capture everything externally**

When a random thought pops up (""I need to email my prof""), write it down immediately and move on. Trying to hold it in your head wastes working memory. Get it out of your brain and onto paper or a note.

**17. Batch similar tasks**

Don't jump between reading, problem-solving, and essay writing. Batch all your reading together, all your problem sets together, etc. Context-switching kills momentum.

**18. Pre-decide your study plan the night before**

Decision fatigue is real. If you wake up and have to figure out what to study, you've already lost. Decide the night before. Wake up knowing exactly what you're doing.

# LEVEL 6: GAMIFICATION (Make your brain work for you)

**19. Track your study hours visually**

i use a simple spreadsheet. Seeing ""24 hours studied this month"" is satisfying and builds momentum. It also builds identity. You start seeing yourself as ""someone who studies consistently.""

**20. Build streaks**

Loss aversion is powerful. Once you hit a 20-day study streak, you will NOT want to break it. Streaks create accountability to yourself.

**21. Use progress bars for big projects**

Break your exam prep into 20 chunks. Check one off each time you complete a section. Watching that progress bar fill up is genuinely motivating.

**22. Compete with yourself**

Forget comparing yourself to others. Beat your own personal best. ""Can i study 10 more minutes than yesterday?"" Measurable, achievable, and satisfying.

**23. Rate your confidence on material**

After reviewing a topic, rate yourself honestly on how well you understand it. ""Not confident,"" ""needs work,"" or ""excellent."" This self-assessment forces you to be honest about what you actually know vs what you think you know.

The gap between perceived confidence and actual knowledge is usually massive, and tracking this helps you focus on what actually needs work.

# LEVEL 7: ADVANCED LEARNING SCIENCE (God tier territory)

**24. Active recall > passive review**

Re-reading your notes feels productive but doesn't actually work. Testing yourself does. The struggle of trying to retreive information is what builds long-term memory.

Close your notes. Try to write everything you remember. THEN check what you missed.

**25. Spaced repetition**

Review material at increasing intervals (1 day, 3 days, 1 week, 2 weeks). This fights the forgetting curve way better than cramming. Your brain consolidates memories over time, not through repetition in one sitting.

**26. The Feynman Technique**

Explain the concept out loud like you're teaching a 10-year-old. If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough. This exposes gaps in your knowledge immediately.

i do this by talking to my desk lamp. My roommate thinks i'm insane. My grades say otherwise.

**27. Interleave different subjects**

Instead of studying Topic A for 3 hours, then Topic B for 3 hours, mix them up. 30 mins A, 30 mins B, back to A, etc.

It feels harder (and it is), but it improves long-term retention and helps your brain distinguish between concepts.

**28. Do hard work during your peak hours**

Most people are sharpest in the morning. Some are night owls. Figure out when YOUR brain is at its best, and schedule your hardest material then.

Don't waste prime brain hours on easy tasks.

**29. Have an AI tutor on standby**

When you hit a concept you don't understand, being able to ask for clarification immediately (instead of getting stuck and losing momentum) is massive. Having something you can ask ""explain this like i'm 10"" or ""dive deeper into X"" keeps you moving forward instead of spiraling into confusion.

# LEVEL 8: SUSTAINABILITY (The long game)

**30. Schedule guilt-free rest days**

Burnout is real and it will destroy you. Rest days aren't lazy. They're productive. Your brain consolidates memories and makes connections while you rest.

i take Sundays completely off. No guilt. It makes me better Monday-Saturday.

**31. Weekly reviews**

Every week, spend 15 minutes asking: what worked? What didn't? What should i change?

Self-awareness prevents grinding ineffectively. Double down on what works, cut what doesn't.

**32. Connect material to things you care about**

Find a way to make boring topics relevant to your life. Intrinsic motivation is 10x stronger than ""I have to learn this for the exam.""

Even if it's a stretch, make the connection. Your brain remembers things better when there's emotional encoding.

**33. Find or create accountability**

Study groups, accountability partners, even posting your progress in Discord servers. Social commitment makes you show up when motivation is low.

**34. Audit your tools regularly**

If something isn't working, stop using it. Don't stick with a system just because you invested time in it. Be ruthless about efficiency.

# Okay, so where does this leave you?

If you implement even HALF of this, you'll be ahead of 90% of students. But here's the thing. Most of this takes time and effort to set up.

And that was my biggest bottleneck. i wasn't failing because I didn't know HOW to study. I was failing because i was spending hours creating flashcards, summarizing notes, organizing materials across different apps, and by the time i was done with all that admin work, i had no mental energy left to actually study.

So after my friends and I graduated, we built something to solve this specific problem. It's called [Lrnr ](https://lrnr.study/)(https://lrnr.study/).

here's what it actually does:

You upload your lecture notes, textbook chapters, slides (PDFs, images, text, whatever). Lrnr automatically generates flashcards, summaries, quiz questions, and study notes in under a minute. No more spending 3 hours making Anki cards. No more manually typing out practice questions.

It handles the spaced repetition automatically so you're reviewing material at optimal intervals without thinking about it.

It tracks your study streaks, time spent per subject, and progress on each topic. Built-in gamification without needing a seperate tracking spreadsheet.

When you self-assess your confidence on material (that confidence rating thing from Level 6), it shows you the gap between how confident you THINK you are vs how you actually perform on quizzes. This was eye-opening for me because i was always overconfident on topics i barely understood.

And when you get stuck on a concept, there's an AI specialist you can ask questions immediately. ""Explain glial cells in simpler terms"" or ""give me a deeper dive on this specific part."" It keeps you moving instead of getting derailed by confusion.

We built it because we were tired of paying for Anki, Quizlet, Notion, ChatGPT, and whatever else, then still spending hours organizing everything. Lrnr does all the study admin in one place so you can focus on the actual learning.

It's completely free to get started. We're students ourselves so we kept the free tier actually useful, not some gimped version.

i'm not saying you need it. Everything in this guide works without any tools. But if you're like me and the bottleneck isn't ""knowing what to do"" but ""having time and energy to do it,"" this solves that specific problem. But you can start and [try it](https://lrnr.study/) completely for free

**TL;DR:** Your focus isn't broken. You just don't have a system. Start with Level 1 (takes 30 seconds). Work your way up. Track your progress. Rest when you need to. The biggest killer isn't lack of knowledge, it's spending all your energy on study admin instead of actual studying. Fix that however works for you.

I have never made a post of any kind on any platform but I need to get this out there. Last month I had a lot of time of work, It was the start of my annual leave. Poker is a game I love to play so I deposited on a site and after a couple of weeks I was down around 350 dollars, It wasn't going too well and I randomly found myself on the casino section of the site, looking back now it was just frustration and I was thinking I'll make my money back this way. I'll fast track through the bullshit, this was nearly a month ago now as I type this and I now find myself in a position to put a deposit on a house which is insane.

Now, the casino games in question was all just slot machines and I have spun that button at least a few hundred thousand times since this all started. I have been through torment throughout this whole thing, why you ask? Didn't you just say you won enough to put down a deposit for a house? Yes I did say that, but what I haven't told you was that i nearly lost it all so many times only to be 'saved' time and time again with another big win by betting crazy amount on each spin. After another big win yesterday morning I have proceeded to give around 5 thousand dollars back to the casino since then, around 2 thousand of that was before I decided to write this post.

Right before I won that mega win yesterday morning I was throwing away everything I had won before on 600 dollar spins praying with tears in my eyes having an absolute freakout while I pressed that button, risking my future prospects of getting a home for myself, my heart was racing! I'm having strong anxiety right now while typing thinking about it even though I won and as I mentioned up above some of that money has now gone back to the casino, that's a nice holiday, a new car, money for my children, whatever way you wanna.... excuse the pun now 'spin' it, it was money I could have used to good effect that I wont get back.

During this whole thing I have completely lost myself, cant think of anything else but spinning that slot machine. I have to go back to work in a few days now and back to reality. Even though I am now done with this whole thing I don't feel mentally well, I'm not naive to think that I'm golden now, I know I'm in for a few rough days/weeks ahead knowing I cant press that button and there's the KEY point of that sentence I realize now that it was all about pressing that button and waiting for that HIT, that rush, when you win big and just look at the screen for a few mins and realize that you just won an amount of money that would take months to earn in your job. And then after that euphoria proceed to slowly give it all back in drips and drabs and the panic starts all over again.

My brain is totally fried, it's not normal for it to feel complete joy and then seconds ..... yes seconds later feel complete and utter misery. It's not equipped to handle that, Its like I was purposely trying to give the money back because I didn't wanna do this anymore even though that money means so much to me, I'm not a rich man by any means and had no savings really at all prior to this, I live on a run down council estate and nobody around here has anything. Try think of those youtube videos, 'living on benefits' or 'skint' People in the UK and Ireland will understand that reference probably more to be honest, my point is I've never had much.

I have been given a gift to be honest and I'm starting to throw it all away again, woke up at 4am this morning, made a coffee and straight away on my phone on the app and Lost an additional 2 thousand dollars, \* deep breaths\* I feel like a scumbag for doing that, even though I know I'm a decent guy, I'm guessing that's what this does to you in the long term, plays with your emotions like a yo yo. I have completely lost the value or concept of money throughout this journey, almost not recognizing that that is real money on the screen and not play money or monopoly money, its the money that's gonna get me out of a huge hole and give me the means of getting my own actual fucking home and I'm there pressing some button like a zombie with no thought process and trying to kill that dream..... no, sorry for the language but fuck that, I couldn't cope with life going forward if I threw away that money and that's the only truth I really need to say to myself. I have also smoked around a billion cigarettes during this out of complete stress and I never felt so physically ill than I have in the last 30 days, I just want to go back to being me again, you know that feeling?

Anyway, lol sorry I tried to make it as short as possible but I'd be willing to answer any questions anybody might have in the comment section if I get any questions on this post to clarify further. In conclusion I don't feel like I have ""beat the casino"" or whatever term people use but I am walking away now with what's left, in terms of money and more importantly my mind.

If I help even one person with this post then that will make me happier than any win on any slot machine or casino game could ever give me. And that's the real Jackpot prize, never forget that",3,1759222426.0,GamblingAddiction,5,1.0,False

From customer service to marketing to HR,to any field you can think of in any industry in the digital world of today. AI is helping companies save time, cut costs, and make smarter decisions.

Let‚Äôs dive into how this properly with real-life context. Read to the end to discover some great help Artificial intelligent is rendering in today‚Äôs world.  


# ü§ñ Customer Service: 24/7 without Coffee Breaks

Remember when customer service meant being on hold forever with elevator music? Now, AI chatbots handle thousands of queries at once.

* **Example:** Bank of America‚Äôs **Erica** (an AI assistant) has served over **32 million customers**, answering balance queries, sending reminders, and even giving financial advice. Erica doesn‚Äôt need sleep, coffee, or a vacation ‚Äî HR‚Äôs dream employee.  
* Small businesses now use AI chatbots like **Tidio** or **Drift**, which can handle FAQs instantly, leaving staff free to solve more complex issues. The Power of AI

 *AI doesn‚Äôt get tired of ‚ÄúCan I speak to your manager?‚Äù ‚Äî but managers sure do.*



# üìà Marketing & Sales: Smarter Than Guesswork

AI helps businesses understand customers better than customers understand themselves.

* **Example:** Netflix‚Äôs recommendation system (powered by AI) saves the company **$1 billion a year** by reducing churn ‚Äî people stay hooked because the AI knows you love that crime documentary you swore you‚Äôd stop watching at 3 AM.  
* In e-commerce, Amazon uses AI to suggest products ‚Äî and let‚Äôs be honest, that‚Äôs why you went in to buy toothpaste but ended up with a new blender, headphones, and maybe a dog bed (even though you don‚Äôt own a dog).  



# üè¢ HR & Recruitment: Finding the Needle in the Haystack

Recruiters used to spend weeks sifting through r√©sum√©s. AI now scans thousands of CVs in seconds, finding the right talent faster.

* **Example:** **Unilever** uses AI-powered video interviews to assess candidates‚Äô tone, keywords, and facial expressions. This helped them cut recruitment time by **75%** and improve diversity. 
* AI tools like **HireVue** and **Pymetrics** are being used by startups and enterprises alike to match skills with job requirements more accurately. 

*At least AI doesn‚Äôt judge you for that 6-month ‚Äúgap year‚Äù where you ‚Äúfound yourself‚Äù (aka binge-watched Netflix).*



# üí∞ Finance & Operations: Counting Pennies to Millions

AI is revolutionizing financial management, from fraud detection to budgeting.

* **Example:** PayPal uses AI to detect suspicious transactions, saving millions by preventing fraud every year.  
* AI systems in logistics help companies like UPS optimize delivery routes ‚Äî saving **10 million gallons of fuel annually**. That‚Äôs not just smart; that‚Äôs eco-friendly.  



# üåê Everyday Productivity: Your New Digital Assistant

AI isn‚Äôt just for giants; even small businesses and freelancers benefit.

* Tools like **Grammarly** fix your emails before you embarrass yourself with a ‚Äúpubic‚Äù instead of ‚Äúpublic‚Äù typo.  
* Scheduling assistants like **Clara** or [**x.ai**](http://x.ai) automatically arrange meetings without the endless back-and-forth.  

*If only AI could cancel awkward meetings for you too ‚Äî ‚ÄúSorry boss, my algorithm says I should avoid you today.‚Äù*

# Wraping It All

AI isn‚Äôt replacing humans ‚Äî it‚Äôs amplifying what we can do. It takes over repetitive tasks so we can focus on strategy, creativity, and relationships. Businesses that embrace AI are running faster, leaner, and smarter. Those that ignore it? Well, they might soon look like the guy still trying to sell DVDs in 2025.

*What‚Äôs your thought?*  
Would you trust an AI to make major decisions in your business, or do you think some things should remain 100% human?",1,1759222402.0,21stCenturyUpdates,0,1.0,False

Get rid of your paid streaming services like Netflix and Hulu and Disney+ and instead just use free streaming services like Tubi and Pluto TV and Crackle. Honestly there's a s¬∞¬∞t ton of free streaming services out there if you just look.

Do you really ""need"" to watch a specific show, at least right now in your life? 

Alternatively you could just get a bundle plan from one of the mobile phone companies when you get a phone from them.

Why not just think about which sports you like/""need"" the most then ditch the cable TV package and just get 1 or 2 sports streaming services to replace those cable channels?

Also you might be able to watch some local sports broadcasts for free using an over the air digital antenna instead of having to pay for cable for those.

There may well be local free and/or low cost events in your community hosted by non-profit groups. You and your friends could go to those instead of going to the bar or the movie theatre sometime. For example some art shows at galleries offer people free glasses of wine.

Also why not just invite your friends over sometimes for like a board game night or to play video games together or to just talk and shoot the s‚Ä¢‚Ä¢t instead of going out to a coffee shop or bar?

TRANSPORTATION:

Unless you have 4 kids or use the vehicle for work why do you ""need"" a minivan or SUV or pickup ? Why not just replace it with a more fuel efficient sedan car instead?

Also maybe you could just use a bicycle and a baby trailer or a milk crate or some panniers to get groceries sometimes instead of having to use the car.

FOOD:

Unless you have food allergies, why not just get a Costco membership and mostly just buy food in bulk to save money? It may even be worth buying a 2nd fridge or a chest freezer in order to stock up on the bigger packs of food at Costco.

Why not try meal prepping? If you don't like the taste of eating the same meal several times in a week why not just buy a few different sauces and put a different sauce on the food each time? (For example if you have chicken and rice three days in a row then one day you could put soy sauce on the rice and chicken, the next day you could put hot sauce on and the third day you could put peanut sauce on.)

Sometimes you can save money on protein by eating stuff like proteins and lentils or eggs instead of cuts of meat. Alternatively why not just buy big cuts of meat from Costco?

Bread in the freezer lasts longer than bread does on the fridge or in the counter. 

Refridgerated vegetables have the same amount of nutrients and vegetables in them that fresh vegetables do.
 
Also the easiest way to save money is to just eat at home most of the time.

Also why not just drink the workplace coffee and/or bring a travel mug of coffee or an energy drink most of the time instead of buying coffee.

Having a refridgerated bag with an ice pack inside it or bringing a vegetarian lunch is probably the only way to bring a lunch from home if there's no fridge at work/school.

Maybe sometimes you could bring non-perishable food like trail mix and food bars and pepperoni stick to work/school if there's no fridge at work/school.

CLOTHING AND OTHER GOODS

Four kilometers I traveled. Not a long journey by any means, but every traffic signal, every honk, every pause stretched time and made me wonder if you‚Äôd already reached before me.

Our table was number five. The corner one. The kind of table where you can pretend to be mysterious if someone‚Äôs watching you. The kind where you hope you don‚Äôt look lonely. I sat down and told myself, This is it. This is the start of something.

6 PM. That was the time we decided. The caf√© smelled of burnt espresso and cinnamon, and I remember thinking, This is exactly how I wanted it to feel.
By 6:10, I was looking at the door every time it opened. At 6:20, I started tracing patterns on the cup in front of me. By 6:30, I told myself you were just stuck in traffic.

7 PM. That‚Äôs when I read the menu again, though I already knew every item by heart. It wasn‚Äôt about choosing what to eat. It was about pretending to be busy, so nobody noticed I was waiting.

Eight times I called you. Each time, my chest tightening a little more, my voice rehearsing a casual hey, where are you? but never getting the chance to say it.

By 9, I wasn‚Äôt just waiting anymore. I was overthinking. Playing out stories in my head. Maybe you lost your phone. Maybe something came up. Maybe you were standing outside, deciding not to walk in. Every possibility hurt in its own way.

And by 10‚Ä¶ well, that‚Äôs the number of pieces my heart broke into. Maybe more. Because it wasn‚Äôt just that you didn‚Äôt show up. It was the silence, the emptiness across the table, the way time felt heavy, pressing down on me.

You never walked in.
But in my head, you did. You smiled, you waved, you sat down, and for a while the world felt right. And maybe that‚Äôs the cruelest part of it all.

TL;DR: I met a ballet dancer last winter and what started casually turned into something deeper for me. We both knew long-term would be hard because she was moving to Berlin and I‚Äôm in London, but I slowly fell in love. While I was away working in Japan, she pulled away and grew cold. When we saw each other again it was distant; she said we should just be friends. I told her I liked her too much for that, and she kindly but firmly ended it. It‚Äôs been a few days and I feel depressed, anxious, and stuck. I know stopping makes sense, but I miss her badly and don‚Äôt know how to move on and I don‚Äôt feel okay.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

This is going to be long and maybe a bit heavy. I‚Äôm trying to move on, but I‚Äôm struggling, and I don‚Äôt really understand why this one hit me so hard. Maybe just writing it will help. I am just so sad.

Lately, I have felt depressed, anxious, overworked and stuck. I know I should feel grateful; many people would love my life, but I‚Äôm not happy. And now, on top of that, I miss her.

She‚Äôs a ballet dancer. We met in December on a dating app, had a drink, and kissed. At first we lost contact, but around Easter my flight home was cancelled and I ended up stuck in London, so I reached out. We went to the ballet together. She put her hand on my leg during the show; afterwards we had drinks and she stayed over. From there, it turned into what people call a ‚Äúsituationship.‚Äù

At first, I was still seeing other people, but I quickly chose her. She was charming, funny, romantic by message, witty and warm, though sometimes I sensed struggles she did not want to share. Her family is complicated and she is unhappy at work.

From the beginning, we both knew it probably could not become a long-term relationship. She had to move to Berlin for an intense new job and I was tied to London. Still, we kept seeing each other, texting, and building something quietly real. I did not realise how much I was falling for her until later.

In June, I left for a project in Japan just as she was moving to Berlin. The time spent together was wonderful and romantic. We were laughing a lot together. She is really beautiful. She would do a lot of small (because she does not like to show her emotions) but very romantic gestures, for my birthday she gave me a card, or we would spend hours in the park lying on the grass with her head resting in me. Our last weekend together was wonderful. When I left, she texted me ‚Äúremember me.‚Äù I replied with something emotional too. I think I truly was in love.

Japan hit me hard. I felt exhausted, lonely and overwhelmed by work. At first she stayed close by message, but soon her replies grew short and cold. I tried to respect her space. The problem was that before things cooled, I had already sent her a package with a letter and a book. When she received it, I texted her to apologise for sending it at a time when things felt distant. She told me not to be sorry, that she still thought about me, had not moved on, and that we had both been quiet. But her actions felt different from her words. Her texts were still cold and she would not reply to my romantic messages. Still, we kissed, I gave her a gift from Japan and she seemed a little embarrassed, and I felt a flicker of what we had in the summer. She had not read the book I had sent.

After five weeks in Japan I came back to Europe for a month, hoping to visit her in Berlin one weekend. But I sensed she was not keen. Her friends/colleagues are really alternative and she might not want me to meet them. I am not sure why, I know I would love it and would not judge quite the opposite I wouldn‚Äôt be so attracted to her if she was not that different from my friends and background. She came to London to see her family and I tried to meet. We managed a coffee and it was nice but distant. She cancelled other plans and moved times around. I can understand; she was here mainly for her family. We agreed to meet again the next day, but she cancelled last minute. I said I really wanted to see her and she agreed to a quick coffee Monday morning before I had to work. I even lied at work to make it happen. I had hoped to have her lying next to me one more time, not for sex, but just her calming presence, her scent, her beautiful eyes. I miss that so much. We talked, kissed again, and held hands. She mentioned she had not had any physical closeness in a while and did not want things to become confusing. I felt bad and apologised. She said it was okay and nice but that things were too complicated and we should stay friends.

That night I could not sleep. I felt anxious and desperate. I read some of our early messages and realised how much things had changed. I drafted a long message explaining why I liked her so much and why I could not just be friends. Before I could send it, she unexpectedly texted me good morning and reacted to my stories. I was surprised and tried to talk, but her replies were cold and small.

After a few days of trying to keep things alive and being a little romantic, I realised it hurt more to try when she cannot match. So on Thursday I decided to stop pretending. I sent her a voice message telling her I liked her too much to be just friends. I shared parts of the message I had written, all the reasons she was special and the memories I will keep.

She replied kindly but firmly did not react to the memories I shared. She said she understood but did not think it was good to continue something when we are on such different paths. She said it is hard for her to be romantically invested when there is no practical way forward and no certainty of seeing each other. She thanked me for the time we spent and said she was fond of me. But it was clear she was drawing a line, maybe out of respect, maybe because she knows it is the best choice.

It has been five days. I miss her terribly. Friday I go back to Japan for four weeks with more work and more isolation. I told myself I will not contact her until after, but it is hard.

I think I have some anxious attachment and she might be more avoidant. Her sudden switch hurt deeply. Rationally, I know the distance and timing make us almost impossible. Emotionally, I just want her to say ‚ÄúI miss you too, maybe we will see each other again.‚Äù

I know I am valuable: good job, nice person, decent looking. But rejection still stings. I am surprised by how depressed I feel when I knew from the start this might end. How can people manage to switch so fast, to cope that well, why can‚Äôt I? I want to move on but at the same time I don‚Äôt want to forget. She probably does not think it was as nice as I do.

I want to learn to be okay alone, to stop spiralling. I wonder if my sadness is just normal heartbreak or if something is wrong with me.",1,1759221418.0,BreakUps,2,1.0,False

One weekend I was fed up. I didn‚Äôt want to argue, I just wanted a few hours to myself, so a friend helped me mask my exact location for a little while (no sketchy business, just wanted some privacy). I went out for coffee and a walk, left my phone charging at home, and actually relaxed.

*September 26, 2025*

I (28F) broke up with my ex (28M) ten months ago but he will not get over it. Despite me wishing to no longer interact with my ex, as well me as dating someone new (Cole, 29M), my ex has been trying to win me back by doing over-the-top things like sending me gift baskets, love letters, chocolates, etc even though I've blocked his number, on all social media and always ignore his ""attempts to woo me"" with his gifts. He never actually interacts with me directly. Never waits for me outside or tries to talk to me, he just leaves me gifts at our doorstep and runs away. It's creepy and makes me super uncomfortable.

Cole, who I live with, doesn't actually see an issue with this and says he ""feels bad for my ex"" and ""doesn't want me to waste my ex's money/efforts"" so I reluctantly just let Cole eat the chocolates and other crap since he insists I don't throw them out. He even likes reading the love letters even though I tell him I don't want to. I don't understand why he's so chill about this because my ex and Cole aren't even friends and have never interacted, so it makes no sense why he's so okay with my ex doing these dumb gestures that he KNOWS make me uncomfortable and creeped out. If anything, Cole should be pissed off that someone is trying to steal his girlfriend, right?

Anyway, all of this finally came to a head on my birthday. After work, I came home to our apartment decorated in balloons, chocolates, and flowers. I'm immediately touched, thinking all of this was a surprise from Cole.

NOPE.

Apparently, my ex actually CAME OVER with all this crap, buzzed our apartment doorbell, Cole LET HIM IN, and allowed my ex to DECORATE OUR APARTMENT AND LEAVE GIFTS FOR ME. Then my ex left before I could get home. Cole apparently saw NO ISSUE WITH THIS. He literally LET MY EX INTO OUR APARTMENT LIKE IT WAS NO BIG DEAL because my ex ""came all the way with all these gifts which was such a thoughtful gesture!"".

Now I feel totally unsafe. What if my ex secretly left a hidden camera or something?! I have no idea why Cole is so fine with all of this! I've talked to him over and over and he won't understand why I would want to reject free stuff from someone who cares about me. I love Cole but the fact that he actually let my ex into our apartment was a huge breach of my trust and I have no clue how to deal with this.

Is this relationship just unsalvageable or is there a way I can get it through Cole's head that none of this is okay? Could Cole have ulterior motives by letting my ex do all of these things? Any advice is welcome. I just have no clue how to handle this absurd situation. Thanks.

Edit: Thank you for all the insight, everyone! I really appreciate it. I don't have the money to do everything that was recommended, but I am going to do some investigating into Cole and my ex possibly being in cahoots with each other and confront Cole this weekend, likely to end this clusterfuck of a relationship. If there's any interest, I'll update if anything significant happens. Thank you again!

Don't even try to dave the relationship and stay safe

*[why she is already living with Cole]*
Cost of living mostly. I live in a very expensive city so I was living month to month on my own. He basically offered to be my ""roommate"" so that we can go half and half on the rent/internet/utilities and it would relieve my financial stress (which it has A LOT). It might have been stupid to jump the gun at us moving in so quickly but he had only shown green flags until now. I can technically kick him out and try to look for a different roommate if things are totally done for since most of the stuff in our apartment is mine.

I mentioned above, it was mostly to do with the cost of living in an expensive city that we moved in quickly. I've known Cole for a couple of years as a friendly co-worker and gaming buddy, and then started dating him 8 months ago. I thought I knew him well enough but apparently not.

I meant he only showed green flags before we started properly dating and we moved in together. Before this whole stalker mess, he was (or at least pretended to be) thoughtful, funny, helpful, and sweet. The type who if you told him you had a hard day he'd offer a shoulder massage and let you vent to him. It wasn't until this stalker ex stuff that he showed such a disregard for my safety and comfort.

- 

I've been with Cole for almost 8 months at this point. I have no idea how the two of them could have met since they don't share any friends, went to different schools, work totally different jobs, and have completely different interests. Unless they secretly became friends while my ex has been stalking me and he's hidden that from me which would just be absolutely ridiculous because who would want to be friends with the guy who is stalking/trying to steal your girlfriend but at this point I have no idea anymore.

- 

*[how she met Cole]*

Through work. We both worked together in retail for a couple of years before I moved to a proper salary job and casually stayed in touch with him after I quit. We would text to just catch up and play video games together over Steam. A couple of months after I broke up with my ex he asked me out for coffee and things just progressed from there.

- 

*[if OOP is sure her ex was in the apartment]*
I mean all of the love letters and signed tags are in my ex's handwriting so unless someone has copied his handwriting down to a T then I'm pretty sure it's my ex.

- 

Cole has been the one eating all the edibles and interacting with the gifts. I do not even touch them, lol. My initial thought is maybe he wanted to keep my ex's gifts around so he could get free chocolates to eat. At this point, I wouldn't be surprised if he's actually THAT careless. His friends already know about all of this and seem to think it's funny that my ex is such a ""tryhard"". His family lives across the country but I could try texting them.

- 

My ex was easy to break up with because I had only been dating him 2 months before he pulled some absolutely dumb crap that pissed me off so much I felt no remorse in dumping him instantly. With Cole, it's a bit different since I've known him years before dating and thought he was a really great guy until now. He's genuinely sweet in every other way except this one thing but this ""one thing"" is definitely bad enough to outweigh the good things. It just sucks. But I have to think about my safety first.

- 

My bf is WFH so there's a chance he caught my ex while he was dropping things off and they talked. He denies that but I'm becoming more and more paranoid now and I am definitely going to see what I can do to end this relationship in case they are secretly in cahoots.


I'm becoming more and more paranoid that they have somehow come into contact if Cole caught my ex while he was dropping stuff off previously and then became buddies. It makes no sense in my head but neither does any of this shit. It's all so nonsensical that I could believe anything at this point. I don't have the money to break my lease but I can kick Cole out since he's not on the lease.

- 

I admit I'm a pushover. Being raised by an abusive mother does that, sadly. I definitely needed this wake-up call.


I grew up with an abusive mom and an absent father so my relationship understandings are probably screwed up. Maybe I should probably go back to therapy for a while after this before putting myself out there again...

*September 29, 2025, 3 days later*

Hello all, my last post blew up a bit and many people were concerned about me so I'm going to give you this update. I can't even put into words how insane this situation has gotten.

When I got back home on Friday, I tried to come up with a good plan to keep myself safe while I confronted Cole in case he were to do something scary (a lot of people put the fear of god into me in the comments of my last post). I invited my very tall and intimidating younger brother over to be there while I talked to Cole. My brother couldn't come over until Sunday, so I spent a day and a half awkwardly trying to pretend everything was fine, but I must have done a shit job because Cole kept asking me what was wrong and love bombing me.

Eventually Sunday came around, my brother showed up and I/we grilled Cole about why the hell he's been so fine with my ex coming around with gifts and even letting him in to decorate our apartment for my birthday. I was NOT ready.

All of you had a lot of theories, one of which came up a lot was that the two knew each other and/or were working together to do this. If anything I would have RATHER that been the case because the truth is so much more fucked up.

Basically, Cole has been FIXATED on my ex. He has essentially been stalking my stalker. Cole admitted that he made fake social media accounts (Yes. Multiple.) to follow my ex, and has been stalking his Instagram and Facebook. Apparently, my ex has been making a lot of vent posts about me and how hurt he is that I'm not returning his feelings and have moved on so fast and Cole has been egging him on on his alt accounts to get my ex to keep trying. The reason my ex is still stalking me is because Cole has been literally telling him to on his fucking alt accounts. It's obvious my ex is unstable if he's listening to random strangers telling to ""keep trying"" and Cole is taking advantage of his instability by planting thoughts into his head. If I am to believe Cole's words, my ex has no idea that it's Cole that's been encouraging him to keep pursuing me but I can't be certain about anything this guy says at this point.

So why, you ask, was Cole doing all of this? That is exactly what my brother and I asked. This was his answer; to give my ex false hope. Basically to bully(?) him. Any time my ex angst-posted on his social media about me, Cole got some sick satisfaction out of watching his misery. He wanted to string my ex along to keep trying to win my heart just to watch him fail over and over. Cole finds it hilarious that my ex is wasting so much money on gifts for me and that it's HIM who eats the chocolates and reads the desperate love letters my ex sends to me while I act like my ex's gifts are radioactive and avoid them. This has all been some sick game to see how long he can get my ex to keep pining for me. Who the hell even DOES THIS? I've been living in fear for months because Cole thinks it's funny to manipulate my ex and watch him be ""heartbroken""? I cannot articulate how sick all of this is. How is this funny? What is wrong with him? He said he ""makes sure not to go too far"" by discouraging my ex to make direct contact with me but I can't believe anything anymore. I've read so many stories of people who were dating someone who seemed so sweet initially but turned out to be actually unhinged, but I naively never thought that could be me. I was so careless and dumb because I clung to someone who finally treated me with kindness but he is a twisted man who turned my ex into a monster by feeding his delusions. I think if he hadn't done all this, my ex probably wouldn't still be stalking me in the first place!! My constant fear and discomfort have just been an ""unfortunate byproduct"" of his little game of puppetry. I can't even comprehend how someone could do something like this. I'm so shaken up I feel like I'm spiraling.

Suffice to say I'm living with my brother and his gf while my ex gets the hell out. I told him he needs to move out within the week or I'm getting the cops involved. He didn't make a fuss or anything, surprisingly. He just looked at the floor like a kicked puppy. He hasn't even tried to call or text me but I blocked him just in case. I'm going to see if my landlord can understand my situation and let me break lease early with no extra cost, but if I can't, my brother is going to cover the extra cost in the meantime, and I'll stay with him and his gf until I can find somewhere else. My brother is seriously a godsend.

I'm DEFINITELY going to go back to therapy as soon as possible because this whole situation has me unable to sleep at night, trust anyone and I really need a better understanding of what are red flags in relationships. So many of you told me I was a pushover and you're all right. It shouldn't have taken this long for me to call this relationship with Cole off. This is so fucked up, but I'm safe for now. I don't know what I'd do without my brother and his gf. Thanks to everyone who told me to get out of this relationship because Cole was way more twisted than I ever could have thought. I don't even know if he told the whole truth, but I don't even care anymore. I'm out. Gone. Never looking back.

Edit: Thank you everyone for your advice and words of encouragement! I called the non-emergency police line to file a report of all this. It wasn't super helpful other than just making a record so I'll do a follow-up with them once I have safe access to my apartment and can collect evidence. I unblocked Cole for now to gather any text evidence as some of you suggested but he's been pretty quiet. He sent a photo of a couple of garbage bags full of his stuff and he asked if he could have a day to say goodbye to my cat (I have her with me currently at my brother's place, no way am I letting her near him). I haven't replied yet. I turned read receipts off. Haven't contacted ex 1 yet (still figuring out the best way to do that). Tomorrow is a stat holiday where I live so my brother and his gf will be home from work. We are working together to figure all this out. Definitely moving out of my current place as soon as I can. Sorry I can't reply to all the comments, I'm still pretty overwhelmed and anxious and there are so many that it's frying my brain but I'm trying to read most of them. I appreciate every one of you, though!

># Some of the comments by OOP:

- 

I took the week off from work because I need to just figure all this shit out. I'm so full of anxiety but my brother is trying to distract me by talking about competitive Pok√©mon (bless his heart).

- 

*[several comments say to have somebody tell her ex that he is being stalked and cyberbullied]*
I was so caught up in escaping that I never considered this. You're right. Thank you for reminding me, my head is such a mess right now. I'll need to brainstorm the best way to let my ex know. I hate to know how he'll react to that, though.

I'm going to find a way to get someone to tell him. He might be a creep but he deserves to know he's been manipulated.

Oh I am definitely not going to contact my stalker ex myself. I'll probably get my brother to do it since he at least met my ex a few times while I was dating. My dumb self didn't think to record Cole's confession so we don't have hard proof of his cyber harassment toward my ex. Just gotta hope he believes us and stops interacting with Cole's alt accounts (though I don't know the name of Cole's alts, just that he has them, which is also complicated)

- 

He was sending me gifts before I started dating Cole but it definitely ramped up AFTER I started dating Cole

- 

Sometimes a girl needs a hard dose of reality from some wise Redditors to get her shit together. I'm glad I posted here holy crap

- 

I will buy him a draft beer and get him a custom mug that says ""World's Best Brother"" with a Tyranitar on it.

I've always had trouble getting close to girls.



I see a lot of hypocrisy and indifference. Many tell me I'm handsome, and some even tell me I should be a model (of course, just because someone gives me a compliment doesn't mean they want to date you or anything). But I notice some truly contradictory attitudes.



I've met girls who were ""curious"" but lost interest after an hour of coffee. Some match on Tinder and message me first, then move on to IG and ask them out on a date, but they never respond. Others stare at me on the street. I go to meet them, they compliment me, then after maybe three messages, they stop talking to me, or maybe they don't even accept my follow. I try to figure out if something's wrong with me, but seriously, I'm afraid of being alone. I see a lot of girls who don't even know what they want because they're still ""childish."" I've had some girls who you'll follow and then notice nothing, and then they're pissed off when you shift your attention to others. They'll take a step and then back away. Others you're nice to say, ""You're perfect,"" but they're obsessed with the ex who used to hit them, and they go back to him... I wonder if I should try with thirty-year-olds.

Let's be honest: in today's data-driven world, information is power. But what happens when that power is locked away in scanned documents, PDFs, and handwritten forms? You're left with a treasure trove of data you can't actually use, slowing down decisions and creating manual, error-prone work.

This is where Intelligent Character Recognition (ICR) comes in. It's not just an upgrade from old-school OCR; it's about bringing in a smart, automated system that doesn't just see text, it¬†*understands*¬†it. Think of it like hiring a super-analyst who can read, interpret, and organize thousands of documents in the time it takes you to grab a coffee.

# So, what's new and exciting in ICR for 2025?

* **AI and Machine Learning are Taking Over**¬†‚Üí Instead of relying on rigid templates, modern ICR uses adaptive AI that learns from every document it processes. The more it works, the smarter and more accurate it becomes, even with messy handwriting or complex layouts.
* **Hyper-Automation is the End Game**¬†‚Üí ICR is no longer a standalone tool. It's becoming the critical ""eyes"" of larger robotic process automation (RPA) systems, seamlessly digitizing information and triggering entire workflows without human intervention.
* **Unstructured Data is No Longer a Problem**¬†‚Üí The biggest leap? New ICR solutions can tackle unstructured documents‚Äîlike invoices, contracts, or medical forms, with ease, intelligently identifying and extracting key fields like dates, names, and totals.
* **It's More Accessible Than Ever**¬†‚Üí Thanks to cloud-based platforms and APIs, integrating powerful ICR into your existing systems is faster and more cost-effective. You get enterprise-level data extraction without the enterprise-level setup headache.

Ultimately, adopting modern ICR is a¬†strategic partnership with efficiency. It‚Äôs about automating the tedious, minimizing errors, and freeing your team to focus on analysis and innovation, not data entry.

The second date was the problem for me tough, I enjoy talking to him so much I did not want to focus solely on physical attraction so I let him know I was nearby for a cup of coffee for us to meet again.

Three things are bothering me;

‚Ä¢	‚Å†I make all the plans, he never has something in mind.

‚Ä¢	‚Å†He kept staring at the waitress ass in the coffee shop when I was talking, and it made me really uncomfortable.

‚Ä¢	‚Å†I paid him a coffee and told him he would pay the next one and he didn‚Äôt.

Little note;

My mother recently died due to Cancer and I told him a few weeks after it happened that I wasnt ready for a commitment and maybe I would benefit some time alone. I‚Äôm definately grieving and not sure I can invest on a relationship rn. He kind of pushed the bar for us to keep talking. I still sort of feel the same, most days I feel like I need my space and he just keeps texting (which I think its normal but Im not sure if I can do it right now on that level of intensity, texting every day all the time)",0,1759220490.0,dating_advice,11,0.5,False

1nu7iy0,https://www.reddit.com/r/bokashi/comments/1nu7iy0/bokashi_beginner_guide/,bokashi beginner guide,"Hello,

I've been experimenting with bokashi and biological innoculants for composting and garding for a while and i wanted to write a detailed post with all of the information i've gathered through out this process to help beginners have some basic understanding of the process to be able to experiment better and have some options while doing so. So here it is!

I'm not a micro biologist , so this explanation is based on my understanding from 2 years of research and experimentation with different ways of making the liquid culture and bokashi bran. Feel free to do your own research and please correct me if I'm wrong about any of this.

So bokashi is not true composting, it is a pre-composting stage that speeds up waste material decomposition and loads the material with beneficial bacteria before breaking it down completely using normal composting methods, basically pre-digesting the organic waste to make it easier for soil micro and macro organisms to finish the process by pickling the food waste using lactobacillus bacteria(LAB). 

 Japanese Prof. Teruo higa refined an ancient traditional process of composting by selecting for specific beneficial anaerobic Effective Micro-organisms(EM) in his innoculant which include lactic acid bacteria(lactobacillus strains) , yeast and photosynthetic bacteria as the 3 major families of beneficial anaerobic bacteria(many different strains of each to my understanding). There are many companies that produce commercial EM currently and each company has their own proprietary mixed culture of many strains of bacteria that they claim offer different benefits but the base of e of them are aforementioned 3 families of bacteria.

The most studied LAB strain for composting,soil and plant health to my knowledge is lactobacillus plantarum.

The major benefits of using bokashi instead of traditional hot or cold composting imo are:
Speeding up decomposition: the lactic acid and enzymes produced by the bacterial culture soften and breakdown the organic waste to make it much easier and faster for soil micro organisms to finish the process.

Composting animal organic waste:  bokashi can handle material that isn't traditionally composted because of very high nitrogen content and potential for causing problems like attracting critters and smelling very stinky and avoid these issues.
Low PH: the lactic acid produced by the lactobacillus by consuming the simple sugars in the organic waste inhibits the growth of a lot of pathogenic micro organisms and the sour smell deters critters away from the compost.

High beneficial bacteria load: the organic waste is pre-loaded with beneficial bacteria that offer alot of benefits to plants including growth stimulation, pathogen inhibition, neutrients solubalization and creating suitable habitat for other beneficial micro organisms to colonize the compost and nitrogen fixation just to name a few. 
Propagating EM1: this is the most reliable method, mix commercial EM with mollases and water at a 1:1:19 ratio and let it ferment for a week or 2. You can experiment with fermenting it in indirect light to promote photosynthetic bacteria propagation as well.

Traditional method for making LAB: according to Korean Natural Farming(KNF) , you can make a wild LAB culture by letting rice wash water ferment for 2 weeks and then mixing it with milk 1:10 and letting ferment again for a week with a breathable lid, this method selects for LAB by using lactose from the milk as the as the primary simple sugar to promote LAB colonization in the liquid culture. This has the added benefit of using locally adapted strains of LAB already present in your environment and the starches from the rice water also promote some fungal diversity. This method can be hit and miss imo depending on your local environment and the micro organisms that happen to be present on the material you used. Generally the lactic acid inhibits the majority of pathogens if the lactic acid bacteria are able to outcompete other micro organisms in time but some pathogens are resistant.

I like to use an otc probiotic that has l.plantarum in it to ensure i have sufficient population for it to colonize the starter culture and then experiment with mixing it with other wild cultures, the propagation method is the same , mix the probiotic with water and mollases amd let it ferment for some time ratios not really important within reason , if you really want to ensure the culture is stable according to terragnix the ph of the liquid culture should be below 4. You can also experiment with adding starchy liquids from this like potatoes , rice, etc. To promote fungal diversity in the liquid culture.

None of these liquid cultures are pure cultures as they are not done under sterile conditions but the idea is that the low inhibits most of the unwanted pathogenic micro organisms.

You can use any of the aforementioned liquid culture to soak a powdered substrate like grain bran , sawdust, shredded paper, coffee grounds , etc. And ferment it anaerobically for a week or 2 and dry it to make bokashi bran. 

The bokashi buckets setup is very simple, you need a bucket with a sealing lid(raised bottom and tap to drain liquid optional) and you add the food waste periodically and alternate it with layers of bokashi bran, compress it to get out air pockets and keep it sealed between additions. When the bucket is full you seal it and let it ferment for at least a week, i've had buckets forgotten for over 6 months on my patio with no issues , it doesn't go bad, the longer you ferment it the faster it breaks down in soil. After the bucket is done fermenting you can use is as a soil amendment, bury it your yard , use it as a compost accelerator in a hot compost pile , or mix it and bury it in any container(soil factory) , if your soil is dry and dead the process might benefit from adding a little bit of high quality compost to introduce soil micro organisms, it can also be used in a worm farm after curing it in a soil factory for a while as the acidity might irritate the worms initially.

The liquid culture or dry culture(bran) can also be used as a soil amendment and foilar spray and to ferment organic waste to make fermented plant juice(FPJ) which is an organic liquid fertilizer. Also these cultures and bokashi don't have to be used in a strictly organic gardening setup , it also offers a lot of benefits when used with synthetic fertilizer , what you want to try to avoid while using biological gardening amendments are chemical pesticides if possible.

Some other well studied beneficial micro organisms to further research if interested that can be used as well to solve many other problems and enhance overall gardening/farming experience.

Trichoderma: a predatory fungus that outcompetes and inhibits soil fungal diseases and root rot issues
Mycorrhizae: a symbiotic fungus that has many growth promoting properties.

Bacillus Thuregensis: a bacteria used as a biopesticide for many kinda of larvae of pests.

Beauveria bassiana: an Entomopathogenic fungus that infects and kills many pest insects used as a bio insecticide.

There are many more but those are the ones I'm aware of.

Some additional resources to nerd out on if anyone's interested. 

Prof. Teruo higa's book on EM:An Earth Saving Revolution: A Means to Resolve Our World's Problems Through Effective Microorganisms (EM)

Matt powers youtube channel has multiple videos on EM and discusses different customized composting techniques to solve a lot of gardening/farming problems.

Dr. Christine jones and Dr. Elaine ingham work on soil ecosystems and quorum sensing: not directly related to EM or bokashi but it is scientific research on the roles of microorganisms in promoting soil and plant health.

Chris trump's KNF channel: not very scientific but it documents the traditional methods of Korean natural farming which alot of the scientific methods are refined , studied and derived from.

1nu7hxt,https://www.reddit.com/r/TechGadgetsAndGear/comments/1nu7hxt/is_rfid_blocking_gear_actually_useful_or_just/,Is RFID blocking gear actually useful or just fear-based marketing?,"I‚Äôve been seeing RFID blocking wallets and cards everywhere lately. Ads claim hackers can ‚Äústeal your bank info in seconds‚Äù just by walking past you with a scanner. It sounds scary, but part of me wonders if this is another case of fear-based marketing.

I started looking into it because I travel a lot and carry multiple cards and a passport. At first glance, RFID skimming sounds terrifying. Thieves can supposedly use a cheap scanner to capture the signal from your credit card or ID chip through a bag or pocket, and you wouldn‚Äôt even notice. I read that over 70% of RFID-enabled cards can be skimmed in just a few seconds. If that‚Äôs true, that‚Äôs pretty wild.

**Why I‚Äôm skeptical**  
Here‚Äôs the thing though: I don‚Äôt personally know anyone who has had this happen to them. Most of the fraud cases I hear about are from online scams, data breaches, or card cloning after a physical theft. Banks usually refund fraudulent charges quickly too. So, part of me thinks maybe this is a niche risk that‚Äôs being used to sell more products.

RFID blocking wallets and cards seem pretty simple: they‚Äôre made from materials that block the signal, preventing scanners from reading your cards. Products like [**Wallet Defender RFID blocking card**](https://getwallet-defender.com/offer-01/?lpid=1085&source_id=DL&utm_source=8928&utm_medium=&utm_term=1085&aff_id=8928&sub_id=&req_id=&oid=1085&device_type=&country_name=&oid=1085&affid=8928&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/TechGadgetsAndGear) are popular because they‚Äôre slim, fit in any wallet, and don‚Äôt need batteries or setup. But I‚Äôm still not sure if I‚Äôm buying into a real safety feature or just clever marketing.

**What makes me take it seriously**  
On the other hand, I‚Äôve seen videos and tutorials showing how easy it is to buy an RFID scanner online and skim cards from a distance. Even if it‚Äôs not super common, the fact that it‚Äôs possible is enough to make me second-guess myself. Airports, public transport, and crowded events seem like prime spots for this kind of theft.

I found [**this article on RFID skimming**](https://techetc.co/hackers-can-steal-your-bank-account-id-in-seconds-this-card-blocks-them-instantly-02/?lpid=2618&source_id=DL&utm_source=8928&utm_medium=&utm_term=1085&aff_id=8928&sub_id=&req_id=&oid=1085&device_type=&country_name=&uid=2618&oid=1085&affid=8928&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/TechGadgetsAndGear) and it did make me think twice. Apparently, a lot of these scanners are easy to get and very small. The article pointed out that most victims never realize they‚Äôve been skimmed because the fraud shows up weeks later, making it harder to trace.

**The debate in my head**  
I keep going back and forth. On one hand, banks and credit card companies have strong fraud protection. If someone skims your card, you can usually get your money back. On the other hand, identity theft can be a nightmare to fix, and even if the risk is low, the idea of someone grabbing my data in a few seconds while I‚Äôm standing in line at a coffee shop feels unsettling.

A slim RFID blocking card seems like a small price to pay for peace of mind. It doesn‚Äôt require changing your wallet, and it lasts for years. But is it solving a real problem, or just giving me one more thing to worry about?

**Why I‚Äôm asking here**  
This feels like one of those things where security experts, frequent travelers, and tech-savvy folks might have a better take. Are RFID skimming attacks something that actually happens often, or are these products mostly taking advantage of fear marketing?

Do you use RFID blocking gear like wallets or cards? Have you or anyone you know actually been skimmed? Or do you think this is one of those solutions looking for a problem?

I‚Äôm genuinely curious because I‚Äôm not totally convinced either way. If the risk is real and common, it makes sense to carry something like Wallet Defender for extra security. If not, maybe it‚Äôs one less thing to buy into.",1,1759220071.0,TechGadgetsAndGear,0,1.0,False
