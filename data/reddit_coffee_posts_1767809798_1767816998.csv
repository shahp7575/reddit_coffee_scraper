1q6q7s6,https://i.redd.it/37ba09zkizbg1.png,The Alpha's Unwanted Mate,"Just because I refused to let my Alpha mate’s first love be my bridesmaid at my bonding ceremony, that night, I was drugged and placed unconscious, half-naked, on a pool table.



His buddies laughed, measuring my legs with cue sticks, some even pouring cold liquor over my body.



“One shot in!” Someone whistled. “With a beauty as company, my skills are improving!”



My mate’s first love, Daphne, held up a phone, maliciously laughing in my ear.



“A substitute is just a substitute. Like now, you're lying there, letting them do as they please—this is your true role!”



My Alpha mate, Asher, thought that under the influence of the drug, I wouldn’t remember anything.



He spent the whole night humiliating me, all to please his first love.



What he didn’t know was that I had a natural resistance to ether-based drugs.



When I woke up, I wiped away my tears and scheduled an abortion.



Back then, on the pool table, I groaned in pain, and Daphne playfully pouted, “I just wanna live the dream of walking the red carpet with Asher. How dare you, a substitute mate, say no!”



Asher pulled her closer and rolled his eyes, casually saying, “She made Daphne unhappy, so of course, I had to punish her.”



His friends laughed uproariously.



“Don’t worry, we’ll make Ophelia beg for mercy! We’re all curious how Asher tames her to be so obedient.”



Asher answered lazily, “I bought some toys to spice things up. She thought I cared for her, so she gladly accepted.”



“True Alpha, staying so loyal to your true love! But… aren’t you worried Ophelia will find out about you severing the mate bond?”



Asher smirked, clearing the last ball with a swift strike.



“She dares? She’s just an orphan Omega who signed a bond-sealing deal with me and got pregnant. Now, she’s playing around like this. Who else would want her?”



“To be honest, a pregnant Omega she-wolf smells bad. Every night, I almost puke.”



“I disciplined her to make clear that being my Luna doesn’t give her the right to trample Daphne.”



Somebody asked, “Alpha, those packages you had delivered to Ophelia... you specifically told the shop not to ship them anonymously, right? That’s why she lost her shot at the Top Warrior title. That was for Daphne too, wasn’t it?”



Asher ran his hand over Daphne’s waist, smiling faintly.



“Although the spot was already decided, if I didn’t ruin her reputation, how could I ensure Daphne wouldn’t be gossiped about after she was granted the top warrior?”



Daphne looked embarrassed. “She said I demonstrated the move wrong. That embarrassed me. Asher was just giving her a little lesson!”



My heart clenched.



A scene in my memory suddenly struck me—dozens of transparent packages had piled up at the pack’s training ground entrance, and the pack members’ eyes were full of disgust.



I felt heartbroken as I watched my beloved students drop my training classes.



But I never expected this was all part of his scheme.



The laughter continued in the pool hall as my heart sank.



Asher seemed to remember something. He pulled a stack of photos from his pocket, and scattered them across my body.



“Callen, post these photos in the parent group. I want Ophelia to resign and go home, completely out of Daphne’s way.”



“Wow, these were taken in the training field, full-body shots, no face blurred!”



“If those parents see this, they’ll go ballistic!”



The laughter and shrieks grew louder and louder, and my tears fell without stop.



Asher wasn’t like this before. Two years ago, his mother, our pack’s Luna, asked me to assist him before she fell into a coma from a car accident.



I gave up my chance to become an Alpha king’s warrior, training our pack’s underage werewolves day and night, hoping they could become excellent warriors too.



Asher was kind to me as well, always handing me electrolyte drinks before training.



It wasn’t until the night we signed the bond-sealing deal that I learned Asher wasn’t just born with a big cock, his desires were just as strong.



He bought plenty of toys and liked taking me to the training field after school and making love there.



I thought the wilderness excited him, but the real reason was to slander me in favor of Daphne…



“Alpha, if Ophelia apologizes to Daphne tonight, should I still post them?”



Chapter 2

Asher didn’t hesitate. “Of course. You don’t know how upset Daphne was when she got kicked out of the bridesmaid group. She saved my mom from the accident, and I can’t let her be upset!”



Daphne lowered her eyes, a faint, forced smile on her lips.



Callen’s expression hardened, and he slammed the cue stick on the table.



“Bitch, how dare you bully the Alpha’s precious! You deserve to suffer!”



Pain shot through me, and I passed out.



The next morning, I woke up in my bed, my pajamas intact.



Asher had already gone to the pack meeting. On the nightstand, as it had been for three unbroken years, sat a warm cup of electrolyte water.



I hid under the covers and cried, then shakily called Mia, the pack member in charge of the ceremony.



“Keep what Daphne ordered, and cancel my segment.”



Mia paused for a moment. “Are you sure, Ophelia?”



No wonder she was surprised.



The bridesmaid dress Daphne ordered was larger than mine, decorated with rhinestones.



The so-called bridesmaid even insisted on a 14-carat Oppenheimer pink diamond.



At first, I didn’t know who she was.



I asked Asher’s friends and learned she was his childhood sweetheart and first love.



When I rushed to the pack’s planning room, I coincidentally walked in on Daphne proposing a “memorial for the first love” during the ceremony.



Mia looked at me with hesitation.



“Asher said our memories are too precious to not share at the ceremony. He’ll regret it for life if we don’t.” Daphne intentionally emphasized “for life,” ‘accidentally’ slipping a faded photograph from her bag.



In the photo, young Asher was kissing the top of her head.



While in these three years, he rarely kissed me.



I stared at it, my chest tight, and gritted my teeth.



“This isn’t appropriate. There’s no need for Daphne to be a bridesmaid.”



Daphne didn’t get angry; instead, she smiled.



“No worries, there will always be ‘surprises’ at the bonding ceremony, right?”



As I left the planning room, my hands shook.



That night, Asher comforted me, “You are right, the ceremony should go as you wish.”



But when he thought I was asleep, he lowered his voice and made a call.



“Go along with her. I’ll make her regret it. Daphne, don’t cry.”



I froze.



But if Asher liked Daphne so much, why did he keep saying that he loved me? That he only wanted to mark me and seal the mate bond with me for life?



I suddenly recalled a conversation at a pack gathering when Gamma Leo had been drunk.



“Ophelia? If not for her assistance in securing Asher’s Alpha position, an Omega like her would never be a warrior trainer in our pack.”



“Exactly, if Luna Isla hadn’t stopped Daphne from becoming our Luna, Ophelia wouldn’t have had a chance.”



My heart twisted, aching so badly I could barely breathe.



No wonder I was always the one handling the daily training, and Asher and Daphne were sent to visit with other packs.



The public lessons I spent nights preparing were given to Daphne to showcase, becoming her capital for fame.



I fled home and dialed a number.



“Is the Lycan joint training program still looking for warriors? Tristan, I want to sign up.”



Tristan’s voice sounded surprised.



“Ophelia, you were always the best warrior in training camp. We’ve been hoping to recruit you!”



After paused, his tone turning cautious.



“But this program is in the Lycan region of Europe, requiring at least six months of residency. Are you sure about this?”



I clenched the phone tightly, glancing at the bonding ceremony invitation Asher had casually thrown on the coffee table—Daphne’s name had been added back to the bridesmaid list.



The assholes who had humiliated me were also in the groomsmen group.



The embossed letters burned into my eyes.



“I’ve made up my mind. The sooner, the better.”



After hanging up, I began packing my bags.



When my collection of silk scarves spilled out, I realized, they were just the matching items Asher bought for Daphne’s bags.



I snorted, throwing them all into the trash.



When Asher returned home, he saw me curled up on the couch and frowned slightly.



“What are you doing here? Are you feeling sick?”



The sting on my body reminded me that what happened in the pool hall wasn’t a dream.



I lowered my head, exhausted.



“Asher, cancel all the orders online. I don’t want them anymore.”



Asher paused, then realized, looking at the trash can filled with the little gifts he bought for me.



Chapter 3

“Honey, didn’t you say you liked how thoughtful I am?”



His voice was soft, placating.



I finally lifted my gaze to look at him. “I didn’t sleep well last night. My whole body hurts. Do you know why?”



With three years of relationship, our mate bond, and the little life inside me, I’m giving him one last chance.



Asher’s eyes flickered, and then he cooed, “Maybe it’s just pregnancy fatigue, honey. I’ll have the healer come check on you.”



I laughed hysterically, smashing the anniversary couple clay sculpture he made with my hands.



Asher stared at a broken piece for a long time before hesitantly speaking, “Is it the pregnancy... making you feel this way?”



I shook my head and slid the bond-breaking deal into a pile of training plans, pushing them toward him.



He signed without looking, then gently massaged my head with his thumb.



“Would you like me to run you a warm bath to relax?”



A wave of nausea rose in my stomach.



It was those very hands, the ones that spread my indecent photos in the pool hall.



It was that very mouth that spat out mean words and called me a used Omega.



“I agreed to let Daphne be the bridesmaid.”



When Asher heard this, he froze. “Why the sudden change of heart?”



“I thought about it. Maybe I was too petty.” I forced a smile.



“Besides, she’s your mom’s savior. I shouldn’t be so selfish.”



Mentioning Luna Isla, Asher hesitated no more, holding me tightly and saying, “Ophelia, you’re so considerate! If Daphne hadn’t walked ten kilometers to get help for my mom, she might have been gone, instead of being in a vegetative state now…”



I furrowed my brow, silent.



After the accident, Luna Isla had been in a coma, and the details of that day were still unclear.



“Don’t worry. I’ll take time off to be with you for the birth, take care of you and the pup.”



Just then, Asher’s phone buzzed twice. He let go of me and quickly walked to the balcony.



On the balcony’s monitor, Asher whispered, “Daphne, I told you I’d make your wish come true. No need to post those photos now.”



A syrupy voice came from the speaker.



“I don’t think so, Asher. You promised to make me the only excellent warrior trainer. Besides, if those photos go out, Ophelia will quit and stay in the pack house, focusing on you and the pup. It’s better for your little family, and it makes me feel better, isn’t it?”



After a long pause, Asher sighed and agreed, “Okay.”



Two minutes later, my phone rang like a death knell.



I flinched, and the phone, along with my heart, dropped to the floor.



\[Daphne: Ophelia, what’s going on? Why did you take those disgusting photos?\]



\[Hayden’s father: This is sick! How could someone like this teach our kids? How could she be our future Luna?!\]



\[Mira’s mother: I’m going to Alpha tomorrow! Such unscrupulous trainer needs to be thrown out of the pack!\]



My teaching career, my reputation, was destroyed in minutes.



When Asher returned to the living room, he glanced at the group chat and sighed.



“Ophelia, I believe you. Tomorrow happens to be Daphne’s award ceremony. I’ll go with you to explain, okay?”



I kept explaining, but the insults kept growing.



A wave of exhaustion overtook me.



“I don’t want to go.” Asher was surprised by my refusal, looking at me in disbelief.



Then his gaze shifted to the mate ring on the coffee table, and he smiled knowingly.



“You don’t have to worry about our bonding ceremony. The invitations have been sent, and it will be held as planned the day after tomorrow.”



“You’re the Luna. If you don’t show up, the pack will talk. What will they think of Daphne? She’ll face suspicion because of you.”



The next day, Asher dragged me to Daphne’s ceremony.



As soon as we entered the pack hall, whispers filled the air.



“There she is, shameless!”



Asher’s friends ogled me, their eyes lingering on my waist and hips.



My face flushed as I tried to turn and flee.

I started in this particular position (it is technically a corporation) and I am.. miserable. Apart from one other employee I am the ONLY ONE with coffee experience coming in, and it’s a nightmare. I was led on to believe I would be getting a management position, and then found out from a fb post someone else was chosen. I’ve watched someone slam the espresso shot glasses down so hard they shatter (not 1 or 2, I’m talking 5) someone else over tightening the portafilters to the point of getting stuck and damaging the machine, employees refusing to follow recipes because “it just doesn’t feel right”, appliances and tools not being correctly cleaned, music blasting in my ears at top volume (picture click-track SoundCloud rapping- I’m on the verge of hard of hearing and haven’t been able to interact properly with customers) and I’m being paid very little for the hours I work (I’m at full time hours while still being a full time student). I have brought up all of my concerns with management and was told I’m overstepping and being dramatic. Today I went and applied elsewhere and I have no idea how to talk to the manager because they constantly criticize, guilt-trip those who have left and make life hell already. The owners are extremely involved and I am afraid to talk to them because the retention rate for staff has been so bad recently, and I’m scheduled so much it’d be hard to fill. Obviously I am not perfect and I’m definitely replaceable, but I’m just extremely fed up and tired. I know I just need to be brave and just tell them I quit but no one is ever in a position I feel comfortable discussing this and I know the second I say I’m done I’ll be drug through the mud (this has happened with everyone that’s left) and my people pleasing can’t take it.

We're planning to visit Chicago in mid-April for a Blackhawks/Blues game. Looking for suggestions on places to go when we're there. Both daytime and evening. 6 or so guys in their 50's

* Live Music (Blues or Rock)
* Used record stores
* Book stores

Would prefer neighborhood bars with music over something like Buddy Guy's (which I'm sure is just fine. Just not what we're looking for.) Back in ancient history (80's and 90's) we visited Rush and Division and Goose Island so looking for something different.

Assuming we can get an Uber or Taxi if something isn't near the L.

For a daytime stroll I'd like to find a neighborhood or district that has a great local coffee place and the above mentioned book/record shop so we could hit a few of those spots in one area. Extra points if it's kind of a grungy artsy area.

I think the question I want to ask is fairly simple, but bear with me.  


I bought an apartment and have been living there for about 4 months now. The day I moved here, I was in the parking lot with all of my stuff and this cute, good-looking girl came walking by and entered the complex from the parking lot. One of my best friends who was helping me move (let's call him Peter) recognized her as she was walking by and he said to me that he knew her from school. I thought something along the lines of ''huh, small world'' and thought nothing of it.

Fast forward to two weeks ago. All of a sudden, for some reason, I start encountering her more and more in and around the complex as I leave for work, come home from work or go out for a walk with my dog. It started with just a polite ''Hi'' for the first 4-5 times I encountered her, which have all been in the past two weeks. At first I was just being the polite and friendly neighbor, but after like the 5th time encountering her, I kind of became more interested as it hit me that she is indeed really cute.

Yesterday I came home from work and I saw her entering the elevator. Purely out of instinct (I don't know how or why this happened, I'm pretty social and friendly, but nervous when it comes to matters like this one), I exclaimed something like ''Hold it, please!'' (as in, hold the elevator). I got in the elevator and she said Hi to me to again, she asked me which floor I needed to go to and she pushed the 1st floor button for me, after which she stared back at her phone. Purely out of instinct again, completely without thinking about it, I reached out my hand and said something stupid like ''I should introduce myself'' and luckily she replied ''Yeah, of course! We've been running into each other quite a bit lately!'' as we shook hands and exchanged names. Let's call her Annie, for the sake of this post. I asked her how long she had been living here and as the told me she's only been living here for about 7 months, she asked me how long I've been living here for and I replied in kind.

I had to get out of the elevator pretty fast (I live on the first floor after all), and as I got out, I asked her which number she lived at. Again, she happily told me which number she lived at and asked me which number I was on, which I obviously told her. This is kind of the moment where I started to cave, because after I answered her, I just abruptly waved and said something like ''I'll see you around!'' and walked on (stupid, stupid, stupid!). When I got home and sat on my couch, it hit me that this was the girl my friend Peter recognized a couple of months before.

That night I went to visit Peter to play DnD and I asked him whether he knew a girl named Annie that lives in my apartment building and he replied, telling me her full name and that they had been at Uni together for about 3 years. Being the friend that he is and without me asking (I don't even have any socials at all), he opened her Instagram to check her photos because according to him, she had a boyfriend/husband before, but he noticed that she had deleted all of those photo's off of her Instagram-page, so apparently they might have broken up, which could explain her moving here about 7 months ago. Peter urged me to just talk to her again and maybe ask her if she wants to go out and grab a coffee sometime. The sheer idea made me nervous instantly, but I do see a situation where she could say yes? I mean, she was very open and friendly when I talked to her in the elevator, and we made pretty intense (to me at least) eye contact all the while, which in itself means absolutely nothing obviously.

I've kind of decided that I want to at least try and shoot my shot. I'll gladly take a no for an answer, but maybe she'll say yes right? Who knows what might happen. I'm just really stuck on the way I should go about this. Preferably, I'd run into her in the building again and ask her face-to-face after making some light conversation again, but I can't control whether I'm going to run into her again or not. Would it be a good idea to maybe leave a simple note in her post-box? Maybe a note saying something like: ''Hey Annie! I enjoyed talking to you in the elevator a few days ago! Would you like to grab a coffee together sometime?'' The thing is, I really really do not want to creep or freak her out or anything of the sort. I want to go about this in a respectful way, we live in the same building after all.  


What should I do? Wait until I run into her again (even though that might take days or weeks if luck is not on my side) or leave her a simple note in her post-box? I've thought about perhaps just knocking on her door and asking her that way (because she told me implicitly where she lives), but I still do not want to risk creeping her out. Again, what should I do here? I'm stuck!

He kept saying there was no way to make friends back home. I suggested clubs in college like robotics he might be interested or going together, but he brushed it off every time by saying “nevermind. sry for bothering you”

This pattern escalated on NYE when he had a breakdown and said he might drop out of college and stay home. When I tried to talk it through, he again tried to shut down the conversation. I pushed back and told him (probably too bluntly) that it felt like he was asking for help but avoiding any solution. That seemed to snap him out of it after a long talk + he agreed to stay another quarter and seemed better.

Once we were back, the cycle returned. He’d ask for advice about simple things (setting an alarm, going to class, making coffee) and then ignore it out of anxiety, saying he’d rather not do the thing at all. At one point I had to basically force him to make coffee he really wanted but felt to “embarrassed” to make. He thanked me. (Though I felt like a dick) 

That night I told him honestly that I love him, but constantly giving advice that gets dismissed makes me feel unheard and unvalued. He understood, and we had a great dinner.

However, yesterday he stayed in bed all day, too anxious to shower, eat, or even use the bathroom. We had plans, which kept falling through because he couldn’t get ready. I tried reassuring him and giving him a step-by-step plan, but nothing changed. After hours of trying to help, I hit my breaking point and told him how hurt and frustrated I felt. I had to essentially threaten to come over and help him work through this in person until he begged me not to and took a shower. He finally said he thinks he needs professional help, and since then he hasn’t responded to my messages.

So here’s my question:

WIBTB for breaking up with him? I honestly love him and could spend the rest of my life with him. But his constant issues are draining me and I’m worried like my attempts at help are stressing him out even more. I don’t want to abandon him in his time of need but I also don’t want to be in a relationship that may be worse for both of us. Thank you.",2,1767816159.0,AmItheButtface,0,1.0,False

For context my mom and Lucy’s mom are pretty good friends they meet up for coffee once a month and go out for lunch together a few Times a year. After what happened between me and Lucy two weeks ago I didn’t think to tell my mom about it because nothing ever comes of our fights. I had to block Lucy because she was guilt tripping me and trying to make me feel like the bad guy and said I needed to get over my selfishness and start being a friend again. I blocked her on everything and thought that would be the end of it. I went to visit my mom today and when I got there she looked upset and when I asked her what was wrong she asked me how I could be so mean to Lucy. I was confused and asked her what she was talking about and my mom said that Lucy’s mom phoned her this morning and said I was bullying Lucy and that I dumped her for no reason and that I blocked her over nothing and said Lucy was having a break down. I was shocked and told my mom what actually happened and she was shocked and said it wasn’t like Lucy to lie and said she didn’t know who to believe which made me mad. I told my mom I couldn’t believe that she would believe Lucy over her own daughter I showed my mom the texts Lucy tried gaslighting me with and eventually she believed me. My mom then called Lucy’s mom to tell her what I said and after the call my mom looked torn. My mom said that Lucy’s mom was mad because I was Lucy’s only friend and Lucy is apparently taking losing me as a friend hard. My mom then said that even though Lucy was in the wrong everyone deserves a second chance. I got mad and told my mom that I had given Lucy multiple chances and I was done with her entitled behaviour and being her ATM. My mom said everyone makes mistakes and everyone deserves a second chance. I left after that and went home. Either my mom or Lucy gave Lucy’s mom my cell number and Lucy’s mom and my mom are pleading with me to give Lucy another chance but I’m done Lucy hasn’t even apologized or payed me back for everything. I’m torn I don’t want to be on bad terms with my mom but her constant pleading is wearing me down. I blocked Lucy’s moms number but she keeps texting me from new numbers i don’t know what to do. do I keep blocking the numbers do I get a new number I’m not giving Lucy anymore chances but all the pleading is making me second guess myself. I’m so stressed right now and don’t know what to do. ,3,1767816019.0,AmITheJerk,4,1.0,False

I graduated community college in 2022 with an Associates of Studio Art and have no debt at all.

Recently about a year or so ago, my parents and I were talking about me finding a job despite me working at a volunteer coffee shop (which I quit last year in December after a year and 2 months of working there). I told them about how the job market is bad right now and how I’ve been looking for a job since I graduated. 

They say they get how the job market is despite not ever really looking at it as they have been employed long before the current job market. Besides that, they’ve also always not liked when I cry and get angry at them or upset when we have the talks. They also say that I’m just like my dad (He was verbally abusive and did drink but has gotten himself together somewhat since the divorce) which only fuels my dislike towards them. 

More recently because of me having no job after getting off the volunteer coffee shop, they asked me to look for a job. They expect me to do basically 4 to 5 hours of job applications while I do about 20 to 45 minutes of applying and doing quality ones. Today was hard because my stepmom said she would take away my phone despite me needing it.

I’m new to reddit and this is my first post. I need all the help I can get.

I am a 28 year old female who is healthy. I usually workout 6 days a week doing weight lifting and cardio. My resting heart rate is usually 65-70.

October 30th, 2025 I contracted some illness. It felt like cold symptoms, and my husband had it too. For my husband it was respiratory and for me, it was a sore throat and feeling fatigued with malaise and a slight cough. I had some chest congestion for a while. I started to feel better until November 4th at night, I started getting a sore throat and headache. I woke up November 5th, 2025 (2 months ago), with a heart rate of 130 and a tight chest with dizziness. After about 20 min, it went away. My resting heart rate was around 100 and it felt like my heart was beating out of my chest for a couple hours after. This happened again the next day and I went to the ER. Long story short for the heart problems, I had 100 ddimer and no tropinin in my system. I saw a cardiologist, wore a heart monitor for 3 days and did an echo with several EKGs. He said my heart is “perfect” and prescribed me propranolol and gave a diagnosis of sinus tachychardia. My symptoms were primarily in the morning by the way. Its when i wake up.

I saw a pcp, he checked my thyroid and all levels were normal. He checked for hashimotos and it was negative. Several other things I don’t remember, but everything was normal. Then a couple days later, i woke up and felt like I had pins and needles and was on fire on my arms and legs with a rapid heart rate. This happened for two hours before I went to the ER and my bp was 178/130. This went down after some time and the symptoms resolved on their own.

A week later, I developed nausea. The heart symptoms subsided, but the nausea was prominent. I have never thrown up. I ate low fat because we speculated it was my gallbladder. This helped the nausea but it took time for my stomach to subside. I did a HIDA scan and my symptoms were all reproduce and I had an ejection fraction rate of 37%. This was considered borderline normal, and the irregular EF rate is 35%. I spoke to a gi and surgeon, they ordered an abdominal ct with contrast. They found nothing. I did an endoscopy, they found nothing. So I got my gallbladder removed.

Today I am two weeks post op. I took hydrocodone the first three days. I ate better than I was presurgery and thought i was cured. When I came off the hydrocodone, my heart beat extremely hard and was resting at 100bpm. No nausea at all so far. I thought this was coming off the drugs and just having surgery. Day 5 post op i became adventurous and ate 5 mcdonalds chicken nuggets with some fries. I became nauseous 2 hours later and severely nauseous the next day. Im talking 8/10 pain but no vomiting. I contacted my surgeon, he ordered an abdominal ct which was normal. He prescribed promethazine and thats helpful, but it makes me drowsy. I was having bile acid diarrhea and intense burning in my abdomen. My nausea subsided then came back but still had burning, this is all on and off. My pcp has me do a uti test at home. It was slightly positive and he put me on an antibiotic that can make you nauseous, and honestly i think it does that to me. I started colesevelem and that has helped dramatically with the burning in my abdomen, and I don’t have diarrhea anymore. Im slowly getting better since starting the colesevalem, but i still get burning if I eat a banana oddly enough. Milk or protein shakes make me instantly nauseous. When my stomach is empty, i am also nauseous. This seems to be the most common denominator. I am also on a proton pump inhibitor and have been for over a week. But the main symptom right now is feeling burning when i dont take colesevalem and difficulty eating with an early feeling of being full. Im also extremely fatigued, but im still 2 weeks post op.

My surgeon said i was a zebra and a unicorn. He referred me to a gi whom im having difficulty getting into.

This has been one of the most emotionally exhausting things i have gone through. The constant on and off nausea, an inability to eat normally. I have been eating no fat, coffee, alcohol since November 11th. Ive lost 20lbs and im already a thin person. Im not sure if this is from a virus or a disease that progressed. Now im thinking gallbladder was only a part of the picture. Its like I woke up with this. If anyone knows of anyone who has been through something similar, I would love help and direction. Or even just community because this is so isolating.",1,1767815643.0,gallbladders,0,1.0,False

It was past midnight, and it had been a tiring night for me. I had just finished reading a book when I received your message saying you missed me and wanted to see me. I finished two matcha latte to stay awake, feeling excited to see you. At 3:00am I walked to the same street where you always fetched me, just a few minutes from our apartment. Thought you would arrive at 3:30am. I waited for you on that corner of the same street, standing there for an hour while the song “I Like Me Better” played on loop through my airpods. And it didn’t bother me waiting that long.

Then you arrived at exactly 4:00 am, and I saw you waiting in your car, you were wearing a yellow shirt, waving and smiling at me as you greeted me once I hopped in. You had prepared gifts for me, and you even brought your favorite childhood drink and let me try it, and I secretly giggled. Then you asked me what I wanted to do. As always, you gave me three good options because I’m always indecisive, whether I wanted to eat ramyeon, drink alcohol, or just have coffee. I chose to just have coffee and chill, so we went to a coffee shop in Manda. After a very thoughtful conversation about what we did during the holidays and how life has been, we decided to go somewhere private.

To our favorite place…

Inside that dark room, we expressed how much we longed for each other, and then we cuddled until we fell asleep. When I woke up and saw you still sleeping while holding me, it felt nice and warm beside you. How fascinating it was to be with you in the same room, lying in the same bed, under the same blanket we shared. I got the chance to gaze at your face and watch you sleep peacefully, listening to your little snores and feeling your breath on my face. I stayed still, not moving, afraid of waking you up.

But…

This time, it felt different. Didn’t you feel the air change? Or was it just me, realizing that things aren’t the same anymore? It’s been four months since we started seeing each other. I thought I would be excited to see you again, but surprisingly, I wasn’t. I found myself quiet and distant, disconnected from everything you said, as if a part of me had already begun to drift away but I don’t know why.

1q6ppe2,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1q6ppe2/what_could_have_been/,What could have been,"
I met up with my ex (we were together for 8 years) after 5 years apart today. High school sweethearts now both nearing 30. We had a horrible breakup but in all these years never lost contact. I’m moving abroad and we decided to meet. 

He ordered a beer. I’m on day 6 but this isn’t the first time I’ve quit (the longest was a year). He drank it quicker than I read the menu. 

He was really tense to begin with and then after the beer loosened up but was very elusive. I was so tempted to have a drink too. To loosen how I felt, to feel a bit of a buzz, to relax. But I realised I already felt those feelings. I felt kind of sad he needed a beer to.

We parted ways. The meeting was fine. No big revelations. Nice to see someone you used to care about doing ok. Also burst the nostalgia bubble that’s been brewing in my head all this time. He’s just a guy and I see why we broke up. 

If I’d had that drink and we didn’t continue at the restaurant together, I would’ve bought a carry out on the way home, or gone somewhere else. I would’ve drank alone. I would’ve gotten drunk. I would’ve messaged him, saying stuff that may or may not be true. I would’ve woken up tomorrow imagining a different version of what happened the day before. My emotions and dopamine would be out of whack. I would not be ok. 

He messaged after apologising for not being good company. I ignored it. He messaged a couple hours later saying a bit more. I’ve ignored that too. Not out of malice. I wonder if he carried on drinking. Maybe I will reply. Maybe I’ll leave it on read like so many people have done to me. All I know right now is I’m not sure so I won’t. 

I also want to sit with my sober thoughts and process, to breathe it in and let it out. To understand how I feel. To not go back to my old coping ways of numbing and then having the pain all hit me at once. 

It was weird. How that split decision between joining and leaving has left a completely different outcome. But you know what? I love this outcome. I went for a walk. I did some admin. I had a meal. I talked with my family. I’m having a bath next and reading then chocolate then bed then wake up tomorrow early and have a sunrise swim followed by coffee that doesn’t give me the jitters and a breakfast that doesn’t make me feel sick. I even felt uncomfortable and annoyed and kind of awkward and liked it! Like oh wow these feelings aren’t suppressed, they want no need to be felt! The other outcome would be a four pack x2, no food, messages, waking up unsure, regret, what can I remember, oh god I feel awful so I must feel awful about seeing him. Instead I get the truth kindly and assertively. 

It could be so different. Everything could be. I could still be with him and I’m not. And I didn’t realise how ok I was about that until he became real rather than a memory in my head. 

I could’ve had a drink and done things I wish I hadn’t. And instead I feel so at peace right now I can’t believe it. 

Next battle is the airport. But if I could do this today, I have a lot of faith in myself right now I can do it everyday.

1q6pp3p,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1q6pp3p/ive_met_a_nice_girl_in_my_apartment_complex_and/,"I've met a nice girl in my apartment complex and want to ask her out, but I'm unsure what to do and could use some advice.","Hey all,

I think the question I want to ask is fairly simple, but bear with me.  
  
I bought an apartment and have been living there for about 4 months now. The day I moved here, I was in the parking lot with all of my stuff and this cute, good-looking girl came walking by and entered the complex from the parking lot. One of my best friends who was helping me move (let's call him Peter) recognized her as she was walking by and he said to me that he knew her from school. I thought something along the lines of ''huh, small world'' and thought nothing of it.

Fast forward to two weeks ago. All of a sudden, for some reason, I start encountering her more and more in and around the complex as I leave for work, come home from work or go out for a walk with my dog. It started with just a polite ''Hi'' for the first 4-5 times I encountered her, which have all been in the past two weeks. At first I was just being the polite and friendly neighbor, but after like the 5th time encountering her, I kind of became more interested as it hit me that she is indeed really cute.

Yesterday I came home from work and I saw her entering the elevator. Purely out of instinct (I don't know how or why this happened, I'm pretty social and friendly, but nervous when it comes to matters like this one), I exclaimed something like ''Hold it, please!'' (as in, hold the elevator). I got in the elevator and she said Hi to me to again, she asked me which floor I needed to go to and she pushed the 1st floor button for me, after which she stared back at her phone. Purely out of instinct again, completely without thinking about it, I reached out my hand and said something stupid like ''I should introduce myself'' and luckily she replied ''Yeah, of course! We've been running into each other quite a bit lately!'' as we shook hands and exchanged names. Let's call her Annie, for the sake of this post. I asked her how long she had been living here and as the told me she's only been living here for about 7 months, she asked me how long I've been living here for and I replied in kind. 

I had to get out of the elevator pretty fast (I live on the first floor after all), and as I got out, I asked her which number she lived at. Again, she happily told me which number she lived at and asked me which number I was on, which I obviously told her. This is kind of the moment where I started to cave, because after I answered her, I just abruptly waved and said something like ''I'll see you around!'' and walked on (stupid, stupid, stupid!). When I got home and sat on my couch, it hit me that this was the girl my friend Peter recognized a couple of months before.

That night I went to visit Peter to play DnD and I asked him whether he knew a girl named Annie that lives in my apartment building and he replied, telling me her full name and that they had been at Uni together for about 3 years. Being the friend that he is and without me asking (I don't even have any socials at all), he opened her Instagram to check her photos because according to him, she had a boyfriend/husband before, but he noticed that she had deleted all of those photo's off of her Instagram-page, so apparently they might have broken up, which could explain her moving here about 7 months ago. Peter urged me to just talk to her again and maybe ask her if she wants to go out and grab a coffee sometime. The sheer idea made me nervous instantly, but I do see a situation where she could say yes? I mean, she was very open and friendly when I talked to her in the elevator, and we made pretty intense (to me at least) eye contact all the while, which in itself means absolutely nothing obviously.  


I've kind of decided that I want to at least try and shoot my shot. I'll gladly take a no for an answer, but maybe she'll say yes right? Who knows what might happen. I'm just really stuck on the way I should go about this. Preferably, I'd run into her in the building again and ask her face-to-face after making some light conversation again, but I can't control whether I'm going to run into her again or not. Would it be a good idea to maybe leave a simple note in her post-box? Maybe a note saying something like: ''Hey Annie! I enjoyed talking to you in the elevator a few days ago! Would you like to grab a coffee together sometime?'' The thing is, I really really do not want to creep or freak her out or anything of the sort. I want to go about this in a respectful way, we live in the same building after all.

What should I do? Wait until I run into her again (even though that might take days or weeks if luck is not on my side) or leave her a simple note in her post-box? I've thought about perhaps just knocking on her door and asking her that way (because she told me implicitly where she lives), but I still do not want to risk creeping her out.

Maybe I just don't have one in my brain. Compartmentalizing is a great word but how do I practice it? Of course I know it's a dreamworld, and I am well aware we each have our own lives. I wouldn't want it any other way. 

With last AP is had such a great connection! Great talker, all kinds of subjects, compatible in our needs and wants. Coffee date went fine. After a while our hoteldate followed. Went great, no butterflies but we did cuddle in between activities and kept in contact after. Awesome! 

Second date was longer, more cuddles, more talking, we held on more tight just before we had to go. I felt sooo free with him!
We started missing each other, were longing for the next date. 

So how and when did we cross the line? Should we have talked about the weather in between? 
If he shares personal things should I say, That's not my problem but hey, when do we fuck again?
I need to learn if there is an 'in between those two scenarios'. No FWB but no relationship either. 

He's gone, the guilt creeped in. Under his circumstances (can't elaborate) I even understand. I have no other choice than to accept. 
But dammit it hurts, I miss him and the connection we had so much! Only 2 months but what a match we were! This was my 2nd affair so pretty new to the 'game' and I find the disappointments hard to get over. Maybe it's not my game to play but I need the sex but I also need some sort of deeper connection.

1q6pnr6,https://i.redd.it/4w1yfy5sezbg1.png,Fated Bond: Noelle and Renzo,"At my best friend Kayla's mating party, my world shattered again. I was mated to the golden boy who destroyed my life in high school with a few cruel, public words.

Renzo stood there, eyes dark, declaring ""Mate.""



""Fu-ck you, not happening,"" I whisper, but the room erupts in applause.



The ballroom becomes a cage. I wanted to scream, to flee. But my friends, claiming it was for my own good, pushed me toward him.



I refused. I ran. But he always found me, the bond a chain.



""You're being dramatic,"" Kayla pleaded. ""The bond will win, Ellie. You will be happy.""



""We're mates,"" Renzo says. ""You will fall in love with me. Ellie. This is inevitable.""



""My name is Noelle, and I'd rather swallow glass.""



Kayla hisses, ""Think of your clinic—patients trust stable mates.""



My career, my reputation, he held them all hostage.



Now, trapped in his home, I face the boy who broke me and the man who claims me. The bond between us thrums, a traitorous pulse begging me to surrender. But I remember the whispers, the laughter, the life he destroyed.



My smile is cold. ""I would never be intimate with someone as disgusting as you.""



Yet every touch sparks fire, can I overcome the fated bond?



——



""Hey, do you know why Shawnee wasn't in today?"" I caught up to Kayla as the meeting let out.



She smiled as I reached her and nodded, ""yes I do. She mated.""



I wanted to roll my eyes, but said, ""that's great! Anyone we would know?""



It's not that I hated when people found their mates. And Shawnee had been looking and worrying for years because she hadn't found hers yet



She had no reason to worry. She was the average age for mating. Generally, people found their mates around 21 years old. Late bloomers could be 25. Some found their mate as early as their first year of college.



Everyone in my friend group had been whacked with the mating stick in the last six months. And I was sick of attending mating ceremonies. I was happy for her. But I never wanted to end up mated. I had seen first hand how the bond could be used to manipulate.



""Yes we do know him,"" the seriousness in Kayla's voice had me pausing and turning in the hallway toward my office. Her expression was equally serious, but she dipped her chin toward my office door and quietly said ""not here.""



My stomach sank, but I held my composure as we walked.



I immediately felt concern for Shawnee. Years of waiting, of hoping to find her one. She spoke of it constantly, excited chattering that I indulged the way you indulge a child that prattles on about their first day at an amusement park or a movie they enjoyed.



It could be one of three things: her mate was a known cruel person, her mate was someone she deeply disliked on a personal level, or her mate was someone from another society.



It wasn't rare for people to run into one of the three. Our society was small enough that you knew when someone was cruel, and we all knew who we didn't want to mate with due to personal bias. If her mate was from another society and had been traveling here, it would generally mean he or she was a politician, if I would know them or know of them. Shawnee would hate to be with a politician.



It wasn't abnormal that politicians married for alliances if they hadn't found their mate by the age of twenty three. Shawnee detested the drama that would come from something like that. She wanted a sweet, gentle mating and she deserved it. Shawnee was one of the best people I knew.



As soon as we walked into my office and shut the door, I turned toward Kayla.



""Okay. Lay it on me. Is she okay?"" I asked her, gesturing toward the couch that was up against the wall as I sat in one of the chairs on the other side of the coffee table, facing her.



She took a deep breath and with a small smile said, ""she's deliriously happy. However, her mate is Nico Bellavere.""



I inhaled sharply and stared at her for a minute. Part of me was hoping she would smile and say 'got you good didn't I?' And then tell me Shawnee was taking a sick day.



After a minute, I closed my eyes, and rubbed my temples with my fingers.



""Okay. So this means I will have to associate with Renzo on a limited basis. No big deal for one of my best friends,"" I opened my eyes and fake smiled at Kayla who was eyeing me dubiously.



""Babe. I know you hate him. We need to come up with a game plan.""



She was right. I did hate him. He was the reason that I had panic attacks, that it took me so long to open up to people and talk about my past. He was the reason why I changed my last name to my mother's maiden name.



I took in the concerned look and her face and felt my stomach clench.



""Kayla, I wouldn't ruin this for Shawnee. I know how important this is. I'm an adult. I'll hardly have to see him. At the mating ceremony and the wedding if they decide to have one. I'll just avoid him the best that I can,"" even I could hear how flat my voice was.



My stomach was tight and my hands felt cold. My brain was screaming at me not to do it. But when I thought of Shawnee and how she had supported me, stood by me for years, I knew I couldn't miss this.



I eyed Kayla with determination and said ""it'll be fine! What's the worst that could happen?"" with a false cheerfulness.



Famous last words.



I stood, hands on towel covered hips, staring at the three outfits laid out on my bed. Normally for mating ceremonies, people were dressed formally. For an important family, dress code was black tie.



The Bellavere's counted as an important family. Which is how I ended up digging into the back of my closet, and pulling out the three dresses I had that were suitable for black tie along with all of the accessories.



Even though I knew that it didn't matter what I wore, or how I presented myself, I was agonizing over it. I wanted to look confident, capable, and over what Renzo had done to me.



\~Flashback\~



The auditorium smelled like wood polish from the stage. The lights were shining on it and made the wood look almost white. I could hear the murmuring of the students around me. Pretending not to watch, pretending not to care. But I knew they were watching. They had been watching me since the first day I was here. Always waiting. Waiting for a crack. Waiting for something they could chew on so they could break me apart, spit me back up.



And then Renzo stepped up. The golden boy. He looked beautiful for a moment, but then he looked directly into my eyes and smirked. I had seen that smirk before. Right before he took someone down. I didn't even know what I did. I kept to myself. I was quiet. I did my school work-and did well. I didn't even have any friends.



When he spoke, he commanded authority at only seventeen years old. His voice held a dare to not listen to him and see what happened. No one dared to take him on.



""Since we're celebrating integrity tonight,"" his voice was calm, controlled, polite - surgical, even, ""maybe we should talk about how easily some people trade theirs.""



A ripple of murmurs. People leaning in. I felt my stomach sink to my toes.



""And of course,"" he continued, slow, deliberate, and savoring ""I have some examples.""



Her didn't even have to say my name. He spoke of a private meeting with administration - He suggested, thinly, that my family had bought her place at the school using our name and the money that was available to us.



The laughter started small. Then the phones came out. Whispered, sharp-edged comments, some cruel, some celebratory, all excited.



Somewhere in the back of my mind, a calm, a voice screamed at me to react - to argue, to defend myself, to tell them all I wanted was to go to school, and what had I ever done to them???



Instead I stood.



And I walked.



My steps were slow and deliberate. I stepped past faculty that hadn't done anything about Renzo's speech because they were scared of his daddy. I walked past the administrators who were pretending to be neutral. And I walked past Renzo, who stared down at me with an unreadable look in his eye but a cruel tilt to his lips.



I should have felt the camera lights from the phones on my skin. I should have been humiliated by every whisper, every laugh, every mocking word. But it all slid off of me like water.



When the doors finally closed behind me, the world outside felt too bright. The clips, the whispers, the narrative - I knew it was already spreading. Already shaping how everyone would see me, my family.



And I felt it, the first quiet pulse of a life altered forever.



\~End flashback\~



Renzo had gotten what he wanted that afternoon. I had never gone back to that school. The attack on my father's integrity had caused a massive backlash on my family and he had lost his job as the head of Human Resources at a Fortune 500 company. It resulted in us selling our house and car, moving to a more modest area. But we had survived.



We had made it but we were not without our scars. The only good part of that horrific year where we all fell apart was how close we had gotten. It was just me, Dad, and mom. And we had all leaned on each other.



Now it was just me and Dad. And we were closer than ever after losing Mom. I knew that if I called him and told him I would be attending a party where the entire Bellavere family would be in attendance he would call in a wellness check because he would think I had gone insane.



Instead of calling him like I wanted to, I quietly grabbed the middle of the three dresses and donned it. My hair and make up was already done. And I was ready to put on some beautiful armor and hope it was enough to prevent any bleeding.



\*\*\*



Kayla and I pulled up to the Governor's mansion in the back of a town car that had been sent to our homes to pick us up.



I was squeezing her hand so hard that she was attempting to hide her wincing, but failing.



The driver got out and came around to open my door and I squeezed harder.



She squeaked, ""Ellie, for the love of god! You look gorgeous, you are a successful therapist. You have a great life that you have built for yourself. Do not let this douchebag cause this! You are stronger than this screw it!"" And then she pinched the back of my hand hard enough for me to yank it away and pushed me out of the car.



Turns out, it was exactly what I needed. I tilted my chin up and looked around, decidedly unimpressed by the 'home'. Kayla stood next to me, eyeing it up.



""Disgusting, isn't it?"" She said, nodding to the pond that had two swans, mates, swimming slowly around in it.



I nodded, ""I would expect nothing less of this family. Beautiful on the outside, but don't take too close of a look on the inside.""



She laughed as we started walking toward the front door. Other people were ambling in as well, and I was pleased to see that our dresses were appropriate for the occasion. There was absolutely no need to stand out at all. The more invisible I was, the better.



The party was going rather well. There was easy mingling during the cocktail hour. I stuck to one drink that I sipped at slowly and let Kayla do most of the talking, looking around for Shawnee. I wanted to give her a hug and see how happy she was for myself.



""Ladies and Gentlemen, please welcome the newly mated couple we are here to give blessings and wish all of the happiness in the universe to: Shawnee and Nico Bellavere!""



I looked toward the top of the marble staircase to see Shawnee and Nico walking down, arm in arm. Kayla was right. Shawnee looked not only happy, she looked radiant. And Nico looked just as happy, if not happier as he gazed at her every few seconds. Males were naturally protected over their mates and I could see it was a struggle for him to look away from her for a second, despite the risk of them tumbling down the stairs.



She caught my eye and I gave her a big smile. The smile she gave me back was huge. Happy. Excited. Like a woman who had gotten everything she had ever wished for. Something settled in my chest and I felt happy tears for her gathering into my eyes. It might not be what I wanted for myself, but I was ecstatic for my friend.



Once she and Nico had descended the stairs, I started to head toward them. The family traditionally stood in a line so everyone could go through and greet them. I wanted to get through the line quickly. My stomach was rumbling and Kayla and I had a pizza night with the silence of the lambs-my favorite movie-planned.



We did not eat while we watched. Obviously.



Kayla stood next to me in the line, eyeing the person standing beside his brother.



""What are you gonna do?"" She asked me, eyes forward, ""skip him?""



I smiled sardonically to myself, ""I'm going to give Shawnee a big hug, wish Nico and her all of the happiness in the world, and get an important phone call that will mysteriously pull me away before I have to greet the other half of the line.""



Kayla snorted, ""nice.""



And then we both smiled as we greeted Shawnee's mother, the first in the line.



We made it to Shawnee quickly and I wrapped her in my arms to whisper in her ear.



""Happy?""



I felt her smile against my cheek, ""yes. I hope that you will find the same when you find your mate.""



Raising my eyebrow at her as I pulled away, I said, ""I could never.""



She knew my stance on mating. She was teasing me.



She winked as I turned toward Nico.



""Congratulations, Nico! I wish you both all of the health and happiness in the world."" I started fishing in my clutch, ""oh I must have a-""



I was cut off by the sound of a breaking glass and automatically turned toward the sound only to make eye contact with the man I had been ignoring all night. The man I had refused to acknowledge existed and was now my best friend's brother in law.



Renzo. His eyes were dark and I felt a sharp tug in my heart, as everything but his face blurred around me.



""...what??"" The word was a whisper out of my mouth.



""Mate."" The word was a declaration out of his.



My body knew before my mind did. As I slowly started coming to the realization of what was happening, one thing was clear. This wasn't fate. This was a cage. My world had changed yet again at the hands of Renzo fu-cking Bellavere.



I feel the pull toward him. My eyes won't stop looking at him, meeting his eyes. And I'm disgusted. And horrified. I can feel my lip curling and my hands shaking with barely restrained rage.



How dare this happen to me?



Kayla's hand is on my arm.



""Ellie?.....Noelle?..."" she's trying to get my attention. I force my eyes off of him.



Her face is shocked. But I see it. The pity in her eyes. She doesn't even bother to contain it. I'm mated to a monster.



There's been a rumbling happening around us and I realize it's applause. Everyone around us is clapping. For this.



Kayla and Shawnee suddenly surround me and pull me into a hug, bright smiles on their faces.



In my ear, I hear Kayla's urgent voice, ""you must go with him, Ellie. You can't turn this into a spectacle for the cameras or for Shawnee.""



I bite my tongue so hard I taste blood. If it wasn't for Shawnee I would turn this into the biggest spectacle in years. I would end up in the fu-cking history textbooks.



Instead I nod and squeeze them both hard before briskly turning to Renzo. My mate. What a joke.



I force myself not to meet his gaze. I feel the tie between us. It's pulsing. It sits right in my heart. And it urges me to go to him. He holds out his hand, waiting for me to take it.



I bite my tongue again.



But I walk over and place my hand in his, smiling softly at the crowd around us. It's all I can muster.



My breath stutters when our hinds wind together. It's traitorous. Automatic. Shame hits hard.



His hand is warm and mine feels like ice. I hate that the mate bond feels satisfied with the touch, no longer pulsating, but humming.



As he starts to walk, guiding me to a room on the side of the ballroom, I dig my nails as hard as I can into the back of his hand. He huffs loud enough for me to hear it.



As soon as the door is closed behind us, my back is up against it and his nose is in my neck.



My hands come up and I shove his chest so hard I end up pushing myself into the door hard enough that the fancy molding on it digs into my back painfully. Pushing him did not move him an inch.



""Fu-ck. You smell good."" It's the first time I've heard his voice since high school.



""Get. Off. Me."" My voice is strong and firm and doesn't shake.



He peels himself back enough to look me in the eye. There's a confusion in them that makes me roll my eyes as I push at his chest again and walk over to the desk in the study, sitting in the ornate chair behind the desk.



""Well. This is going to be a big problem,"" I say, folding my hands and placing them on the desktop.



His eyes land on my face and I can see it. That look that males give their mates.



It makes me grit my teeth.



""Stop."" I say it quietly but my voice is hard as steel.



His eyes find mine again, ""stop what?""



The anger I've been feeling boils over.



""Do you ruin people's lives so often you don't recognize them?""



His eyebrows pull together.



""Ruin people's lives? No. Ruin your life? I'll admit I did that, Ellie."" There's no apology on his face, no remorse. Just an open acknowledgement.



I smile snidely.



""So why do you think that I'm going to accept this mating then?""

I’m new to reddit and this is my first post. I need all the help I can get.

I am a 28 year old female who is healthy. I usually workout 6 days a week doing weight lifting and cardio. My resting heart rate is usually 65-70. 

October 30th, 2025 I contracted some illness. It felt like cold symptoms, and my husband had it too. For my husband it was respiratory and for me, it was a sore throat and feeling fatigued with malaise and a slight cough. I had some chest congestion for a while. I started to feel better until November 4th at night, I started getting a sore throat and headache. I woke up November 5th, 2025 (2 months ago), with a heart rate of 130 and a tight chest with dizziness. After about 20 min, it went away. My resting heart rate was around 100 and it felt like my heart was beating out of my chest for a couple hours after. This happened again the next day and I went to the ER. Long story short for the heart problems, I had 100 ddimer and no tropinin in my system. I saw a cardiologist, wore a heart monitor for 3 days and did an echo with several EKGs. He said my heart is “perfect” and prescribed me propranolol and gave a diagnosis of sinus tachychardia. My symptoms were primarily in the morning by the way. Its when i wake up. 

I saw a pcp, he checked my thyroid and all levels were normal. He checked for hashimotos and it was negative. Several other things I don’t remember, but everything was normal. Then a couple days later, i woke up and felt like I had pins and needles and was on fire on my arms and legs with a rapid heart rate. This happened for two hours before I went to the ER and my bp was 178/130. This went down after some time and the symptoms resolved on their own. 

A week later, I developed nausea. The heart symptoms subsided, but the nausea was prominent. I have never thrown up. I ate low fat because we speculated it was my gallbladder. This helped the nausea but it took time for my stomach to subside. I did a HIDA scan and my symptoms were all reproduce and I had an ejection fraction rate of 37%. This was considered borderline normal, and the irregular EF rate is 35%. I spoke to a gi and surgeon, they ordered an abdominal ct with contrast. They found nothing. I did an endoscopy, they found nothing. So I got my gallbladder removed. 

Today I am two weeks post op. I took hydrocodone the first three days. I ate better than I was presurgery and thought i was cured. When I came off the hydrocodone, my heart beat extremely hard and was resting at 100bpm. No nausea at all so far. I thought this was coming off the drugs and just having surgery. Day 5 post op i became adventurous and ate 5 mcdonalds chicken nuggets with some fries. I became nauseous 2 hours later and severely nauseous the next day. Im talking 8/10 pain but no vomiting. I contacted my surgeon, he ordered an abdominal ct which was normal. He prescribed promethazine and thats helpful, but it makes me drowsy. I was having bile acid diarrhea and intense burning in my abdomen. My nausea subsided then came back but still had burning, this is all on and off. My pcp has me do a uti test at home. It was slightly positive and he put me on an antibiotic that can make you nauseous, and honestly i think it does that to me. I started colesevelem and that has helped dramatically with the burning in my abdomen, and I don’t have diarrhea anymore. Im slowly getting better since starting the colesevalem, but i still get burning if I eat a banana oddly enough. Milk or protein shakes make me instantly nauseous. When my stomach is empty, i am also nauseous. This seems to be the most common denominator. I am also on a proton pump inhibitor and have been for over a week. But the main symptom right now is feeling burning when i dont take colesevalem and difficulty eating with an early feeling of being full. Im also extremely fatigued, but im still 2 weeks post op.

My surgeon said i was a zebra and a unicorn. He referred me to a gi whom im having difficulty getting into. 

This has been one of the most emotionally exhausting things i have gone through. The constant on and off nausea, an inability to eat normally. I have been eating no fat, coffee, alcohol since November 11th. Ive lost 20lbs and im already a thin person. Im not sure if this is from a virus or a disease that progressed. Now im thinking gallbladder was only a part of the picture. Its like I woke up with this. If anyone knows of anyone who has been through something similar, I would love help and direction. Or even just community because this is so isolating. ",1,1767815405.0,AskHealth,0,1.0,False

* **Do you use an agency to manage your AirBnb?** (If Yes, what made you decide to use an agency?)
* **What do agencies do that you wish you could easily handle yourself?**
* **What’s the most frustrating part of self-managing an Airbnb?**



If you’re based in Islamabad/Rawalpindi, I’d be happy to meet for a cup of chai or coffee. I’m also open to a short Google Meet chat if that’s easier, feel free to DM me your availability.

Alright, I thought. Let her have it.

I popped open her router admin panel. Default password: *admin123*. The SSID was ""PrettyFlyForAWiFi"". I ran a `nmap`scan. 12 exposed ports, 3 outdated IoT devices, and a printer running telnet. No firewall. No VLANs. Just raw digital nudity.

I offered to segment the network and install pfSense. She said she “just wanted Spotify to stop cutting out.”

I airgapped her Sonos out of pity.

After 20 minutes of work, I asked for her phone to remove TikTok and clean the app permissions. She said “but I need it for filters.”  
I looked into the distance. Deep sigh. I looked out the window and whispered, *""The panopticon isn’t metaphorical.""*  
She asked if I was always this intense.  
I said no, only when the NSA is listening. Which is always.

She offered coffee. I declined, caffeine raises your attack surface.

When I left, she said, “Thanks, you’re like, really good with computers.”

Kellan caught my wrist. “Alyssa, you’re not busy right now. You should start getting used to taking care of a kid.” A cold laugh slipped out. “Kellan, I might not be brilliant, but I’m not insane. Why would I take care of a child that belongs to you and your mistress?”

Chapter 1

The day before our wedding, a storm broke loose inside my fiancé, Kellan. He’d drowned himself in liquor, and as I drove us home, the world outside smeared into streaks of color.

Drunk and disoriented, he turned toward me—eyes unfocused, voice thick—completely mistaking who I was.

“Serena… don’t bring the kid to the ceremony tomorrow. I’m his father. Don’t let Alyssa Franklin find out,” he mumbled, the words spilling out like coins rolling across a table.

The instant his confession hit me, my foot slammed down on the brake. The car shrieked to a stop. Kellan pitched forward, his forehead striking the seatback. The jolt snapped him awake just long enough for recognition to flicker across his face.

But instead of panic, he went quiet—too quiet. After a long breath, he spoke again, each word as deliberate as a nail hammered into wood.

“You heard me. So… we should postpone the wedding. Don’t worry. Serena doesn’t want to marry me. The kid is mine, and I need to take responsibility.”

The calmness in his voice chilled me more than the confession itself. Then came the part that hollowed me out completely: “She’s your best friend. You must feel bad watching her raise a child alone. Once the kid starts school, I’ll come back and marry you.”

A laugh scraped out of my throat. “…Sure. Sounds great.” My voice was poison wrapped in silk.

When we reached home, he didn’t say a word. He simply dragged his suitcase out the door and vanished, leaving silence in his wake. I wiped my tears and collapsed onto the bed, feeling like I’d slipped into someone else’s nightmare.

Then my phone buzzed.

“Aly, don’t marry him… please.”

My childhood sweetheart’s voice—urgent, pleading—cut through the darkness.

I hesitated, swallowed hard, and finally whispered, “Okay.”

My gaze drifted over the room I had decorated for our big day—flowers, candles, ribbons, a hundred little dreams arranged with perfect care. Now it all felt like mockery, a stage set for a play that had never belonged to me.

I had chased Kellan for two years through the corridors of our university. We had been together for three more. Tomorrow was supposed to mark our beginning. Instead, it marked the moment I learned he had slept with my best friend three years ago… and their son was already two.

The betrayal carved through me—his, hers—two blades twisting from opposite sides.

I pressed my lips together, refusing to let tears fall. I needed to breathe. To move. To get out.

But the universe was not done humiliating me.

My phone rang again.

“Alyssa, Serena’s busy feeding the kid. I haven’t eaten either. Bring us dinner.”

Kellan’s tone held the same casual authority one might use to order a cup of coffee. Before I could react, the call ended.

A laugh—sharp, humorless—escaped me.

For three years, I had stood by Serena’s side as she raised her son. I’d been there from her first trimester until his second birthday. I was the dedicated best friend, the loyal godmother, the one who filled in every gap without complaint.

Whenever she brushed off questions about the father, I felt sorry for her. I never imagined the man sneaking out of her life was the same one climbing into bed with me.

I’d always thought Serena was the naive one. But the truth was crueler: I had been the fool.

Little moments clicked into place—her plunging tops, her “accidental” touches around him, the way she laughed too loudly at his jokes. I’d brought my concerns to Kellan once.

“Serena is your friend. I’m your man. If you can’t trust the two of us, who can you trust?” he’d said, brushing it off.

And I’d believed him.

A bitter smile curved my lips.

I ordered dinner from the worst-rated restaurant on the app, plated the sad, wilted food, and carried it to Serena’s apartment—morbidly curious to see how the golden boy of our campus handled fatherhood now that he’d been caught.

I rang the doorbell. A wave of dizziness hit me.

When Serena opened the door, she stood in a tight skirt, cheeks flushed, eyes bright with a glow I recognized all too well.

My heart iced over.

She didn’t even flinch. She pulled me inside with practiced sweetness.

“Aly, sit down. Kellan’s helping Leland wash up. You should’ve seen them earlier—father and son, just bonding.”

Kellan. She said it so easily. So proudly.

Father and son. Nothing hidden anymore.

I sank into a chair, numb.

Moments later, Kellan emerged holding their child. Instinct made me smile at my godson.

But today, he didn’t toddle into my arms. Instead, he pointed at me—so innocent, so unaware—and chirped: “Homewrecker.”

The word struck like a slap, final and merciless.

Chapter 2

My smile stiffened, frozen in sheer disbelief.

A two-year-old—barely old enough to form a proper sentence—was pointing straight at me, his tiny face set in fierce condemnation.

“Homewrecker.”

The word cut through the room, sharp and surreal.

Serena flicked a startled, embarrassed glance in my direction before turning quickly to the child, her tone firm but indulgent.

“Leland Brooks Vance, watch your language. She’s your godmother. You know how much she loves you.”

Kellan moved at once, cupping the boy’s ears, irritation and concern warring across his face. “Serena, don’t be so hard on him. He’s just a kid. He doesn’t know what he’s saying.”

His voice softened as he added casually, “Besides, Alyssa is my wife. She won’t take it personally.”

I sat there like an intruder in someone else’s home, a guest who had overstayed without realizing it. A bitter laugh clawed at my throat but never quite escaped.

His wife. The phrase echoed in my head, grotesque and mocking, as if it were laughing at me for still existing.

And how did a two-year-old even know a word like that?

Leland Brooks Vance. The name settled heavily in my chest, and at last, I understood exactly what it meant—and what I was to this family.

Kellan, blissfully oblivious to the wreckage unfolding, acted as though everything were perfectly normal. He even reached out, as if to pass the child into my arms.

I flinched back instinctively. “That’s enough. I should go.”

He caught my wrist, his grip gentle but unyielding. “Alyssa, you’re not busy right now. You should start getting used to taking care of a kid.”

A cold laugh slipped out. “Kellan, I might not be brilliant, but I’m not insane. Why would I take care of a child that belongs to you and your mistress? If the three of you don’t find me unbearable, then at least allow me the courtesy of finding all of you intolerable.”

Sensing the tension spiking, Serena stepped forward with a bright, practiced smile that made my stomach turn.

“Aly, you know my views on marriage. It’s never been my thing. The baby was an accident. If he makes you uncomfortable, I can transfer custody to you. It doesn’t have to affect anything between you and Kellan.”

As she spoke, she nudged Kellan playfully, her chest brushing his arm in a way that felt far too deliberate.

“You should take Alyssa home,” she continued lightly. “It’s been two years. I’m used to raising him on my own. When Alyssa decides she’s ready to be a mother, we can handle the adoption paperwork.”

Right on cue, Leland began to wail in Kellan’s arms, his small body trembling as the room filled with his cries.

Kellan panicked instantly, patting his back, murmuring frantic reassurances, wiping away tears as if sheer effort alone could fix everything.

Once the boy finally calmed, he handed him back to Serena. Then he turned on me, anger flashing in his eyes.

“Alyssa, enough. Because of you, that child has never had a father. And now you want to tear us apart?”

“You’ve been the one taking care of him all this time. He’s attached to you. You’d better keep looking after him—otherwise, don’t even think about marrying me.”

My breath snagged, the weight of his arrogance pressing down until I could barely stand it. I turned sharply, urgency clawing at my chest as I headed for the door.

Because of me… the child had no father?

I stumbled down the stairs, desperate for air, desperate to escape the suffocating mess he’d created and wrapped around my throat. I threw open the car door, ready to drive until the world behind me disappeared.

Before I could slam it shut, Kellan’s hand wedged itself between the frame and the door.

He frowned deeply, frustration and self-pity etched into his features. “Alyssa, I wanted to tell you when Serena got pregnant. I never meant to hide it from you.”

Then came the excuse that made my stomach turn.

“But she’s your best friend. I figured since she never planned on getting married, once the baby was born and she didn’t want to raise him, she’d hand the kid over to you.”

I stared at him, stunned, my vision swimming. “Too bad you slipped up,” I said, my voice shaking. “Maybe I would’ve raised her child. But I will never raise your mistress’s child.”

Instead of remorse, his mouth curled into a cold, mocking smile.

“You’re the Franklin heiress. With that kind of status, you can’t even deal with something this small? Serena grew up with nothing, and she’s still stronger than you.”

His words hit like a punch straight to the ribs. My nose burned, tears threatening to spill, and I clenched my jaw to keep myself steady.

“I can’t argue with you,” I whispered. “And I don’t want to anymore.”

Before I could pull away, he yanked me out of the seat and locked me in his arms.

“Enough. Stop crying. I said I’d make it up to you. Just… not now.”

A hollow, broken laugh tore from me. I shoved him back with everything I had, creating distance like my life depended on it.

I turned my face away, my thoughts spiraling into a painful blur, and finally murmured, “Forget it. Let’s end this.”

Chapter 3

Tears streamed down my cheeks, pouring faster than I could wipe them away, my sobs breaking loose in ragged, uncontrollable waves. I could barely breathe through the grief choking me.

Kellan froze, his expression twisting from shock to irritation and then—unnervingly—to something like concern. He stepped closer, cupping my face as if offering some priceless comfort.

“Alyssa,” he murmured, voice soft in a way he rarely used, “I’ll come back every few days. I’ll spend time with you, and then I’ll take care of the child. Isn’t that enough?”

His proposal hung between us—absurd, insulting, surreal.

I didn’t answer. I couldn’t.

He let out a frustrated sigh, heavy and pointed. “Alyssa, this is the best arrangement I can think of. Can you please stop being so unreasonable?”

I dragged in a shaky breath, forcing down the sobs still clawing at my chest. Slowly, painfully, I steadied myself. “Don’t bother,” I whispered. “Just thinking about it exhausts me.”

“We’re already broken up. Your only responsibility is to her and the kid. Whatever happens to me is none of your business.”

Then his hands clamped down on my shoulders, rough enough to make me flinch. “Alyssa, are you really doing this?”

I refused to answer. I slipped out of his grasp, slid into the car, and reached for the door—

Only for him to shove me hard.

“So that’s it?” he snapped. “You finally dropped the act? This spoiled-princess tantrum is the real you, huh?”

My head slammed against the car frame, a burst of pain flashing white-hot behind my eyes. The world tilted as I steadied myself.

Kellan didn’t apologize. He didn’t even hesitate. He just turned away, something dark gleaming in his eyes.

That was when Serena appeared—storming over with theatrical indignation. “Kellan, stop it! Aly is the daughter of a prominent family. Of course she has a temper. You’re a man, aren’t you? Can’t you show a little understanding?”

He barked out a laugh, cold and dismissive, before sliding an arm around her waist—a gesture that sliced right through me. “Why should I? I’m human too. She chased after me first. And now she thinks she can give me attitude?”

He shot me a look of disgust before turning back to Serena with a softness that made me want to retch.

“You’re the best. So gentle. So reasonable. If Alyssa were the one pregnant, with her temper? She’d be raising hell. Just thinking about it annoys me.”

The sight of them together—his hand on her waist, her head tilted toward him—was unbearable.

I tore my gaze away, climbed into the car, and drove, even though my hands were shaking so hard I could barely grip the wheel.

...

Halfway down the road, a searing pain spread across my chest, squeezing every breath. My phone rang, slicing through the silence like a blade.

Kellan’s mother.

“Aly, I heard. Kellan canceled the wedding. This is his fault—he lied to us too. Please don’t blame yourself.” Her tone was earnest, coaxing. “Listen, the child was an accident. We can register him under your name. If Kellan truly cares about you, this doesn’t have to ruin your marriage.”

I blinked through the tears blurring my vision.

“And Serena agreed not to fight us on anything. You’re meant to marry Kellan. Worst-case scenario, I’ll raise the child myself so he won’t interfere with your life.”

My throat closed. It took all my strength to speak. “Mrs. Vance… Kellan and I already broke up.”

The transformation in her voice was instant—sharp, cutting. “I knew it. People from wealthy families are impossible. I was against this relationship from the start. I knew my son would lose his dignity with someone like you.”

I squeezed the steering wheel until my knuckles whitened.

“He made a mistake all men make, and he owned up to it. And you still refuse to forgive him?”

“It’s fine, Mrs. Vance,” I said, my voice trembling but steady. “Your son has all the dignity he wants now. he and Serena suit each other. I’m stepping aside. I won’t trouble them again.”

Before my control slipped, I ended the call.

My foot slammed on the brakes. The car lurched to a stop.

I gasped, trying to steady the avalanche of memories crashing over me.

Back then, to protect his fragile pride, I had abandoned my life of comfort—my home, my status—just to make him feel bigger. When he finally agreed to be with me, he still mocked me whenever he felt insecure, his words dripping with disdain.

And every time, I smiled. I swallowed it. I believed that if I played the part of the humble, selfless girlfriend long enough, he would learn to love me.

Then came the family gathering.

“I heard Kellan is dating a rich girl. Where is she? That one standing next to him? She looks poorer than all of us.”

“That can’t be her. No way. He must’ve lied to impress us.”

Their laughter echoed in my ears again, sharp and humiliating.

And Kellan’s expression—disgusted, embarrassed by me instead of them—burned into my mind like a brand.

...

I don’t know how long I sat there, numb and trembling, before I finally summoned the strength to drive home.

Chapter 4

Not long after, Kellan’s name lit up my screen, dragging me out of my thoughts.

“Wanna hang out? Serena just put the kid to bed,” he said, his tone maddeningly casual. Too casual.

For years, he’d never once taken me shopping, never carved out an afternoon for a simple date, never even pretended to prioritize me. And now—now—he wanted to “hang out”?

Was this some grand apology? A flicker of guilt? A pathetic attempt at stitching together the shreds of what we had been?

I almost hung up on him, already exhausted by the empty performance.

Then I heard it—Serena’s voice drifting through the background, soft and syrupy as she cooed to the baby.

“Still busy coaxing your little princess? Aren’t you tired? I’m exhausted.”

Her tone brushed right against mockery, and I could practically see her curled up on the couch, playing house, claiming a place in his life that used to be mine.

Kellan’s reply came quick, defensive but playful.

“Come give me a massage. It’s your fault, making me take care of the baby and you at the same time.”

Their laughter—warm, domestic, intimate—cut deeper than any accusation.

He returned to the phone just long enough to dismiss me.

“Forget it. We’ll hang out another time.”

Then he hung up.

Bitterness rose in me like bile.

If I had drawn a line back then… if I had refused to let Serena slither into the spaces between us… would everything be different now?

...

The next day, the inevitable became official: the wedding was canceled.

Kellan organized a class gathering, and I went—if only to bury whatever remained of us.

The moment I stepped inside, a weight settled over me. The chatter died the instant Serena walked in with her child. All eyes turned. Someone spoke up, tone too innocent to be anything but calculated.

“Serena, you already have a kid? When did you get married? None of us heard a thing.”

Another voice followed, sharper.

“Yeah—who’s the dad? Why isn’t he here? We want to meet him.”

Serena stiffened. Even she couldn’t mask her unease.

Kellan’s gaze flicked toward me, ice-cold, before he strode over and lifted the child from her arms.

“I’m the father,” he said, loud and firm.

A collective gasp swept through the room. Then every head turned to me.

Whispers slithered around us like venom.

“I heard Serena and Kellan were together first, but something happened and he got with Alyssa instead. If you do the math… the kid’s two.”

“So Alyssa was the mistress?”

My hands trembled. Shame, fury, disbelief—all of it surged through me like a firestorm.

I rose, needing air, needing space, needing anything but this suffocating circle of judgment.

But as I moved to step away, Serena slid her foot onto the hem of my dress.

I pitched forward—hard—crashing onto the floor as laughter erupted around me.

Pain exploded in my knees. The room spun.

“Is Alyssa kneeling to confess?” someone taunted. “Feeling guilty about being the mistress?”

Kellan didn’t refute it. Didn’t defend me.

He only looked down at me with raw disgust.

My teeth clenched. My gaze snapped to Serena, whose feigned innocence couldn’t hide the smug glint in her eyes.

The fury I had buried for years finally boiled over. I raised my hand to slap her, to finally, finally give her what she deserved—but Kellan moved first.

He slapped me.

Hard.

The crack echoed through the hall, silencing every laugh, every whisper.

Blood filled my mouth. My ears rang.

Slowly, deliberately, I lifted my head to meet his eyes.

Then I slapped him back—hard enough to sting my palm, hard enough to leave a mark he’d feel for days.

“Kellan, we’re done.”

I didn’t give him time to speak.

Didn’t give him a chance to twist the story one more time.

I covered my bruised cheek, straightened my spine, and walked out—each step firm, steady, unshakeable.

For the first time in years, I felt the ground beneath me belong to me.

I’ve been building **Promptivea**, a prompt-focused platform currently in development, and I wanted to share a new feature we’ve just added: **Explore – Community Prompts Gallery**.

The idea is simple and practical:

• Browse **real prompts shared by the community**  
• Filter by models like **ChatGPT, Gemini, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, Krea AI**  
• See how high-quality prompts are structured  
• Copy, analyze, and learn from them  
• Share your own prompts if you want

This page isn’t about “prompt magic” or hype. It’s designed for people who actually want to **understand why a prompt works**, not just paste something random and hope for the best.

We also added a **What’s New / Changelog** section so users can clearly see what’s evolving on the platform no hidden updates, no confusion.

The platform is **free during development**, and feedback genuinely helps shape where it goes next.

If you’re interested in prompt engineering, AI image/video generation, or just improving how you communicate with models, I’d appreciate you checking it out and sharing your thoughts.

Now I've tried a different type of beans but some coffee was left over even after measuring the beans 17.5 grams. I think it would been enough had I tapped the funnel a bit harder but I didn't want to do that. Am I missing something here? Logic dictates that 17.5 grand of beans should yield 17.5 grams of ground coffee, then why did I have some left over? Is it to do something with the roast type? ",2,1767814766.0,mokapot,1,1.0,False

\- We're both early 20s

\- Lebanese

\- She likes to run / did a half-marathon recently

\- Very curious person / likes to ask questions and talk deep on topics like world, economy, religion, etc.

\- Went to college together, she did business, now works for a big LLP

\- Likes to go to concerts (We went to Gov Ball with a few people once)

I’m newish to drinking coffee as a 45-year old who grew up Mormon. After trying a lot of types of coffee, I have found an affinity for espresso - I can drink it straight, or with milk, but my favorite is iced americanos with just a splash of oat milk and dash of real brown sugar. I can’t drink Starbucks anymore….its just not good, so I go to a local caffe for my fix, where the espresso tastes dark and rich (watered down as an Americano but still flavorful). Obviously an expensive habit.

Because my husband and family are still practicing Mormons and don’t drink coffee, I want an affordable and small appliance way to make iced americanos at home and I just bought an Aeropress. 

Can someone take pity on my ignorance and suggest a good coffee at the right roast and right grind size (I don’t have a grinder and not sure I want to buy one) that I can order online that will make an espresso style drink I can turn into an iced americano?

The past 3 years have been the absolute worst where I was getting insane heart palpitations, couldn't work out, could barely breathe, pain in my upper left back and a heaviness feeling in my sternum, upper chest and around my ribs. 

I couldn't work out, talk to people (this would cause my chest to get tight and my throat to tighten), be leading in meetings at work which was rough for a project manager, I couldn't drink coffee and weed was out of the question or why type of stimulant. 
 
I've managed to get it down to about 20 percent or so over the past few years doing peanut ball 20 mins, , then backpod 20 mins, then foam rolling 20 mins I also did massage, chiro, acu, and physio manual therapy I spent about 60k on this over the past few years.

This week I had a spontaneous recovery where I believe I've moved to about 60 to 80 percent recovered. I've been able to go back to the gym slowly, the pain in my back is now mild from severe, no breathing issues and this is all within one week after 6 years.

Not sure yet if this will last or if I'll get another major flair up but I plan to continue with the peanut, back pod and foam roller as an evening ritual a few times a week for maintenance.

https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/s/tvBpM7JsdS

Bought beans roasted 12/30. To try and eliminate one factor, had the roaster do an espresso grind to get me close to the right size.

\-Started with 18g, and had 46g yield in \~20 seconds from the time I pressed the button. Got up to low end of good pressure zone.

Figured too much yield, and grind size pretty good, so increased to 19g. Time was closer to 25s if you start when I pressed the button. (See video) Yield still a little over 2:1, and also still a little bitter. Obviously an improvement over 18g, and def much better than the other beans used in my last post.

I literally can’t fit one more grind in the basket without the edge cleaning tool scraping the top.

If I want to increase pressure and decrease yield, what can I do? The bitterness suggests coarser grind, but the yield says either finer grind or more coffee.

(Reference: 2023 All-Time #1 Fav Below)

# First: please vote

I’m building an **updated K-drama consensus list that will include shows released up to 31/12/2025**.

In the comments, please write **just ONE thing**:

**Your personal #1 K-drama of all time**  
(any year, as long as it aired **on or before 31/12/2025**)

* No lists
* No rankings
* Just the one you’d defend forever

Your answers will be used to create a **new 2025 consensus list**, using the same strict rules explained below.

# Why this post exists

This question comes up here all the time:

**Which K-dramas are truly consensus favorites — not just hyped or repeated by the same voices?**

To ground this discussion, I previously analysed a large recommendation thread and built a **baseline consensus list** using very strict rules.

Important:  
The list below is **not what you are voting on**.  
It is a **reference point**, showing what consensus looked like **up to 2023**.

# Methodology (simple and strict)

* **1 user = 1 vote per drama** If the same user mentions a title multiple times, it only counts once
* Mentions counted **anywhere in the thread** (top comments and replies)
* **Abbreviations and variants were aggregated**, for example: CLOY → Crash Landing on You 2521 / 25:21 → Twenty-Five Twenty-One Guardian → Goblin
* Only dramas with **at least 2 different users recommending them** were included

This approach measures **shared consensus**, not hype or repetition.

# Consensus K-Dramas (released up to 2023)

# Top consensus tier

* **My Mister** (23) Frequently described as life-changing, praised for quiet dignity, emotional restraint, and deeply human characters.
* **The Glory** (19) Often highlighted for its unflinching portrayal of trauma, justice, and long-term consequences.
* **Reply 1988** (16) Loved for nostalgia, community, and family warmth; many users describe it as feeling like real life.
* **Goblin** (16) Praised for its melancholic tone, themes of fate and loneliness, and iconic OST.
* **Crash Landing on You** (14) Frequently mentioned as a gateway drama, valued for emotional payoff and rewatchability.
* **Twinkling Watermelon** (12) Noted for its focus on family, youth, and generational healing beyond romance.
* **Hospital Playlist** (9) Valued for warmth, friendship, and slice-of-life comfort with minimal melodrama.

# Strong consensus

* **Moving** (8) Praised for blending action with emotional depth and parent–child relationships.
* **Flower of Evil** (8) Frequently cited for suspense, moral ambiguity, and strong performances.
* **Vincenzo** (8) Appreciated for balancing dark themes with humor and stylized storytelling.
* **Twenty-Five Twenty-One** (8) Mentioned for coming-of-age themes, bittersweet realism, and lasting emotional impact.
* **Mr. Sunshine** (7) Praised for cinematography, historical weight, and tragic restraint.
* **Stranger (Forest of Secrets)** (7) Valued for tight writing, ethical complexity, and procedural realism.
* **Our Beloved Summer** (7) Often described as emotionally grounded, intimate, and quietly reflective.

# Clear recurring recommendations

* **Coffee Prince** (6)
* **My Liberation Notes** (5)
* **Beyond Evil** (5)
* **Mouse** (5)
* **Kingdom** (5)
* **Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha** (4)
* **Move to Heaven** (4)
* **Moon Lovers: Scarlet Heart Ryeo** (4)
* **Descendants of the Sun** (4)

# Minimum consensus (still at least 2 users)

* **Signal** (3)
* **Prison Playbook** (3)
* **Navillera** (2)
* **Hotel Del Luna** (2)
* **Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok-joo** (2)
* **Oh My Venus** (2)
* **Misaeng: An Incomplete Life** (2)
* **Mother** (2)
* **Secret Love Affair** (2)
* **The Guest** (2)

# Final note

This list reflects **consensus up to 2023 only**.  
Your comments will be used to build a **new, updated consensus list covering releases up to 31/12/2025**.

Please comment with **one title only**.

Looking forward to seeing how the new consensus compares to the baseline.",4,1767813702.0,kdramas,13,1.0,False
1q6oucy,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheIronCouncil/comments/1q6oucy/the_nonverbal_moves_that_make_you_look_confident/,The Nonverbal Moves That Make You Look CONFIDENT AF: The Psychology Behind Body Language,"I spent months watching people in meetings, bars, interviews, and first dates, and honestly? The ones who seemed ""in charge"" weren't always the loudest or smartest. They just moved differently.

Sounds weird, but body language is doing way more heavy lifting than most people realise. I got obsessed with this after bombing a job interview where I had all the right answers but somehow still felt like I was begging for approval. Started diving into research from social psychologists, picking apart leadership studies, watching hours of charisma breakdowns on YouTube. Turns out there's actual science behind why some people just radiate authority without saying much.

The crazy part? Most of us are accidentally broadcasting ""follower"" signals all day long.

Your Body Is Always Talking

Amy Cuddy's research at Harvard showed that holding expansive postures for just two minutes increased testosterone and decreased cortisol; basically, your body chemistry shifts to match confident body language. It's not just faking it till you make it; you're literally rewiring your nervous system.

Stop collapsing inward. Leaders take up space unapologetically. Not in an obnoxious manspreading way, but they're not making themselves small either. Shoulders back, chin level, feet planted. When you're standing, distribute weight evenly instead of shifting or leaning. Sitting? Don't hunch over your phone like you're protecting state secrets.

I notice this everywhere now. Coffee shops, offices, parties. The person everyone gravitates toward is usually the one who looks most comfortable in their own skin, physically grounded.

Eye Contact Is Currency

This one makes people SO uncomfortable, but it's non-negotiable. Researchers found that maintaining eye contact 60 to 70% of the time while speaking and 70 to 80% while listening creates the optimal perception of confidence and trustworthiness.

Most people do the opposite; they hold eye contact when listening but dart away when speaking. That's a submission signal. Leaders do more eye contact when THEY'RE talking.

The trick? Look at one eye, not both. Sounds stupid, but it eliminates that weird, unfocused stare. And when you break eye contact, look to the side or down briefly, never up. Looking up reads as uncertainty or deference.

Practice this. It feels intense at first. You'll want to look away. Don't. The discomfort you feel is your brain rewiring itself.

Slow Everything Down

Vanessa Van Edwards analysed thousands of hours of TED talks for her book Cues and found that the most popular speakers used slower, more deliberate gestures. Rushed movements signal anxiety. Leaders move like they have all the time in the world because, on some level, they believe they do.

Walk slower. Talk slower. Even type slower in meetings. I'm serious about that last one; frantic typing during a Zoom call makes you look like a court stenographer, not a decision maker.

Before you speak, pause. Let silence exist without rushing to fill it. This is brutal if you're anxious, but incredibly powerful. That pause communicates ""I'm thinking, and my thoughts are worth waiting for.""

There's this concept from improv called ""emotional endowment"", where you assign importance to your actions through the speed and attention you give them. Leaders endow their movements with significance.

Control Your Hands

Open palms, visible hands, gestures that stay within your ""frame"" (roughly shoulder width). These all signal honesty and confidence. Hands hidden in pockets or fidgeting? Red flags for our primate brains that evolved to watch for concealed threats.

Steepling (fingertips together, palms apart) is particularly powerful for conveying expertise without words. Judges, executives, and professors do this constantly. But don't overuse it or you'll look like a Bond villain.

Avoid ""self-soothing"" gestures, touching your face, rubbing your neck, playing with your hair, and adjusting your clothes repeatedly. These broadcasts cause discomfort. I had a terrible habit of touching my ear when nervous. Had to actively replace it with just resting my hand on the table instead.

The app Orai is actually solid for practising this. It analyses your gestures and filler words during practice presentations. Kind of embarrassing to watch yourself back, but incredibly useful.

Strategic Stillness Beats Nervous Energy

Daniel Kahneman talks about this in “Thinking, Fast and Slow”, how we conflate activity with competence. But leaders don't constantly adjust, shift, or fidget. They're still.

Plant yourself. When you're listening, be genuinely still. No pen clicking, no foot tapping, no phone checking. This level of presence is rare enough that it makes you memorable.

I started doing this thing where I imagine my spine as a steel rod. Sounds corny but it works. Keeps me from that nervous swaying thing I used to do.

The Power of the Head Tilt (But Make It Calculated)

Slight head tilts while listening show engagement and curiosity, traits people love in leaders. But keep your head level when YOU'RE making a point. Tilting while speaking diminishes your authority.

Joe Navarro's “What Every Body Is Saying” breaks this down brilliantly. He's a former FBI agent who spent decades reading body language. The book covers everything from territorial displays to pacifying behaviors. His stuff on ""blocking behaviors"" (crossing arms, creating barriers) changed how I position myself in conversations.

BeFreed is an AI learning app built by Columbia alumni that turns books, research papers, and expert talks into personalized audio podcasts with adaptive learning plans. Type in what skills you want to build, like improving body language or social confidence, and it pulls from vetted sources to create content tailored to your depth preference, anywhere from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with real examples. 

The app includes a virtual coach you can chat with about specific struggles, like why you freeze up in group settings, and it adjusts your learning path based on that. The voice options are surprisingly addictive, there's even a smoky, sarcastic style that makes dense psychology research way more digestible during commutes. It's been helpful for actually internalizing the patterns behind confident communication instead of just reading about them once and forgetting.

Mirror Strategically, Don't Mimic

Subtle mirroring of someone's body language builds rapport, but you need to do it with a delay and selectively. Copy their energy level and general posture, not their exact movements. Direct mimicry reads as mockery or submission.

Lead the mirror instead. Confident people cause others to mirror THEM. If you're consistently calm and grounded, watch how the energy in the room starts matching yours.

Own Your Entrances and Exits

The primacy and recency effects mean people remember how you arrive and leave more than the middle. Don't skulk in late or scatter out early.

Enter deliberately. Make eye contact, acknowledge the room, and move to your spot with purpose. Leave the same way. Say your goodbye, shake hands if appropriate, then GO. Don't linger awkwardly or false-start your exit three times.

Your Baseline Matters More Than Performance

Here's what most ""body language tips"" miss: if you're generally anxious, stressed, or insecure, no amount of power posing will save you. People are incredibly good at detecting incongruence.

You need to actually build confidence through competence, self-knowledge, and putting yourself in uncomfortable situations repeatedly. The body language is just the physical manifestation of that inner work.

Ash is honestly a great app for working through the internal stuff. It's like having a pocket therapist who helps you identify the mental patterns making you shrink physically. Weirdly effective for social anxiety.

The most powerful nonverbal signal? Being genuinely comfortable with yourself. That's not a move you can fake, but everything else I've mentioned will help you get there faster.",1,1767813641.0,TheIronCouncil,0,1.0,False

Does she want me to ask her out?,"So, someone spilled the beans that I like her and wanted to ask her out.  Now before I went in to greet her, her girl friend was there and talking, but I had to cut it short because I had to go in there and fix something, without saying about who or what.  But her girlfriend almost knew about it.  She said ya if you for example tell someone you like someone, they'll go and tell everyone.

Anyway, when I got in there, I tried explaining to her that I didn't want that to get back to her.  But she seemed to play dumb?  She said ""oh you mean that guy?"" and I said ""I wasnt the one that told him"" and then it was clear she acknowledged the elephant in the room.

Now in the past, when I saw with her she seemed closed off and wouldn't say much.  But now she started talking her head off about her life.

She told she was really disappointed in having to see a film on the small screen and she wanted to see it in IMAX.  She kept going on about what a horrible experience it was.

Now I realize I should probably tell her I want to take her there right?  But I'm just uncertain.  I've done a movie date as a first ""date"" before and it didn't end well.  I think movie dates only worked with my ex before we became ""official"" because I took her out for coffee before that

Amazon is making some exciting strides in the world of artificial intelligence, and the latest announcements have technology enthusiasts buzzing. The company has unveiled a host of new features that are set to enhance user experiences across its product lineup, from Ring security devices to Fire TV, and even Alexa itself.

One of the standout developments is the launch of new features for Ring. As home security becomes increasingly important to many of us, Amazon is focusing on making these devices smarter and more integrated into our daily lives. This means better alerts, improved video quality, and more intuitive interactions, allowing users to feel more secure and connected to their homes.

The Fire TV experience is also getting a significant upgrade. With enhanced features, viewers can expect a more personalized and seamless streaming experience. This could mean smarter recommendations based on viewing habits and easier navigation across apps and channels. For those of us who spend our evenings binge-watching or catching up on the latest shows, this is a welcome change that could make our entertainment choices even more enjoyable.

Then there’s the introduction of Alexa and the suite of Alexa+ integrations. With Alexa continuing to evolve, this new platform aims to provide users with even more functionality. The new integrations with popular devices like Samsung TVs, BMW vehicles, Bosch coffee machines, and Oura rings are particularly exciting. Imagine controlling your coffee machine with a simple voice command or checking your health metrics through Alexa while you prepare for your day. These enhancements showcase how Amazon is working to make our lives easier and more connected.

Integrating Alexa into everyday devices not only streamlines tasks but also brings a level of convenience that many of us didn't know we needed. Whether you're adjusting your home's lighting, setting reminders, or checking the weather, the possibilities seem endless as these integrations grow.

As we look ahead, it's clear that Amazon is committed to harnessing the power of AI to improve its products and services. With each new feature and integration, they’re not just keeping pace with technological advancements; they’re pushing the envelope on what we can expect from smart technology in our homes and lives. The future looks bright for Amazon and its customers, and I can’t wait to see how these innovations continue to unfol",1,1767813058.0,AI_Tools_Guide,0,1.0,False
1q6okd5,https://www.reddit.com/r/parentsofmultiples/comments/1q6okd5/im_never_going_to_finally_recover_from_this/,“I’m never going to finally recover from this”,"My twins are now 11 months old, and I have officially been at home for a year. 
I wanted to make a post that I myself searched for the moment I found out I was pregnant with twins. Besides the obvious fears of carrying multiples, finances kept me up at night. I scoured this page for tips on how to be smart with money during this time. So I wanted to give some tips on what I’ve done in this department over the past year to help us. And if anyone else has advice to leave it for someone else who just discovered they are having multiples and scared how they can survive this!

For context, I am a hairstylist, and my husband works an office job with a decent salary, however this economy sucks, and my income did not match what daycare costs. I now work Saturdays for extra grocery cash basically. 

When I found out I was pregnant my fake nails came off, $50 every two weeks was not needed. Same with giving up waxing appointments. I set aside that in cash instead in an envelope in my night stand to save for later. 

We stowed away our fancy Neapresso machine, $40 on pods every 3 weeks was a luxury. We went back to our old coffee machine and got bulk coffee at Sam’s club. Saving anywhere we could on luxuries helped us not panic lol

While I was working, I saved all the cash I could spare. I wanted a cushion, that I did not have yet, for when I was not working. Any gift card I got for my birthday, or holidays, was saved for later. 

Facebook marketplace was and still is my best friend. Certain things I personally did  not need to buy new. Two cribs, perfect condition. Two dressers we refinished. Two owlet socks. Two rocking chairs. A twin pack and play. Two play tables. New unused expensive glass bottles. Everything I could find a deal on I got second hand. And then I could turn around and sell it again when it came time we were done. And that money went back to diapers or clothes. 

I wanted our registry to be used on things we absolutely needed new, clothes, hygiene items, diapers. If I could save and get it on my own cheaper I did. I also kept tags on a lot of bigger clothes, so if they sprouted and outgrew or didn’t get around to wearing, I could exchange for the next size up. 

For diapers, I tried a bunch of brands but for my boys the Target brand diapers work best for them and have been our favorite. But when I was pregnant I saw a lot on Target diaper sales. Anytime there was a “spend $100 get a $30 gift card” I did it, and used the gift card on another box of diapers. We also did diaper raffles at our baby shower, and stocked up that way. We would only open one box at a time of a size, so if they outgrew that size we could exchange the extras in our stock for the next size up. 11 months in and we still have two boxes left, and have not spent money on diapers since they have been born. 

We got a small deep freezer the week we found out it was twins. At the end of pregnancy I started meal prepping. Soups, chili, pasta, chicken. Anything I could freeze for later. If frozen pizza or chicken nuggets were on sale I’d grab some for the freezer. I made and frozen breakfast sandwiches. Anything to have mindless meals with newborns, and help keep our grocery bill down later on. Now we bulk buy meats at the start of the month, and keep grocery trips small buy only buying sides and necessities. 

Our boys came home from the nicu on formula. Once they were able to be off the expensive stuff, we switched to Sam’s Club brand Similac 360. Luckily our guys tolerated that great and have been fine on it this whole time. It comes to about $156 a month for formula at Sam’s. During pregnancy I saved cash, sold some big ticket items I had laying around not using, and kept that cash for formula. I work one day a week now and cash goes to the formula fund so we can not use our bills and grocery money on formula. 

We’ve said no to a lot of extra things this year, which is fine because the babies are small and it’s fine to sit things out. We take advantage of sales when we can and think of the future. And somehow this year has worked out. Obviously we miss some of the minor luxuries we gave up, but we know we’ll get back to those someday.

If you’ve made it this far, I hope these small tidbits can help ease someone’s mind just a little. It is doable. We thought “I think we can financially handle a baby now”, and then got two at once. A whole different ball game. You have around 8 months to prepare, and you can do it. I am a type A, list making prepper, and this stuff kept me up at night. 

If anyone has other hacks or tips to share please add! I myself am always looking for new ways to save some money!

And please, no judgment, we all want the best for our children, and I will give up whatever I have to for myself for them, and get whatever they need how I need to get it.",24,1767813047.0,parentsofmultiples,4,1.0,False
1q6ok3o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1q6ok3o/how_do_i_talk_to_my_girlfriend_about_her_eating/,How do I talk to my girlfriend about her eating habits without hurting her or sounding judgmental?,"I really need some serious advice and I hope I can explain this properly.

I have been dating my girlfriend for about five months now. In the beginning, I thought she was just a big foodie. She loves trying different restaurants and new food experiences. Whenever we went out to eat, she would order a lot of food, eat a little, and pack the rest to take home. At first it did not bother me and honestly felt normal.

Over time, this behavior has increased. Now whenever we go out, even for something small like a coffee date, she orders two or three different coffees along with desserts. When she comes to my place, I have noticed her taking food from our pantry or my cupboard and eating it without really saying anything. I do not have an issue with sharing food, that part is fine. What confuses me is that she takes food from me or my place but rarely shares her own food with me. The behavior sometimes reminds me of a greedy child, which makes me uncomfortable to even think about.

What worries me more is her health. She eats a lot but never seems to gain weight. She is very thin and her skin sometimes looks yellowish to me, almost like someone who is malnourished. This has made me start wondering if she might have some kind of eating disorder or unhealthy relationship with food. She comes from a financially stable family, so this is not about not being able to afford food.

I am really confused and concerned. I do not want to accuse her, judge her, or hurt her feelings. At the same time, I feel like this is becoming something I cannot just ignore anymore. I care about her and I want to handle this in a kind and respectful way.

How can I bring this up with her without making her feel attacked or embarrassed? How do I talk about my concerns in a way that focuses on care and not blame? Any advice would really help.",35,1767813034.0,Advice,29,0.92,False
1q6oipi,https://i.redd.it/hcyvym6v5zbg1.png,[Papo de coffee-nerd] Por que o café brasileiro tende a caramelo/castanha versus frutado/floral?,"Fala pessoal!

Meu primeiro post em 2026, aproveito para desejar um feliz ano novo para os membros do sub! Que a xícara de todos nós esteja sempre cheia com os líquidos mais incríveis do Brasil e do mundo!

Vou compartilhar nesse post algumas coisas que aprendi estudando sobre regiões de produção de café, e como elas influenciam no resultado sensorial que temos na xícara.

Pegue sua xícara e venha conversar com a gente!

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**O perfil sensorial dos cafés brasileiros** ***versus*** **outras regiões**

Os cafés do Brasil tendem a chocolate, caramelo, castanhas e frutas secas. Já os cafés da Colômbia, Panamá ou África com frequência vão mais para floral, cítrico e frutas.

Vejam que falei ""tendem"", inclusive já experimentei cafés brasileiros que deixam 70% dos gringos que já tomei no chinelo.

Mas é fato que os cafés brasileiros tendem a ser menos interessantes, sensorialmente falando. E isso não decorre apenas da torra ou do processamento. Inclusive eu tenho uma intuição de que torra ultra clara, com café brasileiro, tende a entregar uma xícara meio vazia e sem graça.

A maioria de nós coffee lovers sabemos que o motivo dessa diferença sensorial é o terroir e clima. Mas isso é apenas parte da história.

**Tempo entre florada e colheita**

Um fator pouco comentado é quanto tempo o grão leva para amadurecer no pé.

No Brasil, em média, o café leva algo entre 6 e 8 meses da florada até a colheita. Enquanto isso, na Colômbia esse ciclo costuma ir para 8 a 10 meses. Em regiões como Panamá e África, o tempo médio fica entre 9 a 11 meses.

O tempo de maturação é definido principalmente pelo clima: o metabolismo da planta é mais acelerado quando há temperaturas médias mais altas, menor altitude e noites menos frias. E vice-versa.

**No que o tempo de maturação da fruta influencia?**

Quando o amadurecimento é mais rápido, o grão tende a seguir rotas químicas mais simples. Na xícara isso costuma aparecer como corpo mais alto, acidez mais baixa e redonda e notas mais comuns (chocolate, caramelo, castanhas, frutas secas).

Enquanto isso, em regiões mais altas e frias, o desenvolvimento do fruto desacelera. O grão tem mais tempo para desenvolver maior volume e uma variedade mais ampla de compostos voláteis (não sei explicar kkk). Na xícara, isso entrega acidez mais viva, sensação de frescor e sabores mais definidos/complexos, muitas vezes puxando para cítrico, frutas frescas e floral.

No fim, não é que o Brasil não produza cafés complexos. Produz sim, e alguns são excelentes. O ""Marcos Antônio Campeão"" torrado pelo Acervo está no top3 cafés que tomei em 2025. Mas é fato que o clima e consequentemente o tempo de amadurecimento empurram o perfil para outro lugar.

**Existem outros fatores além do tempo de maturação?**

Sim, com certeza existem outros fatores. Mas isso vamos deixar para outros posts futuros.

Bora conversar?

1q6of0a,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1q6of0a/i_think_my_roommate_is_sleepwalking_now_shes_mad/,I think my roommate is sleepwalking. Now she’s mad I locked my door.,"I (24F) live with one roommate, “Jenna” (25F). We’ve been friends since college and moved in together about six months ago. Overall, things are fine. We split chores evenly, get along well, belong to the same social circles, work in similar fields, and usually spend time together without any tension. We’re close enough that moving in together felt like a natural next step, not a risk.

About two months ago, Jenna started “sleepwalking.”

The first time it happened, I didn’t think much of it. I woke up in the middle of the night to the sound of footsteps in the hallway. Our floors creak a lot, so I assumed she was just going to the bathroom or to the kitchen for water. I stayed in bed and waited for the noise to pass.

A few nights later, it happened again. Except this time, the footsteps stopped right outside my bedroom door. I remember lying there, half-asleep, waiting for them to move on. They didn’t.

Eventually, I opened my door and saw her standing directly in front of it. She wasn’t reaching for the handle or looking around. She was just standing there, facing my door like she’d been waiting.

I asked if she needed something. She didn’t respond. Her eyes were open, but unfocused, like she was looking through me instead of at me.

After a few seconds, she turned around and walked back to her room without saying a word.

The next morning, I brought it up casually. She looked genuinely confused and said she didn’t remember getting up at all. Then she laughed it off and told me she’s always been a sleepwalker, especially when she’s stressed. I didn’t have any reason not to believe her. It was strange, but it didn’t feel threatening.

Since then, it’s been happening a few times a week.

What started to bother me was the consistency. She doesn’t wander the apartment. She doesn’t go into the kitchen or the bathroom. She always stops outside my door.

Sometimes she stays there for only a few seconds. Other times, it feels like minutes. I’ve tried pretending to be asleep. I’ve tried clearing my throat or shifting in bed. Nothing changes until she decides to leave.

I finally told her it was making me uncomfortable. I asked if she could see a doctor or at least close her door at night so she wouldn’t wander. She got defensive and said I was being unfair, that sleepwalking isn’t something she can control, and that I shouldn’t be making her feel bad about a medical issue.

Last night was different.

I woke up around 3 a.m. and immediately knew she was there. She was closer than usual, so close I could see the shadow of her feet under the doorframe. I could hear her breathing on the other side.

I didn’t open the door this time. My heart was already racing. Instead, I asked quietly, through the door, “Jenna, are you awake?”

She answered immediately.

“Yes.”

There was no hesitation. No grogginess. Just a calm, clear response.

I froze. I asked her why she was standing there.

She said, “You weren’t supposed to hear me yet.”

I told her to go back to her room or I’d call someone. My voice was shaking by then. She didn’t respond right away. She just stood there silently for a moment that felt too long.

Then she walked away.

This morning, she acted completely normal. She made coffee, talked about work, and asked if I wanted to hang out later. When I confronted her, she swore she’d been asleep all night. She accused me of trying to control her behavior and said that insisting she did things she couldn’t remember was gaslighting her.

I told her I was going to install a lock on my door.

She got upset and said that makes her feel accused and unsafe, and that I’m treating her like a threat instead of a roommate with a medical condition. She hasn’t spoken to me since.

I honestly don’t know what to think anymore. I’m exhausted, I’m second-guessing my own memory, and I dread going to sleep.

All I know is that tonight, I’m locking my door and I’m scared of how she’ll react when she notices.",17,1767812734.0,nosleep,4,1.0,False

I got mine last year in May and I regret it since then. Niche was my first choice. I've made an order, but was told that there could be a 25% tariff charged by DHL so I didn't proceed. Ended up with timemore after doing some research. But oh man, my coffee station is such a mess everyday with it. I've tried wi/wo RDT and there wasn't big difference. I've tried different beans as well. 

A few things I hate about it :

\- **The hot start**. The beans would jump outside of the container while grinding so you need to keep the lid on. But the hot start requires you to pour beans after the machine is running... so every time it's a rush for me to pour beans. Sometimes when there are beans stuck in the container that I have to open it to push them down while it's running.. not fun. 

\- **Rotary knocker.** It's a selling point but so unnecessary in my opinion. I don't know how bad other machines with fines since this one is my first ""fancy-ish"" one. But even with the rotation there are still fines stuck there, I have to brush it after using the knocker. It just adds more steps in my workflow.

\- **The catch cup**: it's so easy to get fines stick inside the cup, sometimes it's a lot. I'm not sure if that's because of static electricity or the oil from the beans.  It seems completely random. Sometimes all the grind just get out smoothly, sometimes a thick layer stick inside the cup and it's hard to get them out. 

\- **The mess**: the fines fly all over the places. Yes, I tried RDT. I tried spray slightly different amount of water. The results are the same. 



The grinding is great, consistency is great, but the workflow is so bad makes me hate it. I didn't get chance to try many different machines so I don't have comparison on if other grinders are significantly better. It sucks because it's a niche thing and it's not cheap, hard for me to sell. So I decide to stick with it and suffer.

I have just returned from a week ""vacation"". I was visiting family, during which I had to help remodel my mother's kitchen, help my sister set up her home office, and find time for my father's birthday, my anniversary, and my step sisters birthday too. It was jam packed and exhausting especially because my family parties hard and works hard. And then to top it off, my adult son was sick the entire time and I caught it the last two days. 

So yesterday I went back to work and I'm feeling completely depleted. I'm not sick but I feel like I had no recovery, my mind and body are struggling. My sister offers me her Adderall and I take it figuring it'll get me through the day, because it's 9am and I'm 3 coffees in and I feel NOTHING but pure exhaustion. 

So I get to work and I'm functioning it's going well. Then my husband showed up with a key bump. So to be clear, we don't usually ever partake, but we were partying with my family and my step sister bought a bunch for her party and we had leftovers to bring home. He figured I'd need it because I was so exhausted, so I did it. 

And I went and kicked so much ass. I finished all my work, even my week long absence pile of work, before lunch. I organized the office, cleaned up, I got started on the rest of my week. I got bored and reorganized our important phone numbers list even researching to see if any changed or had different departments now (some did, so it was good I checked). 

Then I went home and fell asleep at 7pm and didn't budge until this morning. 

I'm feeling like crap still but I come in expecting an easy day since I handled everything yesterday. But NO.

[€150],"I've wanted an espresso machine for a while, but I don't have much money. I currently use a very old Krups machine with a 51 mm percolator, but I don't know if you can call it an espresso machine: it doesn't have a pump, it's just a tank that heats up, builds up pressure, and pushes the water through the coffee. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it's basically a mocha pot in disguise. And to be honest, the coffee isn't great.

Anyway, the most I was willing to spend on my first machine was around €150, but I found this Dedica for 10 bucks. At that price, I can't complain, as long as it works.

I've read a lot about this machine here, with some people saying it's complete crap and others saying it's not bad for beginners. I'm not sure what to think.

I was also thinking of buying a bottomless portafilter, but some people here say it's useless because the Dedica doesn't have enough pressure. Is that true?

So I'm looking for a grinder. What would you recommend? Again, I don't have a lot of money, so I'm looking for the cheapest possible option that's still good quality.",1,1767812155.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

Here’s how we can fix it (with visuals),"I walk to the park and nearby shops along Glenwood Ave, and I’ve had way too many close calls with cars turning in fast and almost hitting me, especially at park crossings and shopping center entrances. It’s honestly stressful.

This isn’t really about bad drivers, it’s about street design.

So I put together some quick visual mockups showing what these crossings could look like, based on pedestrian-safety designs that are common in the Netherlands and already being used in a lot of U.S. cities:

* Raised crosswalks (speed tables) so drivers physically slow down
* Curb bump-outs / daylighting to shorten crossing distance and improve sightlines
* Tighter turning corners so cars can’t swing through at speed
* ADA-compliant, pedestrian-first design
* No changes to the park itself

## Before / after visuals here:

• CVS shopping center entrance

These kinds of changes slow cars **without blocking traffic**, reduce crashes, and make crossings a lot safer for kids, seniors, and anyone walking. They’re also relatively inexpensive and can be tested with paint and temporary materials before anything permanent is built.

If you:

* walk to the park
* cross Glenwood regularly
* have kids, pets, or older family members
* or just don’t want to feel like you’re playing Frogger to get coffee

…this probably affects you too.

I’m planning to bring this to the town’s planning and engineering departments, and public support really matters.

What do you think?
Would you support safer crossings here?
Are there other spots along Glenwood that feel sketchy?

Hey Maximizeme fam! Ever feel like you're juggling a thousand things, and somehow, joy feels just out of reach, while stress is always knocking? We've all been there. But what if I told you there are actual ""cheat codes"" to navigating this wild ride?

It's not about some magical overnight fix. It's about smart, actionable strategies that, when woven together, can seriously upgrade your experience of life. Think of it as fine-tuning your personal operating system.

Here are a few things that have been game-changers for me, and maybe they'll resonate with you too:

*   **Micro-Moments of Joy:** We often chase the big wins, but the real magic is in the everyday. That first sip of coffee, a quick walk in nature, a genuine laugh with a friend. Actively seeking and *savoring* these tiny pockets of happiness can shift your entire mood.
*   **Strategic ""No"" Power:** This one's huge. Learning to politely decline things that drain your energy or don't align with your goals isn't selfish, it's self-preservation. It frees up space for what truly matters.
*   **The Power of ""Done"" Over ""Perfect"":** Perfectionism is a notorious stress inducer. Aiming for ""good enough"" and moving forward often leads to better results and less anxiety than getting stuck in an endless loop of refinement.
*   **Movement as Medicine:** Doesn't have to be a marathon. A brisk walk, some stretching, dancing to your favorite song – getting your body moving is a phenomenal stress reliever and mood booster.
*   **Mindful Breathing Breaks:** Seriously, just 60 seconds of deep, intentional breathing can interrupt the stress cycle. Keep it simple, keep it frequent.

These aren't earth-shattering secrets, but consistently applying them can feel like unlocking hidden levels. It's about building resilience, finding more peace, and actually *feeling* the joy you deserve.

Sometimes, though, the weight of it all can feel overwhelming, and finding that inner calm is a real challenge. If you're ever feeling swamped and need some extra support navigating those tough emotional waters, I've found [this resource (affiliate link)](https://praneetbrar.com/digistore24/make-my-plan/#aff=maximizeme) to be incredibly helpful. It offers practical tools and guidance that can make a real difference.

I am a local Fibre artist who loves knitting, spinning yarn and sewing.  I am also an introvert, but am realizing that I would love to have more of a community in the Fibre Arts.

I am looking to start a a meet up, either at a library/coffee shop/pub etc.  I know there is one at Theoretically Brewing and another at the Crossings Branch at the Library, but I haven't had a ton of luck with either. I want it to be a safe place for anyone wanting to knit, crochet, spin yarn. Or interested in learning to do so from others. I am queer and I know that the Fibre Arts community can lean a little to the not-so-accepting side at times and want a space to feel comfortable and accepted.

I have a couple questions:
-is there any interest out there from folks? I'm thinking about either evenings or weekends. 
-if so is there preferences to locations?
-if there are already groups like this out there let me know! 

Feel free to PM me if you're interested as I would love to talk about this!

Let’s be real for a second finishing a Master’s or a PhD is an incredible achievement. You’ve spent years mastering complex research and theory.

But then you hit the job market, and it feels like a slap in the face. You’re told you’re ""overqualified"" for entry-level jobs, yet you don't have the ""practical experience"" for the roles that actually match your degree. It’s a frustrating loop that makes you feel like you’re stuck in no-man's-land.

I’ve been looking into how we can actually break this cycle without dropping our studies or starting from the very bottom as a ""coffee runner.""

I just put together a guide on how to pivot into the digital industry (things like SEO, Social Media Strategy, and Automation) using a ""training-first"" approach. The idea is to build a professional career that actually matches the level of your degree.

**Here’s what I found works best for postgrads:**

* **Real Skills, Not Busy Work:** Instead of admin tasks, focus on high-level skills like Website Analysis and Digital Strategy.
* **Skip the ""Interview Anxiety"":** Look for programs that value your potential and ability to learn rather than just your past resume.
* **Balance is Key:** Finding work that fits around a demanding thesis or research schedule so you don't burn out.

If you’re feeling stuck between the world of academia and a real career, I hope this roadmap gives you some clarity. You've done the hard work in university—now it's time to make it pay off

Some nights, I wonder if it ever really gives me back.



I tell myself I'm fine. Everyone dreams. Everyone forgets. But lately, it feels like I leave pieces of myself behind when I wake up—tiny, invisible fragments that never return. The mornings are heavier now. The air tastes strange, like something burned in the night and no one [noticed.My](http://noticed.My) apartment looks the same, mostly. Coffee stains, a crooked clock, the quiet hum of a city that doesn't care whether I slept or not. But sometimes... sometimes I swear I see fingerprints on the inside of the window.I've been noticing a strange pattern in my sleep. One moment I'm sitting on my bed, and the next I'm waking up in an entirely different one—only this time, I haven't actually woken up. I don't know how I know I'm sleeping; I just do.





My apartment looks the same, mostly. Coffee stains, a crooked clock, the hum of the city outside. Yet somehow, it feels foreign, like I've never been to this corner before. I reach for my mug. The stain under it has moved, just a little. I frown. That wasn't there before.The shadows in the corners seem to stretch when I move, lagging behind me. My eyes dart to the clock—its ticks are uneven, dragging some seconds and rushing others. I tell myself it's nothing, that I'm just tired.I glance at the mirror. My reflection lingers a heartbeat too long, then moves, as if it were thinking for itself. And all of a sudden I'm thrown back to my grim reality, covered in cold sweat and skin crawling with anxiety.These dreams are always blurry; I can never see anything clearly, no matter how hard I try. You know that feeling when someone's chasing you in a dream, but you can't run fast enough? That's exactly how it feels.





I sit up slowly, letting my feet touch the cold floor. The apartment smells faintly of rain and... something else I can't name. My heart is still hammering, and my palms are slick. I glance around, half-expecting the shadows to twitch again, but everything seems... normal. Too normal. I try to shake it off, telling myself it's just a dream. But the unease clings, like a whisper at the edge of hearing, reminding me that the night isn't done with me yet. My feet lead me to the bathroom, and I perform my daily routine—practiced, precise, meticulous. Everything is familiar, but the mirror seems to hold a trace of last night's dream, just at the edge of perception. After I get ready, I sit down in my 1980 Chevrolet and drive off to work.



The engine hums beneath me, familiar and steady, yet something feels... wrong. The streetlights flicker in a rhythm that doesn't match the car, and a figure on the sidewalk freezes mid-step as I pass, then continues as if nothing happened. I shake my head, blaming fatigue, yet the uneasy sensation curls in my stomach. Even the world outside seems to be holding its breath, waiting. As soon as I reach my office building, I'm met with sorry glances all around. Even Martha—the woman who usually seemed to despise me—is offering condolences. But... for what? My pulse quickens as a sinking feeling spreads through me. I make a beeline for my desk and stop short. A bouquet of flowers sits waiting, bright and out of place amid the drab office.





""Hey, Patrick,"" I mutter, voice tighter than I intend, ""what's going on here?""""Adrian... your father..."" A colleague hesitates, eyes glistening. ""He... he was in a car accident this morning. I'm so sorry.""The words hang in the air like a weight I can't lift. My chest tightens, my hands shake, and the world blurs slightly around the edges, as if reality itself is unsure I belong here.And the worst part? I was driving that damn car.

1q6nx4y,https://www.reddit.com/r/Malliem/comments/1q6nx4y/flowers/,Flowers.,"My boyfriend, Harvey, has always been overprotective.

Whenever we were in public, he insisted on coming with me to the store. 

That day, we drove past a local flower shop, with daffodils and daisies already in bloom. I couldn’t resist. The roses caught my eye, bright red, bleeding across the stall. I pressed my face to the window. “Can we stop here?” I asked.

“Flowers?” Harvey raised an eyebrow. “Why?”

“Because they’re cute.”

Reluctantly, Harvey pulled the car over, clearly disapproving. “If you’re so obsessed with decorating, we can swing by Home Depot on the way home.”

“Relax!” I laughed, jumping out. “Dude, I'm fine. I’ll be back in ten minutes.” 

I didn't wait for his response, walking into the flower shop. 

I found myself standing in front of the roses and daffodils. 

I picked one up and immediately pricked my thumb on a thorn. We had daffodils by our house, but every time I tried to pick them, my boyfriend stopped me. 

I would only get as far as kneeling beside them. I ran my fingers along their stems and gently prodded the soil, before he would pull me back inside, stick my dirty fingers under the faucet, and wash them. 

Harvey didn't let me keep daffodils in our garden.

Or roses. 

Or daisies. 

I had to watch our poor garden sprout weeds. 

He wouldn't even let me cut them away, their choking vines spreading like a disease. 

“Rose?”

The male voice startled me, and I twisted to see a man about my age. His accent caught me off guard. British. Mid-twenties. College graduate, maybe. 

Hidden beneath thick blond curls, he stood out next to the daffodils. 

The spring temperatures were still cold, yet he was dressed for summer: short-sleeves and jeans.I found myself transfixed by the bright yellow ink bleeding across his skin: a daffodil, its stem winding around his fingers. 

The man’s smile was sad as he plucked a rose from the stall. 

I was surprised at how nimble his fingers were, able to perfectly balance the rose between thorns without getting stung. 

“It’s nice to see you again.” 

The man pulled me into a hug, and I stiffened, frozen in his arms. 

He sniffled into my shoulder, and I realized I knew his touch. 

Something ice cold writhed down my spine. I knew the sensation of his arms around me. 

I knew his shuddery breath tickling the back of my neck. “I didn’t think you’d come back here,"" he whispered. ""But I had a feeling you’d find your way to us.”

I staggered away from him, my cheeks scalding. 

“What?” I hissed. “What are you talking about?” 

I managed to gather myself, trying to ignore my nerve endings on fire; my brain screaming at me. 

I *did* know him.  

I knew his slightly gruff voice, his laugh, which always went high pitched. 

His smile, when I made him laugh. 

I shook it all away. 

“I.. I think you're mistaken—”

The man’s expression dampened, tears glistening in his eyes. 

“You…” he ran his fingers through his hair, swiping at his nose. “Fucking hell, babe, you don't know who I am, do you?” 

Instead of responding, I moved back, my legs wobbling. 

The door to the flower shop flew open, a melody jingling.

Footsteps. 

Running footsteps pounding against the wooden floor. 

“Oh my god, *Rose*!” 

A tiny girl with orange pigtails practically dived into my arms. Also my age. 

Overalls covered in daisies, and a daisy inked across her wrist. She burst into tears, and my body jerked against her. “I never thought I'd seen you again!” 

I knew her too. I knew her hugs. 

Her sweet smelling hair. 

I found my voice. “I don't understand.” 

Instead of speaking, the girl ripped down my sleeve. 

Revealing a beautiful rose inked under my elbow.

But I'd never seen it before.

Harvey always covered my eyes when I was changing. 

He insisted on long-sleeves in the middle of summer. 

Bandaged my arms when I wasn't even hurt. 

“Rose,” the girl whispered. “Don't you remember us?” 

She pulled me into a tight hug. “A bad man took you three years ago. We searched everywhere, but it was like… you’d vanished.” The guy grabbed my hand, squeezing tight. “We’re going.” He whispered. 

“Before he can take you away again.” 

Somehow, I let the two of them drag me outside. Because I knew their touch. I knew they were safe.

I never knew Harvey. 

He never made sense! 

He *hated* flowers! 

I knew them.

Daffodil, and Daisy. 

They were my *friends*. 

Daffodil gently helped me into his car.

Daisy jumped into the front seat.

“Get rid of your phone,” Daffodil whispered. “In case he tracks you.” 

I nodded, pulling out my phone, a text from my boyfriend lighting up the notifications. 

Harvey: I'm sorry to be over protective. I'm not allowed to say much.  A psychopath took you away. You and two others. He renamed you  after flowers. Branded three of you. *Brainwashed* you. The others were never found, but I found *you*. I never gave up.

And I'm *never* letting you go again. 

…

Another text lit up the screen, as my eyes grew heavy.

Harvey: I've got you coffee.  Where are you? 

“Rose?” 

Daffodil’s voice filled my ears as my body tipped into the window. 

My phone slipped out of my hands, my lungs starved of oxygen.

In the back of my mind, a room bloomed into view. 

Concrete walls overflowing with flowers. Chains bit into my bloody ankles. 

A warm head rested on my shoulder, and a voice whispered for me to never forget his true name. His shuddery breaths against my skin. *“I’m Luke,”* the voice splintered into a sob, echoing. *“Don't let me forget.”*

With numb hands, I tried the car door.

Locked. 

“Don't worry, Rose,” Daffodil hummed. He shot me a grin. 

Daisy burst into giggles.

I started with a Delonghi Magnifica S Smart Bean to Cup machine four years ago, but only in the last year with Freshly Roasted beans, then two Ninja Luxe Café Pro's,, which were so inconsistent that I ended up walking away and doubling my budget and opting for the Meraki.

The Meraki has CoffeeSense, an RFID reader on the brew tower which reads RFID tags on the bags of participating roasters, like Origin Coffee and Bella Barista, so far, hopefully more in the future. There are others in Germany and the USA.

CoffeeSense sets the Grind Weight, Water Temperature and Shot Weight, along with a Grind Size suggestion. This almost, but not quite eliminated Dial In, because it got close, in some cases very close.

I got to the stage of realising, though, some of the inconsistency we experience is due to not knowing if the coffee 'Blend' we are using, has the ratio the Roaster would want us to have.

Think of it this way, a Roaster has a three origin blend, 33.3% from each origin, now you have a bag of Skittles or Smarties with only three colours. Pour a handful of Skittles or Smarties on your worktop, will you have an equal amount of the three colours, highly unlikely, such is the case with Coffee Blends, we might have a Ratio 50%-40%-10% one day, the 25%-31%-44% the next, fundamentally changing the flavour profile of the blend because we can't guarantee which beans will come out the bag at any one dose.

Do we create our own blends by buying single origin Roast's and blend ourselves on a single shot basis to the ratio we want. Might be the most consistent option.

With that in mind, I've created a simple Spreadsheet with the Roaster and their offerings that I've purchased, so far, and what their Roast Level is and finally the location of the grower, only by country so far, not altitude or farm.

I hope you find it useful.

For reference, I’m 19 (turning 20 soon), and I sometimes get made fun of for wearing flip-flops, so I’m curious how common that actually is.

What do you think about other guys wearing flip-flops or sandals in everyday situations? For example:

* At someone’s house party
* Running errands (grocery store, coffee shop, etc.)
* Casual hangouts with friends
* Just being out in public during summer

Do you see it as totally normal, situational, or something that’s looked down on? Are there certain settings where it feels inappropriate, or does it really not matter to you?

1q6nt80,https://www.reddit.com/r/SW_Senate_Campaign/comments/1q6nt80/albert_progressiveconservative_5_customer/,Albert | Progressive-Conservative | #5 | Customer Appreciation Day,"Another day, another pound. That was how Bill would view it anyway, and he honestly didn't mind it were it not for the circumstances.

He stood near one of the checkout aisles, scanning the store around him, assessing it. How long had he been working here for? Ah, right, he remembered now, since he and his family moved to Ultaar some two months ago.

It was a bit strange, sure. But one couldn't exactly say no either.

Sure, Ultaar had some challenging terrain to say the least, and it was definitely nothing like Coruscant. However, Coruscant was a cesspool that wasn't going to improve much. Granted, when his Dad told him that he was to go and get a job, he half expected he'd be working on those mountain farms the Ultaarians had set up.

Instead, after sending out his job application to what he thought was a warehouse company, he found himself here.

A Courtesy Clerk for SageHyperLane, ""Hyperjumping ingredients to you!""

Now, working here over these past couple of months, he'd grown to find some enjoyment out of it. And also annoyances.

The good part was his fellow employees.

Looking to his left, he saw near the self-checkout B'zgal. He was the typical Ultaarian: tall, rotund, and surprisingly soft spoken, but dutiful. However, unlike some Holopics, the relationship between him and B'zgal was cordial. They sometimes didn't see one another; the shifts kept changing, and as they kept changing, it meant that certain coworkers you hadn't seen were nowhere to be found.

And other times, certain coworkers you wished you hadn't seen before were there.

He hoped, deep down, that his coworker Catherine, an older lady who was surprisingly one of the few humans native to the world, wouldn't be here. She was a massive-

His train of thought stopped when he looked at the clock. It was 9:00 AM.

He'd been here for around thirty minutes and had, as expected, done his rounds. He'd gone outside and put away the last of the carts inside the store, and he had put away some of the returns and had made sure the baskets had gone back to their pens.

The layout of the story was nothing complicated, albeit it was based on a fusion between the Corulagi-Ultaarian design philosophy. Rather than one floor, there were two floors, with a thick slant leading up to the second floor to emulate the slope of a mountain.

The bottom floor was where one could find: The coffee, cereal, soda-pop, cleaning supplies, tea, paper plates, cooking utensils, bakery, eggs, coffee creamer, milk, eggnog, non-alcoholic beverages, and the back room, where some of the produce and meats were stored away.

Speaking of produce and meats, that is where the second floor came into play. Once you climbed up the stairs or escalators, you found yourself in the produce and meat section. Why were they on the top floor?

Honestly, he didn't know.

He'd asked the store manager, Greta, about the issue, but she was just as confused. She was originally from Corulag and therefore had next to no knowledge of how the hell it worked when it came to Ultaarians and their strange fascination for slopes.

But if someone like B'zgal liked it, then it had to be good, right?

Well, no matter.

That's where the meat and produce section was; laid out in neat rows and islands of freezers and wood alike. Separated by an invisible boundary, demarcated by signs.

Now, as for his other co-workers, there were many, some of whom he'd forgotten the names of because they didn't matter much. Of the two mentioned, they were cashiers: Catherine and B'zgal. But there were another four he knew off-hand.

There was the head cashier and essentially the actual boss of the store, Gabe. He was a cool dude, pretty old in comparison, but for a Bothan, he was very calm and practical. He'd emigrated to Bortele due to the benefits involved with the job and the decent enough weather.

Currently, he was busy taking care of a customer at the Customer Service Counter, a tight space that was 10ft long and just 4ft in width, but allowed for just enough room to conduct business behind. It appeared that the said customer was having an issue with a couple of bags of salt he'd purchased to help deal with the build-up of snow on his driveway, and judging by the fact that he was also a human, he likely didn't know about Ultaar's very unpleasant weather.

Passing the duo was his other co-worker, the produce clerk, Steve.

Steve was the one man with whom he got along like a house on fire. Always enthusiastic, always down to earth, and when a Courtesy Clerk couldn't do his job, he did. Officially, though, his position was as a produce clerk, the man who went upstairs and dealt with the vegetables. Making sure everything was stocked and presented to the customer to purchase.

He was looking, as ever, quite pleased; his thick red beard having revealed a smile beneath it as he took his long strides along, greeting B'zgal, who hobbled around and responded in kind with a thump on his chest.

That is, until a loud ""beep-beep"" emanated from the self-checkout, and he waddled over to deal with the issue at till No. 4.

""You good, Bill?""

Bill looked behind him and blushed slightly. He was nineteen years old, and when the first thing you see is a particularly attractive woman, it's hard not feel a little odd. But at the same-time, there was...an alien nature to describe his colleague.

Henja was a Twi'lek, as she explained, and until he'd met her, he had no idea what a Twi'lek was. He'd heard the stories, of course. Very attractive women with two tentacles that came out of their heads and went down to their backs. Always slim, always with a cute face, and unfortunately, with a history of being enslaved by the Hutts.

From the little he and she had spoken of her past, Henja was originally a slave of the Hutts on Bimmisarj, but had gotten off lucky as just a serving girl.

She'd moved to Ultaar after Bimmisarj was liberated by the Imperials, and so had a thick accent but had a good grasp of basic.

""I'm alright,"" he said, clearing his throat. ""Although I'm not looking forward to the following hours... have you ever heard of the saying: the calm before the storm?""

""No?"" She quirked her eyebrow, tapping her fingers rhythmically on the countertop. ""But it does sound...hm...ominous.""

""It's supposed to be...basically: before the shit hits the fan.""

""Oh...that bad, huh? Well, you mind indulging a sweet girl like me and explain why?"" She leaned forward, smiling and earning a glance away. The uniforms they wore were, as a rule, all-covering. They could either be short or long-sleeved dark blue shirts, with their name tags shown through holographic pins attached to them.

Though it was strictly on a first-name basis to not reveal their surnames.

But, while everyone else looked relatively normal, Henja wasn't afraid to let it squeeze around her torso just a little. It annoyed Gabe, but Gabe didn't say a word about it because it didn't cause issues, and she still wore a shirt beneath her uniform. Same as Bill, really.

Once he had gotten his composure back, he replied, ""Customer Appreciation Day.""

She blinked, and then sighed when the realization dawned on her. ""Shit...do we get bonuses?""

""Fortunately, we do. It's an extra 5 pounds an hour every Customer Appreciation Day. So it's gonna suck for me...but well, I do get paid pretty decently. Better than the minimum of 11 an hour.""

""Yeah...and don't forget the tips.""

Bill glowered, ""It was one time. Besides, the elderly have a thing for being very old-fashioned. Plus, it was just one pound.""

""One pound, twenty pounds, five hundred pounds..."" Her sarcastic tone did annoy him just a bit, but he could see the humour behind it. She meant nothing against him, just seeking to poke and prod a little.

By now, though, her attention shifted away as a customer approached her aisle; the number above, No. 2, blinked to life. That, Bill knew, was his cue.

Straightening himself up, he walked away from the aisle; the rhythmic ""beep"" of one item after another being checked, and the habitual: ""Did you have a good day?"" ""Did you find what you needed?"" or ""Were you satisfied?"" rang on behind him.

He walked down past the twelve aisles of tills, heading for the right entrance. One of its doors, which read in bold white letters: OUT, was opened. As per protocol, it was the one way out of the door...even though there were two doors. A bit weird, but he didn't mind it.

What he minded was what he found. Stepping into the lobby, he looked to his right.

And frowned.

All of the carts: gone.

All of them.

He took a deep breath in. ""Fuck.""

\---

Gabe was assessing the situation as a whole. According to his calculations, upon the opening of the store, they would begin to see a small influx of individuals numbering around 20 people. This influx would slowly grow over the next two hours.

Now, the store opened at 7:00 AM, and at its peak during this initial influx, it'd be 9:00 AM.

What he did not anticipate was that by 9:30 AM, all of the carts on the right side of the building would be gone. He growled, low and intimidating to some, but a sign from those who were familiar with him of a man who could see that the situation could become problematic.

For god knows what reason, there could only be one courtesy clerk per shift. He had Bill till 3:00, and his shift had started at 8:30. By the time his shift was nearing its end, he'd be dealing with burnout and exhaustion, and thus, efficiency would be ruined.

So he made the logical decision.

Grabbing the intercom phone, he tapped a couple of keys and said, ""Geiser, come to customer service; Geiser to customer service."" His voice had echoed across the whole of the intercom system, and he knew well that the Produce clerk would be there in a jiffy.

Good, now to the next issue.

He could hear the number of customers; his sharp senses detected some 100 customers and counting were here. For now, the Ultaarian natives were busy milling about, utterly curious at the products on display from the rest of the galaxy, while others were buying a mix of native and foreign products. The prices differed, but only by 1 pound or 35 pence.

The customers who were checking out numbered just six, but in the next ten minutes, it'd grow. Henja was already dealing with just four of the six customers, and B'zgal was assisting her with packing, leaving self checkout wide open.

He took his business phone, looked through his contacts, and found: Jibby and Dorli. He sent a text to both, and the message was the same: ""Extra shift offered, 10:30-2:30, need you ASAP should you accept.""

He got his response just a minute later; Jibby was willing and was already on the way, but Dorli was sick. That was one man down, but he needed two cashiers. And it wouldn't be until 10:30 when the other three cashiers arrived: Jane, Catherine, and Dib.

So he went around the corner, went over to Till 4, tapped a few keys on the computer, and the till's light went up.

With a press of his thumb on the intercom button, ""Till 4 is open, till 4 is open.""

\---

Just another three more carts to go. That was what Bill told himself as he pushed his four carts up the hill, past the moving traffic that cut in front of the store, and hoped that it'd work out. If it weren't for the anti-grav pads on the carts, he'd be unable to push them at all.

But as he slowly trundled up the hill, and the doors leading inside slid aside, he looked and saw.

One cart.

He grimaced.

""God fucking damnit...""

\---

There was something utterly fascinating to Gordie with this store. He'd just...never seen anything like it. Trundling along beside his mother and father, he looked around at all the strange things on display. Chips, candy, soda...it all looked so odd.

Though when he grabbed one of the items, his mother was quick to put it back on the shelf. Some of it wasn't the best for an Ultaarian.

But much of it was; there were a few who he'd never seen before, like: Cracker Ingi's, Cheezit, Rim crackers, Spacefish, Dr. Shepherd, Colie-Colana. It all caught his attention.

With each aisle they passed, some new items were put into the weird metal contraption called a ""cart."" He'd seen enough carts to know that with the number of holes it had, it was simply impractical.

Yet, it didn't bother him.

It worked, somehow.

Somehow in some way.

They were by this point in Aisle 10, and as he looked around, curious as ever, he saw an item that truly caught his eye.

A smile beamed across his face, and he ran over to it as quickly as his stubby legs could allow him. Coming to a halt, his smile remained as he took the bi-pedal toy up. ""Optimus Supremus"" was written at the bottom of its cardboard box container.

The top said: ""Galactic Constructors!""

""Protecting the galaxy is our charge.""

""Constructors, Build the future!""

Gordie's eyes seemed like they were about to pop open, and turning, he jumped up and down. ""Can we keep it, can we keep it?!""

\---

One item after another was checked out. And as each one was being put into their bags or boxes, or whatever the customers had, it meant more money for the store and easily attainable products for the customers. According to Gabe, he had managed to check out some thirty-three customers.

Good, that meant up to 1,000 Pounds alone from his Till. Possibly extra once he counted the currency notes.

But as he finished checking out a large pack of Salmon, he saw the final item. He quirked his eyebrow. It was one of the toys down on Aisle 10, the complimentary toy aisle. Blinking, he checked it out, the name ""Constructors"" meaning little to him and his pragmatism.

\---

The right lobby was filled enough, the left was too. But no matter how many carts he brought in, no matter the amount of baskets he put away, and no matter how many bags he packed. Bill could see it did not end. It seemed that the natives, upon learning of these new-fangled ""Grocery stores,"" decided to check them out. En masse.

Of course, his Ultaarian co-workers were quite pleased about it, and he hadn't been alone. Gabe had been ""kind"" enough to call over Geiser, who had come with him outside and aided in his expedition of retrieving every single cart that this store had and putting them back into the store.

Now, he looked at his watch. It was 2:50.

With a sigh, Bill, who was standing in front of the ever-busy Tills, with every number lit up from 1-12, and the self-checkout choked with activity, turned to Gabe, who was standing behind the customer service counter, reviewing some shipment notes and scheduling for the employees.

""I'm punching out Gabe...see you tomorrow.""

Gabe nodded. ""See you tomorrow. Do you remember your shift?""

""Yeah...10-2. I'll be there.""

""Good. Then, good-day Bill."" As Bill walked away, Gabe's ears flicked. According to Bill, he'd been tipped some 100 pounds.

He'd note that for later.

**TLDR: Due to the connections and infrastructure established between the Imperial League and the Imperial State of Bortele, Bortele is now starting to see an influx of wealth, investments, and business into its region. This, therefore, has led to a boom in their economy, as with new jobs on offer, unemployed Bortelians can now get decently paying jobs.**

**It is also a showcase of the Imperial League, bringing behind it not just protection, but also wealth and prosperity with the worlds that join it.**

**You may also have noticed the multi-cultural background of the stores.**

**It isn't just Ultaarians, but also humans, Twi'leks who'd been freed by the Imperials, Bothans, and many other species who are a part of the Republic or freed by the Republic who have been given this chance to start afresh.**

**Be they immigrants like Bill, who came from the poorest levels of Coruscant to Henja, a freed slave who is now able to choose her life and her work.**

**Commodities once thought of as impossible to attain are now on the shelves at reasonable prices, many now entering production in Bortele, depending on the world's climate and resources.**

**This includes things like plastic toys, soda pop, chips, candy, and other items of interest.**

**Unfortunately...Karens will be an issue. Yes...them.**

1q6ns4x,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1q6ns4x/rf_endure/,[RF] Endure,"7 am. At his local gym, Max was pushing through a heavy workout.  
“People are so fucking lazy. It's easy to be ahead of the ninety-nine per cent. You just have to work harder.” The manly voice on the podcast reasoned with confidence.  
“Alright, two more sets of squats, then bench, row, cold shower, and off to work.”  
A year had passed since Max started his first paid job, and he was grinding hard. It took him eighteen months of unpaid internships and contributions to open-source projects to decorate his CV enough and finally land a paid position. He was grateful for this opportunity and wanted to prove how great he could become.

9 am. At the office, in a small meeting room, his team of five sat around a rectangular glass table. On the purple and blue walls, written in a handwritten font, were displayed the company’s values: “Excellence, Grit, Passion, Innovation, Teamwork”.  
At his turn, Max stood up and lied.  
“No blocker on my side. Everything will be ready for Monday.”  
He knew it meant working late all week and the whole weekend, but he was the kind of guy who delivers. “Fake it till you become it,” he reminded himself.

10 pm, one quiet evening in his shared flat, near Finsbury Park. The weekly mandatory all-hands was scheduled to accommodate higher management who were working from the US West Coast. Headset on, locked on fixing a bug, Max was half-listening to the CEO's speech.  
“Team, these times have been rough. But don't worry, this is temporary. We need to double down together. Just a bit longer. Our customers are expecting these awesome new features we promised. We need to endure this crunch.”  
Every word landed like a punch on his desk.  
“Trust me,” the voice continued, “in a few weeks, we'll relax back to our regular workload.”  
How long had it been since “a regular workload”? Max didn't remember his last free weekend.  
A reminder for the fishing trip he booked with his dad popped up. He'll have to postpone again.  
“Hands up and chin down,” Max remembered from a motivational video, “the only way is forward.”

2 pm. Some time near the end of Winter. The meeting room had no windows, only unpainted, concrete walls. Salaries and raises were confidential to “avoid breeding envy and resentment in the team,” HR said. Max's manager, Bill, was a short, middle-aged man with a coffee mug permanently grafted to his left hand, and way too many grey hairs for his age.  
“Thus, I am going to grade you as meet-expectations,” Bill concluded.  
Max flinched in disbelief. “But, I went way beyond expectations! I helped other teams on two projects and, just this quarter, added three features outside the ones assigned.”  
“Yeah, but that's what we expect here. We are a highly competitive company. Most of your colleagues have delivered similarly.”  
The young man clenched his jaw. He knew it was a lie.  
“So, I am not getting a bonus or a raise then?”  
“You need to reach exceed-expectations for that. Any other questions?” Bill answered with a tone that expected none.  
“How do I reach exceed-expectations then? Could you define it clearly?”  
“The wording speaks for itself!” Bill erupted, visibly irritated, “Now, send me Samantha.”  
At his desk, Max looked at his Spotify playlist. Next on was “Why losers quit early, and winners endure.”

6 pm. Was it already September? An unusual meeting with two sales guys. The taller one, George, talked with a thick northern accent. Both smelled of cigarettes and coffee, and wore wrinkles and bags under their eyes like badges of honour.  
“You promised them an MVP in two weeks?” Max exploded, “This will take us months! And that's not counting our other priorities.”  
George's tone was friendly and apologetic, “Howay, man, don’t be so mardy. One o’ our biggest customers wanted to churn. He heard t’ competitor had t’ feature ready. We dun’t want ’em churnin’. Logo’s on t’ website. I’m sure ye’ll sort it oot.”  
George came closer and put his hand on Max's shoulder.  
“Let me tell ye a wee secret,” he whispered. His tone changed. “This year’s numbers are not as high as last year's. We’re still making good money, but shareholders do not like it when our numbers stay flat. The big boss mentioned ‘other ways’ to bring it up. You don’t want your team mixed up in these… other ways, right?”  
Max was sweating.  
George relaxed and threw a friendly slap on Max’s shoulder.  
“Just a wee crunch, lad. Only a few weeks to endure.”

6 am. For the first time in years, Max snoozed his alarm clock. Exhausted, out of breath, his entire body ached.  
“I'll skip the gym for today. I need more rest. One more hour.”  
10 am. Still lying in bed, gazing at the ceiling, he found enough strength to reach for his phone. Slack notifications were piling up. He opened the app.  
8 am, Bill: “I need a complete revamp of your plan on the MTD project, before midday.”  
8:30 am, Bill: “What's the ETA for the MVP on the SO project? We told the customer it would be ready next week.”  
9:05 am, Bill: “Where are you? We are starting the scrum without you.”  
9:20 am, Bill: “Max! I need your daily report. Where are you?”  
9:40 am, Bill: “I hope you have a good reason to be late!”  
9:50 am, Bill: “What do I tell the customer about your ETA? I need an answer!”  
Max closed the app. A hundred-kilo dumbbell was sitting on his chest. He opened the phone app and scrolled for his GP’s number.

Blind closed, the room was dark. Sitting at his desk, Max peered at his laptop. His GP flickered on the screen.  
“It's not just a burnout,” the GP began, “you tick many boxes in the depression diagnosis.”  
The concerned voice sounded so far away.  
“I am giving you a two-week medical leave. Let me know if you need more, OK?”  
Max nodded.

An hour later, in his shower, Max mechanically reached for the cold water tap.  
“For a three-hour dopamine boost,” the influencer's voice echoed.  
“What for?” the young man murmured.  
Cold showers, early workout, power naps, ashwagandha, meditation, binaural beats, nootropics, all these “hacks” looked useless now, plasters on a gaping wound.  
After a warm shower, on his bed, he glanced at the little frame on his nightstand. On it, with a calligraphic script, was written: “Everything you ever wished for awaits on the other side of this mountain. Endure!”  
Exhausted and empty, Max knew: The only thing on the other side of the mountain was another mountain.  
“Enough,” he whispered, “I have endured more than enough.”

5 pm. Max closed his laptop, put it in the drawer beneath his desk, and put on his jacket.  
“Wait, Max? Do you have a minute?” Bill interjected.  
“Of course. What is it?” Max smiled.  
Bill lowered his voice.  
“Well, I noticed you have not been grinding the extra hours with the team recently. I understand you needed a bit of rest after your... little health issue.” His breath smelled of cold coffee. “But it has been some time now,” he continued, “I was hoping you'd put your foot back where it belongs: on the gas pedal. There is work to do. We are in the middle of a big crunch.”  
Max beamed at his manager.  
“Bill, you already told me that, because of my medical leave, my grade this year would not go above meet-expectations. So, why should I keep grinding?”  
“Come on. Don't go quiet quitting on me, Max. The company is counting on you,” Bill urged.  
“For more than two years, the company kept repeating that I would be rewarded after working hard. Maybe it's time to switch. I'll work extra hours after being paid extra.”  
“Max, think about the team. Think about your career.” Bill implored, with a hint of a threat.  
“Hmmm...” Max considered, “I'll think about my life first. Good-bye, Bill.” And he walked away.  
A disgruntled Bill turned his gaze towards Samantha, who overheard the conversation. Behind her desk, the young lady stared through her thick glasses, like a deer in a headlight.  
“Well, you can thank him for the extra work you'll have to endure.”  
Samantha’s eyes and mouth gaped in disbelief. Her gaze slowly dropped to her handbag, where she hid her anti-anxiolytics.  
She clutched her fists, closed her eyes, and took a deep breath. Her body relaxed. She slammed her laptop shut.

1q6npoh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1q6npoh/aita_for_having_contact_to_my_brother_ex/,AITA for having contact to my brother ex girlfriends?,"Hello,

I (31F) have an older brother (36M), and we have—or at least used to have—a very close relationship. We live in different cities because of work, but whenever we are both in our hometown, we spend a lot of time together. We share the same group of friends, go on summer vacations together, and usually call each other almost every day just to say hello.

My brother has had two serious girlfriends in the past. Both of them were wonderful people, and I was the first person in our family he chose to introduce them to. I clicked with both of them immediately and genuinely considered them my friends. I could even imagine them as my future sisters-in-law.

I stayed in touch with both of his ex-girlfriends after their breakups. I never interfered in my brother’s relationships and never commented on the breakups, even though I was sad they ended. Just because their romantic relationships ended didn’t mean our friendships had to end as well. I occasionally meet them for coffee or exchange a few messages. We have a nice, respectful friendship, and I try to avoid talking about my brother so I don’t bring up memories. If they ask about him, I keep my answers brief or change the subject. My brother has always known that I remain in contact with them, and when he asks how they are doing, I follow the same approach.

A few months ago, my brother started dating a new woman and, once again, introduced her to me first. We went out for cocktails and talked briefly. From my perspective, she seemed a bit strange (like entitled Karen) but as we only spoke for a short time, I ignored my first impression.

When my brother went to the restroom, she began asking me uncomfortable questions, such as how many girlfriends he had and how long his previous relationships lasted. I told her those were questions she should ask him directly. During the conversation, I mentioned that I was still friends with his ex-girlfriends and that they were nice people.

At that point, her demeanor completely changed. She became visibly angry and started yelling, saying it was abnormal for a sibling to stay friends with a brother’s ex-partners and that she couldn’t trust me. I was shocked. When my brother returned, he noticed the tension and asked what happened. I told him to ask his girlfriend, paid for my drinks, and left. I knew that if the situation escalated further, I might lose my temper and respond badly.

The next day, my brother texted me saying that he and his girlfriend were expecting an apology. She had twisted my words and told him that I said she would never be as good as his ex-girlfriends. I called him immediately and explained that this was absolutely not what I said. I told him she asked about his exes, I redirected her to him, and I only mentioned that I was still in contact with them and that they were good people. I also explained what she said to me while yelling, but he didn’t seem to believe me. We agreed to disagree and didn’t speak for a few days.

A few days later, he called and asked me to stop my contacts to his ex-girlfriends because his current girlfriend is insecure and he thinks it would improve the situation. I told him no. He is my brother, but his ex-girlfriends are my friends. I want no part in relationship drama, and I don’t believe I am responsible for managing his girlfriend’s insecurities or mental health. I told him this was his situation to resolve.

That was three weeks ago, and we haven’t spoken since.

So, AITA for staying in contact with my brother’s ex-girlfriends?

  
**Update:** His breakups with those girls were calm. I don’t know the details of what happened—I was curious, of course, but I didn’t want to ask or reopen old wounds. My brother and his exes don’t seem to hate each other (or at least they’ve never said anything like that to me).

My brother only knows that I still meet them when he asks what I’ve been doing or when we’re back in our hometown for the holidays and he sees me heading out and asks where I’m going. Otherwise, I try not to bring it up or draw attention to it.",5,1767811294.0,AITAH,17,0.86,False

1q6nl1e,https://www.reddit.com/r/america/comments/1q6nl1e/not_enjoying_america_after_living_elsewhere/,Not enjoying America after living elsewhere?,"hey people,

I want to preface that I am not some crazy anti-American. I consider myself a patriot, love a lot of things about our country and the culture and its people and values. I’m pretty moderate politically but admittedly lean right on many topics. 

With that said, I’ve had the privilege to work and live in Switzerland for a year, and in China for a summer. I know that doing “stints” in a country doesn’t always expose you to the realities of being an actual citizen long term in that country, so I try to avoid romanticizing my experiences. However, through these experiences and having lived in several different states in the US as well, I’ve found my allure for America steeply dropping.

I look around in many places and just see ugly buildings, chain fast food, big roads. I love the good ole American road trip and have done several, but even that is getting old. As I mature, I’ve started to gravitate toward people and culture and community rather than just views. And therefore it can be a bit of a bummer when I’m in places like the Mountain West with stunning views, but then come down to a valley filled with Walmarts and McDonald’s. It’s in stark contrast to the beautiful and culturally rich mountain towns in the alps I traveled, or the rural villages in China.  Not to mention I’ve come to hate driving everywhere. As a teenager this never bothered me, but after living places where I could just bike or walk or take efficient buses and trains everywhere, I absolutely can’t stand hopping in and out of my car countless times a day for various tasks. 

This is why despite its chaos and I totally understand that it’s not for everyone, I kind of consider NYC one of America’s only true cities. There is a TON wrong with it of course. But at least there, I could live almost anywhere in the city but easily access any other part of the city via quick subways and walking. People in New York spend less time in their apartments and tend to utilize parks, coffee shops, and event spaces for socialization, which mimics the community sense I get in other countries. I walk around a lot of other American cities and it’s just sleepy out - there’s a ton of cars driving around but barely anyone walking the sidewalks or hanging out. 

Anyway, this isn’t meant to be a negative “I hate America” rant lol. I love our innovation, our boldness, our bluntness yet kindness and willingness to help others, etc. These were things I missed when in other countries, where people could be a bit more standoffish. I’m an adrenaline junkie, and sometimes the “peacefulness” of these other countries was too slow for me, so I craved that American chaos and passion and excitement. But at the same time, I come back here and get so disappointed when I see the lackluster vibe of a lot of our towns/cities.",1,1767811023.0,america,4,1.0,False

I was honestly surprised because we had only been talking for 3 days. So I replied that we had just started talking and it felt too early for something serious.
Today we met again in the evening at a chiya adda, and she said the same thing again. I gave her the same response.
Now I don’t really know what she’s into or what to make of this. On one hand, I’m flattered and kind of amazed that someone can feel that strongly so quickly. On the other hand, I’m also a bit scared because it feels way too fast for me.  Is this a red flag or just someone who’s very emotionally expressive?",0,1767811007.0,NepalSocial,10,0.5,False

1q6nitf,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1q6nitf/daily_driver_recommendation/,Daily driver recommendation,"Hello friends! 

Looking for daily driver coffee bean recommendations with some pretty specific context. 

I'm a shift worker (paramedic) who does 12h shifts in Ontario, Canada, and generally speaking while I'm at work I just buy whatever is cheapest/most convenient. But even while buying cheapest, cost has definitely been climbing and the general quality has dropped far enough where it just doesn't feel worth the convenience factor anymore.

At home, I generally brew espresso based drinks out of a Bambino plus/Kingrinder combo and have tried to essentially brew an extra long Americano (20oz recipe) to bring to work in a Yeti. For whatever reason, the specialty coffees just don't age very well throughout the day and it's also a lot of effort/time pre-shift (usually 4-5am) to brew. 

The current solution I am going for is to start brewing filter coffee out of a Fellow Ode/drip machine combo (I know I know...) to make the morning process for work as quick/easy as possible while maintaining as much brew quality as I can. 

I'm looking for recommendations as far as what type of coffee bean you'd choose that generally holds it's quality well throughout the day as well as brews well out of a drip machine. As well, any tips you might have regarding brewing with a drip machine, some tips I've seen online to optimize the drip machine is to allow for pre-infusion before extraction as well as dialing in the coffee/water ratio. How important would it be to fresh grind vs pre-grinding the night before?

A few weeks ago I spoke with someone who was diagnosed with BPD and bipolar 3 years ago. She gave me some amazing advice that I want to share with you as I started to implement these things in my daily life that have really improved my overall health and wellbeing.

1. It is necessary for people with mental illness and disorders to have a routine. Start your day by doing something that gives you comfort and happiness. However, it is not possible to turn your life around in the span of one day, you need to start your daily routine by doing one or two things only and then when you are ready you add more things to your routine. If something makes you feel uncomfortable or gives you bad feelings/emotions, do not do this in your routine. You ALWAYS need to make sure you have everything possible to do your routine. If you start your routine by making coffee, always make sure you have coffee, milk, sugar; ect the day before. If you need to ask someone to help you get the things you need to complete your routine every day, please do this.
2. If you struggle to sleep, lay down flat on your back with your hands by your side and try to feel every single part of your body starting from your toes. Breathe slowly and deeply. This distracts you from anxiety and overwhelming thoughts. Watch or listen to something that gives you comfort at night like a video game walkthrough, look at pictures of a pet, read a book ect. Also make sure you turn off the blue light on your phone at 7 or 8pm. You can set your phone to do this automatically for you so your eyes feel more tired at night.
3. When you are in crisis, do not stay in the same position. You need to do something that distracts your brain and refreshes it. Showers for me have been very helpful, if I am deep in a crisis episode I turn on the shower and sit there under the warm water until I feel better. This has not yet failed me. If you dont like showers, sit outside and breathe or take a walk outside.
4. Go outside every single day, even if you have nothing to do. If you have a park close to your house go there and sit on a bench for at least 10 minutes. If you dont have a park close to you think of a nice place that you enjoy being at, ideally where you can watch people, cars, ect. Take a book if you enjoy it too, it is important to get fresh air every day.
5. Take a journal and write something down every day, even if it is small or negative. You cannot let your emotions and thoughts brew up inside of yourself. This can also help you when you are in crisis. Write down how you feel and what is going through your mind. This has really helped me as I often have strong thoughts and feelings throughout the day. When I feel one, I write it down. Take your journal with you if you go somewhere so you when you feel a strong thought you can write it down instantly.

This is all I have so far, if anyone has anything else at all to add please share! If it can help at least one person :) Good luck soldiers it will be okay.",6,1767810348.0,BPD,0,1.0,False

I had a huge crush on a girl in my class. I kept admiring her for a whole year, tried talking to her by getting her into group projects, sitting close to her, and finally gathered the courage to ask for her number in 10th. We talked on text for, I guess, a week or so she did not seem interested in me and i went back to chilling with my friends. At the same time, there was a girl who liked me and tried a lot to talk to me, but I was too dumb to understand that. Even when I understood, I was like I deserve better and had that god complex. After I left school, I tried with her. She did talk to me, we went out once for coffee, then we stayed in touch, but I was not that interested in her, so I stopped talking to her.
Then during my 11th and 12th grade coaching days, I fell for a girl once again, real hard. She was damn beautiful. I was too scared to talk to her. After a year, I gathered the courage to text her. She was into me, but then I stopped talking to her during 12th boards and texted her that it’s a crucial time, let’s not talk, and that went for a toss.
Then I moved to Pune  for some classes and fell even harder for a girl there. Her eyes were to die for. For months, I just kept imagining scenarios of how to talk to her. My heart just kept racing whenever I tried talking to her. One day I went for it and talked, made a basic conversation, but she was not that interested. I took her number from the class group and texted her, expressed my feelings too early out of desperation, and she said let’s be friends, so that went for a toss once again.
During this same time, I was talking to that coaching girl on Instagram. She still was up for it, and she even said to me that if you come back to the city and propose to me, I will say yes. But during that time, I was trying with that Pune girl, so I did not focus on her, and both the girls went away.
Then it was just dry land for me, so I tried with that school girl again, and she was talking to me again with interest. But out of desperation, I texted her that I like you too early, and she went away.
Now comes college time. A friend of mine showed me an Instagram profile of a girl. She was damn cute, and I was like this time I am not going to take a whole year to talk to her. So I found a common friend, went out with her friend group after three days, and she gave me her number. We started texting and meeting in college every day. It was so good, but here also I made a dumb mistake of telling her my feelings within seven days. I wrote a big ass message on WhatsApp, and she said she sees me as a friend.
I did not lose hope, so we kept in touch, but I became her puppy did whatever she said never got angry if she behaved in a weird way and after close to one and a half months, I was like I need to know if she is into me or not, and I confronted her. She said she is not, and here we are—25 years old, never had a girlfriend.
All my friends say I look good, I am a nice person to be with, and some people find it amusing that I do not have a girlfriend and are like it’s not possible, but it damn is. The reason I did not try further with the college girl was that it was COVID time, and I planned to drop out of college to focus on my career, so I came back home.
Two mistakes I find common are not trying enough and desperation. But now at this age, I just want someone who is emotionally mature and has empathy towards people, someone I can marry and grow old with. I hope I find someone. I just need love and care.

আমার personal feeling, এর একটা বড় কারণ real-life loneliness।

1q6n4bq,https://www.reddit.com/r/gout/comments/1q6n4bq/what_options_do_i_have_if_i_cant_tolerate/,What options do I have if I can’t tolerate allopurinol or febuxostat?,"Hi everyone. I’m dealing with gout from hyperuricemia and I’m stuck in a situation where the two main uric acid medicines keep wrecking my stomach. I know this isn’t medical advice, but I’m hoping to hear from people who’ve actually been through something similar and found a workable path.

My uric acid was around 8.2 mg/dL when this started, so I went to a rheumatologist and was put on allopurinol. Soon after starting, I developed stomach discomfort, changes in stool/urine, and the worst symptom was upper stomach burning and fullness. When I reported this, the doctor said it wasn’t from allopurinol, but the symptoms matched what I later saw listed as common side effects. I still continued for about 3 months, but eventually the stomach issues became unbearable.

It got to a point where I couldn’t tolerate spicy or acidic foods, and even things like lemon water, tea/coffee, or very hot drinks would trigger symptoms. I went to a gastroenterologist, had an endoscopy, and it showed gastritis. I did treatment and diet control, and it took almost one year to recover about 80%. Even now I’d say I’m only 70–80% recovered, not fully back to normal.

During all this, my gout symptoms didn’t magically disappear. I made big lifestyle changes: I avoided meat, tried low purine and low carb, and I lost about 15 kg. That helped bring my uric acid down from 8.2 to 6.8 at one point, but my symptoms still didn’t fully go away. Over time, I regained weight, and now my uric acid usually floats around \~7.2 mg/dL even with decent diet control. For me, I only feel properly better when uric acid goes below \~5.5 mg/dL.

The bigger issue now is my knees. I have knee pain, a burning sensation around the knees, and a clicking sound when I walk, and it feels like it’s getting worse over time. I’m scared I’m slowly losing my ability to walk comfortably.

I tried febuxostat too. It actually gave me relief, but it also triggers my stomach problems, and my gastritis-type symptoms come back when I take it. I also tried probenecid (uric acid excretion through urine) and it didn’t help me. I tried some blood pressure meds that supposedly have a secondary effect on uric acid and they didn’t help either. I also tried a blood sugar medication that was said to help uric acid (I don’t remember the name), but that didn’t work for me too. I’ve tried the “take an antacid/PPI in the morning and then introduce the uric acid drug” approach as well, and that still didn’t make it tolerable.

Before anyone says “just see a doctor,” I’ve already seen 3–4 rheumatologists and 2–3 gastroenterologists. The consistent response has been: these are the main drugs available and there isn’t much else they can do. That’s why I’m posting here.

One odd thing: I donate blood every 2–3 months, and I get about one symptom-free day after donating. I have no clue why, but it’s consistent. I’ve also tried a bunch of non-med options like tart cherry, juices, etc. It helps a little sometimes, but never enough unless uric acid drops below my “good zone.”

So my question is mainly for people who cannot tolerate allopurinol or febuxostat (especially due to gastritis/stomach issues). What helped you? Did you find any strategy to make ULT tolerable (splitting doses, micro-dosing, timing, brand changes, pairing with a different stomach med, anything)? Are there any alternatives that actually worked in real life? And also, did anyone discover their knee symptoms were partly something else, even though uric acid was high?

Any help or shared experiences would mean a lot. I’m honestly worried about my knees getting weaker month by month and I’m trying to find a way forward.

After watching Montreal take down the Hurricanes in Carolina and the Panthers in Florida last week, I have a feeling tonight's visitors will be light work.

I had already purchased my marathon bib for this weekend. I have been trying to get myself the strength to make it to race weekend even just for the fun.

For reference, we used to work together for about 5 years, during which time she mentored me and we developed a professional friendship.  Even after we no longer worked together, she threw me a baby shower with a bunch of former coworkers and we keep in touch with quarterly coffee or dinner/drinks.  I would not classify us as ""close friends"" though.

She told me about a position opening that would work directly for her.

However, I am struggling with not disclosing because of the personal relationship we have.  I feel like I am hiding something if I wait until I get an offer and then thrust the news upon her that I'd be going on leave starting July.

Is the deal good enough for me to just buy it anyways?
