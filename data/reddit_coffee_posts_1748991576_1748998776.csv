1l2skks,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1l2skks/buying_my_dream_machine_from_whole_latte_love/,Buying my dream machine from Whole Latte Love went wrong... and I can never own one now,"Hi r/espresso! Long-time lurker, first-time poster here (and first Reddit post ever)! I wanted to share my recent experience purchasing my dream espresso machine from Whole Latte Love (WLL), which unfortunately ended up being a frustrating story.

**TL;DR**: Ordered ECM Puristika in April (delayed shipment), received it Friday; the boiler started leaking water on first use. Shipped back for exchange, then informed machine was out of stock.

Full story: I started making espresso a year ago with a Flair Pro and a manual grinder since I only wanted to enjoy Iced Americanos at home. It had been such a pleasant experience trying out different coffee beans, experimenting with new techniques, and adding new tools to my workflow that I wanted to upgrade to a semi-automatic espresso machine earlier this year. After thorough research, I found the ECM Puristika to be perfect due to its aesthetics, compactness, and espresso-only focus. 

In April, I finally pulled the trigger and bought the machine on Whole Latte Love, which was the only retailer in the US carrying the model at the time. Because I needed to move out of state in May and was informed of its low stock, I followed the sales agent's advice and placed a delayed-shipment order. The original shipment date I confirmed with WLL was May 26th. 

Last week, the shipping date passed without updates, so I reached out on May 28th. Miraculously, the machine shipped out shortly after (LOL), and I received it on May 30th. With all excitement, I set it up the next day, only to find water leaking from the machine as soon as I pulled the lever for the first time. I promptly contacted technical support. After attempts at troubleshooting failed, the agent (who was very kind and patient throughout) arranged an exchange order pending supervisor approval.

Monday morning, I received two emails, one with a return shipping label and one with a new order confirmation of the same machine. Packed everything up and dropped the original box at the UPS immediately after. 

But after a day without an update, this afternoon, I reached out to the customer support only to hear that the ECM Puristika was now out of stock. Moments later, my replacement order was abruptly canceled without prior notice. Confused and frustrated, I spoke with another agent who kindly offered alternative machines, even pricier ones, but unfortunately, none met my requirements. And the reality is: the model is now unavailable everywhere in the US - I probably lost the last chance of owning this dream machine. 

To be clear, the support team members I interacted with were genuinely empathetic and helpful. My frustration lies entirely with WLL's inventory management and communication processes. Specifically: 

* Why wasn't stock availability checked before approving my exchange order? 
* Why wasn't I notified proactively when the ""supervisor"" reviewed my ticket? 

Later this afternoon, I declined to go with a different machine and requested a full refund to my credit card, and I found another decent option that met my two needs to purchase, from another retailer :) 

Anyway, I don't know how many people will read through my rant, but if I were to give some advice to any friend here that is considering buying an espresso machine, ask about the specific inventory status, and avoid certain retailers if you can. Thank you!",1,1748998628.0,espresso,0,1.0,False
1l2skgy,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1l2skgy/should_i_bother/,Should I bother?,"I’m going to try to make this as short as possible so bear with me. A little background about me is I’m 29 F and I have been single for 2.5 years, after spending 5 years on/off with a guy who cheated on me and destroyed me mentally. Due to the hurt I’ve experienced I’ve really had no desire to date but occasionally scroll on the dating apps. About a week ago I came across a guy on Tinder I was friends with/used to hang out with ~10 years ago and we definitely kissed/made out once but never went any further. I was hesitant at first to like him but I did and we were a match. 24 hours goes by and no message so I messaged him. He immediately comes off very strong (in a good way) asking me so many questions about myself to get to know me again, telling me I look great, matches my energy like 100%, even brought up catching up over coffee or a drink, and went as far as telling me his schedule and asking me for mine then suddenly he’s just like disappeared and hasn’t responded to me. My last text to him was on Saturday night and I asked him questions (about himself) so it’s not like it would’ve been something he wouldn’t know what to respond to. My friends think I should double text. But I absolutely do not want to do that at all. I’m not going to beg for a man’s time or attention. I just don’t understand why the switch up. I guess I’m just a little disappointed because even if nothing ever came of us romantically, it still would have been nice to remain friends. I guess I’m just looking for some advice. Would you just move on? Or wait for more time to pass and see what happens? I lowkey hate this 😩",1,1748998620.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

1l2sjto,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1l2sjto/working_at_a_place_i_hate/,Working at a place I hate.,"I (21M) am working at a place I hate and don’t know what to do. I was recently unemployed for three months and felt so useless during that time and ready to feel productive. Now that I got this job at a coffee shop, that feeling of uselessness has turned into complete anguish. I hate the work, hate the management bossing me around, the people I work with are insufferable. I just am dying for it to be done with every shift.

I actually had another job at a coffee shop with the same company a year back which I adored but had to quit due to toxic management. It was so fun and social while it lasted but it seems it was a one of a kind job. I think the difference with this one is my coworkers are just not my cup of tea. A lot of them are way older than me and the ones that are younger I just have nothing in common with.

I hope someone can relate to how I feel. I literally cried over it today and realized it’s making me so unhappy. I don’t even want to talk to my parents about it because with these situations they always 
tell me about how I just need to keep working and that that’s life. I need a job through college although luckily I am not dependent on it as I have 15k in savings. But I just know when I’m unemployed I get so depressed but when I work at boring agonizing places like these I get even worse.

Am I just being a baby about this or am I right to be feeling how I am. Additionally, does anyone recommend any fun SOCIAL jobs that I could apply for that has people my age to connect with?I would appreciate any help as I just feel lost right now and it’s exacerbating other problems I have in life right now. I just want to go back to a year ago. Thanks.

Chapter 1

At the company's IPO press conference,my husband,Chris Morgan,looked at his female secretary more than once.

I turned away and made an appointment to terminate my pregnancy.

At the same time,I asked my lawyer to draft a divorce agreement.

Chris received the email and called me to question me,his tone was angry.

""What a joke,just because I looked at Linda more than once?""

""Yes,it's because you looked at her.""I replied shortly.

——

The live broadcast of the press conference on the screen continued.

Chris took the microphone from Linda Portland with a smile and continued with her opening remarks.

""Thanks to me as a secretary,all the big and small projects of the company have passed through her hands in the past ten years.I have seen how hard she has worked over the years.""

""Taking advantage of today's opportunity,everyone is here,I announce that I will transfer 20%of my shares to Linda Portland.From now on,we are not only superiors and subordinates,but also partners.I hope she will continue to work hard in the future.""

As soon as the words fell,there was an uproar at the scene.

Then,thunderous applause.

The blessing made Linda cry and Chris smiled then handed her a tissue.

Just one glance,Chris's eyes made me sure that this man no longer belonged to me.

He easily wiped out my ten years of hard work with two sentences.

He put the credit that belonged to me on another woman's head.

He was unkind first,so I was unjust and had no burden.

I turned away and made an appointment to terminate my pregnancy.

Then,I dialed the number that I knew by heart.

""Does the cooperation you talked about last time still count?I want to join.There is only one condition,the company's management rights must be in my hands and I hold 50%of the shares.""

The other party agreed immediately,with a joking tone.

""Miss Lincoln,have you figured it out?Shares are easy to talk [about.As](http://about.As) long as I can invite you,this great Buddha,I will go through fire and water without hesitation!""

""But I'm really curious.When you graduated,you said you didn't want to work with me at all.I've been waiting for you for ten years.Why did you suddenly change your nature today?""

""Don't ask what you shouldn't [ask.You](http://ask.You) talk too much nonsense.""

I rolled my eyes,took the keys and drove out,heading straight to the hospital.

After the operation,I took a taxi back home.

I walked in with Chris.He saw the shirts I wore yesterday still piled on the sofa and frowned.

""Why didn't you wash the clothes?""

Turning to look at the dining table,his face darkened.

""You didn't cook either.Are you feeling unwell today?""

I covered my stomach,the pain made me not want to talk,I just looked down at my phone.

A simple shake of the head was a response.

Chris handed me a packaging box and ordered neatly,""Then do it now.Make one more portion today.I'll take it to the company.The press conference just ended and I have to work overtime tonight.""

He continued after a pause,""Linda come with me.I can't let the employees work hungry.""

In the past,I would take the initiative to help him with all the housework without him asking.

During the day,I was the marketing manager and worked hard with him in the business world.

At night,I was a housewife,I had to wash and cook for him and serve his temper.

Ten years have passed like this.

But now,I felt it was boring.

After he finished speaking,I just sneered and didn't move.

""Sorry,I can't do it.Besides,didn't you eat outside?I'm not just talking about food.""

Chris's calm face suddenly darkened.

""What nonsense are you talking about?I've been busy all day,do I have to see your cold face when I come back at night?Do I owe you?""

""Knowing that today is our wedding anniversary,didn't I bring you a gift?Can you stop being so sarcastic?When will you understand my difficulties?""

Chapter 2

My eyes fell on the box and I reached out to open it.There was a 1-gram lipstick inside,pitifully small.

My phone happened to see the brand's advertising video.This little thing was a gift from the Valentine's Day gift box.I almost laughed at my own humbleness.

Chris's face was a little ugly and he forced himself to respond,""I know you don't usually wear makeup and I looked through all the major brands to buy this gram,so don't be silly.""

I ignored his words.The alarm rang and I took handfuls of medicine.

Chris's face changed and he quickly took the medicine bottle away.

""What are you doing?Don't you know that you can't take medicine randomly when you are pregnant?""

Seeing that my expression was wrong,Chris softened his tone and threw the lipstick aside.

""Okay,okay,if you don't like this color,just throw it away.Can't I buy it for you again?Belle,you are not alone now.Being angry will affect the development of the baby.""

After saying that,I put the printed divorce agreement on the table.

""The agreement is [ready.You](http://ready.You) can sign it when you are free.Also,I don't have time to serve your little secretary.Since you spoil her so much,why not hire a nanny for her directly.""

Chris was busy with all kinds of things,so I naturally couldn’t trouble him with such a small matter as drafting an agreement.

But after hearing this,he directly sank his face and stood up suddenly.

""Divorce?Are you kidding?Just because I glanced at Linda at the press conference?She is just my [secretary.You](http://secretary.You) recruited her into the company.If we had anything,we would have already.Why wait until now?Can you stop making trouble?""

After saying that,his eyes fell on my belly and he lowered his head as if he accepted his fate.

""I know that pregnant women are emotionally unstable.I have tried my best to take care of you,but don't go too far.""

The leather shoes stepped directly on the carpet and the dust left a glaring mark behind him.

I almost blurted out a reminder to him in the next second.

Reacting,I swallowed the words in my throat and laughed at myself.

He was always like this,not caring about the results of my labor and my efforts.

Now that I was leaving,what happened to him had nothing to do with me.

Looking up at him,I nodded calmly.

""Yes,it's because you looked at her.Isn't that reason enough?Chris,I said before we got married that I can't tolerate any sand in my eyes,but now you have changed,so there is no need for us to continue.""

Chris frowned and he was about to explode in anger in the next second.

I spoke again,""Also,the child has been aborted,don't worry,he won't become an obstacle to you.I won't compete with your Linda for shares.Sign it when you have time,express it to me,the address is on it.""

After saying that,I turned around and left without paying attention to his frozen figure.

I heard his heartbreaking shouting behind me,""Belle,if you dare to leave today,don't even think about entering the door in the future!""

The corner of his lips curled up with a sneer.

He used this sentence to imprison me for ten years.I kept bowing my head and apologizing.

In return,there was no understanding,only his further advance.He thought I would turn around and admit my mistakes like before.

But as soon as the voice fell,my pace quickened.Not entering the door was exactly what I want.

Divorcing because of the look my husband gave his secretary sounded too unbelievable.

But only I knew how much affection that look contained.

This was a secret between Chris and me.

When I first met him,I was still struggling in school.

I was bullied by classmates and insulted by teachers.

Chapter 3

Chris was a transfer student with a handsome appearance.He attracted everyone's attention as soon as he arrived.

My classmates reminded him to stay away from me.They said I was the daughter of a mistress,a natural vixen.

Chris said nothing,but his eyes became deeper and deeper when he looked at me.

When changing seats,the whole class isolated me and no one wanted to sit at the same table with me.They moved my desk and chair to the trash can.

Only Chris stood up and said he wanted to sit with me.I noticed that he approached me intentionally or unintentionally.But my humility made me dare not think too much.

He took a step forward,I retreated.Every time we meet deliberately,I always flee in embarrassment.

But I didn't expect that Chris would chase me directly to my house.

My father broke one of my legs,so I took sick leave.He came to my house with his homework,but my parents quarreled.

In fact,my mother was the original wife and my father emptied her dowry and cheated all the money.He also wanted to divorce her and make her leave the house.

In order to make my mother retreat,he brought his mistress to the city.The name of a vixen hit my mother hard.

The mistress lived downstairs and every time he passed by,my father would always look at her deeply.Every time I saw her,I would be beaten up when I got home.

In order to buy medicine for me,my mother ran wildly in slippers on a rainy night and finally died under the wheels of a truck.

My father was happy for a long time and he didn't come back all night.The next day,he couldn't wait to bring his mistress home.

Because I was at home,they could only communicate with their eyes.Every time I accidentally saw my father's eyes,I would get goose bumps all over my body.

Until the day I became an adult,my father looked at me with the same eyes.

That night,he wanted to lock my door and I knocked him unconscious with a bottle of wine.

On the way to escape,I ran into Chris who came to deliver my homework.

My father held a kitchen knife and forced us into the alley.

A second before the knife fell on my head,Chris rushed up.

Finally,the police car and ambulance arrived at the same time.

Chris's shoulder was broken and the bone was visible.But he was still smiling at me.

""Belle,you will be safe from now on.""After saying this,he fainted.

I stayed up all night with him.After he woke up,we were together naturally.I was crying and touching the gauze on his shoulder.

""You love me very much,I can see it.I can read a person's heart through his eyes.If your eyes change one day,I will take the initiative to leave.""

Eighteen-year-old Chris raised his other arm with difficulty and rubbed my head,""Little fool,you will never see it in this life.""

I knew he didn’t believe me.I never thought that one day this sentence would come true.

After that night,the scolding against me in the school completely disappeared.

All my classmates were particularly enthusiastic about me.

Chris raised his chin proudly,like a peacock with its tail spread.

""See,I told you,you are very charming,everyone will like you.Don't be unconfident,as long as I am here,you are a noble little princess.""

He took me and washed away the haze of the past little by little.He taught me to get out of inferiority and look up at the sun.

A month later,I met him chasing a gangster and beating him in the alley outside the door.

""I told you to bully Belle,do you know you're wrong?""

""Belle likes strawberry-flavored cakes,do you understand what I mean?""

""Get lost now!""

The memories became blurred and I could no longer remember the look in the boy's eyes.

I returned to the apartment where I lived before marriage alone and rested for three days.

Chapter 4

Chris did not send a single message.

The company group chat popped up discussions from time to time.

""Linda has become a shareholder of the company?Has she become a phoenix?Is she about to get married with Mr.Morgan?""

""Need I say that?Didn't you see that Mr.Morgan asked Linda to go to the office every day?What else can a man and a woman do when they are alone?""

""Why call her Linda?Call her Mrs.Morgan.I don't want to get along with you!""

""What about Miss Lincoln?Doesn't she like Mr.Morgan too--""

""Come on,she can't even put on makeup.Which man can like such a woman?Aren't there many unrequited loves in the company?""

\*\*\*

When we chose to marry in secret,he said he didn't want to be gossiped by [employees.Now](http://employees.Now) it seemed that it was just to make it easier to get out of it.

On the fourth day,I went to work as usual.I came just to submit a resignation application to the HR department.

She looked at me in surprise.

""Miss Lincoln,do you want to resign?Does Mr.Morgan know?I dare not approve your resignation application.Everyone knows that you are a veteran of the company.If you leave,won't it be like breaking Mr.Morgan's arm?""

As soon as the voice fell,a colleague's contemptuous voice came from outside the door.

""What can't be approved?You are too embarrassed to stay.""

""After all,the projects that have been handled were successfully signed after being handed over to Linda.If I were her,I would have packed up and left long ago!""

""The project that Linda signed this time directly put the company on the market.Can Belle do it?It's a compliment to say that she is a vase,it's just a toilet!""

The projects she mentioned were all the plans I rushed out day and night.But every time at the last minute,Chris would hand it over to Linda.

Suppressing all the grievances,I smiled and looked up,""Yes,you are right,so I am going to resign.Please make a way for me.""

""I hope the company will move towards new glory under the leadership of Linda.With Linda here,everyone's salary will definitely rise.""

""Who are you showing your sarcasm to?I have been annoyed with you for a long [time.You](http://time.You) are a manager and you think you are the boss's wife?""

A colleague was very angry and wanted to rush up to me.But he was stopped by the people next to him.

""Okay,why waste time with such a person?She can't do her job well and she can't hold on to men.She is still a leftover woman at an old age.She will suffer in the future!""

Ignoring everyone's reaction,I took the elevator with my resignation application.

The elevator door slowly closed and I was exhausted.I squatted down and hugged my legs tightly.

Ten seconds later,I stood up again and resumed my vigorous and resolute appearance in the past.

I walked straight into the office.

Linda was eating potato chips on Chris's sofa.

""Miss Lincoln?No,sister-in-law,why are you here?""

As a secretary,Linda was the only person in the company who knew my identity.Chris explained that it was convenient for her to arrange work.

But ten years later,I didn't see any convenience in [work.It](http://work.It) was convenient for her to provoke me.

My eyes swept across the crumbs on the sofa and I just felt ironic.

In the past,when I entered his office,even drinking a cup of coffee was a luxury.He always said that he was afraid that I would dirty the carpet and the sofa.He was afraid that it would affect the appearance of his company.

Now it was Linda and he had no taboos.

Chris saw me coming in and his face instantly turned cold.

""Don't you know how to knock?Can't you see I'm busy?Go out and knock again!""

Linda threw the bag of potato chips on the ground and hurried forward to comfort him,""Don't be angry,Mr.Morgan.Belle didn't mean it.She was just anxious.Besides,we are a family.What will the employees outside think if you let Belle go out?""

Chapter 5

I glanced at her coldly,""When did you have the right to speak here?""

Linda's charming expression froze on her face and tears burst out of her eyes,""I'm sorry,I shouldn't have made Belle angry.I'm leaving now.""

She had just taken two steps when Chris grabbed her wrist.

""Stop,it's not her turn to make decisions in my office.Stand here today and see who dares to let you out!""

He looked up at me with a provocative look.

""What?You know you're wrong?Come to beg me now?It's too late!""

I clenched the paper in my hand.

""Sorry,I'm here to get the divorce agreement.""

The remaining self-esteem made me not want to expose my vulnerability in front of Linda.

After lying subconsciously,Linda's face changed.

She walked quickly to me and took my hand.

""Belle,don't be [impulsive.Do](http://impulsive.Do) you want a divorce because of me?What did I do wrong?I can apologize to you.If it doesn't work,I can resign and leave.Don't quarrel because of me!""

Chris's patience has reached its limit and his tone suppressed anger,""Belle,I said that Linda and I have nothing.Believe it or not!You want a divorce,right?Okay,just don't regret it!""

His tone was furious,""Before you leave,change all the project leaders under your name to Linda,return the bonus to the company and go wherever you want.I will never stop you!""

My eyes were red and I looked at him in disbelief.""That's what I got after countless nights.Why do you want me to give it to her?""

Chris didn't even look at me and turned his back irritably.He lit the cigarette at his fingertips.

Linda saw the right time and bumped into the corner of the table.

Blood instantly seeped out of her forehead and her face turned pale,

""Belle...I have admitted my mistake.I don't want the project,I don't want anything,is that okay?I'm leaving,I'm leaving the company now,don't embarrass Mr.Morgan...""

Before I could react,Chris had already picked me up.

He glared at me and slapped me in the face.

""Belle,Linda has apologized.You're not done yet,are you?""

""It's my patience with you over the years that has made you unable to recognize your position.Okay,if you want a divorce,I'll sign it now!""

The resignation application in my hand fell on the table,overlapping with the divorce agreement.

Chris didn't even look at it and signed three names neatly.

I was left the office when Chris held Linda’s back.

A gust of wind blew by and I wiped the tears from my face.

I went downstairs and took a taxi to the airport.

In the hospital,Chris treated Linda's wound and felt inexplicably irritated.

Thinking of the project that I had worked hard on for half a year,he forced himself to calm down.He knew that the project was the most important to me,so he deliberately mentioned that I should change the person in charge,because he was sure that she would not agree.

In this way,he thought I could refuse the divorce naturally.But he didn't expect that he signed impulsively just now.

After thinking for a long time,Chris sent me a message tentatively.

""There is a problem with the project.Come to the office later and we will talk face to face.""

A glaring red exclamation mark occupied the sight.

The next second,the subordinate called in.

""Mr.Morgan,it's bad.All the projects of the company have been poached!""

""The other party used the same plan as us and even knew our bottom price!""

1l2shv0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l2shv0,Ready to just give up 😩,"First of all, I want to apologize for the novel. But I am at a loss. I have the most beautiful snow mink boy. He is a handful to say the least. He is 9 months old. Fixed. Issues since we first got him up to now, to be honest I have tried and tried to develop a relationship with him since we picked him up and it is still very hard to get him to warm up. He runs when we try and pet him and cowers and leaves the room quickly when someone enters. I have a previous bengal that I got from the same breeder, night and day difference. She is an angel and we are so close, which is why I made the decision to get her a companion. 

This guy on the other hand, is a nightmare. I cannot stand it. I am very tolerant too. He is destroying my house. He pees on every single thing. Clothing, couches, beds, pillows, every square inch of our carpet. We live in a new build that is a little more than a year old and it just smells like ammonia now. I have used enzyme cleaners and everything just to try and put a stop to it. If ANYTHING is on the floor, it is getting peed on. He has peed on my eldests backpack three times now just because it was sitting on the floor as some days he forgets to hang it up on the hook. I have had to replace them every time. 

The litter boxes (5) are clean all day everyday. The litter isn’t the issue either. He has been tested for UTIs and everything else. We have tried countless different litters, no other cat in my house has this issue. He has plenty of enrichment toys, he has his older sister that is his best friend, the only one he is somewhat nice to. He has a personal ziggydoo wheel, lots of hiding spots and cat trees, a climbing wall. He gets treats and love all day (however he won’t even let anyone touch him or go near him), everyone in the house is so gentle with him and he cowers from us all day. 

He has attacked me unprovoked countless times. The first time, I woke up in the morning and went to sit on the couch with my coffee and he attacked me because he was on the couch prior to me sitting. He bit me a few times and clawed up my entire arm, very deep. He has attacked my toddler and left a wound on his face that was deep enough for stitches. He attacked my toddler (gentle boy, also unprovoked) a few other times before this. He eats and destroys all of my children’s belongings to the point I have needed to throw out more than half of their toys due to him eating them. He sneaks around and steals items just to destroy them. Destroyed all my older son’s school work one day. Stalks my husband and I and attacks randomly. 

Knocking down things on shelves is normal, but he does this ALL day. I could live with that normal bengal behaviour if it wasn’t also accompanied by the rest of his antics. 

We have 4 cats total. 2 bengals and 2 previous rescues. He steals food out of our other cats mouths no matter how much we try and separate them when eating (we tried separate rooms but the others refuse to eat unless all in the kitchen together - so we separate them to the 4 corners of the kitchen and he wolfs down his food and runs to the other kitties), he harasses them all daily to the point that they all stopped playing for months, are so depressed and they hide all day from him. You wouldn’t even know they are in our house anymore. When treats are given, he does the same - wolfs his down and steals treats out of the other cat’s mouths as they are eating. I feel so terrible for them as they can’t even eat in peace. 

He scratched my other boy cats eye not once, but twice, to the point he had an eye ulcer (x2) and needed veterinary care and antibiotic drops, he has scratched up all the other cats faces to the point they all have scars. 

He acts feral all day. We are at a loss and ready to just call the breeder to take him back. The biggest issue is him attacking us unprovoked every other day. We are so patient and kind to him. My children are both extremely good and gentle. There is no reason for this at all. We have tried EVERYTHING. Like I said, his older sister (bengal) and our other kitties are all really well behaved and happy with the exception of being around him now. It’s to the point that even our bengal girl stopped playing with toys because he attacks her if she tries to touch anything. 

AITA if I just break down and call our breeder to take him back? He attacked my toddler needing stitches. I was there and he was happily playing with his toys on the living room floor and kitty just ran and jumped up and swiped his face and ran. 

I love him as I love all animal babies and have tried so hard, but I can’t think of one good thing that has happened with him since we got him. It’s breaking my heart and I feel so defeated. I am not one to just give up, but he’s destroying my house and hurting everyone in it. This is not normal.

I was in labor with twins—my second pregnancy—and it was a difficult birth.With the last bit of my strength,I called my husband,Franco,the so-called""renowned gynecologist""who should have been by my side.

What I heard on the other end wasn’t comfort—it was barking.A chorus of panicked howls.

His voice was cold and distant.""I'm performing a C-section on Leanna's dog.There are eight lives in her belly.You’ve only got two.""

Then,with a scoff,he added,""What,you can’t give birth without me?Leanna has depression.If her dog dies,she won’t survive either.""

Before I could reply,he hung up—and blocked my number.

Our son Alec,only a child,ran off to find Franco and begged him to help me.But he was in a rush,cradling a shivering dog in his arms,too busy escorting it to the pet hospital.

Without a care,he shoved Alec aside.

My son stumbled,fell to the ground,and chased after him in tears—only to be struck and killed by a speeding truck.

My unborn twins died in my womb,suffocated due to the delay in surgery.And I,from severe blood loss,was left unable to bear children ever again.

Losing all three of my children broke me.I wept until I could no longer breathe.

When Franco saw the three urns and the divorce papers,he completely lost it.

——

After emergency surgery,I had barely been wheeled into my room when Franco barged in with Leanna clinging to him.

He stormed up to me,grabbed my arm,and yelled,""Mara,you're nearly thirty.Why are you being so dramatic about giving birth?You needed me there?""

""Leanna's dog nearly died!Do you have any idea how serious that was?And you—jealous and petty—made such a scene that the hospital director insisted on a C-section and forced me to come back for you?""

His gaze dropped to my deflated stomach.He sneered.""Didn’t you deliver naturally anyway?Don’t act so weak.I’m a doctor—I know what a natural birth looks like.With your body,you could’ve run a marathon right after.This act just disgusts me.""

As he pulled me,the stitches from the C-section tore open again.The pain was blinding,my body soaked in cold sweat.

I was deathly pale,my voice hoarse as I whispered,""The babies...they didn’t make [it.It](http://it.It) was a difficult birth...""

Before I could finish,Leanna burst into tears.

""I’m sorry,Mara,this is all my fault.Maple had complications too,and I didn’t know who else to call.I had to ask Franco.Please don’t blame him—don’t keep him from seeing his kids because of me...""

Franco glared at me,then gently pulled her into his arms.

“She’s making a fuss over giving birth—what’s the big deal?It’s not even her first child.Still acting all pure like she's never had one.I spoiled her too much.”

Then,as if switching masks,he turned to Leanna and softened.

""Don’t listen to her.Maple gave birth to eight puppies on her first try.She's the one who’s strong and amazing.""

Looking at them,it felt like a thousand needles stabbed straight into the softest part of my heart.

So this was [it.In](http://it.in/) his eyes,Leanna’s dog...was more important than our children.

""You came just to show off that the dog gave birth safely?""I choked out,my voice trembling with grief.

Leanna wiped her tears and gently clutched my wrist.

""No...I came to ask for your help,Mara.""

I yanked my hand free.""I just lost my children and nearly died.I don’t have anything left to give.""

""Mara!""Franco snapped.""It’s just a small favor—don’t be so heartless!""

""You had twins.Your prolactin levels are double.Maple can’t produce milk yet.We need some to feed her puppies—""

I grabbed the glass from my bedside and hurled it at him.""Get out!""

Leanna wailed,""If Maple’s puppies die,I don’t want to live either!""

Chapter 2

Suddenly,Leanna grabbed the fruit knife from the table and slashed at her wrist.

Franco panicked,lunging to snatch it [away.In](http://away.in/) his haste,the blade slashed a deep gash into my thigh.

Blood gushed out instantly,but he didn’t even notice.

He was too busy cradling the now-fainting Leanna in his arms,whispering words of comfort,completely unaware of the wound he had just inflicted on me.

In the chaos,the black medical case beside the bed was knocked [over.It](http://over.It) popped open slightly—just enough for a splash of bloodied water to spill out.

Leanna shrieked and buried herself deeper into Franco’s embrace.He,in turn,kicked the box away in disgust.

But that box held the bodies of the twins—our babies—who had died before they could even open their eyes and see the world.

Tears poured down my cheeks.Ignoring the pain in my leg,I crawled toward the box and tried to protect it with my arms.

But my desperate attempt only infuriated Franco.

He kicked the box further away and coldly called for hospital staff to dispose of it.

“No!Don’t!Please!”

I sobbed so hard it felt like my insides were being torn apart.I clutched the box tightly to my chest,trembling all over.

Franco paused,then muttered with a frown,""Mara...are you having postpartum depression or something?""

He didn’t wait for an answer.He turned and left,holding Leanna close as he walked away,leaving behind nothing but the echo of my cries in the cold hospital room.

—

It was a long time before he returned.

This time,he brought a postpartum meal and awkwardly cleared his throat.

“I overreacted earlier,”he said.“But you shouldn’t have lied to me while I was operating on Maple.”

He sighed,as if the whole thing had been a minor misunderstanding.“Leanna only developed depression because she fell in love with me.I feel responsible for her.But I only see her as a sister.All those things I said—just to comfort [her.You](http://her.You) understand,right?You’re always the understanding one.”

It had always been this way.

If Leanna was unhappy,he would mess with me or Alec just to make her laugh.Then he’d bring us a small treat,a hollow apology,thinking it would make everything right.

I looked at the lipstick stain on the hem of his shirt and gave him a small,numb smile.

It was over.I felt nothing but bitter emptiness.

However,he seemed to take that as forgiveness.

He changed the subject,his tone light.“So?What about the babies?Were they both boys?Or two girls?Maybe one of each?”

He waved over a nurse,beaming.“Bring them in.I want to see my kids.”

The nurse hesitated.She glanced at me,then at him.“Dr.Davidson...your children,they...""

Just then,his phone rang.

Of course,it was Leanna.

He answered immediately.

“Franco...”she cooed.“Maple just spit up some milk...is she going to die?”

“Don’t be scared,Leanna.I’m coming right now.”

He hung up and rushed out of the room,so fast he forgot his coat.

The nurse called after him indignantly,“Dr.Davidson!Your wife just had a C-section!”

But Franco had already vanished down the hallway.

I grabbed the nurse’s arm before she could follow.

“I don’t need his pity,”I said quietly.“Can you...take me to see my son?”

Alec was waiting.On the eighteenth floor—in the morgue.

I held my abdomen where the fresh wound throbbed with each breath and staggered toward the cold farewell room.

There,beneath the sterile lights,lay my son.

Alec looked so peaceful.

Tears splashed onto my hands as I pulled his tiny body into my arms.

“My sweet,silly Alec...did it hurt?I’m sorry,Mommy didn’t protect you.”

“I miss you so much.You were always so obedient,so kind.How could you bear to leave me behind?”

“Why didn’t you take me with you?Are you scared,all alone out there?”

“It should’ve been me.I chose the wrong father for you.It’s all my fault.”

I sobbed until I couldn’t breathe.But Alec would never smile at me again.He would never hug me,never wipe away my tears with his little hands.

Chapter 3

The warm,radiant little sun in my life had turned into a cold,pale moon.

I didn’t know how long I sat there crying—until my tears ran dry.That’s when a notification lit up my phone screen.

It was a public post from Leanna.

The photo showed two people kissing tenderly,their fingers interlocked.

The caption read.\[Congratulations,Dr.D,for passing my final test!I’ve always been your first choice,again and again.Even without a title,I’m willing to grow old with you.\]

My gaze fell on the wedding ring in the photo—one I knew all too [well.It](http://well.It) stabbed into my chest like a blade.

But none of it mattered anymore.

The children I loved most were gone forever.

'Franco...I don’t want you anymore.'

—

When I woke the next morning,a bowl of hot porridge sat on my nightstand.

A string of messages from Franco lit up my phone.

\[Mara,something urgent came up.I’m going on a short business trip.I left you breakfast and hired a top-tier maternity nurse and a care worker to look after you.\]

\[By the way,the maternity ward is really short on beds.Since you had a natural birth,don’t take up the hospital bed any [longer.As](http://longer.As) my family member,you should understand—it reflects badly on me.Please check yourself out.\]

\[Be good.I’ll bring back gifts for you and the babies.\]

I stared at the high-end maternity nurse standing in the doorway and felt a bitter laugh rise in my throat.

Sure enough,the next thing I saw on my phone was another show-off post from Leanna.

\[Feel better soon,my little pups!Daddy even took two whole days off to care for you\~You’re so lucky to have a daddy who loves you this much!\]

The photo was of Franco,crouching patiently as he bottle-fed a puppy.

My nails dug deep into my [palms.My](http://palms.my/) heart grew heavy.

I dismissed the nurse.

Despite the doctor strongly advising I stay hospitalized for at least a month,I refused.

I had a funeral to prepare—for three children.

—

Three days later,I dragged my weakened body to the funeral home.

When I came out,I was holding three still-warm urns—the last warmth they would ever give me.

“Let’s go home,my babies.”

Back at the house,I placed the three white porcelain urns neatly on the coffee table.Beside them lay a divorce agreement.

The house was eerily silent.I glanced at the photo wall in a daze.

A new picture had been added just a month ago:a family portrait taken on Alec’s seventh birthday.The three of us were smiling,frozen in time.

Now,my tears splashed heavily onto the urns.

I sent Franco a text.\[Let’s get a divorce.\]

It took him a while to reply.

\[Don’t be dramatic.I’m away on business.We’ll talk when I’m back.\]

Then he sent a photo—three tiny gold lock pendants.

\[Mara,look!Aren’t these cute?I picked them for the kids.I got one for you too.It’ll be a surprise!\]

The kids?

Coming from his mouth,that word was pure mockery.

All three of our children were dead—because of him.

And now he had the nerve to act like some doting father?

I stared closer at the gold pendants,and rage surged through me like a tidal wave.

Those exact pendants had been on the necks of Leanna’s puppies just yesterday.

Eight [puppies.One](http://puppies.One) gold lock each.

So even this shallow gesture of“love for the children”had been repurposed—from her dogs?

Tears blurred my vision.

I took one last look around the house that had held ten years of my marriage.Then I picked up the urns,turned my back,and closed the door behind me without hesitation.

Half an hour later,I parked outside Leanna’s apartment complex.

There they were—Franco and Leanna—pushing a stroller,walking their dogs,basking in the sunshine like the perfect couple.

A security guard chuckled as they passed.

“Wow,you two really spoil your pets.That bottle you’re using to feed the dogs—I didn’t even buy one that expensive for my daughter.Costs more than a month’s salary!”

Chapter 4

I recognized that bottle immediately.

Leanna had flaunted it in her social media post.Franco had gone out of his way to have eight of them shipped overseas just for her puppies.

I looked at the affectionate pair in front of me and let out a bitter,mocking laugh.

So this...was the man I had shared a bed with for ten years.

My eyes,still red with tears,locked onto theirs.Franco happened to glance up at that moment,meeting my gaze.

His expression froze,and after a few seconds of stunned silence,he abruptly pushed Leanna out of his arms.

I stepped out of the car,walking toward them slowly but steadily.

Leanna stumbled from the shove,looking dazed.When she saw it was me,a flicker of realization crossed her face—followed by a pitiful glare full of resentment.

“Mara,it’s not what you think,”he began to explain.“I just got back from a business trip—”

Lie.Go on,keep lying.

A nearby security guard chuckled casually,unintentionally delivering the final blow.

“Didn’t you take time off just to care for the pups?I’ve seen you around for days now—treating those dogs like your own kids.”

That one offhand comment shattered the last sliver of hope I had in Franco.

I took out the divorce papers and a pen,handed them to him,and said coldly,“Franco,I’m here to divorce you.”

His eyes widened in [disbelief.It](http://disbelief.It) was as if he’d never imagined I would actually go through with it.

Leanna clutched a puppy to her chest and stepped forward like she was trying to mediate.

“Mara,please don’t blame [Franco.My](http://franco.my/) puppy was sick and he only came to help because he’s a doctor...”

I let out a dry,scornful laugh.“A doctor?He’s a doctor for people,not a vet.He abandoned his own child to save your dog.Don’t you dare make him out to be some selfless hero.”

“But my puppy was really suffering...Mara,don’t be angry.Look how cute it is...”

She brought the warm,furry thing close to me.The moment its fur brushed my skin,a wave of nausea surged up.I instinctively went to push her away.

“Don’t touch me!”

Just as I raised my hand,I saw the glint of triumph in her eyes.

And then—she suddenly threw the puppy—hard.

A sharp,pitiful yelp pierced the air.

“My puppy!”

Leanna rushed over,cradling the tiny,lifeless body in her [arms.It](http://arms.It) had landed with a sickening thud,and now blood was trickling from its nose and mouth.

She sobbed uncontrollably,her voice trembling.

“Mara...if you hate me,come at me!Why kill an innocent puppy?It just came into this world—it was life too...”

I opened my mouth to explain,but a loud smack cut me off.

Franco had slapped me across the face.

“Mara!I told you already—it’s not what you think between me and Leanna.But that was a life!How could you be so cruel?”

My cheek burned red and swollen.I stood there,speechless,stunned.

Leanna suddenly broke free and ran toward the overpass railing.

“My puppy is dead...I don’t want to live either!Franco,take care of the others for me!I’ll repay your kindness in my next life!”

Franco dashed after her,pulling her into his arms just before she could leap.

He turned and looked at me with blazing fury.

“Mara!You know Leanna has depression!And you still provoked her like this?I’m done with you!”

I stared blankly as the crowd around us began to grow,their voices rising with judgment and blame.

“I didn’t...”I whispered,shaking my head.“I didn’t do anything...”

Someone pulled out their phone and started recording.

Franco snatched the divorce papers from my hands and,without hesitation,signed his name at the bottom.

“Fine,let's divorce just like you wanted!”

“But I want custody of Alec.The twins are breastfeeding,I know I won’t get them now.But I’ll fight for Alec in court if I have to!”

I stood there,hair disheveled,lips curling into a twisted smile like a madwoman.

“Franco...”I said slowly.“You won’t get a single one of them.”

“Why should I let you have him?With how cold and ruthless you are,I’d never feel safe letting Alec grow up around you!”Franco roared.

My voice cracked,sharp with pain.“Because they're dead!”

“You—”he choked,furious.“Just to stop me from getting custody,you’re actually cursing your own children to die?You’re heartless!”

I bent down,picked up the divorce agreement from the ground,and didn’t spare him another glance.

Let the onlookers film me,let them post their videos,spread rumors,curse me online—I didn’t care anymore.

All I wanted was to bring my babies home,to lay them to rest beside my mother’s grave.

The next morning,Leanna sent me a voice message.

I calmly closed the audio,removed my SIM card,and tossed it out the car window.

“Driver,take me to the airport.”

I wanted one with a bit of age this time, so when I spotted this 2004 vintage for around ~$50 (albeit, one year off the wonderful 2005 vintage) I picked it up immediately. Blend of 55% Cab Sauv, 40% Merlot, and 5% Cab Franc. Stored at 55 at home. Cork came out easily enough with an Ah-so, sipped/sniffed a little bit, then poured the rest in a decanter. Within an hour or so, I paired it with a grilled steak/veggies/potato meal, then enjoyed what remained of this Haut Medoc over the next 5-6 hours.

Visually, a deep garnet color with tawny/brick hue on the edges.

On the nose, I found the scents just intoxicating. Opened up with baking spices, cinnamon, cocoa, coffee - these great sweet/nutty scents - followed up with blackberry jam, raspberries, bit of soil/dirt/leaves. Over time, more notes emerged - faint tobacco, until the ""sous bois"" I was after took over the show for the rest of the day, flanked with plenty of fruit. Lovely stuff. 

On the palate, almost full bodied. Fantastically structured and in its prime to me - great acidity with a notable tannic grip that played along wonderfully with the steak & veggie meal. The wine needs food, was quite smooth with the grilled steak (much more astringent when drunk alone later in the day, last glass still had a bit of nibble to it). Bone dry with fantastic flavors of herbs, plums, raspberries and a sweet little >ting< I found quite endearing. Great, lengthy finish. Probably has many, many years left in it, but in a wonderful place now.

The words had been stuck in my throat for years—until that night. I had cooked his favorite meal, worn a dress he once loved, and dared to ask about the trip he promised me decades ago.

“Paris?” he scoffed, eyes glued to his laptop. “You’re not that young anymore.”

“Twenty years ago, you said that one day, when things got better, we’d go. We’d celebrate properly. I just… want to enjoy something after taking care of you, the kids, and this house—”

“Oh, so we tired you out?” he snapped. “Don’t make it sound like I forced you into this. You just stay home. What’s so hard about your job? Why don’t you be more like your sister Camille? Unmarried, independent, smart—she earned her own money and her place in the world. She can travel wherever she wants and doesn’t burden anyone.”

He shut me out. Worse still, I accidentally saw an email—a wedding confirmation. His wedding with Camille. In Paris. The guest list? My father, our son, and his wife—

My family. Everyone… but me. They hadn’t just excluded me. They had replaced me.

That’s when I knew I had to leave. After twenty years of being nothing but convenient, I finally woke up—and chose myself. I booked a one-way ticket to Paris and forgot about them. Only for them to realize my worth when it was too late.

\--

“I want to file for divorce.”

The words came out steady as if they had been waiting in my throat all along, finally tasting air for the first time.

There was a pause on the other end of the line. “Are you sure about this, ma’am? You’ve been married for twenty years.”

I looked around my bedroom—the walls I painted, the curtains I sewed, the furniture I polished every weekend like some loyal housemaid. The scent of lavender fabric softener clung to the bedsheets. Everything was clean. Perfect. Lifeless.

“Yes,” I said, firm this time. “I’m sure. File it as soon as possible. I want to leave this house immediately.”

I hung up before I could hear her response.

The silence afterward was strange—peaceful, but laced with a kind of ache only a woman like me would understand. The ache of finality. Of choosing myself after being forgotten for far too long.

I stared at my reflection in the mirror. My lips trembled, but I didn’t cry. Not yet.

Instead, my mind drifted back to that moment. The exact one where I knew this marriage—this life—was over.

It was a quiet evening. The house smelled like fresh pasta. I had spent the whole afternoon preparing his favorite meal. I wore a soft blue dress I hadn’t worn in years, thinking maybe—just maybe—he would notice.

I sat beside him on the couch, watching him review some documents from his firm, and then finally asked him about my dream destination, Paris, which he’d promised me.

“Paris?” he repeated with a laugh, not even looking up from his laptop. “What for? You’re not that young anymore. Can’t we skip the formalities? It’s not important.”

I stood there, holding my breath like a delicate glass.

“You promised,” I said softly. “Twenty years ago. You said one day, when things are better, we’ll go. We’d celebrate properly.”

Kier leaned back in his chair and narrowed his eyes. “With what money? Are you using your savings? Oh, wait—you don’t have your own money.”

I blinked. “Can’t it be a gift? I just… want to enjoy something. After taking care of you. Of the kids. Of this house—”

“Oh, so we tired you out?” he snapped. “Don’t make it sound like I forced you into this. You’re just staying home. What’s even hard about your job? I make the money. You get to sit in the comfort of this house and complain about wanting a vacation.”

Your job.

That word always scraped at me like a dull knife. As if motherhood, marriage, and being a woman were simple lines on a to-do list. As if the years I spent making everyone else’s life easier meant nothing. Like my work began and ended in the kitchen.

He went on. “Why don’t you be more like your sister Camille? She’s not even your sister by blood, and yet she’s miles ahead. Unmarried, independent, smart—she earned her own money and place in the world. She can travel wherever she wants and doesn’t burden anyone for it.”

Camille. The orphan they adopted when I was fifteen. The golden girl who walked into our lives and stole every single piece of love I thought I owned.

Before I could respond, my father walked in—David, stern as ever, with that gaze that had never once looked at me with pride.

“She’s right,” he said, sipping tea as if he hadn’t just walked into a storm. “Camille is the better woman. Smart. Practical. Knows what she wants.”

Then he looked at me.

“You, Erika… you were born into this house, but sometimes I wonder if that was the real mistake.”

I stared at him, silent.

“There’s a reason why Camille’s thriving and you’re still stuck ironing clothes and burning food. If I had a choice, she’d be my daughter. She doesn’t rely on men for anything.”

The room spun, my breath tightening. I didn’t reply. I never did. I had learned over the years that pain was quieter when swallowed.

But that didn’t mean it didn’t hurt.

I thought I could endure that and continue living this life, but not until that same night. He left his laptop open on the dining table. The email app still running. I wasn’t snooping. I swear, I wasn’t. But the subject line caught my eye:

“Paris – Wedding Confirmation”

My heart stopped. I clicked it.

Inside was a beautifully crafted itinerary. Elegant fonts. Gold accents. Venue details. Champagne menus.

A wedding. In Paris. Kier and Camille.

And the guest list? My father. My son. His wife.

My family.

Everyone… but me.

They hadn’t just excluded me. They had replaced me.

I finally snapped when I heard Kier’s voice from the bedroom. 

“Erika!”

I turned slightly.

He threw a wrinkled shirt at me.

“You really don’t know how to do your job? What on earth did you do to my clothes?”

Chapter 2

The shirt hit my face with a sharp snap, then fell to the floor.

“What is this?” Kier barked, glaring at the wrinkled garment. “Why the heck isn’t this done yet?”

I bent to pick it up, blood from the wound on my palm still seeping into the bandage.

“I’m sorry,” I said softly. “I got caught up with the laundry, and I was cleaning—then the vase earlier—”

“Oh, so you’re still making excuses now?” His voice rose. “Is that it, Erika? You want a Paris honeymoon but can’t even do basic chores?”

He threw a second bundle of white clothes at me, this one speckled with a pale yellow stain.

“And what about this? Look at it!” he snapped. “You ruined it. This is designer. Do you even know how expensive this was?”

I stared at the stain—barely visible—but in his eyes, it was a catastrophe.

“I didn’t see it,” I murmured. “I’ll fix it.”

“God, Erika,” he exclaimed. “This is your job. Your only job. You get to sit in this house, have whatever you want handed to you, and the one thing I ask—keep the house in order—and even that’s too hard?”

Before I could gather my words, the front door opened, and a familiar voice rang out, honey-sweet and full of sparkle.

“Kier! Brother-in-law! Why are you shouting again?” Camille.

She entered with her usual grand entrance—sun-kissed from her trip, her long curls bouncing, arms full of designer bags and luggage with tags still hanging from them.

“Oh, look at this!” she grinned, placing the gifts down. “Spain was beautiful. You’d love it, Kier. I brought you something.”

Kier immediately softened. “Camille, you didn’t have to—”

She held out a sleek box. “These are custom pieces from Madrid. Only a few made. I saw them and thought of you.”

He opened the box like a child with a toy, smiling wide.

Then Camille looked at me, feigning concern. “Why were you shouting at my sister? She looks tired. Look at her hands—she’s clearly been working hard. Don’t worry about the shirt. I brought you new ones.”

And just like that, I faded into the background again.

The front door opened once more.

“Camille! My star!” my father David boomed, walking in with arms full of gifts. “How was the trip? Tell us everything!”

She hugged him like the daughter he always wished I had been. “I closed the deal. It’s done!”

“Of course you did,” David beamed. “I always say—best decision I ever made was bringing you into this family.”

They laughed. They toasted water glasses. They complimented each other like a well-rehearsed play.

I stood in the corner like a piece of furniture.

Then Kier turned to me, already irritated. “Well? What are you doing just standing there? Go prepare food for your sister. She just brought us gifts, the least you could do is cook.”

Camille walked toward me with another box.

“Sis, I got something for you too,” she said with a fake smile. “Since I know you love cooking… it’s an apron. With matching kitchen mitts and measuring cups. Cute, right? You can wear it now while making dinner.”

I stared at it, lips tightening. I forced a small nod.

“Thanks.”

“Say it properly,” my father barked. “Where are your manners?”

I swallowed the lump in my throat. “Thank you, Camille.”

“See?” David grunted. “Stop babying her, Camille. She should be grateful. Let her show it through actions. Go, cook for us.”

So I cooked.

I cut. I chopped. I stirred and fried and cleaned, bleeding and aching all the while. I did it like I always did—without complaint, without recognition.

But when I called them to the table, I was met with silence.

Kier was the first to speak. “Actually, don’t bother. We’re heading out.”

“What?”

“Camille closed a major deal. We’re going to celebrate at Florentina’s. You know, that new luxury place near the harbor.”

Camille laughed. “You’ll love it, Kier. I booked the private balcony. It’s stunning.”

Then she turned to me, suddenly remembering. “Come with us, sis?”

But before I could answer, Kier scoffed. “No need. Erika doesn’t even understand what the deal was about. She’ll be out of place. Doesn’t even have clothes for a place like that.”

“She can borrow mine—” Camille offered half-heartedly.

Kier waved her off. “She’s staying. She’s behind on the laundry anyway.”

And like that, they all agreed. Camille smiled, my father chuckled, and my husband kissed Camille’s hand like it was nothing.

And I—once again—was left standing in a kitchen filled with steam, silence, and the scent of food no one would eat.

That night, after washing every plate, folding napkins, and mopping the floor, I sank onto the couch.

I opened my phone to escape—to scroll, to feel something other than this ache.

That’s when I saw it.

A new post. From my son.

Joseph.

I clicked.

There they were.

In Florentina’s.

Laughing. Drinking. Eating. Clinking wine glasses. My son. My husband. My father. Camille. Smiling like they were a perfect family.

Without me.

I stared at the screen, my hands trembling.

No caption. No mention. Just a perfect picture of everything I wasn’t allowed to be part of.

I had cooked for them. Served them. Loved them.

And they had forgotten me. Left me.

Again.

The tears came quietly this time. Not loud or dramatic. Just slow, tired, and steady. I didn’t sob. I didn’t scream.

I just let the ache fall from my eyes… because no one was ever going to notice.

Chapter 3

My eyes were swollen when I woke up. I must’ve cried myself to sleep on the couch because the stiffness in my back told me I hadn’t moved all night.

And I was late.

I scrambled to my feet, realizing with horror that I hadn’t prepared breakfast—the one thing they expected from me without fail, every single day.

As I rushed into the kitchen, I heard the sharp edge of Kier’s voice from the dining room.

“Where have you been?” he snapped, seeing me step into the room. “Still sleeping at this hour? Where’s breakfast?”

Before I could open my mouth, Camille emerged from the kitchen with a spatula in hand, smiling as if none of it was serious.

“Don’t worry,” she said brightly. “I already started cooking. She’s tired, so I let my sister sleep a little longer.”

“No!” Kier barked. “She should be ashamed of herself. Sleeping while you, our guest, cook? All she does is stay home, and now she’s even pushing her responsibility onto you?”

He turned to me, fuming. “Have some care for the people feeding you. Do something useful.”

I lowered my gaze and stepped past Camille quietly. “It’s okay,” I said softly. “I’ll handle the cooking. You just sit and wait.”

Camille smiled, brushing her hair over her shoulder. “It’s fine. It’s just chopping vegetables. Don’t make it a big deal.”

But before I could respond, our father walked in, placing a mug on the table.

“Even if it’s just chopping, you shouldn’t do that, Camille,” he said. “Your hands aren’t made for the kitchen. You’re a designer, not a housemaid. Let Erika handle it—it’s her thing.”

“It’s not a big deal, Dad,” Camille said with a small laugh, taking a knife anyway. “I can help.”

“No, really, I’ll do it,” I said again, trying to take the knife from her hand.

But she insisted, and I didn’t want to start an argument in front of everyone, so I let it go.

We stood side by side at the counter, both cutting vegetables in a tense silence, until suddenly—

“Agh!” Camille shrieked.

Blood dripped from her finger. She dropped the knife as Kier rushed into the kitchen in panic.

“What on earth happened?!” he shouted, grabbing her hand. “You’re bleeding! For heaven's sake, Camille, your hand—do you even know how important that is?! You have a presentation next week!”

“It’s okay, it’s just a scratch—”

Kier turned on me before she could even finish.

“This is your fault! You useless woman! You let her get hurt in your own kitchen! You couldn’t even chop those vegetables yourself?”

I was stunned. “I—I didn’t—”

But it didn’t matter. Camille tried to defend me, but her voice was drowned out by the chaos. They were all hovering over her, pressing tissues to her wound, blaming me for things I hadn’t done.

And I didn’t even have the chance to explain that I had a wound too.

The cut I got from cleaning up the broken vase hadn’t healed, and now with the kitchen work, it had split open again.

But no one noticed. So I quietly stepped away, my bleeding hand hidden under the edge of my apron, and went back to my room.

I sat on the edge of the bed, peeled off the bandage, and sighed as I pressed a clean towel to the reopened wound. The sting was sharp, but the silence stung more.

Then the door burst open.

Kier.

“Apologize to Camille,” he ordered.

I looked at him. “It wasn’t my fault. She insisted. It was an accident.”

He narrowed his eyes. “So what? You’re still responsible. Apologize.”

“I didn’t hurt her.”

“I don’t care. Just do it.”

Before I could respond, Camille entered the room too, still holding her bandaged finger.

“It’s okay,” she said, her voice soft now. “There’s no need for that. My sister is not at fault. It’s on me.”

I forced a nod, though my throat burned.

Camille glanced at Kier. “Anyway, we need to talk about the trip. Only three days away now.”

“Oh, right,” Kier said, his tone shifting instantly. “We’re heading to Paris. Business trip. I’ll need you to pack our things. I’m going, Camille’s going, and your dad too.”

Paris.

My heart skipped.

“Can I come?” I asked before I could stop myself.

They both looked at me.

Kier let out a harsh laugh. “You? Erika, it’s a business trip, not a vacation. Don’t dream too high. You wouldn’t even know how to keep up with the conversations. You’d just embarrass us.”

“I could just—”

“No,” he cut in. “This is for work. Camille’s part of the brand’s pitch. You’d be out of place. You don’t even have clothes for something like this.”

“I could—”

“She’ll stay,” he said flatly, turning to Camille. “She can finish the chores while we’re gone.”

Camille hesitated, eyes flicking to me with what might have been pity—or performance. “We’ll bring you something back,” she offered, with a thin smile.

My lips stretched into a small nod, but I felt it. The heat behind my eyes. The silence in my throat. The lump in my chest I had learned to swallow every day.

And then they laughed.

Not mean-spirited, not sharp—but casual. The way people laugh when they’re comfortable, when they forget someone else is in the room. Like I was a joke. Like I wasn’t even there.

Their voices trailed down the hallway as they made plans—restaurants in Paris, what Camille should wear, how the photos would look.

I turned slowly, walked into our room, and shut the door behind me.

No tears this time. Just stillness.

I moved on instinct, pulling the suitcase from under the bed, unfolding shirts, checking lists, laying out Camille’s makeup bag, folding Kier’s blazers. I didn’t think—I just did what I had always done: prepared everyone else’s life while mine sat on the shelf, untouched.

But then I saw it—Kier’s laptop.

It was still open, still glowing faintly on the nightstand. Like it was waiting for me.

I hesitated.

And then I moved toward it.

It took just one click.

There it was.

A photo. Clear as day.

Kier in a tailored suit. Camille in a white dress, smiling like she had already won. The Eiffel Tower blurred behind them, gold lights blinking in the background. Pre-nup photoshoot – Paris folder.

Another scroll down showed the wedding date. The one I’d seen in the email before. Confirmed.

They weren’t even trying to hide it anymore.

I stared at it.

But I didn’t cry.

Instead, I picked up my phone.

I dialed the gallery—the one I’d visited in secret once, where the photos lined the walls, each one glimmering with confidence and artistry. I remembered the way the assistant had smiled at me when I lingered in front of the bridal portrait display.

The phone rang once. Twice.

“How may I help you?”

I breathed in, slow and steady. Then spoke.

“I’d like to schedule a wedding shoot. A pre-nup session.”

“Of course, ma’am. May I ask the name of the bride and the groom?”

I paused.

Then smiled softly to myself.

“There is no groom,” I said. “Just the bride. Me. Alone.”

Because I was finally choosing myself.

Chapter 4

The necklace was gone.

I checked the drawer again, hands trembling. I sifted through scarves, opened every little pouch and box. Nothing. My chest began to tighten, panic seeping in like cold water.

No. No, no—it had to be here.

I turned the whole vanity upside down. And then it hit me.

Kier.

I rushed out of the bedroom, still in my robe, feet bare against the cold floor, and found him at the dining table, sipping his usual black coffee, flipping through files as if the world didn’t just tilt on its axis.

“Kier,” I said, my voice already breaking, “where’s my necklace? The silver one with the black stone. The one in the velvet box.”

He didn’t even glance up. “Oh, that? Gave it to Camille. Looked great on her. She’s wearing it in Paris.”

I blinked. “You gave it to Camille?”

“Yeah. Relax.” He flipped a page. “You weren’t using it.”

“It was mine,” I said quietly, my voice tight. “You didn’t even ask.”

He finally looked at me, sighing like I was a burden. “Erika. Be real. You probably bought it with my card anyway. What’s yours is mine, right? Why are you making this a thing?”

“No. I didn’t buy it with your card,” I snapped, hurt flooding my voice. “I bought it with my own money. Money I earned—on my own.”

His brow lifted slightly. “Doing what?”

“I’ve been designing again,” I said, my voice shaking. “Freelance. Quiet jobs. I’ve been saving for five years. That necklace… it was the first thing I bought for me in a long time.”

Kier scoffed. “Designing? What, kitchen aprons and pillowcases?”

I took a step back.

“You really don’t know me at all anymore, do you?”

“You’re being dramatic,” he muttered. “It’s just a necklace. I’ll get you a new one.”

“It was limited edition,” I whispered. “And I was going to wear it today. I was invited to a fashion show. I wanted to look like the woman I used to be, even for a day.”

Kier’s laugh cut through the air like a whip. “You? A fashion show?” He shook his head. “Erika, let’s be honest. You’ll be laughed at.”

I froze.

“You’re not that woman anymore,” he continued, like it was a fact he had long accepted. “You belong here. In this house. With your apron and your routines. Camille, on the other hand—she belongs on runways, in Paris, with people who matter.”

He stood, collected his folder, and headed toward the door.

“Don’t go to that show,” he said without turning back. “You’ll only embarrass yourself. I told you to pack for our things, right? Is it ready now? Do it! Make sure that we will not forget anything.” 

He left.

And I just stood there. No more tears. Just this strange, burning quiet in my chest. Not sadness, not heartbreak—just hatred. For the way I let myself become so small. For the way they never even had to raise their voices to crush me. For the way I spent twenty years handing out pieces of myself until there was nothing left but duties and silence.

I sat on the edge of the bed and looked around our bedroom—our curated little cage. The walls I had decorated. The sheets I washed. The photo frames that no longer held memories, just proof that I had once existed beside him.

I should’ve done this sooner.

I should’ve loved myself sooner.

But for twenty years, I chose to love a man who didn’t see me. I chose to serve a family that never said thank you. I chose quiet over conflict, sacrifice over self.

And what did it get me? Nothing.

I stood up.

I pulled out the dress I had planned to wear for the fashion show—the one Kier said was “too loud” for someone like me. I wore it proudly. Fixed my hair the way I liked it. Put on the lipstick he once said made me look “too old to matter.”

And then I left the house. They wouldn’t notice anyway.

I hailed a cab and gave the address to the gallery to finally do the photoshoot.

The assistant greeted me. “We’re ready for you,” she said, leading me into the sunlit studio. “You’ll look beautiful.”

I stepped in front of the camera.

The photographer adjusted the lens. “Are you sure you want these to look like bridal portraits… and you’ll be alone?”

I nodded. “Yes. I don’t have a husband.”

He nodded and then started taking photos. With every shot, I felt lighter. As if I were slowly peeling off the layers of someone else’s expectations.

I remembered Kier’s words from long ago—the ones that once made me stay.

“Erika, I know Camille is a star, but she’ll never want someone like me. She wants her career. You? You’ll stay. You’ll care. You’ll be my peace.”

He said he would give me the best life in return.

He gave me a kitchen. He gave Camille everything else.

I stood beneath the soft lights and smiled at the camera. Not a forced smile, not the kind I wore when guests came over or when Camille handed me a gift “just because.”

This smile was mine.

I left the studio with a print in hand. A single photograph of me in a dress I chose, in a life I finally began to claim.

That evening, the house was still empty. They had all gone out—another dinner, maybe another celebration. Probably laughing, posting photos I wasn’t in.

I didn’t care.

Because I wasn’t staying.

I opened my laptop. My fingers hovered over the keyboard.

Flight to Paris – One seat.

I clicked.

Booked.

I would go to Paris—not as a wife or a plus-one.

Not as a ghost in someone else’s celebration.

But as a woman fulfilling her own dream.

Chapter 5

The next morning, I stayed in bed, the suitcase zipped and ready by the door. I heard footsteps, voices, laughter in the hallway. I didn’t move.

But then Kier barged into the room, annoyed. “Where is the necklace?”

I sat up slowly. “What necklace?”

“That necklace—the limited edition one I gave to Camille. It’s missing. Did you take it back?”

I blinked. “Why would I take it back? You’re the one who gave it away. Without even asking me.”

“It’s gone,” he growled. “She was supposed to wear it today. And now you’ve stooped low enough to steal it back? Unbelievable.”

I stared at him, stunned. “You think I’m the one who’s low?”

“This is why you’re not coming with us,” he snapped. “You don’t deserve to be treated right. You’ve always been petty, Erika.”

Before I could answer, Camille entered the room, a bit flustered. “Wait, wait—it’s not her fault. I must have misplaced it. Don’t get mad at her.”

Their father, David, appeared behind them, tapping his watch. “We’re going to be late. Just buy another if you need to. Let’s go. Erika—make sure the house is clean by the time we return.”

And that was that.

They left.

No hug. No goodbye. No thank-you for the twenty years I gave them.

Just orders. Just silence.

I stood by the window and watched the car pull away, taking with it everything that once convinced me I was part of a family.

A few hours later, my phone buzzed.

Camille: Hey sis, we found the necklace! I’m so sorry about earlier. I’ll buy you something nice to make it up. Thank you again for letting me wear it—it’s so beautiful!

Then another ping.

Kier: Black card’s on the table. Buy whatever you want while we’re gone.

I read both messages and laughed. Softly, bitterly.

This was always the cycle, wasn’t it?

Hurt me. Humiliate me. Then hand me a credit card like it was a balm for the wounds they never acknowledged. As if the ability to shop would erase the fact that I was unwanted. Unloved. Undervalued.

But not this time.

I looked around the quiet house—empty now, like a ghost town echoing with memories that didn’t serve me anymore. Today, I was finished being their shadow.

I walked slowly to the living room, retrieved the envelope I had tucked beneath the couch cushion the night before, and placed it neatly on the coffee table.

Inside were the divorce papers, and also our wedding ring.

I stood for a long moment in the doorway. One last glance. Not for nostalgia. Just confirmation.

I wasn’t coming back.

At the airport, I sat near Gate 18, sipping quietly on a paper cup of coffee, staring at the glowing screen of my phone. I let myself smile. My life was beginning—at the exact moment they thought they had erased me.

I was mid-scroll through a rooftop restaurant review when a familiar voice sliced through the air.

“No way. My passport—where is it?”

Camille.

I froze. They were across the terminal, laughing, wheeling their designer luggage, wrapped in joy. My father, David, adjusting his tie. My son’s wife snapping a picture of the group. And Camille—rummaging through her purse, visibly agitated.

I doubt if they would even notice me as they’re busy on their own lives. 

Kier rubbed his forehead. “You’ve got to be kidding me. Didn’t Erika pack it for you?”

Camille blinked. “No, I… I asked her, but I don’t know if she—”

“She messed it up again. I told her to check everything,” Kier muttered, pulling out his phone. “I’ll call her. She can drop it off. It’s not like she’s busy.”

Of course.

Even now. Even after everything—they still expected me to fix their mess.

My phone rang.

Kier.

Then a message.

Kier: Camille left her passport. Can you bring it to Terminal 2? We’re at Gate 7. ASAP.

I stared at the screen. The same screen I had waited years to see his name on. Hoping he’d text I love you. That he was proud of me. That he saw me.

But now… now all I saw was proof. Proof that even when I was no longer theirs, they still expected me to serve.

I slowly typed my response.

Erika: I don’t want to do it. I’m done being your nanny, Kier. Goodbye.

Then I turned off my phone. I stood, lifted my suitcase, and walked toward Gate 18.

1l2s9r8,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeNewFriendsHere/comments/1l2s9r8/34m_longing_for_intense_and_deep_connection_and/,[34/M] - Longing for intense and deep connection and seeking the casual chat that leads to it,"Hello!

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the US (EST time zone, and with a rather sporadic schedule). My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, life is far more intricate than this. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are emphatically established and developed over time for a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**Also, no hesitations or doubts, please.** If you're at all interested then take the chance. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** My ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way. I seek people who generally know themselves and what they desire and offer. Being lost together is fun, but we each need a self to become lost. The type of connection I want also understands, accepts, and embraces the reality that there's more than deliberate engagement and a handful of interests that make someone up, from mundane chatter to intense distress - it strives to embrace these more grueling aspects of existence in a considerate way, while not being totally lost to them.
* **Being high in abstraction, sensation, and an ability to experience things beyond the blunt physical is pretty vital for me.** I want people with a vibrant imagination that are high in cognitive sensations in which such interaction, of various sorts, creates an elated state of splendor. I peak with ideation and abstraction, and seek out others who do as well.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics, which is inscribed onto one of the plaques I've placed above my abode in the Epistemic Wilderness. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and have actively sought out the most peculiar and obscure bits of knowledge possible since I was young. I seek peers in this and related endeavors.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, in which I primarily write about my observations and thoughts. I also adore writing conversationally, and am not uncommonly poetic and intense when doing so. Photography is also something I dabble in, although not as much as I'd like. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, and coffee.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here.
* **I'm INTJ, Type 5, score very high in openness and conscientiousness, and am a Virgo.** I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Are we looking for each other? **Doppelgängers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with. A person who understands that no one will ever be your clone and dares to take exuberant advantage of that fact seems required for the deepest sorts of bonds.**  I'd greatly appreciate a reasonably detailed chat/message in which you told me what within my ad resonated with you, what you're seeking, and anything else you may want to mention; anything dazzling will also do. I look forward to us chatting and connecting around meaningful and fervid passions.",1,1748997711.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

What can I do to find out?,"Sorry for the bad english, I'm too stressed to write coherently.This is going to sound completely crazy, but I don't know what to think anymore.

I've been married to my wife for 4 years now, together for 7 years total. We got together over Facebook and started a long distance relationship (we lived in different states, I'm from Brazil so this means close to 2.000km). After 3 years of relationship, she moved states to come live with me. Everything was awesome, I was and still am madly in love with her and she shows to also be with me.

Recently, strange things started to happen. I'm not exactly sure when it started, but the first memory I have of these stuff is from 2 months ago. We were in the kitchen, I was cooking and she was unloading the dishwashing machine. Suddenly, I hear a loud noise and feel a big pain on my right foot. When I look down, I see that she dropped a coffee mug on my feet and I was bleeding. She started apologising profusely, I said no worries, it was an accident. I go to the ER and I ended up not needing stiches, just some bandages as the cuts were not too deep.

Then, not even a week later, she asks me if I want ice coffee because she was making it for herself. I say yes and a few minutes later she hands me an insulated coffee mug (we have a few of those to bring cold/hot stuff to work or commute). I take a huge sip and I ended up burning my lips and the roof of my mouth because it was actually piping hot coffee. I scream and run to the bathroom to wash my mouth. She started panicking and said ""why would you drink such hot coffee this fast?"" and I screamed ""YOU SAID IT WAS ICE COFFEE"" and she started crying even harder apologising, that she wanted ice coffee but made hot coffee instead as it was easy and she just ended up saying it wrong. I said I believed her but I was mad for the rest of the day. I actually got 1st degree burns, nothing permanently scarring but very painful.

A few days later, I get home from work and the living room is dark. I ask Alexa to turn the lights on and she says the living room is disconnected, which means the lightswitch has been turned off. I go to turn it on using muscle memory because I can barely see anything and when I try to press the switch, I get a huge pain all over my body and pass out. I wake up a few minutes later with my wife shaking me and crying. I'm still a little bit dizzy so I try to get myself up but can't and ended up crawling to the couch. I got shocked. What happened, according to her, was the light started flickering. She changed light bulbs but nothing happend. When she unscrewed the lightswitch, she saw that it was short-circuiting. She removed the cover of the switch to patch the cables but realised we didn't have electrical tape, so she went quickly to the store to get some and forgot to put everything back together. I asked her why didn't she kill the circuit before doing electrical work and she just made a sad face and didn't really have an answer other than apologising.

The last one was 3 days ago. We decided to move our wardrobe from one side to the other of the room. We are lazy, so we both agreed to move it with everything inside, just slowly push it. I would go in the front, doing the ""arms"" work to direct it and she would just lean her body onto the wardrobe and push it. We started moving it and it was ok for a few seconds, then it just stared tilting towards me. I try to stop it from tumbling but it was already too tilted to reverse it and it started falling on top of me. Luckly, I jumped on the ground and the bed actually took the hit and I didn't get hurt. This could have seriously injured me or even worse. Accident or not, my wife wouldn't have the strenght to lift it up to save me. The bed actually lost one of it's wooden legs. I didn't scream, I just crawled to a safe spot and stood up, eyes wide, looking at my wife. She was screaming thinking I was under it, trying to lift it but the wardrobe wasn't even moving. When she saw me, she ran to hug me crying and said she was sorry, she just pushed too hard. I didn't hug her back, I was too shocked. I sat on the floor and said ""I don't know what is going on"". She kept apologising, but I must admit I don't feel safe anymore in this house.

The shitty thing is everything that happened COULD be an accident and it COULD be bad luck, but everything happened in such a short spam, everything only hurting me, It's just too unlucky to be just unluck. Other than that, she is just perfect to me, there are no red flags whatsoever. I'm going crazy trying to figure if I should take these stuff seriously.

I'm considering going to my cousin's house to clear my mind but I'm scared to do this and punish someone who was just clumsy and had no intent to hurt me. However, if she intents to hurt me, I must figure out a way to discover it. Any ideas of how I should proceed on this situation?

TLDR: My wife is hurting me in possible accident situations and I don't know if they are accidents or not. What can I do to discover if it's accidental or intentional?",3,1748997581.0,relationship_advice,5,1.0,False

The cold iron gates of the prison in Hoverdale creaked open.    
  
Sunlight fell on Lauren Bennett's gaunt, sallow face.    
  
The clothes she had worn when she was incarcerated now hung loosely on her frail frame.    
  
She had endured five dark, endless years in prison. Today, she was finally free.  
  
Dragging her legs, Lauren hobbled out of the prison, step by slow step.    
  
She moved sluggishly, not because she didn't want to walk faster, but because she simply couldn't.    
  
A black Bentley was parked by the roadside. The window rolled down, revealing a man's deep-set, brooding face.    
  
His gaze swept over her injured leg. He let out a cold scoff, the mockery in his eyes blatant. ""After five years in prison, you're still putting on an act.""    
  
Lauren's heart clenched unexpectedly, and a sour sting rose in her eyes.    
  
Elliot Bennett was her biological brother.    
  
Ever since she had been brought back to the Bennett family from the orphanage at fifteen, she had done everything she could to please him.    
  
Yet for the sake of an adopted sister who wasn't even related to him by blood, he had personally falsified evidence to convict her of attempted murder.    
  
Five years had passed, and he was still as sharp-tongued and as disgusted with her as ever.    
  
Lauren swallowed the bitterness, pretending not to see Elliot as she limped forward.    
  
Elliot's face stiffened.    
  
She had ignored him.    
  
In his memory, Lauren had always clung to him, eager to please.    
  
When he came home, she would bring him his slippers.    
  
When he was tired, she would massage his shoulders.    
  
When he had trouble sleeping, she would bring him chamomile tea every night.    
  
When work kept him too busy to come home for dinner, she would wait outside his office with a thermos, undeterred by rain or shine.  
  
During the three years she had been in their home, his chronic stomach issues had eased. But ever since she went to prison, he had often woken up in the middle of the night from the pain.    
  
Today, he had actually felt a hint of joy when he heard she was being released. He had even postponed an international meeting to pick her up.    
  
He had expected her to be overjoyed at seeing him, had even prepared himself for her to break down and complain about the suffering she had endured.    
  
He had never imagined she would greet him with nothing but silence and indifference.    
  
The admiration in her eyes was long gone. All that remained was distance.    
  
A strange, hollow feeling rose in his chest, irritating him. His grip on the steering wheel tightened, veins bulging on the back of his hand.    
  
His voice came out harsher than he intended. ""Get in the car.""    
  
The moment the words left his mouth, he regretted them. With a frown, he forced himself to soften his tone. ""Dad and Mom know you're out today. They've prepared a welcome-home dinner for you.""    
  
*Dad and Mom. Such familiar yet foreign words.*    
  
In the orphanage, she had dreamed of having parents who would love her, who would spoil her like a princess.    
  
She had waited and longed for it for fifteen years.    
  
Fifteen years later, her wish had finally come true.    
  
She had parents now, even a tall, handsome, and capable brother.  
  
But the beloved daughter of the family wasn't her. It was the adopted daughter they had raised since childhood, Willow Bennett.    
  
Those people weren't her parents. They were Elliot and Willow's parents.    
  
Lauren scoffed at herself.    
  
During those three years in that family, she had endured endless cold shoulders and humiliation. She had always known she was unwanted. There was no reason to go back and subject herself to it again.   
  
Though she walked slowly, she never stopped.    
  
Her indifference, her stubborn retreat, stung Elliot's eyes and ignited a nameless fury in his chest.    
  
He pushed open the car door and strode after her, his long legs easily closing the distance. He grabbed her wrist and yanked her back. ""Have you had enough of this act?""    
  
Thrown off balance, Lauren crashed to the ground. Pain shot through her injured leg, her face turning deathly pale.    
  
Elliot's anger flared. ""Still playing weak? Is this your new trick?""    
  
""Don't forget, you were the one who pushed Elaine down the stairs five years ago and left her in a coma. You even tried to frame Willow for it. Five years in prison, and you still haven't learned your lesson? Looks like it wasn't enough to reform you.""  
  
With that, he grabbed her and hauled her up without an ounce of care. His voice was laced with disgust. ""Don't think your sentence erases your sins. As long as Elaine remains unconscious, your crime will never be absolved. And you still owe Willow an apology. Get in the car. Don't make me say it again.""    
  
Lauren only found it laughable.    
  
She had explained before. Elaine Gray wasn't pushed by her. It was Willow.    
  
But no one had believed her. They had all chosen Willow's side.    
  
She was the biological daughter of the Bennett family, yet everyone had placed their trust in Willow's words instead.    
  
She was guilty, indeed. Guilty of ever returning. Guilty of ever hoping for a love that was never hers.    
  
She had learned her lesson. She would change.    
  
She would leave, far away, and never again fight for the affection of a family that didn't want her.    
  
*Why is Elliot so displeased?*    
  
She calmly pulled her hand from his grip and took a step back, putting distance between them.    
  
Her deliberate withdrawal made Elliot's chest tighten with frustration. His mind flashed with images of the old Lauren, the girl who had once followed him around, desperately trying to win his favor.    
  
Suppressing his anger, he tried to soften his voice. ""Come home with me.""    
  
Lauren lowered her eyes, her expression blank, as if she couldn't even be bothered to look at him.    
  
Her lifeless demeanor made Elliot's rage boil over.    
  
Five years in prison, and if she had learned anything, it was how to grow a temper.    
  
Just as he was about to snap, a warm, gentle voice interrupted.    
  
""Laurie.""    
  
Lauren's body tensed. Her heart, which had been numb for so long, clenched in an instant.    
  
Even after five years, she recognized that voice immediately.    
  
It was Lucas Reed, her childhood friend.    
  
She saw a pair of polished leather shoes enter her line of sight. A deep, magnetic voice spoke above her.    
  
""Laurie, congratulations on your freedom.""    
  
If anyone else had said that, she would have politely replied, ""Thank you.""    
  
But coming from Lucas, the words grated on her ears.    
  
Her most trusted childhood friend, Lucas, had taken on his first case after graduation as Willow's defense attorney, the one who had put her behind bars.    
  
Before the trial, he had said to her, ""Laurie, Willow has never suffered before. She wouldn't survive in prison. Can you take the blame for her?""    
  
*Willow couldn't suffer, but I could?*  
  
Just because she was used to hardship, she deserved to take the fall for a crime she didn't commit.  
  
Sending the real Bennett daughter to prison had made Lucas famous overnight in Hoverdale.    
  
Five years ago, he had still been a fresh graduate, a little green around the edges.    
  
Five years later, he had become one of the city's most renowned attorneys, exuding power and confidence.    
  
They had grown up together in the orphanage, closer than real siblings.    
  
When other kids bullied her, he had always defended her, swearing, ""As long as I'm here, no one will ever hurt you.""    
  
He had promised that when he became a lawyer, he would put anyone who hurt her behind bars.    
  
But later, when Willow had hurt her time and time again, he had dismissed her pain with a casual, ""Laurie, you're too sensitive. Willow isn't like that.""    
  
In the end, it was he, of all people, who had protected the one who hurt her and personally sent her to prison.    
  
...  
  
The air grew heavy with silence.    
  
Lucas' smile slowly stiffened, but he forced himself to extend a hand toward her. ""Laurie, I came to pick you up...""    
  
Before he could finish, Lauren suddenly turned to Elliot. ""You said we're going home, right? Let's go.""

**Chapter 2 Why Didn't They Come?**



Lauren knew she couldn't escape.    
  
Lucas had once been the person she trusted and relied on the most. Now, he was the one she loathed and least wanted to face.    
  
Rather than confronting Lucas, she chose the next best option—going with Elliot.  
  
At least, from beginning to end, Elliot had always despised her.    
  
The first day she went back to the Bennett Residence, Elliot had warned her, ""Even if we share the same blood, in my heart, I only have one sister, and that's Willow. You'd better behave yourself. If I ever catch you bullying Willow, I won't let you off.""    
  
He never gave her hope, so she never had too much disappointment. In front of Elliot, the psychological wounds she suffered could at least be minimized.    
  
It was better than being utterly destroyed by the one closest to her.    
  
Prison had taught her a lesson.    
  
When lacking power, status, or support, survival depended on minimizing harm by any means possible.  
  
So, when her cellmates toyed with her and made her choose between disfigurement and a slap, she chose the slap.    
  
When they made her choose between being beaten and kneeling, she chose to kneel.    
  
When they made her choose between drinking toilet water and barking like a dog, she chose to bark.    
  
She had fought back desperately before, but the more she resisted, the worse the beatings became. To stay alive, she threw away her dignity and let herself be used.    
  
Even when thrown among the most vicious criminals, she had still managed to survive, barely hanging on, by knowing when to avoid harm.    
  
Lauren walked toward Elliot's black Bentley.    
  
As she brushed past Lucas, her expression remained indifferent. She didn't even spare him a glance.    
  
The loose T-shirt skimmed past Lucas's fingertips. The emptiness of the touch didn't feel like fabric draping over a person. It was more like cloth hanging on a lifeless mannequin.    
  
Lucas' hand froze midair. In that instant, it felt like the air around him had solidified, leaving only that cold, hollow sensation at his fingertips.    
  
Pain and desolation flashed through his eyes, and his heart felt as if an invisible hand had clenched it tight, every beat throbbing with dull agony.    
  
Once, her gaze had always followed him, full of trust and dependence.    
  
They had grown up together in the orphanage, supporting each other. Whenever he called her name, she would always smile and answer, ""Luca, I'm here.""    
  
But now, time had changed everything.    
  
She looked right through him, as if he didn't exist, unwilling to even meet his eyes.    
  
Lucas' lips trembled slightly. He wanted to speak, but his throat felt blocked, unable to make a sound.    
  
Lauren got into the car and sat in the back seat. Everything in sight bore traces of another woman.    
  
The passenger seat had a fluffy pink cushion. The dashboard was lined with an entire row of adorable bear figurines. In the rearview mirror, the woman's reflection looked more mature than five years ago, more alluring.    
  
She was beaming, the kind of smile that only someone raised in comfort and luxury could have.    
  
That happiness on her face was like a silent taunt, mocking Lauren as the fake heiress.    
  
She had thought she could face all this indifferently. But seeing it with her own eyes still left a bitter sting in her chest.    
  
Lauren withdrew her gaze, but her eyes inadvertently landed on the handbag beside her.    
  
Inside was a pristine white gown. Even without seeing the whole dress, the intricate feather embellishments hinted at its elegance.    
  
Her fingers unconsciously rubbed against the rough denim of her jeans.    
  
Every detail inside the car reminded her that she didn't belong here.    
  
From head to toe, she wasn't even worth as much as the gown in that handbag.    
  
She turned to look out the window. The scenery blurred past in a rapid retreat.    
  
Elliot, still driving, didn't forget to warn her, ""Mom and Dad have missed you so much these past five years. They cried over you every day, their hair turning gray with worry. When you get home, keep your temper in check. I don't want to see you scheming against Willow again, making things difficult for them. As long as you behave, the Bennett family won't treat you unfairly.""    
  
Silence followed his words.    
  
Hearing no response, Elliot frowned in displeasure and glanced at her through the rearview mirror.    
  
""Lauren, I'm talking to you. Did you hear me?""    
  
Lauren finally looked up at him and spoke the longest sentence she had since leaving prison.    
  
""According to Article 48 of the Prison Law, inmates are allowed visits from family or guardians once a month, for thirty minutes to an hour. I was imprisoned for five years; that will be sixty months. If I had one visit per month, I could have seen them sixty times. But I never saw them once. You say your parents missed me. Then why didn't they come? Were they so busy that they couldn't spare even thirty minutes a month?""    
  
Her voice was calm, but every word was a blade, slicing through his lie without mercy.    
  
Guilt and panic flickered across Elliot's eyes. The reprimand he had prepared was caught in his throat, unable to come out.    
  
Avoiding her steady yet piercing gaze, his fingers instinctively tightened around the steering wheel, his knuckles turning white from the pressure.    
  
""It... It's because you were too hard to discipline. Mom and Dad didn't visit you because they wanted you to focus on correcting your bad behavior. They did it for your own good.""    
  
*For my own good? Letting me take the fall for Willow, making me suffer in prison... So, that's their idea for my own good. What a joke.*    
  
Lauren felt drained, utterly uninterested in arguing anymore. She turned her gaze back to the window.    
  
Before long, the car pulled into the Bennett Residence garage.    
  
Elliot seemed pleased. He grabbed the handbag from the back seat and hurried off.    
  
A few steps away, he suddenly remembered Lauren. His body stiffened, and when he turned back, there was still a trace of awkwardness on his face.    
  
""Go change into a proper gown and head to the banquet hall.""    
  
With that, he left without looking back.    
  
After five years, this house was still as unfamiliar to Lauren as ever.    
  
She had never felt an ounce of warmth here.    
  
This place wasn't even as good as the orphanage.    
  
At the orphanage, she hadn't had a private room, but at least she had shared a sunlit dorm.    
  
When the sun rose, light would pour through the windows, filling the room with warmth.    
  
Back then, she loved the scent of blankets basked in sunlight. It made her feel like she had a home.    
  
But after returning here, she realized that her so-called home wasn't the scent of sun-warmed blankets.    
  
It was the damp, musty stench of a place the sun never reached.    
  
She pushed open the door.    
  
The room was small, windowless, and packed with clutter.    
  
The only two pieces of furniture were a single folding cot and an old desk.    
  
This was the storage room that served as her bedroom for three years.    
  
Elliot had told her to wear a proper gown.    
  
But she had never owned one.  
  
For years, she had only had one set of her high school uniform. The T-shirt and jeans she was wearing now had been bought with money she earned from a holiday job on Amazon, for five bucks total.    
  
She still remembered the day she had happily put them on and asked Elliot how she looked.    
  
His brows had furrowed in disgust.    
  
""What the hell are you wearing? Can't you learn to dress elegantly and properly like Willow? Take it off and get rid of it! Don't embarrass our family.""



**Chapter 3 Canceled Her Allowance**



Willow's poise and elegance had been built with money and resources.    
  
In contrast, Lauren had nothing.    
  
The Bennett family neither gave her much love nor much money, yet they still blamed her for not being poised and elegant enough.    
  
Even now, she didn't understand why they had brought her back.    
  
Her only purpose in this family was to make Willow, the adopted daughter, seem more beloved.    
  
There was a saying, ""Those who are unloved are the outsiders."" It fit her unexpectedly well.    
  
Back then, their unfairness had made her sad. Now, she no longer cared.    
  
She scanned the storage room. The only clothing she had to change into was her old blue-and-white high school uniform.    
  
Five years ago, she had received an acceptance letter from Northcrest University, the top institution in Corwynale.    
  
Yet, the Bennett family had only thrown a grand celebration for Willow's college entrance.    
  
That banquet had gathered every elite figure in Hoverdale.    
  
Eighteen-year-old Willow had stood in the center of it all, draped in a custom-made gown worth millions, wearing a diamond-studded crown, basking in the spotlight like a princess between her adoptive parents.  
  
Meanwhile, Lauren had looked shabby and out of place, an ugly duckling among swans. Under the gaze of the entire crowd, she had been taken away by the police, spending the next five years in prison, losing the college life that should have been hers.    
  
...  
  
Five minutes later, dressed in her uniform, Lauren headed toward the banquet hall of the Bennett Residence.    
  
On the way, passing servants cast curious glances at her.    
  
""Who's that? Why is she here in a high school uniform?""    
  
""She's probably one of the hotel staff brought in for the event. Looks like a student working a summer job.""    
  
""Mr. David and Madam Alice treat Ms. Willow so well. They even invited the top chef from Lavette Grand Hotel just for her celebration.""    
  
""Exactly.""    
  
As one servant walked past Lauren, they didn't forget to remind her, ""The banquet is about to begin. Go change into the standard uniform. You must be careful while serving. Tonight's guests are all important figures in Hoverdale.""    
  
With that, the servant left.    
  
Lauren stood there, suddenly losing the desire to go to the banquet hall.    
  
Elliot had told her that her parents had prepared a welcome banquet for her. But he hadn't mentioned that they had invited outsiders.    
  
Being released from prison was nothing to celebrate.   
  
*Did they really need to make such a spectacle out of it?*    
  
Five years ago, she had been taken away in handcuffs in front of all of Hoverdale's elites.    
  
Now, they wanted to gather those same people and publicly celebrate the return of a convict.    
  
To her, this wasn't a welcome. It was a public humiliation, stripping away every last shred of dignity she had left.    
  
A mix of bitterness and anger surged within her. She didn't want to stay here any longer.    
  
She turned to leave.    
  
But just then, Elliot appeared, his expression darkening the moment he saw what she was wearing.    
  
He strode toward her, his voice sharp with irritation. ""Didn't I tell you to change into a gown? Why did you come dressed like this? Do you have any idea what kind of occasion this is?""    
  
Lauren opened her mouth to explain, but Elliot cut her off mercilessly.    
  
""You looked like a mess when you got out of prison, and now that you're back, you want to put on a pitiful act in front of everyone? Do you want people to think the Bennett family has mistreated you? Lauren, your manipulative tricks are just as disgusting as ever. You're beyond saving.""    
  
As he spoke, he reached out to grab her, still cursing under his breath. ""Go change. Stop embarrassing yourself!""    
  
Lauren sidestepped him.    
  
Elliot's hand caught nothing but air. His anger flared. ""How dare you dodge me?""    
  
Lauren lifted her gaze to meet his. He looked at her as if she were his worst enemy.    
  
That look—disgusted, impatient, filled with contempt—she had endured it for three years in the Bennett family.    
  
Every time their eyes met, it felt like invisible hands were tearing her heart apart. The tears she had once held back had only ever earned her a sneer of ""stop acting.""    
  
Maybe she had gotten used to it.    
  
Or maybe five years in prison had crushed her self-worth.    
  
Now, even as she faced his deep-seated hatred, she felt nothing.    
  
His opinions no longer had the power to affect her.    
  
Lauren's expression remained calm, distant, unyielding. ""I don't have a gown.""    
  
Elliot's fury grew. ""If you don't have one, then buy one!""    
  
Lauren took a deep breath. Elliot was too biased against her. No matter what she said, he wouldn't believe her.    
  
She had tried explaining in the past.    
  
But the more she explained, the more he accused her of lying. He had slandered her without restraint.    
  
It was exhausting. She didn't want to explain anymore.    
  
So she simply said, ""I have no money.""    
  
Elliot's brows knitted together, his rage burning hotter. ""For three years, you lived here without worrying about food or clothing. The company transfers 70,000 dollars to your account every month. Over three years, that totaled 2.5 million dollars. And you're telling me you couldn't afford a decent dress? You're doing this on purpose, trying to make people think our family mistreated you! Lauren, you can't be this selfish. We've already compensated you. Enough is enough. If you keep acting like this, it's just pathetic!""    
  
Lauren had expected this. No matter what she said, she would never be believed.    
  
She stared at him, unblinking.    
  
For some reason, under her steady gaze, Elliot felt a brief pang of unease.    
  
""What are you looking at me like that for? I didn't say anything wrong.""    
  
*He isn't wrong?*    
  
Lauren let out a cold, silent laugh.    
  
She hadn't wanted to make a scene.    
  
But Elliot's aggressive accusations stirred something dark in her.    
  
Out of the corner of her eye, she noticed people approaching.    
  
Since they wanted a commotion, she would give them one.    
  
She had already lost her dignity. She had nothing left to lose.    
  
But Elliot, who cared so much about his reputation, couldn't handle being humiliated in public.   
  
""I never received a single cent from your company. Not 70,000 dollars. Not even seven bucks. Mr. Elliot, if you want to accuse me, at least come up with a more believable lie.""    
  
Elliot's eyes darkened with even more disgust.    
  
""You just won't give up, will you? Fine. Don't blame me for exposing you.""    
  
He pulled out his phone and called the company's finance department, putting the call on speaker.    
  
""Check how much money the finance department has transferred to Lauren's account every month.""    
  
The person on the other end hesitated. ""Lauren? You mean Ms. Bennett?""    
  
""Yes.""    
  
""Mr. Elliot, if you're referring to Ms. Bennett, there's no need to check.""    
  
Elliot frowned. ""What do you mean?""    
  
""Well, we never transferred any money to Ms. Bennett's account.""    
  
Elliot froze.    
  
""That's impossible,"" he said sharply.    
  
*Lauren may not be well-liked, but she's still the daughter of the Bennett family. How could she not have an allowance?*  
  
The night she was brought home, he had discussed it with his parents. To be fair, they had decided to give Lauren the same monthly allowance as Willow.    
  
There was no way he had remembered it wrong.    
  
""I personally gave the order.""    
  
""Mr. Elliot, you might not know this, but Madam Alice said that Ms. Bennett came from an orphanage and had poor judgment. She was afraid Ms. Bennett would fall in with the wrong crowd if she suddenly had that much money. Since Ms. Bennett was a high school student back then and had no major expenses, Madam Alice canceled her allowance.""    
  
Elliot's mind buzzed.    
  
*No allowance... That means Lauren hasn't received a single penny in the entire three years she's lived with us.*  
  
""Oh, and Madam Alice doubled Ms. Willow's allowance to 140,000 dollars a month. She was worried Ms. Willow would feel neglected, so the extra 70,000 dollars was meant to comfort her. You knew about that, right, Mr. Elliot?""    
  
Elliot felt like someone had strangled him.    
  
He had not known.



**Chapter 4 You Have No Idea**



As the crowd grew, more and more people gathered around, all having heard the voice coming from the telephone receiver.    
  
Everyone present was stunned.    
  
The Bennett family wasn't the richest in Hoverdale, but it was still a prominent aristocratic household.    
  
For children of wealthy families, having a monthly allowance of 14,000 dollars was perfectly normal.    
  
They had never heard of a wealthy heiress who didn't even get a single cent in allowance.    
  
The Bennett family was the first.    
  
No wonder Lauren dressed so poorly, without even a decent gown to wear to a banquet.    
  
Even if she hadn't been raised by their side, she was still the real daughter of the Bennett family. Yet they gave her nothing while showering their adopted daughter with 140,000 dollars a month.    
  
For the Bennett family to allow such an outrageous situation to happen, they must have been utterly blind.    
  
The guests whispered among themselves. Elliot felt a chill down his spine, his face flushing with shame and anger.    
  
He refused to believe something so humiliating could happen to the Bennett family.    
  
Their family was wealthy and powerful. There was no way they would be too stingy to give their own flesh and blood a mere allowance.    
  
Elliot immediately questioned Lauren in a cold voice, ""Even if the finance department didn't transfer the money, Mom and Dad must have given you an allowance, right?""    
  
Lauren's lips curled in mockery. She glanced at David Bennett and Alice Pierce in the crowd and said lightly, ""Why don't you ask Mr. David and Madam Alice whether they gave me an allowance or not, Mr. Elliot? After all, you don't believe me, but you'd believe your parents, wouldn't you?""    
  
David and Alice stiffened instantly, too ashamed to meet her eyes.    
  
""Dad, Mom, you must have given her an allowance, right?"" Elliot looked at them seriously.    
  
David avoided his gaze. ""I thought you guys would give it to her, so I...""    
  
Alice's face was filled with guilt, tears welling in her eyes. She said painfully, ""I thought you guys would... Laurie, why didn't you say something sooner? If you had told me earlier, I would have given you money. It's my fault. I didn't realize it in time, and you suffered for it. But you have to believe that I treat you and Willow the same.""    
  
Lauren looked at her with a half-smile, her gaze indifferent. Under her cold stare, Alice lowered her eyes awkwardly.    
  
Only today did Lauren find out that it was her own birth mother who had ordered the finance department not to send her money. Not only that, but she had also raised Willow's allowance to 140,000 dollars, afraid that her precious adopted daughter might feel slighted.    
  
With such blatant favoritism, Alice still had the audacity to claim she treated them equally.    
  
As the esteemed wife of a wealthy family, Alice wore only the finest clothes, with even her socks costing dozens of dollars. There was no way she couldn't tell that her own daughter was wearing an outfit that cost less than 14 bucks in total.  
  
Of course, she knew. She just didn't care.    
  
This apology was nothing more than an act for the public.    
  
Fortunately, Lauren had long seen through the ugliness of this family. Her heart had been hardened, immune to their poison. Without expectations, she remained unshaken.    
  
Seeing Lauren ignore her mother's apology, humiliating the Bennett family in front of everyone, Elliot's fleeting guilt instantly vanished.    
  
He scolded coldly, ""You have a mouth, don't you? Why didn't you just say something? We're not mind readers; how were we supposed to know what you were thinking? If you had spoken up earlier, do you think we wouldn't have given you money?""    
  
""I did."" Lauren's voice was soft but laced with coldness. ""You just didn't take it seriously.""    
  
Elliot frowned, about to deny it, when a memory suddenly surfaced in his mind.    
  
It was an afternoon long ago. Their family of four sat on the couch, chatting and laughing.    
  
Lauren walked over hesitantly, clutching the hem of her school uniform. Before she even spoke, her face flushed bright red.    
  
She struggled for a long time before finally whispering, ""Dad, Mom, can you give me the tuition fee of 700...""    
  
*Bang!*    
  
Elliot slammed his newspaper onto the coffee table, glaring at Lauren. ""Money, money, money! Is that all you care about? Did you come back to this family just to ask for money? If the Bennett family had no money, would you have even bothered to return? I don't know why Mom and Dad insisted on bringing you back. If you have nothing better to do, go study. Willow ranked tenth in the whole school in her first monthly exam. What about you?""    
  
""I... I got first place....""    
  
""Enough. You mean dead last, right? And you still have the nerve to bring it up?""    
  
He had already arranged for the finance department to deposit 70,000 dollars into her card every month, yet she dared to open her mouth and ask for money.    
  
Even Willow didn't receive that much, so she had no reason to think she deserved it.  
  
Lauren's tears fell instantly, as if she had suffered a great injustice.    
  
Elliot only felt irritated, even losing the mood to read his financial newspaper.    
  
Luckily, Willow was understanding. She tugged on his arm and pouted. ""Elliot, I ranked tenth this time. Do I get a reward?""    
  
He couldn't resist his sweet little sister acting cute. Instantly, all his annoyance from Lauren disappeared. Pinching Willow's cheek, he doted on her. ""Willow, what do you want?""    
  
""I saw a handbag worth 14,000 dollars. Elliot, will you buy it for me?""    
  
""Of course. If you like it, I'd even buy one for 140,000 dollars.""    
  
After spoiling Willow, he turned back to Lauren with a scowl. ""Why are you still standing here? Go back to your room and study.""    
  
Lauren bit back her grievances and ran away.    
  
David and Alice sighed at the same time. ""If only Laurie were half as sensible as Willow.""    
  
...  
  
""Mr. Elliot, have you remembered?""    
  
Lauren's voice pulled him back to the present. His heart twisted painfully at the way she addressed him—Mr. Elliot.    
  
He was her biological brother, not some stranger.    
  
But ever since she was released from prison, she hadn't called him by his name even once.    
  
His expression darkened, his voice laced with frustration. ""It was because you were terrible at studying. Coming in dead last, how did you have the nerve to ask for money? Even I was embarrassed for you.""    
  
Hearing this, Lauren's gaze turned even colder. Being stared at with such icy indifference, Elliot felt an inexplicable sense of guilt. He clenched his jaw and snapped, ""You don't accept criticism?""    
  
""For all three years of high school, I ranked first in my grade every year. How did I suddenly become in last place in your version of the story?""    
  
Seeing Elliot's expression of utter disbelief, Lauren smirked coldly. A sense of vindictive satisfaction rose within her. ""Then again, it's understandable. Mr. Elliot, you don't even know which school I attended. Naturally, you wouldn't know my grades.""    
  
Elliot felt like he had been struck by lightning, frozen in place.    
  
It was as if he had just heard something absurd. His voice trembled slightly, betraying a hint of hoarseness. ""You weren't attending Brightvale High School?""    
  
Brightvale High School was the most prestigious school in Hoverdale. Willow had graduated from there, and all the wealthy and powerful families in the city sent their children there.    
  
Elliot had simply assumed Lauren was studying there as well.    
  
His gaze snapped to David and Alice, his voice shaking uncontrollably. ""Dad, Mom, when Lauren came back, did you transfer her school records over?""    
  
Silence.    
  
David's face turned red, his lips moving soundlessly like a man who had lost his backbone. All his past authority vanished.    
  
Alice's lips quivered. Panic and guilt filled her eyes, her perfectly applied makeup unable to conceal her embarrassment.    
  
The two stood there, frozen, as if the air around them had solidified.    
  
Elliot's face turned pale, inch by inch. His previous perception of Lauren crumbled like a collapsing tower. All the disdain and condescension he had once felt now twisted into sharp blades, cutting into his own heart.    
  
His throat tightened painfully, his voice barely audible. ""Laurie, where did you go to school for those three years?""



**Chapter 5 Her Birthday Party**



Lauren's life had already been ruined, and only then did Elliot remember to care about her academics. How ironic.    
  
She had spent ten years studying desperately, hoping to change her fate. Just as her efforts were about to bear fruit, she found that they were ultimately no match for power.    
  
With a single, offhand remark, the Bennett family sealed her fate, effortlessly casting her into the deepest depths of hell.    
  
She could have had a bright future.    
  
From childhood to adulthood, she never had the advantage of a powerful family background. The only thing she could rely on was her extraordinary dedication to her studies.    
  
Her dream was to get into Northcrest University, then pursue a master's degree and a doctorate. She wanted to become a professor, to stand at the podium and use her knowledge to change the fate of those who, like her, worked tirelessly to succeed.    
  
But reality had slapped her in the face.    
  
She did not become the person she had wanted to be. Instead, she became a despised criminal, forever marked by a stain on her record.    
  
A stain that would affect three generations.    
  
Thinking of this, Lauren clenched her fists so tightly that her nails dug deep into her palms, but she felt nothing.    
  
""Hoverdale First High School."" Lauren's voice was soft, almost gentle.    
  
Yet the four words, ""Hoverdale First High School,"" weighed like a thousand-pound boulder, making David, Alice, and Elliot feel as though they could hardly breathe.    
  
Because Hoverdale First High School had the highest admission standards in all of Hoverdale.    
  
Unlike Brightvale High School, a prestigious private school where admission was secured with money, Hoverdale First High School only recognized scores, not wealth.    
  
Even among top students, she had consistently ranked first in her grade year after year. With her grades, getting into Northcrest University had been a certainty.    
  
""That's impossible. You're lying."" Elliot's emotions were on edge. ""Hoverdale First High School is in the suburbs, more than 20 miles from home. Back then, you rode that old bike every day...""  
  
Mid-sentence, Elliot suddenly realized something. The rest of his words got stuck in his throat.    
  
Watching the color drain from Elliot's face, Lauren's lips curled in mockery. ""I'd rather ride a bike than go to school with Willow. We never even attended the same school. I never ate breakfast with you because morning classes at Hoverdale First High School started at six. I had to wake up at four to bike for two hours just to get there. I never came home for lunch because there wasn't enough time to bike back. I didn't have money for food, so I just drank more water to hold on until evening. By the time I finally got home, you had already eaten. All that was left for me was cold leftovers, and even then, you mocked me, saying I had a lowly fate, that I preferred eating scraps over hot food, that I devoured leftovers like a starving ghost...""    
  
""Laurie, I'm sorry."" Alice's tears fell like broken pearls, her sobs heart-wrenching. ""I didn't know you suffered so much. It's all my fault.""    
  
""There's nothing for you to apologize for."" Lauren looked at Alice's tear-streaked face, her heart as calm as still water. ""I wasn't raised by you. It's understandable that you feel nothing for me. I've long been used to this. A little more suffering wouldn't have made a difference. Don't you agree, Madam Alice?""    
  
Alice's sobs hitched.    
  
*Laurie, I'm begging you. You're stronger than Willow; you can endure hardship. You took care of yourself just fine in the orphanage, so I believe you'll manage in prison too. Please, take the fall for Willow.*    
  
A five-year-old memory came surging back. Alice looked stricken, clutching her chest as if she were about to faint.    
  
Lauren watched coldly as Alice swayed unsteadily. Her heart was full of contempt.    
  
The place where Willow had pushed Elaine down the stairs had surveillance cameras.    
  
But after the incident, Alice had immediately erased the footage that could have proven Lauren's innocence. That was why Lauren had been unable to defend herself in court.    
  
""Enough!"" Elliot snapped at Lauren, his voice cold. ""Stop being so bitter. We neglected you and that was our oversight. But do you really bear no responsibility at all? You were jealous that Willow had a better life than you, so you bullied her and took revenge on us. Your heart is twisted, and no one likes you. Instead of reflecting on yourself, you blame us first.""    
  
""Elliot, don't speak to your sister that way."" Alice sniffled.

1l2rtd4,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndoR4R/comments/1l2rtd4/23m_m4r_based_on_central_jakarta_looking_for_new/,"23M, M4R based on Central Jakarta looking for new friends and connections","Hello,

23M here, Jakpus born and raised. I realized that being someone with a routine of work-study-home-repeat for 6 days a week didn't really do my social life that good. Plus, I kinda feel lonely at night after all my routines when there's no one to talk to. I'm actually pretty comfortable being alone with myself but then realized it's really not good for me in the long run. I wasn’t sure about posting this here, but I figured trying is better than wondering ""what if?"". So here goes!


What I'm looking for:

• New friends and connections with people preferably around my age. Let's start it with texting first. I'm open to exchanging socials once we feel that the vibe is right. We can also do things together after some time like meet-ups, exercising, hiking, etc.

• By connection, I mean the chill, genuine type. Not that LinkedIn-type nonsense.

• I'm also open to relationships (F's only, please✌🏼). I have just broke up with my ex last year, but let's just start slow as friends and see how things flow from there😄



A bit about myself: 

• NOT a chindo, 5'6"" // 67kg, straight, ENFJ, Leo♌ (If it matters)

• Lived 18 years in JKT + 3 years in Jogja for studies

• Non practicing muslim, raised in a very westernized + liberal family. Plus I do solo travel a lot, so I'm quite open minded and not so very judgemental. Nonetheless, I'll let you know if you've crossed a line on our convos.

• I work in the Aviation sector, and a student in the evenings (kelas karyawan, trying to ""extend"" my degree from D3 to S1 in Supply Chain & Logistics with 1 semester to go. Will be doing skripsi soon.)

• I speak 4 foreign languages: English🇬🇧, Russian🇷🇺, German🇩🇪, and Dutch🇳🇱. (Listed from fluent to rusty)

• Interested in history (Especially military history🪖) and all things Aviation✈️

• I read a lot, classical literatures mostly (Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, etc.). Not really much of a movie-watcher unless someone recommends them

• I mostly listen to classical music, jazz, and EDMs but not all the time. I'm open to listening to what you love, too

• I exercise but nowadays not too much. I mostly do swimming, cycling, and very rarely running. I also am a big sucker for nature🌊🏞️🌄

• I play videogames but not so much nowadays. Mostly RTS and RPG singleplayer games on Steam🎮

• I love to journal and cook in my free time.

• I don't drink coffee, eat spicy foods, or smoke. Not really fond of sweets, too



If anything I listed clicked with you or if you just feel like chatting, please feel free to say hi! I don’t bite, you know. Unless you’re a spicy food😬 Hopefully this'll be a start of something new, too. Fingers crossed to it🤞🏼

## Key Features Analysis

The construction and design of linen shorts significantly impact their comfort, durability, and overall aesthetic appeal. Understanding these features will help you choose a pair that aligns with your specific requirements.

**Fabric Weight and Quality:** The weight of the linen fabric determines its breathability and drape.

Lighter-weight linen, typically around 4-5 ounces per square yard, is exceptionally breathable and ideal for hot weather. However, it may be slightly more prone to wrinkling and less durable than heavier weaves.Mid-weight linen, around 6-7 ounces, strikes a balance between breathability and durability, making it a versatile choice. Higher quality linen will also improve the softness of the shorts and how they feel.

**Waistband Design and Closure:** The waistband design contributes to the comfort and fit of the shorts.Elastic waistbands with drawstrings offer adjustability and a relaxed fit, suitable for casual wear situations. Button or hook-and-eye closures with a zipper fly provide a more structured and refined appearance, often preferred for smart-casual settings. Consider the type of closure that best suits your style and the intended use of the shorts. The placement and quality of belt loops, if present, also deserve consideration for those who prefer wearing a belt.

**Pocket Configuration:** The number, type, and placement of pockets enhance the functionality of the shorts.

Side seam pockets are standard and provide convenient storage for small essentials. Back pockets, whether buttoned or welted, offer additional storage and can contribute to the overall aesthetic. cargo pockets, while less common in linen shorts, provide maximum storage capacity.the depth and reinforcement of the pockets are crucial for ensuring durability and preventing items from falling out. The design of back pockets can significantly alter the overall look of the shorts, with buttoned pockets offering a more secure and customary feel.

**Seam Construction and Reinforcement:** The quality of the seam construction directly affects the durability and longevity of the shorts.

Reinforced seams, particularly at stress points like the crotch and pocket corners, are essential for preventing tearing and extending the lifespan of the shorts. Double-stitched seams provide added strength and durability. Look for shorts with clean, even stitching, as this is an indicator of quality craftsmanship. Additionally, consider the type of thread used, as higher-quality threads will be more resistant to fraying and breaking.

**Fit and Cut:** The fit and cut of linen shorts dictates their overall style and comfort.

Slim-fit linen shorts offer a modern and tailored look, while classic or relaxed fits provide more room for movement and are ideal for casual settings. The length of the shorts is also important, with shorter lengths (above the knee) being more contemporary and longer lengths (at or below the knee) offering a more conservative appearance. Consider your body type and personal preferences when choosing the fit and cut of your linen shorts. Some brands also offer different rises (waist height) which can impact comfort and style.

## Core Benefits

linen shorts offer a range of benefits that make them a desirable addition to any man's wardrobe, especially during the warmer months.

**Exceptional Breathability and Comfort:** Linen is a highly breathable fabric that allows air to circulate freely, keeping you cool and comfortable even in hot and humid weather.The natural fibers of linen wick away moisture, preventing sweat from building up and causing discomfort. this breathability makes linen shorts ideal for outdoor activities, vacations, and everyday wear during the summer.You'll notice a notable difference compared to synthetic fabrics, which tend to trap heat and moisture.

Linen shorts also come in a wide range of colors and styles, allowing you to express your personal style and create different outfits. Their inherent texture adds a touch of sophistication to any ensemble.

**Durability and Longevity:** Despite its lightweight feel, linen is a surprisingly durable fabric that can withstand regular wear and washing.High-quality linen shorts will last for years if properly cared for. The fibers of linen become softer and more comfortable with each wash, enhancing the overall experience. Investing in well-made linen shorts is a worthwhile investment that pays off in the long run.

**Natural and sustainable fabric:** Linen is made from flax fibers, a renewable resource that requires minimal water and pesticides to grow. Choosing linen shorts is an environmentally conscious decision that supports sustainable fashion practices. The natural properties of linen also make it biodegradable. This makes linen a much better investment than most synthetic materials from a sustainability perspective.

## FAQs Section

**Do linen shorts wrinkle easily?**
Yes, linen is known for its tendency to wrinkle.However, many people consider the wrinkles to be part of the fabric's charm and character. To minimize wrinkles, hang your linen shorts immediately after washing and consider using a steamer or iron on a low setting. Some linen blends also incorporate other fibers to reduce wrinkling. Embrace creases because they are inevitable when wearing linen.

**How should I care for my linen shorts?**
Linen shorts can typically be machine washed in cold water on a gentle cycle. Avoid using bleach or harsh detergents, as these can damage the fibers. Tumble dry on low heat or hang to dry. Iron on a low setting while the shorts are still slightly damp to remove wrinkles. Always follow the care instructions on the garment's label.

**What are the best occasions to wear linen shorts?**
Linen shorts are versatile and can be worn for a variety of occasions, including casual outings, vacations, beach trips, and even some smart-casual settings. They are particularly well-suited for warm weather and outdoor activities. Avoid wearing linen shorts in formal or professional environments unless specifically allowed by the dress code.

**Are linen blend shorts a good alternative to 100% linen?**
Yes, linen blend shorts can be a good alternative, offering some of the benefits of linen while reducing the tendency to wrinkle. Common blends include linen and cotton or linen and rayon. These blends can be more affordable and easier to care for than 100% linen. Though,they may not be as breathable or durable as pure linen.

1l2rlig,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1l2rlig/where_the_predators_prowl_1/,Where the Predators Prowl [1/?],"As the pink rays of morning carved up the horizon, I turned into somewhat dilapidated StrandCo gas station. Florescent lights flickered overhead, blue moths flickering in and out of existence in the pale light cast across the cracked pavement. Unflattering, blue-tinted incandescence bathed me as I pulled towards the pumps.

My 1991 Pontiac Tempest sputtered and vibrated ominously as I killed the engine, as she was offended by the interruption of my long trip across the desolate wildlands that stretched between Acadia and NUSA.

""Just a little further, we’re almost there,"" I yawned, patting the dashboard with an affectionate smile. ""Then you can rest... For a day. Then I'll need you to drive me to school, so no dying.""

The rusted Pontiac was my most glorious acquisition, procured from old man Jeremiah Elkin who lived three streets down from my parents. I got her for nine hundred dollars—every cent scraped and saved by working overtime and overnight shifts at Bowser's Basement, a dogfood packaging factory that smelled like death and paid like it too. I had no clue how Pradavarian dogs could tolerate that sort of junk packaged, plastic wrapped food that was 90% bones sometimes featuring bits of processed meat.

Eleven months of shoveling smelly meat byproducts into industrial grinders, coming home reeking of entrails and preservatives was for a greater cause, now permitting me mobility. While other kids got state-of-the-art DungeonRunners, sleek Gurrwulf Industries electrogravitic Vans, or Strand Gliders gifted by their parents, I sweated and saved for a mundane, mostly steel car that consumed gas like it was going out of style and broke down roughly every hundred miles. Still, she was mine, which was more than I could say for most things in my life.

I checked my wallet—forty-three dollars and some change. Enough for gas to reach Ferguson and maybe a coffee if I was feeling somewhat extravagant. Not for the first time, I cursed my brother and his talent for manipulation.

The golden child. The special prodigy. The one with actually functional, cherished delving skills.

I pulled up my stats with a sigh, the familiar silver text of Systemfall materializing in my field of vision.

**| Name: Alec Benoit Foster**

| Species: Human  
| Level: 3  
| Core Affinity: Reconstitution  
| Health: 67/100%  
| Reconstitution: 0/100% | Depictomancy: 4/100% | Syntropic Fusion: 17/100%

Level 3 at eighteen years old, when most serious delvers hit Level 5 by sixteen. And my shitty skills? 

Reconstitution—the ability to heal from near-fatal wounds, which sounded amazing in theory but was practically useless in my case. It sat at a glorious 0%, as it had for three weeks now. 

Depictomancy—the ability to draw pictures that became animated, even more useless. 

Syntropic Fusion—the ability to make generic, low end artifacts from random magical junk that came apart in a day or less.

I still remember the Adventurer Guild evaluator's face when she tested my mana regeneration rate. 

Ms. Thornhill, a stern-faced pradavarian owl with reading glasses perched on her sharp beak, had stared at her measuring crystal for a full minute before looking up at me with a look of pity.

""Congratulations, Mr. Foster,"" she'd said, scribbling something on my evaluation form. ""You have the slowest mana reload rate I've ever seen in a human. About one percent per month for your primary skill... umm... Reconstitution, if we're being generous.""

""Is... is that bad?"" I'd asked, already knowing the answer.

""Hrmkhh,"" she'd cleared her throat, ""You see, Mr. Foster, most delvers regenerate at least one percent per day. Your brother, for example, regenerates approximately forty seven percent of his primary skill per hour."" She'd handed me my certification card with a sigh. ""Perhaps consider a career in tax accounting?""

So here I was, with skills that recharged so slowly they were practically decorative. I could survive one deadly encounter once a year or so, assuming I didn't get completely obliterated and devoured. 

Not exactly the foundation of a promising dungeon-delving career. Unfortunately for me, a person's value in life was decided based on the effectiveness of their skills and mana reload rate.

""The perfect skill for repeatedly failing,"" my father had said once during a particularly nasty argument. ""At least you'll survive long enough to recognize your mistakes.""

My brother, Damian Foster, had been blessed with Pyrokinesis—the skill that manifested and controlled fire. Flashy, powerful, and perfect for clearing dungeons and impressing girls at pubs. Plus it recharged in minutes, not months. The cosmic unfairness of it all never ceased to irritate me.

I climbed out of the car and stretched, my joints popping in protest after hours of driving.

The gas station was one of those ancient places that hadn't been updated since the 60s. A faded sign proclaimed ""LAST STOP BEFORE HIGHWAY 69""—a warning more than an advertisement. Everyone knew Highway 69 was a death trap, a space-time looped dungeon that trapped unwary travelers in infinite cycles draining people's levels and skills.

I'd just finished filling my tank and was fiddling with the old serpentine belt that was threatening to fly off the engine again, when the rumble of motorcycle engines cut through the pre-dawn quiet. A group of five bikes pulled into the station, their riders wobbling slightly as they parked. Even from here, I could hear their wild laughter and slurred words.

*Great. Drunk pradavarians. Just what my morning needed.*

They dismounted with varying degrees of grace—an eclectic group of female prads I'd never seen before, but who had ""trouble"" written all over them. I kept my head down, focusing on tightening the damn belt, but it was already too late. I'd been spotted.

""Heeeeyyy tharr pink tater!"" A cheetah pradavarian's voice carried across the gas station, slurred but enthusiastic. ""Look, girlsss! A human! A cute, squishy little human!""

I pretended not to hear, hoping against hope they might lose interest. No such luck. The sound of boots and paws staggering toward me grew louder.

""Hey! Pay attenshnnn! I'm talkin' to you!"" the cheetah said, poking me hard in the back. ""Wass yooorrr naaaame, taterrr?""

I snapped the car hood down and turned slowly, forcing a neutral expression. The gray cheetah swayed slightly, her violet-orange eyes unfocused and drifting slightly. Her leather jacket covered in metal studs and magisteel runes was unzipped, revealing a tank top with ""SKID MARKS"" emblazoned across it, accompanied by a rather crude tire track graphic and a little heart atop of the i. A neon green mohawk sprouted between her spotted ears, clashing horrendously with her silver and white fur pattern.

""Nice jacket,"" I offered, foolishly hoping that a complement would get her off my back.

""Right?!"" She beamed, spinning around to show off the back, where a poorly drawn cartoonish cheetah on a motorcycle skidded to leave a mark in the shape of a middle finger. ""I designed and reinforced it myself! I'm Captain Adler! Pack Alpha of the most badasshh crew this side of the Supersshhtore and Highway Sixshhty Neaaain! THE SKID MARKS!""

She punctuated this by attempting to snap her fingers and failed to do so due to how drunk she was.

""Oh! And that's TurboFluff,"" she declared, ignoring my disinterested expression. She pointed across me at a lynx girl who suddenly appeared sitting on the hood of my car, methodically licking a half-eaten, extra-deep fried corn dog. ""That's Bark-n-Bite and Tequila Sunrise—"" two wolves laughing like hyenas, one of whom was now attempting to drink from the gas pump. ""And that's Lieeeutenant Donutz aka Loops!"" The cheetah waved a hand at a black and dark gray fox in a leather jacket with red stripes.

The fox smirked at me, dark gray whiskers twitching across from a dark nose. She seemed to be the most sober of the group and had the least beat up bike. The fox gave me a predatory once-over with her gray eyes while adjusting brass knuckles that spelled out ""FOX-U"" across her fingers.

""Riiiight,"" I said, calculating the distance to my car door. ""And I was just leaving, so—""

""N-uhh-uhhhhh! You ain't goin' nowhere withooout tellin' me yo name, human-tater!"" Captain Adler declared.

I pursed my lips, really not wanting to dig myself any deeper into a conversation with the biker gang.

""Shy are we?"" Adler wobbled. ""Loops, help me out, he's bein' deifffficult. Wass hiss naeeem?""

Donutz stepped closer to me and poked me in the side, her shoulder-length, jet-black hair swaying in the breeze from the distant mountains. “Identify!”

""Alec Benoit Foster,"" Her eyes ignited with silver as she looked me up and down as if I was a piece of meat. “Level 3. Reconstitution, hum? What’s that?"" She burst into laughter as her gray eyes flashed silver-violet. ""Holy shit, girls! We found ourselves a real cockroach!""

""Whats dat you-yyuu mean?” The cheetah blinked at the fox. ""Howsh he a corkroackshhh?""

""My Astral hook says his skill is mega super rare, basically he can’t die,” Donutz snickered, leaning against my car and blocking the door handle with her behind.

“What, like legit can’t die? At all? What’s the downside?” TurboFluff asked.

“The downside is that it reloads slowly,” I said. “Now if you don’t mind I’d like to get back on the road.”

“Oh? Wherrrr you headin’?” Adler asked.

""I'm headed to Ferguson,"" I said, any hope that I would be let go without being assaulted fading away like a distant dream.

""Fergushhnnon?!"" Adler spat the word like it tasted foul. ""Why the hell would a human want to go to lizard-ville?""

""Lizardville?"" I asked, inching towards my car door. 

""The Strand syndicate owns that whole damn town,"" TurboFluff interjected. ""Those scaly knobfolds think they're effin’ royalty!""

Bark-n-Bite growled, a low rumble that made the hair on the back of my neck stand up. ""My cousin from Iona tried sellin’ fried shrimps in her fast food van there without getting approval or somesheet from the raptors. Three days later, she wasssss found floating in Lake Eerie with her fur ripped off. 'Accident,' 'ey called eet. She had to spend like four grand on a healer! Couldn't even memba' what happened to her!""

""Those raptor beerches run everything,"" Adler affirmed. ""They think they own the fooking air you breathe there. You go to Ferguson, little dum’ human tater, you basically become raptor n' co property soon as ya cross dattt city obllishhkk ward line.""

""They do love collecting humans,"" the fox added with a sneer. ""You could end up as an exotic pet for the Strand daughters if you got a rare skill like that Reconstitution of yours. Wanna be in a pretty, gold collar serving drinks to lizards your entire life?""

“Serving drinks?” Bark-n-Bite laughed. “As if! If he can’t die they’ll totes use him as target practice at the arrow range or make him fetch golf balls while they aim for his face!”

I frowned.

""Ya, dude,"" Tequila Sunrise added. ""Turn that rustbucket of yours around and go anywhere else. Anywharrr! The Strands eat little humans like you for breakfast—literally sometimes."" She burst into drunken snickering at her own dumb joke.

""I appreciate the warning,"" I said, ""but my grandfather is expecting me and—""

Adler's muscular hand shot out, gripping my shoulder tightly. ""Grandfather, eh? Pffff. No. You know what? No! We're doing you a favor. No human should be in raptorrrr territory. You're coming with us instead!""

More hysterical laughter. 

“You acshulley wan’ to keep this one, Addie? A level thpffrree?! For realsies?” TurboFluff laughed so hard, she fell off my car hood, dropping her corn dog. “Shit!” She caught it in the air a second before the snack hit the ground, her figure blurring as she moved with the ludicrous speed of a dungeon delver.

""Why not?"" Addie declared, left hand claws digging even harder into my jacket and making me wince. ""I ain’t ever heard of a Reconstitushhhion. S’ounds rare n’ sheet’. You're like a little cockroach, like Donutz says, ya? Squish, squish, but you keepss coming back?""

She demonstrated this by poking me repeatedly in the chest, each ""squish"" punctuated with another jab of her claw.

""Let go of me,"" I ground out.

""Nugh-huh,"" Addie's expression changed, her drunken playfulness taking on a more predatory, jagged blade edge. ""Y'know,"" she slurred, ""I think I'm gonna claimmm you.""

I squinted at her.

""Yeah. I’ma claim. Yooou."" She repeated slowly, as if I were particularly dense. ""My own cute, adrrkable fetchling. You're perfect! Low level, so you can't fight back much. But you'll never really die! Perfect toy for when I'm bored! Humanshh break so easily! But you can't break cus you're immortal, n' sheet, raaight?”

Before I could say anything else to rebuff her advances, Addie thrust her right hand down the front of her leather pants, digging around for a moment with a look of drunken concentration. When she extracted her hand, her fingers glistened with what I absolutely refused to mentally catalog as anything other than ""pradavarian moisture.""

""Hold still frrrr me, cuuutie,"" she slurred, going down on one knee and then proceeded to smear her fingers directly across my face, drawing glistening streaks from my forehead to my chin. I suspected that it probably smelled something awful, but had no idea how awful exactly on the account that my brother ‘accidentally’ obliterated my sense of smell a few months ago by using me as target practice for his spellchain experiment.

""There!"" the cheetah declared proudly, wiping her fingers on my shirt for good measure. ""Now any prad knob who sniffs you will know you're my human! Ke ke ke. Come on, leave that junk car here, you can ride in front of me like a good toy boy. We goin’ Superstore delvin’! Trrrstt me—you'll love eet!""

""I am NOT your human,"" I shoved her away, heading for my car door. ""Piss off.""

Addie's eyes widened, then narrowed dangerously. ""Did you just push me?"" The slur in her voice had reduced somewhat, replaced by an annoyed growl.

""I did,"" I confirmed. ""And I'm not going anywhere with you drunks!""

""Oooooh,"" the gathered prads chorused, like teenagers witnessing a schoolyard challenge.

""Girls,"" Addie said, her green mohawk swaying, ""I think our new pet needs some obedience training.""

My hand slid into my pocket, fingers wrapping around a small plastic bottle I always kept there. As a human in a world full of pradavarians, I'd learned a few survival tricks. One of the best: pocket ground pepper. Strong enough to overwhelm any prad's sensitive nose and temporarily disable their tracking ability, especially those in cycle who relied heavily on scent.

I waited until Addie took one step toward me, then whipped out the pepper container, flicked off the cap with my thumb, and flung a cloud of fine black pepper directly into her face.

The effect was immediate and spectacular. The gray cheetah’s eyes bulged, her pupils contracting to pinpoints. For one frozen moment, she didn't react—then she erupted into the most violent sneezing fit I'd ever witnessed. Each sneeze sent her mohawk quivering, her entire body jerking with the force of it.

""What the—ACHOO!—fuck did you—ACHOO!—you little—ACHOO!"" She couldn't even complete a sentence between explosive sneezes.

The other prads stared in momentary shock, giving me the opening I needed. As Donutz was still blocking my car door with her fox butt and black tail, I bolted past the incapacitated cheetah, making a beeline for the gas station's mini-mart, hoping to draw them in and confuse their senses once they were inside. 

Drunk as they were, pradavarians still possessed inherent agility that put humans to shame. Donutz was on me in seconds, tackling me from behind and sending us both crashing into a display of windshield washer fluid.

""Got ya!"" she crowed triumphantly, as blue liquid soaked through my clothes.

I grabbed the nearest canister, capped it open and splashed it into her face, making her cry out. The distraction gave me enough time to scramble out of her black claws and rush toward the automotive section.

As I rounded the corner, I yanked a small plastic can from my belt loop—a pocket fogger I'd bought from a street vendor in Memphis after one too many pradavarian encounters. Advertised as ""instant privacy for humans,"" it was essentially a miniature smoke bomb that released a cloud of harmless but very dense, smelly vapor. Perfect for confusing prad senses.

""Get back here!"" Addie barked somewhere behind me, her voice still thick with sneezes.

""He's heading for aisle three!"" TurboFluff shouted.

I pulled the pin on the fogger and tossed it behind me, diving behind a chip display as thick white smoke billowed out, filling the store. Prad vision relied heavily on motion detection and thus the smelly smoke complicated their tracking.

""What the... Aghgh?! I can't see shit!"" Bark-n-Bite yelped, tripping on something.

""Use your nose, idiot!"" Tequila Sunrise shot back.

""I can't! This shit stinks something awful!""

“Then use your hearing and Astral sight! Slayer!” Adler barked, sounding like she walked into a shelf that toppled it over.

I crawled quietly toward the back of the store, reaching for another item from my jacket—a small electronic device that looked like a key fob but was actually an effective pradavarian deterrent. Another street purchase. The fob emitted a high-frequency sound imperceptible to humans but intensely deafening and annoying to prad ears. I'd only used it a few times before, to escape an aggressive raccoon prad girl who kept following me home from school trying to ‘claim’ me.

I pressed the button and heard immediate results—howls of discomfort from all directions.

""Ack! My ears!"" The fox screeched nearby.

Using the distraction, I grabbed the first potential weapon I could find—a steel snow brush with an ice scraper on the end. Not exactly fearsome, but marginally better than my human hands.

I also pulled a small can of wasp spray from my jacket pocket, holding it in my left hand.

Bark-n-Bite appeared through the smoke, brandishing a tire iron. ""Here, roachy, roachy,"" she taunted, swinging it lazily.

I ducked under her swing and swung the metal snow brush into her exposed shins with as much force as I could muster. Pradavarian or not, certain anatomical weak points remained universal. She doubled over with a high-pitched yelp. Before she could recover, I sprayed the wasp killer directly into her face.

""GAH! MY EYES!"" she shrieked, dropping to all fours and pawing desperately at her face. “Gfffuuuukk it buuuurns!”

""He hit Barky!"" TurboFluff gasped from somewhere in the smoke.

""Get him you useless knobs!"" Addie ordered.

I didn't let myself get caught.

I darted between aisles, swinging my pathetic snow brush at any prad shins that got too close. They pursued with drunken focus, knocking over displays, slipping on spilled washer fluid, and occasionally crashing into each other when their blind and deaf coordination failed them.

I managed to land a solid hit on TurboFluff's shoulder with the ice scraper, which earned me a retaliatory swipe that tore my shirt and jacket and left four parallel claw marks across my side. Donutz cornered me by the refrigerated drinks, but I grabbed a bottle of soda, shook it violently, and sprayed it in her face when she lunged.

She howled, failing to grab onto me.

As my enemies seemed to be effectively confused and blinded, I made a break for the door. Thankfully, my pocket fogger was still pumping smoke through the store. For a moment, I thought I might actually escape, but then I heard Addie's voice, suddenly clear of any slurring.

""Shadowstep.""

The word rang with power, her delver skill activating. Then she was simply gone from behind me—only to reappear directly in front of me, blocking my path to the door.

""Cleverrrr human,"" she grinned. ""But now I'm mildly annoyed with ya.""

I aimed my wasp spray at her face, but just as I pressed the nozzle, she vanished again, the spray hitting empty air. A split second later, pain exploded in my back as claws raked across my spine. I stumbled forward, nearly falling.

""Too slow,"" she whispered in my ear, appearing at my left side.

I swung at her, but she was already gone. The other prads had gathered at the edges of the now clearing smoke, forming a loose circle around me.

""You made this much more fun than expected,"" Addie's voice echoed, seemingly from two separate locations. ""But playtime's overrr. Tek - blind him!""

Tequila Sunrise raised her hands, which began to glow with an amber light. ""Sensory Override,"" she intoned.

Instantly, my vision blurred, colors and shapes becoming indistinct. Sounds stretched and warped, and my sense of balance vanished entirely. I staggered, nearly throwing up as my perception of the world wobbled and twisted, my inner ears going berserk.

""My turn,"" a blurry Donutz grinned, pulling what looked like a small red candy from her pocket. ""Speed Multiplier,"" she said, throwing the candy into her mouth and cracking it with her canines. Red energy coursed over her body.

She vanished from where she stood and swatted at me a few times, sending the wasp spray and snow brush flying from my stinging hands.

Her next kick and my scrambled senses sent me crashing into a shelf instead. Disoriented and concussed, I fumbled in my pocket for anything else that might help. My fingers closed around my last resort—a small electric stunner, barely enough to take down a normal prad, but likely useless against delvers with active skills.

TurboFluff circled me. ""Look at him flailing,"" she giggled. ""Like watching a baby try to fight.""

Addie's laughter came from somewhere on my left, a clawed paw swatting at my jacket and tearing it into shreds.

I lunged toward the sound of her voice, swinging my stunner wildly. By sheer luck, it connected with something solid. There was a satisfying crackle of electricity and a surprised yelp.

""Ouch! You little shit!"" Addie materialized fully, one hand clutching her side where I'd tagged her with the stunner. ""That fookin' hurt!""

""There's more where that came from,"" I bluffed, brandishing the stunner like it was a deadly weapon instead of the pradavarian equivalent of a bee sting.

""Enough games,"" Addie growled. ""Donutz, hold him!""

Before I could react, the fox flashed behind me, her prad strength making my struggles useless as she pinned my arms behind my back with her claws. The stunner clattered to the floor.

""You put up a good fight, little tater,"" Addie said, approaching me with slow deliberation of a victorious villain. ""Most of your kind would have been curled up crying by now. I'm… impressed.""

""Ohh, someone's actually impressed Addie,"" TurboFluff cackled. ""Das' imprrressive!""

""Yes. However, hitting your new Alpha is a big no, no,"" the cheetah tisked. ""So a small lesson in obedience is due.""

What followed was a methodical, vicious takedown. Addie started with my face, her claws carefully avoiding my eyes but leaving bloody furrows across my cheeks. Bark-n-Bite, recovered from the wasp spray, focused on my torso, each punch carrying the force of a sledgehammer against my ribs.

TurboFluff seemed particularly interested in shredding my clothes, her claws reducing my jacket, shirt and jeans to tattered rags hanging from my limbs. My outfit didn't survive her swips for very long, strips of fabric fluttering to the floor.

""Nice abs,"" she commented, dragging a claw down my exposed stomach. ""Shame about the rest of you.""

Tequila Sunrise stood back, maintaining her Sensory Override skill, ensuring that each blow and slice was accompanied by disorienting waves of confusion that made it hard to escape the fox's arms.

The worst part wasn't the pain—though there was plenty of that. It was the methodical, almost casual way they dismantled me. They weren't in a hurry. They weren't even particularly angry anymore. This was entertainment for them, a diversion from their drunken road trip to the Infinite Superstore dungeon.

""You know the problem with humans?"" Adler asked, landing a particularly nasty kick to my side. ""Humans are so fragile, but you never learn your place. Always thinking you can outsmart us!""

""To be fair,"" one of them grunted, ""he nearly did. That pepper trick got you down for a bit.”

""For a bit doesn't fuking count,"" Addie replied, grabbing a handful of my hair and jerking my head back. ""When you're dealing with pro delvers, human, your little tools and toys don't mean shit. We bend reality. You just... break. Come on, beg for mercy. Show me your place.""

Another blow, this time to my stomach, drove all of the air from my lungs. I would have doubled over if Donutz wasn't holding tightly me upright.

*Yep. Drunk prads with delver skills. A human's worst nightmare.* I thought blearily as I was kicked, clawed and punched.

I refused to beg and simply glared at them, blinking sweat and blood out of my stinging eyes. It was possibly the stupidest choice I could have picked since looking at a prad without bowing meant you challenged their authority. But, I refused to look down in submission, refused to break as Adler encouraged.

I was already kicked out of my home, at the end of my rope. This victory however, tiny wasn't for me—it was for all humans oppressed and forced into collared servitude by the pradavarian corps in their territories.

By the time they finished, I was a bloody, swollen mess of bruises and claw marks. My clothes hung in random tatters, barely preserving my modesty. The fox finally released me, and I crumpled to the floor like a marionette with its strings snapped off, not able to even curl into a defensive ball. Even so, I glared at them with a single functional eye.

""Girls,"" Addie said, wiping blood—my blood—from her claws, ""Time to take out the trash!""

The lynx and wolf hoisted me up, one grabbing my arms, the other my legs. They dragged me outside, heading behind the shop and laughing. I didn't bother struggling at this point; everything hurt too much.

""One,"" they began counting, swinging me like a battering ram.

""Two,"" Addie joined in, laughing loudly.

""THREE!""

I sailed through the air in an inglorious arc, landing with a squishy thud in the large, metal dumpster behind the gas station. The impact knocked what little breath I had left out of my lungs, leaving me wheezing amidst coffee grounds and mysterious sticky substances.

""Well, that was rahter fun,"" Addie's voice drifted over the edge of the dumpster. 

""Wait, wait! Why are we throwing him out? What about your claim?"" Donutz asked, sounding very frantic for some reason.

""Cus' he smells like blood, pepper, smoke and windshield washer fluid now. Ugh. I might ‘ave overdone it,"" Captain Adler commented. “S’ides we’re on a schedule. The Superstore silver entry ticket is gon’ expire if we don't use it for today’s delve. We gotta train him up a beeet and raise that low-ass level - I don’t want my human-tater eaten in the dungeon by a staple spider. We’ll get him on our way back after he cleans himself up n’ shit. Loops, tag him as our property!”

“Mkay,” Donutz bent into the dumpster, looming over me. She bit her finger and scribbled something on my forehead. “Tag target! Astral binding!"" She drew a jagged, sideways number eight on her own forehead and then vanished for a moment. In another minute her head appeared once again over the dumpster edge. ""Dagaz Rune, triangle formation, absolute, unbreakable bond! Condition...”

She muttered something under her breath, a word of power that sounded like it came from three eldritch mouths at the same time. Reality around her wobbled sideways for a split second with an ocean of violet stars.

A blue-violet hexagrammic spiral shaped like a number eight inside an eight-pointed star ignited on her index finger and a violet spell struck me in the head, temporarily blinding me.

**\[Personal Status Added: Property of the SKID MARKS biker gang. Dagaz-Bound of Lieutenant Donutz and Captain Adler.\]** Violet-blue sparks danced across my eyes.

There was a rustling sound, then Addie's spotted gray face appeared over the edge of the dumpster. ""Oh, right. Almost forgot.""

She hoisted herself up, balanced precariously on the edge, and pulled down her pants. I got a view of her naked ass and crotch and quickly closed my eyes as hot liquid splashed across my chest and face, mixing with the blood from my numerous cuts and seeping into open wounds with a stinging sensation that made me hiss.

""There!"" she declared proudly, zipping back up. ""Now he's officially max-claimed!""

I lay there in shocked silence, struggling to process the absolute degradation. Being beaten was one thing—I'd had my share of prad beatings over the years. 

But this... this was something else entirely. I felt something inside me shrivel and die—some final fragment of dignity or self-respect that had somehow survived eighteen years of being human in a pradavarian-filled world.

""Guys? Can we go now?"" Bark-n-Bite whined. ""I need hangover food.""

""Yeah, yeah,"" Addie agreed. ""Let's hit the Superstore. I need new gloves anyway. These have blood all over them now.” Her head appeared over the dumpster as she winked at me. “Heal up’ with yo skeel, make yourself look presentable n’ shit. I’ll be back for ya tonight. Don’t go to Ferguson. Just hang around here, ye?""

A few very crumpled dollar bills rained down on me. ""Here. Buy yourself something nice to wear. Got it? Good. See ya later, Alec-tater!""

The roar of motorcycles signaled their departure, leaving me alone in my fragrant new accommodations, covered in blood, washer fluid, trash and pradavarian bodily fluids. I lay there for a moment, cataloging my injuries—probably broken ribs, definitely a split lip, rapidly swelling eye, various claw marks across my chest and arms, and a dignity so thoroughly decimated it might never recover.

""Story of my fucking life,"" I muttered, struggling to sit up among the trash.

It took nearly fifteen minutes of painful effort to haul myself out of the large dumpster, using an old, half-busted crate as a step. Each movement sent fresh waves of agony through my battered body. I limped toward the gas station bathroom, dripping blood across the concrete.

Inside the mini-mart, an old bulldog pradavarian stood behind the counter, methodically mopping up the mess from my chase. He looked up as I staggered in, leaving bloody footprints on his freshly mopped floor, and gave me a once-over with bloodshot eyes that had seen it all.

""Bathroom?"" I croaked.

He jerked a thumb toward the back. ""Key's on the hook.""

I shuffled over, grabbed the key attached to a massive wooden block, and continued my painful journey toward the bathroom. Before I reached it, the old dog called out.

""Hey, human.""

I paused, turning slowly to face him.

""You smell… marked,"" he observed unnecessarily.

""Thanks for the insight,"" I managed, spitting out a cracked tooth.

He reached under the counter and tossed something at me—I flinched but managed to catch it. A first aid kit, old but serviceable.

""Thirty bucks,"" he grunted.

I squinted at him.

“Expensive, ye, but there’s a marking eraser dry shampoo in that kit,” he said. “Smells like she got you real good, it’ll get most of it off you.”

“Thanks,” I dropped all of Adler’s crumpled twenty dollar bills on the counter, not bothering to count them. “For the brush and any damage. I’ll grab some clothes too.”

""S'aight, I got delver insurance. Not your first rodeo, is it, kid?"" he asked, eyeing me with mild interest. “Pepper, pocket fogger, high-frequency emitter and a wasp spray, was it?”

I shrugged as I grabbed clothes from the shelves that were approximately my size, wincing as pain shot through my shoulders.

""Got most of them in Memphis,"" I muttered. ""Street vendors.""

""Smart,"" he nodded approvingly. ""That stuff works on regular prads. But didn't help much against a pack of delvers, did it?""

""Almost did,"" I said defensively.

""Almost gets you in dumpsters."" He chuckled, a phlegmy sound deep in his chest. ""Girls are nothing but trouble, but prad girls?"" He shook his head. ""They'll chew you up and spit you out, then come back for seconds. My advice? Stick to human girls when you get to Ferguson. Less exciting, sure, but you'll live longer.""

I shrugged.

""And kid?"" he called after me. ""Whatever you're running from? Probably better than the town you’re heading to.""

“Ain’t nowhere for me to get back to,” I said. “They... uhh... tagged me magically too. Any idea how to get that off me?”

“Hrmmm,” the old bulldog rubbed his chins. “Anyone with a Binder-tagger-skill or a nullifier scrubber might be able remove such, but it def' won’t be cheap.”

“Ain’t got much in terms of funds,” I sighed.

“The Hare Krishna temple in Ferguson might do it for free,” he added. “But… you will have to do some service for the temple. Nothing too straining from what I recall and they do provide room and board and one of them orange robes to wear. I used to volunteer there back in the day.”

""Thanks for the advice,"" I muttered, pushing open the bathroom door.

I locked the bathroom door behind me and finally faced myself in the grimy mirror. The sight was even worse than I'd imagined. My face was a mess of blood and bruises, one eye swollen completely shut. Four parallel claw marks ran from my left temple to my jaw. My chest was a canvas of bruises and lacerations, some still oozing blood, some new, but many others old.

I spent the next hour cleaning up as best I could, then bandaging myself up using the entire first aid kit and still having wounds left over. I dumped what remained of my clothes into a trash bin.

The hoodie I grabbed from the shop turned out to be a dark gray and orange tourist-trap garish one, proclaiming ""I SURVIVED HIGHWAY 69!"" in neon green letters with a holographic infinity sign on the back that turned into a number eight depending on the angle. Fitting, considering I hadn't even reached the highway yet.

Back in my car, I sat motionless, trying to decide what to do next. I could turn around, head back South to human territories with my metaphorical tail between my legs. Try to get by without finishing school, maybe find a part time job, apprentice under a human tradesman. Or I could continue to Ferguson, find a grandfather I've never talked to, go to where the raptor mafia awaited which was apparently far worse than the biker gang.

Neither option seemed particularly appealing.

I pulled out my cracked-screen phone, thumbing through Pradstagram to distract myself from the pain and humiliation. I told myself I was just checking out potential classmates at Ferguson High, but that was a lie. I was hiding in the digital world because the real one had just kicked my ass.

I slowly began to scroll through the #FergusonHigh feed.

A raptor girl with emerald and violet feathers and amber-gold eyes. She gave a thumbs up to the camera and then pulled out a delving sword. Flashing from one spot to another she obliterated several massive trees, making them careen sideways. Meh. Any idiot can slice shit with a magic sword. I blessed her with claws down and scrolled lower.

A male raptor with crimson-tipped feathers posing in front of Ferguson High's imposing stone archway. His caption read: ""New TA of Theoretical Dungeon Mechanics! Just transferred from T-dot back home! Watch out freshmen, this semester's gonna be BRUTAL #RaptorPride #StrandFamilyLegacy""

The post had over 700 likes and comments ranging from congratulatory to outright fawning.

Next came a group photo of what appeared to be the Ferguson Firestorm—the school's elite delving team. Seven raptors in matching black and gold hexmesh uniforms, surrounded by trophies and medals. Their stats hovered above them in holographic displays—not a single one below Level 30.""

Regional delver champions for the fifth year running! #UnstoppableForce #FearTheRaptors"" read the caption.

*Great. All of the signs pointed that the raptor mafia was quite real and not just the drunken rumblings of the local biker gang.*

I threw claws down at the raptor girl and scrolled past ads for dungeon gear and local Ferguson businesses, most prominently featuring ""Strand Enterprises: Making Strand Gliders and magitek weapons now in collaboration with Gurrwulf Industries! Invest in the future!""

More scrolling revealed a candid shot of what appeared to be Ferguson High's campus quad. Raptors and dogs dominated the frame, lounging on manicured lawns or strutting along stone pathways. A handful of other pradavarian species could be spotted—mostly wolves and foxes, with the occasional feline and bird. Humans were few and far between, and those present seemed to be keeping to themselves, heads down, moving quickly between buildings.

*Just peachy, the humans seemed to be a minority in town.*

Driving back to mostly human territory suddenly seemed like a better option. But then again, the damned bikers would likely chase me down if I didn't get rid of their magic tag soon.""First day vibes #FergusonH #FreshmanYear"" The caption was from a young hyena pradavarian who looked equal parts excited and terrified.

I was about to give up when my thumb encountered a picture of a dog standing in front of what looked like a 50's Atomic Punk cafe. A female black and white husky pradavarian with striking blue eyes and white markings on her forehead that resembled angel wings. 

The post was a video tagged: ""A new song for you out there! Keep going! Don't give up! \~Ness.""

I plugged my phone into the car speakers and clicked on play. Her eyes struck me, my heartbeat accelerating. Her voice came out, soft and haunting and resonant.

“Beaten down but never broken,  
Rising from the ashes, spoken  
Words that heal and guide your way,  
Sunlight breaks before the day.

Don't let darkness be your master,  
Though the road seems filled with disaster,  
Keep your heart on what's ahead,  
Focus forward, never dread.”

I stared at the screen, mesmerized by her voice. There was something about the melody, something that seemed to speak directly to my current situation—beaten, humiliated, but still moving forward. Her voice synced too well with the music. Was her singing some kind of a skill? It sounded too perfect, too wholesome.

""In this world of teeth and claws,  
Where might makes right and strength makes laws,  
Find the courage deep within,  
To lose it all and still to win.""

I gave her a paws up and then I saw the tags.

**#Nessy\_Whitepaw\_music #AtomicCafe #Bestchocolate\_latte! #FergusonShops #Will’sWheels #Autorepair\_cheap!**

With a sigh, I started the engine. 

The song was obviously not about getting beaten up and claimed by asshole bikers, but instead was some kind of cheeky marketing campaign for the local shops.

The Tempest protested but eventually rumbled to life. Ferguson was still a few hours away. The sun had risen blinding me as I pulled back onto highway 70, my bruised body protesting every bump in the road.

I didn't know what awaited me in Ferguson. Haughty raptors. Classes I was woefully unprepared for. A grandfather I barely knew. But at that moment, bloody and claimed, I figured it couldn't possibly be worse than what I was leaving behind.

1l2rkke,https://www.reddit.com/r/medschool/comments/1l2rkke/should_i_try_for_med_school_despite_large_debt/,Should I try for med school despite large debt and gap?,"Hello all. I’m 23 and I graduated from NYU with a 3.6 in a liberal arts major two yrs ago. Stupidly, I ended up with six figures in debt with a degree that can’t even get me a job at a coffee shop. I recently have thought about going to med school after helping to diagnose a friend and feeling good about it. I also like to research obscure diseases and biology from time to time as a hobby. After hating the banking industry and realizing I need to be stimulated at work, I thought maybe I could try it as a profession as an internal medicine doctor. 

There are a few reasons tho that are really holding me back. Namely, the debt and time investment. 

I know a wise idea would be to work and save up money while taking pre req classes at a community college; however, I’m concerned with how much time that would take. As well as if my applications would suffer as a result of taking all my important science classes at a community college. One reason a community college might be better is i want to enroll in the cram type one year programs that schools have to rush prereqs. I heard that they train you the MCAT and are pretty guaranteed to get good recs. However, I just missed the cycle for the is next year, so I would have to apply this fall, wait for another year to pass, and then start school in 2027 when I’m 25. I don’t think I have the patience to twiddle my thumbs for another year and a half at my prime age while waiting for school to start again. Taking courses at CC starting this fall could help me accelerate my process to apply to med school. 

Another reason I am a little hesitant is I don’t have confidence in my intelligence. I haven’t taken a STEM course in 6+ years, so I am afraid of straight up just failing and flopping even more. I was always bad at biology and physics. I feel like I could possibly do better, but I feel like my brain is a lot less neuroplastic than it used to be. I’ve also experimented with a lot of drugs so the brain cells just might not be there. 

My main concern is time, I have a lot of anxiety and I’m afraid of spending too late of life in school. Specially, I am queer and would like to have freedoms in my life regarding where to live that I know matching residencies and applying to med school will not afford me. I would be willing to go into a little bit more debt to get to my destination faster (I’m already in so much, what’s a little more) I know many people start this process late in life, but I have a lot anxiety and existential dread I really need to do something about this now and as quickly as possible. So here are the options.

1) Ditch the plan. It’s too unrealistic and will not be fiscally possible. 

2) Take all pre req classes at local CC starting this fall. Rush to fit as many classes in as humanly possible to apply.

3) Work a job until next application cycle, start post bacc process in two years and bite the tuition fees.

Thanks so much for reading, I know it seems a little like a coke rant. Lemme know if any other suggestions. ",2,1748995595.0,medschool,7,1.0,False
1l2rkhs,https://www.reddit.com/r/malementalhealth/comments/1l2rkhs/struggling_with_feeling_not_good_enough_to_women/,Struggling with Feeling Not Good Enough to Women as a Gen Z'er,"Hi everyone! I (23) am currently struggling with some really deep and intense feelings of low worth when it comes to being appealing to women. I'm not unpleasant to look at, and I am a considerate and understanding person who loves making deeper connections with people. So as you can imagine it is kinda painful to be single because I truly want someone who I can connect with. I should mention that I have high-functioning autism and have always been a lonely guy. It did not help that some things others have said to me were rather mean-spirited. The two most painful both involve being told I will never have sex. The one that really hurts is the one where a girl said it. At least with a guy I could brush it off because I have no interest in men, but being told that by a girl messed me up. Granted this was way, way back in middle school but my mental disposition makes me fixate on things, often anxiety-inducing ones. So as a result I am completely incapable of fathoming any woman having any real interest in me, let alone ones who I would date. I'm not demanding anyone super attractive or outgoing either, because the truth is most really attractive women often don't have much substance because they don't need it. Cute, understanding, kind, smart, and having substance- all qualities any reasonable person would want. 

But I have the feeling I am completely and utterly invisible to 99 % of women- when in reality I'm not a bad potential suitor. Self-confidence does not exist with me because I have no reason to have it. I only received negative reinforcement that I am not sexually available or datable. And being rejected over and over again only makes my suspicions more accurate (at least in my messed up mind). Seeing the statistics on Gen Z's dating market doesn't help. When I read 60% of men in Gen Z are single (last I read) and furthermore only some percent of autistic men have success in dating. It is at the point where I am consuming large amounts of coffee, tea, and energy drinks so the caffeine will suppress my appetite so I can lose enough weight to become better-looking and have more defined features. To add, I am seriously considering unsafe, self-destructive efforts to become acceptable to women (including knee lengthening and the whole cornucopia of cosmetic surgeons) because I don't know what else would work. I am also slowly becoming frustrated with women themselves, which is where I realized I needed to speak up about how I am feeling. It would not be fair for me to be shunned because of who I want to date, therefore I have no right to dislike women for who they want, and furthermore no one is obligated to like me in any sense at all. I am not a bad guy and I have absolutely no interest in being one. But after so much pain I don't know how else to feel or what to do. I suppose it is natural and understandable to be bitter, but I don't want to be bitter. Life is too short for that nonsense. I also just want my experiences with women to be positive and they are outside of dating. I love women as friends, make no mistake. But I wish my dating experience was the same. I don't know guys, it outright sucks to be me at this point tbh. I have images on my profile from previous posts on r/rateme and the like and the responses are mostly positive, but I don't believe them because if it were true, you would think I wouldn't be struggling so hard, right? Am I missing something or am I just a little lost and need a hand to guide me on the right track? Or is it simply that I have been right all along? Thanks for hearing me out and reading this far about my sad, lonely life. Sorry if I ruined your day, lol. ",3,1748995589.0,malementalhealth,0,0.8,False

1l2rj6y,https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/1l2rj6y/my_kaneki_change_suggestions/,My Kaneki Change Suggestions,"After about three months of Kaneki experience, I feel like I have enough experience against him and as him (I've done both) to suggest some changes that would make Kaneki more fair and hopefully more fun.

POWER CHANGES

1: **Get rid of the animation that plays when Kaneki performs a grab attack (Don't make survivors stand still)**. I think any survivor can agree that it sucks to stay still during this, and it's not hard for Kaneki to catch up. Allow survivors to move once the attack is performed. This allows survivors to have some of their mobility back against Kaneki. I don't want to nerf Kaneki's mobility, as that is the fun part, so giving the survivors their mobility against him seems like a fair trade.

2: **Rework the Kagune Leap, so that grabbing a survivor requires you to be closer than grabbing an object (6 meters for example), while keeping the current leap to objects at 14 meters.** The current grab distance is 14 meters. Let's keep that. Instead, make it so that to grab attack a survivor, you have to be within 6 meters. This should have some effects. You have more time to react, and you're less likely to get a bug with hitting through walls from a distance since Kaneki has to come over. I WILL REPEAT THAT THE LEAP DISTANCE WHEN NOT GRABBING A SURVIVOR REMAINS THE SAME. YOU CAN BE SPIDERMAN ALL YOU LIKE.

3: **Reduce the Kagune Leap Vault Multiplier from .667 to .6.** You know what this is. Kaneki vaults pallets too fast. If this isn't enough, we can go further and do .55 or .5.

4: **Upon breaking a pallet, Kaneki now loses one token while not enraged and two while enraged.** This is to make it so that the two modes aren't so far apart in power due to how easy it is to get enraged.

5: **Reduce the Enraged Timer to 30 seconds.** I consider Kaneki's enraged mode, in an ideal world, to be similar to Plague's corrupt purge or Oni's Blood Fury. OP powers that you aren't supposed to have forever. Since it's easier to get, it shouldn't last as long.

6: **Reduce the Window for consecutive leaps** I don't have an exact number, but does Kaneki REALLY need to be able to hold it for 5 seconds?

7: **FIX THE BUGS AND KIDNAP TECH.**

ADDON CHANGES

1: **Nerf the coffee addon to at most 1 m/s and reduce it back to a common rarity.** Kaneki's movement is already powerful, and so no need to make it much more powerful. I want this as a common addon to fit a theme I have in mind with his addons , but if it's too powerful for a common the speed can be reduced further.

2: **Buff Red Spider Lily to apply Mangled as well, and turn it into a Very Rare Addon.** Red Spider LIly on its own isn't worth being very rare, and we need a new very rare to fill the gap. As such, with theming, I chose this addon.

3: **Turn CCG ID Card into a Rare Addon.** Now we need a rare addon to fill the missing slot and theming demands me pick CCG card.

4: **Buff Broken Chain to 2 sec per token and turn it into a very rare.** What this addon does is reduce the cooldown of the leap while not enraged. Plus we need a new Very Rare slot.

5: **Turn Taiyaki into an Uncommon Addon**. With the duration of Enraged now reduced, I think it's fair to say that this addon will become more viable, so turning it into an uncommon is fine with me. Besides, we have too many commons and not enough uncommons.

Credits to Mintskull, Azyhmovs, and Scott Jund for some of these ideas.

All in all, it's clear that Kaneki is a popular killer even if survivors hate him. So I tried to address the pain points while keeping the fun factor. What do you think?",0,1748995483.0,deadbydaylight,2,0.2,False

1l2rgvs,https://www.reddit.com/r/badreviewer/comments/1l2rgvs/hoover_cleanslate_xl_deep_cleaning_carpet/,Hoover CleanSlate XL Deep Cleaning Carpet Reviewed: Bad Reviewers Real-World Test,"Does a **portable carpet cleaning machine** finally exist that can erase years of coffee spills, pet disasters, and muddy footprints—without costing you a fortune or breaking your back? Enter the [Hoover CleanSlate XL Deep Cleaning Carpet](https://amzn.to/4kNiBfx), currently at a limited-time deal of $149.99 (down from $169.99). As someone with kids, dogs, and light-colored carpets, I wanted to see if Hoover’s “deep clean” hype matches the reality, especially stacked against pricier Bissell challengers. After three weeks of heavy use on rugs, stairs, and a very “active” living room, here’s my verdict.

# Performance & Deep Cleaning

The CleanSlate XL’s 7-inch wide cleaning path, dual-tank design, and powerful suction system set it apart from the bargain bin. On thick area rugs and high-traffic carpet, it pulled up old wine stains and muddy footprints in one to two passes. For fresh messes, a quick spray with Hoover’s included solution and a slow pass left the fibers basically as-new. The **CleanSlate XL pet stain remover** nozzle makes easy work of “oopsies” from both dogs and toddlers—no lingering smells, even on stubborn spots.

Compared to a full-sized rental, this **deep cleaning carpet cleaner** is lighter (just under 14 lbs empty) but brings pro-level results in a compact package. In the real world, it beats out most upright machines for spot and small-area cleaning—especially for renters and pet owners.

# Upholstery & Versatility

The standard kit includes a 2-in-1 Antimicrobial Pet Tool and Tight Spot Tool, both a godsend for stairs, car interiors, and sofas. The pet tool’s rubber bristles agitate deep-set hair and grime from upholstery; the edge cleaning nozzle grabbed debris from corners of a cloth couch in five minutes flat. As an **upholstery cleaner under 200**, this machine handled everything from juice on a recliner to mystery fridge stains on my car seat.

Switching between nozzles is easy, and everything rinses clean under a faucet. You’re not just getting a **compact rug cleaner**—it’s a full-blown soft surface rehab kit.

# Tank Size, Maintenance & Ease of Use

The 96 oz. clean/dirty water tanks mean fewer trips to the sink compared to smaller handhelds. Both tanks pop out with one hand; the dirty tank’s wide opening rinses clean with no gunk left behind. The included rinse-and-storage tray is a game-changer: snap the tool head in, fill with water, and it self-cleans both the hose and nozzle—minimizing post-cleaning mess.

All controls are thumb-level, and the trigger/suction balance is precise. Even someone new to DIY carpet cleaning will get professional results on their first try.

# Noise, Build Quality & Portability

The CleanSlate XL is not whisper-quiet (around 75 dB), but it’s much less shrill than older Hoover uprights or most Bissell SpotClean models. The plastic build is sturdy, with thick handles and latches that withstood repeated fills, drains, and accidental “kicks” under the coffee table. At just under 14 lbs, it’s easy to tote up stairs or stash in a closet.

# Pros & Cons

**Pros:**

* Impressive stain removal on rugs and upholstery
* Large 96 oz. tanks for fewer refills
* Antimicrobial pet tool and tight spot nozzle
* Self-cleaning tray minimizes maintenance
* Lightweight and easy to carry

**Cons:**

* Still noisy compared to stick vacs
* Bulky for small apartments
* Cleaning solution refills add cost
* Not ideal for large, wall-to-wall carpet spaces

# Value Proposition & Price Analysis

At $149.99 (limited deal), the CleanSlate XL undercuts similar Bissell SpotClean or Little Green Pro models by $30–$50, while out-performing most budget alternatives in suction and tank size. If you want a **carpet cleaner for pet stains** and upholstery under $200, this is a value leader. For apartments, pet homes, and busy families, it’s a clear win—especially at the current sale price.

# Final Verdict & Recommendation

  
The [Hoover CleanSlate XL deep cleans carpets](https://amzn.to/4kNiBfx), upholstery, and pet messes better than any compact rival under $200. Easy use, smart tank design, and specialized tools make it a must-have for anyone serious about spot cleaning.

Would I recommend it to pet parents, renters, and busy families? Absolutely—unless you need a full-sized, whole-house carpet washer.",1,1748995296.0,badreviewer,0,1.0,False

Pending a background check, a physical, and several other tests. I am confirmed to have a job starting here soon. Waiting has me nervous and thinking back to an event that transpired at my soon to be ex-job. 

Some background:

I work at a coffee stand within a major corporation and was told by my lead that someone would be getting fired soon. Let's call them Diamond. Diamond is a great employee but would arrive late to work once a week, bi-weekly. My lead asked me if we should inform her to use her PTO before she gets fired since there is no payout. We each messaged her and she thanked us for letting their know. I was pulled into the manager's office the fallowing day and yelled at for ten minutes because Diamond texted asking if they were fired. 

I was told I was brining down morale for my team since I was propagating rumors around the workplace. I decided then to find another job and thankfully I found one pending a few test to complete. I officially start the 20th but I am using my PTO this week under the guise of the flu. This coming Friday I will be quitting. I do not know if I want to go out with a bag or silent into that good night. Knowing some history, I was wondering if someone would give me so opinions on the topic. My significant other said I should just let it be and leave my badge and keys on the desk of the manager but I wanted to leave a message to the manager about what she said to me is incorrect.

1l2rfke,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1l2rfke/i_miss_my_exboyfriend/,I miss my ex-boyfriend,"I (26F) broke up with my ex boyfriend (26M) about a month ago because I realized I might be a lesbian.

I came across a TikTok one evening, and it was a lesbian explaining what compulsory heterosexuality (comphet) was. I’ve heard the term before, here and there, but never fully looked into it. But I stopped at this TikTok, and what she explained hit me hard, and it led me down a rabbit hole of videos. It sounded exactly like me.

But, I was dating my boyfriend. Have been for six years. We lived together, talked about marriage, kids. We met through mutual friends, and were friends for 2-3 years before we started dating. I thought I loved him romantically, until I started looking back. My mind tended to wander during romantic moments, we rarely had sex, and I just chalked it up to being a “low libido” kind of person.

It hurt to think about him, because with him in the picture, it wasn’t just about me anymore. The last thing I wanted to do was hurt him, because he never asked for this, and he’s been nothing but good to me. But I knew it wasn’t fair for either of us to stay in this relationship while I figured this out. So, I broke up with him. We had a long talk, we both cried, and he was so nice, and that almost made it hurt worse. He never blamed me, he believed me when I said I had no clue before this, and he left to go to a hotel while I stayed in the house. (I’m moving in with one of my friends soon - I broke up with him, I broke his heart. It’s not fair that I keep the house). We decided we weren’t going to talk for about three months, and then meet up over coffee. We talked about logistics, and now we’re not talking.

It’s been a month since we stopped talking, I’ve fully come to the conclusion that I am a lesbian, and I miss him. I hadn’t realized just how important he was to me, not just as a boyfriend, but as a best friend. It’s been hard trying to adjust to his absence. If I see something he would find funny, I want to text him. I think it’s him just for a second every time my phone buzzes. Little victories feel incomplete without sharing them with him. 

I think about him. Our inside jokes, our late nights, how he always made me laugh despite whatever mood I’m in. How even at my most vulnerable, he never judged me. He wasn’t just my boyfriend, he was my best friend, my confidant, my partner in crime. I turned to him for everything. Even though our romantic relationship had subconsciously been filled with doubt and uncertainty, our friendship has always felt like solid ground.

I just don’t want him to think that I’m ungrateful for all the time we shared, for everything he’s ever done for me. I can’t imagine him not being in my life anymore. What if he doesn’t want to be? What if I hurt him so bad that he doesn’t want to be friends anymore? I wasted six years of his life, time he could’ve spent with someone who actually loved him romantically. I wouldn’t blame him if he hated me for that, I wouldn’t blame him if he never wanted to talk again, but it would hurt. I think it would hurt more than I could ever imagine.

1l2rder,https://www.reddit.com/r/marriageadvice/comments/1l2rder/advice/,Advice,"Ok.

So long story short.

My wife had a close friend. S

We had a rough spot, then I caught her making out with S.
It wasn’t the first time.

We had a while apart.
Now we’re trying to work through things.

That part is what it is. 
What I’m looking for is advice on the next part.

I need advice. And please skip the usual once a Cheater always a cheater stuff, I’ve read that and I’m trying to work on my marriage.

Obviously I’m quite uncomfortable with my wife’s  relationship with S.

She’s got another male friend (F) who she messages all the time and meets for coffees at work.

I don’t know if they meet 1 on  1 outside of work becuase she’s not said who she’s been out with when she’s gone out for drinks and/or food after work but I assume they do meet up and hang out sometimes.

After what happened with S, and the fact that our relationship is in such a struggle, I’m really starting to get worried about this relationship with F becuase they seem (I think but I don’t know because I’ve tried to be decent and not looked at her phone) to talk all the time and have so much in common.

It feels a bit like I’m being replaced with someone else. I used to be the person she’d want to text and chat to all the time, now it seems like it’s him. 

Today she suggested I try to meet my friend to see a film that comes out soon.

She’s going to see family the weekend we get back from holiday (we’re away there now) she suggested that I could maybe go meet my friend on Friday to go to the cinema, and then stay there. Then she could travel down to meet me there on Saturday, then we could go to see family together. Which makes logistical sense due to locations.

A bit later she said some people at work had mentioned going out that Friday, which is why she’d thought about me seeing my friend.

I asked ‘the usual group?’ Thinking it might be her close colleagues. 

And she explained that F (the guy she’s good friends with) has lots of friends and sometimes invites her along.

Even if I was home, im already uncomfortable with their relationship given what’s going on with us right now.

But the fact she’d suggested I go away?!  My head is suddenly spinning that she wants me out of the house!!

After everything that’s happened. Am I really so insane for being worried about this?? It feels so sus and I don’t know how to not worry about it. It’d be one thing if my wife could tell me we’re great and everything’s fine with us. But she can’t even say that at the moment, so I am really concerned.

The issue is, we’re on holiday. I’d made a promise to myself to just keep the drama of my anxiety away from the holiday because I know my wife is getting tired and needed a break from the stress of work and everything going on at home.

I think if I bring anything up over other holiday she will resent me for ruining the holiday and nice break she wanted.

But if I wait till we are back, it’s Wednesday night after a loooong day of travel so we’ll both be exhausted. 

Then it’s the first day back after holiday, which is always crap becuase of jet lag and trying to catch up on work and emails and all of that stuff.

So if I bring it up then, I really think she will be mad that I dumped this shit on her the second she got home and that the nice vibes of a break were immediately ruined.

But then if not this hol, not wed, not thurs, then it’s Friday night and she’s out with him.

And I don’t know what to do.

I’m already shaking thinking about it.

It’s not just her after what happened, but F. 
He’s a single guy, a little older who loves the same things she does.

I don’t really know him at all, so I’ve no idea his character. But given how I feel about my wife, I find it hard to think he doesn’t fancy her at least a bit.

But she’s too self deprecating to think that’s a possibility, and I also don’t think she’d want to beleive it because it would then mean she’d have to treat that friendship different and doesn’t want to.

Since what happened with S, It’s not been great with us. But worst of all I’ve not seen any sign that she’s acting or treating things differently.

So throwing alcohol in the mix with this guy she has a really strong connection with, at the time our marriage is going through the worst period it has ever been in, feels like a huge risk.

And I know part of a good relationship is trust, so I should just trust that she’d not be going out if it was a risk. But the problem is everything that happened with S. How can I trust after that??

I’m really torn.

I really want to be a happy good vibes husband this holiday to show her that what we used to have isn’t gone, and that we can have a great time and after we work through this, it’ll be great.

But now I feel too paralysed by fear to do it.

But if I tell her what I’m worried about, I ruin the holiday.

If I don’t, then I run the risk of something happening.

And it’s not like ‘if she does something bad I just leave her’

Because I won’t ever know. She’ll never admit it if something happens that night. 

I really really don’t know what to do.


tl;dr my wife cheated on me with a friend. We’re working through it and on a ‘no drama holiday’

Now she has another male friend who I don’t trust who she plans to go out with when we get home. Not sure if I should ruin the holiday by asking about it? Or make the best of a good trip and trust her enough to talk about it at a more suitable time.?

1l2rbof,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1l2rbof/it_would_have_been_your_21st_birthday/,It would have been your 21st birthday,"I wrote this 7 years ago on what would have been my child’s 21st birthday…

This weekend marks your 21st birthday, and it's a reminder of the 20 years of your life that I was not involved.  But know that despite that, I've always loved you, even though you grew up never knowing me.  I want to tell you the story of your mother and I, and maybe, there's a slight chance, that you can see this, and maybe, just maybe, you'll understand, and forgive me.

Many, many years ago, I was madly in love with your mother.  Your broken, recovering addict mother who had escaped the drugs, abuse, and tormented childhood.  Your beautiful, blonde haired, blue-eyed mother who loved to dance, in the rain, or just out under the stars in the dark of night to the soft strains of country music.  Your mother who laughed and giggled as we all did a sing-a-long of Grease.  Your mother who could turn on a dime into a ferocious creature when pushed too far.  Your mother who craved love but was so afraid of it at the same time.  Your mother who was the love of my life, and the person to whom I was going to be married.  Ours wasn't the perfect relationship by any stretch.  We loved each other, but we burned bright, so it was inevitable that we'd burn hot and eventually explode.  The downfall started right after we found out about the pregnancy.

That's the point when our relationship turned.  Your mother withdrew into herself, and I was a stupid, inexperienced kid so everything I did to try to help just ended in disaster.  Our relationship started a downward spiral as she withdrew further, but still clung to me and I pushed harder in desperation to keep our family whole further driving that wedge between us no matter how hard I tried.

At first she would vacillate between telling me I would never have anything to do with your life, and begging me to take her out to prepare for our baby.  For weeks I was torn back and forth between her outbursts of anger towards me and her clinging to me and telling me I'd make a great father.  And then it all came to a head the night she told me, straight faced, that she had miscarried that afternoon and that we were done.  We fell apart.  I was devastated.  I had lost my child, I had lost my love, and nothing in my world made sense.  The two of you were my reason for going on each day.  You were my entire universe.

For weeks following that I was adrift.  I drank.  I withdrew.  I took a job far away, where I was forced to be shut in at a remote location in the forest the entire summer, and I must say that summer helped me immeasurably.  During that summer I was able to get my bearings back.  I recovered my energy and started looking for your mother.  Being cut off from everything and everyone I knew for those months probably saved my life.  I gave up trying to find her after that. I made my peace with my loss.

And I found her.  I found her outside a restaurant I’d been in hundreds of times.  It's funny how that works.  You can look and look and as soon as you stop looking, there's what you were looking for all along, right there in front of you, walking into the same restaurant you are walking out of.  We made eye contact, and I was violently tossed into dizziness and confusion.  She was pregnant.  VERY pregnant.  And I was stunned.  And here is where I failed you the first time.  Because I just looked at her, as she walked past, neither of us able to say much to each other.  And I let my best friend drag me away.  And I failed you that first time.  I have so very few regrets in my life, and that one instant is a lifetime of regret compacted into a moment so tiny.

I didnt see her again until after you were born, but see her I did.  And that led to my second failure as a young man, and as your father.  I took care of you when she worked.  I held you in my arms. I rocked you to sleep.  We'd fall asleep together on the couch, you on my chest, clutching my fingers with your tiny hand.  I'd sit with you in my arms in that old rocking chair that my grandfather used to rock me in when I was your age.  And all that time I was so grateful to hold you and yet so frightened and weak. I know now, I knew then but was too afraid and stupid to act, that I should have fought hard for you.  I should have fought her for you.  I should have fought her for custody.  But I didn't.  I was weak and afraid, and so confused.  The cost of our relationship had devastated me mentally, and emotionally.  It took me years to recover, and in many ways, even today, decades later, I'm still broken by what happened between us.  I loved her so much, that when it was gone, I was left empty, shattered, a ghost.  The hopeless romantic that I was, the me that wrote poetry and bought flowers and made ridiculously complex gestures of love died back then.  I've never been the same since.

I'm not making excuses, I just want you to understand where I was then and why I failed you. Why I didn't have the courage to fight for you.  But know that those days were the happiest of my life.  Seeing your beautiful eyes, your smile and laugh.  Feeling your tiny hands holding onto mine.  I've never had any moment so bright in my life as that.

Just before your second birthday, Your mom disappeared for good, taking you with her. I tried then tracking her down, and tried for years to find her, but to no avail.  She moved from state to state, trying to get her life together.  She was married several times, had two more children, your brothers.

One day, many years later, I was on Facebook idly searching the names of people I'd lost contact with.  Something inside me told me to search for her.  I'd done this many times in the past, searching the web for news, mentions, accounts, any hint of where she had gone, but the search was always fruitless.  But something deep inside told me to try again that day, and there she was.  After almost 14 years, there she was.  So I reached out.

At this point, if this were a romance movie, this is where we would rekindle that lost spark, work out some sort of old angst, and finally, after overcoming that final obstacle, find ourselves wrapped around each other and preparing to live happily ever after as the music and credits begin to roll.  But this isn't a romance movie, and none of that happened, and to be frank, I'm glad it didn't.  I don't think, now, after so many years, I ever could have rekindled our old relationship had I wanted to.  We had both grown, both gotten older, and for her, far wiser and less... less chaotic.  I was married, happily, she was divorced, again, but had you and your two brothers and the dogs and that was all she needed.  My anger towards her had long since been replaced with just sorrow, and still that love was there.

Oh it was different, that love. I didn't feel that same love for your mom like I did when we were in our 20s.  But I felt that love for her that you can only feel for someone who had once meant everything to you.  That small spark of love that you never quite let go of. That you can only feel for the mother of your child.  And so we met together, in that greasy diner on Wildwood where we had spent so many nights recovering from a night of drinking, or where we'd just hang out, talking, laughing and enjoying each other.

I admit I was afraid, but once we finally met in person, after all these years, that fear went away and for once I had the courage to push the issue.  Where is Deven?  How is he?  Tell me about my son.  And we spent the rest of the night, well into the morning, there at the diner, sipping coffee and eating unhealthy food as she filled me in on her life, and yours.  I found out about her three marriages and of your brothers.  I learned about your football career and your love of the simple pleasures, things I too enjoyed so much; hiking, fishing, hunting, just being out in the woods, in the mountains with nature.  I learned of the sense of humor you had developed.  I saw pictures and video of you growing up.  And I so desperately wanted to push her to tell you about me.  I wanted you to know.  I wanted to meet you now, after all this time.  I wanted to look into that face that so closely resembled my own.  I wanted to feel your hand in mine, I wanted so much to see the young man you had become.

But you were a happy, healthy, and given everything, a surprisingly well adjusted 15 year old kid, just shy of your 16th birthday.  And I realized then (and perhaps this is still my own weakness, I'll admit) that forcing myself into your life would upset everything you'd ever known and would have caused a lot of confusion and anger.  Showing up in your life after so many years and saying ""Hi, you don't know me, but I'm your father"" would have been more to assuage my own guilt than it would to make your life any better than it already was.  For all her faults, your mom, and the man who raised you, had done a wonderful job and being told about me would have done nothing but destroy that life you had.

So this time, by my own choice, I opted to only watch you from afar.  I gave my word, something I very seldom do, for anyone, that I wouldn't interfere in your life, that I wouldn't tell you who I was.  I promised that it would remain a secret between your mom and I.  So I followed your life in pictures and videos and facebook posts.  I kept up with what was going in with you surreptitiously through your mom.  I watched you grow up those last three years, from a typical 15 year old, to a high school senior.  I felt joy when you were there on the field with your mom during Homecoming.  I loved how grown you looked dressed up and standing next to your lovely girlfriend the night of Prom.  I laughed at the videos you posted online.  I couldn't find the words to adequately express my happiness the day you got the college acceptance letter.  I was certain that you were going to see your dreams fulfilled, and I knew you had the drive and strength to succeed.

And then I lost you again, forever.  The sad irony is that I had been talking to your mom about this more and more, and finally, now that you were an adult, I was planning to meet you, again.  We had agreed that I'd just be introduced as an old friend of your mom's.  That was her rule, she was fiercely protective of you and wouldn't let anyone upset the world you lived in, and I agreed with her.  As I said, I decided years before that trying to explain to you who I was would only serve to make me feel better about myself and do nothing but hurt you, and I gave my word I wouldn't do that to you.  So I was prepared for that day I was to visit your mom at her house, and meet you, and shake your hand as an adult.

I dreamed of that day.  I swore that I would never say a thing about who I really was, but I secretly hoped, with all my fractured soul that you would look at me, and in the back of your mind you'd start to wonder about your mom's friend, and why we have the same nose and cheeks, and smile.  And why we get the same expressions on our faces and have the same mischievous look in our eyes when we're up to no good.  But I lost out on that chance too.  That moment that I had dreamt of was taken, forcefully.

It would be easy to tell you that I don't understand why you did what you did.  But I do.  The same thing inside me that drove me to be a medic was my only real gift to you.  And my curse.  The same selfless concern for everyone around you that everyone loved you for is what pushed you into that river that day.  It drove you to pull that girl from the water, and it drove you back into the water go rescue her friend who was also stuck in the swift current.  And it's the reason why you're gone now.  Everyone was so preoccupied with tending to those two girls that no one noticed that you hadn't come ashore.  It was a few moments before they realized you were gone.  It was several more hours before the divers found you in the river.  It's all my fault, it feels.  Or maybe not.  Maybe that drive isn't genetic.  Maybe it's just that your mom and step-dad did you right.  But it feels like my fault.  It feels like that because you died doing exactly what I would have done in that situation.  You died doing exactly what I HAVE done, many times in the past.  And I failed you.

I never got to say hello to you as a man.  I never got to hold your hand one more time. I never got to look into your eyes and hope for that glimmer of recognition, and it was all my fault.  Your mom was destroyed and I feel responsible, emotionally, even if my pragmatic self knows that's rubbish.  But I can't help but feel that if I had entered your life again, if I had changed just that one thing, maybe that one moment would have been the butterfly flapping it's wings, changing the course of your life.  Maybe you would still be here today, just getting into your junior year of college.  But the what-if game is a black hole, consuming everything but giving nothing back.

At your viewing, I was alone.  Only I and your mom and your grandmother knew who I was and why I was there.  I heard the questions being asked, ""Who is that guy?"" ""Does anyone know who that is?"".  But my promise, my word given years before, meant I couldn't answer them.  It meant that at your memorial service, when the pastor encouraged everyone to stand and speak their mind, I had to muffle my thoughts and fight my need to stand and speak.  It meant that I cried alone for hours on end with no one I could share this pain with.  It meant I must keep all this pain inside me, mine to bear alone. It means that this week, on what should have been your 21st birthday, I'll be crying, alone, again.  I failed you and my failure is utterly complete, Deven.  I failed you at every turn despite that I've always loved you with all my heart.  I failed you and nothing can make that right.  I would have given my life to trade places with you.  I would have then, and I would gladly strike that bargain today if it meant you got to live again and live out the rest of your life and make the world a brighter place.

I'll never be able to fully express this to anyone but you.  I'll always feel this overwhelming guilt that, at least in some small way, my failure contributed to your death.  And I'll always carry that emptiness inside me, that same pit that I've carried since you were taken from me the first time, just shy of two years old.  I'll always remember how you smelt.  And I'll always remember your smile.  And I'll always remember the incredible feeling when you'd wrap your tiny fingers around mine as I held you and rocked you to sleep.  And I'll never get to tell you any of this.

I hope you can forgive me.  I hope that, if by chance you ARE able to see this, from wherever you are, you understand.  And I hope that you know, even if you didn't know it then, I love you with all my heart, and the world is diminished without you in it.",1,1748994891.0,UnsentLetters,1,1.0,False
1l2rb7y,https://i.redd.it/oqk4qcxnvs4f1.png,Is this a cavity?,"Hello! I've spotted this small, brown spot on my tooth yesterday. The last time I visited my dentist was a month ago, but he did not mention anything about it when he saw my X-rays and checked my teeth there (I was there for a simple procedure). It doesn't hurt, and it's not sensitive (no bleeding either), but this tooth had a cavity before, and I'm afraid that its developing again on a different area. Is it possible for a cavity to develop so quickly? My dentist would never miss it, so the only logical explanation is that it has developed during the past month to such and extent. I don't smoke or drink, I floss and brush regularly. It is true that I consume too much coffee, but I immediately brush my teeth afterwards

Do you think that I should contact my dentist? 
He is really expensive, so I'm afraid of another procedure (healthcare sucks in my country, so I would rather not rely on it), but I don't want it to get worse. 

Thank you for your answers in advance!

1l2r95v,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l2r95v,8 Nights at Amanoi Forest Wellness Villa (+ photo dump),"We've stayed at a fair number of fat hotels, but nothings we've been to so far has been as incredible, meaningful, and perfect as Amanoi. There's a certain level where hospitality transitions to artistry, and it's pretty amazing to be a part of.

The Wellness Villa we stayed at was essentially a regular pavilion + a nearby private spa. I say private spa because it was enormous and basically seemed copy pasted from the main spa. It has a large swimming pool, giant hammam and steam room, beautiful couples treatment room, showers, changing room, bathroom and dining room. It also included full board and 1.5 hours of spa treatments per person per day + an amazing 100min hammam treatment every other day.

Did we get tired of 1.5 hrs+ of treatments per day for 8 days? lol no. My husband who isn't as into spa as I am eventually started using the full 1.5 hours and loved it. The hammam treatment (which didn't sound that special on paper) was really special. Basically they heat you up in the sauna, whip you with twigs and branches, cold plunge you, float you around the pool, give you a coffee body scrub, and then beat you again with bamboo. Something about it always put me in a really good state of mind and able to process a lot of things that were happening in my life at the time. Super highly recommend. Even if you're not staying at this villa, you can rent it out for a half or full day.

Amanoi is one of the newest Aman's that stays true to the origins of the brand — remote, serene, highly connected to its local culture. We really loved that and wish the brand would continue this focus instead of all the city hotels and residences. But I digress. Here are some notes:

Hard Product

* The main pavilion (i.e. lobby, restaurant, etc) is really stunning. It's grand yet intimate. At night there was a lot of ambiance (great jazz singer + pianist at night) despite there being so few guests (\~20 during our stay).
* Rooms are huge (even at base level). They're very well appointed and beautifully designed.
* Mini bar and alcoholic drinks included
* Rooms strangely lacked storage and a washlet but still awesome
* Magic housekeeping was awesome (like many Aman's, every time you left the room would get tidied). We never used our room key.

Service

* Incredibly intuitive and so impressive. They were always a step ahead of any request we had and very quickly picked up on our patterns to better anticipate our needs
* Everyone we interacted with was so warm and seemingly happy. 7:1 staff to guest ratio was crazy. No matter who we interacted with, they knew our names, room number, and preferences.
* Our butler (Ann) was outstanding. We loved getting to know her and she handled anything and everything we asked about
* It was my birthday on this trip and I felt so loved by all the staff. The hospitality director stopped by our dinner and joked how all the staff were taking pictures of us as we went about our day and were being like ""we saw them do X!"". When I went to the gym (and because we were getting so many spa treatments) the whole spa staff came out to take a selfie with me. It was so cute.
* The GM (Joy) was amazing. It's really impressive how she's done so well in such a traditionally male dominated role. She's incredibly warm and competent and all the staff look up to her as a role model.
* Many of the staff were from the nearby villages and were so polished and world class. This created a really tight bond to the local community.

Food

* Great (but general to Aman, not overly exceptional).
* Breakfast was awesome, highly recommend the coconuts and Vietnamese iced coffee
* On day one I asked about veggie spring rolls and muesli without raisins — every day after that they had those prepared just in case I wanted them again.
* We had some special dining experiences that I'd def recommend:
   * Beach picnic (on a private brach)
   * Private moonlit movie screening by the main pool
   * Sacred Cham dinner (preceded by a blessing by one of the last remaining Cham masters)
   * Picnic on the waterfall trek
   * Wine tasting dinner
* The food at the beach club during lunch was one of the highlights and superior to the main restaurant (highly recommend the salmon poke bowl and fish tacos)

Activities

* We're generally pretty active on vacations and were worried there wouldn't be much to do given the remote location. But there was more than enough to keep us busy and we ended up planning fewer activities since it was so lovely just relaxing and doing some mindfulness work by our pool.
* Waterfall trek was great but demanding in the heat (high 80's in May and very high humidity). It was all uphill on the outbound and took about 4 hours total (we're experienced hikers). Our guide had a seemingly endless supply of perfectly folded cold towels in his backpack (like seriously about 6 pairs that we saw?). When we got to the waterfall we saw that another staff member had hiked up before us and had set up an elegantly appointed picnic with ginger beer.
* We did a half day tour into town which we enjoyed. Our guide was the first person in her small village to leave and study internationally. She spoke perfect english and left her village without even knowing how to catch a bus to the airport. Another amazing backstory. She also had an endless supply of cold towels (this was such a recurring theme that we jokingly started a cold towel tracker, I think we got to over 100 in the 8 day stay). We saw the Cham temples, pottery & weaving studios, a small museum, and had lunch at a delicious local restaurant.
* General water-sports at the beach were fine (the usual kayak, standup paddle board, etc).

Again I can't recommend Amanoi highly enough. Feel free to AMA in the comments.

Last month a girl kept touching and coming on to me, trying to get me drunk enough to participate after I told her I was in a relationship. I haven't taken my Wellbutrin in a month.

She was with a larger group of friends me and my roommates know, and there was a welcome-home party for this girl (Ada) and her other friends that had been gone for a few months. I was also really struggling being around people at all, and trying to spend time with the people I met in 2024 was so strange because all I could think was 'they dont know i dont know them'. I would still see them when my roommates invited them over so it wasn't like I was a complete stranger. When Ada and her friends came over, I was staying solitary in my room. She came upstairs and asked me to come downstairs and join the party, and I agreed. I figured we must have had a cool conversation at some point, and not many people really seek me out so I was actually really warmed that someone would care enough to invite me downstairs.

Well, she pretty quickly starts flirting, but only physically. STARING at me, moving her face QUICKLY towards mine. Her hand was on my knee almost constantly. I really didn't know what to do. I pretty much pretended she wasn't doing anything but talking to me, completely ignoring her physical moves. At one point we went into the kitchen because she was like 'ooj im so sleepy and drunk' so i was like here ill make u some coffee, hoping it would wake her up and make her fucking stop touching me. She very quickly told me that she wanted me, and I told her I was in a monogomaous relationship and couldn't reciprocate. I also complimented her. I could see this dark, hateful aura roll over her whenever she could tell I wasn't interested and I was so upset at the thought that my behavior was making /her/ upset, I really couldn't do anything other than make nice chatter with her. I didn't want to make her feel bad but my engaging with her only made her feel more confident in touching me physically. She then dragged me down to the basement to get more alcohol. She tried to get me to drink. And then proceeded to continiue touching my Upper Thigh heavily when we went back upstairs. It only ended when someone else in the room announced a smoke break and I hopped up begging to join. I had a few months last year where I was entirely touch-free with this group of friends, and had to actually duck out of hugs from people who didn't comprehend 'no hugs' faster than their body moved. And the fact that they all watched me get groped by someone, CLEARLY NOT INTERESTED, and did nothing to stop it, hurts so much. The only person in this group of people that have known me for a year to ever say the words ""I missed you, will you come join us?"" and she proceeds to grope me for forty minutes. I can't blame any of them for not really seeking me out, I don't even remember what I was like when I was first meeting them. I certainly don't think anything I've done has made me worth seeking out. It just really fucking sucks that now I have the whole 'the only people that talk to you want you for sex' complex blaring back in when i had just kinda gotten it to stop. And this group of friends is tainted now, I can't even want to be around them because of that experience being so upsetting. I don't even know what anyone could have done to stop Ada but it's like.. girlypop's an alcoholic, and we are a very queer group of people, so I would expect people to be a bit more aware of the whole 'unwelcome touch' concept. But knowing me, the only way I can get through things is if I go along with them, so of course I probably made it look like I was enjying it. I got a text from my other roommate asking if I was okay with how Ada was touchihng me and I responded that I was not okay with it, and it seemed like they were going to say something thank god but then someone announced a smoke break and  I was freed. So I have literal proof that my discomfort was clear to others. But this was a roommate, and not a part of this specific friend group.

I just feel so alone. I thought I did a decent job becoming friends with these people, but like. Yeah idk how to feel. It's not like I pursued them much as friends so I can't be mad. I don't even know why I'm mad because I didn't put much effort in at all. I have exactly what I've worked for! Which is nothing. I'm too scared to try to befriend anyone and I really dont know why

It's so hard to talk to people on social media because I was in an extremely traumatizing 3 year relationship and we communicated exclusively thru social media because we were overseas. So opening something like Instagram now is pretty terrifying. I just don't have the energy to fight that fear. I text people and get paralyzed the moment they respond, until I've forgotten I ever texted them. I will send a message to someone I'm trying to be freinds with and then I delete the app because something about the process is so fucking scary. I'm entirely trapped by my mind. But I don't like myself enough to try to interact more because all I can think about is how I feel bad for being inconsistent and how I can't listen and be there for other people because I spent 3 years throwing up out of panic because my ex would threaten suicide every other month. I have so much memory loss because of that relationship. It disabled me so much more than I already was. I want to go and be a hermit somewhere because the way I act around people so constantly frustrates me and pisses me orff.

I had to tell my manager I got molested because she wouldn't fucking take me seriously on my inability to train people. I still don't think she understands at all. She kept saying 'well then maybe this job isn't right for you' and im like yeah, i agree. if you didn't tell me you needed me i wouldn't still be here becuse im fully aware i am not capable of performing my job. She really thought she was cooking and she probably still doesn't get it. I can't believe I had to tell her I got molested I didn't have to but my mind forced me. I'm so fucking stupid.

In an upbeat penthouse in **Makati**, the hum of caffeine and ambition filled the air. **Mira**, a young developer with a melodic voice and a passion project called *SongNest*, was delivering a quiet pitch over coffee to **Mr. Zobel de Ayala**, a sharp-eyed venture capitalist known for swooping in on early talent.

*SongNest* was a niche audio platform that amplified rare, acoustic artists. It was small but loyal, and its engagement was promising.

**Mira** spoke eagerly, “It’s not Spotify. It’s not massive. But we’ve carved a unique audience. With just 100k pesos, we can scale our reach 2x and—”

Before she could finish, **Mr. Ayala**’s phone buzzed.

Another founder was pinging him: ***MegaMuse***, an ambitious AI music generator claiming to disrupt the entire recording industry. Big vision. Big risk. Big money.

He glanced down at **Mira**’s modest pitch deck. A lean app. No hype. Steady growth.

She caught his hesitation. “Look, I may not be the biggest meal out there. But what I offer is real. No gamble. Loyal user base. Fully built. I’m here, ready. That other deal? It’s vapor until proven otherwise.”

**Mr. Ayala** tapped his pen, then smiled.

“I’d be a fool to chase a bigger deal I haven’t caught, when I already have something valuable in hand.”

He signed the deal.

I'm looking for the kind of love where we have fun grocery shopping together, and make every night feel like date night.

[Here's a few recent photos of me.](https://imgur.com/a/FV8FVMO) They give you a good sampler of my interests lol. In addition to concerts/music and racing, I love going for walks to stay active, driving, card games, and I've been back into daytrading for the last two-ish years now. I have a cool full time job, and I don't drink or smoke. I think I'm a good noodle overall, hopefully you are too! Physically I'm 6'1 with blue eyes, no tattoos,...you've seen the photos. 😅

I'm here looking for my person to spend forever with. I dream of being together, maybe with a few kids too. I dunno, the thought of coming home from work and cooking dinner together and watching something before bed just sounds perfect to me. If that's something you want as well, you should reach out :)

Additionally I'm kind of a clingy partner and love to chat often! Sweet good morning/night messages melt my heart, and sharing little things through your day will keep me forever.

Some random facts about me:

* I load almost everything I eat with black pepper
* I'll always make a funny face or at least smile when going through an EZ Pass toll booth
* Left handed and born two months premature (my literal due date was April 1st and I feel like that says a lot lol)
* 😅 is my favorite emoji
* I can't really have caffeine anymore so I'm not a coffee drinker, and I don't have soda a lot - but birch beer is my WEAKNESS
* And I have to edge the microwave and stop it with a second to go

The trains (when they work), the insurance obsession, the forest walks, and the weirdly good bakery culture.

But I’ve been here for a while now, and honestly…
It’s hard to make real connections.

Small talk? Doesn’t exist.
Inviting someone for coffee? Feels like proposing marriage.
Trying to make friends as an adult here is like trying to get through Bürgeramt without an appointment: impossible.

I know Germans value privacy and space, and I respect that. But coming from a more open culture, it can feel… cold.
Efficient, yes. But warm? Not really.

I’m saying this as someone who genuinely wants to integrate. Learn the language. Respect the culture. Be part of something.

But sometimes I wonder:
Are Germans really distant… or do foreigners just not understand how closeness works here?

Germans: Is this just our misunderstanding? Or is this cultural distance real?
Expats: Have you felt the same?

Then this year I saw that she joined my company as a principal (higher than me) in a different department. I reached out for coffee and she agreed. During the coffee session she asked what I do and I said at the moment mainly data governance. She rolled her eyes and said ""urgh that's boring"". I was a bit caught off guard and felt a bit awkward.

For context I am not in a traditional data team and instead in a specialised domain which only exists in this specific industry, but has massive amount of data. While my title isn't anything data governance, I just need to do a lot of it this year. I am also a woman myself. 

Anyway during the coffee she mentioned about wanting to go to departmental townhalls to understand the company a bit better. I asked my skip level about our upcoming department's townhall and if I can extend the invitation to her and he agreed. I forwarded it to her and dropped her a message and she just simply never responded. 

I don't take it personally, and I don't get offended when people don't respond cause I know how easily you can oversee things, but I want to understand the psyche a bit. Have you had a similar experience?

[Azratem Slayer of Killers](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/118660/azratem-slayer-of-killers)

It’s a psychological dark fantasy with cosmic horror and an antihero who hunts killers — and becomes something far worse.

Would love your thoughts, and thank you for reading.

Here, you can have a taste:  
\-----------  
The hallways of a psychiatric hospital, filled with whispers and the murky memories of those who dwell within.  
Echoing with screams, howls, and nightmare-fueled wails from minds irreparably broken.  
Where the severity of each patient’s condition teeters between mental illness and what religion might call demonic possession.

Some slam themselves against the walls. Others tear their fingernails off while clawing desperately at the concrete in a futile attempt to escape.  
Many must be restrained in straitjackets to keep them from mutilating themselves or tearing chunks of their own flesh to eat.

It’s a horrifying place, where night-shift nurses refuse to walk alone. The perverse and deranged gazes seen through windows and iron bars are so unsettling, they make one want to run.  
Their minds can’t even fathom what these people—these *things*—might do if they ever got their hands on them.

Most of it remains conjecture, dark rumors and terrifying stories that drift through the halls like ghostly gossip.

Only two veteran doctors had the experience and the steel nerves to endure what lived behind those walls.  
They had the stomach, the guts, and the audacity to walk the corridors without flinching.  
Unshaken by the horrors within those cages—called *dormitories* with shameless inhumanity.

Their eyes were weary from a shift of who knows how many hours, spent making rounds, checking that patients received their treatments and proper medication.  
In their hands, they held a clipboard full of forms, case files, and medical records for those under their care.

“Is this true, Dr. Hartford?” asked Dr. Royce, sipping from his coffee cup, while holding the clipboard in his other hand. “These two patients… they’re the only ones who survived that demon?”

“Yes… the only ones we can actually classify as *victims.* Though there’s also that family… remember them?”

“Oh yes, yes!... The Jewish One… it was shocking. I wonder if what they say about that case is even real.”

They arrived at a door—Cell 117—which, unlike the others, was particularly silent.

“Patient: Dominico Martínez, 38 years old… criminal record links him to the Kofman cartel. Found with high-caliber bullet wounds that were absorbed by body armor worn under his clothes at the time of the attack. Only ended up with one arm mutilated,” read Royce from the file in his hand, coffee just inches from his lips.

He scanned the papers, noting that the man had no personal or family history of mental illness. On the contrary—an extensive criminal background, with a vile number of victims, including children.

“Why is he here? Someone like him, officially declared a linked member of the Kofman cartel, should be in prison.”

Hartford smiled ear to ear.

“Watch. You’ll get your answer.”

Hartford knocked on the reinforced door and slid open the small viewing window.

Royce took two steps back in shock when the patient came into view.

His eyes were opened wide, stretched to the extreme, staring with a thousand-yard stare—if a thousand yards were even enough to describe the grotesquely pulled expression on his face.

Dark, sunken eye sockets so severe it looked as if his eyelids had been burned away.  
Wounds across his scalp, self-inflicted with the fingernails of his only remaining arm.  
Cuts on his lips, clearly from biting himself.  
Cracked teeth from the constant, unnatural pressure he subjected them to—forever clenched.

“I shot him… I shot him… I SHOT HIM, I SHOT HIM, I SHOT HIM, I SHOT HIM, I SHOT HIM, I SHOT HIM!... I SHOT HIM!... I SWEAR I SHOT HIM! I SWEAR! I TRIED TO KILL HIM, I SHOT HIM AND IT DID NOTHING!... I SWEAR!”

He began to cry. His face twisted into a grimace of raw panic—something the doctors instantly recognized as genuine.

He slammed himself from side to side until he gave up, retreating into the corner, beneath the sink in his cell, where he seemed to feel safe.

He clutched his head with his only arm, as if trying to give himself a false sense of security, while begging—screaming—not to turn off the light.

If they did, he said, *it* would come for him… and it would kill everyone else too.

Dr. Royce pulled out a handkerchief and wiped the sweat from his brow, shaken by what he’d just seen—while his colleague chuckled, clearly satisfied by the exact reaction he had anticipated.

“That was impressive, I’ll admit,” said Hartford, walking on with Royce.

“By the way… a moment ago, you referred to the slayer as a ‘demon,’ didn’t you?”

“Yes… why do you ask?”

“Oh, it’s nothing… It’s just that I don’t think we should use that kind of terminology for him… or her, since we don’t really know what *it* is. What I mean is, calling him a demon… I think it just glorifies him. It inspires fear, amplifies the terror. For example, at first he was seen as a hero. Then a vigilante. Later, a monster. And now—a demon. You see what I mean?",1,1748993547.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

1l2qtll,https://www.reddit.com/r/ToxicMoldExposure/comments/1l2qtll/mold_almost_killed_me_and_gave_me_kidney_cancer/,Mold almost killed me and gave me kidney cancer,"I want to share something with you that I believe is not just important—it’s urgent. It could save your life. It saved mine.

This is a story about what happens when you refuse to accept ""bad luck"" as an answer. When you dig deeper. When you follow your God-given instinct until you find the truth. Even if no one believes you. Even if it means turning your world upside down.

In November 2023, I began experiencing a strange, dull pain in my flank. It was constant—24/7. It never stopped. I saw 8 or 9 different doctors. All of them dismissed me. Gas. Muscle pain. Stress. They told me I was too young for cancer. They didn’t take me seriously. I told them something felt wrong—I even said the word “cancer”—and they brushed me off.
Eventually, one doctor referred me to a GI specialist. I told her everything—about my persistent heartburn, my esophagitis (Grade C), and that nagging flank pain. She ordered a CT scan. I didn’t even get a call. I saw the result on MyChart: ""Kidney mass.""

I went numb. Then I went to Google. And I cried for weeks.

Then I went to church. I begged God for answers, for guidance, for truth. I saw five urologists. Two said monitor it. Three said surgery. I chose to try healing naturally for six months. Looking back, I now believe I could have healed—if I hadn’t still been actively exposed to the very thing that was making me sick.

In October 2024, I was diagnosed with a renal mass. On April 14, 2025, I had surgery. With kidney cancer, they usually don’t biopsy—it’s too risky. You don’t know if it’s cancer until it’s removed. Chemo and radiation don’t work well on kidney cancer. Surgery is the treatment.

My pathology report: Stage 1, Grade 2 clear cell renal cell carcinoma.

I was 36. No family history. I don’t smoke. I don’t drink. I did full genetic testing for kidney cancer—it came back completely negative.
When I asked my surgeon what caused it, he said, “Just bad luck.”

But something about that phrase struck me like lightning. It felt wrong. I don’t believe in bad luck—I believe in divine guidance. In protection. In purpose. There’s a saying in Portuguese: ""Quem me cuida não dorme""—he who watches over me never sleeps.
So I went home and decided: I was going to find the cause. I owed it to my children. I owed it to myself. If I could find the root cause, I could stop it from coming back.

I joined kidney cancer support groups. And what I found shocked me. So many people with Stage 1 kidney cancer had recurrence—3, 5, 10, 15 years later. How could we be ""cured"" and still be dying?
I have two boys—ages 4 and 2. I couldn’t accept that fate. That wasn’t going to be my story.

So I started pulling every test, every lab, every scan I’d ever done. I uploaded them into ChatGPT. I built a timeline. I connected dots that no doctor was connecting.

And I learned something critical: I have MTHFR and slow COMT. My genes impair my body’s ability to detox. I hold on to toxins. My system gets overwhelmed easily. That matters in this story.

Then I remembered something my friend Erin told me while doing hyperbaric oxygen therapy. She said mold caused her breast cancer.

At first, when I met Erin back in Otober I tested my house. because of what she said but it came back clean. After surgery, Erin kept sharing some posts about mold with me and this voice inside of me said “Test your body,”. So I did.

And everything changed.

My Vibrant Wellness mycotoxin test came back with Ochratoxin A—6x the safe limit—and DHC, both known carcinogens.

Ochratoxin A is produced by Aspergillus and Penicillium molds—the same ones that thrive in cold, damp, enclosed places. 

This wasn’t from food, coffee, nor grains. This was environmental. Chronic exposure the levels were to high I was being exposed daily to this thing.
So I asked myself: where was I being exposed?

We moved into this house in May 2022. The ice machine came with it.

From day one, I had a weird feeling about it. I asked my husband to clean it constantly. Every two months, we wiped what we could. But there’s a section that you’re “not supposed” to open or clean.

I asked him to open it anyway. What we found inside? MOLD

We tested the ice machine 4 times. Everytime it  came back positive for Aspergillus, Penicillium, and Ochratoxin A. This ice machine that should be sterile and no mold should ever be present.

I also tested my house 3 separate times. All results cameback negative.

The ice machine was the only source. My only exposure.

I stopped using the ice on May 7, 2025. And within 24 hours, my symptoms began to disappear:

* The crippling heartburn was gone
* The salivation so extreme it made me vomit—gone
* The anxiety, heart palpitations, brain fog—gone
* The flank pain I had felt for a year and a half—gone

My body had been screaming at me. And now it was healing.

iI'm still not out of the woods as my body still has high levels of ochratoxin. I’m still detoxing—aggressively. I do:

* Sauna
* Hyperbarics
* Supplements - binders - anti fungals
* Ozone therapy
* Red light
* Fasting
* Walking

  I also reached out to my surgeon—remeber the 4th top kidney cancer doctor in the country super busy guy. I emailed him my theory. I expected him to think I was crazy not give me the time of the day and tell me to kick rocks. But he didn’t. 

He believed me enough to ask his pathology department to help. But pathology labs in hospitals only test for live fungi. My tumor had been frozen and stored for a month. Ochratoxin is not a mold—it’s the toxin mold leaves behind. It won’t show up in fungal cultures. They called me and told me this was as far as they could go, they were not allowed to go any further if fungi was not present. I needed a mycotoxin test not a fungi test.

 That was the moment I knew I was onto something big. I’ve tried to test my tumor since, but it’s nearly impossible. There are almost no labs in the U.S. that test tumors for mycotoxins. I contacted Stanford. They can’t do it. I contacted the head of kidney oncology at one of Oklahoma’s top medical schools. His reply? “We’re not intelligent enough to answer your question.” At first I thought it was a political answer. Now I believe he was being honest. 

I’ve also contacted Dr. Tim Guilford, one of the leading experts in mycotoxins. He reviewed my case and said my theory is well thought out.

But the best part and why I think my case is very important for research is because I have proof: I had a clear MRI in February 2022 I moved into this house May 2022 I had symptoms immediately: panic attacks, brain fog, GI issues, heartburn, esophagitis, memory loss. I had a miscarriage (Ochratoxin is associated with placental dysfunction) I had a 1.8cm tumor by October 2024—way too fast for normal kidney cancer growth (typically 0.3 cm per year).

This was not bad luck. This was exposure. And I believe there are many more people like me. I believe mold is a massive hidden contributor to cancer. Only 5% of cancers are genetic. The rest is very much so enviromental. But no one is testing for it. Doctors aren’t trained in mold. Mycology isn’t part of med school. Labs aren’t offering tumor mycotoxin testing. And yet—when they want to give mice cancer—they use the very thing I found in my body ochratoxin to give lab rats kidney cancer. Where’s the disconnects 

What I want from my experience: 

Health insurance to cover mold illness 

House insurance should pay for mold remediation 

All kidney cancer patients (and others with glioblastoma, sarcoma, basal cell, melanoma, and breast cancer) should be tested for mycotoxins before any treatment plan 

Appliances like ice machines, Keurigs, humidifiers, and fridges need stricter regulation 

Who’s testing the inner lines we can’t see? Go on Reddit. Search “ice machine mold.” You’ll be shocked. Hospitals, restaurants, schools…  mold is everywhere. And people say, “It’s just a little mold.” No. It’s a little cancer waiting to happen. 

And maybe, just maybe, our obsession with cold is killing us. Cold drinks. Cold homes. Cold air-conditioned cars. Sealed houses. This past summer I went to Italy and they dont really believe in ice and they get mad when americans ask for ice, I wonder if this is why they’re healthier than us, yes food too but what about our cold obsession. Nobody is talking about this.  

And when we get sick and go to the doctor what do they give us? They give us antibiotic (penicillin) —a byproduct of mold a mycotoxin. More mold to a body already drowning in it. 

If I had accepted “bad luck,” I wouldn’t be here. I would probably had a recurrence in two years as I was being exposed to what gave me cancer daily like alot of the people I saw in the groups. I saved my life. I saved my kids’ lives. I saved my husband's life, I saved my family!

Also I have shared my theory on a few cancer groups and some people replied to ""interesting because I had cancer and my husband had cancer within 6 months or I had cancer and my daughter had cancer"" this is no coincindence this is proof of enviromental toxins.  

Please help me share this. More people need to know.  Because cancer isn’t always bad luck. We are being exposed to whats making us sick and the first and most important thing we should do is to stop exposure than we can think of healing. 

Sometimes I wonder if this cancer was no accident if God gave it to me because he knew I would be crazy and obsessive enough to not accept bad luck as my fate. If my story helps one person I will be happy with that  

Also, If I was diagnosed with cancer today the first thing I would do is a Mycotoxin

## Key Features Analysis

The effectiveness of a commercial water filter system hinges on several key features. Understanding these specifications is crucial for making an informed decision.

**Filtration Capacity:** This refers to the volume of water the system can effectively filter within a specific timeframe, usually measured in gallons per minute (GPM) or gallons per day (GPD).A system with higher capacity is ideal for businesses with high water consumption.Consider your average daily water usage and peak demand periods to select a system that meets your requirements without compromising filtration quality. Overloading a system can reduce its effectiveness and shorten its lifespan.

**Filtration Method:** Commercial water filter systems employ various filtration methods, including sediment filtration, activated carbon filtration, reverse osmosis (RO), and ultraviolet (UV) sterilization. Sediment filters remove particulate matter like sand, silt, and rust. Activated carbon filters adsorb chlorine, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and other chemicals that affect taste and odor. Reverse osmosis uses pressure to force water through a semi-permeable membrane, removing dissolved solids, minerals, and microorganisms. UV sterilization uses ultraviolet light to kill bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens. The best filtration method depends on the specific contaminants present in your water supply and the desired level of purity.

**Filter Lifespan and Replacement Costs:** Each filter component has a limited lifespan, after which it needs to be replaced to maintain optimal performance. Filter lifespan is typically measured in gallons filtered or months of use. Check the manufacturer's recommendations for filter replacement intervals. Consider the cost of replacement filters when evaluating different systems. A system with lower upfront costs may have higher long-term operating expenses due to frequent and expensive filter replacements.**System Size and Installation Requirements:** Commercial water filter systems come in various sizes, ranging from compact under-sink units to larger whole-building systems. Ensure that you have adequate space to accommodate the system and that the installation process is feasible for your facility. Consider factors such as water pressure, plumbing connections, and drainage requirements. Professional installation might potentially be necessary for complex systems or if you lack the necessary plumbing skills.

**Certifications and Standards:** look for systems that are certified by reputable organizations like NSF International (National Sanitation Foundation) or the Water Quality Association (WQA). These certifications indicate that the system has been tested and meets industry standards for safety and performance. Common certifications include NSF/ANSI Standard 42 for aesthetic effects (taste, odor, chlorine reduction) and NSF/ANSI Standard 53 for health effects (lead, cysts, VOCs reduction). Certifications provide assurance that the system will perform as advertised and protect your water supply from harmful contaminants.

1l2qiwq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Breakupadvice/comments/1l2qiwq/fiance_of_8_yrs_left_me/,Fiance of 8 yrs left me.,"I'm a 31F Ive lived with aspergers/social anxiety/ depression for most of my life. Its kind of a long story and I've been talking to many people about since it happened four days ago, but on Saturday morning, my fiance 31M told me he was going to work and was not coming back.
He works a lot, I'm not denying being a chef is hard, I personally couldn't do it. He is overweight with some health issues and habits but I overlooked that for years. Hes always worked hard, to the point where he sacrificed a lot of things and his health so we could get by financially.

I went through a series of bad jobs, I was a preschool teacher when we met, worked a few days a week cause of mental health issues and a verbually abusive coworker who managed me. He said he'd always be fine with that as long as I worked. When I had enough and a mental breakdown around 2019 when covid, I had already worked there for 7 years at the time, lost all the joy I could muster from working there. I was never entirely sure if I could work with young children for rest of my life. At this time we had been together for 3 years and he knew my struggles. I was so thankful we he supported me leaving this place.
I took a break from working for about ten months, contributing what I could from disability payments while I worked on my pysical and mental health. He started to get a little resentfilul so I sought out employment as a waitress at a cafe, I did this for about 9 months. He always warned me working this christmas holidays were going to be tough, and that time was looming closer. In november I caved, after being yelled at my some customers (this wasn't the first time) I told my then boss I'm sorry but if I couldn't handle it then, how could handle this during the xmas holidays?

He told me to not stay unemployed for too long this time, I agreed. 2 months later I landed a probabtional career as a cleaner at a nursing home, it was extremely hard. I worked hard and as fast as I could but some nurses encouraged me to leave early once or twice during these 2 weeks. I had been limping from an aggravated siatica in my leg and could barley keep up with other cleaners. Long story short I didn't make it through the probation period, he was mad, said I blew a good thing just like the waitress job.

Fearing disapointing him ( as I am a notorious people pleaser) I immediately sought help from a employment help company known as Tursa, where my case manager noticed me beg for any job, come in different days fearing my partner would leave me.

She got me a temp job at a pie shop that was meant to close down in six months but I was something and I took it without hesitation. Thinking it was a least something, the new boss was unusual in his personality, no filter and quick to judge, but with a good sense of humour. He'd get me to come in 4 days a week for 3 hours at a time and make sausage rolls and meat pies from scratch. 
I worked over the christmas holidays for the first time in a hospitality setting. I worked hard and I managed, that boss started making negative comments about my body, about my weight, about my breasts and that I looked emo. He used to argue with his wife in front of the staff/customers, my partner knew of this and I told him I could handle it.

It was suggested by my partner and family that I get a new childcare career going before he closed shop in a few weeks and to hang tight in the meantime as they always belived I had been good at this. They knew it wasn't my dream career, I was still had old wounds from my first job but I gave it a try.
I got a new job at a smaller childcare center, handing in my resume myself looking keen and willing to do anything despite my doubts. I managed to do this for 6 months before the director, called a meeting after I begged for more shifts. Fearing any losing hours and diapointing my partner. He told it was fine, and that there was a staff meeting the following week and that it could be discussed then.
When I arrived something was off, the staff outside asked why I was here and when I went inside it was just him. He sat me down and told me that my services were no longer needed and that he had found another person with a better skillset. I cried and it still never sits right with me to this day that he had to lie and call a fake meeting, my partner thought I had blown it once again.

Again I went to Tursa crying, begging for more employment. This was not the first time, I usually did every few weeks out of relationship fear, the director was kind but expressed doubts about the legitimacy of my relationship with my partner, from the outside it seemed so controlling and conditional.

I now work at a malaysian takeaway resteraunt and have been there for a year and a half. My partners parents had confronted me in the past about my lack of abiltiy to hold a stable job and my lack of genuine smiles whenever I went to there home, the short answer is that I felt guilt and feared their disaproval. That they might convince their son to leave me one day, I should point out they are both in their sixties and don't belive mental health problems actually exist and should hinder your ability to work.
My hours at the restaurant had been cut, working less than 8 hours a week, 2 hours a few a night on weekends mostly. My partner was becoming frustrated, he had come over with him to his parents so they could discuss what was going on, I was fine with this, I felt I owed them an explanation.

What then followed was 2 hours of raised voices on their end while I cried. Them asking what was wrong with me and why I couldn't just simply work harder. I said sorry over and over.
All while my fiance of 7 years sat to the side with his head down, not looking at me, frowning, not saying a word in my defence. I had fully dedicated myself to this guy, nursing him through various help issues, helping him get a less stressful job as a sous-chef at a nursing home instead of working at busy stressful cafe. I got him therapy, cleaned the home, cooked meals. Watched his depression get worse and then better, I encourgaged him to go to the gym to help manage his weight, we had done this together for a while before he had gave up due to fatigue and pain. 

I had no friends, close family and just him. Id always had extreme difficulty keeping friendships throughout my life. We went on holiday to Brisbane the previous year to see his brother that he was close with, me and his brother never really saw eye-to-eye but we tolersted each other.
His friends visited town when we got back around october, he went for drinks and dinner. Id met them a few times before and while they were kind to me, they would always be mainly my partners friends.

The dinner was awkward, I was tired from studying for my animal care certificate and was still working a few nights a week. They had known I was trying to re-skill and knew id loved animals all my life, I was truly what I wanted to do.
I was quiet and looked at my phone, while they chatted and laughed. I didn't feel I had much to contribute to the subjects they were talking about at the time.

We went home and the next day my partner was angry, his friends had called him in private the next day. Calling me rude, his brother had said he'd always thought I wasn't good enough for him.

His parents then found out, un-invited me to the upcoming family christmas event, basically a week long holdiay where his brother came to visit for a while.
My partners mother said I wasn't welcome because I had hurt his son, failed to get along with his friends, and hadn't worked hard enough for him in years. In their eyes I had phoned in the relationship years ago.

I was devasted, begged and cried, my family said I needed work harder too. The only friend in the world I had for free months was my mother, she was one of the few people who knew how much background work I put in around the home to keep my partner happy. He rarely picked up after himself or washed his own clothes without my asking.

Things settled down, I got more work the following year during the easter holidays. My work hours fluctuated a lot depending on how busy it was, I could get 1 shift one week and maybe 4 the next. The instability of this was getting to my partner. Mind you these were only 2-3 hour night shifts so I had little right to complain when I was tired. After all he worked 5 days a week with 6-7 to hour shifts. Money was more tight than ever.

He went to a week long bachelor party in Brisbane as one of his friends was getting married. I didn't expect an invite, but wasn't worried as he wasn't the kind of person to cheat.
I drove him the airport and then picked him up the following week, I had missed him and was scared the whole week as id always hated living by myself. Not to mention we live on a street where known drug addicts hung out quite regularly.

He came home affectionate, and things were fine for another month before he went back to Brisbane again  for the actual wedding, a wedding of which I wasn't invited to. 
I didn't want to be petty about someone elses wedding and told him to have fun, and to pass on my best wishes to the bride and groom. He had told me they had a small budget and were trying to keep the wedding small, I understood.

This disgusted my parents however, they were already sore about the xmas fiasco thought I was being disencluded on purpose. I once again defended my partner numerous times saying he was a good man who worked hard.
The nights became quiet, we didn't speak much but he would say over and over that he needed help with the fiances that we were barley getting by.

I promised him I would work harder, and spent two weeks trying to find second job.

I was ecstatic when I secured an interview at macdonalds and could finally breathe a sigh of relief that I finally have more stable hours and work.

He however wasn't so impressed. He didn't believe I would be able to keep this job as id failed many others. 
He told me he loved me so much over the weekend. Then on Tuesday we went unusally quiet, coming home later then when my night shifts started, I loved seeing him before I left for work, he knew this. I wouldn't see him until I got home and he'd be playing games online with his friends. Ordering pizza, leaving messes all over the house.

Wednesday night the same thing happened, we exchanged hellos after I got home from work, then went back to gaming with his friends again. I sensed some resentment, so I kept quiet and went to bed hopefully giving him some space was what he needed, perhaps he was tired, after all he worked hard.
He came to bed at 10pm said goodnight, I said goodnight and that I loved him but he said ""I don't know if I love you anymore."" My heart sank, I asked where this had come from through tears, he watched me cry and asked why I hadnt been trying hard enough to get more work.

I tried to explain that'd id been trying hard and that I was sorry, he dismissed this as he had heard these things many times over the months. He said it was disrespectful I couldn't get more hours and just tried get new jobs when things got hard.

I slept on the couch that night and wept, the following night I had had a horrible night at the restaurant, many late orders, many angry customers yelling at me. I came home to his silence, he didn't join me on the bed, he slept on the couch to avoid me that night.

I got up early the next morning, made his favourite breakfast scrambled eggs sourdough toast and coffee. I placed it in front of him while he was sleeping, thinking I was giving him something nice to wake up to

I tried to plugging it in another outlet, removing the ram and the gpu but to no avail, it shows no signs of being alive, everything is perfectly connected and worked flawlessly for two whole months so I doubt is the connections or the cpu.

Ever felt like you’re sprinting on a treadmill but going nowhere? 🙈 Yeah, me too. We’ve all been there—pushing through deadlines, juggling a million tasks, and somehow feeling even more burnt out. Sound familiar? 

I recently hit a wall of exhaustion, and let me tell you… it was *not* cute. I was in full hyper-achievement mode: the nonstop hustle, the “I can sleep when I’m dead” mindset. Big shocker… it wasn’t working. So, I decided to try something that, at first, seemed utterly **useless**—a 5-minute ritual that’s transformed my approach to productivity. 

Here’s what I did:

1. **Set a timer for 5 minutes.**  
    Yes, just five. This isn’t a major commitment. You could almost call it a snack break—if snacks were emotions.

2. **Grab a journal or a piece of paper.**  
    I can already hear the groans about journaling. *But why?* What’s the point? Well, this isn't about writing a novel. It’s about dumping your brain. Just write down everything swirling in your head. 

3. **Free-write like no one’s watching.**  
    Don’t filter. Just let the words spill out—your worries, ideas, dreams, or that random thought about the squirrel you saw this morning. (Seriously, why was it so fluffy?)

4. **Take a deep breath.**  
    Challenge yourself to take one *real* deep breath after writing. It feels like a mini-reset. Sometimes you just want to feel your lungs open up and let the chaos out! 

5. **Close your eyes and visualize your next steps.**  
    Picture where you want to go, not what you must do. It’s like hitting pause and instead of zooming into your task list, you get the bird’s-eye view of your journey. 

And voilà! 🌟 You’ve just given yourself space to breathe and *think.* 

Why on Earth did this work? I honestly thought I was wasting time. But surprisingly, it turned the chaos into clarity. Here are a few *side effects* I noticed:

- **Less Anxiety:** Like squeezing a pimple, it felt oddly satisfying to pop those racing thoughts.
- **Heightened Focus:** Once I let it out on the page, I was ready to tackle my tasks without the mental fog.
- **Creative Flow:** New ideas started popping up, sometimes when I least expected them. I mean, who doesn’t want to be a genius while sipping coffee? 

Okay, I know this sounds cliché, but *this little ritual was a game-changer for me*. Have you ever tried something that felt ridiculous at first but ended up being super effective? What unusual habits have helped you? Or are we all just secretly unicorns pretending to have it together? 🦄✨

|2|Metoprolol 25mg|Prescription|1 tab a day|Night|High BP|
|3|Finasteride 1mg|Prescription|1 tab a day|Night|Hair Loss|
|4|Foundational Multivitamin (B6-Free)|Desert Harvest Low-Acid Multi-Vitamin Supplement (no B6)|1 capsule daily | With a meal. Consider taking at least 2 hours apart from Metoprolol as multivitamins with minerals may decrease Metoprolol's effects. |To replace the discontinued B Activ and provide broad nutrient coverage without adding to your elevated Vitamin B6 levels. This covers general nutrient gaps common in vegetarian diets and provides foundational support for various vitamins and minerals|
|5| Iron + B12 Complex| MegaFood Blood Builder Iron Supplement (with Vitamin C & B12) | As per product label (e.g., 1 tablet; check for elemental iron, B12, C content to ensure it meets your higher needs) | Morning, away from meals or coffee, and with a Vitamin C-rich food or beverage to maximize absorption. Avoid taking with milk, calcium, or antacids (wait at least 2 hours). Consider taking at least 2 hours apart from Metoprolol if it contains minerals that might decrease Metoprolol's effects. |Crucial due to Metformin & Vegetarian Diet: Metformin is known to cause Vitamin B12 deficiency, and your initial B12 was low-normal with elevated homocysteine. Iron stores are depleted (low ferritin, low % saturation) , common in vegetarians. This combination addresses these specific deficiencies.|
|6| Vitamin D3 + K2| XYMOGEN K2-D3 5000 Vitamin D3 |1 capsule daily (providing 5,000 IU Vitamin D3)|With a meal containing fat|Your Vitamin D is insufficient (29 L ng/mL) , common in vegetarians. This specific product provides a good dose of D3 and includes K2, which is beneficial for bone and cardiovascular health|
|7|Magnesium Complex|Amazon Elements - Chelated Magnesium|200-400 mg daily, split doses if needed |Post-workout or in the evening for muscle relaxation; can be taken with a meal to avoid gastrointestinal upset.|Crucial due to Metformin: Metformin can interfere with magnesium absorption and excretion.

Taking them with Metformin and Quercetin (which also lower blood sugar and improve insulin sensitivity) significantly increases the risk of hypoglycemia. Berberine may also increase Metformin levels. Imperative to monitor blood sugar closely and discuss with your healthcare professional before starting.|

Hey, MaximizeMe crew! 🌟 Let me hit you with a question: ever find yourself staring blankly at your screen, scrolling through tabs like it’s an Olympic sport? Been there! 

But here’s the kicker—what if I told you that making just one tiny tweak to your routine could change the game for your focus? Yup, no magical elixirs or crazy productivity hacks required!

I’ll start with my little gem: **the “5-Minute Rule.”** Here’s how it works:

- **Set a Timer:** When I feel my attention starting to drift, I set a timer for **5 minutes**. Just 5! It’s like *cheating the system* because who can resist a quick sprint?
- **Dive In:** For those short 5 minutes, I focus on the task at hand. It’s like a mini commitment. And honestly, once I start, I often forget about the time!
- **Celebrate Mini Wins:** When the timer goes off, I choose whether to keep going or take a quick break. Either way, I’m already ahead!

Why does this work? Well, there’s something about the **low-pressure vibe** of just 5 minutes that makes me say, “Hey, I can do this!” Plus, it feels incredibly satisfying to check off that tiny victory. 🎉

Here’s the fun part: **think about your own tiny habits!** Maybe it’s:

- **A morning ritual:** Like that first cup of coffee that gets you in the zone.
- **A playlist:** That one song that puts you in the perfect mood to work.
- **A designated workspace:** Where magic (or at least some focused work) happens.

And come on, who hasn’t felt like a superhero after finally hammering out a task you thought would take forever?

So what’s the tiny habit that’s changed the way you focus? Is it something quirky or totally relatable? Let’s swap stories and maybe uncover some fresh ideas to level up our focus game! ✨",1,1748992367.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

He let me know the deal…that he was ceasing packaging beans himself and had an abundance of coffee left over that was never going to ship. We met up and this is what he pulls out amongst other sealed bags of roasters from previous offerings…

Diving into these sealed or previously sealed KGs I have no doubt that every single package I’ve received has been the beans that were described on the label. I find it fascinating that there are so many people who are hating on rotation, trying to throw shade, and promote devaluation and inauthenticity of the product provided. 

Those who are hating have never bought from rotation with the sincere intent of enjoying the coffee or service. Only looking to poke holes and create problems for something that makes their identity easily accessible to the casual coffee drinker.

How can you have a negative opinion of a service if you’ve never attempted to see the value…or better yet PURCHASED THE SERVICE PROVIDED!? 

I used to think he was paranoid talking about the haters and the down voters, but it’s becoming more and more clear that it’s a MINORITY of people in the pour over community, and more likely a small group of people creating fake accounts to downvote and gatekeep. 

The fact that he allows comments to be shown and seen by the community shows the transparency going on. The price shows the transparency you won’t get, even from the roasters themselves. So, that being said… I’ll invite the naysayers and criticizers to join in…on one rotation and give your HONEST AND UNBIASED feedback of the product and service provided. Let us know what you think and why we are crazy for buying coffee from a dude who did the leg work of packaging hundreds of baggies in his kitchen… tell me why I am wrong and why the service sucks…in the meantime I’ll stay drippin and keep sippin, most importantly I’ll keep Rotatin’ and L-I-V-I-N’ and I hope you do the same.

But yeah! I seek connection! At this point I'm more interested in friendships, so be prepared for a slow burn and getting to know each other first if you want dating.

The reason I am here is because I'm at a stage where I'm drifting from my longer term friends, and I'm finding it tough to meet new people. I also just can't stand how social/dating apps are anymore. In my experience, it's a whole lot of the same superficial crap or the most unrelatable people you can imagine, again and again, whether you're willing to empty your pockets for the app companies or not, and I really do not care to participate anymore. Even Reddit is pushing it a lot of days.

I'd describe myself as someone into a lot of different things. I'm creative and I love art, design, photography, and music. I love vintage/retro aesthetics. Not so much vintage mindsets. Love me my vinyls and earth tone colours tho. I'm not super athletic but I'm into the concept lol. I like being outdoors cycling or walking. I appreciate nature as well as doing something for my health once in a while. I also like food. And coffee. Sometimes I am too introspective. I don't know if that paints an accurate picture of me, but I can always fill in the blanks later!

1l2q61g,https://www.reddit.com/r/badreviewer/comments/1l2q61g/lenovo_thinkpad_e16_g2_reviewed_bad_reviewers/,Lenovo ThinkPad E16 G2 Reviewed: Bad Reviewers Real-World Test,"Can a 16-inch ThinkPad actually combine desk-hogging power, real-world portability, and all-day battery—without feeling like you’re lugging a cinder block to every meeting? The [Lenovo ThinkPad E16 G2](https://amzn.to/4kQ1MRg), at $1,249, promises to be the **best business laptop 2025** for serious professionals. I chose it for its stellar keyboard reputation, upgraded Intel Core Ultra chip, and business durability. My week-long test: daily office use, Zoom marathons, spreadsheet wrangling, and late-night edits.

# Hardware Specifications & Performance

This E16 G2 packs an Intel Core Ultra 7 (155H) with 16GB DDR5 RAM and a rapid 1TB PCIe Gen4 SSD—specs fit for a power user. Applications like Excel, Photoshop, and 20-tab Chrome sessions run without a hiccup. The integrated Intel Arc GPU isn’t a gaming beast, but it handles FHD+ video conferencing, light creative workloads, and 4K video playback with ease. For a **Lenovo ThinkPad for work**, you’re getting serious multi-tasking, snappy boot times (\~8 seconds), and silent operation during most workloads.

Thermals remain respectable, with fan noise staying under 45 dB even during heavy file exports. If you need raw performance in a [business laptop under 1300](https://amzn.to/4kQ1MRg), this is solid value.

# Display & Graphics Quality

The 16” FHD+ (1920×1200) IPS display delivers crisp text and vibrant colors—great for spreadsheets and presentations. The anti-glare finish banishes most reflections, and 300 nits brightness is adequate for office lighting (though outdoor use remains challenging). 100% sRGB coverage means it’s decent for photo and design work but not quite pro-grade.

Bezels are pleasingly slim, and the 16:10 aspect ratio gives you more vertical space for documents. The 1080p webcam with privacy shutter is a welcome upgrade—sharp enough for professional calls, with dual mics that filter out background noise.

# Battery Life & Charging

Lenovo promises up to 13 hours on the 57Wh battery. Real-world results: 9–10 hours with moderate use (Wi-Fi, light brightness, video calls) and about 7 hours for constant heavy multitasking. The included 65W USB-C charger powers you from 10% to 80% in under an hour. For a **laptop with long battery life** in the 16-inch class, this is genuinely impressive.

# Keyboard, Trackpad & Build

Typing on the ThinkPad E16 G2 is a dream—iconic scalloped keys, deep 1.8mm travel, and satisfying tactile feedback. The full-size keyboard includes a numpad, perfect for spreadsheet wranglers. The ThinkPad’s signature red TrackPoint remains, and the glass trackpad is smooth, accurate, and spacious.

Build quality is stellar: the MIL-STD-810H-tested chassis combines aluminum and reinforced polycarbonate. The laptop shrugged off a coffee spill and a brief drop from a desk (oops). At 1.76kg (3.9 lbs), it’s portable for its size but not ultrabook-light—still, for a **durable business laptop**, it’s a fair tradeoff.

# Connectivity & Ports

Connectivity is superb: 2x Thunderbolt 4, HDMI 2.1, Ethernet, dual USB-A, microSD, and a combo jack. Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 make this future-proof for office networking. No awkward dongle dependance here; it handled external displays, projectors, and SSD drives with zero hassle.

# Security & Management

A fingerprint reader embedded in the power button, IR facial recognition, and a physical webcam shutter cover your security bases. TPM 2.0 encryption and Lenovo’s suite of ThinkShield tools keep your work data locked down. IT managers will appreciate accessible BIOS settings and vPro manageability (on select configs).

# Pros & Cons

**Pros:**

* Fast Intel Core Ultra 7 + 16GB RAM
* Incredible ThinkPad keyboard and trackpad
* 9–10 hour real-world battery life
* Abundant ports, Thunderbolt 4 support
* Rugged, spill-resistant build

**Cons:**

* A bit heavy for constant travel
* Display could be brighter for outdoor use
* Integrated GPU not for gaming/3D work
* Pricey for students or non-business buyers

# Value Proposition & Price Analysis

At $1,249, the[ E16 G2](https://amzn.to/4kQ1MRg) undercuts flagship X1 Carbons and MacBook Pros but beats midrange rivals like the Dell Inspiron 16 Plus ($1,099) and HP EliteBook 860 ($1,339) in build quality and keyboard feel. For execs, engineers, and spreadsheet power users, it’s a **value leader** in the **16-inch business laptop** space.

# Final Verdict & Recommendation

  
[The Lenovo ThinkPad E16 G2](https://amzn.to/4kQ1MRg) nails the business essentials: performance, durability, battery, and a keyboard you’ll actually love. For professionals who need a big, dependable laptop that won’t fall apart or run dry halfway through a workday, it stands tall.

I know some people are going to say that is is Ai or fake, and I have no reason to right this other than to get it off my chest) 

I(24F) contacted my my father(43M) who abandoned us on Instagram and didn't tell him I was his daughter. I didn't know my dad for most of my life. My mom told me he left when he found out about her pregnancy, despite that I never really hated him for that. I wanted to meet him. I moved out of my mom's apartment when I was 24 and out of college. I used my I saved of from my work to buy an apartment. Around this time I began looking for my dad through the internet and I was able to find the city he lived in and his social media.

 I contacted him through his Instagram and we started talking, and I liked talking to him, and it sounds stupid reading this over but I never told him I was his daughter. We continued talking and nou talking became more personal, he told me about his life, his job, his dating life, but everytime he asked me about my life I lied. I made up stories about my life, I said I grew up with both parents and lied about the reason I contacted him. 

Looking back on that point in my life, I realised that I was afraid to tell him the truth because I thought he would leave. This sounds so cliche and it is, but it hurts me to read this and tink I could have a genuine platonic relationship with him if I didn't lie. 

 We talked through social media for a while before he asked to meet me. I took a train to Chicago and met with him a coffee shop. We were on a date and I hadn't realised it, it didn't click that he invited a woman he had no relationship with out for coffee. I didn't think at least until the end that he thought of me that way. We talked for a while, a long while and I never brought up the fact that he was my father.

 Our conversation lasted like over an hour and during that time he would touch my had or my arm I a way that made me uncomfortable it felt like he  was getting closer to me even though he didn't move from his seat. I realised that he thought this was a date, he must have realised something was wrong with me and he said something that I don't remember. 

I don't know why but I whispered to he and told him I was his daughter. He responded with something like ""oh that's  a weird joke"" or something like that but I just repeated what I said and said that he was uncomfortable. I showed him some pictures of the website I was planning to send him, and got mad rightfully. He left the shop, I couldn't contact him on his social media for two weeks now I have tried looking for people close to him to contact but I couldn't find anyone. This all happened like a few months ago and at this point I don't care anymore and just want to get past this part of my life.",5,1748991675.0,AmItheAsshole,9,0.86,False

Unlocking the Secrets of Affordable Airfare: Your Guide to Nabbing Those Sweet Flight Coupons
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Traveling, isn’t it just the best? I mean, the thrill of exploring somewhere new, the smells of a foreign city, the taste of unfamiliar food – it’s an experience unlike any other. But oh, the cost! For many of us, the biggest hurdle to jet-setting is the price of the plane ticket. It can feel like you need to take out a second mortgage just to cross borders. Well, guess what? It doesn't always have to be that way. There are savvy ways to chip away at those hefty prices, and one of the most effective is mastering the art of finding and using *flight coupons*. Consider this your insider's guide, a roadmap to navigating the often-confusing landscape of discounted travel. We're going to unravel the mysteries, expose the best strategies, and hopefully, help you book that trip you’ve been dreaming about without breaking the bank.

### What Exactly Are Flight Coupons, Anyway? More Than Just a Few Pennies Off

So, you hear the term ""flight coupons,"" and you might picture those flimsy paper things your grandma clipped out of the newspaper for the grocery store. While the concept is similar – a discount on a purchase – *flight coupons* in the travel world are usually digital. Think of them as special codes, vouchers, or links that, when applied during the booking process, knock a certain amount of money off the total fare. They're essentially promotional offers from airlines, online travel agencies (OTAs), or even third-party sites, designed to incentivize you to book through them. They can come in various forms, each with its own little quirks and conditions.

They aren't always straightforward ""X dollars off,"" either. Sometimes they're percentage-based discounts, sometimes they offer free checked bags, priority boarding, or even lounge access – perks that can significantly enhance your travel experience and save you money indirectly. Knowing the different types available is half the battle when it comes to maximizing your savings. It's not just about finding *a* coupon; it's about finding the *right* coupon for your specific travel needs. Are you a solo traveler with just a carry-on? A percentage-based discount on the fare might be best. Traveling with a family and lots of luggage? A coupon offering free checked bags could be a game-changer.

### The Different Stripes of Flight Coupons: A Taxonomy of Savings

Not all flight coupons are created equal, folks. Just like there are different types of travelers, there are different ways these discounts manifest. Understanding the nuances of each type will help you sniff out the best deals and avoid wasting time on offers that aren't a good fit for you. Let's break down some of the most common varieties you'll encounter in your quest for cheaper flights.

- **Percentage-Based Discounts:** These are pretty straightforward. They offer a percentage off the base fare (often excluding taxes and fees, so read the fine print!). For example, a 10% off coupon on a $500 fare would save you $50. These are great for more expensive tickets where a percentage can really add up.
- **Fixed-Amount Discounts:** These coupons deduct a specific dollar amount from your total. Think ""$50 off your next flight."" These can be particularly valuable on shorter, less expensive flights where a percentage discount might be negligible.
- **Promo Codes:** This is probably the most common form. You’ll find a string of letters and numbers that you enter into a designated field during checkout to apply the discount. Keeping track of valid promo codes is key to unlocking these savings.
- **Vouchers:** Sometimes, especially if you've had a trip disruption or participated in a program, an airline might issue you a voucher for a certain amount that can be applied towards a future flight. These are essentially personalized coupons.
- **Travel Credit:** Similar to vouchers, travel credit is usually issued by an airline or OTA and can be used for future bookings. It's often tied to a specific account or individual.
- **Bundled Deals:** Not strictly *flight coupons* themselves, but sometimes you'll find packages that combine flights with hotels or car rentals, offering a combined discount that’s better than booking each separately. While not a standalone flight coupon, they can offer significant overall savings.

Knowing what you're looking at when you stumble upon an offer is the first step to successfully using it. Don't just assume all ""discounts"" are the same; dig a little deeper to understand the mechanism behind the saving.

### Where the Heck Do You Even Find These Elusive Gems? The Great Coupon Hunt

Okay, so you know what *flight coupons* are and the different kinds out there. Now for the million-dollar question (or maybe the hundred-dollar question, which is the point, right?): Where on earth do you actually *find* these things? It's not like they're plastered on billboards or raining down from the sky. You need to know where to look, and sometimes, you need to do a little digging. Think of yourself as a travel detective, sleuthing for those sweet deals. There are several avenues to explore, and often, the best strategy involves a multi-pronged approach. Don't just rely on one source; cast a wide net!

- **Airline Websites and Newsletters:** This is your primary hunting ground. Airlines frequently run promotions and share **flight coupons** directly with their subscribers. Sign up for their email lists – yes, I know, more emails – but seriously, this is where you'll get early access to sales and exclusive subscriber-only deals. Check their ""Deals"" or ""Promotions"" sections on their websites regularly.
- **Online Travel Agencies (OTAs):** Sites like Expedia, Booking.com, and Orbitz also issue coupons and run promotions. They often have their own loyalty programs that can earn you discounts on future bookings. Like airlines, subscribing to their newsletters is a smart move.
- **Coupon Websites:** There are dedicated websites that aggregate coupons and promo codes from various retailers, including airlines and OTAs. Sites like RetailMeNot, Coupons.com, and Honey (a browser extension that automatically searches for and applies coupons) can be incredibly helpful. However, be a little wary and double-check the validity of codes from these sites, as they aren't always up-to-date.
- **Social Media:** Follow airlines and OTAs on platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. They often announce flash sales and share promo codes with their followers. Engage with their content – sometimes they even run contests or giveaways that include flight vouchers!
- **Travel Blogs and Forums:** Many travel bloggers and enthusiasts share the deals they find. Follow your favorite travel blogs, join online travel forums, and participate in discussions. Other savvy travelers are often happy to share their findings.
- **Credit Card Rewards Programs:** This is a big one for many people. Travel-focused credit cards often offer points or miles that can be redeemed for flights, which is essentially like getting a flight coupon for your loyalty. Some cards even offer statement credits specifically for travel purchases.
- **Loyalty Programs:** Beyond credit cards, signing up for the loyalty programs of your preferred airlines can unlock benefits like discounted fares, upgrade opportunities, and sometimes, actual coupons or vouchers.

Remember, consistency is key. Finding the best **flight coupons** often requires a bit of routine checking and being in the right place at the right time (digitally speaking, of course!).

### The Fine Print Facts: Understanding the Nitty-Gritty Requirements of Flight Coupons

Alright, you've found a promising-looking *flight coupon*. Score! But before you get too excited and start packing your bags, you absolutely, positively *must* read the fine print. I know, I know, it’s tedious, but believe me, skipping this step can lead to disappointment faster than you can say ""boarding pass."" **Flight coupons** almost always come with strings attached, conditions that determine whether or not you can actually use them. Ignoring these details is like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole – it just ain't gonna work.

Here are some of the crucial things to look out for in the terms and conditions:

- **Travel Dates and Blackout Periods:** This is the most common restriction. Most coupons are only valid for travel within a specific timeframe. They often exclude peak travel periods like holidays, summer vacation, or major events. Make sure your desired travel dates fall within the valid window.
- **Departure and Arrival Cities:** Some coupons are region-specific. They might only be valid for flights departing from or arriving at certain airports or countries. Don't assume a coupon for ""any flight"" actually means *any* flight.
- **Minimum Spend Requirement:** You might need to spend a certain amount on the fare before the coupon can be applied. For example, ""$20 off a flight of $200 or more.""
- **Specific Airlines or Routes:** Many coupons are tied to a particular airline or even a specific route. A coupon for ""Delta flights"" won't work on American Airlines, obviously.
- **One-Time Use:** Most coupons are for single use only per account or booking.
- **Expiration Date:** This is a no-brainer, but make sure the coupon is still valid when you plan to book and travel.
- **Exclusions:** Coupons often exclude certain fare classes (like basic economy), specific routes, or ancillary fees.
- **Combinability:** Can you use this coupon in conjunction with other discounts or offers? Usually not, but it's worth checking.

Seriously, folks, taking a few minutes to understand these terms can save you a lot of frustration down the line. Don't get your hopes up based on a headline discount only to find out it doesn't apply to your desired trip.

### Timing is Everything: When to Strike While the Iron is Hot

Finding **flight coupons** is one thing, but knowing *when* to look and *when* to book is another crucial piece of the puzzle. Just like buying stocks or real estate, the timing of your flight booking can significantly impact the price. And guess what? The availability and effectiveness of flight coupons can also be linked to timing. It’s a bit of a dance between finding deals and knowing when those deals are most likely to appear and be most beneficial.

- **During Sales and Promotions:** Airlines and OTAs frequently run sales, often tied to holidays, specific seasons, or even just random promotional periods. This is when you're most likely to find widespread **flight coupons** and discounted fares. Keep an eye out for announcements.
- **Off-Peak Season:** Traveling during the shoulder season (the time between peak and off-peak) or the actual off-peak season usually means lower fares anyway. Combine those lower fares with a coupon, and you can score some serious savings.
- **Mid-Week Booking:** While not a hard and fast rule, booking your flight on a Tuesday or Wednesday is often cited as the best time to find lower prices. Airlines sometimes release new deals or adjust prices early in the week.
- **Last-Minute Deals (Use with Caution!):** Sometimes, airlines offer last-minute deals on flights they haven't filled. While these can be cheap, they're not consistent and can be risky if you have a fixed travel schedule. However, you might find last-minute **flight coupons** from third-party sites trying to offload inventory.
- **Subscriber Exclusives:** As mentioned before, signing up for newsletters often gives you early access to deals and coupons before they are widely advertised. This gives you a leg up on the competition.

Think of it like fishing. You need to know where the fish are biting and when they're most active. With **flight coupons**, the ""fish"" are the discounts, and you need to be in the right digital waters at the right time. Patience and persistence are key here.

### Beyond the Coupon Code: Other Savvy Ways to Save on Flights

While **flight coupons** are a fantastic tool for saving money on airfare, they aren't the only game in town. Savvy travelers employ a range of strategies to keep their travel costs down. Combining these tactics with your coupon hunting can lead to even greater savings. Don't put all your eggs in one basket, so to speak. Diversifying your approach is smart.

Here are some other tried and true methods for reducing the cost of your flights:

- **Be Flexible with Your Dates:** If you can adjust your travel dates by a day or two, you might find significantly cheaper fares. Flying on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and often Saturdays can be less expensive than flying on Fridays or Sundays. Use flexible date search tools on flight comparison websites.
- **Consider Different Airports:** Sometimes, flying into or out of a nearby, smaller airport can be cheaper than using the main international hub. Factor in the cost and time of getting to and from the alternate airport, of course.
- **Fly with Budget Airlines:** While they might not always offer coupons in the traditional sense, budget airlines inherently offer lower fares. Just be mindful of their fees for things like checked baggage, seat selection, and even carry-on bags – these can quickly add up! Read their policies carefully.
- **Fly During the Off-Season:** We touched on this earlier, but it bears repeating. Traveling during the off-peak season for your destination can dramatically reduce flight and accommodation costs. You'll also encounter fewer crowds.
- **Set Fare Alerts:** Most flight comparison websites allow you to set alerts for specific routes. You'll be notified when the price changes, allowing you to book when the fare drops to your desired level.
- **Use Flight Comparison Websites:** Sites like Google Flights, Skyscanner, and Kayak are invaluable for comparing prices across multiple airlines and OTAs. They also have tools for finding flexible dates and exploring different destinations.
- **Clear Your Browser Cookies (Sometimes!):** There's an ongoing debate about whether clearing your browser cookies actually lowers flight prices. The theory is that travel websites might increase prices when they see you've searched for a route multiple times. While not a proven fact, it doesn't hurt to try booking incognito or on a different browser after searching extensively.
- **Consider Connecting Flights:** Direct flights are convenient, but often more expensive. Connecting flights can be cheaper, although they add travel time. Weigh the cost savings against the added time and potential for delays.
- **Bundle Flights and Accommodation:** As briefly mentioned before, booking your flight and hotel together through an OTA can sometimes result in a package discount.

By employing a combination of these strategies, you'll be well on your way to becoming a master of affordable air travel. **Flight coupons** are a powerful tool, but they're most effective when used in conjunction with other smart travel hacks.

### Tales from the Trenches: Real-Life Experiences with Flight Coupons

You know, it’s all well and good to talk about the theory of finding and using *flight coupons*, but hearing about real people who’ve actually saved money doing it can be really motivating. I’ve got a few stories, both my own and from fellow travelers I know, that highlight just how effective these little snippets of savings can be. They’re not always glamorous tales, but they demonstrate the tangible benefits.

My friend Sarah, for instance, managed to get a pretty sweet deal on a flight to Europe last year. She’s a big subscriber to airline newsletters, and she received an email about a limited-time promo code for 15% off flights to select European cities. She was already planning a trip, and luckily, her desired destination was on the list and her travel dates fell within the valid period. That 15% saved her a good chunk of change, enough to splurge on a fancy dinner once she got there. She swears by signing up for those newsletters now, even if it means wading through a few extra emails each day.

Then there’s David, who’s a pro at using his travel credit card points. He rarely pays full price for flights anymore because he strategically uses his card for everyday purchases to rack up points. He recently redeemed a huge chunk of points for a free round trip flight to visit his family across the country. While not a traditional coupon in the sense of a discount *code*, it functions exactly the same way – it significantly reduces the out-of-pocket cost of the flight.

Another case in point: my own experience. I was booking a domestic flight for a quick weekend getaway. I usually check a few different OTAs to compare prices. On one site, I noticed a banner advertising `$25 off your first booking with a code`. It wasn’t a massive discount compared to the total fare, but hey, $25 is $25! It covered the cost of roughly three fancy coffees at the airport, which, let’s be honest, is a win in itself. It just goes to show that even smaller, seemingly insignificant coupons can add up and make a difference in your overall travel budget.

These stories, and countless others like them, illustrate that finding and using **flight coupons** isn't some mythical quest. It's a tangible way to save money on travel, and with a little effort and know-how, you can absolutely make it work for you.

### Common Pitfalls and How to Steer Clear: Avoiding the Coupon Catastrophes

As with anything good in life, there can be a few bumps in the road when it comes to **flight coupons**. You might encounter expired codes, confusing terms, or just plain old disappointment when a coupon doesn't work as you expected. Don't let these potential pitfalls discourage you! By being aware of them and knowing how to navigate them, you can minimize frustration and maximize your chances of success.

Here are some common issues you might run into and tips on how to avoid them:

- **Expired Coupons:** This is probably the most frequent problem. You find a seemingly great code, but when you go to apply it, it’s invalid. **Prevention:** Always check the expiration date before you get too invested. If it's not immediately obvious, look for an ""Offer Details"" or ""Terms and Conditions"" link.
- **Ignoring the Fine Print:** We’ve hammered this point home, but it's worth repeating. If you don’t read the terms, you might try to use a coupon on a flight that’s not eligible (wrong dates, wrong destination, etc.). **Prevention:** Seriously, read the terms and conditions! It might take an extra minute or two, but it will save you time and frustration in the long run.
- **Invalid Codes from Third-Party Sites:** While coupon aggregation sites can be helpful, they sometimes list codes that are no longer valid or were never legitimate to begin with. **Prevention:** Prioritize coupons found directly on airline or OTA websites or in their official communications. If you use a third-party site, be prepared for the possibility that the code might not work and have a backup plan.
- **Technical Glitches:** Occasionally, a valid code might just not apply correctly due to a website error. **Prevention:** If a code you know is valid isn't working, try refreshing the page, clearing your browser cache, or even trying a different browser. If the problem persists, contact the airline or OTA's customer service.
- **Assuming the Coupon is the Best Deal:** Don't let the excitement of a coupon blind you to potentially better deals elsewhere. Sometimes, even with a coupon applied, another airline or OTA might offer a lower base fare that ends up being cheaper overall. **Prevention:** Still compare prices across different platforms, even if you have a coupon. Don't put all your eggs in the coupon basket.
- **Over-Reliance on One Strategy:** Hoping to find a perfect coupon for every trip is unrealistic. **Prevention:** Combine coupon hunting with other money-saving strategies like being flexible with dates and airports, flying during the off-season, and using fare comparison tools.

By being mindful of these potential issues, you can approach your coupon hunt with realistic expectations and avoid unnecessary headaches.

### The Future of Flight Coupons: What's on the Horizon?

The world of travel is constantly evolving, and the way we find and use discounts, including *flight coupons*, is likely to change too. With advancements in technology and the increasing personalization of online experiences, we might see even more targeted and unique offers in the future. It's kind of exciting to think about what's coming down the pipeline, isn't it?

Here are some possibilities for how **flight coupons** and travel discounts might evolve:

1. **Increased Personalization:** Airlines and OTAs are getting better at collecting data about our travel habits. This could lead to highly personalized coupon offers based on your past destinations, preferred airlines, and even your browsing history. Imagine getting a coupon specifically for a destination you've been researching!
2. **AI-Powered Coupon Discovery:** Artificial intelligence (AI) could play a bigger role in helping you find the best deals. Instead of you having to manually search coupon sites, AI could scan the web and alert you to relevant offers based on your travel plans.
3. **Blockchain and Secure Vouchers:** As blockchain technology becomes more mainstream, we might see the use of secure, verifiable digital vouchers that are less susceptible to fraud and easier to track.
4. **Gamification of Travel Savings:** Airlines and OTAs might introduce more elements of gamification to their loyalty programs and promotional offers, making the search for discounts more engaging and rewarding. Think challenges, badges, and hidden rewards for active users.
5. **Subscription Models for Discounts:** We’re already seeing subscription services pop up for various industries. Could there be a future where you pay a monthly fee for access to exclusive flight deals and coupons? It's a possibility.
6. **Integration with Smart Assistants:** Imagine asking your smart assistant, ""Hey Google, find me flight coupons for a trip to Paris next month,"" and getting relevant offers read out to you. Integration with voice assistants seems like a natural progression.

While these are just possibilities, they highlight the exciting potential for how technology could make finding and using **flight coupons** even more seamless and effective in the years to come.
