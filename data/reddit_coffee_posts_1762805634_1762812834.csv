Today I met up with a friend from work for coffee and then got a flat tire. The place we went to is about 20 minutes from my home but in a more city like place vs the suburbs. I called my husband cause this has never happened to me before especially since when I pumped air into it with the portable air pump it wouldn’t hold air at all. My husband said it was because I went to the city where they have all sorts of things in the road. 

He did tell me to pump air and then try to go to the auto shop that’s close but when I tried I couldn’t even make it a block before I could tell it was the rim on the road. So I called him and he said to call triple an and I did and made a membership. But I guess I just feel like he was not helpful and wish he could have offered to come. I’m curious if this bad situation I am in is just making me feel judgmental of my husband.  Those of you who’ve been in this situation, what were your significant others like during this and how can I approach this with my husband and tell him how I felt without him being mad? 

TLDR; flat tire and feel like my husband was no help

1otrkvq,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1otrkvq/bluetokais_quality_in_many_aspects_are_falling/,😞BlueTokai's QUALITY in many aspects are falling but prices skyrocketing !,"The signature drink of Vietnamese Coffee with Condensed Milk used to be made with in-house cold brews from Dhak Blend Coffee Beans. But now, due to “efficiency upgrade orders from the top,” they just use Cold Brew CANS. Can you imagine that? It used to be one of my favorite coffees, but now that awesomeness in flavor is lost. I sharply noticed the degradation of complex flavors that were previously present.

The second one was BLUETOKAI’S BEST, but it got discontinued more than two years ago. Previously available Mocha Chocolates from BlueTokai came in three varieties — Peppermint, Chillies, and Blue Salt chocolate powders for Mochas. Each one of them was heavenly good! The strong coffee and high-quality chocolate flavor with peppermint blew my mind many times in 2023 at BlueTokai in HSR Layout, Bangalore. Even as late as December 2023, it was still available. I remember the last time I had it at BlueTokai Kolkata on Park Street.
Now they simply use a very low-quality single-variety chocolate powder for Mochas — and it tastes like meh, or basically, shit!

Even many food items like Guacamole on Toast used to have in-house avocado paste that tasted really, really good. But now the paste is pre-made in factories, leading to a significant degradation in flavor. The same goes for other dishes that used fresh in-house avocado paste, such as Avocado Toast.

Recently, they launched Parmesan Velouté Ravioli at ₹525 — which is ridiculously expensive considering the tiny portion size. Plus, the ravioli pieces are pre-made, resulting in really bad flavor. At such steep prices, it must be made in-house.

The sizes of Suchali’s Sourdoughs have nearly been reduced by half, yet the prices remain the same — or only slightly cheaper. What the heck is happening?!

A new item, Berries, Bananas & Granola Smoothie Bowl, has been launched at ₹525. Has the Bluetokai administration gone mad? Or are they trying to earn 2–3 crore salaries annually in India?

BlueTokai Coffee Bean packets were previously made of non-light-passing aluminum or metalized polymer film packaging with a silver inner lining that blocked light. Now they use flimsy, pale-yellow plastic packaging — a serious downgrade, since coffee beans must be kept away from sunlight. Especially when strong sunlight enters my kitchen in the morning and falls directly on my coffee supplies, I’ve sharply noticed that my BlueTokai beans now lose flavor much faster than before, even within days, compared to the old packaging.

BlueTokai Pour-Over Sachets: Once my most-used product from BlueTokai, they are now unusable because of stale flavors. Previously, new batches of Easy Pour-Overs were released every 3–4 days, and when consumed within a month, they had such stunning and beautiful flavors — especially the Light Pink Box Seethargundu Estate | Light Roast – Easy Pour and the Orange Box Thogarihunkal | Medium Roast.

Now they are almost never refreshed weekly, or even monthly, in most BlueTokai shops. Most develop stale flavors that taste terrible after one or two months. I regularly see 5–7-month-old batches that taste like poison compared to their original, beautiful, stunning form.

Point Change:
I am highly dissatisfied after seeing the condition of the Indian coffee market and the capitalistic tendency of reducing quality while increasing prices.

I recently visited China — and have visited many times before — and I’ve been deeply impressed with their coffee and tea culture, especially the brand Luckin Coffee. Their coffees are amazing! I always order their coconut latte but ask them to use a bit less coconut milk so that the espresso flavor shines through. The taste is unbelievably good, and the prices are dirt cheap — around ₹120–130 per cup (9.9 yuan). Most other drinks cost just 12–13 yuan, roughly ₹140–160, and the quantity is enormous — 300, 400, or even 500 ml per cup.

Meanwhile, BlueTokai’s prices are ridiculous — ₹270, ₹280, ₹300 per cup — which equals 27–29 yuan. You can see the difference! Most other coffee and tea brands in China are much cheaper, higher in quality, and never increase their prices, even after years — despite the fact that the average Chinese is 5–7 times richer than the average Indian.

I feel far, far more comfortable in China because everywhere the food, coffee, and hotels are hygienic, cheap, and pristine in quality. I save a lot of money and still get excellent experiences.

I’d tried to quit many times before and always failed. In November 2019, I started using the patch but kept smoking anyway. For months I went back and forth , sometimes with the patch, sometimes without , but always lighting up again. I felt like the biggest loser.

Every morning started the same: cigarette and coffee. I’d smoke ten before even thinking about breakfast. I hated it, but I couldn’t seem to stop.
Then COVID hit. Suddenly people were dying, hospitals were packed, and I remember hearing that smokers were at higher risk and that care was being prioritized for non-smokers. That hit me hard . it was the motivation I needed.

So I made a real decision. I walked laps around my yard every day for months, fighting cravings and trying to breathe through them. Slowly, my lungs started to feel clearer. I stopped coughing in the mornings. My energy came back, and so did a bit of pride.
Back when I quit, a pack cost about $16 here in my province (for the cheap ones). It’s even more now , but the biggest savings have been in quality of life and self-respect.

I’ve been thinking a lot about how my productivity evolves over time. I realized that every time I hit a “crisis point”, I start to overthink and overorganize. I set up a perfect note-taking system: folders (Inbox, Project1, Project2), habit tracker, goals, and it all works great for about two weeks. Then it collapses.

Recently I noticed that I’m actually more productive and consistent when things are less structured. When I don’t have to jump across five tools just to update everything. Turns out, I only need one things: a place to throw notes quickly, without thinking about folders or categories, but still easy to search later.

1otrhpt,https://www.reddit.com/r/CABarExam/comments/1otrhpt/for_those_who_may_need_this_encouragement_taking/,For those who may need this encouragement taking the bar exam,"I graduated law school this past May. I always enjoyed law school and it was a very memorable experience for me. Prior to 3L, I received fairly good grades (few A's, mostly B's, maybe a C or two) and achieved whatever extracurriculars in law school I had set my mind to. However, 3L was a very dark time for me. My confidence was low, my passion was almost non-existent, and I had a lot of inner conflict going on. I was depressed- feeling like I didn't belong in this career anymore. I won't get deep into the reasoning, but I was in a terrible, terrible place mentally. 

Anyway, post-graduation came bar prep. I had a lot on the line. To be able to fully study in peace, some family members had to make arrangements for me that took away from their own plans. This further put stress one me, because if I didn't pass, I could not request this of them again for next time. Moreover, I had loans to repay, and not passing the bar meant studying while working for next time. 

I began studying for the bar with a well-known bar prep program. It an intensive 10-week course. All I saw on social media were people going to the gym at 5am, having a green smoothie, meditating, journaling, walking their dogs, whipping up a 5 course meal for lunch, and studying between the hours of 8am until evening. Many said ""treat it like a 9-5"" others said ""study until you can't study anymore."" Neither made sense. Everyone was so unrealistic, it made my mental health worse comparing myself to others. I couldn't fix my sleep schedule. I was consistently starting late in the day around noon, having maybe a bagel and some coffee, with a migraine. I would not leave the house for days on end. It felt like prison, solitary confinement. I didn't see friends or family. I would study til maybe 9pm, some days later. I was never able to wake up early all summer due to lack of structure. People said I would fail because of this, since the actual exam required starting early in the morning. 

I did my best studying all summer, but my best was never good enough. I scored a 55 on my first graded essay. This broke me. After, I scored a few 60's, and eventually the 65's came rolling in. I scored a 70 on my PT - this became my hope for passing the bar. My MBE scores were shit. I always sucked at multiple choice. It was the reason I didn't get more A's in law school. 200 MBE questions scared the shit out of me. I was so worried it would be the reason I didn't pass. The first MBE set assigned by the bar prep course, I got scored very low, maybe a 40%. My larger MBE sets were scoring anywhere between 50% to 65%. 65% was the best I ever did on a large mixed set. I did score better on U-World, though. I felt that the questions were more straight forward on U-World. But, point is, I was never scoring flying colors during bar prep. In fact, I scored more frequently between the 50-55% on MBE sets. It was incredibly discouraging, and a reminder that I was never going to be good at it. 

Let's fast forward. 

Bar exam day. I literally walked out both days thinking I failed. I cried a lot. I was crippled writing the exams, re-reading the fact patterns several times, because I didn't understand English in that moment anymore. The stress was so bad I felt paralyzed physically and mentally. My hands were trembling as I typed up the essays. I missed issues, I did a shit analysis for some parts, and my rules were not memorized perfectly. I would memorize rules by remembering the key parts of the rule and then just forming a sentence in that moment making sure I fit in the key parts. If I couldn't remember the rule perfectly, I made something up. I felt like I sounded like I was a 12 year old writing the essays. I am a fairly good writer, but under that time-pressure, my skill was slowly disintegrating. I managed to finish all the essays, with some essay answers longer and more thorough than others. On one of the essays, I did not know how to answer the last question. I made up bullshit. 2 sentences. There was also a subject I did not want to see on the exam, and it was there. I was conclusory in my analysis, and probably missed issues. I am not kidding my analysis for each issue was maybe 2-3 sentences on that subject. I wanted to end it all. 

On MBE day, the morning session was terrible. It was nothing like the practice sets we had done, and nothing like the U-World sets. These questions were never before seen questions (meaning the style of the question was new- incomparable to practice questions and no ""patterns"" to spot). I was praying they were experimental, but how could 100 questions have been experimental?! I was doomed. I literally guessed on everything- an ""educated"" guess, where I wasn't even to narrow any of them down. I just picked without elimination. I am slow at multiple choice. If I'm lucky, I can do a question in under 2 minutes. This meant being forced to pick an answer before feeling good about it. I wasn't even comprehending the fact patterns. I re-read them several times for one question, while everyone around me was already flipping pages moving onto the next questions. I blacked out during it. I don't know how I was picking answers. It became blind guesses towards the end when I was running out of time. I bubbled in RANDOM answers on the last 8 questions of the morning session. I thought that in it of itself was enough to fail me.

  
Afternoon MBE session was better- the questions seemed familiar both in style and information. I still made guesses. I probably guessed on half the afternoon session questions. I, again, ran out of time, and had to bubble in maybe 4-5 questions a random answer just to not leave it blank. 

  
After the bar exam, every time someone asked me how I think it went, I wanted to throw up and there was a pit in my stomach. But I couldn't lie. I couldn't fake a smile and say ""Good!"" So, I said the truth. ""It was terrible. I don't know. I can't think about it."" Every single person who knew me SWORE I passed. This actually made me feel worse, because if I didn't, imagine the disappointment they would feel and the embarrassment I would feel. I told them if I passed, it was the work of God. People couldn't understand why I didn't think I passed. And there wasn't a way to explain to those who had never taken the bar, let alone gone to law school. I was lonely. But, I chose to compartmentalize the bar exam. I never thought about it again all summer. I actually considered a change in career. I began taking better care of myself slowly, finding hobbies, going out, seeing family and friends who I had neglected. I almost felt relieved, like maybe I could do something else with my life and be stress-free and happy?! I was clearly going through a crisis. 

I also did not have a post-bar job lined up after graduation. A lot of people I knew had job offers or a job lined up from being with a firm for many years part-time. I applied to several jobs through out my 3L year. Either I didn't hear back, I didn't care for the job itself, or I got interviews that went well but I deep down knew it wasn't what I wanted so I never followed up. In my heart, I knew what area I cared to practice and what fueled my passion. Settling wasn't an option, but as more months passed without an offer, I started doubting myself. I applied to anything I could, hoping for something. But nothing was happening... my depression increased. I felt worthless. I began putting my faith in God. Praying constantly, crying to Him. I kept saying, ""I don't know how it's ever going to happen for me, but I know you'll make it happen somehow. I know you'll make it okay."" Without God, I would not have made it this far. So this was what my entire summer consisted of. 

Fast forward to November 7, 2025, I found out I passed the bar. I also got an amazing post-bar job in the Fall prior to results, in an area of law I enjoyed. It all fell into place. I am still beyond grateful for what transpired.

I know this was a long post, but I really want anyone out there who is in a dark place doubting themselves while studying for this exam (or maybe someone who just took it, if you are seeing this post months later) to know that it’s NEVER over. Even if you are absolutely convinced it’s over, it's not over. I promise. Just have faith. You got this.",1,1762812204.0,CABarExam,0,1.0,False

I am trying to find a black woman who is supportive and okay with leading a relationship. I would also like to meet in person one day if that is okay with you because I don't want to be mostly long distance or online if you live outside of California and are able to travel. I am into black women(it's also okay if you are partially black) because I find them attractive and are pretty in the best kind of way I can describe.

About me:

• I will be 19 this week.

• I'm a femboy. But not all the time since I have very few feminine clothing.

• I am 5'1 with a skinny build with a bit of chub. I also have fluffy black hair, brown eyes, and a cute baby face.

• I am kind of bilingual and can say a few phrases in Japanese, but know some Spanish.

• I want to do the best I can to help others and make others happy. I also like to think of ways I can do so I can help with things like chores.

• I am very good at cooking. So far, I am able to make stuff like sandwiches, hot chocolate, mocktails, and coffee that look and taste like the kind you would find at cafés and restaurants. I'm an amateur though, so it would look slightly messed up and I might need help with the stove and heat as I am afraid of getting burnt. I am still learning though, so that's good.

• I want a mostly FLR(female-led relationship) because I would want to be the one who helps prepare food and do some chores, since I do not like the traditional mindset. It would be great to be equals, but I want to be guided and taught to do my part well so I can be a good boyfriend. It is also because I am worried and scared that I might not be able to take care of myself when I am older and on my own.

• I can't drive yet and do not have a license. But I want to learn how to one day.

• I am a big(ironically lol) cuddle bunny and enjoy physical affection. So I like being comfy and enjoy stuff like snuggling, maybe lap pillows, being under a soft blanket while watching a movie, or anything that would sound nice. Because of this, I sometimes hate getting out of bed, and am also clingy.

• I am very timid and scared of most things, but will get brave and confident at times. Especially when I am very determined. But I am scared of things like the dark, loud noises, overstimulation, lightning, yelling, loneliness, and judgement for liking feminine stuff.

• Some of my interests are Sanrio(mostly Cinnamoroll and Kuromi), zoology, paleontology, cryptozoology, plushies, Japanese culture, Stitch, feminine clothing, 2000-2010s stuff, anime, and horror(I hate jumpscares though).

• I like going on daily walks sometimes mostly during the day. But I also go during the night when the is a lot of people or light.

• My top favorite bands are Ice Nine Kills, Simple Plan, No Doubt, Blink 1.82, Linkin Park(2000-2010s era), BTS, My Chemical Romance, Paramore, and Pierce The Veil. I also sing and play guitar and piano.

• I play on PlayStation 4, but not all the time as it tends to get boring and kind of stressful.

• My favorite flowers are cherry blossoms because they look elegant and to be honest, smell like cherry cola. Also because cherries are one of my favorite fruits and it is my favorite candy/frozen treat flavor.

• I have Snap, Insta, and Discord if you want to talk off here after a while. Same goes for gamer tags and pics. I do have TikTok, but I am not including it on the list just in case it gets shut down again.

• My top favorite foods are sandwiches, pizza, burgers, cookies, strawberries, rasberries, pineapples, blueberries, and parfaits.

• I am a writer and artist with big dreams of bringing my stories and the characters in them to the small and big screen. In animated, and maybe live-action form one day. I also plan to one day publish them and sell them.

• I sometimes like reading graphic novels, romance stories, movie novelizations, science books, manga, and funny books.

• I like movie musicals like KPop Demon Hunters and The Greatest Showman, aka, the kind where every ten minutes or so, they break out into song. This is a joke, so please do not take it seriously.

• I am into some gentle stuff and other things like that because I am kinda fragile, but I'll just leave it at that for now. However, I would love to wait until we are comfortable with each other and click before going there, and I want your consent beforehand.

About you(don't worry, some aren't requirements and my apologies if some aren't worded right or sound offensive):

• Height is either 5'4 to 5'11/6'0+.

• Hairstyle like afro, braids, curly, pixie cut, short hair, coily, bob cut, undercut/sidecut, ect. because I think they look really cool. But other kinds of hair are okay and fine, so no worries.

• Average build, athletic, lean, curvy, chubby, plus-size heavy-set, muscly, or anything as such.

• Tomboyish. Not required.

• Honest. I want to know what is bothering you so I can make you feel better, or if something is wrong and you need my help or support.

• Confident and not afraid to be yourself. As well as not afraid to be goofy and silly.

• Kind and considerate toward others. As well as aware of others' feelings and such.

\[Update: Found 31 inside of a coffee machine. It needed a lot more heat in order to survive, so it fed off of the machine as it heated up the water. Also, I’m very certain that someone consumed it, but due to how weak it is, it was easily digested. Usually consuming it is a death sentence.\]

Notes from R



I heard that a group outside of my range dredged into Nothing, and pulled out one of Sisubi’s Sins, the Bear. Glad I don’t have to delete them myself, but it got me thinking. I gain a lot of power from the unknown, and that beautiful sea I call Nothing is perfect for that. This ritual won’t let me tear into that place, but definitely do something better =)



\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



As all of you are aware, we are running out of materials for our experiments, specifically for the Fabricator. After receiving a vial of V-Red, I tested it on transfur ooze. It instantly started mitosis at an alarming rate. I wondered, since transfurs can replace human limbs, if we found some way to control the process, we could theoretically have as many materials as we need.

I did try to test this theory on an assimilated transfur, but I had to terminate the experiment since the test subject risked breaking containment. I did get a lot of material for rejuvenation.

I have called for this meeting because I know I need permission for what I plan to do next. It requires the use of David’s symbol. I know you are very deterrent from using it, but I feel it is better to think of it as a tool, and not what it is associated with. I think if we learn to harness its conversion properties, we could more effectively control the process for my experiment. It still requires a lot of risk to get right, since most of the assimilated transfurs are very hostile, but, and excuse me if this sounds harsh in any way, we are used to taking the chance, even if it could very well set us back to square one.



That is all. Thank you for your time, and please consider my words.

\[Ok, Maris again.. I found this …… I don’t know how it got here. I don’t know who this Colin is, and I’m too afraid to go asking June or looking through other files. The chip thing sounds similar to what AHInc. did in the past with reviving people with technology.. but that's been scrapped way before I got the job here\]



\[Plus.. the file I got this thing from was called, “Null Connection”. I’m not versed with R’s themes, or abilities, so I cannot tell if this has something to do with other Cycles, or if it’s just a random conversation that somehow got here. Either way, here it is.\]

  


“Alright. Scanning body … oh. He already has a chip installed … That's odd.”



“What’s wrong?”



“His chip doesn’t have any memories stored. No personality saved, it only has his body structure.”



“Does it say anything about where he came from?”



“No. His chip seems extremely outdated. Glad I’m already making a new one. Venessa, do you know why?”



“It's, complicated. The person I used to work for made several clones of him. I guess they just couldn’t preserve his personality.”



“WAIT. They were making clones? That is highly illegal! Who exactly were you working for?”



“I know what we were doing was unethical but ………”



“But what?”



“I, don’t remember why I was working for her. I can’t remember my life before it.”



“Didn’t you say that you came from another world? Even if we could unravel this mystery we can’t easily go to their world.”



“You come from another world? That, actually explains a lot. \[BEEP\] His body is fully scanned now. Let's see … ok now that's weird. There are signs of wolf DNA in him.”



“That must be because of the mask. Whenever he wears it he changes into a wolflike form. I am wearing gloves because I don’t want to lose myself.”



“Did he?”



“No. Quite the opposite actually. I think he uses it as a means of escapism. He always tries to wear it. I don’t know if he likes being it or if the mask is forcing him to do it.”



“His body is malnourished and a chemical is randomly slowing down his ATP production.”



“He has been randomly collapsing without warning. That must be the cause of it.”



“Come to think of it, Cliff used to have something like that. We called it a “Null state” where he would lose energy and move very slowly. They could be connected.”



“Ya but Colin is unable to move when that happens.”



“Could be because Colin is a kid and can’t store the same amount of energy as Cliff can.”

“That was faster than expected.”

1otrfrq,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundandExpose/comments/1otrfrq/aita_for_cheating_with_my_fiancés_best_friend_to/,"AITA for cheating with my fiancé's best friend to prove I ""still had it,"" and now being mad that my sister married him and is having his baby while I'm completely alone?","I destroyed my engagement by flirting with every guy at my own party just to prove I was still attractive, ended up sleeping with my fiance's best friend in his car, and now six years later he's married to my sister and I'm completely alone.

I was 32 when this happened. My fiance proposed after four years together and I should have been thrilled. But all I could think about was how I was getting older. How I was locking myself down. How this was it for the rest of my life.

My mom made it worse. She kept saying things like, ""Well, you better hold onto him because men don't want women over 35."" My younger sister just got engaged around the same time and suddenly everyone was comparing us. She was 28. Still young. Still had options, according to my mom.

So I planned this engagement party and I had this stupid, terrible idea. I was going to prove I still had it. That men still wanted me. That I wasn't desperate or lucky to have my fiance.

The party was at my fiance's parents' house. Big backyard, maybe 60 people. I wore this tight red dress. I spent two hours on my hair and makeup. My fiance said I looked beautiful but I barely heard him.

I started with his cousin. Laughed too loud at his jokes. Touched his arm. He looked confused but played along. Then I moved to our neighbor. Then to guys from my fiance's work. I was working the room like I was single.

My sister pulled me aside near the drinks table. She said, ""What are you doing?""

I said, ""Having fun at my own party.""

She said, ""You're embarrassing yourself. And him.""

I told her to mind her business. She walked away shaking her head.

My fiance's best friend had been watching me all night. He was always kind of flirty anyway. Good looking. Confident. The type who knew women liked him. He came up to me while I was alone by the garage.

He said, ""You trying to make him jealous or something?""

I said, ""I'm just talking to people.""

He said, ""That's not what it looks like.""

And I don't know what came over me but I said, ""Does it bother you?""

He stepped closer. He said, ""Should it?""

We were drunk. Or I was drunk. I don't even remember who kissed who first. But suddenly we were in his car in the driveway with the windows fogged up and I was doing something I can never take back.

It lasted maybe 20 minutes. When it was over I felt sick. He said, ""We should probably get back before anyone notices.""

But someone had noticed. My sister came looking for me. She saw us getting out of his car. She saw me fixing my dress. She knew.

She grabbed my arm and said, ""Are you insane? What did you just do?""

I begged her not to tell anyone. I said it was a mistake. I said I'd break it off with the best friend and never speak to him again. I said my fiance didn't need to know.

She said, ""You're going to marry him and keep this secret?""

I said yes. I said it meant nothing. I said it was just cold feet.

She didn't tell anyone that night. But two days later my fiance called me. He said his best friend confessed everything. Said he felt too guilty to keep it from him.

My fiance said, ""I don't even know who you are.""

I tried to explain about feeling old. About being scared. About my mom's comments. He said none of that mattered. He said I humiliated him at our engagement party. In front of his family.

He said, ""You didn't even come to me. You just went and screwed my best friend.""

The engagement ended. My fiance moved out. Everyone found out what happened. His family hated me. My family was mortified. My mom said I threw away a good man because I was selfish and vain.

But the worst part came later.

About eight months after everything fell apart, my sister told me she ran into the best friend at a coffee shop. They started talking. He apologized for his part in what happened. She said it was nice to see someone take responsibility.

They started dating six months after that.

My sister came to me before it got serious. She said, ""I know this is weird but I really like him. And technically you were never with him. You were engaged to someone else.""

I said, ""Are you serious right now?""

She said, ""It's been over a year. You've moved on.""

But I hadn't moved on. I was still alone. Still dealing with the fallout. And now my sister was dating the guy I cheated with. The guy who ruined my engagement.

I told her she was betraying me. She said I betrayed myself. She said I didn't get to claim him just because we hooked up once when I was engaged to someone else.

My parents stayed out of it. They said it was complicated but my sister had a right to date who she wanted.

They got married last year. I didn't go to the wedding. My whole family went. My mom posted pictures on social media. My sister looked beautiful. He looked happy. Everyone was celebrating while I sat at home.

Now I'm 38. Single. I haven't had a serious relationship since my fiance left. I blamed my sister for years but lately I've been wondering if I'm just mad because she got the happy ending and I didn't.

My mom called me last week. She said my sister is pregnant. She wants to know if I'll come to the baby shower. If I can finally let this go and be part of the family again.

But every time I think about forgiving her, I remember that she's married to him. That she sees him every day. That their whole relationship exists because of the worst mistake I ever made.

Am I wrong for still being angry after all this time?

But what I feel is happening is I am underextracting coffee as due to them not staying afloat there is nothing for me to plunge down, and even if I use Hoffman method it still feels a bit empty like there is something missing.
One more thing that I have observed is if i bump up the ratio to 30g:400ml (vs. current 15g:200ml), basically make 2 cups then the chance for staying them afloat increases its what I have observed.

A lil guidance from y'all would mean a lot. Should I change something, i am already making sure of the basics of brewing like water temp, time reqd for brewing  for diff roasts and all.

1otr7ba,https://i.redd.it/pkm9pzgq3i0g1.jpeg,Heart of Darkness,"By 2234, the Korku era in Ghentish Counties drew to a close with the signing of the Marseille Accord, marking a new chapter of peace and cooperation between the Ghentish people and the French Metropole. During this tense period, the Imperial Group focused sharply on internal stability, working closely with Ghentish MPs and local communities to ensure resources were used wisely and kept out of the hands of troublemakers like the ‘Sons of Gomorrah’. With peace secured and the future bright, the Group was ready to leap beyond the UK and South Arabia into new territories.

One of the most promising lands was the vibrant regions of Central and Northern South America. Stretching from the lush Yucatán Peninsula through the bustling Orinoco Delta to the lively islands of Trinidad and Tobago, these areas offered incredible opportunities all in the unending canopy of the jungles. The Imperial Group's aims were the usual, to uplift local communities, create jobs, and establish itself and help spread its ideals, but this region, could make it become a great global power, transforming from a regional player into a formidable international force, all while testing everything it knew. 

In 2239, the Group negotiated a series of groundbreaking economic treaties across the region. In exchange for everything from infrastructure investments, energy independence, and cutting-edge Ghentish education and defense, the Imperial could extract resources in every area of business all with a fair share of ownership—50% Imperial, 25% state, 25% workers—ensuring profits stayed within local communities. This plan fostered loyalty, education, and prosperity among thousands of people.
By 2242, despite record-breaking coffee, sugar, and cocoa exports from places like Caracol, Yucatán, and Belize—and a substantial decline in organized crime—the Imperial Group’s ambitions soared higher. Thermal energy made homes in the region glow like Paris at night, and people turning away from false gods and embracing Ghent’s ‘Philosophy’ and ideology,  the Imperial’s influence was set to expand, and start forging new allies and foes alike.

In 2243, plans for phase two emerged.  Cuba—though waning but major power— became a crucial partner, for the Groups and the Cuban’s Interests, The Imperial offered upgrades to Cuba’s nuclear capabilities, modern weapons, machinery, and military training in exchange for strategic assets, and a trade partner for its goods as well as a uptick in its standard of living. At the cost of Imperial buying the Nicaragua Canal from Cuba, providing a much-needed cash boost, to both parties and gained a 30% stake in Cuba Petróleo Union, controlling vital oil fields in the Orinoco region of Neoesparta. Combined with natural gas from Central America and dominating shares in Aruboncur Oil and Gas in Lake Maracaibo, the Imperial Sphere of Influence grew rapidly. 

This control over a share oil and gas in the Caribbean Sea led to the creation of Lapis Oil and Gas, which within two weeks of consolidation under its umbrella, became one of the world's largest oil companies outside the Middle East, helping to control 300 billion barrels of oil alone, including natural gas as well. Revenue from this wealth turned Belize into a major oil hub and the building of the San Pedro Terminal—one of the largest natural gas and oil terminals in the Western Hemisphere—slashed energy prices across the region, and made Imperial totally energy independent, set up a sovereign wealth fund under Peridot Banking for the Ghentish Citzens and supplies about a third of all Commonwealth oil and gas needs.

While greatness often brings its own set of hurdles, the story of this region is a testament to resilience brutality and rivalry. As Cuba, the Central American States, and the Imperial Group enjoyed prosperity fueled by cheap energy, robust economies, and soaring a middle classes, nearby powers like Texas and the Holy Tenochtitlán Empire watched their fortunes wane. These mighty entities relying on oil, agriculture, and ranching to build their wealth, yet their dominance was challenged by the Imperial Group’s cutting-edge technology and superior products. All of this unfolded under the banners of the people and socialist ideals.

 My nervous system, anxiety, sleep and looping thoughts have all improved after only a few days. 

 Ive had 6 days off work so coming off caffeine was easier. Whenever I had a craving Ive made myself do something that’ll make me happy instead. This included going for a walk, lifting weights, sorting out things I’ve been putting off. 

 Today was my first day back at work and this was the first time I felt the struggle. By mid afternoon I could’ve killed for my caffeine fix. It has almost become the only thing I look forward to during my work day. 

 Instead of caving and going back to the Monsters and Redbulls, maybe this is a sign to take action and find myself more meaningful work in a job I enjoy 

 Not sure what this post is to tell you, apart from caffeine can keep you in a loop and potentially stop you from growing as a person

I posted this on r/1series but not much luck, so I'm reaching out to a wider audience.

BMW 128i 2008 convertible. I'm trying to figure out what the issue is. I replaced the cabin air filter and cleaned out the AC motor, now I have a whistling noise. I thought the cover might not be sealing correctly to the vent holes, so I resealed them with new silicone foam rubber, didn't work. The noise is only when the circulation flap is open, no problem when the flap is closed for recirculation, so I'm thinking it's something to do with the in pull of air through the filter but I can't for the life of me figure out what to try next.

New filter ✔️
New gasket for filter cover and air duct ✔️
Tried to tape up all potential gaps ✔️
Checked everything is tight and in place ✔️
Tested for noise without the filter ✔️

So it all started this Thursday, in which i felt a non constant,dull pain bellow my left boob, I thought it was a tight push up bra that i have been wearing for a long time everyday and only took off when i arrived home, so I just used it that day then took it off the next one. Anyway, then i started to feel pain in my left arm, it felt like a pulled muscle, then i felt pain in the middle of my chest, not in my breast, but in the middle of both my boobs towards my neck and towards my tummy, then I felt pain in my right boob in the side of it. The pain in the middle of the chest, below my left breast and  the right boob gets worse when I move in a CERTAIN way, but not always when i move normally. It is not constant, sometimes it comes back and then goes away. 

I am 21 years old, a girl, never drank alcohol or smoked. The only different things I did this week is walk for 30 mins to my school and back to my apartment with a 4kg bag with books in my left shoulder. So a 1 hour walk every day while carrying that. I used to take the metro but due to a metro strike, now i have to walk, so i never carried my bag like that for so long, especially not only in my left shoulder. I was also in my period, which is ending today. And last weeek i had caffeine every day from Monday to Friday, dark roast or dark coffee, I never had so many coffee, although it was only one cup a day. 

Of course, im worried about cancer, but i dont know anymore, the pain is sort of all over my chest and sometimes breast and seems to get worse with certain movements, i also have pain in my back and the pain in my left arm is slowly fading.

This will be a 2 part question: 1st, if you purchase the unlimited Starbucks package will that also work at the Starbucks “vending” machine I have seen on some of the YouTube videos I have watched & 2nd, can I use my Starbucks App to purchase drinks if I weren’t to purchase the Starbucks package? I ask that 2nd question simply because I almost always use the app to order & then pay for using an attached gift card that I reload that way I’m always getting double the points which I then will use to get drinks at places where your usual $7.50 drink now cost you $15.50 like at airports however both will cost you *200 points so I tend to save my points until I’m traveling. So being I have already purchased the “drinks” package & would probably only drink 1 Starbucks drink a day I’m thinking if you can use your app on ship to order & pay for drinks it would probably be cheaper for me to just pay as I go, which actually brings me to a 3rd question, if the onboard Starbucks store does except using the app & I were to purchase the package would I be able to scan my app for each order to gain the points?

Here's a lot of background information on me 31M. I'm writing all this so no useless questions get asked like on my previous attempts.

I studied applied physics from 18 to 25. Yes the courseload was so fucking insane I still don't know how I did it. I still get a very bad feeling in my stommack thinking about it. During this shit I stil had a constant 8 hour sleep schedule and worked out twice a day(freestyle wrestling, BJJ and some weights). So there was no time for a girlfriend. Thinking back on it if I gave up sports I probably would finished it in 5 years instead of 7.5. But if i quit athletics I would've quit my schooling aswell. It was the only thing than kept me sane.

I had no friends no social life nothing. Girls we're not remotely interested. I'm not bad looking I've always been in shape. But I was broke as a motherfucker. And in Highschool I needed good grades to enter good schools, luckily college is free. But I was still wrestling and studying combined with shit clothes, so no girls then aswell.

Anyways I graduated at 25. And got a few job offers paying about 80 to almost 125k usd a year. But my brother 31M at the time had graduated in Chemical engineering 4 years earlier. And had a startup with some of his mates all engineers of sorts. They really needed extra help but they didn't have  a budget. I was broke my whole life anyway and said fuck it I'll help. So from 25 to 31 I was basically working for free. I still lived with my mom and dad in the basement with my brother. Looking back on it it was the best time of my life.

I can't say to much on what our company was since you guys might track me down. But essentially we built software that would be able to help you use (certain) energy more efficiently. Any how we eventually got bought out by the goverment for something completely else we had a patent on. Everything else was bought out too because it's interconnected. I won't say how much we got but I'm financially free and independent for the rest of my life. I'm not a centi millionaire remotely but I'm allright. So is my brother. He actually has had the same girlfriend since he was 19. He met her in college. She was actually our main source of income and was the reason me and my brother had money to invest. She worked as a nurse btw.

Anyways he moved out as soon as the first installment from our goverment money. (You don't get it all at once). He married two weeks later and she's now pregnant. No joke she payed for my bjj,wrestling and gym memberahip for six years. I am not lying

I haven't had a job for the past two months. I still live with my parents and I do fuck all. I literally only lift, wrestle and do bjj. Most of my money is invested in stocks and some other stuff and I live of the gaines. I'm also welcome to get a goverment job if I want to (part of the buy-out).

So here's the thing. I lowkey wanna have a roster. I didn't so shit in college except be insanly unhappy because my major was so fucking hard. Highschool was dry because I had to get into uni.

For the past few months I've been training alot and unlike wrestling bjj gyms have females. Like actual real girls. I've never ever thought I'm good looking. Or that I'm a chick magnet. But for some reason I do well with girls when I spit my game.

I'm 6.5 and like 245 so I only ever roll with the dudes. But lately I've been going over to talk to girls and since I've been training since 12. I can actually be usefull at the same time. And my days shit has been going well. Also I have some money so my clothes have been better. I've approached girls in cafés, malls and restaurants. I finally have my first car. Who is pretty nice nothing crazy but it's above average atleast.

I actually get attention from WOMEN. Look I know if I was a nobody I would be less succesfull. But I don't give a fuck. I really want a roster. There's a couple girls 21 year old albanian girl. A 20 year old Swedish girl. A 36 year old girl and 40 year old. And I've been just going crazy tbh. I'm having the time of my fucking life. I never had a single experience with a girl before this. It's been amazing. There all FWB's tho.

But last week I was with my Albanian girl. I took her out to eat bought her some clothes and went out for coffee. When I went home I saw a insta reel about age gaps. And the commenta where very wild and I went here on reddit to see what your outside views on them are?

Within 15 minutes of finishing my food, my stomach started to feel bloated, which isn’t abnormal, so I tried to brush it off and go about my work. But soon after, that discomfort turned into gas pains, cramps, and uncontrollable burping. 

Of course, I started freaking out, which definitely made the physical sensations I was experiencing even more intense. I couldn’t take it anymore, so I made myself go to the bathroom (which is triggering to me in the moment because even if it’s for a different reason, I’m scared to be in the bathroom to “give myself permission” for “it” to happen) and had some very loose d*. My heart rate was in the 140s at this point, I was so anxious. But the pain went away immediately once I went. The bloating remained, though, so I’m pacing around my apartment, trying to talk myself down and tell myself that I’m okay. I’m still so gassy and my diaphragm/stomach feel like they’re burning, which makes me feel like I can’t breathe. It felt like there was a heavy weight pressing on my stomach, which in turn made me fear that I was doomed. 

But guys, I’m so happy to say that I pulled it together after a few minutes. I did some breathing to reset my nervous system (two quick inhales through the nose, one long exhale through the mouth). I put on my comfort show, then went to grab a few ice cubes and forced myself to hold onto them until I couldn’t stand it anymore. That took the edge off of the panic for sure. I’m still feeling some residual anxiety, and I’m shaky and tired as my body comes down from everything, but I got through this without panic-calling anyone or crying or otherwise spiraling out. 

May this be a reminder that gas pains can FEEL like you are seriously ill, but all it is is trapped air, and once it’s released (one way or another), you’ll start to feel better. :) ",1,1762810405.0,emetophobia,3,0.67,False
1otqpqs,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1otqpqs,"Welcome to Adulthood, Bakla. Realizations among other things","**Warning: Hefty post.** 

After years of denial, I have finally accepted it: I am an adult. A full-grown human who pays rent, has back aches, and whose idea of rebellion is drinking Coke Zero at 10 p.m. My childhood friend sealed the deal by inviting me to an Odette Quesada concert. Yes, welcome to your tito era, bakla.

**Friend:** We are watching a concert and you are my plus one!  
**Me:** Nice. Where’s your husband?  
**Friend:** *Nasa kabit niya.* Pick you up in an hour.

At the concert:

**Me:** I didn’t know she wrote those songs!  
**Friend:** *Boba ka kasi.*  
**Me:** Do you smell that?  
**Friend:** Smell what?  
**Me:** *Amoy Katinko.*

I turn around and see a lady massaging her shoulders with mentholated cream, then wrapping herself in a poncho like a menopausal superhero.

**Me:** I told you we’re past our prime. Look around, that’s Annabelle Rama. I bet she has a whole *Katinko gift set* in her bag.  
**Friend:** Would you believe I’m scheduled for a mammogram? My boobs are so flat the machine could make a flying saucer sandwich out of them.

When I got home, I couldn’t help but think of all the adult-life transformations creeping up like cholesterol after Christmas.

**1. Crispy Pata x Coke Zero Combo.** You order crispy pata, pair it with Coke Zero, and chase it with maintenance meds. You chew the skin with guilt but tell yourself, ***“It’s fine. I have losartan.”***

**2. You Eat Halaan Soup Voluntarily.** You now buy fish from the palengke and say things like, ***“Fresh ha, galing pa Navotas.”*** 

**3. Saturday Nights Are for Mahjong, Not Poblacion.** Gone are the neon nights. Now it’s house rotation dinner parties. The host, always the flamboyant gay (hi Allan), is too lazy to cook but will absolutely twerk on a Britney tune.  Hence, Grab deliveries. Boy, 24 Chicken, and Aling Banang pancit are so so good it has become a staple. Then we play mahjong and talk about the imperfections of our friends like we are the most chaste creations of heaven, and deny it the next week when confronted, ***""Hoy hinde ah, hindi ko sinabi yan, ask Mildred""*** also known as Roberto in real life. 

**4. You Go to the Earliest Sunday Mass.** When you age, spirituality arrives like a subscription you can’t cancel. One friend does yoga, eats vegan, and won’t step on ants because ***“it could be my lola reincarnated.”*** Another quotes Bible verses while chismis-ing, ***“Sabi sa Proverbs, don’t hate… but totoo ba yung driver ni Alma ang boyfriend niya ngayon?”*** (play Hillsong music in the background) 

**5. You’re Suddenly Obsessed with Generators.** Nothing says maturity like comparing portable power sources during brownouts.

**6. You Make Baon Like It’s an Olympic Sport.** Rice meal, two sandwiches, and pack a bagful of chichirya, and prays that no coworker dares say, “Pahingi.” Because inflation is real and so is your miserliness.

**7. You Have a Dog and He’s Basically Your Child.** Sorry, cat people. Cats are creatures you serve, but they will never please you unless they want a treat. Dogs, on the other hand, love you and are ever present so much that you can’t have sex or even *touch yourself* in peace because they’ll stare at you like, ***“Father, what are you doing?”***

Adulthood, it turns out, is not about paying bills or building wealth. It’s realizing you have become your parents, only you swear more, drink better coffee, and post your back-pain updates on Instagram Stories. You have traded hangovers for heartburn, hangouts for maintenance meds, and your youthful recklessness for a growing fondness for orthopedic pillows.

Congratulations, bakla. You have finally arrived. Bring your Katinko.",1,1762810403.0,adultingph,1,0.67,False

I've been job hunting for almost a year and finally got hired somewhere (yay!). It's way out of the city however and I would have to take about a $15 uber ride from the closest metro stop. That's $300 for 2 weeks, $150 if I walk back after. Unfortunately rn I can afford that OR I can afford food until the first check. My savings were tapped out over the summer so my money is running on the fumes of selling my belongings. So as of now Im planning on walking both ways; It's an hour each way, it won't kill me, I'm just afraid about timing and showing up late (and sweaty). 

So here's the ask, one stranger to another, anyone commuting to Chantilly? Someone who's willing to have a stranger in their car for about 2 weeks? I obviously can't pay you but I can bring you home brewed Ethiopian coffee in the mornings and I'm equally apt at lively conversation or comfortable silence. I will meet you anywhere in the city and I will be on time. (We would only be a fit if you plan on being in Chantilly by 9-9:15am) Also to be clear I'm not a weirdo, at least not in a bad way (hopefully you aren't either). I can also report I've passed a recent background check and I'm often told I smell amazing. 

Or alternatively I ask (with considerably more shame) if among you internet strangers could I crowdfund uber cash to pay for the rides? 30-60 folks at $5 anyone? Essentially I'm e-begging, I know, but I just really need help and I have no one in my life that can rn.

My dilemma is that I have high-clarity grinders like the ZP6 and SSP multipurpose burrs, but I’m lacking a more blended, less clarity-focused setup for highly processed and Coferment coffee. My current pour-over setup includes:

- Ode 2 with SSP MP
- Timemore 078s, which I use for espresso but can also be used for pour-over
- ZP6
- X Ultra
- H40

I was borrowing my friend's C40, which filled that role, but I had to return it. Now, I’m wondering if I should get a DF 64 again and install the SSP multipurpose burr inside for both espresso and pour-over, then put the Gen 2 stock burr back in the Ode to fill that slot. Or would it make more sense to pick up a used Gen 1 Ode and put the Gen 2 burrs inside it, or would I be better off getting a C40 or waiting until Black Friday to buy a K Ultra?

I fully admit, I may be holding a bit of a grudge here, but I would like to know if I’m being the asshole in this situation or if it’s justified. 

First, some context, and I apologize in advance if this gets a little long. I have been with my partner for almost 4 years now. 2 years into our relationship, his brother - R - got engaged to his (now) SIL - M. It’s worth noting R and M met and started dating exactly 3 months before us. When they got engaged things took a turn. *Everything* was about them. I don’t mean in the normal “oh they’re getting married be excited” sense. I mean at Thanksgiving at their house my partner had disappeared from the kitchen while I was helping R clean up. R asked me where he went and I joked “probably getting yelled at by your mom to be engaged” (my partner is on the spectrum and has a tendency to disconnect from gatherings and sit on his phone.. this is a well known and joked about occurrence). R immediately turned to me and said “she better not be, I’m tell you right now you two aren’t getting engaged until at least 6 months after our wedding”. I was taken aback and said, “what? I mean like not engaging with the family?…” and the other family member (partner’s BIL that had gotten married to his sister earlier that year) jumped in and said “well I mean, you guys didn’t wait 6 months..”. This seemed to piss off R who then muttered something about “respect” and moved on to the next dish. 

We were on an overseas vacation when R & M got engaged, she had informally asked me to be a bridesmaid over text when this happened. Then asked if I could help with the Hotel Block (at the time I was an Admin for my day job and this was a normal thing for me). I said of course I’d help when we got back in 2 weeks. The week we had gotten back I reached out to some places and was waiting on responses… Throughout the 2 weeks we were away they had already booked and signed the contracts for all their vendors for their wedding 14 months from their engagement, except the hotel. So she was asking me daily for updates as I was patiently saying how I was following up and leaving voicemails, I provided the details as I got them. And they wound up booking one of the places I found the following week.. The following 14 months of their engagement were additional hell for me. I still have zero idea why, but M decided she hated me. This extended to her mother hating me as well (the umbilical cord still isn’t cut with that one - only child of divorced mother). So every month I attended the *mandatory* bridesmaids Zoom call with her mother, offering help and volunteering to do things. All while I was purposely left off of emails, sent the options for the dress last, yelled at for getting sick and missing one of the calls, and every interaction being short and hostile. I asked my partners two sisters (also bridesmaids) if I had done something? They said no, but that she had decided I was public enemy no. 1 and they have no clue why. They tried talking to M on more than one occasion with no luck. The Bachelorette weekend was a living nightmare that I may post about another time, but lets just say all in for this wedding of two people that disdain me I spent over $2000 out of pocket. 

Now, two weeks before the wedding R & M come to our place and announce they’re expecting. We tell them how excited we are, etc. The thing that was weird about it was how they did this. They gave us a box containing an item for each of us. My partner, a whiskey drinker like his brother, got a whiskey glass that was themed to his hobbies and mentioned “Uncle”. I, on the other hand, received a pink coffee mug that essentially just said “aunt”. I don’t drink coffee for health reasons and the entire family knows this. Also, literally nothing I own is pink. I’ve been an emo tomboy since I was like 12. I didn’t say anything and just wrote it off, I recently learned that when they went to my partner’s parents house to tell them the news they had the sibling gifts with them. They showed his parents everything they had and his mom asked “wait, what did you get OP?” And M replied “well she’s not really family so nothing.”. Y’all, I was a bridesmaid in their wedding that would be taking place in 2 weeks from this moment. His mom then lost it and said they needed to get me something and thus, pink mug. Throughout their entire pregnancy we offered support. Said if they needed anything to let us know. I went to the baby shower early to help set up and her mother made a whole social media post thanking everyone for the help with the party, specifically naming/tagging partner’s two sisters, mother, and M’s best friend - I was not noted.

Then the baby was born (June 2025), we are told via family group chat of this and had to follow up to ask which day the child was even born as it wasn’t said to us. We get told we can come by the day they’re getting home from the hospital and are given a window of time but told “no more than 2 hours” and that we can’t kiss/touch the baby. Ok, fine. Newborn, I totally get that.. We go over, they tell us the birth story etc. We’re like great, then towards the end we mention that with us closing on our first house in a month we will be hosting Thanksgiving this year. That with the new house we really want to have the whole family over and that we figured it would be easier on them with the newborn to not have to cook (it’s been at R’s house since 2018). They said they were going to have to play it by ear because “we just figured we’d have it here like always”. Well the rest of partner’s family was on board with us hosting so we’ve moved forward with that. 

We got engaged when we moved into our house this past July, SIL didn’t help with move and R came one day to help move a couple small things but that was it. Fine, they had a 1 month old, whatever. But M never reached out asking how the place was or even to congratulate us on the engagement. We announce we’re having an engagement party in October. I sent the date to R and M in a group chat with partner and, tbf, I had essentially said here’s the day but timing is tbd just to give over a month’s notice to not have plans that day. Come a week before the party and his parents had mentioned that we’d see R and M at the party and we were like “idk, they have yet to respond and tell us one way or the other if they’re coming”. His mom yelled at them and they used the excuse of “well we didn’t know when it was”. So she told them and they said they’d be by “after R gets done work” with no indication on when that may be. They came to the party for about 2 hours and left saying they had to get the baby winding down. Fine. Now comes Thanksgiving. We’re ~3 weeks out from it and his parents stop by to drop off some things and hang out for a bit. His parents then informed us that R & M will not be coming to the holiday at our place because they’re going to be spending it with M’s family. The first year they’re not hosting (therefore M’s mother wouldn’t be invited) and suddenly they aren’t going to spend the holiday with partner’s family ( M’s mother was always at R’s house for the holiday in addition to partner’s family). They never even had the curtesy to tell us they weren’t coming so we could plan for headcount. 

While parents were over, Future MIL also asked that we reach out to R & M and ask to see the baby. Saying that they’re claiming “everyone is welcome, no one has reached out”. And when I said that I think it’s rude to invite ourselves over anywhere, let alone to a house with a newborn, his mother agreed and said that’s how it has to be though and to just do it so she can say we tried. 

I don’t want to reach out though. These two are being spoiled brats imo and I’m over it. We have a new house and are planning our wedding, not to mention they have explicitly said to other family members that I’m “not really family” and overall exclude partner and I from everything. We’ve never been sent a photo of the child outside of Snapchat (so there’s no way to save it) and only see photos of him via social media (though this is how they’re treating all of partner’s family, including his parents). I have had a rough life, one that has led me to go no contact with my own family members (my own mother included). I have openly said to future MIL that I will never be the cause for partner to not talk to anyone in his family that he wants a relationship with, I will continue to invite R & M to all family gatherings, but I absolutely will no longer be going out of my way for them. I have been through enough shit to say “nope, my cup doth not overflow and I’m not wasting any of it on people who treat me like shit”. I will not apologize for, what? idk. fucking existing?, nor will I bend over backwards attempting to win over people that have chosen we’re below them. And should the day come when my fiancé says he wants nothing to do with them I absolutely will lose zero sleep over not communicating with them. So no, I don’t want to “just reach out” so that MIL can say we tried. I fucking spent the last two years trying to have some form of relationship for the family’s sake and I’m done.

1otqhqn,https://www.reddit.com/r/INFPIdeas/comments/1otqhqn/how_to_eat_a_lowcarbon_restorative_diet/,"How to Eat a Low-Carbon, Restorative Diet","Shifting what we eat is one of the most powerful and immediate actions we can take to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and restore ecosystems. Our diets are deeply tied to land use, deforestation, soil health, and water systems. By choosing foods that are plant-based, low-carbon, and restoratively grown, we can nourish both ourselves and the planet — helping to rebuild soil, protect biodiversity, and support local farmers using regenerative practices.


What Makes a Diet Restorative? 🌼

~ It emphasizes plant-based foods that require fewer resources to grow and produce.

~ It supports regenerative or organic farms that restore soil carbon and biodiversity.

~ It prioritizes local and seasonal ingredients, reducing transportation emissions.

~ It values zero-waste cooking — using the whole plant or ingredient whenever possible.


Low-Carbon, Restoratively Grown Food Ideas by Category:

Vegetables 🌼

~ Regeneratively grown root vegetables (carrots, beets, radishes) that enrich soil when rotated with legumes.

~ Leafy greens like kale, chard, or spinach from organic no-till farms.

~ Seasonal produce sourced from community-supported agriculture (CSA) or local regenerative farms.


Grains & Legumes 🌼

~ Lentils and chickpeas — among the lowest-carbon protein sources, also nitrogen-fixers that heal the soil.

~ Oats, quinoa, and millet — resilient, water-efficient grains.

~ Whole grain sourdough bread made with heritage wheat from local, regenerative growers.


Fruits 🌼

~ Seasonal, local fruit (berries, apples, citrus) grown without synthetic pesticides.

~ Tree crops like apples, pears, and persimmons that store carbon in long-lived roots and trunks.

~ Food forest fruits — from community gardens integrating edible trees and shrubs.


Nuts & Seeds 🌼

~ Almonds, walnuts, or hazelnuts from dry-farmed or regenerative orchards.

~ Sunflower, pumpkin, or flax seeds — nutrient-rich, low-impact, and biodiversity-friendly.

~ Locally grown hemp seeds — a strong source of omega-3s with minimal soil disruption.


Plant Proteins 🌼

~ Tempeh and tofu made from organic or regenerative soybeans.

~ Pea-based protein from farms practicing crop rotation and minimal tillage.

~ Mushroom protein from waste-fed or circular farms using local wood chips or compost.


Oils & Fats 🌼 

~ Cold-pressed olive oil or camelina oil from sustainable groves.

~ Sunflower or flaxseed oil from regional regenerative growers.


Drinks 🌼 

~ Organic teas and fair-trade coffee from shade-grown, biodiversity-rich plantations.

~ Local herbal infusions (mint, chamomile, nettle).

~ Plant-based milks from local oats, peas, or almonds grown with minimal irrigation.


Additional Tips for a Restorative Kitchen:

~ Compost food scraps and support local compost collection or soil restoration projects.

~ Choose bulk-buying and refill stores to reduce packaging waste.

~ Use ugly produce and cook root-to-leaf to minimize food waste.

~ Support local regenerative farmers by visiting farmers markets or buying through CSAs.

~ Grow herbs, sprouts, or microgreens at home — every bit of homegrown food lowers your footprint.


The beauty of a low-carbon, restorative diet is that it’s not just about subtraction — it’s about abundance: abundant nutrients, biodiversity, and life returning to the soil. Eating restoratively reconnects us with the natural cycles that sustain us.

## Finding Your Foundation: Cabinet, Cart, or Station?

First things first, you need to decide on the home for your bar. Each option has its own unique advantages.

### The Classic Bar Cabinet

This is the traditional choice. A bar cabinet is a freestanding piece of furniture, often with doors to hide your collection when not in use.

*   **Best for:** Maximum storage, a clean and seamless look, and serious collectors.
*   **Pros:** Holds a ton of stuff, keeps bottles out of direct light, looks elegant and permanent.
*   **Cons:** It's stationary. You can't move it around for a party.

### The Versatile Bar Cart

The bar cart is the stylish, mobile option. It’s perfect for smaller spaces or for anyone who loves flexibility.

*   **Best for:** Small apartments, flexible hosting, and making a style statement.
*   **Pros:** You can wheel it wherever the party is. It's a fantastic way to add a bit of metallic or modern flair to a room.
*   **Cons:** Limited storage space. Everything is out in the open, so styling is key.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=beverage%20bar%20cabinet)

### The Built-In Beverage Station

This is the dream setup. If you're renovating or have an unused nook, building a dedicated station is the ultimate upgrade.

*   **Best for:** The dedicated entertainer who wants a fully integrated solution.
*   **Pros:** Can include a small sink, mini-fridge, and custom cabinetry. It adds serious value to your home.
*   **Cons:** Requires a bigger investment and construction.

This is where you can really level up your game. Beyond the basics like a shaker and jigger, there's one tool that completely changed hosting for me.

> Here's a little secret: get an **electric bottle opener**. Seriously. I used to struggle with corks, especially after a long day or when I had guests waiting. This little gadget is a game-changer. It opens any bottle in seconds with zero effort. It's one of those things I wish I’d found years ago—it makes you feel like a perfectly polished host, every single time.

Other must-haves:

-   **Cocktail Shaker**
-   **Jigger** (for measuring)
-   **Hawthorne Strainer**
-   **Bar Spoon**
-   **Citrus Juicer**

### The Glassware Collection

You don't need a massive collection, but having the right glass for the right drink makes a huge difference.

-   **Rocks glasses** (for whiskey and drinks on the rocks)
-   **Highball glasses** (for tall drinks like gin and tonic)
-   **Coupe or martini glasses** (for ""up"" cocktails)
-   **Wine glasses** (if you serve wine)

### The Finishing Touches

These small details are what take your setup from good to great.

-   **Garnishes:** A small bowl for olives or maraschino cherries. A place to keep fresh citrus.
-   **Condiments:** A small ramekin for bitters.
-   **Ice Bucket & Tongs:** An absolute essential. No one wants to trek to the freezer.

## Beyond Booze: The Coffee & Tea Bar

Your **beverage bar cabinet** isn't just for cocktails. It can be an incredible coffee or tea station, too!

-   Dedicate a shelf to your favorite coffee beans or teas.
-   Keep an electric kettle, a French press, or a pour-over setup on the counter.
-   Arrange your favorite mugs on a small stand.
-   Add a little tray with sugar, stirrers, and a small pitcher for milk.

It creates a cozy morning ritual and gives you another reason to love this special corner of your home.

---

A well-thought-out **beverage bar cabinet** is more than just a place to store drinks. It’s a hub of your social life, a spot for daily rituals, and a personal statement. Start with the foundation, build your collection slowly, and most importantly, have fun with it. Cheers to that",1,1762809724.0,BestWineCabinets,0,1.0,False

The capital is barely built. It was half offices, half wilderness. Inside, under the light of a single bulb, Premier George Cadle Price sits across from Philip Goldson, his long-time rival, a cup of cold coffee between them. Papers, about trade figures, food import data, and a clipping from the Belize Times lie scattered on the table.*

**Goldson:**  
You’ve seen the figures, George. Sugar exports have fallen again, mahogany’s dying out, and the British Treasury’s cutting the subvention by another quarter. We’re running a government on hope and borrowed pounds.

**Price:**  
I’ve seen them, Philip. Every decimal, every pound. I also see the people behind those numbers, the dockworkers in Belize City, the farmers in Orange Walk. They still believe in this country.

**Goldson:**  
They believe because you’ve taught them to dream. But dreams don’t feed children. You’ve been promising independence for ten years now, and all we’ve had is more rationing and less patience.

**Price:**  
You’d have us give up our soul because times are hard?

**Goldson:**  
Look north, George. Look at the United States under Moynihan. They’re investing in the Caribbean, sending aid, opening trade programs. They have the capital we don’t. You think it’s betrayal to ask whether Belize might be better off under the Stars and Stripes?

**Price:**  
(leans back, quietly)  
You would subject us to colonialism for dependency, Philip?

**Goldson:**  
If it means roads that don’t wash away, if it means schools that don’t leak. Independence won’t save us from poverty, not when we’ve no industry, no army, no leverage.

**Price:**  
We are a people, Philip. That is our leverage. People with dignity, with history.

**Goldson:**  
Dignity won’t stop the Guatemalans from claiming half our land. You think London will defend us forever? They can barely defend their own economy. Washington can. Washington would.

**Price:**  
And when Washington grows tired of us? When they decide we’re too poor, too small, too troublesome? What then?

**Goldson:**  
Then we’ll still have roads, hospitals, and electricity. Things our children can build upon. George, the Unionists aren’t dreamers, they’re realists. They see what’s coming. The British are leaving, the economy’s collapsing, and independence will only make us poorer. Joining the United States could give us a chance to live decently.

**Price:**  
(slowly, almost sadly)  
A decent life without freedom is only a comfortable prison.

**Goldson:**  
Better a prison with food than freedom on an empty stomach.

**Price:**  
I built a nation in my heart, Philip. Not a province. Not a star on someone else’s flag.

**Goldson:**  
And I’m trying to make sure that the nation survives long enough to be real.

*(They sit in silence again. Outside, thunder rolls over the jungle. The lights flicker. Price closes his eyes for a moment, weariness showing through the pride.)*

**Price:**  
Perhaps the Americans will come offering friendship, as they always do. But if we forget who we are before they even arrive, then we were never a nation at all.

Maybe. Or maybe we’d finally have the chance to become one, under a flag that can afford to keep its promises.

I’ve been wondering: for those of you who participate in book clubs, have you noticed any impact on your own writing?

For me, discussing books with others sometimes sparks new ideas or helps me see different narrative techniques, but I’m curious if others experience the same.

Do you find that reading and discussing regularly in a group setting improves your storytelling, style, or discipline? Or is it just a fun social activity for you?

Here some notes that I jotted down during my book club meetings:

Vyvanse seems to be an amazing drug but I immediately hear the worst most intrusive voices and reality shifting , changing colors etc is so awful I'd kill myself on a high dose I know it. 

Video games are helpful for me. Buproprion at a very high dose helps. It and coffee (8 cups a day) along with Keto gives me enough mental energy to not just focus but remain somewhat creative even if it's just a game. Having ideas and implementing them and enjoying it sort of, a little bit. 

I do everything I can to keep learning and chasing wisdom or new ideas and at the end of every day as I walk through a crowd of people I realise how absolutely alone I am , always will be and have been. 

The world to me means nothing. It's always been impossible to attach to it. Success means nothing. I exist and live moment to moment and have to constantly police my own very violent impulses

. I'm incapable of sex because the rage cripples me and I'm not sadistic, I just don't want to hurt people. I'm forced to sobriety because any drinking would have me seriously hurting someone else or myself.

 My body is just a prison which I've managed to actually learn to control quite well over the last 20 years of various athletics and disciplines but it means nothing. It's like a red hum. 

The only emotions I feel are disgust, rage and fear or intense anxiety so bad it makes me gag. 

I remember being younger and wanting to share time with people especially prospective romantic partners. I had a lot of friends before and early in to puberty but as my libido returned from dormancy my thoughts and fantasies were so extremely violent and mostly self destructive. I sexually fantasized about being ripped up by violent dogs, burned alive and having my genitals mutilated.

 I'd jerk off to videos of South East Asian women stomping puppies or kittens to death. It was and remains how I think of life. It's all cruelty. 

Relief isn't possible. There's no such thing. I gave up on cumming half a decade ago because my mind would fall in to a deep flat depression and within a week or two the exact same thing would grow back.

 The endorphins didn't provide relief they just dulled sensitivity and excitement which is the only relief I have in life. The only thing that gives a passing sense of meaning to each meaningless moment. A sip of coffee, rage moving through my body and just this prison feeling that I can't ever escape.

1otqb6u,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spiderman/comments/1otqb6u/spiderman_prime/,Spider-Man Prime,"In the night of New York City, a group of elite mercenaries breaks into a secure building, stealing a drive containing the information their boss needed. Their leader, Beetle, steps forward, saying the mission is complete.

That’s when a voice echoes from above.

Spider-Man (off-screen):
“You know, if you guys wanted a souvenir, the gift shop’s downstairs on the left. Although I don’t think they allow bad guy discounts.”

Spider-Man drops down, landing in front of them. In an instant, webs fly — their weapons are ripped away, and he takes them down one by one. He’s surprised to see Beetle after all this time, though not shocked — Beetle’s a hired gun, after all.

Beetle raises his arm and fires his blasters, but Spider-Man easily dodges. Beetle then activates his plasma blades, hoping to cut down the wall-crawler.

Spider-Man:
“Usually reunions start with hugs, handshakes… and hey, a gift wouldn’t kill. Or does trying to kill me mean you’re happy to see me?”

Beetle:
“You were very irritating the last time we saw each other.”

Spider-Man:
“Ah, so you do remember! Glad you really thought this through. But hey — I’m more charming now.”

Beetle lunges forward for a strike, but Spider-Man moves out of the way and counters with an uppercut, then kicks Beetle back into a wall. Beetle throws down an energy grenade to distract him, and the explosion nearly buries Spider-Man in rubble. He manages to break free just in time to see Beetle trying to escape.

Spider-Man:
“Leaving so soon? We were just having a good chat. How about we talk about that drive you stole — maybe get a coffee afterwards?”

Beetle:
“I think you should worry about my men you knocked down. You see, I placed bombs on their suits. All I have to do is activate them and… well, use your imagination. So, you can either save them… or stop me.”

Spider-Man:
“You’re bluffing.”

Beetle:
“Try me, hero.”

Spider-Man hesitates. He can’t stop Beetle without risking the lives of the mercenaries. Sure, they’re criminals, but he’s not a killer. Then Beetle activates the bombs — they’re on a timer.

Spider-Man rushes to deactivate them, moving as fast as he can while Beetle flies away. He works frantically, realizing he won’t be able to stop them all. With seconds left, he grabs the remaining suits and throws them as far as he can before the bombs explode. The blast knocks him back hard.

Spider-Man slowly gets up, dusting himself off.

Spider-Man (sighs):
“Definitely need a vacation. Hoping these guys try not to kill me for a while.”


CUT TO:
Beetle enters a warehouse, waiting for his client. A man steps out of the shadows — Richard Fisk, better known as The Rose.

Rose:
“I see you were able to get the drive. I’m impressed, Beetle. Your reputation was indeed true.”

Beetle:
“I’ll admit we had some issues. Spider-Man almost interfered with the heist.”

Rose:
“A minor problem. Soon, my plan will come to motion. The information from this drive will help us make this city suffer — along with Spider-Man.”

Beetle:
“Many have tried to put fear into this city, Mr. Fisk… including your father.”

Rose:
“My father was a fool. A man who thought his vision would come true — the ‘Kingpin of Crime,’ now sitting in a cell. Pathetic.”

Beetle:
“So what exactly are you planning, if I may ask?”

Rose:
“Let me ask you this. Why do criminals use fear to control others? Because they think fear gives them power. Tombstone, Silvermane, Kingpin — all used the illusion of fear. But Spider-Man proved that illusion can be broken. I’m going to unleash the true meaning of fear.”

Beetle:
“I’m listening.”

Rose just smiles beneath his mask.

The next day, Peter heads to work, still wondering why Beetle was after that drive. He hasn’t seen him in years, so whatever was on that drive must be important. Beetle’s obviously working for someone, and Peter’s determined to find out who.

He approaches the Oscorp building and walks inside.

Harry:
“Pete! Always on time. Guess the old Parker luck’s lost its touch.”

Peter:
“I’m just that good, Harry. This isn’t high school or college anymore. Oh, and nice mustache — trying to get the ladies’ attention?”

Harry (laughing):
“Very funny, smart guy. The ladies love it — don’t be jealous.”

Peter:
“Oh, I’m definitely jealous. I remember that one person you dated — what was his name again?”

Harry:
“Always with the comebacks, huh? Keep that up and I’ll have to fire you.”

Peter (laughing):
“Sure, get rid of your best scientist and best friend. See how well that goes.”

Harry:
“Fair point. Still, those results you gave me last week — amazing work.”

Peter:
“Wait, really? Already? I wasn’t sure the cells would hold after the first round of tests.”

Harry:
“They did. We might actually be able to cure certain diseases with this serum. We’ll be heroes.”

Peter:
“That’s incredible. I’ll go over the data again, just to be safe.”

Harry:
“Good idea. I’ve gotta head over to the main Oscorp facility to make sure things are running smoothly. Not easy being CEO, but ever since I lost Dad, I’ve felt like it’s what he would’ve wanted.”

Peter:
“Yeah, well… at least you’re doing your best.”

Harry:
“I’ll be back later. Don’t forget to lock up when you’re done — can’t have anyone stealing our ideas.”

Peter:
“I think we’ll be fine. See you later, Harry — have fun.”

Later that day, Peter goes over his work while still thinking about Beetle and that stolen drive. There’s only one way to find out what’s really going on.

That night, Spider-Man swings back to the building Beetle hit. He slips inside, avoiding the guards, and checks the offices. Inside, he finds files that track various villains and criminals — their backgrounds, status, and locations. Most of them are either retired or in prison.

So, the real question is: who is Beetle’s client looking for?

Meanwhile, in an asylum, Rose stands in front of a reinforced glass cell, speaking to someone inside.

Rose:
“What a lovely place you’ve got yourself into. Could be cleaner.”

Man’s Voice (chuckling):
“So what does Kingpin Junior want with me? As you can see, I’m enjoying myself here.”

Rose:
“I offer you not only freedom… but a chance for this city to truly understand what fear is. I believe you’re the one who can make that happen.”

The man laughs — cold and wild.

Man:
“Oh, trust me. I do more than just put fear into people. I live for it. Making others feel pain — that’s what brings me joy. Nobody knows that better than me.”

Rose:
“I have a plan — one that will benefit you the most, if you’re willing to take it. Many would kill for such an opportunity.”

Man:
“What about Spider-Man? Can’t have a party without that clown ruining everything.”

Rose:
“Spider-Man will fail. And when he does… this city will never forget it.”

The man smiles — Cletus Kasady.

He leans forward, eyes gleaming with madness.

Cletus:
“Well now… seems there’s gonna be plenty of carnage.”

It's in a really large strip mall that has, in the many years I live near here, become an international food marketplace.

I'm sitting near a big refrigerated case with soft drinks and beer options.

The people at the next table ordered.  One of them gets up and leaves.   Five minutes later, as their food arrives, the person who left returns.  She's carrying two Asian bottled soft drinks - the same item I see in the case near me.  Apparently, she went to the Asian grocery next door and bought them there to save a buck or two.  

And, while it should be none of my business, it irritated me.  

I have no issue with wine & corkage.  I know people often walk in with their water bottle.  I even sorta get people bringing in coffee, as strength and options vary widely, - although my friends tell me its kinda disrespectful to bring your own coffee into a breakfast place...  so I wouldn't do that either.

1otq9q8,https://www.reddit.com/r/musicals/comments/1otq9q8/thoughts_on_groundhog_day/,Thoughts on Groundhog Day,"Watched a review from the more recent UK show and one misconception (as I perceive it) really bugged me.   He was harping on Playing Nancy, and how it's pointless as she just ends up with another guy anyway and not important to the story.

  
In aggregate, I think you need to really understand One Day in order to fully get the musical message.  It's subtle, and apparently could have used a more explicit statement in the book, but here goes.

  
On its face it starts with Rita singing about one day finding her prince.  But there's a lot more than that going on.  She actually sings about a really pretty and smart girl that marries rich and still ends up with a pool filled with regrets.   And that's why Rita won't fall for all of that romantic bullshit, even though it's clear she wants it... it can't possibly work out and so she's closed herself off to it.

By the end of the song, we have the town all singing about things they'll do One Day.  How tomorrow they'll improve their lives, not today.

Jeff: I'll cut down on fried chicken takeaway

Gus: I'll stop drinking so much

Sherrif: I'll get a new safety clip for my holster

B&B: I'll get a new coffee maker

Buster: I will buy her a ring

**Nancy: I'll stop dating guys who are 20 years older**



All of these characters, like Phil, are **ALSO STUCK**.  They're not in a time loop (well, they are.. but they've been stuck longer than that!), but remain in a state they know isn't good of their own volition and refusal to move on and make their lives better while they still can... before Night Will Come.

  
So when Nancy is singing Playing Nancy, she's confirming that she's stuck, pigeonholed in the role that people see for her, and she'd rather be that than risk being ignored.   As a result, she gravitates to the guys who will give her attention and are after her body, rather than someone nice that just sees her for herself... it's what she really wants but can't bring herself to try it.  Maybe one day.

  
Phil's salvation comes not only when he starts caring about other people, but he shows it by also helping them all get unstuck from their own problems so that their one day (as far as Phil is concerned) can be a great and fulfilling day for them where they realize their dream and fulfill their ""I want.""

Phil buys a coffee maker, etc, etc to help improve their lives in ways they can't bring themselves to do on their own.

The entire town becomes unstuck together in more ways than one.



So, I guess I'm saying that I see the overarching message is doing what you can to make EVERY day the best it can be.  Don't wait until tomorrow as you don't know if tomorrow will ever come.

It’s a task filled with joy, but let's be honest—it can also be a source of serious stress.

Do you go practical? Or sentimental? What do you get for the person who insists they ""need nothing""?

Forget the generic scented candle and the last-minute gas station gift card. This year, we're elevating your holiday shopping game. This guide isn’t just a list of products; it’s a new framework for thinking about gift-giving, ensuring your presents are thoughtful, memorable, and genuinely appreciated.

## A New Approach to Gift-Giving: Think Like a Gift Detective

The best gifts aren't the most expensive; they're the most personal. To find them, you need to channel your inner detective. Start by observing and listening.

### Step 1: Listen for Clues All Year Long

The best ideas are often hiding in plain sight. Pay attention to casual conversations throughout the year. Is your dad constantly complaining about his old, slow tablet? Does your best friend mention a hobby they’ve always wanted to try, like pottery or gardening?

*   **The Complaint:** ""My headphones always die during my run.""
    *   **The Gift:** A pair of long-lasting wireless earbuds.
*   **The Casual Wish:** ""I'd love to learn how to make fresh pasta.""
    *   **The Gift:** A pasta-making machine and an Italian cookbook.

### Step 2: Identify Their ""Love Language""

Understanding how a person prefers to receive love can be a game-changer for your holiday gifts. Based on Dr. Gary Chapman's ""The 5 Love Languages,"" here’s how you can translate them into perfect presents:

*   **Words of Affirmation:** A custom-made piece of jewelry with an engraved message or a beautifully framed photo of a special memory.
*   **Acts of Service:** For the person who's always doing for others, give them the gift of relaxation. A professional house cleaning service or a coupon book of ""favors"" from you can be priceless.
*   **Receiving Gifts:** This person values the thought and effort behind the present. Focus on something that feels like it was made just for them—a monogrammed item, a rare edition of their favorite book, or a subscription box tailored to their niche interests.
*   **Quality Time:** The gift here is an experience. Plan a weekend trip, buy tickets to a concert or play, or schedule a special one-on-one outing, like a cooking class or a hike.
*   **Physical Touch:** Think comfort and luxury. A high-quality weighted blanket, a plush robe, a professional massage, or a luxurious cashmere sweater.

## Curated Gift Ideas for Every Personality & Budget

Once you’ve done your detective work, you can start zeroing in on specific ideas. Here are some categories to spark your inspiration.

#### **For the Tech Enthusiast**
Skip the generic gadget and go for something that enhances their daily life.
*   **Budget-Friendly:** A high-capacity, fast-charging portable power bank.
*   **Mid-Range:** A smart mug that keeps their coffee or tea at the perfect temperature.
*   **Big Ticket:** A smart home device that simplifies their routine, like a high-tech display or a home security system.

#### **For the Homebody (Who Has Everything)**
This person values comfort and cozy moments. Think upgrades to their sanctuary.
*   **Luxury:** A premium weighted blanket for the ultimate relaxation experience.
*   **Consumable:** A subscription to a gourmet coffee or artisanal tea service.
*   **Experiential:** A MasterClass subscription so they can learn a new skill from the comfort of their couch.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=holiday%20gifts)

#### **For the Hard-to-Shop-For ""Experience Seeker""**
For many, memories are the best gifts.
*   **Adventure:** A gift certificate for a hot air balloon ride, a rock-climbing class, or a zip-lining tour.
*   **Culture:** Tickets to the museum exhibit they've been talking about, a play, or a symphony performance.
*   **Relaxation:** A gift certificate for a spa day, complete with a massage and facial.

#### **For the Eco-Conscious Friend**
Show you care about them and the planet.
*   **Practical:** A set of stylish, reusable produce bags or a high-quality water bottle they can take everywhere.
*   **Impactful:** A donation in their name to an environmental charity they support.
*   **Stylish:** A piece of clothing or accessory from a sustainable, ethically-made brand.

## The Art of the Last-Minute Gift (Without Looking Like It)

Life gets busy. If you're down to the wire, don't panic. You can still give an incredible gift.

*   **Digital Delights:** An e-book from their favorite author, an audiobook subscription (like Audible), or a streaming service gift card for a platform they don't have.
*   **The Local Gift Card (Upgraded):** Don't just grab a generic card. Get one from their favorite *local* coffee shop, bookstore, or restaurant. It shows you pay attention to their favorite spots.
*   **A Curated Basket:** Dash to a few stores (a bottle of wine, a nice cheese, some gourmet crackers, a small candle) and assemble a beautiful, high-quality ""Date Night In"" or ""Cozy Night"" basket. It feels thoughtful and personal, even if you just put it together.

## Presentation Matters: The Finishing Touches

Never underestimate the power of presentation. A thoughtful gift wrapped beautifully shows you care.
*   **Wrapping:** Use unique wrapping paper, reusable fabric wraps (Furoshiki), or even brown paper tied with twine and a sprig of greenery for a rustic, elegant look.
*   **The Card:** This is non-negotiable. Always include a handwritten note. Mention a specific memory or tell them why you chose that specific gift for them. This is often the most cherished part of the present.

Happy gifting! The perfect holiday gift is out there—you just have to approach it with a little thought and observation.

1otq6st,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1otq6st/how_do_i_tell_my_biological_father_and_his_wife/,How do I tell my biological father and his wife that they are gross?,"I’m 25F and only see my biological father and his wife about once a year because we live far apart. He usually insists I stay with them so he can show off his apartment and his “household skills.” The last three visits were really difficult for me because of their hygiene (and their dog).

I had hoped things would improve now that he’s remarried, but they haven’t. They even smoke indoors now, which is especially hard for me.
On the last visit the smoke was so bad I woke up at night with a nosebleed. I’m very sensitive to smoke. I mean the smell was everywhere: sheets, clothes, furniture, wall, etc.

There are other things that bother me:

- The coffee machine is filthy. There were ground-up bugs and dog hair in the cup… and they still served it to me and my partner without hesitation.

- They let their dog lick their face and hands, then touch food. I’ve watched them clean the dog’s eyes with their fingers and then continue preparing shared meals without washing. They make dumplings and bread with bare, dirty hands and long, dirty nails.

- After we eat, they let the dog lick the plates. I told them this makes me uncomfortable and is unhygienic, but they keep doing it.

- Dog hair is everywhere, even in the fridge.

- The shower and toilet (particularly the floor) are unclean and tbh, I don’t wanna take a shower in a bathroom where pigs like them are also showering. (or not showering, they shower MAYBE every 3 days and the toothbrush is just decorating the bathroom)

There are more things, but the main point is: I don’t want to eat or sleep at their place anymore.
What’s especially frustrating is that when I tell him something bothers me, he usually does it on purpose and call it “humor.” Like the dog licking from our plates - he lets the dog lick the plate in front of me because he knows I don’t like it.
I’m really angry about his behavior, actually pissed. He brags about his cooking and household as if everything is perfect - which makes me want to break something. 
Maybe part of my reaction is that he was never a good father to me and he’s also having this praising behaviour when it comes to his parenting. He was never there but praising himself above the clouds.

I want to set boundaries and tell him that this environment is not acceptable to me and I rather sleep and eat elsewhere but I don’t know how to say this nicely anymore. How would you approach it?

I’m thinking about breaking contact but I’ve just been at their wedding which would also be an asshole move.
Next visit will be next year probably so I still have some time.

If you read all of that, thank you :)



TL;DR: My father and his wife are not hygienic and idk how to tell them I don’t wanna stay with them anymore during my visits.",1,1762809189.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

This post is just my experience with the kz zenith/kz-an01 and the little quirks that come with it.

Equipment/gear I used to test the zenith.

Samsung galaxy a55.

I'm familiar with premium tws like the airpods pro, the Samsung galaxy buds pro, and the Samsung galaxy buds pro 2, and there great.

But the unboxing experience is meh, you buy them for the tws not the presentation/unboxing. However, when I received the zenith, the unboxing experience brought me back to the days when samsung and apple gave you everything you need in one package.

The presentation, at least for me will always be memorable, cause this is the first time the presentation of a pair of iems, or airpods/tws for that matter was so premium.

From the foam inserts for the iems, both regular and foam eartips, a leather well ""faux"" leather carrying case for the iems, the presentation is sublime.

Besides the cable, every review I've seen for the zenith always points out the cable as a negative. I guess it's cause the only other time that this packaging/presentation was used, was on the Kz sonata, that came with a premium cable.

They are the most premium feeling earbuds/iems I own, period.

They feel and look, more expensive than they are. I can hardly believe there only $60 msrp. If you told me there $250 or $350 I'd believe you from feel alone. All metal casing, a unique design, and the weightiness feels, chefs kiss.

If you're familiar with kz packaging then there's nothing new here, just the kz-an01 themselves, and quick start guide/manual not even a short type c cable. Sad.

It's ok, All plastic, not the most pocket friendly case but manageable, don't know if this applies to this unit but in this teardown video [https://youtu.be/bRRcTWF8VtY?si=zfoItolMxwsTHVLA](https://youtu.be/bRRcTWF8VtY?si=zfoItolMxwsTHVLA) timestamp 0:59 to 1:09 there's a weight in the case to make it heavier than it is, my guess? so it won't be feather light like something from Ali express.









°battery life. Kz-an01.

WHEW BOI let me tell you, this is where it gets a little controversial, cause while I was researching for iem Bluetooth modules, I came across this and straight up, the main thing that made me buy them is the anc, will get to that in a bit.

Saw that the advertised battery life is ""40 hours"" 8 hours with the earpieces which is 100% confirmed after numerous tests. and 32 with the case, 40 in total. And theoretically able to charge a total number of 5 times. Which is a FUCKING lie, I am only able to get 1 full charge and a half, technically 2 but eh potato potato.

Keep in mind I completely drain the battery of the earpieces 100% - 0.

I can only get 60% battery on the second charge, the case Isn't dead, still glows yellow yet it won't charge. Fyi, green means 70 - 100%, yellow 30 - 70%, red 0 - 30% taken straight from the manual.

Now, you might be thinking, that you might have a defective unit. I thought so too, Cause there's no documentation or reports of such a thing.

So I tried anyway to see if there is any info on the subject. And a unlikely source pops up my own post about it.

Now I know my sample size of people is only one, and a reddit comment at that. Which is the equivalent of saying my source, trust me bro.

However other than buying multiple units there's not much I can do. However I trust what the guy says cause, what could he gain from lying? To quote the reddit user.

https://preview.redd.it/2hmrhdp8qh0g1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=49ef0319e1c22702c1b2d9043d0236ea3ef40c23



I don't know about other kz an01 users but i asked the e-commerce i bought it from. They tested it with 3 kz an01 and the result the same (2 number of times).

So claims in the ads or website are false and the e-commerce where i bought it, description of the kz an01 has heen changed.

So besides the false claims of 40 hours of battery (which I'm still salty about like why not just say 2 charges rather than lie BS)

Now we get to the real juicy information that I guarantee, no other reviewer has documented as accurately or in depth as this post. Let me tell you the amount of hours this took to be sure it's 98% accurate with as little human error as possible.

May I present the battery life. From the time it says battery low, to the amount of times it says battery low, till it powers off. Disclaimer. Volume at 50% no anc/transparency/low latency mode used.

°Anc/low latency/transparency. Kz-an01.

Another thing that a lot of people want to know considering these are to my knowledge, THE first Bluetooth modules with anc, is the anc any good?

To quote the realist tech reviewer Flossy Carter. [https://youtu.be/rWzwTpEOdqc?si=e9pDFxi8uWRFvfA9](https://youtu.be/rWzwTpEOdqc?si=e9pDFxi8uWRFvfA9) timestamps 30:04 to 30:10 Here's my ranking, ok we got, trash tier, ok tier, and top tier.

Out of the box, it's trash tier. It does block out the hum of the A/C, muffles some noise but that's it. With the eartips I'm using, and anc combined. There imo, in between trash and ok tier.

Now to people who are used to anc on tws might think that, it didn't improve much. However, considering this is there first time implementing anc, I'm quite satisfied with the results. From personal experiences in busy coffee shops like Starbucks, with anc on while playing anything at 50% volume all background noise just fades into the, well, background.

Low latency is pretty straightforward to test, is it viable for fps games like csgo? Yeeeees? It's serviceable like desert island scenario if you don't have any other option there fine. However if you're a competitive fps player then objectively no. There is a slight delay between sound reaching you, not like a millisecond or 2 of delay but you will notice it isn't as responsive as a wired headset.

Like yeah no shit genius, but if you're playing anything else besides fps, is it viable? surprisingly yes. Since I don't play fps games period, this has been how Ive been gaming if I don't use a wired headset.





°Little quirks/unexpected issues. Kz zenith.

Being a all metal iem gives it a shiny mirror like finish like the ipod classic. As such it is a fingerprint magnet, nothing a microfiber cloth can't fix, however. As time goes on, it will inevitably pick up micro scratches. However due to how the faceplates designed, it won't be a issue.

Another issue I came across a month into using it, one night while I was chilling, listening to music, the right iem started to become softer, and over the course of a minute in real time became completely muffled.

Now being just a month old I wondered WTF just happened? So I inspected the mesh filter and it was completely ear wax and debris free, considering I keep my ears clean I would hope so. Still muffled, I checked the pins if there was any oxidation or dust or obstruction in the iem, there was none. Checked the pins of the Kz-an01 also none, and it was still muffled.

at this point I was freaking out, Idk what could be the problem. Then after 15 minutes of troubleshooting I swapped to the kz zsn pro 2 to see if it was the iem or the Bluetooth module, the zsn pro 2 worked fine so it was the zenith and not the kz-an01.

Then all of a sudden when I swapped it back to the zenith it starts working again like nothing ever happened, so I thought must be a connection issue or it just freaked out. Then continued on with no other issues after that.

Then it happened again 2 days later, so I went to do some research as to why this kept happening, and after a few minutes of searching I found this   [https://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/s/Je5jVCUAYE](https://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/s/Je5jVCUAYE)

To quote the reddit user.  
The ear moisture slowly building up on the nozzle filter and after some time you perceive an imbalance due to the filter getting ""clogged"" then you need to put it to sit w/ silica gel to dry it out. But after 1-2 weeks measuring it, I noticed the channel match gets a bit ""worse"" then replacing the filters it returns to the perfect channel match. I guess it's because the filter's pores get a bit clogged.

So I'm sitting here like, huh... That's a new one. Apparently I have moisture in my ear? Never had this issue with my previous iems what's so special about this one? The all metal housing, so I guess im gonna have to buy replacement filters for the iem. Which is a perfect transition to the next point.





°Filters/measurements. Kz zenith. Ft. kz zsn pro 2/kz es4.

And thus the reason this review was created in the first place. I could only find one post on the topic. [https://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/s/QbdkYfXapv](https://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/s/QbdkYfXapv) which was useful information for my kz zsn pro 2 and my kz es4, 5mm is the right size for both if anyone wants the Information.

https://preview.redd.it/pkwv5bkrqh0g1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=da921059fb6dfe105a40a3ccedad706aae0da5ef



Now after measuring the diameter of the zenith it came to 4.5mm according to my measurements, so I thought ok done deal let's buy the filters, wait a week then problem solved, nothing could possibly go wrong





(foreshadowing)





Once it arrives I'm excited, I try to change it, only to find out it was the right size... Exactly the right size of the hole...









FFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU









Another week passes, and got the 4.3mm variant and hope to god it's the right size filter cause I ain't waiting ANOTHER week if it's the wrong size. And lord and behold... 3rd TIMES THE CHARM BABY YYEEEEAAAAAAAAHHHH.

https://preview.redd.it/3h03pyt8rh0g1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6285042dab9f4769a2e5bd4e74901f61b1e77516

Now, after replaying the stock filters how do they sound? After 20 minutes of testing, the conclusion? Louder. by a decent margin, if given the opportunity, replace the stock filters cause the volume increase is noticeable.

So in conclusion. 5mm is perfect for the kz zsn pro 2 and the Kz es4. However, DON'T. get 4.5mm for the Kz zenith, make sure you get the 4.3mm variant.



For research and for reference, I also took multiple close up photos of the zeniths nozzle and innards cause from what I've researched, there's no images of them. Until now.

Now, onto the next segue I am in no way qualified to talk about, but I'll try my best to explain from an average person's POV



°sound. Kz zenith.

Now I know what you're gonna say, why not test it wired with a proper Dac? I did and it sounded amazing, detailed, loud, emphasis on LOUD. Like jesus christ I normally have my volume on my tws at 50% but it's so loud i only need 30% volume, however.  
  
Since I'm going to primarily use the zenith as a replacement for my Samsung galaxy bud 2 pro, it seems fitting that it be tested like a pair of tws, since I have no plans on constantly swapping from wired to wireless. That's just asking for the connecters to break prematurely.  
  
Now onto one of the hardest part for me to review... The sound.  
Cause Its not like seeing what comes in the box, or telling you how premium it feels, or testing out the battery life with the stopwatch on your phone.  
  
It's an area I have no idea how to cover properly, so take this part of the review with a grain of salt.

I'm gonna use the video, The songs I test headphones with. By dankpods [https://youtu.be/Y-c0zbdJxTA?si=HOCEY9gbioC\_fFMI](https://youtu.be/Y-c0zbdJxTA?si=HOCEY9gbioC_fFMI) as a point of reference if I can't properly describe the music/sound. 

  
Bass. One of the easiest ones to cover cause it's self explanatory. 
I won't just use the songs from the dankpods video and try to explain it better than him, but I will use them cause I don't know where to look for songs good for testing. so to start, here's one of mine. 



Blue Laces 2 - Nipsey Hussle, Victory Lap Dolby Atmos on 70% volume [https://youtu.be/r5ujo7icpH8?si=cwNUpd8s5GKsKO89](https://youtu.be/r5ujo7icpH8?si=cwNUpd8s5GKsKO89)

Timestamp start of the song till 0:24 

The bass is clean not distorted or muddy, it's not head shaking levels of bass but you can feel it, like you can feel the bass from a sub woofer the rumble. Not to much nor to little, perfect amount of bass. Hope I'm not losing you yet we're just getting started. 



Teddy Killerz & Pegboard Nerds - Pump
Dolby Atmos on 70% volume [https://youtu.be/8QegH8nR3WM?si=s1-Rn9Tuk1h1m6h3](https://youtu.be/8QegH8nR3WM?si=s1-Rn9Tuk1h1m6h3)

Timestamp 1:46 to 2:10

Now for bass in a actual song. While in blue laces you can feel the rumble, here you can hear the thump from the bass throughout the song. As the song plays you can hear the thump, thump, thump, punctuated each time you hear it. 



Doing It Right- Daft Punk
Dolby Atmos on 70% volume [https://youtu.be/kLojMGNEJ1M?si=ScR6QvHun2eBQNRL](https://youtu.be/kLojMGNEJ1M?si=ScR6QvHun2eBQNRL)

Timestamp 0:19 to 0:43

Dankpods can sum it up far better than I ever could. To quote the man. [https://youtu.be/N6Y\_Q7RYmmY?si=6ZEVDuI\_AaOfrdII](https://youtu.be/N6Y_Q7RYmmY?si=6ZEVDuI_AaOfrdII)

Timestamp 1:30 to 2:08

Well an example song I use for really low bass, is daft punks doing it right. so it goes doing it right everybody will be dancing and be feeling it right, everybody will be dancing and the BOOF. 

That bass note right there, it's not a big bassy bit it's a low bassy bit, and so it's not about having headphones with heaps of base it's about if the equipment can actually play music that low, yes cheap headphones full of base can Woof it out but it usually gets muddy, and you know like nice headphones everything sounds crystal clear with that big boof underneath it. 

So tl:dr can it play the low bass bit while sounding crystal clear, with big boof... 



yes. 

  
Sub bass. Imagine bass but looooower idk how else to describe it, only got one example. 

If I Had A Heart (from Vikings) folk cover \[Audio Only\] 
Dolby Atmos on 70% volume [https://youtu.be/YixRssZULG8?si=bGPbQwk5jYa0EXwB](https://youtu.be/YixRssZULG8?si=bGPbQwk5jYa0EXwB)

Timestamp 0:04 till 1:20

From the start of the song till the end, there's this continuous low rumble throughout the song. Even during the chorus you can hear the low rumble from the sub bass especially at 1:39 to 2:01 it's not like blue laces 2 or Teddy Killerz & Pegboard Nerds - Pump. it's not front and center, it's in the background, a detail that not a lot of tws might pick up on but the zenith does. 

  
Soundstage. How wide and open the sound is, imagine you're in the audience of a live show. You can hear the instruments in different directions. Like you can point in the direction of a guitar in your left ear, while the trumpets on your right.

  
Eagles Hotel California 1994 MTV Live
Dolby Atmos on 70% volume [https://youtu.be/kuFu\_s46AcI?si=qjjeExaGWMdwKXD6](https://youtu.be/kuFu_s46AcI?si=qjjeExaGWMdwKXD6) 

Timestamps 0:12 to 0:32 

As the guitar continues to play in my right ear, at 0:23 i can hear the audience clapping on my left even as the clapping stops i can hear when it tapers off. 

As the song progresses, I can hear all the different instruments. From the booming bass of the Conga drums, to the shaker? Hope that's the correct term, at 0:41 on my right, to the other shaker on my left 0:45, all the while, there's this toc sound on my right. I have no idea what the instrument is called, if you know let me know. Then at 0:50 the toc sound then shifts to my left ear. 

All together, I can point to each instrument as if I'm there. All that in the first minute of the song. 

Tl:dr soundstage to my limited knowledge and listening to this song for 20 minutes, the verdict... 



it's good. 

  
Lightning round/personal favourite songs/details in songs I never noticed. 



Dragon Ball Z (Rescored)| Goku Transforms Into SSJ3 | By Gladius
Dolby Atmos on 70% volume [https://youtu.be/VqqFhnIgFDU?si=SwABsdtG7hGiQcM9](https://youtu.be/VqqFhnIgFDU?si=SwABsdtG7hGiQcM9)

While not a song in the traditional sense. The experience listening to this the first time I got the zenith was an experience words can't describe. 

  
Britney Spears - Toxic
Dolby Atmos on 70% volume [https://youtu.be/ICjG8t\_SnSg?si=Rc8FuNcBgX-EX7Mf](https://youtu.be/ICjG8t_SnSg?si=Rc8FuNcBgX-EX7Mf)

Timestamp for the cymbal 0:56 to 1:11


I noticed the official music video audio [https://youtu.be/LOZuxwVk7TU?si=4ps5nCCRd9Jt1bcN](https://youtu.be/LOZuxwVk7TU?si=4ps5nCCRd9Jt1bcN)

Its muddier and slightly muffled. More so than the one that I'm using as a reference. 

I listened for the cymbal in my left ear to see if the zenith can pick up on that subtle detail. 
And holy shit there it is, I've heard this song a couple of times over the years but I never knew there was a subtle cymbal tink, tink, tink. 

  
Earth, Wind & Fire - September
Dolby Atmos on 70% volume [https://youtu.be/Gs069dndIYk?si=Jlom8U0Tub\_B5Dpe](https://youtu.be/Gs069dndIYk?si=Jlom8U0Tub_B5Dpe)

I can no longer unhear the bongo man in my right ear. Like dankpods said, it's like he's in my room. 

  
The Rock Orchestra - Bring Me To Life (Evanescence) ft. Erin Fox [https://youtu.be/mwjbULl3E8s?si=WbSlfS64LDRC6ysa](https://youtu.be/mwjbULl3E8s?si=WbSlfS64LDRC6ysa) 

I can no longer listen to the original this is THE definitive version of this song. 

  
Mai Yamane - Tasogare - 1980

Dolby Atmos on 70% volume [https://youtu.be/\_jsEs1NBrUY?si=VASMaP2NyRJj2Ovj](https://youtu.be/_jsEs1NBrUY?si=VASMaP2NyRJj2Ovj)

Put this here cause again thank you YouTube algorithm. Now saw this in my recommendations and thought huh never knew there was a Japanese cover. So clicked on it and... Wow. Just. Wow. 
It even sounds more sensual than the original. Even though I don't speak the language, I can appreciate the beauty of the dudes voice and the alternative arrangement of careless whisper. 

  
Sasha Alex Sloan - Dancing With Your Ghost Dolby Atmos on 70% volume [https://youtu.be/Qzc\_aX8c8g4?si=ZdHYtV-sysJj7BhT](https://youtu.be/Qzc_aX8c8g4?si=ZdHYtV-sysJj7BhT)

Usually I hate sad songs cause it's either way to depressing or the emotion the song that its trying to portray, I just don't feel it. This song and her other song older, hit so close to home, and is one of the few sad songs that deliver the message the song is portraying and nails it. 



  
°Conclusion. 

At the end of the day, hope this review/experience/miscellaneous thing's reviewers don't cover or document, helps somebody Decide whether or not they should consider buying the Kz zenith/kz-an01. for me it was one of the best purchases I've ever made. 

I started writing this review 4 months ago doing a little bit each day now finally complete. 

This all started because I couldn't find the information I needed on the Kz zenith nozzle dimensions/size. All the reviews I saw and none of them had the information I needed. then I thought huh, in the advertising for the kz-an01 it's paired with the zenith, and I have both so let's take a page out of thanos book and do it myself. 

If I couldn't answer your questions on the Kz zenith or the kz-an01 comment and I'll try to answer to the best of my ability.

1otq5z7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1otq5z7/aita_for_having_a_roster_including_some_age_gaps/,AITA for having a roster? (Including some age gaps),"Here's a lot of background information on me 31M. I'm writing all this so no useless questions get asked like on my previous attempts.

I studied applied physics from 18 to 25. Yes the courseload was so fucking insane I still don't know how I did it. I still get a very bad feeling in my stommack thinking about it. During this shit I stil had a constant 8 hour sleep schedule and worked out twice a day(freestyle wrestling, BJJ and some weights). So there was no time for a girlfriend. Thinking back on it if I gave up sports I probably would finished it in 5 years instead of 7.5. But if i quit athletics I would've quit my schooling aswell. It was the only thing than kept me sane.

I had no friends no social life nothing. Girls we're not remotely interested. I'm not bad looking I've always been in shape. But I was broke as a motherfucker. And in Highschool I needed good grades to enter good schools, luckily college is free. But I was still wrestling and studying combined with shit clothes, so no girls then aswell.

Anyways I graduated at 25. And got a few job offers paying about 80 to almost 125k usd a year. But my brother 31M at the time had graduated in Chemical engineering 4 years earlier. And had a startup with some of his mates all engineers of sorts. They really needed extra help but they didn't have  a budget. I was broke my whole life anyway and said fuck it I'll help. So from 25 to 31 I was basically working for free. I still lived with my mom and dad in the basement with my brother. Looking back on it it was the best time of my life.

I can't say to much on what our company was since you guys might track me down. But essentially we built software that would be able to help you use (certain) energy more efficiently. Any how we eventually got bought out by the goverment for something completely else we had a patent on. Everything else was bought out too because it's interconnected. I won't say how much we got but I'm financially free and independent for the rest of my life. I'm not a centi millionaire remotely but I'm allright. So is my brother. He actually has had the same girlfriend since he was 19. He met her in college. She was actually our main source of income and was the reason me and my brother had money to invest. She worked as a nurse btw.

Anyways he moved out as soon as the first installment from our goverment money. (You don't get it all at once). He married two weeks later and she's now pregnant. No joke she payed for my bjj,wrestling and gym memberahip for six years. I am not lying

I haven't had a job for the past two months. I still live with my parents and I do fuck all. I literally only lift, wrestle and do bjj. Most of my money is invested in stocks and some other stuff and I live of the gaines. I'm also welcome to get a goverment job if I want to (part of the buy-out).

So here's the thing. I lowkey wanna have a roster. I didn't so shit in college except be insanly unhappy because my major was so fucking hard. Highschool was dry because I had to get into uni.

For the past few months I've been training alot and unlike wrestling bjj gyms have females. Like actual real girls. I've never ever thought I'm good looking. Or that I'm a chick magnet. But for some reason I do well with girls when I spit my game.

I'm 6.5 and like 245 so I only ever roll with the dudes. But lately I've been going over to talk to girls and since I've been training since 12. I can actually be usefull at the same time. And my days shit has been going well. Also I have some money so my clothes have been better. I've approached girls in cafés, malls and restaurants. I finally have my first car. Who is pretty nice nothing crazy but it's above average atleast.

I actually get attention from WOMEN. Look I know if I was a nobody I would be less succesfull. But I don't give a fuck. I really want a roster. There's a couple girls 21 year old albanian girl. A 20 year old Swedish girl. A 36 year old girl and 40 year old. And I've been just going crazy tbh. I'm having the time of my fucking life. I never had a single experience with a girl before this. It's been amazing. There all FWB's tho.

But last week I was with my Albanian girl. I took her out to eat bought her some clothes and went out for coffee. When I went home I saw a insta reel about age gaps. And the commenta where very wild and I went here on reddit to see what your outside views on them are?

Back in September I was dragging through work, so I put a little jar on my desk and started tossing in scraps of paper with tiny wins. Stuff like watered the plants before they yelled, wrote two good sentences, returned a cart for someone in the parking lot. Some days the win is just I put on socks that match, other days it is I called the dentist and didnt panic. When the week feels like mush I dump the jar and read them out loud, just me in the living room with a dumb grin. It is goofy and it works way better than I thought. My friend came over, pulled one that said fixed the squeaky cabinet, and added her own that said danced while doing dishes. Now the jar looks messy and alive and that makes me happy.



What would go in your jar today. First sip of coffee that slapped, finished a book, texted your cousin back, finally learned how to open a coconut without fear. I will steal the good ones for mine, fair warning.

If you drink caffeine, you have to drink it consistently. Drink the same amount at the same time every day. Drinking more *OR LESS* than your usual amount, or not keeping the time consistent, can seriously mess up sleep. 

I saw a post recently about someone who sometimes drank zero caffeine and sometimes drank a huge amount. That’s gonna mess you up. 

Treat it like a prescription medication. You don’t just take it willy-nilly. 

As powerful as caffeine can be keeping you awake, it can be just as powerful in helping you fall asleep. If you’re used to falling asleep X number of hours after having a cup of coffee, and you suddenly quit the coffee, you may suddenly have total insomnia. (At least that’s what happened to me…)

That's the main perk, though. People rarely use branded coffee mugs or pens. On the other hand, food creates an experience, gets consumed and enjoyed, and often gets shared with family or colleagues. It may disappear after it's eaten, but the memories and positive association with your company will remain. That said, there is something to be said for always having your brand logo prominently displayed any time someone opens the cabinet or drawer.

Here's some data to chew on: [in a Harris Poll survey](https://www.businessinsider.com/sc/tips-and-ideas-to-make-corporate-gifting-more-meaningful), 71% of employees said they feel an increased connection with an employer who gives them a thoughtful gift.

POV Autumn



I wake up looking like Medusa herself after no sleep.



I drink three cups of coffee, and I hate coffee.



It fells like a strange alien has taken over my body.



My parents watch me with raised brows but never say a word. 



My boyfriend, Jessie, walks in, and greets them and tries to steal food off my plate. I smack his hand.



""Fuck off!"" I hiss.



Now, all three of them have raised brows.



I stuff my throwing axes in my schoolbag, and nobody lectures me today about the repercussions of accidentally killing someone.



Did I wake up on the wrong planet?



Jessie tries to touch me, and his touch repulses me. I shove him into the wall. He blows up and stomps off.



Dad drops me off. ""Try not to kill anyone today, Button,"" he smiles as he parks and heads into the school office.



My best friend Lesley appears at my side, and eyes me head to toe.



""You're different today,"" she says.



""How am I different?"" I ask.



""You smell different. You're usually sweet as pie, but you have a scowl on your face like someone pissed in your cornflakes.""



""Couldn't sleep, and Jessie just seemed ugly to me today. Then he tried to touch me, and it felt gross. Like swamp slime.""



""Jessie's Marks gross? Were you abducted by aliens?""



""Maybe the jury is still out.""



I'm stop at my locker for my math book when one of my axes fall out. 



While I'm picking it up, I spot the annoying future Alpha Cash Winters kissing his girlfriend.



I low, threatening growl escapes me.



Cash turns and locks eyes on me.



My heart flutters, and something deep inside me awakens.



Cash walks up to me with a sexy smile on his face that leaves me short of breath.



My heart pounds in my chest. While Abigail stands behind him, mortified, he's moving on already.



""Autumn,"" Cash says. My name in his mouth makes my body hot. I just want to slam him into my locker and kiss every inch of him.



He puts his hand around the wrist with the axe and pulls it out of my tight grip.



""You're shifting soon."" He smiles. ""How are the nightmares? Are they getting any better?"" He says, like we've been dating for years.



I catch his scent of mint chocolate as it hits my nostrils, making me feel dizzy; it's my favorite scent.



He runs his massive hands through my dark red hair and moves his face dangerously close to mine. He peers into my green eyes like he owns them.



""Autumn! You have a boyfriend."" Lesley growls.



I snap back to reality and pull myself away from Cash. I grab my bag, slam my locker, and then chase after Lesley before we're late for class.



""Autumn!"" Cash yells.



I turn around to catch my throwing axe mid air and run to catch up with Lesley.



My first class is with Cash. I can feel his eyes on me.



His scent weighs heavily in the air as my heart pounds in my chest and my hands grip the desk.



I'm supposed to be writing notes. But having him near me is too distracting today.



I look over to Lesley, who is watching me, mouthing, ""What's wrong with you?""



I shrug my shoulders and fan my clothing.



I feel like it's a hundred degrees in here.



The teacher walks up and places a note on my desk.



I read the note. ""Miss Rain, you appear to have symptoms of shifting soon. Please report to the guidance counselor. She's expecting you.""



I glance at Lesley and head out of class.



I knock on the door that says Guidance Counselor, Mrs. Greenway.



""Come in, Autumn."" A female voice says.



""Hi, you can call me Tracy. Your teacher said you are showing signs of shifting soon. I see your birthday isn't for another month. The more powerful the wolf, the earlier the signs. Do you have any questions about mating, porn or sex once you're done shifting?""



""Porn?""



""You would be surprised how many students ask about it.""



""Um, I just have a few rather normal questions. Is it normal to have nightmares before shifting? I have a boyfriend, yet I suddenly have a bizarre desire to kiss Cash Winters.""



""Your hormones are all over the place, Autumn. Cash is a handsome wolf who will be shifting soon himself. He will be the future pack Alpha. It's normal to be attracted to powerful wolves while your body is naturally starting to find your mate.""



""My boyfriend Jessie says he is my mate.""



""Some sense it early, but can't know for sure until they shift.""



""I just want to feel normal again. I feel like I have an alien inside me that wants to make poor decisions for me.""



""What kind of poor decisions?"" Tracy asks.



""Cash Winters, man whore, poor decisions."" I hiss.



""Says every girl who walks in here with the name 'Winters' written all over their notebook.""



""For fuck's sake, you're not listening to me."" I slam my axe deeply into her desk. ""Do your fucking job and fix me!"" I growl.",1,1762808875.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

I’m in Hyderabad right now, and I’m looking for **1–2 genuine people** who are open to becoming friends and spending a few hours on weekends **making something together** — videos, ideas, small projects,  even if it turns out completely shitty.

Together we start own insta pages as side hobby, and I am planning to post something weekly, face/no face .I think, if we keep doing this for 52 weeks, 53rd video/content will be crazy.

I don’t care about followers, fame, or “creator lifestyle.”  
I just want to build a habit of creating, doing, trying, failing, laughing, and improving — with people who feel the same.

If you are:

* someone who overthinks but still wants to try
* someone who wants to do more than just scroll
* someone who wants to create *something*, even if we don’t know what yet
* someone who just wants honest company with no ego

…then maybe we can try doing this together.

No pressure.  
No awkward expectations.  
We can meet for chai or coffee, talk about ideas, and if the vibe matches, try making something small — even a 10-minute shoot.

If this resonates with you, comment here or DM.

In short, she was looking for something between a sex-friend and a girlfriend, and I liked it. 

Last time I saw her, we cuddled on the couch and reflected that it was going well. Later that week I get a text that she'd rather be platonic friends, but we should catch up over coffee. 

Before we can do that, it's another text that she didn't have the energy to keep up the friendship, but she'd drop by to pick up some stuff at my place. 

And now a week later, she says keep the stuff, she has to learn to say no, and wishes me well going forward. 

In this span we haven't seen each other, and I've done my best to respect her wishes regarding level of contact. I only asked a few times if she'd ever like to catch up. 

Now I can't ask her : what the hell did I do? It's like I've somehow done something monstrous to her without realising it and she needs to cut me off before it gets worse. What can I do to process what happened ? ",4,1762808486.0,actuallesbians,3,1.0,False

I enjoy most types of food, music, movies, activities, I mean you name it and I probably have a wide variety of things in that particular category that I like. But nothing beats fresh homemade coffee made by yours truly.

Typically you'll find me at home because I can really sink into the homebody characteristic but I really do like to go out and have fun as well. If you want some pointers on how to miss all the mini golf puts then I'm your man.

I also like to workout and try to stay in shape. A healthy lifestyle is important for me. I’m still a big snacker though...

If you need a thrift buddy then I’m definitely your man. If thrift shopping is like modern day treasure hunting, then that makes me the Captain Jack Sparrow of the 21st century. So come join my crew 😉

They were originally $12-something, so I thought $6-something was pretty good for 8 pods. I bought one box to try and see how I liked it, and made a mental note to check for those pods again the next time I was at Target. 

Well, I went back today and bought another box of the same pods. The price on the shelf said they still were half off. When I scanned them at self-checkout, I got a notification that I would need assistance from an employee. The lady came over, scanned the machine and rang it up for $0.05! I asked if she was sure that was correct, and she said yes, that I needed employee assistance because they were ""recovery"" items (almost madr it sound like they were going to the dump). I went back and bought the 14 other boxes on the shelf!

He seemed super nice and down-to-earth — we talked about life, work, goals, all that. Toward the end, he mentioned he had been guided into *financial freedom* by someone he met in his early 20s, and now he was set to retire in his early 30s

He said he wanted to help us do the same and gave us his number. We didn’t think much of it — it honestly felt like meeting someone inspiring who wanted to mentor us.

Fast forward to this week: we met up with him and his girlfriend ""just to get to know us better"" It started with big, deep questions like *“What does success mean to you?”* and *“How do you define a successful life?”* Then they went on about how important it is to surround yourself with the right people, that a 9–5 isn’t job security, how most people live paycheck to paycheck, etc. Also what goals do we have for ourselves and a lot of different hypothetical scenarios.  

It all sounded motivating until they started talking about *network marketing* and *multilevel marketing*, and how theirs was “different.” They said they meet weekly, give us books to read, and will show us a PowerPoint next week. They insisted *“there’s no money involved”* but then casually mentioned they get paid when someone else they mentor becomes successful. 

They said we’d get to meet their mentors — “successful people who retired early” — at an event next week in NYC, but the way it was presented felt super rehearsed and secretive.

After doing some digging, everything lined up with how Amway or similar MLMs recruit people — vague meetings, success stories, mentorship language, focus on mindset and financial freedom, etc.

We decided to politely decline, but I just wanted to post this here to say:  
 If someone randomly approaches you with a friendly conversation that leads to “financial mentorship” or “network marketing,” please do your research first. Legit financial education doesn’t require secret meetings, mandatory books, or recruiting others. Real mentors won’t make money based on your participation or “success.”

The couple we met were kind and seemed genuine — which honestly makes it even trickier to spot. But this experience was a huge reminder that **not every opportunity that sounds empowering is what it seems.

most recently i started talking with a classmate and it seemed to go great. we had great conversations between classes and he seemed interested. i asked him last week if he’d like to hang out after school, suggested getting coffee and studying, he agreed and even suggested what we should study for. then today i texted him about just asking if he’s still interested, and what day would work for him, and he’s left me on read for almost an hour at the time of writing this. so im basically considering that his way of telling me he’s not interested. i know there’s a chance he opened on accident or forgot to respond but i don’t want to get my hopes up

before him, i went on a church trip for two weeks and started talking with a guy there. again great conversations and tons of shared values. there was an age difference however so id like to believe it was because of that, that we didn’t work out. he was very nice about rejecting me thankfully, and we’re still friendly 

i’ve always heard that a girl asking out a guy is attractive, and that what we consider to be “subtle” signs are not at all obvious to guys, so we should be more direct with our interest. so i’ve tried that, and it’s just not working. before both of these guys i had some luck i guess, directly flirted with a guy but then all he wanted was a hook up..

what am i missing? i know it’s hard for strangers to tell me, considering you guys have no clue who i am. what is something i could be missing or just not understanding? i’m not going for guys way out of my league either, so that’s not the issue. all i want, or at least i consider to be the goal, is to get a date. at least with a date, then we can get to know each other and if a guy isn’t interested after, fair enough. i just don’t know what about me is so unappealing that i can’t even get one date with a guy",1,1762808187.0,dating_advice,8,0.67,False

I am just going to say the church and leaders did say…

*Coffee and tea was not allowed. Not optional. 
*All and full garments were required. Not optional. As girls you even needed to dress like you had them as a teen in order to show your worthiness.
*You were given you own planets to populate if you reached the top tier of the celestial kingdom, and your husband could have multiple wives. 
*You would not be with anyone in heaven who was not in the top level of the celestial kingdom like you. (no grandpa and grandma) 
*You could not have sex and still go on a mission and/or you came home. 
*You could not have a civil marriage ceremony and still get married in the temple. Your family could not come or you had to wait a year if you wanted that option. 
*The 3 Nephites roamed the earth and were among us so watch out. (3 elfs on the shelf watching you. Haha)
*People with any color were desendants of Cain and cursed. (Save the Lamanite children and make Native Americans kids come live with is because we are better program.) 
*The Garden of Eden is in America. 

This is just a small list of sooooo many other things were taught and enforced. The fact that rules are optional now and or it is completely denied that this was done makes me rage!! I knew this was all bullshit at age ten but every adult in my life told me I was wrong so I denied my truth until it was safe to do so….thank you to myself and my amazing husband. So grateful my kids don't have to go through this! Thanks for letting me rage. 🙂

It got to me after a while, how I made more than some but had no money to go out to eat or buy new clothes, or just travel and spend more on gas. I thought I would be better off soon, so I took a micro loan to have money to spend.

Long story short... That micro loan turned into ten others.

I am now making double the amount I was when this all started, but the ""double"" of that pay is actually going to paying back those loans no one knows I have, and I would be mortified if they found out.

I have absolutely no money left each month, I can't even afford a single cup of coffee to have and meet with friends. Yet, everyone knows I am getting paid well due to my profession.

Luckily, drugs also are common with my profession so maybe everyone just thinks I am an addict.

Jokes aside, I am furious at myself for digging this hole... I could actually be very well off now and living comfortably, but yet I am struggling to stay afloat.

The thing is. I've been constantly dropping to the point where now I only have 8 visits in the past month. nothing in the past two weeks. Post views(meaning chapters read) have also dropped to a bit fat zero.

Although I am adding benefits, there is no point if nobody checks out my page haha.

I am also building a following on tiktok where I promote and my readers are increasing on Royal Road(where I post free chapters), but if nobody bothers with the patreon then that's useless.

While I know 30 visits is mostly noise, a drop to 8 and soon 0 still seems absurd. I've checked the links, and they work.

  
Is this a clean sign that I've failed? I am investing a lot of time into all this. A lot of time that i don't have, so maybe there are some other authors around here that know what kind of sign this is so i know to stop bothering at least?

I started Triz on 5mg and haven’t upped my dose, but I’m curious if anyone has experienced eye pressure? That’s more concerning to me than the twitching. And, did it go away? 
I’m planning to cut out my morning coffee to see if that helps me in case that triggers anything but, I drink water all day. 
My appetite hasn’t changed much on Triz but I do have more energy and my mood/hormones have improved so im hoping i don’t have to get off of it just yet.

I've got a few handhelds and decided vertical wasn't for me due to the discomfort. I've had the Miyoo Mini which is lovely but too small and also seemed easily breakable (Parkour, rock climbing, hiking and motorcycle hobbyist here).

I use the Miyoo A30 as a pocketable device but do find the screen too small. I've also been using the Powkiddy A10 which is a great size but due to the shoulder buttons didn't seem pocketable and suffered from being plastic and thus feeling breakable.

When I purchased the Brick I was unsure if I'd just bought it for the excitement alone, whereas I like things to have uses and to be used.

As soon as it arrived it felt strong, the metal shell is awesome and I have no worries about keeping it in my pocket. I have even kept it with me to work, out for a coffee and general out and about activities where I'd usually leave a handheld at home in thoughts I wouldn't need it.

1otpcyf,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1otpcyf,30/d fast complete + electrolyte recommendation!,"**Stats:** 

43m 6’0” SW 316 CW 270.  Total lost 46 lbs on fast.  My heaviest was 345.  \~75bs down from my heaviest.  BP was \~130/90.  Now \~105/70

First ever fast. Some pretty significant neurological issues that lead to me no longer being able to exercise. \~20 days of water fasting, and 10 days of green tea drinking. I was planning on drinking coffee initially, but realized I just didn't care or need it right then. 



**Ending the initial fast:**

I planned on going 45d or more when I broke my fast, but I was having feinting issues and some mild kidney pain.



**My biggest lessons learned are:**

I can live without food for a while, no 3 meals a day needed, none of this other garbage. I can apply the same determination and willpower I use in my daily life to food, its no different.

Hunger is interesting. Fasting resets your mental relationship with hunger.  You realize that what you think is hunger can be a host of things. Boredom, habit, digestion, etc.

My relationship with food feels like it has changed.  I am not sure yet where that will lead to long term, but taking it day by day.



**Refeed:**

First day I had a few cups of Kettle and Fire mushroom and beef bone broth.  Made devilled eggs and had 3 for lunch.  For dinner I had 3 tablespoons of rotisserie chicken and a cup of salad (no sugar vinaigrette, red onion, a little grating of parmesan, tomato, and romaine).  

Second day I had dry aged a few ribeye for the family.  Next day I fried up some jalapeno in beef tallow and added a slice to the 3 deviled eggs I had.  Then I had a cup of salad for dinner and ¼ of a ribeye.

Probably a total of about 800 calories a day.  I went back into fasting after that. I lost 1lb while refeeding.



**Electrolytes/water:**

I followed the recommendations here on the forum, but only to about ⅔ or less sometimes.  Though it turns out my salt was fine, you can see from the charts my potassium was quite high.  I would recommend for people to be careful with the recommended potassium level from nosalt.

I also drank a bunch of water, basically until my urine was light wheat / little more than clear.



**Ketones:**

I didn’t get my ketone meter until after I finished the 30d fast and was into the second day of refeed, but they were 3.8.



**Medicine / supplements:**

I continued taking my laundry list of medicine I am on throughout my fast.  I added in TUDCA, Amino acids, calcium / phosphate.



**Existing health complications:**

I have resting high muscle usage so it may have helped more calories burned.  I also had MRI with contrast and medical infusions while I was fasting. I didn’t have an issue with either.  Though eventually I was having blood flow issues for blood draws.



**Challenges:**

I had pretty extensive brain fog throughout.  I was weak when standing and out of breath easily.  I think my BP medicine ended up making my bp too low.  I zoned out quite a bit.  Electrolytes were good from tests.  I feinted once and had mild kidney pain.



**Amusing DR visit:**

I went to have my infusions (every 3 weeks).  The nurse took my weight and went to get me started.  She came back later and said there was an issue with the scale they had to re-weigh me.  I told her it was right.  She looked really surprised and said “you lost almost 30lb in 3 weeks??”  I told her yeah.  I told her I fasted for 28 days (at the time).  She asked what I did for nutrition, and I said nothing I just didnt eat.  She brought over all the nurses to ask me questions.



**Next Steps / Thoughts:**

During my refeeding I realized something.  My family said the food I made was some of the best food ever (I hadn’t cooked a lot in the month I was fasting).  I wasn’t really happy eating it.  Almost like the memory of eating and enjoying food was better than the reality and it hadn’t lived up to my expectations.  I wasn’t really enjoying feeling full, dealing with digestion etc.  

I also felt like I had to force myself to eat.  I wasn’t really hungry after the first day of refeeding, it felt more like something I should do.

So I hopped into my next fast.  3 days in so far. I dont think I will do another 30 day, maybe rolling 5-7 days.  My body gets too out of wack.",73,1762807323.0,fasting,21,0.97,False

[https://playfreestyle.co](https://playfreestyle.co/?utm_source=reddit_r_puzzles)

She came up with the idea over coffee two Christmases ago - we play word games every morning and she thought a rhyming game would be fun, so I built the MVP as a birthday gift.

The tricky part was getting the rhyming algorithm correct. I ended up building a 500k word dataset because as it turned out, none of the existing material was enough to make the game feasible. We have a two-step validation process now but we're still finding edge cases (as it turns out, programmatically determining rhymes is hard!)

Last week, there was an unexpected spike in visitors to the game (2k+ hits!). Given the new traffic, I thought it would be fun to add some new features, created a personality system that categorizes your rhyming style (quick short rhymes vs long complex ones).

Would love feedback if you give it a try. Will probably promote in a few places given the renewed interest and gauge if this makes sense to keep going. Thanks in advance!

Do these collages align with her claims that she's a frugal minimalist, who can't stand clutter due to her OCD, and rarely buys anything for herself?  (Her clothes are covered separately.)  Do you believe that she budgets to the penny 2 years in advance and has ALL of her/their bills paid 1-2 years in advance?  She claims she loves all her pets the same but nothing was purchased for the cats who love blankets. Can they afford more than the $25 or $50 they currently pay per month towards their multiple medical judgments (Missouri public records)?  

I feel her followers should be able to make an informed choice on whether to continue financially supporting them through likes, comments, views, and shares.  How can they do that when she keeps secrets about how she is paid? When is the last time she thanked them for supporting her lifestyle?  

I hope these recaps shed light on the deception and frivolous spending. ✌️

3.  **Think About His ""Me Time"":** What does he do to unwind? Video games? Reading? Working on his car? Get him something that enhances that sacred time. A new gaming chair, a subscription to Audible, or a high-quality set of mechanic's tools.

Finding the right Christmas gift for your boyfriend isn't about spending the most money. It's about showing him you listen, you understand his passions, and you love him for who he is. Good luck, and happy shopping!

I live in a tiny studio with paper thin walls and my upstairs neighbor has a drum pad at 2 pm. I’ve been using a quiet co working spot 3 days a week, signed their NDA, seat is in a no windows room, and I use my own travel screen privacy filter. Last week security posted a new policy that says no work from any shared space at all, coffee shops and co working included. Reason given is shoulder surfing and “unmanaged networks.” IT already forces VPN and full disk encryption, so this feels like a blanket rule that ignores reality. My focus and output are way better out of the house. I asked for an exception or a bigger WFH stipend so I could rent a private day office twice a week. Manager said maybe next budget cycle and suggested I work from my car, which is wild. Has anyone here gotten this kind of policy rolled back or at least tweaked. What arguments or data helped.

During the coffee, I kept things neutral, just getting to know him without romantic hints. He hasn't messaged since. Could he just not have understood my intentions, or that I'm interested?

1otp2bb,https://dailyboulder.com/trump-praises-himself-for-lower-grocery-prices-then-cnn-pulls-the-receipts/,Trump Praises Himself for 'Lower' Grocery Prices,"Trump recently heralded his administration's performance on the economy, specifically claiming a significant reduction in grocery prices and a marked improvement in affordability. Speaking to reporters on Friday, the former President dismissed criticisms regarding rising costs, instead pivoting to blame both the media—which he dubbed ""fake news""—and the current administration of President Joe Biden.

""If you look at affordability... prices are down under the Trump administration and they’re down substantially,"" Trump asserted, adding that his administration ""did a great job on groceries and affordability."" He further claimed that media outlets were deliberately avoiding coverage of this purported accomplishment because it undermined a narrative of economic struggle.

However, these claims immediately faced a robust challenge from CNN's Abby Phillip, who used her platform to present official government data that paints a starkly different picture. Phillip categorically stated that Trump's claims were ""simply not true"" and backed her assertion with figures from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).

The BLS data clearly indicated that grocery prices are not lower; they have risen since Trump’s inauguration. Specifically, compared to the previous September, the cost of food has increased by 2.7 percent. The surge is even more pronounced in specific categories:

* **Coffee**: Up 18.9 percent

* **Beef**: Up 14.7 percent

* **Meat, Poultry, Fish, and Eggs (collectively)**: Up 5.2 percent

The only acknowledgment of increasing prices from Trump came in the form of an announcement via social media: a request for the Justice Department to investigate meatpacking companies for ""Illicit Collusion, Price Fixing and Price Manipulation,"" which he framed as a crackdown on corporate malfeasance rather than a reflection of broader inflationary pressures.

The economic unease extends beyond the grocery aisle, and public opinion seems to align with the BLS data, not the former President's optimism. Phillip highlighted a CBS News/YouGov poll showing that 62 percent of Americans believe the cost of food is rising, while a mere 7 percent believe it is decreasing. The clear majority of the public, therefore, is directly experiencing price hikes.

Furthermore, the economic snapshot offered by the data included worrisome employment figures. A report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas indicated that U.S. layoffs surged to a two-decade high in October, with over 150,000 jobs cut in that month alone. This spike was partly attributed to the growing integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into business operations—an industry Trump has enthusiastically championed.

With a million layoffs recorded so far this year—a 65 percent increase year-over-year—Phillip concluded that the economic signals suggest belt-tightening and a reality far removed from the President's celebratory narrative. While Trump continues to tout economic success, both government statistics and public surveys suggest that for many American consumers, the story playing out at the checkout counter is one of increasing financial pressure.",1,1762806643.0,politicsnow,0,1.0,False

I was there for a mandatory check-up, feeling bored and a little awkward. Then, she walked in. She had this incredible energy, even though she was clearly nervous. She sat down a few chairs away, and I could hear her quietly humming to a song I loved.

My brain went into full panic mode. I knew I had to say something, but what? My actual life felt so boring at that moment. So, when she glanced over, I did something I've never done before. I pretended to be a visiting professor in the music department. I have no idea why I chose that, I can't even play an instrument. But she lit up. She was a music major, and suddenly we were deep in a conversation about composers I barely knew.

I kept the ridiculous lie going for the entire 30 minutes we waited. It was exhilarating and terrifying. When my name was called, I felt a huge pang of regret. I scribbled my real name and number on a piece of paper and confessed that I was just a regular student who was too nervous to talk to her. I handed it to her and walked away, convinced I had blown it.

To my absolute shock, she texted me an hour later. She said it was the weirdest and funniest way anyone had ever introduced themselves. We went out for coffee the next day, and I was my genuine, slightly dorky self. We've been together for eight years now, and married for three.

The recruiter spent 20 of those 30 minutes talking about irrelevant details in their own lives and were constantly THRILLED about insignificant stuff that we happened to have in common…like hair color and broad-stroke general interests. We didn’t actually have either in common, they just got so excited that we MIGHT have it in common….like we were in junior high interviewing to be besties.

They barely read the position’s description, and they didn’t read my resume. So, those 10 minutes I got a word in edgewise were them asking me to remind them what was already on the resume. Since they didn’t understand the finer points of the job’s requirements, they were overly impressed with basics and never gave me the opportunity to explain what sets me APART from other candidates. But they kept going back to the “neat” similarities they had been excited about previously…like how their boss and I are from the same state. Now they’re going back to their supervisor gushing over how much fun they had talking to me but can’t say anything extra to recommend me for the job I was perfect for. I’m sure there were other great candidates too, and if they were interviewed by my recruiter, they might be sol. It’ll just be luck over who made the recruiter feel happiest that day. 

I wish companies knew that they’re missing good candidates because their recruitment teams are terrible. This has happened to me several times. Once it happened to a friend who got the job only to find out that the staffing was so haphazard, and moral was so terrible, because personelle only cared about ice breaker games, expensive freebies in the break room (to make them look more successful than they were), and throwing parties on the company’s dime. Then they’d fire 5-10 people every quarter to pay for it. No one qualified enough was being hired. They were hiring based on how much fun the first interview chat was. 

Dear recruiters:

 -initial get-to-know-you pleasantries are fine but they shouldn’t take 2/3 of the interview time. They certainly shouldn’t be one-sided. You don’t need to play icebreaker games after you’re already acquainted. We’re interviewing for a job, not a coffee buddy. 

-we only have a certain amount of time in our days too. It’s just as rude to waste our time as it is for us to waste yours.

-please don’t waste the little opportunity we get to talk to a real person on stuff unrelated to the job. We can email about extra stuff later.

Is everyone lying when they make this joke? Because I was the few times I did.

Not once in my life has any Mexican food made me rush to the bathroom to blow my guts out. Not once has eating something spicy painted my toilet red.

🧭 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Big picture: Holiday season demand is spiking and fragmenting — mainstream cozy-gift searches are rising while niche aesthetics (e.g., “Gothmas”) and hyper-personalized goods are creating low-competition entry points for creators and sellers. Use short-form video + bundled digital + physical product funnels to capture attention → convert quickly. 

Key insight of the day (actionable): Package micro-niche seasonal aesthetics (30–90 day lifecycle) as low-cost digital lead magnets ($5–$25), upsell to physical or premium digital bundles ($20–$250). This leverages increased holiday search volume with low inventory risk. Data from Etsy & Google holiday signals confirms elevated searches for themed decor and gifts.

📱 PLATFORM BREAKDOWNS (TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, Pinterest, Etsy, Redbubble, KDP, Notion, Canva, Online Courses)

> For each platform: Top 3 money-making ops (detailed), 5 emerging trends, 3 cooling trends + pivots.

---

🎵 TikTok

A. Top 3 Money-Making Opportunities

1. Mini-Series “Aesthetic Gift Drops”

Why it works: TikTok’s algorithm rewards serialized content; holiday shoppers browse short formats for inspiration and purchases.

Monetization: Affiliate links ($3–$50 per sale), digital micro-guides ($7–$17), flash merch drops ($20–$45).

Saturation: Medium — many creators, but niche aesthetics (Gothmas, Nonna Holiday) still low competition. 

Actionable Prompt (step-by-step):

1. Day 1: Post 15–30s teaser — “3 Gothmas must-haves under $30.”

2. Day 2: Showcase product + link in bio (affiliate).

3. Day 3: Drop limited merch + countdown live.

4. Run 1–2 targeted Spark Ads ($50–$200/day) to 18–34 gift shoppers.

Example: Creator posts daily for 7 days; 0.5% conversion on 50k views → 250 clicks × $20 average order = $5,000 revenue in week.


2. Faceless “Holiday Micro-Audio Guides” (ASMR + how-to)

Why: Short guided audio sells well as downloadable MP3s/short courses; low production cost.

Monetization: $5 digital download, $25 bundle (5 guides), $80 branded package for small businesses.

Saturation: Low (especially for niche aesthetics).

Prompt: Create 60s clip → link to Gumroad product → retarget engaged viewers with Instagram Story.

Example: 10k views → 1% conversion to $5 product = $500.

3. Trend-to-Product Rapid Prototyping (48-72h)

Why: Creators who iterate fast capture first-mover sales on Redbubble/Etsy.

Monetization: POD items ($12–$40 margin), pre-orders ($15–$60).

Saturation: Low–Medium for highly specific motifs (e.g., “Nonna holiday” embroidered aprons).

Prompt: Identify trending hashtag → design template in Canva → upload to POD → announce pre-order.

Example: 100 preorders × $18 profit = $1,800.




B. 5 Emerging TikTok Trends

“Like sugar on my tongue” revival (short audio meme) — rapid reuse → viral reach. Monetize via brand syncs. 

Micro-hauls: aesthetic-limited drops — affiliate + pre-order.

AI-generated micro-influencers — sponsored content & avatar merch. 

Tutorial-to-product funnels (15s→link) — quick conversions.

FRIDGE-clip meme product placements — low friction placements.


C. 3 Cooling Trends + Pivot

Old: Broad “dance challenge” → Pivot: Use dance audio for product reveals (still leverage engagement).

Old: Long-form “day-in-life” → Pivot: Condense to 15–20s “value hooks.”

Old: Overproduced cinematic shorts → Pivot: Raw authenticity + niche commentary.



---

▶️ YouTube

A. Top 3 Money-Making Opportunities

1. Short-Form “10-Day Challenge” Series (Shorts + Companion Long-Form)

Why: Shorts drive subscribers; long-form deepens trust for course upsells. Google's 2025 YouTube trend highlights Shorts & serialized content. 

Monetization: Shorts ads & affiliate ($0.02–$0.10/ view), $49 mini-course upsell, $297 coaching offers.

Saturation: Medium — competition high, but niche topics lower.

Prompt: Publish 10 Shorts (each 20–45s) + one 8–12 min ""results"" video with funnel CTA.

Example: 1M Shorts views → $3k ad rev + 200 course signups × $49 = $12,800.



2. Faceless Animation Explainers (Vedic Astrology + Holiday Myths)

Why: Animation and legacy topics are resurging; scalable, high CPM. 

Monetization: Ads, Patreon tiers ($5–$25), exclusive PDFs ($9–$29).

Saturation: Low–Medium (quality barrier).

Example: 200k views on a long-form explainer → ~$400–$1,000 ad revenue + 100 patrons = $500/mo.



3. “Tool Walkthrough” Videos (AI for Creators)

Why: Creators search for AI workflows; evergreen searches.

Monetization: Affiliate software links ($30–$500/license), sponsored deep-dives.

Saturation: Low for specific vertical tool stacks (e.g., Canva + Notion automation).

Prompt: 1) Identify tool; 2) Create 8–12 min walkthrough; 3) Offer Notion template ($15).

Example: 50k views → $150 ad rev + 30 template sales × $15 = $600.




B. 5 Emerging YouTube Trends

💡 MONETIZATION SPOTLIGHT (Rotate Daily)

Strategy name: Micro-Launch Funnel (7–14 days)

Execution Steps:

1. Validate idea via one TikTok + one Pinterest pin (measure saves/CTR).


2. Build a $7 lead magnet (PDF/MP3) and landing page (Gumroad/Buy Me a Coffee).


3. Run $100 Spark/Meta test ads for 3 days targeting interest clusters.


4. Hold 1 live or pre-recorded webinar/workshop on day 7.


5. Offer 3-tier upsell: $29 digital bundle, $97 toolkit, $297 mini-coaching.

Why now: Holiday search intent is high; cost-per-click in many niches dips in early November before peak spend.

📰 FEATURED ARTICLES

Article 1 — Headline: “Gothmas & The New Holiday Micro-Aesthetics: How Creators Can Capture $1,000–$10,000 This Season”

(~650 words — data-driven, subheadings, urgency, examples)

Why it matters now
The 2025 holiday window is fracturing into micro-aesthetics—Gothmas, Nutcrackercore, Nonna Holiday—each with concentrated buyers who prefer distinct cues instead of mass-market lines. Etsy and design outlets report spikes in niche searches, creating low-competition opportunities for creators to launch themed digital and physical products quickly. 

Spotting the micro-aesthetic edge

Search volume concentration: Niche aesthetic queries show high intent—buyers search for decor + gift terms tied to a single look.

Psychology: These buyers aren’t price-shopping; they want identity expression; willingness to pay for authentic-looking items is higher.

Timing: Mid-November → early-December is peak planning; capture attention with content now for conversions later.


How to monetize in three lanes (fast)

1. Digital Lead Lane: $5–$25 downloadable style guides, printable tags, and mood boards. Low friction, high margin. Example: 1,000 downloads at $9 = $9,000.


2. Physical Product Lane: Limited-run ornaments, textiles, or printed aprons ($30–$120). Use POD for low risk. Example: 200 sales × $35 margin = $7,000.


3. Education & Services: Mini-courses (how to style, host themed dinners) and décor consults ($49–$297). Example: 50 students × $79 = $3,950.



Step-by-step launch in 14 days

Day 1–3: Research trending tags & top search keywords.

Day 4–7: Create 3 digital products + 3 POD mockups.

Day 8–10: Build 3 short-form videos targeting hashtags + 5 pins.

Day 11–14: Run lightning paid boost + open preorders.


Realistic numbers (conservative)

With 50k targeted short views → ~250 clicks → 2–4% conversion on digital products = 5–10 sales/day at $9–$29 → $150–$290/day in early traction.


Urgency: If you don’t launch in November you’ll compete in a flooded December market—deploy now.

(Actionable takeaway summary: 3 lanes, 14-day checklist, promotion playbook.)

Article 2 — Headline: “Shorts + Sales: The 30-Day Short-Form Playbook for Course Creators”

(~600 words — data-driven, subheadings, examples)

Context & Opportunity
YouTube Shorts and TikTok Shorts continue to drive top-of-funnel discovery. Pairing short-form consistency with a compact paid offering produces outsized ROI for course launches. Google & platform trend reports show Shorts are a dominant discovery method for 2025 audiences. 

3-stage playbook

1. Discovery (Days 1–10): 30 Shorts riffing on pain points → 20–60s each → CTA to landing page.


2. Trust (Days 11–20): 3 deep-dives (8–12 min) that show value → soft pitch at end.


3. Convert (Days 21–30): Live Q&A + 48-hr cart with bonuses.



Execution details & metrics

Produce 2 Shorts/day → target 200k combined views → estimated 0.5–1.0% landing page conversion.

Expected funnel: 200k views → 1,500 clicks → 1–3% lead magnet conversion → 15–45 buyers at $49 = $735–$2,205. Add 10–20% upsell to $297 cohort.


Tools & automation

Use Notion as project hub, Canva for thumbnails/assets, and an automated email sequence (ConvertKit) for cart close.


Why it works now
Shorts scale cheaply; ad saturation for longer-form content is higher. Rapid content + fast offers wins attention-to-purchase.

(Actionable takeaway summary: 30-day calendar, expected conversions, tool stack.)

The Good Girl's Guide to Cheating
😍What happens next👉Click Here to read on👉

Chapter 1
I had just said goodbye to my boyfriend when my phone buzzed with a message from an unknown number.
""Your boyfriend is cheating on you. You should look into it.""
Reading that message, my mind went blank. My fingers trembled as I typed.
""Which one of my boyfriends are you talking about?""
""Which one should I look into?""
The chat bubble kept showing they were typing, but a reply never came.
I was losing my mind.
Which one am I supposed to investigate?
***
I'm very pretty. To prevent me from going astray, since childhood, my mother taught me to be obedient and well-behaved.
She said hurting others isn't something an obedient and well-behaved girl should do. I have always kept her teachings in mind.
I was obedient and well-behaved at school; I was obedient and well-behaved at work. And I was obedient and well-behaved in dating three boyfriends.
After a long time, it finally replied.
""Forget it, I'll just have him investigate you.""
Right after that, I got the notification that she had deleted me.
I was completely devastated.
So, who the hell was cheating?
After calming down for a while, I had a guess in my heart.
It might have been talking about Ethan Carter. Because he hadn't replied to my messages in over 24 hours. The last time we talked was yesterday morning.
He said he was going into the mountains for two days and told me not to bother him unless it was important.
Of all my boyfriends, I've been with Ethan for the shortest time. He's also the youngest.
He just graduated from university, has a bold and passionate personality, and loves adventurous hiking. Could his trip to the mountains this time just be an excuse?
My phone buzzed.
It was Ethan, video-calling me.
I answered angrily, ready to confront him. But the moment I saw his handsome face, all my anger deflated.
""Babe, the typhoon knocked down the power lines. We just got a signal up here on the mountain.""
The video feed was a bit choppy. But I could still clearly see his surroundings. He was indeed in the mountains.
So it probably wasn't him.
Ethan might not be the most faithful guy, but I didn't think any woman would suffer with him in a place where the toilets were out in the open.
I breathed a sigh of relief.
Ethan was young, in great shape, and he's always clinging to me, calling me 'babe'. I didn't want to lose him yet.
""Is your girlfriend checking up on you again?"" A girl popped up from behind Ethan.
I almost forgot, Ethan has a female friend who's always by his side.
The smile on my face vanished instantly.
Ethan awkwardly rubbed his nose. ""It's rare to get weather like this, so Christian came up with me. It's not just her, Leo and the others are here too.""
Ethan pointed the camera at Leo. He was wearing a black windbreaker, and his dark hair made his red lips and white teeth stand out. He greeted me with a smile playing on his lips. ""Hey, Sophia.""
I couldn't help but swallow.
Of course, handsome guys hang out with other handsome guys. Behind one handsome face was an even more handsome one.
Looking at that face, most of my anger melted away. But if he gave me Leo's number, I wouldn't be angry at all.
Noticing my reaction, Ethan moved the camera away. ""Babe, I'll be back the day after tomorrow. You'd better miss me.""
His voice sounded a little pouty. I didn't know what he had to be pouty about. He was surrounded by handsome guys and beautiful girls.
If I were him, I'd be thrilled.
I offered a few casual words of concern and then hung up.
Looks like the cheater isn't Ethan.
So who could it be?
Could it be Richard Evans?
Chapter 2
Just as I was thinking, someone knocked on my door.
Outside, Richard stood with two takeout containers, giving me a warm, gentle smile.
""Sophia, let's have Fondue at home tonight.""
Staring at his smile, I was stunned.
I had casually mentioned wanting Fondue this morning, but this typhoon was especially fierce, making it impossible to go out. I didn't expect him to show up tonight.
He naturally carried the bags into the kitchen.
Of my three boyfriends, he's the most domestic. He loves to study cooking all kinds of delicious food in his free time. It's just a shame I'm not the only one he cooks for.
Richard's shoulders were damp from the rain. After putting the things down, he took off his t-shirt. His well-defined back muscles were right in front of my eyes.
The intense sight almost took my breath away.
""Sophia, I also brought you cake. Go ahead and get it out to eat.""
I obediently went to get the cake. But my eyes couldn't leave his body.
Richard is completely different from Ethan. He's very fair, so fair I could clearly see the blue veins under his skin.
As if sensing my intense stare, Richard gave a helpless smile. ""How can I cook if you keep staring at me like that?""
""Then don't.""
He raised an eyebrow. ""What?""
I quickly looked away.
I almost forgot—my persona is being obedient and well-behaved. An obedient and well-behaved girl wouldn't act like this.
Before long, Richard had the ingredients ready.
With the typhoon howling outside, we sat around the table enjoying hot pot—it felt particularly wonderful. The only downside was that Richard had put his shirt back on.
Halfway through the meal, he got a phone call. I don't know what was said on the other end, but his expression changed drastically.
""Sophia, I'm sorry. My sister suddenly has a stomachache. I have to go home.""
He didn't wait for me to say anything, just grabbed an umbrella and rushed out the door.
From answering the phone to leaving, it didn't even take a minute.
I sighed, looking at the empty chair across from me. I didn't even get to touch his pecs today. I should have made a move earlier.
Richard has an adopted sister.
We've been together for half a year, and his adopted sister has called him away on nine out of ten of our dates. I'm already used to it.
Staring Fondue, I thought carefully.
Richard is a surgeon, so he's usually very busy with work. In his free time, he's either with me or with his adopted sister. He definitely doesn't have time to cheat.
I know Richard's family very well. His parents would never allow him to be with his adopted sister. So there's basically no chance for them.
Since it's not Ethan, and it's not Richard, there's only one person left.
Jason Reed.
Chapter 3
Jason and I were university classmates.
He was handsome, a good student, and came from a good family. Calling him the golden boy wouldn't be an exaggeration.
Meanwhile, I was a nobody, practically invisible in our class.
Logically, with such a huge gap between us, our paths should never have crossed.
In reality.
That's exactly how it was.
We didn't say a single word to each other for all four years of university.
Back then, I was a truely obedient and well-behaved girl. My knowledge of men came from websites... and more websites. But Jason was different.
He went through girlfriends faster than went through changed websites. Until our junior year, when he met Chloe Miller.
The golden boy met the golden girl. Sparks flew instantly.
The playboy settled down, and their love was epic. For every anniversary, they'd treat the whole class to free cake to celebrate. I had some too.
That was my first time having cake. I still remember the taste. It was very sweet.
I thought their love was as sweet as that cake. I even secretly prayed for them to stay together longer. That way, I could get more free cake. But my wish didn't come true.
They broke up in our senior year.
I don't know why they broke up. But I knew that after the breakup, Chloe went abroad for postgraduate program. Jason didn't date anyone else either.
Until four years later, when Jason and I got together, Chloe came back.
Actually, I already knew.
Last month, Jason brought up the idea of marriage with me. But the next day, I saw a photo of him and Chloe on a university classmate's Social Media Feed.
After that day, Jason never mentioned getting married again. He became busier than before. He would just send me money transfers to get rid of me.
Luckily, I'm very understanding. I'd quietly accept the money and never bother him.
So, it looks like Jason must be the one cheating.
The next morning, I went to The Reed Group.
I'm a person of principle. I would never be with a cheater. So I was going to break up with him. And take the opportunity to demand a huge breakup fee.
But unexpectedly, I didn't see Jason. I saw Chloe instead.
She poured me a cup of coffee. ""This is Jason's favorite Geisha coffee. His taste hasn't changed after all these years.""
I lowered my head and took a sip. It was a little hot, and didn't have much flavor. Not as good as juice.
Seeing I had no reaction, Chloe smiled. ""I really didn't expect you can be with Jason.""
I nodded. ""I didn't expect it either.""
Chloe's brow furrowed slightly. ""Did you know, Jason actually flies to Los Angeles to visit me every year?""
I didn't know that either.
Just like I don't know about coffee, I don't know about Jason. Whether he likes Geisha coffee or his first love, I don't really care.
Chloe burst out laughing. ""How are you still such an idiot? Being with Jason hasn't improved you at all.""
Her laughter was a bit grating. I felt like she was mocking me.
I may be an obedient and well-behaved woman, but I won't let myself be bullied for nothing.
I grabbed the coffee cup and raised my hand. A whole cup of Geisha coffee splashed onto Chloe's face.
""Ah!""
The coffee was still hot, and Chloe screamed instantly.
""Chloe, what's wrong?"" Jason rushed in, anxiously checking Chloe's face.
""Jason, my face is burning.""
Chloe leaned into Jason's arms, crying pitifully, but didn't forget to shoot me a defiant look.
Jason, without asking what happened, yelled at me angrily, ""Sophia, apologize to Chloe right now!""
I pressed my lips together, staring at them.
While Jason's guard was down, I quickly picked up the coffee and splashed it on his face with lightning speed.
""Jason, we're breaking up!""
Hearing my words, he froze. For a moment, he even forgot to wipe the water from his face.
""You want to break up with me?""
I nodded firmly.
""Sophia, stop messing around. What kind of man are you going to find after we break up? Only me willing to be with you!""
I didn't answer him.
He didn't know. Girls like me, who look innocent and pretty, are in high demand on the marriage market. After all, who wouldn't want to find a dependable person to settle down with after they've had their fun?
Leaving the Reed Group Building, I was still a little angry.
But when I thought about the ten gold bars, two diamond rings, and a green jade bangle that Jason had bought me over the past year, I felt better.
I knew Jason well. He wasn't the type to ask for gifts back after a breakup.
Just as I was thinking about it, a woman stopped me.
""You're Sophia?""
The woman was tall, half a head taller than me. She looked me up and down.
""I'm Elaine Evans,"" she said slowly, her lips curling into a smile. ""Richard's sister. We need to talk.""

1otov2a,https://www.reddit.com/r/AustralianCattleDog/comments/1otov2a/acd_oddities/,ACD Oddities,"My family adopted a blue heeler mix about a month ago. He's a delight, and we can't imagine life without him. I'm curious about other ACD's likes and dislikes. Ours is almost 5 years old, but we don't know very much about his past. He definitely has some quirks.

* Favorite things: Soccer balls (especially if they're not fully inflated), watching squirrels, belly rubs, little dogs, kids, bacon-flavored treats
* Dislikes: Peanut butter, kisses on the head, baths, the Kong
* Fears: The dark (he sleeps great with a nightlight), BIG dogs, the basement (although, he's fine hanging out there as long as he goes in from the walkout; other stairs are no problem)
* Quirks: 
   * As soon as it's dark, it's bedtime, as far as he's concerned, so he gently encourages us to go to bed. When we don't take the hints, he sighs, moves to another sofa or room, and shoves his head under a pillow/blanket for a protest nap. 
   * He hates being left home alone (or even at home with someone other than me), but has no problem being left someplace else with someone who seems fine. If I hand off his leash, he will follow anyone through any door and not look back. 
   * When someone comes to the door, he doesn't bark. He quietly comes and gets someone.
   * He won't get up and start his day on his own. He snuffles around and stares at me until I get up. Then, he'll instantly take a nap once I sit down with my coffee.

The dislike of peanut butter is very surprising to me. Also, he's really adapted well to our routine and household. He's getting comfortable much more quickly than I expected, which is really nice for everyone. He's a very easygoing dog and seems very happy, despite all the recent tumult in his life.

1ototvw,https://v.redd.it/fav27s71mh0g1,So I made a thing...,"I was getting tired of manually adding all my beans into the Beanconqueror app, so I made an extension that automatically generates a scannable QR code for all beans in [Rotation.Coffee](http://Rotation.Coffee) 

Right now, these only work with the a la carte items (since they're available on the website) - but if the bean info for the subscription items would be added to the site, it would work for those too.

While the future of Rotation is unknown right now - it would be cool if these QR codes could be printed out (potentially even on the packing slip?).

  
Either way - I've really enjoyed Rotation and wanted to share.",9,1762806134.0,coffeerotation,2,1.0,False

I bought a cheap Breville Bambino, a 1ZPresso K-Pro, and other than some tamping paraphenelia, that's the setup.

I haven't cheaped out on coffee beans. I'm talking $20 - $30 per 12oz of whole bean. 



Anyway, some beans are crazy hard to grind. Very, very difficult, to the point that I wonder if I am doing something wrong. On the other hand, there's this bag (see picture below) that I buy - same grind setting, not notably different from the brew date, that's just a joy to grind at the same grind setting. 

  
It makes me wonder, have I been spending money on beans that no one would use for espresso? Like they are good beans but for other brew methods? These things seem so different that I don't think they are for teh same purpose. What is going on?

1otosba,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1otosba,"YouTubers Are Becoming CEOs, and It's Changing Everything","You know why regular TV and even big streaming services are losing viewers? It's because of YouTube and TikTok. People don't just want to watch stuff anymore - they want to be the show. They see regular people getting famous and getting paid directly by fans, and they'd rather try to do that themselves than just sit back and watch Netflix.

And the biggest YouTubers aren't even relying on ads anymore. They're building whole business empires outside of YouTube. Here's how some of them are doing it:

MrBeast isn't just a YouTuber anymore  he's basically a business mogul. His chocolate bar company Feastables actually makes more money than his YouTube videos do. He's also got MrBeast Burger, a toy line, and he's even trying to start his own phone company and bank. Dude might open a theme park in Saudi Arabia too.

Emma Chamberlain from the coffee world. She started Chamberlain Coffee and it's making serious money  like over $20 million last year. She just opened her first actual coffee shop location too.

Logan Paul and his Prime energy drink with KSI made over a BILLION dollars in sales. That's way more than he ever made from YouTube ads. He's got clothing lines and his brother Jake has a betting app.

There's Ryan's World  that kid who reviews toys? His family turned that into a toy and clothing brand that made $250 million in one year.

Rosanna Pansino from Nerdy Nummies sells baking supplies and cookbooks. Michelle Phan started a makeup subscription service called Ipsy that's huge. Huda Kattan built a makeup brand that makes hundreds of millions every year.

The point is, the smart creators aren't putting all their eggs in the YouTube basket anymore. They're building real businesses that will keep making money even if YouTube changes its rules or people stop watching. They've become their own media companies, and regular TV is having trouble keeping up with that kind of hustle.

And one way or another young kids wants to be like them",0,1762806039.0,WB_DC_news,7,0.13,False

I'm debating between an 85"" (outer blue tape) and 75"" (inner) for our living room.  The viewing distance is 11.5 ft, for which calculators recommend an 85"".  But is the 85"" too overhelming for the space?  The dining room is the open space to the left of the living room.  

We're hesitant to move the couch closer to the TV because it's a long room (see last pic) and thought it would look awkard if the seating space occupies such a small part of it.

A coffee table, accent chairs, media console, etc. still have to be added.",1,1762805853.0,hometheater,3,1.0,False

1otonfw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1otonfw,Grand Junction to Denver (CA Zephyr Tips for CO portion),"Some tips for those of you doing this segment or coming from CA, NV, UT:

* If boarding at Grand Junction at approx. 10 AM: The night before eat at [Bin 707](https://www.bin707.com/). The morning of eat at [Dream Cafe](https://www.dreamcafegj.com/) downtown. 5 min walk from the station. 
* If you are already on the train, go get a cinnamon roll to go at [Puffer Belly](https://pufferbelly-restaurant.menu-world.com/). The 7-10 minute break should be good enough. 
* Once on the train, put your stuff in your seat and then go to the observation cart. You will have some great views of the Rocky Mountains from there until Denver. 
* When approaching Glennwood Springs (around 12), call [Wild Coffee Roasters](https://wildcoffee.co/pages/cafes) or order online. During the 5-7 minute break, walk fast, get your stuff, and come back to the train. It's a short stop, but if you call ahead, you'll have plenty of time.
* If arriving at Denver, go to [Jinya Ramen](https://www.jinyaramenbar.com/locations/denver/) for some good Japanese food. A good live event venue that has entertainment every day is [Number 38](https://www.nmbr38.com/). 
* If going past Denver, you can get some good food inside of Union Station or order from local places to go. The 30-50 min break should be adequate. ",14,1762805739.0,Amtrak,1,0.95,False
1oton6k,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1oton6k/i_saw_god/,I Saw God,"This is the story of how I nearly lost my life to what I call the unexplainable.

Hi. I'm an entertainer. A very good one at that. My little brother enjoys watching my performances when he's available.

I work as a clown. My teachers always said I was very good at pulling unatural faces.

Our grandparents look after my little brother when I'm not around.

My family never really liked me all that much. Ever since I was a born they always tried to distance themselves from me as much as possible. Even tried kicking me out. My baby brother was the more favourable one of us two. Though, at least he respected me.

Even though he says I can be a little creepy at times, He still says he loves me regardless of how everyone else in the family views me. Thanks, Lil Brother.

I was performing my clown acts again. And as usual, people loved it. Nothing out of the ordinary here. It wasn't until near the end of my performance when I noticed everyone in the crowd all had the face of Jesus. It was horrifying. Jesus was blankly staring at me. As if I had done something wrong. When I blinked my eyes again everything was back to normal again. But someone in the crowd said that they saw a shadow standing behind me at one point during my performance. But I just brushed it off as them just trying to get a reaction out of me and I drove back home again.

I had myself a warm cup of coffee and then I headed to my room before I went to asleep for the night.

The next morning, I was sitting at the counter on top of my stool as I drank myself more coffee.

I woke up early today. Earlier than usual. My little brother was screaming almost all night long for whatever reason. At least I got a couple hours sleep.

Another day being a clown. Today, I got to hand out candy floss to every passing child. I also received lots and lots of hugs. How sweet.

That only lasted for a little while though.

People started noticing the unknown shadows appearing behind me again. This time there were multiple, They said. Creepy.

Now, I'm not big into supernatural stuff. But when I hear people mention it, I can't help but feel nauseous in my stomach. Especially after witnessing Jesus himself staring at me.

Anyway, I arrived home shortly after and this time the house was empty.

""Huh."" I said to myself. He must be at our grandparents place again.

I decided to drive there soon after getting changed into my regular clothes again.

I crawled through the window since the door outside was locked tight. I stood over my brother as he slept, Wishing him nothing but sweet dreams. But, Like a sense of horror towering over him, he immediately woke up & looked at me in fear. Pale as a ghost.

""I can't continue to love you. You don't know what you're doing to me. To the family.""

""I beg your pardon?"" I looked at him with my hands placed on my hips.

""YOU FUCKING CREEP! STOP STALKING ME WHILE I'M SLEEPING!"" He roared at me. And in that split second of intensity coming from his voice... I saw the face of God.

I felt my entire soul leave my body at that point.

""YOU ARE THE REASON MOM AND DAD KILLED THEMSELVES!"" This time. I only saw the face of God as he spoke. Not the face of my sweet little brother. God. Only God.

It made my skin crawl. I wanted to run away. I wanted to scream. But all that came out were pathetic whimpers of fear. He didn't speak to me spiritually. His face spoke a thousand words. He was going to banish me if I didn't quit what I was doing.

But that's just it, I didn't know what I was doing.

""Sometimes when you speak, you don't even sound like yourself. You sound like a different person altogether."" He said. Holding a gun in front of me.

""And your face... It's terrifying sometimes... You hardly look pretty anymore... I don't even think I can call you a sister... You just ruin everything you touch.""

I immediately felt my skin getting set on fire by invisible flames as I saw God chasing me. I blacked out from nausea.

Now I spend my final moments in a mental hospital, Reminiscing about the life I could have had, Had I been a better daughter.
