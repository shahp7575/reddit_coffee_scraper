The Rejected Luna Returns

Chapter 1
Ten years after being cast out by my family, my mate, and my pack, I met my former Alpha mate and brother by adoption in a small town.

After all these years apart, one had become a decorated Alpha warrior, the other a high-ranking Alpha—and I was just running a tiny coffee shop.

The moment our eyes met, both men froze for a long time.

Then Adrian hid the pregnancy test in his hand behind his back, and Mike slipped the jewelry he'd bought for his sister into his pocket.

I lowered my gaze, packed up the cake and coffee, and handed them over politely.

""Here you are, Alphas.""

The overly distant address made both of them falter for a second.

As they pushed open the door to leave, Adrian suddenly turned around and asked,

""You said you'd never bake desserts again for the rest of your life, didn't you?""

I smiled politely. ""Just something foolish I said in anger.""

The sound of children laughing and playing outside drifted in faintly through the glass door, but it couldn't break the stagnation inside the shop.

The two Alphas who'd teamed up to have me cast out from the pack all those years ago still stood at the cash register, refusing to leave.

Adrian clutched the box of macarons and coffee, his throat worked,

""Eden's having bad morning sickness. We're bringing her to stay south of the pack for a while.""

""Your mother… came with us too.""

""Would you like to see her?""

I shook my head as I wiped the counter. ""No need. Give my regards to Luna Juliet.""

Pausing, I added, ""Or don't mention it at all—better to avoid misunderstandings.""

My foster brother Mike's knuckles whitened as he tightened his grip,

""Hazel, all these years we—""

""Hazel!""

A girl with dyed green hair bounced through the door, threw her arms around mine, and shook me, ""I'm starving!""

A genuine smile finally spread across my face as I tapped her nose, ""There's your favorite chocolate chip cookie in the fridge.""

""Noooo,"" Isla whined, ""Hazel, eat with me.""

I glanced helplessly at the two men, my smile fading: ""Alphas, your cake and coffee are ready.""

Adrian's gaze flickered when he heard ""chocolate chip cookie.""

Mike stared blankly at Isla's lively figure, the rest of his words died on his lips.

I took Isla's hand and walked into the back kitchen, the automatic door sliding shut to cut off their view.

When I emerged again, the shop was empty.

Isla mumbled around her fork: ""Hazel, do you know those two Alphas? They were looking at you weird.""

""When they arrived, I saw a whole entourage—warriors and everything.""

""I heard one's a famous Alpha warrior across all packs, and the other's a respected Alpha.""

I kept my head down as I sorted through receipts. ""Here, they're just customers.""

""If I really knew people like that,"" I poked her forehead gently, ""would I be waking up early every day to bake you cakes and cookies?""

Isla giggled, leaning in to whisper in my ear:

""Word is that Alpha warrior's Luna is that other Alpha's sister—they came all the way here for her to rest during her pregnancy. It must be wonderful to be so cherished.""

I nodded calmly, tossing a used piping bag into the trash can.

Of course I knew how much they spoiled Eden.

After all, ten years ago—

One had had me committed to a werewolf psychiatric hospital on our mating ceremony night, branding me a laughingstock, a madwoman.

The other had announced my death to the pack and personally driven me out into exile.

Together, they'd shattered me completely and cast mee into a living hell.

I had a male classmate last semester who I ended up really liking and developing a bit of a crush on. I had a few interactions with him last semester, all of which were friendly, and it always felt like he was on the brink of asking me to hang out, get coffee with him or the like but always got nervous and stopped short of actually asking. I'm pretty socially awkward myself and would also get nervous before I actually was able to ask him. I'm also more traditional and generally just tend to believe that men should be the ones who do the approaching/asking out etc so I decided to just wait for him to ask me out (while also starting conversations with him and doing what I thought was clearly giving him signs that I was interested). 

The semester ended and he never ended up asking me, and now this new semester we're in a class together again. I haven't talked to him yet this year because for whatever reason now he seems like he is avoiding me/going out of his way not to sit near me or start conversations with me. I feel like it's because he expected me for some reason to be the one to ask him to hang out and got frustrated when I never did. I still like him and am willing to be the one who asks him if it really has to be like that but feel like now he's probably no longer interested anyway. Should I still try to approach him? I had generally thought until now that the vast majority of men wanted to be the ones who take the initiative and approach women.",1,1768710837.0,AskMenAdvice,3,0.67,False

Hannah is sat on the couch in her own damn apartment, and Charlie who doesn’t even live there is standing in front of her yelling at her demanding her to read her own diary entry out loud to him like he’s her dad and he’s grounding her. Marnie is standing behind her, enabling her boyfriend’s loser ass behavior, and also so pissed at Hannah and telling her to just read it to him and do what he says. 

I remember being in my 20’s and putting up with situations similar to this, and my friends putting up with similar shit from me. Tolerating audacious, immature, shit-ass behavior from your friends boyfriends who are objectively wrong and out of pocket in every aspect of the bullshit that unfolds, but rolling your eyes and complying anyway because you love your bestie so much, and you hope in her heart that she’ll cool off and come to her senses eventually and stop subjecting you to being a third wheel to the rusty crumbling tricycle that is their relationship. 

Anyway, Hannah reads them the same entry he just read out loud to every confused drunk person at the bar in Brooklyn, to which Charlie huffs and puffs and acts surprised like he didn’t have it memorized already. He then says he wishes he never found it but he did, making himself the victim of his own invasion of a woman’s privacy. 

Marnie tries to explain how this isn’t even her journal so she doesn’t understand why Charlie is so mad at her. Charlie starts screaming about why would Hannah lie about her feelings in a journal, because men who are stupid and don’t have any good points will often raise their voice to scare the women they are screaming at into shutting up. Marnie then starts yelling at Hannah about why Hannah would want the whole world to know about her relationship by writing it in her journal, which makes literally no sense but it’s because Marnie just got yelled at by a scary man who looks like American History X, so she has to take out her feelings of frustration on the only other person in the room who isn’t being scary on purpose. 

Charlie then says that he deserves honesty and respect because he is an important part of the community that is Hannah and Marnie’s apartment. He is able to make this demand for respect because he has never been held accountable to the consequences of his own actions before, so therefore he is able to overlook the fact that he just invaded his girlfriends best friends private diary and read it out loud in public to a room full of strangers in order to start problems on purpose, and is incapable of seeing how that’s not very respectable. 

To then prove how much he deserves the respect he demands, he flips Hannah and Marnie’s coffee table, knocking all the shit off it, steals it and stomps out of the apartment. Marnie begs him to stay because she has Stockholm syndrome and familiar suffering is more comfortable than the unknown. Marnie is still fucking pissed at Hannah and Hannah doesn’t seem to really care. 

The next day, Marnie and Hannah are eating cereal in their kitchen. Marnie is talking about her plans to win Charlie back and how Hannah caused real damage and may have ruined her and Charlie’s relationship. Hannah says she didn’t even leave her notebook out for anyone to just waltz in and read, so Charlie found it by snooping through her shit and invading her privacy which is a crime. Marnie says that’s too bad because Hannah wrote mean stuff about her and Charlie’s relationship. Oh my god dude. I’ve had so many conversations just like this. I’ve ended so many friendships over conversations just like this because the density, denial, and deflection just becomes too much for me. I’m honestly not as patient of a person as Hannah is being. Watching this scene honestly made me feel like I was getting repeatedly catheterized. 

Jessa and Hannah are both dressed like grandmas but from states on opposite coasts (Jessa Seattle /cali … Hannah Boston probably… just watch the episode you’ll see what I mean) They are talking about Hannah’s boss touching all the ladies at work, to which Jessa says she should be flattered. Jessa then says she should fuck her boss “for the story,” to which Hannah says she can’t because Adam is her boyfriend now, which is breaking news to everyone in the world including Adam probably. She said that because Adam told her to be herself that that means they’re basically together now. 

Marnie shows up at rays coffee shop looking… honestly gorgeous I love this outfit, hair, make up combo on her. Ray starts being annoying to a customer so he doesn’t have to make eye contact with Marnie after participating in ruining her life the night before. Ray tells Marnie he doesn’t like what she’s about, because she broke Charlie’s heart. Which is so crazy because I don’t remember Marnie actually doing anything to participate in this bullshit whatsoever. Ray then says he’s probably more in love with Charlie than Marnie is. 

It is then revealed that Marnie came to Rays job to ask for Charlie’s address. Which is…. I don’t know what to say about that. I don’t know what there is to be said about a long-term relationship, where one side of the couple is obviously emotionally checked out and exhausted, and the other part of that couple is invading every single aspect of their partners life, to the point of committing literal crimes against loved ones in their partners close circle… and then? Keep his own personal space completely off limits to that same partner? For YEARS? To the point she doesn’t even know where he lives? He has invaded every aspect of her life and taken complete control, but has also given himself the freedom and opportunity to scurry away and not be found or held accountable like a little rodent. It feels almost by design. 

ANYWAY, Ray seems just as shocked as I am that Marnie has never been to Charlie’s fucking apartment, so he gives her the address and then tells Marnie that he wouldn’t even hate-fuck her before she leaves. 

Hannah is at work and her boss Rich, pats her on her butt again. 

Marnie is navigating a sketchy part of the city in 6inch stilettos trying to find Charlie’s apartment. He buzzes her in and she is amazed that his apartment is so chic and organized. Charlie is wearing a cardigan over a flannel and pouting and whining about how he always told Marnie to come over to his place but she never did. She insists that he never invited her over, and he said that he definitely did, and then she says that it’s not exactly easy for her to get here from work anyway, because why not fight about something new I guess? Marnie says it doesn’t matter because he never sleeps there and he’s always at her place anyway, to which he says he will be staying there now because they are broken up. 

Jessa is at her babysitting family’s house putting make up on for a date, Jeff is giving her instructions for the night, but gets distracted by her ethereal beauty and pauses to compliment her. Jessa says she is meeting up with her ex who is in town visiting, but doesn’t know why he wants to meet up because he dumped her. Jeff seems shocked that anyone would dump Jessa, because that’s how old married guys make their move I guess. JFPAR comes in and seems to feel like she interrupted something, which Jessa notices and feels uncomfortable and promptly takes the cue to leave. 

Charlie and Marnie are sat at the breakfast booth thing in Charlie’s apartment. The apartment would actually be such a slay if it belonged to an Asian girl in undergrad and not this gross guy. Marnie and Charlie are looking down with their hands folded in front of them, like they are mourning the loss of something great, which they are not. Charlie says they are only together because of sunk cost fallacy. 

The next scene cuts to a flashback several years in the past, of Marnie and Hannah and Jessa in college at a basement party. Marnie has bangs and a little headband and she looks soooo cute and dorky and really pretty!!! Jessa is wearing rainbow suspenders and Hannah pretty much looks the same. Marnie is having a panic attack because she ate a pot brownie with a Jell-O shot on top, to which Jessa goes to find one to eat herself. Elijah enters the scene and is just as gay as when we first met him many years after this, but is dating Hannah and embraces her. Hannah tells Elijah that Marnie is having a panic attack because she ate pot brownies. A gay little song comes on at the party, to which Hannah and Elijah leave panicking Marnie alone to go dance and have fun, even tho she begs them not to because she’s so scared. Elijah grabs his friend Charlie to come watch Marnie so he and Hannah can go have fun. This is the very first time Marnie and Charlie ever meet each other. Marnie tells Charlie that she’s scared, and asks him for a hug, which he gives her and makes her feel better. He tries to invite her to see his band later, but she’s so high that she just asks him to keep hugging her. 

We cut back to the present, where Marnie and Charlie are at the table in his apartment. Charlie mentions how Marnie’s bangs that she had at the time reminded him of a girl he saw in a porn once, and he watched it that same night to see if it actually was her in the porn. Marnie is shocked to hear that Charlie watches porn. She says that instead of porn, he should just imagine the two of them having sex. Charlie says that that makes him sadder than watching porn. 

Hannah enters Rich’s office with some files he asked for. He starts giving Hannah his sandwich order for lunch, and Hannah tells him to just fuck her already. Rich looks really shocked and appalled. Hannah tells him she thought it was a gross idea at first, but now she’s down and wants to fuck him and get it over with. Rich says that he’s married and they work together, and that Hannah is speaking to him very inappropriately. Hannah says that she’s not trying to trap him and insists he act on his fantasy. Rich starts hysterically laughing, and when Hannah gets pissed off and defensive, asks what Hannah’s problem is and if she is on drugs. Hannah says that her, and her other female coworkers could sue him for touching them. Rich says that Hannah can barely make it into her 10:am shifts, so she doesn’t have the discipline or drive needed to be able to even file a lawsuit against someone. Hannah says she’s quitting for sexual reasons and she won’t sue if Rich writes her a check for $1000. Rich is laughing the entire time. He proceeds to ask her not to quit, and insists that she’s great, despite not knowing her job, and also trying to fuck him, sue him, and extort him. She tells him she’s going to write an essay about him where she won’t change his name and then he can sue her, and then she leaves. 

Back at fucking Charlie’s apartment with the moron brigade, Marnie and Charlie are arguing about whether or not they love each other. Charlie says it doesn’t matter if he loves Marnie, because he already decided Marnie is the one for him and he is committed to her. Which is interesting because he seems to REALLY need Marnie to love him and be in love with him, so good thing he doesn’t hold himself to that same expectation of giving love? Anyway he says something about how he likes how Marnie’s hair smells and that’s enough for him to not crave the thrill of fucking other women, then gets pissed and stomps off. But it’s a studio apartment so he just stomps to the other corner of the room. 

Marnie is desperate at this point for reasons unbeknownst to me, but starts begging and pleading for him to stay with her and saying she will do anything so that he won’t leave… including replying to his sister, kicking Hannah out of her apartment, moving into his apartment, giving him head. She is so desperate for him to not leave her that she starts crying, and a horrible shitty smirk spreads across Charlie’s face. Idk if you can tell by the way I’m writing about him? But I hate him so much lol. 

Jessa is walking in the park with her ex who is wearing a vest and a fedora. You truly hate to see it. He is kind of hot. I love that she’s wearing Uggs with her outfit. Anyway, her fedora ex immediately tells her that they won’t be having sex with each other, because he’s moving in with his girlfriend next month. That’s one way that this show is so real… name one dude you knew in your 20’s who wasn’t fucking trifling. Fedora ex accuses Jessa of being jealous of his new girlfriend, to which Jessa retorts that she wouldn’t be jealous of a girl whose boyfriend is flying out to meet up with his ex. Look… I know Jessa is a mess but she’s funny. Marnie and Hannah sit by and let Charlie scream at them and flip their table, only to follow up the next day and beg to suck his dick? Like at least Jessa calls gross behavior for what it is to their face. 

Anyway, fedora ex proceeds to ramble about how beautiful, interesting, and cool Jessa is despite their tumultuous relationship. Then proceeds to insist how much he loves his current girlfriend, before the scene cuts to them making out passionately in Jessas apartment. Unbeknownst to either of them, Shoshanna is home and hears them aggressively hooking up and hides so I guess she doesn’t interrupt or something. 

They throw each other on the bed and undress, and fedora ex fucks Jessa out the window from behind and cums almost instantaneously. As they get dressed, he goes to kiss her and she pulls away, insisting he loves his current girlfriend after all. Shosh laughs from her hiding spot, and Jessa accuses her of being a peeping perv. Jessa tells Shosh that what she just witnessed was an example of Jessa being unsmotable. 

Adam has goggles and a torch lighter for undisclosed reasons, when a knock at the door interrupts him. Hannah comes in, and Adam says she needs to let him know before she just shows up whenever she wants because he’s busy right now. Ignoring what he just said because she’s thinking about herself, Hannah tells Adam she just quit her job, to which Adam says he thought she already did that because he didn’t know she got a different job. Hannah starts feeling Adam up, to which he recoils from her touch and asks what she’s doing. He says that they just discussed yesterday how their situationship isn’t good for Hannah’s mental health and how they should end things, but Hannah is confused because they had sex after that. Adam says that these things usually stop when someone stops having fun, and Hannah isn’t having fun right now, so he doesn’t see why they should continue to see each other. Hannah tells Adam that she tried to fuck her boss today, but she isn’t sure if it was because she wanted to be an asshole, or if it was for the story. 

Marnie is straddling Charlie in his bed which is very close to the ceiling. She’s trying to have make up sex with him, but he keeps interrupting her to make sure she agrees to the additional terms and conditions he’s tacking onto their relationship. Like not making him feel insecure and be nice to his friends and take him seriously. Idk how anyone could be aroused in the face of such patheticness. 

Hannah starts to leave Adam’s apartment but sees him masturbating, to which she asks him if he knows that she’s still there and hasn’t left yet. He says he knows, and asks her to stay until he finishes, for the story. 

Marnie is on top of Charlie riding his dick while he insists that she can’t abandon him because it reminds him of his dad.

 I had to pause this scene for a while to decide if I’d rather watch a video of someone getting beheaded. I decided that a graphic video depicting a real violent death would probably make me feel just as bad as this particular scene does, and kept watching. But I cannot stress enough how sick to my stomach it makes me lol. 

Anyway Marnie is on top of Charlie and is shown trying to fuck him, not hit her head on his low ceiling, and carry the emotional burden he is also trying to unload onto her while she’s doing all of this. He grabs her face to kiss her and look at her face closely while he lays there unmoving, contributing nothing, and talking about the expectations he has on her in their relationship from here on out. Charlie tells her he loves her repeatedly while demanding extremely close eye contact, which Marnie realizes she is unable to say back to him. She physically recoils from him and hits her head on his low-ass ceiling, finally knocking some goddamn sense into herself. Charlie senses her sudden onset of critical thinking, and like the invader he is, attempts to pull her in close and reassure her that he is there and that she is okay. Marnie says she wants to break up, to which Charlie collapses in defeat. 

Adam is jerking off in front of Hannah. It’s gross, weird, hot, intimate, charming, funny, and comforting all at once. It’s easy to see why Hannah would fixate on someone like Adam. He’s a very interesting part of her story, regardless of the suffering he causes her. He’s into some weird sexual shit Hannah hasn’t experienced before, and he makes her feel comfortable rather than bashful to explore that part of herself with him, which differs from how bashful she feels with him emotionally!! She takes a dominant role in watching him masturbate, demanding money for a cab and snacks, and taking a $100 bill out of his drawer and making him apologize will he jerks off. Adam cums furiously when Hannah yells at him, making her feel like she has more control of their situationship than she had earlier in the episode. ",2,1768710769.0,girls,0,1.0,False

i realised the other day how hard i truly fell. i’m giddy to see him, excited as hell as i climb into his car. i can’t help but smile when he texts me and i’ve even been baking for him. today we went on a coffee date in the morning and went to (attempt) some clothes shopping (for him). he was telling me afterwards that he normally hates shopping for clothes, especially alone, but i made it more enjoyable. he said he really liked having me join him, and i made it much less anxiety inducing. he asked if i’d be down to go grocery shopping with him, just to be there with him, and i said yes.

we’ve never had the “what are we?” talk but this doesn’t feel casual to me. he told me he missed me, and honestly he has the last few times we’ve hung out as we only see each other once a week now. we hang out pretty consistently, we talk every day, and neither of us are on dating apps anymore. i’m only talking to him, i have no idea if he’s talking to anyone else. he said he didn’t match and talk to many girls on hinge even before we met.

i want him to like me, and honestly i don’t care how slowly we move, i just want to start moving in a direction. i want to rip the bandaid off and bring up the conversation but i’m so terrified of rejection, so terrified of making him uncomfortable. i don’t think he likes me for one specific reason: we don’t kiss.

we have kissed, though. it’s rare, but it happens. i don’t know if he views kissing as something too intimate as we’ve hooked up plenty of times (although not every time we hang out). maybe it’s just me but if you liked a girl, wouldn’t you want to kiss her? we cuddle, he’s affectionate other than that, but we rarely kiss.

i really like him. i just hope he likes me too.",1,1768710673.0,relationships_advice,0,1.0,False

I’m getting away from the darker roasts as my tastes change with this hobby. Not knowing any better, I only used to drink drip coffee from a Bunn, Mr. Coffee, Cuisinart, then Keurig, then Moccamaster, then Chemex pour overs, then a Jura (which I returned) V60, Breville Precision, Kalita, etc etc etc. y you get the picture. I have two fairly decent grinders-a Turin DM47 and a Baratza Virtuoso. I know there’s plenty more grinders way above mine in terms of producing great coffee. Here’s where I get confused-what am I missing with the light roasts? I went to a cupping one time and hated all of them. They were thin and tasted more like tea to me. I don’t understand the concept of looking for flavor profiles such as peach, strawberry, lemon, rose, tea, etc when drinking coffee. I really want to learn more about this, but after that cupping, I just don’t get it. I also understand that where I went could have just sucked, but I’m genuinely curious about what more I could be missing. I want to learn more about this! If you’re just going to make fun of me, that won’t be helpful for me. I’m honestly trying to learn. TIA! ",1,1768710425.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

anyways, towards the middle of 2025, management decided to lock the door to the basement w our breakers and water heaters. there’s a full on lock on the door (bc someone kicked in the door before without it), so we weren’t able to kick the power back on.

i called the emergency maintenance phone number (bc it was 15° outside) and AI answered me. i explained the situation, AI told me they had no information under my name, but then assured me that an appointment would be made. this was at 11 am. we took a nap later, woke up at 3 pm, and unsurprisingly, the power was not back on. so i called the emergency phone number again, and the AI lady told me the same thing. i made her (it?) confirm that the maintenance request was for TODAY, and AI confirmed it. it’s 10 pm and im still lighting up the room with my phone’s flashlight.

google told me that it’s not illegal in kansas to lock a breaker from tenants UNLESS they can be sure to turn the power back on in a “reasonable amount of time.” it’s been almost 12 hrs and it was fucking freezing today…

obviously, we live in shitty apartments bc of our financial status, so we can’t take legal actions against management. however, bc no one came today, i’m assuming we won’t get our power back on until monday morning, when all the office workers r back in their office after their lovely, warm weekend.

my father-in-law offered to break the lock so we could access the basement, but im scared of management taking legal action on \*us\* for trespassing.

any advice? thankfully, it looks like tomorrow is going to be warmer than today, but this is still fucking inhumane.

1qfyr8y,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qfyr8y,"A take on a Evil Race, and monsters as a whole.","So first i gotta explain how I came up with this... idea/question? This will basically be my thoughts to inspire discussion and work as a prompt.

I had a thought about Minecraft, mainly with Plilagers/that whole pale grey people, alongside the simple game mechanism of things just... spawning in, like yea its just a game mechanism sure, but when you have a device in game that just spawns them in... it implies that creatures can just pop into existence, and when they die they just... vanish into dust ig?

First part will be related to the idea of a Evil Race (a evil sentient species) and the other part will be more the general implications of creatures being able to simply manifest into reality, and developing like Pokémon evolution as this is applied video game logic?

So, here is my premise. One day, these people start appearing out of swirling smoke and ash. While they can talk, do the things people do, and generally are very much just people, when they encounter humans, they just attack. No anger, no aggression, they dont even know WHY why do it, why they kill humans... they just do. if you were to call them on the phone, conversation is just fine, no issues, but unless they train themselves otherwise... its on sight basically. 

It works for giant spiders, undead, strange floating monsters, and so on, but the fact they are in so many ways just... people, yet still do that same ""human hunting"" behavior is so fascinating. 

Especially if its a thing of they also can have kids, maybe its summoning a child, or the old fashioned way, but the fact they can just appear in a coffee shop or in the middle of nowhere is so scary.

Going more broadly to monsters, a giant spider, 20 foot tall giant, or a ghost just popping out of thin air is fascinating, because how do you defend against that? youd need rapid response teams if a fucking dragon appears in a middle school. Youd have to design public spaces to be able to be easily locked down. When all it takes is 1 zombie to create a outbreak, when a giant spiders reproduction instantly(well kinda instant, at least from conception they pop into juveniles) creates fully viable creatture that will be a adult... thats like, a fucking outbreak of giant spiders. Lets say half of them eat eachother for food to evolve like a Pokémon into adulthood, thats still a small army just appearing from one creature.

Especially when these monsters are actively hostile? Yea people are cooked, unless these are in localized or predictable spots that you can build around, or make a city have a low chance of a monster appearing... I dont know how a world would adapt around.

So... what monster type would be the worst? id say a beholder, something with that much destructive power just appearing would be horrific. For defenses... man, id build open spaces like castles or how we build US schools honestly. ",3,1768710237.0,worldbuilding,1,0.8,False

Here's what's actually happening and how to fix it.

---

## The Problem

You're deep in a session with Claude Code, making great progress. You step away for coffee. Come back and... Claude acts like you're strangers.

**Sound familiar?**

- Context wasn't cleared
- VS Code stayed open
- You just took a short break

Yet Claude has amnesia. What gives?

---

## Root Cause #1: VS Code Extension Host Memory Limit

The VS Code extension architecture has a hard memory limit (~2-3GB). It wasn't designed for persistent AI operations.

Every interaction stores context in memory:
- Files you're working on
- Conversation history
- Code changes being tracked

When you're rapidly prototyping, this builds up fast. Hit the limit → extension host terminates → Claude Code dies with it.

**The fix:**

Restart extension host before it crashes:

`Ctrl+Shift+P` → ""Developer: Restart Extension Host""

Do this when you notice ""Code Helper (Plugin)"" exceeding 2GB in Task Manager.

---

## Root Cause #2: Session File Size Limits

Claude Code stores sessions as `.jsonl` files in `~/.claude/projects/.../`

When a session's context grows too large, resuming becomes impossible. You get ""Prompt is too long"" before you can even type.

**From GitHub Issue #14472:**

> ""Sessions that grow large become permanently inaccessible. Users lose all conversation history and must start fresh.""

**The fix:**

Checkpoint regularly. After completing significant work:

> ""Let's checkpoint. Summarize what we've built before we continue.""

Use built-in commands:
- `/compact` - Reduces context size strategically
- `/clear` - Fresh start when needed
- `/context` - Debug context issues (v1.0.86+)

---

## Root Cause #3: WSL2 + Docker Memory Leak (The Big One)

If you're running Claude Code with MCP servers in Docker on WSL2, here's what's happening:

```
Claude Code → MCP servers (Docker) → Docker daemon (WSL2) 
→ Linux kernel caches aggressively → vmmem process (Windows) 
→ Memory balloons to 10GB+ → System instability 
→ Docker gets weird → Claude loses MCP connections → Session corrupts
```

**The dirty secret:** WSL2 allocates memory but doesn't release it back to Windows. The Linux kernel caches aggressively by design.

Check Task Manager → `vmmem` = WSL2's memory consumption.

### Quick Fixes:

**1. Cap WSL2 memory**

Create `%UserProfile%\.wslconfig`:

```ini
[wsl2]
memory=8GB
swap=2GB
localhostForwarding=true
```

Then: `wsl --shutdown`

**2. Docker cleanup**

```bash
# See what's eating memory
docker system df

# Nuclear cleanup
docker system prune -a --volumes
```

**3. Container memory limits**

```yaml
services:
  your-mcp:
    mem_limit: 256m
    mem_reservation: 128m
```

Container hits limit → only that container restarts, not your whole system.

---

## Root Cause #4: No Persistent Memory Between Sessions

**From GitHub Issue #14227:**

> ""Claude Code starts every session with zero context. There is no memory of previous sessions.""
>
> ""It's a goldfish.""

This is by design currently. Each session starts fresh.

**The workaround:**

Keep a `CLAUDE.md` in your project root with:
- Project context
- Architecture decisions
- What you've built so far

Claude reads this automatically at session start.

---

## The Real Solution: Move Docker Off WSL2 Entirely

Here's my actual setup right now: Claude Desktop + 6 VS Code instances running Claude Code. vmmem sits at 11.6GB and climbs to 15GB+ over a session.

The quick fixes help, but the **real fix** is getting Docker completely out of WSL2.

**The architecture that actually works:**

```
Windows (VS Code UI)
    ↓
WSL2 (LEAN - dev only)
├── Project files
├── Node.js / dev server  
├── Claude Code
├── NO Docker ❌
└── vmmem: 2-4GB ✓
    ↓ (socket/TCP)
Separate Linux box (Ubuntu PC, old laptop, mini PC, even Raspberry Pi 5)
├── Native Docker / Docker Swarm
├── All your containers
├── Memory-capped per container
├── No vmmem overhead
└── Can reboot without touching Windows
```

**Why this works:**

1. **WSL2 stays lean** - Only runs dev tools, not containers
2. **vmmem drops from 15GB to 2-4GB** - Massive difference
3. **HMR stays fast** - Project files still native in WSL
4. **Docker runs native** - No Windows/Linux memory translation overhead
5. **Blast radius contained** - Linux box acting up? Restart it. Windows keeps working.

**Hardware options for the Linux box:**
- Old laptop you have lying around
- Mini PC (Intel NUC, Beelink ~$150-200)
- Raspberry Pi 5 8GB (~$80) for lighter workloads
- Or a proper server if you're scaling

The containers connect back via socket/TCP. Claude Code in WSL talks to your MCP servers on the Linux box. Same functionality, fraction of the memory.

**My results:**

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| vmmem | 11-15GB (climbing) | 2-4GB (stable) |
| System stability | Degrades over hours | Stays clean all day |
| Container crashes | Takes down everything | Only that container restarts |

This isn't a workaround - it's the proper architecture. WSL2 was never meant to run production container fleets.

---

## Quick Reference

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Claude forgets mid-session | Restart Extension Host |
| ""Prompt too long"" on resume | Use `/compact`, checkpoint often |
| vmmem eating 10GB+ | Cap WSL2 memory, clean Docker |
| Containers crashing randomly | Add mem_limit to each container |
| Always starting from zero | Use CLAUDE.md for project context |

---

## Context Window Facts

| Plan | Context Window |
|------|----------------|
| Standard | 200K tokens |
| Enterprise (Sonnet 4) | 500K tokens |

- 1 token ≈ 0.75 words
- Each message = Claude re-reads ENTIRE conversation
- Usage resets every 5 hours

---

## Commands to Know

```bash
# Check WSL memory usage
wsl -- free -h

# Check Docker memory
docker stats

# Clean Docker
docker system prune -a --volumes

# Restart WSL
wsl --shutdown
```

VS Code:
- `Ctrl+Shift+P` → ""Developer: Restart Extension Host""
- `/compact` - Reduce context
- `/clear` - Fresh session
- `/context` - Debug context

---

This isn't a Claude problem - it's an architecture problem. The extension host, session files, and WSL2 memory management all have limits that weren't designed for persistent AI operations.

Work with those limits, not against them.

1qfyncv,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1qfyncv/small_rant_about_religious_trauma/,Small rant about religious trauma…,"I’m tired of people downplaying trauma within religion, especially LDS. Too often I see comments online with thousands of likes and replies defending the commenter that says something along the lines of “ex Mormons be like I’m so traumatized from the church 🥺 I had to sing songs about how we should love one another and pray for the sick people to get better!”

Maybe that’s their experience that they have little to no trauma (that they recognize) because the church environment declares several things to be “good” that are actually manipulative. For example, bishops having interviews with members, even young children, to discuss their sexual doings and punishments for their sins. From a young age, we are taught that sex is bad, plain and simple. Sex is almost a curse word within the church. We are taught that suppression of completely natural things is actually defeating the adversary, as if Satan controls your bodily desires. The church also demands obedience before consent, case in point your first endowment session where you agree to things not yet revealed. I’ve often heard members respond to questions about coffee and tea with “It’s a test for us to obey the prophet’s orders even when there’s no logical reasoning behind it.” REASONING IS SUPPRESSED. (Sorry for caps) if this isn’t manipulation, tell me, what is?

Some of my trauma comes from the members shaming me for not going on a mission telling me that no one will ever marry me and that “god is ashamed.”I was fully alienated from most of my family when I decided to focus on school over a mission. This is traumatic and legions of members are willing to overlook all of it. The argument of “if shaming was encouraged by the church, why isn’t there a manual for it?” Let me ask you this, do corrupt leaders ever reveal their true intentions? 

Lastly, snarky replies by members, to videos declaring the church is a cult, saying things along the lines of “hey guys, I’m one of the so called cult members here to tell you what actually goes on in the church! 😜” The members themselves are not the essence of the cult. It is the leaders controlling doctrine, retracting written works from circulation, dismissing old prophets and apostles words (they were speaking as a man), framing old doctrine to sound cleaner than it is, conditioning starting in childhood, pray for an answer (the members know the “correct” answer, so of course they land on that most of the time), the list goes on. What about the miracle of forgiveness? The book that destroyed so many members self confidence and sent them into deep depression? Why doesn’t the church endorse that book, written by a recent prophet of the church? Was it blasphemy?

Members that say “just leave quietly”, how about you don’t send people to knock on doors that are “inactive” and leave them be? You are not being Christlike like you think you are, you’re using shame and peer pressure (ironically things we were warned about constantly in the church) to obtain compliance.

Trigger warning : This might be a little emotional.

I’m 33F and I’ve dealt with chronic illness as well as crippling mental illness my entire life. I have just been dealt a bad hand at life, I guess. I mostly just accepted that and tried to push forward no matter what.

But these past few months I’ve finally gotten close to giving up. It’s getting harder as the days go on.

A little about my pain :

I first felt it about 6-7 years ago. I was working at a coffee shop, and I was in the middle of making a drink for a customer when I felt this sharp, jolting pain in my lower back and I couldn’t move any part of my lower body for about 45 seconds straight. I was literally stuck in pain. Every time I tried to move, the jolt happened again. 

It eventually went away and would come randomly at work.

I went into the nonprofit field shortly after and as far as I can remember, didn’t have that pain for quite some time.

Then I started working at a coffee shop again in the summer two years ago, and the pain came back but worse. This time, it happened when I stood for more than two hours at the coffee shop and would last the entire day. Laying in bed for the day usually refreshed the inflammation and pain. It hurt to walk and move around, but it eased up when I’d lay down.

My partner was confident it was my shoes (I was wearing vans, broken docs, etc) so I invested in ugly but supportive sneakers.

The pain didn’t go away. 

I actually went to physical therapy, she didn’t run any tests but said it was coccyx inflammation and that maybe my job is too hard on my body and we’d increase sore strength.

My insurance stopped covering the sessions after 3x, I didn’t think it was helping, and I ended up leaving the coffee job anyway. My back was fine. I went back to nonprofit.

I moved and I was out of a job again, so I picked up a temporary bartending and serving job. You’d think that’d be hard on my back- but nope. No pain other than usual soreness. Not \*the\* pain.

So now I work part time at- yeah, a coffee shop. And it’s the easiest job ever. Hardly any work to be done. Yet I’m constantly in so much pain. THE pain. But this time it’s 50x worse.

Three months ago is when the big thing happened. I was at work and I felt the jolting pain and the sharp pain and the muscle spasm type pain that I usually get at coffee shops, but I had a few hours left in my shift. Sitting down usually helps, but this time it made it so much worse. Sitting made me want to cry, and then I couldn’t get up. If I tried, it was the worst pain of my life. 

I got through the pain and took an Uber home- literally took forever to get in and out and was crying in pain in the cab.

I got into bed and then I had to use the bathroom after an hour or so, but.. I couldn’t move. Now, I know a lot of people exaggerate their pain, but when I tell you I COULD NOT MOVE, I MEAN IT. My body was stiff, stuck, in so much pain that even the slightest movement made me yelp out in pain in a way that would break your heart if you heard it. I had no choice but to call my partner to leave work (and that’s an SOS situation) to take me to the bathroom and just help me around.

He literally had to carry my heavy ass to be bathroom, help me sit, help me get up. It was humiliating.

The next day I had my mom come over and she did the same.

I didn’t have insurance to go to a hospital or a doctor, and since I’m part time I really can’t afford any kind of medical bills right now.  I took some strong painkillers I had from a previous injury, a heating pad, I had a cane and I stayed in bed for about a week.

Slowly, I started being able to walk again. The whole thing lasted about 10 days.

Easily the worst pain in my life, and the scariest. I genuinely didn’t know if I would ever be okay again.

But I was, thank God.

However, since then, EVERY weekend when I work my shift, I start to get that pain again. It’s hard to sit and walk, it’s hard to bend, everything hurts badly. I know to go home and get straight into bed now and rest, but I just can’t do this anymore.

It hurts to walk anywhere for too long, it hurts to paint, it hurts to exercise. Everything hurts. And it’s not just soreness, it’s really a crippling chronic pain that leaves me feeling ready to give up. 

I now have insurance and went to my PCP about this as well as urgent care. They have no answers for me. However, the PCP is sending me to a rheumatologist since I tested positive on the ANA and she thinks maybe it might have something to do with that, but she’s not convinced. She said pain isn’t usually a symptom for the one that makes sense for me.

I’ve gotten all the pain blood tests. My body showed active inflammation, but that’s about it.

On Monday, I plan on maybe scheduling with an orthopedic surgery doctor? I just don’t know if they’d take me seriously. Their specialty being orthopedic surgery- are they only going to want to see me if I need surgery? 

I feel like since I’m a healthy, happy looking 33 year old with no physical signs of suffering , they just won’t take me seriously. 

This pain has taken over my life.

I’m finally in the most amazing relationship on my life, we plan on getting married next year, we just got our dream apartment, we’re talking about kids- but I can’t help but feel like it’s going to be all taken away by this pain.

Yes, he’s an amazing man and he would stay by me through it all, but I wouldn’t let him. He’s young and healthy and amazing, and I wouldn’t ever want to subject him to a life of having to take care of his wife. 

Any advice, any ideas on what this pain could be. Any words of encouragement, anything at all.

Well, I’m back. I’m not sure how I feel after today’s discoveries. I will say that disturbed is the best word for it. I don’t know if I want to continue searching for answers about my grandmother’s house. Piece after piece has laid forth the ground for something truly haunting… something that I’m not sure I’m ready to face. As I recount the events of today, please know that Juniper Bed and Breakfast in Mississippi is not what it seems. Don’t come here. Please, stay out of Juniper.

On the way to city hall, Phillip stopped at the coffee shop and got us two sandwiches. He ate his in two bites like a ravenous beast. I offered him the other half of mine, and he happily accepted it. I had lost my appetite since my grandmother died. Food felt like stones in my stomach, swirling and stirring like congealed fleshy soup in my abdomen. It just wasn’t satisfying anymore, and it didn’t numb the grief that I felt. Too much had happened in such a little amount of time for me to even think about food.  

After eating in the parking lot, Phillip and I drove to city hall to retrieve the records that he requested. We were both already feeling better after leaving my grandmother’s house. It felt intolerable to be there, and I felt guilty for allowing Phillip to help. I should have turned down his kind offer. It would have saved him from getting dragged into my family’s garbage… literally.

Once we parked outside of city hall, we both got out. I sat down on the metal bench by the entrance to wait for him. I wanted some fresh air, and I didn’t want to stay cooped up in the car. The stench of the house was permeated into my clothes, like a thick fog of foulness. The musty air in the rotting bed and breakfast is certainly not a scent that one would appreciate in the form of a decorative candle, so I doubt that my pungent odor is tolerable to anyone right now. I contemplated spraying some of my perfume on me before we left, but I decided that it is better to smell like plain shit than citrus… and shit. I hoped that some fresh air would carry it away as I sat on the bench and enjoyed the afternoon sunshine.

Phillip strode out of city hall, holding tightly to a medium sized cardboard box. His face was knit together in contemplation, and I stood up to help him. He shook his head and tucked the cardboard box into the back seat.

“What happened?” I asked as we got back into the car.

He scoffed. “The woman at the front desk told me that I smelled like wet garbage.”

I stifled a laugh. “What else happened?”

“She didn’t give me any trouble. She asked why I was curious about the old Juniper Bed and Breakfast, and I told her that I wanted to learn more about the town. I told her to look up Juniper County Bank next, and I’d be back to pick it up next week.”

“Mh… that’s smart,” I replied quietly. “Do you want to go back to the Bed and Breakfast? I figured that we’d go back to your house to look through this stuff.”

“You just don’t want to go back, do you?” he asked, awaiting my answer impatiently.

“Not really…” I confessed. “You saw what she wrote in that diary. Something evil is there, Phillip. She said that it didn’t like me. I think that we need to let it go. I’ll leave, and no one has to know. Someone else can feed the house or whatever that means. That house is not my problem.”

“You’re wrong,” Phillip said. “It is your problem. It belongs to you now. Besides, I don’t think that you can just leave. I think that someone from this wretched town will come look for you and drag you right back. You saw how Mr. Havers acted. There is bound to be more nutcases like him.”

“Did you not hear a word that I said? Something dangerous is inside of that house, Phillip.”

“But what if we have the chance to stop it?” Phillip asked. “What if *you* have the chance to stop it? I think that you need to find out the truth, or this house will haunt you for the rest of your life. I can drop everything right now, and I can go back to not caring about the oddness about Juniper. But you... I don’t think that you’ll be able to do that. I think that when you find out the truth, you’ll know what to do. I think that you’ll know exactly what to do.”

I looked down at my hands, knowing that he was right. I couldn’t hide from the house anymore. I couldn’t let it linger in my mind like a rotting corpse. I had to bury it. I couldn’t be cowardly anymore. I needed to face my monster and discover whatever horrible truth is hidden within the floorboards. I need to know why I saw the bludgeoned man. I need to know why I have to feed the house… I needed to know the truth about Juniper Bed and Breakfast.

I finally looked up at Phillip. “Did they train you to do that? Guilt me to death?”

“No,” Phillip said, cranking up the car. “That was purely me… telling you the truth.”

He drove quickly to his house, and we walked to the front door together. He handed me the box and unlocked the door. We walked inside, grateful to smell vanilla and lavender rather than decay and mildew.

“Where is Christy?” I asked.

“She’s at the charity auction for school fundraising. They need a new playground.”

“Oh,” I said, sitting down the box on the kitchen table. “Why didn’t you go?”

He chuckled to himself. “I don’t have any money to spend, and I didn’t really want to.”

“So… you would rather dig through my grandmother’s junk house?” I asked condescendingly.

“Absolutely,” he replied quickly. “Without question.”

I laughed to myself and began pulling out files on the house. Most of it was tax documents, property assessments, business licenses, and some zoning permits. I didn’t really understand what all I was looking at. I didn’t know what city hall would have, but it definitely wasn’t anything worthwhile to me. I handed most of the paperwork to Phillip. He seemed to understand it. When I passed him an aged manilla folder, a piece of paper slid out. I picked it up curiously, realizing that it looked different than the other pieces of paper.

“What is that?” Phillip asked.

I stared down at the piece of paper. “It is a copy of a check. Look,” I said, handing it to him.

Phillip sighed. “Look who it is made out to. Damn,” he said, shaking his head.

It was made out to none other than Mr. Havers. I frowned, staring down at the piece of paper. “What was Juniper Bed and Breakfast buying from Mr. Havers?” I asked Phillip.

Phillip got up, and he walked to the kitchen counter where a basket of mail lay. He tossed the newspaper to me. Plastered on the front was an advertisement for Havers Land Acquisition and Development. “He helped your grandmother purchase some land it seems.”

“But… why would she need more land? There is plenty around the house,” I said, feeling an anxious bubble rising upwards in my stomach.

Phillip sighed in annoyance. “I guess that we need to go ask him ourselves then, don’t we?”

I took a deep breath, knowing that Phillip was right. Neither of us really wanted to go see Mr. Havers. We wanted to find more answers in the records from city hall. We wanted to avoid looking at his pinched face and wrinkled forehead, but we were not so lucky. Deep down, I knew that I would eventually have to speak to him, and my guts anxiously twisted at the thought. I didn’t want to talk to him, but if it meant that I might find answers about the house, maybe it is worth the trouble.

We continued to sort through the box, not finding anything of true use.

“Come on,” I said, after we sifted through the last few papers. “We’ve been at this for two hours, and we haven’t found anything. I think that we need to accept the inevitable. I’ve gotta go talk to him whether I like it or not.”

Phillip looked so nervous that he might vomit. His face turned a lighter shade of white, and he finally replied, “Okay, but I think that there is something you should know about him.”

“What?” I asked.

“He- he… Well… Christy told me last night that Mr. Havers used to date your mom.”

“That old and hateful man used to date my mother?” I asked in disgust.

“Yeah. That is why your parent’s divorced before your dad died. They were having an affair, Carrie.”

I sat back into my chair, fingers scraping against the wooden seat as I tried to comprehend what Phillip had told me. “That is why he was a regular at the bed and breakfast,” I whispered, allowing reality to set in.

I felt sick to my stomach. The sandwich I had eaten earlier felt like it might make a reappearance with some bile and stomach acid. “I was too young to notice,” I said quietly. “My mom left when I was about five. A year later, my dad died. I don’t even remember his face… My grandmother threw away all the pictures of him after he died. After that, all I had was my grandmother, and I didn’t see my mother again until my thirteenth birthday. She was skinny, and she didn’t look like herself.”

“Why did she come back?” Phillip asked.

“I don’t know,” I replied, shaking my head. “Probably to ask for money. I just know that she fought with my grandmother, and she left. I haven’t seen her in twelve years. No one has. I think she’s probably dead.”

“Don’t say that,” Phillip said.

“Most people who go missing that were druggies… they’re gone for good. You and I both know that,” I said, crossing my arms. “But it doesn’t matter. We still need to go talk to him. Do you know where he lives?”

“I do,” Phillip replied reluctantly.

He grabbed his car keys, and we got back on the road again. Mr. Havers lives a good thirty minutes out of town. It gave me enough time to mentally prepare, and it also gave me the good kick in the ass that I needed to summon whatever courage I had. I had resuscitated people in the ICU. I had packed gory wounds that would make most people pass out. I had cleaned up some of the most vile and putrid liquids that the human body can produce, but facing this man felt worse.

When we pulled into his driveway, my heart fell into my butt. I swallowed hard, feeling my throat tighten.

“You can do this,” Phillip said. “I’ll be right here. I’m not going to leave without you.”

I nodded, and I got out of the car. I walked to the front door, legs shaking like I was walking into the principal’s office in high school all over again. I walked up the steps and rang the doorbell. A long and low howl echo from somewhere within.

“Brutus!” I heard Mr. Havers yell. “Get back in your bed.”

Mr. Havers walked to the front door, and he stared at me in shock. “Carrie? What brings you all the way out here?”

My mouth went dry, but I forced out a reply. “I want to know about this. I handed him the copy of his check.”

“Mh,” he said, holding the paper tightly in his hands.

“Come inside,” he said lowly. He looked out at Phillip’s car. “That man with you?” he asked.

I angled myself in front of him, so he wouldn’t be able to see the car anymore. “No,” I replied quickly. I didn’t want him to recognize Phillip. “He’s just my driver.”

I followed Mr. Havers into the house, noticing that he had developed a limp. The house smelled like the sharp scent of cigar smoke and pine. There were pictures covering the walls, and the hardwood floors shined like stars, freshly polished to perfection. His furniture was a dark brown leather with clawed feet. His TV was mounted over a large fireplace, and mounted animals decorated the remaining walls.

I audibly gasped as we turned the corner to see a large bear. It was positioned on its hind legs, standing at its full height. One clawed paw stretched towards us in death, perhaps warning me to turn back.  

Mr. Havers chuckled as he led me into his study. “Killed him nearly twenty years ago. Nasty thing. Took four bullets until he finally went down.”

“You have a beautiful home,” I said quietly, not wanting to know anything more about the poor bear.

“I had it decorated by my niece. She’s got a good eye.” He sat down in his desk chair in his study, wincing as he moved his foot.

“What happened to your foot?” I asked, sitting down in the chair opposite of him.

“Gout flared up,” he replied, annoyed that I had even asked.

I looked on his desk, and I felt my eyes widen like two rounded stones. I steadied myself to remain calm. It was a picture of the bludgeoned man. He was holding up a large bass with Mr. Havers and several other men beside him. “Who is that man?” I asked, handing the picture to Mr. Havers.

Mr. Havers grabbed the picture, putting it closer to his face to see better. “That is your daddy, Carrie. Don’t you recognize him?”

I felt like I was going to collapse right there on the floor and die in front of Mr. Havers. I hardly remembered my dad. He was just a name now. My grandmother got rid of the pictures of him, so I only had forgotten memories of him hugging me and putting me to bed. Everything else was gone. I didn’t even remember his voice anymore.

I shook my head and took the picture. “Not him. That man right there.” I pointed to another random man, not wanting him to know that I actually had forgotten my dad’s face. I had forgotten the color of his hair. I had lost him somewhere in the chasm of my mind, or maybe I had blocked out his memory. Maybe I had locked him out of my memories, not wanting to recall his death. My heart hammered into my chest like a drum, echoing the horrible sound of the life I’d tucked away and left behind.

*How could someone forget their dad?*

But I was so young, and I hadn’t seen him in so long. Maybe I was being too hard on myself.

Mr. Havers proceeded to tell me a story about the man I pointed to, chuckling as he recounted his fond memories of him. I didn’t listen at all. My mind was reeling. My poor dad’s spirit was trapped in that house, and I had run from him. I couldn’t believe it. Phillip was right. The bludgeoned man was trying to warn me. My dad… was trying to warn me.

Mr. Havers cleared his throat and drew me back to my present situation. “Anyway, he’s gone now, but I’m glad you asked about him. Now what do you want to know about the check.”

“Why did my grandmother buy land from you?” I asked.

“Straight to the point. I liked that about your mother too.” He pulled a cigar out of his desk and lit it. Smoke trailed out of his nose. “Well, your grandmother needed more land for her gardening.”

“Her gardening?” I asked in confusion. “She had plenty of land to garden.”

“You don’t understand,” he replied with a chuckle. “The house needed more.”

I stared at him, trying decide if he was being serious. “The house needed more? What does that even mean?” I asked, growing irritated.

He smirked at me. “You have to feed the house, and the house needed more room to grow. Your grandmother asked, so I sold it to her. It was my land anyway. It didn’t matter. The house needed blood, and without the blood, it will die. I was only doing my duty as head of the Havers family.”

My eyebrows knit together, forming a confused expression that even Mr. Havers could notice.

“She didn’t have time to tell you the truth about the house, did she?” Mr. Havers asked, puffing on his cigar again.

“No,” I said quietly. “And since I’ve decided to refurbish the house and run it as a bed and breakfast again, I figured that I should know the truth. Will you tell me?”

He clapped his hands together joyfully. “I’ll have to let the mayor now that you’ve made your decision. You won’t regret it. That house is a jewel in Juniper.” He smiled and patted my hand. “Now about the house.”

I slowly pulled my hand away from his, not wanting to be touched by him. It didn’t matter anyway. He didn’t notice. He was too overjoyed by my false confession.

“That house was the first house built in Juniper. It served many purposes. It once housed the sick. It once operated as an orphanage, and for the remainder of its life it served as a Bed and Breakfast. People came from all over to see that house and the incredible gardens. It was the man that first fed the house that discovered its power. You see he was a doctor. He used the basement to perform surgeries and amputations if needed. That drain… their blood fed the house. He noticed that after particularly bloody surgeries, where the patient often died, the gardens looked greener and the house looked better. He discovered that the house needed to be fed… blood.”

My body was frozen in terror. The fear leached out of me and transformed into something worse. It crystalized and turned into horror, and yet, Mr. Havers continued to speak.

 “You see, Juniper thrived when the house was fed. The streets became busier. The town began to bloom. The house needed a blood payment to keep the town alive. When your grandmother started to go down, the town did too. You saw the closed mall. You saw how horrible the house looked. We need you to feed the house. We need you to let blood leak through the pipes. Only one or two every few years. That should do it. But if you don’t, the town will die. This has been happening for many… many years, Carrie. You must keep up the tradition. You know, it’ll need to be fed soon. Maybe you could bring someone over, and do it quick. Cliftons have always done it the best. You’ll learn the best ways to get the job done.”

I nodded, pretending like I was a dutiful school girl. “Thank you, Mr. Havers,” I said, trying to maintain my composure and keep up my farce. “Does the house prefer anyone in particular?” I asked, crossing my hands in front of me to keep them from shaking.

He laughed. “I don’t think so. Your grandmother always picked tourists. An investigator came snooping around once, but they didn’t get far. Your grandmother could charm anyone. You’ll figure it out one day. I’m sure that Juniper Bed and Breakfast will thrive under your care. You are pretty and young, and with your medical experience, I’m sure that you’ll make it quick for the poor souls that are chosen. Men will probably throw themselves at the door for you.” He winked. “Now get on back home. I don’t want your driver to charge you for waiting.”

I stood up nervously, forcing my legs to straighten like they were controlled by strings. He hobbled up from his chair, but he sat back down. “You can let yourself out, can’t you? I need to wait a bit longer because the gout is bothering me right now. You go on. Don’t worry about the dog. He doesn’t bite.”

I walked out of his study, pacing my steps, so it didn’t sound like I was scared. I opened the door calmly, and I stepped out of the door. I closed the door and held onto the knob, unable to let go. I snapped myself back to reality, and I let go. I rushed down the steps, and I practically threw open the car door. Phillip had clearly been asleep because he nearly jumped out of his skin.

“Drive…” I said to Phillip. “Drive back to my grandmother’s house.”

He nodded without argument. Maybe it was the tone of my voice, but he somehow knew that what I had discovered was beyond anything we could have imagined. He didn’t say a word to me as we drove back. I think that my demeanor told him enough, but I didn’t want to talk either. I was angry… shocked… and horrified by what I had learned. I didn’t even have the words to tell Phillip.

When we pulled into the driveway of my grandmother’s house, Phillip was barely able to park the car before I opened the door. I strode into the house, and I threw open the front door.

“Carrie! Wait!” Phillip yelled, chasing after me.

I threw back piles and piles of garbage, boxes, and silk flowers until I stared at the door to the basement. Phillip gazed at the door, and his expression grew fearful.

“What is down there, Carrie?” he asked, grabbing my arm before I could open the door.

“I don’t know,” I said, yanking my arm away. “I don’t know because I’ve never been down there. My grandmother told me to never go into the basement! She told me that if I ever went into the basement, she’d whip me until I bled. She meant every word she ever spoke to me, so I NEVER went into the basement.”

I turned the doorknob to the basement, but it was locked. Rage billowed up from within me like a tidal wave, crashing into my chest and filling up my lungs with fire. Phillip calmly moved me to the side, and he pulled on the door. It had obvious signs of rot, stained from water damage and peeling paint.

“I can get you in, but you need to tell me why, Carrie,” Phillip said. “Why should I open this door? Am I letting something out? Are answers though this door?”

I took a deep breath. “I need to see it for myself before I tell you anything, but I promise that we aren’t letting anything out.”

“That suffices for now.” He rammed his shoulder into the door four times, and the door finally gave way.

A rancid smell wafted into our noses, making my entire body shrivel and cringe.

Phillip covered his nose and mouth. “That’s putrid,” he mumbled between his fingers.

To my surprise, the steps leading into the basement were surprisingly clean. There were no boxes standing in our way. No silk flowers piled to the ceiling. It was a clear path right down to the bottom. Phillip and I exchanged a nervous glance.

“After you,” Phillip said, pulling a flashlight out of one of his many pockets.

I took a deep breath, and I walked down the first few steps. Phillip followed closely behind me, holding up his flashlight to light our path. One step broke under my weight, and Phillip caught me. “Thanks,” I muttered.

We both continued downwards. When we reached the bottom, I nearly vomited. A gag swelled up my throat, and I began to dry heave. Dead animals lay in a various state of decay. There were rats, mice, and squirrels. Maggots slithered and writhed over their bodies, rolling in the decay and thriving within. Flies zipped around the room, knocking into the only window in the basement and escaping through a small crack. Phillip walked to the window and opened it slightly, allowing some fresh air to drain away the rotten smell. He shoved some of the thorns back that had wired themselves over the window, and he slowly beat it back enough that the window could be fully opened. Now I knew why the smell never left no matter how much I cleaned. It was quite literally rising through the floorboards.

But in the middle of the fur, skin, and bones, there lay a grimy brown drain, caked in dried blood. Tears slipped down my cheeks. She was feeding the house in the only way that she could. She was using the house to lure in prey… the woodland friends…

“She was feeding the house,” I said through sobs. I turned to Phillip. “The people in this town believe that you have to pay in blood to grow the town. They killed people down here and drained them. My grandmother was a murder. Her father was a murder. They are all murders.” I shook my head in disgust.

Phillip nervously approached me. “You didn’t bring me down here to… to kill me, did you?”

I laughed, knowing that it was his only way to make me feel better. “No,” I said through laughs. “I think I’d find a better way.”

Phillip moved some of the dead animals out of his way and found a supply closet. He opened it to find red containers of gasoline. “What was this used for?” he asked, glancing back at me. “They are full.”

“Probably to burn the bodies of the poor people that they killed.” I wiped the tears off of my face with my sleeve, and I looked back at Phillip. “Let’s get out of here. I can’t stay here one more second.”

We trudged back up the stairs. We closed the door behind us, allowing nature to take the poor rotting creatures. There was too many to deal with right now.

“Would you like to stay at my house again?” Phillip asked. “I’m sure that Christy would understand. Besides, I don’t really want to leave you here.”

I shook my head. “I think that I’ll take my chances with the bludgeoned man. I don’t think that he can hurt me, but I also don’t want your girlfriend to hurt you. You two need a night alone.”

“I can come back tomorrow and help you get rid of those animals. I only have a half shift tomorrow,” Phillip said.

I smiled at him. “Don’t worry about it, okay. I’ll let you know if I need anything.”

Phillip looked around the house and finally back at me. “So now that you know the truth, what are you going to do? I don’t think that we can report this to the police. The police chief is the head of his founding family, so I’ll take a wise guess that he already knows and doesn’t care. I’m sure that the police here have been covering it up for years. That explains why they treated me so weird when I came back. They were scared to let me in on the big secret. Juniper Bed and Breakfast is a murder house.”

“I don’t know,” I replied quietly, crossing my arms over my chest. “I need to think about it. I haven’t quite digested it yet, you know… But you need to get home.”

I walked Phillip to the front door, and I waved as he got into his car and drove away. I stood in the doorway for a long time, wishing that I had gone with him, but I didn’t need his pity. I finally walked back inside and sat down on the couch for several minutes. I tried to sort through my thoughts, compiling everything that I knew into one massive filing cabinet. Eventually, the second chest sauntered through my thoughts. I made up my mind and decided to open it.

I ran into the kitchen and began opening every single drawer like a lunatic. When I was little, my grandmother used to keep a full keyring in her pocket. She always told me that if something was locked to leave it alone, so I had always followed her rule. Each night she would place that keyring into one of these drawers. Perhaps if I find that keyring, I’ll find the key for the chest. I emptied drawers onto the floor, scattering silverware and various utensils across it. When I finally got to the last drawer, it had exactly what I was looking for. The keyring was covered in used napkins and laying right beside a mouse nest. I plucked the keyring out and ran up the stairs to the master suite. I hurried to the chest and began trying all of the keys. The twelfth key fit the lock, and it clicked open.

“Gotcha,” I said with a smirk. I opened the lid and fell back. I screamed and quickly covered my mouth.

A withered body lay inside. It was crammed inside in a fetal position. Her skin looked like grey, wrinkled paper, and her mouth was a gaping hole where a tongue should be. Her lips were gone, allowing her detached jaw to hang loosely from its socket. Nearly all of her teeth were intact, but one on the top was missing. Her clothes were stained with brown around an obvious bullet hole, and her skull looked crushed from the top of the chest.

My hands shook as I leaned closer. Her shirt looked familiar, and one of her arms was flopped over her chest, crossed in death like she was asleep. Grasped in the other crumpled hand was the missing pages of the diary. They were stained a horrible umber color, but it was unmistakably them. One pink acrylic fingernail lay on her shirt. Around her neck was a gold necklace.

I scrounged around on the floor until I found a pencil, and I used it to lift up the necklace. It was a little gold horseshoe with *mom* engraved on the bottom. I stumbled back and dropped the pencil. That was the necklace I had given my mom before she left me. She happily recalled the sweet memory of me giving it to her when she arrived at my thirteenth birthday party. In fact, the corpse was wearing the same shirt that she was.

I slammed the chest shut and threw up. It was my mother’s body in the chest. My mother had been with me all along. She wasn’t missing. She too had been murdered, claimed by the house. Her blood probably fed the damn house too.

I made my way downstairs, and I didn’t move for the rest of the night. I wish that I could tell you more right now, but I’m still trying to calm down. I’ll let you know any updates tomorrow. And as a reminder, stay away from Juniper Bed and Breakfast. It is dangerous here.

1qfyff2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qfyff2,Orb Weaver at Sunset,"Years ago, mum got some flowers as a thankyou present, but had no idea they came with a little bonus (or a few 100). Next day baby spiders had ballooned up to the ceiling and scattered everywhere inside. Naturally, we had to remove them from inside and after months went by, we forgot all about them. That was until we had coffee one morning on the balcony. I spotted a spider I had never seen before. Her web was setup with such confidence, out in the open between the stakes of two chilli plants. I remember thinking how regal she looked, perched in the centre of her web that glistened golden in the sun.

I was so intrigued that every day I would go outside to check. I'd count the bees she had expertly caught from Dad's beehives (much to his dismay). On rainy days, I'd attempt to find which leaves she was sheltering under. Eventually I had even noticed a tiny male spider, which made me hopeful that eggs were somewhere. Though my searches were unsuccessful, I kept hope that I would find some so I could continue seeing these spiders for years to come.

After a few weeks, I started to notice her slowing down and rarely moving. I began to worry that it was too hot or windy, hoping conditions would ease so she could feel more like herself. Until one morning, I walked out on the balcony as I had done so for months. Except this time the web that was once so filled with life, was empty. It may have only been a spider that I observed for a few months, but I was sad that she was gone. I didn't go out on the balcony as often anymore. Each time I did I would always look toward her web, hoping I'd see her there.

As time passed her web fell too and with it all evidence of her presence was gone. Until one day when I was picking chillies, I happened across a spider egg sac tucked between a small gap in the wood of the balcony. The same egg sac I had once hoped to find. Since then, generations of these orb weavers have lived at my parents house and for years we have been lucky to see their gorgeous webs decorating the balcony.",3,1768709274.0,AustralianSpiders,0,1.0,False

And then I spend hours/day/meds trying to get it out because it is so very uncomfortable??

I wasn’t sure where people feel their constipation… I mean, sometimes I feel it in my mid abdomen, but mostly it ends up, pun intended, in my rectal area. I always eventually get it moving eventually but it just keeps happening. No rectocele but perhaps PF tension?

I’m probably a candidate for anal-rectal manometry and sorry if I already posted about this. Ugh. Hate it. 

Today I drank coffee, miralax, magnesium (not citrate, that really gets things going, maybe too much?), vitamin c… all helped but still stuff in there because it’s never ending. ",2,1768709157.0,Constipation,0,1.0,False
1qfydpt,https://www.reddit.com/r/TankieTheDeprogram/comments/1qfydpt/liberal_hedging_remember_renee_and_the_power_of/,"Liberal Hedging, Remember Renee and the Power of True Names","I was having my morning coffee last Wednesday when I saw a disturbing news video. An unarmed woman had been shot and killed by a state officer while reversing away in her Honda SUV. This all happened in a country very far away from me, a country with very strange customs. All its citizens were allowed to carry guns to fight against tyranny. But no one ever used them. Instead, they were debating fiercely over whether the woman was reversing in the direction of the officer when he shot her. The officer was afraid, someone said. His life was in danger, that's why he shot her 3 times! But no, someone else would argue. She was only able to reverse at 4 miles per hour at max, let me plug this into my LLM and analyse...

This is liberal hedging. When you turn a physical atrocity into an intellectual debate. It's when you ask did the black guy fleeing the USian cop have a criminal record? Did Palestine purposely place human shields at strategic targets when the Israelis bombed them? Was Maduro a bad leader when the USians abducted him? Was the Luigi government ineffective before Mussolini and his Blackshirts seized power?

Liberal hedging is a refusal to take sides. Partly because of a fear of being wrong, and insecurity. By constantly qualifying and clarifying (what if the cop who killed a child was fearful that he was reaching?), the liberal inexorably drifts towards the centrist position. They pile heaps of arguments and justifications to avoid drawing an ethical line.

What these arguments have in common is that they all shift the scrutiny from the oppressor to the victim. The material facts are these: Leopold II killed 10 million Congolese. The liberal sympathises: it's a *civilising* mission. We're building *infrastructure* for the Africans. We're *superior*. In the liberal's moment of hedging and inaction, 10 million Congolese are killed. What about last week? A woman is shot dead by a state officer in the imperial core and the debate is mainly about how fast she was reversing away from him. The material facts are these: the officer shot the gun, he killed her with state impunity.

Perhaps modern examples are too triggering for a liberal. Let's make an example from a long time ago, from a galaxy far far away. Let's imagine you're a veteran from a country that just lost a war. National humiliation, loss of territory, the government installs full austerity measures. So you start a national campaign to industrialise. You smash worker unions (they make people lazy) and unite your disparaged people by telling them they're the master race. By the grace of God, they believe you. In a decade your country becomes a superpower, regains it's territory and then some, and also 6 million people die. Because the master race presupposes slave races.

But wasn't there a good cause for it? Didn't the army from the country to the East commit countless atrocities... Surely there must have been a reason, a justified reason to kill 6 million people! Cries the liberal. He did improve the lives of his people, didn't he?

Even when confronted with 6 million souls, the liberal cannot bring themself to condemn the murderer. After countless hours of agonising research the liberal reaches the same conclusion they always reach: both sides are in the wrong.

Or even worse, the liberal wonders, why should I care? I can't do anything about it. Yet every revolution began first with learning the language to describe the oppression. Before Lenin and Fanon colonising was *civilising*, bringing *civilisation* to lesser races. Without the language to describe the oppression, nobody can take material action. This is what Miranda Fricker calls hermeneutical injustice.

>the primary harm of hermeneutical injustice consists in a situated hermeneutical inequality: the concrete situation is such that the subject is rendered unable to make communicatively intelligible something which it is particularly in his or her interests to be able to render intelligible. This reveals another deep connection with the wrong of testimonial injustice. The primary harm of (the central case of) testimonial injustice concerns exclusion from the pooling of knowledge owing to identity prejudice on the part of the hearer \[. . .\] The wrongs involved in the two sorts of epistemic injustice, then, have a common epistemic significance running through them—prejudicial exclusion from participation in the spread of knowledge  
(Fricker 162)

Hence the first step is to learn the language of oppression. When a state officer kills a civilian, that is called **state violence**. The state officer is called a **Repressive State Apparatus**. When Israel bombs civilians to clear land for terra nullis it's called **genocide**, their founding is called **settler colonialism**.

\*

The greatest lie is that refusing to pick sides is sitting on the fence. The mental and physical inertia only aids the oppressor. While the liberal grapples with the veracity of reports of Israeli babies being beheaded in Palestine, Israeli bombs 80,000 Palestinians to death.

The materialist perspective asks the questions: Why is a cop allowed to kill an unarmed civilian out of fear (if they are fearful, perhaps they should choose a different profession, like gardening). Why does the Liberal International Order get to murder Arabs with impunity and abduct presidents?

We analyse not the angle of the reverse or circumstances under which the Belgians cut off African hands or whether Mussolini and Hitler's governments were economically efficient. We start from the material circumstances and work backwards, addressing things by their proper names, for names have power: capitalism, imperialism, fascism, colonialism, genocide, state violence, monopoly, crime.

1qfydgw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1qfydgw/crushed_confidence_due_to_ghostingrejection/,Crushed confidence due to ghosting/rejection,"I'll try to keep this short but I have to scream it into the void to feel a little better.

3 weeks ago a girl (23F) approaches me (25M) at a party, I get her instagram. Can't hang out since she was at home with family (different city), but we spend the following 2 weeks constantly texting, often hours and hours on end. Clearly and very directly flirting and not friendly.

She finally comes back to town and we hang out immediately the next day, a day before my trip with friends. Just few hours before hanging out we still text and flirt. We meet up and it was quite okay. It was the our first time hanging out so just talking over coffee. Talking constantly, no anxiousness or uncomfortableness, no looking at phones. Hang out for about 3 hours, she teased me for being slightly late and said that she can be late the next time (since she's usually always late) and says that she'll text me about something we talked about previously. We hug and say goodbye.

Next thing I know she blocks me on instagram. No message or anything. I text her number and simply ask if she blocked me, expecting to be blocked there as well but thought might as well nicely ask. She replies the next day saying that she had fun but thought it was just friendly and didn't want to waste my time, that she was wrong for blocking me but that it was hard for her and she felt like that was the easiest solution, but that I deserved an explanation, and that she feels like staying friends and in touch would make things worse. I say that it's okay and that I was really worried that I did something horribly wrong to her, to which she said I didn't at all. I say I'm sad she thinks we can't even be friendly since I thought she was a cool person and enjoyed talking to me, she says that she feels the same and also enjoyed talking to me but that she thinks it would make things harder. I wish her the best and tell her that I won't text her but if she ever wanted to have a friendly catch up she can text me.

Not only do I miss talking to her a lot, we had a lot in common, I also still have no idea what could've happened during those 3 hours. There were no signs that she would switch up so fast. Noone seemed bored, we were laughing and having fun...

Might be the physical aspect, but she approached me fully sober, I don't look any different now 3 weeks later than back then... There were also some selfied exchanged during our texting and there was never a negative reaction...

I can't get it out of my head and I'm struggling. It's my first time going through something like this. I've obviously had these sort of relationships slowly be redirected to friendships, I've been told ""we could be just friends"", but I've never been so cut off after a single 3 hour hang out that went as well as it could considering it was the first and after 2 weeks of constant texting and flirting for hours every day. I have no clue what could've happened and I feel like an absolute pile of shit.

I wouldn't call myself generally insecure, but I never thought highly of myself looks-wise. My best friends are constantly bullying me about everything, haircut, beard/no beard, how I dress, basically everything physical. I don't get that offended or insecure about it and I get it's kinda guys being guys (even though it gets annoying being the only one picked on so much), but this happening really made it so much worse, even though the ghosting might not have been related to how I look...

If anyone read this, thank you, it means a lot. I'm on a trip with friends and instead of having the best of times, I'm awake at 5am writing this since I can't sleep, and I appreciate anyone taking the time to read it. I feel a bit of weight leave me after writing this so I might be able to fall asleep now... Thank you all and I hope you had a better start of the year than me!",4,1768709121.0,Vent,6,0.83,False

We bought it years ago after hearing a rumour that there might be a shopping centre built in that area. 

  
I spent a year renovating it, which was incredibly stressful, and tenants moved in and operated a successful restaurant. They are moving out at the end of this month. 

  
We are trying to decide whether to sell it, rent it again or open a small business. Renting it to new tenants poses its own challenges and risks which can be mitigated with insurance policies. We know that we would not allow another restaurant as its too much risk with accidental fires. 

  
Its in a unique position right opposite Central F. When cars depart the shopping centre they see our building. 

  
We dont have restaurant experience. I thought maybe a coffee shop. Theres a Starbucks at the central F right opposite our building across the road. So maybe its not a good idea. I thought maybe buying an Amazon franchise but their terms are expensive. I dont fancy giving them 3% of monthly earnings for doing nothing. 

  
We already run a medical business in a different location of the same city and know about the hastles of having staff and all the rest re running a small business. 

  
Its a hard decision to make. Tempted to sell and take profits on this one. If you have any ideas please share your thoughts

Preface

I’m 29M AA and started dating 29F AA on 11/9/25. We had mutual friends and had been texting on/off since June 2025 but kept missing each other, I’m pretty laid back so I shrugged it off. 

Month 1

We met for the first date for coffee and we instantly hit it off, both healthcare professionals, went to school in the same general area. We met a second time on 11/16 for ice cream and had a good time again, we’re still getting to know each other but we’re hitting it off. The next week we both had engagements on 11/22 but we met up after and had a nice time. The next week was her birthday, she forewarned me she may be late getting ready so on 11/28 I booked 3 dinner reservations. She was ultimately late (her hair appt ran late) so I waited and we made the later reservation. On 11/30 (her actual birthday) she called me last minute to go to a happy hour and meet her friends, I went and that was a decent time. A few days later I told her I would prefer not be late if possible bc sone of my family members consistently run late and it makes me feel like they don’t care about my time. She was receptive, we continued on. 

Month 2

On 12/6 we both had to leave (me for a work party, her for a friends trip) so we hung out during the week. On 12/13 we were supposed to go on a date, 

Conflict 1

however after l got off work I told her I have to cancel because I’m going to do something with my dad, but we could re schedule for the following week. This is a turning point in our relationship as from this point on she references this day as the day when I showed her I don’t care about her.  I apologize and she explains that she’s very upset and hurt. She has a brunch scheduled with friends the next day and it snowed that morning so I offer to drive her so she won’t have to worry about the roads, she’s not fully receptive but she lets me drive her and we’re able to talk. By Monday she seems to be back to somewhat normal. We hang out during the week and I leave for Hawaii with my family (mom, dad and sister) from 12/20 - 12/30. She expresses to me that she’ll spend Christmas alone and she’ll be sad. 

Conflict 2

I get back around 2pm and have to drop my sister off at the house for her telework and shower/unpack and she wants me to come over. I tell her that’s fine but I have to do some things first, it’s getting late around 7pm she asks if I could’ve done these things (shower, unpack, go to Walmart) at another time because she’s waiting on me. I tell her no I just got back and was on the plane for hours. She wants me to pick up her food and bring it to her and I tell her I’m really running around she’s at her house she could pick up the food herself instead of giving me more things to do. She says this is another time when I showed I didn’t care about her. I explain to her how much stuff I had to do and that I had to return to work the next morning. Ultimately it was a small hiccup and we continued on. 

Month 3

We had an awesome time on NYE. We went to multiple parties her friends invited her to and I meshed well with everyone. 

Conflict 3

We planned to go see wicked 2 on 1/3, however there were limited showtimes so she asked me earlier that day if we could just buy it on tv and watch at home. I say yes that’s fine after I get off work we can do dinner then watch the movie at home. She then she’s going for drinks with friends first, I say okay. Her going for drinks runs late around 1130 and she asks me to just come see her at the house after. I do so and I tell her she canceled on me the same way, she flips it she says she didn’t cancel because it wasn’t a date because we were gonna watch the movie at home. I tell her she asked to do that so in retrospect that seems like it was a trick question. She deflects but ultimately agrees that she canceled because she wanted to go for drinks. We don’t talk the following Monday, she contacts me Tuesday and says she doesn’t like me going the day without speaking to her and it makes her anxious, I explain to her that after conflict I need time to process things. 

Conflict 4 

The week from 1/5-1/10 I’m sick with COVID and we don’t see each other. We’re talking on the phone on 1/12 and somehow we start talking about men and women in healthcare professions and she raises her voice saying the reason I matriculated the way I did was because of patriarchy and because I’m a man. I was taken aback because she never raised her voice with me and I generally don’t like that. I also thought we were just having a dialogue. The next day goes by and we don’t speak as I’m taking my time after she yelled at me. She calls me the next morning and yells at me some more saying she cannot go without hearing from me because that makes her anxious. She also says I didn’t ask about her day or her presentation so I don’t care about her then she hung up the phone. On 1/15 I text her telling her I don’t know if it’s working out I don’t like people yelling at me (I unfortunately did this on her sorority’s founders day). We met up yesterday and she said doing that on her founders day made her visibly sad at the festivities and showed I don’t care about her. I explained to her that I’m not into sorority/fraternity I was just communicating how I feel. 

Postface 

Generally I like her. We had good experiences but the relationship is still new.

My program is kind of anti social, I’m trying hard to make friends but no one seems interested doing much outside of going to class and going home. Because of my course load I haven’t had time to join any groups outside of school to try to make friends.

I chose my neighborhood here based on affordability (very low phd stipend) and access to transit. But I don’t feel safe walking around alone. In NY I rarely felt unsafe, but I really just don’t feel comfortable here. I’ve been harassed on the street and it’s kind of dead and empty even on weekend evenings. I really don’t feel like I fit in or belong here.

The program itself is good and the professors are great but I really can’t imagine the next five - six years of my life looking like this. I miss walking around listening to music and going to parks to watch the sunset, I miss having someone to grab coffee with on the weekends. It’s feels so much harder here just to have any little things in life worth enjoying.

So, a bit of background: I'm a 28M, single, and I was in Vegas for a buddy's bachelor party. We're all pretty tame guys—think board games and craft beer over strip clubs—but on the last night, the group decides to hit the Strip for some ""authentic Vegas experience."" I wander off on my own after a few drinks, feeling adventurous but not that adventurous.

Enter the hooker. Let's call her ""Jade"" (not her real name, obviously). She's stunning, confident, and approaches me outside a casino with the classic ""Hey handsome, looking for some fun?"" line. I'm flattered but politely decline, explaining I'm just out for a walk. Instead of walking away, she laughs and says, ""No pressure, but mind if I join you? It's slow tonight, and you're cute."" Flattery works wonders when you're buzzed, so we end up strolling and chatting. Turns out she's hilarious—tells stories about weird clients, her side gig as a yoga instructor, and how she once convinced a guy to invest in crypto during a lap dance.

We grab coffee (yes, actual coffee) at a 24-hour diner, and the conversation gets... personal. I mention I'm recently out of a long-term relationship and feeling a bit lost in the bedroom department. She's all empathy and starts giving unsolicited advice like a sex-positive therapist. ""You need to explore, honey! Toys aren't just for women."" Before I know it, she's dragging me into an adult shop nearby. I'm mortified but intrigued—I've never been in one of these places sober.

She picks out this high-end dildo, all sleek and vibrating, and insists on buying it for me. ""Consider it a gift from a stranger,"" she says with a wink. ""No strings attached—pun intended."" I protest, but she's already at the counter, paying with cash like it's no big deal. We laugh about it outside, exchange numbers (stupid, I know), and part ways with a hug. No services rendered, just a bizarrely wholesome encounter.

Fast forward to the next morning: I wake up in my hotel room staring at this dildo on the nightstand like it's an alien artifact. Panic sets in. What if my buddies find it? What if she texts expecting something? I pack it in my suitcase and fly home, but then she messages: ""Hey, hope the gift spices things up! Coffee sometime if you're back in town?"" I freak out and... ghost her. Haven't replied since.

AITA? She was super nice, spent her own money, and I bailed like a coward. Or is this just Vegas weirdness that stays in Vegas? Reddit, judge me.",2,1768708787.0,storys,0,1.0,False

This is the link for the full manuscript:

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TMjZIyAlbXsWJtb3QbEECinHTkJ3t8cB?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TMjZIyAlbXsWJtb3QbEECinHTkJ3t8cB?usp=sharing)

**Genre:** Psychological Suspense/Literary Thriller  
**Word count:** \~10,000  
**Status:** In progress  
**Content warnings:** None

**Blurb:** Stephen Whitlock is a successful author who has finally done what few survive: finished an eight-book series without stopping to breathe. Burned out and newly unmoored, he retreats to his isolated lake house in rural Alabama, hoping rest will return what discipline took.

Instead, something small begins to intrude.

A clicking sound—brief, precise, impossible to locate. It isn’t loud. It isn’t constant. And it doesn’t behave like noise should.

At first, Stephen assumes it’s stress. Fatigue. Habit. But the sound follows him—across rooms, across states, even across an ocean when he travels to Thailand searching for distance and anonymity. Along the way, he begins to notice details around the lake that don’t align with official history: missing records, altered maps, silences where people should have been.

As Stephen tries to write again, the line between observation and invention begins to blur. Is he uncovering something buried decades ago when the lake was formed—or is he losing his grip on reality?

*Falls City* is a slow-burn psychological thriller about legacy, erasure, and the quiet ways the past insists on being heard. It asks a simple question with unsettling consequences:

What if the sound you can’t ignore isn’t in your head—and never was?

 **Excerpt:** Stephen woke to absence—no heater cycling on, no pipes knocking in the walls, no wind pushing against the house. The lake beyond the windows was flat enough to look artificial, its surface swallowed by a low fog that erased the shoreline opposite the house entirely. Even the nearest trees looked tentative, as if they might not be there once the light changed.

He stayed in bed longer than usual, listening for something he couldn’t quite name, then dismissed the impulse and swung his legs over the side. The floorboards were quiet beneath his feet. The house held its breath.

In the bathroom, the light came on without a flicker. The mirror showed the same face he expected—sleep-softened, unremarkable. He brushed his teeth, rinsed the sink, and shut the medicine cabinet with a controlled push so it wouldn’t click against the frame.

That thought registered too late.

He paused, then continued on.

The hallway was quiet. The kitchen was quiet. He opened the back door and stood barefoot on the threshold, letting the cold morning air creep in around his ankles. Fog pressed close to the house, damp and unmoving, concealing distance without making a sound. Somewhere down the shoreline, a bird called once—abruptly—and then fluttered away.

Nothing reacted to it.

Stephen stepped out onto the deck and scanned the yard. The fog flattened everything, reducing depth to a guess. The dock vanished a few feet out. The water itself was indistinguishable from the air above it. A slightly crooked fence post was mentally added to his to-do list.

He closed the door behind him and went back inside.

In the kitchen, he started the coffee without thinking—filter, grounds, water—then realized he’d stopped with the kettle halfway to the reservoir. His hand hovered there, the weight familiar, expected.

Something was wrong with the spacing.

Not the room. Not the house. The interval between moments.

His gaze flicked away. ""You're infertile, Lily. We've tried for years—""

——————
""I Want a Divorce""
The rain had been tapping against the penthouse windows all evening, soft enough to pretend it wasn't there but loud enough to remind me that something wasn't right. I sat across from Greyson at the long mahogany dining table—his choice, of course. Always his choice. The table could seat twelve, but tonight it was just the two of us, sitting like strangers in a house I once believed held our future.
He hadn't even looked at the dinner I'd made. The candles I lit for our anniversary flickered between us, their warm glow trying—and failing—to soften the tension breaking at the seams.
Greyson's fingers tapped against the stem of his wine glass. Slow. Measured. Like he was counting down to something. My stomach sank with every tap.
Finally, he looked up. Cold grey eyes. A face that used to light up the moment he saw me. Now it was an unreadable stone.
""Lily,"" he said, voice flat, ""I want a divorce.""
The words sliced clean through the silence.
For a second, I thought I didn't hear him right. The world didn't even stop dramatically—there was no gasp, no thunder, no sudden dramatic music. Just me. Sitting there. Breathing too quietly. Feeling my pulse stop and start again like it couldn't decide whether living was worth the trouble.
""Okay,"" I whispered.
It was too automatic, too calm. But that's what dignity does—it shows up even when the ground disappears under your feet.
He blinked, almost surprised at how easily I let the blade sink into me. ""Just... okay?""
""What do you want me to say?"" My voice didn't shake. Small miracle. ""You've clearly made your decision.""
His jaw tightened. Guilt flickered in his eyes, fast and fleeting, before that blank mask returned. ""This isn't working. You know that.""
I swallowed hard. The food in front of me blurred.
""Is this about her?"" I asked, even though I already knew the answer. Natalia—the assistant with perfect eyeliner and a smile sharpened like a weapon. She had been hovering around him for months, floating into rooms with a sweetness that tasted like poison.
Greyson didn't answer, and the silence was louder than any confession.
A part of me cracked, but I kept my face smooth. If he was going to destroy the life we built, he wouldn't get the satisfaction of watching me fall apart.
""You deserve someone who can give you a family,"" he said, and the words hit harder than the divorce itself. ""Someone who can give me children.""
There it was. The dagger twisted.
My throat burned, but I didn't let the tears rise. I'd learned long ago that tears meant weakness, and weakness was something Greyson had zero tolerance for.
""You think I don't want children?"" My voice trembled—not with sadness, but with fury I didn't trust myself to release. ""You think any of this was my choice?""
His gaze flicked away. ""You're infertile, Lily. We've tried for years—""
""We?"" I almost laughed. ""Greyson, you haven't held my hand in a doctor's office since the first year of our marriage.""
""That's not fair.""
""Neither is blaming me for something I didn't cause.""
His lips pressed into a thin line. ""It doesn't change the fact that I want a family. And I can't keep waiting for something that won't happen.""
Something inside me clenched so hard it hurt. The humiliation, the betrayal, the sheer coldness of his tone—it all gathered into a tight knot in my chest.
""I see,"" I murmured.
The candles flickered again, casting shadows across his face. Shadows I didn't recognize anymore.
""I've already spoken to my attorney,"" he continued. ""The paperwork should be ready tomorrow.""
Tears pricked the edges of my eyes. I blinked them back viciously. He didn't deserve the satisfaction.
""So that's it,"" I said softly. ""Five years. Done over dinner.""
He didn't flinch.
I pushed my chair back and stood. My legs felt numb, but my spine stayed straight.
""You know what hurts the most?"" I whispered. ""Not that you're leaving me. Not even that you've already chosen someone else.""
I looked him dead in the eye.
""It's that you think this makes you the victim.""
His expression twitched—shock, anger, guilt—I couldn't tell. I didn't care.
I turned away, but his voice stopped me at the doorway.
""Lily.""
I froze.
He hesitated. ""I never meant to hurt you.""
A bitter laugh almost escaped me. Almost.
""You did,"" I said quietly. ""But you'll live with it.""
I walked out of the dining room, heels echoing across marble floors that suddenly felt like someone else's home. Each step felt like shedding a piece of the life I'd tried so desperately to build with him.
In our bedroom—my soon-to-be former bedroom—I grabbed the suitcase from the closet and began stuffing clothes into it. Not neatly, not the way I usually packed. This was survival, not preparation.
My hands shook, but I kept going.
I wasn't giving him the privilege of watching me break.
He didn't follow me, of course. Greyson Hale never chased. Never apologized twice. Never let emotions interrupt his plans.
But I paused at the door before leaving.
Part of me wanted to look back. To memorize the walls, the windows, the bed where we'd laughed once—years ago. Before everything rotted.
But I didn't.
He didn't deserve to be the last thing I saw in that home.
I left the penthouse and walked straight into the hallway, suitcase wheels rattling behind me. The elevator ride to the lobby felt like floating underwater—soundless, breathless.
When the doors opened, the night air slapped me awake. Cold. Honest.
I dragged my suitcase toward my car, ignoring the tightness building in my chest.
Dignity first.
Heartbreak later.
I unlocked the door, threw the suitcase into the back seat, and slid behind the wheel. My fingers gripped the steering wheel harder than necessary.
I didn't cry. Not yet.
I started the engine and pulled away from the building, watching the lights of the penthouse fade through the rain-spattered windshield.
I told myself not to look back.
So I didn't.
Not once.
But a single thought burned beneath the numbness, low and steady like a spark refusing to die:
One day, Greyson Hale, you'll regret this.
My phone buzzed in the passenger seat. His name flashed across the screen.
For a moment—just one tiny, pathetic moment—I thought he might apologize. Tell me he didn't mean it. Tell me to come home.
But reality wasn't that kind.
His message appeared:
We need to finalize things quickly. I'll have the lawyer call you first thing in the morning.
Cold. Efficient. Detached.
Exactly like the man he had become.
My chest tightened, but my hands stayed steady as I powered off the phone.
If he wanted a clean break, fine. I'd give it to him.
Just not the way he expected.
The rain picked up, washing the city lights into blurred streaks across the windshield. I drove in silence, letting the darkness swallow the last pieces of the life he'd thrown away.
Only when I reached the edge of the city—far from his world, far from the penthouse filled with lies—did the facade shatter.
My throat squeezed, breath hitching. The first tear slipped free, then another. I pressed my forehead against the steering wheel, letting the sobs rip through the walls I'd tried so hard to keep standing.
This was the last time I cried for him.
I swore it.
Because tonight, I wasn't just losing a marriage.
I was burying the version of myself who waited for Greyson Hale to love her.
And in the quiet aftermath of that heartbreak, something else stirred inside me—not hope, not yet.
But resolve.
He wanted a divorce?
Fine.
I would give him his freedom.
But one day—when he learned what he lost,when truth clawed its way out of the ruins he created,when everything he thought he knew came crashing down—
He would regret letting me go.
And I wouldn't be there to soften the fall.
Not this time.
THE LAST GOODBYE
I didn't remember most of the drive to my mother's house. I remembered the rain, the blur of headlights, the hollow ache in my chest that kept expanding until it felt like I was driving with a void where my lungs should've been. I remembered the silence too—the heavy kind that sinks into your bones and whispers that your life just changed in a way you can never undo.
By the time I pulled into my mother's driveway, the storm had finally eased. The house looked exactly the same as it always did—warm lights glowing behind sheer curtains, a fading garden lining the front walk, wind chimes tinkling weakly in the breeze. But stepping out of the car felt different tonight. It felt like walking into a sanctuary I didn't deserve.
My mother opened the door before I reached it, her frail frame leaning against the doorframe. She always knew when something was wrong. Maybe it was the way I moved. Maybe it was the silence. Maybe it was the fact that my eyes burned and I refused to let the tears fall.
""Lily?"" Her voice was soft, careful. ""Sweetheart, what happened?""
The moment I saw her—really saw her—every piece of strength I'd been forcing myself to hold onto cracked. But I still didn't crumble. Not yet. I stepped inside, closed the door behind me, and managed to say, ""He wants a divorce.""
Her face fell, sadness pooling in her eyes before she even took a breath. ""Come here,"" she whispered.
I did. She pulled me into her arms, arms that were thinner than they used to be, arms that had held me together more times than I could count. I buried my face in her shoulder, inhaling the faint scent of lavender and old books, the scent of home. And for the first time since Greyson said those words, I let myself lean on someone.
""He said I can't give him children,"" I murmured, voice breaking before I could stop it. ""That I'm infertile and he wants a family.""
My mother's arms tightened around me. ""Oh, sweetheart...""
""He didn't even look guilty,"" I whispered. ""He just... decided. Like he was canceling a dinner reservation instead of ending our marriage.""
I felt her breath hitch. She stroked my hair with trembling fingers. ""You've always deserved more than his coldness.""
I pulled back slightly, wiping my face with the back of my hand. ""I should've seen it coming.""
""No,"" she said firmly. ""Don't blame yourself for someone else's cruelty.""
Cruelty. The truth of the word stung.
I swallowed hard, trying to keep the tears from returning. ""I feel stupid. Five years. Five years, and it all ended in fifteen minutes.""
My mother guided me to the couch, tucking a blanket over my shoulders the moment I sat down. She always did that—wrapped warmth around me when the world turned cold.
""You're not stupid, Lily,"" she said gently. ""You loved him. You fought for your marriage. That doesn't make you foolish—it makes you human.""
I looked down at my hands, fingers tangled in the fabric of the blanket. I'd worn my wedding ring for five years without ever taking it off. But tonight, the weight of it felt unbearable. I slipped it off and placed it on the coffee table. A small metallic click. A tiny sound. But it felt like a funeral bell.
""I thought he'd at least pretend to care,"" I said softly. ""Pretend to fight for us. For something.""
""He doesn't deserve you,"" my mother said. ""He never did.""
I wanted to believe that. I really did.
But part of me still whispered maybe if I had tried harder, worked harder, been more—something—things would've been different. That part of me needed to be silenced, or it would destroy me.
My mother reached for my hand. ""You didn't fail him, Lily. He failed you.""
My chest tightened, but her words sank deep, planting themselves somewhere fragile.
We sat in silence for a moment, the quiet broken only by the soft hum of the heater. I stared at the ring on the table—cold, shiny, meaningless.
""I should've left him first,"" I said bitterly.
My mother gave me a sad smile. ""You stayed because you loved him. Not because you were weak.""
I let out a breath that felt too heavy for my lungs. ""Well... love wasn't enough for him.""
""It will be enough for the right person,"" she said. ""Someone who sees your worth. Someone who doesn't walk away when things get hard.""
I nodded, even though I didn't believe it yet.
""Stay here tonight,"" she said. ""You shouldn't be alone.""
""I don't want to impose.""
""You're my daughter,"" she said with a hint of mock annoyance. ""You don't impose.""
A small, broken smile tugged at my lips.
She squeezed my hand. ""You can stay as long as you need.""
""Thank you,"" I whispered. ""I... I just need time.""
""You'll have it.""
She stood up, slow and careful, and went to make tea. I watched her move—too thin, too tired—and guilt gnawed at me. She'd been fighting illness for years, and I'd been so consumed with trying to fix a marriage that was already dead, I hadn't noticed how quickly she was fading.
When she returned with two cups of tea, she handed one to me before settling onto the couch beside me.
""You know,"" she said softly, ""sometimes losing something is what forces us to find ourselves again.""
""I'm not sure I like who I am right now,"" I admitted.
""That's because you're hurting,"" she whispered. ""But pain isn't permanent, Lily. It changes. It teaches. It shapes.""
I took a sip of the tea. It was warm, soothing, familiar. Everything I wasn't.
My mother leaned her head gently against mine. ""One day, you'll look back on this moment and realize it was the beginning of something better.""
I didn't say anything. I didn't trust my voice not to crack.
But I hoped she was right.
I hoped all of this—Greyson's rejection, the heartbreak, the humiliation—wasn't just pointless suffering. I hoped it meant something. Led to something. Or at least didn't leave me shattered forever.
My mother reached up and brushed a strand of hair from my face. ""You're stronger than you think.""
""I don't feel strong.""
""You don't have to feel strong to be strong,"" she said. ""Sometimes strength is simply surviving.""
I let that settle in my chest.
Her breathing grew slower, heavier. She was exhausted. I guided her to bed, helped her lie down, and ki-ssed her forehead before returning to the living room.
The house felt too quiet now. Too still.
I sat on the couch and stared at the wall, letting the weight of the night settle over me like a second blanket.
Then, slowly, the tears returned. Soft at first, then harder, until I buried my face in my hands. My shoulders shook, but I didn't try to stop it.
This was grief. Not just for the marriage. But for the woman I'd been while inside it.
I cried until every tear felt like it scraped something raw inside me. And when the sobs finally slowed, I exhaled shakily and wiped my cheeks.
This wasn't the end of my story.
It was only the end of his chapter in it.
I curled up on the couch, pulling the blanket tighter around me. The ring still sat on the coffee table, catching the light. Mocking me. Reminding me.
I turned away from it.
Greyson wanted a divorce? Fine.
But I wouldn't let it define me.
Not anymore.
In the darkness, I made myself a promise.
Tonight would be the last night I cried for him.
And tomorrow?
Tomorrow, I'd start learning how to live again.
Even if it meant saying goodbye to the version of myself who once believed loving him was enough.
A Birthday in Ruins
I woke up to the soft murmur of voices drifting through my mother's small living room. At first, I thought I was dreaming—the kind of dream where you're warm, safe, and suspended between sleep and waking. But then the ache in my chest reminded me that no dream of mine involved divorce papers or betrayal.
My eyes blinked open slowly. I'd fallen asleep on the couch, curled tightly beneath a blanket, still wearing yesterday's clothes. My head was heavy, my throat dry, my mind foggy in the worst way. Crying yourself to sleep had consequences—ugly, swollen, emotional ones.
""Is she awake?"" a quiet voice whispered.
""I think so,"" another replied.
I sat up, rubbing my eyes. My mother and her nurse were standing by the kitchen doorway, both wearing soft smiles that tried—too hard—to hide their worry.
""Good morning, sweetheart,"" my mother said gently.
""Morning,"" I croaked, my voice betraying me instantly. Smooth, Lily. Very dignified.
The nurse, Clara, stepped forward with a small plate in her hands. A tiny slice of cake sat on it, sprinkled with powdered sugar and a candle that hadn't been lit yet.
""We didn't want to wake you,"" Clara said. ""But we wanted to at least try to celebrate your birthday.""
Right.My birthday.
Because the universe clearly wasn't done mocking me.
I forced a small smile, even though the last thing I felt like doing was celebrating anything. ""You didn't have to do this.""
""I know,"" my mother said, walking toward me with careful steps, ""but I wanted to.""
She handed me the plate. I stared at it—simple, small, imperfect. Somehow that made it even more heartbreaking. She'd baked for me, even though her hands shook and her energy was limited. She'd tried. She always tried.
My mother lit the candle and ki-ssed my forehead. ""Make a wish, sweetheart.""
My throat tightened instantly.
A wish?What was I supposed to wish for?A husband who loved me?A marriage that wasn't dead?A heart that didn't feel like it was being held together with string?
I closed my eyes anyway. Please, I wished silently, give me a life that doesn't hurt this much.
I blew out the candle. The flame disappeared, but the ache didn't.
My mother hugged me carefully, mindful of her fragile frame. ""Happy birthday, Lily.""
""Thank you,"" I whispered.
She pulled away with a knowing look. ""Try to eat something. You barely ate last night.""
I nodded, trying not to crumble again.
""Call me if you need me,"" she said. ""I'll be in my room.""
Clara followed her out, closing the door softly behind them, leaving me alone with the slice of cake and the weight of reality.
My phone buzzed on the couch.
My stomach twisted.
I didn't have to look to know who it was.
I picked it up anyway.
Greyson Hale:Happy birthday.We should still talk today. There are things to finalize.
My chest tightened with a familiar, disgusting mix of anger and humiliation.
He remembered my birthday, but not as a husband. Just a man eager to wrap up the loose ends of a marriage he'd thrown away.
I stared at his message for a long moment before blocking his number.No hesitation.No second thoughts.
He didn't get to access my pain anymore.
I put the phone face down and exhaled slowly. Today was going to be long enough without replaying last night over and over.
A hot shower helped wash off the exhaustion clinging to my skin, but it didn't wash away the hurt. Nothing could—not yet.
I got dressed for work in silence. Simple black pants, a fitted blouse, hair pulled into a low bun. Polished enough to appear put together. Neutral enough to hide the storm raging inside me.
My mother called out as I grabbed my bag. ""Are you sure you want to work today?""
""Better than staying here, overthinking everything.""
She sighed softly. ""Just don't push yourself too hard.""
""I won't.""Another lie for her peace of mind.
I ki-ssed her forehead and stepped outside.
The air was crisp, the sky clearing after last night's storm. My car smelled faintly of lavender from the sachet my mother tucked into it months ago. The scent helped settle me—just a little.
But when I arrived at the luxury hotel restaurant, the calm vanished immediately.
The staff greeted me with bright smiles. I returned them automatically. They didn't know anything. They didn't need to.
I took my position behind the service counter, checking reservations, reviewing menus, distracting myself with the rhythm of routine.
But then I froze.
Reservation list:
Hale, Greyson — Table for two.
My heart sank to the floor.
Of all the days, of all the moments, of all the restaurants in the city—why here? Why today? Why me?
The universe didn't hate me.It was actively trolling me.
My manager walked past. ""Lily, can you handle his table? They specifically asked for you.""
Of course they did.
""Sure,"" I said, voice calm despite the scream trapped in my throat.
By lunchtime, my emotional armor felt like it had cracks everywhere. But when I saw him walk in, hand in hand with Natalia, those cracks turned into fractures.
She looked perfect.
Perfect hair. Perfect makeup. Perfect smile. Perfect smugness.
Greyson looked... the same.Cool. Controlled. Untouchable.
His eyes flicked toward me for a split second. Something flickered there—but I didn't care enough to analyze it.
I walked to their table, posture straight, expression neutral.
""Good afternoon,"" I said. ""Welcome. Can I take your drink order?""
Natalia smirked immediately. ""Oh, look at that. He wasn't lying—you do still work here.""
Sharp. Belittling. Designed to cut.
I smiled politely. ""Some people work for a living, Natalia.""
Greyson's jaw tensed.
""Grey,"" she said sweetly, sliding closer to him, ""I want the rosé you love.""
He barely reacted to the endearment.
I raised a brow. ""And for you, Mr. Hale?""
His gaze lifted to mine. Cold. And yet... not. There was something else underneath. Something unspoken. Something inconvenient.
""Water,"" he said.
I nodded and turned away before my composure slipped.
When I returned with their drinks, Natalia leaned forward with a smile so fake it made my teeth ache.
""I heard last night was... eventful,"" she said. ""Rough ending to a marriage, huh?""
My hand paused briefly before placing her glass down. ""Would you like to see the specials menu?""
Her smirk grew. ""I just want to make sure you're handling everything okay. Breakups can be... humiliating.""
My smile sharpened. ""You would know.""
Greyson choked on his water.
Natalia's eyes narrowed.
""Anything else?"" I asked pleasantly.
""No,"" Grey muttered. ""That's all.""
I walked away, but not before catching the tightness in his expression. He wasn't enjoying this lunch as much as she wanted him to.
Too bad.
Not my problem.
The rest of their meal was a blur of strained politeness and far too many side glances from Greyson. Natalia kept touching him—his shoulder, his arm, his hand—as if marking territory. He barely responded.
Good.
Let him sit in the mess he created.
After they finally left, I stepped outside for a breath of air. The sun was brighter than I expected, and I tilted my face toward it, letting the warmth sink in.
My phone buzzed again.
An unknown number.
I let it ring. I wasn't playing Greyson's games anymore.
The rest of my shift passed slowly. Heavy. Emotionally draining.
By evening, my head hurt, my chest hurt, my everything hurt. I grabbed my things and headed toward the exit—only to stop short when I saw a familiar black car parked outside.
Greyson was leaning against it, hands in his pockets, expression unreadable.
No.Absolutely not.
I turned around, intending to walk back inside, but his voice stopped me.
""Lily. Wait.""
I froze.Not for him—just to steady myself.
I turned slowly. ""What do you want?""
He stepped closer. ""We need to talk.""
""I blocked your number for a reason.""
""This is important.""
I laughed softly. ""So was our marriage.""
He flinched.
For a moment, silence stretched between us, thick and suffocating.
""I didn't come here to fight,"" he said quietly. ""I just... wanted to know if you're okay.""
My chest tightened.I hated that part of me that reacted to that.Hated it.
""I'm fine,"" I lied. ""And even if I wasn't, it's none of your concern.""
""Lily—""
""No."" My voice cracked like a whip. ""You don't get to check on me. You don't get to act like you didn't destroy everything.""
He swallowed hard. ""I never meant—""
""Stop."" I held up a hand. ""You made your choice. Live with it. And leave me alone.""
His jaw clenched. His eyes shifted, raw in a way I didn't want to interpret.
But I didn't wait for him to speak again. I turned and walked away.
He didn't follow.
He never did.
And that hurt almost as much as everything else.",2,1768707683.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

I’ve been using the Fellow Prismo since day one, but I finally tried the Inverted Method today. I ran into two main issues/questions:

1. **The ""Sticky"" Plunger = No Flat Bed?:** When I flip the AeroPress back over, a significant amount of coffee grounds stay stuck to the rubber plunger. Everyone says a flat coffee bed is critical for even extraction. If the grounds are swirling around and sticking to the plunger during the flip, how is a flat bed even possible with the inverted method?
2. **Prismo and Channeling:** I’ve also been thinking about the Fellow Prismo - does the design cause heavy channeling? Since the entire flow is forced through that tiny pressure valve in the center, does it over-extract the middle while leaving the edges under-extracted? I usually playing around by adding more filters or even puckscreens (the 53mm puck can fit beautifully in the middle) upper or under the prismo too :>

they met at a friend's birthday, in fact, i'm the one who became friends with her. he only saw he for a bit and thought she was very pretty.

its been a year. she had a boyfriend and my brother waited until they broke up to ask her out. he took it slow, was charming, became friends and she seemed interested. its been one month since they've been texting (she lives in another city) and they already have a date planned - theyre going to get coffee together.

my brother is good in relationships. he buys his girl (when he has one) flowers every month, chocolate when she wants, pays for everything and he sacrifices a lot of time so he can spend it with the girl instead.

however this time it's different. this girl from the bday party is a devout christian. my brother is only just getting there.

my brother still vapes, smokes, does drugs, gambles, and he has the fattest mouth ever. the most concerning/worst part is that he doesnt seem to have the desire to stop. he LOVES the life he has now (in terms of that)

he is rude, has the worst attitude and temper tantrums. my entire life i've known him he has only been an issue to my parents and caused troubles at home. he's seriously one of those spoiled brats you hear about. the way he treats our mother is criminal and he doesnt even speak to my dad and when he does it's absolutely insulting or dismissive (and i love my parents, they are very lovely and generous people).

i could go on and on about how he's an absolute c\*nt and even how i almost signed him up to the military just so he can grow up and see how it feels to be shouted at.

it took him until i was 15 to finally have a conversation with me (i am now 18F).

he has already lied to this girl and told her he doesnt smoke.

ive been debating for a long time whether or not to tell this girl to run and it feels too late. should i tell her the truth?",2,1768707140.0,moraldilemmas,1,0.67,False

I’m six months into pour over. I was stuck between the 078 and the Z1. While reading feedback, I even flirted with the Z2 as an early end-game move.

After more reading, great feedback, and honest reflection, I think going straight to a high-end electric grinder would have been a mistake. I don’t yet know my taste preferences. Locking into one expensive solution feels premature.

So I’m skipping electric for now.

Instead, I plan to explore through two hand grinders.

* **1Zpresso K Ultra** for coffees where balance, sweetness, and body matter
* **Pietro with Pro Brewing** burrs for coffees calling for clarity, separation, and precision

This approach feels more aligned with where I am. Learn first. Spend big on electric once I dial in my preferences later.

I’d love feedback.

• Does this thinking track better than my earlier approach?

• Will these two grinders give real range across beans and roast styles?

• Is there a stronger alternative to the K Ultra for balance and body?

• Any reason to rethink the Pietro or its burr choice?

Estimated year of release: between 2002-2008 i would guess. maybe earlier  
  
Graphics/art style: if i remember correctly it was cartoony.  
  
Notable characters: n/a - though i vividly remember there being a narrator that would call out the image on the card you flipped. male, i believe he had an australian accent.  
  
Notable gameplay mechanics: it was a match 2 memory game, cards spread on a grid bottom up so you cannot see. you clicked two to reveal what was on the cards, and if they matched, they would clear from the grid. the cards were themed. the theme was drinks. there was also another section of the game where you made cheese toasties. it was formatted to be like a recipe while also being a engaging little mini game. i believe the narrator for this was a woman, same accent.

  
Other details: as stated above, the narrator would call out the drink displayed on the card you flipped. i vividly remember ""milkshake"", ""coffee"" and ""green tea"". for the cheese toasties, i have no clue how you got to that mini game, as i don't remember the game as a whole being a ""choose your mini game"" sort of format. i THINK the memory game was the main attraction. but yeah, all i remember was that and the cheese toasties. i wanna say there was another theme to the cards, but the only thing that sticks out are the drinks.

i literally CANNOT find the game through google with specific keywords related to the game. so either it's THAT obscure, or the game no longer exists. but i can't even find images of it, so maybe it IS that obscure. i already posted this on here a while back, but it didn't receive much attention. the fact i can't remember the game is bothering me again, so i decided to give reddit another shot!",1,1768707079.0,tipofmyjoystick,3,1.0,False

- gave me a hug unprompted (this is the second time in our friendship we have hugged, he is pretty touch averse)

I have identical triplet girls who I’ll call W, A and M (8 months actual/ 6 months adjusted) and one of them (W) is going through a phase and I can’t pick what it is. Every time she gets put down she screams. Doesn’t matter where or when. Be it bouncer, seat, cot, pram or tummy time she screams. Doesn’t matter if she’s fed, got a fresh bum, is in new clothes or even if she’s outside in the breeze which she usually loves. Sometimes even changing position when I’m holding her she starts up crying. 

I’m just struggling because my husband and I sleep in split shifts so I’m asleep 10pm-4am and he sleeps 4am-10am.When I wake up A is usually up and happy but then as all 3 are awake it starts up and my 4y/o wakes up around 8. I just can’t manage holding W while trying to care for all her sisters. Recently my mum has started taking 2/3 babies for an hour in the morning to go for coffee and if she’s takes W she’s absolutely fine, doesn’t scream. 

Is this separation anxiety just at home? I’m being torn 4 ways most of my mornings now and I don’t get any down time in my own home since there’s always at least one baby awake.

So jumping to “the team brought a water purifier, therefore Indore is unsafe” is lazy thinking.

Players have personal preferences, medical and dietary routines, and hygiene standards. Someone like Shubman Gill having a specific setup says nothing about the host city. Teams do this for performance consistency, not out of fear.

What’s frustrating is how Indore keeps getting dragged into unrelated narratives. One incident happens and suddenly everything is blamed on the city. These things aren’t connected.

If a player carries their own mattress or coffee grinder tomorrow, will that be Indore’s fault too?

For years, I’d been a devoted tea drinker, happy with my daily brews and never really tempted by coffee. My wife, on the other hand, has always been a coffee lover and had been dropping hints about wanting a budget-friendly espresso machine. So last October, I surprised her with a Casabrews 5418, a bag of Lavazza Crema e Aroma beans, and decided to pull my very first espresso shot ever… with myself as the official taste-tester guinea pig.

One sip, and bam!… I was hooked. The rich crema, the bold flavor, the whole ritual… it hit me like a caffeine fever dream. I instantly fell head over heels for everything espresso, ultimately landing on Americans as my go to.

Fast forward, and I’ve since passed the trusty Casabrews along to my daughter (who’s putting it to good use), upgraded to a full-on proper home coffee bar setup, and haven’t looked back since (see photo). 

What started as a sweet gesture for my wife turned into my new passion project.

But I need to vent and see if I'm the asshole here. Buckle up, because this story is wild.

So, background: Me (28M) and my buddy Jake (27M) have been friends since high school. We're like brothers—shared everything from beers to bad decisions. But Jake has this habit of being a total prankster douchebag. Harmless stuff at first, like swapping my shampoo with Nair or putting itching powder in my gym shorts. I'd laugh it off, get him back with something light, and we'd move on.

But last month, he crossed the line. Big time. I had this huge job interview for my dream position at a tech firm—six figures, remote work, the works. I'd been prepping for weeks, even bought a new suit. The night before, Jake crashes at my place after a ""quick drink"" turns into a bender. I wake up feeling like death, but I power through.

Turns out, while I was passed out, Jake thought it'd be hilarious to spike my coffee with laxatives. Not just any laxatives—industrial-strength stuff he got from who knows where. Mid-interview (over Zoom, thank god), my stomach erupts like Mount Vesuvius. I'm sweating, clenching, trying to answer questions about algorithms while fighting for my life. I excuse myself, but it's too late—the damage is done. I bomb the interview, they ghost me, and now I'm stuck in my dead-end retail job for another year.

I was furious. Called him out, and he just laughed it off like ""bro, it's just a prank!"" No apology, no nothing. That was the last straw. I stewed on it for days, plotting my revenge. I needed something epic, something that'd make him regret ever messing with me.

Enter: Operation Dog Butt Glue.

Jake has this massive golden retriever named Max—sweet dog, loves everyone, including Jake's face (he lets the dog lick him constantly, it's gross). Jake's always bragging about how Max is his ""best boy."" So, one weekend when Jake invites me over to ""make amends"" with pizza and games, I show up prepared. In my pocket: a tube of industrial super glue. The kind that bonds in seconds and needs acetone to remove.

We chill, play some Fortnite, and I wait for my moment. Jake gets up to grab beers, and I ""accidentally"" spill some chips on the floor. Max, being a vacuum cleaner on legs, dives in. Jake laughs and bends down to pet him, getting all up in Max's face like usual.

That's when I strike. Quick as a flash, I squirt a line of glue on Max's butt fur (don't worry, it was a tiny amount, nothing that'd hurt the dog—just enough for adhesion). Jake leans in to ""kiss"" Max's head or whatever weird shit he does, but I ""trip"" and bump him forward. Boom—his lips make contact with Max's rear end. The glue sets instantly.

Chaos ensues. Jake freaks out, muffled screams because his mouth is sealed shut to dog ass. Max is wagging his tail like it's playtime, dragging Jake around the living room on his knees. I'm dying laughing, filming the whole thing on my phone (blurred out for privacy, obvs). Jake's eyes are bulging, he's flailing, and Max just thinks it's a new game.

After a solid 5 minutes of this hilarious hell, I help him out. Grabbed some nail polish remover from his bathroom (acetone-based), soaked a cloth, and carefully dissolved the glue. No permanent damage—Jake's lips were red and sore, Max's fur needed a trim, but everyone was fine. Jake was pissed, called me every name in the book, but I just said, ""Bro, it's just a prank!""

We haven't talked since. He blocked me everywhere, and mutual friends are split—some say I went too far, others think he had it coming. AITA? Was this justified revenge, or did I cross into psycho territory?

TL;DR: Friend ruins my job interview with laxatives, so I super glued his mouth to his dog's butt as payback. Now he's mad, AITA?",0,1768706293.0,story,11,0.45,False

Since then, coffee has been our favorite hot drink. Tea has made something of a comeback, but it’s still not as popular as coffee. ",2,1768705884.0,AskTheWorld,26,1.0,False

1qfx60e,https://www.reddit.com/r/hatemyjob/comments/1qfx60e/my_official_apology_to_job_hoppers/,My official apology to job hoppers,"I got a new job about three weeks ago at a chain coffee shop after my last job slowly cut my hours to nothing and basically forced me to find something else so I could keep paying tuition.
This place hired me almost immediately, which in hindsight should have scared me.

I’ve worked retail since I was 14 at two different stores, so I thought I could handle it. Turns out food service is a whole different nightmare. Faster, louder, more chaotic. I took the job anyway because the pay is way better.
I fucking hate it.

The coworkers are somehow a full collection of the worst people you can be stuck with at a job. Usually there’s one or two awful ones and everyone else is fine. Here it’s the entire staff.
One of the managers is a straight up creep. He hits on every attractive girl that comes in and has made comments about how young some of them look. What really pushed me over the edge was the dress code stuff. We have to wear black pants, fine. I bought two pairs. One tight pair and one nicer, looser pair of server pants. The amount of shit I got for wearing the looser ones was insane. He kept repeating that pants on girls should be tight. Yeah.

There’s also one coworker who is just genuinely nasty. Not mildly rude, not having a bad day. Customers have literally thrown hot coffee at her kind of nasty. The rest of the staff barely acknowledges me. I try to help or talk to them and just get stared at until I walk away.

I used to judge people who job hopped. I thought it meant you had bad work ethic, particularly because the two jobs Ive worked over the course of 8 years had good work environments. Three weeks into this place and I fully get it now. Some workplaces are just awful and no amount of “pushing through” fixes that.

The only reason I’m still here is because I can’t afford not to be. I can’t go even a week without a paycheck right now, and January hiring is brutal. The plan is to survive the semester and get out by summer if I can.

Anyway this is my official apology to job hoppers. I did not realize jobs could be this shitty.",8,1768705611.0,hatemyjob,1,1.0,False

I've been going to 13 Coins since 1979 when I was 15: I was working at the Fun Forest at the Seattle Center as a Ride Operator & the 13 Coins on Boren was the place to hang out PLUS back then, they were open 24/7.

Even though I no longer live in King County, (but I work for King County), I still visit the 13 Coins, the last time prior to this morning was when the Titanic exhibit was at the waterfront.

My friend & I had planned to have breakfast at Ludi's but they were closed (sign on the door said that they were on vacation) so I googled to see what was opening soon. 13 Coins. 

Drove down, got a primo parking spot right in front (heck, it's 6:59am on a Saturday), and went in. Ordered what I did. Asked for a to-go box & checks. Almost $40.00 (with tip) for two eggs, bacon, hash browns, & two pieces of lethargic looking rye toast: seemed a bit much but the food was good. There was no option for a printed receipt so hey, just email it to me. 

Got home, checked my email, & what the mugglefuck is this 4% SERVICE CHARGE for? We all know that it didn't go to the server.

So, after all of these years of going to the 13 Coins, I have added them to my list of Seattle restaurants to avoid because of crap service charges or fees. Hell, at least say what I'm being charged for. 

And I know that my feeble attempt to hide the server's name failed but I am making homemade hom bows & my oven is beeping. And nobody wants burnt hom bows. ",28,1768705583.0,SeattleWA,3,0.84,False

We went on a date like maybe two weeks ago and it was honestly great. I thought It would be pretty awkward (because I'm just an awkward person in general) but no, she made me really comfortable. I paid, drove her home, and yeah that was the end of it.

After that, we have been texting pretty consistently. We talk about some basic things like work, hobbies, just random stuff. The conversations we have are really nice, and it seems like we're getting really comfortable with each other.

This is where I'm unsure.

Since we have gotten more comfortable with each other she's mentioned how she has been ""destroying the toilet"" pretty often. I really didn't think much of it, only that her sense of humor is kind of weird but hey, so is mine. Score.

I was speaking to her about her job since she mentioned she's a barista. I put my phone down to take out my dog. When I came back, I noticed she had unsent two messages. I asked her what she unsent, and she replied, “A failed attempt at a joke.” I playfully pester her into telling me, and then she finally gives in.

>Sometimes I poop in the customers coffee.

Well...alright, talking about feces once again. Whatever, I brush it off and send some laughing emojis. Our conversation returns back to normal and this time we are speaking about a completely different topic.

She's a nice woman, and I'm really into her. I'm noticing that these poop ""jokes"" are reoccurring a pretty decent amount of the time.

Maybe she's trying to send me subliminal messages or something? Or she's testing the waters to see if I'm into scat?

I’m in my 30s and enjoy going to the movies. Today, I saw 'Hamnet,' a book I loved. It was made into a movie—what a beautiful movie! The theater clapped when it ended. I believe Jessie Buckley will win Best Actress at the Oscars this year.

I love to read, explore New York City, I live in New York City and I love it, the greatest city in the world, a major fan of theatre, drinking iced coffee, bubble baths. Catching up on soap operas on Sunday mornings, I believe I'm a good person—kind and patient, yet not easily taken advantage of. Allow me to share a bit about myself: I don't have much time for socializing due to my demanding work schedule. While I do have friends and engage in activities, my work commitments often align with their free time. They are happily married with children, and I genuinely celebrate their happiness, but our lifestyles are quite different, which is why I find myself here.

I lean towards the blue side politically, so please reach out only if you share a similar viewpoint. Additionally, if you devote a lot of time to video games, I’d prefer you not to contact me. Also, if you are a massive sports fan and must watch hours of sports a week, please don’t contact me; that’s not my idea of a good time.

We’re getting married in two months.","I don't know if I'm overreacting or if my entire relationship has been a lie.

My fiancé, ""Mark,"" and I have been together for four years. We’ve always had a great relationship (or so I thought). He works in finance and is a bit of a numbers guy, but he’s always been generous. We split rent 50/50, but he usually insists on paying for dinners and vacations because he earns significantly more than I do.

Yesterday, Mark asked me to send a PDF from his laptop while he was at the gym. When I opened the file explorer, I saw a folder titled ""Long Term Investments."" Curiosity got the better of me, and I opened it. Inside was an Excel sheet with my name on it.

It’s a line-by-line breakdown of **everything**.

* The coffee he bought on our first date ($6.45).
* Every birthday gift, anniversary dinner, and bouquet of flowers.
* Even ""estimated"" costs for gas when he drives us to my parents' house.

At the bottom of the sheet, there is a grand total (it’s over $20,000) and a column labeled ""Reimbursement Value."" There are notes next to certain items like ""offset by her paying for groceries in Oct"" or ""to be discussed post-marriage.""

He never mentioned any of this. I thought these were gifts and acts of love. Now I feel like I’ve been a line item in a ledger for four years. When he got home, I tried to bring up the ""cost of living"" generally to see if he'd admit it, and he just acted completely normal, even saying ""don't worry about the money, babe, I've got you.""

ls this some ""finance person"" quirk? I’m supposed to marry this man in eight weeks, but now I feel like I’m just a debt he’s tracking.

1qfwxkb,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1qfwxkb/rkive_logspart_5_of_8/,Rkive Logs(Part 5 of 8),"I spent a few hours by myself in the guest room to process. It didn't feel like enough distance from my aunt and my thoughts were already collapsing on themselves the longer I stayed here. I needed air. After a moment, I forced myself up from the bed and went to grab my car keys and purse off the nightstand. They were missing. My aunt must have grabbed it while I was asleep this morning. I didn't want to entertain the thought that maybe she was ordered to take them.

 I searched the room for any sign of surveillance with the hope that I was overreacting. I didn't find anything. I took a slow breath through my nose, like I could convince my body that nothing had changed. I was mid-thought when I heard a buzzing sound and immediately reached for my phone only to find no notification. It took me a second to realize the buzz sound I heard was in fact the doorbell. 

Confused, I crossed the room and pulled the curtain back to look outside. He was standing on the front steps of the house, hands shoved into the pockets of his hoodie looking like he wasn't sure he should be here. I recognized him immediately as the boy who lived next door although I hadn't talked to him in years. Growing up, sometimes I'd interact with him just to stay sane. For a split second, I considered opening the window and calling out. Not because I thought he could help me but because I needed an excuse to get out of my aunt's grasp for a while. 

I lost the chance. I could already hear my aunt's calm voice downstairs in mid conversation with him. By the time I reached the stairs, she was already closing the front door. From where I stood I watched him walk away, pausing once to look back before getting into his car. He didn't come back.

Only then did my aunt turn to face me as she spoke. “He recognized your car in the driveway. I didn't account for that.” 

I wanted to say something but the words caught in my throat. She did what she does best. She contained the problem. 

“You moved my things. My keys.” I said quietly. 

“I did. Make no mistake, you aren't a prisoner here Cecilia. But you are to remain indoors for the time being.” She responded, knowing I wouldn't argue. 

My phone buzzed and I checked the notification as another email log stared back at me. 

*Subject remains stationary. Environmental variables noted*. 

I backed away from her as my chest tightened. My pulse jumped. Fleeing wasn't an option. It never was. My aunt simply smiled at me like she was the same woman she had always been. The same woman who taught me fractions in the kitchen and combed my hair in the morning. She politely excused herself and walked to the kitchen, mumbling something about making tea and routines. 

After she left I tiptoed toward the front door, testing the gap between the frame and the carpet. If I could step outside for just a moment, maybe I'd feel better. 

Another ping cut through the silence. This time it came from the laptop that was set on the coffee table. The screen blinked. 

*Subject movement detected. Threat response noted.* 

I froze and with trembling hands, I stepped away from the door. My steps no longer felt like my own. My thoughts and actions never belonged to me to begin with. I sank back against the wall as I thought back to what my aunt had said about the burden of choice. Did she truly believe this was mercy? Freeing me from a life where I'm burdened by choice?

Another ping.

*Subject displays heightened anxiety. Further monitoring required.* 

I couldn't think without my thoughts being analyzed. I couldn't act without it being recorded. 

Without thinking, I took small steps toward the laptop to shut it. I just wanted some peace of mind without hearing it ping each time I did something. I wanted some sense of control. 

As my fingers hovered over the power off button, the screen blinked.

*Subject attempts unauthorized interaction. Response pending.*

1qfwxag,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1qfwxag/capricorn/,Capricorn,"I had a dream about you this morning, right as I was about to wake up.

I’ve been deliberating for several days If I should text you happy birthday, since our birthdays are only a couple days apart. It feels unnatural for me not to consider you, not get you a gift. I always thought it was sweet how our birthdays were in such close proximity. And it always struck me as so thoughtful and kind that you came by my house last year to personally deliver me presents after I was sick. I know you can be that person.

In my dream you, the girl you hate, and your band member who I’m also at war with knocked on the door.

You told me that you had gifts for me, and wanted to wish me a happy birthday. You asked to come in, like vampires. I was confused as to why you would do such a thing, because you know I’m on bad terms with two out of the three of you. But I let you in anyway, because my heart has always always been soft. Because I’ve always looked for the kindest parts of people. It’s in my nature. That’s what kept our friendship alive for years after how you acted, over and over again. you told me that you and your band member wanted to put what happened aside and move forward. The girl you hate watched on. I told you and your band member that I was sorry how things went down like they did, and it pains me so much that we are on bad terms. We exchanged gifts and enjoyed each other’s company for the first time in almost 6 months.

I wish it could be like this in the waking world. I wish you and your band member had the emotional regulation to sit with discomfort instead of firing off your angst on the people who care about you the most. It’s hard not to compare and contrast that with the time in real life when I bumped into you at a coffee shop. How you walked right up to me and our mutual friend yet said nothing to me and didn’t even glance in my direction. Why couldn’t you just wait in line to get a coffee or go to the bathroom until I left? I know you did it deliberately to make me feel something, maybe even intimidate me. Why couldn’t you make me feel something good like you did in the dream?

1qfwnxu,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1qfwnxu/aita_for_wanting_my_best_friend_to_breakup_with/,AITA for wanting my best friend to breakup with his girlfriend?,"My friend “Jacob” (22M) has just recently hit his one year mark with his girlfriend, “Layla” (22F). 

At first I had nothing but unconditional support for my best friend, and was happy to see him happy. Over the course of the next 5 months my friend Jacob barely responds to anybody, I had no idea what was going on his personal life at this point,  but I excused it as just a honeymoon phase, after all, we’re young. Come June, Jacob finally reaches out and asks to hangout, and unknowingly I got a chance to meet her, and even more importantly, I got to know her (both personality wise and her past).

The first thing that struck me was her obscenity in the things she says. Even though we had just met, she was very vocal to both me and another friend who is closest to Jacob, saying things along the lines of, “You guys get bitches? That’s surprising” and, “Jacob isn’t exactly my type based on my history but the more I got to know him the more I found him cute”. While not an atrocity, I just find it strange. Layla is a very outspoken person, and seems to lack any form of social boundaries. She uses homophobic slurs, but it’s okay because she identifies as bisexual, will no exaggeration CONSTANTLY interrupt mid conversation to complain about extremely irrelevant things, blasts volume at maximum capacity on her iPad while we’re watching a movie or show, and constantly belittles other people including myself but plays it off as if she’s joking. She is always complaining about something, and because of this weird power scheme she has over Jacob, he is always forced to say “I’m sorry honey”. She has no water near her? I’m sorry honey. She forgot to start the laundry? I’m sorry honey. She didn’t buy the right cheese for a recipe? I’m sorry honey. ITS NEVER ENDING. Adding to this, they met last September, and since June have been saying I love you, and have brought up marriage. You’ve known this person for less than a year at this point, how is marriage even a feasible thought to you?

She is a high school graduate, and has never worked anywhere besides fast food. Matter of fact, she’s been fired more than she’s quit. I don’t know how he looks past that, but to each their own. Layla more recently got a job at a coffee place, and has taken akin to it, but even then was worried about being fired 2 weeks ago. If asked why, she just gave some generic answer. On top of the job stuff and no further education, she’s never owned a car in her life, and makes Jacob drive her literally everywhere. I was baffled by this. 22 years old, and no form of transportation? I tried to be sympathetic, as she comes from a relatively poor family. Then we did some talking and I realized that she has terrible money spending habits. Doesn’t matter if it’s $10 or $100, she will get it when she’s able. She even admitted that prior to this coffee job, she had never seen a paycheck above $1000. At 22 years old. I could go into more depth but am held back by character limits.

It started last night when my mother had a little too much wine and kept myself and herself up later than either of us should have been; I went to bed before her for once and she didn't get out of bed until 4 p.m. today. I woke up late but I thought for sure I'd get to write at my usual time. Then I had to help Father learn how to use the new washer and dryer. Stupid thing works like a computer. I am not fond of it. Why do I have to change the settings on the thing as if it were a phone in order to access the pin only function? Why the fuck does it have an AI mode? Why the fuck does the AI mode take precedence over the spin only function, so much so that is is the second mode available on the machine while I had to manual make spin only available to me? Ridiculous thing. AI mode was the first thing I disabled and I am not hooking the worthless thing up to my wifi, why the fuck would I want that? It is like T.V. companies started tacking 3.D. mode onto all their products and hopefully the fad dies out just as quickly.

By the time all that was figured out it was almost 4 p.m. I was hopeful I'd get to write at least a little tonight but those hopes are slowly dying because now I am helping set up the new clothes line in the laundry room. It is going well enough aside from the fact that I the damn thing is peeling from the wall under a single towels weight. I swear, the walls in this house are as flimsy as paper. I made have to glue it or something just to keep it stable. 

I am exhausted. I want to write but I also want to cease to exist for a few hours and sadly, you can't do both things at once. How annoying. I do not want to be taking days off when I am this close to being done. I especially don't want to be taking days off without actually getting to relax and feel like it was a 'day off.'

Well, at least I have gotten a lot more than usual done the last few days. Hopefully that makes up for todays lacklustre performance. I am going to make myself a coffee. Hell know's I need it after today. A doughnut could also do me well. Wish me luck in having the energy to get at least a sentence written. Something is always better than nothing.

If you’re in a reading mood and can’t find a good book, I’ve written one for you. Sadly, this is a very true story from this week.

You may have read my other post about not being reimbursed for mileage. If you wanted an update about that, my NPs did agree to pay it, though they don’t feel they should have to. The rest of the meeting, however, didn’t quite make up for that.

I have been in childcare for over 20 years, and I’m confident enough in my experience to say this: I am excellent at my job. I have the education, patience, joy, dedication, and love this work requires. I show up fully every day.

My current NK is 17 months old, has over 60 words, and has already met many 24-month milestones. She is well-regulated, well-adjusted, full of joy & empathy, and is securely attached. I absolutely adore my time with her.

And yet, I’m struggling to love this profession anymore.

This is my third family in a row (each over a year long) where the job is falling apart, not because of the children, but because of parental disrespect and control.

This week, I had a contract renewal meeting with my NPs for year two. A second baby is due soon, so the job is changing significantly. We are still at an impasse over several issues.

# Chapter One: Breaks

Because this job doesn’t guarantee breaks, I use discretion to take brief mental resets during independent play. This may look like texting my adult daughter for 5–10 minutes while remaining attentive to my NK. I’m otherwise rarely on my phone, but this job is isolating, and these moments help me regulate and stay present during long days (often 11 hours).

MB said this was absolutely not allowed. If NK is awake, I’m expected to be “fully engaged” at all times.

I’ve been with this family for a year and have proven myself to be an attentive, engaged caregiver. I am not a teenager. I’m a grown woman with three grown children of my own. Their child is happy, secure, developmentally thriving, and strongly attached to me because of all the one-on-one engagement.

More importantly, independent play is developmentally appropriate for toddlers, and brief periods of rest are essential for caregiver sustainability, especially in jobs with no guaranteed child-free time.

The day after this meeting, my NPs repositioned all five cameras in the house to eliminate blind spots. Given how often we’re out at classes, the library, and activities, this didn’t feel about safety. It felt like control and surveillance. My phone usage is definitely being clocked, and I get passive aggressive feedback reminding me to “rinse potatoes before peeling them.” Meal prep is done during NKs naps and my break time, so knowing even then I’m being monitored is taking a huge toll on my nervous system. After a year of trust being built, surveillance should be lessening, not tightening.

# Chapter Two: Contract Refusal

Last year, I made a mistake by accepting their extremely minimal contract instead of mine. I have never done this with any other family, and the entire year I felt the effects of it. This year, with a second child coming, I asked them to at least review my standard nanny agreement.

They refused to agree to it outright. They told me that this is “not a professional position” and “an over-detailed contract like this isn't needed. It feels overkill on protection, and the document we sent should be more than fine. The rest of the details we can decide as they come up. If we trust each other, then we should act like it.""

I responded with, ""The overprotection you're referring to is my protection. And if you'e so focused on trust and what this document is meant to represent, the fact that you're so worried about agreeing to it tells me a lot. What I sent you is a very standard nanny-employee agreement. Your document only offers protection moving in one direction, and the person who has everything to lose in that agreement is me.“

I asked which parts of the contract raised red flags for them. They told me they did not want to have a policy on snow days (their preference is to figure that out as it comes up), maternity leave expectations (wild since I only put the expectations NPs had for after this new baby is born), and they won’t agree to my breaks section discussed above.

That’s when MB accused me of trying to manipulate them by “sneaking benefits” into the contract and hoping they wouldn’t notice. I was truly confused here.

For reference, I provide sick care so that my NPs do not have to miss time at work. We agreed last year that if I miss time for an illness contracted from my NK, it would not come out of my sick time or PTO, up to five days.

MB claimed I was trying to make illness contracted from their children “unlimited” in my contract because I didn’t specify the 5-day cap in that section. I clarified immediately that I’ve always operated under a cap, I agreed to it last year, and agree to it again this year. If the number wasn’t explicitly written, it was an oversight, not a scheme. She kept insisting that I was trying to deceive them.

I asked her, “How would I even enforce this?” Besides, they track my sick days on a spreadsheet, and I haven’t even used half of mine this year. She didn’t have much to say except, “As long as you weren’t trying to deceive us, but I still feel uncomfortable.” After a full year of honest, professional work, where I don’t even feel comfortable using their coffee and bring my own coffee and milk to make while I am at work.

# Chapter Three: Task Expectations

They expect me to wash bottles used when I’m off the clock, clean weekend messes, and absorb ongoing household tasks justified by “other nannies do it.”

More specifically, and I thought this was an important detail to remember: DB started to justify this and said, ""We have nanny friends--""

MB interrupted, ""No. We have friends with nannies. We don't have nanny friends.""

Wow. Ok.

DB continued, ""And their nannies wash bottles and clean messes from the weekend or from before they got there."" I said that I can't speak for other nannies and what their agreements are. But if they do all of that, it doesn't make it right and certainly doesn't make it a rule. Nannies are also often exploited and taken advantage of, and some don't have enough experience to advocate for themselves. Unfortunately this industry isn't regulated, and it is one of the hardest things about the job. We have no HR, we have no union. We have only ourselves, and with every new family, we have to advocate again and again. On that same note, there are clearly outlined standards that good employers will educate themselves on, and one of the top and most well-known standards is that nannies are only responsible for child-related messes, dishes, and bottles that happen on her watch.

DB interrupted and said, “By that logic, it seems like you’re saying nannies shouldn’t be responsible for clothes that get dirty when they’re not here, so we need two hampers? One for your laundry and one for ours?” I said, “Possibly, because some families don't include laundry as a nanny's task at all. Some don't have any tasks expected except to focus on the care of the child. But if the children’s laundry is part of an agreement, then yes, all of NKs laundry is a nanny's responsibility.” DB then pushed harder and said, ""Well, what else won't you clean? Like these blocks? We’re supposed to clean them up every night if she plays with them before bed?"" I said, ""Setting the nanny's stage so that she can come in and have autonomy over her day - so she can focus her energy on the children while also knowing what her defined roles are for the day outside of childcare is important. Just as I set the stage for you on Friday before I leave (and every other night) to set you up for a successful evening and weekend with your family, the same collaboration should move the other direction as well.""

They disagree fully and that boundary was repeatedly pushed.

On top of all this, their contract lists an extensive scope that goes far beyond core nanny duties. Meal planning, weekly prep for the family, deep cleaning children’s equipment, toy sanitation rotations, household resets for weekends, fridge and freezer management, and more. All while caring for a newborn and toddler.

I’ve repeatedly asked to scale back to core nanny responsibilities and rebuild later when it’s more sustainable. As someone who has spent years caring for multiple children, I’d hope they would defer to me to know what’s possible in a day. I’m not asking for less work. They know I hardly sit still and work very hard. A newborn will also make sure I’m plenty busy.

I’m asking for more time to focus on childcare. Isn’t that why I’m there??

# Chapter Four: Maternity Leave Expectations

MB will be home for six months. I asked whether responsibility might be shared at times, specifically with the idea to allow her time to rest, time to bond with the newborn, and moments of quality time with her older child while I care for the baby.

I was told I should expect full responsibility for both children at all times. I didn’t really think anything of that until she said, “But since you keep fixating on breaks—I’ll be home, so if you need me to take the baby for five minutes, just ask.”

Five minutes. Her newborn.

# Epilogue: Where This Leaves Me

If you’ve made it this far, thank you.

After 20 years, I may be walking away from a career I poured myself into the same way I did with my own children. These environments feel fundamentally different than they used to, and it’s slowly breaking me.

I will not allow my body, my health, my nervous system, or my longevity to be treated as expendable inside someone else’s system.

Maybe it’s just your genes.","If you’ve spent years trying to ""calm down"" your anxiety, it might not be a character flaw. It might be a metabolic bottleneck worsened by caffeine. 

​I found out I’m a slow caffeine metabolizer with the COMT met/met genotype. I got gene testing after a few clues that I might comt met/met to have it confirmed while also finding out caffeine is bad for MY anxiety and MY cardiovascular disease risk (in ppl who have a slow enzyme to break it down).

Here is why that combination makes caffeine a nightmare for ppl like me (and maybe you).

​**The Double Whammy**

​Most people’s bodies are built to process and dump stimulants. If you have these specific genes, your ""cleanup crew"" is very slow.

​CYP1A2 (The Slow Burn): This gene dictates how fast your liver clears caffeine. If you’re a ""slow metabolizer,"" caffeine stays in your system for an eternity. That 8 AM latte is still screaming in your bloodstream at 10 PM.

​COMT Met/Met (The ""Worry Gene""): COMT is the enzyme that clears stress hormones like adrenaline and dopamine. The Met/Met variant is roughly 3–4x slower at this job than average.

​Why this creates a ""Panic Loop""

​When you drink caffeine, you force your body to dump adrenaline.

​Your CYP1A2 keeps the caffeine active, so the ""adrenaline tap"" stays open.

​Your COMT is too slow to mop up the mess.

​The result? You aren't just ""energized."" You are trapped in a biological state of fight and flight that your body literally cannot switch off. While your friends are ""crushing it,"" you’re just trying to remember how to breathe.

​It’s not in your head. It’s in your DNA.

​Many treat caffeine like water. But for some of us, caffeine isn't a performance enhance, it’s a chemical trigger for a nervous system breakdown.

​If you struggle with:

​Heart palpitations hours after coffee

​Intrusive thoughts/overthinking

​""Wired but tired"" insomnia

​Anxiety that feels ""physical"" rather than situational

​Try quitting. Not because of willpower, but because your genetics deserve a break. You might find that the ""anxious person"" you thought you were was just a person whose liver and brain were overworked.

​What to do next:

​Check your raw data: If you’ve done 23andMe or Ancestry, run your data through a tool like foundmyfitness and there are others. ",5,1768703816.0,decaf,2,0.86,False
