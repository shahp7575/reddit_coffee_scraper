1owijy2,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1owijy2/how_addictive_of_a_drug_do_you_consider_caffeine/,How addictive of a drug do you consider caffeine to be?,"As the title states, how addictive do you consider caffeine to be and how do you think it ranks in relation to other drugs? 

I find myself wondering this as the past couple days I have recently cut down my caffeine usage from around 2.5 - 3 cups to 1. I was thinking I wouldn’t feel like this as I am tapering this time and have failed in the past trying to go cold turkey, but while still consuming a cup and only being on the second day of that, I already feel like I complete shit. Anxiety has been less, with the past couple days being the first time in a while I didn’t feel ridiculously anxious at work, but I am have had a headache both evenings and am already getting those familiar feelings of depression and low mood that I get every time I try to quit. I just want to wake up and have two cups of coffee, and badly.

The first few times I tried quitting I only consumed 1-1.5 cups, but since upping to 2.5-3, quitting has felt so much more difficult. The feelings of low mood and depression just get ridiculous and it starts to feel like I’ll never be happy again unless I have coffee. 

I’ve quit multiple substances including weed and alcohol in the past and neither compare to caffeine, though I was never really addicted to alcohol. It’s leading me to believe that caffeine may be the most addictive drug in the world. This is considering all aspects and not just psychological and physical dependence. Cultural and abundance also play a role. Coffee shops are literally everywhere and literally almost everyone drinks it. I have to just watch people drink it all day in my office, which isn’t the case for almost all other drugs as one mostly has to actively seek them out.

I have had a very complicated relationship with sugar all my life. When I was young, I was given tons of candy, chocolate, soda, and so on. When I started getting older, I noticed that sugar and caffeine was correlated with my migraines. I have successfully cut out the major caffeine sources (coffee etc), but sugar is much harder for me. I go through spurts of not having any processed sugar for months and then other time I eat way too much. The constant up and down is just not good for my mental health or body.

While I didn’t like it in my coffee, can confirm it’s absolutely delicious in bread pudding!!! No whiskey or bourbon needed, just this!

Sharing my recipe for anyone interested:

6 slices of old bread ripped into chunks (I had French bread)
1 cup heavy cream
1 cup milk (I had 2%)
4 eggs
1/2 cup sugar (I used brown)
1 tablespoon bourbon vanilla extract
1 tsp cinnamon
Sprinkle of salt

Layer bread in a buttered pan
Whisk eggs first then add everything else
Pour over bread
Bake 45min at 350F

Bourbon vanilla sauce:

1/2 cup heavy cream
1/4 cup milk
1/2 cup sugar
1 tablespoon bourbon vanilla extract
2 tablespoons cornstarch (less or more depending on your preference of consistency)
I also added some TJ’s bourbon vanilla paste just to get the vanilla specks

Heat heavy cream, milk, sugar until sugar dissolves
Add cornstarch 
Add extract
Stir/heat until desired consistency

1owig4w,https://i.redd.it/5dbtw66oe41g1.jpeg,Grinder works fine at coarser settings but clogs at finer settings [Baratza ESP Pro],"Been wanting to join the cool kids club for a while now and finally got the chance to. I was able to snag both of these on sale so the whole set up was $439. The next step being some accessory upgrades. If anyone has recommendations for those I’m all ears.

I do have a question for the group, or at least anyone who also has the Baratza ESP Pro. The grinder worked perfectly fine when I was using it to make coffee in my Chemex. However, when I turn it to a finer setting for espresso, it grinds some of the beans and then it seems like it clogs. My wife, whose mom used to own a coffee shop and who worked as a barista all throughout college, seems to think maybe we just need to season the burrs.

Curious to hear any thoughts on this. Seeing as how it worked perfectly fine at a coarser setting, could it just need to be seasoned? Is this normal? If it does need seasoning is there an optimal way to do this? I’d love to not have to return this and get a different grinder, but if that’s the case then so be it. Anyone else with this grinder have this issue?",1,1763081560.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

 **1. Shinsekai’s deep-cut kushikatsu joints**

Step one block off the tourist path and you’ll find tiny counters where the batter is lighter and the crowd is 100% local. Beef tendon + lotus root = unbeatable.

 **2. Tenma’s ramen-and-izakaya maze**

Endless alleys, standing bars, and late-night ramen. It’s chaotic in the best way, perfect for casual bar hopping.

**3. Tamade’s ultra-local comfort food**

A bit rough around the edges but packed with Osaka character. Oden, nikusui, homemade karaage — pure comfort.

**4. Kuromon Market (only off-peak!)**

Go early morning or late afternoon for actual conversations with vendors. You’ll find better uni + toro deals and way fewer crowds.

 **5. Nakazaki-cho’s indie cafés**

Renovated warehouses with roasted coffee, soufflé pancakes, and seasonal parfaits. Chill spot between heavier food runs.

1owieos,https://www.reddit.com/r/stuffyouneeddaily/comments/1owieos/when_is_the_best_time_to_buy_smart_plugs/,When is the best time to buy smart plugs?,"Hey everyone!

So I've been getting asked a lot lately about when to actually pull the trigger on smart plugs. I get it – nobody wants to buy something today and see it 40% off next week. Let me break down what I've learned after watching prices for the past couple years.

**Black Friday and Cyber Monday are still king**

Look, I know it sounds obvious, but November is genuinely the best time. Smart plugs regularly drop to like $5-8 each during Black Friday sales when they're normally $15-25. I grabbed a 4-pack last year for under $20 and felt like I robbed the place.

**Prime Day in July is your summer option**

If you can't wait until November, Amazon Prime Day usually has solid deals too. Not quite as good as Black Friday, but you'll still save 30-40% if you time it right. Just make sure you're actually getting a deal and not falling for fake ""original prices.""

**End of month clearances**

Here's something most people miss – a lot of retailers clear out inventory at month's end. I've scored random deals just by checking around the 28th-30th of any given month. It's not guaranteed, but I've definitely stumbled into some surprise discounts.

**When NOT to buy**

January through March? Prices are usually trash. Everyone just spent their holiday budget, so stores know they can keep prices high. Same goes for back-to-school season in August and September.

**My honest recommendation**

If you need smart plugs right now for a specific project, just buy them. The convenience and energy savings add up quick. But if you're just thinking about upgrading your home, wait for the next major sale event.

I usually check [this page](https://goodhomedeals.com/smart-plugs) when I'm shopping around since it shows current prices and helps me compare different brands without opening 50 tabs.

**Quick buying tips:**

- Get multi-packs – they're always cheaper per unit
- Check if you need WiFi or Bluetooth (WiFi is more versatile)
- Make sure they work with your voice assistant
- Read reviews about the app – a crappy app ruins everything

The smart home stuff doesn't have to be expensive or complicated. I started with just two smart plugs on my living room lamps, and now half my house runs on them. They're especially awesome for things like fans, coffee makers, and holiday lights.

If you're ready to start shopping, [here's where I usually look](https://goodhomedeals.com/smart-plugs) for the current best options.

Bottom line? If there's a sale happening now, go for it. If not, mark your calendar for Prime Day or Black Friday and save yourself some cash. Your wallet will thank you.

* The main entrance is flanked by 2 floor to ceiling glass windows on each side (filling the space where the old garage door used to be).
* There are only two outlets.
* There is one forced air heater that cannot be blocked by anything.
* There is a strip of tile at the front of the room (shaded), the rest is laminate. The tile is a little higher than the rest of the floor.
* I would like this tile area to be where people take off their shoes, before going further into the room or apartment.
* Immediately to the left of the main entrance is a door leading to the rest of the apartment.
* The window on the right wall is about halfway up the wall.
* I do not want my desk under this window directly (I don't want debris blowing in from there, onto my computer)

I would like advice on furniture layout and recommended furniture size. I'm not sure how big of a couch, coffee table, or desk to get. Or what shapes.

I have not decided if I want to divide the room with the Kallax, or put it against the far wall (this is the only wall it can go against).

I currently have a shoe bench on the left wall blocking the outlet. I don't like it there but I don't know where else to put it.

I have a lot of stuff, so storage is very important and I would prefer furniture that has storage.

I think some customers need to understand that sometimes it is not the broistas fault for the line taking a long time and rather the people in front of them. Yes you might see 4 people working on drinks, but there are specific bars for different ways of ordering and when one of them is backed up, the drive thru will take a bit more time (Due to a bar being down). Some customers will order a very specific coffee drink and sometimes it’ll take some extra time because of the add ons.

## ***Maudheim Station, Queen Maud's Land, Antarctica - Winter, 1950***
---


&nbsp;

Bitterness. A coffee so pitch black, staring into it seems to transport you away from Maudheim and into an alien world. Perhaps it's a glimpse into the world, monochrome black and devoid of sweetness, that produces the sounds and all-seeing eyes the crew report at night. Though honestly, Rolf Grünenwald would probably still drink it greedily - it is one of the few lifelines keeping him from following Christer into the howling night.

&nbsp;

Ever since Christer disappeared, leaving some woodcarvings, a photo of his wife, and a nicely worn shirt that unfortunately was one size too small for Rolf, the disturbances to the peace and health of Maudheim have only grown. Last Winter was bitter & depressing, but it might as well have been a warm summer picnic compared to the current situation. Initially stable crew were now constantly reporting shapes moving in the distance, especially at night, as well as organ pipes & cello strings being played seemingly close to them. Previously friendly crew have begun isolating, especially after the makeshift memorial to Christer disappeared during the wind storm & a quarter of the roof of the main depot blew off. Shortly after, there was nearly a diplomatic incident as one of the newer Norwegian geologists accused the British and Swiss teams of stealing food during the debacle. Most chalked it up to paranoia, but the Norwegian's description of what happened - a shadowy mass with a sack trundling off in 50 mile per hour winds towards the Anglo-Swiss cabins - shook Rolf. 

&nbsp;

He and Lugano, the damn Italo-Swiss bastard, were holed up together during that storm, in the weather hut between the Swiss and British cabins. Just as it seemed the orchestra of hell was going to blow the whole station away, Lugano screamed that he saw someone outside - another shadowy mass - but this was different. This time, Rolf saw the damn thing as well, for less than a second, almost totally obscured by the snow but for a large burlap sack. 

&nbsp;

Of course it was just a group delusion, Christer was surely dead in a snow pile somewhere and the crew suffering from the affects of Antarctica's extreme winter, but knowing that was of cold comfort. It didn't help unsettling dream diaries discussing being watched by eyes of pure darkness for a week straight or the latest Maudheim crew coming to discuss with the one station psychologist how they swear they are being watched by ominous forces at night and how wood & tools left out disappear without a trace. Blown off by the wind, no doubt, but that explanation doesn't stop the primordial feeling in the deepest recesses of Rolf's mind that _something is deeply wrong._

&nbsp;

Rolf let his rational side rest for a moment, indulging in that feeling. Three people seeing a figure in a sack running into the blistering winds. Helping with emergency repairs at the dead of night only to walk back and see fresh boot prints leading to Christer's nearly blown over cabin, then there being no trace of them in the morning. The increasingly present but barely perceptible melody at night, begging its listeners to join the howling winds. Seeing blackness shift near the window at the farthest reaches of your peripheral vision. The vague masses and figures crew claim to be watching them, always in the distance, always still, but never a trace. Continual dreams from multiple crew members of a black presence amongst the howling winds and snowfall - of black eyes that never leave once they see you. Even the most confident and cocky amongst the crew demanding a buddy or rifle if they have to go out at night. Even Lugano, a hardened mechanic who could probably lift half the crew with one hand, refused to get more firewood alone at dusk.

&nbsp;

It all has to be tricks of the mind, **it has to be....**

&nbsp;

As winter fades, all that is on Rolf's mind is the supply ship taking him home. Away from _it._ Even if there is no entity and Christer is just a well preserved corpse in a ravine, Maudheim had summoned its own malevolent force. There is something unnatural there, that comes out only when God's light withdraws. That pries at men's minds until it finds a weakness. Only the bitter coffee and a mind that refuses to believe have kept Rolf going. Like half of the crew, he can barely sleep for more than a few hours at a time, always waking and feeling disquieted. Covering up windows to stop _it_ from staring. Trying to remember the banging on the window is just the wind.

&nbsp;

As with all the lifers (those who had been on base for a year), Rolf was sapped of willpower and energy at the end of his tour. His successor, upon meeting Rolf at the docks, was shocked to see the deep bags under his eyes, a total lack of energy, and moving everything else along at a fever pitch just to get on the boat. The notes Rolf left were scantly better, starting as professional notes on the sleep and mood study, then devolving into documenting the nightmares and hallucinations of the crew, eventually ending in declaring evil spirits had infested the base. Saying that *it* was scratching at the window, begging him to come outside. 

&nbsp;

Jürg vowed to bring sanity to this place, or at least discover what is causing this group psychosis. He knows what he must do to bring this men out of this.

There was also a situation where she was getting through a tight place (i just happened to be there so i excused myself and she smiled a bit but kinda avoided eye contact like she was nervous).

I was thinking since tomorrow is the last day i will see her its best i try to ask if she be interested. Would asking a girl on a coffee date okay is my question (not my strong forte so hence why i wanna ask). I just wanna avoid looking like a creep or scarring her.

I took some shrooms a lil while back and they put me threw a time loop and a mind death and it starts with just me getting my shrooms this day and I was making my coffee this morning when I got a text form my girlfriend at the time before I opened it I took the 3.5 with my coffee .she was scared she was pregnant just thought she really was and make it seem I was legit and as high as I already was on my cart I rolled a blunt and was chiefing the shit out of it because I was nervous and instead of just calming my mind I ran with the nervous like a beginner .
I came to my room in a rush and was just trying to watch anything but my vision started getting funkin and the world transforms and while this was happening and just being mad asf cuz I couldn't put anything on I tried to calm down and took a shower but during the shower the water felt like it was speaking and I  was hearing everything that's gonna happen to me and what all my outcomes and main one is gonna be .
And then I remembered my gf telling me about he kid and that went down drain and came right back to being nervous and broke the shower accidentally .
Finally I forced my self to sleep and in the dream I seen sixs out comes one happen and two was future and past kinda .
Now it started with my future and it was dark and I saw me and my gf turning to heroine with me and the other was me in my future alone making it to middle lower class finally and a simple house and family happy but with out my gf and my family was finally at peace dont get me wrong my mother stressed over anything as always and brothers just being assholes but good nun the less and seeing that I felt my soul I think or nerves like leave my body and I die kinda like I and in the dark of death but I see that the same time nothing but my past and ever out come that would happen in this it. It was cold but the cold hold of death felt calming like the realization your drowning and excepting it while the world goes black and after a hour of just all this random shi it finally came back half way but this is where idk what the fuck happen .
I fell from the sky and slowed and fell in to my body and the world reversed and I mean everything all that worked was my eyes and I saw everything. 
My breathing was firsted it was forced back in my lungs and then my body started rolling and my legs was freaking out.
Finally my entire body did so ninja shi and just on to my after to get of mt bed and I went to take my mom's food that was full and went down stairs and that was weird most of all with the cereal goin back in the box so easily and the milk flew right back in then it went black then it started back but earlier and my lil baby brother woke up so I  makeingmaking her the cereal for my mom and bringing it back up and all that . 
After all that I finally woke up in reality and it was horrifying I felt and seen and hear and smelled all that could and would happen and gave me such a bad mind set until I went to the psych ward and got my mind back in shape and still have lil blur reminders of that night .
Worth it in ever way for I could find my roots of my problems and of my self .

And this was the worst experience btw

There have been a lot of posts, comments, and replies on our customer service and how it's changed (or declined 😓) over the last few months, so I figured it was a good time to share an update.

First, I'd like to start off by saying that if you're still waiting on a response from our CS team, feel free to send me a DM with your email or order number so I can escalate your inquiry and ensure we get you taken care of promptly.

Next, let's talk about what's been going on over on the Peak Design CS side...

|Current First Response Time|Current Handle Times|CSAT Rating|
|:-|:-|:-|
|36 hours\~|00:07:12 (hh:mm:ss)|86% 🙂|

# Response times (current wait 36 hrs):

This is a hot topic right now, and trust me, we're not unfamiliar with the pain points or challenges that our slower response times in the last couple of months has done to the overall experience and expectation our community has come to know around our customer service.

The TLDR is; we got SLAMMED. **REALLY**, ***really*** slammed.

We made some changes to our Lifetime Warranty process to make it smoother and easier than ever for our customers to quickly register their gear and submit a claim. We also launched two major Kickstarter products between April and July, and I think we may have (slightly)  simply underestimated just how much of a ride we were in for when it came to everyone's questions, clarifications, concerns, and all the while still handling our standard load of order-related inquiries and navigating through a whole new process with warranty.

This kind've put us in quite the predicament, but our team worked (and continues to work) diligently to get through everyone's questions and concerns as quickly as humanly possible.

It wasn't enough... so in the last few weeks we've been hiring new members to join our team, quickly ramping up on training, and allotting overtime hours to our staff to try our best at getting caught up. At one point, our oldest ticket was 20 days old. Yeah, you read that right. **(yikes.)**

But I am proud to say that we're ***finally*** seeing the light at the end of the tunnel, and as of this week, our oldest conversation is a little over *3 days old*. Which means you should be getting a much faster response and resolution from our team moving forward.

# What else are we doing to help?

We're currently still onboarding more qualified and exceptional members to our team to not only continue to keep our steady groove, but also to help carry out this momentum through the holiday season. We're also looking at other tools for future implementation that can help us get you serviced faster.

Morale is still very high, and we're all still in great spirits despite this bump in the road. But we're still working in overdrive. So if you could, please be kind to our staff as we're running on **TONS** of coffee and mostly adrenaline at this point. If you have a few seconds, show your agent some love and a little extra kindness, cause they could really use it (*and* *coffee can only go so far*).

We appreciate everyone's patience as we continue to work through our queue to get back to everyone as quickly as we can!

Much love always,

In his younger years he had gotten addicted to opiates and alcohol and luckily has not touched either in years but I’ve noticed since being with him for the last 3 years when he finds something he likes he will go on a binger as I call it and get completely obsessed with it whether it be a certain food or drink or even video game. Luckily after a few months each time he won’t touch any of it again for a long time if ever. He grabbed a redbull from the store a few months back and now I’ve noticed he’s hooked but hasn’t let up on them yet. He will drink upwards of 4 a day most being the large/medium sized ones and he’s currently off work from having a surgery so he bums money off of me for them which I didn’t mind when he was having even one a day or every other day but that isn’t the case. I’ve brought it up to him that it bothers me but he still continues and for a few weeks he dropped it to 1/2 a day and supplemented with a few cups of coffee instead at home. Now he is back to 2/3 a day and having multiple cups of coffee. Yes the amount of money he is spending bothers me some but I worry about his health I assume having that much every single day from the minute you wake up until you go to bed isn’t healthy. I just want to know if I am overreacting and need to leave it alone or if it’s fair for me to genuinely get mad that he will not stop drinking so many. I look online and some places say it’s not healthy and others say it’s fine I just want to make sure he’s not risking himself to harmful effects when he’s older. I don’t want to be controlling but this is something that is genuinely getting under my skin. I don’t know what to do it’s driving me crazy. ,1,1763080572.0,relationship_advice,4,1.0,False
1owi3ba,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1owi3ba/aitah_for_not_reminding_him_he_shouldnt_have_too/,AITAH for not reminding him he shouldn’t have too much sugar?,"My brother in law(26) and I(28m) go way back. We attended the same university where I tutored him in English so he could pass their English skill development course(most of the top universities in our country require first year students to take an English course). These days we go jogging together on Saturdays.

He doesn’t have diabetes but when he went to the hospital for a health check up he was told he has high blood sugar. His vice was vanilla latte. His favorite coffee shop already uses three pumps of vanilla syrup but he also paid for an extra shot of the syrup. So he slowly changed his habit. First stopped paying for an extra shot. Then he asked for two pumps instead of three and then only one pump. Eventually got to the point where he was drinking only normal latte.

Yesterday he decided to have a vanilla latte though. Requested for two pumps instead of three, before telling me he’s earned a little treat(We had just completed a three mile jog together). I didn’t say anything.

When my sister saw the receipt, she got upset at him and then me. She said I could have talked him out of it, since he still looks up to me. We do have a seniority system/hierarchical structure in our country which contributes to this. Given that I was an older student who helped him, even though it was only for one course/semester, he does still see me as a ‘senior’ even though I’m only two years older. Am I wrong for not reminding him?

For years, I dealt with chronic fatigue, brain fog, and just a general feeling of being **""off.""** I tried all the usual fixes: more coffee, better sleep hygiene, and every popular energy vitamin on the market. Nothing worked long-term. It felt like my body was running on 50% capacity, and I couldn't understand why.

My research eventually led me down a different path: the **Pineal Gland**. Often called the ""Third Eye,"" this tiny gland controls melatonin (sleep) and is frequently cited as a key to overall **body function and energy regulation**. The theory is that toxins (like fluoride) can cause calcification, leading to low energy and poor function.

# 2. The Shift: Focusing on the Pineal Gland

I decided to try a supplement specifically designed to support this area, called **Pineal 10X**. It’s marketed to help:

* **Support Healthy Body Function:** Getting the core systems back into sync.
* **Promote Proper Pineal Gland Function:** Addressing the potential 'calcification' issue.
* **Support Energy Levels:** The practical outcome everyone wants.

I was highly skeptical, but I figured I had nothing to lose. I committed to taking it daily for one month.

# 3. My 30-Day Results Breakdown

The results were more holistic than just a caffeine boost:

* **Week 1 (Initial Change):** Noticed an immediate improvement in **sleep quality**. Waking up feeling genuinely rested, not groggy. This was the first sign that my body's internal clock was resetting.
* **Week 2 (Energy & Focus):** The daytime energy followed the better sleep. Less of the 3 PM crash and significantly improved **mental clarity**. The brain fog started to lift.
* **Week 3+ (Overall Function):** Beyond physical energy, I felt a noticeable uplift in mood and focus. I felt more *connected* and in control, which is what supporters of the pineal gland often describe as ""spiritual clarity.""

For me, supporting this often-ignored gland was the **missing link** to fixing my energy and overall well-being.

# 4. Full Disclosure and Where to Learn More (Your Link)

If you've tried everything else for fatigue and brain fog, this might be the overlooked piece of the puzzle. I highly recommend checking out the full presentation to understand the science behind pineal gland function and how this formula works.

Smoked for 40 years, never took care of himself. He was living alone in a small shitty town and has to live with us because he can’t afford to live in a senior living community and can no longer live alone. I thought it would be ok and looked forward to helping him while he undergoes cancer surgeries. It’s not ok. We bend over backwards to help take care of him, cook all of his meals, clean his laundry- But what about when he’s demanding, refuses to do anything for himself, leaves a mess wherever he goes, and is totally inconsiderate? it’s beyond caregiving when he treats us like we should wait on him. It also sucks because he refuses to take care of himself. For instance, one week before he had surgery to have 1/3 of his lung removed, I caught him smoking cigarettes which he later lied to my husband about . He’s pre-diabetic but won’t stop dumping 3 tspb of sugar into multiple cups of coffee a day , buying cookies and sugary things. It’s like he just doesn’t care and we are trying so hard to keep him alive. He won’t sleep with his door closed and then complains about the noise when I get up early. I told my husband that if he becomes insulin-dependent and develops full-blown diabetes, he needs to go into nursing care because I just don’t think we can help him with that. I feel so guilty- please tell me I’m not an asshole even though I probably am an asshole. ",20,1763079889.0,AgingParents,12,0.96,False

I am looking for fermented rye malt, which is often called for in Eastern European or Russian-style bread recipes, but I am unsure what it is called in German. Is it “Roggenmalz,” “Roggenmalzmehl,” “Röstmalz,” or something else?



My other question is where to find it in Berlin. I once bought something similar from Mehlstübchen, but it was lighter in colour than what fermented rye malt is usually described as — more like the colour of coffee.

1owhp08,https://www.reddit.com/r/AI_Prompt_Garage/comments/1owhp08/15_best_sora_2_prompts_ultimate_guide_to_creating/,15 Best Sora 2 Prompts: Ultimate Guide to Creating Viral AI Videos,"Creating stunning AI-generated videos with Sora 2 requires more than just basic instructions. To unlock the full potential of OpenAI's Sora video generation model, you need to master the art of AI video prompting. This comprehensive Sora 2 prompt guide will help you craft detailed prompts that produce cinematic, professional-quality content.

# What Makes a Great Sora 2 Prompt?

Before diving into our best Sora prompts, let's understand what makes a prompt effective. Sora 2 is OpenAI's advanced AI video generation model that interprets text descriptions to create high-fidelity visual content. The quality of your output depends heavily on how well you describe the scene.

**Key Elements of Effective Prompts:**

* **Specific camera framing** (wide shot, medium shot, close-up)
* **Lighting details** (golden hour, window light, warm lamp fill)
* **Camera movement** (tracking shot, tilt, static)
* **Visual tone** and color palette
* **Subject action** and environmental context
* **Technical specifications** (depth of field, film grain, lensing)

# 15 Best Sora 2 Prompts for Viral Videos

# 1. Cinematic Product Showcase

 

    A rotating close-up of a vintage leather watch on a marble surface, shot with shallow depth of field. Golden hour rays of sunlight stream through a nearby window, creating dramatic shadows. The camera performs a slow 360-degree tracking shot while maintaining focus on the watch's detailed craftsmanship. Warm color palette with amber and bronze tones. Cinematic film grain texture.

**Why it works:** This prompt combines specific camera movement, lighting conditions, and visual tone to create professional product photography suitable for short-form video content.

# 2. Nature Documentary Style

 

    Wide shot of a lone wolf walking through a misty forest at dawn. Soft blue morning light filters through tall pine trees in the foreground. The camera follows with a slow tracking shot, maintaining the wolf in medium shot as it moves between trees. Faint hum of forest ambiance. Cool color palette dominated by blues and grays. High visual fidelity with natural film grain.

**Why it works:** This Sora 2 prompt uses environmental storytelling and atmospheric details to create documentary-quality footage.

# 3. Urban Lifestyle Content

 

    Handheld medium shot of a young woman walking through a busy Tokyo street at night. Neon signs reflect in puddles on wet pavement. The camera follows her with slight tilt and sway, creating authentic street photography feel. Color anchors: vibrant pinks, electric blues, and warm orange streetlights. Background traffic hiss and city ambiance. Grainy, documentary-style aesthetic.

**Why it works:** The prompt balances technical camera details with sensory atmosphere, perfect for viral videos on social platforms.

# 4. Food Photography Magic

 

    Extreme close-up of honey being drizzled onto a stack of golden pancakes in slow motion. Window light from the left creates soft highlights on the syrup's surface. Shallow depth of field keeps the foreground pancakes sharp while the background blurs into warm bokeh. Warm color palette with golden yellows and rich browns. 35mm film aesthetic with subtle film grain.

**Why it works:** This detailed prompt leverages depth of field and lighting to create mouth-watering content ideal for food content creators.

# 5. Sci-Fi Cinematic Scene

 

    Wide establishing shot of a lone astronaut standing on a rust-colored Martian landscape. The camera slowly cranes up from ground level to reveal a massive terraforming dome in the distance. Dramatic sunset lighting casts long shadows across the rocky terrain. Color palette: deep oranges, dusty reds, and cool blue sky gradient. Cinematic anamorphic lens with characteristic horizontal flares.

**Why it works:** Combines camera framing, camera move, and lensing details to achieve blockbuster-quality visuals.

# 6. Minimalist Product Animation

 

    A single red rose rotates slowly against a pure white background. Overhead soft-box lighting creates gentle highlights on each petal. The camera maintains a static medium shot with perfect center framing. One subject action: the rose completes one full rotation in 10 seconds. High-key lighting with minimal shadows. Clean, commercial aesthetic with no film grain.

**Why it works:** Simplicity and precision make this template perfect for elegant brand content.

# 7. Retro Aesthetic Vibes

 

    Medium shot of a vintage record player in a cozy apartment corner. Warm lamp fill creates ambient glow while natural window light provides key lighting. The camera performs a subtle push-in from medium to close-up on the spinning vinyl. Hand-drawn vintage poster visible in soft focus background. Color palette: warm sepia tones, faded oranges, and muted greens. VHS-style grain and slight color bleeding.

**Why it works:** This prompt uses nostalgic visual elements perfect for creating content that resonates with retro-loving audiences.

# 8. Action Sports Sequence

 

    Tracking shot following a skateboarder performing a kickflip down a city staircase. The camera matches the subject's speed with dynamic handheld movement. High-contrast lighting from harsh midday sun creates dramatic shadows. Frozen moment at apex of jump before landing. Wide-angle lens perspective (24mm equivalent). Desaturated color palette with emphasis on concrete grays and sky blues.

**Why it works:** Dynamic camera framing and one camera move create excitement and energy.

# 9. Atmospheric Portrait

 

    Close-up portrait of an elderly craftsman working in his wood workshop. Dust particles float through shafts of window light creating visible rays of sunlight. Shallow depth of field isolates the subject's weathered hands and focused expression. Background tools blur into warm bokeh. Color anchors: rich wood browns, golden light, deep shadows. 85mm portrait lens aesthetic with creamy bokeh.

**Why it works:** This Sora 2 AI video prompt balances technical photography terms with emotional storytelling.

# 10. Abstract Art Exploration

 

    Macro close-up of oil paint mixing on a palette in slow motion. Vivid color palette: electric blue colliding with vibrant magenta and golden yellow. The camera slowly tilts down while maintaining sharp focus on the paint interaction. Dramatic side lighting creates texture and dimension. No depth of field - everything in crystalline focus. High saturation and contrast for maximum visual impact.

**Why it works:** Perfect for creative content, this prompt gives the model freedom while maintaining control and consistency.

# 11. Cozy Interior Scene

 

    Slow dolly shot moving through a warmly lit coffee shop during blue hour. Foreground customers in soft focus while the camera pulls focus to a steaming cup of latte in medium shot. Window light mixes with warm interior lamps creating layered lighting. Faint hum of coffee machine and murmured conversation. Color palette: warm amber, soft cream, deep chocolate browns. Cinematic film grain with slight halation.

**Why it works:** Layered visual tone and ambient sound details create immersive atmosphere.

# 12. Time-Lapse Cityscape

 

    Wide shot of city skyline transitioning from dusk to night. The camera remains static as lights gradually illuminate buildings. Color palette shifts from golden hour oranges to deep blue night with scattered yellow building lights. Smooth, accelerated time passage showing traffic trails as light streaks. Clean, high-fidelity render without grain for modern commercial feel.

**Why it works:** Time-based transformation creates dynamic content from a single camera position.

# 13. Whimsical Animation Style

 

    Hand-drawn animation aesthetic of a paper airplane floating through a stylized office environment. The camera follows with playful swooping movements matching the plane's flight path. Soft pastel color palette: sky blue, peachy pink, mint green. Background elements in simplified geometric shapes. Slight texture overlay suggesting watercolor paper. Lighthearted, dreamlike visual fidelity.

**Why it works:** This prompt demonstrates how to use Sora 2 for stylized, non-photorealistic content.

# 14. Documentary Interview Setup

 

    Medium shot of subject seated in natural interview position, slightly off-center following rule of thirds. Three-point lighting: soft key light from window on left, warm lamp fill on right, subtle hair light separating subject from background. Shallow depth of field with background bookshelves in soft bokeh. Static camera with professional studio aesthetic. Neutral color palette with slight warmth.

**Why it works:** Professional lighting and camera framing knowledge embedded in the prompt.

# 15. Surreal Dream Sequence

 

    Slow-motion wide shot of a figure walking through a field of oversized flowers under a purple twilight sky. The camera performs a dreamy crane movement, rising and circling the subject. Ethereal lighting with no clear source, creating even, magical illumination. Color palette: lavender purples, soft pinks, mint greens. Soft focus with subtle bloom effect. Otherworldly, fantastical visual tone.

**Why it works:** Shows how detailed prompts can achieve artistic, non-realistic aesthetics.

# Advanced Sora 2 Prompt Guide: Best Practices

# Use the Storyboard Approach

When creating longer content, think in terms of a storyboard. Break your vision into a second clip sequence, describing continuity across shots. This helps maintain control and consistency throughout your AI video generation.

**Example structure:**

1. **Opening:** Describe the scene and establishing shot
2. **Development:** One subject action or camera move
3. **Resolution:** Final framing and visual tone

# Leverage API Parameters

If you're using OpenAI's API to access Sora 2 Pro, you can enhance your prompts with technical API parameters:

* **Duration:** Specify exact length
* **Resolution:** Define output quality
* **Style presets:** Choose from cinematic, documentary, commercial templates
* **Iteration controls:** Refine outputs through controlled changes

# Write Prompts Like a Director

Professional filmmakers use specific terminology. Incorporating this language helps let the model understand your creative vision:

**Camera terminology:**

* Shot types: establishing, wide shot, medium shot, close-up, extreme close-up
* Camera movement: static, pan, tilt, dolly, crane, tracking shot, handheld
* Lensing: 24mm wide-angle, 50mm normal, 85mm portrait, macro

**Lighting terms:**

* Natural: golden hour, blue hour, window light, overcast
* Artificial: warm lamp fill, key light, rim light, practical lights
* Quality: soft, hard, diffused, dramatic

**Color guidance:**

* Specific palettes: monochromatic, complementary, analogous
* Color anchors: dominant hues that define the mood
* Temperature: warm (amber, orange) vs. cool (blue, teal)

# Common Mistakes to Avoid

# 1. Vague Descriptions

❌ ""A beautiful sunset""  
✅ ""Wide shot of ocean sunset with golden hour lighting, warm orange and pink color palette, gentle waves in foreground, cinematic film grain""

# 2. Conflicting Instructions

❌ ""Close-up wide shot"" (contradictory)  
✅ ""Wide shot with a subject in close-up framing in the foreground""

# 3. Overloading the Prompt

While detailed prompts are valuable, longer prompts aren't always better. Focus on essential elements rather than listing every possible detail. Give the model some creative freedom.

# 4. Ignoring Technical Feasibility

Avoid physically impossible scenarios like ""camera moves through solid walls"" unless you're specifically aiming for a fresh take on physics-defying content.

# How to Use Sora 2 for Different Content Types

# For Social Media (TikTok, Reels, YouTube Shorts)

Short-form video requires immediate visual impact:

* Start with attention-grabbing visuals
* Use dynamic camera movement
* Incorporate trending color palettes
* Keep prompts focused on one subject action
* Suggest pacing through camera speed descriptors

# For Commercial Content

Professional brand work demands consistency:

* Maintain clean, high visual fidelity
* Use controlled lighting descriptions
* Specify exact color anchors matching brand guidelines
* Employ professional camera framing
* Minimize grain unless vintage aesthetic is desired

# For Artistic Projects

Creative work benefits from experimental prompts:

* Describe the scene with emotional language
* Mix realistic and surreal elements
* Experiment with unusual color palette combinations
* Try non-standard camera angles
* Embrace AI-generated creative variations

# Optimizing Your Prompts for Sora 2 Videos

# The Iteration Process

Creating viral videos rarely happens on the first try. Here's a systematic approach:

1. **Start broad:** Write a basic prompt describing your core vision
2. **Add technical details:** Layer in camera, lighting, and color information
3. **Test and refine:** Generate, review, and note what needs adjustment
4. **Make controlled changes:** Modify one element at a time to understand its impact
5. **Finalize:** Once satisfied, save your prompt as a template for future use

# Using ChatGPT to Refine Prompts

Since both ChatGPT and Sora come from OpenAI, you can use ChatGPT to help craft better Sora prompts:

**Example conversation:**

* ""Help me describe a moody coffee shop scene for Sora 2""
* ""Add professional lighting terms to make it more cinematic""
* ""Suggest a color palette that creates a cozy atmosphere""

This collaborative approach helps you learn the art of AI video prompting while improving your results.

# Technical Specifications Worth Knowing

# Depth of Field Control

Understanding shallow depth of field vs. deep focus:

* **Shallow:** Subject sharp, background blurred (portraits, products)
* **Deep:** Everything in focus (landscapes, architectural shots)

# Film Grain and Texture

* **Minimal grain:** Clean, modern commercial aesthetic
* **Moderate grain:** Cinematic film quality
* **Heavy grain:** Vintage, nostalgic, or grainy documentary feel

# Aspect Ratios and Framing

While not always specified in prompts, understanding standard ratios helps:

* **16:9** \- Standard YouTube, landscape content
* **9:16** \- Vertical social media (TikTok, Instagram Reels)
* **1:1** \- Square format for feed posts
* **21:9** \- Ultra-wide cinematic

# Conclusion: Mastering Prompts for Sora 2

The best Sora prompts combine technical precision with creative vision. By incorporating specific camera framing, detailed lighting descriptions, intentional color palettes, and clear subject actions, you'll create AI video content that stands out.

Winnie is a 5-month-old female golden doodle and she is one hungry puppers; gaining just over 14 pounds in the 3 months we've had her (weighed today at the vet at 24.4 lbs).  She will literally eat anything you put in front of her - if she can get her mouth on it.

Given this, we've been very careful about what we leave out, and are feeding her only fish-based puppy chow, along with non-rawhide chew sticks, 1-calorie training treats, etc.  But - the super weird thing is that she seems to **LOVE** (at least the smell of) coffee!

We know it's not good for her and she hasn't actually eaten/drunk any, but every morning when my wife and I are drinking our cup of coffee, she is on it like white on rice - begging for a sip, trying to find a way of getting a piece of that action.

Has anyone else here experienced this?  Seems a bit atypical, just wanting to know if we're/she's an outlier.",11,1763079455.0,puppies,4,0.92,False
1owhno6,https://www.reddit.com/r/theology/comments/1owhno6/about_absolute_omnipotence_how_a_reality_could/,About Absolute Omnipotence  - How a Reality Could Exist Within It,"While writing a book on Genesis, there came a point to describe (as words and understanding would allow) the omnipotence of God. What was supposed to be a few paragraphs became a 5 page addendum. 

Human text disclaimer: 0% of the text is AI generated. All of the ideas and writing are mine. There are some AI equations in the original, they were removed due to the posting rules here. None of the meaning is lost in the absence of the equations, they were only there to help visualize. 

About Absolute Omnipotence:  
Some try to disprove the possibility of omnipotence by asking a silly catch 22. If God can do anything, can he make a stone he couldn’t lift? 

If that’s the only question standing in their belief, here is an answer that is just as silly. Look at it at the quantum level. God can both create a stone that he can’t lift and lift it at the same time. And every time this entanglement is observed, it will show one side or the other before collapsing. But really, both are happening at the same time. 

Who knows? quantum may have yet to make believers. Because when something behaves like it ‘knows’ merely observing it breaks a cardinal rule, that could indicate some kind of awareness. Oh but that’s right, how silly, math apparently doesn’t allow for awareness, so how could it be found? That brings to the very essence of this now addendum. Is the logic found in numbers part of a greater language? 



The text explains how God spoke and the physical universe took form. That very depiction implies omnipotence. God speaks and atoms obey. In trying to explain God’s nature, many spiritual works describe it as an absolute, boundless existence. Some of the concepts are impossible to convey, there are simply no words. Understanding may take some contemplation on the part of the reader. Here’s an attempt to explain a bit of the nature of God within the limits of human understanding. Hopefully it will resonate with most minds and offer some insight.

 

Even though the text refers to God with names in plural, God is best understood as an absolute oneness. It isn’t in space or time, it has no end and never had a beginning. God is everything that is. Nothing can exist besides God. Basically, God is the only entity that really exists, he occupies all of existence. So how could this reality exist if God occupies all of reality? 



In that case, because the only place to put this reality is inside the reality God occupies, he would have to withdraw his presence, or at least, give the illusion of it.  In that place where his presence is (apparently) withdrawn, a reality can exist inside an illusion. In Kabbalah this process is called the contraction, Tzimtzum. This, so God’s presence doesn’t overwhelm whatever he creates. 



Imagine vigorously stirring a liquid, like a coffee. The little vortex cavity that stirring it makes is where that reality would exist. It’s an active and constant thing for God to maintain the ‘cavity’. If he stops ‘stirring’ his infinity, the whole universe will disappear as if it never existed. Imagine if space and time realized this reality is a paradox. To better illustrate, if someone took a drop of water (or a flame) and gave it an identity then dropped it in the ocean (or the flame in a fire). How long will it be until the drop of water loses its identity to the ocean? This reality is the drop of water that exists inside of the infinity of God. Space gives this reality a sense of existence and time allows reality to unfold as well as prevent it from realizing it’s part of a greater absolute reality.



Considering the nature of 0 and 1:



By using the meaning rather than the value of 0 and 1, we try to imagine a reality where those meanings would have been used to build a reality model. 



Many ancient and contemporary philosophers and mathematicians have tried to explain how numbers fit in reality. Expressions like numbers are everything, or everything is numbers, have been around since possibly before the Pythagoreans. Chinese philosophers used 0 and 1 to describe patterns of the yin and yang over 3000 years ago. 

Many of the historical interpretations of 0 and 1 were purely philosophical until Peano, who in 1889, gave mathematical axioms where 1 is the first and only successor of 0 and from there every number can be attained. Most of modern mathematics is based on Peano’s axioms. His proof basically shows that all numbers come from 0. Like 0 contains the potential of all numbers. Then 1 is the first manifestation (succession) of 0. 1 is said to represent unity. 



As these great minds tried to express, mathematics and reality have much in common. Physicists are able to literally project what will happen in reality using math. As a matter of fact, most of our advancements in physics are thanks to a simple and elegant equation, E=mc^(2). There is a truth in numbers that undeniably follows physical reality. 



See what’s been done with binary, the very 0 and 1. The simplification of base 10, the numbers from 0 to 9, is base 2 which is binary. Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz developed the modern binary language in 1679. He saw numbers as a universal language. His binary language happens to be what is called machine readable. This means that a mechanical or electronic machine can be built to follow instructions without needing a brain. A computer processor is such a machine. It pushes instructions through the pure logic of 0 and 1. The results are quasi illimited when it comes to virtual simulations. Some even suggested that this reality may be a computer simulation. Although the arguments have some sense, it’s been mathematically proven that numbers are not enough to fully describe reality.  



Even though every mathematical expression can equally be said in base 10 or binary, binary is nevertheless a simplification. To mathematics the difference is the same as, say, between French and Spanish. Two different sets of words to say the same thing. But it’s not because the difference between binary and base 10 can’t be perceived that there isn’t one. Machines understand binary but they can’t understand base 10. In the case of French and Spanish, one could learn the other language or use a translator. In the case of binary, there are translators that convert the binary output to base 10, letters, pictures… but it’s quasi impossible to build a machine that understands base 10. It seems to be too rich for machines and therefore could indicate the presence of a greater language. 



Without any scientific pretensions, this is just a way to represent in equations what a nested relative reality based on the meaning of 0 and 1 could look like. It tries to show that in the presence of a greater reality (the omnipotence of God), the lesser one would need to be shielded. The shield allows the reality to exist, relative to itself. 



0, being the source of all numbers (according to Peano’s axioms), is considered an open set that contains the potential of everything in chaos. 1, the first and only mathematical successor of 0, represents the absolute unity of all logic contained in 0. Everything structural in the physical reality is under the total control of 1 at the quantum level. Thought, free will and maybe life itself, come directly from 0, bypassing the absolute logic of 1. Time is the shield that allows the physical laws to manifest and protects the physical reality from the greater reality represented by 0 and 1. It represents the way God prevents his omnipotence from overwhelming this reality, one measure of time, well, at a time. The very flow of time masks the presence of God’s omnipotence.



The reason time is described as the medium that enforces the physical rules is because it is perceived as a limiter. Although theoretically all of space can be traversed, time is a unidirectional flow that subjects all of reality. It’s like time is the executor of God’s will. 



Some people suggested reality could be recreated every morning. A few mystical works advance reality is recreated every second. If that concept were true, here it would be at the smallest possible measure of time. Something that’s the inbetween of timelessness and time. Reality would be created (or re-created) at that measurement, the measure of the flow of time. The foundation for reality to build on. The whole illusion of that reality is allowed by and under the control of time. Observe, tweak the rules, bend them… but stop time, there is nothing. Without time none of the rules apply. It seems to be the limit of reality.  

AI EQUATIONS SKIPPED - Not needed to understand the concept.

An analogy that hopefully helps:



Because a computer simulation can only be a simplified binary model of this reality, instead of saying what if this reality is a computer simulation, try thinking of it the other way around. What if a simulated consciousness could be given to a processor? Say for example, all of the hardware sensors would be represented to it as physical inputs. It would ‘feel’ power and temperature fluctuations, cooling systems going on and off… 



After a while, it would come up with all kinds of laws relative to its existence. It may come to the conclusion it’s a tool to run tasks. But to it, reality would be limited to binary. Although it may attain great knowledge about its own reality, it will never be able to understand much from the reality that encloses it (the physical reality) due to its mechanical limitations. 



All of the above is about a machine without a brain, it can only understand at the binary level. In contrast, this reality is perceived by human brains at base 10. If the simplification of 0-9 into 0-1 is a language, wouldn’t that indicate a greater language? And so instead of saying everything is numbers, how about numbers are the logical portion of a greater reality language? 

Could it be that what numbers can’t express, the apparent illogic in quantum, shows room must be made for what seems illogical at the moment? Like entanglements, whatever rule they follow that prevents them from being observed. This behavior translates as some form of awareness (not to be confused with consciousness please). No one is looking because there is no room for it in (the current) logic/math? Doesn’t that translate back as saying numbers are everything?

I started working as an HR Administrator after spending about 10yrs in Purchasing and Ops Administrative work. 

This job was described to me as having flexible hours and opportunity to grow - about 160 employees total with several contractors on site as well day to day. 

Well, there was no mention that the previous person in that role was pulling 60hrs a week. I’m in charge of buying all office supplies, being the receptionist at the door, stocking coffee and mini fridges, running payroll, maintaining HRIS info, assisting w recruiting and onboarding, coordinating and setting up all lunches and company holiday meals, and not to mention, I am in charge of planning the Christmas party for everyone there and plus ones! 

I have had 6 weeks to learn the learn and book a venue, DJ, find a caterer, order gifts, print and distribute invites, AND my other day to day functions im still slow at. 

My boss said verbatim “I’m not much of a party planner. Get a committee together.” Easier said than done, only one office salary person wants to help specifically with cleanup after, and the people on the production floor only want to help clean up or facilitate the games we’d play or songs to play.

The employees are almost entirely 50+ men, and they call me a secretary no matter how often I correct them. They come to me with complaints about the amount of diet Coke in the fridge. My boss is helpful in some aspects, but told me to make the party “my own” and to do what I’d like. MF this is for 200 employees, what does that even mean?

I’m feeling misled and demeaned and set up for failure. Is this a major red flag that I should start looking for another position after the new year? 

I honestly can’t tell if I’m doing okay with my normal workload because I can barely finish it even with coming in for 8hrs on Sunday. ",1,1763079352.0,humanresources,7,0.6,False

Showdowns always bring more variance since the player pool is smaller and lineups tend to overlap, but hopefully this gives you another angle to work with.

1owhjo3,https://www.reddit.com/r/greentea/comments/1owhjo3/has_loose_leaf_green_tea_always_been_this/,Has loose leaf green tea always been this expensive?,"Question: Estimating 4 cups / day, it seems it's at least $60/month for loose leaf Gyokuro on the low end. Has it always been this expensive, or is this a reflection of the current trade wars, tariffs and overall buffoonery?

The preamble: I got into green tea around Spring of this year. I love it. I feel much better than when I used to live on coffee. It tastes better, it feels better. I've lost weight (I am exercising more, so it's not all magical), my LDL is down and my HDL is up. All good things.

I started with local stores with bagged stuff like Harney and Sons Sencha from Sprouts. I've moved on to loose leaf and really like Gyokuro. I've been looking at sites recommended on this sub.

Hi! My name is Stephanie! I’m 35 and live in Western Canada (Specifically - Alberta). I am hoping to make a new online friend that is fun/funny, genuine, willing/able to put effort into conversations(I will do the same!). I would prefer to chat with people around my age, or older(please no one under 30!), that is able to text/write full words lol - a bit of slang is cool, but I can’t do the whole “u” instead of “you” thing etc all the time! 

Some things I enjoy that could give an idea if we have interests in common, or just to start a conversation: music! My favorite band is blink 182, and has been since I was 14 - also pretty into Alkaline Trio, mgk, Taylor Swift etc etc. I enjoy shopping and getting my nails done - I see a very talented nail tech that makes all my nail art dreams a reality. I love coffee, movie and tv shows, with a preference for anything horror. I love to exercise daily, and love to go for long walks. Other things too, but I don’t want to give everything away here, or make this intro too long. 

If this interests you and you’d like to have a chat, please send me a message with a quick introduction! 

Here’s an icebreaker to help start a conversation / show me if you actually read through the post lol: what is something you are looking forward to / excited about?",1,1763078830.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

For context, I work at one of those strip malls where on the ground level is all businesses - retail and restaurants. And above the restaurants are two stories worth of condos.

Today, like we always are during business hours, we are playing some soft instrumental jazz. Your standard cafe music.

At 9am, we get a call from a woman.

""Are you guys playing music?""

""Yes, we are.""

""Okay well I don't know if anyone has told you, but there are people who live above the businesses. Like we have homes here. I live above you and it's very loud"" (said very rudely. Also... no fucking shit. She clearly just said the ""Idk if anyone has told you"" line to make me out to be stupid. Because you'd have to have the intelligence of a brick to not know there are apartments above the businesses)

I tell her ""Okay. It's not playing very loud, but I'll turn it down even more."" and hang up. Turn it down. The music is now pretty much inaudible but whatever.

Tell my coworker how rude she was and he just sorta laughs and says she came down while they were closing last night and got mad at them for having music on (this would've been about 4 or 5 pm. Very reasonable time to be playing music)

I've also heard other coworkers who know her personally say that she'll constantly text them to tell whoever is working to turn off the music. Apparently she actually used to work at the cafe but was let go because everyday she'd go to the owner and complain that we play music and its disruptive to her when she's at home. He's been up to her apartment and has said he literally had to strain to hear the music. Again, it's soft jazz. We're not playing like bass thumping rock or hip hop or something.

Anyways, just wanted to rant because I find it crazy to buy an apartment on top of a restaurant, and then be mad when you can hear the business below you. Also, as an apartment owner, you have to know you're going to be dealing with some noise from neighbors, regardless of whether your neighbor is a business or not. As someone who has lived in many apartments, I *wish* my biggest noise issue was some soft jazz from 8am to 5pm and the smell of fresh baked bread and coffee. That seems like an ideal downstairs neighbor in my eyes, as far as apartment neighbors go.",30,1763078538.0,Serverlife,18,1.0,False

I’m looking for like-minded women who aren’t necessarily looking for a best friend, but are looking for accountability, motivation, and a reason to move and stay active for their physical and mental health.

Our first event is this Saturday at 9:00 AM — a relaxed 3-mile Coffee Crawl through the neighborhood with a few cute café stops. The goal is simple: move our bodies, explore local spots, and show up for ourselves.

This group is for women who want:

gentle accountability

movement without pressure

community without forced friendships

something consistent to look forward to


We welcome women 21 and up.
Most of our members are in their 30s and 40s, but we also have a few younger women — so as long as you’re open, you’re welcome.

It’s also a great space for anyone looking for a gym accountability buddy.
Some of us go to the YMCA, some go to Blink (or whatever it’s called now), and others use rec centers or smaller gyms. It’s an easy way to meet women who have similar goals or go to the same places.

This is a free community activity. I’m not a personal trainer and I don’t get paid for this, U have a full time very demanding job— I just see the need for motivation and connection close to home.

We’re planning to do these walks every weekend or every other weekend, sometimes with different themes.

If you’re interested, send me a message offline, and I’ll share the details so you can stay connected.

Show up for yourself, and we’ll show up together!",19,1763078467.0,BedStuy,5,0.95,False
1owhaid,https://www.reddit.com/r/Empowish/comments/1owhaid/the_healing_power_of_i_dont_know_yet_why_the/,The Healing Power of 'I Don't Know Yet': Why the Undefined Space Is Your Most Fertile Ground,"Fellow Empowish members,

We often talk about seeking clarity, finding direction, and defining our goals. But today, I want us to lean into the terrifying, exhilarating, and often deeply misunderstood state of being **undefined**.

Think about the moments in your life that felt the most overwhelming: the end of a relationship, a career pivot, the aftermath of trauma, or simply trying to figure out ‘who you are now.’ These are periods of profound formlessness. And usually, our primal response is panic. We rush to slap a new label on ourselves, commit to a new rigid plan, or force a definition because *definition feels safe.*

### The Trap of Premature Definition

Rushing the undefined stage is like pulling a plant out of the soil every day to check if the roots are growing. You disrupt the essential, quiet work that happens in the dark. 

When we force a definition—*“I must be X,” “My life’s purpose is Y”*—before we have integrated the lessons of the transition, we end up building brittle structures that inevitably crack. They don't fit the actual, evolving person you are becoming.

### Embracing the Generative Ambiguity

The most profound healing and growth often happens in the 'unlabeled' space. When things are undefined, they are pure potential. The undefined is not a void; it is a fertile field. It's the moment when the clay is soft and ready to be molded, but hasn't yet been fired into an inflexible shape.

**This reflection offers a radical shift: Treat 'Undefined' as your current job title.**

### Practical Steps for Residing in Ambiguity:

**1. Authorize the Pause (The Non-Actionable Action):**
Give yourself explicit permission to not have the answers right now. Instead of asking, ""What am I?"" or ""Where am I going?"", shift the question to, **""What am I witnessing right now?""** This moves you from the stress of creation to the calm of observation.

**2. Redefine 'Success' in the Ambiguous Phase:**
Success during the undefined period is *not* reaching clarity. Success is maintaining presence, integrity, and basic self-care while the foundation shifts. Did you eat a nourishing meal? Did you breathe deeply for 60 seconds? Did you hold space for a difficult feeling without running from it? That is success.

**3. Anchor to the 'Small Defined Things':**
When the big picture is blurry, anchor yourself to the small, predictable routines that keep you grounded. Your morning coffee, your walk, your journaling practice, or your commitment to a hobby. These small, defined acts are the islands of certainty that keep you from being swept away by the uncertain currents of the larger life transitions.

Trust that the definition will emerge organically, built from genuine experience, not forced by fear. The most beautiful lives are rarely built according to a rigid, day-one blueprint. They are edited, revised, and beautifully shaped in the necessary, rich space of 'I don't know yet.'",1,1763078461.0,Empowish,0,1.0,False

1owh9lf,https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5604956-trade-deals-us-latin-america-coffee/,"Coffee, banana, cocoa get tariff reprieve under new Latin American trade deals","The White House said Thursday it had reached framework agreements on trade deals with four Latin American countries to lower tariffs on some goods, such as coffee and bananas.

The administration [outlined deals with](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/11/joint-statement-on-framework-for-a-united-states-argentina-agreement-on-reciprocal-trade-and-investment/) Argentina, El Salvador, Ecuador and Guatemala. Administration officials said the agreements would provide tariff relief for those countries on goods that cannot be naturally produced in the United States.

The deals were announced after President Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent hinted that the administration [was looking at actions](https://thehill.com/business/5601889-scott-bessent-reducing-costs-coffee-bananas/) to reduce tariffs and bring down the cost of items like coffee and bananas.

A senior administration official told reporters that a baseline tariff rate of 10 percent will remain in place on goods from Argentina, El Salvador and Guatemala, and a 15 percent tariff rate will remain in place on Ecuador. But the framework agreements will allow for tariffs to be lowered or dropped on certain goods, such as bananas, coffee and cocoa, the official said.

The frameworks also call for the U.S. and the Latin American countries to increase market access for certain goods to allow for additional trade.",1,1763078407.0,UsaNewsLive,0,1.0,False

So, I agreed to kill my baby. Sounds crazy I know.

I wasn’t going to write this. I told myself I needed to focus on learning how to cope with loss again, on coming to terms with something I couldn’t see, something waiting to rip my baby from me the moment it was born. But even with what happened, I need to remember, I agreed to this.

I’m writing this from a place of healing, you might not think I deserve peace, but I do. I’ll start from where I left off, that way, when I’m ready, I can put it together and maybe give it to someone that can help me.

*At first, I thought Ethan was the problem. I thought the late nights, the hidden phone, the messages from “Alex” meant there was another woman. That would have been easier. I could have hated him for cheating. I could have left. But it wasn’t that simple. It was never another woman. It was her.*

The hollow lady. Sounds made up right? Yeah, that’s what I though too, until Ethan led her right to us. To me. She’s not a person, not anymore. But in order to save my living Baby, I had to promise her my unborn child.

The deal was made with Ethan, we couldn’t have kids naturally, so Ethan turned to dark magic to help. we got to have jessie in return for any and all subsequent babies.

 I didn’t know any of this until it was too late, until I was already pregnant with my second, until she came knocking to collect her debt. Once she heard I was trying to back out of a deal I didn’t agree to, she tried to take Jessie back.

You need to understand I didn’t have a choice. My only child was dying in front of me. You can’t tell me you wouldn’t have done the same.

*I was 37 weeks pregnant when I finally snapped. We had just returned from a growth scan at the hospital. I’d been going every fortnight since 32 weeks. That was when the labour scare happened. The contractions had started thick and fast, seemingly out of nowhere. Any premature labour would bring panic, but for me the grief and dread overrode every other sense.*

*I’d felt this baby kick and wriggle inside me since I was 20 weeks, and I knew the minute it was born she would take it. I wasn’t ready to let go.*

*The doctors weren’t even going to try to stop it. They said the weight was good, the lungs should be strong enough to just need a little oxygen. Survival rate: 95%. But I knew if that baby took a breath, its survival rate was zero.*

*We sat in silence in the car. The sonographer’s sweet voice looped in my head as she smiled and said everything looked fine, the baby was growing well. I should have felt relief. Instead, all I could think about was the smell in the room when I begged them to stop the labour, that same sickly wave of patchouli clinging to the curtains, seeping through the vents. And in the corner, just for a second between contractions, I thought I saw her. A shadow stretched too long to belong to anything human.*

*The labour stopped on its own. Later I read that stress can inhibit the release of oxytocin and slow or stall labour. Maybe that was it. Or maybe she was just toying with me.*

*sat across from Ethan at the dinner table, warming my hands on a cup of too-bitter coffee. The steam curled into my face, making my eyes sting. I cleared my throat, trying to sound casual.*

*“We should give him a name.”*

*Ethan didn’t look up. He pushed the last of his dinner around his plate with the side of his fork, like if he stalled long enough, I’d take the words back.*

*“There’s no point,” he muttered at last. His voice was flat, but his knuckles whitened around the fork.*

*I felt my stomach twist. The baby kicked hard against my ribs, as if demanding I argue back. I wanted to scream, to throw the cup across the room, but all I managed was a whisper.*

*“He deserves a name.”*

*Ethan finally looked at me then, and in his eyes, I didn’t see anger or cruelty. I saw resignation. The look of a man who believed he’d already buried his son.*

*“Name or not, Cara, in three weeks’ time, he won’t be ours anymore.” Ethan choked the words out, failing to hold back tears. He wiped them away quickly with the back of his hand and looked away.*

*“He’s ours right now,” I said softly. “I don’t want to give up hope yet.”*

*He shoved his chair back, the screech of the legs driving nails into my brain. “There’s nothing we can do.”*

*“Isn’t there?” I shot back. “She seemed pretty pissed off when I didn’t agree to the deal…”*

*“Yeah,” Ethan said bitterly. “And it almost killed Jessie.”*

*“I know.” My voice dropped to a solemn whisper. “But think about it, if she needed me to agree, she must be bound by something, right? Deals. Promises. Rules.”*

*“What do you mean?” he asked, slumping back into his seat, defeated. I could see the weariness etched into his face. He sighed, resting his chin in his hands.*

 *This wasn’t the first time I’d had a question, or an idea, or a theory. They never amounted to more than disappointment or heartache. But I wasn’t willing to just sit back and let this happen.*

*“I mean, maybe there’s a way out,” I pressed. “Why was she banging on the other side of that door like a pissed-off toddler?”*

*Ethan’s head shot up, eyes flicking around the room like the mere thought of mocking her might call her back.*

*“She wanted to scare you,” he whispered cautiously.*

*“Yeah, but why? If she was all-powerful, why did she need to scare me into submission?”*

*He raised an eyebrow, unease creeping into his expression.*

*“She needed my agreement, Ethan. That means she can’t just take what she wants, not without rules to follow. If there are rules, maybe there’s a way to break them.”*

*He shook his head. “But I was the one who made the deal with her—”*

*“But I’m the one making the payment!” I shot back.*

*“He’s my baby too,” Ethan said, his voice breaking.*

*I barked a bitter laugh. “Oh, fuck off, Ethan. You donated a cell and thirty seconds of your time to making this baby. The rest has been me — my body, my blood, my fear.”*

*His face crumpled. The fight went out of him all at once, and for the first time I saw him small, broken. “I’m sorry,” he whimpered, finally breaking. His shoulders shook as the words scraped out of him. “I’m so sorry, Cara.”*

*I’ve never been good with emotions; I have plenty of my own but dealing with someone else’s is… awkward. I reached out for his hand across the table, pulling it closer and caressed in with my thumb.*

*I didn’t know what to say. I’d waited for this break down for weeks, the acceptance that what he had done wasn’t in OUR best interests it was in his. Id waited for this apology. Now that it was here. I didn’t even want to gloat. It just felt wrong.*

*“Its… It’ll be ok.”*

*He shook his head, his eyes swollen and red still never meeting mine. “It doesn’t matter. The minute you defied her; she went for the next best thing. Jessie almost died. Do you really want to test her again?”*

*“I don’t want to just give up.” My voice cracked, the weight of it spilling out. “I won’t.”*

*Ethan pulled his hand away gently and dragged it over his face, slumping lower in his chair. “Every time you get your hopes up, it just makes the fall worse. There’s no loophole, Cara. There’s no way around this.”*

*I nodded once and stood slowly. Unsure if it were the weight of the baby or the weight of the responsibility to fix this on my own making me struggle to my feet.*

*His words didn’t kill the thoughts spiralling in my head. If there were rules, there had to be a story behind them. And if there was a story, someone out there knew it.*

*\**

*I found myself sitting, frustrated, in the only library in Corvus Vale at 37+4 weeks pregnant. The chair groaned under me as I shifted for the hundredth time, trying to find a position that didn’t make my back ache or my ribs throb from the baby’s kicks.*

*Books were spread out across the table like a crime scene, folklore, local history, old parish records. I’d pulled everything I thought might hold an answer. All of them were useless.*

*There were plenty of ghost stories, but they were all clearly fictional. A few dusty volumes on real, documented witch trials dating back to the 16th century. But not a single mention of her.*

*No Hollow Lady.*

*Christ, I even tried YouTube but ended up going down a google rabbit hole on why some pasta was creepy.*

*I snapped the last book shut, the sound echoing through the halls, earning a glare from the librarian.*

 *I muttered an apology I didn’t mean, then hauled myself up, using the table as leverage, wincing at the pressure in my hips. Thirty–seven weeks pregnant and about as graceful as a tank.*

*The rain hit me the second I stepped outside. Cold and sharp. I pulled my coat tighter, head down against the drizzle. That’s when it happened.*

*Something whizzed past my ear, close enough to stir the hair on my cheek. I ducked instinctively, my heart slamming against my ribs. “Jesus Christ!” I yelped into the empty street. For a second I thought it was a drone, but when I spun around, all I caught was a flash of white feathers disappearing around the corner.*

*A bird.*

*My bird.*

*“Jerry?” The name slipped out before I could stop it.*

*Against my better judgment, I followed.*

*The side street was narrow and slick with patches of damp moss, the kind of place you’d normally cross the road to avoid.*

The crow’s white feathers glowed against the grey as it expertly manoeuvred itself through a half-open shop door.

*Madam Morrigan’s Morbid Curiosities.*

The words curled across the rotting wood in faded gold paint. Beneath it, the shop window was crammed with strange clutter: antique knives, cloudy jars, bones, half-melted candles. It looked less like a display and more like a murder-weapon dump site.

I swallowed hard and turned away. I hadn’t taken two steps before Jerry cawed loudly behind me.

I spun to see him perched on the sill. He tilted his head once, sharp, and deliberate, then hopped down and fluttered back inside. Like he had led me here on purpose.

“Yep,” I mouthed. “Totally normal.”

The bell above the door gave a weak, uneven chime as I pushed it open.

The air was thick and stale. Not the choking patchouli I’d come to dread, but something heavier. Dust. Melted candle wax. The faint metallic tang of rusting iron.

Shelves leaned against the walls, every one of them crowded with things that felt stolen from graves: cloudy jars with labels too faded to read, cracked porcelain dolls with eyes that followed me, strings of bird skulls looped together like rosary beads.

In the corner, the white crow shifted inside its open cage, feathers gleaming unnaturally bright against the gloom. It clicked its beak once, sharp, and deliberate, before hopping to the edge of the cage as if to mark my arrival.

A woman stood behind the counter, draped in black lace and velvet shawl, her long grey hair pinned back with what looked disturbingly like bones. Her eyes caught mine instantly, sharper than the knives on display.

“You are late,” she said. Her voice was soft and low, carrying the weight of someone who already knew why I was there.

“I… I am?” I stuttered, raising an eyebrow.

Her bangles chimed as she gestured to the white crow. “He has been circling you for weeks. Trying to lead you here.”

The crow cawed sharply, as if in agreement.

“He’s been sitting at my window eating the last of my biscuits,” I muttered.

Madam Morrigan’s lips curved, not quite a smile. “Nothing bound to me lingers without reason, feeding him wasn’t the reason, although. he is partial to a custard cream.” She said as she glided over to his cage and shut the latch.

“Why then?” I asked.

“It seems you’re in a spot of bother,” she said casually. “That is why you are standing in my shop instead of burying your child.”

My face dropped. “Who are you?” I demanded.

“Me? Oh, many things. Small business owner, fortune teller, collector of fine items.” She gestured around the cluttered shop like she was showing off a school science project. “Friends call me Madam Morrigan. And you, my dear, are…”

“Suspicious as fuck,” I cut in.

For a long moment she just stared at me. Then her shoulders began to shake. A laugh spilled out, low and rasping, the sound of dry leaves scraping together.

“Oh, I do like you,” she said at last, eyes glittering in the gloom. “Sharp tongue. Shame that never saves anyone.”

The crow cawed once, loud enough to make me flinch.

“Can you help me?” I pleaded. My voice cracked. I hated how small it sounded.

Madam Morrigan’s expression shifted. The smile didn’t fade, but it changed, softer, colder, the way someone might look at a child holding a broken toy.

“You made a promise to Constance Arthur. We are taught from infanthood, promises must not be broken.”

“No, I didn’t. I don’t know who that is,” I said sharply.

“You have met the Hollow Lady, yes?” she asked, drifting past me to the door. The key turned with a soft click as she locked it.

A prickle of anxiousness shot up my spine like electricity.

“Yes,” I whispered, the word leaving my mouth like a confession.

“Then you have met Constance Arthur.” She smiled, leaving the key in the lock and gesturing for me to follow.

I stalled, heart hammering. Should I run, or hear her out? I didn’t know this woman, and I didn’t know if I was safe. But I did know one thing, I needed help, and I was running out of time.

The chair creaked under my weight as I sat across from Madam Morrigan. I wiggled uncomfortably, trying to ease the pressure in my back, while she flipped through a large book with a faded leather cover. The pages crackled like dry leaves, edges browned and curling with age.

Symbols and cramped handwriting sprawled across the parchment. Some looked like prayers, others like curses. I couldn’t tell the difference.

She stopped on a page marked with a ribbon the colour of dried blood. Her bangles chimed as she pressed her palm flat against it, keeping it open.

“This is where her chapter begins,” Madam Morrigan said, eyes fixed on the page, but voice aimed squarely at me. “Would you like to hear her story?”

“Will it help me save my baby?” I asked.

She smiled thinly. “Probably not,” she said, then added, “but it might help you understand what you are up against.”

Behind me, the crow shifted in its cage nervously.

Madam Morrigan began.

“Constance Arthur was born in Corvus Vale in 1616, the daughter of a healer. She grew up among roots and herbs, learning the quiet craft of charms and midwifery. By the time she was grown, she had become a midwife herself, respected and trusted.”

She turned a brittle page. “She married Stanley Arthur, a carpenter of good standing. At first, they were happy. But her womb was a grave. Several Miscarriages followed their marriage then A stillbirth. The midwives brought talismans and silver rattles to her bedside, hoping to ward off spirits they blamed for her losses.”

At last, she bore a daughter, named Mercy Stanley. But Mercy lived only sixteen days. That was Stanley’s last straw.

I swallowed hard, heat crawling up my throat.

“She was like me?”

“Indeed, she was, child but just as two loaves may start from the same dough, if mistreated, one may rise, and the other may sour.”

She cleared her throat, “there’s more” she began.

“Whispers spread through the vale: that Constance was cursed, that her touch spoiled children. Stanley turned bitter, then cruel, and at last denounced her outright. To save himself, he accused his wife of witchcraft.

Constance was brought to trial during the witch-hunts. She was sentenced to hang in 1636.

It was said that, in desperation Constance called out not to God, but to something else. And it listened.

The day of execution, it was documented the rope snapped — not once, but six times. The magistrates called it a sign of God’s will, but the people of Corvus Vale whispered it was something else entirely.

The crow cawed once, sharp, and sudden.

“She was spared but not freed. Exiled to Hollowthorn Forest, east of here. Alone. And then the rumours began. That her dark magic could help barren women. That she could succeed where medicine and prayer had failed. And so, they went to her. Begged her. And she gave. Always in exchange for a bargain.”

My hands folded protectively over my stomach before I even realised.

Morrigan’s eyes glittered in the lamplight. “Each bargain etched away at her soul. Even after death in 1720 they came. scratching symbols into the walls and leaving offerings, praying she might hear them.

And those who prayed too loud… sometimes found their prayers answered.

By then she was no longer known as a wife. No longer as a midwife. Only the Hollow Lady.

She shut the book with a crack that made me flinch. “And you, child, are in her path.”

My mouth went dry. “What does that mean?”

Morrigan leaned forward, bangles chiming as her arms folded on the table. Her eyes were steady, unblinking.

“It means you are bound to her now. Constance Arthur was a woman betrayed by broken vows. A husband who swore to love her, then cast her aside. A court that promised her death yet left her swinging in limbo. She swore she would never lose another child… and she kept that promise. That is why she clings to every oath, every word, every silence. To her, a promise is not a comfort. It is a chain. And she will not let this go.”

The crow cawed again, sharp, and sudden, as if sealing the words.

in the front of the shop, I was struggling to get into be still soaked coat when Madam Morrigan slid the book across the counter, Beside it she set down a pouch of coarse salt, a small vial of holy water, and a bundle of dried herbs tied with red string.

“I’ll loan you the book. Use Salt for protection. Water for cleansing. And this,” she tapped the herbs, “to burn if you must call her off in a hurry. Not that it will save you for long.”

I gathered them up, stuffing them into my bag. The cracked leather cover rough and heavy in my arms. My chest felt tight with a strange mix of dread and relief.

I thanked her and turned to leave “Ah, ah,” Morrigan chided, her bangles clinking as she held out a hand. “That will be twelve pounds ninety-seven, please.”

I blinked. “Seriously?”

Her lips curved. “I told you, child. I run a small business.”

I struggled to keep my swollen feet balanced on the cushions underneath them as the baby kicked against the book resting on my stomach.

“What’s that?” Ethan asked, flopping onto the sofa beside me.

“Fifty Shades of Grey, haunted edition,” I muttered without looking up.

He smirked and reached for it. “Didn’t think that was your type.”

I let him take it, watching his face shift as he flipped through the brittle, ink-stained pages. The smirk faded fast.

“This isn’t funny,” he whispered. His thumb traced a line of cramped writing, his eyes wide and glassy. “Cara… this is it; this is the same spell. The one I used.”

I swiped the book back from him, studying the page. “You had this book?” I scowled. “You had this book, and you didn’t read about who the fuck she was first!?”

“No!” he protested, hands up like I had a knife to his throat. “Alex sent me the spell with a list of instructions. I didn’t have any book.”

The words sank like stones in my chest. Alex again. Always Alex.

“So, you just… what, recited this without question?” My voice cracked between rage and disbelief.

“I was desperate,” he said. His voice broke on the word, his hands dragging down his face. “I didn’t think—”

“No, you didn’t,” I snapped, clutching the book tighter.

my eyes scanned over the page, reading what Ethan read all those months ago aloud.

Ingredients:

A circle of salt, to keep her in  
A token of loss, for things that have been  
Water and oil, the scent of earth, “that was patchouli” Ethan interrupted” “oh I fucking know”  
A candle of black, to bind the birth.

Invocation:

Hollow Lady, hear my plea,  
Take my grief and answer me.  
Mother who lost, who swore no more,  
Open for me your shadowed door.

I bring you pain; I bring you need,  
I bring the blood of broken seed.  
Give me a child, and let it grow,  
And I will grant what you claim I owe.

The choice is always yours to set,  
I will freely pay you for my debt.  
For a chain must be willingly clasped,  
Or it cannot hold, nor ever last.

 “A chain must be willingly clasped?” I repeated, raising an eyebrow.

“Yeah. I had to do it willingly, so I had to say all that stuff about paying my debt freely.”

“You did,” I shot back, “but I didn’t.”

“Yeah, you did. In the bedroom.” His voice was flat, resigned. “You agreed when she threatened Jessie.”

“When she threatened Jessie, Ethan.”

He just stared at me, blank faced.

“For Christ’s sake.” I hauled myself upright, heat flaring in my chest. “Threatening someone into submission isn’t willingness. That’s agreement under duress.”

“This isn’t Law and Order, Cara,” he muttered, scrubbing a hand down his face. “She’s not going to care about semantics. She’s an evil demon, not a judge.”

“Then why put it in the spell?” I snapped.

“I think I’m onto something here.” The baby kicked in agreement, and I pressed a hand to my stomach.

Ethan hesitated, knuckles pressed white against his knees. “Maybe it’s tradition. Maybe there’s some rule even demons have to follow. Maybe it is a loophole. I don’t know, Cara. I just needed to say it as is, even if—”

“Even if she had to twist our arms until they broke?” My voice shook. The memory of Jessie’s wide, terrified eyes flashed in my mind, and my hands clenched into fists.

He looked away, picking at a loose thread on his cuff, jaw tight. “You think I don’t know that? You think I don’t hate it?”

I dragged in a shaky breath. “So, what do we do now? If the chain only holds because I said yes, but I didn’t really—”

“Then maybe there’s a way to break it,” he finished, hope flickering briefly in his tired eyes.

“Or at least bend it,” I murmured. “Demons love their loopholes, don’t they?”

A rueful smile touched his lips. “Almost as much as solicitors.”",1,1763078372.0,creepypasta,1,1.0,False
1owh8hg,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1owh8hg/i_f22_have_come_to_a_loss_with_my_partner_m42/,I F22 have come to a loss with my partner M42 *LONG POST*,"Me (F22) and my partner (M42) have not had the most normal or easy relationship. We have been together for almost two years. I got pregnant 2 months into our relationship and moved in to his house about a month later. He has two kids (8&10) half time here and we get along great there are absolutely no issues in that aspect. We now have an almost 1 year old, and I stay at home to take care of her. 

We have had a lot of issues mainly caused by me. I have lied a lot throughout our relationship about my own past. I’m now in DBT (therapy) and really am working on myself and getting to the roots with my control and anxiety issues and why the lying even occurred. We briefly broke up because of it where I got my own apartment, a job, figured out how to get daycare assistance but we got back together and I moved back in. 

When I moved back in, we did have the understanding that our relationship would be on the back burner in a sense while I figure out the issues with my lying, my anxiety, etc. I feel like it has been a blurred line because I’m expecting such things from my relationship that he has put on the back burner to protect himself in a sense. “It would be different if we didn’t live together, I would tell you we just need a break so you can focus on yourself and we can revisit the relationship.” Is what he said.

It’s been a huge stress… I feel like he’s almost with me out of convenience. Our sex isn’t as passionate, our connection feels almost severed. If we didn’t have a child and didn’t live together, what would our relationship be? 

This stress has been boiling up and today, our daughter was by the coffee table and we were on the couch. She was trying to get his computer and he was pushing her (lightly) with his foot away. I said careful out of a habit and he got a little defensive and eventually said “how many times have you dropped her, twice?” Maybe as a joke, I don’t know. 

I had postpartum depression and was so exhausted and felt isolated, I had my daughter on my chest in bed and I don’t even know what happened but she rolled off onto the floor. I felt awful, I wanted to die just from that. It made me feel so detached as a mother. It made me feel called out, embarrassed, wrong. In my emotional brain I pushed him in the arm with my foot. Then I did it again. I don’t know why I did it just is what my body did. I’m not violent, I don’t even hit or abuse anybody. He said he didn’t know how to process it and that we could talk later. 

I have a lot of remorse for what I did, I feel awful. In the moment I tried to justify it by doing it because of what he said but it’s just because I felt guilty for it in the moment after I did kick him. I’m honestly just at a loss. I want so badly for things to be good. I don’t want my relationship to be like this. I don’t want MYSELF to be like this. I just need someone to respond to this, I have no friends and no family to talk to. I’m just… lost. ",3,1763078329.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

1owh4gl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Informal_Effect/comments/1owh4gl/hg12/,HG12,"Two days later, the phone rang.  
It was Sunday afternoon. We were on the couch, Silas reading, me scrolling on my laptop. I saw the Caller ID: Mom.  
Immediately, my posture changed. I sat up straighter. I cleared my throat. I physically rearranged my face into a pleasant, non-threatening mask.  
""Hey, Mom!"" I answered, my voice pitching up an octave. ""So good to hear from you! How are you? How's Dad?""  
Silas didn't look up from his book, but his body went still. He was listening. He was reading the shift.

I spent twenty minutes on the phone. It was a barrage of passive-aggressive commentary about my job (""still just a coordinator?""), my living situation (""still renting?""), and my lack of a 'nice girl.'  
I absorbed it all. I laughed it off. I apologized for things that weren't my fault. I agreed with her criticisms. I smoothed every ruffled feather. I made myself small, agreeable, and frictionless.  
""Okay, love you too. Bye.""

I hung up and slumped back against the cushions, exhausted. It felt like I’d run a marathon.  
I closed my eyes, waiting for the headache to set in.  
""Who was that?"" Silas asked. His voice was low, dangerous.  
""Just my mom.""  
""That wasn't you,"" he said.  
I opened my eyes. He had put the book down. He was turning his entire body toward me, that intense, analytical gaze dissecting me.  
""What do you mean?""  
""That voice,"" Silas said. ""That... laugh. You sounded like a stranger. You sounded like a waiter trying to get a big tip.""

I flinched. ""It's just... it's easier, Si. You don't know them. If I push back, if I'm real... it just makes things hard. They worry. They critique. It's better if I just be what they want me to be.""  
""The Invisible Boy,"" Silas said.  
I froze. ""What?""  
""That's who you are to them,"" he said, and there was a flash of anger in his hazel eyes. Not at me. For me. ""You make yourself invisible so they don't trip over you. You polish yourself down until you're smooth and featureless so they can't catch a snag.""

I felt tears prick my eyes. It was a harsh truth, one I’d never articulated even to myself.  
""I grew up in a house full of noise,"" I whispered, looking at my hands. ""My brother was the troublemaker. My sister was the prodigy. My parents were always... overwhelmed. There was no room for me to have problems. No room for me to have needs. So I became the easy one. The low-maintenance one. The one who fixes the mood so Mom doesn't cry and Dad doesn't yell.""  
I looked at him. ""I learned to read people too, Silas. But not to dodge a hit. I learned to read them so I could be whatever they needed me to be to keep the peace. I'm a chameleon. I'm whatever the room needs.""  
""And it's exhausting,"" Silas stated.  
""It's lonely,"" I admitted. ""Because nobody knows who I actually am. They just know the version of me that serves them.""

Silas moved then. He slid across the couch, invading my space, his heat encompassing me. He took my face in his large, rough hands, forcing me to look at him.  
""I know who you are,"" he said fiercely.  
""You see the mess,"" I said, a tear escaping. ""The anxiety. The fear.""  
""I see the man who stood in front of me in a salvage yard and told me he wasn't scared of my ghosts,"" Silas corrected. ""I see the man who makes me biscuits when I'm working late. I see the man who has a spine of steel when it actually matters.""  
He brushed the tear away with his thumb.  
""You don't have to be invisible with me, Asa. You don't have to fix the mood. You can be mad. You can be sad. You can be ugly. I ain't looking for a mirror. I'm looking for you.""

""We're a pair, aren't we?"" I let out a watery laugh. ""The boy who stopped talking to survive, and the boy who stopped existing to survive.""  
""We're a paradox,"" Silas murmured, leaning in. ""But the math works.""  
""How?""  
""I watch for the danger so you don't have to,"" he said, his forehead resting against mine. ""And you... you make the world soft enough for me to speak.""

It was the most beautiful, accurate thing anyone had ever said to me.  
He kissed me then, a slow, grounding kiss that tasted of coffee and certainty.  
""Don't use that voice with me,"" he whispered against my lips. ""The waiter voice.""  
""Never,"" I promised.  
""Good,"" he growled, pulling me closer. ""Because I tip terrible.""

I laughed, a real, genuine sound that filled the quiet apartment. And for the first time, I realized that the silence between us wasn't empty. It was the space we had both finally found where we could just be.",1,1763078035.0,Informal_Effect,0,1.0,False

I wanted to throw out a few ideas I’ve seen or tried, split between online brands and brick-and-mortar, and see what you all are doing too.

## Online / Ecommerce
1.	Limited-edition bundles – throw a couple products together for a seasonal vibe. People love something that feels special and short-lived.
2.	Fun email countdowns – not just “sale ends soon,” but GIFs, timers, or little interactive surprises to make it fun.
3.	UGC contests – get your customers to post pics with your stuff using a hashtag. Feature the best ones on your site or socials.
4.	Post-purchase surprise – a tiny seasonal freebie or digital bonus after checkout keeps people coming back.
5.	Micro-campaigns – run a quirky 3–5 day campaign around a weird little holiday. “National Coffee Day” or “First Day of Summer” type stuff.

## Brick-and-Mortar / Local
1.	Pop-up vibes – seasonal mini-events in or outside your store with themed decor or little demos.
2.	Partner with nearby brands – co-create a seasonal offer or event together. Two small brands can make something bigger than one alone.
3.	Window / display fun – turn your storefront into something Instagram-worthy. People will come take pics and share it.
4.	Flash in-store rewards – surprise loyal customers with seasonal freebies or discounts for one day. Keeps people checking in.
5.	Workshops or classes – tie your product to a hands-on experience. Could be a DIY kit, tasting, or tutorial.

I had a very unhealthy childhood and have slowly been making lifestyle changes. I only ever ate pizza rolls, chips, Ramon noodles, nutter butters and drank a whole 12 pack of soda a day to myself. By 17, my body type would have been defined as obese.

I'm 26 years old now and taught myself to cook and learned about nutrition. I cook high protien meals from scratch every day and watch my portions. I drink soda as treat on the rare occasion my husband and I are able to do date night. Other than that, I drink black coffee and water.

I finally quit using nicotine this past February, gaining a bunch of energy nicotine was taking from me. When I found out I was pregnant with baby #2 I finally got this spark of motivation to workout regularly. With Dr. approval, I do 30 minute cardio and pilates workouts 5x a week.

The health of my baby and myself is of course my #1 priority. I'm just kind of bummed out about how much weight I'm still putting on even though I'm at the peak of the healthiest i have ever been. I am still fairly overweight and quickly rising. I'm 4'11"" and weigh 175. At this rate, ill be 200 when the baby is born and I just dont get it.

I keep googling to soothe myself, I see its normal and healthy to keep gaining weight while pregnant, even though I'm already overweight. My midwives don't seem concerned, and in fact seem more concerned that I am asking about my rapid weight gain, as if they think ill do an unhealthy crash diet or something which is frustrating. I feel like they kind of brushed me off.

I'm just starting to feel third trimester fatigue, combined with gaining 2 whole pounds a week and want to say fuck the workouts at this point if I'm just gonna end up obese again either way.",2,1763077206.0,fitpregnancy,1,1.0,False

[Wednesdays I share](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sicklecell/search/?q=%22Wednesdays+I+share%22) universal remedies to help reduce pain, decrease hospital visits, and improve quality of life. Remedies I recommend because I've tested and proven them.

Last week’s topic: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Sicklecell/comments/1opapwf/whats\_working\_for\_me\_now\_be\_normal/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sicklecell/comments/1opapwf/whats_working_for_me_now_be_normal/)

I talk about proper hydration a lot, but it's time to get specific about it.

Because the payoff is powerful.

You feel less pain and your body starts to heal so you can grow stronger than you thought you could be.

Everything we do makes us dehydrated. Breathing, thinking, talking, digesting, sleeping, even drinking water. It al cost energy and depletes our electrolytes.

Since hydration is about electrolytes best to know what those are and pack your diet with more of them.

The main four are: Calcium, Potassium, Magnesium, and Sodium. The average person is severely deficient in all. People with anemia more so.

Funny enough the number one cause of dehydration is drinking too much water. It dilutes your electrolytes so you have to work harder to get them to optimal levels again

So the aim is two-part:  
  
1— Get hydrated effectively: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Sicklecell/comments/1lk73i1/whats\_working\_for\_me\_now\_no\_h2o/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sicklecell/comments/1lk73i1/whats_working_for_me_now_no_h2o/)

2— Limit or eliminate the dehydrators in your life:

Think diuretics like water, coffee, soda, alcohol, overly cooked meats and seafood, processed foods, high-sodium foods, and more.

If the above dehydrators are 100% of your lifestyle, make changes to get it down to a manageable 20% or less.

Within a few hours you''ll feel better and know it's working.

This is why I think this should be the first step of everyone's SC journey to better health.

How far you take this is up to how Great you want to feel. So the choice is yours, and yours alone.

1owgs92,https://www.reddit.com/r/Informal_Effect/comments/1owgs92/hg_11/,"HG, 11","""You wanna see where I learned the trick?""  
We were sitting on the porch swing of the apartment complex, sharing a beer under the orange haze of the city streetlights. It was a Friday night, three weeks into the ""us"" era.  
""The trick?"" I asked, resting my head on his shoulder.  
""The witch thing,"" Silas said. ""Reading people. The static.""  
He wasn't looking at me. He was looking out at the parking lot, at his truck. His profile was etched in stone, but his hand, resting on my knee, was trembling slightly. A tremor so faint only I, who had spent years mapping his geography, would notice.  
""Yeah,"" I said softly. ""I want to see.""  
He stood up, drained his beer, and jingled his keys. ""Get your boots on.""

We drove out of the city, past the suburbs, into the deep, sprawling darkness of the rural county where Silas had grown up. The further we drove, the quieter Silas became. Not the comfortable silence of our living room, but a taut, wire-tight silence.  
We turned off the main highway onto a gravel road that crunched loudly under the tires. Dust billowed behind us in the red glow of the taillights.  
He pulled up to a rusted chain-link gate. Beyond it lay a salvage yard. Mountains of twisted metal, crushed sedans, and skeletal truck frames rose up like jagged hills against the night sky.  
""My old man's place,"" Silas said, killing the engine. ""He didn't just fix cars. He stripped 'em. Buried 'em.""

We got out. The air smelled of rust, old oil, and wet earth. Silas unlocked the gate with a key he still kept on his ring and led me inside.  
We walked through the maze of junked cars. It was a graveyard of machinery.  
""He was a loud man,"" Silas said suddenly, his voice echoing off the metal. ""Not just his voice. His energy. He took up all the air in the room. When he was happy, you were happy. When he was mad... you were hunted.""  
He stopped in front of a crushed Buick, resting his hand on the rusted hood.  
""I was six the first time I realized I could predict the weather,"" he murmured. ""Not the rain. Him. I learned that if his left eye twitched, he’d had a bad day at the auction. If he walked heavy on his heels, he was drunk. If he hummed, he was dangerous.""  
I felt a cold chill that had nothing to do with the night air. I moved closer, wrapping my hand around his bicep.  
""I stopped talking,"" Silas continued, staring at the wreck. ""Because words were fuel. If I spoke, I gave him something to latch onto. Something to twist. So I became a ghost. I watched. I learned the patterns. I learned that the delivery guy was skimming off the top because he wouldn't look Dad in the eye. I learned that the sheriff was sleeping with the waitress because of how he held his coffee cup.""

He turned to me. In the moonlight, his eyes were haunted, ancient.  
""It wasn't magic, Asa. It was survival. I had to know what everyone was thinking before they thought it, so I could be out of the way when the explosion happened.""  
He looked down at his hands, the hands that could fix anything, the hands that were so gentle with me.  
""That's why I like machines,"" he confessed, his voice cracking. ""A piston doesn't lie to you. A transmission doesn't have a bad day and decide to hurt you. If a machine breaks, there's a reason. A logical, mechanical reason. You can fix it. You can make it make sense.""  
He looked back up at me, his expression raw. ""People don't make sense. They say one thing and do another. They smile while they're holding a knife. It's all just... noise. Chaos.""

""Until you,"" he added, almost in a whisper.  
I stepped in front of him, placing my hands on his chest, over the frantic beat of his heart.  
""Why me?"" I asked. ""I'm a person. I'm chaotic.""  
""No,"" Silas shook his head. ""The first day I met you. Freshman orientation. You were terrified. Shaking like a leaf. But you saw a girl drop her books, and you stopped. You were gonna be late, you were scared to death, but you stopped to help her. You didn't do it for credit. You didn't do it so people would look at you. You did it because you hurt when she hurt.""  
He covered my hands with his own.  
""I read you that day,"" he said. ""And all I saw was... clear water. No hidden agenda. No anger. Just... kindness. Terrified, shaking kindness.""

He leaned his forehead against mine.  
""You were the first thing I ever saw that didn't look like a threat,"" he whispered. ""You were the only place I could rest my eyes.""

I understood then. I understood the taciturn nature. It wasn't arrogance; it was a shield. He had spent his life anticipating the blow, analyzing the data to survive the crash. And I was the only road he’d ever found that didn't have landmines.  
""I'm not going anywhere, Si,"" I promised, my voice fierce. ""I'm not going to change. I'm not going to become a threat.""  
""I know,"" he breathed, closing his eyes. ""I know. That's why I can sleep. Finally.""",2,1763077170.0,Informal_Effect,0,1.0,False

Went to another checkup today and was asked how do I feel. I said it didn't feel much better, it still hurts and PT doesn't seem to be helping. Was told that it's inflammation, even though the injury started a month ago. Explains how frustrating it is and how even after 4 offical sessions and doing the same thing at home everyday, I am seeing little to no difference and how can it still be inflamed after a month. 


Doc getting mad at this point and says she knows better because she had her wrist injured before and how PT is the only thing that helps inflammation/ tendinitis and did I expect a MRI. Getting annoyed at this point and kept asking if 6 sessions is suppose to see progress, and I'm 4 official ones deep and did the same exact thing at home, how come I don't feel any better. Doc starts saying how the insurance requires 6/12 sessions before anything else. 


Said that I know this is all insurance stuff and ofc they want to do the minimum to fix my issue, got cut off by her in the middle of me talking. Asked me ""do you think PT is cheap?"" I didn't say this next part out but I really wanted to, ""comparing this to a mri and possibly surgery? Yes."" Instead I keep trying to get her to explain to me why I'm not seeing any improvements and the only difference between me doing this at home and at PT is there is a guy standing somewhere in the room (which doesn't make anything I do any different btw). 


This went on for another few minutes and I gave up. She seems offended that I had the balls to question her and expressing frustration at the lack of progress that she asked me to begin with.
At the very least she told me that she would talk to the PT trainer and increase the load and maybe a mri after 12 sessions.

With all of that said what I'm looking for is a real connection. Possibly one that could lead somewhere someday.

I'm single and ready to mingle lol. I'm white (european background) but was born and raised in Toronto. Currently have my own place about 20 mins east of downtown. I have a great job that keeps me busy 9-5 mon to friday but I have some free time to spend around those hours. I have a car as well. I have brown hair, brown eyes and I'm in pretty good shape and live a healthy, active lifestyle. I go to the gym regularly and really enjoy doing things outside (while its warm out at least.) Think hiking, biking, going for a run or a long walk around Queen St E. I eat pretty well and take good care of myself. Would love to find a lady who pampers herself, stays in shape, lives a healthy lifestyle and is a good conversationalist. I'm pretty passionate about music, movies, video games and board games. I love horror movies and cuddling up with some snacks as well. Definitely looking for a little spoon and craving some touch.

**COLD OPEN**

**Interior – IT Help Desk Office, 7:45 AM**

Joe is already in the office, which is deeply suspicious on its own.  
He stares at his monitor. Every Word document has a **.dat** extension.  
He looks horrified, like he found out gravity no longer works.

**JOE (whispering to himself):**  
I’ve corrupted… Windows. The *whole* thing.

He presses **Enter** repeatedly, as if that will fix it.

**Cut to opening theme.**

  


**ACT ONE**

**Rich enters, 8:00 AM sharp.**  
Joe appears out of nowhere like he has been waiting behind a plant.

**JOE:**  
Rich! I have an emergency! I think I corrupted Windows!  
All my Word files turned into… *dat.* Dat files!

**RICH (already tired):**  
...Okay, Joe. Slow down. What did you do?

**JOE:**  
Well, Ashley needed Microsoft Office removed and reinstalled on her PC, so I… did it on mine by accident.

Rich stares at him.

**RICH:**  
Joe. Why were you uninstalling anything on *your* PC?

**JOE:**  
I thought they were… connected? Spiritually?  
Like a cloud thing.

Rich silently opens **Control Panel → Programs & Features**.

**RICH:**  
Joe, Office is just… gone. You uninstalled it.

Joe gasps like someone just told him he’s adopted.

  


**ACT TWO**

Rich explains how to reinstall Office. Slowly. Carefully. With patience forged from years of disappointment.

Joe nods like a bobblehead that isn’t connected properly.

**Cut to 10 seconds later.**

Joe calls **Tom**.

**JOE (on phone):**  
Hey Tom, quick question: How do I install Microsoft Office?

Tom stops, mid-coffee sip.

**TOM:**  
Did you not just talk to Rich?

**JOE:**  
Yeah but… I just want to make sure *your* answer matches his.

Tom’s eye twitches.

  


**ACT THREE**

Joe goes to Raj next, who is in the middle of restarting servers.

**JOE:**  
Hey Raj, where is the installer for Off—

**RAJ (not looking up):**  
No.

**JOE:**  
But—

**RAJ:**  
No.

Joe backs away.

  


**CUT TO**

Joe finds Gina.

**JOE:**  
So, uh, how do I reinstall Office?

Gina freezes. She blinks slowly.

**GINA:**  
You’ve worked here **fifteen years.**

Joe nods proudly.

**GINA:**  
And you… don’t know how to install Office.

**JOE:**  
Well I usually just… ask someone.

Gina wonders, once again, why she is making **$7 less per hour** than Joe.

**GINA:**  
No. I’m not doing this today.

She goes back to solving six tickets simultaneously.

  


**ACT FOUR**

Joe dials **HP Support**.

**RAVI (phone):**  
Thank you for calling HP Support, this is Ravi, how may I help—

**JOE:**  
Ravi! My friend! I need your help installing Microsoft Office.

Ravi immediately regrets every life choice that has led to this moment.

**RAVI:**  
Joe… Microsoft Office is not… an HP product.

**JOE:**  
Yeah but you helped me with Foxit that one time, so I figured—

Ravi internally screams.

But he helps anyway.

**Montage:**

* Joe typing slowly
* Ravi explaining things he does not specialize in
* Ravi staring into middle distance
* Ravi dying inside

Finally:

**JOE:**  
YES! It installed!

Ravi nods silently to no one.  
He has seen things today.

  


**EPILOGUE**

Joe walks proudly up to Tom and Rich.

**JOE:**  
Office is reinstalled. Crisis averted.  
Professional problem-solving in action.

Rich and Tom stare, expressionless.

**TOM:**  
…Okay.

**RICH:**  
Good job, Joe.

Joe beams, as if he rebuilt a server farm with his bare hands.

He sits back down and waits for lunch.

  


**TAG SCENE**

Gina, Raj, and Jim watch him eat like he's accomplished nothing.

**GINA:**  
Why does he make more than me?

**RAJ:**  
Dark magic.

**JIM:**  
Union for the incompetent.

**GINA:**  
What are we going to do?

**RAJ:**  
It’s Joe.

1owgoxi,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1owgoxi/accidental_thanksgiving/,Accidental Thanksgiving,"Years ago I had a friend who lived in another town who invited me to come to her home for Thanksgiving. She told me that her elderly mother and father were going to be there and that they both had dementia. She lived in a giant Victorian in a small town. I arrived that day holding my pumpkin pie and knocked on the front door. She came to the door in a towel and said she was in the middle of a shower, but to go to the back door let myself in put the and have some coffee.

I drove around to the back of the building and found the back door and let myself in. Put my pumpkin pie in the refrigerator and poured myself a cup of coffee. I was sitting on the sofa drinking the coffee when a very elderly man walked in the room. He asked me who I was. I told him that I was Mylissa's friend. He looked confused, but then she had told me that her father and mother both had dementia. He decided that I was great aunt Mary or somebody, which is something that sometimes people with dementia do. I sat there and talk to him for quite a while and a woman came out of the back room and the same thing repeated. She asked who I was and he introduced me as a great aunt Mary. It was almost time to eat when I noticed that the magazines on the coffee table did not have Melissa's name on them.

I finally said ""you're not Melissa's parents, are you?"" 

Looking back on this, I was really lucky. These were super nice people who welcome to me into their home on a holiday despite the fact they had no idea who I was. After the whole thing was ironed out and we all had a good laugh, they told me that they thought maybe I was the one with the dementia. Lol",1,1763076926.0,stories,0,1.0,False

1owgkju,https://i.redd.it/3agllt2yz31g1.jpeg,Deep Field Aromatics Forest & Earth Natural Perfume sample reviews!,"Sorry for the repost, forgot the photo!

Not too many reviews of these online, so I figure I may as well contribute! 🤓 Seems like a very nice catalogue, of mainly nature-based scents featuring all-natural ingredients. I’m a pretty serious critic of forest & earth blends, so let’s see how these turn out shall we! *Without further adieu!* 

**Dirtbag** (*cacao, earth, coffee, whiskey, porter, aged tobacco, burnt sugar, decaying cedar woodchips, oakwood CO2, roasted barley, cacao absolute & tincture, vetiver, sandalwood by-absolute, hay absolute*) ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️✨: Oh, this is lovely! Immediately hit with smooth cocoa and super realistic hay, in fact, this is the most genuine hay accord I’ve come across and I’ve sampled quite a few. Soon the smooth booze, aged woods and roasted grains join up with tobacco & the earthy, grassy hay and altogether create a very mature agrestic blend. Definitely unique, with my closest associations being LVNEA’s *L’Etranger* and the extravagant *Sunset in Tennessee* from Jinkoh Store. Basically the same prices as LVNEA’s at 15mL/$70 which does tend towards the expensive end, but I actually still consider it a great deal. This stuff is really good! The sweet, burnt sugar and effervescence of the porter give the dark notes a light touch. More so than masculine or feminine, it comes off *natural*, like you were literally just forking hay in your barn, slugging shots of whiskey and sipping dark chocolate stouts, with an occasional rip of pipe tobacco and sip of black coffee to keep you even. I’m gonna give it an 8.5-9/10! Great start.

**Aubade** (*citron, lime, grass, candied leaves, magnolia blossoms, tea, moss, garden greens, botanical musk, poplar buds, balsam fir, roman chamomile, sandalwood*) ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️✨: Oh man, this is really nice too… wow… the citron, lime and pine are delectable… wow… the ‘candied leaves’ and garden herbs add a beautiful smooth, green sweetness, almost frosty. Chamomile and musk are very deftly administered, adding a homey herbalness and underlying coziness. I didn’t think I was gonna like this one too much… but as always I’m so glad to be proven wrong. If you’re sensitive to lemon & lime I’d beware, but if you enjoy those and herbal-green foresty musks then this is an awesome choice. God dangit… Again, the all natural aspects sing. The tomato leaf is also very subtly blended, which from what I’ve gathered can prove difficult. Uhm, yeah… I’m gonna take my time finishing my sample, and… go from there. 😆 The way some scents make me cave so quick lord give me strength!!! 😩🙏 9/10. Also unique! Though the drydown actually reminds me of that of Maher Olfactive’s *Waking Dream*—another favorite of mine.

**Cave Art** (*chaparral tincture, hiba cedarwood, Alaskan cypress, frankincense, choya ral, labdanum, pink pepper, vanilla absolute, and fossilized amber resin*) ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️✨: Ooh, this one’s fascinating. Smells of sacred areas in the Southwest. Between where the deserts meet the sea, where shrubs & herbs dot the craggy hills lie the remnants of an ancient ritual site, an inlet carved into the hillside of concentric semicircles facing out, a small pit, blackened by the ages of burning resins, in the center. On cool October nights they say from afar you can still see it glowing… This is some of the most authentic ancient incense I’ve come across. Damn, Russell, very impressive so far!!! Woody, earthy, dusty, mineralic, leathery and a little bit medicinal, this thing is a multifaceted beaut. While this is definitely best applied in aid of spiritual, meditative and educational endeavors, it retains a character of mystery and intrigue that might on it’s own register a bit of mass appeal. Really very well done. As is consistent the naturalness is superb. Easy 8.5-9/10.

**Jade Fir** (*bergamot, lime, yuzu, ginger, lavender, geranium, juniper, fir, spruce, poplar bud absolute, patchouli absolute, oakmoss, ambrette seed*) ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️✨: Alright guys Russell is not fuckin’ around. I’m not a big yuzu fan, I was ready to hate on this one, I could even smell it while opening the package and said “*it’s probably Jade Fir…* 😒”… and yet, here I am, ready to eat my words… God damnit Russell!!! 🙄 While the yuzu is strong, it’s very well blended into the ginger, pines and other citrus… Ugh. I’m actually rolling my eyes here. I don’t know why I’m genuinely upset, this is what I do this for, right?! *Right!?!* Ahem. Each smell relinquishes a sigh… Four for four so far is something. Slightly bitter from the juniper but with that nice gin-like bite, this one is super refreshing. Looking forward to slowly going through my sample of this as well. I- I swear, I am!!! Another 8.5-9/10. Sheesh.

**Ochre** (*vetiver absolute, patchouli,  cypriol, tobacco absolute, nutmeg, bergamot*) ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️: Oh, this is another interesting one… It immediately reminded me of something I couldn’t place, though it was on the tip of my tongue… Oh! I believe it’s Soivohle’s *Blood Orange & Vetiver*, which features nutmeg as well. Aha, I do have a little bit of scent-sense! 😆 Yes, these two scents are cousins, *BO&V* the younger brother of just a few years, Ochre just slightly more mature and full bodied. As I enjoy that one, so do I this, though this one perhaps just the slightest bit more with the tasteful additions of cypriol and tobacco. This is indeed very very nice, the spicy nutmeg, rooty vetiver and robust tobacco weaving a smooth, dark tanned blend. Honestly I’m just not the biggest vetiver guy. 8/10.

**Vellichor** (*tea, tobacco, warm spice, antique wood, old paper, leather, clay, earth*) ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️✨: ….. Why….. Why are these all spot on….. You can smell the tea, the old paper, the clay… God the tea and paper are so realistic. One of the best tea notes I’ve come across. Smells a bit like rooibos to me. This is so damn atmospheric. I am mentally reclining on a leather chair, sipping some warming, spiced rooibos and reviewing an ancient manuscript, feet up, glasses down. God damnit. I’m not angry, why would I be angry!?! I’m showing myself to be a nasty person hahaha, it’s almost like I want the guy to fail! 😆 Well at this point maybe I do. 😳 Cause these *cannot! keep! hitting!!!!* 😩 Hahahaha I have honestly not been so flabbergasted by a house in… some time. I almost feel offended for absolutely no reason at all. I’m like, *preposterous!* Hahahaha. What a bizarre frustration. It’s a weird love hate thing. Like, *get out of here!!! … No, no, wait, come back!!!* 😆 Another 8.5-9/10. 

**Viridian** (*white spruce absolute, silver fir cone, bitter yuzu, ginger, cardamom*) ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️: ……… Now this is Christmas in a bottle. My actual first thought was God damnit again but I didn’t want to be cliché. Wow, this is seriously really good though. Ugh, I’ve now begun ushering sighs of defeat, giving up any pretense I once had about anything at all. 😂😭 The ginger is beautiful here. Sparkling in compliment to the tart yuzu and fresh pines, and a very gentle spice from the cardamom… The ginger may actually be the star of the show. Like Jade Fir, this is a relatively simple but surprisingly refreshing blend. Really enjoyable! 8-8.5/10. At this point, I can only say bravo, sir!!! 🥲

**Wave Collapse** (*Sea air, salt spray, green notes, transparent florals, hazy orris, sandalwood, ambrette, deer musk*)(*complementary!*) ⭐️⭐️✨: Ahh… Though I didn’t need it at this point, this is a bit of a relief. One that’s not for me. 😂 It’s still very well done, a salty, green appley musk, but come on. Hahahahaha alright I’m taking shots at this scent profile after all, there’s just something about apple especially combined with a clean musk that smells like many a common feminine shampoo. As a man I wouldn’t be caught *DEAD* in this, you’d have to *KILL ME* to get me to wear it!!! 👹😈😈 Hahahaha sorry now that all that frustration has a place to vent it’s forcing it’s way out all at once. I’m done though. 😂 I’m done!!! So that being said it actually still is well constructed, and the saltiness gives it at least one unconventional twist. I’ll land on a modest 5/10. The deep drydown is actually very good. 

***Conclusion***

And those, my friends, are the eight I was lucky enough to try! I’ll likely have to be back to sample even more, as I’m sure the natural floral blends Russell’s concocted must have at least one intoxicating gem hidden amongst the bunch… Their sillage and longevity, especially considering their all natural statures, are great! Generally moderate and moderate plus I’d say. And the drydowns on each of them were superb. I actually was not pulling any punches on these, since price-wise at $135/30mL they’re on par with the more expensive end of American niche. I wanted to see whether they put their money where their mouth is, and indeed, Russell did not disappoint. Not only do these compete, but they succeed in many an arena. I’m actually quite a bit curious about his education in perfumery, since he’s so young, I’m wondering if he was mentored by anybody. The knowledge employed in these scents nearly replicate those of a master’s—save for any work with oud, which I don’t believe he’s made a product oriented around just yet—though I’m curious of his dabblings. Anyway, I may also have to be back in time for a bit more of Aubade, or maybe even Jade Fir. We shall see! All in all this was a total blast. Hope I don’t come across too annoying. 😆 But if I do I understand. In any case thank y’all so much for reading. :) 🤓🤪☺️

So, knowing I was looking for a new place myself (I'd been homeless for a year and had finally gotten back relatively on my feet) asked if I would like to get a place with them. We'd split the bills 50/50 between me and him because she doesn't work and says she's been ""completely unable to find a job that lets me off before 4"" (when their child gets off school, she's not old enough to look after herself yet.) which I thought was totally reasonable so I jumped at the opportunity given I'd wanted a place with him ever since we were little and I knew our lives and habits lined up relatively well so we shouldn't have too many issues, and we didn't. Not for a good long while. Eventually however I began to notice....annoyances I'll call them with his partner.

It started small. She thought I did a garbage job with the dishes and I conceded that I didn't but was always open to the criticism and owned up to it, I never dodged accountability and even said multiple times I can redo them better but that was never enough and eventually she straight up said I wasn't raised right over them, something that really pissed me off but for the peace of the household I let slide.

Then it started getting less small. If I leave anything, ANYTHING downstairs now I'll find it thrown haphazardly in my room. Now, I know what you must be thinking. ""Well Mr. YordleJay you shouldn't be so messy, you're living with other people."" so let me give you examples. One night, I was sitting in the living room reading Children of Dune (The worst Dune book so far, but I just started GEOD so let's see) and decided to leave it on the coffee table to continue at a later time. Only to find when I came back home from work that the book was thrown open on my bedroom floor (thankfully I don't give a fuck about the physical state of my books or I would've snapped then and there over my newly bent pages) or when I'd left my bottle of chain grease on a shelf by the back door where my bike was locked up as I was literally going to use it the next day for some bike maintenance, also found thrown haphazardly in my room. This happens to ANYTHING I leave ANYWHERE downstairs.

I completely understand wanting a clean living space and I do my upmost to make sure actual garbage is cleaned up and I don't leave dirty dishes laying around but when I can't leave a god damn book on a coffee table without it being all but thrown in my face I get a little annoyed. We live in a house, a home, where people live. Like I'm sorry if the clutter of my existence in the house I PAY HALF THE RENT FOR annoys you to such a degree. This has happened with other things but those are the obvious ones.

I've been yelled at for using the shower during off-peak hours despite me paying those bills myself, I've been snapped at for entering the living room, I got bitched at for leaving my toothbrush on the bathroom counter and it's reached the point where she just refuses to talk to me at all.

Most recently I got yelled at because I only left two eggs that I bought in the fridge despite the fact that if I don't eat the eggs they'll literally sit there for weeks-months without being touched.

All this compounded that I (admittedly willingly and am the one who came up with the idea) have the smallest fucking bedroom in the house so basically everything I own is being shoved into a small 5 by 10 room. Which, normally I'm okay with, I love having a small room I love cramped spaces but when it's basically the only room I can be in without being bitched at it gets pretty fucking annoying.

Oh and she just fucking cooked all the sausages I bought and shared none with me. Fuck that bitch.

I've already talked with him how I feel like I'm being attacked for living in the house that, again, I pay half the rent for the smallest fucking room in the house, and he just brushed me off by saying ""well I get yelled at for that stuff too."" cool bro, that's your fucking partner, I ain't boning the bitch.

I'm already planning an exit strategy in the new year when our lease expires so to be perfectly honest I'm just in appeasement mode until then. I'm planning on getting a maritime job in the new year that will hopefully have me away for weeks on end and ill probably just end up leaving by the end of next year once I have some stable ground under my feet. Until then I just stay in my room, play my games, focus on working and paying off my debt and avoid having any contact with her so she doesn't have a new reason to bitch and moan, although she finds a reason to do it anyways.",3,1763076493.0,TrueOffMyChest,6,0.67,False

That was my first BFF match and i thought we clicked. We’re both women in our 30s and we had a good convo. We met a week later in a coffee shop. Spent a couple of hours there. I thought we had a good time. Good chat and we’ve a lot of similar interests. She seemed sincere and curious. We even made a bunch of plans for (not set in stone) activities. We had a couple brief “awkward pauses” which i think is totally normal for 2 strangers meeting for the first time. 

After i got back home, i wrote her it was nice meeting her, she replied the next day, said it was lovely meeting me, and then sent a bunch of msgs recommending good areas to stay in her home country which i’ll be visiting next year. i told her if she wants to hang out before her going on vacation, feel free to reach out. and then it was radio silence. 


i get that people ghost or that they get busy or lose interest or can even fake how they feel, but since she was my first match (and first bff date), and i did really feel that we clicked, it’s been kinda bothering me for a few days now that she’s just stopped replying. 




i also don’t want to be intrusive or come across as desperate. so if the consensus is that it’s weird to ask, i’ll try to let it go. i could also invite her to one of the activities we spoke about but i don’t think she’ll be down.

  So my wife has ADHD and every productivity app she tried just made her feel worse. Tasks disappearing, streaks guilt-tripping her, that      
  overwhelming ""where do I even start"" paralysis.

  I got fed up watching her struggle and built Sprout for her. Figured it might help others too. Here's what makes it different:

  - ""What to do next"" button - just tells you what to work on. No more staring at your list having a crisis
  - AI breaks down big tasks - got a huge overwhelming project? It splits it into tiny manageable steps
  - Brain Dump feature - literally just talk at your phone and the AI organizes your chaos into actual tasks
  - Your tasks never disappear - they just roll over. No punishment for being human
  - Virtual pet that grows with you - but like, it won't die or guilt trip you. Just vibes
  - Free Days for streaks - take a break without losing everything you built

  Basically it's designed to work WITH ADHD brains instead of against them. The dopamine hits without the crushing shame spiral.

  Free to try, premium if you want the extra AI features and stuff.

1owge64,https://www.reddit.com/r/TriedAndRated/comments/1owge64/the_ringing_in_my_ears_used_to_be_constant_like_a/,The ringing in my ears used to be constant — like a reminder that peace wasn’t for me anymore,"It’s strange how silence becomes something you start to miss.

For years, I thought the ringing in my ears was just stress. I work in sales — lots of phone calls, long drives, noisy offices. I figured the hum I heard at night would go away if I just got more rest. But it didn’t.

At first, it was barely noticeable — a faint buzz that showed up when I lay in bed. Then, slowly, it got louder. Higher pitched. More insistent. Like a mosquito trapped somewhere deep in my head.

By my mid-40s, it wasn’t just at night anymore. I’d hear it in meetings, while watching TV, even during conversations.

That constant sound started eating away at me.

It wasn’t just annoying — it was exhausting. Imagine trying to fall asleep when your brain refuses to give you quiet. I started dreading bedtime because I knew I’d be lying there, listening to that high-pitched whine that wouldn’t stop.

I got snappy with my wife, distant from my kids. I’d sit through family dinners and smile, but inside, I felt disconnected — like I was stuck inside a bubble of noise no one else could hear.

I went to an ENT specialist, hoping for an easy fix. After a bunch of tests, he told me it was tinnitus — and that there wasn’t really a “cure.” Just ways to manage it.

I left that office feeling hopeless. The idea of living like that forever — with this endless ringing in my head — honestly scared me.

I tried everything people suggested. White noise machines, ear drops, sound therapy, even meditation. Some helped a little, but the noise always came back.

What really broke me was the silence — or the lack of it.

My wife loves camping, and last summer we went up to the Smoky Mountains. Everyone else was sitting around the campfire, enjoying the stillness. I sat there smiling, pretending, but inside I wanted to scream. The forest was quiet, but in my head, it sounded like a tea kettle whistling nonstop.

That night in the tent, I lay awake thinking, Is this my life now?

When I got home, I started reading forums about tinnitus — desperate for anything new. Most of it was the same old stuff until one night I came across a comment from a guy who said something that stuck with me.

He said, “It’s not just your ears. It’s your brain’s connection to sound that needs help.”

[He mentioned something called Quietum Plus, saying it helped him calm the internal noise by supporting the auditory system — not masking the sound, but addressing the imbalance causing it.](https://freezegluco.com/QuietumPlus.html)

https://preview.redd.it/a26uld04ns0g1.png?width=225&format=png&auto=webp&s=c835f08db9daf87f3c0e94cdf6dd3d660db9ae6a

Normally, I’d roll my eyes at stuff like that. But this wasn’t an ad, just someone sharing their story. And honestly, I was out of options.

So, I gave it a shot.

The first week, I didn’t expect anything. The ringing was still there — maybe a little less sharp, but still present. But by week two, something started changing.

It wasn’t gone, but it felt… softer. Less demanding. Like someone turned the volume down a notch.

Then one morning, I woke up and realized I’d slept through the entire night without noticing the ringing once. It was still faintly there when I paid attention — but my brain wasn’t fixating on it anymore.

That’s when I knew something was actually shifting.

Over the next few weeks, things just kept improving. My focus came back. I could actually listen to my kids without that constant hum distracting me. Watching TV felt normal again. And at night, I could finally fall asleep without the anxiety that had haunted me for years.

I don’t think people realize how much something like that can mess with your mind. When you live with constant noise in your head, it starts bleeding into everything — your patience, your peace, your personality.

When it started fading, it wasn’t just about hearing better. It was about feeling normal again.

The moment that hit me hardest was during a Sunday morning walk. I was out early, before the world woke up — no cars, no chatter, just the wind and a few birds. And for the first time in years, I heard silence.

Actual silence.

I stopped walking and just stood there. It sounds dramatic, but I got emotional. I didn’t realize how much I’d missed the quiet until I got a piece of it back.

Since then, life feels different. Not perfect — the ringing still comes and goes, especially when I’m stressed — but it’s manageable. It doesn’t control me anymore.

I can sit in a quiet room and feel peace instead of frustration.

My wife noticed the change too. She says I laugh more now. I think that’s true. Because when your head finally quiets down, you start noticing all the sounds you missed — your kids’ laughter, the hum of morning coffee, the soft sounds of life you used to take for granted.

If I learned anything from all this, it’s that silence isn’t just the absence of sound — it’s the presence of calm.

And for the first time in a long time, I have that again.",1,1763076153.0,TriedAndRated,0,1.0,False

Food costs have skyrocketed, labor is brutal, and margins that used to make restaurants the holy grail pre-covid are now razor thin.

I’m seeing cost-cutting everywhere — trash pick-up scaled back from 2–3x a week to once, cheaper ingredients replacing quality ones, swapping to well liquor, downsizing team members, etc. And you know what’s always one of the first things to get cut?

**Marketing budgets.**

But here’s the truth:  
If customers are going out less…and you’re doing less marketing…you disappear faster than ever.

Because of this, I put together a **starter 5-day content calendar** \- specifically for Mexican restaurant owners — something simple, doable, and actually designed to help you stay visible *without* needing a full marketing team or expensive agency package.

I’m starting with **Mexican restaurants**, because listen… chips + salsa? My happy place. And I can market the hell out of some queso-dripping nachos, big saucy burritos, and the easiest sell in the world: margaritas. Absolute *slay*.

This content calendar is built for beginners:

* simple ideas
* easy execution
* no fancy equipment
* no overthinking
* designed to get you posting consistently
* built to get customers thinking about your food again

A great burrito sells itself — you just have to show people it exists.

If you want the free calendar, just comment ""Taco!""

I’ll be releasing more soon for different niches (seafood, coffee shops, sports bars, upscale dining, bakeries, etc.). Comment your niche to request yours.

We need restaurants to stay alive out here. Keep it simple, keep it consistent, and keep showing up. More calendars coming soon. 🌮📸",0,1763076109.0,restaurant,5,0.22,False

I agreed. It was never really an issue, she made some comments about how she would see what I’m doing on my vacations, etc. but I brushed it off. Well then I started dating someone out of state. Fast forward a year or so, I moved to that state to be closer to him. She still follows my location, and she uses it to decide when she’ll give me a call (which is very often). When she sees I’m driving to work. When she sees I’m at home. And she still comments on what I’m doing without me telling her (“oh I saw you were at a new coffee shop yesterday.”). It feels kind of creepy, like she’s crossing a boundary, yet I’ve given her permission to have my location at all times. It makes our relationship feel less authentic when we talk since she always knows what I’m up to anyways. And while this bothers me, it also isn’t the end of the world.

1owgazc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Informal_Effect/comments/1owgazc/h_g_9/,"H, G. 9","Monday morning hit with the subtle violence of a damp towel.  
Usually, Mondays were a grey affair. I would drag myself out of bed, chug coffee in a silent kitchen, and mourn the loss of the weekend. But this Monday, I woke up with an arm draped over my waist and a nose pressed into the back of my neck.  
Silas was a furnace. He slept like the deadheavy, immobile, and taking up seventy percent of the mattress.  
I carefully extricated myself, showering and dressing for my office job. The dynamic in the apartment had shifted on a molecular level. The silence wasnt empty anymore; it was companionable. When Silas finally shambled into the kitchen, hair sticking up in every direction, scratching his stomach, he didnt just grunt at me.  
He walked right up to me, wrapped his arms around my waist, and rested his chin on my shoulder while I waited for the toaster.  
""Mornin,"" he rumbled, his voice a gravel pit.  
""Morning,"" I replied, trying to keep my heart rate within a medically acceptable range. ""Youre gonna be late.""  
""I open the shop. They wait for me.""  
That was the commanding presence. He wasnt the boss of Millers Auto Repair, but he might as well have been. The shop didnt run until Silas Gray unlocked the bay doors.  
I went to work, but my focus was shot. I spent the morning staring at spreadsheets and thinking about the ""partner"" label. It felt heavy, significant, and terrifyingly new.  
By noon, I was restless. I decided to do something Id never done in the two years wed lived together. I grabbed two sandwiches from the deli down the street and drove to the garage.  
Millers Auto was a chaotic symphony of air compressors, clanging metal, and classic rock blaring from a tinny radio. The smell of oil and exhaust was thick enough to chew.  
I parked and walked toward the open bay doors. I spotted him immediately.  
He was under a lifted F150, standing in the pit, his upper body obscured. But I knew those legs, clad in greasestained denim, and the beat up work boots.  
There were two other guys in the bayRick, a burly older guy with a mullet, and a younger kid I didnt know. They were looking at a schematic on a tablet, looking confused.  
""Im tellin you, the sensor is fried,"" Rick was saying.  
""It aint the sensor,"" Silass voice echoed from under the truck. It was calm, bored, and loud enough to cut through the shop noise.  
He emerged from the pit, wiping his hands on a rag. He was covered in grime. A smudge of grease highlighted his cheekbone like war paint. He looked rough, dangerous, and incredibly capable.  
He saw me instantly. It was that witchy radar of his. He didnt look surprised. He didnt look embarrassed to see his office worker boyfriend standing there in khakis holding a paper bag.  
He just stopped wiping his hands and walked straight toward me.  
The other mechanics went quiet. The air changed. I felt a sudden spike of anxiety. This was his world. This was the ""assbackwards"" part of his life, full of rough edges and traditional masculinity. We hadnt talked about... us here.  
""Asa,"" he said, stopping a foot away. ""Problem?""  
""No,"" I said, lifting the bag. ""Just... lunch. Thought you might be hungry.""  
Silas looked at the bag, then at me. His face softened, that subtle shift that only I knew how to read.  
""Turkey and swiss?"" he asked.  
"" Roast beef. Extra horseradish.""  
""Good man.""  
""Hey, Si, whos this?"" Rick called out, stepping forward. He was grinning, but there was that assessing look in his eyes. The look that asked, does he belong here?  
I braced myself. I expected Silas to be vague. My roommate. My buddy.  
Silas turned slowly. He didnt step away from me. He actually stepped closer, his shoulder brushing mine.  
""This is Asa,"" Silas said. His voice was flat, challenging. ""My partner.""  
The word hung in the air, suspended between the tire iron and the impact wrench.  
Rick blinked. ""Partner? Like... business partner?""  
Silas looked at Rick. He held the gaze for three uncomfortable seconds. He let the silence stretch, let Rick do the math, let the realization land.  
""No, Rick,"" Silas drawled, his accent getting thicker, sharper. ""Like the guy who sleeps in my bed. Partner.""  
The young kid dropped a wrench. Clang.  
Ricks eyebrows shot up. He looked from Silaslarge, imposing, covered in greaseto me. He looked like his brain was rebooting.  
Then, Silas turned back to me, dismissing them entirely. ""Come on. Lets eat on the tailgate.""  
He led me to the back of his truck, parked outside in the sun. We sat on the tailgate, legs dangling. He unwrapped his sandwich and took a massive bite.  
""You... you just told them,"" I whispered, watching Rick and the kid whispering furiously by the tool chest.  
""You wanted me to lie?"" Silas asked, chewing.  
""No, but... arent you worried? About... I dont know. Its a garage, Silas.""  
Silas swallowed. He looked at the sandwich, then looked at me with those hazel, intelligent eyes.  
""Asa,"" he said calmly. ""Im the best mechanic in three counties. I can diagnose a transmission by smell. I bring in eighty percent of the repeat business.""  
He took another bite, savoring the horseradish.  
""And,"" he added, pointing the sandwich at me, ""Im six foot two and I dont smile. Nobodys gonna say a damn word to me. Or you.""  
It was arrogance, pure and simple. But it was earned. It was the intellectual sweetheart recognizing his leverage and using it with ruthless efficiency.  
""Besides,"" he said, his voice dropping, becoming softer. ""Im done hiding. Its exhausting. Takes up too much RAM.""  
I laughed, surprising myself. ""RAM?""  
""Processor power,"" he tapped his temple. ""Keepin track of lies slows down the system. I got better things to think about.""  
""Like what?""  
He looked at me, his gaze traveling over my face, cataloging every detail. ""Like how you look in the sunlight. And how much I want to take you home right now.""  
I felt the blush creep up my neck. ""Silas.""  
""Eat your sandwich, Ace,"" he said, bumping my shoulder with his. ""Lunch breaks only thirty minutes.""  
We ate in the sun, swinging our legs off the tailgate. Rick eventually waved awkwardly at us. Silas nodded back, once, regal as a king.  
He was right. He was commanding. He was undeniable. And he was mine.",1,1763075916.0,Informal_Effect,0,1.0,False

* Easy enough to use early in the morning before work
* Works well for one person, maybe two cups a day

1owg63q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Manipulation/comments/1owg63q/seeking_support_a_semester_of_psychological/,Seeking Support: A Semester of Psychological Manipulation from My Professor,"It began on the first day of class I attended. I sat in the second row, wanting to make a good impression and appear smart and focused. The professor was young, and I remember feeling amazed that someone her age could already be a professor.

She noticed me and said she was seeing new students. Her eyes landed on me. I replied, ""Yes, it's my first class with you."" She explained that the previous class had done an activity to talk about themselves. I began to talk, and I was so talkative and open that I felt a flush of embarrassment afterward. But she was also deeply emotional. She shared long, personal stories from her own life, and her eyes—shiny with feeling—kept locking onto mine, as if I were validating something deep inside her.

Our conversation lasted longer than any other. In the final minute, she looked away and muttered to herself, quietly, ""I think I over-shared.""

The next class, everything shifted. The connection was severed. She stopped making eye contact. If I sat in a certain aisle, she would change her entire path across the room to avoid walking near me. Her voice, when it had to land in my direction, was cold and distant. I felt so uncomfortable that I moved my seat to the back, far away from her, as if we were both ashamed.

Then, a new ritual began. During any activity that placed her in front of the students, she would find me. Her eyes would lock onto mine from across the room, holding for five, eight, ten seconds without a single blink or shift, staring into me. Then, she would simply say, ""Hi."" On one occasion, she handed out mirrors to the class for what she called an ""educational"" purpose, though it seemed unnecessarily simple. When she handed me mine, she looked directly into my eyes, and it wasn't just a smile; it felt like she was looking straight through my soul.

I started to see a pattern with my own sadness. If my face looked down or upset, she would never acknowledge me directly. Instead, she would turn to whatever girl was sitting beside me and tell her to ""smile."" She did this over and over. She also began calling on students who had names that sounded like mine, using a specific, knowing tone, a hook meant for my attention alone.

There was an attendance incident. She was taking roll by sight, looking at each student to mark them present. When she got to my name on her list, she looked up at the whole room and announced, ""I don't know who you are. Are you present?"" I said, ""Yes."" I could feel the sadness on my face and looked down at my phone. For the first part of the semester, she repeatedly claimed not to know my name, even though I was sure she knew it from the start.

During a paired activity, I was working with a classmate. From the front of the room, the professor repeatedly told my partner to ""come closer."" When my partner explained that we were working together, the professor suggested we sit in different rows. When my partner said that would make it impossible to collaborate, the professor finally replied, ""Okay then, next time come closer."" It felt deliberately rude, an attempt to make me feel like a ghost.

That same day, I had been late. I arrived and took my seat. She took attendance and marked me absent. After class, I went to her to ask her to correct it.

""I was late,"" I said. She replied, sharply, ""I know!"" I asked, ""Do you really know?"" I was shocked she had acknowledged my name. Instead of answering, she opened old slides on her computer and began lecturing me on the late policy. I cut her off, saying, ""I know!!! No need for that."" Then, she misstated my name. I asked, ""What's my name?"" She said my name slowly, dragging it out. I corrected her: ""That's not my name."" She seemed flustered and asked, ""Then who did I put absent?"" Then, she completely turned away from me and asked another student if they had a question, leaving me standing there. After a moment, she looked back and asked me, ""Do you have any questions?"" Frustrated, I said, ""Yes,"" and asked a question about the project. I was furious. She had shown me a completely different, cold face and refused to even listen. She seemed angry, too.

In the next class, she took attendance and again claimed she didn't know my name. That day, she also gave me the long, silent stare, followed by the ""Hi,"" as if she were alerting my brain to some upcoming event.

After that class, she called me over. She said, ""I'm sorry for what happened before,"" referring to the day I was late. ""I'm sorry, sorry."" I said, ""It's okay."" Then she took my hand, holding it with both of hers. She said she was sorry for not seeing me when I sat down early in this class, and that she hadn't known I was there. I felt she was apologizing for a small, meaningless thing to avoid apologizing for our big argument. Then she added, ""Sometimes the girls come beg me and cry, that's why I'm doing this."" I just repeated, ""It's fine.""

The toll on me became physical. For weeks, I couldn't sleep the night before her class. My heart would pound just thinking about her. I developed a nervous habit, raising my right shoulder in class, a tension I didn't even notice until much later. She always seemed to know when I wasn't paying attention, and if I tried to ask her a question after class, her demeanor was so cold I couldn't bring myself to like her. After the apology day, I remember the next class I was so drained I didn't look at her at all and she would do the triangulation thing to a girl in front of me to tell her to smile. The professor always seemed very emotional and her eyes looked so sparkly, but I remember when I was taking my things and wanted to leave I saw her eyes were so cold without any emotions that I couldn't forget! Is it because I didn't feel the love bombing that she gave me on the apology day???

I began to see the copying. She started wearing the same specific colors I had worn in previous weeks. She also began arriving at class extremely early, just as I always did.

A week or so later, she created an anonymous survey for the class. I answered it logically, without emotion. I wrote that I would understand the material better if there were more pictures and visuals, because I learn that way. I also suggested focusing more on psychological concepts rather than just hard science.

The very next class, everything I had written in the survey was implemented. She had added many more pictures and diagrams to her slides. She also shifted the lecture's focus directly onto psychology, talking about emotions and the mind. It felt like a direct response to my anonymous feedback.

Then, during that same class, she pointed to a student sitting next to me—a girl who seemed clueless about the context—and said to her, ""I add more psychology stuff,"" as if they had previously discussed it. She then began presenting in a very emotional way, talking about how trust is built through touch and speaking about heavy mental health topics. It was clear she knew it was me who had written the suggestions, and she was letting me know she knew, creating a secret channel of communication between us that no one else understood. ^ How do I know she could know it was me? Because all the students were loving her and the survey was full of positive and emotional responses. Just me who wrote it logically!

The day of my presentation arrived. Before it began, during a quiz, she told everyone to put their belongings at the front. I was one of the first to do it, walking right past her and making eye contact. When she came to hand me my quiz paper, she looked at the coffee and water I had kept on my desk and said, ""Your things."" I said, ""Huh?"" She repeated, ""Did you put your things?"" I mumbled, ""Amm,"" or ""Yah,"" even though she had just watched me put my bag away.

After the quiz, she went to the calendar and pretended to check who was presenting. She read my name aloud. When I raised my hand, she said, ""[My Name],"" and then added, ""...she has been ready, wow.""

During my presentation, I started nicely but then I saw her standing in the door next to me! Which is not normal for her to be there she always sat in a student chair, when i noticed she was beside me my voice broke and when our eyes met I started to shake my voice and my body. I became so nervous I had to stop. I held my hand over my heart, pointed directly at her, and said, ""Wait!!."" I stopped for a full minute, closed my eyes, and took a deep, deliberate breath to calm myself before I could continue. When I finished, she looked at me with teary eyes, and she wanted to compliment my topic but she couldn’t talk because I was not feeling the vibe of her talking so she stopped.

Then, when she started her own presentation, her voice was stressed and unsteady, clearly reflecting my own just moments before! I was so pissed off, I just finished hearing my own cracking voice, and now I hear her copying it! It didn't feel like empathy; it felt like an act, a fake imitation.

In the next class, I was so normal that I didn't feel embarrassed but do you know what happened? She wore the exact color that I was wearing! Her slides included the same data I added in my presentation!!! Her lectures began to include topics like “-” (a method I used in my presentation), then talking about the concept of feeling another person's physical pain like if u see someone in pain you feel it, and the psychology of empathy and mirroring. ^ Did she just want to make sure that I see her imitating as empathy!

The next week is the last week of the semester! I'm so happy!!!

I'm not sure if I wrote the story in the right way, but I just want to know if I'm overthinking, I might explain in detail! Ask me more if you have any questions!

Note: her personality is so emotional but the fake one, that she would shift very fast from feeling wanting to cry to laughing, she would make everyone feel she is so sweet, but for me I always see her as fake, and I'm the person who would read her like a book, and be silent and not emotional, also my eyes look cold after the late class day, because I couldn’t feel her truth.",2,1763075558.0,Manipulation,0,1.0,False
1owg5q7,https://www.reddit.com/r/phinvest/comments/1owg5q7/merkado_barkada_is_shutting_down/,Merkado Barkada is shutting down,"Today is Merkado Barkada's last episode.

When I started this in May of 2019, I had no idea how far it would go or how big it would get. I just wanted to make better sense of the PSE and share what I was learning while I was learning it, and somehow, that turned into a daily ritual shared with thousands of you. 

Writing this newsletter has been one of the most rewarding things I've ever done. It's also been one of the most challenging. But with challenge comes growth, and I can't believe how much I've learned and experienced as a direct result of publishing Merkado Barkada and interacting with you on a daily basis.

I'm shutting MB down at a time that is right for me. While I still love the market and will always trade in some capacity or another, my desire to float over to the keyboard after all of my family members have gone to sleep to write three stories plus REIT and IPO commentary blurbs has been low for quite some time this year.

I still love the feeling I get when I start a new Google Doc to write, as I imagine what fun things I could talk about that might interest you, entertain you, or show you something new. Maybe it's just a part of being five years older, but I'm starting to feel the extra hours that I try to sneak into MB to make it as consistent and engaging as I want it to be. 

I'm going to end this run with 1,426 episodes. That's easily 4300 direct hours spent on researching, writing, and memes, but that doesn't include all of the time that I've put into trying to grow MB's reach through advertising, business partnerships, and special episodes like my Inside the Boardroom interview series. 

I feel like I've put an incredible amount of work into this project. I'm proud of the results, even if I can't take a victory lap to celebrate without ruining my anonymity.

But it's time for me to put that time and energy into something different. 

I want to share more of it with my family. At the very least, I want to give them a better version of myself, one that is not always marginally underslept and overcaffeinated.

Before I sign off, I really need to thank all of the people who have made MB possible. 

This starts with my wife and my kids, who have supported me in this weird journey either directly, by giving me time and space to write, or indirectly, by adapting to the presence of MB in our lives. Thank you!

But I also want to thank my friends, my in-laws, and my own parents for being readers, and for being people I could talk to about the newsletter when writing it felt too big or too lonely. My dad, in particular, was usually the first hit me up with a ""No MB today??"" text if I misconfigured the send and the newsletter failed to deliver. Thank you!

A huge thank you goes out to Jewel, who has been Employee #1 for years, and who has helped drag me through so many rough mornings with her amazing consistency and dedication to the MB project. Thank you, Jewel!

If anybody needs a remote assistant who is deadly consistent and great at doing all of the weird things that come up while running a startup, please get in touch directly with her [here](mailto:mbjewel.merkadobarkada@gmail.com).

Thank you also to all the readers who contributed directly to MB through Patreon (I'm still left speechless by your generosity and support), to all of the readers who have given me feedback, made suggestions, and helped with different aspects of the production process. Especially early on, this kind of help was critical! Thank you!

To all the readers who commented on socmed or reached out to write me emails or DMs to discuss topics, thank you for giving me that psychological boost. I may not have been too quick to respond, but your comments and messages were like spiritual coffee for me. Thank you to anyone who ever took a moment out of their day to write in to say something to me. Thank you!

I'm not really sure what comes next for me, or for Merkado Barkada. 

There's a chance that I'd like to continue to write in the future. Maybe not in a daily way, but for special occasions like an IPO or big market event. But maybe not? I'm actually just hoping to mentally disengage a bit from the part of my brain that feels compelled to be productive. 

Whatever comes next, I hope that you and your family will be safe, that your investments will prosper. 

It's been an honor to be invited into your inbox each morning. 

From the bottom of my heart, thank you.

**I (32M) met Emma (36F) on Facebook Dating. We became close friends and running buddies, but I wasn't romantically interested. Emma had a massive crush on my ex-boss, Jake, and constantly confided in me about him, making me feel like a stand-in. I finally confessed that her talking about Jake bothered me intensely. When she promised to stop, I ended the friendship, saying it was unfair for her to lose her ""authenticity."" Now I don't understand why I got so upset, and I'm questioning if I was actually in love or just jealous of Jake.**

**Apologies, English is not my native language.**

I met this girl on Facebook Dating, let's call her Emma (36). We quickly connected over chat because we both like cats and sports. Then we arranged a date and went for a coffee.

At first, she didn't really catch my attention when I saw her IRL (she didn't have a photo of her face on the app). She talked a lot about herself and hardly let me speak. She seemed to want to vent about a knee injury that prevented her from competing (she is a high-performance runner).

At one point during the first date, she told me that in her physical therapy sessions she had met someone who also works at the company where I work. I asked her his name and she gave me his full name. I was greatly surprised when I heard the name: it was my boss last year, let’s call my ex-boss Jake. It felt weird because I sensed she had a particular interest in Jake, but I let it go, thinking it was my imagination. We realized we live super close, about a 10-minute walk away.

The date ended, and since I didn't feel much interest in her because she didn't seek to learn about me, she only talked about herself, and I sensed that interest in Jake, I decided not to talk to her again. The next day she messaged me; I didn't expect that to happen. I kept chatting with her, and then we continued meeting up to run, go to the club, go to a marathon, etc.

On the second outing, she told me she considered me her friend and confessed that she had experienced a huge crush—like she had never felt before in her life—on Jake, but Jake has a girlfriend. It’s important to mention that Jake and Emma connected very well during the physical therapy sessions, according to what Emma told me.

I am not interested in her romantically; she's not my type, and I feel she is a very traditional woman, but she has an amazing personality and always has ideas of what we can do together. She was looking for a girlfriend for me so maybe I could get a romantic partner, and I tried to do the same for her—find her a boyfriend. It was a real friendship.

Every time we went out, all 8 times, she talked about Jake. She talked to me about Jake on WhatsApp, she sent me a photo of Jake, and a Reel featuring two people who liked each other but decided to be friends, obviously in reference to Jake.

The last day we saw each other, we went to the track to run. Jake was also there that day. Emma had arrived before me, and when she saw me, she didn't even say hello; the first thing she did was say, 'Did you see who is here? It's Jake!' I felt bad, I don't know why. Later, when we were saying goodbye, she told me how she hugged Jake when she greeted him and hugged me to show me how she did it. That killed me. That conversation and the hugging gesture happened right as I was leaving, so the last time I saw her was a demonstration of how she hugged Jake. I didn't say anything, I just smiled.

That night she messaged me and asked if it bothered me that she talked about Jake. I was honest and told her yes. Then she told me she would never talk about Jake again. She once told me that she liked being around people where she could be authentic. I remembered that, and since she wouldn't be able to talk about Jake, I told her it was better if we cut off communication and didn't see each other for a while, because it was unfair that she couldn't talk about Jake and that I would continue to enjoy her company and her ideas for activities. She was losing the ability to express her feelings for Jake, and I was losing a companion for outings.

She didn't take it well, and we haven't spoken since. That happened about 14 days ago.

I don't understand why it bothered me that she talked about Jake so much. Deep down, was I falling for her? Was I jealous of Jake? I can't figure out what's going through my mind",3,1763074868.0,AskMenAdvice,6,0.71,False

I’ve been rewatching Gilmore Girls (again… obviously 😄) and realized just how many amazing books are referenced throughout the show. From Rory’s Chilton and Yale reading lists to the random bookish moments sprinkled all over Stars Hollow, there’s *so* much material to explore.

So I thought… why not start a **Gilmore Girls–inspired book club**?

**The idea:**  
We read through the books mentioned in the series — everything from classics to modern picks — and discuss them together here. We can follow Rory’s reading list, tackle them season by season, or choose books based on themes, vibes, or character moments.

**Format thoughts:**

* Monthly picks
* Discussion threads + optional spoiler threads
* Occasional watch-along discussions of episodes featuring the books
* Bonus: “What Would Lorelai Say?” tangent section encouraged 😅

**First step:**  
Just want to see who’d be interested! Drop a comment if you’d like to join, and feel free to suggest our first book. I’m thinking something iconic like *The Bell Jar*, *Pride and Prejudice*, or *The Catcher in the Rye* — but open to anything from the show’s massive list.
