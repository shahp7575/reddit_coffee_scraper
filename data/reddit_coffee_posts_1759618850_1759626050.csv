# Cheap, decent coffee isn‚Äôt to everyone‚Äôs taste

Sep 25th 2025|BERLIN|2 min read

NEW Coffee shops rarely make the evening news anywhere. But this month LAP Coffee was featured on Tagesthemen, one of Germany‚Äôs most-watched broadcasts. It added its first outlet in Hamburg, in the trendy Schanzenviertel, to the 16 outlets in Berlin and four in Munich that it has opened in just two years.

Why is LAP‚ÄîLife Among People, founded by Ralph Hage and Tonalli Arreola, two veterans of the Berlin startup scene‚Äîmaking waves? For its fans, who are mostly in their 20s and 30s, it is a hip place with great coffee at low prices. LAP sells an espresso for just ‚Ç¨1.50 ($1.78), a cappuccino for ‚Ç¨2.50 and a flat white for ‚Ç¨3. Its fancy specials (current offer: blueberry matcha, yuzu lemonade, protein coffee) are popular with young customers.

‚ÄúWe want to be a lifestyle brand for coffee to go,‚Äù says Mr Hage, who grew up in Lebanon, where social life revolved around coffee houses. He is also keen to foster a community of ‚Äúbike couriers, Gen-Z students and artists‚Äù in the Kiez (neighbourhood) by opening his shops for yoga classes, concerts, book presentations and exhibitions by local painters.

But LAP is not everyone‚Äôs cup of tea. For its detractors, who are especially virulent online, it is a symbol of urbane turbo-capitalism, promoting gentrification, undercutting older coffee houses and pushing them into bankruptcy. They have sprayed graffiti on LAP shops and insulted staff. Mr Hage thinks LAP‚Äôs foes have never been to one of his shops. With sparse seating in small spaces, they don‚Äôt invite people to linger and so don‚Äôt poach coffee-house customers, who might stay for hours.

Messrs Hage and Arreola picked a tough market. In the decades after the second world war most Germans drank Bl√ºmchenkaffee, coffee so thin that you could see the little flowers (Bl√ºmchen) painted inside the cups. They are still a parsimonious lot, who shop at Aldi, Lidl and other discounters. They guzzle around 90% of their coffee at home or the office (Italians drink only 70% of theirs at home).

Mr Hage would like to lure more stay-at-home Germans. He says he keeps prices down, while turning a profit, by providing just the essentials, making coffee in fully automated machines with staff frothing the milk by hand. At LAP on Kantstrasse in Berlin, your correspondent‚Äôs drink-in cappuccino came in a cup with no saucer or spoon. It tasted good and the price was roughly half that at three chic caf√©s nearby. Had she wanted to linger a little, though, she‚Äôd have gone to one of them. ‚ñ†

Me and my uncle were very close that I witnessed how he enjoyed life to the fullest before getting married. 

When he got married I thought He will stop fooling around ,hooking up and going to bars and all. 

One day I went to his office for a usual visit and talk about business. Then I saw an average woman in her 40""s ( properly dressed and very pormal ). I greeted good morning she excitedly said Hi! Hello I am Donna. Oh hey J, this is donna my good friend. The day went on casually. Normal. I ended up going home after handing over my Purchase Order to uncle. Confortably i went home with a beso beso with donna. 

Months after i would see donna during family gatherings and even office and company events making besos beso with my uncle""s wife and kids. 

I found out later that donna worked in an international drug company with a good position. I already had the feeling something was going on here. 

One day the three of us went to a private beach for dinner. To cut to the chase, i know they are into something but i dont know why my uncle invited me. Anyway after strolling around the beach I accidentally passed by our Van and it was moving up and down obviously umaandar and lumilindol sa loob and i could see the shadow of donna as She got long hair with her boobs shaping from a distance. 

So binantayan ko from a far. After maybe 20 minutes they went out smiling went back to the table and i followed after na parang wala lang and ordered beer. 

We went home. And the following day my uncle called me to visit his office. We had a great coffee talk until he said. J, theres something i wosh to tell you. What you saw last night was me and donna fucking. Weve been friends and at times maybe once or once every 2 months we meet and fuck. Sometimes here in the Office CR car or anywhere safe and get thrilled. Your tita donna is not married but she has a fiancee. 

Though i was not shocked I asked how you  he managed it. He simply said well act normally.  

I was already married during that time in my 30""s and now I am 50 and my uncle is 60. I could say I have achieved great in life na rin and got a good family and a small business. 

Why is it that I got jealous? Something is telling me can I try the same set up

This is the last Session that'll be posted strictly on Reddit, as I'm building a Substack for my creative house, *Daydream Engine*. Through Daydream I will both oversee the publishing of robust, novel-length Actual Plays for games such as Cyberpunk Red, the publishing of our own adult TTRPGs *The Land of Deklan Dawn* and *Suburban Secrets,* and the publishing of the full-length dark fantasy novel *The Dreamer's Damnation* by Richter Breil.

This session is about the overall day in the life of an aspiring musician in Night City 2046, during the Time of the Red. It's not an easy life, but the people in it make it worthwhile.

This session depicts play with the Quick and Dirty combat, and contains a GM decision I made which ostensibly changes the rules, so I can hope its understood why I made it. With all due respect to the design of Single Player, which is great, I can't say that I find Quick and Dirty to be quick, dirty, or fun.

This session utilizes stuff from Black Chrome and the Danger Girl Dossier.

As always, feedback is welcome.

**2D6 Roll: Apartment Buildings -> 8 (L‚ÄôErmitage, a high-end apartment complex in Charter Hill)**

L‚ÄôErmitage fit perfectly with Hiroshi‚Äôs impeccable standard of living, but what I liked about Rika and Hiroshi was that they were never sparse with their hospitality. They hosted parties often, and despite my close friendship with my Trauma Team supervisor and mentor, Rika Delabonte, I think they mostly invited me because they knew I‚Äôd always be down to play background guitar.

The security guard at L‚ÄôErmitage‚Äôs eight-level garage didn‚Äôt bother to check for Hiroshi‚Äôs ID‚Äîhe just waved him through. Hiroshi drove up to the fifth level, parked the car, and we headed to that level‚Äôs apartment corridor entrance. He tipped his eyes toward the camera above the door, and it buzzed before opening for him. I followed him inside and down the hallway until we reached 5-209.

He knocked on the door. ‚ÄúBabygirl, you decent?‚Äù

‚ÄúWait!‚Äù Rika called out from the other side. We waited a full minute. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm good now!‚Äù

Hiroshi opened the door by putting his right wrist against the mag-scanner. Hiroshi and Rika‚Äôs two-bedroom apartment was magnificent, with a huge single sliding-glass window that overlooked the entire Nightlife District and the robust Hacienda Hotel and Casino. Rika, with her hair done in a single long ponytail, stood behind the kitchen counter, dressed in a white T-shirt, blue jeans, and green, fluffy slippers. She passed a mug of coffee to Hiroshi, and then another to me.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre looking a lot better than when I left you, Pan,‚Äù Rika said, chipper, a smile on her face.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna guess that the fact I‚Äôm even still among the living is ‚Äôcause of you,‚Äù I replied.

‚ÄúYou wouldn‚Äôt be far off the mark there, but like I wrote in that text, you‚Äôve more got Doc Fogerty to thank for that.‚Äù

I sipped my coffee. ‚ÄúYou did say he wasn‚Äôt the cold-blooded, boring bastard that I had him pegged as.‚Äù

‚ÄúNah, you got it half-right. He‚Äôs pretty boring. But do you want some stuffy guy who reads medical books for fun operating on you when you‚Äôve got six life-threatening lacerations, or a nepo-baby like‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a nepo baby.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot a Trauma Team one.‚Äù

I snickered and sipped my coffee, then took a seat on a stool at the tan-marbled kitchen island.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve got some good news and bad news,‚Äù Rika began.

‚ÄúGood first.‚Äù

‚ÄúClearly, you‚Äôre alive and well, and back to being a badass after you get your full memory back, which should be by this time tomorrow.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe bad news?‚Äù

‚ÄúCorporate is charging you for the care that was provided to you tonight.‚Äù

I nearly did a spit-take. ‚ÄúBullshit!‚Äù

‚ÄúNo bulls, no shit, partner.‚Äù

Hiroshi shook his head and sipped his coffee as he observed.

‚ÄúThe information should be on your employee account by now,‚Äù Rika continued, ‚Äúbut I can tell you the number if you want more bad news.‚Äù

‚ÄúMight as well tell me.‚Äù

‚ÄúTwo-K.‚Äù

‚ÄúBullshit.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo bulls, no shit.‚Äù

I pressed my palm against my right temple. ‚ÄúFuck. Fuck. Fuck. You‚Äôre saying I‚Äôm in debt to my goddamn employer? That‚Äôs‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúTwo months‚Äô rent on a cargo container, if I‚Äôm not mistaken, and you probably only make twelve hundred a month on the job as it is right now. If you were full-time like me, Trauma Team would‚Äôve covered your care expenses, but you‚Äôre part-time. I‚Äôm sorry, Pan.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt feel bad,‚Äù Hiroshi added. ‚ÄúSeventy-five percent of Trauma Team‚Äôs force is part-time‚Äîeven the doctors.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow am I supposed to pay this back?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou keep working your scheduled days, and corporate takes eighty percent out of your checks until the debt is paid. Two thousand is nothing compared to other bills I‚Äôve seen racked up.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat if I say ‚Äòfuck it‚Äô and quit?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Äôll send you to collections, your credit is fucked, and they might even try to get a wage-garnishment order with whoever you get a new job with. Matter of fact, if they press it in circuit court, they‚Äôll definitely get it. That doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôll go through the effort, and maybe you can skirt by without ever paying the debt‚Äîbut you‚Äôll never be able to work with Trauma Team again. Where else are you going to find even part-time steady work right now, Pan?‚Äù

‚ÄúI won‚Äôt be able to make rent like this.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the 4th of the month. You‚Äôve got 26 days to work something out. You‚Äôve had more desperate crunches than this.‚Äù

That was true. Further true was that, in one form or another, I was in some semblance of this situation every month. That‚Äôs what it meant to be poor not just during the Time of the Red, but anytime and anyplace in the world.

‚ÄúBefore he left to pick you up, Hiro and I had a discussion about how best to help you. You don‚Äôt have to deal with this debt alone, and maybe we can permanently help you out.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm listening.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ ethically flexible?‚Äù Hiro asked me.

‚ÄúHiro, no one cares about you being on the take.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not on the take, goddamnit. Colloquially, ‚Äòthe take‚Äô is when a cop takes bribes to act or look the other way. I do other shit.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs ‚Äòother shit‚Äô what you‚Äôre offering to pull me into?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù Rika said. ‚ÄúYou need to clear your debt, and you told me yourself that you wouldn‚Äôt mind having better equipment for your gigs. Maybe a new guitar? Speaking of which‚Äî‚Äù Rika pointed behind me, and my Eurodyne electric was laid up against the back of the couch.

I stood up, picked it up, and examined it. ‚ÄúA new guitar is the last thing I need‚Äîas in, I need a whole bunch of other shit more than I need a new guitar. I need a new amp, maybe a new mic, too.‚Äù

‚ÄúSee? We‚Äôre just trying to get some extra eddies in your pocket, and God knows you need ‚Äôem.‚Äù

I put my axe down and returned to the stool. ‚ÄúThis side-hustle, to be clear, doesn‚Äôt involve‚Äî‚Äù I held up my right hand and ticked off my fingers. ‚Äú‚Äîharvesting organs, assassination, kidnapping, or sign-holding? Especially not sign-holding, because I did that as an odd job once and it was the fucking worst. It was so boring. I‚Äôd almost rather harvest organs and go to hell than do sign-holding, for real.‚Äù

Hiroshi snorted at that.

‚ÄúJesus, Pan, no, we‚Äôre not doing any of that.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnymore,‚Äù Hiroshi taunted.

‚ÄúFuck off, you sexy, crooked motherfucker.‚Äù

**D100 Roll: Mission Type ‚Äì 89 (Steal Prototype)**

‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt mention theft among your hard limits, young-buck. Are you cool or not cool with it?‚Äù

‚ÄúDepends on what we‚Äôre snatching and from whom.‚Äù

‚ÄúExperimental medical technology, and we‚Äôre stealing it from Trauma Team.‚Äù

My heart was filled with immediate glee. The idea of paying off my debt by stealing from my debtor was goddamned diabolical. I remained cool about it, though.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs involved?‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing to it‚Äîrelatively low risk. Come into work tomorrow, and from there I‚Äôll take you to meet the Fixer, and they‚Äôll give you instructions. But once I tell the Fixer tomorrow morning that you‚Äôre in, that‚Äôs it. You‚Äôre in, and if you back out, you will never be able to get work from them again. You‚Äôll talk price with them, too, so don‚Äôt try to negotiate with me.‚Äù

I finished my coffee. ‚ÄúI get you, but also understand that if I‚Äôm not feeling it and I do back out, there‚Äôs no intent to embarrass you, Rika.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know, Pan. Business is business, and some of this side-hustle shit isn‚Äôt for everyone.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut you know I‚Äôm a crooked cop, so now I have to kill you,‚Äù Hiro said, and reached into the island‚Äôs top-right drawer like he was going for a gun. He didn‚Äôt withdraw a gun, but a bottle of authentic Jamaican rum. He set it on the countertop.

‚ÄúToo early for rum?‚Äù he asked us.

‚ÄúNever,‚Äù I shot back.

I only worked for Trauma Team four nights a week, so the rest of my time was spent either performing on the street, working on music, or looking for either another part-time job or day labor. It was hard for anyone to find temporary day labor, regardless of how shitty the work was. Lately, I‚Äôd only bothered going to the day labor office if the manager called me to work, which only happened twice a month at best. When I could, the world heavyweight champion of things to do during the day was to attend auditions; clubs were the best, followed by film-scoring gigs and subbing for local, established bands. I avoided band auditions‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt want to be part of a band unless it was mine.

**Complication: One of the potential clubs, Totentanz, a notable chrome metal club, has ‚ÄúRapcore‚Äù among its ‚ÄúWe Do Not Play‚Äù list of musical genres on its website. P@ndemik may never perform here.**

I slept on Rika‚Äôs living room couch for three hours, then caught a bus back to my cargo container in Megastructure Warren Flats, a region where my mother and father also lived. Rika had left me a medical kit with adhesive patch bandages and instructions for treating my wounds as they healed, so I took all of that with me back home. At 9 a.m., I did my usual scouring for auditions online. I didn‚Äôt find any open calls, and worse yet, Totentanz‚Äîa chrome metal spot where quite a few guitarists have been discovered‚Äîhad added ‚ÄúRap or Rapcore‚Äù to the list of musical acts they‚Äôd sworn to their patrons they wouldn‚Äôt play. Fuck them. They were willing to let fusion-metal guys perform there, but not rapcore.

With that lead dead, I kept up the work-search.

**Possibility: Unlikely**  
**Result: 10 (No)**

By the afternoon, I‚Äôd gone to all the job boards. There was nada that I was qualified for, and there were only a few jobs on each site anyway.

After a kibble lunch, I changed out my bandages, showered down at the communal following a twenty-minute wait, and returned to my container when I was done. I was too tired to street perform that day, as I was going to meet Rika‚Äôs Fixer in the evening, so I just caught a nap until 5:30 p.m.

**Risk: Low**  
**Payout: 500 Eddies, Performance-Based Bonus Possible**  
**D100 Location Oracle: 94 (Old Japantown)**

I reported to my usual Trauma Team Station on Shiro Ave. in Old Japantown. From the outside, the station was rundown and bullet-riddled because it had resisted two Boostergang raids within the past year and three the year before that. Lucky for the Old Japantown station, a.k.a. the Rutsubo, its ruined exterior disguised that within the station were current, state-of-the-art Aerodyne crafts, guns, and grenades supplied by everyone from Militech to the Night Market. And since the Rutsubo was staffed by the victorious defenders of those years of raids, the squads knew how to work those weapons, too.

When I got to my hangar with my guns, my replacement uniform, and a new vest on, Rika and the rest of the team were already there. Doc Fogerty‚Äôs brown hair was wild, and I think that was his intent‚Äîthere was a sex-symbol doctor on a long-running Trauma Team-based TV show called *Hot in the City,* and I think Doc Fogerty wanted to be him. The problem with that desire was that Doc Fogerty wasn‚Äôt good-looking like the doctor on that show‚Äînot even close‚Äîand the guy with the wild hair on that show was 25, while Doc Fogerty was 45.

Red-haired, mid-30s Rowan Reese leaned against the hull of the Aerodyne with a cigarette tucked between his right index and forefinger. He was a chain-smoker for sure, but with the money he made as a senior pilot for Trauma Team, he could just go and buy new lungs if he ever got cancer. Shit, he could‚Äôve probably just requisitioned a new pair of breathing bags.

Rika was pretty nonchalant, though. Everyone was quiet, and that wasn‚Äôt characteristic of this squad I‚Äôd been part of for the past fifteen months. I glanced at each member of my team individually, yet all of them stared at me with a certain amount of expectation.

Finally, I got the clue.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs you, isn‚Äôt it? You‚Äôre the Fixer.‚Äù

Major NPC Added: Doc Fogerty ‚Äì Role (Medtech/Fixer)

‚ÄúYou proved yourself last night; otherwise we wouldn‚Äôt be having this discussion. I still don‚Äôt like you, though,‚Äù Doc Fogerty said, his tone as neutral and blunt as ever.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like you, either.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood. That reinforces that this business arrangement stays purely business.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs it cool to talk here?‚Äù

‚ÄúSurveillance is lax in the hangars, heavy in the vehicles. The Aerodyne records everything, even when it‚Äôs powered down.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo I‚Äôve heard.‚Äù

Rowan held out a Trauma Team-issued agent to me.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been hacked,‚Äù Rowan said.

‚ÄúGo down to the vault, show that to Indira, and get her to pull the Biotechnica ZT-6 for you. She might take some convincing.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs my cut?‚Äù

‚Äú500 eddies, paid upon delivery. That‚Äôs the last question you‚Äôll ever get to ask any of us about anything you‚Äôre tasked with.‚Äù

I looked to Rika, but she was silent.

‚Äú600,‚Äù I said.

**Skill Check: Persuasion**  
**1d10 + 12 vs. 15 DV (Doc Fogerty expects Pan to haggle, and the trio is, in general, trying to mentor him)**  
**Result: 17 (Success)**

‚ÄúWhy should you get a 100-eddie raise?‚Äù Doc Fogerty asked me.

‚ÄúYou said Indira will take some convincing, and you know I got the gift of gab. I‚Äôm asking for what I‚Äôm worth.‚Äù

‚ÄúDeal. 600, and don‚Äôt push it.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, really, Pan. Don‚Äôt push it,‚Äù Rika said.

*NPC Note: Affinity with Rika grows; she is proud of him.*

I decided against asking for even more. I took the agent from Rowan and headed down a floor to the Supply Vault, which was covered by Indira Vas, a dark-haired, middle-aged, and overweight Indian woman behind a counter. She might not have been very dangerous, but the three turrets within the corridor leading to the vault were.

I smiled and approached Indira.

‚ÄúGood evenin‚Äô,‚Äù I said, and held out the Trauma Team agent.

‚ÄúGood evening, Pete,‚Äù Indira replied. ‚ÄúGlad to see you‚Äôre ready for work; I heard you had some trouble last night.‚Äù

‚ÄúAny night that we make it back home is a good one.‚Äù

Indira inspected the agent.

He could then make other requests of her. Imploding dice will cause Indira to report Pan, and he‚Äôll be immediately suspended from Trauma Team if he can‚Äôt beat a ‚Äúdesperation roll.‚Äù**

***Segment 1*****\*\*: Spotting Opportunities for Distraction (Human Perception)\*\***  
**As Indira inspected the agent, I checked out her outfit, her hair, and her manicure to see if I could use any of them as compliment-ammo.**

**Human Perception Check: 1d10 + 13 vs. 13 DV**  
**Result: 10 on d10**  
**Exploding Dice‚Ä¶**

I focused my gaze upon Indira‚Äôs lips, which were covered in fresh, ruby-red lipstick. I knew she would eventually feel that gaze upon her. When she did and looked up, I looked away and blushed.

‚ÄúIs everything alright, Pete?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ nothing.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you sure?‚Äù

I blushed again. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ ah. Your lipstick. I hope I‚Äôm not being too forward or anything, and don‚Äôt report me to H.R., but‚Ä¶ nah.‚Äù

Indira giggled. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be bashful. I thought you were a rockerboy‚Äîyou‚Äôre supposed to be all easy around women.‚Äù

‚ÄúYour lipstick is‚Ä¶ really sexy. Just something about it. There, I said it.‚Äù

Indira shook her head. ‚ÄúThanks, Pete.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know you‚Äôre married, but still.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre poly.‚Äù

‚ÄúDoes your hubs know that?‚Äù

Indira didn‚Äôt answer that; her lips just curved into a sly smile. She opened the notepad function on the agent, typed in some numbers, and passed the agent back to me. Her phone number was displayed on the screen.

‚ÄúLet me go and grab your item for you,‚Äù Indira said as she stepped away from the vault‚Äôs service window. Next to the window was a 10x10 delivery chute that only she could remotely unlock. I heard a thunk in the chute, then Indira returned to the window. The chute‚Äôs lock clicked, and I opened it. Within the chute was a sealed white container with the words ‚ÄúConfidential,‚Äù ‚ÄúZT-6,‚Äù and ‚ÄúProperty of Biotechnica.‚Äù I tucked the agent into my back pocket and winked at Indira.

‚ÄúThanks, baby,‚Äù I said, and she blew me a slow, genuine, sweet-natured kiss.

I returned to the hangar with the ZT-6 container tucked under my right arm. Doc Fogerty and Rowan appeared surprised that I‚Äôd come back so fast, but Rika simply nodded as I passed the container to Doc Fogerty.

‚ÄúNo issues?‚Äù Doc Fogerty asked me.

‚ÄúTold you I was worth the raise. She might even do us a few more favors in the future.‚Äù

Rowan immediately handed me six folded hundred-euronotes. ‚ÄúA star is born.‚Äù

I was a little curious about what the prototype was for, but Doc Fogerty had said it, and it wasn‚Äôt my first time hearing it: No Questions.

I was pretty sure that, before I maybe-actualized my dreams of musical prominence, I was going to hear that phrase again.

**##Day 1 Gig: Trauma Team Patrol##**

We entered our Aerodyne, and Rika threw on her custom Kevlar vest, which bore the logo of Squad Zero-H-Nine-Four, ‚ÄúThe Trick-or-Treat‚Äù: an orange Halloween pumpkin bearing a grin with a bullet caught between its ‚Äúteeth.‚Äù Though small, our squad had a long history, dating back to the 2020s, and had the highest rescue count of any Rutsubo squad in the aftermath of the nuke that went off two decades ago. Rika took the legacy of The Trick-or-Treat seriously, and even Doc Fogerty wore a Trick-or-Treat turtleneck beneath his white lab coat. Rika wouldn‚Äôt tell me how our squad got the name ‚ÄúTrick-or-Treat‚Äù yet, as I was only part-time‚Äîand part-timers could be replaced at any time, for nearly any reason. However, at fifteen months, I‚Äôd lasted way longer than any other part-timer in years.

Rowan launched our vehicle, and when we reached two hundred feet in altitude, we pushed off into the Night City evening.

**D100 Closed Question Oracle: Does the Trick-or-Treat Squad see any action tonight?**

**Combat Type: Quick and Dirty**

A mere four minutes after we reached patrol altitude, the lights within the crew bay flashed red and the alarm blared. Rowan flipped the alarm off as soon as we got it, but flipped the siren lights on. Thirty seconds later, his voice came over the crew bay‚Äôs intercom while I was already giving my Midnight Arms revolver one last chamber-check:

‚ÄúClient designated ‚ÄòExecutive Client‚Äô‚ÄîI repeat, Executive Client‚ÄîTrace, Kevin. Address 3049 Yubei Blvd. in Japantown. Trace Electronics. Client has one confirmed bullet wound to the right leg. Stand by for local data feed.‚Äù

Rika and I checked our Trauma Team agents, and the Aerodyne‚Äôs AI took control of them. A map of the response zone was displayed: a satellite-precise image of a dirty Old Japantown street, though Trace Electronics had two floors and appeared kind of upscale.

Two men and two women, all of them wearing crude clown facepaint, were opening fire on the store.

‚ÄúFucking Bozos,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúDead or alive?‚Äù

‚ÄúBody ‚Äôem,‚Äù was Rika‚Äôs immediate reply, and she handed my standard-issue Trauma Team helmet to me. She then donned her own custom black helmet, which had jagged teeth drawn on it like a jack-o‚Äô-lantern‚Äôs. I secured my helmet and drew my Kang-Tao shotgun. Rika had her modified ModFire 10x lowered to her right side.

The Aerodyne set down 30 meters south of the pickup zone. Stealth wasn‚Äôt an option, as there was no doubt the four Bozos had seen us flying overhead.

**Battle Result: Trick-or-Treat Squad barely defeats the Bozos.**

The gunfire on the store stopped, which meant the clowns had already turned their guns in our direction and wanted to wait until first sight of us to open fire. Unfortunately for them, Rika‚Äôs ModFire had laser sighting and a scope. She had the first of them dead to rights from fifteen meters.

‚ÄúTrick or treat,‚Äù she shouted, and then let a single round fly from her small assault rifle. It pierced the head of one of the two Bozo girls and put her down instantly. Rika fired again, and one of the two male Bozos went down from a bullet to the center of his neck.

The second Bozo girl raised her pistol, but Rika put her down with a precise shot to the heart, and she finished off the final Bozo with two shots to the head.

Six seconds‚Äîthat‚Äôs how long the fight lasted. That‚Äôs how fuckin‚Äô beast Rika was, and she knew it. She took cover behind the exterior of a building, and I took cover next to her. She peeked inside and scanned the area; her helmet had advanced thermal imaging.

‚ÄúOne alive and inside,‚Äù Rika said. ‚ÄúAll hostiles down.‚Äù

Rika motored to the electronics store, and I followed. She pressed herself against the side of the front door for cover, opened it, and peeked inside.

‚ÄúClear. Trauma Team!‚Äù

‚ÄúTrauma Team?‚Äù shouted a man from the locked manager‚Äôs office behind the service counter.

‚ÄúTrauma Team!‚Äù

‚ÄúBack here!‚Äù

The door‚Äôs lock clicked, and Rika opened it. A 5‚Äô7‚Äù, thin-bearded, overweight, middle-aged white man with a cyber-arm was on the floor with a handgun wound in his belly. He cradled the wound with his right hand.

‚ÄúFuck‚Ä¶ oh fuck‚Äî‚Äù the man breathed hard, and his shirt was soaked with blood and sweat. Rika unclipped one of her Madrilex‚Äîa pharmaceutical made to stop people from going into shock, which this man was. She handed the orange syringe to me and I uncorked it, but I couldn‚Äôt administer the treatment without her permission.

The man‚Äôs agent lay next to his right hand, with his Trauma Team Executive Plan ID displayed. Rika picked it up, confirmed it with a once-over, and then nodded to me. I injected the Madrilex syringe into his right lung and held his shoulder to balance him while I did. I took a step back and observed him; in overweight people with elevated potassium, Madrilex could cause a stroke. I exhaled in relief when, after fifteen seconds, that didn‚Äôt happen to him.

Rika further inspected the man‚Äôs agent. ‚ÄúYour information says ‚ÄòNo Cryopumps.‚Äô Is that still the case, Mr. Trace?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, ma‚Äôam. Fuckin‚Äô things terrify me.‚Äù

I laid my shotgun down, then unslung my gray equipment backpack. I set it on the floor and removed my advanced care kit, filled with wound-cleaning tools, adhesive bandages, and even a Speedheal syringe.

‚ÄúLet me move your hand, sir,‚Äù I said, and then I pulled his bloody hand away from his belly.

**Stabilization: A First-Aid Check**  
**DV = 13 (Seriously Wounded)**  
**Result: 1d10 (6) + First Aid (13) = 19**  
**Pan succeeds in stabilizing the client.**

Within four minutes, I‚Äôd cleaned the gutshot and stopped the bleeding with hemostatic bandages. Seconds after the stabilization, Doc Fogerty hurried through the door with a stretcher. Rika and I helped the man up, placed him on the stretcher, and the Aerodyne had landed right outside the building. We loaded Kevin Trace into the Aerodyne‚Äôs medbay, and Doc Fogerty banged on the right side of the hatch‚Äôs wall twice. The Aerodyne took off and reached its emergency flight altitude within twenty-five seconds. Doc Fogerty was already in the medbay with Mr. Trace on the operating table, ready to begin life-saving surgery.

‚ÄúSix minutes and forty seconds,‚Äù Rowan reported into the medbay, where Doc Fogerty, Rika, and I were located. The time report was extremely important, as anything over eight minutes was cause for a write-up in the Rutsubo.

Rika removed her helmet. ‚ÄúGood stuff.‚Äù

‚ÄúFuckin‚Äô A, queen,‚Äù I replied.

**##Mission 02 Complete##**  
**IP Awarded: 15**  
**New Trauma Team Debt: 1700**

Rika and I stood around in the crew bay during the brief ride to St. Teresa Hospital.

I gripped a safety rail above my head. ‚ÄúWhat do you think the situation with this client was? The Bozos didn‚Äôt even get into the store.‚Äù

Rika‚Äôs lips scrunched into an expression of annoyance. ‚ÄúLikely story: the Bozos just felt like shooting at someone‚Äôs store. The client was present and caught a piece of something. That‚Äôs how it is with those painted-up gonk fuckboys.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt reply, as that indeed seemed the likely story. The Bozos had been a problem around Old Japantown that had only worsened within my fifteen months on Trauma Team, and, as it was in the Combat Zones, the cops weren‚Äôt doing jack shit about them.

‚ÄúHiro didn‚Äôt mention it until after you left this morning,‚Äù Rika said, ‚Äúbut he said that last night, you two had a run-in with some Nomads.‚Äù

‚ÄúBlood Nation. They offered me a gig that was probably just bullshit talk.‚Äù

Rika‚Äôs eyes widened as she peered at me. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been invited to a Blood Nation gig and you‚Äôre thinking it‚Äôs trash? Young-buck, what do you know about the Blood Nation?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot much. Nomads, and they have some pretty good road-soul bands that play around the city.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know shit, then. No offense.‚Äù

‚ÄúQueen, you‚Äôre rude so often, I‚Äôm desensitized to it.‚Äù

‚ÄúRight? Anyway, they‚Äôre pretty juiced in with the entire Night City entertainment scene. Not just the clubs, but the theatres, the troupes, movies, and the music industry. If this gig invite wasn‚Äôt bullshit, this could be quite an opportunity for you.‚Äù

‚ÄúAs in‚Ä¶ getting discovered?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what people come to Night City for, ain‚Äôt it?‚Äù

‚ÄúI always thought of it as a place where rich assholes come to get shot so they can go home, lie about how it happened, and look like badasses.‚Äù

‚ÄúGoddamnit, young-buck. This is serious talk. The life expectancy of a part-time Trauma Teamer is two months, and the average time it takes for a part-time Trauma Teamer to make it to full time is six years, if ever. Do you really want to risk your life with this shit for much longer‚Äîwith your talent?‚Äù

‚ÄúTrauma Team‚Äôs been good to you.‚Äù

‚ÄúAs you, Hiro, and Doc love to remind me, I started ahead of everyone else, and Hiro helped me out, too.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat am I supposed to be doing that I‚Äôm not already doing?‚Äù

‚ÄúIf your Blood Nation guy confirms the gig, don‚Äôt report for any shifts here until after the gig. You need time to prepare. We‚Äôll get a substitute.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre sure it‚Äôs cool?‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no way we‚Äôre replacing you after what you did for us tonight. You‚Äôre good, Pan.‚Äù

I nodded.

‚ÄúTo that end, we might be able to help each other out yet again. How do you feel about taking on a drummer?‚Äù

‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt be able to pay them anything but fuckin‚Äô peanuts.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Äôll work for that‚Äî‚Äù Rika pulled her personal agent from an inner pocket of her Kevlar vest. Her fingers glided across the screen.

**D100 Nonbinary Names Roll: 91 (Summer)**  
**D100 Handle Roll: 11 (Any Feature of Nature‚ÄîRain)**  
**D10 Role Roll: Nomad**

Rika pulled up the social media profile for a pretty attractive white girl, apparently around my age, with a shock-red pixie cut and dressed in an old black motorcycle riding suit. Her name was Summer Rain, and her profile pictures had her at motorcycle meets and playing the drums at live shows, looking intense as she did so.

‚ÄúThat is obviously a Nomad, and I don‚Äôt play with Nomads.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat? Why? You racist against them or something?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, they don‚Äôt act right. They get shitfaced during the set no matter how short it is, or they start fights with the club staff. Every. Goddamn. Time.‚Äù

Rika shrugged, because even she knew it was true. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs‚Ä¶ what she‚Äôs in jail for right now. Hiro‚Äôs talked to some people and he wants to release her, but someone needs to keep her on her best behavior.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs in it for him?‚Äù

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs an informant for him.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh. Which lockup is she in?‚Äù

‚ÄúCorpo Central.‚Äù

‚ÄúDamn, she must‚Äôve stepped on some big toes. I‚Äôll get her in the morning.‚Äù

After we delivered Mr. Kevin Trace to the hospital, the rest of the shift was uneventful. At 6 a.m. we returned to the Rutsubo, and I caught a bus back to my cargo container. At exactly 7 a.m., I sent a text to Punish.

*it‚Äôs* [*P@ndemik*](mailto:P@ndemik)*. Were you and yours being real about weekend gig?*

Ten minutes later, I got a reply.

*blood nation always real. gig is saturday, be here at 5 to set up early*

Punish sent me a map pin. The gig location was at a place that, as a child of Night City, I‚Äôd been told to never, ever‚Äînever-ever‚Äîgo to:

1nyaevc,https://www.reddit.com/r/saudiarabia/comments/1nyaevc/traumatized_by_my_saudi_guest/,Traumatized by my Saudi guest,"Hello, I'm from the US and many years ago I befriended a few female classmates at this institute where we studied. I hadn't kept in touch with them, but a couple of them reached out to me in the same week (by coincidence) and wanted to visit me. Just for context, of them is Saudi and the other is Syrian. I'm very familiar with the local culture and I speak decent Arabic, more than enough to get by. This was the most APPALLING guest I've ever had in my life, and I host many guests quite often. It's a very long story, but I'd like to know (realistically) what everyone would have done or how you would've handled this nightmare.

Last week my Saudi friend texted me saying she wanted to come over on a Friday morning and we agreed that, since my husband and I were both extremely busy with work and our degree programs, she could stay till 4 pm, and our Syrian friend was scheduled to come over at 7 pm. Then I asked her whether she preferred tacos or salmon for lunch, and she began making crazy demands from me. She said what else is on the menu, because her son is coming with her so I should make something he can eat. I found that quite rude already, since not only was I going out of my way to give her options, but I would never even think to burden my host with cooking or make special demands for my kids. I said I think most kids would like tacos, so she agreed to that.

She then said, immediately after, ""you didn't ask me what I want for dessert :)""...Excuse me? I am just speechless at this point. I was trying to be a courteous host as I always was (she had visited me twice before I moved cities), so again I gave her options. I said I can make some cake or pie? She said ""what about a caramel cheesecake :)"". Again, I'm shocked. She knows that I'm drowning in assignments and work on Sunday and I have deadlines, but she isn't ashamed to make demands on top of what I'm already offering her? It gets worse. I said I just made cheesecake the other week, but I'll make a cheesecake for her again. She then says, ""Oh and what about a really chocolaty dessert, something really indulgent""...Really?? I said to myself this is getting obnoxious, but thankfully I had some brownies I had recently made and suggested that. She said ""no not brownies, maybe a nice chocolate cake with chocolate frosting and a strawberry on top :) if that's not too much to ask"". I know many Saudis and even in their culture this is quite rude, but things just kept getting worse and worse.

I had worked so hard that evening cooking and baking for the next day. She arrived in the morning and she had walked past the shoe closet and straight on to my brand new white carpets with her dirty sneakers on. I honestly never saw any adult do this at any house I've been to, regardless of their background. I kindly asked her to remove her shoes and she did. Her son walks in with his smartphone and never takes his eyes off the screen the entire time. He just lies on my couch and continues to watch videos on his phone, and she says nothing about it. I tell my son to play with him, or offer some video games, and he even had some neighbors over to keep him company, but she lets him stayed glued to his screen and even makes excuses for him while everyone else is playing around him.

We talk for a few minutes and she tells me ""By the way, I spoke to [our Syrian friend] and I told her I could stay at your house longer until she arrives"". ???? I am not afraid of confronting at this point because she has crossed the line. She made plans with our friend without consulting me, and decided she could stay in my house for a few hours longer when we had agreed she would leave at 4. I was so appalled by her behavior that I couldn't believe my ears. I told her that we need to stick to the plan because she has no clue what I have going on after 4 pm and she can't simply change plans without consulting me!! The entire time, she kept talking over me and deflecting blame and refusing to acknowledge her mistakes ""I didn't know you wanted me to tell you"" ""I just made those plans today"" ""I told her I could stay longer at your place so we could leave together"". What the actual heck?? I told her my husband was coming home to work as he mentioned before, and instead of calling her driver to come pick her up, she said ""what about you take me out for a drive? Since you have a new car masha Allah."" My jaw is on the floor at her audacity. I said my husband will be here for a couple hours and he needs to work, have you spoken to your driver? She said ""he's in another city now and won't come now because I told him to pick me up later at night"". Of course, she had planned this with our friend and even her driver ahead of time, but she didn't want to tell me until she was in my house and her driver was back in her city. I was left with no other option, I obviously can't kick her out even though I had every right to based on her outrageous behavior. She even suggested I drive to her the city center 35 minutes away from our house!! I said that's too far, we'll stay close by. Her son gets his shoes on, and just like his mother, walks all over my new carpets with his sneakers on. I remind her that he's wearing shoes on the carpets, and she actually shoots it down with ""it's ok he just put them on now"". (I'm actually kicking myself right now for not putting my foot down and scolding them, because WHYYY was I being so nice??)

So we get into the car, and the seat belt sign is beeping. I told her that her son needs to buckle up, and he CLEARLY has never put on a seat belt before, nor has she ever told him to. First he couldn't find it, then he didn't know how to pull it, and then I watched him struggle to figure out where the buckle was and how to fasten it. I just stared in blank space for a good 40 seconds until the beeping stopped. She said ""wow you're driving you're so 'kashkha'"" and these kinds of fake compliments rub me the wrong way because I realize she's using me and I am not equipped to handle such horrifically classless guests. We went to this plaza where I took her to shops and shortly after, my Syrian friend had arrived in town early on her husband's accord. At this point I didn't mind she was early, I was GLAD I could just return home and get this woman off my back. I called my husband to leave because we'd have two guests now.

On the way there, this Saudi woman has the gall to tell me ""what are you planning on feeding her? If you're making dinner then maybe you can fix me something too"". I am busy trying to focus on driving while a hundred people jaywalk and cars merge with no signal, and she's already interrogating me on what I'm going to make, if I'm going to serve her tacos or do I have something else I'm making for her, what other food do I have, do I have salmon at home...I am literally getting enraged as I type this and I hate that I even stayed so patient with her. I won't even get into the chaos she caused with our Syrian friend over the phone while I was driving home. We finally arrive and as I sit down with our Syrian friend, I offer her some coffee and the Saudi woman begins demanding what kind of coffee she wants and the flavors, and she probably mentions dinner like 2-3 times while we're sat talking.

Her driver arrives and it's around 8:30 or 9 pm, and while she's had two ""five star restaurant quality"" meals (as she described them), 2 coffee and matcha lattes, 2 cheesecake slices and 3 chocolate strawberry cupcakes, I haven't eaten a single meal in the entire day because she kept killing my appetite over her obnoxious behavior and unbelievable entitlement, audacity, lack of consideration, brash communication, and constantly enabling her son to eat wherever he pleased and leave crumbs all over my floors and carpets and half-eaten food and dessert at random places in my house. My Syrian friend and I had very similar views on ipad kids and we discussed it casually while she was present, and we realized as we spoke that her son was glued to the tv and smartphone for over 10 hours nonstop, literally going between one and the other, and she neglects and even justifies the situation. She might not have even gotten the message from our conversations with her about the children's education, the issue with devices, the lack of physical activities and so on. When she left I was just processing how TRAUMATIC this experience was, and I couldn't even put to words how I felt.

Needless to say, I will never speak to nor invite this woman again, she's no longer my friend as far as I'm concerned. A lot of what she did actually reminded me of how a British friend of mine was treated by her wealthy bedoiun neighbors who used and abused her for favors and gifts, and we just weren't used to this kind of behavior to know how to react to it. Is there a word for this type of person? Is this a feature that is shared within society that so many women (not sure about men) possess? I know for sure it's happened to my western friends but do they also behave this way with their fellow Saudi friends? How would you handle this kind of person?

I was our family‚Äôs breadwinner, but my condition has left me unable to work. Now, I‚Äôve become a financial burden, and my illness has pushed us into deep debt. We‚Äôre struggling to afford even our basic needs. PLEASE HELP!!! üôè‚ù§Ô∏è","
Hi, my name is Rocheal I live in Oregon City, Oregon in the USA. I just got out of the hospital. yet again. 

Over the past two years, I‚Äôve been intubated 8 times. I've been in the hospital, every single month, if not twice a month, generally staying at least 3 days to a week or more, each time. 

All due to extreme swelling in my stomach, tongue, and throat. This swelling cuts off my airway which can cause asphyxiation instantly and death. Doctors initially believed, I was having severe allergic reactions, but none of the normal treatments for allergic reactions (Epi, Steroids, or Benadryl) had any effect.

After lots of gaslighting, from the doctors, and me constantly nagging for them to run more test. I was FINALLY diagnosed this year with a very rare, life-threatening genetic disease called HAE Type 3 which is the rarest form of this condition (Hereditary Angioedema with normal C1 estrase) this is a fairly new disease and thus far there are no medications specifically made to treat it.

The only life saving Medication available currently is Takhzyro (technically made to treat type 1 & 2) But has showed some success in helping about 30% of HAE type 3 sufferers. This medication costs OVER $20,000 per dose, and up to over $400,000 per dose and I need it every 2 weeks. Which is over $500k-$6 million dollars a year. BEYOND Crazy I know!. But they cant garentee it will work until I try it.

My insurance (Medicaid) has denied to pay this multiple times and rejected all appeals. Their reasoning is because its not 100% garenteed to work. They are requiring, I pay out of pocket, a 3 months supply. *6 doses* Once that's done, and I prove I have bought it, used it for the full 3 months, and show it actually worked by keeping me out of the hospital. Then and only then will they likely approve it, but it's still not garenteed.

Last November, I underwent brain surgery to remove a brain tumor on my motor cortex, which ended up being a meginonma. 

We tried to use a cheaper, medicine (For my HAE) Transmatic Acid and birth control which caused me to have, a submassive pulmonary embolism 

On top of that, I just found out at the start of September I am currently in right heart failure and my heart hasn't really been healing like they hoped since the clots were removed.

Unfortunately, with all of these serious health conditions. I am no longer allowed to work or drive. I went from the breadwinner proudly supporting my family. To being the one who has financially drained them and now we are drowning in debt.

It has gotten so bad weve had to sell our Livingroom furniture, our living room tv and bedroom tv, my coffee and end tables, our dining rooom set, my husband has sold his grill, most of his tools, our kids gaming systems, sport equipment, and my husband also donates plasma every chance he gets, I tried myself to donate but with my health Issues and all the medications they wont let me.

My husband is our only income source and provider, but he often misses a ton of work, at least 1-2 weeks a month. He has to be there during my hospitalizations, because when im intubated I cant make any of my own medical desisions so he's needing to be there at all times to be my voice. Opon my release He then has to be my care taker until I am strong enough to be left alone, but because of all the time he misses from work, we've fallen deep into debt.

We‚Äôre facing the threat of homelessness. We are struggling to afford basic needs like rent, food, utilities, and essentials for us and our two kids. I‚Äôve been denied by disability multiple times and I am currently appealing my last denial, but in the meantime, we need urgent help

We would be very grateful if anyone could help with anything...If we could get a few bills paid since a lot have shut off notices or late fees and our landlord is threatening to evict us if we are late again...

I'd also really love to be able to pay for my medication for 3 months in hopes that it works to prove to the insurance company that It will help me if they approve it and get me through the insurance denials and appeal processes. (But with the price it's going to take a miracle)

The remainder would go to other monthly expenses such as gas for my husband to get back and forth to the hospital, and work, food, and other household, nessesities food is one of the highest priorities (we do utilize all our local food box options but many fall on dates or times my husband is at work or he's stuck at the hospital with me and cant leave) 

I want to thank anyone who took the time out of their busy day and  lives to read my post...(sorry it is so long) I want to thank anyone who is thinking of donating, and I want to thank anyone who actually donates even if it's a dollar it really means a lot to me and my family during this time... I also want to thank anyone who doesn't have the ability to donate but hits the upvote button, shares, and or takes the time to actually comment on this post because every bit helps and those small actions will help me get this post viewed...

again from the bottom of my heart Thank you... you all are appreciated and every little bit helps! Even if you don't think it does trust me it does... Have a great day!

I am here to see if anyone else has a similar sensation years after curing A-fib. For some background, I had my first ablation July 2019 and was devastated when I went into one of my worst episodes as I was on my way home from the hospital. I was told it could happen but it lasted almost 14 hours and that was when I knew it didn‚Äôt work, and it actually made it worse! I was so depressed. Fast forward to February 2020, found an incredible surgeon in LA who gave me her absolute confidence she could fix me this time, and she delivered. My main triggers were alcohol, specifically bubbles but also over indulging on sugars. I could also go into Afib if I looked down at my phone for too long, thinking mine was related to something in my neck, vagus nerve maybe, but no doctor ever gave that much consideration. 

As stated above, I have never had another episode since my 2nd ablation (üôå) and I have drank plenty of alcohol, coffee and even tested the limits with other stimulants and have been fine. What I am occasionally experiencing (usually after coffee and/or wine multiple consecutive days in a row) is what I would describe as a slight ache in what I would imagine is the valve openings where the ablation was. As I understand it, the ablation cauterized the opening of the valves to the heart to create scar tissue effectively stopping the random electric pulses that triggered my Afib. I am curious if anyone else years after healing have this sensation? I wonder if it‚Äôs a feeling of pulses in that scar tissue, because they are brief and no Afib occurs. Nothing I would consider painful but definitely noticeable after drinking coffee every morning and having a few glasses of wine each night for consecutive days. They only last a moment or two.

1nya1ze,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nya1ze,Synchronika II Plumbing Guide,"I have plumed my Synchronika II coffee machine recently and while it's still fresh in my mind I decided to put together a quick guide. It's based on my personal experience and since I'm based in New Zealand I had limited choices for the filters and it was harder to source the right parts (there's a spreadsheet below which might be useful for someone).

There were two main goals I wanted to achieve with this:

1. Convenience (no need to use the water tank and empty the drip tray)
2. Minimize or avoid limescale to prolong the life of the machine

I settled in a filter / softener as it's most economical option. Plus the water in my area is on the softer side I didn't need any more sophisticated options.

Here's the breakdown of the process:

1. Choosing the right water filter / softener
2. Plumbing in water
3. Plumbing out to a waste drain

**Choosing the right water filter / softener**

I already have a two-stage filtration system (sediment filter and carbon cartridge) installed for the hole house so I only needed to address water hardness to prevent limescale buildup in the coffee machine. The two key factors that contribute to limescale formation are general/permanent hardness (GH) and temporary/alkaline hardness (KH). There's a useful table on page 4 (section E) in¬†[the Jim Schulman's Water FAQ](http://users.rcn.com/erics/Water%20Quality/Water%20FAQ.pdf)¬†that lists maximum hardness levels by temperature. To establish the baseline, I tested my water using the API GH & KH test kit typically used for aquariums. I was specifically looking for a conventional cation exchange softener rather than a decarbonizer, as I wanted to keep the pH and alkalinity of the water the same and focus only on reducing GH. I ultimately chose the Brita system with the C150 Finest filter. I also considered Everpure, but since it's a North American system, getting appropriate adapters would have been more complicated. Additionally, the only Everpure filters available in New Zealand were decarbonizers and the filter head does not support water bypass, when Brita does.

**Plumbing it water**

The coffee machine is located in my pantry next to the sink, so the piping was already in place. All I needed was a tee fitting and a ball valve for the coffee machine line. ECM recommends feeding 2 bars of pressure into the machine to reduce stress on internal components, so I also had to get a pressure reducing valve. I also needed flexi hoses, nipples, adapters, and tape for connections without washers. I opted for Loctite 55 thread sealant instead of Teflon tape as it‚Äôs easier to use and allows for 45 degree adjustment after installation. I also purchased a hole saw to drill two necessary openings. The whole process took around a couple of hours, but couldn't been done way quicker by someone more experienced. After doing a couple of rounds of GH testing I settled on 30% bypass.

**Plumbing out to a waste drain**

For drainage, I replaced the S-trap under the sink with the one that includes a dishwasher spout, so I could to tap into it. I used a 16mm clear vinyl tube, a 15mm to 20mm adapter and hose clamps to connect everything together. To prevent air from getting trapped in the system, I added a tee to create a vent for the drain line which sits behind the machine. The drainage took me similar time, mainly due to cutting the tubes more until I removed the sag from the lines.

Hopefully this guide will be useful for someone, here's the full list of parts I used for the installation:

 I will preface with this- I have never done an all inclusive stay before, outside of cruises, but I have travelled to several places and done my own thing. 

Delta lost our check bag. They short checked it and left it in ATL. Thank god for AirTags. I recommend putting one in your check bags. They were able to get it to us on day 2 but it changed our plans. Customs was fairly easy and quick. Instructions from the resort were clear on transportation to and from the resort. It did take longer than expected for our driver to pick us up and take us to the resort. About an hour wait for a driver and about a 50 minute drive to the resort. We did the Excellence Club so check in and being shown to our room was a breeze. Make sure you download the app so you can check which restaurants are open and their hours. Lots of other info in the app as well. We couldn‚Äôt link our room to the app until about an hour after check in. We stayed in the  Excellence Club Beachfront Honeymoon Two-Story Rooftop Terrace Suite with Plunge Pool, building 9. The room was nice. Air worked well. Roof pool was used a lot by us. The bed wasn‚Äôt comfortable to my standard but my wife said she was fine with it (I have a bad back from years of sports). Water pressures and temps were fine as well. No complaints really for the room. There is plenty to do on the property and the resort offers paid excursions as an option. Don‚Äôt worry, anytime you go in the main lobby, you‚Äôll be hounded about the excursions. Oh and same on the beach. There are people constantly walking up and down trying to sell you junk and make you pay to take pictures with Iguanas and Parrots. Just tell them no. If you hold the animals, they‚Äôre going to demand money from you. It‚Äôs quite annoying trying to relax and being bothered every 15 minutes to buy some useless items. I respect the hustle though. If you want privacy and peace, skip the beach and stay near one of the private pools. The bar tenders and beach tenders are super friendly and helpful. All of the employees were kind and pleasant to speak with and work with. We made a point to always tip a couple dollars so bring plenty of $1s. Housekeeping was subpar. I had to call 3 times in 4 days for more water, coffee, towels, and ask for the room to be swept. Also they give no fu*** about the Do Not Disturb sign on the door, they‚Äôre going to come in either way. Not once, not twice, 3 times someone entered our room with a Do Not Disturb sign on the door. The third time I just stood there naked and told them to leave and don‚Äôt come back. The doors ‚Äúlock‚Äù but if they present the key card from the outside, it unlocks so you couldn‚Äôt keep them out if you wanted to. Moving on to the food. My wife and I are in very good shape. We meal prep 90% of our food and eat a very clean diet. You won‚Äôt find that here. The food was just okay. Some things not even worth eating. You‚Äôll notice a lot of the same things are just prepared different at other restaurants. Anything with ‚Äúcrab‚Äù is the exact same gross paste they use for all the crab dishes. Same for breads, pastries, lamb, steak, etc. Not much originality. My stomach was unsettled after our very first meal and stayed that way the entire trip. We did take pre and probiotics for a month prior to the trip and during our stay. We both ended up with diarrhea on our last 2 days/nights and that lasted until 2 days after we got home. Honestly I am glad we brought a couple boxes of protein bars because by day 3, I couldn‚Äôt stomach any more of the food. Drinks- I have been sober for 2 years prior to this trip. Just a personal choice. Decided to enjoy a few beverages here. The bartenders were excellent. Drinks were made quickly and happily. We tipped well ($2-3 per drink) and that seemed to make you popular!! Room service is just awful. Sometimes very simple orders (mango smoothy and toast) took over an hour and would arrive wrong (sent us strawberry yogurt in a glass and bread). It says room service will be delivered in 30 minutes or less, not happening. Maybe 45-60 minutes. And the resort was not busy. Actually it was quite dead. The night entertainment was alright. We left a couple of the night time events early as it wasn‚Äôt good enough to want to keep me there fighting mosquitoes. We attended the morning beach stretch class and the afternoon yoga one day. It‚Äôs the same instructor and the same thing. It is not Yoga, it‚Äôs a stretching class and not a good one (again we are both very fit and my wife is a trainer). The hydro therapy session that came with our reservation was fine. It‚Äôs essentially a bunch of different water activities like cold dunk, ice bath, steam sauna, pool jet massagers, etc. Not worth paying for but can‚Äôt complain here because it was free. If you want a real massage, go down the beach to Tropical Treasure and get one there. We both did a 60 minute relaxation massage and it was incredible and cheap. It was $70USD and we tipped $20 to each masseuse. They also sell souvenirs for much cheaper than the resort.  Overall I give the whole trip a 4/10. I would not go back.

He told me he loved me. He told me we had a connection like no one else he‚Äôs never been married but said he would marry me.

I wasn‚Äôt interested in a committed relationship as I was recently divorced and not ready. I have two small children. 

Everything was fine our last night together was beautiful he was kissing me all night . Then I never heard from him again for a month. I reached out to check in on him after a month and he agreed to let me bring him a coffee. He wasn‚Äôt affectionate he didn‚Äôt say he missed me nothing and he definitely didn‚Äôt explain why he disappeared. He mentioned something about needing space . Mind you we only saw eachother about once a week and talked occasionally (not very threatening if you ask me) . 

After the day we had coffee I asked if we could still be friends and told him not to be a stranger he agreed. Three more weeks went by and finally he texted me a very plain check in as a friend would about how it‚Äôs been going for me. 

After that I continue to cease to engage this past Monday he texted ‚Äúhow‚Äôs your Monday going‚Äù and I never responded.

I‚Äôd appreciate any insight. I‚Äôm more depressed than I‚Äôve ever been questioning what‚Äôs wrong me me what did I do? Nothing bad happened. I can‚Äôt get out of bed have been sleeping all day calling out of work and I can‚Äôt think of anything else but him. The pain hurts so much please help üò¢",2,1759623692.0,ghosting,1,1.0,False

Someone fun but serious about a relationship who would love to do cosplay with me.

About me:
Writer (Honors Creative Writing Major going for MFA) and artist, nerdy and athletic. Catholic. I like RPGs, anime, cooking pasta, gym and long walks, bookstores and park dates. My books and manga are in the last picture! I am big into Japanese culture, language, and tradition. I plan dates, keep promises, and do my best to represent the good man I am. Sometimes I do tease, so be warned. Big into RPGS and things like Final Fantasy and Baldur's Gate and DnD.

Values:
Loyalty, family, patience, equality, and playfulness. I date to marry and am monogamous. We can discuss boundaries early. I‚Äôm saving myself and want someone who‚Äôs waiting too. If you're someone who takes relationships seriously and laugh easily, we'll probably get along.

Looking for:
A kind, good-natured, and nerdy woman who wants to build something lasting. We would have long conversations, inside jokes, ramen and anime nights. Maybe couples cosplay one day!

Appearance:
I stay fit and work best with someone similarly health-minded (slim to athletic). A woman withAa cute, attractive face and beautiful eyes are my weakness. High standards but I'll make sure you're appreciated for being yourself, not just physicialities. I appreciate beauty, but I value the person.

Details:
Age 20‚Äì30. I‚Äôm in Indiana (EST). U.S only or Japan works if we‚Äôre working toward a long-term goal.
DM with pic/age/location (or link your post). A good first date would be a video call! Or a bookstore/coffee shop in person. I mainly use discord.

We‚Äôre both in college btw!

We‚Äôve seen each other at a few parties, and every time she comes up to me she‚Äôs super flirty ‚Äî like touching my arm, rubbing my shoulders, stuff like that. One time I told her she was so pretty and she called me gorgeous back. When we started texting she was calling me pet names like my love, baby, honey, love, all that. Not gonna lie, every time she said something like that my heart was beating fast lol.

I texted her first back on Sept 8, and at first things were fun and flirty but then the convo kinda faded out and she just hearted my last message. I didn‚Äôt text again after that. Then like 2 and a half weeks later (around my birthday), she slid up on my story and said ‚Äúomgg happy birthday baby.‚Äù I told her ‚Äúthank youu ü•π I‚Äôve been meaning to text you‚Äù and she was sweet about it.

We started talking again and I asked if she wanted to watch a movie together. She said yeah, so we planned for her to come over (I have my own dorm and she has a roommate). She seemed cool with it, but then later said she might not be able to because she had a lot of work ‚Äî like 2 essays and readings due before Sunday. I told her it was okay, and that I understood.

A few days later I was in the library eating breakfast and she randomly came up to me, said hi, and dropped her bag down. She went to get coffee, then came back and sat with me. We ended up talking for like 30 minutes before class. It was nice ‚Äî chill and not awkward like I thought it‚Äôd be. ( most of our interactions before were at parties intoxicated)

Later that day she texted me saying she‚Äôd let me know by the end of the day if she could still hang out. She ended up saying she couldn‚Äôt but immediately said ‚Äúlet‚Äôs plan for Tuesday afternoon!‚Äù So now we‚Äôre supposed to hang out then.

Only thing is‚Ä¶ I found out she left with some guy from a party last week. I don‚Äôt know if that means anything but it‚Äôs definitely been in my head.

So now I‚Äôm just confused. I actually like her, but I can‚Äôt tell if she‚Äôs into me back or is just a flirty affectionate person.

Ever look at the clock during your 9-to-5 and just think, *""What am I doing with my life?""* ü§î If you‚Äôve hit the big 4-0 or beyond, I bet you‚Äôve started wondering if there‚Äôs more to life than meetings, deadlines, and that oh-so-familiar office coffee. 

Let‚Äôs face it: the grind can be soul-sucking, right? But guess what? It‚Äôs never too late to reclaim your health and happiness! Here are a few thoughts to shake things up:

- **Prioritize YOU**: When did you last spend a whole day doing what *you* love? Maybe it‚Äôs hiking, painting, or binge-watching the next great series. Whatever it is, make it a priority! Trust me, your future self will thank you.

- **Ditch the Toxic**: Toxic jobs can be a silent killer. If you feel drained just thinking about work, it's time to reconsider your environment. Your well-being is the new wealth!

- **Invest in YOU**: This doesn‚Äôt mean throwing your life savings into the latest wellness trend. Sometimes it‚Äôs just about picking up a new hobby or taking that long overdue trip. Who says you can‚Äôt start living your best life right now?

- **Surround Yourself with Positivity**: Remember the power of your circle! If you find yourself weighted down by negativity, maybe it‚Äôs time to pivot and surround yourself with the cheerleaders in your life.

- **Listen to Your Body**: Deadlines fade, but health issues can linger. Take a break, do some yoga, meditate, or just breathe deeply for a moment. Your body needs you to be in tune with it!

And I get it‚Äîit sounds easier said than done. But I came across something that really resonated with me. It's about taking control and making choices that align with what we deserve‚Äîhappiness and health! Check this out: **We believe in strongest people.** [Link here!](https://mavely.app.link/e/TuANm4vQCSb) 

Here‚Äôs a little humor to lighten your day: Ever tried to drag yourself out of bed only to hear your alarm? Think of it as your daily reminder that you‚Äôre still in the game. But guess what? You can play by your rules now!

So, what about you? Have you started delegating tasks to the ‚Äúfuture you""? Let‚Äôs chat below! How are you planning to reclaim your time? üåà‚ú®

She loves English class, so she would often want to chat with me about books and writing, but would also confide in me about personal things she was dealing with. This was as a small private school, so the teachers developed closer relationships with the kids and families than at a public school-- it was just a different vibe. Anyways, she's in 9th grade this year and just emailed me to ask if we could meet at a coffee shop so that she could tell me about how high school is going.

I know that I have set very healthy boundaries with her, and I would love to hear how she's been doing, but I'm still a little wary of meeting up with a teenager one on one-- I'm a fairly new teacher, so I haven't really dealt with this before!

Having some trouble pulling shots of decaf espresso with a breville machine. I have a separate breville grinder for the decaf beans, and keep high test in the built in hopper.

I utilize both regularly: and can usually get the caffeinated pulls right, but not always - and always have trouble with the decaf. I don‚Äôt live somewhere with fresh beans super accessible, so I recognize that this might be an issue ahead of time - but we don‚Äôt have anything super old. That being said‚Ä¶

When I grind a puck finely, higher or lower in volume, the pressure gauge gets up to espresso range: however, I don‚Äôt always get much liquid (sometimes it‚Äôs plenty) and always have a full jar of campbells coffee soup sitting on top of the puck when I remove the porta filter.  I get it, this seems too fine.

When I do the opposite and go coarser, I don‚Äôt get a soupy puck and get more liquid, but then the pressure gauge doesn‚Äôt hit espresso range.  Even with slight changes, there just doesn‚Äôt seem to be the ‚Äúperfect middle‚Äù.

I‚Äôm stirring the puck up with a toothpick before I tamp, making sure it‚Äôs all even, tamping with accurate pressure (I‚Äôve measured), and measure the amount of grind with the breville razor to be sure I‚Äôm not too high or low - though I‚Äôve tried going either way. I clean my machine regularly and use filtered water, and, like I said, the freshest beans I can get.

Is this just a decaf thing?  What else can I try?  Any help is appreciated. Thank you!",1,1759622836.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

Friday Evening - Not entirely sure, but maybe along the Blue Line or near to the Magificent Mile - We're kind of tempted by The Cheesecake Factory, having been there before, but somewhere less chain would also be nice

Saturday Morning snack - We would like to grab something near to the Chicago Architecture Center, I''m looking at places like [Sugar Bliss](https://www.sugarblisscakes.com/), [Goddess and the Baker](https://www.goddessandthebaker.com/) or [Stan's Donuts & Coffee](https://www.stansdonuts.com/).

Saturday Lunch - We're planning on going to [Lou Malnati's](https://www.loumalnatis.com) on North Michigan Avenue for their Gluten Free Deep Pan Pizzas. Are we likely to need to book this?

Saturday Evening - Somewhere with good sized portions of Gluten Free Pasta, that's close to the Blue Line, and isn't too expensive.

¬†

‚ÄúNever question,

Never doubt,

Always trust the party!‚Äù

The slogan was plastered

On the wall, a reminder

Of the golden rule of life.

I sigh as I continue sipping

From my cold coffee.

It would be warmer, if

Only the party decided

To focus on resources instead

Of festivals and parades.

One man behind me,

Wearing a vest with a golden

Triangle patch, taps me on

The shoulder and asks

The problem.

I immediately spewed out

My problems to him,

Finally having someone to

Complain to!

He listened well, nodding his

Head in agreement.

His constant smiling,

Nodding, and agreement

Was a bit off-putting,

But I let it slide.

I just needed someone

To talk to.

He simply responded to me,

With that creepy smile

And a cold, icy tone,

‚ÄúWhy so many questions?

Why not trust the party

Will solve it all?‚Äù

Disturbed, I got up

And left the caf√©.

¬†

At the office,

I go to my numbered cubicle.

The clacking of all the employees‚Äô

Keyboards created an almost

Symphonic tune, one that

I shall join.

A few hours in,

I began to realize something is

Amiss.

The reports, the drafts,

All of them are for

Useless expenses!

As my frustration began to

Build, I quickly noticed that

All the cubicles had gone silent.

No clacking, no phone calls,

Absolute silence.

I looked around and noticed

The employees were still

There, sitting upward in the

Cubicles. But they were

Just doing nothing, nothing

But staring into space.

The massive loudspeaker

On the far wall suddenly

Came alive with a piercing

Crackle. ‚ÄúI know what you

Think, I can hear your doubts.

Thinking that this may be just

A bunch of worthless tasks.

But I must remind you,

Never doubt the party.

It all has a purpose.‚Äù

Out of nowhere a

Man dressed in uniform,

With a golden triangle patch

On his arm,

Gently puts his hand on

My shoulder and turns me

Around.

The touch sent chills down

My spine,

And that creepy smile looked

Both ominous and familiar.

He leaned in with his beady

Eyes and plastered smile,

His breath creeping down

My neck,

And whispered,

‚ÄúNever doubt.‚Äù

Frightened, I packed

My briefcase full of documents

And fled.

¬†

Arriving back at my

Apartment, Cube No. 15,

I quickly entered in the passcode.

The door opened up to a small,

Completely white room.

It included a bed, a stovetop,

A fridge, a sink, and a toilet.

With the utmost urgency,

I quickly piled my belongings

Into my suitcase.

I have to get out of here,

The party will kill me!

I thought to myself.

As I began packing,

I started to hear a light

Sobbing from outside the

Door.

I went up and looked

And asked, ‚Äúwho‚Äôs there?‚Äù

What sounded like a little

Girl responded ‚ÄúI‚Äôm lost,

I can‚Äôt find my daddy,

Can you help me?‚Äù

I sigh and open the door

Quickly.

‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù

I said,

‚ÄúIn now!‚Äù

She quickly huddled in

To my room.

‚ÄúWhat happened to your Dad?‚Äù

I asked as I turned my back to

Her and continued packing my

Things.

I stopped cold after she

Began to make a chuckling sound.

‚ÄúLike you, he didn‚Äôt trust the party!‚Äù

She said with a creepy smile.

I immediately fell to the ground,

Recoiling in shock from the tranquilizer

Dart.

As I began to lose consciousness,

I could see a golden triangle patch,

Hidden under the girl‚Äôs coat.

A grin began to appear on my face,

As soldiers barged in and began

Surrounding me.

‚ÄúNever doubt,

Never question,

Always trust the party!‚Äù

I hear the soldiers yell

As my vision turns to black.

This session depicts play with the Quick and Dirty combat, and contains a GM decision I made which ostensibly changes the rules, so I can hope its understood why I made it.

**2D6 Roll: Apartment Buildings -> 8 (L‚ÄôErmitage, a high-end apartment complex in Charter Hill)**

L‚ÄôErmitage fit perfectly with Hiroshi‚Äôs impeccable standard of living, but what I liked about Rika and Hiroshi was that they were never sparse with their hospitality. They hosted parties often, and despite my close friendship with my Trauma Team supervisor and mentor, Rika Delabonte, I think they mostly invited me because they knew I‚Äôd always be down to play background guitar.

The security guard at L‚ÄôErmitage‚Äôs eight-level garage didn‚Äôt bother to check for Hiroshi‚Äôs ID‚Äîhe just waved him through. Hiroshi drove up to the fifth level, parked the car, and we headed to that level‚Äôs apartment corridor entrance. He tipped his eyes toward the camera above the door, and it buzzed before opening for him. I followed him inside and down the hallway until we reached 5-209.

He knocked on the door. ‚ÄúBabygirl, you decent?‚Äù

‚ÄúWait!‚Äù Rika called out from the other side. We waited a full minute. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm good now!‚Äù

Hiroshi opened the door by putting his right wrist against the mag-scanner. Hiroshi and Rika‚Äôs two-bedroom apartment was magnificent, with a huge single sliding-glass window that overlooked the entire Nightlife District and the robust Hacienda Hotel and Casino. Rika, with her hair done in a single long ponytail, stood behind the kitchen counter, dressed in a white T-shirt, blue jeans, and green, fluffy slippers. She passed a mug of coffee to Hiroshi, and then another to me.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre looking a lot better than when I left you, Pan,‚Äù Rika said, chipper, a smile on her face.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna guess that the fact I‚Äôm even still among the living is ‚Äôcause of you,‚Äù I replied.

‚ÄúYou wouldn‚Äôt be far off the mark there, but like I wrote in that text, you‚Äôve more got Doc Fogerty to thank for that.‚Äù

I sipped my coffee. ‚ÄúYou did say he wasn‚Äôt the cold-blooded, boring bastard that I had him pegged as.‚Äù

‚ÄúNah, you got it half-right. He‚Äôs pretty boring. But do you want some stuffy guy who reads medical books for fun operating on you when you‚Äôve got six life-threatening lacerations, or a nepo-baby like‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a nepo baby.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot a Trauma Team one.‚Äù

I snickered and sipped my coffee, then took a seat on a stool at the tan-marbled kitchen island.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve got some good news and bad news,‚Äù Rika began.

‚ÄúGood first.‚Äù

‚ÄúClearly, you‚Äôre alive and well, and back to being a badass after you get your full memory back, which should be by this time tomorrow.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe bad news?‚Äù

‚ÄúCorporate is charging you for the care that was provided to you tonight.‚Äù

I nearly did a spit-take. ‚ÄúBullshit!‚Äù

‚ÄúNo bulls, no shit, partner.‚Äù

Hiroshi shook his head and sipped his coffee as he observed.

‚ÄúThe information should be on your employee account by now,‚Äù Rika continued, ‚Äúbut I can tell you the number if you want more bad news.‚Äù

‚ÄúMight as well tell me.‚Äù

‚ÄúTwo-K.‚Äù

‚ÄúBullshit.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo bulls, no shit.‚Äù

I pressed my palm against my right temple. ‚ÄúFuck. Fuck. Fuck. You‚Äôre saying I‚Äôm in debt to my goddamn employer? That‚Äôs‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúTwo months‚Äô rent on a cargo container, if I‚Äôm not mistaken, and you probably only make twelve hundred a month on the job as it is right now. If you were full-time like me, Trauma Team would‚Äôve covered your care expenses, but you‚Äôre part-time. I‚Äôm sorry, Pan.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt feel bad,‚Äù Hiroshi added. ‚ÄúSeventy-five percent of Trauma Team‚Äôs force is part-time‚Äîeven the doctors.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow am I supposed to pay this back?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou keep working your scheduled days, and corporate takes eighty percent out of your checks until the debt is paid. Two thousand is nothing compared to other bills I‚Äôve seen racked up.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat if I say ‚Äòfuck it‚Äô and quit?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Äôll send you to collections, your credit is fucked, and they might even try to get a wage-garnishment order with whoever you get a new job with. Matter of fact, if they press it in circuit court, they‚Äôll definitely get it. That doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôll go through the effort, and maybe you can skirt by without ever paying the debt‚Äîbut you‚Äôll never be able to work with Trauma Team again. Where else are you going to find even part-time steady work right now, Pan?‚Äù

‚ÄúI won‚Äôt be able to make rent like this.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the 4th of the month. You‚Äôve got 26 days to work something out. You‚Äôve had more desperate crunches than this.‚Äù

That was true. Further true was that, in one form or another, I was in some semblance of this situation every month. That‚Äôs what it meant to be poor not just during the Time of the Red, but anytime and anyplace in the world.

‚ÄúBefore he left to pick you up, Hiro and I had a discussion about how best to help you. You don‚Äôt have to deal with this debt alone, and maybe we can permanently help you out.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm listening.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ ethically flexible?‚Äù Hiro asked me.

‚ÄúHiro, no one cares about you being on the take.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not on the take, goddamnit. Colloquially, ‚Äòthe take‚Äô is when a cop takes bribes to act or look the other way. I do other shit.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs ‚Äòother shit‚Äô what you‚Äôre offering to pull me into?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù Rika said. ‚ÄúYou need to clear your debt, and you told me yourself that you wouldn‚Äôt mind having better equipment for your gigs. Maybe a new guitar? Speaking of which‚Äî‚Äù Rika pointed behind me, and my Eurodyne electric was laid up against the back of the couch.

I stood up, picked it up, and examined it. ‚ÄúA new guitar is the last thing I need‚Äîas in, I need a whole bunch of other shit more than I need a new guitar. I need a new amp, maybe a new mic, too.‚Äù

‚ÄúSee? We‚Äôre just trying to get some extra eddies in your pocket, and God knows you need ‚Äôem.‚Äù

I put my axe down and returned to the stool. ‚ÄúThis side-hustle, to be clear, doesn‚Äôt involve‚Äî‚Äù I held up my right hand and ticked off my fingers. ‚Äú‚Äîharvesting organs, assassination, kidnapping, or sign-holding? Especially not sign-holding, because I did that as an odd job once and it was the fucking worst. It was so boring. I‚Äôd almost rather harvest organs and go to hell than do sign-holding, for real.‚Äù

Hiroshi snorted at that.

‚ÄúJesus, Pan, no, we‚Äôre not doing any of that.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnymore,‚Äù Hiroshi taunted.

‚ÄúFuck off, you sexy, crooked motherfucker.‚Äù

**D100 Roll: Mission Type ‚Äì 89 (Steal Prototype)**

‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt mention theft among your hard limits, young-buck. Are you cool or not cool with it?‚Äù

‚ÄúDepends on what we‚Äôre snatching and from whom.‚Äù

‚ÄúExperimental medical technology, and we‚Äôre stealing it from Trauma Team.‚Äù

My heart was filled with immediate glee. The idea of paying off my debt by stealing from my debtor was goddamned diabolical. I remained cool about it, though.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs involved?‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing to it‚Äîrelatively low risk. Come into work tomorrow, and from there I‚Äôll take you to meet the Fixer, and they‚Äôll give you instructions. But once I tell the Fixer tomorrow morning that you‚Äôre in, that‚Äôs it. You‚Äôre in, and if you back out, you will never be able to get work from them again. You‚Äôll talk price with them, too, so don‚Äôt try to negotiate with me.‚Äù

I finished my coffee. ‚ÄúI get you, but also understand that if I‚Äôm not feeling it and I do back out, there‚Äôs no intent to embarrass you, Rika.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know, Pan. Business is business, and some of this side-hustle shit isn‚Äôt for everyone.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut you know I‚Äôm a crooked cop, so now I have to kill you,‚Äù Hiro said, and reached into the island‚Äôs top-right drawer like he was going for a gun. He didn‚Äôt withdraw a gun, but a bottle of authentic Jamaican rum. He set it on the countertop.

‚ÄúToo early for rum?‚Äù he asked us.

‚ÄúNever,‚Äù I shot back.

I only worked for Trauma Team four nights a week, so the rest of my time was spent either performing on the street, working on music, or looking for either another part-time job or day labor. It was hard for anyone to find temporary day labor, regardless of how shitty the work was. Lately, I‚Äôd only bothered going to the day labor office if the manager called me to work, which only happened twice a month at best. When I could, the world heavyweight champion of things to do during the day was to attend auditions; clubs were the best, followed by film-scoring gigs and subbing for local, established bands. I avoided band auditions‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt want to be part of a band unless it was mine.

**Complication: One of the potential clubs, Totentanz, a notable chrome metal club, has ‚ÄúRapcore‚Äù among its ‚ÄúWe Do Not Play‚Äù list of musical genres on its website. P@ndemik may never perform here.**

I slept on Rika‚Äôs living room couch for three hours, then caught a bus back to my cargo container in Megastructure Warren Flats, a region where my mother and father also lived. Rika had left me a medical kit with adhesive patch bandages and instructions for treating my wounds as they healed, so I took all of that with me back home. At 9 a.m., I did my usual scouring for auditions online. I didn‚Äôt find any open calls, and worse yet, Totentanz‚Äîa chrome metal spot where quite a few guitarists have been discovered‚Äîhad added ‚ÄúRap or Rapcore‚Äù to the list of musical acts they‚Äôd sworn to their patrons they wouldn‚Äôt play. Fuck them. They were willing to let fusion-metal guys perform there, but not rapcore.

With that lead dead, I kept up the work-search.

***Action 2: Part-Time Job Search***  
**D100 Closed Oracle Roll: Does Pan find a part-time job lead?**  
**Possibility: Unlikely**  
**Result: 10 (No)**

By the afternoon, I‚Äôd gone to all the job boards. There was nada that I was qualified for, and there were only a few jobs on each site anyway.

After a kibble lunch, I changed out my bandages, showered down at the communal following a twenty-minute wait, and returned to my container when I was done. I was too tired to street perform that day, as I was going to meet Rika‚Äôs Fixer in the evening, so I just caught a nap until 5:30 p.m.

***Action 3: Rest***  
**Pan is already at full HP.**

**##Mission 01: Steal the Biotechnica ZT-6##**  
**Risk: Low**  
**Payout: 500 Eddies, Performance-Based Bonus Possible**  
**D100 Location Oracle: 94 (Old Japantown)**

I reported to my usual Trauma Team Station on Shiro Ave. in Old Japantown. From the outside, the station was rundown and bullet-riddled because it had resisted two Boostergang raids within the past year and three the year before that. Lucky for the Old Japantown station, a.k.a. the Rutsubo, its ruined exterior disguised that within the station were current, state-of-the-art Aerodyne crafts, guns, and grenades supplied by everyone from Militech to the Night Market. And since the Rutsubo was staffed by the victorious defenders of those years of raids, the squads knew how to work those weapons, too.

When I got to my hangar with my guns, my replacement uniform, and a new vest on, Rika and the rest of the team were already there. Doc Fogerty‚Äôs brown hair was wild, and I think that was his intent‚Äîthere was a sex-symbol doctor on a long-running Trauma Team-based TV show called *Hot in the City,* and I think Doc Fogerty wanted to be him. The problem with that desire was that Doc Fogerty wasn‚Äôt good-looking like the doctor on that show‚Äînot even close‚Äîand the guy with the wild hair on that show was 25, while Doc Fogerty was 45.

Red-haired, mid-30s Rowan Reese leaned against the hull of the Aerodyne with a cigarette tucked between his right index and forefinger. He was a chain-smoker for sure, but with the money he made as a senior pilot for Trauma Team, he could just go and buy new lungs if he ever got cancer. Shit, he could‚Äôve probably just requisitioned a new pair of breathing bags.

Rika was pretty nonchalant, though. Everyone was quiet, and that wasn‚Äôt characteristic of this squad I‚Äôd been part of for the past fifteen months. I glanced at each member of my team individually, yet all of them stared at me with a certain amount of expectation.

Finally, I got the clue.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs you, isn‚Äôt it? You‚Äôre the Fixer.‚Äù

**Major NPC Added: Doc Fogerty ‚Äì Role (Medtech/Fixer)**

‚ÄúYou proved yourself last night; otherwise we wouldn‚Äôt be having this discussion. I still don‚Äôt like you, though,‚Äù Doc Fogerty said, his tone as neutral and blunt as ever.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like you, either.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood. That reinforces that this business arrangement stays purely business.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs it cool to talk here?‚Äù

‚ÄúSurveillance is lax in the hangars, heavy in the vehicles. The Aerodyne records everything, even when it‚Äôs powered down.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo I‚Äôve heard.‚Äù

Rowan held out a Trauma Team-issued agent to me.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been hacked,‚Äù Rowan said.

‚ÄúGo down to the vault, show that to Indira, and get her to pull the Biotechnica ZT-6 for you. She might take some convincing.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs my cut?‚Äù

‚Äú500 eddies, paid upon delivery. That‚Äôs the last question you‚Äôll ever get to ask any of us about anything you‚Äôre tasked with.‚Äù

I looked to Rika, but she was silent.

‚Äú600,‚Äù I said.

**Skill Check: Persuasion**  
**1d10 + 12 vs. 15 DV (Doc Fogerty expects Pan to haggle, and the trio is, in general, trying to mentor him)**  
**Result: 17 (Success)**

‚ÄúWhy should you get a 100-eddie raise?‚Äù Doc Fogerty asked me.

‚ÄúYou said Indira will take some convincing, and you know I got the gift of gab. I‚Äôm asking for what I‚Äôm worth.‚Äù

‚ÄúDeal. 600, and don‚Äôt push it.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, really, Pan. Don‚Äôt push it,‚Äù Rika said.

***NPC Note: Affinity with Rika grows; she is proud of him.***

I decided against asking for even more. I took the agent from Rowan and headed down a floor to the Supply Vault, which was covered by Indira Vas, a dark-haired, middle-aged, and overweight Indian woman behind a counter. She might not have been very dangerous, but the three turrets within the corridor leading to the vault were.

I smiled and approached Indira.

‚ÄúGood evenin‚Äô,‚Äù I said, and held out the Trauma Team agent.

‚ÄúGood evening, Pete,‚Äù Indira replied. ‚ÄúGlad to see you‚Äôre ready for work; I heard you had some trouble last night.‚Äù

‚ÄúAny night that we make it back home is a good one.‚Äù

Indira inspected the agent.

He could then make other requests of her. Imploding dice will cause Indira to report Pan, and he‚Äôll be immediately suspended from Trauma Team if he can‚Äôt beat a ‚Äúdesperation roll.‚Äù**

***Segment 1***\*\*: Spotting Opportunities for Distraction (Human Perception)\*\*  
**As Indira inspected the agent, I checked out her outfit, her hair, and her manicure to see if I could use any of them as compliment-ammo.**

**Result: 10 on d10**  
**Exploding Dice‚Ä¶**

I focused my gaze upon Indira‚Äôs lips, which were covered in fresh, ruby-red lipstick. I knew she would eventually feel that gaze upon her. When she did and looked up, I looked away and blushed.

‚ÄúIs everything alright, Pete?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ nothing.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you sure?‚Äù

I blushed again. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ ah. Your lipstick. I hope I‚Äôm not being too forward or anything, and don‚Äôt report me to H.R., but‚Ä¶ nah.‚Äù

Indira giggled. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be bashful. I thought you were a rockerboy‚Äîyou‚Äôre supposed to be all easy around women.‚Äù

‚ÄúYour lipstick is‚Ä¶ really sexy. Just something about it. There, I said it.‚Äù

Indira shook her head. ‚ÄúThanks, Pete.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know you‚Äôre married, but still.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre poly.‚Äù

‚ÄúDoes your hubs know that?‚Äù

Indira didn‚Äôt answer that; her lips just curved into a sly smile. She opened the notepad function on the agent, typed in some numbers, and passed the agent back to me. Her phone number was displayed on the screen.

‚ÄúLet me go and grab your item for you,‚Äù Indira said as she stepped away from the vault‚Äôs service window. Next to the window was a 10x10 delivery chute that only she could remotely unlock. I heard a thunk in the chute, then Indira returned to the window. The chute‚Äôs lock clicked, and I opened it. Within the chute was a sealed white container with the words ‚ÄúConfidential,‚Äù ‚ÄúZT-6,‚Äù and ‚ÄúProperty of Biotechnica.‚Äù I tucked the agent into my back pocket and winked at Indira.

‚ÄúThanks, baby,‚Äù I said, and she blew me a slow, genuine, sweet-natured kiss.

I returned to the hangar with the ZT-6 container tucked under my right arm. Doc Fogerty and Rowan appeared surprised that I‚Äôd come back so fast, but Rika simply nodded as I passed the container to Doc Fogerty.

‚ÄúNo issues?‚Äù Doc Fogerty asked me.

‚ÄúTold you I was worth the raise. She might even do us a few more favors in the future.‚Äù

Rowan immediately handed me six folded hundred-euronotes. ‚ÄúA star is born.‚Äù

I was a little curious about what the prototype was for, but Doc Fogerty had said it, and it wasn‚Äôt my first time hearing it: No Questions.

I was pretty sure that, before I maybe-actualized my dreams of musical prominence, I was going to hear that phrase again.

**##Day 1 Gig: Trauma Team Patrol##**

We entered our Aerodyne, and Rika threw on her custom Kevlar vest, which bore the logo of Squad Zero-H-Nine-Four, ‚ÄúThe Trick-or-Treat‚Äù: an orange Halloween pumpkin bearing a grin with a bullet caught between its ‚Äúteeth.‚Äù Though small, our squad had a long history, dating back to the 2020s, and had the highest rescue count of any Rutsubo squad in the aftermath of the nuke that went off two decades ago. Rika took the legacy of The Trick-or-Treat seriously, and even Doc Fogerty wore a Trick-or-Treat turtleneck beneath his white lab coat. Rika wouldn‚Äôt tell me how our squad got the name ‚ÄúTrick-or-Treat‚Äù yet, as I was only part-time‚Äîand part-timers could be replaced at any time, for nearly any reason. However, at fifteen months, I‚Äôd lasted way longer than any other part-timer in years.

Rowan launched our vehicle, and when we reached two hundred feet in altitude, we pushed off into the Night City evening.

**D100 Closed Question Oracle: Does the Trick-or-Treat Squad see any action tonight?**

A mere four minutes after we reached patrol altitude, the lights within the crew bay flashed red and the alarm blared. Rowan flipped the alarm off as soon as we got it, but flipped the siren lights on. Thirty seconds later, his voice came over the crew bay‚Äôs intercom while I was already giving my Midnight Arms revolver one last chamber-check:

‚ÄúClient designated ‚ÄòExecutive Client‚Äô‚ÄîI repeat, Executive Client‚ÄîTrace, Kevin. Address 3049 Yubei Blvd. in Japantown. Trace Electronics. Client has one confirmed bullet wound to the right leg. Stand by for local data feed.‚Äù

Rika and I checked our Trauma Team agents, and the Aerodyne‚Äôs AI took control of them. A map of the response zone was displayed: a satellite-precise image of a dirty Old Japantown street, though Trace Electronics had two floors and appeared kind of upscale.

Two men and two women, all of them wearing crude clown facepaint, were opening fire on the store.

‚ÄúFucking Bozos,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúDead or alive?‚Äù

‚ÄúBody ‚Äôem,‚Äù was Rika‚Äôs immediate reply, and she handed my standard-issue Trauma Team helmet to me. She then donned her own custom black helmet, which had jagged teeth drawn on it like a jack-o‚Äô-lantern‚Äôs. I secured my helmet and drew my Kang-Tao shotgun. Rika had her modified ModFire 10x lowered to her right side.

The Aerodyne set down 30 meters south of the pickup zone. Stealth wasn‚Äôt an option, as there was no doubt the four Bozos had seen us flying overhead.

**Battle Result: Trick-or-Treat Squad barely defeats the Bozos.**

The gunfire on the store stopped, which meant the clowns had already turned their guns in our direction and wanted to wait until first sight of us to open fire. Unfortunately for them, Rika‚Äôs ModFire had laser sighting and a scope. She had the first of them dead to rights from fifteen meters.

‚ÄúTrick or treat,‚Äù she shouted, and then let a single round fly from her small assault rifle. It pierced the head of one of the two Bozo girls and put her down instantly. Rika fired again, and one of the two male Bozos went down from a bullet to the center of his neck.

The second Bozo girl raised her pistol, but Rika put her down with a precise shot to the heart, and she finished off the final Bozo with two shots to the head.

Six seconds‚Äîthat‚Äôs how long the fight lasted. That‚Äôs how fuckin‚Äô beast Rika was, and she knew it. She took cover behind the exterior of a building, and I took cover next to her. She peeked inside and scanned the area; her helmet had advanced thermal imaging.

‚ÄúOne alive and inside,‚Äù Rika said. ‚ÄúAll hostiles down.‚Äù

Rika motored to the electronics store, and I followed. She pressed herself against the side of the front door for cover, opened it, and peeked inside.

‚ÄúClear. Trauma Team!‚Äù

‚ÄúTrauma Team?‚Äù shouted a man from the locked manager‚Äôs office behind the service counter.

‚ÄúTrauma Team!‚Äù

‚ÄúBack here!‚Äù

The door‚Äôs lock clicked, and Rika opened it. A 5‚Äô7‚Äù, thin-bearded, overweight, middle-aged white man with a cyber-arm was on the floor with a handgun wound in his belly. He cradled the wound with his right hand.

‚ÄúFuck‚Ä¶ oh fuck‚Äî‚Äù the man breathed hard, and his shirt was soaked with blood and sweat. Rika unclipped one of her Madrilex‚Äîa pharmaceutical made to stop people from going into shock, which this man was. She handed the orange syringe to me and I uncorked it, but I couldn‚Äôt administer the treatment without her permission.

The man‚Äôs agent lay next to his right hand, with his Trauma Team Executive Plan ID displayed. Rika picked it up, confirmed it with a once-over, and then nodded to me. I injected the Madrilex syringe into his right lung and held his shoulder to balance him while I did. I took a step back and observed him; in overweight people with elevated potassium, Madrilex could cause a stroke. I exhaled in relief when, after fifteen seconds, that didn‚Äôt happen to him.

Rika further inspected the man‚Äôs agent. ‚ÄúYour information says ‚ÄòNo Cryopumps.‚Äô Is that still the case, Mr. Trace?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, ma‚Äôam. Fuckin‚Äô things terrify me.‚Äù

I laid my shotgun down, then unslung my gray equipment backpack. I set it on the floor and removed my advanced care kit, filled with wound-cleaning tools, adhesive bandages, and even a Speedheal syringe.

‚ÄúLet me move your hand, sir,‚Äù I said, and then I pulled his bloody hand away from his belly.

**Stabilization: A First-Aid Check**  
**DV = 13 (Seriously Wounded)**  
**Result: 1d10 (6) + First Aid (13) = 19**  
**Pan succeeds in stabilizing the client.**

Within four minutes, I‚Äôd cleaned the gutshot and stopped the bleeding with hemostatic bandages. Seconds after the stabilization, Doc Fogerty hurried through the door with a stretcher. Rika and I helped the man up, placed him on the stretcher, and the Aerodyne had landed right outside the building. We loaded Kevin Trace into the Aerodyne‚Äôs medbay, and Doc Fogerty banged on the right side of the hatch‚Äôs wall twice. The Aerodyne took off and reached its emergency flight altitude within twenty-five seconds. Doc Fogerty was already in the medbay with Mr. Trace on the operating table, ready to begin life-saving surgery.

‚ÄúSix minutes and forty seconds,‚Äù Rowan reported into the medbay, where Doc Fogerty, Rika, and I were located. The time report was extremely important, as anything over eight minutes was cause for a write-up in the Rutsubo.

Rika removed her helmet. ‚ÄúGood stuff.‚Äù

‚ÄúFuckin‚Äô A, queen,‚Äù I replied.

**##Mission 02 Complete##**  
**IP Awarded: 15**  
**New Trauma Team Debt: 1700**

Rika and I stood around in the crew bay during the brief ride to St. Teresa Hospital.

I gripped a safety rail above my head. ‚ÄúWhat do you think the situation with this client was? The Bozos didn‚Äôt even get into the store.‚Äù

Rika‚Äôs lips scrunched into an expression of annoyance. ‚ÄúLikely story: the Bozos just felt like shooting at someone‚Äôs store. The client was present and caught a piece of something. That‚Äôs how it is with those painted-up gonk fuckboys.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt reply, as that indeed seemed the likely story. The Bozos had been a problem around Old Japantown that had only worsened within my fifteen months on Trauma Team, and, as it was in the Combat Zones, the cops weren‚Äôt doing jack shit about them.

‚ÄúHiro didn‚Äôt mention it until after you left this morning,‚Äù Rika said, ‚Äúbut he said that last night, you two had a run-in with some Nomads.‚Äù

‚ÄúBlood Nation. They offered me a gig that was probably just bullshit talk.‚Äù

Rika‚Äôs eyes widened as she peered at me. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been invited to a Blood Nation gig and you‚Äôre thinking it‚Äôs trash? Young-buck, what do you know about the Blood Nation?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot much. Nomads, and they have some pretty good road-soul bands that play around the city.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know shit, then. No offense.‚Äù

‚ÄúQueen, you‚Äôre rude so often, I‚Äôm desensitized to it.‚Äù

‚ÄúRight? Anyway, they‚Äôre pretty juiced in with the entire Night City entertainment scene. Not just the clubs, but the theatres, the troupes, movies, and the music industry. If this gig invite wasn‚Äôt bullshit, this could be quite an opportunity for you.‚Äù

‚ÄúAs in‚Ä¶ getting discovered?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what people come to Night City for, ain‚Äôt it?‚Äù

‚ÄúI always thought of it as a place where rich assholes come to get shot so they can go home, lie about how it happened, and look like badasses.‚Äù

‚ÄúGoddamnit, young-buck. This is serious talk. The life expectancy of a part-time Trauma Teamer is two months, and the average time it takes for a part-time Trauma Teamer to make it to full time is six years, if ever. Do you really want to risk your life with this shit for much longer‚Äîwith your talent?‚Äù

‚ÄúTrauma Team‚Äôs been good to you.‚Äù

‚ÄúAs you, Hiro, and Doc love to remind me, I started ahead of everyone else, and Hiro helped me out, too.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat am I supposed to be doing that I‚Äôm not already doing?‚Äù

‚ÄúIf your Blood Nation guy confirms the gig, don‚Äôt report for any shifts here until after the gig. You need time to prepare. We‚Äôll get a substitute.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre sure it‚Äôs cool?‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no way we‚Äôre replacing you after what you did for us tonight. You‚Äôre good, Pan.‚Äù

I nodded.

‚ÄúTo that end, we might be able to help each other out yet again. How do you feel about taking on a drummer?‚Äù

‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt be able to pay them anything but fuckin‚Äô peanuts.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Äôll work for that‚Äî‚Äù Rika pulled her personal agent from an inner pocket of her Kevlar vest. Her fingers glided across the screen.

**D100 Nonbinary Names Roll: 91 (Summer)**  
**D100 Handle Roll: 11 (Any Feature of Nature‚ÄîRain)**  
**D10 Role Roll: Nomad**

Rika pulled up the social media profile for a pretty attractive white girl, apparently around my age, with a shock-red pixie cut and dressed in an old black motorcycle riding suit. Her name was Summer Rain, and her profile pictures had her at motorcycle meets and playing the drums at live shows, looking intense as she did so.

‚ÄúThat is obviously a Nomad, and I don‚Äôt play with Nomads.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat? Why? You racist against them or something?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, they don‚Äôt act right. They get shitfaced during the set no matter how short it is, or they start fights with the club staff. Every. Goddamn. Time.‚Äù

Rika shrugged, because even she knew it was true. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs‚Ä¶ what she‚Äôs in jail for right now. Hiro‚Äôs talked to some people and he wants to release her, but someone needs to keep her on her best behavior.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs in it for him?‚Äù

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs an informant for him.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh. Which lockup is she in?‚Äù

‚ÄúCorpo Central.‚Äù

‚ÄúDamn, she must‚Äôve stepped on some big toes. I‚Äôll get her in the morning.‚Äù

After we delivered Mr. Kevin Trace to the hospital, the rest of the shift was uneventful. At 6 a.m. we returned to the Rutsubo, and I caught a bus back to my cargo container. At exactly 7 a.m., I sent a text to Punish.

*it‚Äôs* [*P@ndemik*](mailto:P@ndemik)*. Were you and yours being real about weekend gig?*

Ten minutes later, I got a reply.

*blood nation always real. gig is saturday, be here at 5 to set up early*

Punish sent me a map pin. The gig location was at a place that, as a child of Night City, I‚Äôd been told to never, ever‚Äînever-ever‚Äîgo to:

1ny9fi6,https://i.redd.it/a1qdoshwn6tf1.jpeg,What is the best grind setting to dial in WatchHouse 1829 Espresso? [Bambino Plus/ Baratza ESP],Any tips for dialing in WatchHouse 1829 espresso? It was roasted on 9/30 and I‚Äôm still getting used to my Baratza ESP grinder. I usually dose at 18G on other brands. I used to have a regular Baratza grinder for the last five years or so. I have a Breville Bambino Plus. Also I previously always used the dual wall basket but should I try the single wall basket? These beans aren‚Äôt old like the other bag I had wanted to use up but I have been recently having some trouble dialing in and getting real long times/limited espresso. My assumption was because those beans were older from June. Thank you in advance for any tips on the ESP and any thoughts on this espresso! I‚Äôve never gotten before and excited to try.

We started talking after we got paired for a group project. At first, it was just the usual school stuff like sharing notes, reminding each other about deadlines, meeting up in the library. He was funny, easy to talk to, and honestly made the boring parts of class a lot better.

After a while, it started to feel different. He‚Äôd save me a seat before class, bring me coffee exactly how I like it, and text me random things throughout the day just to make me laugh. I started noticing the way he smiled when he saw me, how his voice softened when he said my name.

A few nights ago, we stayed late at the library finishing our project. It was already dark outside, and he offered to walk me to my dorm. We ended up sitting on the steps talking about everything like music, family, even the things that stress us out. It felt comfortable in a way I didn‚Äôt expect.

Then yesterday, he asked if I wanted to grab dinner after class. My heart did that stupid flutter thing, and I told myself not to overthink it. We went to this small pizza place near campus and talked for hours. It honestly felt like a date.

Right when I started thinking this might actually be something, he smiled and said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd really get along with my girlfriend. She‚Äôs into the same kind of music as you.‚Äù

I just froze. I laughed it off, acted cool, and said something like, ‚ÄúOh, that‚Äôs nice,‚Äù but inside it felt like the floor dropped. I went home that night and stared at the ceiling, trying to convince myself it was just a silly crush.

The worst part is he‚Äôs still just as kind and warm, like nothing‚Äôs changed. But it has. At least for me.",1,1759621762.0,story,0,1.0,False

I would love to be friend!","Did it work? I'm sure it worked if you're reading this! So hi, I'm shadow\_surf. Imagine if this was my real name. Maybe then people wouldn't butcher it like they do with my real name lol. We've all had that one teacher, right? If not, I'm sure a coffee shop like Starbucks comes up with a creative way to make that happen when writing our name on the cup.

Either way, I'm a 29 year old dude, living his life away on the east coast of the US. Like many of us here, we're looking for that one friend that will join us on our journey through life. Someone we can truly get to know, bond with, and see develop over time. Sadly, when it comes to finding someone, I've had terrible luck. Feels like a lot of people lose interest very easily or stop replying as time goes on. I'm still holding on to the hope that there is someone out there that is interested in the real, genuine friendship and is willing to stick around. Life these last few years have gotten very lonely and it feels many people nowadays just aren't interested in investing the time and effort to make things work. Or they might jump to someone else if they get bored :/ So I'm making this post in the hopes of making a new, long term friend, hoping this post might catch someone's eye!

I'm sitting here near my desk on a boring evening, composing a post to find that amazing, caring friend. A friend that is understanding, passionate, loyal, loving, and honest. Just all the beautiful, awesome qualities we would like to find in a best friend. Sure, trying to find someone online can be difficult or take a lot of effort, but I'm holding on to the hope that this catches the attention of someone that is really wanting to be buddies with a dude named shadow\_surf

This is the part I talk a bit about myself. This part is usually what I tend to dread, especially during those ice breakers from the first day in our classes, but thankfully I have some time to think things out rather than be put on the spot. I'm sure most of us dread those...

* Living on a floating rock, revolving around the Sun. If you can guess the precise location, I'll be slightly freaked out but highly impressed!
* A generally quiet dude but can also be rather outgoing at times (especially online)
* I enjoy exploring about, especially in nature, beaches, old abandoned buildings inhabitant by ghosts
* A driven individual where I enjoy working towards the things I'm passionate about¬†¬†
* Respectful, honest (I suck at telling lies), a listener, enjoy being there for others, understanding, and caring
* Very single at the moment (not something I'm pushing for but if if there happens to be a connection, seeing that develop is something I'm not against)
* Enjoy various hobbies, such as reading novels, writing poetry, video editing, \*attempting\* cooking, gaming, and going to the gym

**What qualities do I look for in a friend?**

* Is a human and breathing üòÇ
* **An individual that sticks around. Not looking for someone that ghosts or disappears after a day or two. (I'm going to bold this statement because I know a lot of people simply stop caring after a day or want to jump to another person or not take the initiative to continue this because they simply get bored). Let's be real about our intentions :)**
* Puts effort into the conversation. Those one worded responses truly kill me sometimes. This helps us keep engaged and learn more about one another!
* An understanding and caring individual

It doesn't matter what your age is or where you're from! Feel free to reach out if you'd like a best friend! :)",1,1759621653.0,Needafriend,1,1.0,False

Context: Selling financial SaaS to ISPs. Have a major industry event in 1 week and need to book meetings beforehand.

**The situation:**

* 2 months in the role
* Competing against another rep (couple years experience in ISP's) who will be at the same event
* Need to send cold emails to \~700 ISPs before the conference
* Limited data for personalization at scale

**Specific questions:**

1. What's the best approach for pre-event cold emails? (Subject lines, messaging, timing?)
2. How do I personalize at this volume without deep account research on each?
3. What CTA works best - ""meet at booth X"" vs ""coffee at the event"" vs something else?
4. Any tips for competing against a more experienced rep at the same event?

For me it's azucena and king.
She just annoys me, the voice lines and stuff are just so cringe, azucenas rage art is a fucking coffee ad, and I get they were trying to go for a Deadpool, bug bunny type of vibe but it's just a miss for me.

And for king, I just can't get over the tiger mask, it's so silly, and there's no options to have him maskless, the other mask options are ok I guess, but I would've loved if he actually spike instead of just made tiger noises, like you can have him make tiger noises and stuff too when he's hit or hitting or exerting himself, not all the time, I would've loved for him to speak Spanish and stuff.

My family and I were baptised last December, with my son being churched and baptised in February.  In May, my mom died and we had to move to Florida to take care of my dad who is struggling on his own.  We went from a church with 5+ moms with kids all around my oldests age, to a parish where we are the only baptised couple with children as everyone else in our parish is elderly Russian women.  Recently I've been running out of ideas to keep my toddler and my baby quiet on Sundays.  I know that no crying babies means a dying church but they don't really cry.

 My 9 month old son babbles and laughs very loudly unless he is being held and bounced, which at any other time is absolutely adorable but can be exhausting on my arms.  My husband and I take turns holding and bouncing him, but about halfway through liturgy we're both tired of doing it.  Since we're so new to this parish is feel awkward asking the other parishioners for help.

My daughter, almost 2, is generally good, but always wants to run off to try and play with the older children of this one Russian woman, and it appears that she does not want her kids talking or playing during liturgy, which is understandable.  The kids immediately look to their mom with terrified faces when my daughter approaches, so I imagine she's very strict and I don't want to get them in trouble with her.

I would like to mention that everyone at our parish loves my kids and wants to help us during coffee hour, but I am very bad at both asking for and accepting help.  I've gotten a little better, but a lot of times I freeze up completely when someone asks if I need help with the kids.  It also feels like we are disturbing liturgy sometimes as the old men in our parish sometimes give the kids a mean old man look when they are too loud.  I also feel like we are setting a bad example for the family of catechumens we have with young children.

1ny97fv,https://www.reddit.com/r/carnivorediet/comments/1ny97fv/30_days_30_pounds/,30 days 30 pounds,"So I started carnivore 30 days ago at 5‚Äô 10‚Äù 337 pounds just to try something new to me. I didn‚Äôt go super strict, and I‚Äôve had a few cheat days for birthdays and family dinners but I‚Äôm enjoying it far more than I expected. I‚Äôm currently 306.

When I got into powerlifting I went from 200 up to 270, and then when I got hurt (unrelated to powerlifting) the eating continued but the working out did not. Then I found myself in my current shape. 

My diet consists of meats: Chicken, steak, bacon, sausage, ground beef, shrimp. Along with eggs of course. 

Dairy: butter, creamer (morning coffee), cheeses, milk (just randomly), and heavy whipping cream (I make Alfredo sauce for my chicken and shrimp occasionally)

I know people recommend salt, but I just don‚Äôt enjoy it, never have, and so I don‚Äôt use any added salts at all.

Also, I drink Coke Zero daily.

The biggest changes I‚Äôve noticed are, nothing hurts‚Ä¶Since I got out of the army I‚Äôve had a lot of chronic pain, especially in my lower extremities from breaks, injuries and just general overuse. My gut health has been phenomenal, no gas or irritation. I went from using the bathroom several times a day to once, not including urination. My clothes fit insanely better, and my sex drive feels like my early 20‚Äôs (I‚Äôm 34 now).

What‚Äôs been most surprising about carnivore is the lack of cravings and how easily I get and stay ‚Äúfull‚Äù. In any diet I‚Äôve done previously I always crave sweets and carbs in general. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, occasionally I see something that looks good and want to try it, but It‚Äôs very easy to just shrug it off and walk away without thinking twice. I‚Äôve noticed there are days where I go back and count my calories and I‚Äôve only eaten 1200 calories for the day but I‚Äôm not hungry. In fact, very rarely have I felt hungry at all, and when I do I realize I haven‚Äôt eaten in over 16 hours. (From dinner to past lunch the next day.) On more than a few occasions I‚Äôve not eaten dinner, just felt good and didn‚Äôt want to feel overly full.

Overall I‚Äôm pleasantly surprised with the way I feel.  No brain fog, I‚Äôm not tired, and I don‚Äôt experience any crashes throughout the day. 

The downside? Boredom? I was always one to enjoy trying new foods or recipes. I grew up in an Italian family, so the array of dishes and random finger foods was quite large. On carnivore the list of options is obviously much shorter, but so is my shopping list.

I‚Äôm thinking of cutting out the dairy products for the next 30 days. A friend who‚Äôs done carnivore recommended it to stay ahead of any coming plateaus, which in my research are common around this time frame. 

That‚Äôs my review of my first experience trying carnivore, I‚Äôll see how it goes from here.",4,1759621450.0,carnivorediet,2,1.0,False
1ny96qw,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1ny96qw/thoughts_advice/,Thoughts? Advice?,"A year and a half ago I broke up with my ex and I had no intention of dating. I met this guy at a coffee shop I worked at and we became pretty close friends. He came in all the time and we had such good banter, ended up hanging out and he was obviously very into me. Everyone saw how close we were and how much we liked each other. I was really really into him but I was unavailable and I told him that. He kind of ignored it and we would hang out casually or he‚Äôd take me on a date and to be honest, hanging out with him was the most fun I‚Äôve had with someone in so long. There was just something about being together and we were so comfortable with each other. 

I told him I wasn‚Äôt looking for anything and if we slept together it had to be just casual/having fun. The sex was so good. I knew I was confusing him. I was confusing myself. We would spend the night and I would tell him how much I liked him and I knew he wanted more but I couldn‚Äôt give it at that time. One night we went out with friends and I was acting childish and pushing him away by talking about other guys and when we got to my house he asked ‚Äúdo you think I‚Äôm attracted to you when you‚Äôre talking about other guys‚Äù I was childish in the communication but I asked if we could talk inside but he said no, that I was going to use him for sex and that wasn‚Äôt it at all. He demanded I take him home. I ended up staying with him the next night before I left the country on vacation and he was an ass but he took me to the airport in the morning. We ended up arguing so much one day over text when I was away and stopped talking. When I got back I asked to talk and he refused but he still came into the coffee shop I worked at everyday and would bring his dog or just walk around the area. It was kind of obvious he wanted me to see him. He still watched every one of my stories and one day I asked if we could sleep together and he said no. So valid. He ended up getting a girlfriend and I respected that and we haven‚Äôt talked in a year. 

I lost my dog, my soul, and I left the country for 6 months to travel. Fast forward to when I come back and I‚Äôm working at a new coffee shop on the other side of town. One day I‚Äôm working and he walks in. I froze. I was so nervous and thought he hated me. I went to the back and then I came out and we looked at each other and I smiled and said hey. Oddly enough, things seemed like we used to be in terms of banter and he came over and talked to me for a bit and told me happy birthday. He came in the next week with his friend and we chatted for a bit and I mentioned I had a boyfriend. We had been dating for a month at this point and we no longer date. Him and his friend were sitting across the cafe and I look up and notice him looking at me and I smile. That was the last time I saw him and I honestly wish I could see him again. Apparently he had been going to that coffee shop since I left and after that second time seeing him, he hasn‚Äôt gone back. At least not to my knowledge.

I‚Äôve thought about him a lot and about the ‚Äúcoincidence‚Äù upon returning to the city. I know he‚Äôs not with his girlfriend anymore but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs my place to reach out. I wonder had I never mentioned having a boyfriend at the time if he would have reached out. I think about our connection and how shit things went and how so many things went left unsaid, unfinished. Idk if I just move on with life or attempt to rekindle that. Idek if that‚Äôs something he‚Äôs interested in. Idk, give me your honesty and perhaps what you would do. I was a complete shit head a year ago because of so many things going on in my life but I‚Äôve always regretted that and I‚Äôve never once regretted anything when it comes to a man üòÖ",1,1759621393.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

1ny959t,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1ny959t/somethings_wrong_with_the_enchanted_forest/,"Something‚Äôs Wrong with the Enchanted Forest ‚Äî Hopkinton, RI","**[1:47 AM EST ‚Äî October 4 2025]**

I‚Äôve gone back and forth on posting this.

Everyone in Rhode Island my age knows about the Enchanted Forest‚Äîthe old amusement park off Route 3 that shut down in the 2000s. Most people just sneak in for photos or TikToks. I did too.

What happened next‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt know how to explain it without sounding like I‚Äôm making it up or losing my mind. I don‚Äôt even know if I‚Äôm writing this to warn anyone or just to see it written down.

If you‚Äôve ever been out there, if you remember the storybook houses or the pond with the tiny bridge‚Äîplease tell me it‚Äôs changed. Please tell me it doesn‚Äôt look the way it did that night.

I‚Äôm going to post everything in order. What we saw, what we heard, how we got out. Maybe getting it out of my head will make it stop.

If you live in Rhode Island, you‚Äôve probably heard of the Enchanted Forest. The old amusement park down near the Connecticut border. They say it‚Äôs gone now. That‚Äôs a lie.

Don‚Äôt go looking for it. Don‚Äôt even try. If you see a faded sign off Route 3, keep driving. If you hear laughter in the woods, don‚Äôt follow it. I swear to God, whatever‚Äôs out there isn‚Äôt just some creepy urban legend. It‚Äôs real. And it‚Äôs been there for a long time.

I don‚Äôt even know where to start.
I guess‚Ä¶ the beginning. Before the screaming. Before the firelight and the masks and that goddamn chanting that‚Äôs still stuck in my head.

It was supposed to be a normal Friday night ‚Äî me, my best friend Tyler, our friend Amanda, and Sophie, the new girl at our school. We weren‚Äôt doing anything special. Just wanted to get out of Cranston for a bit. If you‚Äôve ever lived here, you know the deal: Dunkin‚Äô runs, hanging out in someone‚Äôs basement, driving around aimlessly because there‚Äôs nowhere else to go.

We‚Äôre juniors this year. The kind of age where everything feels like it‚Äôs about to change, but hasn‚Äôt yet. SAT prep, part-time jobs, planning for ‚Äúthe future.‚Äù That night, none of us wanted to think about any of it.

Then Tyler showed us a post.

Earlier that week, a blurry photo had popped up on Reddit. It was taken at night, and most of it was just blackness and tree branches. But in the middle of the frame, there was a faded blue sign poking through the undergrowth. If you squinted, you could make out the words: ‚ÄúEnchanted Forest of Rhode Island.‚Äù The caption was simple: ‚ÄúTaken last week. Still there.‚Äù

Amanda stared at the picture like she‚Äôd seen a ghost.
‚ÄúNo way,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI thought they tore that place down years ago.‚Äù She told us her grandparents used to take her there when she was little. Feeding goats, riding the kiddie Ferris wheel, getting ice cream by the pond. The kind of memories that sound made up when you‚Äôre a kid telling them to your friends.

Tyler grinned like it was the best news he‚Äôd ever heard.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going,‚Äù he said, like it was already decided.

Sophie raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúGoing‚Ä¶ where, exactly? To, like, trespass on some random plot of land in the middle of nowhere?‚Äù

‚ÄúExactly,‚Äù Tyler said. ‚ÄúC‚Äômon, think about it. We could film the whole thing, post it online. Instant legend status. Cranston kids find the last pieces of the Enchanted Forest.‚Äù

I laughed, but there was a knot in my stomach.
Even back then, before any of this, the idea of that place creeped me out. I only went once as a little kid, and the memory is like a dream I can‚Äôt quite shake. Faded colors. Too-bright lights. Laughter echoing off water.

Amanda wasn‚Äôt thrilled about the plan, but she didn‚Äôt want to be left out either. Sophie shrugged and said, ‚ÄúFine, but if we get arrested, you‚Äôre explaining it to my mom.‚Äù Tyler just grinned wider.

That was how most of our nights started. Tyler pushing the limits, Amanda rolling her eyes, Sophie trying to play it cool, and me‚Ä¶ following along, because I didn‚Äôt want to be the one to say no.

Around 9:30, we met up at my house. My parents were out for the night, so we used my place as a base. Sophie sat cross-legged on the couch scrolling through her phone, Amanda nervously checking a flashlight to make sure it worked. Tyler was already filming little clips for TikTok, narrating dramatically about ‚Äúour descent into darkness.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so dramatic,‚Äù Sophie said, laughing.
‚ÄúAnd you love it,‚Äù Tyler shot back.

I packed a backpack with water, a notebook, and extra batteries, because someone had to think ahead. We piled into Tyler‚Äôs car just before 10.

Cranston felt safe as we drove through it, streetlights glowing, kids walking home from football games, the usual Friday night scene. But the farther south we went, the emptier the roads became. Gas stations gave way to stretches of dark forest. The jokes got quieter. The music turned down. It was like crossing some invisible border between our world and something older, wilder, and darker.

‚ÄúThis is so weird,‚Äù Sophie said, staring out the window.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Rhode Island,‚Äù Tyler replied with a smirk. ‚ÄúEverything‚Äôs ten minutes apart and fifty years behind.‚Äù Amanda shivered and hugged her hoodie tighter.

At 10:45, we stopped at a small gas station just outside Hopkinton. The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting everything in sickly yellow. Inside, it smelled like burnt coffee and old wood. The clerk barely looked up as we walked in.

‚ÄúYou kids ain‚Äôt from ‚Äòround here, huh?‚Äù he said, accent flat and clipped in that way people from southern Rhode Island talk.

‚ÄúJust passing through,‚Äù Tyler said casually.

The clerk narrowed his eyes. ‚ÄúWatch yourselves. Some places out here ain‚Äôt meant to be found.‚Äù He rang us up, staring just a little too long at me as he handed back the change. ‚ÄúAnd if you see any lights out there,‚Äù he added, voice low. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go toward ‚Äôem.‚Äù

We walked out in silence. Then Tyler snorted and shook his head.
‚ÄúYou believe that fuckin‚Äô swamp yankee?‚Äù he said with a laugh.

Sophie blinked. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs a swamp yankee?‚Äù
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about it,‚Äù Amanda muttered, rolling her eyes.
Tyler grinned. ‚ÄúJust a Rhode Island thing. Basically anyone who lives out here and hates fun.‚Äù

The rest of the drive was quiet. When we finally turned off Route 3, the old access road was barely visible through the trees. Tyler drove slowly, tires crunching over cracked pavement.

Then, through the overgrowth, we saw it:
A faded blue sign, half-swallowed by vines.
ENCHANTED FOREST OF RHODE ISLAND.

It looked dead. Forgotten. But somehow, it felt like it was waiting for us.

We parked at the edge of what used to be the main lot. The pavement was cracked and buckled, split open by tree roots and weeds that had claimed the space back for the forest. Tyler killed the headlights, plunging everything into darkness. For a second, none of us spoke.

Then Sophie whispered, ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ this is it?‚Äù Amanda didn‚Äôt answer. She just stared through the windshield, her face pale and unreadable.

We got out of the car, our footsteps crunching on broken asphalt. The night was colder here, sharper somehow. You couldn‚Äôt see the stars. The trees loomed so tall and close together they seemed to swallow the sky.

I turned on my flashlight. The beam cut through the dark in a thin, shaky line. The sign was just ahead of us now, half-hidden by vines and brambles. ENCHANTED FOREST OF RHODE ISLAND, the paint flaking and faded, the letters barely legible.

Sophie snapped a photo with her phone, the flash briefly illuminating the twisted branches behind it. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs going on Instagram,‚Äù she said with a nervous laugh.

‚ÄúOkay, real talk,‚Äù Amanda said finally. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt‚Ä¶ actually go in, right? We just, like, check it out from here?‚Äù

Tyler grinned, already walking past her toward a rusted metal gate that hung lopsided on one hinge. ‚ÄúAmanda, Amanda, Amanda,‚Äù he said, shaking his head dramatically. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt drive forty-five minutes out into the woods just to take a selfie by the sign. We‚Äôre going in.‚Äù

Amanda groaned but followed, muttering, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre all going to end up on the news.‚Äù Sophie and I trailed behind. She bumped my shoulder lightly. ‚ÄúYour friends are insane,‚Äù she whispered. ‚ÄúYou have no idea,‚Äù I said, but I couldn‚Äôt help smiling.

Beyond the gate, the park‚Äôs entrance opened up like a mouth. There were broken benches, rusted trash cans, toppled light posts ‚Äî all swallowed by creeping vines and wet leaves. In the distance, I could just barely make out the outline of an old ticket booth. The glass was long gone, leaving jagged metal teeth.

Amanda stopped dead, shining her flashlight across the ruins.
‚ÄúI remember this,‚Äù she said softly. ‚ÄúMy grandpa would always get us kettle corn before we went inside.‚Äù She turned slowly, taking it all in. ‚ÄúIt was the only place we went where the air smelled like sugar and paint.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt say anything, but I knew exactly what she meant. As we moved deeper in, I caught a faint trace of it myself ‚Äî something sweet and artificial clinging to the cold October air. Like childhood trying to cover up rot.

Tyler was in full tour-guide mode now, filming everything. ‚ÄúAnd here,‚Äù he announced dramatically, panning his phone across a heap of splintered wood, ‚Äúwe have the once-famous Enchanted Forest carousel. Watch your step, folks ‚Äî tetanus is free with every ride.‚Äù

Sophie rolled her eyes but smiled. Amanda stayed quiet, hugging herself, her flashlight beam darting nervously from tree to tree.

We passed what was left of a playground, the slides and swings collapsed into heaps of rust and broken plastic. A chipped sign lay facedown in the mud. I flipped it over with my foot. Faded cartoon animals stared back at me, their painted smiles cracked and warped.

Sophie crouched down beside me. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs‚Ä¶ actually really sad,‚Äù she said quietly. I nodded. Tyler didn‚Äôt stop filming.

The deeper we went, the more wrong everything felt. The night seemed too quiet. Even the sounds of crickets and wind faded until there was nothing but our footsteps and breathing. I told myself it was just the remoteness, but my skin crawled all the same.

Amanda stopped suddenly, holding out a hand. ‚ÄúWait,‚Äù she whispered.

A few yards ahead, on the side of a half-collapsed food stand, were three words. Yet these three simple words sent an immediate crushing chill down my spine.

YOU ARE LOVED.

The letters were painted in thick white strokes that looked fresh.

‚ÄúPlease tell me that‚Äôs old,‚Äù Sophie said. No one answered.

I crouched, shining my flashlight on the mud beneath the stand. There were footprints. Too large to belong to any of us. The edges were still wet.

‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù Amanda said, voice trembling, ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôve seen enough. Let‚Äôs go.‚Äù

Tyler scoffed. ‚ÄúRelax. It‚Äôs probably just other explorers. Like us.‚Äù
‚ÄúOther explorers don‚Äôt write that on walls,‚Äù Amanda shot back.
Sophie swallowed hard. ‚ÄúGuys‚Ä¶ do you hear that?‚Äù

We froze, straining to listen. At first, there was only silence. Then, faintly ‚Äî almost too faint to be real, came the sound of laughter.

That sound ‚Äî the laughter ‚Äî was faint, but once I heard it, I couldn‚Äôt un-hear it. It didn‚Äôt sound like kids messing around. It didn‚Äôt even sound fully human. Too high-pitched, too warped, like someone trying to remember what laughter was supposed to sound like and getting it wrong.

‚ÄúNope,‚Äù Amanda whispered. ‚ÄúAbsolutely not. We‚Äôre leaving. Now.‚Äù

Tyler turned slowly, shining his flashlight toward the trees. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs probably just some other people,‚Äù he said, though his voice wavered for the first time all night.

Sophie clutched my arm. ‚ÄúIf there are other people out here‚Ä¶ why didn‚Äôt they call out to us? Why just‚Ä¶ laugh?‚Äù

No one had an answer.

We started walking back toward the way we came ‚Äî or at least, I thought we were. The problem was, the paths all looked the same. Piles of wet leaves, cracked pavement, half-collapsed fences. Even the trees felt wrong, like they‚Äôd shifted positions when we weren‚Äôt looking.

Tyler pulled up a GPS app on his phone. The little blue dot just spun in place. ‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs great,‚Äù Amanda muttered. ‚ÄúNo service.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre fine,‚Äù Tyler said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll just retrace our steps.‚Äù
Amanda shot him a glare. ‚ÄúDo you remember which way we came?‚Äù
Tyler opened his mouth, then closed it again. That told me everything I needed to know.

We walked in silence for a while, flashlights darting nervously across the undergrowth. The deeper we went, the more the smell hit me again ‚Äî that sickly mix of sugar and paint Amanda had mentioned earlier. Only now, it was stronger. Fresh. Like someone had just been here, like the park wasn‚Äôt abandoned at all.

‚ÄúColin.‚Äù Sophie‚Äôs voice was so quiet I almost didn‚Äôt hear her. I turned to see her pointing at a tree just off the path. Hanging from a low branch was a mask. It was crudely carved from wood, the features twisted and uneven. Strips of faded blue cloth hung from the sides like streamers.

‚ÄúWhat the fuck,‚Äù Amanda whispered.
Tyler stepped closer, raising his phone to film it. ‚ÄúDude, that‚Äôs‚Äî‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt finish his sentence. Because just beyond the tree, something moved. A shadow. Quick, silent, there and gone again.

‚ÄúBack up,‚Äù I hissed.
Sophie stumbled, nearly dropping her flashlight.
Tyler cursed under his breath, his phone shaking as he tried to keep filming.
Amanda grabbed my sleeve. ‚ÄúColin, there‚Äôs someone out there.‚Äù

The laughter came again. Louder this time. Closer.

‚ÄúRun,‚Äù I said.

We didn‚Äôt think, we just ran ‚Äî crashing through undergrowth, breath tearing in our throats. Branches clawed at my arms and face, snagging my hoodie. I didn‚Äôt dare look back. All I could hear was Tyler swearing, Amanda‚Äôs panicked breathing, Sophie‚Äôs sobs ‚Äî and that awful, broken laughter echoing from behind us.

We burst into a clearing and skidded to a stop. For a split second, I thought we‚Äôd made it back to the parking lot. But no. This wasn‚Äôt the lot. This was‚Ä¶ wrong.

In the center of the clearing stood a partially intact storybook house, like something out of a fairy tale. Its red paint was peeling, the little bell tower at the top cracked and leaning. Unlike everything else we‚Äôd seen, this building looked‚Ä¶ cared for. Maintained.

Amanda let out a shaky breath. ‚ÄúThis‚Ä¶ this shouldn‚Äôt be standing.‚Äù

Then we saw it: a faint light flickering in the window. Orange and unsteady. Like a torch.

Sophie‚Äôs hand clamped around mine.
Tyler whispered, ‚ÄúOh my God.‚Äù
Amanda didn‚Äôt speak. She just started crying quietly.

And then, from somewhere beyond that house, we heard it: a single, low voice, humming an old, lilting tune.

Amanda gasped, clapping her hands over her mouth. ‚ÄúMy grandma used to sing that song to me,‚Äù she whispered.

I don‚Äôt know why, but that was the moment I finally understood: we weren‚Äôt alone out there.

I keep telling myself it was just teenage stupidity.
We were seventeen. We thought we were filming something funny.

But when I replay it in my head, there‚Äôs this one moment before we even reached the fence‚Äîeverything got quiet.

Sometimes I think that‚Äôs when it started.
The quiet.
The listening.

I gave it my best, but she kept finding reasons to doubt me. When does ‚Äòinsecurity‚Äô in a relationship become emotional control?","TLDR: I (36M) dated a woman (31F) for 10 months who constantly made me prove my love. No matter how much effort I put in: planning trips, caring for her, spending all my free time with her, she always found new reasons to doubt me. She‚Äôd blow up over small things (like not planning New Year‚Äôs Eve fast enough, not running Invisalign by her, or calling my parents on a trip), and accuse me of not caring. Even though she could be caring and sweet at times, her insecurity and controlling behavior made the relationship emotionally exhausting. I tried everything to make it work, but she walked away saying our ‚Äúvalues were too different.‚Äù Now I‚Äôm wondering if I was just not enough, or if she was emotionally unstable and manipulative.

It started great. We spent a lot of time together, took trips, made great memories, and I truly believed she was the one. But over time, things started to unravel.

No matter how much love, care, or effort I showed, she often doubted whether she was special to me. We spent time together almost every evening. We live close by so it allowed us to meet whenever. She questioned if I really loved her or if she was just someone I picked from a dating app. I took her on road trips, planned special weekends, made her coffee on weekend mornings (we don't stay together), sent her food when she was stressed and had anxiety attack, and supported her through her day to day issues. But she would still say things like, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt show me off enough to others‚Äù or ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt make me feel special.‚Äù

She placed a huge importance on external validation. For example, she wanted me to meet her friends whenever they were around on short notice on their schedule, and post pictures of us on IG even though she knew I didn't use the app and I was a private person. She mentioned that her ex didn't have an account either but he made one just to post pictures of her. Even though I met a few of her friends (4 of them) and always told her I was open to meeting more, she felt it wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúorganic enough‚Äù and used that as proof that I didn‚Äôt care.

Sometimes, small differences would spiral into big fights. Once, she got angry because I called my parents during a trip when we relaxing, saying I should have focused only on her. Another time, she got upset because I didn‚Äôt eat dinner with her when I wasn‚Äôt hungry even though I gave her company and walked with her to get the food. She said I should have ‚Äúmade an exception.‚Äù She also got mad when I bought Invisalign without consulting her first, saying it was a ‚Äúlife-altering decision‚Äù that I should have run by her. Made me cancel it through my dentist.

The hardest part was that she often made me feel like I had to prove my love by constantly adjusting myself, apologizing, or making her feel secure. When I calmly tried to explain how her reactions hurt me, she would say I was ‚Äúholding resentment.‚Äù

A few examples of how things turned emotionally abusive:

New Year‚Äôs Eve: She almost broke up with me because I didn‚Äôt have a concrete plan yet until 6 in the evening. It was my first NYE in LA, and I was still figuring out what to do. I ended up taking her to a beautiful spot overlooking the city for fireworks, but she still said it showed I ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt care enough.‚Äù We had been together only for a month by this time.

NYC Trip: We were supposed to spend a fun weekend together at NYC. I had traveled a little earlier than her since she had work. I had dinner plans with old coworkers the evening she arrived, which I told her about in advance. She said it was fine - but when I came back around midnight, she got furious, accused me of not caring about her, and left our Airbnb the next morning without telling me where she was going. She ignored my calls for hours until I practically begged her to talk. It was shocking and confusing.

When her grandma passed away: She was mad at me for not ‚Äújumping out of bed with sense of urgency‚Äù when she got a call early in the morning about her grandmother being hospitalized. I had no idea what was going on and i am not a mornin person. It was 6:45AM on weekend. Even though I consoled her, offered to help, she didn‚Äôt talk to me for a day and accused me of not caring enough.

My parents: When my parents visited me from abroad after two years, things escalated way too much. She said I was ‚Äútoo close‚Äù to them and ‚Äútoo accommodating,‚Äù even though all I did was help them find an Airbnb and book their flights. I used to visit them 3-4 times a week to have dinner and check on them. I would also take them out on one of the weekends for a few hours since they were new to the city. I always made sure to include her in all our plans. My parents always invited her with me to have food with them. They treated her as her own daughter.

Everyday control: She got upset if I ended a phone call first. Once, she even said I should always ‚Äúbe ready‚Äù to meet her friends at any time, without advance notice.

At the same time, she did care for me in some moments. When I had surgery last month, she came to pick me up from the hospital, stayed the weekend at my place, and helped me recover. She‚Äôd cook for me sometimes, buy me small gifts, and write me notes. Those moments made me believe the good side was real and worth fighting for. But every time things got calm and loving, a new wave of anger or accusation would appear out of nowhere.

I truly loved her, cared deeply, and wanted to build something meaningful. But every time things went well, another wave of doubt or insecurity would crash down. We ended things because her reasoning was we had ‚Äúdifferences in values.‚Äù She told me that when she initially met me she felt I was very American in values and after she met my parents and how i was helping them out her perceptions changed. I am honestly angry that she even mentioned this.

I can‚Äôt help but wonder if I did something wrong or if she was emotionally insecure and projecting her doubts onto me. Was this relationship doomed from the start? How do you know when someone‚Äôs love language is actually turning into emotional control?",1,1759621172.0,relationship_advice,8,0.67,False

I‚Äôve been suffering from constant fatigue for the better part of 2 years now. 

TLDR: I‚Äôm always tired and have 0 motivation to exercise, the only thing that motivates me is being successful at work. Not as aggressive and passionate about life as I used to be. How do I fix it? I‚Äôm only 22 I should be in my prime. 


I‚Äôve gotten a blood test about a year ago (worth doing again so I can show results here) but my GP said there was nothing of concern - his theory was ‚Äúlong covid‚Äù. I foolishly got vaxxed (I needed the vax to work as I was in hospitality at the time and couldn‚Äôt afford not to work. It was a gov requirement here in Sydney. Major regret. But that‚Äôs another discussion - side note - I‚Äôm convinced the vax accelerated my genetic disposition to balding). 

Anyway - since then I graduated university, went backpacking around Europe (still had fatigue) and then have been working full time high stress corporate sales job which is in an office 4-5 days per week). I am CONSTANTLY fatigued, can‚Äôt be bothered to do any physical activity and it is a major battle for me to get out of bed. I‚Äôm good at what I do with work but I can‚Äôt be bothered to do anything else. I‚Äôm asleep by 9pm almost every night, and when I do force myself to go out, I‚Äôll be yawning by 7pm and make an excuse to get to bed. I wake up between 6-7am every morning. 

Diet typically consists of eggs, steak, honey, avocado, pastas for dinner and chicken & veggies for lunch.  Skip breakfast on weekends days. Usually have 3-5 coffees per day. Drink red wine 1-2 times per week. Beer maybe once a month. 

Supps: Zinc 50mg per day. D4 + K2: 6000IU‚Äôs per day. 

Only time I didn‚Äôt feel the fatigue was about a month ago I took my first holiday since starting and I spent all day every day at the beach and doing coastal walks. But I was still asleep every night by 9pm. 

I just want to have the drive and aggression I had in university again when I was constantly horny, training twice per day every day, full of ambition. Now I just feel like I‚Äôm plodding along and I only train 2-3 times per week because I know I should.

You walk into your neighborhood restaurant. Same spots on the block. The same families have been in control for decades. Same grip on every dining dollar. This ain‚Äôt by accident.

Family restaurant dynasties control local markets like mob bosses carve up territory. They own the real estate. They know the suppliers. They‚Äôve outlasted every competitor who tried to muscle in. And they‚Äôre not going anywhere.

**The Numbers Tell the Story**

Family businesses account for 87% of all businesses in America¬π. These aren‚Äôt struggling mom-and-pop shops. They contribute 54% to the GDP. The math says that‚Äôs $7.7 trillion annually

Independent restaurants rule the local dining scene. Recent data shows 38% of Americans who dine out frequent independent restaurants most often, even more than other options, including fast food¬≤. Seattle proves this. Out of almost 1,600 restaurants listed on Google Maps, 67% are independently owned¬≥. Only 33% belong to the chains¬≥.

The restaurant industry will hit $1.5 trillion in sales in 2025‚Å¥. Family dynasties capture most of that money through decades of patient empire building. While chains fight for national market share, families carve up neighborhoods block by block.

**How Territory Control Works**

Own the ground, control the supply chain, and outlast everyone else are the three rules restaurant families follow.

Property Ownership

Smart families buy the building they are operating in. They don‚Äôt lease storefronts. When economic pressure kills competitors, family restaurants keep serving because they own the real estate. This advantage compounds over generations.

Seattle shows this pattern clearly. Family restaurants grabbed prime locations decades ago. Downtown, Capitol Hill, Ballard. Chain restaurants struggle because the best spots belong to families who planted flags when your parents were kids.

Long Vendor Relations Help

Family restaurants build vendor relationships that span years. They order and pay consistently. They‚Äôve used the same vendors for years. So, when supply chains tighten, family restaurants benefit from these relationships. New operators wait for their orders.

These relationships create barriers that money alone breaks. A new restaurant owner with capital still faces months of relationship-building. Family restaurants have supplier trust that took generations to earn. Trust translates to better prices, faster delivery, priority service during shortages.

Time Beats Money Every Time

Only 30% of family businesses survive to the second generation‚Åµ. The ones that do become fixtures in the community. They weather the ups and downs of the economy because they have experience with them and plan in decades, not quarters.

Family businesses last longer than non-family competitors‚Å∂. Restaurant families understand local tastes, neighborhood changes, customer patterns in ways that corporate managers who move around every few years never will.

**Market Control Through Generations**

Restaurant families accumulate advantages by being present in the community they serve. They know their suppliers. They hire locally. They adjust menus based on neighborhood feedback. They will survive the bad periods because they have done so before and know how to plan for them.

Families may operate a few different concepts at the same time. One family might run a pizza place, coffee shop, and bar. On the surface, they appear to compete with each other but it‚Äôs really one family-run business. When one location struggles, they shift resources. When opportunities arise, they move fast.

Financial Advantages Stack Up

Family restaurants reinvest profits. They often keep it local. They don‚Äôt send earnings to corporate headquarters in distant states. Profits stay in neighborhoods, funding expansion, renovations, new concepts. This creates wealth that accumulates over decades.

Restaurant profits average 3%-5% for full-service establishments‚Å∑. Family restaurants often achieve higher margins through supplier relationships, property ownership, efficiency that comes from experience. Better profits create better investment capital for expansion.

Local Knowledge Wins Markets

Family operators live and work in the communities they serve. They understand local preferences, seasonal patterns, customer relationships that others miss. This knowledge translates to better menu decisions, better staffing choices, and a style of service that connects with the community.

Chains rely on market research and corporate-borne strategy. Family restaurants rely on daily customer interactions and decades of local experience. Personal knowledge beats corporate data when serving specific communities.

**Consumer Preference Drives Success**

Americans prefer local restaurants over chain restaurants. Surveys say that 38% of diners visit independent restaurants more¬≤. Price isn‚Äôt dictating this. When asked about why they choose local restaurants, quality ingredients and menu diversity rank highest, and low prices rank lowest¬≤.

The pandemic strengthened this. Local restaurant support surged to 37% in 2021 during lockdowns¬≤. It‚Äôs currently at 38%, which shows continued guest loyalty to family-owned restaurants over chains¬≤.

75% of restaurant traffic comes from takeout and delivery‚Å∏. Family restaurants adapted by offering these services while maintaining their character. Chains offer consistency, while family-owned restaurants offer connections to the community.

**The Chain Challenge**

Chain restaurants compete through scale and standardization. They provide familiar experiences across locations. They struggle with community connections that family restaurants build over decades.

Corporations look to acquire and open restaurants that focus on established brands with proven track records‚Åπ. Chains survive through growth and efficiency. Families survive through relationships with the community that chains struggle to replicate.

Fast food chains show different patterns. McDonald‚Äôs controls a huge chunk of the quick-service market‚Å∑. Full-service dining, however, belongs to independent operators who serve and adapt to the community they are in, while chains can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt.

**Seattle‚Äôs Family Control Model**

Seattle demonstrates family restaurant dominance. The city has about 1,600 restaurants with independent businesses controlling 67% of them¬≥. Chain restaurants manage only 33% despite corporate advantages in scale and marketing¬≥.

Coffee culture shows this family strategy working. Seattle has over 750 coffee shops¬≥. Many family restaurant groups also operate a coffee joint, creating different streams of income from the same community. One family might run morning coffee, lunch service, evening dining from different locations on the same block.

Seattle restaurants face pressure as the city‚Äôs economic challenges affect all operators. Family-owned restaurants survive the profit squeeze through property ownership, supplier relationships, efficiency that comes from experience. Chains struggle when margins tighten because they lack these advantages.

**Succession Planning Is The Weak Point**

Family restaurants sometimes face challenges when it comes to succession planning. Only 30% of family businesses get passed on from the first generation to the second generation‚Åµ. Just 12% become controlled by the third generation¬π‚Å∞. Only 3% survive to the fourth generation¬π‚Å∞.

The stats reveal a harsh reality. Most family restaurants die with their founders. The ones that survive master succession planning early. They separate business decisions from family emotions. They document processes. They train the next generations professionally.

Third-generation problems destroy dynasties. Wealthy kids often spend businesses into bankruptcy¬π¬π. Family disputes split up the kingdom. Professional management becomes essential for long-term control. The families that treat restaurants as businesses, not family projects, control markets for generations.

**Breaking the Dynasty Code**

Family restaurant success follows predictable patterns. They control their real estate. Build deep supplier relationships. Hire and train locally. Stay flexible with menus and service. Plan in decades, not quarters. Document processes and train successors.

Smart families resolve conflicts early. They establish clear leadership roles. They plan transitions carefully. They maintain community connections while growing. The ones that master this might end up controlling the local market for decades.

**Your Neighborhood Map**

Look around your neighborhood. Count family names on restaurant signs. Check how long they‚Äôve operated. Notice which suppliers deliver to multiple locations. See the patterns.

Family dynasties control local dining through time, relationships, territory. They offer better food and service because they adapt to the local community. They live in the communities they serve. Chains rotate managers. Families stay put.

The restaurant industry generates $1.5 trillion annually‚Å¥. Employment will reach 15.9 million jobs in 2025‚Å¥. Family restaurants provide stable employment and career advancement within communities. They hire locally and promote from within, creating workforce loyalty that reduces turnover costs.

Your neighborhood dining choices reflect decades of family strategy, local relationships, generational planning. Restaurant dynasties control local markets because they understand what chains miss. Food is personal. Neighborhoods have personalities. Success comes from serving people, not demographics.

Next time you eat out, notice who owns what. See the dynasty maps. Understand the game. The families already know you‚Äôre coming. They‚Äôve been waiting.

1ny8pru,https://www.reddit.com/r/airbnb_hosts/comments/1ny8pru/what_to_prioritize_when_turning_basement_studio/,What to prioritize when turning basement studio into airbnb?,"My fianc√© and I just bought our first home in Washington DC. It has a finished English basement, which has its own separate entrance from the front of the house and is about 500 sq ft with a full bath. It also has a kitchenette, which is just cabinets and a countertop with a sink. It does not currently have a washer/dryer. It has new, generic grey carpeting, and two small, ground-level windows set high in the exterior wall. It is not a bright space. 

We hope to rent this space out on AirBnB as soon as possible to help offset the mortgage, but want to make sure that we make it comfortable and nice, despite being a basement. We are in an excellent location, within ten minutes' walk of public transit,  major attractions, and great restaurants. We therefore expect that our guests would primarily be single travellers and couples travelling for tourism or business.   
  
We are short on cash right now, since we just bought the property, and are trying to figure out what to prioritise spending on vs. what we can consider in a year or two. A few questions:  
  
1. **do guests expect / require a washer/dryer?** It seems that it would cost $6-8k to put one in and add a hookup, and money is tight for us right now. We wouldn't expect long stays in such a small space--should we reconsider? is a washer/dryer particularly helpful with profitability?  
2. **do guests expect / require a full kitchen?** We intend to add a fridge (possibly a mini fridge--still working out the space) and could also add a countertop burner, a microwave, and/or an air fryer. But honestly, I would prefer people aren't cooking. The ventilation wouldn't be great, and there are genuinely excellent restaurants within five minutes, ranging from fast food to Michelin-stars. We'll definitely include a microwave, fridge, and coffee bar, but do we really need more than that?  
3. **for heating and cooling, is a mini-split the best option?**  
4. **How important is outdoor space / a dining area?** We could add a little patio with a bistro table to our front yard, right by the basement entrance, if guests care about that kind of thing.   
5. **Should we replace carpet with LVP?** The basement currently has brand-new, but kind of ugly, low-pile gray carpet. Aesthetically, a walnut LVP would go a long way, but would cost a couple thousand dollars. How hard is carpet to clean and keep smelling good? We won't allow pets.   
6. **Would a bold design or colour deter more people than it attracts?** I want to lean in to a fun design for this space, like colour-drenched burgundy walls and a collected aesthetic to make it feel like a cozy hideaway, not a dingy basement. Most of the airbnbs in our area are basement units like ours. Many do have full kitchens. Almost all are generic, flat white paint with grey floors and grey furniture. They're depressing, in my opinion--but there must be a business reason for them all to look the way that they do. Right?

My friends are wonderful, but they have moved and I‚Äôve realized how much I miss having people close by, having a community.....the kind of friends you can text last minute to grab dinner, go for a walk, or just hang out without needing a plan. I‚Äôm craving a small, close circle of people I can grow with and share life‚Äôs little moments alongside.

Lately I‚Äôve been focusing on slowing down and being more intentional about how I spend my time. I love cozy mornings, wandering through bookstores, finding new food spots, and exploring the city without rushing anywhere. I also love to travel whether it‚Äôs a weekend getaway or a big trip to somewhere new, I‚Äôm happiest when I‚Äôm experiencing places that spark curiosity and connection.

I‚Äôm into anime, podcasts, self-growth, journaling, and lowkey adventures that make life feel meaningful. I really value warmth, humor, and people who can go deep one minute and laugh about something ridiculous the next.

Not looking for a huge group or surface-level connections just genuine, grounded friendships where both people show up, make time, and feel at ease together. If that sounds like you, I‚Äôd love to start with a conversation with you! Even open to grabbing a coffee or going for a walk after chatting online to see if we vibe.

Hello, yesterday I commented on a post by u/ICPsimp and was given access to [caffeine.ai](http://caffeine.ai), the *Self Writing Apps Platform*/vibe coding platform and wanted to do a quick write up of my first impressions if anyones curious

Anyways I went into this the way I assume a lot of you go into these things and did no prior research and forbade myself from reading any official docs until i finished. i wanted to see how long it would take to get something working purely by vibes, and ultimately was pretty impressed

So its a web ui based natural language app maker similar to gemini's canvas/build with gemini. The underlying model seems pretty good, i didnt use it enough to get any particular feel for it. probably no opus 4.1, but, IT ACTUALLY KNOWS ABOUT ITSELF! it drives me crazy when Claude/Gemini/whatever will happily pull medical advice out of their ass, then get coy and redirect me to their support when i ask about a feature in their app. Like come on claude take an educated guess as to how your mobile app works. Caffeine encourages you to use their model, which i enjoy

[Web UI](https://preview.redd.it/ubg2z1z3k6tf1.png?width=2848&format=png&auto=webp&s=73fba633cc402b2c57291a95fdb3c9410c436bf9)

The web UI demonstrates the basic flow: you prompt to the chat, it drafts the spec, writes the code, then deploys it for you to a temp url, which you then iterate on back in the chat. As you can see it took me a few tries to figure out what works best

you cant edit any of the code (i think) so you have to really let the vibes flow. its best to build it piece by piece, and to be explicit, though its pretty good with asking questions vs making assumptions. I made a simple app, a reddit scraper, and took pictures to show you

[My prompt + The Spec it generated](https://preview.redd.it/wundm0z6k6tf1.png?width=2848&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea61bb4b8666a8b439195495322041252414e343)

[The drafts are displayed in-window](https://preview.redd.it/af0tx0z6k6tf1.png?width=2848&format=png&auto=webp&s=319b5de7f095f94c264feb602d796a21c70c61c7)

this is the point where just being able to replace the placeholder id with mine without having to reprompt it wouldve been nice, but not a big deal. i didnt screenshot it but i told it my id, and the login button made ""failed to store auth token"" pop up. So i copy+pasted that:

https://preview.redd.it/qf8lqfqjk6tf1.png?width=2848&format=png&auto=webp&s=d77c1cbcc0aef013ec9e83cabf03a23b672a964a

from this point, i need a redirect url for reddit, so i deploy all the changes live to the url they give me (definitely not best software dev practices but this is r/vibecoding) this messes up the 'draft' workflow since it uses temp urls, but i think thats just the nature of it i had the same issue with gemini canvas/claude imagine. either way ill ease off the pictures, just imagine a lot more of the same but with a blank draft tab and me clicking 'deploy live' in between steps. i got a couple more auth errors i just copy/pasted into the chat, and voila:

[Oh boy](https://preview.redd.it/jcjc743nk6tf1.png?width=2848&format=png&auto=webp&s=57224f81fc5ec27923ac6843cf633d4f334f1cb2)

Pretty fun overall. Ofc not as polished as as gemini canvas or whatever but orders of magnitude cleaner than some early access stuff you see. like i said before yesterday i hadn't heard of them (maybe i've seen posts idk) and stubbornly refused to look anything up, but as you can see got a working app up in a couple of hours with pure natural/conversational language. I didnt come across any major bugs or anything, some quirks here and there but nothing that seriously impacts UX or isnt handled gracefully. But overall i definitely enjoyed it. I also want to note, someone responded to my initial comment to say you really have no idea youre interacting with blockchain/crypto/ICP/whatever under the hood, and for this app i have to admit they were right, I learned nothing about those things to make this

Ofc this app has no backend which is (presumably) where ICP comes in, but im gonna have to do some research (i know, i know) into that because i am intrigued

feel free to check out the app yourself: https://reddit-scrape-zu3.caffeine.(xyz) (reddit doesnt like xyz domains)d and thanks again u/ICPsimp im glad i got the chance to try this out

Yesterday I finished picking up and felt like sitting down with the cat and coffee and asked my littlest what I should watch and his reply was ‚ÄúYour friend, watch your friend. You like him.‚Äù 
I was puzzled for a moment and asked him who my friend was. 
‚ÄúOn the Tv, you watch him.‚Äù 
I asked him if he was talking about Jesus and he said ‚ÄúYeah! Your friend! We like him.‚Äù

Very sweetly I told her my leather appointment through the website won‚Äôt go through as the page ends in error. She heard me and said there is no way she can help and that I need to be on local network. She then looked away. I stood there just trying to show her how I genuinely have been trying. She just turned around and said ‚Äú let me try giving you an appointment. I may have one‚Äù I was over the moon. I couldn‚Äôt believe my luck. The whole schbang of waiting for 20 minutes then my SA came walked me upstairs. Not to a room but just to a small corner with two chairs and offered me coffee. She then asked what I wanted. Told her my choices and she said anything outside of the birkin and Kelly family and I said no. This is what I really would love. 
She went for 20 minutes and I was just so excited and couldn‚Äôt wait for her to come with the box. She comes empty handed and said I‚Äôm so sorry. What you asked for is not available as no stock. It‚Äôs all gone for the show and it‚Äôs also late evening. I was so disappointed and said thank you and she said she appreciated the fact that I was sure what I wanted and not anything else. 
Next day k went int eh afternoon and tried asking again. Nope! The lady remembers me and said she got to give others a chance so no way I can get an appointment. I looked around and went to someone else and told her that I‚Äôve been trying for an appointment. She made me wait. The same lady who had said no to me came and said someone will come shortly and smiled. Same thing. Walked upstairs and made to wait. Took my preferences and gone another 20. Came back with no stock fashion week etc etc. and asked if I need anything else. I said no. Would really love B or K. No madam. Sorry. 
I walked away sadly. Regretting that I should have asked for another bag but I honestly couldn‚Äôt even think by the end BUT the fact that I got to experience this two days in a row says something. 
Now- big question is should I go again to FSH or go to sevres and then go to FSH after a days break and how should I handle this situation. Should I ask for another bag and pick a few things that i want or just forget about it.

My soon to be mother in law (we‚Äôll call her Gayle) lives with us. I want to make that part very clear before I get into the rest of the story. She lives with us in our home not the other way around. She doesn‚Äôt work, doesn‚Äôt pay a single bill in the house and her only contribution is her food stamp card. We (my fianc√© and I ) pay for everything rent, bills, even her daily materials such as body wash, shampoo etc.

When I met my fianc√© 8 years ago he had just gotten his mom out of a tough situation. She was living in the middle of no where married to a man that was a bad influence that included a lot of drug use. When he brought her back he helped her through everything. The withdrawals, medical assistance, food stamps etc. 

I never had an issue with her the first few years up until 2021 when she would excessively do laundry doing micro loads and by micro I mean under 10 pieces of laundry that were small such as socks, underwear, and wash cloths. One month when I went to go pay the water bill it was almost at $300! I‚Äôve never had to pay more than $40 for my water bill. Since then we lock the laundry room and if she wants to use it we have to unlock it and one of us has to be home to monitor what she‚Äôs washing. 

That‚Äôs just the beginning. After that she started to cook in huge amounts and also cook everything in either one day or in a span of a week after going grocery shopping that is supposed to last us a month. We constantly tell her to only cook for herself because my fianc√© and I aren‚Äôt home majority of the time due to work and end up either eating out or cooking something quick for ourselves. 

Since the food comes from her food stamp card I didn‚Äôt really care until we had to come out of pocket to replace anything. Example, she‚Äôs the only one that drinks regular milk and uses it for her coffee and will go through the gallon within a week and then asks if we can pick up milk. It got so bad to a point that my fianc√© told her that if she runs out of something that she bought with her stamp card that we would not be replacing it and that she needs to cook only for herself and make the groceries last through the month. 

I would also like to add that she‚Äôs diabetic and also has had a gastric bypass surgery so she doesn‚Äôt eat a lot, she just wants to cook to cook but she also tells my fianc√© that the voices are telling her to do things. She cooks and bakes an excessive amount of things that no one is going to eat and she ends up throwing it away or throwing away food that is perfectly fine because the voices told her to do so. One year she almost threw out a whole turkey the day before thanksgiving because the voices told her to do it. 

I started to leave a lot of food that I buy upstairs in our mini fridge because she has either thrown it away or cooked it without asking and if she does ask and you say no she‚Äôll do it anyway. 

Once this started happening I‚Äôve suggested to him for her to get checked for schizophrenia or other things such as Alzheimer‚Äôs and dementia. My dad had Alzheimer‚Äôs and dementia and it started around the same age as his mom(50‚Äôs) I‚Äôve noticed some things that were similar. She hasn‚Äôt went to go get checked and sometimes he says it‚Äôs all a result from the drugs she took. To me that sounds like an even more reason to get checked and get the proper help she needs especially since she has free healthcare. 

I‚Äôm going to quickly point out a few major things that has really gotten me to the point of not wanting her to live with us. 
1. We had a roommate that was pregnant and while we were at work the roommate and Gayle argued about some pantry space that escalated to Gayle pushing her and then getting arrested. We both had to leave work and to figure things out. This made me really think about what kind of person she was.
2. She had called a couple the N word infront of their kids who were all under 10 years old. That pissed me off and really changed my entire outlook of her because not only that she said it to them infront of their kids but I‚Äôm half black and for kids to experience racism that young shocked me.

Other things are like the dirty mop bucket being in the house when it should be outside because it smells, or her making plates of food and leaving them on the table for people who aren‚Äôt home(us), leaving the trashcan in the front of the house when it needs to be on the side or backyard or putting it out days early(we live in a housing community with an HOA) and entering our room without knocking or if we weren‚Äôt home(we‚Äôve put a lock on our door now).

Since then it‚Äôs been a lot of her doing things her way even though we tell her what she can and can not do. Most days she just lays in bed and either sleeps or stares off into space. 
I‚Äôm currently pregnant and found out a week ago. My fianc√© and I are over the moon happy because this is something we‚Äôve wanted for a long time. 

This morning I heard gayle come up stairs into our loft area and leave some leftover food she made last night ( as of this two years ago I don‚Äôt eat her food anymore because I discovered that she doesn‚Äôt wash her hands after using the restroom) and a box of croissants my mom had given me and that I left on the table down stairs and then said ‚Äúhere‚Äôs your bread and chicken, I better not here any bitching.‚Äù That came out of no where and I told my fianc√© about it. He said that he would talk to her but I want to have a more serious conversation with him. I‚Äôve gotten into it with her a few times along with my fianc√© and at first she‚Äôll yell back but then gets quiet and says nothing then continues to do what she does.

I don‚Äôt feel comfortable with her living in the house while I‚Äôm pregnant or to even be around the baby arrives. We haven‚Äôt told her that I‚Äôm pregnant and honestly I don‚Äôt know what her reaction will be. What I‚Äôm hoping for is that when we tell her she‚Äôll want to do better but I highly doubt it and feel like she‚Äôll just continue to do what she‚Äôs doing. 

No one else in his family can or wants to take care of her. They either don‚Äôt have the space or had tried to and ran into the same issues and don‚Äôt want her there. Since she doesn‚Äôt work and doesn‚Äôt have any money she has no where else to go and only has us to care for her. I‚Äôm really fed up with her and I know that she also needs help but she refuses to help herself or even have motivation to better her life. 
I don‚Äôt know what to do and I‚Äôm tired of this constant cycle with her.

# 5. Do we really have to protect the bad guys?

The stimulant dissolved under Nathan‚Äôs tongue. He was approaching his limit before his mind would be affected by the carefully balanced drugs in the thin wafer, but he couldn‚Äôt sleep now. Not now that he knew. The official and the unofficial version of the Aurealian ‚Äì Deathsworn conflict that he‚Äôd been taught were both fabrications.

¬†The fact that he had spent his life believing lies about the only two non-earth origin sapients known to exist, and the sources of their conflict, filled him with rage. But at the same time, he understood why the deception was necessary. Why the UEOSC lied about what it had been told by the belligerents, and about what it knew from other methods.

This war between aliens was an existential crisis for the UEOSC. Yosca was not a sovereign government. It was an organization dedicated to peace and the preservation of life, but it passed no laws, nor did it enforce them. That was the role of its allied military forces, of which the ESF was just one of many.

¬†That the UEOSC possessed a weapon like the Theseus was pushing the boarders of several interstellar treaties, which Yosca itself had brokered. It‚Äôs modular nature was not only a feature of redundancy, it was a method of skirting several key provisions which had been put in place to limit the council‚Äôs power by classifying each module as a separate vessel.

Which, to be fair, they technically were.

""How are you feeling?"" Katherine asked him, showing actual emotional concern for him for once. It wasn‚Äôt that she was typically unfriendly. She was just so professional to the point where she came off as an ice queen most of the time.

""It‚Äôs a lot to take in. I get why I wasn‚Äôt ‚Äì why nobody knows the truth.""

""Oh, people know. The right people,"" she answered. ""Representatives of all of the UEOSC‚Äôs military alliances have been briefed in full.""

¬†""Then why the fuck! Why is nobody doing anything about it? It‚Äôs easy to just fucking say ‚Äòthey‚Äôre not Earth origin so our hands are tied,‚Äô but if the people knew half of the shit you just told me there would be violence in the streets. People would be lynching polit--""

¬†""That‚Äôs exactly why this knowledge is so tightly controlled, and why nobody is doing anything about it,"" Katherine answered gently. She reached out to grip his hand in a surprisingly human gesture. She was actually in the room with him this time, she had jumped over to his habitation module to read him in personally. ""Try to predict the consequences of what you just said in terms of lives lost. Human lives, Aurealian lives, and Jurassian lives. Then remember the UEOSC‚Äôs express purpose for existing.""

Nathan suppressed his knee jerk reaction and actually followed the various chains of logic in his head. Despite the fact that his genome was largely unmodified, he was fairly intelligent. The brainjack helped him with numbers when he needed it, but for logic and moral questions, he relied entirely on his upbringing.

¬†""People would lynch their politicians if they refused to act,"" he said after a moment. ""Fuck. Half of the colonies out there are already powder kegs ready to explode as they try to stride the balance between human rights and the rights of other sapients. The protests to get their governments and military forces to help the Aurealians would turn into riots, and people ‚Äì people of all species ‚Äì would die in the violence. Fuck, the death toll would be terrible if the more obstinate and oppressive governments dragged their heels.""

""That‚Äôs part of it,"" Katherine agreed.

¬†""And almost all of the military forces have signed a non-aggression treaty,"" Nathan realized. ""They‚Äôre authorized to deal with piracy and criminal actions only. But the Jurassians aren‚Äôt human, according to their laws and customs they‚Äôre doing nothing wrong. If one force attacks them, they can approach all of the rest of them and claim that their rights were violated. Fuck, I‚Äôll bet the legal web of treaties is so damned convoluted that it would take decades of legal work to figure out a justification not to defend the Jurassians with all available force, including against the Aurealians.""

¬†""That‚Äôs another part. Every interstellar treaty would have to be rewritten. The truth is that we‚Äôve already started the process of doing exactly that, but you don‚Äôt need the details. Most of the treaties covered a first contact situation, but none of them were prepared for two alien sapients engaged in a war of extinction,"" Kathy informed him. ""A host of aliens hostile to human life? We were prepared for that. Aliens which outclassed us technologically? We‚Äôd thought of that too. But this particular situation landed in a legal blind spot. Our best course of option is to invite both belligerents into the UEOSC and mediate a peaceful solution, but the Jurassians won‚Äôt agree to a ceasefire, and the Aurealians can‚Äôt. The most aide we can legally provide either side is humanitarian efforts, and the protection of significant population centers.""

¬†""And Horthus Prime is a significant population center, which means we‚Äôre legally required to protect it. Fuck! Do we really have to protect the bad guys?""

""We have to protect Horthus Secondary too,"" she said sadly. ""Although that protection extends only to weapons of mass destruction which will inflict significant casualties to non-combat personnel. We‚Äôre not obligated to defend military installations. Hell, the Aurealians can mass drive their cities from orbit provided they give the civilians sufficient time to evacuate and prepare.""

¬†""The fucking Horthians are eating people down their, and you‚Äôre telling me that we are legally obligated to protect them because they don‚Äôt see why such actions are morally reprehensible?"" Nathan exploded.

¬†""That is not what I said, Nathan. I said that we cannot let the Aurealian fleet target the Horthian civilian population. That is the limit of our legal obligation. And there are other factors which you have not considered. You still haven‚Äôt figured out the Theseus‚Äôs true mission. Take a moment to compose yourself and think about what I‚Äôve told you. You‚Äôre tired and overwhelmed. Jon told you that this mission is morally just, and I stand by that statement with every fiber of my being. Jon has been waiting for this opportunity for decades. History will either remember us as disavowed criminals, or heroes responsible for bringing the longest and deadliest war known to human history to an end.""

""Fuck!"" Nathan exclaimed, but he didn‚Äôt ask any follow up questions, not yet. Instead he went into the mess, where he poured himself a cup of coffee. The stimulant he‚Äôd taken earlier contained some caffeine, but the blend of chemicals meant that there wasn‚Äôt very much, and a cup of joe felt like a good idea to calm his mind.

¬†""I‚Äôm just a fucking kid,"" he whispered to himself. ""The old man‚Äôs talking about changing history, setting precedent that might affect all of humanity and its allies, present and future. And He‚Äôs asking a fucking nineteen year old kid who washed out of the ESF because he has a fucking phobia of dying in stasis to help him. Fuck, I just came along to get a ride in a cool fucking spaceship. I am so far out of my depth here that I‚Äôll have to worry about explosive decompression if I even try to swim to the surface.""

The coffee helped. It was good coffee. Not grown on earth, but one of the many garden worlds that exported vast amounts of food to other colonies struggling to reach self-sustainability. It was better than the coffee he remembered drinking on earth, before he‚Äôd abandoned his childhood home to explore the stars. Was that because the coffee was better? Or maybe his father just didn‚Äôt know how to brew a good cup? Or could it just be because he‚Äôd applied for emancipation at age fourteen and never looked back ‚Äì except to send messages to his mother ‚Äì and his tastes had changed in the last five years.

¬†Thinking of home, thinking of his mother, he wished he could ask her advice. She saw things in terms of her religion, true, but she explored secular morality with even more vigor. Reconciling what she saw as ‚ÄòGod‚Äôs law‚Äô with modern philosophy and morality was a passion of hers that Nathan hadn‚Äôt really understood when he was younger. He still didn‚Äôt, not really, but that was because he didn‚Äôt believe like she did. Few people did outside of the commune that Nathan had been born into, and those like it scattered throughout UEOSC space.

¬†It was one of the reasons he had left. The ESF had been his ticket off of Earth. Then the Theseus had been his ticket into Yosca ‚Äì dammit. He had been so proud when he had sent that message back to his mother. They may believe very different things, but one of the things they agreed upon was their opinion of the UEOSC and its raison d‚Äôetre. The Theseus had left before she‚Äôd been able to send a reply, but he knew that she would be proud of him. She had disapproved of his joining the ESF to be a foot soldier, but a diplomat of the UEOSC? He had thought at the time that his role was more of that of a spy than a diplomat, but he had carefully phrased his way around that. She could always tell when he was lying, but she would understand if he had to bend the truth. And besides, weren‚Äôt most diplomats just spies that announced their movements?

¬†What would she think of all of this? He could really use her advice right now. He‚Äôd even be willing to pray with her just to get her opinion.

¬†Either the coffee or thinking of home, and his mother, worked to clear his head. Refilling his mug, and filling one for his companion, he returned to sit at the small table in the dining area. Reserved for officers, a holoemitter was built into the top of it. After the things he had seen there, Nathan would never be able to eat at that table again. Katherine accepted her mug from him, but sensed that he wasn‚Äôt ready to speak again yet and respected his wishes.

""Who built the cloning facilities?"" he asked after more than ten minutes of silence. ""Cloning doesn‚Äôt seem like Jurassian tech. The way they‚Äôre using it might be right in line with their worldview, but the tech itself just doesn‚Äôt mesh with what we know about their abilities. Their medicine is crap. How can they have advanced cloning facilities and shitty first aid at the same time?""

¬†""We believe that Horthus Prime, and the other worlds we‚Äôve identified with similar facilities, were originally Aurealian worlds,"" Katherine answered. ""It makes sense when you think of them as methods of increasing their population following initial colonization. Aurealians have three sexes, as you know. A female, and two ‚Ä¶ well, they‚Äôre not exactly both males, but they both contribute genetic information to the child that then gestates in the female, who also contributes equal genetic information. That‚Äôs fairly normal for the fauna of their worlds as well, although their plant equivalents use a completely different method of sexual reproduction. But for Aurealians, the female is the bottle neck in establishing a self-sustaining population capable of reproducing without the intervention of technology. All of the Aurealians we‚Äôve identified being produced by the facilities are female. All of them.""

""Makes sense, yeah. Finish the terraforming, xenoforming, whatever you call it, then clone up a bunch of first generation colonists. Must be nice to be in a bachelor‚Äôs paradise like that,"" Nathan chuckled.

¬†""Actually, we‚Äôre fairly certain that the entire process was automated. The cloning facilities generated the first generation of colonists, yes. Then they would be impregnated with preserved genetic information to establish the second generation. These worlds? They‚Äôre old. Tens of thousands of years old, and so are the facilities. It‚Äôs amazing that they still work. The Theseus only has an expected operational life of two centuries. Yeah, we can push it beyond that, but the Aurora drive, PMT systems, and other vital tech will be outside of their shelf life. Two hundred years is the point where we expect it‚Äôll be safer to dismantle and recycle it and build a new one than to continue to operate it.""

""So either the Jurassians are maintaining, or the ancient Aurealians really built their shit to last,"" Nathan guessed.

""Basically, yeah,"" she agreed.

They both paused to sip their coffees. They both took it black and unsweetened.

¬†""So, the timeline of the war as we‚Äôve figured it out is as follows: the ancient Aurealians sent out a bunch of automated colony ships, which xenoformed worlds throughout the conflict zone tens of thousands of years ago. They do their thing for a while, but then the Jurassians show up and decide that Aurealians are absolutely delicious. The fact that they‚Äôre intelligent ‚Äì I mean, they BUILT WORLDS by remote control for fucks sake ‚Äì is irrelevant to their sense of morality. For some reason their technology is almost perfectly on par, but Aurealians suck at thinking like warriors, so their weapons systems lag behind while the rest of their engineering is superior to the Jurassians, putting them more or less in a stalemate. At some point the Jurassians chase the Aurealians off of a bunch of the worlds they‚Äôd colonized and, what‚Äôs far worse, they figured out how to operate the facilities used to populate the colony in the first place.""

¬†""That‚Äôs a fairly accurate summary, but it‚Äôs missing a few details,"" Katherine said. ""Nathan, the Jurassians didn‚Äôt come out of nowhere. We‚Äôve located their home world. That‚Äôs exactly why we‚Äôre calling them the Jurassians. The scientists studying it say that the flora is extremely reminiscent of that of the Jurassic era on earth. The fauna differs, but there are multiple families of animals which resemble the Jurassians‚Äô basic appearance and physiology. Multi-pigmented semipermeable skin like an amphibian from earth, skeletal structure similar to avians or reptiles, although very few things on their world are capable of flight, and those are insect equivalents. The Jurassians are everywhere, an estimated population of three point six billion, which is pretty impressive considering their dietary restrictions and their technology level.""

""The Deathsworn have FTL. Yeah, it‚Äôs just skip drives, but if they can figure that out then--""

¬†""Nathan, you don‚Äôt understand. The heavy-world Jurassians are late iron age at best. And the eggheads are fairly certain that they could never develop a method of space travel without outside intervention.""

Nathan jerked in surprise, almost spilling his coffee. ""But they did. They have an entire armada. Maybe they just let their home world return to nature, like we‚Äôre doing with Earth.""

¬†""Did they? Do they? Are they? Or are they just using the advanced technology of another race which they managed to figure out how to operate? Nathan, Ulessa ‚Äì That‚Äôs the local‚Äôs word for their planet, at least in the predominate language ‚Äì Ulessa is a Super Earth. One point nine times earth gravity. The rockets humans used during the early space exploration might not have even gotten off the ground, let alone achieved escape velocity. We have PMT, so orbit-to-surface is trivial when we already have ships in orbit. But we‚Äôre restricted to land drones and ultra-light aerial surveilance drones. We‚Äôre pretty certain that air travel will never be a thing on Ulessa unless we introduce it to them ourselves, but so far we‚Äôre in observation mode only. The Jurassians on Ulessa, they have no idea about the Deathsworn or the Horthians or any of the atrocities that their cousins are committing throughout the conflict zone. They hide from our aerial drones because they believe it‚Äôs unnatural for things not to touch the ground. More than unnatural, it‚Äôs a sign of the apocalypse. Their world has multiple impact craters, many of which are geologically recent. They‚Äôve been hit before, and they remember it.""

""And we‚Äôre certain that isn‚Äôt why they lost their tech?"" Nathan asked.

¬†""There‚Äôs more,"" Katherine explained. She stared at the dregs of her coffee gone cold, then set the mug aside. Waving her hand, she activated the holoemitter embedded in the table. With a few swipes and motions, she brought up the information she wanted.

""The Jurassians are more or less like us genetically. DNA based, although their genetic alphabet is different. Sexual reproduction with two sexes, two pairs of twenty eight chromosomes. We have hundreds of Deathsworn genetic profiles from the action on the Elizabeth, and it wasn‚Äôt hard to gather a comparative number of samples from the Ulessians.""

¬†As she spoke, the hologram showed what he vaguely representative of the chromosomes in question, paired up and arranged by size. As her explanation progressed, the representation suddenly cloned itself, with a label on top indicating ‚ÄòUlessian‚Äô and the one beneath indicating ‚ÄòJurassian.‚Äô Nathan had no trouble following along with her, the differences between uplifts and native species were generally explained along the same terms.

""The Jurassians, the spaceborn species, is clearly related to the native Ulessians,"" she explained. ""Yet the eggheads say that while the Ulessians evolved naturally, the Jurassians had the blue areas of genetic information added to their DNA.""

About ten percent of the Jurassian DNA lit up in little bands of various thickness.

""At the same time, the Ulessians possess a significant amount of DNA material which the Jurassians lack, indicated in red,"" she continued.

Almost thirty percent of the Ulessian chromosomes lit up, again in bands of various thickness.

¬†""It‚Äôs mostly junk or detrimental DNA that‚Äôs missing, but there‚Äôs also a number of proteins and enzymes which are replaced by the blue insertions. Except they‚Äôre not the same. How‚Äôs your biochemistry?""

""I washed out of the Marines, ma‚Äôam,"" he reminded her. ""I joined when I was seventeen after three years of cramming to meet the basic education requirements. Before that I was in an anachronistic Christian commune. Some of my friends growing up would curse you out just for trying to explain genetics to me.""

¬†""Right. Sorry. Well, excluding the red DNA that‚Äôs useless or detrimental, all of the red DNA that was replaced with blue versions serve basically the same function, but with different proteins, or different chirality, or, well, honestly I don‚Äôt understand it myself. Not well enough to explain it properly, at least But here‚Äôs the thing, Nathan. We‚Äôre pretty certain that those changes were made specifically to allow the Jurassians to eat fauna not native to Ulessa. In fact, we‚Äôre pretty certain that most of the Jurassian diet would be poisonous to an unmodified Ulessian. Without those modifications, a Jurassian could not eat Aurealian flesh and survive.""

Nathan allowed the information to sink into him for a few moments before exhaling a punctuating ""Fu-uck. And we don‚Äôt think that the Jurassians did it to themselves, do we?""

""We do not,"" Katherine agreed.

""So what do we think? Because I‚Äôm barely keeping up at this point, to be completely honest.""

""There are several competing theories,"" Katherine informed him. ""One is that the modifications to the Jurassians were made by the Aurealians. The technology they would need for such a thing is only a step beyond the cloning facilities that we‚Äôre attributing to their ancestors. The war and resulting migration of their peoples explains why such technology, and even the knowledge that they possessed it, would be lost.""

""So the leading theory, if I‚Äôm understanding you right, is that this entire war, which we have estimated to have cost billions, if not trillions, of lives ‚Ä¶ The Aurealians did it to themselves? Why would they do that? Why would they take an apex preditor, make it able to eat them, and then teach it how to fly their space ships?""

""As I recall, you and Tony are fast friends,"" Katherine pointed out. ""The changes to the Jurassians were changes of metabolism, not intelligence. Tony is a gentle soul, but his increased intellect makes him far more dangerous than any of his man-eater ancestors.""

¬†""Man-eater is a no-no word around Tony,"" Nathan reminded her. ""And he wouldn‚Äôt speak with you for weeks if you even suggested he was related to one, no matter how distantly.""

""Sorry, but I was making a point.""

¬†Nathan could only shrug. He knew what she meant, but it was hard for him to imagine Tony as anything other than his friend, a friend she had just insulted. ""So, the Jurassians are uplifts gone rogue? That‚Äôs what we think?""

¬†""Not exactly."" She sighed and scratched her temple, right about where Nathan‚Äôs brainjack was, except that Katherine‚Äôs brain was all natural. ""The Jurassian and Ulessian culture and social structure is very similar. The Ulessian have Unnamed making up the majority of their population, with Named individuals of importance, and when they go to war they swear an oath mostly equivalent to the Deathsworn. Aside from that, Ulessa is actually quite a bit like iron age earth, with tribes, city-states, and nations of various sized, usually led by an individual of prominence such as Horthus. Travel is severely limited, which explains why the Jurassians have a comparatively monolithic structure that stretches entire star systems while Ulessa is divided against itself like ‚Ä¶ well, like us. Even now, we‚Äôre still split into thousands of different camps. The UEOSC focuses on interstellar relations, but if you actually look at it human politics are exponentially more complicated than that even without getting into inter-species relations.

¬†""But aside from those slight differences in social structure, they show no marked differences in intellect. Vast differences in the available technology, but to be honest, we‚Äôre not much smarter than cavemen either. We just have better education and access to technology they couldn‚Äôt dream of.

¬†""The Aurealians, if it was the Aurealians who modified the Jurassians, did not try to elevate the Ulessians as we tried to elevate our friends and allies from earth. They simply made the Jurassians capable of eating different foods.""

¬†""I still don‚Äôt understand why the Aurealians would build themselves an apex predator that actually eats them,"" Nathan protested.

¬†""We don‚Äôt think that was their intention. Not for the Jurassians to eat the Aurealians themselves. We think they were trying to make them able to survive on the fauna that the Aurealians brought with them from wherever they came from, and at some point the Jurassians realized that they could eat the Aurealians as well, and that evolved into the situation we face now.""

¬†Nathan considered the explanation. ""That still doesn‚Äôt explain why they would do such a thing. Why not just leave the Ulessians alone?""

¬†""We think this is why,"" Katherine explained, interacting with the hologram again. The genetic information vanished, and after swiftly shifting through the directory she brought up an image of a planet. Text at the bottom identified it as Ulessa. It looked surprisingly earth like, unlike most potential colony worlds until the late stage of terraforming. With oceans, vast lakes and river systems, and vast swaths of greenery and occasional deserts, it could be mistaken for earth if you didn‚Äôt pay attention to the twisting shapes of its continents. The image itself didn‚Äôt give a sense of scale, after all.

""Here,"" she said, pointing towards one of the land masses. The hologram zoomed in on one of the landmasses, but remained in an aerial orbit. It took Nathan a moment to understand what he was looking at.

""A crater? Isn‚Äôt that sort of normal for Super Earths? I mean, they have all that gravity -""

""We dated it. It‚Äôs about seven or eight hundred years old, which predates the beginning of the Aurealian ‚Äì Deathsworn war by about a century according to our intel.""

¬†""Oh."" Nathan took a moment to process the information.

""What would early human settlers have done if we‚Äôd found peers out there among the stars? Like us, but different. Intelligent tool users, but technologically primitive. And as soon as we learned that they existed, we realized that they were living on borrowed time, that their Armageddon Clock was ticking down.""

""We would have saved them,"" Nathan said. ""Tried, at least. Whatever we could do, whatever it took.""

""Exactly.""

""That‚Äôs ‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt even process that,"" Nathan said. ""That‚Äôs Shakespearean levels of making Greek tragedy even more tragic, there. And the Ulessians survived the impact, which means that the monsters the Aurealians released upon themselves didn‚Äôt need saving in the first place.""

""Yes.""

""Do they know?""

""We haven‚Äôt asked. Ulessa isn‚Äôt in the charts that we have examined from either Aurealian or Jurassian navigation systems. Whatever the Aurealians tell themselves, however they are coping, it‚Äôs not our place. At least that‚Äôs the leading thoughts on the matter.""

¬†""Fuck,"" Nathan whispered. He was so far past emotional overload and exhaustion at this point that all he could do was try to understand the information as Katherine shared it with him.

""There‚Äôs an alternate theory. One which is both less tragic, and yet more troubling for its larger implications,"" Kathy said after he had been silent for several moments.

""Is it any better than the Aurealians attempting to save a race of doomed sapients only to get ‚Äòet tu, Brutus‚Äôed for centuries?"" he asked

""I‚Äôm not certain. The alternate theory is that a third race of xenosapients released the Jurassians upon the Aurealians. Motivation and intentions unknown and unclear.""

Once again, Nathan required time to process. He looked at his coffee mug, then got up and began to leave the mess hall.

""I‚Äôm going to take a sedative and sleep. If you have any more nukes to drop on me, you can do it when I wake up.""

We fell in love, got married last year, I jumped ship a couple months ago to work an Wayne Enterprises after (gestures broadly at the general news of the last couple months in Metropolis), mostly to be closer to my wife and her son now my stepson (M9).

His birthday is coming up and he wants ‚ÄúBatman‚Äù toys for his birthday. Now for those who don‚Äôt know Batman is for lack of a better term to Gotham what Superman is to Metropolis. Except while Superman (despite my opinions on vigilantes) he has redeeming traits in his kindness and cares for others. Batman is from what I heard from some people a maniac who brutalizes people to get confessions out of them and uses fear as a weapon in a war on crime.

I would have been reluctant to get any kid a nytoy that glorifies crime through vigilantism. I think it encourages antisocial behavior and defiance of positive social norms. But if he had asked for some Superman toy, I would have swallowed my pride. But he looks up to man who is worse than this maniac who used to live in my hometown in Washington (long story). 

This has caused the first real fight between me and the wife. She says I ‚Äúdon‚Äôt get Gotham‚Äù. I think teaching my son to look up to a man who brutalizes the public and scared the Government to do nothing to stop him or his gang is ridiculous. I want my son to look up to doctors, lawyers, soldiers, etc. Not psychopaths who call their brutality justice. I would be fine with getting him a bike, or a NERF gun or even one of those weird Superman toys that are showing up everywhere. But no. He is hellbent on wanting Batman toys. I don‚Äôt even know who is making these toys. 

What positive values could the Batman teach my stepson? 

So, AITA?

1. Existentialism: Focuses on individual existence, freedom, and choice, emphasizing the necessity of finding meaning in an inherently meaningless world.

>An existentialist walks into a coffee shop and orders a black coffee. The barista asks, ‚ÄúWould you like cream and sugar with that?‚Äù The existentialist sighs, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the point? Life is inherently meaningless, and even if I sweeten it up, it‚Äôs still just bitter coffee in the end.‚Äù

1. Utilitarianism: A normative ethical theory proposing that the right action is the one that maximizes overall happiness or utility.

>A utilitarian is at a party and discovers there‚Äôs only one piece of cake left. They announce, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs cut it into equal pieces!‚Äù Everyone agrees, but one person protests, ‚ÄúBut what if I‚Äôm on a diet?‚Äù The utilitarian shrugs and says, ‚ÄúWell, we can either maximize everyone‚Äôs happiness or maximize your regret later. Your choice!‚Äù

1. Rationalism: The belief that reason and intellect are the primary sources of knowledge, as opposed to experience or sensory perception.

>""Why did the rationalist break up with their significant other? They couldn't find any logical reason to stay together!""

1. Empiricism: A theory that states knowledge comes primarily from sensory experience and evidence gathered through observation.

>A rationalist and an empiricist are debating at a bar. The rationalist says, ‚ÄúI know there‚Äôs no such thing as a unicorn because I can deduce it logically!‚Äù The empiricist smirks and replies, ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôll believe it when I see it!‚Äù The rationalist rolls their eyes and says, ‚ÄúSo you‚Äôd trust your eyes over my flawless reasoning?‚Äù The empiricist grins, ‚ÄúOnly if I can take a selfie with it!‚Äù

1. Relativism: The idea that truth and moral values are not absolute but are relative to cultures, societies, or historical contexts.

>A relativist goes to a restaurant and asks the waiter, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the best dish here?‚Äù The waiter responds, ‚ÄúIt depends on your taste.‚Äù The relativist smiles, ‚ÄúExactly! And that‚Äôs why I‚Äôll have the ‚ÄòDepends‚Äô special.‚Äù The waiter laughs, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a dish we all can agree on!‚Äù

1. Dualism: The concept that reality consists of two distinct entities, often categorized as the mental and the physical.

>A dualist is at a psychic‚Äôs office. The psychic says, ‚ÄúI see a conflict in your life.‚Äù The dualist nods, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs true! My mind wants to meditate, but my body just wants to binge-watch TV.‚Äù The psychic smiles, ‚ÄúAh, the classic mind-body struggle! Have you considered compromise? The dualist thinks for a moment, ‚ÄúSure! I‚Äôll meditate during the commercials!‚Äù

1. Materialism: The belief that only physical matter exists, rejecting any spiritual or immaterial perspectives.

>A materialist walks into a store and sees a sign that reads, ‚ÄúBuy one, get one free!‚Äù They yell, ‚ÄúFinally! Something I can believe in!‚Äù The clerk smiles and says, ‚ÄúWhat would you like?‚Äù The materialist replies, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take all the physical goods you‚Äôve got‚Äîjust don‚Äôt try to sell me anything spiritual!‚Äù

1. Idealism: The philosophical stance that reality is fundamentally mental or immaterial, and that objects are shaped by perceptions and consciousness.

>An idealist is at an art gallery, staring intently at a blank canvas. A friend asks, ‚ÄúWhat are you looking at?‚Äù The idealist responds, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm contemplating the essence of nothingness.‚Äù The friend raises an eyebrow, ‚ÄúYou mean, you‚Äôre looking at a blank canvas?‚Äù The idealist beams, ‚ÄúExactly! It perfectly captures the potential of all that could be!‚Äù

1. Determinism: The theory that all events, including moral choices, are determined completely by previously existing causes.

>A determinist is at a casino, watching the roulette wheel spin. They say, ‚ÄúI can predict where the ball will land based on previous spins!‚Äù A nearby gambler laughs, ‚ÄúYou really think you can control that?‚Äù The determinist shrugs, ‚ÄúNot control, just predict! But hey, it‚Äôs all predetermined anyway, so why not enjoy the ride?‚Äù

1. Free Will: The notion that individuals have the capacity to make choices that are not determined by prior causes, often contrasted with determinism.

>A free will advocate and a determinist are having a heated debate. The advocate shouts, ‚ÄúI can choose whatever I want!‚Äù The determinist smirks, ‚ÄúBut can you choose to believe in free will?‚Äù The advocate pauses, then confidently replies, ‚ÄúOf course! I choose to believe in free will!‚Äù The determinist rolls their eyes, ‚ÄúAh, but was that choice really yours?‚Äù

1. Nihilism: The rejection of all religious and moral principles, often in the belief that life is meaningless.

>A nihilist walks into a bar and orders a drink. The bartender asks, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your philosophy?‚Äù The nihilist shrugs and says, ‚ÄúNothing matters.‚Äù The bartender pours the drink and laughs, ‚ÄúThen why are you here?‚Äù The nihilist grins, ‚ÄúWell, at least the drinks are cold!‚Äù

1. Phenomenology: A philosophical approach that emphasizes the study of conscious experience from the first-person perspective, aiming to understand how individuals perceive the world.

Currently a type 2 with 500mg metformin ER daily before lunch. Wondering what is happening with today's spike. Below are the description:

1. Had rice noodle lunch paired with with beef and chicken and veggies around 1:30pm
2. Bought groceries, walking a few minutes and got home, drink a can of zero coke and water and seltzer
3. first spike at 163mgdl at 2:33pm, while I am drinking the above, understandable, which can be a mix of carbs and liquid activating the carbs
4. drive and do laundry, had 4 -5 gluten free, ginger candy around 4pm
5. second spike 4:53pm to 202mgdl, kinda confused as to why? The candy? or the carbs still remains from my lunch....
6. drop down to 103mgdl at 5:28pm as I took a walk to get a small dunkin ice coffee with 1 splenda and 2 milk.
7. third spike up to 183mgdl at 6:13pm, this is the weirdest part, why is this happening? Then it drops again quickly.

Imagine this: you‚Äôre sipping your morning coffee, and a friend owes you 0.0023 BTC. Instead of copy-pasting a long, error-prone string of letters and numbers, you flash a QR code. They scan. Payment confirmed. Magic.

That‚Äôs exactly the kind of joy we‚Äôre bringing with our free Bitcoin QR code API. No fuss, no subscription, just instantaneous QR codes for your Bitcoin address (and more). Want to get started? Head over to our full documentation: [**https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com/bitcoin-qr-code-maker-api-and-widgets/**](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com/bitcoin-qr-code-maker-api-and-widgets/)

# üéâ What‚Äôs the Big Deal?

* **Zero cost, zero barrier** As in: free. Forever. You can embed QR codes into your site or app without paying a dime.
* **Ultra-simple integration** Just point an `<img>` tag or make a URL request, and boom ‚Äî a QR code appears.
* **Supports crypto flavors beyond Bitcoin** Our API plays nice with Bitcoin, Ethereum, and more crypto ‚Äústyles‚Äù (you pick via a style parameter).
* **Reliable & standards-friendly** We use the Bitcoin URI scheme for encoding, so wallet apps immediately understand amounts and addresses.
* **No logs, strong privacy** We prioritize your privacy: no tracking, no hidden logging.

# How It Works ‚Äî Let‚Äôs Geek Out (but not too much)

You call a URL like:

    https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com/api/?style=bitcoin&address=YOUR_ADDRESS

The API returns a QR code image embedding `""bitcoin:YOUR_ADDRESS""`. Replace the address or change `style=` (e.g. `ethereum`, `litecoin`, etc.), and you‚Äôve got QR codes for different cryptos. (We support multiple styles ‚Äî just swap in the proper parameter.)

Embed it directly:

    <img src=""https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com/api/?style=bitcoin&address=1YourBitcoinAddrHere"" width=""150"" height=""150"" alt=""Bitcoin QR code"">

Boom ‚Äî instant, scannable payment request.

You can also use our widgets (buttons, donation widgets, etc.) documented at:  
[**https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com/bitcoin-qr-code-maker-api-and-widgets/**](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com/bitcoin-qr-code-maker-api-and-widgets/)

# Why QR Codes Rock in Crypto

* **Goodbye manual typing errors** Bitcoin addresses are long and brittle ‚Äî one missed character, and your funds vanish forever. QR codes remove that risk.
* **Instant ease for users** People already know how to scan with their phone camera. No app installation, no friction.
* **Versatile deployment** Use them on invoices, donation pages, business cards, event kiosks ‚Äî wherever it makes sense.
* **Works offline** Once generated, a QR code is just an image. You can print it or use it in low-connectivity settings.

# A Word on Security

We‚Äôre all in on keeping things safe. Because QR codes are public images, users should still **verify the address** their wallet picks up after scanning. QR codes just *carry* information ‚Äî they don‚Äôt magically secure it. (This is why many crypto QR generators warn about scams and spoofed codes.)

Also: while some QR code APIs support dynamic, trackable QR codes, ours is primarily focused on **static reliability and privacy**. You control the address content; we just serve the image.

So whether you‚Äôre building a donation page, a checkout flow, or just want to make sending BTC easier for your friends ‚Äî our free Bitcoin QR code API has your back. Scan, pay, repeat.

Some of this is due to my expectations being a bit high given my nostalgia, and some of it is because the book has some honest flaws that took me out of the narrative at times. Legit, I had to listen to this while playing Palworld and doing my dailies on WuWa. If I listened to the story straight I‚Äôd have to pause every other chapter to grimace at some of the idiocy I was hearing. However, underneath all those issues is the story of outcast high schoolers trying to beat a system stacked against them and rise to the top.

Still, if you asked me, this story would be a lot better if everyone had swords and settled things in samurai duels.

But that quip will be explained later. Overall, my feelings are‚Ä¶ ***complicated***. Before I go on though, I‚Äôll give a quick note here and now.

# Disclaimer

So, I'm in my early 30s, which means I'm well past the demographic for this light novel that‚Äôs clearly aimed at young adults around 15-20. I know a lot of the issues I have with it are mostly coming from the fact that I've long since left high school behind me and I have a stronger opinion about how some of these teenagers behave. I'm going to try and go easy on this considering that, but... I've still got my issues.

Equally, I know a handful of spoilers both from the anime and the general osmosis of just... being on the internet and this sub and general youtube summaries being in my recommended feed (and I listened to those summaries months ago as background noise for my drawing sessions), so some of my opinions are partly due to me having prior knowledge of the series. With that said, here are my thoughts on the first book.

# Petty Criticisms/Nitpicks

I'll just knock out some of the more obvious issues I have with this first book now while I'm starting off. These aren't legitimate criticisms for the most part, but I'd rather address the obvious stuff now so I don't get sidetracked by them in the future.

That said...

**The S-System Twist**: This was so obvious that I'm surprised only Ayanokoji and Horikita were the only characters that worked with the knowledge that gaining what is roughly about 1K USD at the time of this book's publication for free wouldn't come without snags. This was so obvious that I feel like having it here for the twist is pointless, even more so that so many characters were screwed due to their ignorance. It felt like a contrivance for the sake of it, especially since I know later in the anime and in later books points honestly stop meaning much in the long term aside from certain characters.

**Chabashira is an Awful Teacher**: Maybe this is because I currently work in the education system and am still idealistic about it, but Chabashira really isn't a good teacher. She insults her students, mocks their efforts, only gives the barest of praise and does little to help. Her failing to explain the change in test material is such a boneheaded move that any other school would had either given disciplinary action to her or she'd be straight up fired for it considering the class she teaches was already falling apart. I get the setting is a cutthroat anime school and general teen-focused media doesn‚Äôt give much screentime and importance to adult figures, but... jeez lady, your kids are dying out here in these streets, give them a bone.

**Kushida isn't** ***that*** **Bad... Yet**: Given what I've heard about the girl and my own memories of her, Kikyo Kushida isn't really that bad of a character, at least in book one. Honestly, I too would curse Horikita's name to the heavens in private if she botched every chance given to her due to her stupid, prideful attitude. Really, all Ayanokoji would have to say when caught is agree that Horikita was kind of a bitch and deserved the harsh words and he might have been saved a little bit. That said, I know the plot and spoilers, so I know where this leads.

**The Idiot Trio Suck**: Yamauchi gets some leeway, but Sudou and Ike just kind of suck in this first book. Ike's such a perverted goblin of a person that I'm surprised it wasn't *him* on the chopping block instead of Sudou. Sudou gets some of my sympathies since he's written as a somewhat believable jock-type character, but he too was trying my patience.

**Koenji is Annoying**: Koenji just... *irks* me. This is mostly due to spoiler reasons though. He just doesn't serve a purpose aside from being a rich asshole pretty boy, and given what I know he doesn't really do anything pass this. He's just another nepo-baby in a high-society environment doing whatever he wants and screwing over people he doesn't care about. I've already seen people like this, he's just irritating.

That's all the minor issues I had. Let's talk about the bigger ones.

# Actual Criticisms

If I had to boil down my issues with Classroom of the Elite's first book, I'd say it would be its philosophizing, its world-building, and contrivances.

>**Philosophizing**

So, for those of you that only watched the anime I feel I should tell you the first chapter of this light novel is titled, **and I quote**:

*The Structure of Japanese Society*

Where Kiyotaka Ayanokoji asks us, the reader/listener, for a moment so he can discuss his musing about society and equality and how he disagrees with the idea that all people are created equal, giving quotes and examples as to how and why he believes this, while equally agreeing that despite his belief he still thinks striding for equality is noble. Going further to ask us, the reader/listener, our opinions on the future and equality.

This is in chapter fucking ***one***.

This is our first impression of the man and... damn, this is a hell of an impression. I'll leave my more biting sarcasm out of this and simply say this isn't a great first chapter or impression of our character, chapter 2 even more so and the fact that the anime more or less removed a lot of this does a lot more good for Ayanokoji's characterization as a deconstruction of the typical anime everyman than his monologuing ever does.

Characters can't just... spout off their ideologies and philosophies right off the bat like this. It creates the expectation that the story is going to be a lot more philosophical than it actually is. It leads the reader to be prepared for a grand theme or long discourse of said philosophies and ideologies. It creates an expectation of breaking down those concepts further throughout the story.

And *instead* we get Ike spending a whole damn chapter talking about the tits and ass of the female cast.

Like... ***what***? You can't do that. *You can't fucking do that.* You can't just talk all that high-minded, philosophical bullshit and just turn into a normal high school anime for nearly a fourth of the book. Hell, even the main conflict of this book has little to do with equality and society. It's about a group of failing students seen as defectives banding together to pull themselves out of the muck they walked themselves into in their idiocy and arrogance, believing they were elites without understanding elites are held to the standard of elites. Like, you can argue that Class D is being treated unfairly due to them not having the full idea of how things worked at the school, but... again, anyone could tell there'd be a catch to getting nearly 1K per month.

And that leads me to the second point:

>**World-Building**

To spare a lot of time and a lot of my nitpicking I'll simply say it makes *no sense* that these students weren't warned about the way the S-System worked and the justification for it is equally nonsensical. Despite Chabashira's words about how the real world works you are given warnings and discussions about how your workplace and expected behavior work: it's called goddamn ***orientation***. I recently was hired on for a new job a month ago and we had two days of meetings and discussions about the rules, expectations, and instructions on how to do our jobs, along with ***how our fucking paychecks work***. Me and my fellow new staff members didn't go into our first proper day of the job half-cocked, we went in with decent supplies and experienced seniors that wanted to make sure we, if not succeeded, then at least did well enough to not screw things over for everyone else. There's just a lot about how this series wants to play itself as this high-minded drama while also contriving the stupidest problems for the sake of that drama that annoys me.

Again, you can‚Äôt just do that without a good explanation. This is a school that promotes the elites of society, and since I know spoilers I know the school‚Äôs selection process is somewhat unknown and complicated, but how the hell did people like Ike and Yamauchi get in? Ryuen even?? I know Ike gets decent development later on, but seriously, in this school of elites some of these characters just don‚Äôt make any sense in being there. Again, spoilers for future volumes, but you can make the assumption that characters like Sudou, Ibuki and Albert got in on their athletics, Sakura had fame and popularity as a model despite her lacking academics and athletics, and some of the other quirky cast members have qualities that can be twisted into something that‚Äôd help in their adult lives. But‚Ä¶ Ike and Yamauchi are just idiots. Were they put in as charity case that won a raffle ala Hope‚Äôs Peak??? It feels they were added to be fodder and scapegoats for future arcs.

But anyway, my last point.

>**Contrivances**

Again, I'll be brief, but overall, I see the writer's hand on the stage while they puppet the characters a lot more than I should. Many of the issues in this first book don‚Äôt feel organic. The twist with the S-System is such an obvious swerve that Class D‚Äôs shock of it feels like the school‚Äôs apparent high standards were false, as any teen with even the most basic of money sense would know there‚Äôs a catch to getting nearly 1K a month. Some would blow all their cash, but many would also ask staff and older students what was going on.

The *‚Äòconflict‚Äô* of Horikita not wanting to be friends with people/Kushida and especially the caf√© scene felt so damn forced too. Horikita is smart and perceptive, but certain people leaving a coffee shop shouldn‚Äôt be the tipoff of a setup when the more organic tipoff could be Kushida entering the scene too quickly in her and Ayanokoji‚Äôs conversation and insisting Horikita stay with them despite Horikita making the sound argument of Kushida being better company than her. This actually did happen in the book and would make sense to call out, but Horikita just noticing Class D girls leaving is just‚Ä¶ too stupid of a reason.

The Idiot Trio not studying or trying to study when ***expulsion*** is on the line just feels forced as well. This makes some sense for Sudou, as his basketball activities take away a lot of study time, but Ike and Yamauchi thinking they can cram is just‚Ä¶ stupid, even for a group labeled as idiots.

I could go on, but then I‚Äôd really be nitpicking. That's it for the criticisms. This first novel also has a few of good points as well.

# Positives

I'll be a bit looser with these since they're more general positives of the writing and going too deep into things would spoil the story too much for those still curious.

**Ayanokoji and Horikita**: For as much as both characters irk me with their impressions, they have a great dynamic. Ayanokoji is a dense, spacey weirdo of a guy with the occasional quip that thinks he's normal when he isn't and he bounces off the cold and cutthroat Horikita very well. My favorite parts of this book are when they trade verbal snipes and jabs at each other, them touring and commenting on club activities was especially fun to listen to. Kinugasa is truly excellent at writing believable banter between two teenagers. Despite them denying it the two are obviously friends. And as characters in general both were written well enough and deconstruct the tropes they represent well enough. Ayanokoji is a nice deconstruction and commentary of the anime everyman, where his desire to be normal is seen more as being absentminded and a loner. In turn, Horikita is a good deconstruction of a kuudere, where her cold, cutthroat personality actively causes friction with her classmates and she makes an active effort to hide her softer side to her own detriment, becoming close-minded and a loner herself.

**Sudou's Development**: I honestly hated Sudou at first, but at the end of this book I started to warm up to the guy. He's not likeable, but he's decent enough that I want to see him continue to improve, and I honestly find his growing crush on Horikita to be cute. I'm rooting for the dude, even if spoilers already told me it's not really to be.

**Generally Good Banter/Dialogue**: When the story ***isn't*** philosophizing about its opinions on *Society‚Ñ¢* and *Equality‚Ñ¢*, it's honestly discussing some interesting topics. Ayanokoji convincing Horikita to save Sudou, Horikita giving her kuudere-apology by admitting Sudou's dream of being a pro basketball player is something to stride for, Kushida admitting to Horikita that she hates her to her face and Horikita now being more comfortable to work with Kushida now that she knows Kushida is only getting close for the sake of appearances. The list goes on, but it's really these smaller conversations that make this series feel fun and interesting. Again, Kinugasa is great at writing banter and dialogue.

**The Climax**: Ayanokoji and Horikita working together to buy Sudou a point is the perfect way to show both their care for Class D and their growing friendship, and it actually makes the S-System mean something as you can buy more esoteric things with points like test scores and nicely hints at possibly buying a class transfer.

>**Smaller Good Points**

* Some of the comedy lands pretty well when it isn't about the girls' bra sizes (Horikita's colder tendencies can be legit funny).

* The foreshadowing of other classes is done well, just enough to highlight them without making it obvious how important they are.

* The pre-climax strategy to pass the midterm was honestly smart tactics and feels like a somewhat organic solution, one of the few times this happens given what I know about future events.

# Conclusion

Overall, I'm mixed on this book. I think it's decent for what it is, but I'm waaaay too old to go further into it with a serious mindset. Though I'm still holding to my belief that I could take this all 80% more seriously if they all had swords and fought in samurai duels like in Armed Girl‚Äôs Machiavellianism. With how stupid the S-System is and how much bullying is honestly happening in this series later on it‚Äôd be a lot easier to buy some actions if they all were actively armed and the threat of violence and organized violence were more obvious and in your face. But that‚Äôs just me.

I'll probably be listening to Book 1 of Year 2 next to see if the writing improved at all. It‚Äôs still free and I already have a decent idea of Year 1 thanks to the anime. In any case, I‚Äôll be seeing you all later.",5,1759618886.0,ClassroomOfTheElite,2,1.0,False
1ny892z,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/1ny892z/tips_for_a_socially_anxious_person_starting_a/,Tips for a socially anxious person starting a customer service job?,"I'm in my mid-20's and just accepted a job offer for a barista position, and I'm nervous about it, but trying to see it as a growth opportunity. I've been socially anxious my whole life, and have worked either alone or in settings where I was able to work independently the vast majority of the time. I moved to a new city a little over a year ago and am working on re-starting my career in a new field but in the mean time I've had to make ends meet, so I started dog walking and pet sitting for people to pay the bills. Although I do meet the owners face-to-face initially, there's pretty minimal human interaction on the whole, and I think it's made my social anxiety worse over time. I'm excited to be in a new environment and have coworkers again but the customer service aspect is what worries me. Making coffee sounds like fun!

  
If anyone here has had success working in a customer service role, I'd love to hear from you. Do you feel like it got easier over time? How do you work up the courage to ask for help with something when you're worried you should already know it? It's so much harder for me to absorb new information when I'm anxious. I have one friend who said that working as a bartender helped him with his social skills, but I just feel like my mental health issues put me at a disadvantage in that kind of environment and I just want to know how other socially anxious people cope when dealing with customers all day.
