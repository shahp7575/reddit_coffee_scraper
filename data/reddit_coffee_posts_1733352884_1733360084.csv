1h6wf8i,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_ForestHasEyes/comments/1h6wf8i/an_occult_hunters_deathlog_part_6/,An Occult Hunter's Deathlog [Part 6],"This is Dwight Nolan, November-1, if you’re reading this it’s because my authentication code cleared which tells you it’s really me… or our adversaries now possess the ability to mine information directly from the unwilling, I guess you’ll just have to trust me. 

So the situation back in that awful cavern, for starters it was nearly impossible to see outside. Legitimately, the wall of darkness facing us was so thick you could maybe see a few feet. Night vision displayed… Well, let’s just say there were a lot of them waiting out there for us. Blackburn cursed as he continued to try and key into the radio, both of us by the front entrance as we heard the gathering storm outside. Theoretically they could just burst in, tear us apart, and rewire our souls to become apart of them and the New Advent, however in old customs it’s stated some vampires cannot enter unless being invited, spirits as well. 

Maybe this was some sign of their old world customs still binding them. 
Maybe they just couldn’t figure out how to open a door. 

Either way the marshal sat back against the rock wall and took off his hat, the both of us sitting in silence as he let out a long exhale; “Ain’t this a fuckin’ tizzy” he said. He looked to the door, then back to me “No comms… figures cause we’re at the epicenter of this shit, but if we don’t get ourselves going? We’ll be with them soon”. 

12 civilians, a march the better part of at least a kilometer, against all of that adversity. We needed to move, however doing so was suicide and yet staying here was slow death. It’s like being dealt a bad hand at the poker table, but we can only hold for so long- eventually we’re gonna have to play. 

Now some of you who might have known me for a while might ask what exactly Isaac and I caught up to… well we were in that cave for several hours, initially trying to see if we could physically wait out the darkness. Nothing… worse so time was standing still; It was 1:28am for what felt like hours. During that time while Niyol and Matsoi checked our rescued persons for injuries, Zeus was sleeping in the corner, and I sat down on a couple of old chairs and talked with the single person I’d recognized. 

“The hell are you doing here?” I asked, completely astounded that Isaac was here, after six long years of not seeing him. “Oh you know… well, you don’t, I guess, that’s why you asked. No so I was just going about my day…” he says, before stopping, his single eye seeming to glance off. I waited for a moment before asking; “Isaac?”. 

Then he said the most off putting all decade: “Okay weirdest thing, I can’t remember”. 
“You can’t remember?”. 
“Nope”. 
“Isaac it has been six entire years, how can you not remember?”. 
“Well I can remember some portions…” he says scratching his chin: “I’d worked down at the local gun store, you know the one run by those two europeans? Yeah… I was there for a while, started talking to this one lady and then one day she stopped… being there”. 

I raised an eyebrow “What?”. 
“Yeah… a lot of people did, that town you did all that work in? Yeah so I noticed when traffic started getting easier to navigate, heh… okay yeah, bad joke. No but then… I don’t know… I just remember the night sky getting darker, one day I found myself walking out of town…” he said, hands slapping his thighs and giving me a thumbs up like somehow that answered… anything. 

The long minute of silence told him that didn’t really solve anything, he scratched the back of his neck “I… tried to talk to Rosanne, you know the occult woman in town who… exercised rivers and talks to trees-”. 

“Yes Isaac I know very well who Rosanne is” I say sternly, to which he feigned throwing up his hands “Well I’m glad to see you’re still you, Staff Sergeant”. From across the room, Blackburn spat some of his dip into an empty can he’d been keeping nearby “He’s not the military anymore, guy”. Isaac then turned in his chair to him “Listen: Once a staff sarge, always a staff sarge… so…” he then turned back to me “Staff Sausarge… what’s been keeping you?”. 

I explained to him the offer I had gotten from PEXU all those years ago, and generally recounted some stories up until then. Isaac would make such intelligent commentary like saying loudly “Wait you fought a Wendigo?!”. I remember distinctly Matsoi’s wife slapped him upside the head, from the way he responded I guess they got acquainted while in that cell. Something was bugging me though and I asked “Wait… you said you tried to contact Rosanne…”. 

That’s when… yeah, there was a look in his eye when he said it: “Didn’t work because… she disappeared first”. 

These were things that would need to be handled later, but they were, for now… I had a close friend back that I hadn’t seen. For those who aren’t acquainted with Isaac, I’m fairly certain my old blog series might still be up. Regardless… the five of us: Myself, Blackburn, Matsoi, and Niyol, and even Isaac huddled up. The Marshal was adverse to Isaac as he eyed him, looking back to me “You trust this fool?”. 

I looked to see what he was… Isaac was having a conversation with a cave painting. I sighed “Yeah… let’s just say when the going gets… going, he’s very capable”. That being said I don’t know how Isaac had fared the last six years so… time for a reintroduction I guess. John simply looked at the Idaho native remarking: “Well bless his heart”. 

All of us convened over the table with Blackburn starting us off “We have got to get moving, those things out there are surrounding us”. Isaac chimed in saying “Well I mean, we could always just wait out the storm. The sun will be here soon”. A few of us looked to Isaac as John rolled his eyes “Ain’t happening, son, that darkness is eternal”. 

Isaac stopped his chuckling with a “say what now?”. 

“We’re at the epicenter and caught in the snare, however our only exit out is currently directly into their maelstrom” Matsoi said looking back towards the entrance. Niyol chimed in “Not the only one” and proceeded to walk over towards a large old wall of the mine, he then punched through some of the rotten boards, and we helped the medicine man uncover an old forgotten passage way. He explained “This used to be the only passage up before the road around was created, they seemed to have not found it. It will cut our travel to our vehicles in half. From there it’ll still be a half of a kilometer journey to our vehicles”. 

“Will we be out of… whatever this is?” I asked, Niyol nodded, I looked to John “If we’re not in some sort of snare… we can easily handle whatever’s there for a few hundred meters”. We consolidated all we had, designated able bodied persons to carry any of the children or help the elderly, I prepped my night vision as Isaac walked up: “So… I don’t suppose you’ve got any firepower for me?”. 

I looked to Blackburn who was placing half a lip of what could be his last can in his mouth “don’t you fuckin look at me-”. 

I sighed and handed Isaac my glock and the magazines for it “Don’t lose it, and make them count, keep them off the-”. 

“Keep em off the civics, don’t worry, I’ve got you” Isaac said, shoving the magazines into the pocket of his flannel. “Isaac you are a fuckin’ civie” Blackburn muttered, to which he responded “I am an experienced monster hunter… I saved Nolan’s life”. Blackburn looked to me unconvinced to which I confirmed “A few times, actually”. 

This seemed to settle the Marshal’s grievances as we prepped. I led first with my kalashnikov leading the way, the dark, ancient tunnels of the navajo were as eerie as can be as the illuminator of my laser traced every possible hiding spot under white and blue night vision. Just behind me I could hear Isaac and Blackburn, Matsoi and Niyol took the rear guard to make sure no one fell behind, Zeus kept to my side the entire way. 

Then… the sound of wind could be heard as the faintest moonlight crept in around a corner, Isaac and I quickly cut the distance and panned out and saw a dark horizon but… filled with the tiniest specs of stars. Zeus’ ears were back as he let out a low growl for what laid ahead. We could hear nervous muttering from the rest of the people as they followed us like new age shepherds, Niyol panned out sighing “We are just barely at the edge of it’s presence… where is our vehicles?”. I quickly checked my ATAK, flipping the device back closed: 465 meters, due our 11 o’clock. 

“Alright… let’s go” Matsoi said, quickly we all moved as fast yet as discreetly as we could, with only the slightest wind around us in that black and indigo covered desert landscape it seemed as if everything created sound. Yet… we kept moving, finally our vehicles were within sight. That’s… when we heard it. 

The most gutteral, bone shaking roar I’d ever heard that sounded both in the distance and right behind us called out. With our two vehicles in sight I shouted: “Matsoi, get them loaded up, go!! Go!!”. I quickly cut to the back to provide any covering support as the herd of people led by Blackburn and Matsoi moved, I checked around for Niyol. The Medicine man was back helping a young lady escort an old woman, one of their town’s elderly, he had barely noticed the presence behind him. He turned to see… what looked like a female lead from the dark, with a single slash some sort of foul substance coated his eyes causing him to scream. 

“Contact!!” I shouted instinctively as I centered my laser on her and fired, a series of bright 7.62 flashes punctured her and caused her to roar as she melted back into the black. Immediately I raced over to Niyol as Zeus barked off at whatever it was, I grabbed his hand and pulled him to his feet. It looked like oil although I swear it moved as he brushed it off his eyes, her strike had cut his skin and his eyes were a mess of blood and… it. “Can you see?” I asked, he used his rifle to push himself up “barely”. 

In my peltors I heard John yell “We’ve got contacts up here!!!”. We raced to see Blackburn firing off at shadows in the distance, the marshal was putting in work with his heavy lever action as Matsoi fired off his short barreled AK. What seemed to be a… dog with far too many appendages broke towards the Marshal, he fired but his rifle went dry. As it leaped at him he quickly jutted it’s muzzle forward, impaling it into the thing, he then quickly hip fired his pistol. Several shots as it screamed and pulled off him, before he loaded that thing like lightning and began firing again. 

Isaac and I escorted the medicine man and the last of the civilians into the vehicles when suddenly, something broke from the dark. It had antlers, rippling muscles yet somehow a lanky body. I quickly fired at it and it ducked away as I could see parts of it torn off. Another came from the opposite direction, and I could see Isaac firing away with his pistol. Just then, I turned to see one of them had somehow closed completely on top of me. I fired my rifle but it pushed the barrel out of the way, shots firing all over the horizon before my gun went dry. I pulled my weapon away, the thing had red eyes, that much I remember, several jaws all over it’s body, I remember muzzle thumping my AK into one of them and pinning it to the ground. I then reloaded as I kept it pinned, before firing into it as it writhed. 

“Sarge, we’re good, let’s go!!!” Isaac yelled as he and I ducked into the back of the pick up with several of the people. I took a knee and maintained cover as I whistled, Zeus proceeded to leap almost 7 feet off the ground to land inside, crashing into several of us. As we pulled off… I could see them watching from the shadows. 

We weren’t done yet, not by a long shot. 

Despite this the sight of a bright sky of night time stars and the moon was a boon to our morale. Our small convoy pulled back in front of the police station, Matsoi was helping Niyol out, as the people quickly left the vehicles, being greeted by several others. I scanned around to see several residents had come out of their homes… including the mayor. Though to be honest I was too busy pulling off my helmet and catching my breath as I sat on the cab of the truck, Isaac pet Zeus. 

There was misery and merriment, all of which was silenced as the mayor shouted in Navajo as he approached Niyol and Matsoi. From what I could see he kept gesturing to his watch, I then decided to check mine and I realized why he was so angered- we had been gone for several days. 

Matsoi then pointed to the Marshal and myself, the both of us dropping down as we approached Altse. “He tells me you were… ambushed” the mayor said, calming himself. “Shit… we were fuckin’ trapped… it’s way worse, you don’t have infiltrators, you got a whole god damn invading army” Blackburn barked. I nodded, there was not much more I could add but; “we barely got out with everyone we had… the New Advent’s laid their claws in your home, sir”. 

Matsoi then nodded “they were giving their bodies as vessels, all we found of them were husks, and that was nearly a dozen… who knows what crawled out of them!!”. It seemed the mayor had been calmed and brought onto the same page, he looked around and asked “what happens now”. Matsoi seemed stumped as he controlled himself, finally having seen the proof of his woes he… stopped, genuinely he probably didn’t think he’d get here. Blackburn looked to me “You know what I’m gonna suggest”. 

The mayor raised an eyebrow as I stepped forward “Sir… they’re coming down from that Mesa, and they’re gonna besiege this place. You’ll have more of those things here than you will living people. My advice? Get everyone to the best defensive position and we call in a PEXU SMU, your people may not have wanted a full unit down here, but-”. 

“But you got enough creepy crawlies down there to usher in the new rapture, and they did a number on your guy over there and he’s custom made to mess up witches and wendigos” Isaac said from the bed of the truck. Altse seemed to pause for a moment before asking “Who… are you?”. 

“Isaac, friend of the staff sergeant” he said with a smirk and pointed to me. “He… might’ve worded that strange as hell, but he’s right” the marshal said. The mayor looked around, allowing a moment for time to stand till as he took a single exhale… he nodded and patted Matsoi on the shoulder. “Order everyone to the center hall, get them into the concrete cellar. Tell them all guns…” Altse ordered his police chief, which caused several of the male residents of the town to whoop and holler as they ran off. He then looked to Blackburn and myself “If you have any friends you can send? Get them down here, you have our permission”. 

Roger fuckin’ that. 
I quickly walked off as I left my helmet and rifle in the truck, telling Isaac to keep watch, Blackburn pulled out his keyring; “I’ll distribute our goods, you get on the line and tell that brit to send whoever he can”. 

I quickly fished out my SATCOM, hooked up the tripod and antenna, connected it to my personal radio and… [“November-1 to main…”]. There was nothing but static and silence, I tried again; [“November-1 to main… radio check, any station on this channel this is November-1, radio check, over”]. 

Finally: [“... November-1 this is main, sitrep over”]. 
I’d never been so glad to hear Montgomery in my life up until that point. I gave the down and dirty… there was a lot of back and forth, but I cut to the point [“we need a full unit down here, there are far too many PARAFOR for us to handle”]. 

[“November-1, tonight there are several coordinated attacks, many of the units we had in the North American AO are tasked out. We may not be able to reinforce you, how copy”]. 

I cursed, at this time some of the people and Isaac had seen, the latter kept watch as I barked back [“Main, this is November-1, if you don’t get someone down here we will be outgunned, undermanned, and you’re looking at a worse disaster than Tipton… and the Navajo Nation vilifying us for it… how copy, over?”]. 

After a moment of silence: [“Wait one, over”]. 
I stood there, staring into the sky wondering how long until the stars above disappeared like they had in the desert before finally… I got a response. [“November-1 this is main, you have additional forces enroute. SMU Raider is approximately 45 mikes how, how copy?”]. 

4th Special Forces Group. 
A detachment of green berets currently led by an old friend of mine, Nicholas Walker. 
Yeah… that’ll do. 

[“I copy all”]. 
[“November-1, send any new data, and good luck”]. 

I quickly grabbed my gear and staged my vic near the center hall; a concrete building with vivid paintings of the people’s history spread across in chipped blues, orange, red, and yellows. If I wasn’t working off institutionalized muscle memory I might’ve taken a moment to stop, as the story of the entire Navajo people was laid out through better and worse times… I guess this was another chapter for them, what would happen next would decide if it would be a good one or not, but it wouldn’t be the final one. 

The sounds of nearly four dozen people ushed down the stairwell towards the back of the building could be heard as I entered, what was a carpeted center room now had all of the furniture pushed to the windows and around the door in makeshift barricades. Matsoi and Blackburn quickly unlocked the equipment cases from the church. As the Marshal lined up at least a dozen incendiary and stun grenades, the Navajo police chief quickly unsealed some cases of ammunition; “You two brought more with you than my station’s stocks”. 

I checked on Niyol, whose wife was busy cleaning his eyes, he raised his head instinctively to me “Nolan…. Are you friends on their way?”. This was also the first time he addressed me by my name in a non-insulting manner “Yeah, they’ll be here soon”. He seemed to resign to the situation, sitting back with his weapon on his lap “well… let’s hope this final alliance stands better than the last”. 

Matsoi seemed to be working a mile a minute as he scanned around “Not everyone’s here… we’ll have to do this the old fashioned way and go block to block”. I grabbed my weapon, checking it as Isaac jumped to his feet “I’ll volunteer too, but two guys and a dog isn’t enough for a whole town”. That’s when we heard the door open, remember those townsmen who were all too energized to be called to arms? The nation’s people are extremely well versed in their old warrior skills as several were professionally armed with everything from a modern rifle to an old school bolt action, handguns, a chest rig, and all. Matsoi gestured to them “Dwight, my men will assist you”. 

“Roger that… oh, one more thing… Isaac” I said, kicking over a gun case to him. He quickly opened it up, pulling out a Remington 870 that Blackburn had prepped with a side saddle, light, and extended tube. “Don’t you fuckin’ break it” the Marshal barked. 

Last thing he said before grabbing a bandolier of shells was: “Wouldn’t dream of it, Calamity Jane”. 

It was a strange feeling of the past, hoofing it down the dark streets with a vest and ACH with nods on, flanked by the armed locals as they quickly went door to door. Many of them knew who lived nearby, who would probably still be at home, we worked efficiently to comb the streets. The town wasn’t that large, we burned maybe 16 minutes before we were certain no one was around. Taking stock I stopped at an interaction as Isaac and the Navajo militiamen quickly posted up behind nearby vehicles, stone walls, around corners… 

[“November-1 to Bravo-1…”] I said trying to reach Blackburn, I could hear him but it was… broken up. [“D-....ht, we’ve …. signs of –c…ing, southside…”] is all that came through. I looked around, our group getting restless as we stopped, I tried again… nothing. The same level of interference we had at the Mesa, I took a look up and sure… the stars were getting dimmer. Then… contact. 

The sound of tearing metal could be heard as we canned the road nothwards, a wooden plank fence with old red paint was slowly torn apart as spindly limbs punched their way through. What pulled itself over and through was this amalgamation of what looked like calcified roots and tendrils, weaving together in some horrid round form. A single haunting face like that of a wax figure that was melted to where its jaw and chun melted together, poked through, it was at least 3 meters tall. Then… more sounds, from the gangways and yards, we were right at the head of an assault. 

I immediately fired off a burst of rounds, firing into the thing causing a… reverberation, it felt like my skull shook. Several of the others were feeling it as they fired off, some aiming towards distant sounds; “Pick up, we’re moving!!!” I ordered. We tried a bounding retreat but elected to just turn and burn when we heard an additional noise directly to our right, the quick paced sound of metal being smashed, chain link being torn if that’s possible, something in us kicked in and we realized we were outnumbered and surrounded. 

Despite this some of the navajo men laughed, one of them with a suped up AK like the one I was using firing off a few shots as I could hear muffled prayers under their breaths. I said one too… we were going to need it. I daringly took a look back to see that thing gaining on us, fast, and I mean really fast, it seemed to somehow be able to pull itself ten meters at a time. Suddenly one of the men at the front of the group had his leg snagged, he dropped to the ground as he and his weapon were dragged back. I grabbed his hand with my off hand, aiming my AK at the thing which was just halfway down the black. He screamed and I could see why… the tendril has metal barbs protruding out of it that dug into his flesh like a thousand fish hooks. As the sound of his skin tearing could be heard, Isaac placed his boomstock onto the thing and fired. The material tore away as it howled enigmatically… I helped the guy hop back along with another militia member as we hauled ass to the center hall. 

“Open the hell up!!” Isaac called out as the doors opened and we bolted through. Quickly a designated “field medic” in the form of the town doctor took the man to a triage bed, quickly looking after him as Blackburn, Matsoi, and several others took to the windows. “I was trying to reach you, cameras been going dead all along the southside…” Blackburn walked over. I switched out my magazine; “We took contact from the north, John”. 

“So… both ends of town closing in…” the Marshal noted. Then… the sound of something landing hard on top of the concrete building, causing the lights to flicker caused everyone to stop. Dust fell off the ceiling as Zeus was barking like a mad man, Isaac looked to Matsoi “I don’t suppose you got anyone on the roof”. 

Then… almost instantaneously, the lights went out… I quickly flicked down my dual tubes, John produced a set of digital NVGs of his own as the both of us scanned around. Immediately the back up generator for the building kicked in as dim orange lights gave everyone else some light. Matsoi immediately shouted to his people, as everyone stood fast… then? 

The laughing. 
I remember something like it back in the forests of Missouri, I don’t think what is out there has a concept of humor but they know exactly what rattles us. Like a chorus, both verbal through the shadows outside and inside our minds, suddenly the sounds of dozens of them crawling all on the outside. Suddenly through the metal places and furniture placed against them, one of the windows broke… then another. Then the doorknob started to turn as the howls began: “Stay put, they’re trying to off put us” I warned, looking around at the different entrances. “Yeah well, consider it achieved” Isaac quipped, taking cover behind a cabinet as he aimed his shotgun. 

It’s then that Marshal Blackburn walked up to one of the barricade shaking his head; “Nah, not for me”. He then pulled the pin on a flashbang, throwing it just outside as he and some of the Navajo defenders took cover. Normally they’re not as bright as you see in movies, but due to the sheer black outside, it seemed like a flash of white coated outside. 

It also gave us a small glimpse of them… all of them: contorted, demented forms as whatever they were destroying the physical… sense, the sanity of whatever they inhabited. Gaping maws, slender, yet ginormous forms. Their laughing stopped, and they started to roar, and yell…. Isaac was the first to fire as one of the entities tore through an entire cabinet, it’s arms lined with spikes, as it’s skin was missing, grey and lifeless. A blast of buckshot cast her back… at the other windows, the Navajo quickly took up arms and began to fire off, Matsoi commanding his people. 

I was running through out, aiming my laser and taking shots to help where I could and fill gap. One of the militiamen had his shoulder cut when a hand, just a hand, reached through and grabbed hole… then proceeded to rip a chunk out of him like he was wet paper. I dragged him back to the aid area with Matsoi, reloading my weapon. 

“Nolan…” a voice through all of the loud gunfire and yelling could be heard, I turned back to see the mayor, Altse… holding… Well first, he seemed to have thrown on one of his old digs. Old school BDU camo, green and black, a chest rig that the vietnam rangers used to rock as in his arms was an M60, gas operated air cooled belt fed machine gun. “Where do you need this?” he asked calmly. Blackburn fired off his lever action as he ducked back around the window to the wall. He looked up as he reloaded, pausing; “Where the fuck’s that been?!”. 

“My property is my business, lawman… now, where do you need it?” Altse reiterated, just then the sound of something big began to slam on the front doors directly in front of us as I aimed my Kalashnikov; “Right here should do….”. Whatever was out there had the clean mass of a trunk as the concrete shook and even cracked at the edges of the front door. Zeus assisted by grabbing the neck of one of the things as it’s contorted skull poked in, keeping it in place as Isaac unceremoniously exorcized it’s skull.  Suddenly… the center doors came loose, the metal warped as one of them nearly fell off… a hulking mass of what looked like limbs started to crawl through, the thing in the road. 

“Gun hot!!!” Altse yelled, with the M60’s bipod mounted onto a large trough box, he took aim and fired a burst straight through the metal. Blackburn and several others ducked back as the sound shook the building, red and white streaks tearing into it as black substance flew all around the door. Another burst, I took aim and assisted, as did the Marshal and several others. The king beast withdrew with a roar torn off limbs fell through the mess of metal that was the entrance. One of them twitched and began to crawl, causing one of the medics to panic as a knife was planted into the palm… by Niyol. “You back to shape, old timer?” Matsoi asked as he cleaned his blade; “just barely…”. 

The things outside began to crawl around, shaking the building as they the sound of tearing metal could be heard… then, a sound from one of the walls. Matsoi’s eyes raised “They’re entering through the air system!!”. I took lead with several others, including Isaac, Zeus sprinted off towards the basement stares as the dim lighting was even worse. The cellar was an open concrete area, the townsfolk were huddling near the edges… we reached the bottom. Suddenly… through the HVAC unit we could hear something messily fall through and from the vent, it burst out. Miniature versions of the things began to spill out, messily, trailing their black blood behind them. One leaped for some of the civilians, however Zeus quickly leaped, pinned it down, and gored it. Another was skeet shot out of the air by Isaac who fired on the vent and turned it into a messy bottleneck for them. The Navajo defenders and I quickly took aim and fired, I stomped one before firing into another. One of them men grabbed one and whipped it into a wall as another jumped on his back, I took aim and shot it off with a single shot. Then… one of the last of those things leaped for me, I turned-... and saw it hit out of the air by a metal bat, then pulverized… by Matsoi’s wife who was guarding a group of the town's children. 

“Careful, Staff Sergeant” she quipped. 
“Nice one, uh… Sarah, was it?” Isaac quipped, she rolled her eyes and responded with “Glad to see you’re still topside Isaac”. 

“Technically we’re underground” Isaac said. 
“Shut up”. 

From outside a loud noise could be heard, originally we thought it was yet another creature attempting to gain entry, but I immediately knew what that was. Aircraft, specifically a helicopter and the literal best thing we could hear at that point causing me to outright laugh and pump a fist. Isaac seemed confused “I don’t follow, those cultists didn’t give me a lunch, kinda light headed…”. 

“That’s our back up”. 

…
[Log-Addendum Added… Processing….] 
[Author: Captain Walker, Nicholas, SMU “Raider” of 4th Special Forces Group]. 

I’ve been asked by the brass to give my perspective of our quick response deployment to the Navajo Nation, this is Captain Nicholas Walker. For those reading you’ll have to forgive me, I’m used to writing OPORDERs and debriefs, planning missions, and my after action reports are dry, but I’ll give as best of a retelling as to what the hell we encountered down there. 

We were on QRF tasking when we had gotten the alert, we seem to be doing a lot of that… probably because our specific team of America’s finest happens to be able to adapt the best against PARAFOR and their unusual circumstances. Regardless, multiple alerts had been given out and some of our sister units in Canadian JTF2, 1st Ranger Batt’, even a unit of FBI HRT based down in Virginia had been spun up. The New Advent’s roots were tightening around us and missions were more frequent than the ‘07 surge. We expected something to pop off and give us a reason to roll out, I just didn’t expect it to be an old friend… 

Montgomery’s words somewhat-exactly: “A joint mission to bring the Navajo onboard has gone completely bloody FUBAR, we’ve got several solos stuck down there with reality warping entities having tore a damn hole in the county. They’ll be overwhelmed if they don’t receive immediate assistance. Local liaison is the town’s chief Matsoi, solos tasked are US Marshal John Blackburn and Dwight Nolan”. 

I’d recommended Xavier to bring Dwight in, especially after he went toe to toe with whatever the hell he found back in southern Missouri. He was an absolute firebrand of a squad leader back in our line unit, got it done but also kept his guys’ heads above water mentally. Him and I kept contact tangentially however I reached out after he joined with PEXU, and I wasn’t too surprised he started tearing through target packages left and right. He might not say as much, but from a cohort of his looking in… Dwight Nolan has eliminated cases as a solo than some groups of them fail to do in the greatest quantity. 

So if his ass was in the fire… let’s just say me and my boys were suited up, radios prepped, and out on that tarmac before the coffee was hot. Our ramp brief laid out a clusterfuck ahead [“Inward communications limited, OPFOR unable to be seen on ISR, drones unable to regain visual on town due to supposed ‘wall of darkness’... break”]. I flipped my notes, keying back in; [“Contact on entry is likely, though birds will take us in…”]. I closed my boot and shoved it back in my rig’s pocket, eyeing one of the door gunners… an M134 minigun, chambered in good ol’ 7.62 NATO… I’ve seen those things bisect vehicles faster than you can register. If there’s one thing I’ve learned about my time with the unit, a healthy amount of well trained warfighters is equivocal to anything that crawls out the primordial asscrack of this universe. 

We quickly entered the airspace of the town, our nods were down but we couldn’t make out a damn thing… legitimately. I knew what they meant by wall of darkness because the clouds soon vanished and a void is what greeted us. The crew chief came back to talk: [“We’re still able to make out altitude, once you’re on the ground we’ll be unable to provide air support”]. 

Not the best, though last thing we’d want is a blackhawk going down because it hit a damn light pole in a Navajo town. Try explaining that on the news, Xavier. 

Soon we felt the rotors stabilize as gravity remind us we are still on earth, we exited right side, half crescent formation as we all took up sectors. Our comms sergeant chimed in, short range communications were still up… the leader of my alpha team, also the one who keeps you updated on 4th Group, SSg Ivensky, kept all sectors scanned. Our warrant kept look out with a thermal as the birds left us in total darkness and silence. 

That was… until we could make out gunfire. The sound had the same effect as the cold, too much of it too far and it seems silent, but whatever was going down pierced that veil… our people were still alive. Our medic doc said something akin to “-Hell yeah, give ‘em hell”. 

“Ivensky, have Alpha pick up, we’re fucking moving” I ordered. Our warrant kept chirping in my ear; [“This matches stories I’ve heard about the Anaye”]. We moved carefully as our quad nods had trouble piercing the darkness though we quickly made our way to one of the streets, we’d been emplaced on the north end of town. [“The hell you talking about, chief?”] I barked, keeping volume low. 

[“When they enter our world in great numbers, their entry way sucks all energy back into it… I see no stars and no sun”] he noted. I looked around, he was right, though as he noted [“That’s just the working theory”]. 

Ivensky’s alpha team immediately snapped to action I saw them quickly take cover behind a nearby car aiming down the road as through the comms [“Contact!! Five PARAFOR front!!”]. I immediately hoofed it… sure enough; two that looked like hybrids of canine and corpses, some sort of marionette, all charged, talons, bones, reaching out as they closed the distance quickly. Was nothing we couldn’t handle, I saw peq lasers on targets, cutting them down even if it did require an entire magazine each. Another leaped from one of the roofs, though alpha’s gunner took it out with one hell of a burst… showered us as well. 

Doc didn’t hesitate to complain [“Dammit, I just got that West Tennessee shit out of my kit”].


Bravo team bounded up as Alpha replenished and fell in… we could see the damage these things had done. Torn up fences, cars had been smashed though it seemed as if they moved quickly. Pieces of them, calcium, rotten flesh, flaked skin, littered the ground [“Seems like the locals did a number”] Bravo’s team leader, Sullivan noted, chief disagreed. [“There’s no brass, this wasn’t a firefight”] he noted, I looked over [“So what’s your theory then?”]. 

[“They’re molting”]. 


Soon we reached the center of town where the gunfire emanate, though as we approached from the east side of the center hall, we could see tracers and hear the whizz of outgoing rounds. We immediately hugged a nearby concrete wall, not wanting to catch blue on blue and become a folded flag. Our comms sergeant tried to reach them; [“Friendly units inside, this is Raider-Romeo….”]. Nothing, yet fighting could still be heard, one of our guys stupidly tried to peek around to see and nearly caught an AK round that tore off a chunk of the wall. 

“Don’t lose your head, guy” was all I could say. [“What’s the play?”] Chief asked, they were barricaded, and from what we could assess carefully… multiple parafor along with a larger creature were around the entrances and possibly made entry. [“Break the siege… Bravo deploy a starcluster and flare to let them know we’re not flesh eaters, Alpha bound out and we’ll take the center of the road…. Draw that big son of a bitch off the top of the roof”]. 

Without hesitation Sullivan immediately slammed a silver canister into the ground, a bright burst of pyrotechnics bathed the road ahead as Ivenskyy’s team stormed out and took the center, posting up behind some vehicles. I rushed out, following behind to the far side as we saw… it… the thing was some mass of yarn, but instead of yarn it was limbs, spinal cords, and it face looked… otherworldly. Let’s just say, it had all the right functions to see, smell, and speak, and those forward facing eyes… all of them, told us it was a predator. It dropped off, limbs and flesh falling showing the damage as we engaged. 

A burst from the belt fed, and our grenadiers immediately started to put rounds on target though I warned “Don’t hit the fuckin’ town hall with a 40-”. An HEDP found it’s place directly in the center of it’s chest, guts and entire bodies spilling out almost like we popped it’s sternum. We did… it rushed us, a swat and several calcified talons as big as .50 rounds nearly hit us. Yet… eventually… the thing began to lose balance, eventually falling as its centipede-like structure caved in. It still roared as we advanced, Bravo pushed right and fired on the smaller ones still at the building, while Alpha and I approached it. Its ring of eyes looked up, I aimed my SCAR heavy and put enough rounds to pierce its crown of a skull. 

[“Lead to all Raiders, advance to the center hall”]. 

[Log-Addendum ended] 

Seeing Walker and his green eyed devils emerge from that red and smoke filled street was the best thing we’d seen throughout this long well. Immediately there was crying, cheering, some like Blackburn slumped against the walls as Altse and I emerged. Zeus immediately ran up as Walker’s men took point, the captain flipped his quad nods up “Nolan… up shit’s creek I see”. 

“Regular circumstances, yes”. 

“You Special Forces?” Altse asked, Walker eyed the patches on the mayor’s jacket “Formerly 10th but yeah, you were at Stewart? Bless your soul”. I could see their warrant officer positioning guys, one of their teams quickly went around the building confirming dead parafor with two rounds each as their comms guy started to set up an advanced antenna. 

That’s when Isaac caught up; “Is it true those things cost as much as a house?” he said, gesturing to Walker’s night vision. The Atlanta native eyed me then back to Isaac “More like a truck but yeah… who’re you?”. 

“Isaac” he said, resting his shotgun on his shoulder. 
Walker then rolled his eyes “This one is Isaac? … Yeah, that tracks”. 

…. 
Closing up now as there’s a lot of fallout from that. Our ties with the Navajo Nation have strengthened as that alliance baptism in fire has encouraged both sides to work together more closely. That being said it seems our victory’s gotten a lot of them pissed off, New Advent’s Ryan Evans just came on the news talking about a “new effort” to unite the people. 

It’s going to get worse, before it gets worse. 
That being said, we’re in this for the long run. 

Don’t believe their lies, hope isn’t dead even if it’s knee deep in a foxhole. PEXU works in the dark, and I’ll be back soon, with Isaac, Zeus, and the Marshal. 

Stay safe.

I ordered a Magnifica Plus Automatic Espresso Machine from DeLonghi and already regret not using Amazon. The only delivery option available was FedEx, and the package will arrive while I’m away. I attempted to change the delivery to ""hold at location"" or another option besides delivery to a neighbor, which seems to be the default if I'm not home. However, I can't make any changes online due to shipper restrictions. I called FedEx, and while they were empathetic, they couldn’t help either and advised me to contact DeLonghi.

I then reached out to DeLonghi customer service, where I encountered a highly condescending representative. I was told I should call FedEx again, which, as you can imagine, was frustrating after already having been on the phone with them for 20 minutes (just before). DeLonghi insisted they have no control over shipments and can't make any changes, which I know isn't true, as I ship with FedEx myself and understand the restrictions. The representative even implied that others don’t have these issues and rhetorically asked if I thought I was the only one ordering.

I feel disrespected and frustrated. I wonder if my treatment was influenced by my non-US accent and that frustration. I doubt I will purchase DeLonghi products again (this is my second coffee machine in 2 years), but I still want the item I paid for and which is on the way. What is the best course of action here? Is there a way to contact someone at DeLonghi who understands FedEx's shipping restrictions (and the fact that they do have control over them)? Should I wait for the package to be returned to DeLonghi (the most likely scenario) and reorder from Amazon? Or perhaps I should reach out to OAG in my state? Any advice welcome.

1h6wdtj,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h6wdtj,Help me figure out how to rabbit proof this litter box,"I'm a long time rabbit owner and first time cat owner. My tuxedo boy Lobster is 4 years old. Presently we have one rabbit, a Flemish giant mix named Athena. Athena is the boss of the house. She also outweighs lobster by at least 4 lb. She's big. She's strong. She's bossy. 

Athena has three litter boxes of her own and we have two litter boxes with kitty litter. Lobster also uses her litter boxes sometimes, but he really prefers the cat litter boxes because he can dig. 

Clay cat litter is very toxic to rabbits. They also have a really strong chance of ingesting it because they like to eat while they poop. One of lobster's litter boxes is way too high for Athena to reach. The second one is up on a coffee table that I thought was high enough. I was wrong after she started using it. We elevated it on top of a storage container but recently she has figured out how to jump or get up on top of the storage container. We thought about doubling up the storage containers but then it makes it way too tall and unstable for Lobster.

 I would rather not get rid of this litter box and I can't really think of another place to put it that she can't reach. (This would be 5 litter boxes for 2 animals in our house). Lobster also really likes using that litter box and I'm not sure if removing a letterbox from that spot will result in territorial marking in that spot anyway.

 So I leave it to the genius minds of Reddit to please come up with an idea to rabbit proof this litter box. The rabbit is bigger, bolder, more aggressive, but less agile. What would you do??? Cat and rabbit tax included. ",1,1733359728.0,cats,0,1.0,False

I am 28F who will be moving from TX with a large dog. I will have a car but will be commuting into Lower Manhattan a few times a week by transit. My friends live throughout Brooklyn (Williamsburg, crown heights, PLG and Bushwick) and we tend to go out mostly in Bushwick. I’m a good balance of homebody and sociable. 

My priorities in a living situation are - 
1. close to parks (my dog is very active, we like to run together)
2. spacious (dog, WFH, hosting family and friends when they visit)
3. better commute to work 
4. safe in the evenings (coming home alone, walking dog after late night out)

Both apartments are recently updated with similar amenities and travel time to Manhattan. Here are some notes about each unit:

1. BedStuy 
    1. More expensive by $100 and smaller
    2. more centrally located in Brooklyn 
    3. G Train is main line 
    4. Dishwasher, I cook a lot 

2. PLG 
    1. Significantly larger with way more closet space 
    2. Further out, I wonder if it’ll be harder to run home and check on dog if I’m gonna be out and about 

My apprehension about the BedStuy location is that it is smaller/more expensive and seems just as inconvenient by transit aside from parts of Williamsburg and Bushwick. Does the G train suck that bad? Would being technically more central in BK balance out the distance of PLG?

There is so much storage and closet space. The backyard is concrete, but it was plenty of space for our dog to run around and kids to ride their bikes. We had a big music studio in the garage for a little while, and our spectrum  Wi-Fi reached fine outback as well.

The balcony has such a beautiful view of Los Angeles. And the balcony itself is pretty spacious. It currently has four chairs out there. We’ve had coffee and drink drinks with friends and it never feels too crowded. There’s also a wet bar just inside to refill on drinks.

There’s a lot of great restaurants and shops to walk to. It’s not too far walking distance from Westwood Village. There’s a few theaters and pretty much everything else you need in walking distance as well. 

The elementary zone school district is top 10 in Los Angeles and top 50 in all of California.

Even though the map shows that we’re not too far from Santa Monica Blvd., the street is really quiet. Our neighbors just up the block usually play soccer on the street with their kids.

Butterball: This one pleasantly surprised me - way back when I had the perfume oil, it was way too musty or heady or floral or something for me. This liquid Butterball smelt of milk chocolate to me at first, a comforting smell definitely similar to Snuggles. Over time it became a bit more floral but thankfully for me it didn’t lose the chocolate smell - so it smelt kind of like milk chocolate and flowers. It is more mild than the others but it has been lingering for many hours now, and I want to keep it / possibly layer it with other scents.

Cinders: This was the most pleasant and interesting in how quickly it progressed. What I mean is on initial spray it smelled of marzipan and I was like oh crud I snowcaked myself after all, but within a moment it smelled strongly of rich cherry, which I do still associate with almond but like better than straight marzipan. Super quickly after that note suddenly it smelt of the red hots cinnamon candy but with maybe a bit more natural or mild feel to it. It was thankfully exactly what I was hoping for, which is a cinnamon scent without clove or any additions. It can be paired with other things easily and I’m excited to wear it in fall and winter. 

Milky Bath: It smelled like putting detergent on my body and I could smell the patchouli note like I could in the jelly - it was nothing like the subtle, beautiful, clean smell of the bubble bar or soap. This was a disappointment but I hope others will enjoy it.

Old Songs: This was a total blind buy for me as I never had the scrub. I hate it! It’s like Snow Fairy with a touch of the Comforter, which has always made me feel sick. I’m thankful I didn’t get the scrub off Mercari ever. I like a bit of Snow Fairy and I think the scrub smells a bit like banana candy which I do like. So… my reaction to Old Songs seems a bit like how a lot of people feel about Snow Fairy, ironically.

The bees knees solid: This is one of the most interesting things I’ve ever smelt, like honey wildflowers leaves wood forest etc but then it became overly sweet and smelt almost entirely of tobacco alone. That isn’t an acceptable dry down scent for me to smell and smell like all day so it has to go back. 

In case useful to others as a point of reference, these are perfumes and body sprays I love(d):

So White, Turmeric Latte, V, American Cream, Sex Bomb, Zesty (Calacas), Orange Blossom (original with ylang ylang not bergamot), WWLD, the Olive Branch, Twilight, Frozen, HIWTK, Princess Cottongrass, Furze

Newer loves:

 LTGTR (French vanilla ice cream, chocolate jimmies, slight hint of maraschino cherry)

Chelsea Morning (lemony bakery with a WWLD-esque dry-down)

Pansy lotion (although I dislike the perfume, this smells just like a really fresh/floral/juicy/beautiful Olive Branch & Celebrate love child).

Ambivalent: Love, Dad’s Garden Chamomile & Honeysuckle, Kerbside Violet, Amelie Mae, Sun, Dirty, Junk, Grass, Cardamum Coffee, Sticky Dates, Sakura, Plum Rain, Big, Mr Wallet, Rose Jam

Hate: Vanillary, Karma, Yog Nog, Lust, Lord of Misrule, Tank Battle, Smell of Weather Turning, Devil’s Nightcap, Death & Decay, Alina, No Way to Say Goodbye, Salty, The Comforter, Avocado Cowash

Side note (if anyone got this far): Is there anyone who feels that OUAT actually lasts on them? Like there are for Sticky Dates?)

One more side note: the HIWTK candle barely smells like it to me. It’s sour and creamy @ same time. Definitely not keeping.",1,1733359269.0,LushCosmetics,0,1.0,False

Most people probably know Glitch in Tokyo & Osaka. They are known for their nice coffee and the dark-ish (?) vibes in their shops.

This shop is different. It really has a relaxing vibe, completely different from Glitch’s main shops. It feels like just drinking coffee at a friend’s house. I don’t know the ownership situation completely, but this shop is staffed by Glitch baristas and has Glitch beans. 

Nadoya no Katte was built from a refurbished Japanese house in a residential area. There’s virtually no queue. The only con is that it only opens on weekends and holidays.",6,1733359247.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

1h6w6rf,https://i.redd.it/x4lws38tex4e1.jpeg,The best Turkish coffee is made in WoW,"In the heart of Azeroth, an intrepid coffee master named Mehmet the Bold discovered a legendary secret: roasting coffee beans over the fiery depths of the Molten Core. One day, while adventuring near the core, he accidentally dropped his precious beans into the blazing lava. To his astonishment, instead of burning, the beans roasted to perfection, infused with the raw power of Ragnaros himself.

The brew that resulted was extraordinary—bold, intense, and unmatched by any mere mortal drink. News spread quickly through the realms, and heroes from all corners of Azeroth flocked to Mehmet’s hidden café, eager to taste the legendary coffee.

To keep up with demand, Mehmet devised an ingenious system: he built a series of enchanted pipes and mystical kettles to channel the searing lava directly from the Molten Core into his roasters. As the beans roasted over the fiery heat, the aroma was so enchanting that even the mightiest dragons took notice.

The resulting coffee had the smoothness of a lava flow and the power of a volcanic eruption. It became so famous that even King Varian Wrynn himself made a special journey to the café, declaring it the ""Official Coffee of Stormwind."" And so, Turkish coffee roasted over the Molten Core's lava became a cherished tradition among the heroes of Azeroth.",2,1733359192.0,wow,0,0.75,False

1h6w53s,https://www.reddit.com/r/cincinnati/comments/1h6w53s/i_asked_chatgpt_to_roast_the_burbs/,I asked ChatGPT to roast the 'burbs ...,"Alright, let’s dive into a playful roast of the suburbs of Cincinnati, including Northern Kentucky:

1. Mason: Ah, the land of Kings Island and endless strip malls. Mason prides itself on being “family-friendly,” but let’s be real: the only thing “thrilling” here is the traffic jam on the way to the amusement park. If you like your excitement in the form of a rollercoaster, this is your spot — otherwise, good luck finding a pulse.


2. Blue Ash: The only thing “blue” about Blue Ash is the color of your face as you try to stay awake through another boring business meeting at one of the town's many corporate headquarters. The biggest perk? The closest thing to a nightlife scene is the local Applebee's, where people still talk about ""the good old days.""


3. West Chester: A suburban wasteland of strip malls and chain restaurants where you can live for years without having a single interesting conversation. It’s basically the suburban equivalent of beige — a whole town just waiting for a personality makeover. Everyone’s just happy to have a Target.


4. Cincinnati (Suburban) Downtown: The ""suburbs"" of downtown Cincinnati are as if the city tried really hard to be cool but ended up settling for overpriced condos and hipster coffee shops with more exposed brick than personality. You’ll pay extra for the privilege of standing in a long line at Findlay Market, and the chances of actually finding parking are about as good as running into an actual “local.”


5. Florence, Kentucky: Florence claims to be “the gateway to the south,” but let’s be honest — it’s more like the entryway to “meh.” If you ever want to experience a world where time stands still and gas stations are a legitimate form of entertainment, Florence is your place. The highlight of the year is when the mall is slightly less empty.


6. Covington: The only place where people act like crossing the river into Kentucky is a great adventure. Covington, you’re cute with your historic buildings, but the only time someone’s actually excited to visit is when they’re either in a deep craving for chili or on a low-key quest for cheap bourbon.


7. Erlanger: A town where the most exciting thing happening is when someone replaces the old Denny’s sign with a new one. Erlanger has all the charm of an airport parking lot, but without the convenience of flying anywhere interesting. You’ll spend your whole visit wondering why you’re even there.


8. Indian Hill: The country club capital of the suburbs, where everyone’s so rich that they don’t even need to try to act like they have a personality. You can tell who lives here because they’ll remind you. Not by their clothes, but by the way they talk about “investment portfolios” and how they “summer in the Hamptons.”


9. Anderson Township: The quietest place on earth where even the crickets are getting bored. Anderson is what happens when a town gets a little too content with its middle-aged suburban life. It’s the kind of place where you can drive around for hours and never once think, “This is definitely the highlight of my day.”


10. Oakley: Ah, Oakley, where everyone pretends they’re too cool for the suburbs but ends up at the same trendy coffee shop with a side of judgment. It’s the town where the mix of “artsy” apartment buildings and overpriced yoga studios just screams, “I’m trying to be different, but I’m really not.”


11. Hebron: Where you’ll find the most excitement in a trip to the airport or a visit to the nearest Walmart. Hebron’s charm is all in its ability to make you forget you’re even there. It’s the suburban version of “it’s fine” — there’s nothing wrong with it, but there’s absolutely nothing to do either.


12. Newport, Kentucky: Once a sketchy, underdog town, Newport is now trying a little too hard to be ""up-and-coming."" It's the place where you go to ""experience the culture"" but end up just walking around a revitalized boardwalk like you're in a slightly more depressing version of an amusement park. The only thing booming here is the occasional fight over parking spaces.



There you have it — the Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky suburbs, where things are always just a bit slower, a bit quieter, and a bit more... predictable. But hey, that’s what makes them lovable, right?

But for the past two months, the heat has not worked for our apartment at all. I now have a 3 month old newborn who spent his first month in the nicu, finally home. Our rent is normally due anywhere from the 1st to the 6th. Ever since it first started getting chilly, we noticed our heat never worked. We told the apartment manager and everything else but they ignored it and still to this day, it’s not fixed yet. When I told them AGAIN, two weeks ago, they brought a space heater for a two bedroom and 2 bath apartment and said “sorry, it’s not working” now, we’re about to get a snow storm with temperatures down to 12 degrees and I have once again told them it needs fixed. I can’t have my newborn in a cold apartment. They once again ignored it, so I went and called the people higher up than them. All they said was “we’ve been aware of the issue” and those people brought us another small space heater. We’ve bought a few out of pocket and have kept the receipts for them. Because I’m about to tell them, they’re gonna reimburse me for the ones I’ve bought or take it out of the rent. The coffee shop below the apartment building, the woman that runs it said she hasn’t paid rent in three months because they refuse and still haven’t fixed the issues she has. Can I refuse to pay rent with them not fixing the issue, with me telling them multiple times it needs fixed? Can they evict us if we do refuse to pay? I just would like everyone’s opinions on this!! :) 


Also to mention, I know I said we’ve been in this apartment for about a year but we had moved apartments in the same building once we found out I was pregnant to a bigger one! The heat in our first apartment worked but this one does not. And not to mention, the AC also didn’t work during the summer months when I was 7 and 8 months pregnant and we had to buy air conditioners and we told them multiple times about the AC as well and they ignored all problems.

This will be a looong post. Please bear with me here. 
Coworker is 35f and I'm 25f. She knows im an out lesbian. I genuinely think she is a confused closeted lesbian who may not even know that herself. 

For 3 years we've had flirty banter that has gotten stronger and stronger from the day we met. 
I've asked to see her outside of work over the years but as she has 2 young kids she's never been able to. Her kids are her world and she doesn't really share them with anyone. There is one other colleague she introduced her kids to but that's because they attend the same swimming class. 

She has a boyfriend. (Yes. I KNOW) she talks about him a lot of how he makes her sad, and how she feels like she should 'Just stay with him' because she's had 2 kids. She says she 'Wonders what she did wrong to choose him' and is always saying shes the 'man of the house' etc. She's described them as roommates/ housemates before. It's not in the normal straight girl ranting about her boyfriend way, and more in a genuinely her relationship makes her sad kind of way. 

At work we find any stupid excuse to see eachother. If one is at the coffee machine the other will run over to snatch a 5 second convo. She'll tease me, bully me (playfully)  call me a nickname i hate. We lock eyes and smirk across the corridors for 10 whole seconds until the other is out of sight. She'll always catch my eye, even if I'm in a conversation with someone we find a way to make the other look. We just stare and stare and smirk and grin and we can't keep our eyes off eachother. I've never had chemistry with someone like this before. I work in a hotel. She will check the clean rooms and I'll text her to ask where she is, and instead of a generic floor (Which is what she tells all my other colleagues) she texts me the EXACT NUMBER of the room she is in so we can 'check rooms' together which means flirt and chat whilst pretending to do the job. Our other colleagues tease us and tell us to just get a room already etc. 

Shes shy and English is not her first language  (she's like 80 percent fluent) we became good friends fast and have coffee every morning in her office. We will say the same thing at the same time. I tell her she's pretty or i like her hair and she grins at me. She calls me a nickname I hate, when something goes wrong she will (jokingly) tell everyone its my fault and grin. She comes to find me to tell stuff, we take our breaks together and she remembers how I like my coffee. She makes a joke that I'm 'Her English' and that im also her 'Private Teacher' once she asked me to help her check an email she sent, but got me to 'double check' she 'spelt her own name correctly' which... Was a little odd and makes me think she's flirting as she's always doing ridiculous stuff like that with a sly grin.

 I've met her kids once, she took pics and videos of us together at her house as she invited me over as i was in the area waiting in the rain for the bus and she drove me home instead. She confided in me that she's scared they won't learn English well and sent me a pic of their report cards. I gave some advice and tried to calm her down. That was months ago.

We have an inside joke that i don't like blondes (shes a brunette) and that she doesn't like shorties (im short) and we will bring this up from time to time. She teases me for being short, and I'll always tease her for random stuff. If she wants something basic like even a sheet of paper I won't give it to her unless she 'Asks' me 'nicely' and she bats her eyelashes and goes 'Pleeeeeaaase' its our little game. 

Sometimes she will send me random selfies or give me updates about her day and text. She hates texting. 

She never wants to do anything outside of work because shes so busy with her kids  and she's shy. However this week has been weird. Its like something changed in her. She invited me out with her kids after work. So after spending 8 hours together she invited me to spend time with just her and her 4 year old who she's told all about me (I only met him the once)  this happened 3 days in a row, each time at the end of our shift. We went around the christmas market and she told her kid to go on one of the rides with me instead of her. She was taking pictures and videos the whole time and i took pics of her from our perspective. Then we went to the bar and she bought me and her a beer. I joked I've been trying to buy her a drink for 3 years and finally its happened. 
I sat on the opposite side leaving space the other side of the bench so she and her kid could sit down but instead she sat right next to me and we drank our beer we cheersed and took selfies with all of us in. She kept reminding her kid that i was there and that i was nice etc. 

The next day, same thing. We went to a cafe and she bought me a hot chocolate. But she batted her eyelashes and begged me to order for her because im 'English' and she said 'Pleeeeease' like we do at work so i could ask for cream and marshmallows. she let me take pics of her all happy with her hot chocolate. She teased me saying i melted all the marshmallows in her hot chocolate on purpose etc. She took lots of pics of me and her kid again. 

I noticed she sent the pics to someone and she told me she was sending pics of me and the kid to her family group chat and that they knew about me from the time i came over in the rain. Her family don't live here so it makes sense she'd have a chat but i didn't know they knew about me existing. She then also invited HERSELF over to my house when her kid said he wanted to meet my dog. I thought she was joking as she said 'Oh we' ll go tommorow' in the way you tell little kids stuff so they'll stop annoying you kind of thing. BUT SHE MEANT IT. 

the next day she waited for me with her kid again, and drove me to my house. While she was parking she said it wasn't 'Straight' and i make a joke saying 'Well, not everything here is either' and she flashed me a grin, and rolled her eyes and muttered my nickname whilst smiling telling me to shut up. She joked her English is getting goood because she's spending soooo much time with me and that no one has to know we're spending so much time together. 

I have deep red hair and she showed me her Christmas nails, which are (as she pointed out) the same colour as my hair. She also wore a shirt that day which was the same colour as well and got so excited when a colleague said we matched. 

She's joked that she knows where i used to live, and she also took a picture of my perfume so she could buy it herself. 
After her maternity leave last year her forst day back she demanded our colleagues take a photoshoot of us back together. 

Sorry it was sooo long. I just think its a bit odd as she doesn't introduce her kids to people and is very protective of them. I also am just a coworker who doesn't have any reason to interact with her kids (Like the other colleague who has a kid who swims) and i only met him the one time but he knows all about me. 

I think i really like her but she has a boyfriend and kids, and shes my colleage but i don't know what to do now. It feels like she's making me a part of her kids lives and her flirting is so weird?? I really think she's questioning and don't know what to do. Please no comments saying don't date your colleague, i know.

So after spending 8 hours together she invited me to spend time with just her and her 4 year old who she's told all about me (I only met him the once)  this happened 3 days in a row, each time at the end of our shift. We went around the christmas market and she told her kid to go on one of the rides with me instead of her. She was taking pictures and videos the whole time and i took pics of her from our perspective. Then we went to the bar and she bought me and her a beer. I joked I've been trying to buy her a drink for 3 years and finally its happened. 
I sat on the opposite side leaving space the other side of the bench so she and her kid could sit down but instead she sat right next to me and we drank our beer we cheersed and took selfies with all of us in. She kept reminding her kid that i was there and that i was nice etc. 

The next day, same thing. We went to a cafe and she bought me a hot chocolate. But she batted her eyelashes and begged me to order for her because im 'English' and she said 'Pleeeeease' like we do at work so i could ask for cream and marshmallows. she let me take pics of her all happy with her hot chocolate. She teased me saying i melted all the marshmallows in her hot chocolate on purpose etc. She took lots of pics of me and her kid again. 

I noticed she sent the pics to someone and she told me she was sending pics of me and the kid to her family group chat and that they knew about me from the time i came over in the rain. Her family don't live here so it makes sense she'd have a chat but i didn't know they knew about me existing. She then also invited HERSELF over to my house when her kid said he wanted to meet my dog. I thought she was joking as she said 'Oh we' ll go tommorow' in the way you tell little kids stuff so they'll stop annoying you kind of thing. BUT SHE MEANT IT. 

the next day she waited for me with her kid again, and drove me to my house. While she was parking she said it wasn't 'Straight' and i make a joke saying 'Well, not everything here is either' and she flashed me a grin, and rolled her eyes and muttered my nickname whilst smiling telling me to shut up. She joked her English is getting goood because she's spending soooo much time with me and that no one has to know we're spending so much time together. 

I have deep red hair and she showed me her Christmas nails, which are (as she pointed out) the same colour as my hair. She also wore a shirt that day which was the same colour as well and got so excited when a colleague said we matched. 

She's joked that she knows where i used to live, and she also took a picture of my perfume so she could buy it herself. 
After her maternity leave last year her forst day back she demanded our colleagues take a photoshoot of us back together. 

Sorry it was sooo long. I just think its a bit odd as she doesn't introduce her kids to people and is very protective of them. I also am just a coworker who doesn't have any reason to interact with her kids (Like the other colleague who has a kid who swims) and i only met him the one time but he knows all about me. 

I think i really like her but she has a boyfriend and kids, and shes my colleage but i don't know what to do now. It feels like she's making me a part of her kids lives and her flirting is so weird?? I really think she's questioning and don't know what to do. Please no comments saying don't date your colleague, i know.

Misery: I- No, I didn't steal your chapstick. We use the same chapstick. 

Mii: No, there is absolutely no way we use the same chapstick, because it was only sold on one Etsy shop two years ago and they discontinued it, and I loved it so much that I bought the last of their stock, and I keep it in my freezer so it doesn't go bad. It's been discontinued for three years. No one uses the same chapstick for three years.

Sally: Every time I hear someone talking about updog, I’m torn between not wanting to fall for it and wanting to help them complete their joke. 

Kanade: Okay, but what is updog? 

Yui: Updog is a long sausage in a bun, often served with ketchup, mustard, onions, and/or relish. 

Maple: No, that’s a hot dog. An updog is when a new version or patch of an application is released. 

Kasumi: No, that's an update. You’re thinking of the fourth largest city in Sweden. 

Mai: Surely, that’s Uppsala, where’s updog is the giant spider in Harry Potter. 

Sally: That’s Aragog. Updog is a symbol conventionally used for an arbitrarily small number in analysis proofs. 

Maple: You’re thinking of epsilon. Updog is an upward-moving air current. 

Yui: No, that’s an updraft. An updog is the modern version of a henway. 

Kanade: What’s a henway?? 

Sally: Oh, about five pounds.



Sally: Question, how difficult would it be to bowl in a bee suit? 

Maple: Not that hard, I don't think, as long as you can move. 

Mai: I'd assume as hard as it is to bowl in a maid outfit. 

Mai: Wouldn't be any harder, but you'd get some WEIRD looks. 

Kasumi: Are. Are you speaking from experience. 

Mai: No! 

Mai: 

Mai: ....Maybe.

Maple: I may be stupid. 

The Squad: ... 

Maple: Oh, did you think I was going to finish that sentence?



Chrome, staring at Mai in a cage: ...Why are they in a cage? 

Sally: Because they growled at me.



Yui: How are we supposed to put a tracker the size of a penny on Maple without them noticing? 

Kanade: Hey, Maple, I bet you 5 bucks that you can't swallow this penny. 

Maple: \**takes and swallows tracker*\* Pay up, loser. 

Yui: ...



Yui: We wouldn’t last two minutes without Maple. 

Yui: 

Yui: Don’t tell them I said that.



Sally: Kanade, say aluminum again. It's the entire source of my serotonin during these trying times. 

Kanade: \*sigh\* Only for you, buddy. Alyoouminnieeum.



Chrome: Did you like the food I made? 

Mai: No, not really. 

Chrome: But I put my heart and soul into it! 

Mai: No wonder it tastes so cold and dead.



Maple: Firstly, how dare you use mathematics to make me look stupid! 

Maple: I’m actually very good at mathematics. 

Maple: Thirdly, I think you might be right.



Kanade: Do you always have to attack me with your words? 

Mai: Would you prefer me to use a brick?



Kanade: Why would you think any of this was a good idea?! 

Mai: Probably because I’m a dangerous sociopath with a long history of violence. 

Kanade: Oh... 

Maple, from across the room: I don’t understand how you keep forgetting that.



Maple: Everything will be ok. You can not stop it. 

Maple: Everything will be fine. You have no choice. 

Iz: What kind of pep talk is that? 

Maple: Ominous positivity.



Yui, walking into Maple and Sally’s bedroom in the middle of the night: I had a bad dream. 

Maple: What was it about? 

Sally: No, don’t ask them that! 

Maple: Why not? 

Sally: Cause they’ll answer!



Chrome: Truth or dare? 

Yui: Truth! 

Chrome: Do you- 

Mai: I dare you to kiss me. 

Yui: \*kisses Mai\* 

Chrome, to Maple: They said “truth”, right?

(WHY IS THIS SHIP SO FUNNY? IT’S NOT EVEN A PROPER SHIP?)  
  


Sally: Kanade noticed only today that they can label their email inboxes, but they took apart their entire bloody laptop two weeks ago. 

Yui: This reminds me of the Kanade who couldn’t turn on the coffee maker, but remembers about 500 digits of pi. 

Sally: I’ll be delighted to inform you that this is the very same Kanade.

All the money were arguing about is my own money that I worked for. To summarize, after years of arguing back and forth and tears, last month we decided to l compromise with me getting a 200 a month budget and everything else goes to my savings. I thought everything would be fine considering the old budget used to be 100 or the occasional 50 every two weeks. At the end of the month I had 20 dollars left and I specifically chose not to spend it because December is holiday season and I need all the money I can because if I were to ask for extra money I would get an hour long lecture and still no extra cash. When December 1st came I checked my bank account and saw he only gave me 180. I was confused and went to confront my dad about it and he literally went ballistic. We had a screaming match back and forth because he was so upset about me wanting my full amount and my mom was agreeing with me instead of him and he gave up and gave me my missing amount. 

3 days later he asks me if I want anything from amazon and I give him a link to this hair product that is 45 dollars but it’s one of those treatments that last for months making it worth the investment. I ask him to see if he was actually going to buy it (because he’s so cheap I can never ask him for anything) and he gives me a lecture about how it would take me 5 hours to work for it and saying i’m terrible at money. Mind you he freaks out anytime I want to purchase anything over 20 dollars. In my 4 years of highschool I have yet to buy myself a piece of clothing. Then he goes on about “YOU WANT TO WASTE YOUR MONEY FINE” and he says he went to the bank to try to turn over my saving accounts (I did not have access to them at all) to me claiming that he was “DONE” with me and done with trying to help yadda yadda. 

This by far not the first argument we had about how I spend my own money. Guys when I tell you I am more financially responsible than probably 80 percent of teenagers. Quite literally the only thing I spend my money on is food when I hang with friends. There was a time when he gave me the silent treatment for a week and tried to ban me  from hanging out after school because I got a coffee from starbucks because he doesn’t see it as a “worthy” purchase. And last month I said I had a 40 dollar budget to get my friend a birthday gift and he screamed at me and said that if I did that he would refuse to give me money again. The month before that one, I went to homecoming and at dinner the bill was a bit more expensive than I thought it was going to be and it rang up to about 50 dollars and the next morning he gives me the stinkiest a look and bashes me for not researching if there was an automatic gratuity tip beforehand and shoos me out of his room.Luckily my mom is there to balance out his crazy because I don’t know what I would do without her.",1,1733358720.0,AmItheAsshole,8,1.0,False

1h6vwey,https://www.reddit.com/r/Waiters/comments/1h6vwey/awkward_situation_with_a_waitress/,Awkward situation with a waitress,"I’ve been a regular customer at a café where I’ve interacted with a particular waitress. Initially, she seemed somewhat nervous but still friendly towards me. We exchanged polite pleasantries, and I made efforts to be approachable and engage in friendly conversation. However, after a particular incident, her behavior towards me began to change.

At one point, I tried speaking to her in Ukrainian, knowing she is from Ukraine, as a way to be friendly and respectful. I had been practicing the language, but I accidentally spoke some Russian instead, which I quickly realized. She seemed upset by the mistake, and her attitude towards me noticeably shifted. I felt bad about the misunderstanding, so I later apologized to her in Ukrainian, explaining that I didn’t mean to offend her. She accepted my apology, and I noticed she became a bit warmer towards me afterward. Despite this, there still seemed to be some underlying tension, and her behavior remained somewhat reserved.

I also tried to show my appreciation by offering her a small gift, an Orthodox icon that I had bought from a Romanian woman on the train. However, she refused the gift, and I noticed that her demeanor changed even more after that. She became distant and appeared uncomfortable in my presence. On one occasion, when I asked a colleague for more coffee, she overheard and asked, “What does he want?!” in an exasperated tone, followed by the sound of dishes rustling. This response made me feel uncertain and uncomfortable, as I wasn’t sure why she reacted that way. I didn’t receive any direct response from her during the incident, which left me feeling dismissed.

There were also times when she seemed to go out of her way to serve me, even when other colleagues could have done so. On one occasion, when I was ready to pay, another colleague could have easily handled the transaction, but she stepped in and served me instead. This happened several times, and while I appreciated the service, it made me wonder if she was trying to maintain some level of connection with me, despite her apparent discomfort.

I should also mention that I am autistic, and I sometimes have difficulty interpreting non-verbal cues, which might contribute to misunderstandings. I also know that many people have commented on my appearance, saying I am very handsome, which could unintentionally intimidate others or cause them to misread my intentions. I’m not sure if that’s contributing to her discomfort, but I’ve noticed that I sometimes come across as intense or overly direct, which could make others feel unsure about how to engage with me.

Additionally, after the gift was refused and I made the coffee request, I noticed that she often looked at me quickly and then lowered her gaze, which added to my feeling of uncertainty. Her responses were short and professional, leaving me unsure if I had misinterpreted something or made her feel uncomfortable again.

I’ve continued to try to maintain a polite, friendly demeanor, but the situation has made me feel increasingly uncertain. It’s hard for me to understand whether the shift in her behavior is because of my language mistake, the gift, my appearance, or if there’s something else causing her discomfort.

Despite my efforts to be open and friendly, I’m finding it challenging to gauge the situation. I’ve considered addressing the issue directly with her to understand what’s going on, but I’m hesitant to make things worse or create further tension. I want to respect her space while ensuring that I’m still able to enjoy my time at the café without feeling awkward.",0,1733358390.0,Waiters,5,0.33,False

I always believe that Love doesn't hurt but loving the wrong person does. But as the title goes, you never hurt the person you love (used to) even it breaks you from the core.

It looks easy but definitely hard, when you feel betrayed and never in the world you would imagine that the people you expect would protect you are the ones who ruined you in every possible ways.  I think the rule of the thumb is very simple.
When there are more tears than smiles, leave. When there are more fights than jokes, leave. When it hurts more than it feels good, leave. They don't have the right to destroy you just because you love them. And loving them doesn't mean you have to stay.

There will be very painful moments in your life that will change your entire world in a matter of minutes. These moments will change you.
Let them make you stronger, smarter, and kinder instead. But don't you go and become someone that you're not. Cry if you must. Scream if you have to. But never let your emotions eat you up, do something stupid and regret it afterwards.

I'm slowly learning that even I react, it won't change anything, it won't make people suddenly love and respect me, it won't magically change their minds. Sometimes It's better to just let things be, let people go, don't fight for closure, don't ask for explanations, don't chase answers and don't expect people to understand where you're coming from. Life  is better lived when you don't center it on what's happening around you and center it on what's happening inside you instead.

I am slowly learning how to forgive the past. How to accept that sometimes beautiful things end, that sometimes the timing isn't right, that sometimes the messiness of life gets in the way. I am slowly learning that endings aren't something to be upset about, but rather, I am slowly learning how to appreciate how damn lucky I was to experience something real and hopeful and light in a world that sometimes fails to be soft.
I am slowly learning how to be alone. I am slowly learning how to wake up in the middle of the bed. How to make just one cup of coffee in the mornings. How to hold my own heart, how to take up my own space. I am slowly learning how to stop filling voids with other human beings, and instead, I am slowly learning how to confront the void itself. How to heal it.

The following days won't be easy but we have to realize that, Genuine love is when someone hurts you, but because you care about that person so much you choose not to hurt them in return. Hence, Love doesn't hurt but loving the wrong person does..

Food will be a very big focus. I’ve posted on the Chicago food group but only got some feedback. Here are some of my ideas: 

One key dinner I want is somewhere with a classic old school Chicago feel. I’ve looked at La Scarola but heard the service concerns. Others that have come up are Mart Anthony, ignotz, All vita, Elina’s, Formento’s, rose Mary? I am probably leaning to Mart Anthony.

In June, me (21m) and my ex (21f) called it quits after almost 3 years. We started dating in September of our freshman year of college, and we are now seniors. Overall, I think we had a lot of good memories but we both kinda grew to hate each other our Junior year. We had some problems leading up to it but one argument finally lit the fuse.

While I was blindsided, I understand it was necessary for the both us. I became overbearing and she stopped doing the bare minimum. I did a lot of shitty things and had a bad attitude but I was always supportive and never unfaithful or abusive. However, over the past year or so I have been dealing with some serious family issues and it completely destroyed my confidence/mental health. While I was trying to keep my family together, I was also the treasurer for my fraternity. It became way too stressful and I burned out, big time. She was always helpful and got me into therapy/on meds, but it eventually became too much. Our junior year, I turned to weed, alcohol, and porn as a coping mechanism. I did my best to keep it together, but I really lost my compass as a person and didn't fulfill my role as a boyfriend. 

While she was mostly supportive and loving, I am still bitter about the way she ended things. We were in long distance at the time and one night we had a big fight and she ended our relationship over the phone. I couldn't handle it, and had to spend 6 days at the psych ward immediately after. 

Now, I am more understanding and think that the break up was necessary, but she was so cruel about it. While I was in the psych ward, she immediately deleted all of our pictures, followed every single boy I was worried about during our relationship, and then never spoke to me again. I recognize the courage it must have taken to initiate the break up, but I never received closure. All while I was suffering and trying to get through it, she was posting all over social media like nothing ever happened.

I had a really tough time returning to school and this semester has been, by far, the roughest yet. We both blocked each other on social media, but we agreed to keep iMessage open. In October, my parents (in their 60s), divorced suddenly. At this point, I was basically losing my mind. We texted back and forth and she offered some words of support, but that's it. Other than that, we have basically been in No Contact since July and I am still having an awful experience.

I just wanted to preface by saying I completely recognize my faults in the relationship and respect her call to break up. As much as I didn't want it to happen, I know it should've and maybe sooner. I will always love her and the memories we shared together. She was my best friend and I have never been closer with anyone else in my life.

Now, we are still in no contact and I have mostly been able to move on - I am talking to new girls and I know for a fact she is talking to new boys. But, that's beside the point. My main dilemma is that I no longer enjoy going to school here, and I don't think I will return next semester. I live across the country, so I know once I leave, I will probably never see her again. I still deeply care about her and while we are in NC, I think a part of her still cares about me. She still interacts with my sister on instagram and they occasionally text back and forth, but us two are not on speaking terms. 

\*\*My question is- Do I tell her I won't return next semester? Do I leave without saying anything? Do I ask to meet for coffee? Do I give her stuff back? I don't want to interrupt her healing but knowing that I will never see her again is daunting. I am still pretty upset with her decisions, but I feel like it would be disrespectful to leave without saying anything. PLEASE HELP!!!

Wanted to share my update. I drank 1-3 cups of coffee every day for about 12 years and was quite sensitive, if I had any after 11am I wouldn’t be able to sleep at night. 

The first month was a struggle. I went cold turkey because I knew I would bargain my way back on it if I tapered. I had a week off so I used that time to recover and sleep. 

I drank decaf every morning for the first month for cravings and now I don’t even like the taste. I have herbal tea instead. 

I struggled with an insane appetite, sugar cravings and weight gain for the first month. That’s all levelled out. Intermittent fasting has helped. I did experience depression for the first month which is ok now. No change in weight now. 

The biggest benefit was to my sleep. Sleep just feels the way natured intended. 

Fall asleep easier, sleep more deeply, dream more vividly. Can nap easily — I was never a napper on caffeine. I also wake up easier and way earlier resulting in getting to work earlier. I don’t feel like a truck has hit me when I wake up anymore. I also don’t get as many night terrors anymore! However if I don’t get enough sleep the night before, I’m screwed.

Workouts are less intense, still struggling with that. 

Skin is less oily. Nails are stronger and longer. I think I see new baby hairs. 

I feel calmer, less reactive, moods are stable, no anxiety. It’s easier to empathize with and listen to people. I feel generally less chaotic. 

I can focus on tasks more deeply at work. 3pm crash isn’t a thing anymore. Finding motivation to start tasks sucks now though. Random but my email inbox is cleaner. I don’t get nervous presenting anymore. 

Good luck everyone. ",6,1733356089.0,decaf,2,1.0,False

I always believe that Love doesn't hurt but loving the wrong person does. But as the title goes, you never hurt the person you love (used to) even it breaks you from the core.

It looks easy but definitely hard, when you feel betrayed and never in the world you would imagine that the people you expect would protect you are the ones who ruined you in every possible ways.  I think the rule of the thumb is very simple.
When there are more tears than smiles, leave. When there are more fights than jokes, leave. When it hurts more than it feels good, leave. They don't have the right to destroy you just because you love them. And loving them doesn't mean you have to stay.

There will be very painful moments in your life that will change your entire world in a matter of minutes. These moments will change you.
Let them make you stronger, smarter, and kinder instead. But don't you go and become someone that you're not. Cry if you must. Scream if you have to. But never let your emotions eat you up, do something stupid and regret it afterwards.

I'm slowly learning that even I react, it won't change anything, it won't make people suddenly love and respect me, it won't magically change their minds. Sometimes It's better to just let things be, let people go, don't fight for closure, don't ask for explanations, don't chase answers and don't expect people to understand where you're coming from. Life  is better lived when you don't center it on what's happening around you and center it on what's happening inside you instead.

I am slowly learning how to forgive the past. How to accept that sometimes beautiful things end, that sometimes the timing isn't right, that sometimes the messiness of life gets in the way. I am slowly learning that endings aren't something to be upset about, but rather, I am slowly learning how to appreciate how damn lucky I was to experience something real and hopeful and light in a world that sometimes fails to be soft.
I am slowly learning how to be alone. I am slowly learning how to wake up in the middle of the bed. How to make just one cup of coffee in the mornings. How to hold my own heart, how to take up my own space. I am slowly learning how to stop filling voids with other human beings, and instead, I am slowly learning how to confront the void itself. How to heal it.

The following days won't be easy but we have to realize that, Genuine love is when someone hurts you, but because you care about that person so much you choose not to hurt them in return. Hence, Love doesn't hurt but loving the wrong person does..",2,1733355649.0,u_Tortang_Talong_Ftw,1,1.0,False

I know everyone has a different experience; here is mine to help you plan.

 

Age 58, male, BMI 25. Widespread premature osteoarthritis due to haemochromatosis.

 

Pre operation function – I had been walking for a limp for about a year, and using a pole for hiking and longer distances. At the time of the operation I could still swim without difficulty, and could walk 5km at a reasonable pace as long as I had dosed up on ibuprofen before hand, used a walking pole, and accepted the rest of the day would be spent carefully. Longer walks (10ks) could be done but required teeth gritting, and the pleasure was in the outcome ( eg a view) rather than iin the walking itself.

 

I could no longer run more than a few hundred metres at shuffling pace.

What prompted me to have the op was increasingly disrupted sleep, and a ski trip where every chairlift ride was painful enough to make the skiing a real chore. Got home from skiing and booked the surgery.

 

Procedure was anterior approach, Corin protocol. ( whatever that means…I didn’t ask too many questions).

 

Spinal, general anaesthesia and a block. Operation was at lunch time.

 

Day 1 – operation day – in bed.

Day 2- catheter out – up to shower, few steps with a frame. On Palexia (opiate) and indocid (non steroidal)  suppositories.

Day 3 – walking with stick, able to do a few stairs, carefully.

Day4 – home from hospital.

 

Most memorable hospital moment was removal of urinary catheter. That was surprisingly painful.

 

At home aids required were a walking stick and a higher chair. Did not need frame/toilet seat/ grabbers/ sock aids ( as it was summer and didn’t need to wear shoes.) Our toilet is next to natural handholds – sink etc – so getting up was OK.

 

After 1 week – able to walk 5 mins three times a day with stick. Off palexia and on paracetamol, Nurofen and lyrica for nerve pain. Main difficulty was sleep due to being stuck in a few positions, and the nerve pain. Day was mainly spend reclining reading and watching TV in between the three periods of rehab exercises. Leg was quite swollen and bruised. PT came to house twice a week.

 

After 2 weeks – walking 10 mins three times a day with stick.   Swelling and bruising subsiding. Nights still a problem, days much the same as before – more sitting and less reclining. Was able to help a bit with the housework – eg cook a meal, put on the washing.

 

After 3 weeks – walking 15 mins three times a day with stick. Exercise bike three times a a day. Doing partial squats. Leg still a bit swollen and able to sleep a bit better but still painful at night. Able to sit up at desk for an hour or two. Able to go to a coffee shop for an hour, but any longer need to stretch out and recline. Doing some work from home ( but not much). Able to hang out the washing. PT once a week.

 

After 4 weeks – (today)  walking 20 mins 3 times a day, not needing the stick. Able to do one legged mini squats on the operated side. Panadol three times a day – ibuprofen variable. Still have a large area of numbness and occasional nerve pain on the thigh, worse at night, sleeping well with lyrica (75mg) but poorly without. Ok to drive, plan to return to work half days. Most household chores OK, but not yet able to kneel and work in the garden. Planning to return to the office half days next week, full days the week after, but this will be flexible – only three days a week first few weeks.

 

So in summary I have luckily had a very smooth run. I think in my advantage were being relatively young, and still having good musculature and capability before the op. Also having a flexible desk job means a relatively easy return to work. I am certainly glad I had it done, and probably could have jumped a good 6 -12 months earlier. Probably I will get the other side done as soon as limping becomes constant, rather than putting up with it for a year.

 

I understand I have had good luck. It is always a roll of the dice, and if I had a complication I would be cursing my decision now, and there is no way of predicting the outcome before hand.

 

I have found this forum very helpful, although naturally it does skew towards people who have had problems, as is to be expected as many who have had an easy course like me won’t be looking for answers on the internet.

1h6uo33,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1h6uo33/aitah_for_thinking_i_deserved_an_explanation_for/,AITAH for thinking I deserved an explanation for a breakup.,"This happened a while ago but I'm still not okay with it all. 

I (22m) was dating this girl (24f) for just over 6 months it was the first serious relationship for both of us, we would say I love you and things were quite good for a time. 

She blindsided me one day with a phonecall saying she wanted to take a break, maybe until her sisters baby was born, still makes no sense to me but I think she ment things were a bit hectic at home with her family. She couldn't tell me anything else and I suggested we atleast meet and talk about it, which she agreed and came over. 

She basically was completely frozen up, not able to give me a word of explanation further then she doesn't know why and she wants to take a break. I basically said so we are broken up then? and she was only just able to essentially nod. 

I gave her space for a month thinking she would call. Finally I reached out asking to talk and she said we could. She then proceeded to dodge everytime I tried to set a time and date to meet up for coffee or just a phone call. She did not answer when I just tried to call her once or twice thinking we could talk over the phone. No explanation given. 

I finally ask her if she really wants to meet up to talk to me and she says she doesn't think she's ready. I really have allot to get off my chest at this point, I feel like I treated her poorly and with coved hitting in the last few months of our relationship I just felt like I had let things become stale and like we would hangout and have sex alot but thay I didn't put in effort to spend much genuine time with her. 

Even if she wasn't interested in me anymore I was not coping well having got no closure, no explanation, no word at all. I felt like this person I knew just dropped of the face of the planet. We always talked, the fact that she couldn't even answer the phone to talk for 10 minutes hurt and confused me deeply,  after all she said she wanted a break, I'm the one that said breakup. 

Here's were the AITAH comes in. At this point I felt I deserved an explanation, something, closure. Why could she not talk to me on the phone or at this point even over text. When I attempt to talk serious over text she ghosted the messages. I told her I was struggling to make sense of this and if she could please just give me something. Nothing. 

My mind was racing with speculation, I felt guilt for not being able to tell her my retrospective on our time together. I felt rejected and abandoned. I kept trying to message and kept trying to call. I would wait a month and then try again. She would say yes to meeting up to talk. I would then propose a time and she would leave it on read. This happened 2 or 3 times after concrete yes we can meet for a walk or a coffee. 

Like 3 months into this On my Birthday she sent me a text message Happy Birthday, even my closest friends just wrote on my facebook wall wtf. I persisted to Hassle her and even sent her a few videos(cringe) of me basically trying to show her my tone, I'm chill I just need some closure, can we please have a chat even just over text. Nothing. She continues to like my instagram posts ect. This whole time. I admit I went a little crazy there. 

Was I wrong to expect her to talk to me? She said she wanted a break. She gave me not one word of explanation for any of this. No 'I'm not in love with you', no 'it's not you it's me', nothing. 

In retrospective actions speak MUCH louder then words and I feel guilty and embarrassed that I persisted to hassle her. But I still think she could have spared me months of pain and embarrassment with literally a few text messages when I first contacted her after a month. If she just said 'I don't love you, stop contacting me' I would have known were I stood but nope.

In retrospective i still have no idea if she was ultimately confused, she was toying with me, or if she cared for me so little she paid it all such little attention. 

Blocked and deleted her on everything years ago so I could be free of going crazy over it. 

Thoughts?

Edit: I think I need to rephrase the question. I'm well aware I was an AH. My real question is was she an asshole for asking for a break rather then breaking up and then suspequently not following that up with any word or explanation on the topic at all for months.

1h6uih3,https://www.reddit.com/r/LesbianActually/comments/1h6uih3/i_dont_understand/,I don’t understand ,"So I have a friend. She last year cause a disagreement between us. I [F23] was living with her [F50] for a while. I didn’t know her when I moved in I was just renting part of her house. However, after passing on the courtyard in the evening most evenings we soon became friendly. She took me in as if I was her daughter when I had family issues. 

Around this time, she came across quite flirty and would often touch me. This could be a kind rub on the back of support, a cuddle, running her fingers through my hair and even sometimes running down my chest and across my breasts. She would sometimes after a drink or two tell me how pretty I was and how she liked me. While this was going on, her behaviour had been witnessed by my friends who quickly assumed and accused me of sleeping with her which wasn’t the case. And because of this behaviour and the actions got into my head and muddled with my feeling as well as my judgement on the situation.

We went out one evening. She got extremely drunk and me a little tipsy. After getting her home which wasn’t difficult she kept falling asleep on the couch. I told her it be a good idea if she went to bed and offered to help her up the stairs. My intentions was in her best interest and I wanted to leave her in bed where she was safe and I knew she’d be okay when I left to return home. However, she kept saying no and saying she “wasn’t gonna sleep” with me which I hadn’t even thought of at this point or at all. After an hour of arguing about it I gave up and said it’s fine if she didn’t wanna go to bed it’s her choice. Seeing I was upset she had followed me into the kitchen where she grabbed my face and kissed me. She was also rubbing her hands around my body. She told me I was pretty and that she liked me before kissing me again. She then pulled away, took my hand and took me back to my place. She kissed me goodnight and told me to go to bed and that she was finding the night very awkward and left. The next day when I spoke to her she had no memory of the night before and apologised for her actions as she said it wasn’t fair.

After this, I was left confused and upset as I was wanted one minute it seemed and not the next. She kept up with the touching and the flirting but then would back down. Unable to carry on I called her out one day and said I needed to know what was going on as I didn’t and it was causing issues. She however didn’t now what to say other then “sorry for messing with your head”. I then moved out.

After moving out we still kept in contact. I would pop and see her for coffee mornings or go and have tea with her but I wouldn’t go drinking as I found this to be an issue with us. However was still being flirty with. After telling her she was confusing me again I took a pause and didn’t see her for over a month. When I reached out to her again I found she wasn’t flirty. There was no touching. And everything was okay. Things have been going well for months. She has now adapted a pet name for me however.

I moved away for a short time for work but came home recently due to unexpected family circumstances. While I was away I found that I had daily messages from her and calls every other day witch was nice but also odd as when I was at home I was told she “couldn’t deal” with me on the daily. However, I think she was lonely and wanted someone to talk to in this time. I found the pet name became a standard over use in her messages. Her messages went from being blunt to “I miss you” and “I’m proud of you” which is something you don’t see from her as a person. 

Since coming home, I have found the touching has come back. The comments. I’m now finding she makes sexualised comments towards me. She’s got drunk and made it clear she has feelings for me but can’t admit it when she’s sober. She’s now pushed me away as the last time we were together she was all over me and kissing me and personally I don’t think she can admit to herself how or what she feels.

Am I over reacting here or is this just normal drunken behaviour? Even though it’s done sober? Am I right in thinking there’s something going on here? Or just over reacting? I don’t understand please give thoughts and opinions help me solve this puzzle ",1,1733354709.0,LesbianActually,3,0.6,False

I scored the maximum on a Dark Triad test, and I’ve been struggling with my inability to form relationships, particularly in finding a girlfriend. I’m 29, work as a software developer, and it’s been five years since I had a serious relationship.

About three years ago, I decided to try dating again, and that’s when things started to unravel for me mentally. I focused on self-improvement: I hit the gym, built a great physique, and became athletic. When I joined Tinder, I initially got matches, but none of the conversations led to anything meaningful. No one wanted to meet me in person, not even for something casual like coffee.

I wasn’t looking for anything overly serious—just some form of connection—but no matter what I tried, I couldn’t seem to gain anyone’s trust. Over time, my matches dwindled to zero, and even upgrading to Tinder Platinum didn’t make a difference. Frustrated, I tried TikTok, posting workout videos and messaging younger women (early twenties, which is the age range I’m most drawn to). But my efforts there backfired—some responses were outright negative, with women calling me “creepy” or telling me I was too old for them. I felt crushed, as though all the effort I’d put into self-improvement had been wasted.

This led me to some darker realizations. I started to believe that there might be something about me—something intangible—that women could instinctively sense and were avoiding. It felt like they could pick up on my underlying intentions, even when I tried to suppress or hide them. Over time, I began to internalize the idea that I might never be able to connect with anyone authentically, and I became resentful. I started blaming external forces, even going so far as to think that God or some higher power was actively working against me.

In my frustration, I turned to unhealthy coping mechanisms and began rationalizing manipulative behavior. I convinced myself that honesty wasn’t working, so I started lying about myself in order to appear more appealing. I would exaggerate my qualities, make up stories, and pretend to be someone I wasn’t, all to gain trust. To my surprise, this approach worked—women started showing interest, and I was finally able to get their attention.

However, this success came with a cost. I found myself leaning more into this deceptive persona and caring less about being genuine. I started using these tactics intentionally, and over time, I realized I was okay with this approach as long as it got me what I wanted. The darker part of me felt justified, even though I knew deep down that this wasn’t sustainable and would eventually hurt people emotionally.

Now, I feel like I’m spiraling out of control. I’m at a point where I can see the harm in what I’m doing, but I don’t know how to stop. I need someone to help me understand how to move forward because if I stay on this path, I fear I’ll end up doing damage—not just to others, but also to myself.",1,1733354513.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

We met online about 8 months ago, and have only hung out a handful of times 1 on 1. A week ago, we planned to go out for coffee. She shares a car so it’s harder to get around, so I have always been the one to drive out to her town which is 30 minutes away. Anyway, I made the 30 min drive to the coffee shop. Before our plans, she was helping her neighbor clean their house and she texted me saying it was taking longer than she anticipated. She told me if it takes any longer than 20 more mins, she’d tell the neighbor she had to leave so she could make our coffee shop plans. After 1 hour of me waiting, she texted me saying our plans just weren’t going to work today. Shes normally super passive and has a hard time speaking up, so I have a hunch she couldn’t work up the courage to tell her neighbor she had to leave. She was seemingly super apologetic and felt bad for bailing last minute.  I was annoyed, but it’s not the end of the world so whatever. Next day she invited me to a “holiday stroll” event to make up for it, which is tomorrow. She said her sister and her friend (who I never met) are coming as well. I agreed, and invited my husband to come along (who she never met). The reason I invited my husband to come is because he trains dogs, and he needed a busy environment with lots of distractions to work a specific dog around. I figured that’d be the perfect environment, and he could meet my friend then venture off and work the dog while I hang out with the group. I told my friend this, and she kind of jokingly said she’d feel like a third wheel, to which I joked back and said if anything we will both feel like third wheels because he’ll be working with a dog. She seemed okay with it otherwise. Next day she sent me the following text:
Hey ***, I just wanted to be upfront and honest with you about the event. I'm happy you're interested in the event, but I think I would feel a bit out of place walking with your husband, especially since my sister and friend are both single as well. I hope you understand and I don't want to cause any discomfort. You two are a lovely couple and I'm sure you will have a great time at the event. I hope you understand. We can still meet for coffee or something one day.

I was confused, and didn’t understand why she would have a problem with it or what her deal was. I texted her:
okay no problem, have fun at the event.

She replied to that text with the following:
Oh, I’m not uninviting you. You guys are still welcome to come! I just may not walk with you but I’ll still talk to you.

Someone please help me decipher this. Am I the only one getting the ick from this whole thing? Should my husband and I still go to the event? What if we see her and her group? TYIA ",1,1733354289.0,relationship_advice,3,1.0,False

I realized that gay people listen to songs targeted to gay people. I learned that the pop machine is still working.

I learned that Sabrina Carpenter, Chappell Roan and Billie Eilish were very big acts in 2024, an information I wouldn’t have reached for it was not the amount of Spotify Wrapped screenshots.

For us, scholars of popular musique, today really was a day to say grace (not abrams), to say thanks, to take note. This was the day of the year, like every other year, we clapped because we cared!

For anyone who identifies as a gay person, seeing their gayness reflected through a corporate marketing annual campaign is powerful, it’s something to hold space for, it’s something to shout and scream, and scream and shout, as Britney once said.

My love goes to all of you who have Espresso on your top 5 songs. Such unique taste, such support for indie artists. The coffee brewed and you drank it, girl! You have done it again.

For those who had m*n on their wrapped, it’s time to sit down and think if maybe you’re the problem. America is in shambles. Take accountability. Be held accountable. Talk to an accountant. Do the thing.

There are brave souls out there who streamed Dua Lipa enough to keep her expenses paid as she travels. It was a tough year for her so you are charitable.

For those whose wrapped figured Lana del Rey, there really is not much to say since your SSRI already made you numb to any emotion.

And finally, the brave ones, the great ones, those who pushed the boundries and streamed Diet Pepsi to their own top 5, you are the future. You saw 3000 and late with Fergie. You went there.

1h6uaqy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1h6uaqy/how_to_make_your_small_business_the_local_hero/,How to Make Your Small Business the Local Hero (With a Dash of SEO Magic),"Hi everyone! You know how every town has that one bakery, plumber, or pet groomer everyone raves about? The one that seems to have a secret pact with the Google gods to always show up at the top of search results? Well, spoiler alert: they don’t have a pact. They’ve just mastered the art of local SEO.

What’s local SEO, you ask? Think of it as your digital equivalent of standing in the town square with a big, flashy sign saying, “Hey, we’re awesome, and we’re RIGHT HERE!” Except no shouting is required, and the only pigeons involved are metaphorical.

Now, before your eyes glaze over, let me give you a few tips to turn your business into a local legend:

1. Claim Your Google My Business Listing
This is like putting your business on the digital map—literally. Google loves it when you fill out all the details. It's like a dating profile, but instead of swiping right, customers call, visit, or buy.

2. Sprinkle Some Location-Based Keywords
Think of it as seasoning your content. Instead of ""great coffee,"" try ""best coffee in Springfield that won't make you regret your life choices.""

3. Ensure Consistency Across All Platforms
Your Name, Address, and Phone number (NAP) should be identical everywhere—your website, social media, business directories, and anywhere else your business appears online. Even small discrepancies, like writing ""St."" in one place and ""Street"" in another, can confuse search engines and harm your rankings. Think of it as building trust with Google: consistency shows you’re reliable and credible.

4. Encourage Customer Reviews
Reviews are one of the most powerful factors in local SEO. Positive reviews not only build trust with potential customers but also signal to search engines that your business is worth recommending. Politely ask happy customers to leave a review on Google or other relevant platforms. A quick follow-up email or a friendly mention at the end of a transaction can go a long way. Just remember, authenticity is key—never fake reviews, as they can backfire and damage your reputation.

5. Build Local Backlinks
Backlinks (links to your website from other sites) are like votes of confidence in the online world. Focus on getting links from local sources, such as partnerships with nearby businesses, sponsorships for community events, or being listed in local directories. These local backlinks help search engines understand that your business is a trusted part of the community, boosting your rankings in local search results.

6. Optimize Your Website for Local Search
Make sure your website clearly highlights your location and services. Include your city or neighborhood in page titles, meta descriptions, and headers. Create a dedicated “Contact Us” page with a map, address, and business hours. For service-based businesses, consider adding location-specific landing pages to target nearby areas. This helps search engines (and potential customers) quickly identify where you operate and what you offer.

7. Leverage Social Media for Local Engagement
Social media platforms are a great way to connect with your local audience. Post updates about your business, share community events, and engage with local followers. Tag your location in posts, use location-specific hashtags, and participate in conversations relevant to your area. Active and localized social media presence not only attracts customers but also reinforces your business's connection to the local community in the eyes of search engines.


Now, if all this sounds like something you’d rather delegate to someone who eats, sleeps, and dreams SEO (I’m not saying it’s me, but it’s totally me), I can help. I’ve got a Fiverr gig where I specialize in helping small businesses like yours dominate the local scene. As i cant promote, all who want to boost their businesses can dm me.

Meanwhile, if you’ve got questions, weird SEO theories, or just want to share your business’s journey, hit me up in the comments.

I've known her for 3 months and there's some kind of electricity between us (at least that's my interpretation). We haven't really talked much, just the two of us, but we spent a lot of time with our friends. We study in Europe and she's a typical NY girl (where she grew up), she's very confident, likes to play and fool around. I haven't really shown any serious interest in her over the past few months. I knew we might have some potential, but I didn't want to date within my circle of friends because of obvious problems if it didn't work out. I kept quiet and tried to treat her like my other friends. Sometimes I avoided or ignored her. Not really on purpose, but because I melt very quickly when I get into a direct conversation or eye contact with her. Last week, however, I talked to two friends about the fact that there may be feelings. They both responded unimpressed, saying that they already knew I liked her and that it was obvious to them. Seems like I wasn't acting as cool as I assumed.

From her side, she “flirts” very subtly. It's her glances when we're in class, or showing that she cares about me by small things, reaching for my coffee when my hands are full so I don't spill it. Once, when we were sitting next to each other, I could feel myself and her getting nervous. We both moved slightly together. Another example is when she told me she liked my outfit immediately after another girl had praised it. What I really like on her  is that she likes to disagree with me. She is just doing that with me in our group, when I say, for example, that I like red, she say that she doesn't like it, but the opposite of it. I can't really describe it better, this is all very vague. Maybe I just make this up in my head. Anyways, today after class I walked a while with her. We had a nice but very basic conversation, I didn't know what to say. The past few days, I was waiting for the perfect moment to ask her out. Today, before our ways split up, I ask her if she wants to go to a restaurant or bar soon. She said sure, but this week she is busy. She told me I should text her about it. Me idiot started to text her immediately and asked her about how her dinner was. She responded and I tried to keep up the conversation. She hasn't responded since then. 

I'm not an inexperienced guy with girls, but she makes me feel like a virgin again. I know she's the kind of girl who likes to play hard to get, and I'm the kind of guy who likes that. Right now, I don't know how to act. My gut tells me I should start to pay attention to her, show her that she's important to me and give her clear signals that I like her. On the other hand, I'm not sure if that's too soon, I don't want to mess it up. I think we both enjoy the thrill of uncertainty. So my mind tells me I should play it cool, try to play my feelings down and not exposing myself too early. I think she could loose her interest, if she knows she can easily gets me.

  
Do you have any advises for me? If I play it cool, how should I act? I don't want to ignore her, I would like to show her on a subtile way as well, that I like her. How can I do that?

Hi all. I don’t know about you, but it seems like about once a day I read a post in the sub that says something like “I would not have made it if it had not been for this community“. This community only exists because its moderator, LeftyLibra works so hard to maintain it, and she does it for free. The other day, I went to look up something in the wiki for the umpteenth time and noticed an option to buy her a cup of coffee and I did. I’m encouraging all of us who can to head over there on a regular basis and make whatever donation makes sense for us. This community is invaluable and it can’t persist without good moderating. Let’s show Lefty the love and support she deserves for all the love and support she has shown to us.

""My dearest Drea,

My hope is that someday, it’s you who discovers this letter. Adrian can be impulsive and unpredictable, and I have no idea what he might do in the future.

Drea, my little spark, my strength—I wish I’d had more time to see you grow, to be there for you. You are my heart, my sunshine, and please, always remember that. There’s so much I want to say, but time has grown scarce; I can feel it slipping away. My health is failing quickly, and it’s not by accident.

You deserve to know, Drea, that the reason for my failing health is Vivian—your mother. I wanted so badly for our marriage to work, wanted to share everything with her. But she only cared about my fortune, and she’s gone to great lengths to secure it for herself.

My estate belongs solely to you and Adrian. I wanted to make this clear in a will, but I never expected time to run out this way. I’ve long suspected Vivian was tainting my drinks, but today, I’m certain. She brought me coffee not long ago, and there, faintly on the cup’s rim, were traces of a familiar poison. I could call the police or rush to the hospital, but instead, I choose to write to you now, hoping you find this someday, hidden here in your nursery.

If things go as I hope, David may look after you, maybe even adopt you, though he doesn’t know of you yet. If not, I pray Adrian finds you and keeps you safe. I believe you’ll grow into a remarkable woman, strong and resilient, Drea. Know that I loved you fiercely. Please tell Adrian that despite his anger over my choices, I’m deeply sorry and that I love him as well.

I love you both,

\~Emerson Grant""

The letter slipped from Drea’s trembling fingers, her legs giving way. Sorin quickly wrapped an arm around her shoulders, holding her upright as she crumpled into his side.

Tears blurred her vision, and through them, she looked up at Sorin, whose expression held a quiet grief. Though he was only a child back then, his affection for his uncle had been real.

She managed to choke out, “W-what does this mean?”

""Shh,"" Sorin soothed her, bending to pick up the letter and carefully slipping it into her book. “Not here, not now. Let’s get home, then we can talk.”

She nodded, her lips trembling as tears spilled over. Sorin gently wiped them away, wrapped an arm around her waist, and guided her out of the room. They descended the stairs quietly, moving toward the exit.

Just as they reached the door, her mother’s shrill voice called after them, “Leaving already? You haven’t stayed for lunch.”

Sorin’s jaw clenched tightly. Murderous woman, he thought, before turning to face her with a forced smile. “I’d rather have lunch alone with my wife. Thanks.” With that, he steered Drea out the door.

Once they were safely away, he pulled the car to a stop by the side of the road, dropping his head against the steering wheel. “Damn it, damn it, damn it.”

A soft touch settled over his hand, gripping the wheel tightly. Lifting his head, he found Drea’s gaze, shimmering with unshed tears as she tried to hold them back.

“D-do you… think this could really be true?” Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

He reached for the book and retrieved the letter, directing her gaze to its signature. “Look, he signed it. If we can track down some old documents he might’ve signed, we’ll have proof.” He paused, deep in thought. “Dad must have something lying around.” A loud groan escaped him as he pinched the bridge of his nose, tears gathering in his eyes. “Why did my uncle have to be so reckless? He could’ve at least confided in my father and asked for his help! Damn it!”

Drea intertwined her fingers with his, offering a comforting squeeze. “We… we don’t really know what was going on back then…”

A sob erupted from him. “I loved him so much, Drea. I don’t remember everything, but I know I did. To learn he met such a tragic end…”

Leaning forward, Drea rested her forehead against his bicep, weeping alongside him. He lowered his chin onto her head, tears streaming down his cheeks as they sought solace in one another’s embrace.

After several moments, he wiped his eyes and said, “Call Adrian. Tell him to meet us at home.”

Drea nodded as Sorin drove away. When they arrived, Adrian sat at the dining table, his head bowed and hands gripping his hair in despair, the letter sprawled before him.

Taking a seat beside him, Drea wrapped her arm around him, offering comfort while Sorin stood back, his mind racing as he contemplated their next steps. Grief could wait; justice for his uncle was their immediate priority, and Sorin vowed he wouldn’t rest until it was served.

Suddenly, Adrian shot up from his seat, his eyes bloodshot and wild. He pulled out his pistol from the holster at his waist, making Drea gasp softly in shock.

“That’s it! That woman is going to pay today. I’ve tolerated her long enough!” He growled, striding toward the door. Drea grasped his wrist, desperately trying to halt him.

“Adrian, no!”

I have some disposable Keurig pods on the way, which I am planning to fill with my own beans. But many of you have already warned me that the water contact timing is very short and I am unlikely to get good coffee. I mostly tend to drink well developed light to medium roasts. 

So I am planning to throw in the towel and commit to creating time to brew coffee a couple of times during the day. I am thinking of getting the following 

Kingrinder K6 $99

Cosori Kettle $70 (to control temp) 

Aeropress $30

Cheap scale $15

So not quite <$200 but close. Given I am at work 2-3 days a week, call it brewing about 4-6 cups a week. 

Would love any feedback on the office kit. 

Thanks.

I'm about 1.25 months out of my last dose of 500mg Cipro.

Symptoms:

Mentally paralyzing groin tingling and horrendous anxiety.

I've started a course of Magtein (3x pills = 2000mg/144mg magnesium) over about 3 days so far. What I noticed is that when I take even a single pill with a fatty food (peanut butter or egg etc) all of the above symptoms literally go away. I couldn't tolerate coffee before, but after taking this I can. This effect fades after about 3-5 hours.

My questions:

1. What could this indicate about the condition? This couldn't simply be a bad magnesium deficiency could it?

2. What doses are you all taking? I need to take more than three (2000mg/144mg mag) per day for sure.

\[Midnight in the Greenhouse Rivers, seated on the sofa, was facing, and in extreme proximity to, the object of his very long and ardent quest. Annette was blonde, the type of tress which had all the treasured qualities of golden silk. The room corralled two sofas, a coffee table, and a loveseat. It had once been intended as a small greenhouse. There was barely enough room for people. Rivers’ knee, covered by denim, was nearly touching Annette's knee, which was bare and bright where the bones wanted to show through the skin. They sat facing each other. “It’s tradition,” Rivers said, his voice steady, calming, though there was an undercurrent of something more, something that hinted at the depth of his feelings. His knee was nearly touching hers, and the proximity was both thrilling and terrifying. Annette had high, prominent cheekbones, sharp eyes and arched eyebrows that sculptors could only curse and envy. She raised one of them. “Tradition? The goddamned Britannia comedy hour?” Rivers swallowed, his gaze steady on her, though he could feel the tension in the air, the way the room seemed to hold its breath. “I mean, sort of, the things we watch with the antenna. Like two summers ago.” Her wide, straight mouth curved slightly on one side. That might have been a smirk, but there was no warmth in it. She shifted slightly, her eyes never leaving his. “Two summers ago,” repeated Annette, leaning her head onto her hand so she could worry her hair between her index finger and thumb. This shift caused her tight tweed skirt to cinch even higher up her shapely thighs and to grip her round hips. She leaned back, the movement languid, almost indifferent, as she readjusted her cardigan with an easy grace that belied the tension simmering beneath the surface. Her eyes, sharp and watchful, as though she were gauging his intentions, weighing his words, parsing the subtext of this too-close conversation. “Two summers ago,” she repeated, her voice softening, the words heavy with unspoken meaning. The room was too small. Right on cue, as if summoned by the rising tension, Emily announced herself from the kitchen, her voice bright and untroubled, cutting through the charged silence like a splash of cold water. “Hey boss! I didn’t know you were here!” She jiggled herself for joy, her exuberance a jarring contrast to the heavy atmosphere in the room, before rushing down the stairs into what had once been a haven of sun and plants, now a too-small fortress of awkward intimacy. The room had been their home base, their tree fort, a place where, in softer times, a lookout would have been required. It held the remnants of past seasons, the faint smell of pine oil and sun lingering in the air, but the saplings were trees now, and in Middlemass, the trees were ghosts. The room, with its mix of exposed brick and ancient timber, had the look of a space where things happened, where alliances were forged and secrets were kept. “Hey kid,” answered Rivers, acknowledging the girl with a tone that was almost paternal, though tinged with a resignation that came from wanting something more than this constant interruption. He had wanted to be alone with Annette, to unravel the complexities of whatever it was that lay between them, but it would have been illogical to react with irritation. That would make about as much sense as getting angry with a tiny puppy. Conversely, it was well known that a wild hare sat in the control room of Emily’s mind, mashing buttons and throwing levers just to see what would happen. Emily was dressed in a tight tee cotton shirt that her two recent growth spurts should have disallowed, the fabric stretched across her chest in a way that was both innocent and indecent, and tiny cotton shorts that would have been illegal in some states. She moved with a kind of casual confidence that bordered on recklessness, a girl who had never met a boundary she didn’t test. She did an uncharacteristically deft turn in front of Rivers before seating herself across his lap, her arm winding around his shoulders with a familiarity that could have been provocative had the twain not been thicker than thieves, comrades of old and forgotten wars, and partners in crime. The room was both too small and too large. “What are you doing with my sister?” questioned Annette, her tone flat, but Rivers knew that this was not a joke, but an overall, blanket accusation. “I am just sitting here. On the other hand, I doubt your sister is breaking any of the queen’s laws,” answered the boy, his hand instinctively settling on Emily’s hip, the warmth of her body seeping through the thin cotton. Leaving his hand to sit limp would have been the recourse of a coward. “Don’t mind me,” teased Emily, her voice light, playful, but with an edge that hinted at deeper awareness, “what were we talking about?” Emily’s hair was blonde too, but a blonde of rolling northern wheat fields. And, instead of being silky it was as strong and thick as Rapunzel and Pipi Longstocking put together. It was braided into ram horns, which conveyed her overall energy nicely. Emily did not care what they were talking about, or rather, she already knew. Rivers’ (nearly) unrequited passion for Annette was an open secret, the kind of thing that everyone acknowledged but no one discussed openly. The younger sister was there to witness the real-life drama, and preferred front-row seats. “Midnight television,” offered Rivers, his voice as casual as he could manage, though his hand remained firm on Emily’s hip, a silent declaration of his intentions, whatever they might be. Emily made a triumphant gesture, her body shifting against his in a way that was more than suggestive, causing her to lose her balance and smash even more scandalously against the boy: a spark that lit up the room in ways that had nothing to do with the lighting. “The show comes on at eleven-fifteen,” corrected Annette, her voice a cool counterpoint to the hijinks being perpetrated by Rivers and Emily. “True, but no one calls it ‘eleven-fifteen television’,” countered Rivers, his tone a little sharper now, a little more insistent. Suddenly switching to a quavering mid-Atlantic accent, Emily threw out her free arm and pronounced, “I, Queen Charlotte, hereby decree that all late-night broadcast viewing shall henceforth be known as ‘midnight television’. Carry this message to all the corners of my kingdom! MY KINGDOM.” The young woman then adulated herself, slapping Rivers on the shoulder and laughing, a sound that was both innocent and wicked, a reminder that she was still just a girl playing at being a woman. “Who’s better than me?” she asked, her eyes sparkling with mischief, referring to her sudden burst of acting talent. “Nobody,” agreed Rivers, his tone appreciative, though his mind, at least, was still on Annette, still trying to decipher the look in her eyes, the way her body remained just out of reach, even when she was so close. “You should act all the time,” offered Annette, her voice cutting, her eyes narrowing as she watched her sister, “then no one would have to put up with the real you.” “She hates me,” confessed Emily to Rivers sheepishly, her tone confidential, as though they were co-conspirators in some grand scheme. “You bring it on yourself,” prescribed Rivers, his voice gentle, but firm, the kind of tone that suggested he knew her better than she knew herself. “I do. I really, really do,” admitted Emily, her voice full of exaggerated contrition. “Popcorn?” “Amazing,” agreed Rivers, his voice slipping into a cooler register, exploring the depths of nonchalance as he watched her climb off his lap. “Amazing,” repeated Emily, her tone mocking as she imitated his voice, each repetition a little sharper, a little more exaggerated, until it became a caricature of his own words. “‘Amazing, that’s amazing,’” she repeated incessantly as she strolled back up the stairs into the kitchen, snapping on some of the lights as she went, her movements fluid, almost careless. Once she was out of earshot, Annette turned her gaze back to Rivers, as if seeing him for the first time that evening. “You are the only one who is nice to her. Even Mother…” She trailed off, her voice softening, but then her tone sharpened again. “Are you trying to win a good-guy award around here, or something?” Rivers tilted his head and smirked, giving her a moment before answering. “No one has ever accused me of that before,” he said, his voice tinged with irony, as though the very idea was laughable. “Fine,” said Annette, standing up from the loveseat and slapping the wall behind her, causing the projector to turn on with a low hum. She sighed, climbing over to the spot on Rivers’ right, her movements fluid but deliberate. Though she was wearing knee socks, she shoved her feet under him, the contact warm, almost intimate. “There, now you’re a hot-water bottle. Happy?” Rivers looked at the projected rectangle of white light as it turned to static, the screen flickering in the dim room. “Be careful what you wish for, I suppose.” “Brat,” accused Annette, but the word was softened by the contentment in her voice as she positioned herself against one of the large pillows, her body finally relaxing into the moment, the tension between them ebbing away, if only for now. \]
